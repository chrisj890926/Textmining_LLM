To have justified consideration of the questions of waiver and estoppel by the jury in this case when it was 
submitted there should have been evidence of at least three of the essential elements of waiver and estoppel, upon 
which such evidence was completely lacking, viz.: An intention of the plaintiff to relinquish or waive the clause on 
credit violation, reliance by the defendant upon the waiver and alteration of its position, and the passing from the 
defendant to the plaintiff of some valuable consideration for it. (27 R. C. L. 904, 908, sec. 5; Idaho Grimm Alfalfa 
Seed Growers' Assn. v. Stroschein, 42 Idaho 12, 47 A. L. R. 916, 242 P. 444; Ohio Confectionery Co. v. Eimon 
Mercantile Co., 154 Minn. 420, 191 N. W. 910; Craig v. White, 187 Cal. 489, 202 P. 648; Castleman v. Stryker, 109 
Ore. 207, 219 [***2]  P. 1084; Woolley v. Loose, 57 Utah 336, 14 A. L. R. 372, 194 P. 908.)
The contracts between the plaintiff and Trist Auto Company and Bannock Motor Company on the one hand and 
between it and the defendant or the other primafacially and presumptively legal did not contravene or violate in their 
making or operation any rule of law or statute of the state of Idaho and were not in any manner illegal. (6 R. C. L. 
694; Bayles v. Kansas P. Ry. Co., 13 Colo. 181, 22 P. 341, 5 L. R. A. 480; C. L. of Idaho, 1919, sec. 2534 (section 
which the court concluded the transactions, violated).)

Waiver may be made by an express agreement or promise declaring an intention not to claim the supposed benefit 
or advantage, and such agreement or declaration will not only waive those matters coming expressly within its 
terms, but will extend to other matters which by a natural and necessary implication would be affected.
The more usual manner of waiving a right is by conduct or acts which indicate an intention to relinquish the right, or 
by such failure to insist upon it that the party is estopped to afterwards set it up against his adversary. (40 Cyc. 
 [***3]  265.)
Intent to waive can be constructive as well as actual. ( Somers v. Germania Nat. Bank, 152 Wis. 210, 138 N. W. 
713.)
In determining whether a given contract contravenes public policy, the test is not always nor necessarily what acts 
the parties performed or contemplated in order to fulfill their agreement or its actual result, but rather whether its 
tendency is evil. ( Oliver v. Wilder, 27 Colo. App. 337, 149 P. 275.)
Every contract, combination or agreement whose direct purpose, probable effect or necessary tendency is to stifle 
or unduly restrict competition is unlawful by common law and by statute. (19 R. C. L. 36, sec. 20.)
The test is the evil tendency of the contract and not its actual injury to the public in a particualr case.
And agreements whose tendency is to establish a monopoly are void although they may not in the particular case 
destroy competition or enhance prices. (13 C. J. 425; Russell v. Courier Printing & Pub. Co., 43 Colo. 321, 95 P. 
936; Craft v. McConoughy, 79 Ill. 346, 22 Am. Rep. 171.)"

Solicitor General Biggs, with whom Assistant Attorney General Stephens and Messrs. Moses S. Huberman, Robert 
E. Healy, and Everett F. Haycraft were on the brief, for respondent.
After the Commission issued its complaint, the original respondent, by means of its illegal stock control, caused 
petitioner to be created by the consolidation of the two manufacturing corporations.  The purpose of the 
consolidation was to oust the Commission of its jurisdiction.  All of the directors, officers, and stockholders of the 
original respondent became the directors, officers and voting stockholders of petitioner.  Under § 11 of the Clayton 
Act, read in the light of its general purpose and applied with a view to effectuate such purpose, the Commission had 
jurisdiction to join petitioner, as a party respondent, in the [****3]  pending proceeding and to order petitioner to 
divest itself of the assets of one or the other of the manufacturing corporations.  Federal Trade Comm'n v. Western 
Meat Co., 272 U.S. 554, 559. Unless this be true, the Commission has no power to enforce compliance with this 
provision of the Clayton Act."

1613,Counsel,"Counsel: 'Yes, Your Honor.'
At the conclusion of the court's charge to the jury, the court said at the bench to counsel:
'I think it might be understood for the record that all objections and exceptions heretofore taken by respective 
counsel for the defendants will be considered as if they were now made at this time and entered in the record and 
have the same force and effect as if repeated on the grounds heretofore given.'
All"
1614,Counsel,"Counsel: 'So stipulated.'
Counsel for appellants then stated other and further objections to the instructions given and refused.
The procedure shown above is substantially that often used by district judges in their compliance with Rule 30.  It 
saves time. It is generally acceptable to counsel and opportunity  [**19]  is given for further objections, in addition to 
those previously made and incorporated by reference.
 Ziegler v. U.S., 9 Cir., 1949, 174 F.2d 439, 448, certiorari denied 338 U.S. 822, 70 S.Ct. 68, 94 L.Ed. 499, first cast 
a possible doubt on this procedure.  In that case the trial court, before giving the instructions, informed counsel of its 
proposed action but no objection was made by defendant.  The court on appeal,  [*745]  however, used language 
inferring that objections made 'before the charge was given' was not a compliance with Rule 30.
Later in Remmer v. U.S., 9 Cir., 1953, 205 F.2d 277, the same circuit distinguished the Ziegler case in Note 16, 
page 290, and approved the same procedure followed in the instant case.
We do not regard Kobey v. United States, 9 Cir., 1953, 208 F.2d 583 as disapproving the procedure followed in the 
instant case, or as overruling the Remmer case.  In the Kobey case there was not an arranged procedure for 
incorporation by reference but merely a general, all-inclusive objection.  The cases cited in footnote 3 of the Kobey 
case are good law to the effect that objection must be made to instructions and that a general objection is not good 
but  [**20]  that the objection must be specific.  The Remmer case is not cited.
210 F.2d 732, *744; 1954 U.S. App. LEXIS 4297, **16

 
We consider the Remmer case as expressly approving the procedure followed in the trial of the instant case, and 
HN8[
] hold the procedure proper under Rule 30, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. 6.
(B) Rule 18(2) (d) of this Court.
 Appellants have failed to comply with Rule 18(2) (d) of this court in presenting the instruction problem in their brief.  
HN9[
] The rule requires 'when the error alleged is to the charge of the court, the specification shall set out the 
part referred to totidem verbis, whether it be instructions given of in instructions refused, together with the grounds 
of the objections urged at the trial.'
Reference by summary and number is made by appellant to certain instruction.  The grounds of objection we find 
only by a search of the record.  Some of the instructions complained of were not objected to before the trial court 
and in the case of others, the objections stated to the trial judge were meaningless and of no assistance to that 
court.
(C) The Instructions.
However, we proceed to examine the instructions.  We have already held the commerce allegations of the 
indictment sufficient as alleging the  [**21]  commission of acts which unreasonably restrained that commerce either 
under the 'in' or the 'affect' commerce theory.
Government counsel apparently thought he was proceeding on two alternative theories at the trial:- First, that the 
proof would show, that the plumbing contractors were 'conduits' and that there was a continuous and uninterrupted 
flow of plumbing supplies in interstate commerce from out of state into southern Nevada to their place of use or 
installation, and that the acts complained of unreasonably restricted the flow of such commerce. Second, and 
alternatively, that even if the interstate commerce ended with the plumbing contractor and if the activities of the 
plumbing contractors complained of were purely intrastate activities, nevertheless their activities unreasonably and 
substantially affected the flow of interstate commerce. The government asks us to sustain the conviction on both 
grounds.
As to whether both theories are available in support of the conviction we shall now see.
The 'in' commerce theory
 The court properly left to the jury the questions as to whether the flow of materials was from out of state, and was 
through the conduit of the plumbing contractors  [**22]  and was in commerce, and whether the appellants agreed 
to fix prices or allocate jobs.
Instruction 25 reads, in part:
'The indictment alleges that there exists a flow of commerce from manufacturers of plumbing and  [*746]  heating 
supplies located outside of Nevada to their place of installation and use in buildings in southern Nevada and that 
the plumbing contractors are conduits through which these supplies manufactured and shipped from other states 
are sold and distributed to the consuming public in southern Nevada.  It is for you to decide whether this allegation 
is true beyond a reasonable doubt. * * *'
Instruction 23 reads, in part:
'In order to violate the Sherman Act, the activities of the defendants must affect commodities which move in 
interstate commerce. I charge you that if you find that the trade and commerce in plumbing and heating supplies is 
as alleged in the indictment, and if you further find that defendants agreed to fix the prices to be used by plumbing 
6.  The court in the Ziegler case consisted of Mathews, Stephens, and Driver (District Judge).  The court in the Remmer case 
consisted of Mathews, Stephens and Orr.  The court in the Kobey case consisted of Mathews, Orr and Lemmon (District Judge).  
(Judge italicized wrote opinion)
210 F.2d 732, *745; 1954 U.S. App. LEXIS 4297, **20

 
contractors in submitting bids for the sale and installation of such supplies or that they agreed upon a particular 
contractor to furnish such supplies on a specific job, then violation of the Sherman Act  [**23]  has been 
established. * * *'
While instructions refused are not asserted as error except by listing the numbers, we have examined them as they 
apply to this aspect of the case, and find no error.
The 'affect' commerce theory
 HN10[
] 'The injury, and hence the power, (to regulate intrastate transactions) does not depend upon the 
fortuitous circumstance that the particular person conducting the intrastate activities is, or is not, also engaged in 
interstate commerce.' U.S. v. Wrightwood Dairy Co., 1942, 315 U.S. 110, 121, 62 S.Ct. 523, 527, 86 L.Ed. 726 (our 
insertion).  'If it is interstate commerce that feels the pinch, it does not matter how local the operation which applies 
the squeeze.' U.S. v. Women's Sportswear Manufacturers Ass'n, 1949, 336 U.S. 460, 464, 69 S.Ct. 714, 716, 93 
L.Ed 805.
 There are several instructions which squint at the 'affect commerce' theory.  HN11[
] To sustain the conviction on 
this theory it would be necessary that the jury be given at least basic instructions as to the law pertaining to the 
theory and basic instructions which presented the appellants' defense, leaving to the jury to decide whether 
appellants' activities were wholly intrastate and whether such activities  [**24]  nevertheless affected interstate 
commerce. The question of this 'affect' is a question of fact.
 Thus instruction No. 23 stated in part that if the jury found an agreement existed to fix prices or divide up jobs, then 
violation of the Sherman Act had been established.  The instruction was proper as pertaining to the 'in commerce' 
theory.  It does not touch the 'affect commerce' theory.
 The trial judge, after summarizing the allegations of the indictment on interstate commerce which were the basis for 
the government's 'in commerce' theory, (par. 12 to 17 incl. thereof; see note 1) then charged the jury as follows in 
instruction No. 25:
'* * * if you find these allegations as to commerce to be true, and if you further find beyond a reasonable doubt that 
the defendants agreed in advance of the shipment of these supplies into the state of Nevada to fix the prices at 
which they would be distributed and sole after the completion of that interstate journey, then I instruct you that such 
fixing of prices necessarily affected the free and untrammeled flow of such supplies while they were still in interstate 
commerce * * *.'
This instruction fitted into the plan of instruction on the 'in  [**25]  commerce' theory.  But because it stated that 
price fixing necessarily affected commerce it did not leave to the jury the factual question of the impact of wholly 
intrastate activities on interstate commerce and hence is not available as presenting the 'affect commerce' theory.
 [*747]   The trial judge then gave instruction No. 26. 7. [**43]  This was a proper instruction §§ part of the 
instructions on the 'affect commence' theory- but it is the only instruction on such theory.
Government counsel now argue the effect of these instructions as follows:
7.  'A combination may be in restraint of interstate trade and commerce within the meaning of the Sherman Act even through 
(though) the restraint is applied before the interstate journey beings (begins) or after it has ended.
'Prices fixed in advance to effect a product at the end of its interstate journey are an interference with that commerce, although, 
at the time the sale is actually made, the product originating in interstate commerce may actually have come to rest on the shelf 
of the 'retailer.' It is the agreement on prices, in advance, which constitutes the violations, not the sale at the price.
'In assaying price-fixing agreements, the test is not so much whether the effect is felt after the movement of the goods has 
reached the end of the interstate journey.  The inquiry seeks the effect upon prices in the market.  And if this effect be shown, it 
matters not that the movement has come to a halt within the state.'
210 F.2d 732, *746; 1954 U.S. App. LEXIS 4297, **22

 
'* * * Thus there was left to the jury the factual question of whether the defendants agreed in advance of the 
shipment of the supplies into Nevada to fix the prices at which they would be distributed and sold after the 
completion of that interstate journey.  If the jury so found, and if the jury further found the trade and commerce 
allegations to be true, said the court in effect, then in such event it followed as a matter of law, the court instructed, 
that such fixing of prices necessarily affected the free flow of such supplies in interstate commerce * * *.'
 Government counsel does not analyze his two alternate theories on which he  [**26]  seeks affirmance of the 
conviction below.  True, HN12[
] a price fixing conspiracy which operates on or within the flow of interstate 
commerce affects that commerce as a matter of law. But a price fixing conspiracy at a purely local or intrastate level 
does not, as a matter of law, affect the flow of commerce. Whether a purely local or intrastate conspiracy 
unreasonably restrains interstate commerce is primarily a factual question, i.e. does the local price fixing conspiracy 
affect substantially the flow of interstate commerce? If the answer is yes, then only are we concerned with the effect 
of the price-fixing under the per se doctrine.  In fact, unless there is a finding that the local and intrastate activities 
complained of and as alleged in the indictment, substantially affected interstate commerce, there is no jurisdiction in 
a district court over the alleged Sherman Act violation.  Such a finding could only result from proper instructions and 
the jury verdict of guilty thereon.
It appears therefore that the court never presented by instructions the alternate theory of 'affect' on commerce. This 
could have been done by instructions that if the jury found that interstate commerce  [**27]  terminated when the 
plumbing contractors received the supplies, and if the jury found that the plumbing contractors were engaged wholly 
in intrastate activities, then the jury should determine whether, nevertheless, appellants' activities as charged in the 
indictment, substantially affected interstate commerce in the manner and as charged in Sec. V of the indictment. 8. 
 [*748]  The Government may have had two strings to its bow, but it obviously failed to fasten one string.  Since we 
hold that the 'affect commerce' theory was never presented to the jury, by instructions, we do not consider rejected 
instructions.
 There remains the question as to whether the appellants suffered any prejudice through the failure to instruct on 
the 'affect commerce' theory; relied on by the Government.
This is not a situation where an indictment presents a single theory of guilt and where defendants' theory of defense 
thereto, was not submitted to the jury.  Such would, of course, be error.
This is a case where the Government proceeded on two alternate theories relating to (1) matters complained of in 
the flow of commerce, and (2) matters complained of in intrastate commerce substantially affecting  [**28]  
interstate commerce after the flow in commerce had ceased.  Either theory properly presented to the jury would 
support a conviction on the facts of this case.  The appellants contended that their activities were wholly intrastate 
and had in fact no substantial effect on interstate commerce and that their acts were done after the flow of goods in 
commerce ceased.
This contention, if found by the jury to be true, would be a defense to a prosecution on either the 'in commerce', or 
the alternate 'affect commerce' theory.  But under proper instructions given on the 'in commerce' theory, the jury 
found a continuous and uninterrupted flow of commerce through the plumbing contractors as conduits, to the places 
of installation of the plumbing supplies in southern Nevada and further found that appellants conspired to fix prices 
8.  'The purpose, intent and necessary effect of the aforesaid combination and conspiracy has been and is to directly, 
unreasonably, arbitrarily and unlawfully restrain and obstruct the flow of plumbing and heating supplies in interstate commerce 
into Southern Nevada by:
'(a) Suppressing and eliminating competition among plumbing contractors in the sale, distribution and installation of plumbing 
and heating supplies by fixing both the prices of the supplies sold and the prices charged for the subsequent installation of these 
supplies;
'(b) Narrowing and restricting the market in which builders, owners and other consumers are able to purchase plumbing and 
heating supplies in Southern Nevada.'
210 F.2d 732, *747; 1954 U.S. App. LEXIS 4297, **43

 
and to divide the market, per se violations, which as a matter of law, affected the flow of commerce and convicted 
appellants.  The appellants cannot complain, since they have not been hurt.
Substantial effect on interstate commerce
 Government counsel argue that it was plainly not for the jury to decide whether a per se violation such as price 
fixing has a necessary  [**29]  effect upon commerce; that price fixing at any level necessarily affects interstate 
commerce as a matter of law and that the law conclusively presumes such an effect.
Assuming an 'in commerce' situation, we can agree.  But when the 'affect' on commerce theory is presented, it is 
clearly a question of fact whether wholly intrastate activities affect interstate commerce in a manner proscribed by 
the Sherman Act. After this question is decided, then the per se doctrine may well apply
Appellants argue that the effect on interstate commerce of the acts complained of, must be substantial.  They 
contend also the question of substantiality should have been submitted to the jury. The question should have been 
submitted on the 'affect commerce' theory.  But we are now concerned with only the 'in commerce' theory remaining 
in the case.
 HN13[
] The test of the impact on commerce is qualitative not quantitative * * * 'Sec. 1 of the Act brands as illegal 
the character of the restraint not the amount of commerce affected.' U.S. v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 
225, ft. note 59, 60 S.Ct. 811, 845, and cases cited therein.
 On the facts of this case discussed heretofore, the restraint was substantial.   [**30]  The jury found by its verdict 
that the defendants, as charged in the indictment, had engaged in an illegal conspiracy to fix the price of and divide 
the market for plumbing and heating supplies, violations per se 9. 'flowing' in  [*749]  the stream of interstate 
commerce. The proscribed and substantial effect of these illegal acts followed as a matter of law. Ethyl Gasoline 
Corp. v. U.S., 1940, 309 U.S. 436, 458, 60 S.Ct. 618, 84 L.Ed. 852; U.S. v. Trenton Potteries Co., 1927, 273 U.S. 
392, 47 S.Ct. 377, 71 L.Ed 700.
 The appellants complain that certain of the instructions dealt with elements of the case such as price fixing without 
reference to the relationship which should exist between such activities and interstate commerce to establish a 
violation of the Sherman Act. Later instructions fully covered this aspect of the case.  The instructions given to the 
jury must be read together.  No one instruction presents all the law pertaining to the case.  We find no error.
IV.
The Instructions on the Presumption of Innocence
Appellants complain of a portion of instruction 4 given to the jury.  'The defendants are presumed to be innocent at 
all stages of the proceeding, until  [**31]  the evidence introduced on behalf of the government shows them to be 
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.'
Appellants have not complied with Rule 18(2) (d) of this court, supra.  But searching the record for the objection 
before the trial judge, we find:
'Instruction No. 4, we object to that on the ground it states the issue negatively, and further the defendants are 
entitled to an affirmative statement and a more comprehensive statement thereof.' Appellants urge the effect of the 
instruction was to require the jury to discard the presumption of innocence if at any time during the trial they might 
find the appellants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
9.  'Violation per se' means that the acts complained of constitute a violation regardless of the alleged reasonableness of the 
restraint which is affected thereby or the facts which are offered in justification of the restraint.  As a matter of law the per se 
violation has an effect on commerce. 'Violation per se' does not mean (as the government contends) that the acts complained of, 
to-wit, a conspiracy to fix prices and divide the market, automatically and illegally affect interstate commerce in a case where 
such intrastate activities are alleged to have an 'effect' on the interstate flow of commerce. This is a question of fact.
210 F.2d 732, *748; 1954 U.S. App. LEXIS 4297, **28

 
 Such objection was not made before the trial judge.  The purpose of requiring objections after instructions were 
given is to permit a trial judge to correct erroneous instructions.
 Appellants' requested instruction No. 3, (not given by the court) reads: 'A defendant in a criminal action is 
presumed to be innocent until the contrary is proven * * *'.
Appellants' present arguments could apply as well to their own requested instruction.  HN14[
] Counsel for 
defendants in a criminal action cannot play fast and loose with the trial judge and then  [**32]  complain of error on 
appeal.
The court, at the outset of the trial, thoroughly indoctrinated the jury as to the presumption of innocence.
'The defendants and each of them are presumed to be innocent at all stages of this trial, unless that time arrives, if 
it does arrive- it may not arrive- that the evidence in the case should convince the jury, or a member of the jury, that 
one or all of the defendants is guilty.  Then, of course, the presumption of innocence no longer exists * * *.  This 
presumption of of innocence is a strong, substantial living thing and it is the bulwark of our liberty in this country.  It 
is the thing that makes our country stand out as the one place remaining where we have liberty.  Take away this 
presumption of innocence and you have at one fell swoop destroyed all of our government * * * I think it is the most 
important thing that we have, and I want each member of the jury to have that view of it and to require the 
government to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.  If the government fails to prove every material element 
of the charge against each of these defendants,  [*750]  the defendant against whom that has not been proved is 
entitled to be  [**33]  acquitted and any defendant against whom the government has not maintained or 
accomplished its burden, is to be acquitted * * *.'
 An instruction similar to the one complained of was held not erroneous in: Allen v. U.S., 1896, 164 U.S. 492, 500, 
17 S.Ct. 154, 41 L.Ed. 528.
See Agnew v. U.S., 1897, 165 U.S. 36, 51, 17 S.Ct. 235, 41 L.Ed. 624; Holt v. U.S., 1910, 218 U.S. 245, 253, 31 
S.Ct. 2, 54 L.Ed. 1021; Mullaney v. U.S., 9 Cir., 1936, 82 F.2d 638.
Compare the brief instruction in Canella v. U.S., 9 Cir., 1946, 157 F.2d 470.
On the whole record we find no error in the instruction given.
V.
The Alsup Appeal
Alsup has filed separate briefs and in addition relies on the briefs filed in behalf of the other appellants.
(A) The sufficiency of the indictment as to Alsup
 Alsup contends that the facts alleged in the indictment were insufficient to constitute an offense against the laws of 
the United States insofar as he was concerned.  He contends 'the only portions of the indictment referring to * * * 
Alsup appear in paragraph 7 and 19 * * *'.  Paragraph 7 lists Alsup as an indicted co-conspirator and 19(f) alleges 
that to secure compliance with the plan to fix prices and allocate  [**34]  bids, Alsup would induce plumbers not to 
work for any contractor other than the one designated under the plan.
But Alsup as an indicted co-conspirator was charged with having 'conspired' and taking the allegations of the 
indictment as true for the purposes of his contention, a crime was clearly charged against him.  The unlawful 
conspiracy was the gist of the crime.
Paragraph 19(f) of the indictment was merely a part of the description of how the unlawful plan would operate.  The 
charge against Alsup does not rest merely on paragraphs 7 and 19, but upon the whole of the indictment.
The sufficiency of the indictment to charge an offense under the Sherman Act has been considered heretofore.
210 F.2d 732, *749; 1954 U.S. App. LEXIS 4297, **31

 
(B) The sufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction as to Alsup
 Alsup raises the contention that the evidence was not sufficient to support his conviction, but the record shows his 
active participation in the conspiracy from its inception in mid-August of 1950.  He was present and participated in 
the first meeting between the plumbing contractors, when the organization and the setting up of an estimator was 
discussed.  Bates, a plumbing contractor present at the meeting testified that  [**35]  he said to Alsup that he 'did 
not see how the deal could be made to work.' Alsup replied that he thought 'we will have something that will work 
this time.' He said he was in a position where if the people did not go along with him he was in a position to get 
them to comply.  The evidence shows further that Alsup forbid journeymen plumbers, employees of Ritter, a 
contractor, to work for Ritter until he promised to withdraw a bid which he had given out of line with the purpose of 
the conspiracy. In addition, Sylvester, an outside plumbing contractor who was awarded a plumbing contract on the 
Las Vegas race track went to Alsup's office to obtain men.  Two of the plumbing contractors, appellants herein, 
attempted to get him to back out of the deal.  In Sylvester's presence they asked Alsup to protect them.  Alsup 
readily furnished plumbers to Sylvester on another project for the Atomic Energy Commission at the same time he 
refused to furnish plumbers to work at the race track.  The jury could rightfully infer, and so did, that Alsup's actions 
were in answer to the pleas of the plumbing contractors that they be protected.
The charge is conspiracy and the gist of the crime is the unlawful  [**36]  agreement.
 [*751]   The evidence was sufficient to warrant the verdict against Alsup.
(C) There were no errors in the admission or rejection of evidence as to Alsup
Alsup contends that the admission of the testimony given by Hansen of a conversation had with Swan (the 
estimator) was error.  Swan told Hansen to contact his office with the proposition that another plumbing company 
get a certain contract.
Swan was employed as the estimator by the appellants.  He prepared material for their bid making and kept a 
record of which plumbing contractor got the business.  He was either a co-conspirator, though not indicted, or the 
agent of the appellant co-conspirators. His statement to Hansen was in furtherance of the conspiracy.
Appellants' attorney at oral argument conceded Alsup was the agent for the defendant co-conspirators. Swan's 
conversation as testified to by Hansen was either in furtherance of the conspiracy (if he was a co-conspirator) Clune 
v. U.S., 1895, 159 U.S. 590, at page 593, 16 S.Ct. 125, 40 L.Ed. 269; U.S. v. Harrison, 3 Cir., 1941, 121 F.2d 930, 
934, certiorari denied 314 U.S. 661, 62 S.Ct. 124, 86 L.Ed. 530, or within the scope of his agency for the 
defendants  [**37]  and in furtherance of the conspiracy (if he was only their agent).
 HN15[
] The rule of criminal agency, although not as broad as in civil cases, applies in criminal cases.  If there is 
sufficient evidence and the jury concludes that the acts of the agent were done with appellants' 'authority and under 
(their) direction,' Pearson v. U.S., 9 Cir., 1945, 147 F.2d 950, 952, the agents' acts bind the appellants as principals.  
U.S. v. Perillo, 2 Cir., 1947, 164 F.2d 645; U.S. v. Gooding, 1827, 12 Wheat. 460, 468, 469, 6 L.Ed. 693; Goldsmith 
v. U.S., 2 Cir., 1930, 42 F.2d 133, 138, 139, certiorari denied 282 U.S. 837, 51 S.Ct. 26, 75 L.Ed. 743.
Here there was clear evidence of the agency.
 The HN16[
] supposed distinction between the acts of a co-conspirator and those of an agent in a criminal case, 
is in reality one without a difference.  The basic rule is that 'the acts of any agent, within the scope of his authority, 
are competent against his principal.' U.S. v. Olweiss, 2 Cir., 1944, 138 F.2d 798, 800. Thus in either situation the 
evidence was properly admitted.
 Krulewitch v. U.S., 1949, 336 U.S. 440, 69 S.Ct. 716, 93 L.Ed. 790, relied on by Alsup, held that an admission of a 
co-conspirator, not  [**38]  in furtherance of the conspiracy, was not admissible.  This rule does not aid the 
appellant, Alsup.
210 F.2d 732, *750; 1954 U.S. App. LEXIS 4297, **34

 
The same result would follow as to the same conversation between Swan and Hansen as testified to by witness 
Anderson who listened in on a phone extension.  Alsup also alleges error in excluding evidence and relies on the 
briefs of the other appellants.  Such a point is not discussed by the remaining appellants.
(D) Alsup's status as a business agent for a labor Union does not give him immunity from prosecution
 Alsup contends that his status as a business agent for a labor Union, makes him immune from prosecution.
Labor Unions, their members and officials enjoy no all-inclusive exemption from prosecution under the Sherman 
Act.
Cases relied on by Alsup show that HN17[
] if Unions combine with non-labor groups, U.S. v. Hutcheson, 312 
U.S. 219, 232, 61 S.Ct. 463, 85 L.Ed. 788, or aid and abet business in a violation of the Act, Allen Bradley Co. v. 
Local Union No. 3, 325 U.S. 797, 801, 65 S.Ct. 1535, 89 L.Ed. 2939, they come within the prohibition of the 
Sherman Act.
 Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 1940, 310 U.S. 469, 60 S.Ct. 982, 84 L.Ed. 1311, relied upon by Alsup was a case 
where Union defendants  [**39]  were acting on their own without concert with business interests and is hence 
distinguishable from  [*752]  the case at hand.  There is no merit to this contention.
Numerous other alleged errors are assigned and discussed but we find the contentions to be without sufficient merit 
to immortalize them by discussion, and thus add pages to already crowded law libraries.  The judgments are
Affirmed.

determined the status of resale price maintenance contracts between a manufacturer and his dealer under the 
common law of Missouri.  Clark v. Frank, 17 Mo. App. 602; 19 Mich. Law Review, l.c. 270.  (8) Resale price 
maintenance agreements are unlawful at common law as being against public policy and void.  Boston Store of

337.  (13) The evidence presented before the Special Commissioner showed that Miles' price maintenance policy 
and practices were in violation of the Missouri anti-trust laws.  The evidence did show that Miles entered into 
agreements and understandings with Missouri retailers to fix the retail price of Miles' products, in violation of the 
Missouri anti-trust laws.  Secs. 416.010, 416.020, 416.030, 416.040, RSMo 1949; United States v. A. Schrader's 
Son, 252 U.S. 85, 40 S. Ct. 251, 64 L. Ed. 471; United States v. United Shoe Machinery Co., 234 Fed. 127; Dr. 
Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park & Sons, 220 U.S. 73, 31 [***8]  S. Ct. 376, 55 L. Ed. 502.  (14) The activities of 
Miles in maintaining the retail price of its products in Missouri went beyond those permissible under the ""single 
trader"" doctrine.  United States v. A. Schrader's Son, 252 U.S. 85, 64 L. Ed. 471; Federal Trade Comm. v. Beech-
Nut Packing Co., 257 U.S. 441, 67 L. Ed. 307; United States v. Bausch & Lomb Optical Co., 321 U.S. 707, 88 L.

Schwegmann Brothers v. Calvert Distillers Corp., 341 U.S. 384, 71 S. Ct. 745, 95 L. Ed. 1035.  (15) This court 
should not follow the doctrine of the Colgate case in applying to Missouri anti-trust laws.  Toledo Pipe-Threading 
Machine Co. v. Federal Trade Comm., 11 F. (2d) 337; Adams Mitchell Co. v. Cambridge Distilling Co., 189 F. (2d) 
913; Refusals to Sell and Public Control of Competition,  [***9]  58 Yale Law Journal 1121.  (16) The evidence 
before the commissioner showed that the activities of Miles in maintaining the retail price of its products in Missouri 
resulted in a system of implied agreements and understandings with retailers throughout the state, contrary to the 
Missouri anti-trust laws.  Yankwich, Competition, Real or Soft, 14 F.R.D. 199.

Wholesale Drug Company and Meyer Brothers Drug Company; Kenneth E. Midgley and Blackmar, Newkirk, Eager, 
Swanson & Midgley for McPike Drug Company; Robert A. Brown, Jr., and Brown, Douglas & Brown for C.D. Smith 
Drug Company. 
In view of the findings of the Commissioner and the position now taken by the relator, we believe there is no issue 
now remaining before the court involving any of the factor-respondents and that a finding of not guilty and an order 
of dismissal as to them can properly be entered as of course.

Happer, Slabaugh & Byron and Watson, Ess, Whittaker, Marshall  [***10]   & Enggas of counsel. 
(1) The commissioner's report should be adopted unless affirmatively shown to be wrong.  State ex inf. Barker v. 
Armour Packing Co., 265 Mo. 121, 176 S.W. 382.  (2) The burden of proof rests upon the state.  Strong suspicions 
or even strong probabilities of guilt are not sufficient; there must be a clear showing fully satisfying the minds of the 
court that respondent was guilty as charged.  State ex inf. Crow v. Continental Tobacco Co., 177 Mo. 1, 75 S.W. 
737; State ex rel. Taylor v. Anderson, 254 S.W. (2d) 609.  (3) The evidence establishes no violation of the Missouri 
anti-trust laws.  The commissioner correctly construed the term ""understanding"" as that term is used in the Missouri 
anti-trust laws.  United States v. United Shoe Machinery Co., 234 Fed. 127; 82 C.J.S., Statutes, Sec. 331; 50 Am. 
Jur., Statutes, Sec. 247.  (4) The suggestion of resale prices and the refusal to deal with those who refused to 
follow the suggested prices is not illegal.  United States v. Colgate & Co., 253 Fed. 522, affirmed, 250 U.S. 300; 
Frey & Son, Inc. v. Cudahy Packing Co., 261 Fed. 65, affirmed, 256 U.S. 208; Adams-Mitchell Co. v. Cambridge

lawful.  Cream of Wheat Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 14 F. (2d) 40; Toledo Pipe Threading Mach. Co. v. 
Federal Trade Commission, 11 F. (2d) 337; United States v. Hudnut, 8 F. (2d) 1010; Harriet Hubbard Ayer, Inc. v. 
Federal Trade Commission, 15 F. (2d) 274.  (6) The evidence fails to establish that the suggestion of resale prices 
by Miles resulted in price fixing.  United States v. U.S. Steel Corp., 251 U.S. 417; State v. American Ins. Co., 355 
Mo. 1053, 200 S.W. (2d) 1; State ex rel. Taylor v. Anderson, 254 S.W. (2d) 609.  (7) The Missouri anti-trust laws are 
subject to judicial construction.  Chicago Board of Trade v. United States, 246 U.S. 231; State ex rel. Kimbrell v. 
People's Ice Storage & Fuel Co., 246 Mo. 168, 151 S.W. 101; State ex rel. Barrett v. Boeckler Lumber Co.,  [***12]  
301 Mo. 445, 256 S.W. 175.  (8) Resale price maintenance agreements are valid under the common law in 
Missouri.  Clark v. Frank, 17 Mo. App. 602; 51 Harv. L. Rev. 336.  (9) Resale price maintenance agreements are 
valid under the common law of most other jurisdictions.  Fisher Flouring Mills Co. v. Swanson, 76 Wash. 649, 137 
Pac. 144; Grogan v. Chaffee, 156 Cal. 611, 105 Pac. 745; Walsh v. Dwight, 40 App. Div. 513, 58 N.Y.S. 91; D.

Natl. Wholesale Druggists' Assn., 175 N.Y. 1, 67 N.E. 136.  (10) The Missouri anti-trust laws condemn only 
combinations among competitors absent a monopoly.  State ex inf. Hadley v. Standard Oil Co., 177 Mo. 1, 75 S.W. 
737; International Harvester Co. v. Missouri, 234 U.S. 199; Fisher Flouring Mills Co. v. Swanson, 76 Wash. 649,

Becker, 300 S.W. 1108; Standard Fireproofing Co. v. St. Louis Fireproofing Co., 177 Mo. 559, 76 S.W. 1008.  (11) 
Most other jurisdictions have held resale price maintenance agreements to be outside the purview of their anti-trust 
statutes.  Old Dearborn Distributing Co. v. Seagram Distillers Corp., 299 U.S. 183; Commonwealth v. Grinstead, 
111 Ky. 203, 63 S.W. 427; Miles Laboratories v. Owl Drug Co., 67 S.D. 523, 295 N.W. 292; Munter v. Eastman
