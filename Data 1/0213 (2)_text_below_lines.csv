36,1," HN1[
] - Section 103 of Title 35 reads: Conditions for patentability - Non-obvious subject matter. - A patent may not be obtained though the invention is not 
identically disclosed or described as set forth in section 102 of this title, if the differences between the subject matter sought 
to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the 
invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains. Patentability shall not 
be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made. "
37,2," The old Bank building was built in 1907 upon relatively shallow timber pilings. The Bank wanted to preserve the old building, 
but needed to build the new building close to it."
37,3," The term ""secant"" wall derives from the intersecting circular sections of concrete columns which result in this method of wall 
construction."
37,4," The original patent application, Serial No. 418,778, was filed on December 16, 1964. This application was abandoned in favor 
of Continuation-in-Part Application Serial No. 682,763, filed November 14, 1967. "
38,5," The complaint charged defendants with patent infringement by using the patented process at the St. Francis Hotel Towers in 
San Francisco.  Defendant P & Z had used it in Omaha and Baltimore as well. Degenkolb had recommended its use on several 
other California projects."
38,6," Bentonite slurries are thixotropic mixtures which form a gel-like substance in the quiescent state, but which become fluid or 
liquid when shaken, stirred or otherwise disturbed. When the disturbance ceases they return to the more solid, gel-like state."
38,7," ""Tremie"" concrete generally refers to the apparatus for depositing and consolidating concrete under water or very damp 
conditions."
38,8," Testimony of Dr. John A. Blume described how this arch action alters the stresses upon the concrete slab. Assuming one unit 
of pressure from the unexcavated soil, the presence of arch action transmits these lateral pressures toward the edges of the slab 
so that at the H beam flange junction of concrete and steel the forces are equal to 4.5 units of pressure. Yet, at the same time, 
the forces on the outside of the slab, opposite to the unexcavated soil, have been reduced to as little as 0.02 units of pressure. "
39,9," During excavation it is necessary to cross brace the wall. As excavation progresses portions of the wall, below the bracing will 
tend first to bend away from the excavation, but then, as excavation proceeds below the bracing, will bend toward the 
excavation."
39,10," A Memorandum of Decision on the issue of patent validity was filed on June 28, 1973. At a hearing on May 30, 1975 the court 
adopted detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law prepared by the defendants, and these were filed on June 4, 1975."
39,11," The defendants presented the court with nearly 50 separate prior art references in their attempt to demonstrate the 
obviousness of the patented process. "
40,12," A cut-off wall is a subterranean wall built to prevent the movement of water under the ground. No excavation follows 
construction so the principal concern is not structural strength or rigidity but watertightness."
40,13, Section 282 of Title 35 reads in pertinent part: 
41,," A patent shall be presumed valid. Each claim of a patent (whether in independent or dependent form) shall be presumed 
valid independently of the validity of other claims; dependent claims shall be presumed valid even though dependent upon 
an invalid claim. The burden of establishing invalidity of a patent or any claim thereof shall rest on the party asserting it."
41,14," For example, some methods require excavation prior to construction of the wall, others entail excavation after construction, 
and some never require excavation. "
42,15," We note also that Ewen may well have been considered but not cited by the examiner since the Booth patent, which he did 
cite, referred to Ewen."
42,16," In the Doughty process the lateral forces are transmitted by arch action toward the flanges of the H beams which, because of 
the shear strength of steel, are able to hold the slabs together in a compression interlock. In contrast, in all the secant wall 
processes, including Miotti, the lateral forces would be resisted only by the small concrete edges of the concavity which 
intersects and overlaps with the adjacent columns. Because of the relative weakness of concrete in shear, too much lateral 
pressure during excavation would cause breakage of those small overlapping edges of concrete. "
43,17," Caplan, a member of the patent bar, was admittedly unskilled in the art and based his testimony upon the disclosures in the 
patent documents, not upon any training or experience in engineering. He acknowledged during his testimony that he knew little 
about the arch action described in the Doughty claims. This testimony is of questionable value in overcoming the presumptive 
validity of the patent. See generally Woodstream Corp. v. Herter's Inc., 446 F.2d 1143, 1157 (8 Cir. 1971)."
43,18," Substitution of steel beams for the initial concrete piles would not produce arch action as long as the concrete poured between 
those beams was still essentially in the form of cylindrical columns. Of course, Miotti did describe a more rectilinear concrete 
slab to intersect the first poured cylindrical, structural columns so, arguably, substitution of steel could lead to arch action there. 
We do not believe, however, that the teachings of Miotti would lead one to substitute steel for concrete in that process because 
Miotti's principal concern was an apparatus for digging the rectilinear trench with concave ends to overlap with the concrete 
columns. That apparatus, or digging tool, would be totally ineffective and non-functional if steel beams were used in place of the 
concrete. Thus it appears unlikely that a person skilled in the art of Miotti would make such a substitution. "
45,19," Ewen, unlike Doughty and unlike the secant type walls of Veder, Falciola, Miotti and Degenkolb, required that excavation 
occur prior to construction of the wall. His patent described how the excavation could take place and how the wall could then be 
constructed, free-standing, within the excavated trench."
45,20," As noted supra, under Ewen the excavation occurs prior to construction of the wall. The Doughty wall is completed before the 
excavation begins."
45,21," This belief among the engineering profession would tend to reduce the value of the teachings of Ewen regarding a concrete 
slab and steel beam foundation wall. The Ewen patent showed such a wall, but it was constructed with traditional, not tremie, "
46,," concrete and dry steel in a previously excavated trench. A person with ordinary skill in the art would have to ignore the expected 
bonding problems to arrive at the Doughty wall process from the teachings of Ewen."
46,22," Armento testified that ""one has to wonder if the concrete that's poured later will bond very tightly against this H-member so that 
we don't get water coming in through what might be a weak plane between the concrete and the steel. . . ."" He said that ""it 
wasn't until the Bank of California was fully excavated that we were able to see whether this process really worked or was a - 
was a dream"". HN7[
]"
46,23," Degenkolb, Moore and Pavlow's response to the need to strengthen the secant type wall they proposed was to increase the 
amount of reinforcing in the concrete columns. This response belies their testimony that substitution of steel beams was an 
obvious and simple matter of an engineering choice among all available building materials. If that were so they would have 
chosen the steel from the beginning, but they did not.  Their response is exactly the same as Armento testified would be the 
response of one with ordinary skill in the art in 1963-1964: to make the concrete more massive and add reinforcement in all of 
the columns, not just in alternating ones."
46,24," A method called the Benoto caisson and secant wall process was included in the BARTD report. The report carefully 
described and analyzed the values of the secant wall of overlapping concrete columns. "
47,25," In reversing we recognize that there are minor variations within the claims, three of which, for instance, do not refer to arch 
action and one, claim 1, which does not require steel H beams. It is clear, however, from the summary and specifications that 
arch action was crucial to all the claims and the use of steel H beams was the preferred embodiment of the process. Moreover, 
we conclude that claims 5-8 contain all of the elements necessary to make Doughty's process non-obvious and, therefore, 
establish appellant's proprietary right to it. Any alleged deficiencies in the other claims at issue would be moot."
47,26," Claim 9 describes a ""wall construction for providing lateral support to unexcavated earth bearing against one side thereof 
where earth has been excavated away from the other side""."
47,27," The license provided for a nominal royalty of $1,000 per BARTD station, to be waived if Gerwick was low bidder. "
48,28," P & Z claims that Santa Fe, pursuant to the license agreement, obtained two patents on improvements to the Doughty process 
- P.J. York United States Patent No.  3,530,676 issued on September 29, 1970 and P.J.  York 3,555,830 issued on January 19, 
1971. The grant-back provision was cancelled by letter to BARTD dated March 19, 1970."
48,29," HN9[
] Section 1 of the Sherman Act reads in pertinent part: Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the 
several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal . . . .  15 U.S.C. § 1. Section 2 of the Sherman Act reads in pertinent part: Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any person or persons, to 
monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of 
a felony. . . .  15 U.S.C. § 2 . "
49,30," With respect to the substantive issues, the inquiry is ""whether [GERWICK] participated in anticompetitive conduct of the kind 
encompassed within the statutory terms 'restraint of trade', 'monopolize', or 'attempt to monopolize'."" Gough, 487 F.2d at 376."
49,31," Defendant P & Z is engaged in foundation construction throughout the United States and apparently has used something akin 
to the Doughty process on projects in Nebraska and Maryland. "
50,32," In the light of TransWrap, we find the tie-in cases cited by the defendants inapposite. HN12[
] A tie-in ""may be defined as an 
agreement by a party to sell one product but only on the condition that the buyer purchases a different (or tied) product. . . ."" 
Northern Pac. Ry. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5, 78 S. Ct. 514, 518, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1958). We agree with the district 
court that ""the BARTD license agreement with its grant-back provision was not and could not have been a tying agreement. . . ."""
50,33," One project, the Embarcadero Station, specified the Doughty method because of the extreme instability of the soil there."
50,34," Although grant-back clauses arguably can have the effect of stifling the incentive to invent, ""it is, in fact, not impossible for a 
licensee to make an improvement in the licensed invention that would commercially displace the latter in whole or in part and 
thereby impair the value of the original invention. . . . In relation to the licensee the licensor is entitled to some protection for its 
original investment in research and. . . a grant back is a reasonable device through which to seek such protection."" 2 Nordhaus 
& Jurow, Patent-Antitrust Law, 58-3."
50,35," With the exception of an improved, faster method for digging the rectilinear trench, devised by P & Z, defendants presented no 
evidence of improvements which might have been made had the grant-back not existed, and that one exception seems to be of 
doubtful patentability. No improvements ever were granted back or ""funneled"" to the licensor because of the license provision. "
51,36," This would seem to belie any suggestion of anti-competitive motivation on the part of the licensor, Gerwick."
51,37," In TransWrap the Court stated: By reason of the agreement any improvement patent can be put to immediate use and exploited for the account of the 
licensee. And that benefit continues so long as the agreement is renewed. The agreement thus serves a function of 
supplying a market for the improvement patents. Whether that opportunity to exploit the improvement patents would be 
increased but for the agreement depends on vicissitudes of business too conjectural on this record to appraise."
51,38," While the record appears to support a finding of infringement, we decline to consider that issue for the first time on appeal.

job site of the construction, alteration or repair of a building, structure, or other work to any person or proprietor who is not 
signatory to this Agreement, the employer shall require such subcontractor to be bound to all the provisions of this 
Agreement, or such employer shall maintain daily records of the subcontractors employees job site hours, and be liable for 
payment of these employees wages, travel, Health-Welfare and Dental, Pension, Vacation and Apprenticeship 
contributions in accordance with this Agreement. Three versions of the agreement covering three different time periods were admitted as evidence in this proceeding.  The 1968-
71 version used the term ""contractor"" instead of ""employer"" throughout the document; the 1968-71 and 1971-73 agreements 
also contained a Construction Industry Advancement Fund contribution provision in article IV."
102,2," HN1[
] The Davis-Bacon Act, 40 USC § 276(a) et seq. (1970), requires payment of the wage rates prevailing in the locality on 
all construction projects to which the United States is a party. Although defendant resists payments for work done by a number of nonsignatory subcontractors, it only claims that one of these 
subcontractors worked on a project covered by the Davis-Bacon Act."
102,3," HN2[
] 15 USC §§ 1-2 (Supp V 1975).  Section 1 prohibits contracts ""in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States""; section 2 makes it unlawful to ""monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or 
persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States."""
102,4," A recent review of the evolution of the Supreme Court's efforts to accommodate the national antitrust and labor laws is 
contained in St. Antoine, Connell: Antitrust Law at the Expense of Labor Law, 62 Va L Rev 603 (1976)."
102,5," HN3[
] 29 USC § 158(e) (1970) provides in part: "
103,," It shall be an unfair labor practice for any labor organization and any employer to enter into any contract or agreement, 
express or implied, whereby such employer ceases or refrains or agrees to cease or refrain from handling, using, selling, 
transporting or otherwise dealing in any of the products of any other employer, or to cease doing business with any other 
person, and any contract or agreement entered into heretofore or hereafter containing such an agreement shall be to such 
extent unenforcible and void: Provided, That nothing in this subsection shall apply to an agreement between a labor 
organization and an employer in the construction industry relating to the contracting or subcontracting of work to be done at 
the site of the construction, alteration, painting, or repair of a building, structure, or other work. . . . "
104,6," Local 189, Amalgamated Meat Cutters v. Jewel Tea Co., 381 U.S. 676 (1965). In Pennington a coal mine operator resisted payments into a trust fund established under a 1950 agreement between the United 
Mine Workers and the major coal mine operators in which the UMW agreed to accept mechanization of the mines and to 
abandon other traditional objectives in return for a rising wage scale and increased royalty payments into a union welfare fund.  
The Supreme Court held that a claim under the Sherman Act had been made out by the protesting operator's allegations that the 
union and the large operators had agreed to reduce overproduction of coal by eliminating smaller companies, that the terms of 
the agreement were to be imposed on all operators, that the signatory companies would not lease coal lands to nonunion 
operators, and (later) that they would not sell or buy coal to or from such companies.  381 U.S. at 660. In Jewel Tea an unsuccessful antitrust attack was leveled against an agreement between the union and a trade association that 
limited the hours when retail stores could sell fresh meat.  There was no opinion for the Court, but Justice White, who wrote for 
the Court in Pennington, distinguished that case because there was evidence that the restraint on night sales was intimately 
related to the butchers' hours and working conditions, a mandatory subject of collective bargaining under 29 USC 158(d), rather 
than an effort to restrict the ""self-service"" market in meat."
104,7," HN4[
] 29 USC § 158(d) (1970) provides in part: For the purposes of this section, to bargain collectively is the performance of the mutual obligation of the employer and the 
representative of the employees to meet at reasonable times and confer in good faith with respect to wages, hours, and 
other terms and conditions of employment, or the negotiation of an agreement, or any question arising thereunder, and the 
execution of a written contract incorporating any agreement reached if requested by either party, but such obligation does 
not compel either party to agree to a proposal or require the making of a concession. . . . "
105,8," Connell is not really a holding on the point, since the Court found the agreement in that case to go beyond the proviso. The 
legislative history supporting the position that Congress rejected use of the antitrust laws against union ""secondary"" activities is 
reviewed by the dissenters in Connell, 421 U.S. at 639-655. But their view of the labor exemption from the antitrust laws 
extended to forbidden practices as well as to those exempt from section 8(e)."
105,9," A federal court of appeals considered the present clause valid as being ""less coercive"" than a clause disqualifying any 
subcontractor who was delinquent in payments to similar trust funds, which the court invalidated under section 8(e).  See Griffith 
Co. v. NLRB, 545 F2d 1194, 1203 n. 14 (9th Cir 1976), cert. denied, 98 S Ct 171 (1977). The provision might also be described as a ""union standards"" clause like the clause sustained against section 8(e) in Truck 
Drivers Local 413 v. NLRB, 334 F2d 539, 548 (DC Cir), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 916 (1964). The Court of Appeals there wrote: This Board position groups together, as secondary, contract clauses which impose boycotts on subcontractors not 
signatory to union agreements, and those which merely require subcontractors to meet the equivalent of union standards in 
order to protect the work standards of the employees of the contracting employer.  But the distinction between these two 
types of clauses is vital.  Union-signatory subcontracting clauses are secondary, and therefore within the scope of § 8(e), 
while union-standards subcontracting clauses are primary as to the contracting employer.  [Citations.] This clause would be a union-signatory clause if it required subcontractors to have collective bargaining agreements with 
petitioner unions or their affiliates, or with unions generally.  We interpret it, however, as merely requiring that "
106,," subcontractors observe the equivalent of union wages, hours, and the like.  Since we find that this clause only requires 
union standards, and not union recognition, we follow the line of cases in this court cited above to rule it primary, and thus 
outside § 8(e)'s prohibitions. The concept of a ""union standards"" subcontracting clause has been approved in federal cases since Pennington.  See, e.g., 
NLRB v. National Maritime Union, 486 F2d 907, 912 (2d Cir 1973), cert. denied, 416 U.S. 970 (1974)."
106,10," In these respects the subcontracting clause, both as written and as challenged in defendant's allegations, differs from the 
clauses held vulnerable under the Sherman Act in Morse Bros. v. Operating Engineers Local 701, Civil No. 71-515 (D Or Oct 3, 
1974)."
106,11," A typical clause in one of these trust fund agreements provides: If any individual employer defaults in the making of such payments and if the Board consults legal counsel with respect 
thereto, or files any suit or claim with respect thereto, there shall be added to the obligation of the employer who is in 
default, reasonable attorney's fees, court costs and all other reasonable expenses incurred by the Board in connection with 
such suit or claim, including any and all appellate proceedings therein. The attorney fees apparently were allocated to the various funds proportionately to the amounts recovered by each fund. "

Division of Consumer Affairs, ex officio, or his or her designee.  N.J.S.A. 45:9A-3. "
126,2," The effective date of the hearing aid regulations was originally scheduled to be August 15, 1977; their effective date was stayed 
by the FDA until August 25, 1977 as a result of litigation challenging the validity of the regulations, American Speech & Hearing 
Association v. Califano, Civil No. 77-1327, United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  See 42 Fed. Reg. 40215 
(August 9, 1977).  The regulations were ultimately upheld by Judge Gerhard Gesell on December 19, 1977."
126,3," FDCA § 521, 21 U.S.C. § 360k, provides: HN10[
] State and local requirements respecting devices -- General rule (a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, no State or political subdivision of a State may establish or continue in 
effect with respect to a device intended for human use any requirement -- (1) which is different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable under this chapter to the device, and (2) which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to 
the device under this chapter. Exempt requirements (b) Upon application of a State or a political subdivision thereof, the Secretary may, by regulation promulgated after notice and 
opportunity for an oral hearing, exempt from subsection (a) of this section, under such conditions as may be prescribed in such 
regulation, a requirement of such State or political subdivision applicable to a device intended for human use if -- "
127,," (1) the requirement is more stringent that a requirement under this chapter which would be applicable to the device if an 
exemption were not in effect under this subsection; or (2) the requirement -- (A) is required by compelling local conditions and (B) compliance with the requirement would not cause the device to be in violation of any applicable requirement under 
this chapter."
127,4," Public comments on these proposed regulations were to be submitted by August 15, 1977, with the final regulations to become 
effective 60 days after publication in the Federal Register; as of this date, they have not yet been published in final form.  On 
October 18, 1977, the FDA said that applications for preemption exemptions would be processed in accordance with the 
proposed regulations. See 42 Fed. Reg. 55648-49 (October 18, 1977)."
127,5," Although the opinion letter of the FDA Chief Counsel is not a formal FDA advisory opinion as to the preemption vel non of state 
or local device requirements as contemplated by proposed 21 C.F.R. § 808.5, to our knowledge that opinion letter has not been 
challenged nor repudiated.  We therefore assume for purposes of this opinion that this constitutes the current position of the 
FDA."
127,6," As of this date, the FDA has not granted the State's request for an exemption from preemption with respect to N.J.A.C. 13:35-
8.24(e). "
130,7," N.J.A.C. 13:35-8.24(k)(4) provides: HN22[
] A retail charge for services and equipment referred to in paragraph 2 of this subsection of greater than three 
times the price initially charged to the dispenser for the hearing aid itself by a hearing aid manufacturer may be deemed 
evidence of overreaching and fraud in the sale of a hearing aid. This section shall not, however, be construed to set a 
maximum or minimum allowable fee. "
136,8," We note that the FDA has formally stated its view that trade regulations proposed by the Federal Trade Commission governing 
hearing aid industry sales practices, see 40 Fed. Reg. 26646-51 (June 24, 1975), portions of which are substantially identical to 
several provisions of the Committee regulations, ""* * * complement, rather than conflict with [the] FDA regulations relating to 
labeling and conditions of sale of hearing aids."" See 42 Fed. Reg. 9286 (February 15, 1977) (comment to proposed 21 C.F.R. § 
801.420, 421).  As of this date, the FTC rules have not been finally promulgated and their effect, if any, on the Committee 
regulations is not an issue in this case. "
157,1," From what has already been stated, it should be apparent that the Court would have found hydraulic dredging a distinct line of 
commerce. However, hydraulic dredging was not defined as a relevant line of commerce, because generally a line of commerce 
is relevant to a case because it is a product market in which both companies engage; here the evidence showed that Weeks "
158,," was not engaged in the hydraulic dredging business.  Even though a company is not a competitor in a product market, that 
product market can be relevant if the evidence shows that the company is a potential competitor in the market.  Under the 
potential competitor doctrine, hydraulic would be relevant if it was shown that Weeks, independently of its acquisition of 
American, was so situated in the hydraulic dredging industry as to be a potential competitor likely to exercise substantial 
influence on the hydraulic dredging market behavior.  United States v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., 410 U.S. 526, 35 L. Ed. 2d 475, 
93 S. Ct. 1096 (1973). Although there was testimony revealing that Weeks had an interest in entering the hydraulic dredging 
market, the evidence did not establish that, without the American acquisition, Weeks had the ""characteristics, capabilities and 
economic incentive to render it a perceived potential de novo entrant"" likely to affect the behavior of existing participants in the 
hydraulic market.  United States v. Marine Bancorporation, 418 U.S. 602, 625, 41 L. Ed. 2d 978, 94 S. Ct. 2856 (1974). To even 
purchase an hydraulic dredge would have cost Weeks in the neighborhood of $15 to $18 million, an amount Weeks did not 
appear willing to spend.  Therefore, the Court concluded that the potential competitor doctrine was inapplicable, and that the 
only relevant product market was bucket dredging. "
160,2," Although American competed on the Gulf Coast for dredging jobs, the Gulf Coast was not considered as a relevant geographic 
market.  The testimony presented showed that almost all work performed on the Gulf Coast was hydraulic dredging. As hydraulic 
dredging had been determined not to be a relevant line of commerce, the Gulf Coast could not be designated a relevant 
geographic area.  In addition, the testimony presented established that Weeks did not compete in the Gulf Coast. "

Carnation Co. v. Pacific Westbound Conference, 383 U.S. 213, 15 L. Ed. 2d 709, 86 S. Ct. 781 (1966). Further, it is doubtful that 
they could successfully do so.  See, U.S. v. AT&T Co., 427 F. Supp. 57, 59 (D.D.C. 1976); and Federal Communications Act of 
1934, 47 U.S.C. §§ 221(a), 222(C)(1)."
182,3," See, U.S. v. Western Pacific R. Co., 352 U.S. 59, 63-64, 1 L. Ed. 2d 126, 77 S. Ct. 161 (1956). "
183,4," We need not decide, and accordingly do not address, whether a potential rather than an existing conflict is sufficient to provide 
the requisite repugnancy. Compare, Otter Tail, supra, 410 U.S. at pp. 376-77 with Gordon, supra, 422 U.S. at pp. 690-91 and 
Carnation Co. v. Pacific Westbound Conference, supra, 383 U.S. at pp. 220-21. "
184,5," We will assume, arguendo, that such activity violated the antitrust laws. "
185,6," However, under that section if the proposed tariff is an ""increased charge"", the FCC may require the carrier to keep an 
accounting of the amounts received so that refunds can be paid if the tariff is disapproved. "
188,7," Indeed, the agency has specifically stated that the issue of liability (and retroactive effect) has yet to be determined.  Western 
States Telephone Co. v. ATT, et al. (FCC Docket No. 16883), Memorandum Opinion and Order FCC-77-655 (Sept. 27, 1977)."
188,8," Judge McGown, in Department Store Union, supra, 466 F.2d at p. 390, concisely stated five factors to be balanced in this 
determination: HN13[
] ""(1) whether the particular case is one of first impression, (2) whether the new rule represents an abrupt 
departure from well established practice or merely attempts to fill a void in an unsettled area of law, (3) the extent to which "
189,," the party against whom the new rule is applied relied on the former rule, (4) the degree of the burden which a retroactive 
order imposes on a party, and (5) the statutory interest in applying a new rule despite the reliance of a party on the old 
standard."" However, the peculiar posture of this case requires that we deviate slightly from this list."
189,9," In the First Report the Commission notes that at the time the tariffs were filed, the carriers had failed to meet the Carterfone 
burden of establishing a risk of harm to the network for every device with restricted use under the tariff. This deficiency was 
equally apparent in 1968 when the agency declined to suspend the tariffs. Had the agency been able in 1968 to clearly define 
which equipment posed a risk of harm, it could have implemented its registration program at that time.  The FCC apparently 
lacked the ability to do so.  It would be inequitable to castigate the carriers for their failure to do that which the Commission itself 
could not do.  Accordingly, that deficiency cannot justify a retroactive ruling. Essential attempts to impute to ATT early and full notice of the unlawfulness of its post-Carterfone tariffs based upon 
correspondence from the FCC Common Carrier Bureau, dated December 16, 1971.  Suffice it to say that the Bureau did not 
have the authorization to make, nor did the letter represent, an official pronouncement of FCC policy. "
190,10," It might be argued that allowing damage recovery by suppliers of CPTE whose market activity was ""stunted"" by the post-
Carterfone tariffs would indirectly benefit network subscribers by providing expansion capital for CPTE production.  However, 
this effect is at best remote and speculative.  If the CPTE market is not sufficiently profitable to attract expansion capital on its 
own merit, it is extremely unlikely that any damages collected from ATT would be invested in that market."
190,11," In this respect, we find it significant that the FCC postponed the effective date of the Carterfone decision until the date the 
post-Carterfone tariffs were to take effect.  See, 15 FCC 2d 31."
190,12," In deciding this motion, the court has used care in seeking guidance from cases, such as Cantor, supra, dealing with the State 
Action doctrine.  Facially that doctrine is similar to implied immunity. However, whereas the first resolves conflict between two 
policy formulators of different competence, the second resolves conflict between different policies of a single formulator.  Thus, 
the actual analysis under the two doctrines may differ significantly. Cf., Cantor, supra, at pp. 595-97. "
191,13," See, Gordon v. N.Y.S.E., supra, 422 U.S. at pp. 688-689. "
192,14," But see, U.S. v. RCA, supra 358 U.S. at pp. 348-49 where the Court contrasted the regulation of broadcasters under the 
Communications Act (held not to be a ""pervasive regulatory scheme"") with the regulation of wire common carriers."
192,15," But see, U.S. v. RCA, supra, at pp. 339-46; FCC v. RCA Communications, Inc., 346 U.S. 86, 97 L. Ed. 1470, 73 S. Ct. 998 
(1956); U.S. v. ATT Co., 427 F. Supp. 51, 61 (D.D.C. 1976), cert. den., 429 U.S. 1071, 97 S. Ct. 824, 50 L. Ed. 2d 799 (1977) 
and Macom Products Corp. v. ATT Co., 359 F. Supp. 973, 976 (C.D. Cal. 1973)."
192,16," See U.S. v. NASD, supra. "
196,*," Judge Smith having requested that he be relieved of any consideration of this appeal, this decision is rendered solely by 
Judges Moore and Mansfield, who are in agreement, pursuant to the Rules of this Court, § 0.14(b). "
197,1," In addition to Nabcor the appellants are (1) Frank Maiorana, its president and a principal shareholder; (2) Anthony Maiorana, 
vice president of Nabcor and a principal shareholder; (3) Alfred J. Young, Sr., a Nabcor broker; (4) Ralph Ajello, administrator of 
the estate of E. Louis Jamele, also a broker; and (5) Nabcor of East New York, Inc., a Nabcor ""master broker."" Dale Strimple 
and his corporation, General Auto Sales & Leasing, Inc., a master broker, have stipulated to the dismissal of their appeals.  
Given our disposition of this case, we need not decide which of the above parties have standing under § 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 
U.S.C. § 15, to bring this action. See generally Billy Baxter, Inc. v. Coca-Cola Co., 431 F.2d 183 (2d Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401 
U.S. 923, 27 L. Ed. 2d 826, 91 S. Ct. 877 (1971)."
197,2," In addition to GM the appellees are (1) a subsidiary, General Motors Acceptance Corp.; (2) high-level GM officials Frederic G. 
Donner and James M. Roche; (3) a number of franchised GM dealers, Bob Bain Chevrolet, Paul Batt Buick, Inc., Glen Campbell 
Chevrolet, Inc., Hamister-Gillogly Chevrolet, Inc., and Paragon Oldsmobile, Inc.; and (4) an organization of dealers, the Niagara 
Frontier Automobile Dealers Association, Inc."
197,3," Originally, this suit was brought as a class action. Judge Griesa has since denied the suit class action status and has severed it 
into four parts. The subject of this appeal, the case involving the GM-related defendants, is the first of the four to go to trial."
197,4," When Nabcor first went into business, its system consisted of two levels - Nabcor itself and its brokers. Later, however, Nabcor 
reorganized and began selling intermediate ""master broker"" and ""area broker"" franchises as well. Master brokers were assigned 
some of the responsibility for procuring cars. In order to simplify our discussion, we will not distinguish between Nabcor and its 
higher-level franchises unless the distinction is relevant to the issues being discussed. "
198,5," Two key exhibits bearing on the boycott issues are PX 450, which attempts to trace Nabcor's orders based on its order log, and 
PX 699, which summarizes the alleged refusals to deal with Nabcor and problems with deliveries that Nabcor claimed were the 
result of a boycott. PX 699, which summarized the alleged refusals to deal with Nabcor, indicates only two unexplained unfilled 
orders after June 1, 1967. It was during this later period that some GM employees allegedly made their hostile statements in the 
presence of the Maioranas. Nabcor contended that in the fall of 1966 it received orders for forty-five 1967 Cadillacs, and placed forty-three of the orders with 
Colonial Cadillac of Trenton, N.J. Two witnesses from Colonial Cadillac denied any knowledge of the orders and its records 
show no such orders.  Nabcor, moreover, had no record of any such orders. "
199,6," Appellants introduced evidence showing that high-level GM management was made aware of the activities of Nabcor, but did 
not offer any competent evidence demonstrating that any action was taken by GM to persuade dealers to refrain from dealing 
with Nabcor."
199,7," Appellants presented some evidence that was admissible against some of the dealer appellees, but not against GM, with a 
view to showing that the dealers had conspired against Nabcor. Nevertheless, appellants did not present a prima facie case 
even against these appellees. First, Frank Maiorana testified that officials of appellee Paragon Oldsmobile told him that GM employees had instructed Paragon 
not to sell to Nabcor. However, even if Paragon's acquiescence in such an order was sufficient to make the dealer a conspirator, 
there was no evidence that Nabcor was injured as a result; uncontradicted evidence indicates that it never had difficulty 
obtaining Oldsmobiles from some source. Second, regarding the Buffalo area, representatives of a Nabcor master broker, General Auto Sales & Leasing Co., recounted 
hearsay statements suggesting that GM personnel and dealers were communicating their hostility to the Nabcor system to one 
another. In addition, an organization of Buffalo-area dealers, then known as the Buffalo Automobile Dealers Association, 
distributed a bulletin describing Nabcor in unfavorable terms and implying that dealers should not get involved with it. But 
Nabcor's success in purchasing cars in the Buffalo area would have precluded any reasonable jury from finding liability based on 
a dealer conspiracy. Moreover, General Auto Sales & Leasing has stipulated to the dismissal of its appeal from the judgment 
below and the remaining appellants have failed to show any injury resulting from these events."
199,8," This section provides: ""Whenever a party to any proceeding in a district court makes and files a timely and sufficient affidavit that the judge before 
whom the matter is pending has a personal bias or prejudice either against him or in favor of any adverse party, such judge 
shall proceed no further therein, but another judge shall be assigned to hear such proceeding. "
200,," ""The affidavit shall state the facts and the reasons for the belief that bias or prejudice exists, and shall be filed not less than 
ten days before the beginning of the term at which the proceeding is to be heard, or good cause shall be shown for failure 
to file it within such time. A party may file only one such affidavit in any case. It shall be accompanied by a certificate of 
counsel of record stating that it is made in good faith."""
200,9," The provision applicable to this action provides: ""HN4[
] Any justice or judge of the United States shall disqualify himself in any case in which he has a substantial interest, 
has been of counsel, is or has been a material witness, or is so related to or connected with any party or his attorney as to 
render it improper, in his opinion, for him to sit on the trial, appeal, or other proceeding therein."" An amendment of § 455 applicable to cases filed on December 5, 1974 or thereafter, see Act of Dec. 5, 1974, Pub. L. 93-512, § 
3, 88 Stat. 1610, makes it clear that disqualification is not required unless ""in private practice [the judge] served as lawyer in the 
matter in controversy, or a lawyer with whom he previously practiced law served during such association as a lawyer concerning 
the matter . . . ."" 28 U.S.C. § 455(b)(2) (Supp. V, 1975) (emphasis added). Even under the more stringent requirements of the 
current statute, therefore, the prior representations of GM by Davis Polk and Judge Griesa as to unrelated matters would not 
require him to recuse himself. "
201,10," Appellants attempt to characterize GM's allotment system as a restraint on resale prices. However, there was no evidence 
suggesting that this system was intended to control prices or that it had any such effect.  To the contrary, it appears that GM 
dealers were free to set the prices of cars they purchased from GM."
201,11," Although Continental T.V., Inc., supra, was not decided by the Supreme Court until after the conclusion of trial of the present 
case, we are bound to apply its principles rather than the earlier per se rule of Schwinn.  See Cort v. Ash, 422 U.S. 66, 74-77, 45 
L. Ed. 2d 26, 95 S. Ct. 2080 (1975). "
202,12," We have carefully considered appellants' contention that Judge Griesa improperly denied them answers to their so-called 
""communications interrogatories"" and find it to be completely without merit. "
206,1," The jury found Amstar not liable for attempted monopolization under § 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2. In addition, the jury 
found against Amstar on the special question directed at its defense that the brokerage payments constituted violations of § 2(c) 
of the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 13(c).  All other claims and counterclaims were withdrawn."
206,2," The Court denied from the bench plaintiffs' oral motions: for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a new trial on the § 2 
claim; for a directed verdict on pre-judgment damages on the § 1 claim and a new trial on the post-judgment damages on the § 1 
claim; and for an injunction compelling Amstar to reinstate Fuchs and Prael as general sugar brokers."
206,3," Therefore, resale price maintenance was not an issue in this case."
206,4," In order to do so, additional direct brokers and sales people were needed.  For this purpose, Amstar induced, for example, 
Kenneth L. Fox and George David Waller, to become direct brokers in the Midwest.  In addition, Joseph Gavin, formerly a Fuchs "
207,," vice president, joined Amstar after Fuchs was terminated in April of 1974 and thereafter called on customers previously serviced 
by Fuchs. "
208,5," In 1972, Amstar attempted to alter these incentives by offering the general brokers a Bonus Incentive Plan under which those 
brokers who effected sales at list price received an additional 3 cents/cwt commission, while those who sold at off-list received 
the usual commission of 9 1/2 cents/cwt."
208,6," In practice, however, general brokers did develop loyalties, whether based on friendships with employees at a particular 
refinery, or on practicalities such as the desirability of offering or being in a position to offer the products of a dominant and 
diversified refiner such as Amstar."
208,7," Private label brands are owned by the sugar purchaser, such as a chain store, rather than by the refiner. An example of a 
private label brand is Ann Page, owned by A & P. "
209,8," HN2[
] The Court notes that anti-competitive impact is judged in terms of a relevant market, not in terms of the adverse 
effects, if any, on the terminated brokers. See Burdett Sound, Inc. v. Altec Corp., 515 F.2d 1245, 1248 (5th Cir. 1975); Bushie v. 
Stenocord Corp., 460 F.2d 116, 119-20 (9th Cir. 1972). "
210,9," See also United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co., 388 U.S. 365, 378, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1249, 87 S. Ct. 1856 (1967), overruled in 
part on other grounds, Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 97 S. Ct. 2549, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568 (1977)."
210,10," Although whether the general brokers were ""agents"" is an issue with respect to the Robinson-Patman defense and is an 
implicit issue with respect to whether Amstar's attempts to control them was illegal under § 1 of the Sherman Act, it is not an 
issue with respect to whether or not they were capable of combining or conspiring.  In other words, Amstar does not contend, 
and rightly, that the general brokers lacked sufficient independence such that any conspiracy with them would have been intra-
corporate.  See Tamaron Distributing Corp. v. Weiner, supra, 418 F.2d at 139. "
211,11," Bowen relied on the often quoted language from Schwinn: [A manufacturer] may ""franchise"" certain dealers to whom, alone, he will sell his goods.  Cf.  United States v. Colgate & Co., 250 
U.S. 300, 63 L. Ed. 992, 39 S. Ct. 465 (1919). If the restraint stops at that point -- if nothing more is involved than vertical 
""confinement"" of the manufacturer's own sales of the merchandise to selected dealers, and if competitive products are readily 
available to others, the restriction, on these facts alone, would not violate the Sherman Act. United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co., 388 U.S. 365, 376, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1249, 87 S. Ct. 1856 (1967), overruled in part on other 
grounds, Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 97 S. Ct. 2549, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568 (1977) (emphasis added). "
212,12," Amstar has contended that this is not a refusal to deal case at all, as it has never refused to sell sugar to plaintiffs but has 
merely refused to compensate them for arranging sales of Amstar's sugar. It would seem that a refusal to deal must be a 
function of the capacity in which the parties dealt prior to the termination. Therefore, inasmuch as Amstar had never dealt with 
plaintiffs as sugar purchasers, it is not significant that Amstar has never refused to sell sugar to plaintiffs."
212,13," In connection with refusals to deal the courts have found to be ""arrangements restraining trade"" such practices as refusals to 
deal to eliminate price-cutting dealers, United States v. Parke, Davis & Co., [362 U.S. 29, 4 L. Ed. 2d 505, 80 S. Ct. 503 (1960)]; 
Klor's v. Broadway-Hale Stores, 359 U.S. 207, 79 S. Ct. 705, 3 L. Ed. 2d 741 (1958); to keep new competition out of a market, 
Radiant Burners, Inc. v. Peoples Gas, Light & Coke Co., 364 U.S. 656, 81 S. Ct. 365, 5 L. Ed. 2d 358 (1961); to enforce a tying 
arrangement, Lessig v. Tidewater Oil Co., 327 F.2d 459 (9th Cir. 1964); to create a monopoly in a product market, Poller v. 
Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 368 U.S. 464, 82 S. Ct. 486, 7 L. Ed. 2d 458 (1962), or to further strengthen an already 
dominant market position.  Eastman Kodak v. Southern Photo Materials Co., 273 U.S. 359, 47 S. Ct. 400, 71 L. Ed. 684 (1927). Bushie v. Stenocord Corp., 460 F.2d 116, 119 (9th Cir. 1972)."
212,14," E.g., Burdett Sound, Inc. v. Altec Corp., supra, 515 F.2d at 1248 (agreement, but no anti-competitive intent or effect); Bushie 
v. Stenocord Corp., supra, 460 F.2d at 120 (proof of and concession of agreement, but lack of anti-competitive purpose); Joseph 
E. Seagram & Sons, Inc. v. Hawaiian Oke & Liquors, Ltd., 416 F.2d 71, 78 (9th Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 1062, 24 L. Ed. 
2d 755, 90 S. Ct. 752 (1970) (went off not on lack of agreement but on lack of any evidence of anti-competitive motive for 
terminating and lack of proof of anti-competitive practices); Ace Beer Distributors, Inc. v. Kohn, Inc., 318 F.2d 283 (6th Cir.), cert. 
denied, 375 U.S. 922, 11 L. Ed. 2d 166, 84 S. Ct. 267 (1963) (went off on lack of anti-competitive motive or effect, not on lack of 
conspiracy). Amstar compares its offering some of the terminated general brokers positions as direct brokers to the situation in Bowen, supra, 
where the Second Circuit upheld a newspaper publisher's offering a franchise to some but not all of the independent carriers it 
was terminating.  Amstar's reliance on Bowen is misplaced, however, inasmuch as Bowen did not go off on the absence of 
combination or conspiracy, but on the absence of an anti-competitive purpose and effect.  Id. at 1252-53, 1254. The Court 
reasoned that when the defendant substituted exclusive franchisees for independent carriers who had previously sold not only 
defendant's newspapers but those of its competitors the substitution was not motivated by and would not have the effect of 
eliminating competition from other newspapers inasmuch as it was contemplated that the franchisees would sell, rather than 
abandon, their independent routes.  Id. at 1254. The instant case is directly to the contrary: the very purpose of inviting general 
brokers to become direct brokers was to prevent them from representing competing refiners. Amstar's reliance on Oreck Corp. v. Whirlpool Corp., 563 F.2d 54, 58 (2d Cir. 1977), is entirely misplaced as the narrow holding 
of that case -- that it was plain error to have in effect charged a per se rule in instructing the jury that the facts, if found to be true, 
would constitute a violation -- has no application to this case. "
214,15," In connection with Amstar's Robinson-Patman defense, the jury was charged in pertinent part as follows: This provision of the Robinson-Patman Act prohibits compensation by a seller to an agent, representative or other intermediary, 
if that agent is in fact acting on behalf of the purchaser. Now, merely because that agent provides incidental or supplementary services for the purchaser, such as tracking orders, 
placing orders, providing sales information and the like, does not mean that the agent is acting on behalf of the purchaser. So, if 
that is all that you find these plaintiffs did for purchasers, then it was legal for the seller, defendant, Amstar to pay them 
brokerage. However, if you find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that either or both plaintiffs in this case were acting 
primarily for the benefit of purchasers in attempting to reduce the price of sugar, rather than primarily for their own benefit in 
securing commissions, or primarily for the benefit of Amstar in securing the sale of Amstar's sugar, then you must find that that 
plaintiff or both plaintiffs in this action have violated the Robinson-Patman Act.  Amstar objected to the insertion of the words 
""rather than primarily for their own benefit in securing commissions."" "
215,16," Amstar urged that whether plaintiffs were in fact acting on behalf of customers was a question of law which must be resolved 
in its favor on the basis of certain inferences that could be drawn from Stipulations of Fact 18, 22, 35, 36, 37, and 39.  Suffice it 
to say that these stipulations are susceptible of more than one inference and therefore the question was properly left to the jury. Amstar also cited portions of the Federal Trade Commission's Trade Practice Rules for the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Industry, 
16 C.F.R. §§ 74 et seq., as indicative of how the issue must be resolved.  Even assuming that rules formulated on the basis of 
practices within the fruit and vegetable industry would have application to the sugar industry where practices, such as brokerage 
always being paid by the refiner, may be different, these rules merely set forth guidelines, not determinants.  The rules 
themselves emphasize that [in] determining whether a broker acts for a buyer or a seller, each transaction must be considered on its own facts.  A rule of 
general applicability can be helpful only in clarifying the pertinent legal principles and affording guidance to industry members in 
the application of these principles to particular situations.  16 C.F.R. § 74.2(c)(1)(ii)(c) Example No. 2."
215,17," The jury was asked: Do you find by a preponderance of the evidence that either plaintiff Fuchs Sugars & Syrups or plaintiff Francis J. Prael, 
doing business as Lewis & Company, or both, acted primarily for the benefit of purchasers in attempting to reduce the price 
of sugar rather than primarily for their own benefit in securing commissions, or primarily for the benefit of Amstar in securing 
the sale of Amstar sugar? The answer was negative as to both Fuchs and Prael."
215,18," The jury was entitled to take into account that Amstar knew that the marketing system it used (simultaneous representation of 
multiple refiners and compensation based on volume of sugar sold) was structured in accordance with the general broker's self-
interest.  Therefore, Amstar knew that the system dictated that the broker would be inherently adverse to the refiner and would 
have no inherent incentive to owe allegiance to any particular refiner. Based on this the jury could have found that the plaintiff 
general brokers were not merely agents of the multiple refiners they served, but were in fact intermediaries pursuing their own 
interest to the benefit of buyers and sellers and to the detriment of neither.  See In re Food Fair Stores, Inc., 83 F.T.C. 1213, 
1227 (1973) (decision of administrative law judge), modified [1973-1976] Trade Reg. Rep. (CCH) P 20,519 (F.T.C. 1974) 
(affirmed administrative law judge finding based on admission of complaint counsel that evidence complaint counsel intended to 
offer would not support finding that broker was acting for buyer).  Moreover, there was other evidence to support a finding that 
plaintiffs did not favor the purchaser's interest over the seller's interest.  For example, one of Amstar's own witnesses, Martin 
William Goldberg, Director of Grocery Purchasing for Wakefern Food Corporation, testified in answer to written interrogatories 
that ""In our judgment, no sugar brokers acted specifically in our interests at any time."""
215,19," Amstar contends that the charge and special jury question on this point purportedly made plaintiffs' motive relevant and that 
this was error inasmuch as there is nothing in the language or history of § 2(c) to suggest that motive is a factor.  The Court is of 
the opinion, however, that when it in effect asked the jury to distinguish between a buyer's agent, seller's agent or intermediary it 
was merely instructing the jury to look at the totality of the circumstances and base its finding with respect to plaintiffs' function 
and status on the realities of the situation. "
216,20," In re Food Fair Stores, Inc., supra at 1225-28; Tillie Lewis Foods, Inc. v. Flotill Products, Inc., 65 F.T.C. 1099, 1111, 1114 
(1963), aff'd, 65 F.T.C. 1131 (1964)."
216,21," See FTC v. Herzog, 150 F.2d 450, 451 (2d Cir. 1945); Biddle Purchasing Co. v. FTC, 96 F.2d 687, 691 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 
305 U.S. 634, 83 L. Ed. 407, 59 S. Ct. 101 (1938)."
216,22," In Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra, the brokers were agents of the buyer, rendered no services to the seller, and the 
unearned commissions paid them by the seller were passed on to the buyer as a ""quantity discount."" In Quality Bakers of 
America, supra, the seller paid brokerage to a corporation owned by and acting for the buyer. This buyer's agent did not actually 
render service to the seller and most of the unearned commissions were indirectly passed on to the buyer. In Biddle Purchasing 
Co. v. FTC, 96 F.2d 687 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 305 U.S. 634, 83 L. Ed. 407, 59 S. Ct. 101 (1938), which did not resolve the 
legality of one party's compensating an intermediary broker, the seller paid a broker under the buyer's control and acting as the 
buyer's agent, knowing that the commissions would be paid over to the buyer, thus giving the buyer a discount.  In FTC v. 
Herzog, 150 F.2d 450 (2d Cir. 1945), which again left open the question of the legality of compensating an intermediary, the 
brokers admitted in their answer that they acted as agents for fur garment retailers (buyers), they placed orders with 
manufacturers ""at 'the most advantageous price from the standpoint of the buyer,' [and] . . . other competitive retailers . . . 
['underwent] buying expense by maintaining buying offices, [retaining] the services of . . . ""fee"" buyers, or [sending] 
representatives to New York City to make fur garment purchases.' This [resulted] in a price discrimination in favor of the retailers 
who [did] business with the [brokers] . . .."" Id. at 452. FTC v. Henry Broch & Co., supra, likewise involved what the Court found to 
be an allowance in lieu of brokerage. "
217,23," Although Rangen, supra, denominated the malefactor (Grimes) in that case as ""other intermediary,"" it was for lack of a better 
description, since Grimes did not fit precisely into the category of ""agent"" or ""representative."" It is clear on the facts that Grimes 
was not an intermediary in the true sense of the word.  See 351 F.2d at 862."
217,24," The Fitch court observed that the ""acting in fact for or in behalf, or . . . subject to the direct or indirect control"" language in §

condemned by the act.  Since a broker would be an 'intermediary', legitimate brokerage would be included and made illegal 
unless such qualifying words were used.  The act catches such intermediaries as are acting for the buyer or under the buyer's 
control, without being an agent or representative in the legal sense of the word."" "

234,1," Plaintiff argues that defendant's claim of interference with economic expectancies must fail because defendant's damages are

Conn. 578, 584, 178 A. 121, 123 (1935), in which the court states that a claimant must be able to demonstrate the existence of 
damages capable of estimation with reasonable certainty.  Although neither party brought it to the Court's attention, it would 
seem that this argument has been restricted by the recent decision in Harry A. Finman & Son, Inc. v. Connecticut Truck & Trailer

41 (1).  That statute, in definitional language similar to that used in § 8 of the Sherman Act, makes it unlawful for ""any person,

to the transportation of any property in interstate or foreign commerce by any [covered] common carrier…."" (Emphasis added.) 
Kansas City, Kan. (hereinafter Kansas), decided to develop its Public Levee as a metropolitan rail food terminal with wholesale 
and retail produce markets.  Kansas constructed, operated, and owned the market, financing the development with municipal 
revenue bonds. Another city, Kansas City, Mo. (hereinafter Missouri), also operated a rail food terminal within the same metropolitan area.  
Because Kansas believed that there was insufficient business in the metropolitan area to support both markets, it developed a 
plan to induce Missouri produce dealers to lease its facilities by offering cash payments and temporary reduction or abatement 
of rent.  These payments exceeded the amounts needed to compensate the merchants for the costs of moving, settlement of 
existing leases, and disruption to business.  Kansas adopted the payment plan by resolution, and its legality under Kansas law 
was sustained by the Kansas Supreme Court in a quo warranto proceeding.  State ex rel. Parker v. Kansas City, 151 Kan. 1, 97 
P.2d 104, 98 P.2d 101 (1939). The Missouri terminal was served by a number of railroads, but the Kansas terminal was served virtually exclusively by the 
Union Pacific Railroad.  As merchants moved from Missouri to Kansas, the Union Pacific's traffic necessarily increased while 
that of the other railroads shrank.  The United States charged that the effect of Kansas' concessions to merchants was to permit 
them to ship produce over the Union Pacific more cheaply than on the competing railroads serving the Missouri terminal and, in 
effect, amounted to a rebate from Union Pacific's tariffs.  The District Court permanently enjoined Kansas from giving cash or 
rental credits to Missouri dealers to move or for moving to Kansas. On appeal to this Court, Kansas argued that because the concessions were lawful under state law, it could not be enjoined from 
making them, and the United States argued that the municipality was a ""person"" within the meaning of the statute and therefore 
subject to the Act on the same terms as a private corporation.  See Brief for Appellants, O.T. 1940, No. 594, pp. 233-235, 244-
256; Brief for United States, O.T. 1940, No. 594, p. 72.  See generally id., at 59-68, 69-75. The Court held that the municipality was a ""person"" subject to the Act, and, with a modification not important here, upheld the 
permanent injunction against it.  Mr. Justice Roberts, in dissent, made the argument made by the cities here, that the statutory 
phrase ""every person"" was not sufficiently specific to justify the conclusion that Congress wished to subject municipal 
corporations and their officers to the criminal penalties for which the Act provided.  It is significant that the cities' argument was 
rejected in the context of the antirebate provisions of the Elkins Act, a statute which essentially is an antitrust provision serving 
the same purposes as the anti-price-discrimination provisions of the Robinson-Patman Act.  Accord, Slater, Antitrust and

254,40," The plurality opinion in Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., 428 U.S. 579 (1976), also analyzed a ""state action"" exemption claim in 
terms of whether the challenged anticompetitive action was taken pursuant to state command.  Detroit Edison, an electric utility 
regulated by Michigan, was charged by an independent seller of light bulbs with antitrust violations in the operation of a program 
which provided light bulbs without extra cost to electricity customers. Detroit Edison, relying on Parker, defended on the ground 
that the light-bulb program was included in its rate filed with and approved by the State Public Service Commission and that 
state law required it to follow the terms of the tariff as long as it was in effect.  Cantor rejected the claim, holding that since no 
Michigan statutes regulated the light-bulb industry, and since neither the Michigan Legislature nor the Public Service 
Commission had passed upon the desirability of such a light-bulb program, the Commission's approval of Detroit Edison's 
program did not ""implement any statewide policy relating to light blubs"" and that ""the State's policy is neutral on the question 
whether a utility should, or should not, have such a program."" 428 U.S., at 585. THE CHIEF JUSTICE, while not joining all of the 
plurality opinion, agreed with this analysis.  Id., at 604-605. Cantor's analysis is not, however, necessarily applicable here.  Cantor was concerned with whether anticompetitive activity in 
which purely private parties engaged could, under the circumstances of that case, be insulated from antitrust enforcement.  The 
situation involved here, on the other hand, presents the issue of under what circumstances a State's subdivisions engaging in 
anticompetitive activities should be deemed to be acting as agents of the State."
254,41," Petitioners argue that Goldfarb, like Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., supra, expresses a limitation upon the circumstances under 
which private parties may be immunized from suit under the antitrust laws. They seek to avoid our holding in Goldfarb by 
suggesting that the State Bar, although a state agency by law acting in its official capacity, was somehow not a state agency 
because its official actions in issuing ethical opinions, see 421 U.S., at 791 n. 21, benefited its member-lawyers by discouraging 
price competition.  We think it obvious that the fact that the ancillary effect of the State Bar's policy, or even the conscious desire 
on its part, may have been to benefit the lawyers it regulated cannot transmute the State Bar's official actions into those of a 
private organization.  In addition to the decision in this case, every other Court of Appeals which has considered the immunity of 
state instrumentalities after Goldfarb has regarded it as having held that anticompetitive actions of a state instrumentality not 
compelled by the State acting as sovereign are not immune from the antitrust laws. Fairfax v. Fairfax Hospital Assn., 562 F. 2d

of a particular activity or the manner in which the Government conducts it'"" (citation omitted), discloses the fallacy of his effort to 
distinguish Goldfarb on the ground that, although the State Bar was ""'a state agency for some limited purposes,' . . . the price 
fixing it fostered was for the private benefit of its members and its actions were essentially those of a private professional group.""

255,42," Without explication, our Brother STEWART's dissent states that our ""reliance . . . on the basically irrelevant body of law under

which Congress in 1890 was well aware, see Lincoln County v. Luning, 133 U.S. 529 (1890), is that political subdivisions are not 
as such sovereign. Certainly, nothing in National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U.S. 833 (1976), even remotely suggested the 
contrary; we search in vain for anything in that case that establishes a constructional principle of presumptive congressional 
deference in behalf of cities.  Indeed our emphasis today in our conclusion, that municipalities are ""exempt"" from antitrust 
enforcement when acting as state agencies implementing state policy to the same extent as the State itself makes it difficult to 
see how National League of Cities is even tangentially implicated."
255,43," ""While state legislatures exercise extensive power over their constituents and over the various units of local government, the 
States universally leave much policy and decisionmaking to their governmental subdivisions.  Legislators enact many laws but 
do not attempt to reach those countless matters of local concern necessarily left wholly or partly to those who govern at the local 
level."" Avery v. Midland County, 390 U.S. 474, 481 (1968). Although Avery concluded that the actions of local government are the actions of the State for purposes of the Fourteenth 
Amendment, state action required under Parker has different attributes.  Cf.  Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 667 n. 12 (1974)."
255,44," Indeed, state policy may be contrary to that adopted by a political subdivision, yet, for a variety of reasons, might not render 
the local policy unlawful under state law. For example, a state public utilities commission might adopt, though we are not aware 
that the Louisiana PUC has done so, a policy prohibiting the specific anticompetitive practices in which the municipality engages, 
yet be unable to enforce that policy with respect to municipalities because it lacks jurisdiction over them.  (The Louisiana PUC, in 
litigation unrelated to this case, has been held to lack jurisdiction over municipal utility systems whether operating within or 
without the municipality. City of Monroe v. Louisiana Public Serv. Comm'n, No. 177, 757 -- Div. ""I"" (19th Jud. Dist. Ct., Sept. 14, 
1976).) If that were the case, and assuming that there were no other evidence to the contrary, it would be difficult to say that 
state policy fosters, much less compels, the anticompetitive practices. "
256,," Louisiana Rev. Stat. Ann. § 33:1334(G) (West Supp. 1977) provides another illustration of the fact that a particular activity in 
which a subdivision technically has power to engage does not necessarily conform to, and may conflict with, state policy. 
Louisiana has authorized municipalities to create intergovernmental commissions as municipal instrumentalities jointly to 
construct and operate public services including utilities.  §§ 33:1324, 33:1331-33:1334 (West Supp. 1977).  Such commissions 
are, by definition, political subdivisions of the State.  § 33:1334(D) (West Supp. 1977).  Section 1334 (G) nevertheless provides 
that ""[n]othing in this Chapter shall be construed to grant an immunity to or on behalf of any [such] public instrumentality . . . from 
any antitrust laws of the state or of the United States."""
256,45," We reject petitioners' fallback position that an antitrust claim will not lie for anticompetitive municipal action which, though not 
state directed, is lawful under state law. See Schwegmann Bros. v. Calvert Distillers Corp., 341 U.S. 384 (1951); Northern 
Securities Co. v. United States, 193 U.S. 197, 344-351 (1904); cf.  Union Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 313 U.S. 450 (1941) 
(discussed in n. 19, supra).  See also n. 44, supra."
256,46," Restating a theme made and rejected before, see Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., 428 U.S., at 640 (STEWART, J., dissenting), 
our Brother STEWART's dissent, post, at 438-440, likens judicial enforcement of the antitrust laws to a regime of substantive 
due process used by federal judges to strike down state and municipal economic regulation thought by them unfair.  That 
analogy, of course, ignores the congressional judgment mandating broad scope in enforcement of the antitrust laws and simply 
reflects the dissent's view that such enforcement with respect to cities is unwise. "
257,47," While the majority and dissent disagreed in Otter Tail over whether the specific practices of which plaintiffs complained could 
be regarded as unlawful anticompetitive restraints in light of the existence of federal regulation, there was agreement that a 
lawful monopolist could violate the antitrust laws. Compare 410 U.S., at 377-382 with id., at 390-391, n. 7 (STEWART, J., 
concurring in part and dissenting in part)."
257,48," It may be that certain activities which might appear anticompetitive when engaged in by private parties, take on a different 
complexion when adopted by a local government.  See generally Posner, The Proper Relationship Between State Regulation 
and the Federal Antitrust Laws, 49 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 693, 705 (1974)."
257,1," The District Court did not, of course, make a formal finding of fact to this effect since the counterclaim was disposed of on the 
basis of pleadings.  Nonetheless, the District Court could reasonably conclude, as a matter of law, that these Cities are engaging 
in business activities which have as their aim the production of revenues in excess of costs.  It certainly is the case that the 
Cities are attempting to provide a public service, but it is likewise undeniable that they seek to do so in the most profitable way.  
The Cities allege in their complaint, for example, that they have ""been prevented from profitably expanding their businesses."" 
App. 14.  While it is correct that the Cities are ordinarily constrained from applying their net earnings as a private corporation 
would, this does not detract from their competitive posture and resulting incentive to engage in anticompetitive practices. "
259,2," Our conceptions of the limits imposed by federalism are bound to evolve, just as our understanding of Congress' power under 
the Commerce Clause has evolved.  Consequently, since we find it appropriate to allow the ambit of the Sherman Act to expand 
with evolving perceptions of congressional power under the Commerce Clause, a similar process should occur with respect to 
""state action"" analysis under Parker. That is, we should not treat the result in the Parker case as cast in bronze; rather, the 
scope of the Sherman Act's power should parallel the developing concepts of American federalism."
259,3," I use the term ""proprietary"" only to focus attention on the fact that all of the parties are in a competitive relationship such that 
each should be constrained, when necessary, by the federal antitrust laws. It is highly unlikely that Congress would have meant 
to impose liability only on some of these parties, when each possesses the means to thwart federal antitrust policy."
259,4," MR. JUSTICE STEWART's dissent, post, at 433-434, attempts to blunt this analysis by noting that the ""nongovernmental-
governmental"" distinction was criticized in Indian Towing Co. v. United States, 350 U.S. 61 (1955). I suggest no more, however, 
than what is obvious from our past cases: Petitioners' business activities are not entitled to per se exemption from the Sherman 
Act. This much ought to be quite clear from United States v. California, 297 U.S. 175 (1936), where the State operated a 
railroad, albeit without profit, and as a ""public function."" I cannot comprehend why the Cities here should be treated in a different 
manner.  The only authority which MR. JUSTICE STEWART cites to the contrary, Lowenstein v. Evans, 69 F. 908 (CCSC 1895), 
was a case in which a State's complete monopolization of the liquor industry was challenged as violating the Sherman Act. But 
in that circumstance the State clearly directed the creation of a monopoly, thus bringing the matter within the Parker rationale.  
Compare Ohio v. Helvering, 292 U.S. 360 (1934). "
260,5," Such an ascertainment dovetails precisely with the law of Louisiana.  There it is recognized that the powers of a municipal 
corporation are both public and private: As to the former, the city represents the State, discharging duties incumbent upon the 
State; as to the latter, it represents pecuniary and proprietary interests of individuals, and is held to the same responsibility as a 
private person.  Hall v. Shreveport, 157 La. 589, 594, 102 So. 680, 681 (1925). A long line of Louisiana cases dealing explicitly 
with the subject of municipally owned electrical utilities holds that cities are to be governed by the same rules applicable to 
private corporations and individuals.  See Hicks v. City of Monroe Utilities Comm'n, 237 La. 848, 112 So. 2d 635 (1959); Elias v. 
Mayor of New Iberia, 137 La. 691, 69 So. 141 (1915); Hart v. Lake Providence, 5 La. App. 294 (1926); Bannister v. City of 
Monroe, 4 La. App. 182 (1926)."
260,6," While I agree with the plurality that a State may cause certain activities to be exempt from the federal antitrust laws by virtue of 
an articulated policy to displace competition with regulation, I would require a strong showing on the part of the defendant that 
the State so intended.  Thus, I would not be satisfied, as the plurality and Court of Appeals apparently are, that the highest 
policymaking body in the State of Louisiana merely ""contemplated"" the activities being undertaken by the cities.  See ante, at 
415.  I would insist, as the Court did in Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 791 (1975), that the State compel the 
anticompetitive activity.  Moreover, I would have the Cities demonstrate that the exemption was not only part of a regulatory 
scheme to supersede competition, but that it was essential to the State's plan.  Consequently, I do not disagree with the terms of "
261,," the plurality's remand as such; I would simply ask for a stronger showing on the part of the Cities.  I join the judgment, however, 
and the directions of the remand, because they represent at a minimum what I believe we should demand of petitioners."
261,7," In Cantor this mode of analysis effectively answered Detroit Edison's claim that it was required by state law to engage in the 
allegedly anticompetitive activities.  We ""infer[red] that the State's policy [was] neutral on the question whether a utility should, or 
should not, have such a program,"" 428 U.S., at 585 (opinion of STEVENS, J.) (emphasis added), 604-605 (opinion of BURGER, 
C.J.), and consequently it could not be said that an exemption ""was necessary in order to make the regulatory Act work."""
261,*, MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN joins all but Part II-B of this opinion.
261,1," As the plurality acknowledges, ante, at 393 n. 8, Parker v. Brown did not create any exemption from the antitrust laws, but 
simply recognized that it was the intent of Congress that the Sherman Act should not apply to governmental action. It is thus 
hard to understand why the plurality invokes the doctrine that exemptions from the antitrust laws will not be lightly implied by 
subsequent enactment of a regulatory statute.  This rule, which effects the accommodation of two federal statutes and rests on 
the principle that implied repeals are not favored, has no relevance to the Parker doctrine, which is based on an interpretation of 
the Sherman Act itself. "
262,2," See also, e.g., 20 Cong. Rec. 1458 (1889) (""the practice, now becoming too common, of large corporations, and of single 
persons, too, of large wealth, so arranging that they dictate to the people of this country what they shall pay when they purchase, 
and what they shall receive when they sell""); 21 Cong. Rec. 2728 (1890) (""transaction[s] the only purpose of which is to extort 
from the community, monopolize, segregate, and apply to individual use, for the purposes of individual greed, wealth which 
ought properly and lawfully and for the public interest to be generally diffused over the whole community""); id., at 3147 (remarks 
of Sen. George). That the Sherman Act was enacted to deal with combinations of individuals and corporations for private business advantage has 
long been recognized by this Court.  Eastern Railroad Presidents Conf. v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 135-136; 
Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U.S., at 492-493, and n. 15; Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 221 U.S. 1, 50, 58."
262,3," See Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., 428 U.S. 579, 591, and n. 24."
262,4," The Court assumed that California's program would violate the Sherman Act ""if it were organized and made effective solely by 
virtue of a contract, combination or conspiracy of private persons, individual or corporate,"" but noted that the program ""was 
never intended to operate by force of individual agreement or combination."" 317 U.S., at 350. The Court found nothing in the 
Sherman Act or its legislative history to suggest that ""it was intended to restrain state action or official action directed by a state""; 
rather, the Act was intended ""to suppress combinations to restrain competition and attempts to monopolize by individuals and 
corporations."" Id., at 351.It was ""a prohibition of individual and not state action."" Id., at 352."
262,5," See also, e.g., Trenton v. New Jersey, 262 U.S. 182, 185-186; Hunter v. Pittsburgh, 207 U.S. 161, 178; The Mayor v. Ray, 19

Co., 10 How. 511. Under Louisiana law the petitioners' powers are subject to complete legislative control.  See Bradford v. 
Shreveport, supra."
263,7," That the particular factual and legal context is all important is shown by the fact that under other provisions of the Constitution a 
municipality is equated with a State.  E.g., Waller v. Florida, 397 U.S. 387 (Double Jeopardy Clause); Avery v. Midland County, 
390 U.S. 474, 480 (Fourteenth Amendment); Trenton v. New Jersey, supra (Impairment of Contract Clause).  See also Doran v. 
Salem Inn, Inc., 422 U.S. 922, 927 n. 2 (28 U.S.C. § 1254 (2))."

264,9," See Schwegmann Bros. v. Calvert Distillers Corp., 341 U.S. 384; Northern Securities Co. v. United States, 193 U.S. 197, 346."
264,10," However, the District Court's ""conclusion,"" ante, at 418, that the petitioners' electric utility service was a business activity 
engaged in for profit was not supported by any evidence (since the case was decided on a motion to dismiss) and is indeed 
challenged here by the petitioners in their reply brief."
264,11," Of course, the fact -- heavily relied upon both by the plurality and THE CHIEF JUSTICE -- that the actions of cities may have 
anticompetitive effects misses the point.  The whole issue before the Court today is whether conduct that would concededly 
subject a private individual to liability because of its anticompetitive nature is proscribed by the antitrust laws when undertaken 
by a city."
264,12," In various places, the separate opinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE refers to ""'business activit[ies] . . . in which a profit is 
realized,'"" to ""proprietary enterprises,"" to activities which have ""the inherent capacity for economically disruptive anticompetitive 
effects,"" to those which are not ""integral operation[s] in the area of traditional government functions,"" and to those not ""the 
prerogative of the State."" "
265,13," This case, involving a state liquor monopoly, was cited with approval in Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S., at 352."
265,14," See, e.g., Lockport v. Citizens for Community Action, 430 U.S. 259, 269; Avery v. Midland County, 390 U.S., at 481-482."
265,15," Local self-government is broadest in ""home rule"" municipalities, which can be almost entirely free from legislative control in 
local matters.  See Vanlandingham, Municipal Home Rule in the United States, 10 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 269 (1968). Although the 
petitioners are not home rule cities, Louisiana's Constitution has a home rule provision, La. Const. of 1974, Art. 6, §§ 5, 6; La. 
Const. of 1921, Art. XIV, §§ 22, 40 (c), as do the constitutions or statutes of at least 33 other States.  Note, Antitrust Law and 
Municipal Corporations, 65 Geo. L.J. 1547, 1559 n. 77 (1977)."
265,16," While THE CHIEF JUSTICE has not joined those portions of the plurality opinion that discuss what is necessary to show that a 
challenged activity was required by the State, he would apparently require a still stronger, and hence less justifiable, showing of 
state legislative compulsion.  Ante, at 425-426, n. 6."
265,17," La. Rev. Stat. Ann.  § 33:621 (West 1951): ""The inhabitants of the city shall continue a body politic and corporate by its present name and, as such,… may sue and be 
sued;… may acquire by condemnation or otherwise, construct, own, lease, and operate and regulate public utilities within or 
without the corporate limits of the city subject only to restrictions imposed by general law for the protection of other "
266,," communities;… [and] may borrow money on the faith and credit of the city by issue or sale of bonds, notes, or other evidences of 
debt. . . ."" See also La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 33:1326 (West 1951), 33:4162, 33:4163 (West 1966)."
266,18," The plurality's suggestion that the Louisiana Legislature has expressed a state policy that the activities of cities should be 
subject to the antitrust laws, ante, at 414-415, n. 44, and 416, is both erroneous and irrelevant.  Louisiana Rev. Stat. Ann. § 
33:1334 (G) (West Supp. 1977) applies not to municipalities but only to utility commissions created jointly by several cities or 
counties; there is no comparable statute applicable to the petitioners.  Moreover, the applicability of the federal antitrust laws is a 
matter of federal, not state, law; conversely, a State's restrictions on municipal action are a matter of state, not federal, law.  A 
State can no more bring a person's conduct within the coverage of federal law when Congress has not done so than it can 
exempt a person's conduct from the operation of federal law if Congress has provided otherwise. Cf.  Schwegmann Bros. v. 
Calvert Distillers Corp., 341 U.S. 384."
266,19," The Court imposes yet another unwarranted limitation upon governmental immunity from the antitrust laws. Apparently, a 
municipality can claim immunity only if the state legislature has mandated its action ""pursuant to state policy to displace 
competition with regulation or monopoly public service."" Ante, at 413 (plurality opinion); see ante, at 425 (opinion of BURGER, 
C.J.).  Even had the Louisiana State Legislature passed a law specifically compelling the petitioners to litigate in an effort to 
prevent respondent from constructing its nuclear generating facility, compelling them to insert restrictive covenants in their 
debentures, and compelling the tying arrangements complained of, could such a law fairly be described as ""displac[ing] 
competition with regulation or monopoly public service""?  Would the Court thus deny the cities immunity for their actions even if 
they were compelled by the State which controlled them?"
266,20," See M. Price & H. Bitner, Effective Legal Research 73, 103 (3d ed. 1969)."
266,21," See n. 17, supra."
266,22," This problem of statutory interpretation is exacerbated by the fact that today's decision will have ""retroactive"" application in two 
senses.  First, antitrust liability can be premised on actions that have occurred in the past.  Second, many of the statutes 
governing contemporary and future municipal activities were enacted years ago.  Thus, municipalities will be faced with the 
difficult problem of establishing their antitrust immunity based on statutes that were enacted without any foreknowledge of the 
criteria announced by the Court today."
266,23," The vagueness of the test proposed in the separate opinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE, see supra, at 433-434, will only add to 
the confusion of a city trying to protect itself from antitrust liability. "
267,24," See Whitworth v. Perkins, 559 F. 2d 378 (CA5)."
267,25," By imposing antitrust liability on ""proprietary"" governmental activities, the test adopted in the opinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE 
would further deter States from choosing to provide services themselves rather than regulating others."
267,26," See Sailors v. Board of Education, 387 U.S. 105; Williams v. Eggleston, 170 U.S. 304, 310; see also Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 
186, 289-290, and n. 23, and cases cited (Frankfurter, J., dissenting). The plurality's emphasis on legislative action also leaves in doubt the status of state delegations of power to administrative 
agencies, unless they, too, can show that the legislature ""directed"" their actions.  This, of course, defeats the whole purpose of 
establishing such agencies."

268,30," The Court indicates that the remedy of treble damages might not be ""appropriate"" in antitrust actions against a municipality. 
Ante, at 401-402, and n.22.  But the language of § 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15 (1976 ed.), is mandatory on its face: It 
requires that ""[a]ny person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws 
… shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained"" (emphasis supplied).  Cf., e.g., 35 U.S.C. § 284. And the legislative 
history cited by MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, post, at 443 n. 2, demonstrates that Congress has understood the treble-damages 
provision to be mandatory and has refused to change it.  The Court does not say on what basis a district court could possibly 
disregard this clear statutory command.  Cf.  Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. International Parts Corp., 392 U.S. 134."
268,31," Legal fees to defend one current antitrust suit have been estimated as at least one-half million dollars a month.  N.Y. Times, 
June 27, 1977, p. 41, col. 6; id., Sept. 4, 1977, section 3, p. 5, col. 1."
268,32," Treble-damages liability can, of course, be ruinous to a private corporation as well.  But a private corporation, organized for 
the purpose of seeking private profit, is surely very different from a city providing essential governmental functions, and 
shareholders do not stand in the same relation to their corporation as do residents or taxpayers to the city in which they live.  An 
investment in a corporation is essentially a business decision; a shareholder takes the risks of corporate losses in the hope of 
corporate profits.  A citizen's relationship to his city government is obviously far different. "
269,1," Respondent seeks treble damages in excess of $ 540 million in this case.  If divided among Plaquemine and Lafayette 
residents, that penalty would exceed $ 28,000 for each family of four. Under the federal tax on sellers of alcoholic beverages, 26 U.S.C. §§ 11 and 205 (1926 ed.), construed in Ohio v. Helvering, 292 
U.S. 360, 370-371 (1934), the potential liability of the State of Ohio was $ 25 for each retail, and $ 100 for each wholesale, 
outlet.  Under §§ 16 and 17 of the Shipping Act, 1916, 46 U.S.C.  §§ 815, 816 (1940 ed.), construed in California v. United 
States, 320 U.S. 577, 585-586 (1944), a violation was a misdemeanor punishable by a $ 5,000 fine.  The Court's only arguable 
support lies in § 1 of the Elkins Act, 49 U.S.C. § 41, construed in Union Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 313 U.S. 450 (1941). 
Even there, the potential liability of a municipality not acting as a common carrier is a $ 20,000 fine, and, were illegal 
transportation rebates to be received by the municipality, three times the amount of the rebate.  Even if a municipality were held 
to be operating a common carrier under that Act, potential financial liability is limited to the fine and the actual damages caused 
by the prohibited conduct.  49 U.S.C. § 8."

take such action either against Major Leagues, Major League Clubs or individuals, as the case may be. This language is identical to Art. I, Sec. 2(a) and (b) as originally executed on January 12, 1921, with the exception that the 
words in present paragraph (a) ""not in the best interests of the national game of Baseball"" were originally ""detrimental to the best 
interests of the national game of baseball."" The change was made in 1964. The district court implied that the change broadened 
the Commissioner's powers when it found that ""previously the Commissioner had to find conduct 'detrimental' to the best 
interests of baseball in order to take remedial or preventive action. . . ."" Finding of Fact 28."
299,12, Finding of Fact 7.
299,13," Finding of Fact 39. A rule of this nature was in effect at least as early as 1931. In Milwaukee American Ass'n v. Landis, 49 
F.2d 298, 302 (N.D. Ill. 1931), the court noted that ""whether there is given to the commissioner the power in so many words to 
declare Bennett a free agent is immaterial, since the agreements and rules grant to the commissioner jurisdiction to refuse to 
approve Bennett's assignment by St. Louis to Milwaukee, and to declare him absolved from the burdens of the same and of his 
contract with St. Louis."" "
300,," A federal district judge in another case has expressed his opinion that the present case was correctly decided by the district 
court on the sole ground that the Commissioner was given specific authority under Major League Rule 12(a) to disapprove 
contracts and therefore render players free agents.  Atlanta National League Baseball Club, Inc. v. Kuhn, 432 F. Supp. 1213, 
1224 (fn.8), 1225 (N.D. Ga. 1977)."
300,14," Art. VII, Sec. 2 provides: The Major Leagues and their constituent clubs, severally agree to be bound by the decisions of the Commissioner, and the 
discipline imposed by him under the provisions of this Agreement, and severally waive such right of recourse to the courts 
as would otherwise have existed in their favor. This language is identical to Art. VII, Sec. 1 in the original 1921 agreement. Also, on the same day, January 12, 1921, that the 
Major League Agreement was signed on behalf of the two major leagues and sixteen baseball clubs, the league presidents and 
club presidents individually signed the following ""Pledge to Support the Commissioner"": We, the undersigned, earnestly desirous of insuring to the public wholesome and high-class baseball, and believing that we 
ourselves should set for the players an example of the sportsmanship which accepts the umpire's decision without 
complaint, hereby pledge ourselves loyally to support the Commissioner in his important and difficult task; and we assure 
him that each of us will acquiesce in his decisions even when we believe them mistaken, and that we will not discredit the 
sport by public criticism of him or of one another."
300,15," The last part of Art. VII, Sec. 2. Footnote 14 supra. The parties retained the first part of the section wherein they agreed to be 
bound by the decisions of the Commissioner and the discipline imposed by him."

300,20, Finding of Fact 28. See footnote 11 supra. 
301,21," The original 1921 agreement contained substantially the same language except it included the words ""conduct detrimental to 
baseball"" instead of ""not to be in the best interests of Baseball."" See footnote 11 supra.  There is a reference to Article I, Section 
4 in Milwaukee American Ass'n v. Landis, 49 F.2d 298, 299 (N.D. Ill. 1931)."
301,22," Art. I, Sec. 3 provides: In the case of conduct by Major League Clubs, officers, employees or players which is deemed by the Commissioner not to 
be in the best interests of Baseball, action by the Commissioner for each offense may include any one or more of the 
following: (a) a reprimand; (b) deprivation of a Major League Club of representation in joint meetings; (c) suspension or 
removal of any officer or employee of a Major League Club; (d) temporary or permanent ineligibility of a player; and (e) a 
fine, not to exceed Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) in the case of a Major League or a Major League Club and not to 
exceed Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) in the case of any officer, employee or player. The original 1921 agreement was substantially the same except that until 1964 (1) it used the phrase ""in the case of conduct 
detrimental to baseball,"" see footnote 11 supra; (2) it described the enumerated forms of action as ""punitive action""; and (3) the 
possibility of assessing a fine against an individual of up to $500 did not appear in the agreement until 1964."
301,23, See footnote 22 supra.
301,24," The district court said in its judgment order of March 17, 1977: ""Nowhere in the Agreement is there a comparable list of the 
'preventative' or 'remedial' actions he is empowered to take. Obviously such a list would be impossible to draw in the face of the 
unpredictability of the problems which arise."" "
302,25, See footnote 22 supra.
302,26," The following description of the changes in the reserve system appears in Atlanta National League Baseball Club, Inc. v. 
Kuhn, 432 F. Supp. 1213, 1215 (N.D. Ga. 1977): This system, which essentially bound a player to a team perpetually unless traded or released, was known as the reserve 
system. In 1975, the Players Association filed grievances on behalf of two players, Andy Messersmith and Dave McNally, 
challenging this system. An arbitration panel considered the grievances and concluded that players who had completed 
their last year of a contract with a particular club would be obligated, at the option of the club, to play only one additional 
year for that club. Unless the player and club signed a new agreement during this ""option year, "" the player became a ""free 
agent, "" with the right to negotiate contract terms with other major league clubs at the end of the option year season. The 
decision of the arbitration panel was upheld by the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in Kansas City Royals Baseball 
Corp. v. Major League Baseball Players Ass'n., 532 F.2d 615 (8th Cir. 1976). In an effort to implement the Kansas City Royals decision, the representatives of the Players Association and the club 
owners met to hammer out a new collective bargaining agreement. An agreement was reached in July, 1976 which 
established a special reentry draft to be conducted in November of each year for those players who had become free 
agents at the end of a baseball season. Procedures were established for the November draft whereby negotiation rights 
with each free agent could be drafted by up to twelve teams, each of which were then given negotiation rights for that 
player. Between the end of the season and three days prior to the draft, however, only the club of record, the team for 
which the prospective free agent was playing out his option, had negotiation rights with that player. "
303,27," This realization of value could come in the form of subsequent player transactions involving less cash but some returning-
player value, or in box office profits attributable to these players, or possibly in the aggregate value of the club if and when 
eventually sold as a franchise and team."

303,32," Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis was 38 years old when President Theodore Roosevelt appointed him to the United States 
District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in 1905. When he accepted the office of Commissioner of baseball in November 
1920, he continued in his judicial post which provoked heavy criticism from Congress, the American Bar Association and the 
press. Landis finally sent his judicial resignation to President Harding in February 1922, to become effective March 1, after 
having held both positions for more than 15 months. He served as baseball Commissioner for almost 25 years until his death on 
November 25, 1944. 2 VOIGHT, AMERICAN BASEBALL (1970) 141-150; 2 SEYMOUR BASEBALL: THE GOLDEN AGE (1971)

the Commissioner from their property rights in players' contracts, it has always been and still remains within their power to do so. 
They have not."""

306,44," Finding of Fact 55. See also Finding of Fact 53: It is beyond the province of this court to consider the wisdom of the Commissioner's reasons for disapproving the 
assignments of Rudi, Blue and Fingers. There is insufficient evidence, however, to support plaintiff's allegation that the 
Commissioner's action was arbitrary or capricious, or motivated by malice, ill will or anything other than the Commissioner's 
good faith judgment that these attempted assignments were not in the best interests of baseball. The great majority of 
persons involved in baseball who testified on this point shared Commissioner Kuhn's view."
306,45," Oakland has not expressly argued that the Commissioner's notice of hearing, the hearing itself, or his written decision with 
express reasons were procedurally unfair, but only that Oakland was not put on notice of a changed policy and that the 
Commissioner bore malice toward Finley."
306,46," Tr. 811: The Court: Well, it [motivation of the Commissioner] is one [allegation of the complaint] that the testimony thus far has not 
really supported and I don't think it is a serious allegation. I don't take it seriously. I am not interested in whether the 
Commissioner likes Mr.  Finley or whether he doesn't. If he had the authority to do what he did, we have a legal issue, and 
that is the only one I am going to look at, so I will sustain the objection."

307,," For the third time in 50 years the Court is asked specifically to rule that professional baseball's reserve system is within the 
reach of the federal antitrust laws. Id. at 259. With its reserve system enjoying exemption from the federal antitrust laws, baseball is, in a very distinct sense, an 
exception and an anomaly. Id. at 282."

authorized by state law as constitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment where ""a party gives up in advance his constitutional 
right to defend any suit by the other."" The Court said that a voluntary, intelligent and knowing waiver of rights is valid. Similarly, 
Bremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co., 407 U.S. 1, 32 L. Ed. 2d 513, 92 S. Ct. 1907 (1972), upheld a private contractual agreement

parties to the Major League Agreement regarding their understanding concerning the authority of the Commissioner. The 
uncommunicated intentions and understandings of parties to a contract are inadmissible to establish their earlier intent at the 
time of contract formation. E.g., Union Bank v. Winnebago Industries, Inc., 528 F.2d 95, 99 (9th Cir. 1975). I do not believe 
Finley was prejudiced by this error, however, in light of the unambiguous contractual language, the fact that the trial was held 
without a jury, and the judge's statement that he would give minimal weight to the testimony."

District No. 46 v. Del Bianco, 68 Ill. App.2d 145, 215 N.E.2d 25 (1966), involved a contract for arbitration. Public policy in that "

District Court specifically found that the record ""[supports] a finding that NSPE and its members actively pursue a course of 
policing adherence to the competitive bid ban through direct and indirect communication with members and prospective clients.""

348,7, The entire defense pleaded in the answer reads as follows: 
349,," ""18.  (a) The principles and standards contained in the NSPE Code of Ethics, particularly those contained in that part of the 
NSPE Code of Ethics set out above, are reasonable, necessary to the public health, safety and welfare insofar as they are 
affected by the work of professional engineers, and serve the the public interest. ""(b) Experience has demonstrated that competitive bidding for professional engineering services is inconsistent with securing for 
the recipients of such services the most economical projects or structures.  Testing, calculating and designing the most 
economical and efficient structures and methods of construction is complex, difficult and expensive.  It is cheaper and easier to 
design and specify inefficient and unnecessarily expensive structures and methods of construction.  Consequently, if 
professional engineers are required by competitive pressures to submit bids in order to obtain employment of their services, the 
inevitable tendency will be to offer professional engineering services at the lowest possible price.  Although this may result in 
some lowering of the cost of professional engineering services it will inevitably result in increasing the overall cost and 
decreasing the efficiency of those structures and projects which require professional engineering design and specification work. ""(c) Experience has also demonstrated that competitive bidding in most instances and situations results in an award of the work 
to be performed to the lowest bidder, regardless of other factors such as ability, experience, expertise, skill, capability, learning 
and the like, and that such awards in the case of professional engineers endanger the public health, welfare and safety. ""(d) For the aforesaid reasons, the provisions of the NSPE Code of Ethics set out above are not, in any event, in unreasonable 
restraint of interstate trade or commerce."" App. 21-22."
349,8," The Court of Appeals struck down the portion of the District Court's decree that ordered the Society to state that it did not 
consider competitive bidding to be unethical.  181 U. S. App. D. C., at 47, 555 F.2d, at 984. The court reasoned that this 
provision was ""more intrusive than necessary to achieve fulfillment of the governmental interest."" Ibid.  The Government has not 
petitioned for review of that decision. "
350,9," Section 1 of the Sherman Act, as set forth in 15 U. S. C. § 1 (1976 ed.), provides: HN2[

the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. . . ."""

351,15," ""Without going into detail and but very briefly surveying the whole field, it may be with accuracy said that the dread of 
enhancement of prices and of other wrongs which it was thought would flow from the undue limitation on competitive conditions 
caused by contracts or other acts of individuals or corporations, led, as a matter of public policy, to the prohibition or treating as 
illegal all contracts or acts which were unreasonably restrictive of competitive conditions, either from the nature or character of "
352,," the contract or act or where the surrounding circumstances were such as to justify the conclusion that they had not been entered 
into or performed with the legitimate purpose of reasonably forwarding personal interest and developing trade, but on the 
contrary were of such a character as to give rise to the inference or presumption that they had been entered into or done with 
the intent to do wrong to the general public and to limit the right of individuals, thus restraining the free flow of commerce and 
tending to bring about the evils, such as enhancement of prices, which were considered to be against public policy."" 221 U.S., at 
58."
352,16," Throughout the Court's opinion the emphasis is on economic conceptions.  For instance, the Court's description of the 
common-law treatment of engrossing and forestalling statutes noted that contracts which had been illegal on their face were 
later recognized as reasonable because they tended to promote competition.  Id., at 55. As was pointed out in the Report of the 
Attorney General's National Committee To Study the Antitrust Laws 11 (1955): LEdHN[8B][
] [8B]""While Standard Oil gave the courts discretion in interpreting the word 'every' in Section 1, such discretion is confined to consideration of whether in each case the conduct being reviewed under the Act constitutes an undue restraint of 
competitive conditions, or a monopolization, or an attempt to monopolize.  This standard permits the courts to decide whether 
conduct is significantly and unreasonably anticompetitive in character or effect; it makes obsolete once prevalent arguments, 
such as, whether monopoly arrangements would be socially preferable to competition in a particular industry, because, for 
example, of high fixed costs or the risks of 'cut-throat' competition or other similar unusual conditions."""
352,17," In Continental T. V., Inc., the Court explained the Rule of Reason standard as follows: ""Under this rule, the factfinder weighs all of the circumstances of a case in deciding whether a restrictive practice should be 
prohibited as imposing an unreasonable restraint on competition."" 433 U.S., at 49. The Court then analyzed the ""market impact"" of vertical restraints, noting their complexity because of the potential for a 
simultaneous reduction of intrabrand competition and stimulation of interbrand competition.  Id., at 50-51. ""Competitive impact"" 
and ""economic analysis"" were emphasized throughout the opinion."
352,18," See generally Attorney General's Report, supra n. 16, at 10-11; Bork, The Rule of Reason and the Per Se Concept: Price 
Fixing and Market Division, 74 Yale L. J. 775 (1965); L. Sullivan, Law of Antitrust 165-197 (1977). "
353,19," The Society also points out that competition, in the form of bargaining between the engineer and customer, is allowed under 
its canon of ethics once an engineer has been initially selected.  See n. 6, supra.  It then contends that its prohibition of 
competitive bidding regulates only the timing of competition, thus making this case analogous to Chicago Board of Trade, where 
the Court upheld an exchange rule which forbade exchange members from making purchases after the close of the day's 
session at any price other than the closing bid price.  Indeed, petitioner has reprinted the Government's brief in that case to 
demonstrate that the Solicitor General regarded the exchange's rule as a form of price fixing. Reply Brief for Petitioner A1-A28.  
We find this reliance on Chicago Board of Trade misplaced for two reasons.  First, petitioner's claim mistakenly treats negotiation 
between a single seller and a single buyer as the equivalent of competition between two or more potential sellers. Second, even 
if we were to accept the Society's equation of bargaining with price competition, our concern with Chicago Board of Trade is in 
its formulation of the proper test to be used in judging the legality of an agreement; that formulation unquestionably stresses 
impact on competition.  Whatever one's view of the application of the Rule of Reason in that case, see Sullivan, supra n. 18, at 
175-182, the Court considered the exchange's regulation of price information as having a positive effect on competition.  246 
U.S., at 240-241. The District Court's findings preclude a similar conclusion concerning the effect of the Society's ""regulation."""
353,20," We, of course, express no view on the truth of this assertion, although it might be noted that the Society has allowed 
competitive bidding for some types of engineering projects in this country, see n. 4, supra, and, at one time, allowed competitive 
bidding for all engineering work in foreign countries ""as required by the laws, regulations or practices of the foreign country."" 
App. 6487.  This rule, called the ""When-in-Rome"" clause, was abolished in 1968.  Id., at 6344. "
354,21," Indeed, Congress has decided not to require competitive bidding for Government purchases of engineering services.  The 
Brooks Act, 40 U. S. C. §§ 541-544 (1970 ed., Supp. V), requires the Government to use a method of selecting engineers similar 
to the Society's ""traditional method."" See n. 6, supra.  The Society relies heavily on the Brooks Act as evidence that its ban on 
competitive bidding is reasonable.  The argument is without merit.  The Brooks Act does not even purport to exempt engineering 
services from the antitrust laws, and the reasonableness of an individual purchaser's decision not to seek lower prices through 
competition does not authorize the vendors to conspire to impose that same decision on all other purchasers."
354,22," Courts have, for instance, upheld marketing restraints related to the safety of a product, provided that they have no 
anticompetitive effect and that they are reasonably ancillary to the seller's main purpose of protecting the public from harm or 
itself from product liability.  See, e. g., Tripoli Co. v. Wella Corp., 425 F.2d 932 (CA3 1970) (en banc); cf.  Continental T. V., 433 
U.S., at 55 n. 23. "

355,25," LEdHN[14B][

355,26," Thus, in Goldfarb, although the bar association believed that its fee schedule accurately reflected ethical price levels, it was 
nonetheless enjoined ""from adopting, publishing, or distributing any future schedules of minimum or suggested fees."" Goldfarb v. 
Virginia State Bar, 355 F.Supp. 491, 495-496 (ED Va. 1973). See also United States v. National Assn. of Real Estate Boards,

355,27," For instance, the Society argues that the injunction can be read as prohibiting it from opposing repeal of statutes such as the 
Brooks Act, see n. 21, supra, and that such a prohibition would violate the principles of the Noerr-Pennington doctrine.  See 
Eastern Railroad Presidents Conf. v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127; Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657. By its 
terms the injunction contains no such prohibition, and indeed the Government contends that ""[nothing] in the judgment prevents 
NSPE and its members from attempting to influence governmental action . . . ."" Brief for United States 60. "

Antitrust 175-182 (1977); R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 41-47, 56 (1978).  I intimate no view as to the correctness of those 
decisions. "
362,*, Chief Judge Kaufman and Judge Oakes took no part in the en banc consideration of this appeal.
362,1," At no time in the course of this litigation has Oreck alleged that either its 1963 or its 1968 contract with Whirlpool in and of itself 
violated § 1 of the Sherman Act. Neither was alleged to be an agreement which attempted to fix prices or eliminate resale price 
competition, nor did it attempt to impose unreasonable geographical or customer restraints on Oreck's ability to compete. "
363,2," According to their testimony, it was Whirlpool's intention that Oreck's distributorship would serve as an avenue to the sale of 
""Whirlpool"" vacuum cleaners to department stores and other special retail accounts.  There was further testimony that by 1965, 
Oreck had abandoned this marketing strategy and had resorted to sales to janitorial supply houses, and that Oreck further 
departed from Whirlpool's original plan by adopting, in 1967, a technique for making sales of ""Whirlpool"" machines through direct 
mail orders. It was undisputed that by 1970, mail order sales comprised over 90% of Oreck's business."
363,3," David Oreck testified that the vacuum cleaner industry is a large one and that during 1971, when Oreck sold 78,203 vacuum 
cleaners, consumers purchased about 7.8 million cleaners. Oreck, therefore, had no more than a 1% market share at the time of 
the completion of its exclusive distributorship for Whirlpool. Moreover, there was, at all relevant times, an abundance of vacuum 
cleaners available in the marketplace which were reasonably interchangeable with those manufactured by Whirlpool."
363,4," Count 2 of the complaint charged that Whirlpool and Sears unlawfully conspired to exclude Oreck from the vacuum cleaner 
market in Canada.  (Counts 3 through 7 were dismissed.) At trial, Oreck contended that Whirlpool's refusal to grant its request 
that Whirlpool procure Canadian Standards Association approval for the ""Whirlpool"" vacuum cleaners it desired to sell in 
Canada, provided substantial evidence of the unlawful conspiracy to remove Oreck's competition against Sears, selling its 
""Kenmore"" machines through its subsidiary, Simpson-Sears Ltd., the sole distributor of Whirlpool-made products in Canada. The 1963 and 1968 agreements between Whirlpool and Oreck both specifically stated that Whirlpool was appointing Oreck its 
exclusive distributor of certain ""Whirlpool"" products ""for the United States of America and its possessions."" The parties agree 
that this provision placed no restriction on the territory in which Oreck might sell goods purchased from Whirlpool. Whirlpool 
concedes that it refused to obtain Canadian Standards Association approval for the cleaners that Oreck was seeking to market 
in Canada, but argues that such approval was not a prerequisite to selling in Canada and that, in any event, Oreck sold vacuum 
cleaners in Canada during the period of its distributorship. On this count, the trial judge instructed the jury that, ""Arrangements . . . restricting the territory in which a product may be resold are unreasonable restraints of trade in and of 
themselves . . . You need not determine whether such arrangements are reasonable, or whether they have an impact upon 
the marketplace, nor need you be concerned with the business or supposed economic justification for such arrangements . 
. . ."" In light of the decision of the United States Supreme Court in Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 53 L. Ed. 
2d 568, 97 S. Ct. 2549 (1977), this instruction was incorrect. HN1[
] Efforts by a manufacturer to restrict the territory in which a 
distributor of its products operates are to be examined under the rule of reason standard.  See Eastern Scientific Co. v. Wild 
Heerbrugg Instruments, Inc., 572 F.2d 883, 46 U.S.L.W. 2492 (1st Cir. 1978). It is undisputed that Whirlpool was not required to obtain Canadian Standards Association approval for its vacuum cleaners as 
requested by Oreck. That its refusal to do so may have been based on an agreement with its existing Canadian distributor does 
not, of itself, create a violation of the antitrust laws. It must further be found that this agreement was anticompetitive in purpose "
364,," or effect. See Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., supra; Quality Mercury, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 542 F.2d 466 (8th Cir. 
1976), cert. denied sub nom.  Prestige Lincoln-Mercury, Inc.  v. Quality Mercury, Inc., 433 U.S. 914, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1100, 97 S. Ct. 
2986 (1977); Packard Motor Car Co. v. Webster Motor Car Co., 100 U.S. App. D.C. 161, 243 F.2d 418 (1957), cert. denied, 355 
U.S. 822, 2 L. Ed. 2d 38, 78 S. Ct. 29 (1957); Schwing Motor Co. v. Hudson Sales Corp., 138 F. Supp. 899 (D.Md.), aff'd, 239 
F.2d 176 (4th Cir. 1956), cert. denied, 355 U.S. 823, 2 L. Ed. 2d 38, 78 S. Ct. 30 (1957). The trial judge's failure to instruct the jury on this point was plain error. Moreover, it inevitably prejudiced the jury's consideration 
of the first count even though the matter of sales in the Canadian market was set out in the second count. In the evidence, in the 
arguments, and in the district court's charge, this incident was used as an example of the claimed unlawful activity by Whirlpool 
and Sears to keep Oreck from selling more vacuum cleaners and to destroy Oreck's competitive activities.  Throughout the trial, 
Whirlpool's refusal to procure Canadian Standards Association approval for the vacuum cleaners Oreck desired to sell in 
Canada was characterized as a major part of the alleged Whirlpool/Sears conspiracy to violate the antitrust laws."
364,5," Oreck introduced no evidence at trial to show that the purpose of Whirlpool's refusal to renew Oreck's distributorship was to 
give Sears the power to maintain the prices of its ""Kenmore"" machines at an artificially high level. Cf.  United States v. Socony-
Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 224-26 n. 59, 84 L. Ed. 1129, 60 S. Ct. 811 (1940). Neither did Oreck submit evidence to show 
that Whirlpool machines had a sufficient share of the vacuum cleaner market to permit any of its dealers to exploit a dealer 
monopoly without feeling the pinch of interbrand competition. See the Supreme Court, 1976 Term, 91 Harv.L.Rev. 70, 237 n. 57 
(1977). It appears from the record that there was effective competition in the vacuum cleaner business at the manufacturer level. 
When interbrand competition exists, it provides a significant check on the exploitation of intrabrand market power because of the 
ability of consumers to substitute a different brand of the same product. See Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., supra, "
365,," at 52 n. 19. In order to prove a violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act, Oreck would have had to show that Whirlpool's agreement 
with Sears to eliminate Oreck's competition either promoted a Whirlpool monopoly in the vacuum cleaner industry, see Quality 
Mercury, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., supra, at 470; Fleischmann Distilling Corp. v. Distillers Co. Ltd., 395 F. Supp. 221 (S.D.N.Y. 
1975); or gave Sears a market position from which it could raise retail prices even in the face of interbrand competition. See, 
ABA Antitrust Section, Monograph No. 2, Vertical Restrictions Limiting Intrabrand Competition (1977), at 93 n. 380. The 
Whirlpool/Sears agreement should, therefore, have been examined under the rule of reason standard."
365,6," Oreck seeks to distinguish the line of cases upholding the legality of agreements by which a manufacturer substitutes one 
exclusive distributor for another or terminates a distributor in order to afford another exclusive selling rights, see, e.g., Quality 
Mercury, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., supra; Elder-Beerman Stores Corp. v. Federated Dept. Stores, Inc., 459 F.2d 138 (6th Cir. 
1972); Alpha Distributing Co. of Calif. v. Jack Daniel Distillery, 454 F.2d 442 (9th Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 842, 42 L. 
Ed. 2d 70, 95 S. Ct. 74 (1974); Packard Motor Car Co. v. Webster Motor Car Co., supra; on the ground that Sears did not 
replace Oreck as the distributor of ""Whirlpool"" vacuum cleaners; and, therefore, competition of both an interbrand and intrabrand 
nature was eliminated. "
366,," While it is true that, because of its unique facts, this case does not fit exactly into the dealer substitution line of cases, appellee's 
argument does not persuade us that it therefore comes within the rule of per se illegality. It may be argued that there were 
alternative sources of supply available to Oreck and that the net effect of Whirlpool's decision to allow Oreck's distributorship to 
lapse was to add an interbrand competitor to Whirlpool-made machines in the upright vacuum cleaner market. Moreover, it 
appears from the record that, while Sears sold several models of Whirlpool-made vacuum cleaners under its ""Kenmore"" label, 
Oreck was allowed to market only one model under the terms of the 1968 agreement, thereby reducing the potential for 
intrabrand competition in Whirlpool-made machines. HN4[
] In the absence of a showing of an anticompetitive purpose or 
effect, the fact that Sears may have asked to be made the sole distributor of a certain line of products (in this case, Whirlpool-
made vacuum cleaners), does not render Whirlpool's subsequent action in refusing to renew Oreck's distributorship illegal. Cf.  
Federal Trade Commission v. Raymond Bros.-Clark Co., 263 U.S. 565, 68 L. Ed. 448, 44 S. Ct. 162 (1924); Packard Motor Car 
Co. v. Webster Motor Car Co., supra. The rule of reason provides a more discriminating way of differentiating true exclusive dealerships from two-firm vertical 
combinations to exclude a distributor from supply. Although Oreck asserts that Whirlpool's refusal to renew its distributorship 
was against Whirlpool's own economic interests, the trial court's instructions to the jury, under the per se rule, did not require the 
jury to balance the anticompetitive evils and pro-competitive virtues of the alleged vertical Sears/Whirlpool agreement, as would 
have been done under the rule of reason. See Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., supra, 433 U.S. at 57 n.27; Handler, 
Changing Trends in Antitrust Doctrines: An Unprecedented Supreme Court Term - 1977, 77 Colum.L.Rev. 979 at 983 (1977). 
HN5[
] ""Per se rules of illegality are appropriate only when they relate to conduct that is manifestly anticompetitive,"" Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., supra, at 49-50; and where the conduct involved is an agreement between a single 
manufacturer and a single distributor which results in a sole distributorship for the manufacturer's products, a careful inquiry into 
the business justifications for the agreement is required."
366,7," The evidence presented at trial by both parties revealed several instances of Oreck's alleged disregard for the terms of its 
contract, e.g., refusal to modify advertising campaigns in accordance with Whirlpool's wishes, sales to private label customers, 
and failure to abide by the original marketing strategy of distribution to major retail accounts; any one of which could have 
justified Whirlpool's refusal to renew Oreck's distributorship. In addition, the 1968 contract itself contained no provision for 
renewal. "
369,1," Insofar as the claim alleged in Count Two was presented to the jury as charging the defendants with an unlawful vertical 
location restriction, I agree with the majority that Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568, 97 
S. Ct. 2549 (1977), which was not decided until almost a year after Judge Owen instructed the jury in this case, now requires 
trial courts to make a preliminary determination of whether a particular challenged restraint warrants per se treatment or should 
be judged according to the rule of reason. Judge Owen did not make this preliminary determination. However, I do not agree with the majority that Judge Owen's charge 
on this point necessarily prejudiced the jury's consideration of the evidence relating to Count One, since the jury verdict on that 
Count was supported by abundant evidence independent of the proof concerning Whirlpool's resistance to Oreck's desire to 
enter the Canadian market. "
370,2," Indeed, despite minor differences, the machines sold by Oreck were so similar to those sold by Sears that they were 
characterized by an expert as ""the same."" "
371,3," It is noteworthy that no objection was made to these jury instructions at trial, nor did the defendants claim that the charge was 
erroneous in their appeal from the jury's verdict. The majority contends that Judge Owen's charge was defective in that it allowed the jury to find antitrust liability on evidence that 
amounted to no more than ""a perfectly legal exclusive distributorship."" (Maj.Opin. p. 130). Judge Owen properly instructed the 
jury on this point. His charge states: ""The manufacturer may discontinue an exclusive distributorship or may refuse to renew an exclusive distributorship for 
business reasons which are sufficient to the manufacturer alone and any adverse effect such a decision may have upon the 
business of the distributor is immaterial in the absence of any arrangement or conspiracy restraining trade or competition."" 
(Tr. 1839 (emphasis supplied)). "
372,4," Although my view of this case does not rest on Oreck's ability to compete with Sears price wise, one aspect of the issue of 
price competition merits discussion. Oreck's initial brief on appeal strongly suggested in numerous places that the Sears-
Whirlpool conspiracy was partly motivated by Sears' desire to eliminate Oreck because of the competition on prices that Oreck 
provided. These suggestions were not disputed by the defendants until the en banc briefs were filed. My panel dissent mistakenly referred to Oreck's prices for Whirlpool-made vacuum cleaners as ""lower"" than the Sears prices for 
its Kenmore version of the same cleaners. The important point, however, is not which cleaners were higher-priced, but whether 
Sears encountered serious competition from Oreck that motivated it to prevail upon Whirlpool to terminate Oreck. The evidence 
showed that Oreck was a vigorous competitor, especially in the last years of its distributorship, when its sales rose dramatically. 
Also, it is undisputed that by 1970, 90% of Oreck's sales were from mail order solicitations, a traditional preserve of Sears. "
373,5," See note 3, supra."
373,6," As Professor Sullivan observed in his discussion of the per se approach to group boycotts, ""it is conceivable that only a single 
firm at the blockaded level [Sears] may succeed in coercing or inducing . . . one important supplier [Whirlpool] . . . from dealing 
with one or more would-be competitors [Oreck]. . . . Such an arrangement would display all essential elements of a boycott.""

preheat lamp electrodes either temporarily as in a starter-type lamp or permanently as in a Rapid Start lamp; (c) supplies a 
controlled surge of high voltage to initiate the arc throughout a starter-type lamp; and (d) controls lamp current by reducing open

389,10," UMC claims that this conversation occurred at the October rather than the April meeting, a fact which is not material here. "
390,11," Shipment under such an order is known as a ""drop shipment."" "
395,12, UMC does not now sell the newly-developed H.I.D. ballast to ULD.
395,13," ULD's suggestion that UMC precluded ULD sales to OEMs in violation of United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co., 388 U.S. 
365, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1249, 87 S. Ct. 1856 (1967) as modified by Continental T.V. v. GTE Sylvania, 433 U.S. 36, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568, 
97 S. Ct. 2549 (1977) is without foundation.  UMC has done no more than merely refuse to recognize ULD's asserted exclusivity 
over these sales. In any event, ULD has not shown that it even solicits new OEM accounts. "
396,14," The drop shipments totalled $ 246,565.91 from 1971 to 1975."
396,15," Defendant's Exhibit D and Plaintiff's Exhibit K are the sources for all statistics. Where variations exist, plaintiff's figures are 
used, except where clearly shown to have been inaccurate. "
397,16, ULD's sales figures are taken from plaintiff's Memorandum at p. 51.  No adjustment was made for Wesco Atlanta sales.
397,17," The decline in total sales in 1974 is explained by UMC's refusal during the summer of 1974 to supply any more ballasts until 
ULD paid for previous orders. "
399,18," Counsel have been advised of the Court's findings concerning sales and net profits of ULD for the five years before suit was 
filed. These figures will not be included as a part of the published opinion."
399,19," In view of this Court's approach to the issue of monopolization, it is not necessary to consider UMC's share of the relevant 
product market.  Figures are not available concerning UMC's share of the replacement market in the five state area, although its 
share of the overall, national market was 42.8% in 1976. "
400,20," At the hearing, plaintiff submitted a reply affidavit of Hyman S.  Bernstein with exhibits. This affidavit was timely under Rule 56, 
and defendants' oral motion to strike the affidavit will be denied. "
407,1," New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia define the relevant 
geographic region."
407,2, Several individuals who were originally named defendants have been voluntarily dismissed from the actions by stipulation. 
409,3," The Fourth Circuit thus would reject the suggestion that a criminal conviction not only provides prima facie evidence but also 
raises collateral estoppel against antitrust defendants.  See Illinois v. Huckaba & Sons Constr. Co., 442 F. Supp. 56 (S.D. Ill. 
1977). "
411,4," Weinberger v. Retail Credit Co., 498 F.2d 552 (4th Cir. 1974), is in no way to the contrary.  Weinberger held merely that one 
whose claim is barred by an applicable statute of limitations cannot act as a class representative because he is not even a 
member of the class he seeks to represent.  498 F.2d at 556. Defendants do not contend that the claims of any of the plaintiffs in 
these actions are wholly barred by limitations."
411,5," The court is unpersuaded by defendants' arguments that members of the proposed gasoline dealer class have an interest in 
maintaining individual actions and have the financial ability to do so.  It seems clear that the choice before the court is essentially 
between allowing these actions to proceed as class actions and foreclosing the possibility of recovery to almost all would-be 
claimants.  It is unlikely that many members even of the proposed gasoline dealer class would undertake to pursue individual 
actions.  However, even assuming that they could do so, pursuing each claim in a separate action requiring most likely several 
months of trial time would place an enormous burden on judicial resources.  Thus, the court believes that these actions would 
best be maintained as class actions, provided they are manageable. "

] The interpretation of the effect of a release upon codefendants is based on the intention of the parties to the 
instrument.  Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 401 U.S. 321, 346-48, 28 L. Ed. 2d 77, 91 S. Ct. 795 (1971). 
Although the question of intention is one of fact which may involve individual questions concerning the circumstances 
surrounding the execution of the document, significant evidence of intention is the language employed by the parties.  See id. at 
347."
412,7, At the present time defendants give no indication of how many counterclaims they may seek to assert.
412,8," This issue, of course, goes to the question of impact as well as violation. "
413,9," The court considers it inappropriate to its class certification decision to speculate whether this case presents one of the ""limited 
circumstances"" under which a pass-on defense might be permitted.  See Illinois Brick, 431 U.S. at 724, 735-36; Hanover Shoe, 
392 U.S. at 494. Likewise, any potential conflicts between the gasoline dealer class and the other classes, as well as the possible assertion of an 
Illinois Brick indirect purchaser defense, concern the merits of the actions, not whether they should be maintained as class 
actions. "
414,10," The classes are composed either of business entities or of credit purchasers, both likely to have purchase records of some 
sort.  No claims are brought on behalf of cash purchasers of gasoline; a class of cash purchasers would present severe 
manageability problems.  See City of Philadelphia v. American Oil Co., 53 F.R.D. 45, 72 (D.N.J. 1971) (granting certification of 
classes of business purchasers but denying certification of a class of all consumer purchasers)."

415,13," The Ninth Circuit has adopted a reasoned and balanced approach to class actions, having had the opportunity to compare an 
action properly maintained as a class action with one not.  Compare Blackie v. Barrack, 524 F.2d 891 (9th Cir. 1975), cert.

415,14," To the extent that any of these cases approved generalized proof of injury and damage, this court must, as previously noted, 
disagree with their analysis.  However, a careful reading of the opinions indicates that many of the courts anticipated that 
common proof would demonstrate not only general market impact but also injury to each purchaser. "

420,2," Plaintiffs include four named plaintiffs and approximately 1,151 home buyers who obtained loans from the defendant during 
the period between January 1971 and December 1975. Over the same span, the defendant made loans to approximately 4,800 
home buyers who were not required to pay the attorney's fee charge because they retained the services of the defendant's law 
firm in the first instance."

421,8," Every member of plaintiffs' class purchased legal settlement services from an attorney other than the defendant's. Although 
the legal services purchased by plaintiffs from their own attorneys constitute a separate or distinct product, the additional loan 
review services paid for by the defendant do not, since they were purchased by plaintiffs merely as an incident to the loan 
transaction."
421,9," Contrary to plaintiffs' assertions, no evidence was introduced to demonstrate that the $ 100 charge collected by defendant and 
paid to its attorney exceeded the amounts charged by other attorneys for similar legal services. The defendant's only economic

firm, without any profit. J.A. at 329, 463."

422,13," The same federal regulation as is applicable here was involved in Forrest. 385 F. Supp. at 837. In addition to authorizing the 
charge for legal expenses, the state law in Forrest required the lender's attorney to certify that the property securing a loan was 
unencumbered.  Id. at 836-37. Maryland law appears to contain an analogous provision. See Regulation 09.05.50C of the 
Maryland Division of Building, Savings & Loan Associations Guide. We need not decide whether the state law provisions in 
Forrest and in this case impose identical Requirements on a lender, however, since Maryland law at least Authorizes the 
defendant to charge for legal expenses. See p. 933 & note 24 Infra."

422,16, 385 F.2d at 837 (emphasis added).
422,17," Plaintiffs have attempted to distinguish the findings in Forrest from the facts of this case on two grounds, both of which are 
spurious and unsupported by the evidence. First, relying on testimony by the defendant's president that borrowers ""benefited"" 
from the loan review services performed by the defendant's law firm, plaintiffs assert that these services were rendered to the 
borrowers and not to the defendant. App. Br. at 34. Not only is this testimony irrelevant to prove that the defendant's attorney 
acted as attorney for borrowers, it is also directly refuted by the testimony of plaintiffs' expert and of plaintiffs themselves. Their 
testimony conclusively demonstrates that borrowers did not purchase these legal services. See, e. g., J.A. at 46-47, 64-65, 76, 
86, 90, 275-76. The second purported distinction urged by plaintiffs is based on their two-fold assertion that here (unlike Forrest ) 
title insurance was generally available to the defendant's borrowers, and that where title insurance is available the lender has no 
need of an attorney. App. Br. at 34-35. The assertion that title insurance and loan review services are alternatives ignores the 
fact that the function of these legal services was to examine title binders and determine which encumbrances and easements 
were excepted from title insurance coverage. J.A. at 270-71. The testimony in this case amply demonstrated the need for such 
services. See, e. g., J.A. at 138-39, 149-52, 271-73."

L. Ed. 619 (1911)."
423,21, We do not decide this issue since we find that the defendant's practice is not unreasonable in purpose or effect.
423,22," The record reveals that borrowers selected the defendant as their lender for any one of a number of reasons, E. g., because it 
offered a competitive interest rate, J.A. at 36-37, 59; it enabled the borrower to save money, Id. at 74; or it was conveniently 
located, Id. at 87. None of these reasons suggests that borrowers were concerned about the attorney's fee charge."

424,," Legal expenses incurred to consummate a loan are ""reasonable,"" if not indispensable and required by law. See Regulation

Cert. denied, 419 U.S. 999, 95 S. Ct. 314, 42 L. Ed. 2d 273 (1974). We do not intend to imply, however, that a practice which is 
Not otherwise reasonable may be exempted from the antitrust laws merely because purportedly authorized by a state or federal 
regulation. ""(HN9[
] A) state does not give immunity to those who violate the Sherman Act by authorizing them to violate it, or 
by declaring that their action is lawful."" Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 351, 63 S. Ct. 307, 314, 87 L. Ed. 315 (1943); See also 
Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States, 410 U.S. 366, 372-74, 93 S. Ct. 1022, 35 L. Ed. 2d 359 (1973). We rely on the cited 
regulations only as further evidence that the defendant's practice was unmotivated by an anticompetitive purpose."
424,26," Under its prior practice, the defendant accepted settlements prepared by any attorney having the highest rating by Martindale-
Hubbell. J.A. at 332-35."
424,27," See, e. g., J.A. at 177-85, 271, 332, 329-30, 334-35."
424,28," The defendant retained the Maryland law firm of Lancaster, Bland, Eisele & Herring. Several of the name partners of this firm 
have held, and continue to hold, high corporate positions in the defendant association, and one serves as its general counsel. 
We do not address the propriety of the defendant's decision to retain this law firm under any legal standard governing the 
defendant's business conduct other than that provided by the antitrust laws. "
425,29," The differing legal needs of borrowers are exemplified by two of the named plaintiffs in this case. The title binder issued to 
them contained four separate exceptions which jeopardized the security of title to their property. J.A. at 138-44. We note that, as 
a practical matter, the defendant must retain its own counsel for loans like those made to these plaintiffs, since, owing to lack of 
privity, the lender may have no recourse against borrowers' counsel for negligent certification of title. See, e. g., Anderson v. 
Boone County Abstract Co., 418 S.W.2d 123 (S. Ct.Mo.1967) (En banc )."
425,30," Qualified attorneys were in fact excluded under the defendant's prior practice. J.A. at 329-30, 334-35."
425,31," Indeed, one reason for the defendant's decision to institute the practice of retaining its own counsel was its dissatisfaction with 
inexperienced attorneys selected by borrowers. See J.A. at 271-73."
425,32," For example, if a lender precluded its borrowers from selecting their own counsel, its designation of settlement attorneys 
would likely be anticompetitive and tend to inflate settlement costs. The defendant in this case, however, has not imposed any 
restriction on its borrowers' right to counsel."
425,1," Nor is the possibility disproved on the ground that in any event the association would have this work done by X. Management 
may hesitate to insist on a particular counsel, as against the possible outcry from members or shareholders, if the annual report "
426,," shows a very large sum paid to this lawyer by the association. But if a large part of that lawyer's income is recorded on his books 
as payments by a number of borrowers, and does not appear at all either on his books or the association's as a fee attributable 
to the association, that stills any possibility of embarrassing inquiry. The matter would be completely set at rest, of course, if the association adopted the suggestion of the majority opinion and 
chose a group of attorneys for this work."
426,2, Maj. op. at 935.
426,3," The leading opinion on reasonableness is flavored with intimations of bribery.  Standard Oil Company of New Jersey v. United 
States, 221 U.S. 1, 31 S. Ct. 502, 55 L. Ed. 619 (1911). In seeking rehearing, plaintiffs-appellants put it that this concurring opinion carves out new ground, which they should have 
opportunity to explore, that they had properly been proceeding on the theory that the antitrust laws are concerned with effects of 
conduct, not intent or laudable purpose, citing Sullivan, Antitrust (West Pub. St. Paul 1976) at 194, and that the existence of 
intent as an element in a criminal antitrust offense, such as was involved in Standard Oil, is not applicable in civil cases which 
remain governed by ""the general rule that a civil violation can be established by proof of either an unlawful purpose or an 
anticompetitive effect."" United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422, n.13, 98 S. Ct. 2864, 2873, 57 L. Ed. 2d 854. 
In Gypsum Chief Justice Burger goes on to say: ""Of course, considerations of intent may play an important role in divining the 
actual nature and effect of the alleged anticompetitive conduct. See Chicago Board of Trade v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 
238, 38 S. Ct. 242, 62 L. Ed. 683 (1918). Thus cited is pertinent observation of Justice Brandeis (246 U.S. at 238, 38 S. Ct. at 
244): But the legality of an agreement or regulation cannot be determined by so simple a test, as whether it restrains competition. 
Every agreement concerning trade, every regulation of trade, restrains. To bind, to restrain, is of their very essence. The true 
test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or 
whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition. To determine that question the court must ordinarily consider 
the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and after the restraint was imposed; the 
nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable. The history of the restraint, the evil believed to exist, the reason for 
adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, are all relevant facts. This is not because a good 
intention will save an otherwise objectionable regulation or the reverse; but because knowledge of intent may help the court to 
interpret facts and to predict consequences. It is hardly new law to say that context and purpose guide in determining whether the agreement or practice under consideration 
goes beyond the quality of incidental restraint, a familiar and not forbidden occurrence, and takes on the color of an 
unreasonable restraint, with a predominantly anticompetitive character. "
432,1," The plaintiffs have sought to discredit the Schaefer case on the ground that it erroneously interpreted the ""savings clause"" in 
the '34 Act to explicitly prohibit any claim under the Sherman Act. The statute in question, Section 28(a) of the '34 Act, 15 U.S.C. 
§ 78bb(a), provides in pertinent part: The rights and remedies provided by this chapter shall be in addition to any and all other rights and remedies that may exist 
at law or in equity; but no person permitted to maintain a suit for damages under the provisions of this chapter shall recover, 
through satisfaction of judgment in one or more actions, a total amount in excess of his actual damages on account of the 
act complained of. The Schaefer district court concluded that because the damage limitation is found immediately after the savings clause, ""only 
single damage remedies were to be preserved [and] thus, even if there once existed a Sherman Act cause of action for market 
manipulation, it was not saved by the later Securities Acts."" Schaefer, supra, 326 F. Supp. at 1192. The court then invoked the 
same statutory language to refuse punitive damages, stating ""it is now authoritatively established that only actual, and not 
punitive, damages are recoverable."" Id. at 1193. Plaintiffs distort the precedents when they state generally that the Schaefer interpretation of the '34 Act damage limitation 
language has been ""overwhelmingly repudiated by subsequent decisions."" Plaintiffs' Memorandum of Law at 32. Plaintiffs are 
correct only on the matter of the Schaefer position toward punitive damages. See, e.g., Flaks v. Koegel, 504 F.2d 702, 707 (2d 
Cir. 1974). There has been no challenge to the first Schaefer hypothesis that Section 28(a) demonstrates a legislative intent to 
forestall treble damage remedies for activities cognizable under the '34 Act. "
433,2," The Congress has never directly addressed the management-strengthening technique of the combined issuer/outsider tender 
offer, and the legislative history of the Williams Act seems to contemplate only the traditional ""hostile"" takeover bid. However, the 
same report which explains the tender offer legislation contains a discussion of additional investor protection devices, and the 
theory there expressed sheds some light on the instant problem. Immediately following the section on tender offer is the 
rationale for a '34 Act amendment which broadens disclosure requirements when a corporation repurchases its own shares. 
Within this section there is specific allusion to the purpose of management in pursuing such a course, and acknowledgement 
that ""repurchase programs . . . may . . . be utilized by managements to preserve or strengthen their control by counteracting 
tender offers or other attempted takeovers."" H.R. Rep. No. 1711, supra, U.S. Code Cong. & Admin.  News at 2814-15. Given 
that the Congress has explicitly recognized management's interest in preserving its own incumbency and has deemed it to be 
adequately dealt with by requiring full and fair disclosure to the shareholders, it does not seem antithetical to any Congressional 
purpose that the issuer and an outside corporation might combine to strengthen management so long as the shareholder is fully 
apprised of that aim.  Moreover, juxtaposition of the two subjects -- traditional ""takeover"" bid and issuer repurchase -- within the 
same explanatory text lends support to the idea that the Congress would consider a combination purchase by issuer and 
outsider to be within the purview of the securities law. "
438,1," Plaintiff tenders the stunning suggestion that Kodak waived the right to make this motion by failing to move for a directed 
verdict at the end of both trial phases. As reflected, however, by the consultations preparing a briefing schedule for the instant 
motion, the record amply protects Kodak in this respect. "

441,6," ""In order to sustain the charge of unlawful monopolization, Berkey must have established by a preponderance of the evidence 
three essential elements: (1) that Kodak at relevant times possessed monopoly power in a relevant market; (2) that Kodak 
acquired this power or maintained it by exclusionary or anticompetitive means or used it for exclusionary or anticompetitive 
purposes; and (3) that Berkey suffered injury in its business as a result of Kodak's monopoly power and exclusionary or 
anticompetitive conduct."" (Tr. 16333). ""You must draw a distinction here between practices which tend to exclude or restrict competition on the one hand, and the 
success of a business which reflects only a superior product, a well run business, or luck, on the other."" (Tr. 16367). ""The kind of conduct which concerns us here is conduct which unnecessarily excludes or handicaps competitors. This is conduct 
which does not benefit consumers by making a better product or services available, or in other ways, and instead has the effect 
of impairing competition. To sum up, your task is to determine whether Kodak gained, maintained, or used monopoly power in a 
relevant market by arrangements and policies which instead of encouraging competition, were designed primarily to further 
Kodak's domination of the market."" (Tr. 16367-68). ""It can sometimes be difficult to determine the primary quality or nature of an act so as to classify it as either honestly industrial 
or as exclusionary or anticompetitive. Nevertheless you must be the judge. Given conduct may both help customers and hurt 
competitors. If this seems to be the case to you, you must ask yourselves whether it hurts competitors precisely because it 
appeals to consumers. That is, was the harm to competitors caused by customers' preference for the defendant's products? If 
so, the kind of conduct involved is not exclusionary or anticompetitive because the goal of Section 2 is to protect competition 
itself rather than a particular competitor's right to thrive. If a business does poorly because it is faced with vigorous competition, 
this is not unlawful. However, if the harm to competitors is caused by something other than the defendant's success in 
competing on the merits of its products and operations if the harm is caused primarily or substantially by the defendant's 
deliberate efforts to injure or block competition then you may find that the conduct was anticompetitive."" (Tr. 16368-69). ""There is no law that makes it illegal to introduce products which are physically dependent on each other, at least under ordinary 
circumstances. However, if you find Kodak possessed monopoly power in film or in cameras, and if you conclude based on all 
the evidence that in either instance the decision to introduce products in the form of a system was primarily dictated neither by 
technological necessity nor by a desire to serve the needs of customers, you may find that Kodak engaged in exclusionary 
conduct in the camera market, the film market or markets, the color print paper market or all of these."" (Tr. 16383). "

443,9," ""Standing alone, the fact that Kodak did not give advance warning of its new products to competitors would not entitle you to 
find that this conduct was exclusionary. Ordinarily a manufacturer has no duty to predisclose its new products in this fashion. It is 
an ordinary and acceptable business practice to keep one's new developments a secret. However, if you find that Kodak had 
monopoly power in cameras or in film, and if you find that this power was so great as to make it impossible for a competitor to 
compete with Kodak in the camera market unless it could offer products similar to Kodak's, you may decide whether in the light 
of other conduct you determine to be anticompetitive, Kodak's failure to predisclose was on balance an exclusionary course of 
conduct."" (Tr. 16392)."
443,10, Memorandum in Support of Motion 7.
443,11," The claim that the existence of rights secured to innovators under patent and trade secret laws mandates a different result is 
not persuasive. Far from creating a total screen against the application of the antitrust laws, the rules on patents and trade 
secrets allow a limited exception to a general rule against monopoly. Transparent-Wrap Machinery Corp. v. Stokes & Smith Co., 
329 U.S. 637, 640-41, 67 S. Ct. 610, 91 L. Ed. 563 (1947); Precision Instrument Manufacturing Co. v. Automatic Maintenance 
Machinery Co., 324 U.S. 806, 816, 65 S. Ct. 993, 89 L. Ed. 1381 (1945). "
444,12," ""Kodak had no obligation under the antitrust laws to see that a new product was superior to the old. That question of quality, 
In and of itself, is not in issue here. Berkey's thesis in this respect is that the new products were introduced so as to unbalance 
competition obsoleting prior systems such as the 126, and postponing competitors' chances to compete for the sale of the new 
systems, rather than to give consumers something genuinely better. The attempt to show that a new product such as Kodacolor 
II was not an improvement over existing products is made as a part of the effort to prove this claim. Of course, it is for you the 
jury to decide along the way whether the evidence shows that the new products were inferior, superior, or essentially 
comparable. But remember that this is not an ultimate question for its own sake. The ultimate question to which it goes is 
whether the new product introductions were primarily a form of honestly industrial competition, designed to produce something 
more attractive for the customer, or primarily exclusionary and anticompetitive in the sense of these terms which is now familiar 
to you."" (Tr. 16389)."
444,13," ""In some cases where it is not immediately apparent whether particular conduct which Berkey has complained about is 
exclusionary, you will be required to determine whether the conduct is primarily an effort to attract customers or primarily an 
effort to undermine competitors. In these situations, you may consider the evidence bearing on Kodak's motivation and 
objectives to help you ascertain the primary thrust of the conduct in question. ""In these cases the question is not whether Kodak specifically intended to attain the end result of monopoly power. Berkey does 
not have to prove that in order to establish monopolization. On the other hand, a mere showing that Kodak intended to do the 
actual things it did may not be sufficient to show whether or not the actions were anticompetitive. The issue may then be whether 
the primary objective pursued by Kodak management in engaging in the conduct was exclusionary or predominantly customer-
oriented. ""Some conduct may speak for itself; that is, it is only capable of being understood in one way, whether this be as exclusionary or 
as honestly competitive. Other conduct may be harder to evaluate. It is in cases of the latter sort that evidence of purpose or 
motivation may help you tell whether the conduct was exclusionary. ""Since Kodak is a corporation, rather than a living person, it can only act through its officers and employees. Similarly, it is only 
these officers and employees who have an intent in the sense in which we ordinarily use the term. Therefore, if you have any 
doubt as to whether particular conduct is exclusionary in a given relevant market, you may consider the intent of these people in "
445,," making your decision. However, you may only consider the expressed intentions of an individual Kodak officer or employee as to 
a subject which was within his area of authority. For example, you would not accept an expression of intention by an ordinary 
worker on a Kodak assembly line as an authoritative indication of the intent behind Kodak's introduction of the 110 system. 
When you consider evidence of intent for the purpose of evaluating whether Kodak's conduct was exclusionary, you need not 
find that the individuals intended to achieve the ultimate result: monopolization. It is enough for you to find that the conduct was 
intended to exclude or forestall or injure competition for you to adjudge such ambiguous conduct to be exclusionary. I repeat that 
if the conduct was clearly exclusionary, or clearly innocent, you need not even consider the intentions of individual officers and 
employees of Kodak for this purpose."" (Tr. 16370-72)."

arrangements among non-competitors, demonstrate that such transactions may be barred under section 1 of the Sherman Act, 
or under the less stringent standards of sections 3 and 7 of the Clayton Act, if they ""foreclose the competitors of either party from 
a segment of the market otherwise open to them . . . ,"" thereby acting as ""a ""clog on competition' . . . which ""deprive(s) rivals of a 
fair opportunity to compete.' "" Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 324, 82 S. Ct. 1502, 1523, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1962)

448,19," ""The traditional framework of analysis under § 1 of the Sherman Act is familiar and does not require extended discussion. 
Section 1 prohibits ""(e) very contract, combination . . ., or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce.' Since the early years of 
this century a judicial gloss on this statutory language has established the ""rule of reason' as the prevailing standard of analysis. 
. . . Under this rule, the factfinder weighs all the circumstances of a case in deciding whether a restrictive practice should be 
prohibited as imposing an unreasonable restraint on competition."" (Footnote omitted.)"
448,20," The assumption does not seem compelled by any unambiguous authority, nor inevitable on fundamental antitrust 
conceptions. The law tolerates ""lawful"" monopolies, but scarcely cherishes them. The drawback in any monopoly is its 
regrettable exception to the primary value of competitive enterprise. The regret stems from the intertwined evils of monopoly: 
power to exclude competition and, as its corollary and ultimate mischief, power to set Prices unrestrained by competitors. United 
States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 571, 86 S. Ct. 1698, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778 (1966); United States v. E. I. DuPont & Co., 351 
U.S. 377, 391, 76 S. Ct. 994, 100 L. Ed. 1264 (1956). Where a monopolist becomes an unlawful monopolist by engaging in "
449,," exclusionary or anticompetitive conduct, the injured customer paying the monopolist's price, if it exceeds what a competitive 
price would be, could argue strongly for a right of recovery whether or not the anticompetitive conduct of the monopolist is ""in"" 
the same market or is ""merely"" aimed at unlawful results in some related market, as in United States v. Griffith, 334 U.S. 100, 68 
S. Ct. 941, 92 L. Ed. 1236 (1948). It would appear not to offend, but rather to buttress, Sherman Act policies to fasten liability 
upon an unlawful monopoly for achieving the ultimate wrong of charging a monopolist's excessive prices. As appears below, 
however, it has not seemed necessary to go this far in the instant case with respect to film. Later, with respect to color print 
paper, the court again eschews that possible extension. There, the finding as to liability as well as damages is held infirm. While 
one misuse of the power over color paper by leveraging in another market is sustained, this is found insufficient either to hold 
Kodak liable or to justify exacting of damages for asserted overcharges on the paper. It is not in any event an instance of 
anticompetitive conduct to acquire or maintain monopoly power Within the relevant market."

450,23," ""Since . . . (the decisions in Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 221 U.S. 1, 31 S. Ct. 502, 55 L. Ed. 619 (1911), and American 
Tobacco Co. v. United States, 221 U.S. 106, 31 S. Ct. 632, 55 L. Ed. 663 (1911)) it has been accepted law that not all contracts 
which in fact put an end to existing competition are unlawful. Starting, however, with the authoritative premise that all contracts 
fixing prices are unconditionally prohibited, the only possible difference between them and a monopoly is that while a monopoly 
necessarily involves an equal, or even greater, power to fix prices, its mere existence might be thought not to constitute an 
exercise of that power. That distinction is nevertheless purely formal; it would be valid only so long as the monopoly remained 
wholly inert; it would disappear as soon as the monopoly began to operate; for, when it did that is, as soon as it began to sell at 
all it must sell at some price and the only price at which it could sell is a price which it itself fixed. Thereafter the power and its 
exercise must needs coalesce. Indeed it would be absurd to condemn such contracts unconditionally, and not to extend the 
condemnation to monopolies; for the contracts are only steps toward that entire control which monopoly confers; they are really 
partial monopolies."" United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, 148 F.2d 416, 427-28 (2d Cir. 1945)."

453,28," Plaintiff stresses that CP&P stayed with a five-step process of its own for some period of time not shown distinctly in the 
record. This fact has been explained, however, on grounds that do not help plaintiff. The sinister implications Berkey would decry 
are not made visible by the evidence."
453,29," Plaintiff has preserved throughout the position, not accepted by this court, that a defendant shown to have monopoly power 
must shoulder the burden of justifying it as a condition ""thrust upon"" it in Judge Learned Hand's Alcoa phrase. "
454,30," Berkey duly excepted, and preserves its exception, to the court's refusal to instruct that the amount of the price difference 
should without more be taken as the measure of damages. "
455,31," Defendant characterizes other prayers for injunctive relief e.g., relating to patents and claims for technological disclosures as 
seeking ""divestiture."" Doubting that the label fits, but finding it makes no difference in the end, the court treats these aspects 
elsewhere. Plaintiff does not treat under this rubric the proposal to require the dedication of the trademarks Kodak, Kodacolor, 
Ektacolor, Kodachrome, Ektachrome, Instamatic, and Pocket Instamatic, but the court finds it convenient to deal with this 
proposal here. "
458,32," This is but one of several reasons for overruling the proposed provisions effectively to nullify a list of patents held by Kodak 
embraced in a separate heading in the plaintiff's petition. One aspect of these provisions covers the patents arising out of the 
magicube and flipflash programs. Berkey's past ability to circumvent these patents undercuts any claim of future harm stemming 
from the no longer novel technology. The threat of an infringement action by Kodak against Berkey adverted to in Berkey's 
papers gives slight pause, but does not require relief now; in any future action Berkey is entitled to attempt to prove patent 
misuse by Kodak barring it from enforcement. The remaining portion of plaintiff's ambiguously framed proposal on patents would 
apparently bar Kodak from enforcing any patents it now owns or acquires in the next ten years on its major lines of products 
related to amateur photography. Patents were at most a minor part of the evidence that led the jury to find, and the court to 
affirm, that the flash programs were unreasonable restraints of trade and exclusionary conduct. There is no finding, and no 
warrant in our record for finding, a persistent course of patent abuse that would augur future harm to anyone, much less Berkey 
in its new situation. The proposed relief affecting assertion of patent rights will not be embodied in the final decree. "
460,33," The court's conclusion, Supra, that the use of the backprint to injure photofinishers is insufficient to support the verdict of 
liability for monopolization of color print paper does not bar the award of equitable relief. The record amply supports a finding 
that future harm to Berkey by this wrongful use of Kodak's monopoly power in color print paper is threatened. "

468,1," There are two types of UCs, analytical and preparative.  The difference between them lies in the fact that the analytical UC 
contains a series of optical systems which enable viewing of the ongoing process. During operation, the UC develops a force of about one-half million times the force of gravity.  Its operative parts include vacuum 
and refrigeration systems, an electrical drive unit which spins the rotor, and elaborate electronic circuitry to control the rotor's 
speed.  The aluminum or titanium rotor, into which tubes holding the sample are inserted, is enclosed within a chamber defined 
by a steel barrier over two inches thick and is machined to very close specifications to enable its rotation at ultrahigh speeds.  
The UC's outer appearance is somewhat similar to a photocopying machine - without the collator. There are at least two potential dangers arising from operation of the UC.  Rotor explosions can cause injury to anything or 
anyone in its wake.  The second occurs when hazardous samples being analyzed escape into the atmosphere and contaminate 
the surrounding area.  Thus, proper UC servicing is critical to ensure safe operation."

(see Appendix A).  This charge appears to be as aberrant as that for the 11/12/73 entry which occurred after the ""policy change"" 
went into effect where Spectrofuge was charged nothing in a situation where a Beckman customer would have paid $ 96."
475,31," For a discussion of the 5/30/73 entry see note 30, supra."
475,32," For a discussion of the 11/12/73 entry, see note 30, supra. "
476,33, This letter was not allowed into evidence. 
477,34," PX 30.  The policy outlined in this memo is consistent with that set forth in an August 13, 1973 letter from Williams, Beckman's 
District Service Manager in Atlanta, to the Purchasing Agent at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Tennessee who was 
apparently contemplating in-house service of UCs.  The portion relevant to proration reads: . . . I am writing to explain our policy with regard to your servicing the Beckman Spinco centrifuges at the hospital."
477,*," * * The warranty on the parts supplied would be changed somewhat, especially in regard to the drive units.  When the 
instrument is serviced and maintained by us, a replacement drive is pro-rated according to the revolutions it has done.  As 
many other malfunctions in the instrument over which we would have no control can cause drive problems, the pro-ration is 
changed considerably and the exchange drives would cost more.  The same policy would apply to exchange printed circuit 
boards and the like. PX 102.  Spectrofuge points to the fact that Beckman prorated for NIH-Maryland whose in-house personnel serviced 
instruments.  This matter is discussed in note 100, infra."
477,35," At trial, plaintiff voluntarily withdrew its claim under § 3 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.A. § 14, and the District Court directed a 
verdict against Spectrofuge on its § 13 Robinson-Patman claim, 15 U.S.C.A. § 13. Spectrofuge does not appeal from this ruling."
477,36," See text at note 18, supra."
477,37," See text at note 19, supra."
477,38," This figure derives from PX 230A, Appendix A: Differential in drive costs $ 3,561.77 Less: amount reimbursed by customer"
477,975," .21 Cost on drives $ 2,586.56 Total labor & travel "

478,39," See text at note 28, supra."
478,40, Spectrofuge's witnesses admitted that they never stocked UC drives.
478,41," Beckman's position is that Spectrofuge did not prove injury in fact as to the Alabama, Houston, and NIH contracts.  (For a 
discussion of the Beckman-NIH contract requirements, see note 100, infra.) The District Court agreed with Beckman on 
Alabama and Houston and ordered what in effect was a partial judgment n.o.v. with respect to those claims.  See text 
accompanying note 65, infra. We agree with Beckman as to the NIH contract as well. Spectrofuge had no employees located in 
Maryland.  It had one experienced employee, Jackson, who may have been willing to relocate to Maryland.  Autry, while 
qualified, was stationed in North Carolina servicing Research Triangle area contracts.  Gonzales -- apparently nothing more than 
an errand runner -- could not have handled the service work.  Furthermore, the proration policy did not prevent Spectrofuge from 
bidding for work in locations where it had personnel. Thus, the jury awarded lost future profits for a two-year period on a contract 
on which Spectrofuge had never bid, at an institution located in an area where it had no service personnel, and which at times 
required for its performance more men on a daily basis than were employed by Spectrofuge in toto (see note 100, infra). Thus, 
quite apart from other failures of proof discussed in detail below, the ""lost"" NIH contract, resting as it does on the speculation, ""if 
we had bid we would have won,"" was not proved with any degree of certainty to have been the result of Beckman's conduct. "
479,," That is to say, the evidence could not support a finding that Beckman's drive policy materially contributed to Spectrofuge's failure 
to bid. Terrell v. Household Goods Carriers' Bureau, 5 Cir., 1974, 494 F.2d 16, 20."
479,42," We used DX 173AA-173XX to form the basis of this chart since the parts orders exhibits submitted by the plaintiff (PX 64a-f, 
PX 65-67, PX 138B, PX 151, PX 152) were hopelessly disorganized.  See note 47, infra."
479,43," Spectrofuge's agreement with the University of Florida (PX 317H) covered two (Models LS-230 and LS-233) liquid scintillation 
counters under Dr. Cerutti's personal control, both priced at $ 435 per year.  According to Dr. Cerutti, there were approximately 
six Beckman liquid scintillation counters in the Biochemistry Department including his two.  Tr. 1153-54.  Del Valle testified as 
follows: Q Was the contract renewed on those two liquid scintillation counters while you were at the University of Florida and Dr. 
Cerutti? A No, sir. Q Did you have any other liquid scintillation counters up there at the University of Florida? A Yes, sir. Q Besides these two? A Yes, sir. Q How many others did you have on the contract? A I think there were three more at that time under contract. Q Have those contracts been renewed at the University of Florida? A These three others?  No. Q How much did the contract run on the liquid scintillation counters? A Approximately $ 1500 [sic] apiece. Q Do you know whether or not there were other liquid scintillation counter -- Beckman liquid scintillation counters at the 
University of Florida in the Biochemistry Department besides these two and the three we talked about, which is five?  Were 
there any other liquid scintillation counters up there? A I think there is two more, possibly three. Q Did you have contracts on those? A No, sir. "
480,," Tr. 1455-57. We have compared Spectrofuge's 1973-74 University of Florida contract (PX 317H) with that for 1974-75.  The only instrument 
""lost"" other than the two Cerutti liquid scintillation counters is a ""Model E"" instrument for Dr. Fried (contract price $ 660).  We 
were under the impression that an ""E"" was an ultracentrifuge. In any event, we have looked at all the contracts in a folder 
entitled ""Contracts Univ. of Fla. [Pltf's] 317H"" and can find none which covers any other ""Model LS-230,"" ""Model LS-233,"" or 
""liquid scintillation counters"" so described, none with contract prices at $ 435 per instrument, none at $ 500 per instrument (just 
rounding off $ 435) and certainly none at $ 1500 per instrument.  Thus, we are at a loss as to how Spectrofuge arrived at the $ 
3,500 figure.  Plaintiff's counsel stated during closing argument that his client lost seven contracts at the University of Florida at $ 
500 each for a total of $ 3,500. After the jury returned the verdict, the Court noted that it had given plaintiff damages in excess of those asked for during closing 
argument.  Counsel responded, ""They had all the contracts back there.  I don't know what they did back there, but they had all 
the contracts."" As best as we can determine, the jury was out for about four hours.  If the contracts were presented to the jurors 
in the same manner presented to us, see note 47, infra, we have a fair idea of what the jury ""did back there."""
480,44," The credit hold was instituted on July 27, 1973 and was lifted on August 17.  See the following subsection."
480,45, Del Valle did not specify the number or type of instruments lost from the service contract.
480,46," We have compared Spectrofuge's 1973-74 Union Carbide contract (PX 270) with that for 1974-75 (PX 317).  Other than the 
absence of the instruments located in Rockville, Maryland (see item (3) discussed below), we can find only the following 
instruments missing for 1974-75: Annual Instrument Property No. Contract Price UC Model L Y138100 $ 145.50 Amino acid analyzer Model 120 Y125887"
480,387, .03 Amino acid analyzer Model 120-C 
481,, Y154141
481,576, .18 Sequencer Model 890 Y164866
481,645," .05 Total $1,753.76 There is no indication in the record that these four instruments were the ones under Dr. Popp's control.  Even if they were, we 
cannot determine how Spectrofuge arrived at the $ 2,277.51 figure."
481,47," We were unable to match an order for a ""refrigeration cam"" with any of the orders contained in DX 173A-173XX, Appendix B, 
or with PX 64a-f, PX 65-67, PX 138B, PX 151, PX 152 which were parts orders introduced by plaintiff.  Perhaps a refrigeration 
cam is known by some other name.  In any event, Spectrofuge's briefs point us to no documents from which we could determine 
any specifics on this delay other than two pages of del Valle's testimony and the Union Carbide contract itself which does not 
include an indication of the instrument owner (i. e., Dr. Faust). The problems we have had in reviewing this case, those set forth in notes 43 and 46, supra, to mention just a few, compel us to 
comment on the manner in which both parties presented this case on appeal. We are the first to encourage all to minimize the cost of reproduction.  However, out of hundreds of documents which we 
received, only about 115 exhibits were reproduced in the appendix on appeal and the vast majority of those (PX 166-230) 
comprised the backup documentation for the summary chart of PX 230A set forth here as Appendix A.  An example of 
""selective"" appendix printing was the exclusion of several credit hold documents which had to be retrieved from the files to nail 
down the chronology and understand the testimony.  Some exhibits were illegible and the parties did not agree on and submit to 
the court below or to us a clean typed version of the illegible documents. The exhibits not printed in the appendix were placed in folders and neither the folders nor their contents were presented in any 
discernible order. Plaintiff's exhibits were mixed in with defendant's exhibits; documents received in evidence were in some 
instances mixed in with those excluded.  A University of Florida contract folder contained contracts with the EPA and Coulter 
Diagnostics.  Finding an exhibit outside the appendix was similar to but not as much fun as an Easter egg hunt.  Looking at the 
exhibits themselves was necessary because the District Judge for reasons which seem to us to be very doubtful refused to allow 
them to be read to the jury during the trial.  This problem was further exacerbated by the fact that the trial transcript was not 
corrected except for a post-trial stipulation with regard to plaintiff's closing argument.  The transcript errors often threw us off "
482,," course.  In other cases, the small exhibit identifying slips were separated from the documents and were lying loose in the folders.  
Thus, we were unable to identify some exhibits by any number and to match them with testimony. In addition, the parties left from the printed appendix testimony which we considered to be critical.  Our review of the entire trial 
transcript was therefore necessary.  (Chunks of transcript were stapled together and had to be unstapled before we could read 
it.) Consequently, the testimony and exhibit appendices were virtually useless. In HN1[
] complex antitrust cases -- traditionally heavy paper litigation -- necessitating as this one does a thorough review of all 
the evidence, Boeing Co. v. Shipman, 5 Cir., 1969, 411 F.2d 365, 375 n. 16 (en banc), the manner in which a case is presented 
to us is terribly important.  Federal courts are sufficiently burdened as it is without having to spend hours finding and organizing 
the parties' evidence.  Litigants can expect from the Court a detailed review of the record, but when it is presented in the fashion 
experienced by us that expectation asks too much.  Such appellate presentations tax both our resources and patience and 
reduce the parties' chances to receive an expeditious decision.  This matter would have had more serious consequences had it 
been necessary for us to decide the individual injury in fact questions. Parties are entitled to expect consideration by the Court of the record.  For the Court to do that the record must be available in a 
form which, saving excess printing costs, enables Judges to see and hopefully assimilate what a party (or both) thought was 
significant.  What we cannot find, and hence cannot see, we can hardly understand.  And what we cannot understand through 
the fault of litigants results not alone in possible damage to the interests of litigants, but to the law itself which builds on case by 
case with the expectation that counsel have done their job."
482,48," We assume that this figure was reached by adding the contract prices for all the instruments designated as ""MAN Program, 
Rockville, Md."" on PX 270."
482,49, We wonder if this is a reference to the Center for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta.
482,50," There was at least one manufacture of UC drives other than Beckman -- Morrow.  However, Beckman's rotor warranty was 
voided when a non-Beckman drive was installed in one of its UCs.  Spectrofuge did not want to risk invalidating this warranty by 
purchasing drives from another source. "
483,51," Del Valle stated that Spectrofuge at times carried an inventory amounting to $ 6,000-7,000; at others, its inventory would be 
depleted.  Spectrofuge's federal tax returns showed no valuation figures for inventory. When del Valle worked for Beckman, he 
carried in his car inventory valued between $ 3,000-4,000."
483,52," PX 129 is a May 1, 1973 letter from Tucker (Beckman's sales representative in the Raleigh-Durham area) to Jollett 
(Beckman's District Sales Manager in Atlanta) in which Tucker advised: It is all right now, if the Packard salesman calls and gives me a PO [purchase order?] to sell an instrument for them? Evidently I get this message from service when Spectrofuge can call them, give them a PO and have our service install a 
stock drive for one of their customers on our centrifuge.  Why are we forced to support a direct competitor? They are NOT a 
customer but in direct competition to our service. Spectrofuge i.e. Larry Autry, is even recommending competitive 
instruments to people now.  Mr. Autry recommended to a doctor at Duke that he buy a Unicam spectrophotometer only two 
weeks ago and then had the audacity to tell me that he did so. If a sales competitor wants a piece of our equipment he buys it through sales channels and does not receive special 
consideration.  We are supporting Spectrofuge by selling from service inventory and ourselves paying the costs in inventory 
to sell to Spectrofuge, our competitor. That's the dumbest thing I have ever heard.  Are we trying to force ourselves out of 
the service business?  The smartest thing we can do is treat them like a sales customer and ship from sales stock from 
sales depots at list price plus shipping. Let's quit ripping ourselves off. Emphasis in original.  As far as we can tell from the record, Spectrofuge continued to receive drives out of service inventory and 
never had to pay list price for them."
483,53," See text at note 28, supra."
483,54," The del Valle letters (see also items 5, 7, 10, 13) were sent certified mail. "
484,55," Williams testified that during this conversation, he told del Valle to call Anderson in California to straighten it out.  Del Valle 
denied this but confirmed that Williams had said that the matter had to be resolved by corporate credit. "
485,56," This figure was probably reached by adding the prices on Spectrofuge's unsuccessful bid on this work (DX 126) which total $ 
3,212 and rounding off the total."
485,57," During the hold, a drive in a Beckman UC failed and the Hospital's instrument was down.  Beckman refused to install the drive 
based on Anderson's instructions.  The Hospital ordered a drive directly from Beckman but was told it would have to pay the list 
price of $ 4,200 until Beckman, upon its receipt, determined that the drive was in repairable condition.  Credit would then be 
given to the Hospital who would ultimately pay the exchange price. The Hospital, put off by this price, cancelled the order and 
there is no doubt that Spectrofuge lost the VA contract at least in part because of the drive problem.  Another factor causing 
Beckman to lose this bid was its inability to service the VA's gamma radiation counter, although the evidence indicates that the 
VA would have accepted a partial bid from Spectrofuge for the UC work alone."
485,58, The parties post-trial stipulation to correct the record forms the basis for these figures.
485,59," See text following note 32 and note 38, supra."
485,60," See notes 47 and 48, supra, and accompanying text."
485,61," See note 43, supra, and accompanying text. "
486,62," See note 46, supra, and accompanying text."
486,63," When we do this multiplication we get $ 59,450.  As to NIH, Houston and Alabama, see notes 18, 19, 36, 37 and 41, supra, 
and accompanying text."
486,64," See note 57, supra, and accompanying text."
486,65," The Trial Court apparently reached these figures by applying a 20% profit figure to the Alabama and Houston claims, instead 
of 20.5%.  See text at note 63, supra. "
487,66," As pointed out in note 41, supra, the order to remit amounted to a partial JNOV since it was based on insufficiency of the 
evidence.  See text at note 65, supra. Because of this, the result we reach in Parts IV and V, infra, and the Supreme Court's 
intervening decision in Donovan v. Penn Shipping Co., 1977, 429 U.S. 648, 97 S. Ct. 835, 51 L. Ed. 2d 112, the question of 
whether Spectrofuge can challenge on appeal the propriety of a remittitur order to which it agreed is totally foreclosed."
487,67," We agree with Beckman that it was entitled to an instruction on the ""dangerous probability"" element."
487,68," See the ""asterisked"" footnote at the beginning of this opinion. "

We are also aware that there is a good deal of commentary devoted to the question of whether market definition should be 
required in attempt cases.  E. g., Cooper, Attempts and Monoplization: A Mildly Expansionary Answer to the Prophylactic Riddle 
of Section 2, 72 Mich.L.Rev. 373, 384, 418 (1974); Blecher, Attempt to Monopolize Under Section 2 of the Sherman Act:

Relevant Market Concept in Conspiracy to Monopolize Cases under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 44 Univ. of Chi.L.Rev. 805 
(1977).  Whatever the merits or demerits on both sides of the controversy, the question is settled in the Fifth Circuit -- at least 
until this Court en banc or the Supreme Court rules otherwise."
488,70," In Boeing Co. v. Shipman, 5 Cir., 1969, 411 F.2d 365, 374-75 (en banc), this Court set the standard of review which is 
applicable to the present case: HN6[
] On motions for directed verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict the Court should consider all of the 
evidence -- not just that evidence which supports the non-mover's case -- but in the light and with all reasonable inferences 
most favorable to the party opposed to the motion.  If the facts and inferences point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor 
of one party that the Court believes that reasonable men could not arrive at a contrary verdict, granting of the motions is 
proper.  On the other hand, if there is substantial evidence opposed to the motions, that is, evidence of such quality and 
weight that reasonable and fair-minded men in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach different conclusions, the 
motions should be denied, and the case submitted to the jury.  HN7[
] A mere scintilla of evidence is insufficient to 
present a question for the jury.  The motions for directed verdict and judgment n. o. v. should not be decided by which side 
has the better of the case, nor should they be granted only when there is a complete absence of probative facts to support 
a jury verdict.  There must be a conflict in substantial evidence to create a jury question.  However, it is the function of the 
jury as the traditional finder of the facts, and not the Court, to weigh conflicting evidence and inferences, and determine the 
credibility of witnesses. (Footnotes deleted.)"
488,71," Spectrofuge alleged in its first complaint that it was ""engaged in the business of servicing ultracentrifuges manufactured and 
sold"" by Beckman.  Its amended complaint states that Spectrofuge is ""engaged in the business of servicing the more 
sophisticated or complex scientific instruments and equipment manufactured and/or sold"" by Beckman. "
489,72," Tr. 8.  The Atlanta district also encompassed Tennessee and South Carolina, and excluded the southern half of Mississippi."
489,73," The Silver Springs district encompassed Washington, D.C., Maryland, Virginia, and the five northern counties of West Virginia.  
Tr. 980."
489,74," We point out in passing that Spectrofuge sought and the jury awarded damages for the loss of future contracts in Houston, 
Texas, which is outside both the Atlanta and Silver Springs districts, and in Bethesda, Maryland (location of the National Institute 
of Health), which is outside the Atlanta district."
489,75," Cross-elasticity of demand is the responsiveness of the consumer to price changes among products which are reasonably 
interchangeable.  E.g., United States v. du Pont & Co., 1956, 351 U.S. 377, 394-95, 404, 76 S. Ct. 994, 100 L. Ed. 1264."
489,76," For a discussion of the scientific instrument market, see infra this section."
489,77," Dr. Kahn, Professor of Biochemistry at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, testified that he had serviced his own UCs, 
including the installation of a new drive."
489,78," Dr. Cerutti testified that because the parts delay caused him to cancel the Spectrofuge contracts on his two liquid scintillation 
counters, and because Beckman servicing was so expensive, his counters are no longer covered by service contracts and he 
calls Beckman only in emergencies. "
491,79," Cross-elasticity of supply (sometimes called supply substitutability) looks at competition from the production end instead of the 
consumer end (cross-elasticity of demand, see note 75, supra).  High cross-elasticities of supply and demand deter monopoly 
pricing.  ""A very high cross-elasticity of supply is a way of describing a condition in which the cost and rapidity of new entry are 
such that a monopolist of the product would have negligible power to increase its price above the competitive level.  The 
increase would evoke a prompt and substantial increase in the output of the product, as manufacturers of other products 
switched to production of his product."" Posner, Antitrust, 441 (1974).  Supply substitutability has been a significant factor in 
determining the relevant market in several cases.  United States v. Columbia Steel Co., 1948, 334 U.S. 495, 510-511, 68 S. Ct.

492,80," But see the letter quoted in text at note 8, supra."
492,81," This listing is taken from testimony and the Spectrofuge service contracts in evidence.  The majority of the contracts list the 
instruments by model number -- some of which are unfamiliar to us.  Thus, this list may not be all-inclusive."
492,82," See text at note 80, supra."
492,83," See items 5 and 6 in statistical discussion, infra."
492,84," For example, Spectrofuge did not bid on the liquid scintillation counter work at NIH-Maryland because it had no one available 
for the job.  Dawson was trained on these instruments but he did not want to move to Maryland.  A second example was 
Spectrofuge's failure to seek Vanderbilt University contracts when Monday, the Beckman employee servicing that institution, 
declined Spectrofuge's job offer."
492,85," Spectrofuge was further limited to servicing only those Beckman instruments which came on the market prior to del Valle's and 
Dawson's departure from Beckman.  Spectrofuge had no means to keep au courant on Beckman technology except through 
whatever literature Beckman furnished instrument owners.  Moreover, Spectrofuge never bid on instruments which were covered 
by Beckman's first-year warranty. "
493,86," See items 1 and 2 in statistical discussion, infra. "
495,87," PX 314 and PX 315, Beckman 1973 and 1974 Annual Reports."
495,88," Interrogatory answers read to the jury included the breakdown in sales for preparatives and analyticals by year and first 
quarter 1973-74 figures were included in that answer."
495,89," It should be borne in mind that Spectrofuge charged 15-20% less on service contracts than did Beckman.  Therefore, the more 
reliable data which the plaintiff could have introduced to show Beckman's monopoly power would have been the number of 
instruments under service contract -- not the total contract volume.  Moreover, we are a mite skeptical about the reliability of 
Beckman's estimation of Spectrofuge's UC contract volume.  However, these figures were given by Wilson in a deposition 
offered and read by plaintiff during its case-in-chief.  Had they been far off the mark, we assume that Spectrofuge would not 
have presented this testimony. "
496,90," There was no evidence to indicate that Spectrofuge ever bid on contracts in Georgia, South Carolina, Alabama, or Mississippi.  
It successfully sought damages for loss of future contracts in Alabama, but it is clear that Spectrofuge never bid on the work for 
which it sought recovery.  The Trial Court -- correctly we believe -- granted a partial judgment n. o. v. with respect to that claim.  
See text at note 65 and notes 41 and 66, supra."
496,91," See note 85, supra."
496,92," See note 89, supra."
496,93," See note 94, infra. "
497,94," One can only wonder how the 54.83% and 45.16% shares in UC service contracts held respectively by Beckman and 
Spectrofuge in the Atlanta district (again assuming the reliability of the contract volume figures) would have shifted had 
Beckman's figures been discounted by 15-20% and had figures been assembled on a state-by-state basis for North Carolina, 
Tennessee, and Florida -- the only three states in that district in which Spectrofuge conducted or sought to conduct business.  In 
other words, if the $ 85,000 volume figure for Beckman in the Atlanta District had been adjusted by subtracting 15-20% and 
excluding Beckman UC contracts in Georgia, South Carolina, Alabama, and Mississippi where Spectrofuge never bid for service 
work, Spectrofuge very well may have held in excess of 50% of the submarket in North Carolina, Tennessee, and Florida."
497,95," With respect to parts delays, we point out in passing that Beckman's delays and parts policy (selling parts to non-contract 
customers only out of sales inventory, etc.) was much more reasonable than that of SCM held not to have violated the antitrust 
laws in Advance Business Sys. & Sup. Co. v. SCM Corp., D.Md., 1968, 287 F. Supp. 143, 150 & n.13, 159, modified on other 
grounds, 4 Cir., 1969, 415 F.2d 55. There is one Fifth Circuit case which suggests that retaliatory parts delays might have antitrust implications.  Dillon Materials 
Handling, Inc. v. Albion Indus., 5 Cir., 1978, 567 F.2d 1299, 1301 n.7. However, quite apart from lack of concerted action, the 
unrefuted evidence that Beckman itself experienced such delays, that Spectrofuge never stocked drives or maintained a 
substantial inventory, together with Beckman's track record on parts shipments set forth in Appendix B, which speaks for itself, 
could not support a finding of retaliatory action. "
498,," With respect to the credit hold, the Fifth Circuit has recently held that each defendant's independent belief that the plaintiff's 
credit standing was poor formed a legitimate basis for refusing to deal with him, regardless of his offer to pay in cash or by 
cashier's check, and thus was a defense to a charge of concerted refusal to deal.  Coughlin v. Capital Cement Co., 5 Cir., 1978, 
571 F.2d 290, 300-301. See also Cooper, supra, 72 Mich.L.Rev. at 440."
498,96," For further discussion of Parke, Davis, see footnote 9 in the quotation from the Polytechnic case, infra."
498,97," As pointed out in note 35, supra, the District Court directed a verdict on Spectrofuge's illegal tying claim, and Spectrofuge has 
not appealed from that ruling -- and with good cause.  There was absolutely no requirement imposed by Beckman that a 
customer had to employ its services, and Beckman parts were available to anyone, irrespective of who serviced the instruments.  
Nevertheless, Spectrofuge persists, for reasons we cannot fathom, in characterizing Beckman's proration and drive policy as a 
""classic illegal tying-arrangement"" (main brief at 50), and in relying on tying cases."
498,98," The Beckman rotor warranty was voided if a non-Beckman drive was installed in a Beckman UC.  In view of the potential 
hazards a rotor explosion presented, this policy was perfectly reasonable.  See Weather Wise, supra; Kendall Elevator, supra; 
Tripoli Co. v. Wella Corp., 3 Cir., 1970, 425 F.2d 932 (absolute restrictions as to whom products could be sold held reasonable 
in view of potential dangerousness of hair product). It was also reasonable for Beckman to impose the conditions it did with 
respect to proration below 1.2 billion revolutions. Not all of Spectrofuge's service representatives were former Beckman 
employees and Beckman had no assurance of their qualifications.  Moreover, Spectrofuge's employees had no means of 
keeping abreast of Beckman's new developments.  In this connection it is significant that a Spectrofuge service representative 
was always present when Beckman installed a drive for a Spectrofuge customer because Spectrofuge would be responsible for 
servicing the UC thereafter.  But even despite Beckman's policy, anyone was free to install a non-Beckman drive. The only 
reason for not doing so was the potential financial risk to the instrument owner if the drive malfunctioned and damaged the rotor. "
499,99," Plaintiff's trial tactic was to reiterate, time and time again, DePalma's threat to del Valle (quoted in text, supra, in Part II) that 
Beckman would put Spectrofuge out of business.  Plaintiff resorted to the same tactic on appeal.  That threat, in one version or 
another, is quoted or referred to at least fourteen times in two briefs.  But such a threat, while certainly critical to specific intent, 
does not substitute for solid evidence to satisfy the other requisite elements of Sherman Act violations.  For a case where a 
similar threat was made without carrying the day for the plaintiff, see the Whitten case, supra, 508 F.2d at 559."
499,9," This was implicitly recognized by the Supreme Court in United States v. Parke, Davis & Co., 362 U.S. 29, 80 S. Ct. 503, 4 L. 
Ed. 2d 505 (1960) when it found that the acquiescing dealers were informed that if they complied with price maintenance 
programs, their principal competitors would also do so and that all would benefit by uniform adherence to the program.  
However, the Supreme Court made it clear that had the dealers individually acquiesced in the policy solely because of their 
desire to remain a dealer, there would have been no combination ( Id. at 45, 80 S. Ct. 503). In other words, it was not merely 
individual desire to remain a dealer that caused the dealers to adhere to the program, it was the collective desire of the 
acquiescing dealers to make the program a success (in which case they would all benefit by absence of price competition 
among each other) which, together with the positive efforts of several wholesalers to carry off the program, supplied the 
collaborative element required by Section 1."
499,10," HN16[
] The absence of potential benefit to third parties precludes a finding of combination or conspiracy.  See Advance 
Business Systems & Supply Co. v. SCM Corp., 287 F. Supp. 143 (D.Md.1968), aff'd 415 F.2d 55 (4th Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 
397 U.S. 920, 90 S. Ct. 928, 25 L. Ed. 2d 101 (1970). "
500,100," As discussed in note 34, supra, Spectrofuge was not the sole target of this enforcement.  However, Spectrofuge proved that 
Beckman prorated for the NIH in Bethesda whose in-house personnel serviced its equipment.  On the other hand, Beckman 
proved that NIH was a rather unique customer. It owned approximately 10,000 scientific instruments, of which about 500-600 
were of Beckman manufacture.  The Beckman-NIH contract, PX 231, required Beckman to supply annually 670 man hours of 
training by a senior field service engineer to NIH service personnel and scientists.  Beckman employed on the premises a full-
time account supervisor who had control of the Beckman contracts and all personnel necessary to fulfill the commitment.  On the 
average, six Beckman service representatives visited NIH each day, but that number could vary between three and ten, 
depending on work load. It should be borne in mind that this is the contract which, according to del Valle, Spectrofuge did not bid on because of 
Beckman's drive policy.  See note 41, supra."
500,101," If three parts delays, unilateral pricing policies, and three-week credit holds were the stuff of which antitrust violations were 
made, federal courts would undoubtedly have little time left for more pressing problems. "
501,," After completing our review of the record, it was clear that the opinion could be confined to approximately five pages.  However, 
Boeing requires a more complete treatment.  In addition, considering the time and resources already consumed on this meritless 
matter, we hoped at the very least that it could ultimately serve some useful purpose to the bench and the antitrust bar, 
especially to those lawyers who bring appeals to the Fifth Circuit.  Ergo, a long, long opinion. "
522,*, The Honorable William H. Webster participated in oral argument but took no part in the disposition of this appeal.
522,1, The complaint sought both monetary and injunctive relief. 
523,2," The district court opinion is reported at 435 F. Supp. 933, [1977] 1 Trade Cas. (CCH) P61,360 (D. Minn. 1977)."
523,3," Appellees did not purchase their hearing aids directly from the manufacturers. In Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 52 L. 
Ed. 2d 707, 97 S. Ct. 2061 (1977), the Supreme Court held that HN2[
] only direct purchasers may sue for treble damages 
under § 4 of the Clayton Act. The Court recognized, however, that indirect purchasers may maintain actions involving cost-plus 
contracts as well as those ""in which market forces have been superseded [as when] the direct purchaser is owned or controlled 
by its customer."" Id. at 736 & n.16. Appellees contend that the manufacturers in this case engaged in various prohibited vertical restraints including resale price 
maintenance. In view of our holding that ordinary consumers may not maintain treble damage actions, we need not decide 
whether appellants' alleged violations constitute an exception to Illinois Brick."
523,4," For an exhaustive analysis of the Sherman Act's legislative history, see M. Forkosch, Antitrust and the Consumer 
(Enforcement) 32-170 (1956)."
523,5," An early resolution introduced on July 10, 1888, by Senator Sherman and passed without discussion directed the Senate 
Finance Committee to study the efficacy of curtailing ""trusts or combinations * * * made with a view * * * to prevent free and full 
competition * * * with such penalties and provisions * * * as will tend to preserve freedom of trade and production [and] the 
natural competition of increasing production * * *."" 19 Cong. Rec. 6041 (1888) (remarks of Sen. Sherman) (emphasis supplied).  
This resolution, which gave rise to the congressional debates and ultimately the Sherman Act, explicitly articulated the economic 
philosophy of the bill's proponents. The bills introduced between 1888 and 1890 are consistent with this approach. See, e.g., 
S.3445, S.3510, and H.R. Rep. 11339, 50th Cong., 1st Sess. (1888) (arrangements that tend to prevent full and free competition 
in the production, manufacture, or sale of articles are void), cited in Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U.S. 469, 493-94 n.15, 84 
L. Ed. 1311, 60 S. Ct. 982 (1939). The debates accompanying the final bill also stressed the importance of preserving "
524,," competition and the need to proscribe those agreements, combinations, and trusts whose purpose was to destroy competition. 
See generally 21 Cong. Rec. 2457-2461 (1890) (remarks of Sen. Sherman); id. at 2558 (remarks of Sen. Pugh); id. at 2729 
(remarks of Sen. Platt); id. at 3147 (remarks of Sen. George); id. at 4089 (remarks of Rep. Culberson). The Supreme Court has noted this virtual unanimity of Congress in seeking to protect and preserve a free competitive 
environment. See Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, supra, 310 U.S. at 493-95 n.15."
524,6," Senator George's remarks reflect the practical rather than theoretical obstacles to consumer actions because the mechanic or 
country merchant alleging a business or commercial injury would be able to sue for treble damages even if consumers failing to 
allege such injury could not. "
525,7," The Supreme Court has recognized that these two sections are ""notably different."" See Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., 405 U.S. 
251, 260-61, 31 L. Ed. 2d 184, 92 S. Ct. 885 (1972) (comparing ""business or property"" requirement of § 4 with ""threatened loss 
or damage"" requirement of § 16); cf.  Calnetics Corp. v. Volkswagen of America, Inc., 348 F. Supp. 606 (C.D. Cal. 1972), 
modified, 532 F.2d 674 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 940, 97 S. Ct. 355, 50 L. Ed. 2d 309 (1976) (plaintiff entitled to 
injunctive relief despite failure to prove causal connection necessary to support claim for damages)."
525,8," In contrast, the Supreme Court acknowledged in Pfizer, Inc. v. Government of India, 434 U.S. 308, 98 S. Ct. 584, 54 L. Ed. 2d 
563 (1978): ""It seems apparent * * * the question [whether foreign nations are entitled to sue for treble damages under § 4 of the 
Clayton Act] was never considered at the time the Sherman and Clayton Acts were enacted."" Id.  at 587. "
526,9," HN9[
] Independent of the consumer standing issue, the United States appellate courts have narrowed the class of persons 
able to seek treble damages for antitrust violations by employing a causation analysis similar to the proximate cause limitation 
contained in tort law. See Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 760, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707, 97 S. Ct. 2061 (1977) (Brennan, J., 
dissenting). The right to recover in the Ninth, Fifth, Fourth, and Second Circuits is limited to those in the ""target area"" of the 
alleged violative activity. See, e.g., Commerce Tankers Corp. v. National Maritime Union of America, 553 F.2d 793, 800-01 (2d 
Cir. 1977), cert.  denied, 434 U.S. 923, 98 S. Ct. 400, 54 L. Ed. 2d 280 (1977); Jeffrey v. Southwestern Bell, 518 F.2d 1129, 
1131 (5th Cir. 1975); In re Multidistrict Vehicle Air Pollution M.D.L. No. 31, 481 F.2d 122, 128-29 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 
1045, 94 S. Ct. 551, 38 L. Ed. 2d 336 (1973); South Carolina Council of Milk Producers, Inc. v. Newton, 360 F.2d 414, 418 (4th 
Cir.), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 934, 17 L. Ed. 2d 215, 87 S. Ct. 295 (1966). The Third Circuit has narrowed standing to those 
plaintiffs suffering a ""direct injury."" See Bravman v. Bassett Furniture Industries, Inc., 552 F.2d 90, 96-97 (3d Cir. 1977), cert. 
denied, 434 U.S. 823, 98 S. Ct. 69, 54 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1977). The Sixth Circuit has examined whether the plaintiff was in the 
""protected zone of interest."" See Malamud v. Sinclair Oil Corp., 521 F.2d 1142, 1151 (6th Cir. 1975), citing Association of Data 
Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 25 L. Ed. 2d 184, 90 S. Ct. 827 (1970). HN10[
] This circuit has 
required an ""injury * * * something more than remote * * *."" Sanitary Milk Producers v. Bergjans Farm Dairy, Inc., 368 F.2d 679, 
689 (8th Cir. 1966)."
526,10," In Waldron v. British Petroleum Co., 231 F. Supp. 72 (S.D. N.Y. 1964), the court noted the distinction between business and 
property. The plaintiff in that case had entered into a contract that would have given him oil importation rights. He was alleging 
that an illegal conspiracy prevented his importation of the oil. Because his enterprise was only potential, the court found that no 
""business"" within the meaning of the Act existed. The court went on to decide, however, that HN11[
] the statute uses the two 
terms in the disjunctive; § 4 as it is written is broader than just business. ""The word 'property' has wider scope and is more 
extensive than the word 'business.' Less is required to prove 'property' than to prove 'business.'"" Id. at 86. Under this conception, 
property is any legally protected interest. Id. This distinction was also noted in Hamman v. United States, 267 F. Supp. 420 (D. Mont. 1967), appeal dismissed, 399 F.2d 673 
(9th Cir. 1968), cited with approval in Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., supra, 405 U.S. at 264. There, damages were sought for the 
death of a workman who had been killed during the construction of a dam. In one count, plaintiff alleged that: (1) an illegal 
conspiracy in restraint of trade had prevented other, more careful construction companies from bidding on the job; (2) 
defendant's failure to exercise reasonable care had caused decedent's death; thus, (3) plaintiff who had suffered loss of 
consortium, a recognized property interest under state law, had been injured in her property under § 4 of the Clayton Act. The 
court, citing Waldron, supra, stated that HN12[
] ""property"" in § 4, is broader than business, but that an injury to business or 
property requires ""a commercial venture or enterprise."" 267 F. Supp. at 432. The court dismissed the count on the ground that, 
while plaintiff had suffered an injury to property under state law, she had not suffered an injury to the types of property ""protected 
* * * by the antitrust laws."" Id. The court also stressed the absence of proximate cause between the injury and the alleged 
wrongful conduct. See n.9 supra. "
527,11," A trilogy of cases recently decided by Judge Williams in the Northern District of California has been consolidated and is 
currently before the Ninth Circuit. In all three cases, Judge Williams held that HN15[
] consumers purchasing products for 
personal use suffer no injury to business or property under § 4 and may not bring treble damage actions for relief. See Weinberg 
v. Federated Department Stores, 426 F. Supp. 880 (N.D. Cal. 1977); Gutierrez v. E. & J. Gallo Winery Co., 425 F. Supp. 1221 
(N.D. Cal. 1977); Smith v. Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., Inc., 1977-1 Trade Cas. (CCH) P61,251, No. 75-0727 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 11, 
1977), appeals docketed, Nos. 77-1845, 77-1724, 77-1725, 77-1850, 77-1851, 77-1852 (9th Cir. 1977).  Judge Williams 
analyzed the legislative history of the statute, relying upon the change in the section's language, the fear of a proliferation of 
lawsuits, and statements in the congressional debates extolling the benefits of the Act to businessmen. He also examined 
language in several court decisions, including Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., supra, and Ragar v. T.J. Raney & Sons, 388 F. Supp. 
1184 (E.D. Ark.), aff'd, 521 F.2d 795 (8th Cir. 1975) (per curiam), see infra, and concluded that the phrase ""business or property"" 
cannot be read in the disjunctive but ""is a conjunctive reference to interests of a business nature."" Gutierrez v. E. & J. Gallo 
Winery Co., supra, 425 F. Supp. at 1225. Therefore, HN16[
] consumers who alleged no injury to a business enterprise were 
held to be without standing to sue."
527,12," HN17[
] The Court did not, however, define commercial interest and, in a footnote, distinguished an injury suffered by the 
state in its capacity as a ""consumer in the marketplace,"" which is within the scope of § 4's protection, from that occurring merely 
to the state's general economy, which is not.  Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., supra, 405 U.S. at 262-63 n.14. Similarly, in explaining 
a provision enabling the United States to sue for antitrust violations that is also limited to injuries to business or property, the 
Court stated the provision was not intended to cover general injuries to the national economy, ""but only * * * those * * * suffered * 
* * as a consumer of goods and services."" Id. at 265. The Court also noted that a large part of any injury to the state's general 
economy ""is no more than a reflection of injuries to the 'business or property' of consumers, for which they may recover 
themselves under § 4."" Id. at 264. In addition to this language by the Court in Hawaii, appellee cites, and we note, HN18[
] several judicial references, some by 
the Supreme Court, suggesting that ""consumers in the marketplace"" should be permitted redress for injuries suffered through 
anticompetitive activity. See, e.g., Pfizer, Inc.  v. Government of India, 434 U.S. 308, 98 S. Ct. 584, 592, 594, 54 L. Ed. 2d 
563(1978) (Burger, C.J., dissenting) ; Brunswick v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 486 n.10, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701, 97 S. Ct. 
690 (1977). In Cleary v. Chalk, 159 U.S. App. D.C. 415, 488 F.2d 1315, 1319 n.17 (1973), cert. denied, 416 U.S. 938, 40 L. Ed. 
2d 289, 94 S. Ct. 1940 (1974), the court, acknowledging that the phrase ""business or property"" refers to commercial interests or 
enterprises, stated: ""We have no doubt that a consumer of service who is illegally overcharged sustains a property injury no less 
than a consumer of goods."" Relying upon Chattanooga Foundry & Pipe Works v. City of Atlanta, 203 U.S. 390, 396, 51 L. Ed. 
241, 27 S. Ct. 65 (1906), the court indicated that a consumer of goods is injured in his property by violations of the antitrust laws 
that raise the price of goods. In Bravman v. Bassett Furniture Industries, Inc., supra, a suit by a sales representative of a 
furniture manufacturer, the court stated: ""The right of consumers to challenge price fixing conspiracies is well established."" 552 
F.2d at 99 n.23. "
528,," These references, however, are not inconsistent with our construction of § 4. Consumers who suffer commercial injury to 
business or property may sue for treble damages. Moreover, the consumer standing question presented in this appeal was not 
addressed by these courts. See n.18 infra."
528,13," But see Pfizer, Inc. v. Government of India, supra, 98 S. Ct. at 588, citing Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, supra. In Pfizer, HN23[
] 
the Court noted that ""§ 4 has two purposes: to deter violators and deprive them of 'the fruits of their illegality,' and 'to 
compensate victims of antitrust violations for their injuries.'"" This reference by the Court to the compensatory rationale of § 4 was designed merely to emphasize its remedial function. See 
Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., supra, 429 U.S. at 485. The Court has repeatedly stressed as the general purpose 
of the antitrust laws the need to enhance competition. See Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., supra, 405 U.S. at 262; Brown Shoe Co. 
v. United State, 370 U.S. 294, 344, 82 s.  Ct. 1502, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510; Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, supra, 310 U.S. at 493. "

] In our own circuit we have had an opportunity to review a grand scale antitrust class action in various contexts. See United States v. Pfizer, Inc., 560 F.2d 323 (8th Cir. 1977); United States v. Pfizer, Inc., 560 F.2d 319 (8th Cir. 1977); Republic of

(1972). It is our understanding that the merits in that case have never been fully litigated."
530,16," In addition to the new statute, the Justice Department's antitrust division as well as the Federal Trade Commission are 
empowered to combat anticompetitive activity."
530,17," We, of course, intimate no view on the merits of the present action."
530,18," Appellees argue that numerous consumer actions have been permitted by the courts, many to completion, without any 
discussion of consumer standing. For example, in Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 44 L. Ed. 2d 572, 95 S. Ct. 2004 "
531,," (1975), purchasers of homes successfully attacked attorneys' use of minimum fee schedules. The Supreme Court, while noting 
that this type of activity harmed consumers, id. at 782, did not specifically discuss consumer standing. See also Fisher v. First 
National Bank of Omaha, 548 F.2d 255 (8th Cir. 1977) (failing to address consumer standing, court dismissed action on other 
grounds). In these cases, however, the issue was neither raised by the parties nor addressed by the courts; as such, it cannot be deemed 
to have been decided."
531,19," Appellee's complaint in the district court sought both monetary and injunctive relief. She is precluded by our decision from 
maintaining an action for treble damages under § 4. Her claim for injunctive relief, however, is not before us in this interlocutory 
appeal. "
532,1," Though the complaint purported to state only one cause of action, it also alleged a breach of contract, with plaintiff claiming to 
be a third party beneficiary of the insurance contract between Western World and its insured. In her response to demurrer 
plaintiff characterized this allegation as ""surplusage,"" and no question with respect thereto is raised on appeal. It would appear in 
any event that third party beneficiary analysis would avail plaintiff nothing. "
533,2, Unless otherwise indicated all statutory references are to the Insurance Code.
533,3," The reason for this was that the business of insurance was not deemed commerce within the meaning of the Commerce 
Clause (U.S. Const., art. I, § 8, cl. 3). ( Paul v. Virginia (1868) 75 U.S. (8 Wall.) 168, 183 [19 L.Ed. 357, 361].)"
533,4," ""Congress declares that the continued regulation and taxation by the several states of the business of insurance is in the public 
interest, and that silence on the part of the Congress shall not be construed to impose any barrier or taxation of such business 
by the several states."" (15 U.S.C.A.  § 1011.)"
533,5," ""Nothing contained in this chapter shall render the said Sherman Act inapplicable to any agreement to boycott, coerce, or 
intimidate, or act of boycott, coercion, or intimidation."" (15 U.S.C.A.  § 1013b).) "
534,6," It does not appear that the amount of the judgment against Circle K Riding Stables was in excess of its insurance coverage. In 
any case appellant did not sue as assignee of any right of action Circle K might have against its insurer."
534,7," The granting of petition for hearing in Royal Globe Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (3 Civ. 17489) on June 1, 1978, places the issue 
before our Supreme Court."
534,8," Of related interest is the court's rejection (17 Cal.3d at p. 946) of the further argument that plaintiff could proceed against the 
insurer for breach of the duty owed to its insured by way of a creditors' suit under Code of Civil Procedure, section 720. "
551,1," In the district court plaintiffs alleged that Opinion 290 violated their right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.  
On appeal, plaintiffs argue that Opinion 290 violates their First Amendment rights under Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, 433 U.S. 
350, 97 S. Ct. 2691, 53 L. Ed. 2d 810 (1977), which had not been decided at the time of the district court's ruling.  Because the 
First Amendment issue is of great public interest and because the parties did not have the benefit of the Bates Decision in the 
district court, we will consider this argument even though it was not raised in the district court.  Rogers v. Larson, 563 F.2d 617, 
620 n.4 (3d Cir. 1977); Franki Foundation v. Alger-Rau Associates, Inc., 513 F.2d 581, 586 (3d Cir. 1975)."

Committee expected the New Jersey Supreme Court to revise DR 2-102(A)(5) to define ""telephone directory"" as ""telephone 
company directory,"" in effect adopting the Committee's interpretation of that Disciplinary Rule in Opinion 290.  178-79a.  No such 
revision has been made. "
553,8," The district court's unpublished opinion is reproduced at 346a.  The court also dismissed plaintiffs' pendent state claim for lack 
of jurisdiction."
553,9," On appeal defendants argue that Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, 433 U.S. 350, 97 S. Ct. 2691, 53 L. Ed. 2d 810 (1977), 
decided after the district court's decision, renders this case moot. Bates held that the First Amendment prevents states from 
prohibiting, but not from regulating, advertising by lawyers.  See the discussion of Bates, Infra.  There is nothing in the record, 
however, indicating that lawyers have resumed purchasing listings in the Princeton Community Phone Book since the Bates 
decision.  Therefore, in light of defendants' burden of demonstrating mootness, W. T. Grant, supra, we reject this argument."
553,10," 17A Ariz.Rev.Stat. (Supp.1976), p. 26.  DR 2-101(B) provided in part: "
554,," ""(B) A lawyer shall not publicize himself, or his partner, or associate, or any other lawyer affiliated with him or his firm, as a 
lawyer through newspaper or magazine advertisements, radio or television announcements, display advertisements in the city or 
telephone directories or other means of commercial publicity, nor shall he authorize or permit others to do so in his behalf."" This rule has since been amended.  See note 11 Infra."
554,11," In Bates the Court drew a distinction between the print media and the electronic broadcast media, acknowledging that the 
latter may warrant special consideration.  Bates, supra at 384, 97 S. Ct. 2691. However, there is no implication in Bates that 
different forms of print media warrant different consideration.  Furthermore, the amendments to DR 2-101(B), enacted in the 
wake of Bates, permit advertising in the print media generally.  Before the recent amendments, DR 2-101(B) read as stated in 
note 10, Supra.  New DR 2-101(B) reads in part: ""In order to facilitate the process of informed selection of a lawyer by potential consumers of legal services, a lawyer may publish 
or broadcast, subject to DR 2-103, the following information in print media distributed or over radio broadcast in the geographic 
area or areas in which the lawyer resides or maintains offices or in which a significant part of the lawyers' clientele resides, 
provided that the information disclosed by the lawyer in such publication or broadcast complies with DR 2-101(A), and is 
presented in a dignified manner: (1) Name, including name of law firm and names of professional associates; addresses and telephone numbers; (2) One or more fields of law in which the lawyer or law firm practices, a statement that practice is limited to one or more fields of 
law, or a statement that the lawyer or law firm specializes in a particular field of law practice, to the extent authorized under DR 
2-105; (20) Fee for an initial consultation; (21) Availability upon request of a written schedule of fees and/or an estimate of the fee to be charged for specific services; (22) Contingent fee rates subject to DR 2-106(C), provided that the statement discloses whether percentages are computed 
before or after deduction of costs; (23) Range of fees for services, provided that the statement discloses that the specific fee within the range which will be charged 
will vary depending upon the particular matter to be handled for each client and the client is entitled without obligation to an 
estimate of the fee within the range likely to be charged, in print size equivalent to the largest print used in setting forth the fee 
information; (24) Hourly rate . . .; (25) Fixed fees for specific legal services . . .. "
555,12," See also In re Primus, 436 U.S. 412, 98 S. Ct. 1893, 56 L. Ed. 2d 417 (1978). In Primus the Supreme Court held that when a 
lawyer seeking to further political and ideological goals through associational activity, including litigation, advises a lay person of 
his or her legal rights and discloses in a subsequent letter that free legal assistance is available from a nonprofit organization 
with which the lawyer is affiliated, the lawyer's conduct is protected under the First Amendment and may not be prohibited by a 
state's rules against solicitation and publicity. This case is readily distinguishable from Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Association, 436 U.S. 447, 98 S. Ct. 1912, 56 L. Ed. 2d 444 
(1978), in which the Supreme Court held that a state ""constitutionally may discipline a lawyer for soliciting clients in person, for 
pecuniary gain, under circumstances likely to pose dangers that the state has a right to prevent."" Id. at  -- , 98 S. Ct. at 1915.

556,15," However, as noted above, the case against advertising was stronger in Bates than it is here.  Nonetheless, plaintiffs'

Ed. 989 (1920), in which the Court said that a classification ""must be reasonable, not arbitrary, and must rest on some ground of 
difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons similarly situated shall be 
treated alike."" Id. at 415, 40 S. Ct. at 561. See also, e. g., Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 485, 90 S. Ct. 1153, 25 L. Ed. 2d 
491 (1970)."
556,20," Opinion 290 was issued in October 1974, prior to the Supreme Court's decisions in Virginia Pharmacy Bd. v. Virginia 
Consumer Council, 425 U.S. 748, 96 S. Ct. 1817, 48 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1976), and Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U.S. 809, 95 S. Ct. 
2222, 44 L. Ed. 2d 600 (1975). In Virginia Pharmacy Bd., the Supreme Court squarely held that the First Amendment reaches 
purely commercial speech. However, the Court acknowledged that ""(t)here can be no question that in past decisions the Court 
has given some indication that commercial speech is unprotected,"" 425 U.S. Id. at 758, 96 S. Ct. at 1823, and recognized that it 
was not until Bigelow that ""the notion of unprotected ""commercial speech' all but passed from the scene,"" Id. at 759, 96 S. Ct. at 
1824. Furthermore, in Virginia Pharmacy Bd., the Court narrowly limited its decision to advertising by pharmacists and expressly 
stated that it expressed no opinion concerning advertising by other professionals.  The Court stated: ""We stress that we have considered in this case the regulation of commercial advertising by pharmacists.  Although we express 
no opinion as to other professions, the distinctions, historical and functional, between professions, may require consideration of 
quite different factors.  Physicians and lawyers, for example, do not dispense standardized products; they render professional 
Services of almost infinite variety and nature, with the consequent enhanced possibility for confusion and deception if they were 
to undertake certain kinds of advertising."" Id. at 773 n.25, 96 S. Ct. at 1831. Bigelow was also narrowly limited to its facts, advertisements conveying information 
concerning the availability of legal abortions in New York.  The Court stated: ""We need not decide in this case the precise extent 
to which the First Amendment permits regulation of advertising that is related to activities the State may legitimately regulate or 
even prohibit."" Id. 421 U.S. at 825, 95 S. Ct. at 2234. (footnote omitted).  Therefore, it would appear that the defendants could 
not have known that commercial speech was protected in the circumstances of this case until the Bates decision. "
557,21," See, e. g., Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 92 S. Ct. 2286, 33 L. Ed. 2d 212 (1972)."
557,22," Bates, supra 433 U.S. at 383-84, 97 S. Ct. 2691."
557,23," The record indicates that the members of the Committee were concerned about the proliferation of advertising by lawyers.  
Deposition of Frank L. Bate at 5; Deposition of Blaine E. Capehart at 315a, 323a."
557,24," The pre-trial order stipulated that three defendants, Hughes, Lebson and Webster, did not participate in the decision."
557,25," For administrative purposes, the Committee is apparently divided into three parts, A through C.  Inquiries are assigned to the 
parts on a rotating basis as they are received.  Decisions as to whether to entertain inquiries and draft opinions are approved by 
the part to which the inquiry is assigned before they are submitted to the Committee as a whole."
557,26," The memorandum, prepared by Mr. Matyola, an associate in defendant Wharton's law firm, concluded that the initial inquiry 
should have been answered, a view rejected by Part C.  On the merits of the inquiry, this memorandum reached the same 
conclusion as did Mr. Capehart's draft opinion and, ultimately, Opinion 290.  Deposition of Daniel J. Matyola at 248-49a.  Mr. 
Wharton did not instruct Mr. Matyola as to how to resolve the issue, but simply asked Matyola to research the problem and 
present this views.  Id. at 249-50a. "
558,27, No such inquiry was made of Wharton.
558,28," The circulation of the Princeton Community Phone Book is limited to the Princeton, New Jersey, area.  336a.  Princeton's 
estimated 1978 population is 13,600.  1978 Commercial Atlas and Marketing Guide 75 (1978)."
558,29," Although we do not consider that there is enough evidence to raise a genuine issue as to defendants' bad faith or malicious 
intent to injure, we do not necessarily approve what was done here.  To avoid any appearance of impropriety, it may have been 
advisable for the decision-makers having any interest in AT&T or New Jersey Bell to have recused themselves. "
559,30," The holding of Parker is thoroughly analyzed in Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., 428 U.S. 579, 585-92, 96 S. Ct. 3110, 49 L. Ed. 
2d 1141 (1976). For a discussion of the historical background and origins of Parker, see Handler, The Current Attack on the 
Parker v. Brown State Action Doctrine, 76 Colum.L.Rev. 1 (1976). See also P. Areeda & D. Turner, 1 Antitrust Law 67-69 
(1978); L. Sullivan, Antitrust 732-34 (1977)."
559,31," Plaintiffs suggest that the Committee's status as a state agent is tenuous because the New Jersey Supreme Court does not 
necessarily approve the Committee's opinions.  Indeed, under Rule 1:19 (see part I, par. 2, Supra ) lawyers may appeal adverse 
decisions of the Committee to the New Jersey Supreme Court.  This view will not withstand analysis.  If a legislature creates a 
system of courts, it may not approve of the decisions of those courts, but it does not follow that those courts are not state 
agencies."
559,32," DR 2-106 provides in part: ""Fees for Legal Services ""(A) A lawyer shall not enter into an agreement for, charge, or collect an illegal or clearly excessive fee. "
560,," ""(B) A fee is clearly excessive when, after a review of the facts, a lawyer of ordinary prudence would be left with a definite and 
firm conviction that fee is in excess of a reasonable fee.  Factors to be considered as guides in determining the reasonableness 
of a fee include the following: (1) The time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal 
services properly. (2) The likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other employment by 
the lawyer. (3) The fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services. (4) The amount involved and the results obtained. (5) The time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances. (6) The nature and length of the professional relationship with the client. (7) The experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services. (8) Whether the fee is fixed or contingent."""
560,33," See note 10, Supra. "
562,34," Commentators have suggested a number of approaches which are consistent with, but not identical to, that taken here.  
Professors Areeda and Turner state that ""there can be no immunity without (1) adequate public supervision and (2) a clear state 
purpose to displace antitrust law."" P. Areeda & D. Turner, 1 Antitrust Law 71 (1978).  In Professor Sullivan's view, ""state 
displacement of federal policy will be sanctioned only when the state has made a legislative judgment to adopt a cohesive 
regulatory program alternative to antitrust and only to the extent needed to give that policy the scope which its alternative 
philosophy requires."" L. Sullivan, Antitrust, 734-35 (1977).  According to a third commentator, if the state intent to restrict 
competition takes the form of an express statutory authorization, the activity should be protected.  If the state intent is expressed 
by a state agency, the activity should be protected if it falls within the scope of the agency's authority.  If no state intent can be 
determined, active state control, supervision, or involvement in the activity would imply such intent, and the activity would be 
protected.  Comment, The State Action Exemption in Antitrust: From Parker v. Brown to Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., 1977 Duke 
L.J. 871, 908. See also Note, Parker v. Brown Revisited: The State Action Doctrine After Goldfarb, Cantor, and Bates, 77 
Colum.L.Rev. 898 908-13 (1977), which recognizes that status as a governmental entity is neither a necessary nor sufficient 
condition for the state action exemption. Under any of the above tests, we think the result we reach would follow."
562,35," In Bates, supra, 433 U.S. at 359-60, 97 S. Ct. 2691, the Court equates a command of the state supreme court with the 
command of the state acting as sovereign."
562,36," Professor Sullivan has framed this issue somewhat differently, as follows: ""Assuming an active conflict between antitrust and 
state regulatory law it becomes essential for the court to decide which policy ought to defer to the other and to what degree."" L. "
563,," Sullivan, Antitrust 737 (1977).  In Bates, supra at 361-62, 97 S. Ct. 2691, the Supreme Court decided that the policy of regulating 
advertising by lawyers was entitled to deference, at least where damages were sought.  See also Note, Colum.L.Rev., Supra 
note 34, at 921-33. "
567,1," 15 U.S.C. § 15 provides: ""Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue 
therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, without 
respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a 
reasonable attorney's fee."""
567,2," For a discussion of the decisional law in this circuit and in the Supreme Court on the requirement that the restraint be 
unreasonable, See, e.g., Columbia Metal Culvert Co. v. Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corp., 579 F.2d 20 at 32, at n.45 (3d Cir. 
1978)."
567,3," As Professor Sullivan has noted: ""(I)t presents a single concept about common action, not three separate ones: ""contract * * * combination or conspiracy' 
becomes an alliterative compound noun roughly translated to mean ""concerted action.' There is little need to grapple with issues 
about the meanings of the particular words of the statute nor to mark nice distinctions among them."" L. Sullivan, Antitrust 312 (1977)."
567,4," See, e.g., Albrecht v. Herald Co., 390 U.S. 145, 88 S. Ct. 869, 19 L. Ed. 2d 998 (1968); United States v. Parke, Davis & Co., 
362 U.S. 29, 80 S. Ct. 503, 4 L. Ed. 2d 505 (1960); United States v. Bausch & Lomb Co., 321 U.S. 707, 64 S. Ct. 805, 88 L. Ed. 
1024 (1944). "
568,5," Justice Harlan dissented on the ground that Milne and Kroner were just being paid to do jobs the Herald could have done and, 
therefore, the Herald's ""activity was in its essence unilateral."" Id. at 161, 88 S. Ct. at 877. (Harlan, J., dissenting)."
568,6," Kroner could only get the paper route by agreeing to the restraint of trade, the fixed price. Although this was a necessary 
condition of his retaining the route, it was not a sufficient condition because Albrecht may have been able to get the route back 
by reducing his price.  Nonetheless, as long as Albrecht remained adamant, Kroner profited by the restraint of trade."
568,7," Milne, by contrast, did not share this common purpose. Its only purpose was to earn its solicitation fee and it had no interest in 
whether the Herald was successful in fixing the retail price. "
569,8," Neither plaintiff's complaint nor its arguments on appeal contend that there was concerted activity between Kroger and 
auctioneer Davis when the equipment which had been removed from the shopping center premises was auctioned the second 
time. "
570,9," The only evidence that Davis knew of Kroger's intent to restrain trade is the claim made in Friedman's deposition that he told 
Davis at the time of the auction that he, Friedman, had leased the premises and wished to leave the equipment in place.  141- "
571,42," a. When Kroger then told Davis that it wanted the equipment moved, it might be possible to infer that Davis then learned that 
Kroger intended to restrain trade. However, Davis stated in his deposition that he did not recall Friedman's telling him that he 
had leased the premises and wished to leave the equipment in place.  Deposition of Harry Davis at 27.  Furthermore, at the time 
of the auction, Friedman had not technically leased the premises because the lease was contingent upon the termination of 
Kroger's lease. Kroger's lease was not terminated until three months after the auction."
571,10," Friedman's deposition is repetitious and ambiguous, but the following allegations can be summarized from it: (1) The floor was damaged when Limberg removed copper tubing from trenches in the floor.  159a.  The copper tubing was sold 
separately at the auction. (2) A wall was damaged when a cooler was removed from it.  160a. (3) Valances and lighting fixtures were ""torn out"" and left in a corner.  161, 166, 174a. (4) A serious leak in the roof was created when an air conditioner compressor was removed.  162a. (5) Part of a wall was removed where a cooler had been attached. 170, 181a. (6) Pipes and electrical wiring were disconnected from equipment in such a way as to require repairs.  171a. Friedman also testified that he had no knowledge of whether Kroger instructed Limberg to cause this damage.  Deposition of 
Harold Friedman at 87. The deposition of Ralph George Mehringer, who was the manager of facility engineering for Kroger and was responsible for 
hiring Limberg to remove the equipment, also provides evidence concerning the damage.  Regarding item (4) above, Mehringer 
stated: ""During the course of the removal Mr. Limberg mentioned that the building roof was leaking.  There was a very severe roof leak 
along the rear of the building which I passed on to Mr. Kittelson (Kroger's real estate manager) and asked him to pass that on to 
the lessor."" Deposition of Mehringer at 119.  Regarding item (5) above, Mehringer stated: ""We removed, for example, the coolers.  They were built into the partitions.  We removed them the best we could not to damage 
any partitions."" Id. at 103. "
573,11," Plaintiff does not cite, nor does our research disclose, any appellate decision extending Albrecht to a case in which the 
agreements supporting a claim of concerted activity are similar to those here."
573,12," See also Handler, Through the Antitrust Looking Glass Twenty-First Annual Antitrust Review, 57 Calif.L.Rev. 182, 190 (1969), 
which suggests that a common purpose is necessary for concerted activity. "
574,13," See also The Supreme Court, 1967 Term, 82 Harv.L.Rev. 95, 257-58 (1968), suggesting additional reasons why Albrecht 
should be interpreted narrowly."
574,14," This test is derived from Justice Holmes' opinion in Swift & Co. v. United States, 196 U.S. 375, 25 S. Ct. 276, 49 L. Ed. 518 
(1905). Justice Holmes stated: ""Where acts are not sufficient in themselves to produce a result which the law seeks to prevent for instance, the monopoly, but 
require further acts in addition to the mere forces of nature to bring that result to pass, an intent to bring it to pass is necessary in 
order to produce a dangerous probability that it will happen.  Commonwealth v. Peaslee, 177 Massachusetts, 267, 272, 59 N.E. 
55. But when that intent and the consequent dangerous probability exist, this statute, like many others and like the common law 
in some cases, directs itself against that dangerous probability as well as against the completed result."" Id. at 396, 25 S. Ct. at 279.  For other cases applying this test, See, e.g., American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U.S. 781, 
785, 66 S. Ct. 1125, 90 L. Ed. 1575 (1946); Yoder Bros., Inc. v. California-Florida Plant Corp., 537 F.2d 1347, 1368 (5th Cir.

monthly sales for the years in question and upon Friedman's answers to interrogatories stating his monthly sales figures. This

""claims made"" policy protects the holder only against claims made during the life of the policy.  The Court of Appeals noted that 
""a doctor who practiced for only one year, say 1972, would need only one 1972 'occurrence' policy to be fully covered, but he 
would need several years of 'claims made' policies to protect himself from claims arising out of his acts in 1972."" 555 F.2d 3, 5 n.

except on an emergency basis,"" id., at 26. "
585,5," Following the rendition of the legislative history in Transnational Ins. Co. v. Rosenlund, 261 F.Supp. 12 (Ore. 1966), two 
Circuits squarely have held that § 3 (b) reaches only ""blacklists"" of insurance companies or agents by other insurance 
companies or agents.  See Meicler v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 506 F.2d 732, 734 (CA5 1975); but cf.  Battle v. Liberty 
National Life Ins. Co., 493 F.2d 39, 51 (CA5 1974), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1110 (1975); Addrissi v. Equitable Life Assurance 
Soc., 503 F.2d 725, 729 (CA9 1974), cert. denied, 420 U.S. 929 (1975). Two other Circuits have adopted a broader reading of § 3 (b).  See Ballard v. Blue Shield of Southern W. Va., Inc., 543 F.2d 
1075, 1078 (CA4 1976), cert. denied, 430 U.S. 922 (1977) (alleged conspiracy between insurers and physicians to deny health 
insurance coverage for chiropractic services); Proctor v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 182 U. S. App. D. C. 264, 276-277, 561

1963) (dictum), cert. denied, 376 U.S. 952 (1964)."
585,6," To establish a stable market for medical malpractice insurance, the JUA was created on a temporary basis by Emergency 
Regulation XXI, R. I. Dept. of Business Regulation, Insurance Div., June 16, 1975, App. 114-127, and received legislative 
sanction in R. I. Gen. Laws § 42-14.1-1 (1977).  The emergency regulation was revised in April 1976 to permit the writing of 
medical malpractice insurance outside the JUA for all providers of health-care services other than physicians.  App. 150-151.  A 
subsequent change in state law authorizes the Director to promulgate regulations permitting the selling of such insurance 
outside of the JUA to physicians as well.  1976 R. I. Pub. Laws, ch. 79, § 1. "
586,7," Although this case is technically not moot, the parties are not barred from showing, ""on remand, that the likelihood of further 
violations is sufficiently remote to make injunctive relief unnecessary."" United States v. Phosphate Export Assn., 393 U.S. 199, 
203 (1968); see United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 633-636 (1953). We have not addressed respondents' claim for damages arising out of their inability ""to obtain medical malpractice insurance on 
a reasonable basis after June 30, 1975,"" App. 26.  Such a claim might itself preclude a finding of mootness, see e. g., Memphis 
Light, Gas & Water Div. v. Craft, 436 U.S. 1, 8-9 (1978), but the parties have not advised the Court whether this claim survives 
the formation of the JUA.  The Court of Appeals stated that respondents were ""entitled to seek both injunctive relief and treble 
damages,"" noting, in a separate discussion, that ""the change in malpractice coverage has increased costs for the doctors."" 555 
F.2d, at 12, and n. 7. The validity of the damages claim, in light of the role of the JUA and the considerations identified in this 
decision, is a matter for initial determination by the courts below."
586,8," The Government in that case brought a Sherman Act prosecution against the South-Eastern Underwriters Association (SEUA), 
its membership of nearly 200 private stock fire insurance companies, and 27 individuals.  The indictment alleged conspiracies to 
maintain arbitrary and noncompetitive premium rates on fire and ""allied lines"" of insurance in several States, and to monopolize 
trade and commerce in the same lines of insurance.  It was asserted that the conspirators not only fixed rates but also, in the 
Court's words, ""employed boycotts together with other types of coercion and intimidation to force nonmember insurance 
companies into the conspiracies, and to compel persons who needed insurance to buy only from [SEUA] members on [SEUA] 
terms."" United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Assn., 322 U.S., at 535."
586,9," Respondents did not contest below ""that [petitioners'] acts were related to the business of insurance and that Rhode Island 
effectively regulates that business."" 555 F. d, at 6.  They do not argue to the contrary in this Court. "
587,10," The Court of Appeals' ruling rested on the determination that respondents charged petitioners ""with an unlawful boycott,"" id., at 
12. In light of our disposition of this case, we do not decide the scope of the terms ""coercion"" and ""intimidation"" in § 3 (b)."

Dictionary 234 (4th ed. 1968)."
587,12," The first decision of this Court dealing with a boycott situation, although without using the term, appears to be Montague & Co. 
v. Lowry, 193 U.S. 38 (1904), a nonlabor case involving an association of wholesalers and manufacturers that provided in its 
bylaws that no dealer member could buy from any manufacturer who was not a member of the association or sell for less than 
list price to a nonmember.  See Kirkpatrick, Commercial Boycotts as Per Se Violations of the Sherman Act, 10 Geo. Wash. L. 
Rev. 302, 306-307 (1942). "
588,13," The cases cited in the text are significant for their general interpretation of the Sherman Act even though they are no longer 
controlling as to the applicability of the antitrust laws to the activities of labor unions.  See Connell Co. v. Plumbers & 
Steamfitters, 421 U.S. 616, 621-623 (1975); United States v. Hutcheson, 312 U.S. 219, 234 (1941); Drivers' Union v. Lake Valley 
Co., 311 U.S. 91, 102-103 (1940)."
588,14," See L. Sullivan, Handbook of the Law of Antitrust 256-259 (1977).  Other commentators have framed a somewhat broader 
definition for a per se offense in this area.  See Barber, Refusals to Deal under the Federal Antitrust Laws, 103 U. Pa. L. Rev. 
847, 875 (1955) (""group action to coerce third parties to conform to the pattern of conduct desired by the group or to secure their 
removal from competition""); Kirkpatrick, supra n. 12, at 305 (""interference with the relations between a nonmember of the 
combination and its members or others"").  We express no opinion, however, as to the merit of any of these definitions."
588,15," Kiefer-Stewart Co. involved a horizontal resale price maintenance scheme, see White Motor Co. v. United States, 372 U.S. 
253, 260 (1963), but it has been cited as a ""group boycott"" case, see Klor's v. Broadway-Hale Stores, 359 U.S. 207, 212 n. 5 
(1959); Times-Picayune v. United States, 345 U.S. 594, 625 (1953). See also United States v. Frankfort Distilleries, 324 U.S. 
293, 295-296 (1945) (alleged conspiracy of producers, wholesalers, and retailers to maintain local retail prices by means of a 
""boycott program""). "
589,," See generally Report of the U.S. Attorney General's National Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws 137 (1955) (""[approving] the 
established legal doctrines which condemn group boycotts of customers or suppliers as routine unreasonable restraints 
forbidden by Section 1 of the Sherman Act"")."
589,16," Petitioners suggest that the alleged conspiracy in this case presents a horizontal agreement not to compete, as distinguished 
from a boycott. See United States v. Topco Associates, 405 U.S. 596, 612 (1972); United States v. Consolidated Laundries 
Corp., 291 F.2d 563, 573-575 (CA2 1961)."
589,17," As one commentator has noted: ""If an individual competitor lacks the bargaining power to get a particular contract term, the 
courts apparently will not let him join with other competitors and use their collective bargaining power to compel the insertion of 
such a term in the contract, no matter how desirable."" Bird, supra n. 11, at 263, discussing, inter alia, Binderup v. Pathe 
Exchange; Paramount Famous Corp. v. United States, 282 U.S. 30 (1930)."
589,18," We note our disagreement with MR. JUSTICE STEWART's expression of alarm that a reading of the operative terms of § 3 
(b), consistent with traditional Sherman Act usage, ""would plainly devour the broad antitrust immunity bestowed by § 2 (b)."" Post, 
at 559.  Whatever the precise reach of the terms ""boycott,"" ""coercion,"" and ""intimidation,"" the decisions of this Court do not 
support the dissent's suggestion that they are coextensive with the prohibitions of the Sherman Act. See, e. g., Eastern States 
Lumber Assn. v. United States, 234 U.S. 600, 611 (1914), quoting Gompers v. Bucks Stove & Range Co., 221 U.S. 418, 438 
(1911). In this regard, we are not cited to any decision illustrating the assertion, post, at 559 n. 6, that price fixing, in the absence 
of any additional enforcement activity, has been treated either as ""a boycott"" or ""coercion."""

590,20," The bill introduced by Senators McCarran and Ferguson (S. 340) provided that only federal legislation specifically dealing with 
insurance could override state laws relating to the regulation or taxation of that business, and created a moratorium period, 
staying the operation of the Sherman and Clayton Acts to enable the States to adjust their statutes to South-Eastern 
Underwriters.  S. Rep. No. 20, 79th Cong., 1st Sess. (1945); 91 Cong. Rec. 478 (1945).  Largely at the insistence of Senator 
O'Mahoney, it was amended on the floor of the Senate to provide that the Sherman and Clayton Acts would not be pre-empted 
at the expiration of the moratorium. Id., at 488.  The bill introduced in the House and reported favorably out of committee 
contained provisions that were similar to the original bill in the Senate.  H. R. Rep. No. 143, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 1 (1945); 91 
Cong. Rec. 1085 (1945).  The bill as reported passed the House.  A Conference Committee then was appointed, composed of 
Senators McCarran, O'Mahoney, and Ferguson, and Representatives Sumners, Walter, and Hancock.  In place of the Senate 
floor amendment, the conference substitute added the proviso to § 2 (b) that is presently in the Act.  H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 213, 
79th Cong., 1st Sess., 1-2 (1945)."
590,21," Senator Ferguson perceived a distinction between legislation authorizing ""rating bureaus,"" which would not be disturbed by 
the bill, 91 Cong. Rec. 1481 (1945), and legislation permitting insurance companies to engage in practices constituting a 
""boycott, coercion, or intimidation,"" which would remain subject to the Sherman Act, ibid. Senator O'Mahoney noted that the conference substitute would permit ""certain agreements which can normally be made in the 
insurance business which are in the public interest, but which might conceivably be a violation of the antitrust law,"" such as a 
""rating bureau"" operating ""under the supervision and regulation of the State . . . ."" Id., at 1444.  But other practices constituting 
""regulation by private combinations and groups,"" id., at 1483, would have to pass muster under the Sherman Act. "
591,22," The dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE STEWART advances the view, abandoned by petitioners in this Court, see supra, at 
546, that § 3 (b) applies only ""to the kinds of antitrust violations alleged in South-Eastern Underwriters . . . ."" Post, at 565.  The 
dissent refers to no statement, either in the Committee Reports or the debates, asserting that § 3 (b)'s only purpose was to keep 
alive the South-Eastern Underwriters indictment or purporting to restrict its scope to the practices specifically alleged therein.  
There is nothing in the proposal of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, identified by the dissent as the model 
for the Senate bill, S. 340, that evinces such a limited purpose.  The report accompanying the proposal stated in pertinent part: ""No exemption is sought nor expected for oppressive or destructive practices.  On the whole, insurance has been conducted on 
a high plane, with great benefit to the public, and if inconsistent procedures are found they must be eradicated.  Provision is 
made that the Sherman Act shall not now or hereafter be inapplicable to any act of boycott, coercion, or intimidation."" 90 Cong. 
Rec. A4406 (1944) (emphasis supplied). It is difficult to view this language as supporting the dissent's interpretation. It also is asserted that the ""boycott"" clause in the Senate bill was intended to apply only during the moratorium period, a fact 
which supposedly supports the dissent's narrow reading of the clause.  But the dissent concedes that ""[whatever] its initial 
impetus . . . , there is no indication that the provision was finally thought to be applicable only to the South-Eastern litigation."" 
Post, at 563-564, n. 20.  Moreover, neither the Committee Reports, see supra, at 546-547, nor the insurance commissioners' 
statement, quoted above, suggests an intent to suspend the operation of the ""boycott"" clause at any time.  Certainly Senator 
Ferguson disclaimed such an intent, stating he saw ""no reason for not changing the word 'section' to 'act,' because I am of the 
opinion that that was the intention of all concerned."" 91 Cong. Rec. 479 (1945).  There simply is no persuasive evidence of an 
original design merely to preserve the South-Eastern Underwriters indictment."
591,23," The legislative materials do not demonstrate with necessary clarity ""that [Congress] has in fact used a private code, so that 
what appears to be violence to language is merely respect to special usage."" Frankfurter, Some Reflections on the Reading of 
Statutes, 47 Colum. L. Rev. 527, 543-544 (1947). "
592,24," Even under petitioners' reading, certain cooperative arrangements among insurance companies may constitute a ""boycott"" 
under § 3 (b) notwithstanding the applicability of § 2 (b) to activities that ""relate . . . closely to their status as reliable insurers,"" 
SEC v. National Securities, Inc., 393 U.S. 453, 460 (1969), and the adequacy of state regulation of the industry.  Hence, 
petitioners' line may not be as ""bright"" as they suggest. The dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE STEWART also argues that the structure of the Act supports a restrictive reading of § 3 
(b).  We do not think the dissent's restatement of the holding in FTC v. National Casualty Co., 357 U.S. 560, 564 (1958), see 
post, at 557-558, n. 4, furthers resolution of the problem at hand.  It is not disputed that Congress intended that certain forms of 
""regulation by private combinations and groups,"" 91 Cong. Rec. 1483 (1945) (remarks of Sen. O'Mahoney), remain subject to 
Sherman Act scrutiny, notwithstanding enactment of the type of ""prohibitory legislation,"" coupled with ""enforcement through a 
scheme of administrative supervision,"" that was deemed sufficient for § 2 (b) purposes in National Casualty Co.  In that case the 
Court rejected the Federal Trade Commission's argument that ""where a statute, instead of sanctioning a particular type of 
transaction, prohibits conduct in general terms and provides for enforcement through administrative action, there is realistically, 
in the absence of such enforcement, no 'regulation' in fact."" Brief for Federal Trade Commission, O. T. 1957, Nos. 435 and 436, 
p. 53.  The question that nonetheless remains is whether Congress intended to foreclose all Sherman Act protection for 
policyholders victimized by private conspiracies of insurers when a State has engaged in generally comprehensive regulation 
under § 2 (b).  We think the record does not support such a foreclosure. "
593,25," ""[Even] where prices are rigidly fixed, the members of a cartel will be able to compete with each other with respect to product 
quality unless a homogeneous product is involved.  Indeed, even if the product is homogeneous there will be room for rivalry in 
such matters as promptness in filling orders and the provision of ancillary services.  An effective division of markets, by contrast, 
might substantially wash out all opportunity for rivalry."" Sullivan, supra n. 14, at 224-225."
593,26," Counsel for petitioners stated at oral argument that he was not sure whether St. Paul had filed the specific policy change in 
issue with the director of the state insurance division.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 8.  Even if we assume that such a filing had been made, 
there is no suggestion that the State, in furtherance of its regulatory policies, authorized the concerted refusal to deal on any 
terms with St. Paul's policyholders. Although the dissenting opinion below noted ""that Rhode Island has exercised its right to regulate all material aspects of the 
business of insurance and that the actions complained of relative to withholding malpractice insurance were all part of such 
regulated business,"" 555 F.2d, at 14, this statement refers to the requirements of the proviso to § 2 (b).  The dissent did not 
argue that the agreement in question was within the contemplation of any state regulatory scheme."
593,27," We have no occasion here to decide whether the element of state regulatory direction or authorization of the particular 
practice, absent in this case, is a factor to be considered in the definition of ""boycott"" within the meaning of § 3 (b), or whether it 
comes into play as part of a possible defense under the ""state action"" doctrine, as elaborated in Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341 
(1943), and its progeny. "
594,1," Section 2 provides in full: ""(a) The business of insurance, and every person engaged therein, shall be subject to the laws of the several States which relate 
to the regulation or taxation of such business. ""(b) No Act of Congress shall be construed to invalidate, impair, or supersede any law enacted by any State for the purpose of 
regulating the business of insurance, or which imposes a fee or tax upon such business, unless such Act specifically relates to 
the business of insurance: Provided, That after June 30, 1948, the Act of July 2, 1890, as amended, known as the Sherman Act, 
and the Act of October 15, 1914, as amended, known as the Clayton Act, and the Act of September 26, 1914, known as the 
Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, shall be applicable to the business of insurance to the extent that such business is 
not regulated by State Law."" 59 Stat. 34, as amended, 61 Stat. 448, 15 U. S. C. § 1012 (1976 ed.)."

Act of June 19, 1936, known as the Robinson-Patman Anti-Discrimination Act, shall not apply to the business of insurance or to 
acts in the conduct thereof. ""(b) Nothing contained in this chapter [Act] shall render the said Sherman Act inapplicable to any agreement to boycott, coerce, 
or intimidate, or act of boycott, coercion, or intimidation."" 59 Stat. 34, as amended, 61 Stat. 448, 15 U. S. C. § 1013 (1976 ed.). "
595,3," See n. 1, supra, and n. 4, infra."
595,4," In the present case the District Court in an oral opinion held that various Rhode Island laws, including state antitrust statutes, 
made the federal antitrust laws generally inapplicable to the petitioners under § 2 (b).  That ruling was implicitly accepted by the 
Court of Appeals, and has not been questioned here.  See ante, at 540 n. 9. The legislative history in the Senate indicates that two kinds of state regulation were thought capable of suspending the federal 
antitrust laws under § 2 (b).  See 91 Cong. Rec. 1444 (1945) (remarks of Sen. O'Mahoney).  First, a State could enact its own 
antitrust laws. Senator Murdock explained that ""[insofar] as [the state laws] fail to cover the same ground covered by the 
Sherman Act and the Clayton Act, those [federal] acts become effective again"" after the moratorium. Ibid.  Second, a State could 
enact laws regulating various aspects of the business of insurance, such as rates and terms of coverage. Senator Ferguson 
explained that ""if the States were specifically to legislate upon a particular point, and that legislation were contrary to the 
Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, or the Federal Trade Commission Act, then the State law would be binding."" Id., at 1481.  See 
also id., at 1443 (remarks of Sen. McCarran and of Sen. Ferguson); id., at 1444 (remarks of Sen. White). This Court has had few occasions to consider the operation of § 2 (b).  In SEC v. National Securities, Inc., 393 U.S. 453, the 
Court held that certain Arizona regulations protecting insurance company stockholders did not regulate the ""business of 
insurance"" within the meaning of § 2 (b) and thus did not pre-empt the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The case did not 
involve the antitrust proviso of § 2 (b), and hence did not decide to what extent a State must regulate the ""business of insurance"" 
to pre-empt the federal antitrust laws. FTC v. National Casualty Co., 357 U.S. 560, is the only case in this Court involving that question.  There, the Court held that 
state statutes ""prohibiting unfair and deceptive insurance practices,"" id., at 562, pre-empted Federal Trade Commission 
regulations ""prohibiting respondent insurance companies from carrying on certain advertising practices found by the Commission 
to be false, misleading, and deceptive, in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act . . . ."" Id., at 561-562. Noting that no one 
had alleged that the state regulation was ""mere pretense,"" the Court rejected the FTC's argument that the state regulation was 
""too 'inchoate' to be 'regulation' until [the State's statutory] prohibition has been crystallized into 'administrative elaboration of 
these standards and application in individual cases.'"" Id., at 564."
595,5," In Senator Ferguson's words: ""There are certain things which a State cannot interfere with.  It cannot interfere with the application of the Sherman Act to any 
agreement to boycott, coerce, or intimidate, or an act of boycotting, coercion, or intimidation."" 91 Cong. Rec. 1443 (1945). "
596,6," Most practices condemned by the Sherman Act can be cast as an act or agreement of ""boycott, coercion, or intimidation."" For 
example, price fixing can be seen either as a refusal to deal except at a uniform price (i. e., a boycott), or as an agreement to 
force buyers to accept an offer on the sellers' common terms (i. e., coercion).  Yet state-sanctioned price fixing immunized by § 2 
(b) was plainly not intended to fall within the § 3 (b) exception.  See 91 Cong. Rec. 1481 (1945) (remarks of Sen. Ferguson)."

supra, passed the House, appeared before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee that was considering this same legislation.  He 
assured the Subcommittee that the Government did not intend to bring new prosecutions while Congress was considering 
legislation on the subject, but he insisted that the South-Eastern case should and would go forward because of the seriousness 
of the charges.  After quoting a portion of the Court's opinion set out in the text, supra, at 560-561, he stated: ""[That] case was not merely a price-fixing case, but involved very serious boycotting.  It involved boycotting by insurance 
companies of agents who would not belong to the association, and under the laws of the State in which the association 
operated, many of the acts alleged in the indictment would have been illegal."" Joint Hearing on S. 1362 et al. before the 
Subcommittees of the Committees on the Judiciary, 78th Cong., 2d Sess., 636 (1944). "
598,18," S. Rep. No. 20, 79th Cong., 1st Sess. (1945)."
598,19," In the floor debates, several Senators pointed out that the bill could be read to support pre-emption of the federal antitrust laws 
by state regulations. 91 Cong. Rec. 480 (1945).  To clarify its intent, the Senate amended S. 340 on the floor to make the 
antitrust laws expressly and fully applicable after the moratorium period.  Id., at 488."
598,20," As the bill came out of committee, the boycott provision applied only to the section establishing a short-term moratorium. Id., at 
479.  A proposal to extend the boycott provision to the full Act was offered by Senator Murdock and accepted by Senator 
Ferguson, ibid., but was never ratified by the Senate. That the boycott exception was originally drafted only to keep the Sherman Act partially in effect during the moratorium suggests 
that the provision may have been initially intended to prevent interference with the prosecution of the defendants in South-
Eastern Underwriters, who still faced trial following the decision of this Court.  Certainly, many Congressmen expressed their 
opposition to legislation that would free those defendants from liability.  See, e. g., 90 Cong. Rec. 6450 (1944) (remarks of Rep. 
Celler); id., at 6452 (remarks of Rep. LaFollette); Joint Hearings, supra n. 17, at 637 (remarks of Sen. Hatch).  On its face, the 
boycott provision removed any doubt about the Government's authority to continue with that prosecution.  Whatever its initial 
impetus, however, there is no indication that the provision was finally thought to be applicable only to the South-Eastern 
litigation."

617,1," The major producers operate numerous plants to serve a wide range of geographical markets.  The single-plant producers are 
limited in terms of the markets they can serve because of the difficulties and expense involved in long-distance transportation of 
gypsum board. "
618,2," The corporate defendants named in the indictment were: United States Gypsum Co., National Gypsum Co., Georgia Pacific 
Corp., Kaiser-Gypsum Co., Inc., Celotex Corp., and Flintkote Co.  The individual defendants included: the Chairman of the 
Board and the Executive Vice-President of United States Gypsum, the Chairman of the Board and Vice-President for Sales of 
National Gypsum, the President of Georgia Pacific, the President and the Vice-President and General Manager of Kaiser-
Gypsum, the President of Celotex, and the Chairman of the Board and the President of Flintkote.  The Gypsum Association was 
named as an unindicted coconspirator as were two other gypsum board producers -- Johns-Manville Corp. and Fibreboard Corp."
618,3," The remaining corporate defendants were United States Gypsum, National Gypsum, Georgia Pacific, and Celotex, and the 
remaining individual defendants were the Chairman of the Board and the Vice-President of Sales of National Gypsum and the 
Executive Vice-President of United States Gypsum. "
619,4," Defendants contended that the exchange of price information or verification was necessary to enable them to take advantage 
of the meeting-competition defense contained in § 2 (b) of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 730, as amended by the Robinson-Patman 
Act, 49 Stat. 1526, 15 U. S. C. § 13 (b) (1976 ed.); see Part III, infra."

620,9," ""Significantly, the judge did not tell counsel about the foreman's opinion that the jury was hopelessly deadlocked; did not 
indicate that the foreman was under the impression that the court wanted a definite verdict either for the prosecution or the 
defendants; and did not mention the directive to the jury that it should 'see if [it] can come to a verdict.'"" 550 F.2d, at 132

released to counsel to aid them in preparation of the appeal. "
621,11," ""Therefore, appellants were entitled to an instruction that their verification practice would not violate the Sherman Act if the jury 
found: (1) the appellants engaged in the practice solely to comply with the strictures of Robinson-Patman; (2) they had first 
resorted to all other reasonable means of corroboration, without success; (3) they had good, independent reason to doubt the 
buyers' truthfulness; and (4) their communication with competitors was strictly limited to the one price and one buyer at issue."" 
Id., at 126."
621,12," See Part III, infra. "
622,13," LEdHN[4B][
] [4B] Our analysis focuses solely on the elements of a criminal offense under the antitrust laws, and leaves unchanged the general 
rule that HN2[
] a civil violation can be established by proof of either an unlawful purpose or an anticompetitive effect.  See United States v. Container Corp., 393 U.S. 333, 337 (1969); id., at 341 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting).  Of course, consideration of 
intent may play an important role in divining the actual nature and effect of the alleged anticompetitive conduct.  See Chicago 
Board of Trade v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 238 (1918). "
623,14," Senator Sherman adverted to the open texture of the statutory language in 1890 and accurately forecast its consequence -- a 
central role for the courts in giving shape and content to the Act's proscriptions. ""I admit that it is difficult to define in legal language the precise line between lawful and unlawful combinations.  This must be left 
for the courts to determine in each particular case.  All that we, as lawmakers, can do is to declare general principles, and we 
can be assured that the courts will apply them so as to carry out the meaning of the law . . . ."" 21 Cong. Rec. 2460 (1890). "
624,15," In 1967, the Antitrust Division refined its guidelines to emphasize that criminal prosecutions should only be brought against 
willful violations of the law.  See The President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, Task Force 
Report: Crime and Its Impact -- An Assessment 110 (1967)."
624,16," LEdHN[7B][
] [7B] HN8[
] The exchange of price data and other information among competitors does not invariably have anticompetitive effects; 
indeed such practices can in certain circumstances increase economic efficiency and render markets more, rather than less, 
competitive. For this reason, we have held that such exchanges of information do not constitute a per se violation of the 
Sherman Act. See, e. g., United States v. Citizens & Southern Nat. Bank, 422 U.S. 86, 113 (1975); United States v. Container 
Corp., 393 U.S., at 338 (Fortas, J., concurring).  A number of factors including most prominently the structure of the industry 
involved and the nature of the information exchanged are generally considered in divining the procompetitive or anticompetitive 
effects of this type of interseller communication.  See United States v. Container Corp., supra. See generally L. Sullivan, Law of 
Antitrust 265-274 (1977).  Exchanges of current price information, of course, have the greatest potential for generating 
anticompetitive effects and although not per se unlawful have consistently been held to violate the Sherman Act. See American 
Column & Lumber Co. v. United States, 257 U.S. 377 (1921); United States v. American Linseed Oil Co., 262 U.S. 371 (1923); 
United States v. Container Corp., supra."
624,17," The possibility that those subjected to strict liability will take extraordinary care in their dealings is frequently regarded as one 
advantage of a rule of strict liability.  See J. Hall, General Principles of Criminal Law 344 (2d ed. 1960); W. LaFave & A. Scott, 
Criminal Law 222-223 (1972).  However, where the conduct proscribed is difficult to distinguish from conduct permitted and 
indeed encouraged, as in the antitrust context, the excessive caution spawned by a regime of strict liability will not necessarily 
redound to the public's benefit.  The antitrust laws differ in this regard from, for example, laws designed to insure that adulterated 
food will not be sold to consumers.  In the latter situation, excessive caution on the part of producers is entirely consistent with 
the legislative purpose.  See United States v. Park, 421 U.S. 658, 671-672 (1975). "
625,18," Congress has recently increased the criminal penalties for violation of the Sherman Act. Individual violations are now treated 
as felonies punishable by a fine not to exceed $ 100,000, or by imprisonment for up to three years, or both.  Corporate violators 
are subject to a $ 1 million fine.  15 U. S. C. § 1 (1976 ed.).  The severity of these sanctions provides further support for our 
conclusion that the Sherman Act should not be construed as creating strict-liability crimes.  Cf.  Morissette v. United States, 342 
U.S. 246, 256 (1952); Sayre, Public Welfare Offenses, 33 Colum. L. Rev. 55, 72 (1933) (strict liability generally inappropriate 
when offense punishable by imprisonment).  Respondents here were not prosecuted under the new penalty provisions since 
they were indicted prior to the December 21, 1974, effective date for the increased sanctions."
625,19," An accommodation of the civil and criminal provisions of the Act similar to that which we approve here was suggested by 
Senator Sherman in response to Senator George's argument during floor debate that the Act was primarily a penal statute to be 
construed narrowly in accord with traditional maxims: ""The first section, being a remedial statute, would be construed liberally with a view to promote its object.  It defines a civil 
remedy, and the courts will construe it liberally . . . . ""In providing a remedy the intention of the combination is immaterial. . . . ""The third section is a criminal statute, which would be construed strictly and is difficult to be enforced.  In the present state of 
the law it is impossible to describe, in precise language, the nature and limits of the offense in terms specific enough for an 
indictment."" 21 Cong. Rec. 2456 (1890). Although the bill being debated by Senators George and Sherman differed in form from the Act as ultimately passed, the 
colloquy between them indicates that Congress was fully aware of the traditional distinctions between the elements of civil and 
criminal offenses and apparently did not intend to do away with them in the Act."
625,20," LEdHN[8B][
] [8B] HN10[
] In a conspiracy, two different types of intent are generally required -- the basic intent to agree, which is necessary to 
establish the existence of the conspiracy, and the more traditional intent to effectuate the object of the conspiracy. See W. 
LaFave & A. Scott, Criminal Law 464-465 (1972).  Our discussion here focuses only on the second type of intent. "
626,21," In so holding, we do not mean to suggest that conduct undertaken with the purpose of producing anticompetitive effects would 
not also support criminal liability, even if such effects did not come to pass.  Cf.  United States v. Griffith, 334 U.S. 100, 105 
(1948). We hold only that this elevated standard of intent need not be established in cases where anticompetitive effects have 
been demonstrated; instead, proof that the defendant's conduct was undertaken with knowledge of its probable consequences 
will satisfy the Government's burden. "
627,22," Respondents contend that ""prior to the trial of this case, no court had ever held that a mere exchange of information which had 
a stabilizing effect on prices violated the Sherman Act, regardless of the purpose for the exchange."" Joint Brief for Respondents 
50.  Retroactive application of ""this judicially expanded definition of the crime"" would, the argument continues, contravene the 
""principles of fair notice embodied in the Due Process Clause."" Ibid.  While we have rejected on other grounds the ""effects only"" 
test in the context of criminal proceedings, we do not agree with respondents that the prior case law dealing with the exchange 
of price information required proof of a purpose to restrain competition in order to make out a Sherman Act violation. Certainly our decision in United States v. Container Corp., 393 U.S. 333 (1969), is fairly read as indicating that proof of an 
anticompetitive effect is a sufficient predicate for liability.  In that case, liability followed from proof that ""the exchange of price 
information has had an anticompetitive effect in the industry,"" id., at 337, and no suggestion was made that proof of a purpose to 
restrain trade or competition was also required.  Thus, at least in the post-Container period, which comprises almost the entire 
time period at issue here, respondents' claimed lack of notice cannot be credited. Nor are the prior cases treating exchanges of information among competitors more favorable to respondents' position.  See 
American Column & Lumber Co. v. United States, 257 U.S., at 400 (""[Any] concerted action . . . to cause, or which in fact does 
cause, . . . restraint of competition . . . is unlawful""); United States v. American Linseed Oil Co., 262 U.S. 371, 389 (1923) (""[A] 
necessary tendency . . . to suppress competition . . . [is] unlawful""); Maple Flooring Mfrs. Assn. v. United States, 268 U.S. 563, 
585 (1925) (purpose to restrain trade or conduct which ""had resulted, or would necessarily result, in tending arbitrarily to lessen 
production or increase prices"" sufficient for liability).  While in Cement Mfrs. Protective Assn. v. United States, 268 U.S. 588 
(1925), an exception from Sherman Act liability was recognized for conduct intended to prevent fraud, we do not read that case 
as repudiating the rule set out in prior cases; instead Cement highlighted a narrow limitation on the application of the general 
rule that either purpose or effect will support liability. We do not understand respondents to be making the related claim that they relied on the several lower court cases exempting 
interseller verification for purposes of complying with the Robinson-Patman Act from scrutiny under the Sherman Act, see infra, 
at 452-453, and thus should not be penalized if those decisions turn out to have been incorrect.  Whatever the merits of such an 
argument, respondents would appear unable to invoke it since the initiation of their verification practices antedated those lower 
court decisions."
627,23," This question was not resolved by the prior discussion because HN15[
] a purpose of complying with the Robinson-Patman 
Act by exchanging price information is not inconsistent with knowledge that such exchanges of information will have the 
probable effect of fixing or stabilizing prices.  Since we hold knowledge of the probable consequences of conduct to be the 
requisite mental state in a criminal prosecution like the instant one where an effect on prices is also alleged, a defendant's 
purpose in engaging in the proscribed conduct will not insulate him from liability unless it is deemed of sufficient merit to justify a 
general exception to the Sherman Act's proscriptions.  Cf. Cement Mfrs. Protective Assn. v. United States, supra."
627,24," Respondents maintain that their verification practices not only were for the purpose of complying with the Robinson-Patman 
Act, but also served to protect them from fraud on the part of their customers, and thus fall squarely within the Cement 
exception.  The Court of Appeals rejected this claim, 550 F.2d, at 123 n. 9, and we find no reason to upset this determination. "
628,25," Although the Belliston court did not specifically refer to Cement's ""controlling circumstance"" exception, it adopted the rationale 
of the Wall Products case where that exception was explicitly relied upon to immunize verification from the proscriptions of the 
Sherman Act."
628,26," See n. 11, supra. "
630,27," The decision in Di-Wall is ambiguous on the question of whether alternatives short of verification were exhausted prior to the 
exchange of price information.  1970 Trade Cases, para. 73,155, p. 88,557."
630,28," In Viviano Macaroni Co. v. FTC, 411 F.2d 255 (CA3 1969), the § 2 (b) defense was not recognized because the seller had 
relied solely on the report of its customer regarding other competitive offers without undertaking any investigation to corroborate 
the offer or the reliability of the customer. The Court of Appeals in the instant case read Viviano as at least suggesting, if not 
requiring, interseller verification when the veracity of the buyer was in doubt.  As we read that case, however, it simply reaffirms 
the teaching of Staley, and does not compel the further conclusion that only interseller verification will satisfy the good-faith 
requirement, even in the particular circumstances identified by the Court of Appeals.  See 550 F.2d, at 135 (Weis, J., dissenting). "
631,29," ""Although a seller may take advantage of the meeting competition defense only if it has a commercially reasonable belief that 
its price concession is necessary to meet an equally low price of a competitor, a seller may acquire this belief, and hence perfect 
its defense, by doing everything reasonably feasible -- short of violating some other statute, such as the Sherman Act -- to 
determine the veracity of a customer's statement that he has been offered a lower price. If, after making reasonable, lawful, 
inquiries, the seller cannot ascertain that the buyer is lying, the seller is entitled to make the sale. . . .  There is no need for a 
seller to discuss price with his competitors to take advantage of the meeting competition defense."" (Citations omitted.) Brief for 
United States 86-87, and n. 78.  See also App. to Pet. for Cert. 97a-99a."
631,30," It may also turn out that sustained enforcement of § 2 (f) HN20[
] of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman 
Act, which imposes liability on buyers for inducing illegal price discounts, will serve to bolster the credibility of buyers' 
representations and render reliance thereon by sellers a more reasonable and secure predicate for a finding of good faith under 
§ 2 (b).  See generally Note, Meeting Competition Under the Robinson-Patman Act, 90 Harv. L. Rev. 1476, 1495-1496 (1977). In 
both Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. FTC, 557 F.2d 971 (CA2 1977), and Kroger v. FTC, 438 F.2d 1372 (CA6 1971), buyers 
have been held liable under § 2 (f) despite the fact that the sellers were either found not to have violated the Robinson-Patman 
Act (Kroger) or were not charged with such a violation (A&P).  Certiorari has been granted in Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. to 
consider the permissibility of enforcing the Robinson-Patman Act in this manner.  435 U.S. 922 (1978)."
631,31," We need not and do not decide that in all such circumstances the defense would be unavailable.  The case-by-case 
interpretation and elaboration of the § 2 (b) defense is properly left to the other federal courts and the FTC in the context of 
concrete fact situations.  We note also that our conclusions regarding the proper interpretation of § 2 (f), see n. 30, supra, may 
well affect subsequent application of the § 2 (b) defense. "
632,32," That the § 2 (b) defense may not be available in every situation where a competing offer has in fact been made is not, in our 
view, a meaningful objection to our holding.  HN21[
] The good-faith requirement of the § 2 (b) defense implicitly suggests a 
somewhat imperfect matching between competing offers actually made and those allowed to be met.  Unless this requirement is 
to be abandoned, it seems clear that inadequate information will, in a limited number of cases, deny the defense to some who, if 
all the facts had been known, would have been entitled to invoke it.  For reasons already discussed, interseller verification does 
not provide a satisfactory solution to this seemingly inevitable problem of inadequate information.  Moreover, § 2 (b) affords only 
a defense to liability and not an affirmative right under the Act.  While sellers are, of course, entitled to take advantage of the 
defense when they can satisfy its requirements, efforts to increase its availability at the expense of broader, affirmative antitrust 
policies must be rejected. "
633,33," Allen v. United States, 164 U.S. 492 (1896). An injunction to the jury ""to deliberate with a view toward reaching an agreement 
if you can, without violence, to individual judgment,"" was also included in the judge's original instruction prior to the 
commencement of deliberations."
633,34," See n. 9, supra. "
634,35," See n. 5, supra."
634,36," The requested charge was as follows: ""Because the gist of the offense charged is a continuing agreement to raise, fix, maintain and stabilize prices of gypsum 
products, it is essential for you to determine what kind of agreement or understanding, if any, existed as to each defendant.  
Each defendant is chargeable with the acts of his or its fellow defendants and alleged co-conspirators only if the acts are done in 
furtherance of the joint venture as he or it understood it.  No defendant is to be held responsible for what some of the alleged 
conspirators, unknown to the rest, do beyond the reasonable intendment of the common agreement or understanding, if any, to 
which you may find him or it a party."" 550 F.2d, at 128-129, n. 13 (emphasis omitted). "
635,37," In this case the obligation to notify ""each other member"" of the charged conspiracy would be a manageable task; in other 
situations all ""other"" members might not be readily identifiable."
635,38," The instruction on withdrawal and proper evidence thereof may have been of particular importance here because respondents 
vigorously argued throughout the trial that competition within the industry resumed before December 27, 1968, the critical date 
for purposes of the applicable five-year statute of limitations. "
638,1," Because the issue discussed in Part IV of the Court's opinion is unlikely to arise at any retrial, I find it unnecessary to express a 
view as to it."
638,2," I do not understand the Court to take a firm position on this issue.  See ante, at 456 n. 31. "
640,*," ""There has been evidence in this case of a defendant's contacting a competitor to verify the existence or nonexistence of a 
reported lower price or other competitive condition in the market place.  This practice has been referred to as 'verification.' There 
is evidence that verification was engaged in by defendants for the purpose of compliance with the Robinson-Patman Act, one of 
the federal antitrust laws. I charge you as a matter of law that no finding of guilt may be made in this case based on verification 
engaged in for the purpose of compliance with the Robinson-Patman Act.  Further, to consider verification as any evidence 
whatsoever of an alleged price-fixing conspiracy you must first determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the purpose of 
verification was not compliance with the Robinson-Patman Act."" App. 1857."

which the statute is designed to prevent, they are, in legal contemplation, chargeable with intending that result."" United States v.

unions to eliminate employer competition over wages and working conditions.  See Connell Construction Co. v. Plumbers & 
Steamfitters Local 100, 421 U.S. 616, 622 (1975)."
647,4," In Jewel Tea the Court considered the lawfulness of a collective bargaining agreement, executed after joint multiemployer, 
multiunion negotiations, which restricted the operating hours of food store meat departments.  The Court stressed that the case "
648,," came before it ""stripped of any claim of a union-employer conspiracy against [the plaintiff],"" and that it was ""a situation where the 
unions, having obtained a marketing-hours agreement from one group of employers, [had] successfully sought the same terms 
from a single employer, [the plaintiff] not as a result of a bargain between the unions and some employers, but pursuant to what 
the unions deemed to be their own labor union interests."" Amalgamated Meat Cutters Local 189 v. Jewel Tea Co., 381 U.S. 676, 
688 (1965). Given this factual context and the acknowledgement that the marketing-hour restriction was intimately related to 
traditional mandatory collective bargaining subjects, the Court found that the agreement fell within the labor exemption to the 
antitrust laws."

the agreement is not designed to drive certain employers out of business and even though the union's organization objective is 
lawful. "

completely clear from the record, though the effect of this act was raised by respondents. Whether the court did in fact rely on 
this act is, however, immaterial inasmuch as we determine the correctness of the court's decision, not of its reasoning. (E.g.,

not relevant here, a preliminary injunction issued on September 29, 1977, on the basis of preemption. The Attorney General's 
appeal from this order is now pending before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. All proceedings on the appeal have been 
stayed, however, apparently because the district court had indicated that ARCO's motion for summary judgment should be 
granted. On June 26, 1978, summary judgment was entered permanently enjoining the Attorney General's investigation."

provided in any other contract for the sale of Prudhoe Oil Pool gas to be delivered in the lower forty-eight states or the estimated 
commodity value of natural gas at the time of first deliveries in the market to be served less applicable costs to the market. . . . 
There will also be a provision for redeterminations of a higher price in the event of: A. Regulatory authority adoption of higher "

such that variable pricing provisions can be used, and one of such variable pricing provisions results in a higher price, in which 
event, the higher of the following will apply, such higher prices to be redetermined every six months beginning with the effective 
date of such re-regulation or de-regulation. (Specific details of these pricing provisions remain to be negotiated pursuant to the 
exercise of the sole and exclusive right to negotiate created in the instrument to which this Exhibit C is attached): 1. The highest 
price in the field paid by any U.S. buyer to any seller for significant quantities of gas produced from the North Slope of Alaska to

issues.  ASHA will evaluate the education and clinical experience of non-members and issue a so-called ""equivalency

participate in various federal health care programs.  See, e.g., 20 C.F.R. § 405.1225.  While this equivalency statement may be 
helpful to speech pathologists desiring to participate in federal programs which require it, there is insufficient evidence on this 
record to find that it is comparable to the CCC.  In fact, only a handful of equivalency statements are issued each year."

that ""the words ""business or property,' . . .  refer to commercial interests or enterprises."" Just as the Court recognized the 
standing of states to recover damages to their commercial interests but not to their general economy, Id., it follows that a 
professional has standing to recover for injuries to his commercial practice.  A professional's status as an employee, rather than 
as a self-employed practitioner, is not in itself an impediment to standing under § 4.  See Bravman v. Bassett Furniture Inds., 
Inc., 552 F.2d 90, 98 & n.19 (3d Cir.), Cert. denied, 434 U.S. 823, 98 S. Ct. 69, 54 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1977); P. Areeda & D. Turner,

698,9," .  The district court quoted from paragraph 20 of plaintiff's complaint, which made this allegation (10a).  While this theory of 
membership in ASHA coerced by professional necessity of having a CCC was advanced in the complaint as a basis for liability, 
it did not furnish an exclusive theory of liability.  In a brief filed with the district court in support of her motion for summary 
judgment, plaintiff argues that she need only prove the desirability or uniqueness of the CCC, rather than its necessity, in order 
to prevail on liability.  Memorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment, 18-31.  This latter position is 
not inconsistent with a liberal reading of plaintiff's complaint.  See Bogosian, supra at 444-47. "

attested to the contrary.  See note 5, Supra.  Moreover, plaintiff's employment record indicates a professional, rather than a 
litigious, interest in obtaining a CCC.  When she accepted the position at Bryn Mawr Rehabilitation Center, she intended to fulfill 
the clinical fellowship requirement for the CCC.  Similarly, Mrs. Bogus resigned her position at Broomall Nursing Home because 
her unsupervised clinical work would not satisfy the clinical fellowship requirement. "
701,13," .  The parties have assumed that in this case the same standing principles of § 4 of the Clayton Act are applicable to alleged 
violations of both §§ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. We agree and, therefore, recognize plaintiff's standing to pursue both theories 
of liability.  Moreover, in reinstating plaintiff's standing to pursue her federal claims, there now exists a basis for pendent 
jurisdiction over her state common law claim."

representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class."" "
702,15," .  Rule 23(b) provides in pertinent part: ""(b) Class Actions Maintainable.  An action may be maintained as a class action if the prerequisites of subdivision (a) are

affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient 
adjudication of the controversy.  The matters pertinent to the findings include: (A) the interest of members of the class in 
individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions; (B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the 
controversy already commenced by or against members of the class; (C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the 
litigation of the claims in the particular forum; (D) the difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a class action."""
702,16," .  We do not imply that a named plaintiff's intention to continue his or her litigation in the absence of class certification should be 
a decisive factor in the judicial determination of the ""superiority"" issue.  The weight to be given a plaintiff's avowed intention to 
proceed with or to abandon the suit in the face of a denial of a class action certification will vary with the circumstances of each 
case and the presence of the other factors to be considered under Rule 23(b)(3).  In this case, Mrs. Bogus' intention to continue 
her suit with full vigor was only one factor among several which the district court properly considered in denying the superiority of 
a class action."
702,17," .  We note that the existence of other litigation may also weigh against class certification to the extent that such actions betoken 
an interest in individual litigation.  See Comments of Advisory Committee on Civil Rules, 39 F.R.D. 69, 104. "

exemption from the Rule of Reason.  However, the Court ""adhere(d) to the view expressed in Goldfarb that, by their nature,

708,7," .   United States v. Abbotts Dairies Div. of Fairmont Foods, Co., 315 F. Supp. 571 (E.D.Pa.1970). Judge Luongo determined that under United States v. Ruzicka, 329 U.S. 287, 67 S. Ct. 207, 91 L. Ed. 290 (1946), the issue of 
an Order's validity Vel non could not be raised as a defense to an injunction for compliance.  Thus the attempt to place monies 
on deposit with the court was meant to preserve a fund which might later be the source of refunds should the Order 
subsequently be invalidated."
708,8," .  Part of Judge Ditter's decision denied a motion by some producer cooperatives to intervene for all purposes including review

709,10," .  The government concedes as much.  Government's Brief at 60, n. 52. It is possible that handlers would seek to litigate would-be invalid orders imposing high prices even if restitution were not 
available, for relief from continuing application of the order could be beneficial and hence provide incentive.  It is our conclusion, 
however, that in such cases there would be much greater incentive simply to pass on all overcharges and avoid the costs and 
risks of litigation. We note also that in Southern Pacific Co. v. Darnell-Taenzer Lumber Co., 245 U.S. 531, 38 S. Ct. 186, 62 L. Ed. 451 (1918), a 
case involving an overcharge on freight by a railroad, Justice Holmes for the Court connected the rejection of the passing on 
defense in part to privity requirements.  It followed that because only a shipper Could sue the railroad for overcharges the 
effective prevention of overcharges required that the shipper collect the full overcharge as damage.  The result is the same if, 
apart from privity, only the shipper Would sue.  (Notably, this case was not an antitrust case.)"
709,11," .  Hanover did articulate a possible exception to its rejection of a passing on defense in addition to ""cost-plus"" contracts: ""We 
also recognize that where no differential can be proved between the price unlawfully charged and some price that the seller was "
710,," required by law to charge, establishing damages might require a showing of loss of profits to the buyer."" Id. at 494, 88 S. Ct. at 
2232.  The Court's only elaboration is by way of footnote: Some courts appear to have treated price discrimination cases under the Robinson-Patman Act as in this category.  See, E. g., 
American Can Co. v. Russellville Canning Co., 191 F.2d 38 (C.A. 8th Cir. 1951); American Can Co. v. Bruce's Juices, 187 F.2d 
919, opinion modified, 190 F.2d 73 (C.A. 5th Cir.), petition for cert. dismissed, 342 U.S. 875, 72 S. Ct. 165, 96 L. Ed. 657 (1951). 
(Id. at 494 n. 10, 88 S. Ct. at 2232) In the present case the invalid order price was indeed, at the relevant time, on its face required by law to be paid to the 
producers, and Abbotts does not argue that there was any difference between that amount and the price charged.  Yet despite 
this linguistic similarity to the ""no-differential"" reference, the present case bears no resemblance to the Robinson-Patman cases 
cited by the Court in Hanover in explanation of its dictum.  Those price discrimination cases have been viewed as requiring 
under Robinson-Patman proof of actual economic loss as an element of a plaintiff's prima facie case, whereas recovery for an 
overcharge merely requires proof of the overcharge itself.  See McGuire, The Passing On Defense and the Right of Remote 
Purchasers to Recover Treble Damages Under Hanover Shoe, 33 U.Pitt.L.Rev. 177, 186-87 n. 33 (1971). We need not 
comment whether this is a correct distinction for we simply do not believe that the Court's reference was meant to undercut the 
reasons for its holding.  The most recent Supreme Court case involving the ""passing on"" issue, Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 
U.S. 720, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977), neglected even to mention the ""no differential"" reference.  In rejecting the use 
of passing on as a device by which remote purchasers could recover damages against defendants who could not use passing 
on as a defense, Mr. Justice White, the author of Hanover, observed for the Court: (T)his Court in Hanover Shoe indicated the narrow scope it intended for any exception to its rule barring pass-on defenses by 
citing, as the only example of a situation where the defense might be permitted, a pre-existing cost-plus contract.  In such a 
situation, the purchaser is insulated from any decrease in its sales as a result of attempting to pass on the overcharge, because 
its customer is committed to buying a fixed quantity regardless of price.  The effect of the overcharge is essentially determined in 
advance, without reference to the interaction of supply and demand that complicates the determination in the general case.  (Id. 
at 2070 (emphasis added)). Given all the above considerations, we agree with the district court that the argued gap in the applicability of Hanover should not 
justify use of the passing on defense.  The Government's contention that the ""no-differential"" reference was meant as a limitation 
on the use of the passing on defense rather than as an exception to it is semantical and is not a persuasive explanation of Illinois 
Brick's failure to mention it."
710,12," .  It is not clear from the present record or from the parties' briefs or arguments whether the invalid Order price for the period in 
issue (a period preceding the August 20, 1970, injunction) was required pursuant to a construction of the injunction's commands 
or by some other method.  Abbotts maintains, and the district court found, that Abbotts was able to obtain an adequate supply of 
milk at its proposed bracket price up to the August 20, 1970, injunction. Tr. Oral Argument, May 22, 1978, at 3 (statement by 
counsel for Abbotts).  Nevertheless, all parties are in agreement that as a result of the Secretary's invalid August 20, 1969, 
Order, Abbotts has been required to pay some substantial amount for milk in excess both of the last valid marketing order price 
($ 7.17 cwt.) and the intermediary bracket price which Abbotts proposed.  This matter can be definitely determined on remand. "
711,13," .  In Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Florida, 295 U.S. 301, 55 S. Ct. 713, 79 L. Ed. 1451 (1935), although the Court denied 
restitution to the party who paid, pursuant to an order later held invalid, freight rates in excess of the last valid rates, the Court's 
analysis rested on the view that restitutionary power was ""ancillary"" to the power of the district court to determine the validity of 
the Commission's order.  Id. at 314. It is our view that an analogous equitable restitutionary power exists in this case, subject of 
course to the equitable principles enunciated in Atlantic Coast.  See also Moss v. Civil Aeronautics Board, 172 U.S.App.D.C.

712,15," .  The stated fact that Abbotts continued to obtain milk at the proposed bracket price until the injunction seems to undermine 
the district court's decision to remand for a determination of the price which Abbotts would have had to pay for milk for the 
relevant period, since the relevant period preceded the injunction."
712,16," .  The provision conferring jurisdiction to the Secretary, 7 U.S.C. § 608c(15)(A), does not provide any specific indication that the 
Secretary may go beyond the determination initially of the validity or scope of a marketing order.  In any event the issues left to 
be decided in this case are not of the kind which are peculiarly within the expertise of the Secretary and which might otherwise 
justify resort to the administrative process.  See Nader v. Allegheny Airlines, 426 U.S. 290, 305-06, 96 S. Ct. 1978, 48 L. Ed. 2d 
643 (1976). "

715,19," .  At present both the Government and Pennmarva have acknowledged the acceptability of employing the reserve in the 
producer-settlement fund as the sole source of refund to Abbotts. Tr. of Oral Argument, May 22, 1978, at 24-25 (statement of 
counsel for Pennmarva); Government's Brief at 7.  This is so even though the overpayments consist of money paid to producers 
directly in 1969 and 1970, and even though some producers presently in the market were not direct beneficiaries of the 
excessive invalid order price for the period in issue.  We believe that this fluid fund, designed essentially as a pool by which milk 
prices may be made uniform, is a permissible source for the refunding of the overpayments at issue here.  See Borden, supra; 
Fairmont, supra. We emphasize that the above decision is not based on any view that producers are liable In personam and is 
intended to be applicable solely to the factual situation in which a reserve fund exists.  We do not pass upon the situation in 
which no fund exists or in which restitution is sought from the producers themselves.  Nor do we decide upon the availability of 
the passing on defense where producers are sought to be held personally liable for overpayments. "
718,1," 15 U.S.C. § 1 provides in part: HN1[
] Every contract, combination, in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce 
among the several states, or with foreign nations is declared to be illegal. . . ."
718,2," 15 U.S.C. § 15 reads as follows: HN2[
] Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws 
may sue therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an 
agent, without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the 
cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee. "
723,3," The District Court instructed the jury, in depth, with what appears to have been great care. Obviously, we cannot quote all of 
the instructions in this opinion. For clarity, however, we do quote the following (appearing at Pages 124-128 of the printed 
Appendix). ""A price-fixing conspiracy may constitute any mutual agreement or arrangement or understanding between two or more persons 
to sell at a uniform price or to raise or lower or to stabilize prices. Thus, a common plan or understanding knowingly made or 
arranged or entered into between two or more sellers engaged in interstate trade or commerce who adopt or follow or adhere to 
any pricing formula which will result in raising or lowering or maintaining at fixed levels prices charged for goods or services sold 
in interstate trade or commerce would constitute a price-fixing conspiracy in violation of the federal anti-trust laws. ""A contract, combination, or conspiracy which has the effect of fixing, maintaining or stabilizing resale prices constitutes a 
violation of the antitrust laws and is an unreasonable restraint of interstate or foreign commerce as a matter of law. Whether the 
prices agreed to be fixed, maintained or stabilized, are reasonable or unreasonable is not material. ""Therefore, if you find that there was a contract, combination or conspiracy which had the effect of fixing, maintaining, or 
stabilizing resale prices then you must find that the participants in the contract, combination, or conspiracy violated the law. ""You are instructed that defendant Nissan-USA had the right to enter into various agreements with its franchised Datsun dealers. 
It is, of course, common for one business enterprise to enter into many oral and written agreements with another business 
enterprise during the regular and ordinary conduct of its business. Not all agreements violate the antitrust law.  The only type of 
agreement with which you are to be concerned is the agreements alleged by plaintiffs to be unlawful under the antitrust laws - 
that is, anticompetitive agreements between defendants and all Datsun dealers to sell and advertise only at fixed prices, to 
establish exclusive territories, and to refrain from selling Datsuns to particular classes of customers."" "

727,2," .  In addition to the motion to dismiss, presently pending before the Court is Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment with 
respect to certain affirmative defenses pleaded in Defendants' Answer.  In part, Plaintiffs' motion involves the same issue of 
exclusive regulatory jurisdiction raised by the motion to dismiss and is accordingly governed by the discussion in the body of this 
Memorandum.  In part, Plaintiffs' motion relates to claims of primary jurisdiction and exhaustion of remedies asserted by 
Defendants.  However, Defendants have presently withdrawn those defenses and in view of the current posture of the case the 
Court finds it inappropriate to entertain Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment with regard to these claims. "
728,3," .  Subsequent to the filing of the post-Carterfone tariffs, the F.C.C. and a number of state agencies instituted investigations into 
the problems posed to the telecommunications system by interconnection. In 1977, the F.C.C. established a registration

730,8," .  In addition to Plaintiffs' antitrust challenge to Defendants' tariffs, Plaintiffs' complaint sets forth additional charges which do not 
relate directly to the tariff provisions.  Among these charges are claims that Defendants have conspired to copy and 
misappropriate Plaintiffs' equipment and claims that Defendants have conspired to defeat free and unlimited access by Plaintiffs 
to the various regulatory agencies monitoring Defendants' conduct.  Defendants describe these non-tariff matters as ancillary to 
the interconnection and pricing issues herein and equally subject to dismissal on implied immunity/exclusive jurisdiction grounds.  
See, e. g., United States v. National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., supra; United States Navigation Company v. 
Cunard Steamship Co., 284 U.S. 605, 52 S. Ct. 30, 76 L. Ed. 518 (1932). Given the Court's ruling that no absolute immunity 
from antitrust liability obtains in this case, the Court cannot dismiss these non-tariff charges on that basis.  Defendants have 
urged independent grounds for dismissing these claims, but while the Court is concerned whether misappropriation is properly 
pleaded as an antitrust violation, see Monitor Business Machines, Inc. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 1978-1 Trade Cases, No. 
62,030, at 74, 445-46, (C.D.) Cal. 1978), and whether Plaintiffs' assertions of denial of access to the regulatory process

738,15," .  After the trial had been under way for three months or so, the court realized that because the proceedings were bifurcated, an 
avoidable complexity might arise at the end of the first phase if customary practice was followed. That is, if the alternates were 
excused when liability deliberations began, and if, as came to be the case, defendant was found liable, we would proceed to the 
damages trial (of substantially greater length than most trials) with no alternates at all. To avoid this the parties were invited to 
stipulate, and did stipulate, that all jurors, regulars and alternates, who remained with us when it came time to decide would 
participate in seeking a verdict, all thus becoming ""regular"" jurors; that the same rule would apply to both phases of the case; 
and that a unanimous verdict would be required no matter what number participated, provided that there was no agreement to 
accept a verdict by any number less than six. Shortly after this stipulation was reached, the court, with the consent of counsel, 
excused one of the twelve jurors whose husband had suffered a heart attack."
738,16," .  It seems fair to treat the present contention as a belated, retrospective motion for a mistrial. For the practical effect of what 
has happened is that Kodak, while registering its criticism at the trial, without seeking relief and after nothing could be done 
about it anyhow, made no suggestion that the trial should be stopped, took its chances on the verdict, and now wants the 
adverse result erased. "

failure to show a conspiracy with the purpose and effect to restrain trade; failure to establish that an unfair labor practice had 
been committed; failure to establish tortious interference with contract; and protection of the union activity under §§ 6 and 20 of

bargaining or other mutual aid or protection, and shall also have the right to refrain from any or all of such activities except to the 
extent that such right may be affected by an agreement requiring membership in a labor organization as a condition of 
employment as authorized in section 158(a)(3) of this title. "
773,12," Apparently neither union sought to represent Muko's employees, see Answer of Pennsylvania Council at Par. 14; Answer of 
Pittsburgh Council at Par. 14, but this does not mean there was not a labor dispute with HN4[

defined in the NLRA, includes any controversy concerning terms, tenure or conditions of employment, or concerning the association or representation

776,5," The construction industry proviso reads: nothing in this subsection shall apply to an agreement between a labor organization and an employer in the construction industry 
relating to the contracting or subcontracting of work to be done at the site of the construction, alteration, painting, or repair of a 
building, structure, or other work.  29 U.S.C.  § 158(e). "
777,6," The dissenters did not contend that the Connell agreement fell outside the prohibition in Section 8(e).  They contended only 
that even if the agreement itself was illegal, since its object - organization of the excluded subcontractors - was lawful, the 
exclusive remedy should be the recovery of single damages under § 303 of the Labor-Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.  § 
187, rather than treble damages under Section 4 of the Clayton Act. Justice Douglas qualified that position only to the extent of 
suggesting that if the complaint charged concert of action between the union and the benefited contractors, the § 303 remedy 
would not be exclusive, and antitrust remedies would be available."
777,2," There was no evidence that Local 100's organizing campaign was connected with any agreement with members of the 
multiemployer bargaining unit, and the only evidence of agreement among those subcontractors was the ""most favored nation"" 
clause in the collective-bargaining agreement.  In fact, Connell has not argued the case on a theory of conspiracy between the 
union and unionized subcontractors. It has simply relied on the multiemployer agreement as a factor enhancing the restraint of 
trade implicit in the subcontracting agreement it signed. "

eliminate the increased competition that would result if both IBM and COMSAT entered the market independently; (2) whether 
the joint entry would eliminate the competitive benefits that could arise if either IBM or COMSAT entered the market and the 
other did not enter but was perceived as a potential entrant ""[remaining] at the edge of the market, continually threatening to 
enter,"" United States v. Penn-Olin Chem. Co., 378 U.S. 158, 173, 84 S.Ct. 1710, 1718, 12 L.Ed.2d 775, 787 (1964) (the so-

783,5," FCC summarized its reasoning thusly: In sum, we have chosen to dispose of SBS' Applications without a trial-type evidentiary hearing because (1) the benefits to the 
public of a more rapid institution of services far outweigh any possible benefits of such timeconsuming procedures; (2) ""facts"" 
which lend themselves to adduction by oral testimony would not be forthcoming in such proceedings; (3) in ten years of 
rulemaking and application comment proceedings the issues now before us have been explored in detail and no new material is 
sought to be placed before us through trial-type evidentiary procedures; (4) we have assumed for the purposes of analysis that 
the parties' contentions are correct and drawn appropriate inferences therefrom; (5) in view of the conditions and limitations we 
are imposing herein, as well as our continuing regulatory supervision and the remedies available to us, we can and will assure 
that the SBS proposal will serve the public interest. The domestic satellite field remains experimental, and speculation about its 
future is as tenable through the notice and comment procedures which we have adopted, as it would be in trial-type evidentiary 
proceedings.  In this unique environment, SBS' future actions and conduct, under our close regulatory supervision, will be far 
more determinative than would speculation in an evidentiary proceeding. Satellite Business Sys., 62 F.C.C.2d 997, 1068, reconsideration denied, 64 F.C.C.2d 872 (1977). "

amended; in the Federal Communications Commission where applicable to common carriers engaged in wire or radio

be exercised as follows: (b) Whenever the Commission or Board vested with jurisdiction thereof shall have reason to believe that any person is violating 
or has violated any of the provisions of sections 13, 14, 18, and 19 of this title, it shall issue and serve upon such person and the 
Attorney General a complaint stating its charges in that respect, and containing a notice of a hearing upon a day and at a place

such proceeding shall be reduced to writing and filed in the office of the Commission or Board.  If upon such hearing the 
Commission or Board, as the case may be, shall be of the opinion that any of the provisions of said sections have been or are 
being violated, it shall make a report in writing, in which it shall state its findings as to the facts, and shall issue and cause to be

absence of competition in even a closely-related market, such as ""the manufacture or sale of equipment to attach to the end of 
the telephone lines."" L. Sullivan, Antitrust § 239, at 745 (1977); see Note, Competition in the Telephone Equipment Industry: 
Beyond Telerent, 86 Yale L.J. 538 (1977). Similarly, specialized submarkets of a market that as a whole is a natural monopoly 
may not themselves be of that condition.  Here, for instance, the provision of private line communications systems is not 
comparable, in terms of the potential for competition, to the provision of local telephone service.  See note 82 infra. "

broadcasting is one of free competition,"" unlike that for telephone and telegraph common carriers).  Occasionally, of course, 
competition may indirectly conflict with regulatory goals.  Thus FCC could not encourage competition by more broadcasters than 
there are usable frequencies."

793,84," At times, an agency's regulatory statute has been found to have expressly altered the responsibilities the agency would 
otherwise have had under § 11. For instance, the Interstate Commerce Commission is directed by § 11 to enforce the Clayton 
Act with respect to carriers within its jurisdiction, but § 5 of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.  § 5 (1970 & Supp. V 1976), 
directs it to approve mergers or consolidations of such carriers if it finds that that would better serve the public.  Compare

U.S. 154, 156-157, 86 S.Ct. 277, 278, 15 L.Ed.2d 223, 224-225 (1965). In Denver, the Supreme Court recognized an exception 
from strict ICC enforcement of the Clayton Act in those situations in which consolidation may be granted in the public interest 
under § 5. See Denver & R.G.W. R.R.  v. United States, supra note 48, 387 U.S. at 496-497, 87 S.Ct. at 1761-1762, 18 L.Ed.2d

legislative history indicate that Congress intended that § 11 be inapplicable in cases such as this.  FCC was subjected to § 11 by 
the Communications Act of 1934, and the committee reports at that time note only that its inclusion was ""made necessary by the 
setting up of the new commission and conferring upon it jurisdiction over communications."" 4 B. Schwartz, The Economic

United States at 4. The doctrine of primary jurisdiction might be a factor delaying litigation by the Antitrust Division, and where FCC's obligation to 
enforce the Clayton Act is absolute, the dual authority of the Department of Justice may not be certain at all.  Compare California

U.S.App.D.C. 390, 555 F.2d 862 (en banc 1977), discussing the possibility that a regulatory agency's determination on antitrust 
issues might collaterally estop other arms of the Federal Government."
794,86," It could be argued that there is no Clayton Act violation when the beneficial effects of a merger or joint venture will outweigh its 
anticompetitive impact.  Courts generally, however, have been unwilling to undertake the difficult task of taking into account even 
offsetting advantages closely related to the harm to the economy that a prohibited merger is thought to engender.  See, e.g., 
United States v. Philadelphia Nat'l Bank, supra note 77.  But see United States v. General Dynamics Corp., 415 U.S. 486, 94 
S.Ct. 1186, 39 L.Ed.2d 530 (1974). See generally FTC v. Proctor & Gamble Co., 386 U.S. 568, 589-599, 87 S.Ct. 1224, 1236-

may influence the decision on where to set the cutoff points for the establishment of a violation through evidence of impact on 
the competitive structure.  See note 136 infra."
794,87," Any argument that § 11 was intended merely to remove FTC's responsibility over regulated industries and not to direct the

which FCC must search out a Clayton Act violation.  Surely, it may not assume a violation, or assume or find facts that on their 
face show a violation, and then approve a valuable license for the violator without any discussion at all of its § 11 duty. The 
Commission will be free, of course, to abandon its assumption on remand and to analyze the actual situation."
794,91," See Baker, The Antitrust Division, Department of Justice: The Role of Competition in Regulated Industries, 11 B.C. Ind. & 
Com. L. Rev. 571, 591 (1970). In general, ""[the] extent to which antitrust enforcement is consistent with the regulatory scheme 
will obviously vary from industry to industry."" L. Sullivan, Antitrust, § 239, at 746 (1977).  The applicability of antitrust principles 
depends not only on the characteristics of the industry but also on the purposes of the statutory scheme and the language of the 
congressional directives.  Even absent § 11, therefore, antitrust considerations will often be extremely weighty.  See, e.g., FMC 
v. Aktiebolaget Svenska Amerika Linien, supra note 41, 390 U.S. at 245-246, 88 S.Ct. at 1009-1010, 19 L.Ed.2d at 1077-
1078 (""once an antitrust violation is established, this alone will normally constitute substantial evidence that the agreement is "
795,," 'contrary to the public interest,' unless other evidence in the record fairly detracts from the weight of this factor""); Otter Tail Power 
Co.  v. United States, supra note 43, 410 U.S. at 374, 93 S.Ct. at 1028, 35 L.Ed.2d at 366 (in the field there under review 
Congress wanted ""competition to the maximum extent possible consistent with the public interest""). It would seem logical that the standard we have sought is to be found in the Supreme Court's opinion in Denver, but that 
decision provides no easy answer.  Though the Court employed some language indicating that ICC had an unswerving duty to 
enforce the Clayton Act, see note 74 supra, it also referred to a balancing process.  See 387 U.S. at 494, 87 S.Ct. at 1760, 18 
L.Ed.2d at 913 (""the power or responsibility to weigh anticompetitive consequences""); id. at 498, 87 S.Ct. at 1762, 18 L.Ed.2d at 
916 (ICC must consider anticompetitive impact ""under its duty to determine that the proposed transaction is in the 'public 
interest' and for a 'lawful object'""); id. at 504, 87 S.Ct. at 1766, 18 L.Ed.2d at 919 (""if such an alliance would in fact be against the 
public interest, then § 7 of the Clayton Act requires that it be stopped in its incipiency"" (emphasis supplied)); id. at 506, 87 S.Ct. 
at 1766, 18 L.Ed.2d at 920 (discussing other public interest factors).  Justice White's separate opinion expressed his belief that 
the Court's holding was that ""only those acquisitions of stock which are not suspect under § 7 of the Clayton Act are permissible 
under § 20a [of the Interstate Commerce Act],"" id. at 508, 87 S.Ct. at 1767, 18 L.Ed.2d at 921, and the Court did not expressly 
dispute this characterization. The task of interpreting this aspect of Denver is complicated by the dichotomy between the standards proper under § 5 and § 
20a of the Interstate Commerce Act, both of which were involved in that case, see note 84 supra, and by the many uses to which 
the term ""public interest"" may be put.  Obviously any § 7 violation is contrary to the public interest as expressed in the Clayton 
Act. On the other hand, the overall public interest - to the extent it can be ascertained - might be furthered in a specific case by 
approval of the transaction despite the violation.  The absence of more precise language in Denver was no doubt due to lack of 
any need to formulate a categorical measuring rod for agency operations under § 11; the Court merely had to determine whether 
an immediate hearing into the Clayton Act contention was necessary. We believe that the standard we have derived is consistent with - indeed required by - the Supreme Court's decisions in Denver 
and related cases.  See cases discussed in note 88 supra. The Court in Denver highlighted the agency's dual ""statutory 
obligations to protect the public interest and to enforce the antitrust laws."" 387 U.S. at 498, 87 S.Ct. at 916, 18 L.Ed.2d at 1762 
(emphasis supplied); accord, id. at 493, 87 S.Ct. at 1759-1760, 18 L.Ed.2d at 913 (""[the] responsibility under § 11 of the Clayton 
Act to enforce that Act's provisions is one of"" the ""overall ICC responsibilities"" (footnote omitted)).  The reconciliation we have 
achieved appears to us to be the only way to assure that both obligations are fulfilled to the greatest extent possible."

795,93," Our duty under Chenery to refrain from substituting our judgment for that of the agency, see SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 
80, 88, 63 S.Ct. 454, 459, 87 L.Ed. 626, 633 (1943), would not necessarily operate to bar us from inquiring whether SBS's 
license could conceivably be approved under the standard we have just elucidated.  The reason is that FCC's opinion makes 
clear that it would like to license SBS if at all legally possible, and our decision herein has not changed the factors that must be 
considered but has merely modified the weight that must be assigned one of them.  See generally Friendly, Chenery Revisited: 
Reflections on Reversal and Remand of Administrative Orders, 1969 Duke L.J. 199. Nonetheless, FCC is far more qualified than 
we to determine whether enforcement of the Clayton Act would deny the public adequate service in this field. "
796,94," Those antitrust contentions not falling within the purview of the Clayton Act, see note 35 supra, were analyzed under the 
proper balancing framework since § 11 is not implicated therein."
796,95," Satellite Business Sys., supra note 5, 62 F.C.C.2d at 1067. The Department of Justice argues that we need not accept FCC's 
characterization of its reasoning but sould look beneaht the surface of its opinion where, we are told, we will see that it really did 
not assume the ""worst case"" but instead believed that SBS is not truly anticompetitive. We must reject this invitation, for it would 
embroil us in probing the mental processes of the administrative decisionmaker - an issue far removed from our function in 
reviewing agency action.  See United States v. Morgan (Morgan IV), 313 U.S. 409, 422, 61 S.Ct. 999, 1004, 85 L.Ed. 1429, 
1435 (1941), quoting United States v. Morgan (Morgan II), 304 U.S. 1, 18, 58 S.Ct. 773, 776, 82 L.Ed. 1129, 1132 (1938); 
Gifford, The Morgan Cases: A Retrospective View, 30 Ad. L. Rev. 237, 276-287 (1978). While the Department of Justice would 
limit its doctrine to cases in which it is clear that the result chosen could not have been reached by the putative rationale or in 
which essential premises of the putative rationale are mysteriously absent from the agency's expressed reasoning, we reach the 
same outcome - more properly we think - in our holding that the agency's decision, analyzed by its own terms, is arbitrary and 
not explained with sufficient clarity to allow adequate judicial review.  See Humboldt Express, Inc.  v. ICC,     U.S.App.D.C.    ,    , 
567 F.2d 1135, 1337 (1977). The Department is correct that FCC made numerous statements indicating disbelief that SBS's entry could injure competition.  
One reason given for rejecting the perceived potential competition doctrine was that the many years of prelicensing regulatory 
delay that a perceived potential entrant could expect to face was an imposing barrier to entry.  Of course, the presence of 
regulation is a factor of which account is taken in business decisions and Clayton Act analysis, see United States v. Marine 
Bancorp., 418 U.S. 602, 94 S.Ct. 2856, 41 L.Ed.2d 978 (1974), and this delay, like other barriers to entry, might minimize the 
pressure for limit pricing by existing competitors. See Comment, The Potential Competition Doctrine After Marine 
Bancorporation, 63 Geo. L.J. 969, 975 (1975); cf.  United States v. Falstaff Brewing Co., 410 U.S. 526, 531-533, 93 S.Ct. 1096, 
1100-1101, 35 L.Ed.2d 475, 481-482 (1973). Nonetheless, now that it is established that this service is in the public interest, as 
is open competition in the field, a license applicant without the antitrust problems of SBS should not have to withstand long 
delays.  Furthermore, the Commission's concern should not be limited to day-to-day pricing decisions.  An important source of 
competition in industries such as this one takes place in improvements in the quality and capability of the technology, as IBM 
knows from its own experience.  So, as the Antitrust Division informed FCC, a potential entrant may spur competition by its 
threat to enter in 5 years or so with a new generation of equipment.  FCC did not discuss this possibility in the order under 
review, but we assume it will on remand, or else explain the failure to do so."

797,97," See note 22 supra and accompanying text.  FCC also suggested that it would be unwise to delay the commencement of an 
advanced service that it had found to be beneficial to the public.  But we assume that FCC would never listen to license-
challengers until that threshold had been crossed, and subscription to hearing-denial on that ground would effectively deny 
challengers the right ever to present countervailing considerations through the medium of an evidentiary hearing."

discretion standard, but noted that it would ""closely scrutinize"" that decision.  411 U.S. at 763, 93 S.Ct. at 1880, 36 L.Ed.2d at

hearing controlled by the explicit standards of the type found in the Communications Act. See notes 108-109 infra and

support the failure to hold a hearing that the Commission has presented us with.  See City of Lafayette v. SEC, 147

799,116," In an effort to justify its failure to hold a hearing, FCC notes that its continuing regulatory supervision will allow it to take some 
corrective measures in the future should SBS prove anticompetitive in actual operation.  But as we have discussed, see note 
100 supra, this cannot substitute for meaningful pre-licensing antitrust review. If FCC's decision took effect, a corporate structure would be effectuated and several hundred million dollars invested.  These 
commitments would be difficult and costly to reverse in the future, should FCC eventually conclude that in light of SBS's 
performance its licensing was improvident.  In view of this, it becomes difficult to characterize the situation accurately as 
""experimental"" and on that ground to justify a lesser standard of inquiry.  Network Project, on the other hand, involved the 
problem of vertical integration and the resulting danger of restraints on competition.  Should such behavior actually come to 
pass, FCC could realistically deal with it by remedial orders - for example, directing suppliers to offer service on a 
nondiscriminatory basis.  A similar effort might deal with a realization of the threat of IBM's entrenchment, see Satellite Business 
Sys., supra note 5, 62 F.C.C.2d at 1095-1096, but as for the principal contention in the present case - involving the Clayton Act - 
FCC would either have to break SBS up or affirmatively order it to compete more vigorously.  Because it is much easier to 
remove restraints than to force a positive change in competitive attitude, the agency has correspondingly less latitude to 
""experiment"" without conducting thorough evidentiary hearings to study the likely consequences before they begin to occur.

specific, disputed adjudicative facts concerning a particular applicant.  In the instant appeals, FCC is examining such a specific

802,137," Satellite Business Sys., supra note 5, 62 F.C.C.2d at 1092."
802,138," FCC said that it had assumed that licensing of SBS would harm competition in the market, but it could not have meant an 
overall decline because it somehow considered the beneficial effect of competition with AT&T to be a separate countervailing 
factor.  We assume that on remand FCC will more precisely explain its reasoning in this regard. Execution of its duties on remand will necessarily require it to consider its definition of the relevant product market and 
submarkets, if any.  The order under review properly focused in detail on the price, characteristics and use of, and the 
interchangeability between, the service to be provided by SBS and that of other terrestrial and satellite carriers.See E.I. duPont "
803,," de Nemours & Co. (Cellophane ), 351 U.S. 377, 76 S.Ct. 994, 100 L.Ed. 1264 (1956). But FCC seemingly ignored the possibility 
that, though there might be a generally high level of cross-elasticity of demand, there might also be significant groups of users 
whose needs would make them captives of the SBS technology and would give SBS monopoly pricing power within certain 
limits.  See United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 86 S.Ct. 1698, 16 L.Ed.2d 778 (1966). See also Brief for Intervenor

current systems rely in significant part on ""terrestrial connections between earth stations and communications consumers""; 
""[since] existing terrestrial lines are relatively slow and costly, and offer only limited signal quality, many of the inherent

violate § 7 and whether a benefit to competition in the overall market could offset that injury, compare United States v. 
Philadelphia Nat'l Bank, supra note 77, 374 U.S. at 370, 83 S.Ct. at 1745, 10 L.Ed.2d at 949, are questions we need not now

821,10," We have not previously considered the constitutionality of any part of G. L. c. 93B.  Hein-Werner Corp. v. Jackson Indus., Inc.,

Inc. v. Renault Northeast, Inc., 367 Mass. 464 (1975), we did not have to reach contentions of a conflict with Federal antitrust 
law."
821,11," In Forest Home Dodge, Inc. v. Karns, 29 Wis. 2d 78, 93 (1965), the State statute provided that manufacturers would be denied 
the privilege of operating dealerships in territories where present franchisees had complied with their contractual requirements of 
adequate representation.  The court wrote: ""While admittedly in this particular case the transactions between [an automobile 
dealer] and the manufacturer or distributor are transactions in interstate commerce, there is no evidence that there is a burden 
on interstate commerce or that the burden is 'undue.'"" See also Ford Motor Co. v. Pace, 206 Tenn. 559, 571 (1960) (no 
commerce clause violation in statute permitting license to manufacture or distribute to be revoked for coercive practices 
including threats of franchise termination). "
822,12," The Virginia statute would have banned a new dealership if the Commissioner found after hearing that there was reasonable 
evidence the market would not support all the dealerships in the particular line-make.  The Georgia law prohibited new 
dealerships in the absence of a showing that existing dealers were not providing adequate representation or that their business 
would not be reduced by the addition of the new dealer."
822,13," Although the court stressed that generality, perhaps it meant only to espouse the more limited proposition that ""[t]he State 
cannot assert the purpose of preserving competition as appropriate justification for denying [manufacturers] a new franchise in 
the location of their choosing."" ""[Manufacturers] must be accorded free access to every market in the Nation."" 445 F. Supp. at 
906-907. Whatever merit such a view of the commerce clause may have in light of the State's known powers of economic regulation, the 
Massachusetts law comes into play only where there is already a franchise in ""the relevant market area,"" and therefore no 
manufacturer could be excluded by the Massachusetts statute from any market. "
823,14," A recent example is Oreck Corp. v. Whirlpool Corp., 579 F.2d 126 (2d Cir. 1978) (en banc).  Whirlpool dropped Oreck as a

unlikely to consider."" Id. at 69."
824,17," In Cantor the Court rejected a private utility's claim that its free distribution of light bulbs was immunized from Sherman Act 
attack because the program had been sanctioned by the State Public Service Commission as part of the utility's rate structure

no State agency had ever specifically addressed itself to the desirability of the localized free light bulb program: ""the State's 
policy is neutral on the question."" 428 U.S. at 585. The program was that of a private company ""and there [was] no claim that 
any state action violated the antitrust laws."" Id. at 591. In Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773 (1975), a county bar 
association set a minimum fee schedule in the exercise of rulemaking power delegated by the State bar association, which was

826,22," In Orrin W. Fox Co. v. New Motor Vehicle Bd. of Cal., 440 F. Supp. 436 (C.D. Cal. 1977) (three-judge court), a California 
statute allowed any established franchisee to obtain an automatic injunction against a new dealership in the same line and 
geographic area, pending decision by a State board whether to authorize the new franchise. By the statute's operation, a new 
dealer was held off for fifteen months.  The District Court held the statute unconstitutional and enjoined its enforcement, stating 
that the new dealer and the manufacturer could not be barred without prior hearing from enjoying the liberty of business 
dealings.  Pending direct appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, the injunction was stayed by a single Justice, who 
believed that the full Court would note probable jurisdiction and a majority would probably reverse the judgment of the District 
Court.  Mr. Justice Rehnquist wrote: ""While it may well be that there remains a core area of liberty to engage in a gainful 
occupation that may not be 'arbitrarily' denied by the State, I do not think that the claim to establish an automobile dealership 
whenever and wherever one chooses is within that core area.  . . . ""The cases upon which the District Court specifically relied in concluding that the California Act was unconstitutional . . . all . . . 
involved 'property' interests found to be protected under the Due Process Clause against deprivation without prior hearing.  . . . 
But I cannot accept, and do not believe that a majority of this Court would accept, the proposition that respondents' 'liberty' 
interest in establishing a car dealership was also a 'property interest' which is protected against deprivation without prior hearing

tariffs with the Commission governing the terms, rates, and conditions of its service. The General Departments provide AT&T, 
Western Electric, Bell Labs, and the Bell Operating Companies with various kinds of advice and assistance. The General 
Departments have no federal or state certificates of public convenience and they file no tariffs."
835,2," Western Electric is the 12th largest individual corporation in the United States, with sales of over $ 7 billion. It owns fifty per 
cent of the stock of Bell Labs, and it has at least one wholly owned subsidiary. It is not regulated by any federal or state 
regulatory authority. See pp. 12-14, infra."
835,3," Bell Labs is owned in equal parts by AT&T and Western Electric. It conducts research and development, primarily for AT&T, 
Western Electric, and Bell Operating Companies. Like Western Electric, it is not regulated by any federal or state regulatory 
authority. See pp. 12-14, infra."
835,4," There are 23 Bell Operating Companies which, along with many other non-Bell companies, provide primarily intrastate, and 
some interstate service, pursuant to certificates of public convenience and necessity."
835,5," Telecommunications is defined as the electronic and electromagnetic transmission of voice, data, and other communications by 
wire, cable, microwave radio, and communications satellite. "
836,6," As early as 1973, prior to the institution of this action, the government had issued an extensive civil investigative demand, and 
the Bell System in fact produced documents pursuant to that demand. In addition, according to an attachment to plaintiff's 
response to defendants' first set of interrogatories, the Justice Department had a number of interviews and contacts with 
potential witnesses prior to the filing of the complaint."
836,7," For that reason, the Court did not become extensively involved with discovery at that time, and it issued only one order which 
dealt expressly with the discovery process. That order (Pretrial Order No. 1) in essence preserved the status quo with respect to 
the existence of documents, by requiring plaintiff to retain and secure from destruction all documents requested by defendants 
from over forty government agencies, and by compelling defendant to retain and secure from destruction all its files which might 
be relevant to this action."
836,8, Pretrial Order No. 4.
836,9," Pretrial Orders 5-8, inter alia, fixed certain dates for the filing of interrogatories; set up voluntary procedures governing the 
production of documents by the parties pursuant to Rule 34 and for Rule 45 discovery relating to non-parties; required discovery 
requests to be specific; established an explicit definition of ""protected"" documents and a comprehensive scheme for treatment of 
such documents, including the appointment of a special master to pass on claims of privilege; and provided that the voluntary 
Rule 34 discovery procedures were revocable by any party upon fifteen days' notice to the other party. In addition, on that date, 
the Court issued a ""Stipulation and Order Concerning Documents in the Possession, Custody, or Control of Agencies other than "
837,," the Department of Justice.' This document set up a procedure for the voluntary production of documents from those agencies to 
defendants."
837,10," Jurisdiction was claimed under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651, but, as noted supra, both courts ultimately declined to 
entertain defendants' petitions."
837,11," The U.S. Court of Appeals issued two stays of the proceedings. On January 25, 1977, it entered a stay on its own motion until 
the matters raised in defendants' petition could be adequately briefed and ruled upon, and on August 11, 1977, it entered a stay 
on defendants' motion for the period required to seek certiorari in the Supreme Court."
837,12, Plaintiff and defendants each submitted five proposed pretrial orders.
837,13," Discovery Order No. 1 ordered defendants to produce documents requested by the government on February 3, 1977, after the 
first Court of Appeals stay had been entered, and also ordered the Justice Department to commence production of documents 
from its own files. Discovery Order No. 2 established explicit procedures for discovery of documents generated in private 
antitrust suits in which AT&T was a defendant as well as in federal and state regulatory proceedings involving defendants, and it 
set up procedures for voluntary discovery by AT&T from government agencies other than the Justice Department. The order 
also provided for a comprehensive discovery schedule, including the setting of dates for preliminary orders of proof and for 
termination of discovery."
837,14," The Court also consolidated the issue concerning defendants' proposed Pretrial Order No. 13 with the appeal from the 
Magistrate's Discovery Order No. 2 for purposes of disposition."
837,15," However, on June 29, 1978, the Court, acting pursuant to Rule 53, F.R.Civ.P., and the still viable Pretrial Order No. 7 to which 
the parties had stipulated, appointed Professors Paul Rice of American University and Geoffrey Hazard of Yale University as 
Special Masters to deal with claims of privilege in the discovery process. The order of reference charged the Special Masters 
with making ""findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to the matters presented to them by the parties and report 
expeditiously to the court pursuant to Rule 53(e) . . .;"" permitted them to make all arrangements necessary to accomplish those 
duties; provided that the decisions of the Special Masters would be subject to review de novo by the Court upon timely 
application of the parties, and directed that any matter upon which the Special Masters could not agree would be submitted to 
the Court for resolution."
837,16," Because of the illness and death of Judge Joseph C. Waddy, to whom the case had originally been assigned, several motions 
were reargued to this Court. "
838,17," Principally the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. § 151, et seq."
838,18," E.g., insurance (McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1012); air transportation (Federal Aviation Act, 49 U.S.C. § 1384); 
export trade associations (Webb-Pomerene Act, 15 U.S.C. § 62); surface transportation (Reed-Bulwinkle Act of 1948, 49 U.S.C. 
§ 56(9))."
838,19, 47 U.S.C. §§ 221(a) and 222(c) (1) exempt certain FCC-approved consolidations and mergers of telephone companies.
838,20," The antitrust laws are a ""comprehensive charter of economic liberty"" (Northern Pac. R. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S.1, 4, 2 L. 
Ed. 2d 545, 78 S. Ct. 514 (1958)) whose goals have been described in many ways, from the advancement of consumer welfare 
(Bork, The Antitrust Paradox (1978), pp. 50-66) to the more radical objective of the diffusion of power in economic decision-
making (A. Neale, The Antitrust Laws of the USA (2d ed. 1970), pp. 427-432; and Mr. Justice Douglas' dissent in United States 
v. Columbia Steel Co., 334 U.S. 495, 536, 92 L. Ed. 1533, 68 S. Ct. 1107 (1948). See also, P. Areeda and D. Turner, Antitrust 
Law, vol. 1, par. 103, et seq. (1978)."
838,21," However, regulatory agencies sometimes seek to achieve their objectives, at least in part, through the fostering of competition. "
839,22," This may be so because the market is one of natural monopoly, in that it is incapable effectively to support more than one firm, 
or because of other economic, public policy, or political reasons."
839,23," The antitrust laws apply notwithstanding regulation in such industries as the production of natural gas ( California v. Federal 
Power Commission, 369 U.S. 482, 8 L. Ed. 2d 54, 82 S. Ct. 901 (1962)); generation and transmission of electric power ( Otter 
Tail Power Co. v. United States, supra); national banking ( United States v. Philadelphia National Bank, supra); securities and 
commodities exchanges ( Silver v. New York Stock Exchange, supra; Ricci v. Chicago Mercantile Exchange, 409 U.S. 289, 34 L. 
Ed. 2d 525, 93 S. Ct. 573 (1973)); and broadcasting ( United States v. Radio Corporation of America, 358 U.S. 334, 3 L. Ed. 2d 
354, 79 S. Ct. 457 (1959))."
839,24," If the law were otherwise, the specific statutory immunity granted, for example, to telephone companies with respect to certain 
FCC-approved mergers (see Note 19, supra), would be redundant and unnecessary. See Wilderness Society v. Morton, 156 
U.S. App. D.C. 121, 479 F.2d 842, 856 (1973), cert. denied, 411 U.S. 917, 36 L. Ed. 2d 309, 93 S. Ct. 1550 (1973); National 
Railroad Passenger Corp. v. National Association of Railroad Passengers, 414 U.S. 453, 38 L. Ed. 2d 646, 94 S. Ct. 690 (1974)."
839,25," Otter Tail involved a District Court decree which required an electric power utility company to remedy its antitrust violations-by 
establishing certain power interconnections. In response to the company's argument that by reason of the Federal Power Act it 
was not subject to the antitrust laws, the Supreme Court stated that, absent a direct conflict between the federal judicial decree 
and an order of the Federal Power Commission concerning specific interconnections, antitrust jurisdiction was not ousted. ""It will 
be time enough to consider whether the antitrust remedy may override the power of the [Federal Power] Commission under § 
202(b) as, if, and when the Commission denies the interconnection and the District Court nevertheless undertakes to direct it"" 
(410 U.S. at 377). "
840,26," The two categories are not clearly distinct, and they sometimes merge in their analysis and application. "
841,27," Hughes Tool Co. v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 409 U.S. 363, 34 L. Ed. 2d 577, 93 S. Ct. 647 (1972), and Pan American World 
Airways v. United States, supra, also relied on by defendants in this proceeding, involved similarly explicit regulatory schemes. 
In Hughes Tool, the Court found that the challenged transactions fell precisely within the detailed scheme for administrative 
treatment established by Congress in section 408 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, 49 U.S.C. § 1378, and that, inasmuch as 
the Civil Aeronautics Board had issued an order under that section approving them, the transactions were immunized from the 
antitrust laws by section 414 of the Act, 49 U.S.C. § 1384. Similarly, in Pan American Airways, the Court held that section 411 of 
the Federal Aviation Act of 1948, 49 U.S.C. § 1381, had granted to the CAB the very jurisdiction (over unfair competition in air 
traffic) that was at the heart of the antitrust complaint. "
842,28," A letter dated November 30, 1955, from Chairman George C. McConnaughey of the Federal Communications Commission to 
the Attorney General, introduced at the 1958 hearings, states that ""the operations of Western, including its prices and profits, 
are, of course, not subject to direct control by any regulatory authority."" Consent Decree Program of the Department of Justice, 
supra, vol. II at 2233-34."
842,29," Bernard Strassburg, Chief of the Telephone Division of the Federal Communications Commission, testified in those hearings 
that the Commission lacks the authority to directly regulate Western Electric. Consent Decree Program of the Department of 
Justice, supra, vol. III at 3446, 3543-44."
842,30," Chairman Newton N. Minow of the Federal Communications Commission testified before the Committee in 1962 that ""we have 
no statutory authority to regulate the prices charged by Western Electric for its equipment sales to the American Telephone & 
Telegraph Co."" Antitrust Problems of the Space Satellite Communications System, supra at 283."
842,31," E.g., relationships with private mobile radio systems, radio common carriers, miscellaneous common carriers, specialized 
common carriers, and manufacturers and sellers of terminal equipment for communications systems."
842,32," The distinction is significant inasmuch as Gordon, and its companion case United States v. National Association of Security 
Dealers, represent the outer limits of the Supreme Court's application of the implied immunity doctrine. Other Supreme Court law 
is even more hospitable to the antitrust laws and less apt to imply an immunity."
842,33," In addition to certain claimed violations with respect to manufacturing, research, and sales and purchases of the fruits of 
manufacturing and research, much of this suit involves defendants' alleged failure to allow various types of entities to 
interconnect. "
843,34," Section 406 provides that ""the district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction . . . [of allegations of] any violation, by 
a carrier subject to this chapter which prevent the relator from receiving service in interstate or foreign communication by wire or 
radio, or in interstate or foreign transmission of energy by radio, from said carrier at the same charges, or upon terms or 
conditions as favorable as those given by said carrier for like communication or transmission under similar conditions to any 
other persons."" See also, 47 U.S.C. §§ 207, 407, 414."
843,35," See, e.g., Business Week, Why the Justice Department Took AT&T to Court, (Nov. 30, 1974) pp. 68-70."
843,36," HN6[
] Even when the regulation is ""pervasive,"" and the precise conduct attacked in an antitrust suit is being regulated, an 
immunity will be found only if the antitrust remedy conflicts with rather than complements the enforcement efforts of the 
regulatory agency.  Mt. Hood Stages, Inc. v Greyhound Corp., 555 F.2d 687 (9th Cir. 1977), vacated and remanded on other 
grounds, 46 U.S.L.W. 4719 (June 19, 1978)."
843,37," An agency's consistent construction of its own enabling legislation is entitled to considerable weight. See Red Lion 
Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367, 23 L. Ed. 2d 371, 89 S. Ct. 1794 (1969)."
843,38," See note 45, infra. "
844,39," The Commission considers, however, that when it has prescribed or specifically approved a tariff, its judgment must control 
(FCC Memorandum of December 30, 1975, p. 20)."
844,40," While the district court decisions are not entirely consistent in this area, the better-reasoned cases likewise support these 
conclusions. In Jarvis v. Am. Tel. & Tel., Civ. 74-1674 (D.D.C. August 7, 1978), Judge Robinson of this Court held that 
Commission regulation of interconnection and tariffs over this defendant is not so pervasive that regulatory control should be 
deemed inconsistent with the application of the antitrust laws. See also, Industrial Comm. Sys. Inc. v. Pac. Tel. & Tel. Co., 505 
F.2d 152, 156 (9th Cir. 1974); Macom Products Corp. v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 359 F. Supp. 973, 976 (C.D. Cal. 1973). Despite 
defendants' contention that Jarvis is in error (Defendants' Reply to Supplemental Response for the United States), the decision 
is consistent with both the Supreme Court's and the Federal Communications Commission's views. See Cantor v. Detroit Edison 
Co., 428 U.S. 579, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1141, 96 S. Ct. 3110 (1976); Georgia v. Pennsylvania R. R. Co., 324 U.S. 439, 454-460, 89 L. 
Ed. 1051, 65 S. Ct. 716 (1945); Response of Federal Communications Commission in Am. Tel. & Tel. Co. v. United States, No. 
77-1009 (D.C. Cir.), p. 18. The decisions cited by defendants in this regard are inapposite.  Western Electric Co. v. Milgo 
Electronics Corp., 1978-1 Trade Cases, No. 61,960 (S.D. Fla. 1976), appeal dismissed, 568 F.2d 1203 (5th Cir. 1978), involved 
a question of standing, the court noting only that because of a recent administrative program instituted by the FCC, certain 
paragraphs of a counterclaim might not be properly before the court. In Citizens Utilities Co. v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 1978-1 Trade 
Cases, No. 61,959 (N.D. Cal. 1977), the court dismissed a sixteen-year old antitrust case for want of prosecution, stating by way 
of dictum that dismissal might also be warranted on exclusive or primary jurisdiction grounds because the FCC was the proper 
forum for the subject matter (division of revenues within the telephone industry). In Data Corp. v. General Telephone Co. of 
California, 1977-2 Trade Cases No. 61,610 (C.D. Cal. 1977), the court dismissed the complaint because of the peculiar subject 
matter, but expressly disavowed holding ""that the telephone companies may never be sued under the antitrust laws,"" citing 
Judge Waddy's opinion in the instant case.  Monitor Business Machines, Inc. v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 1978-1 Trade Cases, No. 
62,610 (C.D. Cal. 1978), and Phonetele Inc. v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 435 F. Supp. 207 (C.D. Cal. 1977), both involved relatively 
narrow interconnection areas which the courts found to have been extensively regulated by the Federal Communications 
Commission. In short, all of these cases are distinguishable on their facts. To the extent that some language in the opinions may 
differ from the conclusion reached here, like JudgeRobinson in Jarvis, I decline to follow them."
844,41," See pp. 1-2, supra. "
845,42," HN8[
] Immunity will be implied only if necessary to make the regulatory statutes work, ""and even then only to the minimum 
extent necessary."" Gordon v. New York Stock Exchange, supra, 422 U.S. at 685."
845,43," Additionally, it is not insignificant that, HN9[
] even with respect to that portion of defendants' activities which the Commission 
does regulate, only the courts can grant complete relief. The Commission has little authority to vindicate injury to competitors; 
there is no statutory provision authorizing it to order divestiture; and it is unable to adopt remedies designed to forclose future 
anticompetitive conduct. See generally, Am. Tel. & Tel. Co. v. FCC, 487 F.2d 865, 881 (2d Cir. 1973); Nader v. FCC, 172 U.S. 
App. D.C. 1, 520 F.2d 182, 206 (1975); cf.  Hewitt-Robins v. Freight-Ways, Inc., 371 U.S. 84, 9 L. Ed. 2d 142, 83 S. Ct. 157 
(1962); but see, General Telephone Co. of the Southwest v. United States, 449 F.2d 846 (5th Cir. 1971). Congress could hardly 
be deemed by implication to have conferred immunity on carriers such as these defendants when the effect of its assumed 
action would be to insulate the alleged antitrust violators from effective sanctions or relief."
845,44," See Mr. Justice Brennan's dissent in Pan American World Airways v. United States, supra, 371 U.S. at 331-2. "
846,45," While the term ""primary jurisdiction"" has been widely used, including by the U.S. Supreme Court, it deserves some 
clarification. A referral under that doctrine does not oust a court of jurisdiction; it merely serves as a means for requesting a 
regulatory agency to make preliminary factual and legal determinations while reserving to the court the authority to decide the 
ultimate questions. Judge Waddy's opinion of November 24, 1976, concluded that some of the issues herein might be referred to 
the FCC under that doctrine. It is clear from Ricci v. Chicago Mercantile Exchange, supra, that such a referral is appropriate 
particularly where there is a need to resolve possible conflicts between the objectives of the antitrust laws and the regulatory 
standards, and where an adjudication of such issues by the regulatory body will be of material aid in the ultimate decision of the 
antitrust issues. It is my intention, as it was Judge Waddy's, to make such appropriate references to the FCC. According to the 
Commission (Memorandum as amicus curiae, p. 29) issues which substantially affect the following matters should be referred to 
it under the principle of primary jurisdiction: (1) entry into or exit from a communications carrier market; (2) FCC orders requiring 
interconnection; and (3) tariff provisions which the Commission has approved or precluded. It would be premature at this point to 
conclude the extent to which these conditions exist with respect to particular issues in this case, or whether there may be other 
matters appropriate for referral to the Commission."
846,46," I.e., the issue of whether or not the Commission has exclusive jurisdiction."
846,47," Throughout their status memoranda, defendants assert-that there must be ""a prompt determination of the jurisdictional issue"" 
(Reply Memorandum, p. 3), that the means to expedite this case is to have ""an early and definitive resolution of the fundamental 
jurisdictional issue that overhangs all of the proceedings in this case"" (Reply Memorandum, p. 49), and that the Court will have 
to resolve ""once and for all whether--and, if so, the extent to which--it has jurisdiction"" (emphasis supplied) (Status 
Memorandum, p. 47))."
846,48," For that reason defendants' proposed Pretrial Order No. 9 which would limit discovery to the jurisdictional issues seriatim, 
followed in each instance by further briefing and court review, is denied. "
847,49," There were variations in the responses of the agencies. For example, the General Services Administration noted that it would 
cooperate ""provided AT&T is required to state with specificity its reasons for objecting to a GSA claim of privilege;"" the Office of 
Management and Budget and the Council of Economic Advisers are willing to submit claims of privilege to the Court or the 
Special Masters ""other than claims of executive privilege;"" the Department of State ""is unable to say at this time whether or not it 
may subsequently determine to submit certain claims of privilege only to the Court;"" the Central Intelligence Agency said that 
privilege claims might in some cases have to be supplemented by ex parte, in camera proceedings; the Department of the Navy 
cautioned that ""the anticipated extreme sensitivity of certain documents which are requested may require formal proceedings on 
privilege assertions prior to production;"" the National Security Agency ""will submit claims of privilege [only] to the court for 
resolution;"" the Securities and Exchange Commission answered that ""this statement does not constitute a waiver of any 
objections or other procedures that may be available to the SEC;"" and the Department of the Treasury and the National Science 
Foundation likewise ""will submit claims of privilege [only] to the court for resolution."" The Federal Communications Commission 
did not submit a response in any form, consistently with its position that it will respond only to discovery subpoenas issued 
pursuant to Rule 45. See discussion, at pp. 30-34 infra. The United States Postal Service, which has taken a similar position, did 
file a response reiterating its view that absent a Rule 45 subpoena it is not legally required to respond to defendants' discovery 
demands, but that it would be willing to participate in discussions with defendants concerning production of necessary Postal 
Service documents."
847,50," See Rule 45(f). Possible sanctions for non-compliance with Rule 34 are far more flexible, e.g., striking of pleadings, deeming 
certain matters to be established, precluding the use of particular items of evidence. Rule 37(b) (2), F.R.Civ.P. "
848,51," Prof. Moore has noted (4 Moore's Federal Practice, para. 26.61 [5.-1] pp. 26-287-89, "". . . where the government is not a party 
. . . the determination of the head of the department or agency that disclosure should not be allowed for all practical purposes 
has been final and unreviewable."""
848,52," That this is a reality is borne out by the fact that the Postal Service has already indicated its intention not to produce the 
requested documents unless it is reimbursed by defendants."
848,53," Counsel for the government has suggested that this question be deferred until such time as logistical and other problems 
become so unmanageable that the ""voluntary"" system must be abandoned. The Court sees no purpose in temporarily avoiding a 
decision that eventually will have to be made in any case. A postponement of the decision would only prolong and exacerbate 
discovery disputes. "
849,54," Section 2 of the Sherman Act establishes a criminal offense, but the section 4 enforcement provision here employed is civil in 
nature. Thus, this is a civil action."
849,55," The government acknowledges, indeed asserts, that ""the role and responsibility of the antitrust prosecutor is analogous to that 
of the criminal prosecutor"" (Status Memorandum, p. 31)."
849,56," The government here opposes party production by other government departments, but in United States v. IBM, 69 Civ. 200 
(S.D.N.Y.), an antitrust suit of comparable dimensions, it did not do so."
849,57," It is unnecessary here to explore such complicating factors as the role of the Congress in these various areas. At a minimum, 
these responsibilities are being carried out on behalf of the Executive Branch. "
850,58," Counsel for the government have complained that a ruling equating all executive departments with the United States will 
complicate their task because they claim to have little influence over other agencies of the government. Obviously, defendants 
have even less influence over the agencies, and as the entities which have been sued, they-are entitled to their discovery rights 
irrespective of the effect on inter-departmental relationships."
850,59," This suit was brought not against but by the United States. Compare United States v. Reynolds, 345 U.S. 1, 12, 97 L. Ed. 727, 
73 S. Ct. 528 (1953), where, in holding that a claim of privilege was not deemed waived in a Federal Tort Claims Act suit, the 
Court noted that the rationale of the criminal cases has ""no application in a civil forum where the government is not the moving 
party but is a defendant only on terms to which it has consented."""
850,60," If, however, basic constitutional rights are involved, even the legislative and judicial branches may not be immune from 
process. See, e.g., Christoffel v. United States, supra, 200 F.2d at 739. "
851,61," Regulatory agencies not infrequently take positions at odds with those of the Executive Branch. See, e.g., Gordon v. New York 
Stock Exchange, supra; United States v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 221 F. Supp. 584 (D.D.C. 1963)."
851,62," In view of the quasi-legislative status of the Federal Communications Commission, a requirement that it produce documents 
as a party to an Executive Branch suit might well raise serious constitutional, separation-of-power problems."
851,63," Harvey Aluminum v. NLRB, supra, is not to the contrary. The court there was essentially concerned with Jencks Act 
statements in the possession of executive departments. The President was held to have adequate authority over such 
departments to procure production, and the courts to order it. The President lacks that capacity with respect to regulatory 
agencies and, while the courts' general power in that regard is not doubted, it is limited by considerations of legality and the 
appropriateness of its exercise under either Rule 34 or Rule 45, F.R.Civ. P."
851,64," Cases cited by defendants to the contrary are inapposite.  United States v. Reynolds, supra, concerned Air Force records in a 
case in which the Justice Department was acting as attorney for the Air Force in defense of a tort claim. The Court recognized, 
inter alia, that the custody and control of the documents rested with the Air Force, and it did not require the Department of 
Justice to produce them.  United States v. Procter & Gamble, 356 U.S. 677, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1077, 78 S. Ct. 983 (1958), involved 
grand jury transcripts under the control of the Justice Department itself.  Freeman v. Seligson, supra, involved a subpoena 
directed to the Department of Agriculture which sought certain documents that had been furnished to the agency from individual 
commodity brokers. Neither these decisions nor the principles underlying them provide the slightest support for the proposition "
852,," that an independent regulatory commission such as the FCC--as distinguished from an Executive Branch agency--is to be 
considered a party plaintiff in an antitrust suit. See United States v. National Broadcasting Company, 65 F.R.D. 415, 419 (C.D. 
Cal. 1974), appeal dismissed, 421 U.S. 940, 44 L. Ed. 2d 97, 95 S. Ct. 1668 (1975)."
852,65," These considerations apply equally to the other independent regulatory bodies, from which defendants have sought discovery, 
such as the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Power Commission. With respect to the status of the United States 
Postal Service, the parties have provided little assistance to the Court. However, it appears from an examination of present law 
that the Postal Service, as an ""independent establishment"" of the Executive Branch, should not be regarded as a party plaintiff 
for purposes of this suit. The Service is directed by a board of governors whose members serve staggered nine-year terms and 
may be removed only for cause (39 U.S.C. § 202)); it has an independent financial structure; it has the statutory power ""to sue 
and be sued in its official name"" (39 U.S.C. § 401(1)); it controls its own records (39 U.S.C. § 401(4)); and it has been 
deliberately insulated from three types of political controls: (1) there is a ban on political appointments; (2) the Service is exempt 
from consideration of non-postal federal economic policies; and (3) the legislative history of the statute establishing the Service 
shows that, for reasons of efficiency and economy, it was intended to be insulated from legislative or executive control or 
interference. See 39 U.S.C. §§ 1002, 410(a); H.R. Rep. No. 91-1104, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 5 (1970), 116 Cong. Rec. 21, 709 
(1970)."

produced or generated in three regulatory proceedings."
853,68," There is some dispute between the parties as to whether this constitutes a change in position by the government. For 
purposes of this appeal, it is irrelevant who is right on that issue."
853,69," Although counsel for defendants has stated that the government's attempt to obtain documents in this manner is 
unprecedented, in fact the same procedure was utilized by the government, albeit without objection, in the IBM litigation. See 
United States v. International Business Machines Corp., 471 F.2d 507 (2d Cir. 1972); International Business Machines Corp. v. 
United States, 480 F.2d 293 (2d Cir. 1973)."
853,70," Defendants also cite Data Digests, Inc. v. Standard & Poor's Corporation, 57 F.R.D. 42 (S.D.N.Y. 1972); In Re Coordinated 
Pretrial Proceedings in Western Liquid Asphalt Cases, 18 F.R. Serv.2d 1251 (N.D. Cal. 1974); Aluminum Corporation of America 
v. United States Department of Justice, 1978-1 Trade Cas. (CCH) 61,824 (D.D.C. 1978); and Martindell v. International Tel. & 
Tel. Corp., 72 Civ. 2609 (S.D.N.Y., March 23, 1978); Wyly Corporation v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., Civil Action No. 76-1544 (D.D.C. 
1978); and the two decisions in Zenith Radio Corp. v. Matsushita Electric Co., Ltd., 1978-1 Trade Cas. (CCH) 61,961 and 62,019 
(E.D. Pa. 1978). In none of these cases, however, did the government seek the discovery materials as a party to and for use in 
ongoing litigation. See notes 72, 73, infra, and accompanying text."
853,71," While Judge Frankel noted that, as a general proposition, the court should not sanction or encourage the use of private 
discovery to reinforce a government investigation preliminary to a civil or criminal prosecution, he was more concerned with ""the 
use of private discovery as a possible supplement to federal grand jury proceedings."" 415 F. Supp. at 133."
853,72," The court was understandably concerned that, by allowing the Antitrust Division, a stranger to the litigation, to enlist the 
assistance of the private plaintiff, it would be adding a new and totally different method of investigation to the arsenal of devices 
granted to the Department of Justice by the Congress. Were the documents sought by way of a civil investigative demand (15 
U.S.C. § 1312) or a grand jury subpoena, for example, there would be attendant safeguards on their production and use. By "
854,," obtaining them through the good graces of plaintiff GAF, however, the government would have secured them free of the 
limitations that Congress saw fit to impose, and in a manner that Congress never intended."
854,73," The demand here is made in the context of an ongoing civil suit which has been proceeding in this Court for some four years. 
Whatever may be the propriety of turning litigation records over to the government to assist it with its investigations, there can be 
no legitimate objection to the use of such records in another, similar action in another district, particularly where, as here, the 
plaintiff is claiming violations of the antitrust laws by defendants similar to those that are claimed by the private plaintiffs in the 
other lawsuits. See notes 79, 80, infra."
854,74," Defendants' counsel has stated (Transcript of hearing of May 12, 1978, pp. 7-8): ""We will take the microfilm, which is the 
selected copies of the documents that all the parties select, we will add to that all the paper we produced, that is, to those private 
parties, to the extent we can identify it--and by and large, 99 per cent of it, or so, we can identify; we know which files we 
produced--we will then produce to the government the underlying information, the document to the extent it is relevant in this 
case from all of this material."""
854,75," It is estimated that defendants produced 7 million pages of documents in the MCI suit from which plaintiff selected 1.5 million 
for copying; and 5 million pages in the Litton suit, from which plaintiff selected 1 million for copying."
854,76," It is, however, unclear whether the document selection process would constitute ""work product"" at all within the meaning of 
Rule 26(b)(3), F.R.Civ.P. "
855,77," F.R.Civ.P. 1 provides that ""these rules . . . shall be construed to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of 
every action."""
855,78," HN19[
] Rule 26(b)(1), F.R.Civ.P., provides that ""parties may obtain discovery of any matter, not privileged, which is 
relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action."""
855,79," The complaints here and in Litton are both directed to the activities of AT&T, Western Electric, Bell Labs, and the Bell 
Telephone Operating Companies that are named as co-conspirators. Both actions are based on a conspiracy by defendants to 
restrain trade and commerce in the telecommunications equipment market: the Litton plaintiffs claim defendants conspired to 
""restrain trade and commerce in the manufacture, distribution, sale, rental, and lease of telephone terminal equipment;"" the 
government claims defendants conspired to illegally monopolize the ""terminal equipment, switching equipment, and transmission 
equipment"" market. In both cases the critical components of the alleged conspiracy are the prohibition of interconnection with the 
Bell System, or its permission only with the restriction of a so-called ""interface device"" manufactured by Western Electric, and 
supplied only by Bell companies; an illegal agreement that Western Electric shall manufacture all the telecommunications 
equipment requirements of the Bell System, thereby restricting and eliminating competition from other manufacturers and 
suppliers of telecommunications equipment. See also note 80 infra."
855,80," The complaint in MCI alleges that AT&T, along with the same twenty-four Bell Telephone Operating Companies involved here 
(and one additional company, Bell Telephone of Nevada) conspired to prevent plaintiffs, who are specialized communications 
common carriers, from interconnecting in the intercity telecommunications services market; that they provided for 
interconnection in that market only upon discriminatory terms and conditions; and that they refused to allow plaintiffs to utilize 
AT&T's most efficient equipment and facilities. Similarly, the complaint here alleges that defendants and their co-conspirators 
conspired to monopolize the market of ""intercity private line service for the transmission of voice, data, facsimile, audio and video 
programming, and other telecommunications,"" by inter alia attempting to obstruct and obstructing the interconnection of 
specialized common carriers with the Bell System; and that they used their monopolistic position to deter ""would be competitors"" 
in that market ""by refusing to deal with them . . . or did so only on highly discriminatory terms and conditions."" Both plaintiffs 
allege that in furtherance of the conspiracies, defendants abused the administrative process by filing ""sham tariffs;"" engaged in 
predatory and exclusionary pricing tactics and ""tracking"" of competitors (offering to provide services in the same areas as private 
systems but at substantially lesser rates); and refused to provide access for private systems to utilize Bell System facilities. Thus "
856,," the parties, the critical components, and the activities that each plaintiff purports to rely on to demonstrate the conspiracy are 
essentially the same in both cases."
856,81," As Judge Irving Kaufman has pointed out ( Kaufman, Judicial Control Over Discovery, 28 F.R.D. 111, 119 (1961)); ""The clear 
policy of the rules is toward full disclosure. At the early stages of litigation, it is rare that a showing can be made that a particular 
item of requested information is not 'relevant' under the broad definition given that word in Rule 26. In the ordinary case, the 
judge will order the question to be answered, subject to a later finding of irrelevancy. . . ."" See also, Metal Foil Prod. Mfg. Co. v. 
Reynolds Metals Co., 55 F.R.D. 491, 493-4 (E.D. Va. 1970); E.I. dupont de Nemours v. Deering Milliken Research Corp., 72

60 F.R.D. 562 (W.D. Pa. 1973); Parion Theatre Corp. v. RKO Theatres, Inc., 319 F. Supp. 378 (S.D.N.Y. 1970); G. & P. 
Amusement Co. v. Regent Theater Co., 9 F.R.D. 721 (N.D. Ohio 1949)."
856,84," It is also noteworthy that the documents in question were produced to the plaintiffs in the private lawsuits in bulk, without any 
concern for relevancy or privilege, and with provision for determination of these matters only subsequent to production. 
Defendants have suggested that such a free and open attitude was appropriate to the parties in the private cases because (1) 
those parties, unlike the government, could be trusted not to ""leak"" material to unauthorized persons, and (2) strong protective 
orders were issued in those cases. This Court has issued a protective order (Pretrial Order No. 7) which guarantees defendants' 
rights at least as securely as did the protective orders in MCI and Litton; and, the Court is prepared to impose such additional 
safeguards as may, from time to time, appear reasonably necessary to protect defendants' interests in this regard. The Court 
cannot accept the proposition that government counsel will be more likely than others to violate those protective orders and to 
reveal materials the disclosure of which is prohibited. Further, defendants' contention that the Publicity in the Taking of Evidence 
Act, 15 U.S.C. § 30, will somehow hamper the Court's ability to provide protection for privileged documents is unfounded. See 
United States v. United States Fruit Company, 410 F.2d 553, 555-56 (5th Cir. 1969). The Act provides only that depositions "
857,," taken pursuant to a Sherman Act claim brought by the United States are to be conducted in public, and has no bearing on the 
government's right to obtain documents. If and when the government properly raises the issue of production of deposition 
transcripts from the two private cases (see note 91, infra), the Court will hear from the parties as to the possible effects of the Act 
in that context."
857,85," See Huff v. N.D. Cass Co. of Alabama, 468 F.2d 172 (5th Cir. 1972); Bell v. Swift & Co., 283 F.2d 407 (5th Cir. 1960) (trial 
judge's rulings on discovery matters will not be disturbed in the absence of ""substantial prejudice."") See generally, Rodgers v. 
United States Steel Corp., 536 F.2d 1001, 1006 (3rd Cir. 1976); Galella v. Onassis, 487 F.2d 986 (2d Cir. 1973)."
857,86," Defendants' contention that requiring them to turn over these documents to plaintiff places them at a discovery disadvantage is 
without merit. AT&T is also the defendant in the Litton and MCI cases, and as such, has had the same opportunities for 
discovery as did the private plaintiffs in those suits. To be sure, some of AT&T's discovery in the private suits may not prove 
useful to it in this case but, of course, some of MCI's and Litton's discovery may not be of use to the government either. "
858,87," Since defendants have claimed that segregating some privileged material from non-privileged material will be impractical or 
impossible due to the fact that the government has requested the material be produced in the form of microfilm, they may 
produce documents in their original form where they determine that to be necessary. However, such determinations are to be 
made in good faith, and production of documents in their original form is to be the exception andnot the rule. The Court notes in 
that regard that in the IBM litigation, under almost identical circumstances, the defendant was able to remove documents which it 
was claimed were privileged from the reels of microfilm delivered to the government. See Note, ""Ancillary Pretrial Orders,"" 73 
Colum. L. Rev. 1660, 1661 (1973)."
858,88," Those documents which were ruled to be privileged in MCI and Litton, either by Special Masters in those cases or otherwise, 
will be segregated and deemed provisionally privileged here until such time as the Special Masters in this case rule on their 
status in accordance with standards of privilege established in this case."
858,89," Since defendants have repeatedly indicated to the Court that all confidential and privileged documents produced by them in 
Litton and MCI were specially marked with a confidential legend, segregation of most--if not all--of the documents requested 
here should be possible by the date indicated. Moreover, defendants have the benefit of the rulings of Special Masters in those 
cases to assist them in determining which documents should be claimed as privileged here."
858,90," While technically such leave may not be required inasmuch as defendants are merely being ordered to produce documents 
relevant to this lawsuit which are in their possession and control, as a matter of comity and courtesy the procedure described 
herein should be followed."
858,91," Although the government has not completely abandoned its request for documents from the remaining five private actions and 
the three regulatory proceedings to which AT&T is a party, it has concentrated its efforts on those produced in Litton and MCI. 
The parties have essentially briefed and argued the issue only with respect to these two proceedings, and the Court has not 
been made aware of either the protective order situations or substantive issues involved in the other proceedings. Accordingly, 
the present orders are limited to the two civil actions which have generated the bulk of this kind of discovery sought by plaintiff. 
Should the government desire to press its request for documents produced in other private lawsuits or regulatory proceedings, it 
may do so by special application showing the precise circumstances which establish the appropriateness and necessity of 
ordering their production. Insofar as copies of the depositions taken in any of the private lawsuits (including Litton and MCI) and 
the documents attached to the depositions, are concerned, considerations other than those which pertain to the documents may 
well be present yet the government has made no effort to provide the Court with either a legal or factual basis on which to order 
their production. With respect to the depositions, therefore, the government's request is likewise denied without prejudice to a 
subsequent submission of an appropriately-supported application. "
859,92," Status Memorandum, p. 43, footnote."
859,93," To date, the government has done nothing more than to file a Preliminary Designation of Issues, on June 9, 1978, which 
provided, in the government's own words, ""a brief, preliminary and somewhat tentative overview of the 'issues' before the court."""
859,94," See, e.g., Moore's, supra, Manual for Complex Litigation, para. 1.20; J. Withrow and R. Larm, The ""Big"" Antitrust Case: 25 
Years of Sisyphean Labor, 62 Cornell L. Rev. 1, 42-3 (1976); Comment, Federal Civil Procedure--Federal Rule 16--Definition of

859,95," Defendants have repeatedly requested greater specification of the charges against them, and while their requests have 
generally been made in the context of the jurisdictional issue, now disposed of in Part I, supra, the principle of such a 
specification is sound."
859,96," The government has stated that to sharpen the issues, it will be prepared to submit what it refers to as a preliminary order of 
proof (although it is not quite clear what it means to include in that order of proof), and the Magistrate included a requirement for 
the submission of such a document in his Discovery Order No. 2."
859,97," This order may be regarded as only the first of several directions from the Court concerning pretrial procedures. It is expected 
that, as discovery proceeds, additional orders will be entered, upon the Court's own motion or at the suggestion of the parties, to 
further simplify and streamline this case. "
860,98," The order is based on the Court's authority under Rules 16 and 26, F.R.Civ.P. At the same time, the Court recognizes that in a 
lawsuit of this magnitude, pretrial mechanisms must not merely follow the literal language of the Rules but should also take 
account of the logistics of dealing with proof of potentially enormous proportions. See also, Rosden v. Leuthold, 107 U.S. App. 
D.C. 89, 274 F.2d 747 (1960); Buffington v. Wood, 351 F.2d 292 (3rd Cir. 1965); Davis v. Duplantis, 448 F.2d 918 (5th Cir.

860,99," Except for massive documentary evidence supporting particular contentions which may be referred to generally, all evidence 
is to be described in specific terms."
860,100, This will be first of four special pretrial conferences to be held in addition to routine pretrial conferences and meetings.
860,101," The Magistrate will be expected to keep the Court advised concerning the pretrial conferences and the progress of discovery 
which he will direct and monitor. See generally, Note, Masters and Magistrates in the Federal Courts, 88 Harv. L. Rev. 779, 802, 
n. 147 (1975)."

Ridge, The Organization of the Big Case, 21 F.R.D. 406 (1957); Manual for Complex Litigation (Moore's Fed. Practice, 1977), 
para. 0.40."
860,104," At the present stage of the proceedings, defendants may be expected to require some time to respond to the government's 
contentions. As discovery proceeds and theissues become more clearly defined, defendants will appropriately be able to submit 
their statements more or less contemporaneously with those filed by plaintiff. "
861,105," This schedule does not preclude the entry of orders for filing additional Statements of Contentions and Proof, or any other 
mechanisms for further narrowing the issues and limiting discovery. The Court will employ the sanctions available under Rule 
37, F.R.Civ.P., and 28 U.S.C. § 1927, to insure prompt compliance with the pretrial procedures specified herein and in the 
accompanying orders. See generally Edelstein, The Ethics of Dilatory Motion Practice: Time For Change, 44 Fordham L. Rev.

expects no broadening of the issues whatever after the first ""order of proof"" is filed."

the first statement."

862,110," See also, United States v. Standard Oil Company (New Jersey), 23 F.R.D. 1 (S.D.N.Y. 1958). In that complex antitrust case, 
the court ruled that discovery should proceed to the extent necessary to provide sufficient information for a narrowing of the 
issues, noting that ""after such preliminary narrowing, the balance of discovery can be measured against the frame of reference 
of the issues, as so narrowed, rather than against the broad frame of reference of the complaint which is the only one presently 
available. After the narrowing of the issues, much of the production presently sought might be determined not to be necessary.""

863,112," A dispute has arisen between the parties concerning the appropriate division of expenses with respect to the work of the 
Masters and their staffs, with the government taking the position that it should not be responsible for costs to the same extent as 
defendants. The Court has entered an order (Pretrial Order No. 9) requiring the parties to bear costs equally pending a further 
order at some future date when, because of a disposition on the merits, an allocation of workload, or otherwise, a different 
distribution of costs is appropriate."

profits as discussed above. Following Corwin I, the Bureau amended paragraph Second to state that if the member exercised its withdrawal right it waived 
only that portion of the annual participation credit referable to the advertising withdrawn."
880,5," Section 16720 provides in relevant part: ""A trust is a combination of capital, skill or acts by two or more persons for any of the 
following purposes: [para. ] (a) To create or carry out restrictions in trade or commerce."" Section 16726 provides: ""Except as 
provided in this chapter, every trust is unlawful, against public policy and void."""
880,6," Statewide also argued at trial that paragraph Second itself was a tying arrangement constituting a per se violation of sections 
16720 and 16726.  The trial judge found, however, that no tying arrangement existed.  Statewide does not challenge this finding 
on appeal. "
881,7," We also determined that Statewide had presented a triable issue of fact as to whether paragraph Second constituted an illegal 
tying arrangement (4 Cal.3d at pp. 856-857). Statewide, however, does not challenge the trial judge's determination that no tying 
arrangement existed. "
882,8," In 1972 this provision was eliminated from the representation agreement.  (See fn. 4, ante.)"
882,9," The trial court found that ""[throughout] the long history of the Bureau many members have excluded various kinds and classes 
of advertising from the agreement.  The means of exclusion have varied -- some formal, others informal.  The evidence is clear 
and convincing that no penalty of any kind whatsoever has been assessed by the Bureau or any of its members to any member 
for excluding any class or classes of advertising from the agreement and that the annual participation credit has been paid to 
each and every member of the Bureau regardless of whether that member had withdrawn or excluded any class or classes of 
advertising from the agreement."""
882,10," Moreover, as the trial court found, ""STATEWIDE never made any effort to represent any newspaper published by the 
defendants in this case from 1966 to the present in the business of soliciting and servicing public notice advertising. 
STATEWIDE was not forced to offer representation for all public notice advertising. The withdrawal clause in the Representation 
Agreement permitted STATEWIDE to offer representation with regard to individual classes of such advertising."""
882,11," Statewide also challenges the trial court's finding that the ""[relevant] geographic market is limited to the State of California"" and 
that the ""relevant product is the services of a newspaper representative in the field of public notice advertising."" Statewide 
argues that the relevant geographic market must be limited to the County of Los Angeles and that the relevant line of commerce 
must be limited to notices of trustee's sales.  In Corwin I we explained that the definition of the relevant market or line of 
commerce presents a question of law and fact.  (4 Cal.3d at p. 855.) Statewide does not explain how the trial court's definition 
fails as a matter of law.  Moreover, the trial court's finding is supported by substantial evidence on the record.  Although the 
Bureau's membership is limited to the County of Los Angeles, over 40 percent of Statewide's files involved property located 
outside Los Angeles.  As to ""relevant product,"" the evidence shows that Statewide neither attempted to represent newspapers 
for trustee sale notices or public notice advertising generally nor performed any substantial services for the newspapers. "
883,12," Statewide relies in particular on our footnote 3, which states, ""In its supplemental brief filed in this court, the Bureau, for the 
first time herein, contends that while the literal language of the contract appears to dictate the total waiver of any right to profits 
as stated above, the actual practice has been to allow member newspapers which have excluded certain classes of legal 
advertising from their contract to participate in the distribution of net profits to the extent of the commissions they paid to the 
Bureau on nonexcluded classes.  Since no such facts appear in the record, we cannot now consider this contention.  However, 
to the extent that such facts are relevant, they may be proved at trial."" (Italics added.) (4 Cal.3d at p. 849, fn. 3.)"
883,13," The evidence presented at trial demonstrated that members could exclude classes of advertising from the agreement at any 
time by letter or telephone call or even by a refusal to pay for a class of advertising. The 14 member-newspaper representatives 
who testified at the trial stated that they knew about the withdrawal privilege.  Their testimony indicated that nearly all member 
newspapers excluded at least one class of advertising from the agreement. "
884,14," Since sections 16720 and 16726 of the Cartwright Act were patterned after the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.), decisions 
under the latter act apply to the former.  ( Corwin I, 4 Cal.3d at p. 852.)"
884,15," Examples of per se violations include price fixing agreements ( U. S. v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co. (1940) 310 U.S. 150 [84 L.Ed. 
1129, 60 S.Ct. 811]) and tying arrangements ( Northern Pac. R. Co. v. United States (1958) 356 U.S. 1 [2 L.Ed.2d 545, 78 S.Ct. 
514]). Statewide makes no claim of a per se violation in this appeal."
884,16," In sum, the trial court found that the Bureau was originally organized in response to the monopolization of the public notice 
advertising business by a corporation which excluded community newspapers from the advertising. The underlying principle of 
the Bureau since its creation, the trial court found, has been to help community newspapers compete for public notice 
advertising. This policy, the trial court found, results in the publication of notices in the newspaper most likely to be effective.  
The trial court concluded that the Bureau substantially benefits both the public and the newspaper industry. Moreover, the trial court found no evidence of any artificial barrier or restraint to competition.  Representatives of member 
newspapers who testified at the trial stated that their agreement with the Bureau did not restrain them from dealing with 
Statewide or any other independent organization.  Representatives of newspapers who did not pay Statewide a commission 
testified without exception that they paid no commission because Statewide did not provide them with any valuable services, and 
not because of any arrangement with the Bureau. "
885,17," Indeed testimony at trial suggested that a newspaper could withdraw ""all advertising placed by Statewide"" from the 
representation agreement."
885,18," Particularly damaging to Statewide's case are the undisputed findings that, although Statewide knew of the withdrawal 
provision of the representation agreement, it never proposed to any Bureau newspaper to serve as the newspaper's 
representative for servicing trustee notices, and that Statewide did not perform any services for the newspapers."
885,19," Because we affirm the judgment for defendants, it is unnecessary to consider the claim of defendant Copley Press, Inc., that it 
was entitled to a dismissal because of plaintiffs' failure to serve notice to them within three years after the commencement of this 
action. "
895,1, The complaint is silent as to the period since April 1975.
895,2," For purposes of the motion to dismiss, the relevant market is considered to be electric carts. At a later stage in the 
proceedings, it may be necessary to consider the interchangeability of gas and electric golf carts to determine the relevant 
market. "
896,3," The complaint is silent as to the distribution scheme throughout the rest of the country except for its reference to an unnamed 
California Melex dealer and to Melex's residual right to sell in territories without dealers."

the Antidumping Act, jurisdiction attaches by reason of its pendent nature. "

within the forum is an issue of fact resolvable only by oral testimony as to that defendant.  Id. at 113 n.3."
898,11," 28 U.S.C. § 1404 also provides a change of venue when the convenience of parties and witnesses and the interest of justice

902,26, 15 U.S.C. § 7.
902,27," In this regard it is interesting to note that since the famous Tate letter in 1952, the Department of State had urged 
abandonment of absolute immunity for foreign sovereigns because, among other reasons, trading companies in state-controlled 
economies received preferential treatment in American courts. See Alfred Dunhill of London, Inc. v. Cuba, 425 U.S. 682, App. at 
714, 96 S. Ct. 1854, 48 L. Ed. 2d 301 (1975). Now that Congress has effectively abandoned absolute immunity through passage 
of the FSIA, defendant would have this Court revitalize it. "
903,28," At the time of Dunhill, the FSIA had not been passed. Nonetheless, four Justices concluded that when a foreign sovereign 
engages in purely commercial activity, it cannot be heard to invoke the act-of-state doctrine. Another Justice found it 
unnecessary to address the issue. Justice Marshall writing for the dissenters noted that the restrictive theory of immunity later 
embodied in the FSIA was not the law. Assuming that it were, he detailed differences between the principles of sovereign 
immunity and act-of-state. Now that Congress has acted, one would have to consider the judicially created doctrine of act-of-
state in light of the congressional enactment of the FSIA."
903,29," To bolster its act-of-state argument, defendant cites Interamerican Refining Corp. v. Texaco Maracaibo, Inc., 307 F. Supp. 
1291 (D.Del.1970), a case where a foreign corporation successfully invoked the doctrine of Sovereign compulsion. The instant 
complaint alleges that an American corporation approached Pezetel's predecessor and invited it to participate in the American 
golf-cart market which it did apparently with the support of the Polish government. These activities were allegedly continued by 
defendant. There is no assertion here of compulsion by anyone. If there were, evaluation of the defense whose purpose it is to 
avoid international tension would take place in light of the particular factual setting and, therefore, would necessarily survive a 
motion to dismiss. "

907,35," Moreover, as to servicing, plaintiff faces the same practical difficulty discussed above. Intrabrand competition would ultimately 
weed Melex dealers out and prices and quality would again rise. Thus, OMC meets the same standing dilemma it met with 
respect to pricing: the task of explaining how this consolidation of Melex dealers would either benefit or injure it."
907,36," The complaint is replete with charges that Pezetel, with the support of the Polish government, has provided extraordinary 
relief to Melex dealers, sometimes for motives wholly unrelated to economic success in the golf-cart industry. For example, at P 
24 of the complaint, OMC relates that when the Melex distributors complained to Pezetel of dumping duties imposed by the 
Treasury Department, Pezetel agreed, in effect, to become an importer, in order to remove from the distributors the financial 
onus of the duties. (Defendants disputed the veracity of this allegation at oral argument, but on a motion to dismiss, the Court 
accepts it as entirely accurate.) Similarly, the very nub of the complaint is that Pezetel, and Poland, will take any steps to protect 
the integrity of Melex carts in the American marketplace: ""Defendants were and are able successfully to carry out this systematic program of predatory pricing because the Polish 
economy is centrally planned, controlled and administered by the Government. In its drive to capture the United States golf car 
market, Pezetel can easily sustain losses incurred by selling its golf cars at less than fair value and for the purpose of obtaining 
hard, dollar earnings which are of far greater than face value to state-controlled economies."" Complaint P 26. "

only through unlawful anticompetitive conduct. "

919,5," Kennecott contends that certain matters related to taxes, savings, debt increases, and the copper markets should have been 
included in Curtiss-Wright's proxy materials. However, the district court did not so hold. Moreover, it made no factual findings 
upon which such a holding could be based. It rejected Curtiss-Wright's proxy material on the one ground that we now hold to be 
erroneous. "
920,6," The district judge did not limit his adverse comments to Curtiss-Wright's proxy statements. He stated, for example, that the 
feasibility of Curtiss-Wright's plan, viewed in its most favorable light, was highly doubtful."
920,7," The district court should determine, with the aid of counsel, whether the 1978 annual meeting must be voided in its entirety in 
order to effectuate the purposes of this decree. It appears that all of Kennecott's successful candidates for election to the board 
were holdover board members. They may, of course, continue to act in this capacity until a new board is elected. "
921,8, Kennecott arrived at the figure of $ 14.17 by dividing $ 235 million by a figure representing 50% Of its outstanding shares.
921,9, Curtiss-Wright's total sales for 1977 were approximately $ 310 million; Kennecott's were approximately.$ 1.2 billion. 
922,10," Kennecott's witness ""estimated"" that National's share was approximately 10% And Carborundum's 15%. The witness 
admitted, however, that he had no specific knowledge of the sales of any company other than his own or of the total sales of 
filter bags in the United States. Based on the records of his own company, he estimated that 10% Of the flange to flange sales 
value of a fabric filter is in the filter bag. Although admitting that he had no specific knowledge of competitive cost structures, he 
then extrapolated these percentages into industry-wide sales of filter equipment to arrive at his estimates of original equipment 
filter bag sales. In so doing, he simply adopted an estimate of the Industrial Gas Cleaning Institute that the sales volume of non- "
923,," members was 20% Of the total for the industry. He then estimated a three-year life cycle for each bag to arrive at a figure for 
replacement sales. In making these calculations, the witness did not explain how he adjusted for the fact that a baghouse, the structure into which 
impure gas is piped for filtration, may contain anywhere from 200 to 3,000 bags. Neither did he elucidate how he accounted for 
the difference in cost of the fabrics from which the bags were made. Finally, he offered no figures to show how he arrived at a 
life cycle of three years, which he apparently applied to all fabrics, regardless of durability. According to the transcript, the witness described the foregoing as the ""mythology"" used by Carborundum in calculating the 
marketplace. This was probably an error in transposition in that the word actually used was ""methodology."" However, the former 
term seems to be more descriptive. In any event, these calculations were a completely inadequate foundation upon which to 
base a judgment nullifying a $ 77 million investment."

per se standard of illegality on vertically imposed territorial divisions.  That decision cautions us against imposing strict standards 
of antitrust liability in fields where the economic consequences of the arrangements are not clear.  Given the limited 
development of the law dealing with reciprocity, this is not a case for application of a standard Stricter than the per se standard 
applied to tying arrangements."
952,8," .  The second trial after remand was made to the bench, because the parties waived trial by jury.  The district court's conclusion 
came not on a directed verdict or summary judgment, but after this bench trial. "
955,9," .  In Advance Business Systems, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit said: ""Congress singled out tie-ins for special treatment in the Clayton Act upon the generally accepted view that they rarely have any 
function other than suppression of competition.  For the same reason, a seller's successful imposition of a tying arrangement on 
a substantial amount of commerce may be taken as proof of his economic power over the tying product.  See Fortner 
Enterprises (I) . . .  Northern Pacific . . .  (citations omitted).  The Clayton Act Therefore requires no separate showing of 
economic dominance where a tying arrangement affects sufficient commerce."" (Emphasis added.)"
955,415," F.2d at 62. At least one commentator has attacked use of a weaker standard under the Clayton Act. See L. Sullivan, 
Antitrust 440-41 (1977)."
955,10," .  The question whether the district court erred procedurally by granting a directed verdict at the close of Plaintiffs' evidence is 
now moot.  So is the question whether the district court abused its discretion in the award of attorneys' fees.  The prevailing party 
in this litigation is once again in question.  The evidentiary issue concerning Spartan's practices in other areas should be 
reconsidered by the trial court in light of the larger inquiry into Spartan's market position required on remand. Two final issues Spartan raises must be rejected.  (a) The district court did not err by failing to find, as a matter of law, that the 
producers had no damages.  We view this question as dependent, of course, on the liability question.  If liability had been 
properly established, damages could have been recovered.  The amount of those damages was properly submitted to the jury.  
(b) Nor did the district court err in rejecting Spartan's res judicata argument.  Spartan urges that because, in the contract action, 
the lower court and this Court agreed that the price of its feed was not unreasonable under U.C.C. standards, it could not have 
been a violation of the antitrust laws.  Spartan has cited no authority for the proposition that commercially reasonable prices 
cannot still be higher than those which could have been obtained absent an antitrust violation.  The argument is meritless. "
964,*, Senior Circuit Judge Leonard P. Moore of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is sitting by designation. 
965,1," The subsidiaries through which Sealy makes and sells mattresses in its seven territories and makes spring units were also 
named as parties to this action."
965,2," Ohio services five of the territories through four subsidiaries, which are also parties herein."
965,3," As pertinent, § 1 provides: Every contract, combination . . . or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign 
nations, is declared to be illegal . . . ."
965,4," The district court in Sealy had found and enjoined a conspiracy to fix minimum retail prices, and no appeal was taken from its 
judgment order in that respect. While the Supreme Court pointed out the nexus between this price-fixing and the allocation of 
markets, 388 U.S. at 355-58, 87 S. Ct. 1847, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1238, it is clear that the latter element is illegal Per se even though the 
former element is absent. See id. at 357 n.5, 87 S. Ct. 1847; United States v. Topco Associates, Inc., 405 U.S. 596, 609 n.9, 92 
S. Ct. 1126, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515 (1972). "
966,5," An exception would be Ohio's prayer for equitable relief. All of the elements of Ohio's complaint were in issue in the jury trial, 
so if there was insufficient evidence of antitrust violations to warrant submission of the case to the jury, equitable relief would 
obviously be foreclosed. If, on the other hand, judgment n. o. v. should have been granted on the ground that no recoverable 
damages were proved, equitable relief could nonetheless be appropriate. "
967,6," Ohio argues that a trap was created, because Sealy agreed to instructions inconsistent with legal arguments made in this 
court. This argument, even if true, bears no relationship to the question under consideration. Rule 51, Fed.R.Civ.P., HN4[
] 
forecloses objections on appeal to agreed instructions and unless, as Sealy argues, the controlling law has clearly changed, 
Sealy can gain no advantage from the ""trap"" Ohio says it attempted to lay."
967,7," The southern California licensee successfully maintained a declaratory judgment action before the same district court judge 
who tried the present action, establishing that invalidation of the exclusive territory system did not nullify his prior contract in toto.  
Sealy Mattress Co. of Southern California v. Sealy, Inc., 346 F. Supp. 353 (N.D.Ill.1972). Sealy thereafter acquired the licensee's 
business."
967,8, The agreement was revised in 1971 and subsequently without changes pertinent to the present discussion. 
968,9, The 1968 contract had set the charge at 50 cents per piece on all mattresses and box springs sold outside the APR. 
969,10," Evidence indicated that the St. Louis market, currently served by the Memphis licensee from a plant in Memphis, is such an 
instance. "
970,11," Indeed, as much as Sealy emphasizes its figures on the amount of sales out-of-APR to show that such sales were in fact 
quite possible, the figures do not contradict Dr. Mueller's conclusions. Between 1969 and the first six months of 1976, Ohio did 
make millions of dollars of out-of-APR sales, but the record would amply support the conclusion that Ohio was the kind of 
licensee that was likely to make the best of even a very restrictive situation. The fact that Ohio overcame the obstacles to some 
degree in no way proves that it was not significantly impeded in making even more sales in intrabrand competition. Moreover, 
analysis of out-of-APR sales by licensees other than Ohio is quite telling. Notwithstanding that in at least one extended market 
area, the densely populated northeast, there are many city markets within less than 200 miles of numerous licensees' plants, 
less than .0042 of Sealy sales were made in the 1969-1976 period out-of-APR. Although, as Sealy points out, there appears to 
be a trend to increased amounts of such sales, the pertinent figures for 1974, 1975, and the first six months of 1976 were only: 
less than .009, less than .012, and approximately .007, respectively."
970,12," Sealy's position derived some evidentiary support from proof that Sealy explored the possibilities of vertical integration with 
two different business consulting firms, and that Sealy and a number of its licensees entered a valuation program conducted by 
one of the consulting firms to appraise the licensees' businesses. Ohio took the position that the program, with its corollary 
restriction that no participating licensee could sell its business during the course of the valuations, was at least in part a move to 
limit intrabrand competition by removing licensees from the acquisitions market in which Ohio was interested. "
971,13," We are aware of no authority interpreting Sylvania as having any pertinence to horizontal restraints such as those at bar.  
Newberry v. Washington Post Company, 438 F. Supp. 470, 474 n.5 (D.D.C.1977); Evanston Motor Company, Inc. v. Mid-
Southern Toyota Distributors, Inc., 436 F. Supp. 1370, 1372-73 (N.D.Ill.1977); and Pitchford Scientific Instruments Corporation v. 
Pepi, Inc., 435 F. Supp. 685, 688 (W.D.Pa.1977), all recognize the lack of such pertinence, and Sealy has not suggest that there 
are any cases to the contrary. "
972,14," The Court emphasized that a very different case would have been presented had plaintiffs shown that Brunswick had abused 
its deep pocket by engaging in, E. g., predatory conduct injuring plaintiffs, but plaintiffs made out no such case."
972,15," As we have noted, Ohio claimed a total of $ 9,233,563 in damages, of which $ 6,436,995 represented profits lost by the lost 
acquisitions. The jury's verdict awarded $ 6,814,852."
972,16," Sealy hypothesizes that if an outside buyer had simply outbid Ohio in its attempts to acquire the licensees, there would have 
been the same loss to Ohio without any antitrust violation. This argument has the appeal of superficial similarity to an example 
used by the Court in Brunswick. See discussion Supra. But the point the Court was making there that there was no nexus 
between the injury claimed and the purposes of the antitrust laws simply cannot be made here, for reasons discussed Infra. The 
incorrectness of lifting the example from the Brunswick opinion and attempting to generalize it without regard to its context can 
be quickly demonstrated by an example: if General Motors, on its own and for bona fide and unassailable business reasons 
chose to stop supplying one of its dealers with automobiles, there would be no antitrust violation, yet the loss to the dealer would 
be identical to that which would result if all the neighboring dealers had pressured GM to cease supply in order to reduce 
intrabrand competition. We doubt that even Sealy would argue that the loss in the latter instance would not be antitrust injury. 
See United States v. General Motors Corp., 384 U.S. 127, 86 S. Ct. 1321, 16 L. Ed. 2d 415 (1966). "
973,17," Sealy advances the related argument that Ohio's losses were not caused by the right of first refusal or its exercise, but merely 
by Ohio's decision not to make higher bids than Sealy was willing to match. We wholly disagree. The jury was properly instructed 
that HN11[
] it would be sufficient to establish causation if the jury found antitrust violations to be material factors in causing 
loss. See Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U.S. 100, 114 n.9, 89 S. Ct. 1562, 23 L. Ed. 2d 129 (1969). We 
note that there was no evidence indicating that Ohio had the power to force a licensee desirous of selling his business to 
withdraw the business from sale to Sealy once the right of first refusal was exercised. Indeed, the thrust of Sealy's counterclaim, 
rejected by the jury, was that Ohio committed grievous wrong by the role it may have played in even Encouraging selling 
licensees to withdraw their business from sale at the time of Sealy's attempted exercise of the right. Moreover, in both Florida 
and Philadelphia, Ohio did up the ante significantly, only to have Sealy (which had not expressed previous interest in acquiring 
either licensee) match the higher offer, even though at least in the case of Florida, Sealy considered the price paid too high. The 
jury could surely have found that the market allocation scheme was in fact the cause of Sealy's exercise of the right of first 
refusal."
973,18," We emphasize that it is by no means clear that the profits Ohio would have made in the territories would not have been 
entirely attributable to increased intrabrand and interbrand competition. Sealy, after all, a demonstrably less effective interbrand 
competitor which, perhaps understandably, made no significant intrabrand sales in the territories, Lost money on the territories 
acquired to block Ohio's expansion. We note here, in passing, that Sealy does not attack the method used by Ohio to estimate 
its lost profits, applying a representative Ohio-plant profit margin to the sales actually made in the territories after Sealy acquired 
them. Cf.  Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., supra, 395 U.S. at 116-17, 89 S. Ct. 1562. "
974,19," Sealy Spring Corporation Indiana was the only subsidiary in existence throughout the entire damage period, but Sealy Spring 
Corporation East and Sealy Spring Corporation West were approved suppliers from their inception through the end of the period."
974,20," Sealy's Vice President at one time wrote a letter to the President of an approved spring supplier, referring to the charge as a 
royalty for the privilege of supplying Sealy licensees. Although Sealy's trial witnesses attempted to characterize the charge as 
compensation to Sealy for its quality control inspection program for suppliers, officials of Sealy had prior to 1971 frequently 
referred to the charge as a royalty, a commission, or a load charge. Sealy also had at one time, extending into the damage 
period pertinent to this case, received rebates on mattress ticking supplied to licensees, such rebates being justified only by a 
desire for revenues for Sealy. Sealy does not argue on appeal that the jury was obligated to accept the quality control service 
charge characterization."
974,21," Ohio's purchases alone of the allegedly tied components amounted to approximately $ 9.6 million during the pertinent period, 
and the entire Sealy organization obviously purchased many times this amount."
974,22," Ohio introduced evidence that it would have purchased comparable items elsewhere (given the premium price Universal was 
charging) but for the mandatory specification. "
975,23," The Sixth Circuit's Fortner opinion cited Coniglio and Driskill as recognizing an actual foreclosure requirement, but declined to 
apply it as a bar to the case before it."
975,24," Because the jury may have awarded some damages flowing from the tie-in, Sealy, under Coniglio and Driskill, would be 
entitled either to a new trial, or to a remittitur of the full amount of damages claimed from tying to eliminate the possibility it was 
prejudiced by submitting the claim to the jury. See Durant v. Surety Homes Corporation, No. 77-2045, 582 F.2d 1081 (7th Cir. 
August 8, 1978). The possibility also exists that the district court's remittitur of half of the jury verdict, if erroneously offered as an 
alternative to a new trial, would render harmless the submission of the tying theory to the jury. See discussion Infra. "
976,25," Sealy's attack on the sufficiency of the evidence to prove this point is without merit. Evidence indicated not only identity of 
actual prices charged but also an express agreement to fix prices. That Sealy's officials denied the agreement, or that Ohio 
could not prove the agreement continued to any definite ending date, would not have justified taking the question from the jury."
976,26," Sealy's attack on the sufficiency of the evidence to make a jury question of Ohio's theory of monopolization of Posturepedic 
springs is based entirely on the no-foreclosure argument which we have just rejected. Accordingly, we reject the argument in this 
context as well."
976,27," It is a matter of some historical irony, if no great substantive significance, that the program was devised by a committee 
chaired by E.M. Wuliger, the President of Ohio."
976,28," The sole limitation on the right to withdraw was that a licensee was obliged to fill orders under the program for a six month 
transition period. No claim is made that this provision is illegal. "
977,29," Ohio repeatedly emphasizes that Ward's does not in fact deal with a single supplier of mattresses. It is true that Ward's has 
separate national suppliers of foam and innerspring mattresses, and that in a few isolated instances Ward's is obliged by 
circumstances to meet its needs locally. There is even one market area where Ward's agreed, in response to appeals from 
community leaders, to purchase mattresses from a local firm as part of a program to shore up the depressed economy in the 
market area. The essential fact, however, stands undisputed in the record: Ward's does have a policy of buying from a single 
source of supply, albeit that policy is subject to rare exceptions."
977,30," Ohio also claimed $ 294,915 in damages for royalties paid to Sealy for goods not bearing Sealy-brand labels. Over 97% Of 
these royalties derived from sales to Ward's while Ohio was in the national accounts program, but the rationale for these 
damages is analytically distinct and we consider this claim hereinafter. "
979,31," The district court judge decided that a danger existed that the jury might have realized that the cited case, See n.7 Supra, was 
tried by him and resolved adversely to Sealy. The court concluded, however, that the error, if it existed, was harmless. We think 
it doubtful from our review of the record that the jury would have made the connection between the California licensee's case 
and the presiding judge here, or that it would have inferred that the court had found Sealy at that time to be violating the antitrust 
laws (the case involved only the licensee's claim that its license contract was not nullified by the United States v. Sealy decree) 
even if it had realized the identity of the judge deciding the case. We do agree, however, that any error involved was harmless. 
Sealy does not attack this conclusion."
979,32," Sealy argues that United States v. Sealy should have been kept out of the trial and that at least an exhibit pertinent thereto 
that was sent to the jury room mandated a new trial. We agree with Sealy and the district court that Sealy could not form the 
basis of a collateral estoppel on liability herein, but think it clear from the facts of this case that Sealy was very much a relevant 
and proper part of the background of this litigation. The exhibit in issue here contained Judge Austin's findings and conclusions 
in Sealy both before and after the Supreme Court opinion, and a short precis (approved by the district court herein) of the latter 
opinion. We agree with the district court and the parties that it would have been better if the jury had not been given Judge 
Austin's opinions. (These were apparently left in the exhibit transmitted to the jury accidentally.) We are unable, however, to find 
any real possibility of prejudice resulting from the transmittal. The exhibit was one of Many exhibits sent to the jury. The fact that 
Sealy had engaged in market allocation was properly known to the jury without the exhibit, and the jury was correctly instructed 
that if it found Sealy to have continued the practice, it should find a Per se violation. As to Judge Austin's findings that Sealy had 
also engaged in illegal resale price maintenance, we agree that those facts were of little if any relevance to this case, but Sealy's 
own witness, on direct examination, had testified to the prior practice and its illegality. "
982,33," It follows from our conclusion here that submitting the national accounts program and non-Sealy royalty damages to the jury 
was only harmless error. "
983,34," We express no view on the propriety of Ohio's request that the court order Sealy to divest the acquired licensees to Ohio, 
other than to say that the court should consider this issue along with all others in deciding what total mix of equitable relief, if 
any, might be just in the circumstances, and to state that such relief would not be foreclosed simply by Ohio's having received 
damages for past lost profits on this theory. Obviously, in any event Ohio would not be allowed to receive the licensees without 
payment therefor. "
985,35," This argument would theoretically deny Ohio interest only until May 27, 1976, when Ohio filed its remittitur, except that no 
renewed judgment was entered at that time or, indeed, until January 18, 1977. Because we reject the assertion that judgment 
was improperly entered on April 3, 1975, we need not decide whether, if the assertion were accurate, Ohio could legitimately 
seek interest for the period between May 27, 1976 and January 18, 1977. "
990,1," The concession operated under the name of Nelson Bunker Hunt. In this opinion, ""Hunt"" will be used to denote the business 
entity; the full name of an individual will be used to denote the particular individual."
990,2," Also originally named as defendants were Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Grace Petroleum Corporation and Gelsenberg 
A.G.  Prior to trial the action was discontinued as to Grace and Gelsenberg. Plaintiffs did not oppose Occidental's motion for 
dismissal at the end of plaintiffs' case made pursuant to Rule 41(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. "

992,7," Mobil had a majority interest in a concession with Gelsenberg. Texaco and Socal each controlled a 50% Interest in a Libyan 
oil-producing entity known as Amoseas.  Shell had a 16.67% Interest in a group known as Oasis, the other members of which 
were three independents Continental, Marathon and Amerada Hess.  Exxon had interests in the Zeltan field and Esso Sirte 
concessions."
992,8," In 1972, the defendants produced almost 2 billion barrels of oil in Saudi Arabia; liftings exceeded 1.3 billion barrels in Iran and 
1.7 billion for the remaining Persian Gulf countries. "
994,9," The McCloy Group met on Monday, January 11, 1971.  The discussion centered about the OPEC Resolutions and the 
Teheran negotiations scheduled for the next day as well as the Libyan threats and demands.  As the minutes of that meeting 
reflect, the conferees thought it ""essential that other producing companies, including the so-called ""independents,' . . .  be invited 
to participate"" in the proposed joint negotiations."
994,10," ""Tax-paid cost"" referred to the per-barrel operating cost including royalties, taxes and other payments to the producing 
country."
994,11," The ""dimes clause"" was embodied in paragraph 4 of the LPA:"
994,4," . In respect of each barrel of Persian Gulf crude oil a party is obligated to supply but has not supplied under paragraph 2(e) or 3 
(the sharing provisions): (a) Such party shall have the option to elect to pay 10 cents; provided if such option is elected it shall apply pro rata as to every 
party to whom such Persian Gulf Producing Party has such an obligation; "
995,," (b) Such party shall have the obligation to pay said 10 cents if it is prevented from delivering such barrels by an act of the 
Government having jurisdiction and in each case such payment shall constitute a full and complete discharge of such party's 
obligations under such paragraph.  Without in any way modifying, limiting or conditioning its legal right to exercise the option set 
forth above in paragraph 4(a), and it being expressly understood that the exercise of such option shall give rise to no claim other 
than that for payment of the amounts due under paragraph 4(a), each of the Persian Gulf Producing Parties states that its 
present intention is to supply Persian Gulf crude oil in discharge of its obligations under paragraphs 2(e) and 3."
995,12," As Carlisle testified at trial: (When the independents) came and said, ""Look we want the three years,"" the majors paused and thought, ""Well, three years is 
a long time in the oil business.  A lot can happen.  We don't know what will be our position in years two or three, and we just 
cannot really see that we can enter into a firm commitment for three years to put this Persian Gulf crude oil into the pooling 
agreement as the backup crude. We must have this option."" T.R. at 2945."
995,13," The LPA was not intended to guarantee the parties a particular profit.  The preamble to the agreement recognized that the 
parties ""might suffer serious financial consequences which would not be fully alleviated by the limited mutual self-help provisions 
of this agreement."" "

996,17," Since BP was a Persian Gulf producer, it was placed in the position of receiving Libyan crude from other Libyan producers 
while supplying Persian Gulf crude to independents who supplied Libyan crude."
996,18," Parties ""nominated"" crude by designating a vessel that would be available to take a particular amount of crude oil at a 
designated port. "
997,19," This included: a party's expected and actual production in each quarter; the maximum amount of oil the party could have 
produced absent Libyan government restrictions; the production of the Persian Gulf producers for each quarter; and, as to each 
non-Persian Gulf producer, the volume of pre-existing European and Western Hemisphere customer commitments or renewals 
thereof."
997,20," LESSCOM did not receive data concerning the tax-paid cost of a barrel of oil (the price paid for each barrel transferred under 
the LPA).  Payments and disbursements under the LPA were handled by Price Waterhouse & Co., which did not disclose to the 
parties the tax-paid cost charged by the suppliers of crude oil."
997,21," Hunt's refusal was grounded on a combination of factors: (1) concern that BP would attach ships carrying Sarir crude upon 
arrival at ports of destination; (2) concern that marketing BP's share of the oil would violate the LPA; and (3) belief that such 
marketing was ethically wrong since it cast Hunt as an abettor in the nationalization of BP, an act Hunt considered illegal."
997,22," ""Crude-short"" describes the position of an oil company whose equity entitlements to oil under its concessions (including its 
ability to lift more than its share) are insufficient to meet its total system demands and obligations to third parties."
997,23," Four of the majors owned interests in IPC: Mobil, 11.875%; BP, 23.76%; Shell, 23.75%; and Exxon, 11.875%. "
998,24," The backlogs were due to logistical problems in scheduling liftings, securing customers, and arranging transfers with BP."
998,25," This ""barrel-for-barrel"" problem must be distinguished from the ""barrel-for-barrel"" policy adopted by BP in supplying Persian 
Gulf crude, discussed below at p. 233."
998,26," This entitlement, as discussed in detail under the First Claim, was further subject to the amount of an independent's pre-

1001,30," Hunt's Second Point the pre-existing customer clause is discussed under plaintiffs' First Claim.  See pp. 219-220 Infra. 
Apparently the Fourth Point was not discussed. "
1002,31," Case 1: All signatories, including Occidental, Marathon, Continental, Hess, Grace and Gelsenberg, would retain their 
entitlements under the LPA. Case 2: Same as Case 1, but Occidental, Marathon, Continental, Hess, Grace and Gelsenberg were to be treated as having lost 
their entitlements while retaining their obligations. Case 3: Same as Case 1, but Occidental, Marathon, Continental, Hess, Grace and Gelsenberg's entitlements would be 
calculated on the basis that the Libyan government's 51% Participation interest in their concessions was a cutback entitling them 
to crude oil under the LPA, while their obligations would be calculated on the basis of production data reflecting only their 
retained 49% Equity interest. Case 4: Same as Case 2, but Occidental, Marathon, Hess, Continental, Grace and Gelsenberg's obligations would be calculated 
on the basis of production data reflecting only their retained 49% Equity interest. "
1003,32," As a preliminary matter, the defendants assert that the Court has no subject matter jurisdiction over the First Claim because 
the LPA falls outside the scope of the antitrust laws.  They claim that the agreement was ""an unprecedented political response 
blessed by both the State and Justice Departments and inspired by equally unprecedented threats to world oil supplies by the 
Libyan and other OPEC governments"" and that the LPA was ""designed to benefit energy consumers by combating production 
restrictions, price increases and the desire of the host governments to acquire control of the oil production facilities within their 
borders."" Defendants' Post-Trial Memorandum at 5.  Stressing the unique and noncommercial nature of the LPA, defendants 
seek to analogize the agreement to a strike insurance plan among railroads, which the Second Circuit has held to be beyond the 
reach of the Sherman Act.  Kennedy v. Long Island R. R. Co., 319 F.2d 366 (2d Cir. 1963). The annals of antitrust law are replete with cases where the defendants have sought to justify their conduct on the ground that 
it promoted the common weal.  See, e.g., National Soc'y of Professional Eng'rs v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 693-95, 98 S. Ct. 
1355, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1978); United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 210-24, 60 S. Ct. 811, 84 L. Ed. 1129 
(1940). But the Supreme Court has made clear that HN3[
] decisions to exempt allegedly anticompetitive conduct from the 
purview of the antitrust laws ""must be made by Congress and not by private forces or by the courts.  Private forces are too 
keenly aware of their own interests in making such decisions and courts are ill-equipped and ill-situated for such decisionmaking.  
. . .  (T)he judgment of the elected representatives of the people is required."" United States v. Topco Assocs., Inc., 405 U.S. 596, 
611-12, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 1135, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515 (1972); See Timken Roller Bearing Co. v. United States, 341 U.S. 593, 599, 71

951, 58 L. Ed. 1490 (1914). The defendants cannot withdraw their conduct from judicial scrutiny by reciting a litany of good 
intentions. "
1004,," Nor is the Kennedy analogy a persuasive one.  There, the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen charged that the strike insurance 
plan of the railroads to the extent it helped a railroad resist wage demands was ""an attempt by the railroad industry to ""rig the 
price which it will pay for the essential ingredient of labor.' "" Kennedy v. Long Island R. R. Co., 211 F. Supp. 478, 489 
(S.D.N.Y.1962), Aff'd, 319 F.2d 366 (2d Cir. 1963). The District Court ruled that the plan was outside the purview of the antitrust 
laws, based on the exemption of section 6 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 17 (""The labor of a human being is not a commodity or 
article of commerce.""), and the Supreme Court's holding in Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U.S. 469, 60 S. Ct. 982, 84 L. Ed. 
1311 (1940). The District Court also found that the plan placed no restriction on competition in the marketplace.  211 F. Supp. at 
490. The Court of Appeals affirmed, stating that ""surely it cannot be said that the instant form of railroad cooperation in 
combatting the risks of labor unrest effects an unnatural and anticompetitive regulation of the pricing, supply, or distribution of 
goods or services,"" and that any such effect the plan had on the price of labor fell outside the Sherman Act.  319 F.2d at 373. Here, the defendants cannot avail themselves of the labor exemption.  Moreover, the plaintiffs are not launching a broadside 
attack on the purpose and effect of the sharing agreement as a whole.  They are challenging a particular clause in that 
agreement which, if found to be a resale restriction, has the potential of affecting the price and supply of crude oil. Thus plaintiffs' 
allegations concerning the pre-existing customer clause state a claim that falls within the purview of the Sherman Act."

] Per se rules . . .  require the Court to make broad generalizations about the social utility of particular commercial 
practices.  The probability that anticompetitive consequences will result from a practice and the severity of those consequences 
must be balanced against its pro-competitive consequences.  Cases that do not fit the generalization may arise, but a Per se 
rule reflects the judgment that such cases are not sufficiently common or important to justify the time and expense necessary to 
identify them.  Once established, Per se rules tend to provide guidance to the business community and to minimize the burdens 
on litigants and the judicial system of the more complex rule-of-reason trials, see Northern Pac. R. Co. v. United States, 356 
U.S. 1, 5, 78 S. Ct. 514, 518, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1958); United States v. Topco Associates, Inc., 405 U.S. 596, 609-10, 92 S. Ct.

in the law."
1005,43," 405 U.S. 596, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515 (1972). Topco involved a cooperative association of regional supermarket chains which procured and distributed to its members 
products under brand names owned by Topco.  The participating supermarkets entered into agreements with Topco which was 
found to be controlled by the members designating the territories in which the member could market the Topco-brand products.  
The Supreme Court found that the licensing system worked in effect to insulate members from competition in Topco-brand 
goods and held the restrictions a Per se violation of the Sherman Act.  The Court rejected the defense that by restricting 
competition among members the association actually increased competition in the market as a whole.  In Topco, the restraints "
1006,," were unambiguous indeed they were admitted by the defendant to be a necessary part of a well-conceived plan to reduce 
competition among members to increase their competitive edge in the industry."

1006,45," Compare the explicit restrictions in Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 38-39, 97 S. Ct. 2549, 53 L. Ed.

1007,46," This reading is consistent with an early draft of the pre-existing customer language, which provided that the majors supply 
Persian Gulf crude ""provided such additional crude Is required to supply such party's pre-existing customers for Libyan crude 
oil."" Plaintiffs' Trial Exhibit 28 (emphasis supplied)."
1007,47," Rooney testified: Q . . .  (Y)ou mentioned that one of the limits on the amount of backup Persian Gulf crude oil you would get was the production 
which you had in the month prior to the first cutback, November ""71 as it turned out. A That's correct. Q . . .  Was it another one of the limitations on the amount of backup Persian Gulf crude that you might become entitled to, the 
amount of commitments to pre-existing Western Hemisphere and European customers and renewals there(of)? A Yes. T.R. at 6069."
1007,48," Plaintiffs' Trial Exhibit 658-D, p. 2."
1007,49," As noted above, See p. 200 Supra, the idea of supplying crude to cutback companies first arose in the fall of 1970."
1007,50," This, in fact, occurred: as Norman Rooney testified, Hunt force majeured its contracts with pre-existing customers when it 
began to supply Libyan crude to BP under the LPA. "
1008,51," Complaint P 44, Hunt v. Mobil Oil Corp., Civ. No. 234-74-A (E.D.Va., filed Apr. 29, 1974)."
1008,52," One witness, George Parkhurst of Socal, who was active in the drafting of the LPA, explained the geographical language as 
follows: There was no desire for restriction.  There was a desire to meet the pre-existing obligations of the need to supply one's 
customers. I must confess that the European thing was kind of a belt and suspenders possibility.  It was pre-existing customers 
but it was thought that all the pre-existing customers were European.  Later it was found there were Western Hemisphere 
customers and the language was expanded to include Western Hemisphere customers. T.R. at 1224."
1008,53, T.R. at 532-33. 
1009,54," While it is true that some officials at Socal sought to ascertain the destination of several LESSCOM cargoes in Europe in 
1972, this was an isolated event which was never acted upon and not a part of any attempt to enforce a territorial or customer 
restraint. "
1010,55, Plaintiffs' Trial Exhibit 130.
1010,56," Plaintiffs also rely on a Socal memorandum summarizing the June 14 Persian Gulf producers' meeting, which states: There was some discussion regarding offering a ""quid-pro-quo"" in the form of a waiver of the pre-existing customer commitment 
clause and make it a pre-existing volume commitment if non-PG Producers were reluctant to accept the ""barrel-for-barrel"" 
proposal.  One possible advantage seen by some for this ""quid"" is that the smaller producers may be forced into a ""price war"" 
and undercut crude prices in order to maintain pre-existing customers and retain their crude entitlement under the Sharing 
Agreement. Plaintiffs' Trial Exhibit 127 (emphasis supplied).  Plaintiffs argue that the suggestion that the clause be changed to a ""volume 
commitment"" demonstrates that it was not originally a volume limitation.  But this misreads the document.  The purpose of the 
proposal was to end the Hess problem; one solution would be to base entitlements to Persian Gulf crude solely upon the volume 
of pre-existing commitments and not upon the existence of a pre-existing customer commitment.  The document clearly 
perceives the pre-existing customer clause as a condition of entitlement."
1010,57," Moreover, the next day, November 21, 1972, Exxon and Hunt entered into a six-month contract at a price with which Rooney 
was ""fairly well satisfied."" The contract was thereafter extended for an additional six months. "
1011,58," Plaintiffs also seek to find enforcement of a territorial restriction in comments made by some of the majors during the 
Amerada Hess discussions to the effect that Hess should be given oil to take into its St. Croix refinery but not be permitted to sell 
it elsewhere.  However, as explained above, see p. 218 Supra, these comments shed little light on the original purpose or 
alleged subsequent enforcement of the challenged clause."
1011,59," See, e.g., Plaintiffs' Trial Exhibits 101 & 103."
1011,60, See note 79 infra.
1011,61," If the majors were concerned in any way about the pre-existing customer clause, it was that the independents might be 
receiving more crude than they were entitled to or than the spirit of the agreement called for (the barrel-for-barrel problem).  
Such a concern is understandable, given the fact that the back-up crude was provided at cost to the independents and 
sometimes at a substantial loss to the majors. "
1012,62, See note 43 supra.
1012,63," Cf.  Sitkin Smelting & Refining Co. v. FMC Corp., 575 F.2d 440, 447 (3d Cir. 1978) (""sham bidding"" scheme ""not . . .  so 
anticompetitive that the court routinely should allow a party to invoke the per se rule and thereby avoid the need to show its 
affect (Sic ) on commerce in each case""); Bradford v. New York Times Co., 501 F.2d 51, 60 (2d Cir. 1974) (rejecting per se 
standard in situation where there is ""a total absence of federal Sherman Act experience"")."
1012,64," An additional factor cuts against the plaintiffs' description of the pre-existing customer clause as a resale restriction that 
warrants per se treatment.  Under the LPA, the non-Persian Gulf producers were supplied crude oil at tax-paid cost; such 
provision of cost-crude to a company not owning an equity interest in the supplying concession is unknown outside of the LPA.  
Furthermore, there was no restriction on the plaintiffs' ability to buy Persian Gulf crude at prevailing market rates, and there was 
no restriction placed upon the resale of oil purchased on the market.  Under such circumstances, a per se rule is inappropriate.

had not been negotiated by me or by any of my people.  It had not been developed as a normal sales agreement in any way.  It 
was political, what you might call a political kind of an agreement, for completely different reasons than the economics of the 
corporation with which I was involved."" T.R. at 3078. It should be observed that supply executives of a number of majors questioned the policy judgment of top executives in the 
corporate hierarchy in supporting the supply of Persian Gulf back-up crude. Their critical attitude, which comes through in 
interoffice memoranda, explains a number of statements, not based on personal knowledge, which plaintiffs seize upon in an 
effort to support their claims. "

1018,84," In mid-June 1972, Shell projected an average deficit for the second half of the year of 325,000 barrels per day; in the next 
month Shell made arrangements to purchase an additional 27,000 barrels per day of Arabian Light crude and exercised an 
option with BP to lift 40,000 barrels per day of Kuwait crude for the fourth quarter of 1972.  By mid-September, due to increases 
in demand and losses of availability in Nigeria and Qatar, the supply data indicated a deficit of 195,000 barrels per day for the 
second half of 1972.  The same report stated that ""(o)ther majors have no surplus crude oil to offer and in some cases are in a 
tight supply situation themselves."" Defendants' Trial Exhibit 1842."

tight crude supply situation"" and substantially increased spot purchases.  Plaintiffs' Trial Exhibit 605.  In November 1972, supply

1019,88," Plaintiffs argue that the majors were not free to exercise the dimes option at will; rather, they assert, a company could go to 
dimes only if Persian Gulf crude was unavailable because of governmental action or force majeure.  This assertion is apparently 
intended to lend support to plaintiffs' claim that Shell, Mobil and Gulf felt they needed each others' ""company,"" as well as the 
acquiescence of the other defendants, in invoking the dimes option, because according to plaintiffs' view, they were exercising it 
in a situation not anticipated by the agreement.  Plaintiffs' interpretation disregards the clear language of the provision and is, in 
effect, a rewriting of the clause. Paragraph 4(a) states that each Persian Gulf producer ""shall have the Option "" (emphasis supplied) to supply ten cents in lieu of 
each barrel of Persian Gulf crude it is otherwise obligated to supply.  There is no language of restriction or condition in the 
clause.  Furthermore, paragraph 4(b) states that if a Persian Gulf producer is prevented from delivering barrels due to 
Government action, then the party ""shall have the Obligation "" (emphasis supplied) to pay ten cents per barrel. Since paragraph 
4(b) contains an absolute obligation to pay dimes as provided therein, plaintiffs' interpretation would render paragraph 4(a) 
surplusage. Paragraph 4(b) also provides that ""each of the Persian Gulf Producing Parties states that its Present intention is to supply 
Persian Gulf crude oil in discharge of its obligations (under the sharing provisions)."" (emphasis supplied) The use of ""present 
intention"" makes it clear that the majors had a choice as to whether they would supply crude or cash.  Indeed, the language was 
included because the independents recognized that a clear option existed and wanted assurances that, if Hunt and Occidental 
were cut back for taking a resistant stand when they returned to Libya a few days after the signing of the LPA, they would 
receive oil and not dimes. Furthermore, the ""present intention"" language is preceded by the explicit statement that: ""Without in 
any way modifying, limiting or conditioning its legal right to exercise the option set forth above in paragraph 4(a) . . .  (the majors 
state their present intention to supply oil)."" To be sure, there was testimony by some of the executives and supply personnel of the defendants (most of whom were not 
present at the drafting of the LPA) that the intent of the provision was to permit the substitution of dimes for oil only when oil was 
not physically available.  But the overwhelming weight of the testimonial evidence and the plain meaning of the words of the 
clause compel the conclusion that the Persian Gulf producers had an unrestricted option to supply dimes in lieu of Persian Gulf 
back-up crude. Plaintiffs' attempt to modify the clear language of the agreement by way of parol evidence must be viewed in light 
of paragraph 10 of the LPA which provides: ""This agreement consists of the entire agreement of the parties; there are no oral 
promises, representations or warranties."" "

of a conspiracy, to reject Hunt's points other than the extension. The record in fact demonstrates the antithesis of agreement.  It 
is a semantical game, in which this Court will not indulge, to transmute nonacceptance of a proposal into an agreement not to

writing a report on what he believes the majors will do and what the independents think they will do (Not the same thing )."" 
Plaintiffs' Trial Exhibit 185 (emphasis supplied).  But a careful reading of the Adam memo, written four days later, makes clear 
that Adam was referring to the different interpretations the majors and the independents placed on the various positions taken 
during the poll.  For example, Adam wrote that Socal said that they would adhere to the terms of the contract and on being questioned more closely (Socal Chairman) Otto Miller said 
that it was their intention in entering into the agreement in 1971 to deliver oil. I regarded this as a pretty equivocal statement but 
it was certainly interpreted by the independents, and I checked this with the independents the following day, that Socal would 
Definitely deliver oil through 1973/74. Plaintiffs' Trial Exhibit 186 (emphasis in original). "

1024,99," Plaintiffs' early claims that the defendants conspired to deny Hunt Libyan crude faded in light of the evidence at trial.  Final 
LESSCOM figures suggest that if any Libyan oil is owed Hunt, the vast majority of it is owed by other independents.  The fact 
that the majors generally lived up to their obligations to supply Libyan crude undermines a claim of concerted action in regard to

and was compensated at the net book value of the hardware on the concession; AGIP also agreed to purchase oil that the 
Libyans could not sell elsewhere. The actual percentage of the interest transferred is not necessarily determinative of what type of arrangement constitutes a 
participation.  For example, in Iran and Qatar ""100% Participation"" agreements were negotiated in which the participating 
companies gave up all ownership interests but continued to provide services to the host government, such as operational 
assistance, investment or off-take of crude at preferential prices. "

property, I consider that a degree of participation.  If you just settle for cash and walk away, that is not participation.  Well, that is

established a violation of the Sherman Act, unless a preponderance of the evidence indicates that the violation is continuing or 
that defendants are reasonably likely to engage in unlawful conduct in the future.  Westinghouse's position is based on the 
mistaken view that the Court lacks power merely to declare that past conduct violated the Sherman Act, because of both the 
case and controversy limitation of Article III of the Constitution and the terms of the jurisdictional grant of the Sherman Act § 4.  
The Supreme Court declared in United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 632, 73 S. Ct. 894, 897, 97 L. Ed. 1303 (1953),

defendants' ""heavy burden of persuasion"" to show mootness could only be met by a demonstration that the allegedly wrongful

value in showing the existence of illegal agreements among defendants.  It merely shows activities which one would normally 
expect of a large corporate enterprise with widespread interests. In addition, the Government charges that Weico, the Westinghouse subsidiary responsible for administering the agreements 
between Westinghouse and Melco and MHI, had a practice of shielding its files from inculpatory statements.  Government 
Evidence Summary, Part aIG, pp. 1.120-1.27.  For example, Westinghouse allegedly selectively ""purged"" its files of incriminating

to believe that they acted out of a ""patent motivation."" See Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Evidence, Note on Rule 
801, subdivision (a), 34 L. Ed. 2d cliv, clv (1970).  Thus the Court can properly infer from a request for a patent license or a 
response denying such a license that the parties involved believed that a valid patent covered or probably covered the product 
for which the license was sought.  See People v. Barnhart, 66 Cal.App.2d 714, 153 P.2d 214 (1944); See also Mutual Life

1044,38," For example, the Government chooses to compare Westinghouse steam turbine sales in the United States from 1962-68 with 
its Japanese sales from 1964-1970, suggesting that these are ""comparable"" periods.  The use of different periods is curious 
since in 1962, which is included in measuring American sales but not for Japanese sales, Westinghouse gross billings of $ 
5,582,000 for its steam turbine sales in Japan exceeded those of all other United States companies ($ 3,127,000).  GX No. 
1419B.  On the other hand, 1970 was an unfavorable year for Westinghouse in the volatile Japanese steam turbine market, in 
which total American sales varied from $ 14,633,000 in 1966, to $ 55,000 in 1968.  The Government's use of statistics is 
therefore, to say the least, highly questionable."
1044,39," See GX Nos. 1419B, 67, 95."
1044,40," Indeed, the Government has not shown any adverse impact upon competition in know-how (the ""tied"" product).  It has not 
even established that there were any competing sources of know-how to be affected.  Nor has it demonstrated that Melco or 
MHI felt precluded from purchasing the tied product from Westinghouse competitors.  Finally, there is little support for the 
Government's contention that the royalties charged by Westinghouse were so high that Melco could not remain competitive if it 
paid additional royalties to other sources of know-how, assuming there were any.  See, e.g., GX No. 513 (indicating that Melco 
purchased technological information from RCA concerning color television in addition to the information available from 
Westinghouse); GX No. 627 (showing that Melco needed a patent license from Texas Instruments for the manufacture of 
integrated circuits as well as technical support from Westinghouse). "

1062,," conceded that the draft operates to depress the starting salary levels of ""top college players,"" Brief of NFL at 7, a class that 
evidently includes plaintiff, who was the twelfth player in the nation to be drafted in 1968. Defendants nevertheless suggest that 
plaintiff lacks standing to sue, arguing that any short-run pecuniary loss he may have suffered is more than offset by the long-run 
benefits financial and otherwise that accrue to players from the draft. Brief of Pro-Football, Inc., at 29-44. Putting to one side the 
consideration that plaintiff, whose football career was terminated by an injury in his first year, was not around to reap this rich 
harvest of benefits, defendant's theory that § 4 incorporates a ""net loss"" provision is frivolous, and we reject it. HN4[

Whatever relevance ""offsetting benefits"" may have to the determination of the reasonableness of a restraint at the Merits stage, 
they are utterly irrelevant to a determination of ""injury-in-fact"" at the Standing stage. HN5[

to their employer, generally on the ground that any injury to the employee is ""indirect."" See Berger & Bernstein, An Analytical 
Framework for Antitrust Standing, 86 Yale L.J. 809, 821-23 (1977). Yet the courts have invariably found that athletes have 
standing to challenge player restrictions in professional sports, since these restraints operate directly on, and to the detriment of, 
the employee. See generally Robertson v. National Basketball Ass'n, 389 F. Supp. 867, 883-84 (S.D.N.Y.1975) (citing cases)."

1063,6," .  The draft and its attendant restrictions govern the Entry of college players (""rookies"") into the NFL. A distinct set of restraints 
inhibits the Mobility of players once they have signed with an NFL club. The Standard Player Contract as it existed in 1968 
contained an ""option"" clause which gave a club, in the event that it and a player could not come to contract terms, the right 
unilaterally to renew the player's contract for a second year at 90% Of his previous year's salary. If a player, despite the obvious 
financial disincentive, elected to ""play out his option,"" he became a ""free agent"" at the end of his second year and technically 
was free to negotiate with any other team. At this point, however, a player's ""freedom"" was considerably restricted by the 
""Rozelle rule,"" NFL Constitution & By-Laws, Art. 12.1(H) (1968), Reprinted in J.A. at 214-15. This rule essentially required the 
signing club to compensate the player's former team; if the two clubs were unable to conclude mutually satisfactory 
arrangements, the Commissioner could award compensation in the form of current players, future draft choices, or both, as he in 
his sole discretion deemed ""fair and equitable."" The Rozelle rule restrained player mobility because of its In terrorem effect on 
the prospective signing team: teams were reluctant to risk losing key players and valuable draft choices at the Commissioner's 
disposition, and thus were reluctant to sign a ""free agent"" unless they had succeeded in reaching an agreement with the player's 
former team an agreement which the former team, if it were recalcitrant, could preclude. These restraints, upon which we 
express no views here, are discussed in Mackey v. NFL, 543 F.2d 606 (8th Cir. 1976), Cert. dismissed, 434 U.S. 801, 98 S. Ct. 
28, 54 L. Ed. 2d 59 (1977); Kapp v. NFL, 390 F. Supp. 73 (N.D.Cal.1974), Aff'd in part and appeal dismissed in part as moot, 
586 F.2d 644 (9th Cir. 1978). In February 1977 the NFL clubowners and Players Association agreed to a new 5-year contract that works significant changes in 
the draft, Rozelle rule, option clause, and Standard Player Contract. See N.Y. Times, 18 Feb. 1977, at 21, col. 2; Id., 26 Feb. 
1977, at 15, col. 4. The modified draft is far less restrictive than the one described in the text; it continues for fewer rounds (thus 
applying to fewer players), eliminates the selecting team's ""perpetual"" right of negotiation with its players, facilitates players' 
becoming ""free agents,"" and establishes minimum salary levels for ""rookies."" Relaxations are also introduced into the Rozelle 
rule (limiting it to ""upper salary level"" players), the option clause (making the option year salary 110% Of the previous year's and 
eliminating option clause after four seasons), and the Standard Player Contract (providing certain injury-protection guarantees). 
These modifications were noted favorably by the District Court in approving a settlement of the Mackey case. See Alexander v. 
NFL, No. 4-76-Civil 123 (D.Minn. 29 July 1977), slip op. at 26-28. We express no views on the legality of the modified NFL 
player draft, confining our attention to the draft as it existed in 1968."

1066,22," .  The term ""group boycott,"" as the Eighth Circuit has noted, can be used as ""a very broad label for divergent types of concerted 
activity,"" Worthen Bank & Trust Co. v. National BankAmericard, Inc., 485 F.2d 119, 125 (8th Cir. 1973), Cert. denied, 415 U.S. 
918, 94 S. Ct. 1417, 39 L. Ed. 2d 473 (1974), and there is in consequence ""more confusion about the scope and operation of 
the Per se rule against group boycotts than in reference to any other aspect of the Per se doctrine."" L. A. Sullivan, Supra note 15 
at 229-30. When confronted with concerted refusals to deal that do not fit the classic ""group boycott"" pattern, the courts almost 
without exception have held the Per se rule inapplicable. In reaching this conclusion, however, they have vacillated between two 
divergent paths. Some courts have adhered to the traditional canon that all group boycotts are illegal Per se, and concluded that 
the concerted activity at issue was not a group boycott. See, e. g., Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc. v. Hawaiian Oke & Liquors, 
Ltd., 416 F.2d 71, 76-79 (9th Cir. 1969), Cert. denied, 396 U.S. 1062, 90 S. Ct. 752, 24 L. Ed. 2d 755 (1970). Other courts have 
held that the concerted activity at issue was a group boycott, but that there were two types of group boycotts ""Per se boycotts"" 
and ""rule of reason boycotts"" and that the concerted activity at issue fell into the second category. See, e. g., 11 Von Kalinowski, 
Antitrust Laws and Trade Regulation § 76.02 at 76-11 (1978) (citing cases). Although these divergent paths presumably will lead 
in most cases to the same destination, their coexistence has not encouraged clarity or consistency of analysis. The Supreme Court shed some light on this problem in St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Barry, 438 U.S. 531, 98 S. Ct. 2923, 57 
L. Ed. 2d 932 (1978). In that case, the Court held that the refusal by a group of insurance companies to deal on any terms with 
certain policyholders was a ""boycott"" within the meaning of § 3(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1013(b) (1976). 
Noting that its own previous decisions ""reflect(ed) a marked lack of uniformity in defining the term,"" the Court decided that 
""boycott"" should be given the broad meaning familiar from labor law and rejected defendants' attempt to define it as ""embracing 
only those combinations which target Competitors of the boycotters as the ultimate objects of a concerted refusal to deal."" 438 
U.S. at 542, 98 S. Ct. at 2930 (emphasis original). Although the Court did not delimit ""the precise reach"" of the term, Id. at 545 
n.18, 98 S. Ct. at 2932 n.18, it held that a ""boycott"" was at least broad enough to include the practice involved in that case, 
namely, an agreement by which one company ""induced its competitors to refuse to deal on any terms with its customers."" Id. at 
544, 98 S. Ct. at 2931. Given the Court's broad definition of ""boycott"" in St. Paul Fire & Marine, we assume for purposes of this decision that the NFL 
draft could be described as a ""boycott"" although as we noted above, the draft, unlike the agreement in that case, is not strictly an 
agreement Among competitors. See pp.  -- - -  -- - of 193 U.S.App.D.C., pp. 1178-1179 of 593 F.2d Supra. To describe the draft 
as a boycott, however, is not to end our inquiry. The Court noted in St. Paul Fire & Marine that "" ""boycotts are not a unitary 
phenomenon,' "" Id. at 543, 98 S. Ct. at 2931, Quoting P. Areeda, Antitrust Analysis 381 (1974), and stated that the issue before 
it was only ""whether the conduct in question involves a boycott, not whether it is Per se Unreasonable."" 438 U.S. at 542, 98 S. 
Ct. at 2930. In rejecting defendants' argument that A boycott should be defined as ""limited to concerted activity . . . against 
competitors of members of the boycotting group,"" Id. at 552, 98 S. Ct. at 2935, the Court expressed no view as to whether ""a Per 
se offense in this area"" should be so defined.  Id. at 542 & n.14, 98 S. Ct. at 2930 & n.14. Although the Court has clarified 
boycott analysis by suggesting that judicial investigations should pursue the second path described above, it left open the 
question that confronts us here: whether boycotts not designed to exclude competitors are illegal Per se. "
1067,23," .   L. A. Sullivan, Supra note 15 at 232. See Id. at 231-32: Suppose . . . that a group of professional football teams agreed not to hire any player found to have gambled on games. This is 
a concerted refusal to deal. But, whatever the purposes and effects may be thought to be, it is a concerted arrangement very 
different from the typical boycott. It does not constitute concerted action by competing firms at one level to exclude other would-
be competitors. It ought, then, not to be analyzed under a generic rule which deals with concerted efforts by traders at a given 
level to insulate themselves from other competition. Cf.  Molinas v. National Basketball Ass'n, 190 F. Supp. 241 (S.D.N.Y.1961) (boycott Per se rule inapplicable to NBA suspension

1070,46," .  The bulk of our colleague's dissent is devoted to a recitation and analysis of detailed facts relating to the history of 
professional football, some in the record before the district court and some supplemental thereto. See note 49 Infra. Our 
colleague then makes his own findings of fact as to the benefits derived in 1968 and currently from the professional football draft, 
and its effect on competition, these findings of fact differing from those of the trial court. For example, ""(s)ome argue that this 
(competitive balance) has been caused by other factors, but the preponderance of the Factual testimony and record evidence 
supports a conclusion that the college player draft was the key factor which produced the competitive balance of the teams . . . . 
There was no showing to the contrary in the 2,000 page record."" Dis. op. at  -- -,  -- - of 193 U.S.App.D.C., at  -- , 1198-1199 of 
593 F.2d. First, we believe that the NFL's theory of competitive balance, even were it empirically valid, is legally wide of the mark in a rule 
of reason inquiry, See pp.  -- - -  -- - of 193 U.S.App.D.C. 1185-1189 of 593 F.2d, Infra. Moreover, there Was a showing in the 
record which contradicts the findings of the dissent as our colleague himself realizes: ""The court concluded that the evidence on 
whether the draft was essential to competitive balance was ""at best equivocal,' and that no correlation was demonstrated 
between the draft and survival of the League."" Dis. op. at  -- - of 193 U.S.App.D.C., at 1211 of 593 F.2d. We suggest HN14[
] this finding of fact by the trial court, as recited by our colleague, must be affirmed if there is evidence in 
the record to support it, and that an appellate court cannot make a different finding of fact, particularly when the record evidence 
obviously lends itself to the conclusion reached by the trial court. See Daniels v. Hadley Memorial Hospital, 185 U.S. App.D.C. 
84, 91, 566 F.2d 749, 756 (1977). First, to the extent the defendant's theory relies on the draft as a device to allocate player talent evenly, without which wealthy 
owners would be free to corner the market, Judge Bryant found ""abundant convincing testimony"" that factors other than money 
are often decisive in players' choice of teams. 420 F. Supp. at 746. See J.A. at 945 (unrelated business opportunities); Id. at 
1049-52 (same); Id. 1073-74 (racial discrimination and general community atmosphere); Id. at 1080-84 (preference for NFL over 
AFL); Id. at 1086, 1091-92 (dispute with owner); Id. at 1112 (climate); Id. at 1212 (educational opportunities); Id. at 1214-15 
(disagreement with coaching staff and management). Further, the evidence with regard to the movement of free agents and 
former World Football League players who were ungoverned by the draft did not reveal any trend for the best players to become 
concentrated with teams ""offering money, glamour and success."" 420 F. Supp. at 746, Citing Free Agents' First Wave On the 
Move, Washington Post, 7 July 1976, at D1. Second, it is doubtful whether the draft was effective in maintaining whatever competitive balance did exist in the League. 
Although from year to year the worst teams usually got somewhat better and the best teams somewhat worse, it is uncertain 
how much, if any, of this is explained by the draft. See J.A. at 939-40, 990, 1975 (testimony of Dr. George Burman); Id. at 1968-
69 (testimony of Bruce Caputo). Without by any means going into the minute detail furnished with such relish by our colleague, we think that two other factors 
contribute at least as much as the player draft to producing and maintaining a competitive balance in the league Television 
revenues and Coaching changes. The player draft originated in 1935 and was in full effect from then on, but none of the wonderful development of the professional 
football game pointed to by the appellant, and encored by our colleague, occurred until the mid-1950's. The advent of 
professional football on television created a synergistic effect between television and the sport. Television exposure brought 
more fans, produced more revenues, which in turn produced better paid players, more profitable franchises, and generally a 
better entertainment feature for television. This sort of ratchet effect started working in the mid-1950's with the advent of 
television and has continued over the years. See Proceedings, Conference on the Economics of Professional Sports, 
Washington, D.C., 7 May 1974, at 30, J.A. at 290. "
1071,," It is possible to say that in the 1935-1955 period the player draft had some importance in preserving a kind of competitive 
balance, preventing rich owners from running away with the league (if there were any independently rich owners of the then only 
nine professional football teams). But by 1968, as now, the impact of the player draft is clearly different from what arguably it had 
been in 1935-1955. The great equalizing feature now is not the player draft, but the league's arrangement to place the teams financially on nearly 
equal footing equal sharing of television revenues. In 1968 each team in the NFL received nearly one third of its revenues from 
television and radio, averaging.$ 1.13 million. See J.A. at 618. (In 1974, the most recent year for which figures appear in the 
record, such revenues averaged $ 2.28 million and were 34.5 percent of total revenues. Id. at 655). We were told at oral 
argument by counsel for the NFL that such revenues now represent over half of average team income. If one realizes that at the 
present time all teams in the league will receive more than one half of their revenues in exactly equal shares from television, and 
nearly every team in the league is able to sell out its stadium for all the league games, then it appears that the financial sinews 
for a competitive player balance have been equalized. See J.A. at 1978 (testimony of Dr. George Burman). The second factor producing competitive balance (or lack of it) is the impact of the Coach on the success or failure of the team. 
Despite the claims to ""competitive balance"" from whatever factors, it is clear that a small number of the teams have dominated 
the play-offs year after year. The record shows nine teams as occupying twenty-two out of the available twenty-four places in the 
play-offs in the 1973-1975 seasons. See 420 F. Supp. at 746, Citing N.Y. Times, 6 June 1976, at 56. These nine teams include 
teams with long records of success year after year with the same coach: (1) Dallas Cowboys with Landry; (2) Washington 
Redskins with Lombardi and Allen; (3) Minnesota Vikings with Grant; (4) Oakland Raiders with Madden; (5) Miami Dolphins with 
Shula; (6) Pittsburgh Steelers with Noll. These teams have consistently been in the play-offs and won titles, despite the fact that 
under the draft they have been getting the worst picks year after year. It would appear that the effects of fine coaching swamp 
whatever effect the draft may have on team performance. Analysis of the record of coaching changes, or lack of changes, illustrates at least two things. First, that the player draft does not 
have an equalizing effect to the extent of knocking out the top teams, if the top teams have good coaches. Second, it is certainly 
arguable that what happens to change the position of teams in the league is not a draft choice advantage, but that the losing 
teams fire the losing coaches. Our colleague argues ""(i)n only one of twelve seasons from 1964-1975 did those teams in the bottom half of the NFL's standings 
fail to win a greater number of games in the next following priority selections in the draft. Statistical analysis shows that this could 
not have been the product of chance occurring without regard to the draft."" (Dis. op. note 45). Our dissenting colleague did not 
tell us how many of the teams in the bottom half of the standings not only received the usual priority in draft selection, but also 
fired their losing coaches. Whatever statistical analysis our colleague is talking about, it is obviously worthless unless it takes 
account of the changes in the head coaches and the coaching staffs as well. The changes in position in the league effected by changes in head coaches is easily seen from the record by what happened 
after the arrival of Lombardi in Green Bay, the arrival of Lombardi and thereafter Allen at Washington, the move of Shula to the 
Miami Dolphins, and the move of Noll to the Pittsburgh Steelers. See J.A. at 658-76; Id. at 950-52, 1978-79 (testimony of Dr. 
George Burman); Id. at 904-05 (testimony of Edward Garvey); Id. at 1116-18 (testimony of Bart Starr). In each of these four 
instances teams with a long series of losing seasons, during which they had had the benefit of priority in the player draft, were 
very shortly upgraded into title contenders after the arrival of these coaches of recognized high ability. We think the trial court was eminently correct when he ""concluded that the evidence on whether the draft was essential to 
competitive balance was ""at best equivocal,' and that no correlation was demonstrated between the draft and survival in the 
league."""
1071,47, .  Brief of NFL at 9. 
1072,48," .  Defendants argue that college football players possess a significant amount of bargaining power, since they can refuse to 
sign with the team that drafted them, electing instead to sit out several seasons or to play for the Canadian Football League. The 
first alternative, however, necessitates both a considerable financial sacrifice and a potentially harmful interruption of a player's 
career. The second alternative is little better: the evidence established that the opportunities for American players in Canada are 
both limited (owing to a hiring preference for native players) and significantly less rewarding (lower salaries, fewer promotional 
opportunities, less ""glamor""). The evidence plainly supported the District Court's finding that the availability of these alternatives 
failed to furnish a player with much, if any, bargaining power in salary discussions with the drafting club."
1072,49," .   420 F. Supp. at 746. Our colleague has reinforced his own encyclopedic knowledge of football with repeated references to 
The NFL's Official Encyclopedia History of Professional Football (1977), beginning with note 3. Whatever may be the propriety of 
a trial court taking judicial notice of an ""encyclopedia"" to establish facts (and an encyclopedia whose occasional inaccuracy our 
colleague himself corrects, note 23), See McCormick's Handbook of the Law of Evidence §§ 329-31 (1972) (2d ed.), we think it 
improper and a bit unfair to ground an opinion urging reversal of the trial court's principal factual conclusions (that the evidence 
was equivocal whether the draft was essential to preserve competitive balance, and that the draft had a severely anticompetitive 
impact) on ""facts"" culled from a book appearing a year after the trial court's decision. We suggest the factual bases, and 
therefore legal validity, of the dissent is similarly flawed by reliance on personal observation (note 23) and common knowledge in 
the community (notes 51 and 69). Indeed, there are frequent references to events occurring after the oral argument in this case, E. g., O. J. Simpson's 1978 record 
(p. 29), Terry Metcalf's 1978 Canadian contract (note 69), the New York Yankees' recent success (p. 53). One man's 
reminiscences of a popular sport should not be confused with a judicial decision. HN15[

again the parallel with the argument and decision in Professional Engineers is telling. The Society argued ""that competition, in 
the form of bargaining between the engineer and customer, is allowed under its canon of ethics once an engineer has been 
initially selected. . . . It then contends that its prohibition of competitive bidding regulates only the Timing of competition, thus 
making this case analogous to Chicago Board of Trade . . . ."" The Court found this reliance on Chicago Board of Trade 
misplaced, pointing out that ""petitioner's claim mistakenly treats negotiation between a single seller and a single buyer as the 
equivalent of competition between two or more potential sellers"".  Id. at 693 n.19, 98 S. Ct. at 1366. The football player draft

1076,76," .  Pat Fischer, like plaintiff, was a defensive back who signed with the Redskins in 1968. Although Fischer was a seasoned 
player, it cannot be said that Smith, an All-American first-round draft choice, was demonstrably out of Fischer's league. A very 
rough index of the two players' comparability was furnished by the NFL Commissioner's refusal, in a 1968 Rozelle Rule 
transaction, to award Smith as ""compensation"" to Fischer's former team. See 420 F. Supp. at 749 & note 6 Supra. Putting to one 
side the murky question of how ""bonuses"" are to be allocated, see 420 F. Supp. at 749 n.9, Smith's actual one-year 
compensation ($ 28,000 ""bonus"" plus $ 22,000 salary) and Fischer's annualized one-year compensation ($ 24,000 ""bonus"" plus 
$ 30,000 salary) are not too far apart anyway. The trial judge was obliged to find Some guideline to Smith's hypothetical 
compensation under conditions more nearly approximating a free market. He came up with a player who played a defensive 
position similar to plaintiff's and signed as a ""free agent"" with the same team in the same year. Bearing in mind ""the familiar rule 
that HN19[
] a wrongdoer is responsible for uncertainty in calculating the damages proximately caused by his own 
wrongdoing,"" Lehrman v. Gulf Oil Corp., 464 F.2d 26, 45 (5th Cir.), Cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1077, 93 S. Ct. 687, 34 L. Ed. 2d 665 
(1972), we cannot say that the trial judge's comparison was unreasonable."
1076,77," .  The District Court's findings on this score are contained in 420 F. Supp. at 748: The evidence showed unequivocally that top players at that time were being offered long-term contracts by some teams, 
including at times the Redskins. The Court concludes that a player of plaintiff's talent would certainly have been able to negotiate 
a three-year contract on very favorable terms in the absence of the restraints imposed by the owners. The evidence also showed "
1077,," that such players were able to negotiate contracts which guaranteed payment for the full term of the contract even if the player 
were injured (""fully vested contract"" or ""injury protection clause""). On the basis of the evidence of the contracts being negotiated 
at times elsewhere in the league and by the Redskins during the relevant period, and considering that such protection was 
shown to be of great concern to players of plaintiff's caliber, the Court also concludes that plaintiff would have been able to 
include such injury protection in a long-term contract had it not been for the illegal restraints imposed upon him. Numerous, references appear in the record to so-called ""no-cut"" contracts, which were frequently negotiated in the league. It is 
apparently undisputed, however, that such contracts did not guarantee salary payments, in the event of debilitating injury, 
beyond the year in which the injury occurred. See Brief of Pro-Football, Inc. at 22. Additionally, the record contains references to 
several multi-year player contracts from which the player's warranty of ""excellent physical condition"" was excised. Again it 
appears that the provision does not assure salary payments, in the event of injury, over the full course of the contract period. 
Characterizing two such contracts, plaintiff stated that the salary would be paid ""as long as (the player) was physically fit."" See 
Brief of Appellee Smith at 7a (contract of Bill Yearby); Id. at 9a (contract of Carl McAdams). Whether this is a sensible 
construction of such language is, needless to say, not before us. So interpreted, however, the contracts plainly do not support 
the judge's finding that Smith, absent the draft, would have been able to negotiate a contract guaranteeing three years' salary, 
regardless of injury. Although we set aside the trial court's damage award insofar as it depends on a conjectural guarantee of three years' salary, 
regardless of injury, we do not intend otherwise to circumscribe on remand the trial court's discretion in computing plaintiff's 
damages. We do in passing note with approval the approach taken by Judge Bryant at trial, See 420 F. Supp. at 749 n.9, in 
ignoring arguable distinctions between salary and bonus for purposes of measuring overall player compensation. In this regard, 
setting aside a particular item of damages which we think to be without support, we intimate no view on the overall 
reasonableness of the damage award apart from the particular theory on which it was made. "
1078,1," .  The principal Supreme Court decisions on the application of the antitrust laws to sports started in 1922 with Federal Baseball 
Club v. National League, 259 U.S. 200, 42 S. Ct. 465, 66 L. Ed. 898 (1922). In that case, Justice Holmes, speaking for a 
unanimous Court, ruled that the business of giving baseball exhibitions for profit ""would not be called trade or commerce in the 
commonly accepted use of those words"" and hence the league's acts ""were not interference with commerce among the States."" 
259 U.S. at 209, 42 S. Ct. at 466. Over the years, baseball was subject to intermittent antitrust attack, but courts rejected these 
challenges on the authority of Federal Baseball. Flood v. Kuhn, 407 U.S. 258, 272, 92 S. Ct. 2099, 32 L. Ed. 2d 728 (1972). The 
Court was asked to reconsider its ruling that the business of providing baseball games for profit was not within the scope of the 
federal antitrust laws in Toolson v. New York Yankees, 346 U.S. 356, 74 S. Ct. 78, 98 L. Ed. 64 (1953). Without examining the 
""underlying issues,"" the Court reaffirmed the result in Federal Baseball, referring to four reasons for that holding: (1) 
Congressional awareness of and inaction with respect to Federal Baseball ; (2) baseball's development on the understanding 
that it was not subject to existing federal antitrust laws; (3) a reluctance to overrule Federal Baseball with a consequent 
retroactive effect; (4) a professed desire that any remedy be supplied by Congress rather than by court decision.  346 U.S. at 
357, 74 S. Ct. 78, 98 L. Ed. 64. The meaning of Toolson was discussed by Chief Justice Warren in United States v. Shubert, 348 
U.S. 222, 228-30, 75 S. Ct. 277, 99 L. Ed. 279 (1955). United States v. International Boxing Club, 348 U.S. 236, 75 S. Ct. 259, 
99 L. Ed. 290 (1955), was a companion case to Shubert and was decided the same day. This case applied the principles 
developed in Federal Baseball and Toolson, and did not find an antitrust exemption for boxing, 348 U.S. at 243, 75 S. Ct. 259, 
99 L. Ed. 290. Radovich v. National Football League, 352 U.S. 445, 77 S. Ct. 390, 1 L. Ed. 2d 456 (1957), was a civil Clayton Act case for 
damages allegedly suffered by blacklisting the plaintiff for signing with another professional football league in violation of the 
standard player contract. The Court limited the reach of Federal Baseball to the sport of baseball, and held that football was 
subject to the federal antitrust laws. 352 U.S. at 451, 77 S. Ct. 390, 1 L. Ed. 2d 456. That baseball was exempt from the antitrust 
laws was reaffirmed in Flood, supra, 407 U.S. at 285, 92 S. Ct. 2099, but the Court also stated that ""(o)ther professional sports 
operating interstate football, boxing, basketball, and, presumably, hockey and golf are not so exempt."" 407 U.S. at 282-83, 92 S. 
Ct. at 2112. Justice Douglas, in his capacity as Circuit Justice, reinstated a district court's injunction Pendente lite in favor of a 
professional basketball player and stated that ""(basketball) . . . does not enjoy exemption from the antitrust laws."" Haywood v. 
National Basketball Association, 401 U.S. 1204, 1205, 91 S. Ct. 672, 673, 28 L. Ed. 2d 206 (1971). It is clear that the business of giving football exhibitions for profit is not exempt from the reach of the federal antitrust laws. No

of whether the Topco rule will survive the continuing erosion in the Per se rule, it is not immediately apparent how the majority 
would distinguish these cases. Since I conclude that the draft is essential to the NFL's ability to produce the product it offers to

1081,17," .  NFL teams are economic competitors on the playing field in the sense that each team is competing against all of its 
opponents for the large economic benefits that go with the playoff and eventually are paid to the winner of the Super Bowl. This 
competition to create a Super Bowl winner also has an economic base in that most, if not all, of the teams devote practically all 
their income to hire the best players in an effort to get into the playoffs. See J.A. 617-18. In so doing, the teams establish Market 
prices for players' services that other teams must match, lest they risk serious morale problems with their own teams. These 
could be self-destructive since the success of a football team is largely dependent upon the morale of the players. J.A. 1411, 
1844-45. The playing field rivalry between teams thus results in the teams being indirectly required to compete on a reasonably 
equal basis with the economic benefits being paid by other teams, even if it takes practically all of their income. If an NFL team 
today tried to operate on a strict business basis and maximize profits, it is suggested that the team would revolt and local 
support would dwindle. The ""large economic benefits"" referred to above for post-season play are as follows: for each post-season game, a player gets 
1/14 of his salary from the team. With a salary of $ 31,000, this amount would be about $ 2,000 a game. J.A. 925. In addition, $ 
8,500 is paid by the League for playing in a conference championship game and $ 15,000 by the League for winning the Super 
Bowl. J.A. 926-27. The testimony did not reflect the amount the losers receive. A squad of 43 players that won the Super Bowl 
would receive total post-season play compensation of $ 1,290,000, with approximately $ 30,000 going to each team member. 
The other teams also receive substantial compensation. The foregoing figures were apparently related to the collective 
bargaining contract and League compensation around 1970. It is assumed that the 1968 situation was substantially comparable; 
otherwise, the evidence would have been irrelevant. "

Trade Commission Act, as amended (38 Stat. 717), shall not apply to any joint agreement by or among persons engaging in or 
conducting the organized professional team sports of football, baseball, basketball, or hockey, by which any league of clubs 
participating in professional football, baseball, basketball, or hockey contests sells or otherwise transfers all or any part of the 
rights of such league's member clubs in the sponsored telecasting of the games of football, baseball, basketball, or hockey, as 
the case may be, engaged in or conducted by such clubs. September 30, 1961 (75 Stat. 732); 15 U.S.C. § 1291. The antitrust limitations were also waived in 1966 by Congress to permit the merger of the National and American Football 
Leagues. Pub.L.No.89-900, Nov. 8, 1966, 80 Stat. 1515. Specifically the Act of November 8, 1966 provides: In addition, such (anti-trust) laws shall not apply to a joint agreement by which the member clubs of two or more professional 
football leagues, which are exempt from income tax under section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 USCS § 
501(c)(6)), combine their operations in expanded single league so exempt from income tax, if such agreement increases rather 
than decreases the number of professional football clubs so operating, and the provisions of which are directly relevant thereto."

both existing leagues faced dissolution or transfer to other cities. . . . The merger will improve player strength and financial

1085,35," .  J.A. 422, 618. The majority in footnote 46 assert that competitive balance is produced today by equal sharing of television 
revenues and by the impact of the Coach. This of course ignores the historical fact, which we are to consider in applying the rule 
of reason, that the achievement of competitive balance was the purpose of the draft, and that this produced the exciting games 
throughout the league, that led to the original television contracts and to the increased revenues therefrom. Moreover, the equal 
sharing of television revenues would not overcome the unlimited financial resources that a few owners are able and willing to 
make available to produce a winning team. As to coaches, the majority seek to attack the Fact that losing teams almost invariably improved their record with players from 
the succeeding draft, by arguing that firing of ""losing coaches"" may have been the cause. Naturally some coaches are better 
than others but the record does not indicate that coaching changes exceed draft results as a factor in producing the 
improvement in the record of losing teams. Of the Twenty-Three ""Winningest coaches"" in Pro-football history 15 moved to other 
teams and only two, Shula and Allen, had winning records with the new team. This excludes Lombardi who was only one year at 
Washington and had a record of 7 wins, 5 losses and 2 ties. Encyc. p. 452. Thus, a new coach is no panacea. Also coaching in 
the NFL today is not a one man job staffs are enormous and the movement of a head coach may not be the critical element. "
1086,," Coaches can make their contribution but in the last analysis the game is played by the players and not even a court should try to 
deny that fact. When it does, its position is obviously untenable. As for the majority's statement that the draft did not produce until the 50's and then television did the job, this again is a near-
sighted approach and evaluation that blinds itself to the fact that it is the game on the field that is being sold. The statistics 
indicate that paid attendance at professional games has Regularly increased steadily to 11,044,018 in 1976, Encyc., p. 437, as 
the number of league teams has increased from 9 to 28 and their competitive balance has spread throughout the United States. 
Also 17 of the stadiums presently in use were built, occupied by new teams, or substantially enlarged to their present capacity in 
the last 10 years. Encyc., pp. 454-463. The organization of new teams and the building of huge stadiums have Combined with

1969. In 1969 and 1970, Simpson was something of a disappointment because of weaknesses in the Bills' offensive line (J.A.

2003 yards and interest in the team skyrocketed. In 1976, he gained 1503 yards. A new stadium was built in 1973 and a sell-out 
crowd of 80,000 watched the first game in it. None of this success occurred until Buffalo used its early draft choices to select 
outstanding linemen. Simpson was eventually to sign a three-year contract for over two million dollars (Encyc., at 103). It is hard 
to find a better example to disprove the theory that a few so-called ""stars"" can make a team a winner. Other similar examples 
can be pointed to by any sports follower. The majority object to the use of the Encyclopedia published in 1976 because this case was tried before that date. However, the 
Facts occurred before the trial, were well known, and were referred to in the testimony (J.A. 1831-32). "

1092,55," .  See Engineers, supra, 435 U.S. at 694, 98 S. Ct. at 1367: ""The Sherman Act does not require competitive bidding; it prohibits 
unreasonable restraints on competition."" This case is distinguishable from Engineers in one material respect. Engineers imposed 
an anticompetitive restraint because of the claim that it was necessary to avoid a safety risk to the public. This claim was found 
to be unfounded. Here the restraint is to preserve maximum competitive equality and while the majority differs with the degree 
that the draft contributes to this there is no disagreement that the draft does make a substantial contribution to competitive 
equality and the quality of the overall team product that is a vital factor in keeping all the league teams strong and viable and an 
inducement for the organization of other teams and other leagues. "
1093,56," .  In Engineers, the facts that competitive bidding might decrease the quality of the product, or that the public safety might be 
impaired, were not relevant in testing the reasonableness of the restraint.  435 U.S. at 693, 98 S. Ct. 1355, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637."
1093,57," .  In Engineers, there was no suggestion that the ban on competitive bidding contributed to the vitality of the profession or that 
the ban was in any way essential to the existence of the profession. Here such testimony is not contradicted. J.A. 1769, 1772, 
1794, 1826. "
1095,58," .  A case in which a similar approach was used is Deesen v. Professional Golfers' Association, 358 F.2d 165 (9th Cir.), Cert. 
denied, 385 U.S. 846, 87 S. Ct. 72, 17 L. Ed. 2d 76 (1966). In that case, plaintiff complained that the PGA and its members had 
combined and conspired to monopolize the business of tournament golf in violation of the Sherman Act. Deeson could not 
satisfy the requirements to become an approved tournament player, and he challenged the PGA entry rules on several grounds. 
The rules were restraints of trade: PGA members combined to keep out of the business those individuals who could not meet 
their standards. It was an absolute restraint on those with high scores, and there was no competition encouraged between 
members of the PGA who had met the requirements and those who could not. Yet the restraint did improve the quality of the 
product of tournament golf and in fact made the business of golf viable. That would have the ultimate effect of encouraging 
others to join the business; theoretically, those effects might encourage other golf associations to be established. The court in 
Deeson explained its approach in this way: It is true that generally speaking, any association that undertakes to sponsor a contest of any kind has power to exclude any 
applicant for any reason whatsoever, unless such power is curtailed by operation of law. The pertinent inquiry, however, is 
whether an association Intends to use that power in a manner which tends to suppress or destroy competition. Mere size, unaccompanied by unlawful intent or conduct in the exercise of the power gained through size, does not constitute a 
violation of section 2 of the Sherman Act. . . . It is the existence of monopoly power Coupled with the intent to use it for 
anticompetitive purposes or with inevitable anticompetitive effects that establishes the offense of monopolization.  United States 
v. Griffith, 334 U.S. 100, 107, 68 S. Ct. 941, 92 L. Ed. 1236. No finding nor evidence has been called to our attention which indicates that PGA Has used, or intends to use, its position as the 
sponsor or co-sponsor of a substantial number of tournaments to preclude sponsorship of tournaments to others, to exclude 
golfers from access to PGA sponsored tournaments, or To suppress or eliminate competition in professional tournament golf. According to the evidence before us, PGA's creation of the category of approved tournament player Tends to promote 
competition by facilitating participation by proficient younger players. According to the evidence, PGA has also sought To 
stimulate competition by giving official recognition to many tournaments which it neither sponsors nor co-sponsors. . . . we hold 
that the trial court did not err in finding and concluding that PGA did not use its power in a way which is violative of section 2 of 
the Sherman Act."
1095,358," F.2d at 171 (emphasis added). Although the PGA rules, like the draft, absolutely prohibited competition at one level, the 
rules were viewed as an ultimate benefit to competition by ensuring the vitality of the product, as was the case in Mitchel. See also Hatley v. American Quarter Horse Association, 552 F.2d 646, 654 (5th Cir. 1977) (""When the nature of the industry 
requires some limitations upon entrance, Section 2 is not violated"")."
1095,59," .  Part IV of this opinion concludes that even if the draft is a violation of the antitrust laws, Smith suffered no damages and the 
cases should be dismissed. It should be noted that a finding of no damages, if reached first, eliminates the need to test the 
validity of the draft for purposes of this case, as a finding of no damages effectively moots the antitrust violation issue involved. 
See Kapp v. National Football League, 586 F.2d 644 at 649 (9th Cir. 1978). See also text accompanying note 83 Infra (finding of 
no antitrust violation effectively moots the damages issue)."

Any effect on . . . (competitive balance) . . ."" J.A. 910. He further testified that the talent gravitated to the ""city where it is most 
valuable . . ."" To his mind the Absence of restrictions on redistributing talent among the teams ""according to their value to the 
team"" the freedom that exists for talent to be moved after the draft resulted in the draft failing to have ""any effect"" on competitive 
balance. This testimony destroys the theory of plaintiff's case that the draft ""actually"" compels the player to sign with the team 
that drafts him. In this respect, the testimony is correct, the draftee is not hide bound to the team that selects him, but the 
conclusion that the expert and the majority draw therefrom that the draft does not have ""any effect"" on competitive balance is 
incorrect. In the past players have not moved all that frequently and the testimony that the development of the strength of 
winning teams in the league was Based on the draft (J.A. 1406 (Bengals); 1715 (Broncos); 1849 (Dallas)), indicates that the 
""experts' "" opinion is unsupported by the factual testimony. Part of this argument also overlooks the fact that the movement of 
players from team to team most frequently involves trading players And draft choices. Cf. Maj. Op. n.46."

unrelated business opportunities, (2) racial discrimination, (3) general community atmosphere, (4) preference for league, (5) 
dispute with owner, (6) climate, (7) educational opportunities, (8) disagreement with coaching staff, (9) disagreement with 
management. Maj. Op., p.  -- - of  -- - U.S.App.D.C., at 1183 of 593 F.2d. And to this can be added a player's personal 
preference for a city or area in proximity to his residence or to the college where he played, and his possible objection to the 
quality (winning record or prospect thereof) of the team that drafted him. Each of these circumstances can be a factor in a player 
moving to a team after he has signed a contract and can more easily be a factor in his signing initially with some team other than 
the one that drafted him."

Actually, such recent facts are merely duplicative of facts already in the trial record. The invalidity of a court's prior factual 
assumptions that are predictive of future consequences may be demonstrated by pointing out that the results were different than 
was predicted; and the fact that some of these results occurred after the court's decision does not prevent their use. In fact,

had the effect of affirming the jury's verdict, which found that Kapp was not damaged by the ""illegal restraint,"" at 647-648, the 
court did not reach the question raised by the NFL's cross-appeal whether the district court's holding that the various rules 
violated the antitrust laws was in error. By affirming the jury verdict, the court eliminated the possibility that the NFL might suffer; 
accordingly, the cross-appeal was declared moot and dismissed. At 649-650. "

1123,37," Section 210.62 provides: s 210.62 Normal business practices. (a) Suppliers will deal with purchasers of an allocated product according to normal business practices in effect during the base 
period specified in Part 211 for that allocated product, and no supplier may modify any normal business practice so as to result 
in the circumvention of any provision of this chapter. ""Summer fill"" programs and other ""dating"" or seasonal credit programs are 
among the normal business practices which must be maintained by a supplier under this paragraph, if that supplier had such 
programs in effect during the base period. Credit terms other than those associated with seasonal credit programs are included 
as a part of the May 15, 1973 price charged to a class of purchaser under Part 212 of this Chapter. Nothing in this paragraph 
shall be construed to require suppliers to sell to purchasers who do not arrange proper credit or payments for allocated products, 
as customarily associated with that class of purchaser during the base period (for seasonal credit), or on May 15, 1973 (for other 
credit terms). However, no supplier may require or impose more stringent credit terms or payment schedules on purchasers than 
those in effect for that class of purchaser during the base period (for seasonal credit), or on May 15, 1973 (for credit terms). (b) No supplier shall engage in any form of discrimination among purchasers of any allocated product. For purposes of this 
paragraph, ""discrimination"" means extending any preference or sales treatment which has the effect of frustrating or impairing 
the objectives, purposes and intent of this chapter or of the Act, and includes, but is not limited to refusal by a retail marketer of 
motor gasoline or diesel fuel to furnish or sell any allocated product due to the absence of a prior selling relationship with the "
1124,," purchaser, or establishment of new volume purchase arrangements where customers of retailers agree in advance to purchase 
in excess of normal amounts of motor gasoline or diesel fuel and thereby receive preferential treatment. (c) Any practice which constitutes a means to obtain a price higher than is permitted by the regulations in this chapter to impose 
terms or conditions not customarily imposed upon the sale of an allocated product is a violation of these regulations. Such 
practices include, but are not limited to devices making use of inducements, commissions, kickbacks, retroactive increases, 
transportation arrangements, premiums, discounts, special privileges, tie-in agreements, trade understandings, falsification of 
records, substitution of inferior commodities or failure to provide the same services and equipment previously sold. "
1125,38," For reasons already stated, § 210.62 does not confer antitrust immunity. "
1126,39," Activities which come under the jurisdiction of a regulatory agency nevertheless may be subject to scrutiny under the antitrust 
laws. E. g., Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., 428 U.S. 579, 596-97 & n.36, 96 S. Ct. 3110, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1141 (1976); Otter Tail

1126,40," Gasco also contends that the activities alleged in these paragraphs and in paragraphs 22(a), 22(d), 22(m), 34 and 38 involve 
credit terms which are regulated by § 210.62(a) and FEA Ruling 1974-10, 39 Fed.Reg. 15, 140 (May 1, 1974), Reprinted in 10

such allegedly intentionally anticompetitive activity."

1130,48," On May 11, 1977, OGS applied to the FEA for exception relief, requesting that its base period use of propane be increased 
from 208,333 gallons per month to 425,000 gallons per month. On August 7, 1977, the Region IX Office of Exceptions and Appeals issued a decision and Order denying OGS's request for 
relief. On September 13, 1977, OGS filed an appeal (FEA-1469) from the adverse decision with the appropriate administrative appeals 
body, the Office of Hearings and Appeals. In January and February of 1978, Gasco attempted to obtain by means of a Freedom of Information Act (""FOIA"") request upon 
the FEA, materials submitted by OGS to the agency in an ex parte hearing. Gasco also sought a stay, pending action its FOIA 
request. On February 7, 1978, Gasco's requests were denied by the agency. On February 13, 1978, Gasco filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (C78-0333 
WWS), to restrain the progress of the administrative hearings and to obtain the materials earlier sought through the FOIA 
request. On April 10, 1978, the District Court in the Northern District of California denied OGS's requested relief. On September 20, 1978, the Office of Hearings and Appeals denied OGS's appeal and affirmed the August 7, 1977 Decision 
and Order of the Region IX Office of Exceptions and Appeals. However, the Office of Hearings and Appeals did grant OGS 
partial relief in the form of an allowable price increase of five cents per gallon for propane sold in Hawaii, from September 20, 
1978 through November 30, 1980. It is noteworthy that the Office of Hearings and Appeals ordered an audit and investigation of Gasco's operations to determine 
the validity of certain of its statements relating to pricing. Decision and Order of the Department of Energy, Case No. FEA-1469

1132,49," I am aware that in Franchise Realty Interstate Corp. v. San Francisco Local Joint Executive Board of Culinary Workers 
(""Franchise Realty""), 542 F.2d 1076 (9th Cir. 1976), Cert. denied 430 U.S. 940, 97 S. Ct. 1090, 51 L. Ed. 2d 787 (1977), the 
Ninth Circuit held that activities of a restaurant employer association and labor union, consisting of attempts to lobby and petition 
a governmental body in opposition to the granting of permits by a municipal board to the plaintiff for operation of restaurants in 
the city, did not violate the Sherman Act, even though the purpose of opposition was to eliminate competition. In that case, 
however, the alleged activities of the defendants consisted entirely of attempts to lobby and petition a governmental body which 
was characterized by the Court as ""as much a political as an adjudicatory body."" Id. at 1079. Furthermore, in Franchise Realty 
the plaintiffs' complaint failed to allege specific activities, not protected by Noerr, which barred plaintiffs' access to a 
governmental body.  Id. at 1082. In the present case, OGS has alleged that Gasco has made misrepresentations before the FEA, an adjudicatory body, including 
the specific allegation that Gasco has misrepresented the true price at which Gasco obtained foreign LP-gas. If proven, these 
activities seem to constitute exactly the type of unethical conduct condemned by Justice Douglas in Pennington. 404 U.S. at 
512-13, 92 S. Ct. 609. "

1137,*," Judge Philip Nichols, Jr., of the United States Court of Claims is sitting by designation. "
1150,1," While the parties are agreed that the respondent had the authority to license the use of pole space to users such as the 
appellants, that authority is not expressly conferred in the act.  It can be inferred from the language of RCW 54.16.040.  
However, there are statutory restrictions upon the power of a district to sell or lease its property.  See RCW 54.16.180."
1150,2," The object of municipal ownership is to give the citizen the best possible service at the lowest possible price.  Uhler v. 
Olympia, 87 Wash. 1, 151 P. 117, 152 P. 998 (1915). The control which is exercised by those in charge of a public utility district 
must be for the benefit of the users of the electricity.  Carstens v. PUD 1, 8 Wn.2d 136, 111 P.2d 583 (1941). "
1153,3," 15 U.S.C. §§ 1, 2, and 13 (1976) were cited to the court below as the statutes upon which these federal law defenses were 
based. "
1154,4," Notably absent was any allegation that the respondent discriminated in favor of other users of its own poles. The respondent's 
uncontroverted affidavits showed that it licensed pole space to 22 additional users, all of whom were charged and paid the same 
rates. "
1158,1," .  The class of airplanes consisting of all aircraft other than those made for commercial airlines and the military is categorized as 
""general aviation aircraft."""
1158,2," .  Avionics includes communication, navigation, and guidance equipment."
1158,3," .  Henceforth, all references to airplanes or aircraft shall be understood as referring to multi-engine craft only."
1158,4," .  It appears that there have been two exceptions to this general marketing practice.  Specifically, Cessna seems to market its 
model 441 jet-prop and its Citation jet as packaged craft only.  However, the 441 jet-prop was not sold to dealers until after 
Fontana was in the process of liquidation, and the Citation jet is only sold directly by Cessna to consumer/users."
1158,5," .  Plaintiff also maintains that Cessna's avionics were ""less sophisticated and of inferior quality"" to those manufactured by its 
competitors. "
1159,6," .  It is not alleged that the resulting cost/price of ARCD produced avionics is predatory.  In fact, according to undisputed figures, 
although the cost of competitive suppliers' avionics increased as Cessna's products' cost was decreasing, Cessna's avionics 
remained more expensive than King's and Bendix's, at least in the 1976 model year."
1159,7," .  In their Preliminary Motion, defendants originally asked for summary judgment on the additional ground that ""(CFC's) 
suspension of financing of avionics not manufactured by Cessna's ARC division does not state a claim for relief under the 
antitrust laws."" Plaintiff responded to this portion of defendants' Motion by saying that it was not alleging that the facts 
surrounding the financing cutoff constitute a tie-in barred by 15 U.S.C. §§ 1, 14. With regard to the pleadings in this cause the court notes that while there may be legitimate reasons why, on occasion, a 
complaint in an antitrust case may have to be broadly drawn, 2 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law § 317 (1978), this matter 
was not advanced by the failure of the plaintiff in the instant case to segregate or otherwise identify the various claims lodged in 
Count I, or to distinguish between the ""overt acts"" and the actions claimed to be themselves illegal in Counts I and II of its 
Complaint. The court further notes that while defendants' briefs filed in support of this Motion were generally helpful in considering the 
issues presently before it, the court would have preferred to have received such pleadings without certain of the more caustic 
remarks contained therein.  (See, e.g., Reply Brief, note at p. 20). "
1160,8," .  It is not completely clear whether plaintiff means to allege that ARCD avionics equipment is the tied product, or whether the 
tie-in is claimed to involve the installation of avionics equipment (a broader range of products), the installation of avionics 
equipment (a tied service), or the installation and sales of (ARCD or general) avionics equipment (a tied product plus a tied 
service).  Fontana seemingly adopts each of these interpretations of its cause of action at different points in its briefs.  While it 
should be noted that section 3 of the Clayton Act is inapplicable to tie-ins involving services, United States v. Jerrold Electronics 
Corp., 187 F. Supp. 545, 554 (E.D.Pa.1960), Aff'd per curiam, 365 U.S. 567, 81 S. Ct. 755, 5 L. Ed. 2d 806 (1961); Advance 
Business Systems & Supply Co. v. SCM Corp., 415 F.2d 55, 61 (4th Cir. 1969), Cert. denied, 397 U.S. 920, 90 S. Ct. 928, 25 L. 
Ed. 2d 101 (1970), the court's disposition of the instant Motion does not turn on its precise characterization of the item(s) the 
purchase of which is said to be tied to the purchase of Cessna multi-engine planes. However, the gravamen of Fontana's charge 
is that, owing to Cessna's adoption of CMP, Cessna's price scheme is forcing its retailers to buy planes with factory-installed 
ARCD avionics. Therefore, the installation and sale of ARCD avionics equipment will be referred to as the tied product although 
it encompasses a tied service as well throughout this opinion. "
1161,9," .  Thus, according to the ""definitive"" summary of its cause of action contained in its Supplemental Memorandum in opposition to 
the instant Motion, Fontana does not challenge Cessna's marketing policies with regard to its model 441 jet-prop and its Citation 
jet as illegal tie-ins. The court regards this interpretation of plaintiff's own Complaint, from which Fontana has nowhere deviated, 
as authoritative."
1161,10," .  Fontana does not allege that a tie-in existed with regard to any other type of Cessna aircraft. See note 9, Supra."
1161,11," .  In Northern Pacific Ry. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 78 S. Ct. 514, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1958), the Supreme Court remarked that 
""where the buyer is free to take either product by itself there is no tying problem even though the seller may also offer the two 
items as a unit at a single price."" Id. at 6, n. 4, 78 S. Ct. at 518. Upon investigation, this court has discovered but a single case in 
which an illegal tie-in was found to exist despite the availability of the tying and tied items on an individual basis.  Advance 
Business Systems & Supply Co. v. SCM Corp., 415 F.2d 55 (4th Cir. 1969), Cert. denied, 397 U.S. 920, 90 S. Ct. 928, 25 L. Ed. 
2d 101 (1970). But in that case, the court appears to have been motivated by its perception that the claimed separate availability 
of rented SCM Model 55 copiers and the supplies employed in operating them was entirely theoretical.  415 F.2d at 61-62. 
However, it is undisputed that, in this case, the tying products were in fact offered for sale to, and purchased by, Cessna dealers 
without the tied product throughout the relevant time period.  Therefore, the court considers the ruling of Advance Business 
Systems to be inapplicable under the circumstances of the instant case, and follows the dictum of Northern Pacific, the rationale 
of which underlies the holding of the Court of Appeals in Sargent-Welch.  See Sargent-Welch Scientific Co. v. Ventron Corp., 
567 F.2d at 708. Consequently, the court holds that the pricing policy adopted by Cessna does not constitute a tie-in in violation 
of the federal antitrust laws."
1161,12," .  The court takes note of the fact that this issue was raised, in passing, in defendant's Reply and Supplemental briefs on this 
Motion."
1161,13," .  It is unclear what other section 2 claims, if any, plaintiff means to raise in Count I of its Complaint.  Cf. n.7, Supra.  However, 
in light of the court's disposition of its attempt claim, the presence or absence of any additional theoretical bases for this action 
under section 2 would be immaterial at this time. "
1162,14, .  The cases cited in this regard by Fontana in its Memorandum in Opposition are inapposite.
1162,15," .  Throughout its briefs on this Motion, Fontana has adhered to the market definition proposed in its Complaint."
1162,16," .  Although this is actually a product market and a service market, the court will refer to it merely as ""the product market."" "
1163,17," .  In his affidavit, Cessna's Senior Vice-President-Commercial Aircraft Marketing Division avers that ""other"" aircraft 
manufacturers allow their dealers ""to install various brands of competing avionics in various competing models of aircraft."" He 
also swears that they ""likewise factory install avionics manufactured by a variety of avionics manufacturers."" This testimony 
stands uncontradicted."
1163,18," .  Indeed, neither party even brought this portion of Mark Fontana's deposition to the attention of the court."
1163,19," .  The court can not really fault defendants for their failure to bring this evidence to its attention.  Fontana has not, in its briefs or 
in its affidavit, adduced one fact in support of its proposed product market definition.  Nor does it allege any such fact in its 
Complaint.  (This court has not been called upon to review the sufficiency of the Complaint in this regard.) This court considers that plaintiff's omissions in this regard can only have been the result of an oversight on its part.  After 
defendants' Motion had been fully briefed, and accompanying affidavits had been filed, the court, in a Memorandum Opinion 
dated March 6, 1978, requested the filing of additional briefs and affidavits concerning four issues.  One of those issues was the 
question of the appropriate market definition for plaintiff's section 2 claim.  No further affidavits were forthcoming from either 
party, and plaintiff, in its Supplemental Memorandum, merely asserted that its ""relevant market definition flows directly from such 
factors as are set forth in Sargent-Welch."""
1163,20," .  While it may be true that a retail customer could buy a new, unequipped airplane from a Cessna dealer, go elsewhere to 
obtain avionics, and have them installed by people who are not employees of the Cessna dealer who sold him the plane, there is 
no claim on the record that that actually does happen.  Rather, it appears that consumers go to a dealer to buy an operational i. 
e., fully equipped aircraft, and that that is what they do, in fact purchase.  As was stressed by the court in Sargent-Welch, such 
real-world consumer conduct is of critical importance in fashioning appropriate product market definitions. "
1164,21," .   Heatransfer Corp. v. Volkswagenwerk, 553 F.2d 964 (5th Cir. 1977), upon which plaintiff bases its argument, is also 
inapposite.  In that case, a jury determination that ""the manufacture and sale of air conditioners for only Volkswagen, Porche and 
Audi automobiles throughout the world,"" Id. at 970, n.1, constituted a cognizable product market in an action under section 2 was 
upheld by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.  The court held that the jury's finding was supported by evidence showing that four 
companies produced air-conditioning units almost exclusively for VWoA (Volkswagen of America, Inc.) import cars, concentrating on this 
market because of the distinct engineering problems associated with the Volkswagen imports.  Further, up until time of trial in 
this case, these four competitors were the sole suppliers of air-conditioners for VWoA. Id. at 980. No such allegations have been made in this case, and plaintiff's proposed product market definition is based on a 
wholly different theory of ""uniqueness"" from that employed in Heatransfer."
1164,22," .  In Telex, the restrictive market definition was approved by the district court.  Telex Corp. v. IBM Corp., 367 F. Supp. 258 
(1973). However, that determination was reversed on appeal. "
1165,23," .  Accordingly, the court does not pass upon defendants' claim that plaintiff's damage claim is also barred by Brunswick Corp. v. 
Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 97 S. Ct. 690, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977)."
1165,24," .  Once again, the court must acknowledge that the ambiguity of plaintiff's Complaint has made the court's disposition of this 
Motion more difficult than it might otherwise have been.  But, in light of the insight into plaintiff's cause of action provided by, 
Inter alia, its briefs in opposition to the instant Motion, the court has no doubt as to the correctness of its construction of plaintiff's 
Complaint.  Of course, should plaintiff wish to allege that its losses were actually occasioned by other actions undertaken by 
defendants in violation of section 2, it is free to seek leave to file an Amended Complaint."
1165,25," .  Therefore, plaintiff's case does not come within the ""cost-plus contract"" exception to the rule of Illinois Brick.  See, 431 U.S. at 
735-736, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707. "
1166,26," .  As plaintiff seeks to hold it liable, in Count I, solely by virtue of its alleged co-conspirator status, it is obvious that Illinois Brick 
also bars the recovery of damages from CFC on account of the alleged violation of section 2."
1166,27," .  Since the legal injury that plaintiff appears to be claiming to have incurred as a result of the conspirators' alleged section 7 
violation also flows from Cessna's pricing policy, Illinois Brick commands that the court grant summary judgment for defendants 
on that damage claim, as well. Having disposed of defendants' motion on this basis, the court finds it unnecessary to consider the applicability of Brunswick 
Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 97 S. Ct. 690, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977) to the facts of this case."
1166,28," .  Plaintiff charges this conspiracy, the parties to which are not identical to those named in Count I, with, Inter alia, vertical 
integration, price stabilization, and the imposition of geographic restrictions on sales by Cessna distributors and dealers."
1166,29," .  Defendants have not directly challenged plaintiff's right to sue for equitable relief from the claimed violations of section 1 
(Count II conspiracy), 2, and 7 under 15 U.S.C. § 26. "
1169,1," As amended by Robinson-Patman Act of June 19, 1936, Ch. 592, 49 Stat. 1526. "
1170,2," Section 4 provides: ""Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue

respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover three-fold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of the suit, 
including a reasonable attorney's fee."" 15 U.S.C.  § 15. "
1171,3," The Court finds little support for the arguments raised by plaintiffs' in their opposing memorandum (doc. 117) against this result.  
Although plaintiffs attempt to draw a distinction between a supplier of raw materials and a supplier of finished goods (opposing 
memo, 15-16, 18-23), the Supreme Court in Illinois Brick expressly rejected this distinction.  431 U.S. at 743-45; accord, id. at 
735-36 + n. 15.  Parkview's status as a cooperative corporation does not enable it to bring an antitrust action against Kroger, 
even though its injury is indirect.  Courts have been uniform in holding that HN2[
] a cooperative corporation cannot maintain a 
treble damages action for antitrust violations against its members.  Farmers Co-Op Oil Co. v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 113 F. 2d 
101 (8th Cir. 1942); Alabama Independent Serv. Station Ass'n v. Shell Petroleum Corp., 28 F. Supp. 386, 390 (N.D. Ala. 1939); 
accord Northern Cal. Monument Dealers Ass'n v. Interment Assn. of Cal., 120 F. Supp. 93, 94 (D. Cal. 1954); cf. Fed. R. Civ. P. 
17(a) (""Every action shall be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest."").  Finally, although this Court recognizes the 
persuasiveness of the argument by Professors Areeda and Turner that a manufacturer selling through a dealer should have 
standing to bring a treble damages action for the antitrust violations of a vertically integrated defendant occurring at the retail 
level, P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law P340b (1978) (quoted in part in opposing memo 27-28), this Court must follow the 
Supreme Court's directive in Illinois Brick that except for the few cases the Court enumerated in Illinois Brick and Hanover Shoe 
there would be no exceptions to the rule that only a party suffering direct injury possesses standing under § 4 of the Clayton Act. 
431 U.S. at 735-36 + n. 16, 743-45."
1171,4," Entry of summary judgment against an antitrust plaintiff under Illinois Brick is entirely proper.  See Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 
431 U.S. 720 (1977); Gas-a-Tron of Arizona v. American Oil Co., at 73, 246 (D. Ariz.); In re Beef Industry Antitrust Litigation,

1172,5," HN3[

States having jurisdiction over the parties, against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws… when and 
under the same conditions and principles as injunctive relief against threatened conduct that will cause loss or damage is 
granted by courts of equity, under the rules governing such proceedings, and upon the execution of proper bond against 
damages for an injunction improvidently granted and a showing that the danger of irreparable loss or damage is immediate, a 
preliminary injunction may issue….  In any action under this section in which the plaintiff substantially prevails, the court shall 
award the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fees, to each plaintiff."""

cases, a party may lack standing to bring a § 4 action for treble damages but possess standing to bring a § 16 action for

which we found that employees' of a candidate for a merger between two newspapers lacked standing to seek § 16 injunctive 
relief to bar the merger. "

1173,10," The consumers' claim in Gutierrez v. E.J. Gallo Winery Co., 425 F. Supp. 1221 (N.D. Cal. 1977), is analogous to that in 
Jeffrey: the Gutierrez consumers argued that anticompetitive activities by defendants at the non-retail level caused the price of 
Gallo wines to be increased.  The district court found that plaintiffs' pocketbook injuries failed to constitute a business or 
commercial interest protected by § 4.  425 F. Supp at 1225-26. The court decided the § 16 issue on equitable grounds: ""The average individual recovery, were these plaintiffs to sue for damages successfully, would be miniscule.  The essential, 
equitable element of irreparable injury from future violations is missing, and injunctive relief will not lie."""
1173,425, F. Supp. at 1227. 
1174,11," As noted earlier in this opinion, because the Court in disposing of this Rule 12(b)(6) motion is considering matters outside the 
pleadings, we treat Kroger's motion as one for summary judgment made pursuant to Rule 56(b). Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  Under 
Rule 56(c) answers to interrogatories (along with the pleadings, depositions, admissions on file, and affidavits) may be 
considered in determining whether entry of summary judgment is proper."
1174,12," We note that the variation of standing discussed here with respect to Roco is analytically distinct from that with which we dealt 
in discussing Parkview's standing to bring an action under either § 4 or § 16 of the Clayton Act.See Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 
431 U.S. 720, 728 n. 7 (1977; Malamud v. Sinclair Oil Corp., 521 F. 2d 1142 (6th Cir. 1975). "
1175,13," Section 1 provides in pertinent part: ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several 
States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal…."" "
1176,14," The ""pendent claim"" seeking similar relief on a state law ground will not be dismissed. "
1185,1," .  North Carolina law is not unequivocally clear on this issue. Neither side has cited, nor has the Court in its research found, any 
decision by the North Carolina Supreme Court dispositive of the issue. The Court notes, therefore, that this case possibly would 
be suitable for certification to the North Carolina Supreme Court for an interpretation of the scope of the Attorney General's 
authority to represent local school boards. See Lehman Brothers v. Schein, 416 U.S. 386, 389-92, 94 S. Ct. 1741, 40 L. Ed. 2d 
215 (1974). Unfortunately, North Carolina does not have such a certification procedure. The Court also notes that, because this is not a diversity action, the res judicata issues are not dependent solely on North 
Carolina law. For reasons of comity as well as convenience, however, the Court has borrowed heavily from the state source of 
law. "
1191,*," Honorable William J. Lindberg, Senior United States District Judge for the Western District of Washington, sitting by 
designation."
1191,1," HN1[
]  28 U.S.C. § 1441(b) reads as follows: ""Any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction founded on a claim or right arising under the Constitution, 
treaties or laws of the United States shall be removable without regard to the citizenship or residence of the parties."""
1191,2," HN2[
] California Business and Professions Code § 16750 reads as follows: ""(a) Any person who is injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden or declared unlawful by this chapter, 
may sue therefor in any court having jurisdiction in the county where the defendant resides or is found, or any agent resides or is 
found, or where service may be obtained, without respect to the amount in controversy, and to recover three times the damages 
sustained by him, and shall be awarded a reasonable attorneys' fee together with the costs of the suit."" "
1192,3," A brief chronology of the events above mentioned might be helpful. July 7, 1975.  California's federal action was commenced. December 16, 1975.  Brinker's state action was commenced. February 4, 1976.  California's state action was commenced. March 18, 1976.  Removal petitions were filed in the state actions. March 26 and 31, 1976.  Motions to remand the state actions were filed in federal court. May 20, 1976.  The court order denying consumer class certification was entered. July 23, 1976.  The court order denying remand, from which these appeals are taken, was entered."
1192,4," Even accepting these contentions, a serious problem is posed by State of Washington v. American League of Professional 
Baseball Clubs, 460 F.2d 654 (9th Cir. 1972) (Baseball ).  There the same contentions were made as are made here that the 
antitrust claims alleged arose under federal as well as under state law. This court pointed out that the jurisdiction of a federal 
court on removal is derivative; that under Lambert Run Coal Co. v. B. & O. R.R. Co. 258 U.S. 377, 42 S. Ct. 349, 66 L. Ed. 671 
(1922), if the state court lacks jurisdiction over the subject-matter of an action (for example, when a federal statute grants 
exclusive jurisdiction to the federal courts, as do the federal antitrust statutes), that lack is not cured by removal. The removed "
1193,," action must be dismissed by the federal court since it has acquired no jurisdiction from the state court.  In Baseball we 
concluded that under Lambert Run the federal court was without jurisdiction to proceed on the federal antitrust claims but that 
the state claims remained for disposition.  We directed that the case be remanded to the state court. In our case the district court, in its opinion denying remand to the state courts, dealt at length with Lambert Run and Baseball, 
and distinguished them on the ground that here the cases are multidistrict and class action cases.  It concluded that to apply 
Lambert Run and Baseball in multidistrict class actions would be to defeat the purpose of Congress in enacting 28 U.S.C. § 
1407 dealing with the consolidation of pretrial proceedings in multidistrict actions.  It stated: ""Due to the widespread application of multidistrict litigation authorized by 28 U.S.C. § 1407 and the frequent certification of class 
action in such litigation, remands comparable to that sought in the California and Brinker cases will have highly adverse effects 
upon efficiency, expediting, avoiding duplication and control of time and expense incurred in discovery and almost every other 
phase of conducting multidistrict litigation."" We need not reach the question whether the procedure followed in Baseball should apply in multidistrict class action cases 
where both federal and state claims are intermingled or whether the distinction drawn by the district court should apply.  As we 
discuss, Infra, here there is no federal consumer class claim to be consolidated with the other multidistrict claims."
1193,5," Appellees would have us ""transform"" the claims under the California statute into one stating a federal claim. They cite as 
authority for this transformation a series of removal cases in which complaints purporting to state claims under state law were 
found to state facts actually alleging claims under federal statutes which effectively pre-empted the state law. See, e. g., 
Johnson v. England, 356 F.2d 44 (9th Cir.), Cert. denied, 384 U.S. 961, 86 S. Ct. 1587, 16 L. Ed. 2d 673 (1966); American 
Synthetic Rubber Corp. v. Louisville & N. R. Co., 422 F.2d 462 (6th Cir. 1970). That is not the situation facing us."
1193,6," While the Supreme Court's construction of § 4 of the Clayton Act undoubtedly will be given great deference by state courts in 
their construction of the state law counterpart (Cal.Bus. & Prof.Code § 16750, Supra n. 2), still it cannot be said with assurance 
that state policy would not be held to call for a different construction.  The state has recently enacted California Business and 
Professions Code § 16760, which provides in part: ""The Attorney General may bring a civil action in the name of the people of the State of California, as parens patriae on behalf of 
natural persons residing in the state, in the superior court of any county which has jurisdiction of a defendant, to secure 
monetary relief as provided in this section for injury sustained by such natural persons to their property by reason of any violation 
of this chapter.  The court shall exclude from the amount of monetary relief awarded in such action any amount of monetary 
relief (A) which duplicates amounts which have been awarded for the same injury, or (B) which is properly allocable to * * * (ii) 
any business entity."" Here the state has given indication of greater concern for small claims than is afforded by class action provisions standing alone.  
It has indicated a desire that such claimants should not have to rely on private representation; that the state as parens patriae 
should attend to their needs.  It is not wholly irrational to suppose that the state had in mind the claims of ultimate consumers 
and that it would not approve of wiping out all such claims against the price fixer in favor of the claims of direct purchasers. "
1194,," The Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976, 15 U.S.C. § 15c, Et seq., has made the same provision for parens 
patriae representation.  As Mr. Justice Brennan notes in his dissent in Illinois Brick, ""The Senate Report accompanying the new 
Act expressly found that ""(t)he economic burden of most antitrust violations is borne by the consumer in the form of higher prices 
for goods and services.' S.Rep., No. 94-803 * * * ."" 431 U.S. at 756, 97 S. Ct. at 2080."
1194,7," Even were we to favor the bill of peace analogy we doubt that removal would be an appropriate vehicle.  Removal, as we have 
noted, contemplates federal trial.  Where the purpose is not to bring the challenged action to trial but to stay it, in order to 
eliminate complicating and overlapping litigation, a forthright motion to enjoin state action would focus on the true problem more 
accurately and would more directly present the values that are competing for accommodation. "

1199,3," The Act does provide a narrow exemption for telephone company consolidations and acquisitions approved by the FCC.  47 
U.S.C. §§ 221(a), 222(c) (1). Nevertheless, the inclusion of specific exemptions from the antitrust laws neither precludes other 
implied exemptions, e.g., Pan American World Airways, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 296, 9 L. Ed. 2d 325, 83 S. Ct. 476 
(1963); Terminal Warehouse Co. v. Pennsylvania R. Co. 297 U.S. 500, 80 L. Ed. 827, 56 S. Ct. 546 (1936), nor necessarily 
supports a broader immunity, e.g., California V. Federal Power Comm'n, 369 U.S. 482, 485, 8 L. Ed. 2d 54, 82 S. Ct. 901 (1962); 
United States v. Borden Co., 308 U.S. 188, 198-202, 84 L. Ed. 181, 60 S. Ct. 182 (1939). These explicit immunity provisions of 
the Communications Act do not suggest a blanket exemption, Industrial Commun. Systems, Inc. v. Pacific Tel. & Tel. Co., 505 
F.2d 152, 156 (9th Cir. 1974), nor do they necessarily constitute the only exemptions available.  International Tel. & Tel. Co. v. 
General Tel. & Elec. Corp., 518 F.2d 913, 918-19 (9th Cir. 1975)."
1199,4," Indeed, a blanket immunity from the antitrust laws due to the existence of a regulatory scheme may require ""an unequivocally 
declared purpose"" on the part of Congress. Pan American World Airways, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 296, 304-305, 9 L. Ed. 
2d 325, 83 S. Ct. 476 (1963). See Hughes Tool Co. v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 409 U.S. 363, 387, 34 L. Ed. 2d 577, 93 S. Ct. 
647 (1973)."
1199,5," This portion of the opinion focuses exclusively upon federally regulated conduct, although defendants throughout their papers 
refer to both federal and state regulation in support of their immunity argument based upon ""pervasive"" regulation. Their 
immunity theory is derived from various Supreme Court decisions accommodating the antitrust laws with exclusively federal 
regulation. The need for antitrust immunity arises in those cases because of the conflict between two congressional schemes of 
equal status. State regulation, however, has a status inferior to federal enactments, and thus becomes the victim of federal 
preemption under the Supremacy Clause. State regulation is relevant to limitations upon the sweep of the federal antitrust laws 
only in the manner discussed in the succeeding section of this opinion dealing with the state action exception under Parker v. 
Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 87 L. Ed. 315, 63 S. Ct. 307 (1942), and its progeny."
1199,6," Other district courts have split on the immunity question. Most have favored immunity, see Selectron, Inc. v. Pacific Northwest 
Bell Tel. Co., 587 F. Supp. 856 (D. Ore. 1978); Monitor Bus. Machines, Inc. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 1978-1 CCH Trade 
Regulation Rep. P 62,030 (C.D. Cal. 1978); Essential Communication Systems, Inc. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 446 F. Supp. 
1090 (D. N.J. 1978); DASA Corp. v. General Tel. Co., 1977-2 CCH Trade Regulation Rep. P 61,610 (C.D. Cal. 1977); 
Phonetele, Inc. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 435 F. Supp. 207 (C.D. Cal. 1977). Only two decisions have held to the contrary. 
See Jarvis, Inc. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 481 F. Supp. 120 (D.D.C. 1978); Macom Products Corp. v. American Tel. & Tel. 
Co., 359 F. Supp. 973 (C.D. Calif. 1973). "
1200,7," The issue is not whether immunity is necessary to meet the goals of the regulatory program, i.e., whether the challenged 
practice is necessary to protect the public interest although clearly constituting a violation of the antitrust laws. Thus, plaintiff's 
argument that the general goals of the Communications Act are consistent with those of the Sherman Act is misfocused. As the 
Court majority explained in Gordon v. NYSE, supra at 688 on the one hand, there is a factual question as to whether fixed commission rates are actually necessary to the operation of 
the exchanges as contemplated under the Securities Exchange Act. On the other hand, there is a legal question as to 
whether allowance of an antitrust suit would conflict with the operation of the regulatory scheme which specifically 
authorizes the SEC to oversee the fixing of commission rates. The factual question is not before us in this case. Rather, we 
are concerned with whether antitrust immunity, as a matter of law, must be implied in order to permit the exchange to 
function as envisioned by Congress. The issue of the wisdom of fixed rates becomes relevant only where it is determined 
that there is no antitrust immunity. Justices Stewart and Brennan disagreed, declaring that the inconsistency required to support a finding of immunity must be one 
that threatens the ""aims of the regulatory framework."" Id. at 658. (Stewart and Brennan, J.J., concurring) (quoting Silver v. 
NYSE, supra at 361)."
1200,8," The Supreme Court on a number of occasions has described public utility or common carrier regulation as pervasive. See Otter 
Tail Power Co. v. United States, 410 U.S. 366, 377, 35 L. Ed. 2d 359, 93 S. Ct. 1022 (1973); United States v. Philadelphia Nat'l 
Bank, supra at 352; United States v. Radio Corp. of Am., 358 U.S. 334, 339-346, 3 L. Ed. 2d 354, 79 S. Ct. 457 (1959) "
1201,9," The absence of such an approval may be due to the lack of available technology or a recognizable interconnect market in 
1934. Nevertheless, Gordon is less persuasive as a result."
1201,10," The vertical restraints attacked in the complaint were ""the kinds of restrictions Congress contemplated when it enacted that 
section, and, this conclusion necessarily leads to a determination that they are immune from liability under the Sherman Act, for 
we see no way to reconcile the Commission's power to authorize those restrictions with the competing mandate of the antitrust 
laws."" United States v. NASD, supra at 721-22."
1201,11," It has been argued that the lack of competitive criteria in the Communications Act should not be seen as an indication that 
Congress did not intend the FCC to supplant the antitrust laws. Note, AT&T and the Antitrust Laws: A Strict Test for Implied 
Immunity, 85 Yale L.J. 254, 263 n.44 (1975). But cf. Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States, supra at 372-75; United States v. 
NASD, supra at 743 (White, J., dissenting). The reason given is that competition standards made sense only in those regulated 
industries in which competition still existed to a significant extent. The telephone industry, however, was conceded by Congress 
to be a monopoly. See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 781, 73d Cong. 2d Sess. 2 (1934). To require explicit competitive standards, according 
to one author, ""would have the anomalous result of displacing the antitrust laws in industries where Congress felt the competitive 
ideal was still very important and retaining their applicability in industries where Congress felt competition should not play a 
significant role."" Note, AT&T and the Antitrust Laws: A Strict Test for Implied Immunity, supra. Although the failure of Congress 
explicitly to bestow upon the FCC the duty of preserving competition where beneficial to the public may not justify an inference 
that Congress intended both acts to operate simultaneously, the absence of standards certainly weakens the analogy to those 
cases in which the Court found such criteria significant. "
1202,12," In NASD, the Court noted that ""the broad regulatory authority conferred upon the SEC by the Maloney and Investment 
Company Acts enables it to monitor the activities . . . and the history of Commission regulations suggests no laxity in the 
exercise of this authority."" Id. at 734. The Court was referring, in part, to the SEC's control over NASD rules, a control which, as 
discussed above, must be exercised before the rules become effective, and which is guided by criteria that explicitly include 
competition. As to the challenged ancillary activities intended to frustrate the secondary market in mutual fund shares, the Court noted also 
that ""to the extent these activities might frustrate the SEC's regulatory objectives it has ample authority to eliminate them."" Id. 
This statement could be interpreted as a rule of implied immunity based on the regulatory agency's power to prevent or halt 
antitrust violations. And NASD has been interpreted by some as following, if not explicitly articulating, a rule that recognizes an 
immunity whenever an agency has jurisdiction over the activity and the authority to correct the problem. See, e.g. Sherman, The 
Application of the Antitrust Laws to Regulated Industries, 44 Tenn. L. Rev. 1, 25 (1976); The Supreme Court 1974 Term, 89 
Harv. L. Rev. 47, 211 (1975). However, the Court's recognition of immunity for the ancillary activities was based primarily on the already established exclusive 
authority of the SEC under § 22(f) of the Investment Company Act to regulate vertical restraints imposed by the funds 
themselves. The Court saw an antitrust injunction against activity by NASD members to suppress intrafund secondary market 
activities as potentially contrary to the SEC's policy of restricting the secondary market. This ""close relationship"" between the 
goals of the ancillary activity and the aims of the SEC was ""fatal to the Government's complaint."" 422 U.S. at 733. Accordingly, 
the Court noted that ""the Government does not contend that appellee's activities have had the purpose or effect of restraining 
competition among the various funds."" Id. Had the Government alleged a conspiracy restricting interfund competition, the result 
might have been different, although the regulatory levers would have been the same. See id. at 734 n.46. "
1203,13," In Hughes, the Supreme Court strongly implied that had the challenged conduct not been subject to agency direction or 
agreement, there would have been no immunity. 409 U.S. at 385-86 n.14, quoting United States v. Borden, 308 U.S. 188, 200, 
84 L. Ed. 181, 60 S. Ct. 182 (1939)."
1203,14," In Phonetele, Inc. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 435 F. Supp. 207 (C.D. Cal. 1977), the court held that the defendant's conduct 
pursuant to the post-Carterfone tariffs was immune from antitrust scrutiny because, inter alia, the sanctions available to the FCC 
in enforcing the Communications Act were similar to those available to the courts under the antitrust laws. However, the 
regulatory limitation to actual damages fails to provide the strong deterrent to anticompetitive behavior established by Congress 
through the treble damage provision of the antitrust laws. In addition, the available administrative remedies must be examined in the context of the particular actions alleged in the 
complaint. Although the Communications Act does provide a damage remedy, the range of conduct prohibited is far narrower 
than that of the antitrust laws. For example, in the present suit the plaintiff alleges both attempt and conspiracy, neither of which 
is covered by the Act. Cf.  Terminal Warehouse Co. v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 297 U.S. 500, 516, 80 L. Ed. 827, 56 S. Ct. 546 
(1936). The right to sue for damages under the antitrust laws in the present case does not necessarily mean that a plaintiff may resort to 
both the agency damage procedure and the antitrust courts. It may be that the plaintiff must choose between the two avenues. 
See Carnation Co. v. Pacific Conference, Inc., 383 U.S. 213, 224, 15 L. Ed. 2d 709, 86 S. Ct. 781 (1966). The plaintiff has not 
attempted to utilize the FCC damage remedy, thus the right to seek treble damages is clearly available."
1203,15," In Essential Communication Systems, Inc. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 446 F. Supp. 1090 (D. N.J. 1978), the district court 
examined the regulatory history of interconnection and concluded that the post-Caterfone tariffs were ""sanctioned by the FCC as 
a means to serve its regulatory responsibilities and administrative needs."" Id. at 1102. As a result, the court found application of 
the antitrust laws repugnant to the FCC's action. This Court must respectfully disagree. The FCC explicitly withheld even 
provisional approval of the tariffs. Also, the FCC would undoubtedly have learned at least as much from the experiences of a 
more liberal interconnection method adopted by the carriers. Finally, the absence of sufficient technical information concerning 
interconnection may justify the course taken by the defendants, but that is a question to be considered when examining the "
1204,," antitrust question on the merits under the ""Rule of Reason."" See Jacobi v. Bache & Co., 520 F.2d 1231 (2d Cir. 1975), cert. 
denied, 423 U.S. 1087 (1976). It is not a reason to disclaim jurisdiction."
1204,16," Northeastern also challenged a number of other actions by the defendants, including massive advertising intended to cast 
doubt upon the products and services of the defendants' interconnection competitors, an expensive research and development 
program, and the announcement of improvements in telephone equipment prior to the establishment of a tariff and before the 
equipment is in stock. The FCC's efforts to regulate these activities have been far less significant than its efforts in the area of 
interconnection design, and the statutory framework is no more suggestive of a congressional intent to immunize such conduct. 
Accordingly, these ancillary activities are not immune from the antitrust laws by virtue of federal regulation. "

the public telephone lines."
1205,18," This plan includes a two-tier payment schedule to allow the customer to pay monthly maintenance costs while meeting the

Interconnection, 61 F.C.C.2d 766, 868 (1976). According to the plaintiff's calculations, this two-tier plan is attractive only if capital 
payments are extended over at least seven years, during which period the customer will be inaccessible to competitors."

1206,22, The market has been defined by the plaintiff to include only PBX and KTS telephone equipment.
1206,23," The Supreme Court plurality wrote as follows: There are at least three reasons why this argument is unacceptable. First, merely because certain conduct may be subject 
both to state regulation and to the federal antitrust laws does not necessarily mean that it must satisfy inconsistent 
standards; second, even assuming inconsistency, we could not accept the view that the federal interest must inevitably be 
subordinated to the state's; and finally, even if we were to assume that Congress did not intend the antitrust laws to apply to 
areas of the economy primarily regulated by a State, that assumption would not foreclose the enforcement of the antitrust 
laws in an essentially unregulated area such as the market for electric light bulbs.  428 U.S. at 595. "
1207,24," The customized payment plan having been found not to be exempt from the Sherman Act, the ancillary activities challenged 
by Northeastern, see note 16 supra, are virtually a fortiori nonexempt as well. The PUCA's authority is broad, but vague and 
unexercized. Section 16-6b of the Connecticut Public Service Companies Act empowers the PUCA to adopt regulations dealing 
with ""rates and charges, services, accounting practices, safety and the conduct of operations generally . . . ."" The PUCA has not 
enacted regulations dealing with most of the criticized practices. Although in 1975 the state legislature provided the PUCA with 
the explicit authority to regulate advertising, Conn. Gen. Stat. § 19d(e), the authority has not yet promulgated regulations. Also, 
although the PUCA has examined SNET's advertising expenditures, the examination was not conducted with an eye toward the 
anti-competitive impact of such expenditures. See Application of Southern New England Tel. Co. to Increase It's Rates and 
Charges for Telephone Service Affecting All Subscribers, Docket No. 11671 (June 12, 1975). "
1216,1," .  Because the thrust of this Memorandum is whether the antitrust laws are applicable, it does not attempt inquiry separate from 
§ 1 into the merits of the § 2 claim. "
1219,2," .  If a studied vagueness, its inclusion is not necessarily unwise. The development of a judicial consensus for government goals 
in a regulated economy may need academic jousting and case-by-case fleshing, both nourished by the vague phrase. "
1224,3," .  The Sixth Circuit in 1898 (J. Taft) did introduce a concept of reasonableness, See, United States v. Addyston Pipe & Steel 
Co., 85 F. 271 (6th Cir. 1898), Mod. 175 U.S. 211, 20 S. Ct. 96, 44 L. Ed. 136 (1899), but the idea did not receive the imprimatur 
of the Supreme Court until 1911, six years after Donovan, in United States v. Standard Oil Co., 221 U.S. 1, 31 S. Ct. 502, 55 L.

destroying competition."""
1234,2," HN2[

1235,6," 15 United States Code section 13 (§ 1 of the Robinson-Patman Act which amended § 2 of the Clayton Act) consists of six 
subdivisions, (a) through (f).  Subdivision (a) prohibits direct and indirect discrimination in price having specified effects on 
competition.  Certain affirmative defenses are also permitted, notably cost justification of price differences.  (See, Hills, Antitrust 
Adviser (2d ed. 1978) § 4.2, p. 293.) Section 13 reads in part as follows: ""(a) It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce in the course of such commerce, either directly or indirectly, to 
discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality, where either or any of the purchases 
involved in such discrimination are in commerce, where such commodities are sold for use, consumption, or resale within the 
United States or any Territory thereof or the District of Columbia or any insular possession or other place under the jurisdiction of 
the United States, and where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a 
monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any person who either grants or knowingly "

prevent differentials which make only due allowance for differences in the cost of manufacture, sale, or delivery resulting from 
the differing methods or quantities in which such commodities are to such purchasers sold or delivered: . . . And provided further, 
That nothing herein contained shall prevent persons engaged in selling goods, wares, or merchandise in commerce from 
selecting their own customers in bona fide transactions and not in restraint of trade: And provided further, That nothing herein 
contained shall prevent price changes from time to time where in response to changing conditions affecting the market for or the

obsolescence of seasonal goods, distress sales under court process, or sales in good faith in discontinuance of business in the 
goods concerned."""
1236,7," Section 17040 addresses the concept of locality discrimination: ""It is unlawful for any person engaged in the production, manufacture, distribution or sale of any article or product of general use 
or consumption, with intent to destroy the competition of any regular established dealer in such article or product, or to prevent 
the competition of any person who in good faith, intends and attempts to become such dealer, to create locality discriminations. ""Nothing in this section prohibits the meeting in good faith of a competitive price."" The ""smallest geographical unit [section 17040] envisages is the individual store or outlet, not the individual purchaser 
regardless of location."" ( Harris v. Capitol Records etc. Corp., 64 Cal.2d 454, 460 [50 Cal.Rptr. 539, 413 P.2d 139].)"
1236,8," Before the United States Supreme Court's decision in Nashville Milk Co. a conflict existed in the federal circuits concerning 
whether section 3 of the Robinson-Patman Act (15 U.S.C. § 13a) was an antitrust law for purposes of recovering treble 
damages. The Third Circuit viewed section 3 as an antitrust law. (See, e.g., Dean Oil Company v. American Oil Company, 
(D.C.N.J. 1956) 147 F.Supp. 414, affd. per curiam (3d Cir.) 254 F.2d 816, cert. den.  358 U.S. 835 [3 L.Ed.2d 72, 79 S.Ct. 58].) 
The Seventh Circuit viewed section 3 as not within the treble damage ambit.  (See, e.g., Mackey v. Sears Roebuck & Co. (7th 
Cir. 1956) 237 F.2d 869.)"
1236,9," Section 13a (§ 3 of the Robinson-Patman Act) provides: ""It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, to be a party to, or assist in, any 
transaction of sale, or contract to sell, which discriminates to his knowledge against competitors of the purchaser, in that, any 
discount, rebate, allowance, or advertising service charge is granted to the purchaser over and above any discount, rebate, 
allowance, or advertising service charge available at the time of such transaction to said competitors in respect of a sale of 
goods of like grade, quality, and quantity; to sell, or contract to sell, goods in any part of the United States at prices lower than 
those exacted by said person elsewhere in the United States for the purpose of destroying competition, or eliminating a 
competitor in such part of the United States; or, to sell, or contract to sell, goods at unreasonably low prices for the purpose of 
destroying competition or eliminating a competitor."" ""Any person violating any of the provisions of this section, shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $ 5,000 or 
imprisoned not more than one year, or both."" (15 U.S.C. § 13a; italics added. "
1237,10," 15 United States Code section 26 (§ 16 of the Clayton Act) grants a private cause of action for injunctive relief ""against 
threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws."""
1237,11," For purposes of clarity, it is important to understand that 15 United States Code section 13, and 15 United States Code section 
13a, are two separate and independent sections of the Robinson-Patman Act. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in 
Nashville Milk Co., section 13a includes its own independent penalty provision exclusive of 15 United States Code section 15, 
the treble damage provision.  (See fn. 9 ante.) The United States Supreme Court in Nashville Milk Co. addressed section 13a 
only and not section 13."
1237,12," Similarly, HN6[
] section 17001 articulates the purpose of the Unfair Practices Act: ""The Legislature declares that the purpose of this chapter is to safeguard the public against the creation or perpetuation of monopolies and to foster and encourage 
competition, by prohibiting unfair, dishonest, deceptive, destructive, fraudulent and discriminatory practices by which fair and 
honest competition is destroyed or prevented."" (Italics added.) "
1241,1," .  Though plaintiffs' antitrust claims arose by cross-complaint, the convention adopted by the previous trial court in referring to 
cross-complainants as ""plaintiffs"" will be followed here. Plaintiffs in fact consist of four separate but affiliated corporations: 
Continental T.V., Inc.; A & G Sales, Inc.; Sylpac, Inc.; and S.A.M. Industries, Inc.  Plaintiffs will be collectively referred to herein 
as either ""Continental"" or ""plaintiff""."
1241,2," .  Sylvania products had long been manufactured by Sylvania Electric Products, Inc., which, in turn, was a wholly owned 
subsidiary of General Telephone and Electronics, a multi-national conglomerate.  After the original trial had concluded, and 
during the pendency of Sylvania's appeal in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, this corporation was merged into GTE, which 
name was then changed to GTE Sylvania.  Sylvania, henceforth, was and is an operating division of GTE Sylvania. "
1242,3," .  Intrabrand competition is the competition between the distributors wholesale or retail of the product of a particular 
manufacturer. Here, the competition that would have existed between two or more of Sylvania's franchised retailers in the sale of 
Sylvania products."
1242,4," .  As noted in the Supreme Court opinion, it is this type of competition, i. e. interbrand competition, which is the primary concern 
of antitrust law.  (Supreme Court opinion, 97 S. Ct., at 2559, n.19)."
1242,5," .  See, 97 S. Ct., at 2552; 537 F.2d, at 983, n.3. "
1243,6, . 
1244,7," .  After entry of the trial court judgment, Sylvania filed a notice of appeal, and pursuant to Fed.R.App.P. 3(c), designated ""the 
judgment, order or Part thereof appealed from"" (emphasis added) as follows: ""Notice is hereby given that Sylvania Electric Products, Inc., a corporation, cross-defendant above named, hereby appeals to the 
United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit from Designated portions of the final judgment filed in this action on 
December 11, 1970, and duly entered of record on December 18, 1970, as follows:"
1244,1," . From paragraph 1 of said judgment insofar as it enrolls Those portions of the jury's verdict adverse to Sylvania Electric 
Products, Inc."
1244,2, . From paragraph 2 of said judgment and the whole thereof.
1244,3," . From paragraph 3 of said judgment and the whole thereof."" (Emphasis added) Paragraph 2 of the judgment contained the jury's damage award to Continental predicated upon the determination of locations 
practice violations; paragraph 3 set forth the limited equitable relief granted by the court premised on the same adverse (to 
Sylvania) adjudication of the locations practice claim. "
1245,8," .  By this theory, plaintiff apparently seeks to show that Sylvania, at the behest of its franchised retailers, implemented its 
location restriction in order to allocate retail markets.  HN2[
] Of course, horizontal division of markets accomplished by a conspiracy among competitors is a Per se violation of Section 1.  Addyston Pipe & Steel, Co. v. United States, 175 U.S. 211, 20 
S. Ct. 96, 44 L. Ed. 136 (1899). Furthermore, if competitors induce their manufacturer to allocate markets, this too has been held 
to be a Per se violation of Section 1, United States v. Topco Associates, 405 U.S. 596, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515 (1972), 
since such an act is, in effect, a horizontal agreement to divide territories. In our case, however, Sylvania's new distribution program was hardly a vertical facade for an underlying horizontal conspiracy by 
Sylvania's retailers. First, as the facts indicate, many of those retailers were terminated at the inception of the new program. 
Second, Sylvania had two or more dealers in all cities with populations over 100,000 (98 S. Ct., at 2552, n.2). And finally, it was 
the very enfranchising of plaintiff's competitor in the San Francisco market that, in part, gave rise to this case. Regardless of the merits of plaintiff's proposed theory, it cannot be asserted now not having been raised before."
1245,9," .  See footnote # 7, Supra."
1245,10," .  However, at least one commentator is of the opinion that the rule of reason test is not, at the present time, a clear standard 
by which to judge vertical restrictions.  Posner, The Rule of Reason and the Economic Approach: Reflections on the Sylvania 
Decision, 45 Chi.L.Rev. 1 (1977). Professor Posner suggests two approaches to making the rule of reason operational.  The first 
is to balance the detriment of lessened intrabrand competition against the benefit of increased interbrand competition.  The 
second, and the approach preferred by the author, is to ""focus on the single question whether the restriction is intended to 
cartelize distribution or, on the contrary, to promote the manufacturer's own interest."" Id., at 16-17. "
1246,," Under the facts presented herein, Sylvania passes either test. The enhancement of interbrand competition more than offsets any 
decline in the intrabrand and Sylvania imposed the location clause to strengthen its own effectiveness rather than as an 
unrealistic attempt to cartelize an industry with more than 100 manufacturers."

competitive machines, which may not instantly shut off, do so within from ten to thirty seconds.] (2) A remote air control device which cancelled and accumulated messages for the user from an outside telephone.

1293,2," .  In determining the jurisdictional issue the district court refused to consider the interstate flow of Medicaid payments received 
by the Center.  On appeal, the Center (the cross-appellee on this issue) has urged that the trial court should have taken those "
1294,," payments into account, citing Alabama Optometric Ass'n v. Alabama State Board of Health, 1972, M.D.Ala., 379 F. Supp. 1332. 
Since we affirm the trial court's jurisdictional ruling in favor of the Center, we need not address that issue."
1294,3," .  This Court's recent decision in McLain v. Real Estate Board of New Orleans, Inc., 5 Cir. 1978, 583 F.2d 1315, is not to the 
contrary.  That case involved a civil action alleging that real estate brokers fixed prices in connection with the sale of real estate 
in the New Orleans area.  The court applied the substantial effects test and held that Sherman Act jurisdiction is not conferred by 
the allegation ""that many of the defendants' customers are ""persons moving into and out of the Greater New Orleans area.' "" 583 
F.2d at 1320. We do not read the McLain opinion to say that the flow of out-of-state customers is not a factor to be considered in 
determining jurisdiction, nor even that jurisdiction can never attach on the sole basis of transactions with out-of-state customers. 
The court held that residential real estate brokerage activities do not substantially affect interstate commerce because the 
interstate consequences are remote or incidental.  583 F.2d at 1320 & n. 4. That conclusion is unassailable, because few people 
cross state lines For the purpose of purchasing residential real estate.  The effects of the conduct alleged in this case, accepting 
the allegations of the complaint as true, cannot be characterized as ""remote"" or ""incidental"", however, for the district court found 
that Tallahassee is a regional, interstate center for the provision of medical services.  A fair implication from this finding is that 
persons cross the Florida-Georgia state line for the purpose of coming to the Center's Tallahassee clinic. "

1296,6," .  The court required the plaintiff to meet the high burden of proof of sham conduct suggested by the Supreme Court's opinion in 
Otter Tail Co. v. United States, 1973, 410 U.S. 366, 93 S. Ct. 1022, 35 L. Ed. 2d 359. In Otter Tail the Court stated that antitrust 
liability may attach ""where the purpose to suppress competition is evidenced by repetitive lawsuits carrying the hallmark of 
insubstantial claims"".  410 U.S. at 380, 93 S. Ct. at 1031. See also California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 1972, 
404 U.S. 508, 513, 92 S. Ct. 609, 30 L. Ed. 2d 642. Otter Tail and California Motor Transport acknowledge that HN4[
] a 
showing of a pattern of repetitive, baseless claims is strong evidence of sham petitioning, but they do not hold that such 
evidence is Essential to proof of sham. The Noerr doctrine presents no bar if the plaintiff proves that the petitioning was not a 
genuine effort to influence public officials to take governmental action.  See California Motor Transport, 404 U.S. at 511-512, 92 
S. Ct. 609, 30 L. Ed. 2d 642 ; See generally Fischel, Antitrust Liability for Attempts to Influence Government Action: The Basis 
and Limits of the Noerr-Pennington Doctrine, 45 U.Chi.L.Rev. 80, 106-110 (1977). Absent clear direction from the Supreme 
Court, we see no reason for erecting a special, high burden of proof on this issue. "
1297,7," .  Moreover, it would be improper to admit evidence of the medical society's meeting and resolution.  Evidence of activity that is 
protected by the Noerr doctrine may be admitted to show the purpose and character of other activity if doing so is not overly 
prejudicial to the defendants.  United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. at 670-71 n. 3, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 ; 
Household Goods Carriers' Bureau v. Terrell, 5 Cir. 1971, 452 F.2d 152, 158 n. 18. Admissibility, we think, should be governed 
by a test that weighs the probativeness of and the plaintiff's need for the evidence against the danger that admission of the 
evidence will prejudice the defendant's first amendment rights.  The medical society's meeting and resolution have some 
evidentiary bearing on the character of the doctors' other actions and may aid in demonstrating Palmer's sympathies, but the 
probative value of this evidence is low.  As evidence of the alleged conspiracy it is cumulative.  As evidence of Dr. Palmer's state 
of mind it is exceedingly weak, for at the time the resolution was co-authored by Palmer he was already a party defendant to this 
suit.  Its evidentiary value to the plaintiff is far outweighed by the defendants' first amendment interests."
1297,8," .  The relevant portions of § 458.1201 provide as follows: (1) HN7[
] The board shall have authority to deny an application for a license or to discipline a physician licensed under this 
chapter or any antecedent law who, after hearing, has been adjudged unqualified or guilty of any of the following: (p) Being removed or suspended, or having disciplinary action taken by his peers within any professional medical association, 
society, professional standards review organization established pursuant to section 249F of Public Law 92-603, or similarly 
constituted professional body, whether or not such association, society, organization, or body is local, regional, state, national, or 
international in scope, or by being disciplined by a licensed hospital or medical staff of said hospital for immoral or 
unprofessional conduct or willful misconduct or negligence by the person in his capacity as a physician licensed pursuant to this 
chapter.  Anybody taking action as set forth in this paragraph shall report such action to the board within 30 days of its 
occurrence or be subject to a fine assessed by the board in an amount not exceeding $ 500. (3)(a) When the board finds any person unqualified or guilty of any of the grounds set forth in subsection (1), it may enter an 
order imposing one or more of the following:"
1297,1, . Deny his application for a license;
1297,2, . Permanently withhold issuance of a license;
1297,3, . Administer a public or private reprimand;
1297,4, . Suspend or limit or restrict his license to practice medicine for a period of up to five years;
1297,5, . Revoke indefinitely his license to practice medicine;
1297,6," . Require him to submit to the care, counseling, or treatment of physicians designated by the board;"

1297,8," . Require him to practice under the direction of a physician in a public institution, a public or private health care program, or 
private practice for a period of time specified by the board. "
1298,9," .  Florida's Medical Practice Act cannot, of course, operate to bar the use of such evidence in the trial of a federal cause of 
action."
1298,10," .  Moreover, the defendants do not argue that the communications in issue had anything to do with possible action regarding 
any physician's staff privileges."
1298,11," .  Section 458.1201(5), for example, provides: ""The board Shall report to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the 
House of Representatives on February 1 of each year . . .  the status of the actions taken by the board in carrying out the 
responsibilities assigned to it under this section."" (Emphasis added.) Subsection (1)(p) states: ""Anybody taking action as set 
forth in this paragraph Shall report such action to the board within 30 days of its occurrence or be subject to a fine assessed by 
the board in an amount not exceeding $ 500."" (Emphasis added.)"
1298,12," .  Throughout the appellees' briefs runs the argument that free discussion will be chilled, and Florida's system of self-regulation 
severely hampered, if this Court does not rule that the conduct of the OB-GYNs is Noerr -protected.  This is not, properly 
speaking, an argument from the first amendment's guarantee of the right to petition, but one from the amendment's guarantee of 
freedom of speech.  If the facts, as fully developed, show that the OB-GYNs discussed the clinic and adopted certain resolutions 
concerning the clinic, a free speech question would be presented.  If the facts suggested simply that certain physicians were 
persuaded by their colleagues that the clinic's mode of operations was detrimental to the public welfare, or that those physicians 
avoided the clinic simply out of the desire not to be poorly thought of by their colleagues, then the imposition of antitrust liability 
might implicate first amendment values.  At this point in the litigation, however, the facts are insufficiently developed to speculate 
about the merits of a possible free speech defense.  We do note, however, that in cases involving antitrust challenges to 
professional rules and canons enacted ostensibly in the public interest, the Supreme Court has not suggested that the first 
amendment bars relief.  See National Society of Professional Engineers v. United States, 1978, 435 U.S. 679, 98 S. Ct. 1355, 55 
L. Ed. 2d 637; Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 1975, 421 U.S. 773, 95 S. Ct. 2004, 44 L. Ed. 2d 572. It would seem anomalous to 
hold that the imposition of standards is not protected activity, but that the proposal and advocacy of standards in a manner 
bordering on imposition of standards is protected. "
1299,13," .  We do not imply that the disciplinary actions of the medical review groups would be governmental in character if the statute 
directed the BOME to take action against physicians disciplined by such groups.  That question is not before us."
1299,14," .  In his brief, appellee Curry contends that Noerr protection extends to the Tallahassee OB-GYNs' letter to Dr. Thompson at 
Jacksonville University Hospital in Jacksonville.  His theory is that since the hospital is a county hospital operated by the Duval 
County Hospital Authority, the actions of the hospital staff and Dr. Thompson, head of the residency program, are ""quasi-
governmental"".  Dr. Curry does not, however, specify the kind of government action that the OB-GYNs were seeking.  We do not 
think that any disciplinary action taken by Dr. Thompson would be any more governmental in nature than disciplinary action 
taken by the Tallahassee OB-GYNs.  The appellees have cited no statutes that authorize Dr. Thompson to take or threaten to 
take action respecting the status of residents simply because those residents have conducted themselves in a manner 
inconsistent with private standards of professional conduct that have never been adopted by an agency charged by law with 
promulgating such standards.  Moreover, the plaintiff Center may be complaining that the Tallahassee OB-GYNs were seeking 
wholly unofficial action from Dr. Thompson.  By the appellees' own admission, the letter was sent to Dr. Thompson simply as a 
means of communicating to the residents themselves, to whom the OB-GYNs had originally resolved to write, that the aftercare 
arrangements at the plaintiff's clinic were questionable."
1299,15," .  We limit our examination to the materials on file at the time the trial court entered summary judgment and ignore twelve 
affidavits filed by the Center after the court's entry of its order. "
1300,16," .  On appeal, the Center has urged for the first time the claim that the defendants' conduct amounted to an attempt to regulate 
the accessibility of abortion services in violation of patients' privacy rights under the Roe v. Wade line of decisions.  This claim 
was never raised before the trial court, and we see no need to address it at this time. "
1301,17," .  We are aware that, as Dr. Palmer urges, an agreement to violate the law is the essence of conspiracy. Joseph E. Seagrams 
and Sons, Inc. v. Hawaiian Oke Liquors, 9 Cir. 1969, 416 F.2d 71, Cert. denied, 1970, 396 U.S. 1962, 90 S. Ct. 752, 24 L. Ed. 
2d 755. We hold only that there is a triable issue as to whether Dr. Palmer and the other defendants arrived at some form of 
agreement.  Palmer urges that he had no opportunity to conspire inasmuch as he never discussed the clinic with the other "
1302,," defendants before they sent the letter of complaint.  Although it is true that the Center has cited no direct evidence of such a 
communication, and Dr. Palmer has denied that he spoke with the others before he called Dr. Whaley, we think the Center is 
entitled to try the issue to a jury.  We note that prior to Dr. Palmer's visit to the clinic and his call to Dr. Whaley the OB-GYN Staff 
had on two or three occasions written to the Capitol Medical Society of which Dr. Palmer is a member complaining about the 
clinic and asking the CMS to take action regarding the clinic. Moreover, it is clear that Dr. Palmer did have an opportunity to 
discuss the clinic with the defendants prior to the follow-up visit by Dr. Palmer's investigator, Mr. McCollum.  The Center 
complains that this follow-up visit could have had nothing to do with official BOME business because Palmer had ""closed"" the 
Whaley investigation and the BOME has no jurisdiction over medical institutions, as opposed to practitioners. "
1303,18," .  We agree with Judge Thornberry's observation in his concurring opinion that Dr. Palmer is not foreclosed from demonstrating 
that his call to Dr. Whaley is comprehended by the authority granted him by the legislature.  We hold only that the summary 
judgment granted in his favor cannot be sustained on the theory that the telephone call was an ""administrative warning letter"" 
within the meaning of section 458.11(8).  We do not mean to imply that Dr. Palmer cannot ultimately show ""from the nature of 
the powers and duties"" granted him, see Duke & Co. v. Foerster, 3 Cir. 1975, 521 F.2d 1277, 1280, that his call was a form of 
activity that may fairly be characterized as official action because integral to the process by which the Board or its Director 
discharges responsibilities expressly given them by the legislature.  The telephone call could come within the Parker exemption 
in the absence of express statutory authorization for it. "

1323,1," ""SCM"" is derived from the initials of the Smith-Corona Company, manufacturer of typewriters, and the Marchant Company, 
manufacturer of calculators, who merged to form the plaintiff corporation."
1323,2," ""Xerox"" is derived from the word ""xerography"" dry writing an invented name for the process of reproducing images by an 
electrophotographic process."
1323,3," Other issues raised by the pleadings concerned an SCM claim of invalidity of one Xerox patent, and Xerox claims of patent 
infringement by SCM.  These patent validity and infringement issues have been severed.  For purposes of all claims put to the 
jury, SCM assumed the validity of every Xerox patent."
1323,4," The jury, requested by Xerox, was empaneled under an agreed upon procedure whereby 14 persons were selected, none was 
designated as an alternate, and all remaining at the conclusion of the trial were permitted to deliberate provided at least six 
remained. Attrition reduced the final jury to nine members. For an interesting analysis of the composition of the jury and how the demographic characteristics of the final jury was shaped 
by the selection process, See Comment, ""Protracted Commercial Litigation and the Seventh Amendment,"" 10 Conn.L.Rev. 775 
(1978). "
1324,5," There was a substantial dispute as to whether the SCM license request in 1964 was serious and whether SCM then had the 
intention, preparedness, and capability to enter the plain paper copying field, an issue ultimately resolved against SCM by the 
jury (Question 22). But there was no dispute that a license request was made in 1964."
1324,6," Though Xerox agreed the complaint was timely with respect to the 1969 exclusion claim as against the defense of limitations, it 
presented a further defense that SCM's failure to sue at an earlier time rendered all exclusion damages barred under the 
doctrine of avoidable consequences.  See note 16, Infra."
1324,7," SCM also contended that the tolling provisions of 15 U.S.C. § 16(b) extended the limitations period back to 1965, when the 
FTC began its investigation of Xerox.  The Court concluded that the filing of the FTC complaint was the earliest relevant date for 
purposes of § 16(b).  Cf.  Greyhound Corp. v. Mt. Hood Stages, Inc., 437 U.S. 322, 98 S. Ct. 2370, 57 L. Ed. 2d 239 (1978). "
1325,8," SCM also contended that it was not limited to exclusion claims measured from either January 1, 1964, or January 1, 1969, but 
could also seek damages starting at any intermediate point that the jury found warranted by the evidence.  This contention 
became significant when the jury rejected the 1964 claim, leaving only the 1969 claim in issue.  The Court ruled that SCM had 
given the jury evidence of damages flowing from the 1964 license denial and the 1969 license denial, and had failed to present 
any evidence from which the jury could reasonably estimate what the damages would have been had SCM obtained patent 
licenses at some intermediate point.  There was no data or opinion evidence that would permit a pro rata award of damages for 
whatever portion of the 1964 exclusion claim the jury found to be established.  SCM's estimates of what would have occurred if it 
had obtained licenses in 1964 or 1969 differed in fundamental respects.  SCM estimated the production of entirely different 
machines, different market shares, different prices, and different costs.  Whether or not the 1964 and 1969 damage estimates 
were sufficiently non-speculative to permit a damage award, any estimate of damages for a period beginning at an intermediate 
point would have been wholly speculative."
1325,9," The Court permitted evidence of SCM's claimed lost profits to be presented in what was generally the liability phase of the trial 
because of Xerox's contention concerning SCM's intention to enter plain paper copying. Xerox maintained that SCM did not 
intend to enter plain paper copying in either 1964 or 1969 and offered to support this contention with evidence that if SCM had 
entered the field at either date, SCM would have suffered losses.  Since the prospect of losses was relevant in determining 
whether SCM had the requisite intent, the jury, considering the existence of intent, was entitled to hear the parties' conflicting 
claims as to whether SCM would have made profits or suffered losses.  All the evidence available at the end of 1976 and offered 
to show whether entry in 1964 or 1969 would actually have produced profits would not have been available in 1964 or 1969 to 
estimate prospectively the likelihood of profits.  However, there was substantial overlap between the bases for estimates 
available to be made prospectively in 1964 and 1969 and for estimates to be made retrospectively in 1976.  Therefore, Xerox 
was given an opportunity to prove that losses would have occurred, so that it could contend that the prospect of such losses 
would have deterred SCM in 1969 from entering plain paper copying if licenses were available."
1325,10, SCM claimed $ 40.5 million for actual losses.
1325,11," Since the jury at the end of the first stage rejected SCM's claim concerning the Fuji-Xerox 2200 and the 6740 marketing claim, 
no evidence was presented concerning the amount of damages on these claims.  The jury's findings in favor of SCM concerning 
the MUP and XCP pricing claims led to the presentation of damage evidence on these claims.  In addition, the Court concluded, 
contrary to the position taken when the first stage was concluded, to permit the jury to consider evidence of the component of 
SCM's 1969 exclusion claim concerning actual losses in the placement of 6740's.  This is not the 6740 marketing claim rejected 
by the jury in the first stage.  That claim concerned Xerox practices alleged to impair SCM's ability to place 6740's.  The 6740 
actual loss claim was that if SCM had been granted plain paper copier patent licenses in 1969, it would not have embarked on 
the 6740 program at all in the 1970's and thereby avoided all the actual losses it sustained in that venture."
1325,12," SCM claimed $ 48.2 million for loss of net going concern value.  The Court separated evidence of the net going concern value 
damages into a third stage of the trial to avoid the risk of prejudice to Xerox when the jury considered the amount of lost profits 
under the 1969 exclusion claim.  Since the net going concern value claim was of exceedingly doubtful validity, it seemed "
1326,," advisable to avoid the risk that the jury might assess that claim and the lost profits claim together and reach a compromise that 
might be based on an invalid theory."
1326,13," See Vandercook & Son, Inc. v. Thorpe, 344 F.2d 930, 931 n. 2 (5th Cir. 1965), indicating ""the desirability of using special 
interrogatories under Fed.R.Civ.P. 49(a) with a general charge where distinctive, or doubtful (or both), theories are at issue, or 
where the law is in a state of flux."" See generally, Brown, ""Federal Special Verdicts: The Doubt Eliminator,"" 44 F.R.D. 338 
(1967)."
1326,14," Three differences should be noted.  First, though the evidence concerning the amount of lost profits in the 1969 exclusion 
claim was presented in the first stage, the decision-making as to quantification of this component of the 1969 exclusion claim 
occurred at the end of the second stage.  (Questions 50 and 51). See footnote 9, Supra.  Second, though evidence of proximate 
cause was presented in the first stage, decision-making on several proximate cause issues was deferred until the second stage 
so that the jury would have evidence of the amount of damage when deciding whether any damages were proximately caused 
by wrongful conduct. Proximate cause issues submitted to the jury in the second stage concerned the MUP and XCP pricing 
plans (Questions 52, 54, and 57) and the 6740 actual loss component of the 1969 exclusion claim (Question 59).  Third, though 
evidence concerning the XCP pricing plan was presented in the first stage, the violation questions submitted to the jury at the 
end of the first stage concerning the pricing plan issues (Questions 43-47) and the jury's responses left in doubt the jury's view of 
the XCP plan.  Therefore, a separate question as to whether the XCP plan was a law violation was submitted at the end of the 
second stage (Question 56). "
1327,15," The substantive questions concerning some aspects of the 1964 exclusion claim were submitted to the jury, notwithstanding 
the jury's rejection of SCM's 1964 relevant market contentions, for two reasons.  First, additional fact-finding by the jury offered 
the prospect of determining whether necessary elements of the 1964 exclusion claim were established wholly apart from the 
relevant market contentions.  As it happened, the negative answer concerning SCM's intention, preparedness, and capability to 
enter plain paper copying in 1964 eliminated the 1964 claim, regardless of the relevant market issues and regardless of any 
SCM contention concerning the correctness of the charge on issues of violation. Second, this course created the opportunity to 
secure additional jury fact-finding in the event a reviewing court were to disagree with the relevant market findings as a matter of 
law.  Had the jury found in favor of SCM on the intention element and also on the questions to be answered if intention had been 
proven, the Court would then have had the opportunity, after all other fact-finding was completed (when no prejudice to other 
fact-finding could be claimed), to ask the jury to answer the withdrawn 1964 violation questions on the assumption that the 
relevant market as claimed by SCM existed in 1964.  The appropriateness of what amounts to hypothetical jury fact-finding is of 
course open to question, but it is not without some precedent, See Foster v. Maldonado, 433 F.2d 348 (3d Cir. 1970) (jury told to 
assess wrongful death damages under two alternative rules of law where choice of law rule is uncertain); United States v. 
371.94 Acres of Land, 431 F.2d 975, 978 n. 3 (6th Cir. 1970) (jury returned alternative verdicts on land valuations using different 
factual assumptions), and would certainly have been worth the additional few days of jury time in order to try to avoid retrial in a 
case of such extended length."
1327,16," Xerox made two contentions to the jury concerning its defense of avoidable consequences.  First Xerox contended that SCM 
could reasonably have avoided all 1969 exclusion damages by litigating Xerox's right to maintain its patent portfolio unlicensed 
in 1963. At that time, Xerox had sued SCM for patent infringement with respect to SCM's coated paper copiers, and SCM had 
counterclaimed for a declaration that Xerox's patents were unenforceable by reason of antitrust law violations, substantially the 
same contention urged in this suit.  The 1963 lawsuit was settled without prejudice with SCM taking licenses for coated paper 
copier applications.  Xerox urged the jury to find in this suit that if its patent portfolio was unenforceable because of antitrust 
violations as SCM claimed, SCM could have avoided all its exclusion claim damages by continuing the 1963 suit or initiating a 
new suit in 1964.  The jury's answer to Question 34 upheld this defense. Xerox also contended that, if its conduct violated the antitrust laws and made its patents unenforceable, SCM could reasonably 
have avoided all exclusion damages by determining for itself that the Xerox patents were unenforceable and entering into plain 
paper copying with the confidence that Xerox infringement suits would be unsuccessful.  The jury rejected this defense 
(Question 33). "
1328,17," The parties and the Court have agreed that consideration of any entitlement to equitable relief and to attorney's fees should 
be deferred until after appellate review of a judgment, entered pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b), adjudicating the claims for money 
damages. "
1331,18," The parties disputed whether a § 1 violation could be based on an agreement between entities in the relationship of the 
members of the Xerox family of companies.  SCM contended that an agreement can violate § 1 if made by any two separate 
entities, regardless of whether they are actual or potential competitors and regardless of their inter-corporate affiliation.  Reliance 
was placed on cases such as Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. International Parts Corp., 392 U.S. 134, 141-42, 88 S. Ct. 1981, 20 L. 
Ed. 2d 982 (1968), and United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 332 U.S. 218, 67 S. Ct. 1560, 91 L. Ed. 2010 (1947). Xerox contended 
that a § 1 violation cannot exist in the absence of an agreement between parties who are actual or potential competitors and 
hold themselves out as such.  Reliance was placed on United States v. Citizens & Southern National Bank, 422 U.S. 86, 116, 95 
S. Ct. 2099, 45 L. Ed. 2d 41 (1975), and Beckman v. Walter Kidde & Co., 316 F. Supp. 1321 (E.D.N.Y.1970), Aff'd, 451 F.2d 593 
(2d Cir. 1971). To provide a factual predicate for resolving the dispute as to whether parties to a § 1 agreement must be actual or potential 
competitors, the jury was asked questions about the competitive status of some of the entities involved.  SCM made no claim 
that the entities were in actual competition; so the questions asked whether the entities were potential competitors as of certain 
pertinent dates.  SCM made no claim that Battelle was a potential competitor of Xerox's.  The jury concluded that Xerox and the 
Rank Organisation were not potential competitors in 1956 when Rank-Xerox was formed (Question 12), that Fuji Photo Film was 
a potential competitor of either Xerox or Rank-Xerox in 1960 when Fuji-Xerox was formed (Question 13), and that Xerox, Rank-
Xerox, and Fuji-Xerox were not potential competitors in either 1964 or 1969, when SCM claimed concerted license denials 
(Questions 14 and 14a). "
1332,19," SCM contended that the § 1 finding of no agreement to exclude others from plain paper copying (Questions 18 and 18a) was 
inconsistent with the § 2 finding that as of 1969 there existed a conspiracy among Xerox, the Rank Organisation, Rank-Xerox, 
Fuji Photo Film, and Fuji-Xerox to acquire or maintain monopoly power in the convenience office copier market and plain paper 
copier sub-market (Question 9a).  SCM urged that since the power to exclude is a test of monopoly power, the conspiracy 
finding necessarily meant that the Xerox companies agreed to acquire or maintain the power to exclude, which, SCM contended, 
was the equivalent of agreeing to exclude.  Xerox replied that no inconsistency necessarily existed, in light of Xerox's argument 
to the jury. Xerox had contended primarily that there was no conspiracy to acquire or maintain monopoly power, but had also 
urged, alternatively, that if such a conspiracy existed, it was limited to an agreement to allocate world-wide territories among the 
Xerox companies and thereby exclude only the Xerox companies from specified territories of the world.  If the jury based its 
conspiracy finding on this aspect of the companies' arrangement, Xerox contended, the finding did not indicate an agreement to 
exclude all others from plain paper copying. (Tr. 44,631-36).  The Court declined to find that the verdicts were inconsistent.  (Tr. 
44,645-46)."
1332,20," SCM also contended that Xerox violated § 2 by attempting to monopolize and conspiring to monopolize.  The jury found that 
Xerox was a member of a conspiracy to monopolize the relevant markets as of 1969 (Question 9a), but rejected SCM's 
contention that Xerox had the specific intent to acquire or maintain monopoly power (Questions 7a and 10a), thereby rejecting a 
necessary element of both the attempt and conspiracy violations of § 2. "

not the inventor.  Picard v. United Aircraft Corp., 128 F.2d 632, 642 (2d Cir. 1942) (concurring opinion)."
1334,24," This case raises no issue concerning antitrust violations based on anti-competitive uses of patents obtained by fraud upon the 
Patent Office.  See Walker Process Equipment, Inc. v. Food Machinery & Chemical Corp., 382 U.S. 172, 86 S. Ct. 347, 15 L. Ed.

1335,26," This would not be the first time a purpose of the patent laws has been vindicated by imposing upon another body of law a 
limitation deemed to be necessary by the general body of patent law, rather than a specific patent law provision.  In Lear, Inc. v. 
Adkins, 395 U.S. 653, 89 S. Ct. 1902, 23 L. Ed. 2d 610 (1969), the Supreme Court imposed upon state contract law a prohibition 
against estoppel of a licensee to contest the validity of the licensed patent. Though operating to limit the contracting freedom of 
the patentee, Lear promotes a purpose of the patent laws by eliminating an impediment to an attack on an invalid patent. "
1336,," Nor would it be the first time the antitrust laws have been limited in order to achieve objectives safeguarded by another body of 
law.  When the competitive purposes of the antitrust laws have collided with the protective purposes of the labor laws, the 
Supreme Court has relied not only on the specific exemption of § 6 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 17, but also on the 
""nonstatutory exemption (that) has its source in the strong labor policy favoring the association of employees to eliminate 
competition over wages and working conditions."" Connell Construction Co. v. Plumbers Local 100, 421 U.S. 616, 622, 95 S. Ct. 
1830, 1835, 44 L. Ed. 2d 418 (1975)."
1336,27," The distinction need not necessarily be applied to all damage liability.  What is at issue in SCM's 1969 exclusion claim is 
damage liability for the profits a potential competitor would have made had it been granted the right to use a monopolist's 
patents. That is a very different claim, for example, from a claim by a monopolist's customer that it has been forced by a 
restrictive marketing practice (availability only on long-term leasing) to pay excessive prices for the use of a monopolist's 
patented products.  See Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 392 U.S. 481, 88 S. Ct. 2224, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1231 
(1968). And it differs from the claim of a monopolist's competitor who has suffered loss of sales and lawsuit expenses because 
of an infringement action brought by the monopolist, without knowledge of the details of the competitor's product, to drive the 
competitor out of business.  Kobe, Inc. v. Dempsey Pump Co., 198 F.2d 416 (10th Cir. 1952). Damage claims of this sort do not 
suggest damage liability for a unilateral refusal to license patents. "
1337,28," It must be acknowledged that if equitable relief is warranted to require prospective licensing of a patent acquired in violation of 
§ 7, or if an injunction against an infringer is withheld, the acquirer may well suffer monetary injury to the extent that he loses the 
exclusive right to profits he would otherwise enjoy for the life of the acquired patent. But as a matter of business reality, there is a 
world of difference between foregoing future profits and being obliged to pay damages retrospectively for the profits a competitor 
claims he would have made.  Moreover, it is inconceivable that an equitable remedy of royalty-free compulsory licensing would 
be entered for a § 7 violation until long after the investment in developing the patented invention had been recouped."
1337,29," Since the jury found that the relevant market and sub-market did not exist as of January, 1964, but did exist as of January, 
1969, the foreseeability issue was put to the jury with two elements.  The jury was told to consider the earliest time after January, 
1964, that the market or sub-market came into existence and then consider whether a market or sub-market as of such earliest 
time was reasonable foreseeable at the time of the acquisitions. SCM has contended that the evidence warranted the entry of 
summary judgment in its favor on the contention that a relevant market and sub-market existed as of January, 1964.  Even if that 
contention were sound, the foreseeability issue as to a future market would remain in the case, since SCM did not claim that a 
relevant market or sub-market existed at the time of the acquisitions. "
1338,30, SCM makes no claim that the flat plate equipment or the copy-flo equipment could be considered a convenience office copier.
1338,31," No issue was submitted to the jury as to whether the holding of the acquired patents was a proximate cause of SCM's not 
entering into plain paper copying in 1969.  As SCM contends, there was no fact-finding to be done concerning this issue.  If the 
holding of the patents created a duty under § 7 to license them, then the failure to license was a proximate cause of the 
damages due to the loss of profits the jury found SCM would have earned had it been granted licenses. (Questions 50 and 51).  
That conclusion follows once the jury determined that as of January, 1969, SCM had the intention, preparedness, and capability 
to enter plain paper copying. (Question 22a). "
1339,32," This situation is to be contrasted with ITT Continental Baking, where after entry of a consent decree prohibiting acquisitions in 
specific product lines, defendant was held liable for daily fines for subsequent acquisitions in violation of the decree. "
1340,33," This gap in SCM's proof makes it unnecessary to consider several Xerox contentions concerning the claim based on patents 
acquired from Battelle after 1959.  First, Xerox relies on the jury's answer to Question 35, finding, as Xerox contended, that it 
was not possible to make a commercially reliable xerographic plain paper copier prior to March 11, 1969, without infringing the 
Carlson ""699 patent. Xerox contends that since the lack of this single patent, acquired by Xerox in 1956, prevented SCM from 
manufacturing a non-infringing product until a date after January, 1969, SCM cannot complain of lack of post-1959 patents and 
receive damages for the profits it claims it would have made starting with use of the Xerox patents in January, 1969. Second, Xerox contends that the acquisition of the post-1959 patents from Battelle could not be a violation of § 1 (or § 7) 
because all xerographic research at Battelle after 1955 was sponsored by Xerox, and the sponsor, having taken the risk of 
investing in the research, was entitled to the results. Third, Xerox contends, as it has with respect to all the patents acquired pursuant to the 1956 agreement, that the evidence is 
insufficient to support a verdict that, without the agreement, Battelle would have caused the patents to be sub-licensed for plain 
paper copying to others including SCM, or at least that such a conclusion is against the weight of the evidence. "
1342,34," The suggested standard is considered and apparently disapproved by Areeda and Turner, III Antitrust Law, supra, § 706b, 
either because a case meeting the standard would be ""hard to find"" or because the various motivations of an inventor are so 
inextricably intertwined that the search for an improper motivation is not worth making.  But see Turner, ""The Patent System and 
Competitive Policy,"" 44 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 450, 455 (1969): ""(T)he patent system has at times induced the use of research resources 
solely for the purpose of providing blocking patents."" "
1343,35," Since this Court has concluded that the 1956 Battelle agreement cannot create damage liability under §§ 1 or 7, that 
conclusion may preclude damage liability under § 2 based on that agreement alone.  However, the claim for damages under § 2 
needs to be explored because a reviewing court may conclude that the 1956 agreement supports liability for damages, or 
violates §§ 1 or 7 but supports liability only for prospective equitable relief. Even if the 1956 agreement is not itself a violation of 
any antitrust provision, it might be some evidence of willful acquisition of monopoly power. If damage liability under § 2 for a 
refusal to license is not warranted under any view of the facts of this case, that conclusion would eliminate the need for a retrial 
to determine whether any conduct other than the 1956 agreement creates damage liability under § 2 for the 1969 license refusal."
1343,36," SCM also alleged that willful acquisition and maintenance of monopoly power could be inferred from the arrangements 
between Xerox and its family of companies.  Even though the jury rejected SCM's contention that these companies made an 
agreement to exclude all others from plain paper copying (Question 18), the jury may have accepted SCM's contention that 
these companies divided the world into exclusive territories for marketing purposes.  That conduct, if found to have occurred, 
See note 19, Supra, would primarily injure consumers denied the availability of more competing suppliers, rather than a potential 
market entrant, like SCM, who might be better off if insulated in the United States from the competition of Rank-Xerox and Fuji-
Xerox. "
1344,37," This appears to be the standard urged by SCM.  Its Request to Charge No. § 2-64 read: ""If you find that Xerox engaged in 
any restrictive, exclusionary or anti-competitive conduct which contributed to its achievement or maintenance of monopoly 
power, then on that basis you must also find that Xerox's refusals to grant a license were themselves each in violation of Section 
2 of the Sherman Act."""
1344,38," The submission of additional interrogatories to resolve a possible inconsistency in special verdicts raised an issue under 
Fed.R.Civ.P. 49, which specifically authorizes further jury deliberation when an inconsistency arises in the use of special verdicts 
accompanied by a general verdict, Rule 49(b), but omits such authority when only special verdicts are used, Rule 49(a).  See 
Griffin v. Matherne, 471 F.2d 911, 917 n. 6 (5th Cir. 1973). Whatever the practice may be under Rule 49(a) in a trial of normal 
duration, further jury deliberation rather than retrial seemed warranted to reach the objectives of Rule 1.  (Tr. 44,644-45). "
1345,39," No issue was submitted to the jury as to whether the refusal to license in 1969 was a proximate cause of SCM's not entering 
into plain paper copying. As was the case with SCM's ""holding"" theory under § 7, See note 31, Supra, if § 2 required licensing, 
then the failure to license was a proximate cause of SCM's lost profits.  The only factual issue concerning causation was raised 
by Xerox's defense that the license refusal did not ""cause"" losses because SCM could reasonably have avoided any losses by 
entering the market with its own infringing products and then asserting as a defense to the infringement suit the same § 2 claims 
it asserts now.  The jury rejected this defense (Question 33). "
1346,40," See Special Equipment Co. v. Coe, 324 U.S. 370, 65 S. Ct. 741, 89 L. Ed. 1006 (1945); Hartford-Empire Co. v. United States, 
Supra, 323 U.S. at 432, 65 S. Ct. at 395 (""A patent owner . . .  has no obligation either to use (the patented invention) or to grant 
its use to others.""); Continental Paper Bag Co. v. Eastern Paper Bag Co., 210 U.S. 405, 28 S. Ct. 748, 52 L. Ed. 1122 (1908); 
Bement v. National Harrow Co., Supra, 186 U.S. at 90, 22 S. Ct. 747. "
1349,41," The appropriateness of equitable relief, if any is reasonably required beyond the terms of the FTC consent decree, can best 
be considered after the Court of Appeals, upon the inevitable appeal from the judgment disallowing money damages, has an 
opportunity to determine on this fully developed record whether any violations, creating liability at least for equitable remedies, 
have been validly found. "
1350,42, Xerox agreed to discontinue MUP as part of the FTC consent decree.  That fact was not presented to the jury.
1350,43," SCM made no claim that XCP was a tying arrangement in violation of § 3 of the Clayton Act, but did claim that Xerox used 
XCP to foreclose competition or gain a substantial competitive advantage in violation of § 2.  The jury rejected this contention. 
(Question 56)."
1350,44," [***293]  Similarly, Xerox low speed machines were available at the MUP discount rate without any requirement that Xerox 
high speed machines also be obtained.  However, as is true with any volume discount, MUP was attractive only to large volume 
customers, and most of Xerox's high volume customers did most of their photocopy work on high speed machines. Thus MUP 
was attractive to many users of high speed machines. But it remained true in theory, though unlikely in practice, that any 
customer who anticipated using Xerox low speed machines at enough different locations to produce substantial aggregate 
volume could obtain the MUP discount rate by using only Xerox low speed machines. "
1351,45," Both of these decisions must be extended somewhat to support SCM's claim.  In both cases the factual contexts showed that 
the tying product, though available without the tied product, was not available on equally favorable terms.  In this case, the 
allegedly tying product (high speed machine) is available on precisely the same terms, with or without the allegedly tied product 
(low speed machine); the factual context indicates at most that some customers feel coerced to take the low speed machines 
because they anticipate that their high speed machine billing will not be sufficient to qualify for the MUP discount rate, or 
because they are uncertain during the billing year whether their high speed billing volume will be sufficient."
1351,46," There is a further problem with considering MUP a sufficiently coercive arrangement to violate either § 3 of the Clayton Act or 
§ 2 of the Sherman Act. This appears if consideration is given to two groups of MUP customers who used Xerox low speed 
machines: willing users, who preferred Xerox low speed machines to competitors' machines, and unwilling users, who preferred 
competitors' machines, but used Xerox low speed machines to meet their MUP commitment level.  The unwilling user of Xerox 
low speed machines can realistically be said to have been coerced by the MUP pricing plan.  Of course, if he really wanted to 
use coated paper copiers for his low volume work, he had a free choice that would have enabled him to switch his low volume 
work to coated paper copiers: all he had to do was increase his volume on high speed machines until he reached his MUP 
commitment level.  That may not have seemed to the customer to be a sensible option, since it would have meant making 
copies he probably did not need.  However, if the multiple model usage feature of MUP is condemned under the antitrust laws, 
this same customer is left in exactly the same situation.  Since his high speed volume does not quite entitle him to the MUP 
discount, and if Xerox is prohibited from permitting him to meet his MUP commitment on more than one model, then the 
customer must increase his high speed machine volume in order to get the MUP discount. But what about the willing customer of Xerox low speed machines if MUP is prohibited under the antitrust laws? He would like to 
complete his MUP commitment by using Xerox low speed machines, because he prefers them to coated paper copiers. If Xerox 
cannot permit him to count low speed machine volume toward his MUP billing, then he too must make unneeded copies on his 
high speed machines in order to get the MUP discount.  He will be coerced to do something unwanted if MUP is changed to 
preclude multiple model usage, whereas he is not coerced at all so long as he has the freedom to select the models on which he 
will meet his MUP commitment. In addition to this anomaly, there is the undeniable fact that even if MUP had a coercive effect upon some Xerox customers, it 
also afforded many others a freedom of choice that would not have existed without MUP: the freedom to select any one model or 
any combination of models of Xerox machines for the volume necessary to obtain the MUP discount. Of course, this would not be the first paradox created by the antitrust laws, but courts should at least hesitate before condemning 
practices that increase a customer's freedom of choice. Perhaps it would nevertheless be appropriate to condemn MUP under 
the antitrust laws on the theory that any restriction on the free choice of some customers is outweighed by the assumed benefit 
to all customers if the absence of MUP leads to more competition between Xerox low speed machines and competitive 
machines, and if this competition in turn leads to lower prices. "
1352,47," Apart from the claim that MUP had a coercive effect on some users of Xerox low speed machines and thereby violated § 2 as 
an unlawful competitive advantage, SCM also alleged that MUP violated § 2 because it was used selectively, and not 
announced to the public as a generally available pricing plan.  To the extent that was true, the principal injury was suffered by 
Xerox customers who were eligible for MUP but did not receive its benefits."
1352,48," While SCM's methodology was based on all post-1967 cancellations of Xerox low speed machines, the Court ruled that 
damages for placements lost prior to January 1, 1969, were barred by the statute of limitations.  (Tr. 44,839-48). "
1353,49," Presumably some mix of factors caused non-MUP users of 813's to cancel in 1968 at a rate below the 1967 rate for all 813's. 
Similarly, some mix of factors, including MUP, presumably caused MUP users of 813's to cancel in 1968 at a rate below the 
1967 rate for all 813's.  Xerox's evidence suggested that among the factors causing some of the decline in the MUP 813 
cancellation rate were a price increase for 813's in 1967 that raised the cancellation rate to an unusually high level and a post-
1967 tendency of many customers to upgrade from Xerox 813's to Xerox 660's."
1353,50," As SCM's witness in support of its MUP damage methodology conceded, ""I'm quite sure that in every one of those numbers 
(cancellation rates for different years) there are elements that have some effect on competitive cancellation rates, but I don't 
have any way to separate out each of the elements."" (Tr. 45,302). "
1354,51," SCM's defense to the infringement claim based on patent misuse was not severed from the antitrust claims, since that 
defense raises the identical issues raised by the antitrust claims.  It will be time enough to consider whether any Xerox conduct 
warrants withholding of infringement remedies after appellate review of the rulings made herein, in the event the infringement 
claims are pursued."
1354,52," The jury's findings rejected all of these claims, except the MUP marketing claim, thereby eliminating any possible claim for 
equitable remedies.  As to the MUP marketing claim, even if a violation occurred, the abandonment of the plan pursuant to the 
FTC decree, See note 42, Supra, eliminates any possible claim for an equitable remedy."
1354,53," Surely the record has been sufficiently developed to avoid an obstacle to § 1292(b) review encountered in other 
circumstances. See Gottesman v. General Motors Corp., supra, 414 F.2d at 958. If the Court of Appeals should conclude that any issue of fact necessary for decision of any issue of law in this case was 
submitted to the jury under a prejudicially incorrect legal standard or was otherwise improperly determined, it is respectfully 
suggested that the Court consider the appropriateness of subsequent district court fact-finding on such issue, without a jury, 
either on the present record, or with such additions or deletions as the Court of Appeals may order in light of its consideration of 
evidentiary rulings.  See Memorex Corp. v. IBM Corp., 458 F. Supp. 423 (N.D.Cal.1978) (court fact-finding after jury 
disagreement in complex case); Bernstein v. Universal Pictures, Inc., 79 F.R.D. 59 (S.D.N.Y.1978) (jury disallowed in complex 
case); In re U. S. Financial Securities Litigation, 75 F.R.D. 702 (S.D.Cal.1977) (same); In re Boise Cascade Securities Litigation,

1356,*," The reference to the Glidden merger in Questions 30 and 31 resulted from Xerox's contentions concerning SCM's 1967 
acquistion of the Glidden Co.  Xerox contended that SCM would not have been able or willing to continue a plain paper copying 
venture and to acquire Glidden, and would therefore either have ended the plain paper copier venture and pursued the Glidden 
opportunity or continued with plain paper copying and passed up the Glidden opportunity.  Xerox further contended that SCM 
made more profits from the Glidden merger than it would have made in plain paper copying and was therefore not damaged 
even if excluded from plain paper copying in 1964.  Questions 30 and 31 were framed to elicit jury fact-finding on SCM's profits 
under the 1964 exclusion claim in the event these Xerox contentions were legally insufficient. "

1366,5," The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System filed in this appeal the same Amicus curiae brief submitted in support

1367,6," We recognize that other courts, in other contexts, have held that an insurance company's inducing persons to become 
policyholders is part of the business of insurance. E. g., Dexter v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc'y, 527 F.2d 233 (2 Cir. 1975) 
(antitrust action challenging Equitable's requirement that plaintiff purchase life insurance as precondition to granting mortgage 
loans); Addrisi v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc'y, 503 F.2d 725 (9 Cir. 1974), Cert. denied, 421 U.S. 922, 95 S. Ct. 1590, 43 L. 
Ed. 2d 790 (1975) (same). However, in these cases the inducement was actually a requirement, and forcing prospective 
policyholders to buy insurance cannot be equated with making the purchase ""easier"" by offering premium financing. Moreover, if 
this ""inducement"" rationale were applied in the financing context, the activities of any lender who engages in premium financing 
would constitute the ""business of insurance."" We have rejected such a result in Cochran v. Paco, Inc., supra, and application of 
the ""inducement"" theory in the instant case would make the McCarran Act's applicability turn on Who is engaged in premium 
financing rather than on the Nature of that activity."

Panacea?, 5 The Forum 339, 340 (1970); Appendix, excerpts (9), (10), (12). "
1370,9," The Supreme Court enumerated the two ways in which Congress gave its support to existing and future state systems for 
regulating and taxing the business of insurance: One (way) was by removing obstructions which might be thought to flow from its own power, whether dormant or exercised, 
except as otherwise expressly provided in the Act itself or in future legislation. The other was by declaring expressly and 
affirmatively that continued state regulation and taxation of this business is in the public interest and that the business and all 
who engage in it ""shall be subject to' the laws of the several states in these respects. Prudential Ins. Co. v. Benjamin, 1946, 328 U.S. 408, 429-30, 66 S. Ct. 1142, 1155, 90 L. Ed. 1342, 1360. See Appendix, 
excerpts (11), (12), (18)."
1370,10," See, for example, the following remarks of Senator Ferguson: If there is on the books of the United States a legislative act which relates to interstate commerce, if the act does not specifically 
relate to insurance, it would not apply at the present time. Having passed the bill now before the Senate, If Congress should 
tomorrow pass a law relating to interstate commerce, and should not specifically apply the law to the business of insurance, it 
would not be an implied repeal of this bill (the McCarran Act), and this bill would not be affected, because the Congress had not, 
under subdivision (2)(b), said that the new law specifically applied to insurance. I think that makes the bill very clear."
1370,91," Cong.Rec. 481 (Jan. 25, 1945) (emphasis added). See also Appendix, excerpts (1), (2), (4)-(7), (22). Although the Court rejects it, I think it helpful to give a detailed answer to the contention made by the Federal Reserve Board in 
its amicus brief which states: An examination of the legislative history of the McCarran-Ferguson Act indicates that Congress originally intended that (the) 
McCarran-Ferguson Act's prohibition of Federal preemption of State laws regulating the business of insurance only be applicable 
to insurance-related activities otherwise within the purview of Federal antitrust laws. The (state) Act under consideration most 
certainly is not an antitrust statute. . . . (W)hen Congress spoke of State regulation of the business of insurance, it was concerned with the States' regulating what 
would have been covered potentially by the Federal antitrust laws. Amicus brief at 16-18. The Board is asserting that TIL should apply because the only state regulatory legislation within the purview of the McCarran Act 
is that correspondent to the federal antitrust laws. As does the Court, I reject this contention as totally without merit. The plain 
words of the Act itself are dispositive on this score. For example, state tax laws relating to the business of insurance are 
expressly covered by 15 U.S.C.A. §§ 1011, 1012(a), (b). Tax laws, as far as we known, have nothing to do with antitrust laws. 
And if the plain words of the statute were not enough, the remarks of Senator Ferguson quoted above and those of other 
Congressmen set forth in the Appendix (see excerpts (1), (2), (5), (7), (11), (12), (14), (16), (17), (18), (19), (20), (22), (24)) 
should dispel all doubts. Moreover, § 4 of the McCarran Act, 15 U.S.C.A. § 1014, which makes the National Labor Relations Act 
and the Fair Labor Standards Act specifically applicable to the business of insurance serves as a further demonstration of a 
crystal clear intent that Congressional silence meant the states were free to regulate insurance in areas having no relationship to 
antitrust. "
1371,11," Both S.Rep.No.1112 and H.Rep.No.873 related to an earlier version of the Act, H.R. 3270. See generally Note, A Year of 
S.E.U.A., 23 Chi.Kent L.Rev. 317 (1945); Comment, Federal Regulation of Insurance Companies: The Disappearing McCarran

1371,12," 15 U.S.C.A. § 1014 provides: S 1014. Applicability of National Labor Relations Act and Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to affect in any manner the application to the business of insurance of the 
Act of July 5, 1935, as amended, known as the National Labor Relations Act, or the Act of June 25, 1938, as amended, known 
as the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, or the Act of June 5, 1920, known as the Merchant Marine Act, 1920. "

1372,13," This Circuit has recently applied the ""not peculiar"" test in a factual situation far different from the one presently before us. In 
Royal Drug Co. v. Group Life & Health Ins. Co., 5 Cir., 1977, 556 F.2d 1375, the Court held that an agreement between a group 
insurer providing prescription drugs and participating pharmacies did not constitute the business of insurance for McCarran Act 
purposes. The Court, relying on National Securities, cited American for the ""not peculiar"" holding.  Id. at 1386. Nothing we say 
here is inconsistent with Royal which did not involve a direct insurer-insured relationship."
1372,14," For an appraisal of Gerlach, see Krischer, ""Truth"" in Insurance Premium Financing, 30 Business Lawyer 969, 973-74 (1975). "
1373,15," The legislative history of the Act is less extensive in areas outside the antitrust sphere and understandably so. South-Eastern, 
after all, was an antitrust case and Congressional debate focused primarily on reversing its effects. See, for example, the Senate 
debate on the Conference Report attached as an Appendix to the dissent of Judge Godbold in Crawford v. American Title Ins. 
Co., 5 Cir., 1975, 518 F.2d 217, 230-36."
1373,16," The argument to the contrary seems to be that McCarran antitrust cases address primarily two issues: (i) Is the activity within 
the business of insurance? and (ii) To what extent is the business regulated by state law? On the other hand, in non-antitrust 
cases, Perry argues, a third issue must be decided, namely, does the application of the relevant federal law ""invalidate, impair, 
or supersede"" the state law? From this, Perry asserts that the antitrust cases defining ""regulate"" cannot be read in a vacuum 
apart from the cases construing ""invalidate, impair, or supersede."" For reasons addressed hereinafter, we do not believe that the 
District Court was guilty of this analytical mistake. See Part III-C, Infra. "
1374,17," The cases cited by Perry to support the proposition that credit disclosure is not the business of insurance are inapposite: 
Hamilton Life Ins. Co. v. Republic Nat'l Life Ins. Co., S.D.N.Y., 1968, 291 F. Supp. 225, Aff'd, 2 Cir., 1969, 408 F.2d 606; Hart v. 
Orion Ins. Co., 10 Cir., 1971, 453 F.2d 1358; Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. All States Life Ins. Co., 5 Cir., 1957, 246 F.2d 161; United 
States v. Sylvanus, 7 Cir., 1951, 192 F.2d 96 (McCarran Act not a defense to indictment for use of mails to defraud in the sale of 
insurance policies); Hill v. National Auto Glass Co., N.D.Cal., 1968, 293 F. Supp. 295; Fry v. John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co., 
N.D.Tex., 1973, 355 F. Supp. 1151; American Family Life Assurance Co. v. Planned Marketing Assoc., E.D.Va., 1974, 389 F. 
Supp. 1141. Of these cases only Hart and Fry involved a direct relationship between the insured and the insurer. In Hart, the 
plaintiff sought to invoke the arbitration provision in his policy and the Court held that the states involved did not regulate the 
business of insurance. 453 F.2d at 1360. The Court never reached the question whether arbitration constituted the business of 
insurance. Fry is equally unhelpful to Perry since the District Court later reversed itself in light of Addrisi, supra, in an opinion 
which unfortunately was not published, Civil No. CA-2-1301, N.D.Tex., Amarillo Div., June 5, 1975."
1374,18," Ala.Code tit. 28A, § 227(1) provides: The purpose of this chapter is to regulate trade practices in the business of insurance in accordance with the intent of congress 
as expressed in the act of congress of March 9, 1945 (Public Law 15, 79th Congress (ch. 20, 59 U.S.Stat. at Large 33).) by 
defining, Or providing for the determination of, all such practices in this state which constitute unfair methods of competition or 
unfair or deceptive acts or practices and by prohibiting the trade practices so defined Or determined. (Emphasis added.) It is obvious that the Alabama Legislature meant to cover not only those acts it specifically proscribed but 
those determined by the Insurance Commissioner to be unfair or deceptive at a subsequent date. "
1375,19," . § 247(2) provides for instigation of court proceedings: (2) If such report charges a violation of this trade practices law and if such method of competition, act or practice has not been 
discontinued, the commissioner may, through the attorney general of this state, at any time after thirty (30) days after the service 
of such report, cause a petition to be filed in the circuit court of this state within the circuit wherein the person resides or has his 
principal place of business, to enjoin and restrain such person from engaging in such method, act or practice. The court shall 
have jurisdiction of the proceeding and shall have power to make and enter appropriate orders in connection therewith and to 
issue such writs as are ancillary to its jurisdiction or are necessary in its judgment to prevent injury to the public pendente lite."
1375,20," Ala.Code tit. 28A, § 321 reads in part: (1) No basic insurance policy or annuity contract form, or application form where written application is required and is to be made 
part of the policy or contract, or printed rider or endorsement form or form of renewal certificate, shall be delivered, or issued for 
delivery in this state, unless the form has been filed with and approved by the commissioner."
1375,21," Under § 322, the Commissioner may disapprove the forms on several grounds, three of which are relevant here: (i) if the form 
violates or fails to comply with Title 28A; (ii) if it has any title, heading, or other indication of its provisions which is misleading; 
and (iii) if it contains provisions which are unfair, inequitable, or contrary to the public policy of Alabama or which would, because 
such provisions are unclear or deceptively worded, encourage misrepresentation."
1375,22," These guidelines, which delineate the purposes they were designed to serve, are set forth in full: JANUARY 1, 1971 Effective January 15, 1971 SUBJECT: GUIDELINES TO BE FOLLOWED BY COMPANIES OFFERING LIFE INSURANCE PLANS TO COLLEGE 
STUDENTS UNDER A PREMIUM FINANCING ARRANGEMENT Proceeding under the assurance that a Life Insurance Plan sold to a College Student is: (a) A good source of business for life insurance companies. (b) A good plan on which young people can establish a sound financial insurance program. It is felt, nevertheless, that this type of program presents certain areas of concern, particularly in the presentation of the policy 
when a premium financing arrangement is offered in connection with the sale of it. In hope of strengthening this type of marketing procedure and at the same time offering additional safeguards for the protection 
of this segment of the insurance buying public, the following guidelines and procedures will be adopted by all companies and 
their agents offering this type policy in this state."
1375,1," . If the insured is a minor and executes a promissory note for the payment of the first year's premium, such note must be co-
signed by the insured's parent, legal guardian, or adult spouse. "
1376,2," . The giving of a promissory note in connection with the first premium must be set out in the application over the applicant's 
signature, showing the amount of the note, and the amount of any down payment made to an agent at the time of sale. (Note It 
is strongly recommended by this office that a down payment be required as a prudent procedure.)"
1376,3," . If a note is taken to finance less than the full first year premium, the balance must be paid by the applicant at the time the 
application is taken."
1376,4," . This down payment must be paid by the applicant in cash or by valid executed note and any payment, directly or indirectly, by 
the agent under any circumstances shall be construed to be a rebate or special inducement."
1376,5," . A copy of the note and any assignment must be attached to the policy, or in lieu thereof, the policy may contain a provision or 
endorsement which describes such financing arrangement."
1376,6," . Upon delivery, a policy receipt or acceptance form must be executed which recites that: (a) The policy has been issued as represented (b) The insured acknowledges and understands the provisions and obligations of the financial indebtedness that he has 
incurred."
1376,7," . Such receipt or acceptance form (outlined in Item 6 above) should be registered by number (preferably corresponding to 
policy number) in the home office. (a) This receipt must be sent with the policy at time of delivery Only. (b) These receipts or acceptance forms shall not be made available as supplies to field representatives or agents but must be 
furnished from the Home Office in transmittal of the policy to the writing agent."
1376,8," . Promissory notes should not be sold or otherwise transferred by the payee (agent), nor any commissions on the sale paid to 
the agent until such form (outlined in Item 7 above) has been received in the Home Office of the Company."
1376,9," . The note purchaser, assignee, or company shall notify the note maker (Insured) and all co-makers regarding the purchase or 
transfer of the note, After such purchase or transfer, inviting any questions relative to the note, or the policy which is used as 
collateral security for the note."
1376,10," . Maximum amount of any financing arrangement which can be executed in connection with such a transaction will be in 
accordance with reasonable and sound underwriting practices as determined by the management of the company. (Note It is the 
recommendation of this Office that a financed program should not be sold to an undergraduate on a basis where premiums 
would come due prior to the anticipated date of graduation by the insured.)"
1376,11," . The disturbing of any permanent insurance, including the partial or total replacement of any provisions of an existing policy 
for the purpose of placing additional insurance, will be cause for necessary investigation and review by this Department's 
personnel."
1376,12," . Agents or field representatives of the company who are licensed by this State to represent the company as licensed life 
agents may not represent, refer to or hold themselves out to the public under any special title or as representatives of any 
special policy or company division unless otherwise identified as a licensed agent of the company for which he holds a license."
1376,13," . In the case of a request being made by an insured expressing a desire to cancel such a policy and premium arrangement, 
this Office will expect and fully appreciate the cooperation of the company and its agents in bringing such matters to a 
satisfactory conclusion as expeditiously as possible. If, at the time the letter of acceptance is presented with the policy to the applicant for his signature and he decides he does not 
wish the plan, the policy will be returned to the company with his signed request for release. The policy and note will then be 
cancelled and the applicant released from any liability, and refund made of any down payment."
1376,14," . It is recommended that the cash values shown at the time of presentation should be a specimen of the policy being offered 
and not for a larger policy. For example, if you are selling a $ 10,000 policy, you should show the values for this policy and not 
for a $ 50,000 or $ 75,000 program. This leads to misunderstanding on the part of the insured when he receives his $ 10,000 
policy and the cash values are less than what he was shown at the time of sale. NOTE If a sales presentation is made for an amount of insurance greater than that sold, then an appropriate summary must be 
given to the Insured for the exact amount of policy sold not later than the date of delivery. "
1377,15," . All sales material, notes, and other forms used in the sale of such programs must be submitted in duplicate with duplicate 
letters of transmittal at the time that the policy form is submitted for approval. If found acceptable, the duplicate copy of such 
materials will be returned as ""filed"". No such material may be used until so ""filed"" with the Department. No materials may be 
added or amended unless first submitted and found acceptable as outlined above."
1377,16," . Effective Date. This Bulletin shall be effective on and after January 15, 1971. Done and ordered at Montgomery, Alabama, this 30th day of December A. D., 1970. R. FRANK USSERY SUPERINTENDENT OF INSURANCE"

1378,29," A year earlier, this Court in Battle v. Liberty National Life Ins. Co., 1974, 493 F.2d 39, 51 n.12, specifically declined to decide 
what the appropriate standard should be: In determining whether there is state regulation of the insurance business, the courts have adopted varying points of view. In 
Ohio AFL-CIO v. Insurance Rating Board, 451 F.2d 1178 (6th Cir., 1971), cert. den., 409 U.S. 917, 93 S. Ct. 215, 34 L. Ed. 2d 
180 (1972), the court stated that the requirement of state regulation under the McCarran Act is satisfied if the state has "" 
""generally authorized or permitted certain standards of conduct.' "" Id. at 1182. The regulatory scheme was considered sufficient 
even though it may not have been enforced. In Travelers Ins. Co. v. Blue Cross, 481 F.2d 80 (3 Cir. 1973), the court recognized 
the test set forth in the insurance rating case, but then found that the state regulation was more ""aggressive"" and encompassing. 
Because we disagree with the district court for other reasons specified above, we need not determine either the standard or the 
extent of insurance regulation in Alabama at this time. "
1379,30," The guidelines are set forth in note 22, Supra."
1379,31," Perry made no payment, down- or otherwise, other than the $ 10 cash downpayment disclosed. Thus, even if Fidelity had 
""disclosed"" to Perry the total downpayment, that amount would have remained $ 10."
1379,32," S 1610. Effect on other laws Inconsistent provisions (a) This subchapter does not annul, alter, or affect, or exempt any creditor from complying with, the laws of any State relating to 
the disclosure of information in connection with credit transactions, except to the extent that those laws are inconsistent with the 
provisions of this subchapter or regulations thereunder, and then only to the extent of the inconsistency. State credit charge statutes (b) This subchapter does not otherwise annul, alter or affect in any manner the meaning, scope or applicability of the laws of any 
State, including, but not limited to, laws relating to the types, amounts or rates of charges, or any element or elements of 
charges, permissible under such laws in connection with the extension or use of credit, nor does this subchapter extend the 
applicability of those laws to any class of persons or transactions to which they would not otherwise apply. "
1380,33," TIL was clearly enacted under the Commerce Clause. Mourning v. Family Publications Service, Inc., 1973, 411 U.S. 356, 
377, 93 S. Ct. 1652, 1665, 36 L. Ed. 2d 318, 334."
1380,34," S 1633. Exemption for State-regulated transactions The Board shall by regulation exempt from the requirements of this part any class of credit transactions within any State if it 
determines that under the law of that State that class of transactions is subject to requirements substantially similar to those 
imposed under this part, and that there is adequate provision for enforcement."
1380,35," However, I do join the Court, Cochran, 606 F.2d at 465, Ante, note 13, in rejecting the other holding of Lowe v. Aarco-
American, 536 F.2d at 1162, that the McCarran Act applies when the transaction involves the insurance business, even if neither 
party is an insurance company."
1380,36," In the few cases that have involved McCarran Act defenses to TIL claims, once the courts have found that the particular 
activity is part of the business of insurance and that the state has regulated that activity, they have automatically found that 
application of TIL would invalidate, impair, or supersede state law. In Gerlach, supra, the Court seemed to hold that Florida's 
statutory control over the fixing of insurance rates was enough to trigger McCarran. In discussing an issue not before it premium 
financing the Court found that certain sections of the Florida statute set forth what disclosures were required to be made in a 
premium financing agreement. The Court stated: ""It is immaterial that the regulation is not the same. What is controlling is that 
the regulation exists."" 338 F. Supp. at 650. In Lowe v. Aarco-American, Inc., 7 Cir., 1976, 536 F.2d 1160, the Court of Appeals found that the credit sale of policies by an 
insurance broker and a premium finance company constitutes part of the business of insurance which Illinois regulated under its 
Insurance Code and the Premium Financing Companies Act. Relying on Gerlach's dictum, the Court held that application of TIL 
would supersede Illinois law on the same subject, namely, disclosure. In Ben v. General Motors Acceptance Corp., D.Colo., 1974, 374 F. Supp. 1199, the plaintiff brought a TIL claim against GMAC 
and its insurance subsidiaries. The Court stated that Colorado has ""occupied the field of regulating the activities of insurance 
companies in a comprehensive manner"". Again following Gerlach, it held that because TIL does not specifically relate to the 
business of insurance, it does not apply when the state has exercised its right to regulate and control that business. Ben can 
thus be read to stand for the proposition that mere general legislation in the field of insurance results in barring a TIL claim. "
1395,1," .  On October 1, 1977, pursuant to the provision of the Department of Energy Organization Act, P.L. 95-91, 91 Stat. 565 (August 
4, 1977) and Executive Order No. 12009, 42 Fed.Reg. 46267 (September 15, 1977), the Federal Power Commission ceased to 
exist and its functions and responsibilities were transferred to the Secretary of Energy and the FERC. "
1399,2," .  Penn Power argues that rates within the zone of reasonableness are Ipso facto not violative of the antitrust laws, given the 
mandate of the Conway decision.  If rates are set below the zone of reasonableness, they are confiscatory and subject to 
constitutional challenge.  See Bluefield Water Works & Improvement Co. v. Public Service Comm'n of West Virginia, 262 U.S. 
679, 43 S. Ct. 675, 67 L. Ed. 1176 (1923). Even the district court, therefore, may not have power to set a wholesale rate below 
the level which the FERC can set the rate.  This argument is not inconsistent with a holding of nonimmunity since no complete 
antitrust remedy can be imposed without control of both the retail and wholesale rates.  In addition, treble damages cannot be 
awarded by the FERC.  The remedial powers of the district court are, even accepting Penn Power's argument, more extensive 
than those possessed by the FERC. "
1401,3," .  Practicality is the basis for a discretionary stay.  The final two premises of Ricci indicate, as they apply to this action, the merit 
of a discretionary stay.  On the basis, we hold a discretionary stay to be justified as an alternative to the primary jurisdiction 
holding."
1401,4," .  It must be emphasized that Ricci does not require a finding of immunity before referral, and no such finding has been made 
here. "
1403,7," .  If Penn Power wishes to raise the issue of primary jurisdiction with regard to this claim at a later time, the results of the 
proceedings before the FERC should be presented for consideration of the question. "

1429,5," The Seventh Circuit reviewed the various lines of cases setting forth independent tests of double patenting in the design-utility 
situation.  In particular, certain courts apply the general rule that double patenting exists if the design claimed in the first-to-issue 
design patent cannot be employed without infringing the utility patent. See Application of Thorington, supra, 418 F.2d at 537; 
Illinois Tool Works, Inc. v. Solo Cup Co., 179 U.S.P.Q. 322, 368 (N.D.Ill.1973); Tractor Supply Co. v. International Harvester Co., 
155 U.S.P.Q. 420 (N.D.Ill.1967); Deller's Walker on Patents 70 (2d Ed. 1969 70 Cum.Supp.).  Other courts apply the rule that 
double patenting has not occurred if the second-to-issue utility patent encompasses designs other than the design claimed in the 
first-to-issue design patent. See Application of Swett, 451 F.2d 631, 59 C.C.P.A. 726 (1971); Mr. Hanger, Inc. v. Cut Rate Plastic 
Hangers, Inc., 372 F. Supp. 88 (E.D.N.Y.1974). A third ""test"" for ""same invention"" double patenting is whether one of the claims 
being compared could be literally infringed without literally infringing the other; if it could be, the claims do not define identical 
subject matter.  See Application of Vogel, 422 F.2d 438, 57 C.C.P.A. 920 (1970); Application of Avery, 518 F.2d 1228 (Cust. & 
Pat.App.1975).  Accordingly, the Seventh Circuit concluded that such tests merely constitute corollaries and can only be properly 
applied with reference to the basic standard enunciated in Hargraves and DuBois. This court concurs in such analysis and believes that the best formulation of the applicable standard is that as set forth in Ropat. "
1430,6," [***845]   Wahl's vibratory bin activator is specifically described in the ""508 Patent as follows: Apparatus for attachment to the bottom of a storage bin having a discharge opening at the bottom, which apparatus comprises 
material-receiving means having concave side walls terminating in an outlet opening. (Specifications, Col. 2, Lines 5-8.) Furthermore, it is set forth that the ""apparatus comprises a bottom wall formed of a plurality of 
concentrically-arranged concave members leading to an output opening."" (Specifications, Col. 2, Lines 15-17.) See United 
States Patent No.  3,261,508, Infra, attached hereto as Appendix B. "
1431,7," It should be pointed out in this regard that it is well settled that the claims delineate the scope of protection afforded by a 
patent, not the spec-embodiments shown in the patent drawings. Deller's Walker on Patents § 509 (2d ed. 1972); Panduit Corp. 
v. Stahlin Bros. Fibre Works, Inc., 298 F. Supp. 435 (W.D.Mich.1969), Aff'd, 430 F.2d 221 (6th Cir. 1970), Cert. denied, 401 U.S. 
939, 91 S. Ct. 932, 28 L. Ed. 2d 218 (1971); Smith v. Snow, 294 U.S. 1, 16, 55 S. Ct. 279, 79 L. Ed. 721 (1934)."
1431,8," The doctrine of equivalents is basically a court created exception ""an anomaly"" logically inconsistent with the provisions of the 
statute and public policy it reflects, Royal Typewriter Co. v. Remington Rand, Inc., 168 F.2d 691, 692 (2d Cir. 1948), but 
nonetheless necessary to avoid rendering the patent a hollow and useless thing by permitting ""the unscrupulous copyist to make 
unimportant and unsubstantial changes and substitutions in the patent which, though adding nothing, would be enough to take 
the copied matter outside the claim."" Graver, supra, 339 U.S. at 607, 70 S. Ct. at 856. It is directed against those who seek to 
pirate a patented device with impunity by introducing ""minor variations to conceal and shelter the piracy."" Id.  The doctrine, 
therefore, has been applied to give its equitable purpose effect.  It is the mere expression and application of the view that like 
things are alike and that they are not made unlike by formal and non-substantial changes, no matter how clever the changes in 
form or contrived the dissimulation.  Deller's Walker on Patents, supra, § 546. "
1432,9," Under the doctrine, the nature of the invention determines the breadth of its protection.  Because such doctrine rests on 
equitable considerations, the principle has developed that an inventor, with respect to his patent, is entitled to a range of 
equivalents commensurate with the scope of his invention: broad if his invention is broad; narrow if his advance is a small one in 
a crowded field. Deller's Walker on Patents, supra, § 546; Ziegler v. Phillips Petroleum Co., supra, 483 F.2d at 869 (5th Cir. 
1973)."
1432,10," Of course, if the invalidity of the ""508 Patent on the ground of double-patenting is upheld, any issue of its infringement by the 
Rexnord device becomes moot. "
1433,11," Accord, Chapman v. Rudd Paint & Varnish Co., 409 F.2d 635, 643 (9th Cir. 1969); Carlo C. Gelardi Corp. v. Miller Brew. Co., 
421 F. Supp. 237, 242 (D.N.J.1976); Higbie v. Kopy-Kat, Inc., 391 F. Supp. 808, 810 (E.D.Pa.1975); Goldinger v. Boron Oil Co., 
375 F. Supp. 400, 406 (W.D.Pa.1974)."
1433,12," See Morton Bldgs. of Nebraska, Inc. v. Morton Bldgs. Inc., 531 F.2d 910, 917 (8th Cir. 1976) (Gibson, C. J.), wherein the 
Eighth Circuit noted that the only exception to the general rule arises when the officers or agents were, at the time of the 
conspiracy, acting beyond the scope of their authority or ""for their own benefit."" See also Greenville Publishing Co. v. Daily 
Reflector, Inc., 496 F.2d 391, 399 (4th Cir. 1974). "
1434,13," In particular, on November 1, 1965, Wahl and Vibra Screw brought an action in the United States District Court for the 
Southern District of Indiana against Carrier Manufacturing Co. alleging infringement of the ""583 Patent. The district court held 
that the claims of said patent were invalid and not infringed.  The Seventh Circuit affirmed and denied a rehearing En banc.  
Wahl and Vibra Screw, Inc. v. Carrier Manufacturing Co., Inc., 452 F.2d 96 (7th Cir. 1971), Cert. denied, 405 U.S. 990, 92 S. Ct. 
1255, 31 L. Ed. 2d 457 (1972). Meanwhile, plaintiffs filed a similar action against Vibranetics on December 18, 1970 in the 
United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky for infringement of the ""583 Patent. Judge Bratcher entered 
summary judgment in favor of defendant on the basis of the Supreme Court's decision in Blonder-Tongue v. University 
Foundation, 402 U.S. 313, 91 S. Ct. 1434, 28 L. Ed. 2d 788 (1971). In view of the Seventh Circuit's recent decision with respect 
to the ""583 Patent, plaintiffs were estopped from asserting any infringement thereof.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed.  Wahl and Vibra 
Screw, Inc. v. Vibranetics, Inc., 474 F.2d 971 (6th Cir.), Cert. denied, 414 U.S. 859, 94 S. Ct. 72, 38 L. Ed. 2d 110 (1973). Thereafter, plaintiffs brought an action against Energy, Inc., a customer of Rexnord's, and J. L. Rosium & Co., a manufacturing 
representative of Rexnord's, in the United States District Court for the District of Idaho for infringement of the ""508 and ""583 
Patents. The action was dismissed by plaintiffs without prejudice pursuant to Rule 41(a).  Wahl and Vibra Screw, Inc. v. Energy, 
Inc. and J. L. Rosium & Co., Inc., No. 1-75-137 (D.Idaho Sept. 5, 1978). Finally, on April 30, 1976 and July 21, 1976, plaintiffs filed this case and one against Solids Flow Control Corp., respectively. In 
both cases infringement of the ""583 Patent was claimed.  This court dismissed both complaints in regard to the ""583 Patent on 
the basis of Blonder-Tongue.  Wahl and Vibra Screw, Inc. v. Rexnord, Inc., No. 76-791 (D.N.J. May 19, 1977) (Order granting 
partial summary judgment), Aff'd, 577 F.2d 731 (3d Cir.), Cert. denied 439 U.S. 867, 99 S. Ct. 192, 58 L. Ed. 2d 177 (1978); 
Wahl and Vibra Screw, Inc. v. Solids Flow Control Corp., No. 76-1412 (D.N.J. June 24, 1977) (Order granting summary 
judgment), Aff'd, 577 F.2d 731 (3d Cir.), Cert. denied, 439 U.S. 439, 99 S. Ct. 192, 58 L. Ed. 2d 177 (1978). "
1442,1," In particular, defendant first moved for summary judgment, contending, in part, that the ""508 Patent was invalid for double 
patenting. Thereafter, plaintiffs filed a cross-motion for summary judgment asserting that the ""508 Patent was not invalid. This 
Court granted Rexnord's application for summary disposition invalidating the ""508 Patent."
1442,2," Plaintiffs have brought this motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(b) which allows a court to amend its findings 
and the judgment accordingly, provided the moving party files such motion within 10 days after an entry of judgment.  Plaintiffs 
filed the instant motion on March 16, 1979, eight days subsequent to the entry of this Court's order of March 8, 1979.  The 
motion, therefore, is properly before this Court. Defendant's assertion that this motion is more properly designated as a Rule 60(b) motion is incorrect.  The evidence presented 
by Wahl, See Wahl Affidavit, Supra, is not newly discovered evidence within the scope of Rule 60(b).  11 C. Wright and A. Miller, 
Federal Practice and Procedure, Civil § 2859 (1973)."
1442,3," See generally Gambrell, Mechanical and Design Inventions, Double Patenting Rejections and the Doctrine of Election, 45 
N.Y.U.L.Rev. 441 (1970). "
1443,4," For a complete description of both the earlier-issued design patent and the later-issued utility patent, see this Court's opinion in 
Wahl v. Rexnord, Inc., at 576-580, 590-597 (D.N.J. 1979) (order granting partial summary judgment). "
1444,5," It should be made clear that while, on the one hand, Wahl vigorously contends that differences do exist between the two 
patents, See Wahl Affidavit, Supra, at deposition, in response to a question pertaining to differences between the material-
receiving member and baffle as shown in both patents, Wahl aptly stated: ""(only) One difference, really, that is apparent from the 
sketchy presentation in the (design) patent, and that has to do with the Baffle."" Wahl Deposition, May 19, 1977, at 49 (emphasis 
added). Likewise, Rexnord's expert, Don Fischer, a patent attorney, a former professor of electrical and industrial engineering, and a 
former Dean of the School of Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis, stated, Via affidavit, that the only difference 
between the material-receiving member of both patents was the baffle, otherwise, the ""structures are substantially identical."" 
Fischer Affidavit, filed June 22, 1978, at 10. Furthermore, at deposition, Fischer, in response to the same question, explained he was not merely assuming that the interior 
and exterior configurations were identical.  Instead, he was relying upon the File History of the ""068 design patent itself.  The File 
History showed that Wahl, acting pursuant to the Patent Office Examiner's instructions, sent literature displaying a device with a 
concave surface on the inside.  It would be ""absolutely ridiculous,"" Fischer pointed out, in an industrial design for one who extols 
a concave design, I. e., Wahl, to have differing interior and exterior configurations. The former Engineering Dean concluded he 
had ""no doubt"" that the material-receiving member interiorly in the ""068 design patent had a plurality of concave surfaces. 
Fischer Deposition, Sept. 1, 1978, at 35-38, 51-54, 58.  For pertinent sections of the File History of the ""068 design patent, see 
Appendix A(3)-(10)."
1444,6," In In re Aslanian, the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals recently highlighted this point when it aptly stated: 
""(in) determining what a design patent teaches or fairly suggests to one skilled in the art, it must be remembered that although 
patentability of a design may not be based upon functional considerations, the specific disclosure of structure in a design patent 
application may inherently teach Functional features."" 200 U.S.P.Q. at 503 (emphasis added)."
1444,7," Plaintiffs cannot find solace in such cases as In re Swett, 59 C.C.P.A. 726, 451 F.2d 631 (C.C.P.A.1971); In re Dubois, 262 
F.2d 88, 46 C.C.P.A. 744 (1958); Mr. Hanger, Inc. v. Cut Rate Plastic Hangers, Inc., 372 F. Supp. 88 (E.D.N.Y.1974). In each of 
those cases, the utility patent was not interrelated to the design patent but was susceptible of many different appearances, which 
were often documented in the utility patent itself.  In the instant case, the bin activator as claimed does not have a wide variety of 
appearances. "
1456,*," Alfred T. Goodwin, Circuit Judge, sitting as District Judge by designation. "
1475,1," At the time of oral argument the defendants cited and provided to this Court a full copy of the unpublished opinion in SCM 
Corporation v. Xerox Corporation, 463 F. Supp. 983 (D.Conn., No. 15,807, December 29, 1978, Newman, J.), a massive opinion 
in a massive case. Judge Newman has literally written a treatise in a wide ranging area of antitrust and patent law and the 
interrelationship between the two. The defendants appear to cite this case to demonstrate an analogy between the public grant 
of patent rights there and the public authorization of utility rates here. It is also cited for its relevant market discussion. The 
discussion of Section 2 of the Sherman Act commences at page 1006 of the opinion in unpublished form and concludes on page 
1015. At page 1011 Judge Newman states: HN6[
] ""With respect to assets other than patents, there is authority that a monopolist's unilateral refusal to deal violates the 
antitrust laws where the refusal is a part of an attempt to further monopoly power. E.g., Lorain Journal Co. v. United States (342 
U.S. 143, 72 S. Ct. 181, 96 L. Ed. 162), supra; Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States (410 U.S. 366, 93 S. Ct. 1022, 35 L. Ed. 2d 
359), supra."" The reasoning in SCM considered in its own factual setting, does not compel a result contrary to the one here announced. "
1479,2," In the recent case of City of Newark et al. v. Delmarva Power & Light Co., 467 F. Supp. 763 (D.Del. 1979, Stapleton, J.), there 
appears to be nothing in it that compels a result different than that announced here. The posture of the record here is in a much 
later procedural stage. To the extent that Judge Stapleton puts a slightly different shade on City of Mishawaka et al. v. Indiana & 
Michigan Electric Company, 560 F.2d 1314 (7th Cir. 1977), this Court is bound by its holding as a part of the law in this case. "
