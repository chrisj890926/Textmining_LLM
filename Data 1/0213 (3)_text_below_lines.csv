21,1," .  Definition of terms used in this opinion: Bulk transmission system : higher voltage and higher capacity lines tying together power plants and serving major loads going to 
interconnections Closed connection : switch is closed and power can flow over the interconnection between the two systems Distribution line : serves local loads Generation : the production of electricity Intrastate : electric utilities operating in such a manner that electric energy does not cross state lines Interstate : electric utilities operating in such a manner that electric energy is either transmitted or received across state lines "
22,," Open interconnection : switch at the interconnection is open with no power or energy being able to flow over the interconnection Parallel operation : virtually the same as synchronous operation Radial line : ""single feed"" one electric line to a town; two transmission lines to a town would be ""dual feed"" Reserve : two types of electric energy reserve Spinning reserve reserve that a utility has on line at any time Capacity reserve total generation of the capacity of the utility system less expected peak demand (the maximum amount of 
energy demand on the system during the year), or reserve above the peak demand of generation Synchronous operation : means two or more electric utilities systems interconnected with the generators operating in 
synchronism with each other Transmission line : serves bulk power supply "

48,3," .  The PUC has deferred a ruling on issues similar to the issues presented in this case pending a ruling by this court on the 
merits of this suit. I therefore think it appropriate to comment on these attorneys fees, even though I cannot award attorneys 
fees, since the PUC will be relying on this court's view of the evidence."
48,4," .  This finding is limited only to this discussion concerning the propriety of passing through these legal expenses to the public in 
the rate structure."
48,5," .  The Defendants may have a valid argument that they should be able to pass through their costs to the public because they did 
not institute this litigation, and were forced to defend it. "

59,2," .  The Court has adapted its findings of fact and conclusions of law from the plaintiffs' proposed findings of fact and conclusions 
of law filed December 8, 1978, with such minor additions and deletions as the Court has considered proper. "
66,1," .  H.R.J. Res. 208, 92d Cong., 2d Sess., 86 Stat. 1523 (1972) provides: Section 1. Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of

68,3," .  There were two printings of 20,000 copies each.  Several thousand brochures were distributed at the International Women's 
Year Conference in Houston, Texas, in November, 1977.  The small fraction of NOW's 1977 budget ($ 5,000) earmarked for the 
economic boycott campaign went mainly for printing expenses."
68,4," .  The kit contained the brochure and button described above, a list of the members of the national committee with their 
telephone numbers, a ""guidelines for action"" paper, a current list of organizations which had adopted a convention boycott 
resolution, a ""position paper,"" a ""boycott fact sheet,"" a list of convention changes, and a ""contact sheet"" listing the names and 
addresses of legislative leaders in unratified states.  The boycott kit was not being distributed at time of trial because NOW 
officials found it to be prohibitively expensive. "
69,5," .  On February 8, 1977, ERAmerica released a list of 15 national organizations which had adopted boycott resolutions, 
erroneously including the National Organization for Women.  This list reflects activity in the convention boycott movement long 
before NOW took any part."
69,6," .  On the contrary, the evidence shows that NOW did not even respond to correspondence from these individuals."
69,7," .  Groups in this category include the American Nurses Association (in relation to the convention of the International Congress of 
Nursing), the National Council of Senior Citizens, and the American Home Economics Association.  However, there was 
evidence that many groups in this category were considering some sort of participation in the convention boycott movement 
before the initial contact from NOW. "
70,8," .  The convention boycott movement was the subject of a front page article in the New York Times on November 13, 1977."
70,9," .  It was enough that, knowing that concerted action was contemplated and invited, the distributors gave their adherence to the 
scheme and participated in it.  Each distributor was advised that the others were asked to participate; each knew that 
cooperation was essential to successful operation of the plan. Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. United States, supra, at 226, 59 S. Ct. at 474."
70,10," .  Because this substantial legal issue, raised in NOW's motion for summary judgment, was interposed so close to time of trial, 
this Court deferred its ruling until after the trial on the merits."
70,11, .  It is unnecessary to reach other grounds for standing asserted by Missouri. 
71,12," .  In holding that damage to a state's general economy is not an injury to its ""business and property"" necessary for recovery of 
damages under ยง 4, the Court contrasted the potential of multiple recoveries inherent to a Parens patriae damage claim with the 
unitary effect of an injunction."
71,13," .  In the parlance of the convention industry, a definite booking is the confirmation, probably in writing, of the official decision of 
the organization to designate a certain city or particular facilities for its meeting."
71,14," .  At least one of these cancellations, occurring in 1976, predated NOW's active role in the boycott campaign."
71,15," .  A tentative booking is notification from the organization that it is interested in particular facilities and constitutes a request that 
the space be reserved on a tentative basis pending an official decision.  At this stage, the organization may tentatively book 
several locations, with the result that every tentative booking does not become a definite booking."
71,16," .  NOW's estimate represents revenue loss over the period 1978-1981 and does not include revenue loss resulting from the 
cancellation of the 1981 International Congress of Nursing convention in Kansas City, Missouri.  That convention is estimated to 
represent.$ 3.2 million revenue to the convention site. "
72,17," .  It is NOW's position that whatever injury has been proved is insignificant if compared with the dollar volume of all economic 
activity within the state of Missouri.  In 1977, the convention industry brought $ 183 million in revenue to the state.  Total 
personal income in Missouri in 1977 was in the neighborhood of $ 25 billion."

products, other food products, gasoline service stations, other retail businesses, miscellaneous manufacturing, transportation 
services, other services, wholesale businesses, and imports.  International Association of Convention and Visitors Bureaus, 
Convention Delegate Expenditure Survey 1973 (sector classifications were modified to comport with the analytical model of 
Missouri's expert witness). "
75,22," .  NOW argues that ""acceptance of the state's theory (of economic linkage causing damage to the general economy) would 
give the state standing to sue in every case where any Missouri business claims injury by reason of any tort, including violations 
of antitrust laws, or presumably even in ordinary breach of contract cases."" Defendant's post-trial brief, at 10.  The Court shares 
this concern and notes that the economic interdependence rationale for Parens patriae standing cannot be viewed in isolation or 
accepted as the sole justification for state standing.  To do so would carry the doctrine of Parens patriae far beyond its proper 
bounds."
75,23," .  Missouri further argues that withholding patronage from Missouri convention businesses in order to influence the Missouri 
legislature constitutes a secondary boycott, I. e., economic pressure on innocent third parties to achieve some result with 
respect to the boycott target, and therefore is Per se unlawful under the Sherman Act. See Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores,

control problems of ""business competition"")."
75,25," .  Missouri cites cases for the proposition that the Sherman Act does apply to ""non-traditional"" boycotts, the ultimate focus of 
which is an objective other than the business or commercial advancement of the participants.  American Medical Assoc. v.

(1970). "
77,26," .   Council of Defense v. International Magazine Co., 267 F. 390 (8th Cir. 1920), cited by Missouri, is not to the contrary.  The 
Eighth Circuit found that a boycott of Hearst magazines organized by a state-supported organization was a violation of the 
Sherman Act. The court stated: ""Any contention that appellants were within their constitutional rights of free speech in saying, 
writing, and publishing the objectionable matter, is answered by Gompers v. Buck Stove Co., supra."" In Gompers v. Bucks Stove 
& Range Co., 221 U.S. 418, 31 S. Ct. 492, 55 L. Ed. 797 (1911), the first amendment question raised was identical to that in 
Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co., supra, in which the Court held that an otherwise illegal action is not protected simply 
because speech is used to advance the illegal activity.  The first amendment protections for freedom of petition and of political 
association, which are implicit in this case, were neither presented to nor treated by the court in Council of Defense. "

78,32," .  This Court has considered and dismissed the theory advanced in Bird, Sherman Act Limitations on Noncommercial 
Concerted Refusals to Deal, 1970 Duke L.J. 247, in which the author urges that noncommercial boycotts be treated as Per se 
unlawful under the antitrust laws. The noncommercial boycott is seen as an ""undesirable aggregation of private (economic) 
power"" with no more than self-imposed restraints on harm caused to others.  The author hypothesizes that such power could be 
wielded by zealous believers willing to impose economic harm upon their victims without limit until their noneconomic goal is 
achieved.  This theory does not confront the first amendment guarantees of freedom of association and the right to petition 
which must be dealt with by the courts.  This lack, coupled with the political realities of American government, makes it 
impossible for this Court to subscribe to it."

baseball and soccer. The adoption of the foregoing resolution shall not affect nor modify the provisions of Article III, Section 3.5

86,9," The proposed amendment reads as follows: ""Amend Article IX, by adding a new Section 9.4 as follows: ""9.4(A) No person (1) owning a majority interest in a member club, or (2) directly or indirectly having substantial operational 
control, or substantial influence over the operations, of a member club, or (3) serving as an officer or director of a member club, "

indirectly provided or contributed all or any part of the funds used to purchase or operate the other sports league entity, or (2) if 
there exists between such person and any such relative a significant community of interest in the successful operation of the 
other sports league entity. ""(C) The Commissioner shall investigate, to the extent he deems necessary or appropriate, any reported or apparent violation of

may be withheld, in whole or in part, by the Commissioner from available funds in possession of the League Office belonging to

87,10," Apparently the Nordstroms take the position, Vis-a-vis the NFL, that the ""overlapping minority interest holders"" comprising the 
Nordstrom Family Partnership are not subject to the amendment, ""since none of them controls either team"" (i. e., the Seattle 
NFL and NASL franchises). Rozelle affidavit at p. 22, P 38. I need not resolve that issue. The present inquiry relates to the threat 
of harm to the NASL. The NFL does not appear to accept the Nordstroms' contention; Rozelle affidavit at p. 22, P 39. Its position 
may be considered in assessing the potential effect of the NFL amendment upon the NASL."
87,11," Woosnam affidavit at p. 8, P 15."
87,12," The record contains ample and essentially undisputed evidence that some seven NFL owners (in addition to the current 
cross-owners) have recently expressed interest in acquiring all or part of various NASL franchises. (Woosnam affidavit at pp. 15- "
88,16," , P 27; Rozelle affidavit at p. 25, P 44). In one instance in 1978, following discussions between Robert R. Hermann, Chairman 
of the Board of an NASL franchise and an NFL owner (concerning the latter's desire to purchase the soccer franchise), Mr. 
Hermann asserts he was told ""point blank that there was no sense in proceeding any further with our conversations in light of the 
NFL's stated intention to adopt and/or enforce"" the cross-ownership ban. (Affidavit of Robert R. Hermann, September 21, 1978). 
A similar ""chilling"" as a result of the impending by-law amendment of another NFL owner's interest in purchasing a soccer 
franchise also apparently occurred within the past year. (Reply Affidavit of Philip A. Woosnam, October 27, 1978, at p. 3, P 4)."
88,13, No disrespect is meant to Mr. Bidwell.
88,14," Affidavit, pp. 8, 12, PP 13, 20. "
89,15," In Professor Sullivan's analysis, a boycott is ""horizontal"" when it operates, i. e., when its effect is felt, on the same market level 
at which the boycotting group operates. In short, it is a boycott of competitors by competitors. To be distinguished are ""vertical"" 
boycotts, as for example where a group of sellers agrees to withhold their product from a particular buyer with whom, of course, 
they do not compete. Sullivan focuses upon whether the boycotting group's target is or is not a competitor; he views the former 
situation as more pernicious and thus more appropriate for Per se condemnation. L. A. Sullivan, Antitrust, pp. 229-232."
89,16," The Smith court adopted Professor Sullivan's definition of the classic group boycott but refused to apply a Per se rule to the 
NFL player draft for two reasons. First, the court opined that notwithstanding competition among league members for players, 
the joint venture nature of the league made Per se rules inappropriate. Second, the court found the NFL's player boycott to be 
vertical rather than horizontal. See note 15 Supra. The restraint was found to be illegal, however, under the rule of reason."
89,17," In Oreck Corp., supra, 579 F.2d at 131, the Second Circuit said: "" ""While the boycott concept is infinitely expandable, the Per se doctrine ought not to be.' Sullivan, Antitrust 256 (1977), quoted 
in Drayer v. Krasner, 572 F.2d 348 (2d Cir. 1978). It is important to distinguish between ""horizontal' restraints, I. e. agreements "
90,," between competitors at the same level of market structure, and ""vertical' restraints, I. e. combinations of persons at different 
levels of the market structure, such as manufacturers and distributors."""
90,18," The rationale for a relaxed antitrust approach to league sports was stated in United States v. National Football League, supra, 
116 F. Supp. at 323: ""Professional football is a unique type of business. Like other professional sports which are organized on a league basis it has 
problems which no other business has. The ordinary business makes every effort to sell as much of its product or services as it 
can. In the course of doing this it may and often does put many of its competitors out of business. The ordinary business man is 
not troubled by the knowledge that he is doing so well that his competitors are being driven out of business. ""Professional teams in a league, however, must not compete too well with each other in a business way. On the playing field, of 
course, they must compete as hard as they can all the time. But it is not necessary and indeed it is unwise for all the teams to 
compete as hard as they can against each other in a business way. If all the teams should compete as hard as they can in a 
business way, the stronger teams would be likely to drive the weaker ones into financial failure. If this should happen not only 
would the weaker teams fail, but eventually the whole league, both the weaker and the stronger teams, would fail, because 
without a league no team can operate profitably."" In Philadelphia World Hockey Club, supra, 351 F. Supp. at 503-04 Judge Higginbotham stated generally: ""The sports field is in some ways a hybrid, in that it is both similarly and dissimilarly affected by the normal economic variables 
governing business success. For a corporation producing aluminum, any entrant in the field is a competitor. From a traditional 
oligopolist's or monopolist's view, one might consider any new entrant as an adversary and thus undesirable. But by the nature 
of a sports contest, there must always be an adversary. By analogy, who would enjoy Vida Blue blazing strikes across home 
plate when the batter's box was empty, or Mark Spitz' triumphs, if he were the only one in the pool. Sports teams need 
competition, and if there are more than two teams, some type of league is probably desirable. ""For maximum customer receptivity and profit it is in the best interest of any club that its opponents not generally be viewed by 
the public as totally incompetent and utterly unable to compete effectively."""
90,19," The NASL makes the argument that Per se rules have been deemed inappropriate because of the joint venture nature of the 
league only when the restraint at issue applies to Intra -league competition. Plaintiffs would distinguish the instant case on the 
ground that the cross-ownership ban hinders Inter -league competition, i. e. that between the NFL and the NASL. Thus, the 
NASL contends that the ""joint venture"" defense is unavailing to save this ""group boycott"" from Per se condemnation. I am not persuaded that the joint venture defense should be so narrowly construed. For example, Philadelphia World Hockey 
Club, supra, concerned a challenge by the World Hockey Association to the National Hockey League's player restrictions. The 
hindering of Inter -league competition was clearly at issue, yet Judge Higginbotham refused to apply a Per se rule to the alleged

91,20," Plaintiffs' main brief at pp. 39-40. Plaintiffs make a third argument, that the cross-ownership ban runs afoul of the so-called ""essential facility"" doctrine of antitrust 
law. See generally, Otter Tail Power Co. v. U. S., 410 U.S. 366, 93 S. Ct. 1022, 35 L. Ed. 2d 359 (1973); U. S. v. Terminal R. R. 
Ass'n, 224 U.S. 383, 32 S. Ct. 507, 56 L. Ed. 810 (1912). The District of Columbia Circuit's recent discussion of the doctrine 
provides a helpful summary of the law: "" ""(W)here facilities cannot practicably be duplicated by would-be competitors, those in possession of them must allow them to 
be shared on fair terms. It is illegal restraint of trade to foreclose the scarce facility.' . . . To be ""essential' a facility need not be 
indispensible; it is sufficient if duplication of the facility would be economically infeasible and if denial of its use inflicts a severe "
92,," handicap on potential market entrants. Necessarily, this principle must be carefully delineated: the antitrust laws do not require 
that an essential facility be shared if such sharing would be impractical or would inhibit the defendant's ability to serve its 
customers adequately."" Hecht v. Pro-Football, Inc., 187 U.S.App.D.C. 73, 83, 570 F.2d 982, 992-93 (1977) (citations and 
footnotes omitted). Two problems with the applicability of this theory to the case at bar come immediately to mind. First, the cases cited by plaintiffs 
all deal with tangible physical objects as ""essential facilities."" Otter Tail, supra (electricity transmission lines); Terminal R. R., 
supra (railroad switching facilities); Hecht, supra (football stadium); Helix Milling Co. v. Terminal Flour Mills Co., 523 F.2d 1317 
(9th Cir. 1975), Cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1053, 96 S. Ct. 782, 46 L. Ed. 2d 642 (1976) (flour mill); U. S. v. Standard Oil Co., 362 F. 
Supp. 1331 (N.D.Cal.1972), Aff'd, 412 U.S. 924, 93 S. Ct. 2750, 37 L. Ed. 2d 152 (1973) (fuel storage facilities). The ""essential 
facility"" or ""scarce resource"" here is the sports capital and entrepreneurial skill of the NFL owners. Second, the cited cases all 
deal with situations where the defendant enjoyed a monopoly over the resource or facility. While it might be said that the NFL 
""monopolizes"" NFL owners, I do not understand plaintiffs' position to be that the NFL monopolizes the entire field of ""sports 
owners,"" nor is this a necessary showing to establish the right to relief under the other theories pressed. In sum, it seems that if 
the NASL succeeds on its primary theories of liability, then resort to ""essential facility"" law would be superfluous, if indeed it is 
applicable at all."

93,25," Defendants have submitted an exchange of letters between Lamar Hunt and Pete Rozelle, spanning the period of August 11, 
1972 to March 8, 1977. The correspondence concerns Mr. Hunt's willingness and efforts to comply with the NFL policy 
resolutions on cross-ownership. Mr. Hunt's letters reveal his concern with being forced into divestiture at a time when there was 
little or no market for NASL franchises. His perceptions as to investor reaction to the sale of a ""Hunt"" business are instructive: ""The soccer investment of myself and my children (for which I am obviously responsible) is a Very substantial one unfortunately, 
at this point more than I expected. Though the picture looks infinitely brighter for the sport, it is still a long way from reaching 
fruition for the investors and, in fact, at present there is virtually no market for a going club especially one owned by a ""Hunt.' 
(We have a historically bad record for selling any business for buyers seem to feel that anything we are selling must really be a 
""dog.' "" Letter from Lamar Hunt to Pete Rozelle, at 1 (November 12, 1973). More recently, Hunt has said: ""I am informed that NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle has filed an affidavit in this action indicating that (i) I am in complete accord 
with this latest proposed rule by the NFL to bar NFL owners from having an interest in other team sports, and (ii) I am presently 
desirous of selling my other team sports interests. Neither of these assertions is true. In the past I have reluctantly indicated to 
the other owners in the NFL that, if they required me to do so, I would sell my interests in other team sports, specifically soccer 
and basketball, at an appropriate time when proper financial arrangements could be made in order to protect my investments in 
those franchises. However, as a businessman, I do not want to be in a position where I would be forced to sell either my soccer 
or basketball interest by a specified date and under threat of compulsion. Such a requirement would, in my view, jeopardize the "
94,," substantial investment I have made in particular in my soccer franchise over the last twelve years. In fact, at the present time, it 
is not my desire to relinquish my ownership in the Dallas Tornado (or the Chicago Bulls for that matter) unless I am compelled to 
do so by the cross-ownership ban proposed by the NFL."" Affidavit of Lamar Hunt, October 26, 1978, at p. 2, P 3."
94,26," The business justifications urged by defendants in support of the cross-ownership ban are summarized in the NFL's brief at p. 
6: ""(1) protection of commercial confidentiality; ""(2) preservation of good relations with the public, including (a) avoiding dilution of the goodwill which a prominent local NFL ""salesman' wins for the entire NFL; (b) remaining untarnished by adverse fan reactions to publicly visible owners whose activities in other sports may arouse local 
hostility; (c) taking the procompetitive side of the public debate concerning the proper role of sports ownership ""magnates' or human 
""conglomerates'; and ""(3) encouragement of maximum cooperation, and minimizing animosity and suspicion, among the NFL member joint-venturers."" "

] Under ยงยง 2 (a) and (b) of the Act, a seller who can establish either that a price differential was cost justified or offered in good faith to meet competition has a complete defense to a charge of price discrimination under the Act.  
Standard Oil Co. v. FTC, 340 U.S. 231. See n. 1, supra. With respect to the meeting-competition defense, the Commission stated that even though Borden as the seller might have had 
a meeting-competition defense, A&P as the buyer did not have such a defense because it knew that the bid offered was, in fact, 
better than the Bowman bid. With respect to the cost-justification defense, the Commission found that Commission counsel had 
met the initial burden of going forward as required by this Court's decision in Automatic Canteen Co. of America v. FTC, 346 
U.S. 61, and that A&P had not then satisfied its burden of showing that the prices were cost justified, or that it did not know that 
they were not. The Commission upheld the Administrative Law Judge's dismissal of Count III of the complaint."
103,6," The Court of Appeals, like the Commission, relied on Kroger Co. v. FTC, 438 F.2d 1372 (CA6), for the proposition that a buyer 
can be liable under ยง 2 (f) of the Act even if the seller has a meeting-competition defense.  The Kroger case involved a buyer 
who had made deliberate misrepresentations to a seller in order to induce price concessions.  While the Court of Appeals in this 
case did not find that A&P had made any affirmative misrepresentations, it viewed the distinction between a ""lying buyer"" and a 
buyer who knowingly accepts the lower of two bids as without legal significance.  See n. 15, infra."

as an ""afterthought."" Id., at 421; J. McCord, Commentaries on the Robinson-Patman Act 96 (1969)."
104,9," Commentators have recognized that a finding of buyer liability under ยง 2 (f) is dependent on a finding of seller liability under ยง 2 
(a).  McCord, supra, at 96 (""[Section] 2 (f) cannot be enforced if a prima facie case could not be established against the seller on 
the basis of the transaction in question under Section 2 (a) or if he could sustain an affirmative defense thereto""); Rowe, supra, 
at 421 (""the legal status of the buyer is derivative from the seller's pricing legality under the Act""); H. Shniderman, Price 
Discrimination in Perspective 136 (1977) (a buyer can be liable under ยง 2 (f) only if the price received ""cannot be excused by any 
defenses provided to the seller"")."
104,10," In presenting the Conference Report to the House, Representative Utterback summarized the meaning of ยง 2 (f) by stating: 
""This paragraph makes the buyer liable for knowingly inducing or receiving any discrimination in price which is unlawful under 
the first paragraph [ยง 2 (a)] of the amendment."" 80 Cong. Rec. 9419 (1936). "
105,11," Section 2 (e) provides: HN7[
] ""It shall be unlawful for any person to discriminate in favor of one purchaser against another purchaser or purchasers of 
a commodity bought for resale, with or without processing, by contracting to furnish or furnishing, or by contributing to the 
furnishing of, any services or facilities connected with the processing, handling, sale, or offering for sale of such commodity so 
purchased upon terms not accorded to all purchasers on proportionally equal terms."" 15 U. S. C. ยง 13 (e)."
105,12," Contrary to the respondent's suggestion, this interpretation of ยง 2 (f) is in no way inconsistent with congressional intent.  ""[The] 
buyer whom Congress in the main sought to reach was the one who, knowing full well that there was little likelihood of a defense 
for the seller, nevertheless proceeded to exert pressure for lower prices."" Automatic Canteen Co. of America v. FTC, 346 U.S., 
at 79. Here, by contrast, we conclude that a buyer is not liable if the seller does have a defense under ยง 2 (b)."
105,13," More than once the Court has stated that the Robinson-Patman Act should be construed consistently with broader policies of 
the antitrust laws.  United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422; Automatic Canteen Co. of America v. FTC, supra, 
at 74. "
106,14," A duty of affirmative disclosure might also be difficult to enforce.  In cases where a seller offers differing quantities or a 
different quality product, or offers to serve the buyer in a different manner, it might be difficult for the buyer to determine when 
disclosure is required."
106,15," In Kroger Co. v. FTC, 438 F.2d 1372, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that a buyer who induced price 
concessions by a seller by making deliberate misrepresentations could be liable under ยง 2 (f) even if the seller has a meeting-
competition defense. This case does not involve a ""lying buyer"" situation.  The complaint issued by the FTC alleged that ""A&P accepted the said offer 
of Borden with knowledge that Borden had granted a substantially lower price than that offered by the only other competitive 
bidder and without notifying Borden of this fact."" The complaint did not allege that Borden's second bid was induced by any 
misrepresentation. The Court of Appeals recognized that the Kroger case involved a ""lying buyer,"" but stated that there was no 
meaningful distinction between the situation where ""the buyer lies or merely keeps quiet about the nature of the competing bid."" 
557 F.2d 971, 983. Despite this background, the respondent argues that A&P did engage in misrepresentations and therefore can be found liable as 
a ""lying buyer"" under the rationale of the Kroger case.  The misrepresentation relied upon by the respondent is a statement 
allegedly made by a representative of A&P to Borden after Borden made its second bid which would have resulted in annual 
savings to A&P of $ 820,000.  The A&P representative allegedly told Borden to ""sharpen your pencil a little bit because you are 
not quite there."" But the Commission itself referred to this comment only to note its irrelevance, and neither the Commission nor "
107,," the Court of Appeals mentioned it in considering the ยง 2 (f) charge against A&P.  This is quite understandable, since the 
comment was allegedly made after Borden made its second bid and therefore cannot be said to have induced the bid as in the 
Kroger case. Because A&P was not a ""lying buyer,"" we need not decide whether such a buyer could be liable under ยง 2 (f) even if the seller 
has a meeting-competition defense."
107,16," Recognition of the right of a seller to meet a lower competitive price in good faith may be the primary means of reconciling the 
Robinson-Patman Act with the more general purposes of the antitrust laws of encouraging competition between sellers. As the 
Court stated in Standard Oil Co. v. FTC, 340 U.S., at 249: ""We need not now reconcile, in its entirety, the economic theory which underlies the Robinson-Patman Act with that of the 
Sherman and Clayton Acts.  It is enough to say that Congress did not seek by the Robinson-Patman Act either to abolish 
competition or so radically to curtail it that a seller would have no substantial right of self-defense against a price raid by a 
competitor."" "
108,17," The facts of this case are thus readily distinguishable from Corn Products Co. v. FTC, 324 U.S. 726, and FTC v. A. E. Staley 
Mfg. Co., 324 U.S. 746, in both of which the Court held that a seller had failed to establish a meeting-competition defense.  In 
the Corn Products case, the only evidence to rebut the prima facie case of price discrimination was testimony by witnesses who 
had no personal knowledge of the transactions in question.  Similarly, in the Staley Mfg. Co. case, unsupported testimony from 
informants of uncertain character and reliability was insufficient to establish the defense.  In the present case, by contrast, the 
source of the information was a person whose reliability was not questioned and who had personal knowledge of the competing 
bid. Moreover, Borden attempted to investigate by asking A&P for more information about the competing bid. Finally, Borden 
was faced with a credible threat of a termination of purchases by A&P if it did not make a second offer.  All of these factors serve 
to show that Borden did have a valid meeting-competition defense.  See United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S., 
at 454."
108,18," Because we hold that the petitioner is not liable under ยง 2 (f), we do not reach the question whether Borden might also have 
had a cost-justification defense under ยง 2 (a). "

Patman, supra, at 7-10, 148-151; Rowe, supra, at 8-23. The Court recently noted in United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422, 455 n. 30 (1978), that ""[it] may also turn 
out that sustained enforcement of ยง 2 (f) . . . will serve to bolster the credibility of buyers' representations and render reliance 
thereon by sellers a more reasonable and secure predicate for a finding of good faith under ยง 2 (b)."" (Citation omitted.) But if 
neither a buyer nor a seller can be liable when the seller relies in good faith on the buyer's misrepresentations, then enforcement 
of ยง 2 (f) will not ""bolster the credibility"" of buyers. Thus, the derivative standard of liability adopted by the Court today is 
inconsistent with the premise underlying the Court's suggestion in United States Gypsum, see Note, The Supreme Court, 1977 
Term, 92 Harv. L. Rev. 57, 288, 291-294 (1978), and it eliminates one means of reassuring sellers that they may rely on buyer 
representations."
110,3," Given this preface to Automatic Canteen, language in that opinion provides little support for the Court's adoption today of a 
derivative standard with respect to the buyer's meeting-competition defense.  Moreover, to the extent the majority believes its 
resort to literal construction of ยง 2 (f) forecloses further inquiry, it ignores the broader teaching of Automatic Canteen.  That case 
adopted a common-sense approach for interpreting the often ambiguous Robinson-Patman Act, tempering a ""merely literal 
reading of the language"" with considerations of ""fairness and convenience"" when necessary to achieve Congress' purpose.  346 
U.S., at 79, and n. 23. On that basis, Automatic Canteen allocated to the Commission the burden of production regarding a 
buyer's cost-justification defense, even though the Commission does not bear that burden in a proceeding against a seller. Id., at 
75-76; FTC v. Morton Salt Co., 334 U.S. 37, 44-45 (1948). Indeed, the Court's interpretation of ยง 2 (f) today, which places buyers 
in the litigating position of their sellers, may also be incompatible with Automatic Canteen's specific holding on the burden of 
production. "
111,4," Because the Court reverses the judgment without remanding for further consideration and does not expressly reach the merits 
of the cost-justification issue raised by A&P, ante, at 85 n. 18, I need not address that issue either."
111,5," Considering the recent admonition in United States Gypsum, supra, at 456 n. 31, that ""[the] case-by-case interpretation and 
elaboration of the ยง 2 (b) defense is properly left to the other federal courts and the FTC in the context of concrete fact 
situations,"" the Court's action is particularly inappropriate. While I question the Court's decision to undertake resolution of this factual question, without even determining which party bore 
the burden of persuasion, I do not understand Part IV of its opinion as purporting to modify in any sense what was said last Term 
in United States Gypsum about the scope of the meeting-competition defense for sellers."
111,6," The Court's opinion creates the impression that Borden submitted only two proposals, ante, at 81-82, n. 15, 83-84.  In fact, A&P 
induced Borden to make a third proposal, even though the second was already more favorable than Bowman's. When Borden initially responded to Bowman's bid, the A&P representative rejected Borden's offer on the ground that it included 
milk sold in glass gallon containers, whereas other bidders supposedly had not included that item.  Actually, Bowman's bid had 
included glass gallons and A&P had subsequently decided against using glass containers.  87 F. T. C. 962, 979 (1976); App. 
73a-74a, 116a-118a, 257a-260a, 774a-775a.  The effect of forcing Borden to delete milk sold in glass gallons from the proposal 
without raising the overall bid, was to increase the savings to A&P on other products still covered because part of the promised 
savings had been derived from the sale of the cheaper glass gallons. See 87 F. T. C., at 979-980. In addition, while Borden was 
preparing a third proposal to reflect the deletion, A&P suggested that Borden make further price reductions, saying ""'sharpen 
your pencil a little bit because you are not quite there.'"" App. 118a.  As a result, Borden reduced its prices still further to yield 
additional savings of approximately $ 5,000 to $ 8,000.  The bid finally accepted by A&P incorporated these price reductions as 
well as those attributable to the deletion of glass gallons. See id., at 117a-118a, 123a-124a, 141a-142a. "

from Pharmacy A, the insured pays $ 2.00.  Pharmacy A receives $ 2.00 from the insured and $ 8.00 from Blue Shield, or $ 
10.00 total.  If an insured buys Drug X from Pharmacy B, the insured pays Pharmacy B $ 10.00, and receives $ 6.00 (75 percent 
of the difference between the retail price and $ 2.00) from Blue Shield.  While Pharmacy B receives the same as Pharmacy A, 
the insured must pay $ 4.00 for the drug and also must take steps to obtain reimbursement. ""If the pharmacy's acquisition cost for the drug is $ 5.00 rather than $ 8.00, the situations of Pharmacy B and the insured are 
unchanged.  But now Pharmacy A will receive only $ 5.00 from Blue Shield, for a total of $ 7.00."""
121,4," Even if they are the ""business of insurance,"" the Agreements are exempt from the antitrust laws only if they are also ""regulated 
by State law"" within the meaning of ยง 2 (b) and not ""boycotts"" or other conduct described by ยง 3 (b).  See n. 1, supra.  See also 
St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Barry, 438 U.S. 531."
121,5," It is axiomatic that conduct which is not exempt from the antitrust laws may nevertheless be perfectly legal.  The United States 
in its amicus briefs urging affirmance has taken the position that the Pharmacy Agreements probably do not violate the antitrust 
laws, though recognizing that that issue is not presented here. "
122,6," The issue in that case was the meaning of the ""boycott"" exception in ยง 3 (b) of the Act.  The issue here, the meaning of the 
""business of insurance"" exemption in ยง 2 (b) of the Act, was not before the Court."
122,7," Webster's New International Dictionary of the English Language 1289 (unabr. 2d ed. 1958) defines insurance as: ""Act of insuring, or assuring, against loss or damage by a contingent event; a contract whereby, for a stipulated consideration, 
called a premium, one party undertakes to indemnify or guarantee another against loss by a certain specified contingency or 
peril, called a risk, the contract being set forth in a document called the policy. . . ."""
122,8," The issue in SEC v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co. was whether the variable annuity contracts were subject to regulation under 
the Securities Act of 1933 and the Investment Company Act of 1940.  The Court held that the contracts were subject to such "
123,," regulation as securities since they were not ""insurance"" or ""annuity"" policies specifically exempt from the Securities Act, and 
because they were not the ""business of insurance"" within the meaning of the McCarran-Ferguson Act."
123,9," LEdHN[6B][
] [6B]It is true that some type of provider agreement is necessary for a service benefit plan to exist.  But it does 
not follow that because an agreement is necessary to provide insurance, it is also the ""business of insurance."" Assume, for 
example, that an indemnity insurer must have a line of credit or other commercial arrangement with a bank in order to pay off 
monetary claims.  Despite the fact that the line of credit is ""necessary"" for the insurer to fulfill its obligations, it is nevertheless not 
the ""business of insurance."""
123,10," Thus, the benefit promised to Blue Shield policyholders under the policy is that they ""shall be required to pay no more than the 
drug deductible for each of such covered drugs."""
123,11," As the Court of Appeals stated: ""Blue Shield's policyholders are basically unconcerned with the contract between the insurer and the Participating Pharmacy. 
They are obligated to pay a Participating Pharmacy two dollars ($ 2.00) for a prescription regardless of the presence or absence 
of a price fixing arrangement.  Thus, by minimizing costs and maximizing profits, the Participating Pharmacy Agreements inure 
principally to the benefit of Blue Shield."" 556 F.2d 1375, 1381. "
124,12," As the United States points out in its amicus brief, there is an important distinction between risk underwriting and risk 
reduction.  By reducing the total amount it must pay to policyholders, an insurer reduces its liability and therefore its risk.  But 
unless there is some element of spreading risk more widely, there is no underwriting of risk."
124,13,"  LEdHN[7B][
] [7B]In National Securities, the Arizona Director of Insurance approved, pursuant to statute, a merger between 
two insurance companies.  This Court held, however, that the Arizona statute was not enacted for the purpose of regulating the 
""business of insurance."" 393 U.S., at 460. If a merger between two insurance companies is not the ""business of insurance,"" then 
an acquisition by an insurer of a manufacturer or a retail chain, although conceptually indistinguishable from the Pharmacy 
Agreements in this case, is also not the ""business of insurance."""
124,14," The petitioners argue that the absence of the Pharmacy Agreements ""which permit the insured to obtain drugs on the terms 
and for the amounts stated in the policies would constitute a breach of the contract of insurance."" But the benefit Blue Shield 
provides its policyholders is the assurance that they can obtain drugs in return for a direct maximum payment of $ 2 for each 
prescription.  The Pharmacy Agreements are separate contractual arrangements between Blue Shield and certain pharmacists 
fixing the cost Blue Shield will pay for drugs.  The wholly separate nature of the two categories of agreements is in no way 
affected by the fact that the Pharmacy Agreements are indirectly referred to in the insurance policies. "
125,15," Since the leading case of Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, 183, it had been understood that ""[issuing] a policy of insurance is not a 
transaction of commerce."""
125,16," S. Rep. No. 20, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1945); H. R. Rep. No. 143, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 2-3 (1945).  The problem was that 
if insurance was interstate commerce, then the constitutionality of state regulation and taxation would be questionable.  As the 
House Report stated: ""Inevitable uncertainties . . . followed the handing down of the decision in the Southeastern Underwriters Association case . . . . ""[Your] committee believes there is urgent need for an immediate expression of policy by the Congress with respect to the 
continued regulation of the business of insurance by the respective States.  Already many insurance companies have refused, 
while others have threatened refusal to comply with State tax laws, as well as with other State regulations, on the ground that to 
do so, when such laws may subsequently be held unconstitutional in keeping with the precedent-smashing decision in the 
Southeastern Underwriters case, will subject insurance executives to both civil and criminal actions for misappropriation of 
company funds."" Ibid.  (Emphasis added.)"
125,17," See text of statute at n. 1, supra."
125,18," There is no question that the primary purpose of the McCarran-Ferguson Act was to preserve state regulation of the activities 
of insurance companies, as it existed before the South-Eastern Underwriters case.  The power of the States to regulate and tax 
insurance companies was threatened after that case, because of its holding that insurance companies are in interstate 
commerce.  The McCarran-Ferguson Act operates to assure that the States are free to regulate insurance companies without "
126,," fear of Commerce Clause attack.  The question in the present case, however, is one under the quite different secondary purpose 
of the McCarran-Ferguson Act -- to give insurance companies only a limited exemption from the antitrust laws. The repeated insistence in the dissenting opinion that the McCarran-Ferguson Act should be read as protecting the right of the 
States to regulate what they traditionally regulated is thus entirely correct -- and entirely irrelevant to the issue now before the 
Court.  See n. 38, infra.  For the question here is not whether the McCarran-Ferguson Act made state regulation of these 
Pharmacy Agreements exempt from attack under the Commerce Clause.  It is the quite different question whether the Pharmacy 
Agreements are exempt from the antitrust laws. In short, the McCarran-Ferguson Act freed the States to continue to regulate and tax the business of insurance companies, in 
spite of the Commerce Clause.  It did not, however, exempt the business of insurance companies from the antitrust laws. It 
exempted only ""the business of insurance."" See SEC v. National Securities, Inc., 393 U.S. 453."
126,19," H. R. 3270, 78th Cong., 1st Sess. (1943); S. 1362, 78th Cong., 1st Sess. (1943).  These bills would have provided that nothing 
in the Sherman or Clayton Acts ""shall be construed to apply to the business of insurance or to acts in the conduct of that 
business or in any wise to impair the regulation of that business by the several States."""
126,20, 90 Cong. Rec. 6565 (1944).

event would be vetoed by the President.  91 Cong. Rec. 1087 (1945) (remarks of Rep. Hancock).  Also important was the 
opposition of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to a blanket antitrust exemption. 90 Cong. Rec. 8482 (1944)."
126,22," See n. 1, supra.  The purpose of the moratorium was to allow the States three years to take steps to regulate the business of 
insurance. 91 Cong. Rec. 1443 (1945) (remarks of Sen. McCarran)."

126,24," That Congress did not intend to restore the law to what it had been before South-Eastern Underwriters is made dramatically 
clear in the following exchange between Senator McKellar and Senator Ferguson: ""Mr. McKELLAR.  As I understand the bill its purpose and effect will be to establish the law as it was supposed to be prior to the 
rendering of the recent opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States.  Is that correct? ""Mr. FERGUSON.  No."" 91 Cong. Rec. 478 (1945). See also id., at 1444 (exchange between Sens. Pepper and McCarran). "
127,25," The recognition by Congress that the ability to control costs was not within the ability of insurance companies is further 
evidence that the Pharmacy Agreements, which are solely designed to minimize costs, are not insurance."
127,26, 90 Cong. Rec. A4403-4408 (1944).
127,27, 91 Cong. Rec. 483 (1945) (remarks of Sen. O'Mahoney).
127,28, 90 Cong. Rec. A4406 (1944).  This specific list of exempted activities was not included in the law ultimately enacted.
127,29," The dissenting opinion makes the argument that because Congress rejected bills that would have limited the ""business of 
insurance"" to a specific list of insurance company practices, Congress intended that the exemption it finally enacted be 
interpreted ""broadly."" Precisely the opposite is true. At the time Congress was considering one of the early versions of the Act, H. R. 3270, 78th Cong., 1st Sess. (1943), which 
would have wholly exempted from the antitrust laws ""the business of insurance or . . . acts in the conduct of that business,"" an 
amendment was introduced which would have exempted specific activities.  90 Cong. Rec. 6561 (1944).  The proponent of the 
amendment, Representative Anderson, explained that its purpose was to provide broader protection than provided by H. R. 
3270: ""But I say to this House that some legislation should be passed which asserts the right of the States to control the 
questions of risks, rates, premiums, commissions, policies, investments, reinsurance, capital requirements, and items of that 
nature.  It is for that purpose I have insisted upon bringing this at this time to the attention of the House.  If you pass H. R. 3270 
as it now stands and go back home and any of your insurance friends ask you what you did to safeguard the protection of "
128,," insurance by the State, you must answer them in all truth that all you did was to pass a bill which provided antitrust protection for 
companies now under indictment."" The amendment was defeated.  90 Cong. Rec. 6562 (1944). Thus, Congress rejected an amendment which exempted specific activities of insurance companies (not including anything 
remotely resembling the Pharmacy Agreements in this case) which was perceived to be broader than H. R. 3270.  Since H. R. 
3270 was itself broader than the Act as eventually enacted, it necessarily follows that the exemption of the Act is narrower than 
the bills which would have exempted specific practices.  This pattern is consistent with the entire legislative history of the 
McCarran-Ferguson Act, which was characterized by a continual narrowing of the original blanket exemption."
128,30," The dissenting opinion states that the ""compelling explanation"" for the lack of discussion of provider agreements in the 
legislative history was the congressional concern about fire insurance companies.  Post, at 234, n. 2.  However, input from all 
types of insurance companies was sought through the Insurance Commissioners of the various States ""because the 
Commissioners were aware of the chaotic condition which exists at the present time."" 91 Cong. Rec. 484 (1945) (remarks of 
Sen. Ferguson).  Moreover, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, whose concern was surely not limited to fire 
insurance, was certainly aware of provider agreements since it drafted model state enabling legislation to govern service-benefit 
health plans.  But this Association, which played a major role in the drafting of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, did not include 
provider agreements in its proposed bill exempting specific practices of insurance companies from the scope of the antitrust 
laws. 90 Cong. Rec. A4406 (1944).  Given this background, the failure of Congress to mention provider agreements, or anything 
in any way resembling them, suggests that Congress did not intend that provider agreements were to be exempt."
128,31," The dissenting opinion states that the National Securities case recognized that the legislative history of the Act ""sheds little 
light"" on the meaning of the ""business of insurance."" Post, at 234.  In National Securities, however, the Court went on to state 
that the legislative history indicated that ""Congress was mainly concerned with the relationship between insurance ratemaking 
and the antitrust laws, and with the power of the States to tax insurance companies."" 393 U.S., at 458-459."
128,32," One question not resolved by this legislative history is which of the various practices alleged in the South-Eastern 
Underwriters indictment Congress intended to be covered by the phrase ""business of insurance."" The indictment in that case 
had charged, for example, that the defendants had fixed their agents' commissions as well as premium rates.  It is clear from the 
legislative history that the fixing of rates is the ""business of insurance."" The same conclusion does not so clearly emerge with 
respect to the fixing of agents' commissions. The bills introduced before the South-Eastern Underwriters decision which would have totally exempted the insurance industry 
from the antitrust laws specifically included agreements regarding agents' commissions as an exempt practice.  E. g., H. R. 
4444, 78th Cong., 2d Sess. (1944).  Similarly, the bill proposed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners two "
129,," months after the South-Eastern Underwriters case was decided would have also exempted agents' commissions.  90 Cong. 
Rec. A4406 (1944).  The subsequent bill that followed the approach of the NAIC and exempted specific activities, however, was 
limited to traditional underwriting activities and made no mention of agreements with insurance agents: ยง 4 (b).  ""On and after March 1, 1946, the provisions of said Sherman Act shall not apply to any agreement or concerted or 
cooperative action between two or more insurance companies for making, establishing, or using rates for insurance, rating 
methods, premiums, insurance policy or bond forms, or underwriting rules . . . ."" S. 12, 79th Cong., 1st Sess. (1945). One inference that can be drawn from this pattern is that Congress was aware of the existence of agreements regarding agents' 
commissions, and chose not to include them within the exemption for the ""business of insurance."" On the other hand, the fact 
that the indictment in South-Eastern Underwriters had included a charge that insurance companies did boycott agents who 
insisted on selling other lines of insurance, together with the fact that ยง 3 (b) presumably removes an exemption that, but for its 
absence, would be conferred by ยง 2, suggests that the ""business of insurance"" may have been intended to include dealings 
within the insurance industry between insurers and agents. Even if it be assumed, however, that transactions between an insurer and its agents, including independent agents, are the 
""business of insurance,"" it still does not follow that the Pharmacy Agreements also fall within the definition.  Transactions 
between an insurer and an agent, unlike the Pharmacy Agreements, are wholly intra-industry; an insurance agent sells 
insurance while a pharmacy sells goods and services.  Moreover, there are historical reasons why the Pharmacy Agreements 
should not be considered the ""business of insurance,"" whatever may be the status of agreements between an insurer and its 
agents.  See Part III-D, infra."
129,33," The only case to the contrary was Cleveland Hospital Service Assn. v. Ebright, 142 Ohio St. 51, 49 N. E. 2d 929 (1943). There 
have been few cases dealing with the issue since the enactment of the McCarran-Ferguson Act; most of them have also held 
that Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans are not insurance.  See, e. g., Michigan Hospital Service v. Sharpe, 339 Mich. 357, 63 N. 
W. 2d 638 (1954); Hospital Service Corp. v. Pennsylvania Ins. Co., 101 R. I. 708, 227 A. 2d 105 (1967)."
129,34," The dissenting opinion argues that ""regulation of the service-benefit plans was a part of the system of state regulation of 
insurance that the McCarran-Ferguson Act was designed to preserve."" Post, at 240.  It is not at all clear that States that passed 
enabling statutes regarded the plans as insurance.  These statutes typically authorized the plans to operate but did not specify 
whether or not they were insurance.  E. g., 1935 Ill. Laws, p. 621 (""An Act to provide for the Incorporation and Regulation of 
nonprofit Hospital Service Corporations""); 1939 Mich. Pub. Acts No. 109 (""An Act to provide for and to regulate the incorporation 
of non-profit hospital service corporations""); 1938 N. J. Laws, ch. 336 (""An Act concerning hospital service corporations and 
regulating the establishment, maintenance and operation of hospital service plans""); ch. 698, 53 Stat. 1412 (1939) (""Providing 
for the incorporation of certain persons as Group Hospitalization, Inc."").  This latter statute enacted by Congress also provided in 
ยง 7: ""This corporation shall not be subject to the provisions of statutes regulating the business of insurance in the District of 
Columbia, but shall be exempt therefrom unless specifically designated therein."" The Senate Report stated: ""This bill does not 
change existing law but merely creates a private corporation which did not heretofore exist in the District of Columbia."" S. Rep. 
No. 1012, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1939).  At the time this statute was passed in 1939, the group health services plan in the 
District of Columbia had been construed not to be engaged in the business of insurance. Group Health Assn. v. Moor, 24 
F.Supp. 445 (DC 1938). "
130,," Indeed, courts have continued to hold that Blue Shield plans are not insurance even in States that have enacted enabling 
statutes.  E. g., Michigan Hospital Service v. Sharpe, supra.  In that case, the court specifically rejected the proposition that the 
existence of the enabling statute was sufficient to demonstrate that the plan was insurance. But even if certain aspects of a Blue Shield plan are the ""business of insurance,"" the Pharmacy Agreements in this case are not 
-- for all the reasons set out in this opinion.  It is to be emphasized that the question whether provider agreements like the 
Pharmacy Agreements in this case, or other aspects of insurance companies, were in 1945 or are now regulated by state law is 
irrelevant to the issue before the Court in the present case.  See n. 38, infra."
130,35," Despite the fact that courts did not view plans like Blue Cross and Blue Shield as insurance at the time of the passage of the 
McCarran-Ferguson Act, the petitioners argue that Attorney General Biddle's remarks when testifying in the Joint Hearing before 
the Subcommittees of the Committees on the Judiciary on S. 1362, H. R. 3269, and H. R. 3270, 78th Cong., 1st Sess., 41-42 
(1943), indicate a congressional understanding that such plans were indeed insurance. The thrust of Attorney General Biddle's remarks was that this Court's decision in American Medical Assn. v. United States, 317 
U.S. 519, justified the indictment in the South-Eastern Underwriters case.  In the AMA case, the Court had held that a health-
maintenance organization was engaged in ""trade"" within the meaning of the Sherman Act. Based on this decision, Attorney 
General Biddle expressed the view that the plan was insurance and that therefore the Court had already held that insurance was 
commerce.  Thus, he argued that the indictment in South-Eastern Underwriters was proper. It seems clear, however, why this testimony does not demonstrate that Congress believed that Blue Cross or Blue Shield plans 
are insurance.  First, the statement of the Attorney General that the plan in the AMA case was insurance was not accepted by 
Congress.  Senator Bailey rejected the characterization, pointing out that the Court had not referred to the plan as insurance.  To 
Senator Bailey, the plan was not insurance but a ""group cooperative movement."" (Indeed, the precise plan at issue was held not 
to be insurance in Jordan v. Group Health Assn., 71 App. D. C. 38, 107 F.2d 239 (1939).) But even if it can nonetheless be 
inferred that some Members of Congress may have agreed with the Attorney General that prepaid health plans are insurance, 
his testimony did not remotely suggest that agreements between an insurer and a third party fixing the cost at which goods and 
services will be purchased is also insurance. "
131,," Similarly, the fact that a few years later some witnesses at a Senate Committee hearing referred to Blue Cross as insurance in 
discussing alternatives to national health insurance, e. g., Hearings before the Senate Committee on Education and Labor on S. 
1606, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 1, pp. 172-176 (1946), does not establish that Congress shared this view, let alone that provider 
agreements like the Pharmacy Agreements in this case are insurance."
131,36," Weller, The McCarran-Ferguson Act's Antitrust Exemption for Insurance: Language, History and Policy, 1978 Duke L. J. 587, 
624 n. 174. As one commentator has stated about the effectiveness of the traditional opposition of these organizations to being 
characterized as insurance: ""[Insurance] experts are fond of expressing amazement at Blue Cross and Blue Shield opinion that the Blues are not insurance 
but something else, such as 'pre-payment plans.' The insurance experts should control their incredulity of this view, or at least 
save some for the courts.  For the fact is that the majority of cases have in effect upheld these so-called 'outrageous' opinions of 
Blue Cross adherents."" Denenberg, The Legal Definition of Insurance, 30 J. Ins. 319, 322 (1963)."
131,37," This is not to say that the contracts offered by Blue Shield to its policyholders, as distinguished from its provider agreements 
with participating pharmacies, may not be the ""business of insurance"" within the meaning of the Act."
131,38," This conclusion is in no way affected by the existence of state enabling statutes regulating advance-payment medical-benefits 
plans at the time the McCarran-Ferguson Act was enacted.  E. g., 1937 Cal. Stats., ch. 882, as amended by 1941 Cal. Stats., 
ch. 311; 1939 Conn. Pub. Acts, ch. 150; 1935 Ill. Laws, p. 621; 1936 Miss. Gen. Laws, ch. 177; 1939 Mich. Pub. Acts, No. 109; 
1938 N. J. Laws, ch. 719.  These statutes generally provided that the plans were not insurance.  See supra, at 226-227, and n. 
34.  Even if it is assumed that some state legislatures believed that these plans are insurance, however, it still does not follow 
that provider agreements like the Pharmacy Agreements in this case were considered by Congress to be the ""business of 
insurance."" Many aspects of insurance companies are regulated by state law, but are not the ""business of insurance."" Similarly, the enabling 
statutes in existence at the time the Act was enacted typically regulated such diverse aspects of the plans as the composition of 
their boards of directors, when their books and records could be inspected, how they could invest their funds, when they could 
liquidate or merge, as well as how they could purchase goods and services by entering into provider agreements. Provider agreements are no more the ""business of insurance"" because they were regulated by state law at the time of the 
McCarran-Ferguson Act than are these other facets of the plans which were similarly regulated. If Congress had exempted the 
""business of insurance companies,"" then these aspects of the plans which are not themselves insurance as that term is 
commonly understood would nevertheless be arguably exempt. But since Congress explicitly rejected this approach, they are 
not within the exemption even though they are the subject of state regulation. This Court has implicitly recognized that state regulation of a practice of an insurance company does not mean that the practice 
is the ""business of insurance"" within the meaning of the McCarran-Ferguson Act.  In both cases, SEC v. Variable Annuity Life 
Ins. Co., 359 U.S. 65, and SEC v. National Securities, Inc., 393 U.S. 453, the challenged conduct was regulated by the State 
Insurance Commissioner, but this Court held that the practices were not the ""business of insurance."" "
132,39,"  LEdHN[9B][
] [9B] LEdHN[10B][
] [10B]As the Court stated in Pennington, 381 U.S., at 665-666 (footnote omitted): ""[A] union may make wage agreements with a multi-employer bargaining unit and may in pursuance of its own union interests 
seek to obtain the same terms from other employers.  No case under the antitrust laws could be made out on evidence limited to 
such union behavior.  But we think a union forfeits its exemption from the antitrust laws when it is clearly shown that it had 
agreed with one set of employers to impose a certain wage scale on other bargaining units.  One group of employers may not 
conspire to eliminate competitors from the industry and the union is liable with the employers if it becomes a party to the 
conspiracy."""
132,40," There is no principled basis upon which a line could rationally be drawn that would extend the McCarran-Ferguson Act 
exemption only to an insurer's agreement with providers of goods and services to be furnished to its policyholders -- such as 
agreements with hospitals, doctors, lawyers, and the like.  But assuming that such a line could rationally be drawn, to hold that 
even such provider agreements are the ""business of insurance"" is to ignore the language and purpose of the Act not to exempt 
the insurance industry as such from the antitrust laws. Moreover, exempting provider agreements from the antitrust laws would be likely in at least some cases to have serious 
anticompetitive consequences.  Recent studies have concluded that physicians and other health-care providers typically 
dominate the boards of directors of Blue Shield plans.  Thus, there is little incentive on the part of Blue Shield to minimize costs, 
since it is in the interest of the providers to set fee schedules at the highest possible level.  This domination of Blue Shield by 
providers is said to have resulted in rapid escalation of health-care costs to the detriment of consumers generally.  See 
Skyrocketing Health Care Costs: The Role of Blue Shield, Hearings before the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of 
the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 95th Cong., 2d Sess., 4-34 (1978) (remarks of Michael Pertschuk, 
Chairman, Federal Trade Commission)."
132,41," It might be argued that some such agreements are exempt from the antitrust laws under the state-action exemption of Parker 
v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341. But that exemption would exist because of the extent of state regulation and not because the 
agreements are the ""business of insurance."" "
133,1," Section 2 (b) of the Act, as set forth in 15 U. S. C. ยง 1012 (b), provides: ""(b) No Act of Congress shall be construed to invalidate, impair, or supersede any law enacted by any State for the purpose of 
regulating the business of insurance, or which imposes a fee or tax upon such business, unless such Act specifically relates to 
the business of insurance: Provided, That after June 30, 1948, the Act of July 2, 1890, as amended, known as the Sherman Act, 
and the Act of October 15, 1914, as amended, known as the Clayton Act, and the Act of September 26, 1914, known as the 
Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended [15 U. S. C. 41 et seq.], shall be applicable to the business of insurance to the 
extent that such business is not regulated by State Law."" Section 3 (b), as set forth in 15 U. S. C. ยง 1013 (b), provides: ""(b) Nothing contained in this chapter shall render the said Sherman Act inapplicable to any agreement to boycott, coerce, or 
intimidate, or act of boycott, coercion, or intimidation."""
133,2," The Court argues that the silence with respect to agreements between insurers and third parties, coupled with the fact that 
Congressmen did discuss horizontal agreements between insurance companies, establishes by negative inference that third-
party agreements were not considered ""the business of insurance."" There is, however, a compelling explanation for the lack of 
mention of provider agreements.  As the Court has noted in several cases, see, e. g., SEC v. National Securities, Inc., 393 U.S. 
453, 459 (1969); St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Barry, 438 U.S. 531, 538-539 (1978), the McCarran-Ferguson Act was a 
reaction to the decision in United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Assn., 322 U.S. 533 (1944). See infra, at 236-237.  That 
case involved an organization of fire insurance companies, and much of the congressional discussion accordingly concerned 
alleged abuses by and regulation of such companies.  See, e. g., 91 Cong. Rec. 1091-1092, 1479 (1945); 90 Cong. Rec. 6449-
6455, 6527 (1944).  Indeed, health insurers did not even participate in the hearings on the Act.  See Joint Hearing before the 
Subcommittees of the Committees on the Judiciary on S. 1362 et al., 78th Cong., 1st Sess. (1943).  Since fire insurers paid their 
policyholders cash indemnities, these companies had no reason to contract with third parties for the provision of goods or 
services.  That fact fully explains the absence of discussion of such contracts in the congressional debates.  Such absence no 
more indicates a congressional intent to exclude provider agreements from the ""business of insurance"" than does the absence 
of any mention of health insurance companies indicate a congressional intent arbitrarily to exclude all health insurance from the 
""business of insurance."" "
134,3," S. 12, 79th Cong., 1st Sess. (1945), would have specified ""any agreement or concerted or cooperative action between two or more insurance companies for making, establishing, or using 
rates for insurance, rating methods, premiums, insurance policy or bond forms, or underwriting rules."" (Emphasis added.) See also ยง 4 (b) of a draft bill of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, 90 Cong. Rec. A4406 (1944).  A 
significant Senate floor debate with regard to such limiting bills is the following: ""MR. PEPPER.  Would it not be better that those agreements, if there are such that are legitimatized, be identified in the statute? ""MR. O'MAHONEY.  I quite agree with the Senator, and I endeavored to the very best of my ability to induce the committees of 
Congress to write into the law specific exemptions from the antitrust law, but I was unable to prevail in the Committee on the 
Judiciary and I was unable to prevail on the floor of the Senate."" 91 Cong. Rec. 1444 (1945). The Court challenges the conclusion that Congress intended to phrase the exemption broadly by referring to the legislative 
history of one obscure amendment to an early House version of the Act.  Ante, at 222-223, n. 29.  Closer examination of the 
short debate surrounding that amendment reveals only the Representatives' repeated expressions of their confusion over what 
the amendment meant.  See 90 Cong. Rec. 6562 (1944) (remarks of Reps. Summers, Hobbs, and Fernandez)."
134,4," There can be no quarrel with the Court's statement, ante, at 220, and n. 24, that the McCarran-Ferguson Act was not intended 
to restore the law, in all respects, to what it had been before South-Eastern Underwriters.  But the principal differences between 
pre-South-Eastern and post-McCarran-Ferguson law are irrelevant for purposes of this case, and do not detract from the Court's 
oft-repeated statement that the purpose of the Act was to preserve state regulatory schemes as they existed before South-
Eastern Underwriters. "
135,," Before South-Eastern, insurance companies might boycott, coerce, and intimidate without violating federal antitrust statutes 
since insurance was not considered ""commerce"" and hence was beyond the reach of federal law.  For the same reason, even 
unregulated insurance transactions were free from antitrust attack.  Finally, Congress, because of the ""commerce"" problem, 
could not otherwise regulate insurance.  None of these elements survived the decision in South-Eastern, and none was revived 
by McCarran-Ferguson.  These differences between pre-South-Eastern and post-McCarran-Ferguson law were what Senator 
Ferguson had in mind when he answered ""no"" to Senator McKellar's question, cited by the Court, ante, at 220 n. 24, asking 
whether the effect of the Act was to re-establish the law as it stood prior to South-Eastern.  This is revealed by quotation of 
Senator Ferguson's full answer to Senator McKellar. ""MR. FERGUSON.  No.  I would say that subsection (b), at the bottom of page 2, would allow the provisions of the Sherman Act 
to apply to all agreements or acts of boycott, coercion, or intimidation, and subsection 4 (a) would suspend the application of the 
provisions of the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act, insofar as States may regulate and tax such companies, until certain dates 
or until Congress may act in the meantime in respect to what Congress thinks should be done with the business of insurance."" 
91 Cong. Rec. 478 (1945). These discrete differences between pre-South-Eastern and post-McCarran-Ferguson law are not applicable here, and do not 
conflict with the holdings of this Court's prior opinions that, with respect to state-regulated insurance practices not constituting 
boycotts, McCarran-Ferguson was intended to preserve pre-existing state insurance regulation. This analysis also explains, and renders irrelevant for this case, Congress' rejection of the ""total"" exemption bills cited by the 
Court, ante, at 218-219, and n. 21.  Those bills, unlike the one that passed, would have exempted boycotts and unregulated 
transactions.  It was this aspect of the ""total"" exemption bills to which the National Association of Insurance Commissioners 
objected.  See 90 Cong. Rec. 8482 (1944).  These bills were rejected not because of a decision to narrow the scope of the 
nonboycott activities to be exempted, but because Congress determined that the business of insurance should be exempted 
only where regulated by the States, rather than unconditionally. "

136,8, See 91 Cong. Rec. 483 (1945) (remarks of Sen. O'Mahoney).
136,9," Debate arose during this period as to whether service-benefit plans were technically insurance.  See ante, at 225-230.  Most 
state insurance commissioners ruled during the 1930's that the plans constituted insurance, and therefore had to meet the 
capital stock, reserve, and assessment requirements applicable to the commercial stock and mutual insurance companies which 
offered cash indemnity policies.  Eilers 101.  In addition, this meant that the plans were subject to special state taxation.  Ibid. "
137,," Such holdings limited the feasibility of the plans at a time when they were widely perceived as being socially beneficial.  
Moreover, it was argued that these rulings were inappropriate to service-benefit plans, which were generally ""nonprofit,"" and 
often included guarantees by hospitals to provide services regardless of the financial state of the insurer -- potentially an 
adequate substitute for the cash reserves needed by indemnity plans.  Id., at 135-136, 239. Some courts, and even some Blue Cross-type organizations, attempted to surmount these barriers to effectuation of plans 
deemed to be in the public interest by arguing that the plans were not technically ""insurance"" subject to the jurisdiction of state 
insurance commissioners, and hence were not bound by the requirements of the stock and mutual insurance companies.  See, 
e. g., Jordan v. Group Health Assn., 71 App. D. C. 38, 107 F.2d 239 (1939). But see Cleveland Hospital Service Assn. v. 
Ebright, 142 Ohio St. 51, 49 N. E. 2d 929 (1943) (hospital service plans are insurance); McCarty v. King County Medical Service 
Corp., 26 Wash. 2d 660, 175 P. 2d 653 (1946) (same).  But contemporary commentators questioned the soundness of such 
views and argued that the plans should be treated as insurance, although as a special kind not subject to the traditional 
requirements.  See, e. g., Note, The Legal Problems of Group Health, 52 Harv. L. Rev. 809, 815 (1939); Comment, Group 
Health Plans: Some Legal and Economic Aspects, 53 Yale L. J. 162, 172 (1943). The 35 state enabling Acts governing service-
benefit health plans reflected the States' agreement that the plans were ""a special type of insurance"" differing from the stock and 
mutual companies.  Rorem II, p. 534; Sinai 48.  This is most clearly demonstrated by the fact that the vast majority of the state 
statutes, while relieving the plans of ""other"" insurance law requirements (primarily the reserve requirements and special 
insurance taxes), subjected their activities to the control of the state insurance commissioner.  The 1939 New Mexico Statute, for 
example, amended the State's Insurance Code by adding a new section entitled ""Non-Profit Hospital Service Plans."" The 
amendment subjected the plans, and in particular both their premiums and rates of payment to hospitals, to the approval of the 
Superintendent of Insurance, while exempting them from ""all other provisions of the insurance law."" 1939 N. M. Laws, ch. 66 
(emphasis added).  This approach was in accord with the commonly held view that such plans were forms of ""insurance,"" as 
reflected by the statements of numerous Congressmen in the congressional hearings on the proposed National Health Program, 
see infra, at 243.  And everyday meaning, rather than some technical term of art, is what Congress intended by its use of the 
word ""insurance"" in the McCarran-Ferguson Act."
137,10," Messages of two Presidents to the Congress on the subject of national health care also referred to service-benefit plans as 
forms of insurance.  Message from the President of the United States, Report and Recommendations on National Health, H. R. 
Doc. No. 120, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., 63 (1939); Message from the President, A National Health Program, H. R. Doc. No. 380, 
79th Cong., 1st Sess., 9, 10 (1945)."
137,11," The respondents do not argue this view.  They agree that some provider contracts may constitute the ""business of insurance."" 
Brief for Respondents 33. "
138,12," ""Underwriting,"" the Solicitor General argues, means ""[spreading] risk more widely or [reducing] the role of chance events."" 
Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 17 (hereinafter Government Brief).  For purposes of argument I will assume that this is 
a correct definition of ""underwriting."" But see R. Holtom, Underwriting Principles and Practices 11 (1973)."
138,13," The effort to distinguish insurer/agent transactions from provider agreements on the ground that the former are ""wholly intra-
industry"" while the latter are not, ante, at 225 n. 32, constitutes argument by tautology.  The former are ""intra-industry"" and the 
latter not, only because the Court so holds today."
138,14," See, e. g., 1935 Cal. Stats., ch. 386; 1939 Iowa Acts, ch. 222; 1937 Md. Laws, ch. 224; 1939 Me. Acts, ch. 149; 1939 N. H. 
Laws, ch. 80; 1939 S. C. Acts No. 296.  See also Rorem I, pp. 67-68; Sinai 48-49.  Such provisions were often quite extensive, 
e. g., requiring approval by the insurance commissioner of contracts between hospitals and the corporation, including rates of 
payment, ibid.; requiring that the contracts contain guarantees of services by the hospitals to policyholders despite financial 
difficulties of the insurer, Rorem I, p. 67; or even limiting the kind of hospitals with which contracts could be made, id., at 68. "
139,15," Indeed, unions negotiating for drug-coverage plans have requested that the plans include contractual arrangements with 
pharmacies, in order to guarantee that the policy's promises are kept.  See Brief for Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Assn. as 
Amicus Curiae 10-11. It might be argued that the drug-benefits policy could operate successfully without any agreement between Blue Shield and the 
pharmacies. The consumer could simply pay the pharmacist his full price, whereupon he would normally receive the drugs 
without hesitation.  Blue Shield could then reimburse the policyholder for the full price minus the $ 2 deductible.  This would not, 
however, be the policy bargained for in this case.  That policy guarantees provision of drugs upon a minimal $ 2 payment, 
without requiring the policyholder to advance the full price when the contingency of illness occurs -- a time when he may not be 
able to afford the out-of-pocket payment.  Moreover, such cash-reimbursement plans almost inevitably include payment ceilings, 
again distinguishing them from the full-coverage service plan bargained for in this case.  See discussion, infra, at 252, and n. 20."
139,16," The Court errs in its reading of SEC v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co., 359 U.S. 65 (1959). There a ""variable annuity"" plan was 
held not to be ""the business of insurance"" because all risk remained on the policyholder and no underwriting of risk occurred.  
The key to Variable Annuity is that neither the agreement at issue nor any with which it was involved effectuated a transference 
of risk.  Id., at 71. That is not the case here, where the policyholder has successfully transferred his risk by trading his premium 
for the certainty of benefits in the event of illness. "
140,17," Sinai 49.  See, e. g., 1937 Ga. Laws, p. 690; 1939 Iowa Acts, ch. 222; 1939 Mich. Pub. Acts No. 109; 1939 N. M. Laws, ch. 
66; 1939 Tex. Gen. Laws, p. 123.  The same is true of the modern state statutes.  See Eilers 106-107."
140,18," Indeed, some state insurance commissioners have made aggressive use of their authority over provider contracts as a means 
of controlling premium rates.  See Frankford Hospital v. Blue Cross of Greater Philadelphia, 417 F.Supp. 1104, 1106 (ED Pa. 
1976), aff'd, 554 F.2d 1253 (CA3), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 860 (1977); State of Michigan, Commissioner of Ins., No. 77-R-101 
(Mar. 3, 1977); State of Illinois, Dept. of Ins., Hearing No. 1607 (Apr. 8, 1977).  This may also explain why the Federal 
Government, in programs in which it functions as a health insurer, requires that its provider agreements include specified fee 
formulas.  See, e. g., 42 U. S. C. ยงยง 1395u, 1395x (v) (Medicare). "
141,19," The pharmacist respondents would not be better off if Blue Shield set acquisition cost as well as markup.  In that event they 
might not even meet the cost of their own outlays."
141,20," The plan here was ""bargained for"" in the literal sense.  It had its origins in a 1967 collective-bargaining agreement between the

141,21," The Solicitor General suggests that this test could be subverted by an insurer's decision to list all kinds of incidental and even 
unrelated transactions in its policy.  As with other forms of antitrust immunity, I have no difficulty concluding that ""sham"" 
arrangements should not be honored.  Cf.  Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 
144 (1961); California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508 (1972)."
141,22," These factors together are sufficient to decide this case.  I need not decide whether either would independently suffice, nor 
whether in the absence of these factors others might also be capable of bringing a provider agreement within the exemption. "

142,24," Such an arrangement could not be suspect simply because it would be anticompetitive, see discussion, supra, at 249.  Rather, 
that means of providing policy benefits might be regarded as so unnecessary, and so likely to have its principal impact on 
pharmacies rather than policyholders, as to cross the boundary line of what constitutes the ""business of insurance."" I intimate no 
view upon the question."
142,25," The analogies to other antitrust exemptions referred to by the Court, ante, at 231-232, are inapt.  It is true that as a general 
rule an ""exempt"" party loses its immunity when it makes an agreement that is outside the scope of the exemption. But that 
general rule has no application here unless one assumes what the respondents need to prove -- that the Pharmacy Agreements 
are outside the scope of the McCarran-Ferguson Act.  Reference to the cases under the Capper-Volstead Act is not helpful on 
the matter, as that Act limits its exemption to those who are ""engaged in the production of agricultural products as farmers, 
planters, ranchmen, dairymen, nut or fruit growers."" 42 Stat. 388, 7 U. S. C. ยง 291 (emphasis added).  As a result, this Court has 
held that agreements involving nonfarmers are not exempt. National Broiler Marketing Assn. v. United States, 436 U.S. 816 
(1978). As the Court emphasizes, however, the McCarran-Ferguson Act exemption was not written in terms of ""insurance 
companies,"" but extends instead to the ""business of insurance."" Hence, the participation of pharmacies does not automatically 
vitiate the exemption, as does the participation of nonfarmers in the Capper-Volstead ""analogy."" Nor is reference to the labor exemption helpful to the Court.  The quotation from Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 
665-666 (1965), cited by the Court, ante, at 232 n. 39, is in complete accord with what I would conclude here: ""[A] union [read 
'insurer'] may make wage [pharmacy] agreements with a multi-employer bargaining unit [a group of pharmacies] . . . .  But . . . 
[one] group of employers [pharmacies] may not conspire to eliminate competitors from the industry and the union [insurer] is 
liable with the employers [pharmacies] if it becomes a party to the conspiracy."" The labor exemption is a particularly poor 
analogy for the Court to stress because in yet another footnote, Pennington expressly approved a set of transactions virtually 
identical to those complained of in this case.  Here, respondents contend that Blue Shield adopted a uniform fee policy, even 
though it may have suspected that some pharmacies would not be able to compete if required to limit their markup to that 
demanded by Blue Shield.  There was, however, no additional evidence of a conspiracy among the participating pharmacies to 
drive out their less able brethren, which Blue Shield then joined.  This was precisely the set of circumstances held by the 
Pennington Court to be within the scope of the exemption: ""Unilaterally, and without agreement with any employer group to do so, a union may adopt a uniform wage policy and seek 
vigorously to implement it even though it may suspect that some employers cannot effectively compete if they are required to 
pay the wage scale demanded by the union.  The union need not gear its wage demands to wages which the weakest units in 
the industry can afford to pay.  Such union conduct is not alone sufficient evidence to maintain a union-employer conspiracy 
charge under the Sherman Act. There must be additional direct or indirect evidence of the conspiracy."" 381 U.S., at 665 n. 2. "
143,," Thus, the approach taken by the Court today does not merely ""narrowly"" construe ""insurance"" in accordance with our general 
practice.  Rather, that approach actively discriminates between kinds of insurance, effectively confining ""insurance"" to traditional 
forms and effectively excluding forms that provide full-service coverage via provider agreements.  It thereby places a significant 
obstacle in the path of the latter."
143,26," The Court argues, ante, at 232 n. 40, that provider agreements may have anticompetitive consequences which could lead to 
escalation of health-care costs.  The argument is not without force, but I must note that the very purpose of an antitrust 
exemption is to protect anticompetitive conduct.  The argument, therefore, is better directed to the legislature, which has the 
power to modify or repeal McCarran-Ferguson, rather than to this Court.  Referral to the legislators is particularly appropriate in 
this case, as the policy aspects may not be as one-sided as those painted by the Court.  There is authority for the proposition 
that provider agreements, far from increasing costs, constitute an effective means for reduction in health-care prices and 
premiums. Council on Wage and Price Stability, Employee Health Care Benefits: Labor and Management Sponsored 
Innovations in Controlling Cost, 41 Fed. Reg. 40298, 40305 (1976). And the argument that ""there is little incentive on the part of 
Blue Shield to minimize costs, since it is in the interest of the providers to set fee schedules at the highest possible level"" 
overlooks the vital consideration that many if not most of these plans originate in collective-bargaining agreements where ""the 
consumer power and negotiating expertise of organized labor"" combine to ""reduce the unit price of health services."" Ibid.  
Control over provider agreements by state insurance commissioners constitutes a second ""incentive"" operating in the same 
direction.  See n. 18, supra.  Whether or not the potential anticompetitive impact of McCarran-Ferguson outweighs these positive 
effects on health-care costs is a judgment properly to be made by Congress. "

148,3," When a federal statute condemns an act as unlawful, the extent and nature of the legal consequences of the condemnation, 
though left by the statute to judicial determination, are nevertheless federal questions, the answers to which are to be derived 
from the statute and the federal policy which it has adopted. Sola Elec. Co. v. Jefferson Elec. Co., 317 U.S. 173, 176, 63 S. Ct. 172, 174, 87 L. Ed. 165 (1942)."
148,4," Among courts allowing contribution in other areas of the law there is a conflict as to whether contribution is available on a pro 
rata or comparative fault basis.  Compare Herzfeld v. Laventhol, Krekstein, Horwath & Horwath, 378 F. Supp. 112, 136 & n. 58 
(S.D.N.Y.1974), Aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 540 F.2d 27 (2d Cir. 1976), And Globus, Inc. v. Law Research Serv., Inc., 318 F. 
Supp. 955, 958 (S.D.N.Y.1970), Aff'd, 442 F.2d 1346 (2d Cir.), Cert. denied, 404 U.S. 941, 92 S. Ct. 286, 30 L. Ed. 2d 254

400, 405 (7th Cir. 1974), And Gomes v. Brodhurst, 394 F.2d 465, 469-70 (3d Cir. 1968). Because of the administrative 
difficulties of assessing exact percentages of fault in complicated antitrust actions and because we believe a rule of pro rata 
contribution will serve as a more effective deterrent to antitrust violations (I. e., under a comparative fault rule some parties may 
feel they have little to lose in joining in an antitrust violation in a minor capacity), we adopt a rule of pro rata contribution except in 
unusual circumstances.  See Wassel v. Eglowsky, 399 F. Supp. 1330, 1370-71 (D.Md.1975), Aff'd 542 F.2d 1235 (4th Cir.

Coconspirators in Antitrust Treble Damage Actions, 31 Ford.L.Rev. 111, 138-39 (1962)."
148,5," In light of our holding we do not pass on National's claim that to deny it both contribution and indemnification would violate the 
due process clause."
148,6," In Goldlawr, Inc. v. Shubert, 276 F.2d 614, 616 (3d Cir. 1960), the Third Circuit stated: ""there would seem to be strong 
justification for appellee's contention that the tort asserted to lie in the third party complaint is governed by federal common law 
with no right of contribution between tort feasors"" (footnotes omitted).  However, this statement was dictum since the holding of 
the case was that the defendants-third-party plaintiffs and the third-party defendants were not joint tortfeasors. Further, this case 
is not persuasive authority for the position of no contribution in that no reasoning was provided to support the court's statement.  
American Motor Inns, Inc. v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 521 F.2d 1230 (3d Cir. 1975), and Walker Distrib. Co. v. Lucky Lager Brewing 
Co., 323 F.2d 1 (9th Cir. 1963), were also cited by the court in Wilson P. Abraham Constr. Co. v. Texas Indus., Inc., No. 75-2820 
(E.D.La. Oct. 5, 1977), as holding that there is no right of contribution in federal antitrust cases.  These cases only state the 
general rule, with which we do not disagree, that a plaintiff may choose to not join all coconspirators in an anti-trust action.  
American Motor Inns, Inc. v. Holiday Inns, Inc., supra, 521 F.2d at 1244-45 n. 42; Walker Distrib. Co. v. Lucky Lager Brewing 
Co., supra, 323 F.2d at 8. Such a statement stops far short of holding that one conspirator is not entitled to contribution from 
other coconspirators. "
149,7," The trend among the states has been to allow contribution.  A minimum of 23 states have enacted statutes which permit at 
least limited contribution and 6 other states are generally cited as having case law which recognizes the right to contribution "
150,," where there is not intentional misconduct.  See P. Corbett, Apportionment of Damages and Contribution Among Coconspirators 
in Antitrust Treble Damage Actions, 31 Ford.L.Rev. 111, 113 (1962). "
151,8," The factors listed by Justice White in connection with whether an in pari delicto defense should be allowed in an antitrust 
action are ""facts as to the relative responsibility for originating, negotiating, and implementing the scheme; evidence as to who 
might reasonably have been expected to benefit from the provision or conduct making the scheme illegal under ยง 1; proof of 
whether one party attempted to terminate the arrangement and encountered resistance or counter-measures from the other; 
facts showing who ultimately profited or suffered from the arrangement."" Perma Life Mufflers v. International Parts Corp., supra, 
392 U.S. at 146-47, 88 S. Ct. at 1988 (White, J., concurring). "
152,9," Furthermore, in its complaint Professional alleges that National violated section 2 of the Sherman Act by intentionally doing 
acts designed to exclude Professional as a competitor.  Thus for Professional to prevail against National it will have to show that 
National was an intentional wrongdoer. Thus, the sound reasoning of the security cases which deny indemnity to tortfeasors who 
have committed a wrong graver than ordinary negligence is equally applicable here.  These cases have held that HN9[
] where 
a party has been found guilty of misconduct in violation of the public interest as embodied in the securities laws, it would offend 
public policy to allow indemnification. See, e. g., Alexander & Baldwin, Inc. v. Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co., supra, 385 F. Supp. 
at 238-39; Herzfield v. Laventhol, Krekstein, Horwath & Horwath, supra, 378 F. Supp. at 135; Globus v. Law Research Serv., 
Inc., 287 F. Supp. 188, 199 (S.D.N.Y.1968), Aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 418 F.2d 1276 (2d Cir. 1969), Cert. denied, 397 U.S. 913,

v. American-Hawaiian Steamship Co., supra, 387 F. Supp. at 166-68, where the courts held that HN10[
] indemnification was 
not available even if the security violation was merely negligent.  National should not be permitted to secure indemnity on a 
theory inconsistent with the theory on which it is ultimately held liable, I. e., that it was secondarily liable only because of La 
Maur's wrongdoing. "

184,1," Section 17045 prohibits the making of secret payments to the injury of competitors where such payments tend to destroy 
competition. Both plaintiff in its complaint and defendants in their counterclaim complained of violations. The jury declined to "
185,," award damages to either party. Inasmuch as no party has taken exception to this part of the verdict, the Court will not consider 
this phase of the case. "
187,2," There was, in addition, evidence that the rates charged by defendants were treated as the going rate and were followed by 
others performing ship assist services on the Bay."
187,3," Inasmuch as Bay Cities and Red Stack were commonly owned and controlled, their market shares may reasonably be 
aggregated for purposes of determining whether they possessed monopoly power. The fact that they chose to behave as "
188,," separate firms competing with each other in the market (See Part V. A. infra ) does not eliminate the existence of Power derived 
from their combined market share by the person controlling their operations, regardless of whether it was exercised."
188,4," Lester Bedient, then president of Bay Cities, cabled Thomas Crowley, who was on vacation in Switzerland, to report this event 
and advise that he would contact the union about it."
188,5," From August 1971 to May 1972, Murphy Tugboat had only one small tugboat on the Bay. From May 1972 to June 1973, it had 
one large tug, one small tug, and another small tug for several months. From June 1973 to September-October 1974, it had in 
service on the Bay two large tugs, a small tug, and another small tug for three months. From October 1974 to April 1975, it had 
only one large tug on the Bay. From April 1975 to September 1975, when operations ceased, the company had one large tug 
and one small tug. Thus, for the four years of its operation, Murphy Tugboat had two large tugboats for only one and one-half years. For 
approximately two years, it had only one large tug. For one-half year, it had only a small tug. Murphy had four vessels on the 
Bay (two large tugs and two small tugs) for only three months in 1973. "
189,6," Plaintiff's brief is of little assistance here. It relies primarily on Lorain Journal Co. v. United States, 342 U.S. 143, 72 S. Ct. 181, 
96 L. Ed. 162 (1951), and Hartford-Empire Co. v. United States, 323 U.S. 386, 65 S. Ct. 373, 89 L. Ed. 322 (1945), both of which 
were government suits for injunctive relief and do not address the issue of liability for damages for past conduct. Plaintiff's 
contention that a treble damage judgment was subsequently rendered against both the corporate and individual defendants in 
the Lorain Journal litigation is apparently in error. See Elyria-Lorain Broadcasting Co. v. Lorain Journal Co., 298 F.2d 356, 357 
(6th Cir. 1961) (""plaintiff radio station had begun a civil action for treble damages against the newspaper . . .""). In any event, 
there is no discussion whatever in the cited decisions of liability of officers or directors. Hartford-Empire, to the extent it has any 
bearing on the present issue, simply confirms the necessity of proof of participation by the individuals in acts constituting steps in 
the progress of the wrongful conduct. 323 U.S. 386 at 407, 65 S. Ct. 373, 89 L. Ed. 322. "
191,7," That statement is not intended to suggest that proof of unlawful intent is necessary to impose civil liability on officers. Although 
that argument has been advanced by some commentators, See Whiting, Antitrust and the Corporate Executive (pt. I), 47 
Va.L.Rev. 1938 (1965), Note, The Antitrust Laws and the Corporate Executive's Civil Damage Liability, 18 Vand.L.Rev. 1938 
(1965), there is no warrant in the authorities previously discussed to impose a requirement which would in effect equate the 
standard of proof for civil and criminal liability. "
192,8," Whether plaintiff, as a competitor of defendant Red Stack, has standing under the antitrust laws to attack an agreement 
between Red Stack and an association of its employees which has a tendency to place a ceiling on the price charged by Red 
Stack for the package of services it offers in competition with plaintiff is a matter not free from doubt. While plaintiff and 
defendants were engaged in the same ""area of the economy,"" it does not follow that injury caused plaintiff by reason of a 
competitive advantage gained by defendants through an agreement controlling a component of the total price of their service is 
injury ""by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws."" 15 U.S.C. ยง 15; In re Multidistrict Vehicle Air Pollution MDL No. 31, 
481 F.2d 122, 125-29 (9th Cir.), Cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1045, 94 S. Ct. 551, 38 L. Ed. 2d 336 (1973); See also Brunswick Corp. 
v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 487-89, 97 S. Ct. 690, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977). Plaintiff has cited no cases supporting 
recovery under Section 4 of the Clayton Act based on conduct by a competitor enabling him to price below plaintiff, and a court 
should be loath to entertain attacks on arrangements (not shown to have exclusionary effects) between persons who are not 
competitors the purpose of which is to lower the cost of goods or services to consumers. See generally Murphy Tugboat Co. v. 
Crowley, 454 F. Supp. 847 (N.D.Cal.1978). In view of the disposition of this branch of the case, however, it is unnecessary to 
untangle this particular web; the court will therefore assume without deciding that plaintiff has standing."
192,9," While plaintiff has at times contended that the Red Stack pilots' agreement somehow ran afoul of the prohibition against tying, 
there is no evidence whatever to support such an argument. Nothing in the record suggests that Red Stack required or even "
193,," requested that its customers also use Red Stack masters as pilots; vessels were entirely free to use the (more expensive) 
services of independent pilots. Nor were Red Stack pilots precluded from rendering services outside working hours on whatever 
terms they might negotiate."
193,10," Suppose the Red Stack pilots' agreement had simply prohibited the Red Stack pilots from charging for pilotage service 
performed while engaged in their duties as Red Stack employees. The result would have been to increase the price differential 
between the two packages to plaintiff's disadvantage. But could plaintiff complain of a rule imposed by an employer prohibiting 
his employees from collecting fees for themselves from his customers? Such an apparently reasonable restriction on one's 
employees would not seem to be an antitrust violation. If that is true, it is difficult to see how a more limited understanding with 
one's employees having a lesser impact on competitors could be found to be unlawful."
193,11," Plaintiff points to a clause in the agreement stating that Red Stack shall not be liable for the acts of its employees when they 
are serving as pilots. But this clause is merely an attempt by Red Stack to relieve itself from liability; it does not change the 
essential fact that the pilotage services are furnished in connection with and as a result of the masters' employment by Red 
Stack. Moreover, the cases cited by plaintiff, even if relevant, do not support its contention that the masters are not acting within 
the scope of their employment when they perform pilotage services.  Bisso v. Inland Waterways Corp., 349 U.S. 85, 92-95, 75 S. 
Ct. 629, 99 L. Ed. 911 (1955); Sun Oil Co. v. Dalzell Towing Co., 287 U.S. 291, 294-95, 53 S. Ct. 135, 77 L. Ed. 311 (1932); 
United States v. SS President Van Buren, 490 F.2d 504-07 (9th Cir. 1973); and California v. S/T Norfolk, 435 F. Supp. 1039, 
1046-47 (N.D.Cal.1977), state no more than that for purposes of determining a vessel's liability, a pilot is considered the 
employee of the vessel he is navigating, not of the tug. That conclusion does not imply that the pilot cannot at the same time be 
viewed as acting within the general scope of his employment for purposes of applying the labor exemption especially where, as 
here, his pilotage is a direct result of his employment by the tug. Finally, plaintiff argues that the pilots' fees are not included in 
the W-2 statements issued by Red Stack and that the union's collective bargaining agreement does not discuss the pilotage 
work. But this contention, like plaintiff's other theories, ignores the totality of the circumstances of the Red Stack pilots' working 
conditions which give rise to the piloting services. "
195,12," Although plaintiff in its brief claims that ""the damage calculation for the customer boycott policy and the RSPA Agreement are 
entirely separate and cumulative,"" that is not the way in which plaintiff's case was presented to the jury. In his summation, 
counsel for plaintiff did not ask the jury to award damages discretely caused by that agreement. Instead, he treated that 
agreement as a part of defendants' exclusionary practices which caused plaintiff to lose jobs and revenue, for which loss he 
asked for aggregate damages of $ 669,666. (R.T. 4079-86, 4089-96) Inasmuch as the jury also awarded plaintiff damages for 
loss caused by defendants' exclusionary practices under Section 2, the instant award of $ 100,000 would in any case have to be 
struck as duplicative, requiring a new trial. Cf.  Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 401 U.S. 321, 348, 91 S. Ct. 795, 
28 L. Ed. 2d 77 (1971)."
195,13," The conspiracy claim against Thomas Crowley was previously dismissed on the ground that an officer is legally incapable of 
conspiring with the corporation by which he is employed. See Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc. v. Hawaiian Oke & Liquors, Ltd., 
supra, 416 F.2d at 82-83. See also Part IV. A. Supra. "
196,14," Although there is evidence reflecting public awareness that both Bay Cities and Red Stack were ""Crowley companies,"" it is 
clear that customers dealt with each company separately and that, when it came to doing business with them, they were not 
regarded as being either unitary or interchangeable."
196,15," The capacity issue was submitted by the Court to the jury, which apparently encountered great difficulty in dealing with it. On 
reflection, it seems to the Court to be more of a legal than factual issue (at least where, as here, none of the relevant facts are 
disputed) and hence more properly resolved by the Court, but there appear to be no reported decisions on this question. "
197,16," Before the trial began, plaintiff pursued the theory that defendants conspired to depress the prices they charged for their 
services, presumably for the purpose of preventing plaintiff from operating profitably. The Court rejected this theory as a basis 
for computing damages, reserving for the trial the question whether defendants' pricing might be evidence of conduct violating 
Section 1 or 2.  Murphy Tugboat Co. v. Crowley, supra, 454 F. Supp. at 850. Plaintiff produced no evidence at the trial, however, "
198,," from which a jury could find that defendants acted jointly to depress prices. The only evidence offered in this respect reflecting a 
relative increase in the labor to revenue ratio maintained by Bay Cities and Red Stack from time to time raised no inference of 
joint action to maintain depressed prices. Moreover, the substantive evidence disclosed that the prices charged by both Red 
Stack and Bay Cities, which differed from each other, exceeded average variable costs, exceeded the prices charged by plaintiff, 
and generally even produced a net profit. The Court therefore instructed the jury that these prices were lawful and could not be 
considered in arriving at a verdict for plaintiff under Section 1 or 2. The Court adheres to that view and further discussion of 
pricing under either Section 1 or 2 is therefore unnecessary. See Janich Bros. Inc. v. American Distilling Co., supra, 570 F.2d 
848."
198,17," As stated in note 16 Supra, plaintiff's original theory of damages was premised on the existence of a conspiracy among 
defendants to depress the charges for ship assist services. Damages consisting of lost profits were sought on the theory that, 
but for defendants' conspiracy, their charges would have been higher, allowing plaintiff to increase its charges and thereby 
increase its revenue without additional expense. In a prior ruling, the Court rejected plaintiff's offer of proof based on this theory.  
Murphy Tugboat Co. v. Crowley, supra, 454 F. Supp. 847."
198,18," For purposes of deciding the damage issue on the motion for judgment n. o. v., the Court will adopt plaintiff's interpretation of 
the verdict (Exh. A, attached) that the jury assessed $ 600,000 against defendants jointly and severally, and that the assessment 
of particular amounts to specific defendants was surplusage. In the event the judgment were overturned on that issue, however, the verdict must properly be treated as imposing on each 
defendant liability for a specified amount of damages. The form of verdict specifically asked the jury to find and state separately 
the amount of damage caused by each defendant found to be liable. The terms of the verdict form cannot be ignored. Cf. 
Fed.R.Civ.P. 49(b) (in case of inconsistency between a general verdict and the jury's answers to special interrogatories, the 
latter control). The assessments of $ 180,000 each against Thomas Crowley and Crowley Maritime must then be set aside for "
199,," the reasons stated in Part III. B., Supra. There would remain assessments of $ 160,000 and $ 80,000 against Red Stack and 
Bay Cities, respectively. Inasmuch as each may be separately liable for monopolization and attempt to monopolize, the jury 
could properly find each to be responsible for a different amount of damage. This holding does not conflict with the common law principle that a jury has no right to apportion damages among joint 
tortfeasors, and that if it does, the total damage award will control and the attempted apportionment will be treated as 
surplusage. See Gates v. L. G. DeWitt, Inc., 528 F.2d 405, 413 (5th Cir. 1976) (applying state common law); Dauenhauer v. 
Sullivan, 215 Cal.App.2d 231, 30 Cal.Rptr. 71, 74 (1963); Annot., 46 A.L.R.3d 801, 830-35 (1972). In those cases, the jury acted 
on its own in deciding to apportion damages after first determining a lump sum damage award. Here, however, the jury acted in 
accordance with the Court's instruction that it first assess the damage caused by Each defendant and then total these amounts. 
Plaintiff did not object to this form of verdict at the time of trial. It cannot now contend that the jury actually meant to award $ 
600,000 jointly and severally against defendants. "
200,19," The cases cited by plaintiff confirm the necessity of proof sufficient to permit a reasonable inference that the loss or damage 
was attributable to acts of defendants. In Eastman Kodak Co. v. Southern Photo Materials Co., 273 U.S. 359, 47 S. Ct. 400, 71 
L. Ed. 684 (1927), where plaintiff, a distributor, complained of having been illegally cut off by defendant, its supplier, plaintiff's 
damage proof was based on a comparison with revenue it had received during the period prior to the cutoff. In Story Parchment 
Co. v. Paterson Parchment Paper Co., supra, 282 U.S. 555, 51 S. Ct. 248, 75 L. Ed. 544, where plaintiff complained of predatory 
price cuts, the proof was based on comparison of the prices previously charged with the unlawfully cut prices, allowing the jury to 
compute damages based on the differential. In Bigelow v. RKO Radio Pictures, Inc., supra, 327 U.S. 251, 66 S. Ct. 574, 90 L. 
Ed. 652, where plaintiff complained of having been deprived of first run motion pictures, the proof was based on comparison with 
the profits received by defendants' comparable theatre and also with the earnings of plaintiff's theatre during a prior period when 
it had received some first runs. And in Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., supra, 395 U.S. 100, 89 S. Ct. 1562, 23 L. 
Ed. 2d 129, where plaintiff complained of having been excluded from the Canadian market for television sets and radios by an 
illegal patent pool, plaintiff's damage proof was based on its share in the comparable United States market and its ability to 
obtain the same share in Canada had its marketing not been impeded by defendant's conspiracy to deny it patent licenses.  Id. 
at 116 n. 11, 123-25, 89 S. Ct. 1562. These decisions do not support plaintiff's contention that its operating losses constitute 
proof of the amount of damage attributable to defendants' wrongful conduct simply because that conduct precluded it from 
obtaining substantial additional business which it could have handled profitably."
200,20," Plaintiff's damage theories have undergone several metamorphoses and no useful purpose would be served by recapitulating 
their evolution. At oral argument on these motions, the Court expressed its concerns on the damage issue and invited counsel to 
submit further memoranda setting out the theory and the substance of the supporting evidence. The following discussion then 
addresses plaintiff's position as most recently taken in its post-argument memorandum. Regrettably, plaintiff chose not to respond to the Court's specific request at oral argument to address in its memorandum its 
theory of damages under the Red Stack pilots' agreement. The Court in this opinion has therefore had to rely on the arguments 
and theories previously urged by plaintiff on this aspect of the case. "
201,21," In his closing argument to the jury, plaintiff's counsel put it as follows: ""Now what kind of losses did we have? These losses on this chart are the losses from all operations for four years. And this is 
from Mr. Murphy's testimony, when he referred to his income tax returns, and this is the figure: $ 306,217. Those were our actual 
losses. And those are the losses that Professor McFadden testified that had we been operating in a competitive market where 
we had not been excluded, where we had free access to the big ships and the flat tows, those are the losses we would not have 
had."" (R.T. 4093)."
201,22," Such evidence as there was refuted, rather than supported, the claim that plaintiff's tax losses provided a basis for a just and 
reasonable estimate of its antitrust losses. The evidence showed, for example, that plaintiff operated at a profit during its first 
year, when defendants' practices were the same as later, but that this profit was converted to a loss in subsequent years when 
plaintiff (1) increased officers' salaries substantially, e.g., Murphy's own salary went from $ 11,000 in 1971 to a high of $ 61,000 
in 1975, at a time when operating results were the lowest (R.T. 640-42, 3451, 3511-12); (2) paid $ 9700 for a speedboat which 
produced only $ 600 of revenue and was used mainly for Mr. Murphy's pleasure (R.T. 770-73); (3) acquired an underpowered 
tug, the San Clemente, which, according to an application for a Small Business Administration loan, was ""a terrific drain on the 
company,"" (R.T. 786, Exh. G3); and (4) paid $ 1000 for a coffee table which Mr. Murphy used in his home (R.T. 775-76; Exh. V). 
Finally, defendants' accountant showed that plaintiff incurred a two-year loss of $ 28,100 in its ship assist operations in 
Sacramento, where defendants did not operate and their practices therefore had no effect (R.T. 3440, 3460). Mr. Murphy's less 
detailed calculations showed that the Sacramento operation earned $ 4100 during these two years (R.T. 3869), but his 
testimony suggested that it suffered a loss instead. While these would normally of course be matters for the jury to weigh, they 
are relevant to the legal issue whether the proof offered of operating losses could qualify as the basis for a just and reasonable 
estimate of damages by the jury. "
202,23, See note 5 Supra.
202,24," A further difficulty with extrapolation from plaintiff's 28 percent share of the small vessel jobs is that this share resulted in part 
from plaintiff's exclusion from the large vessel jobs. Defendants' practice inevitably forced plaintiff to concentrate on small 
vessels, leading to a penetration of that market segment greater than it would have been had plaintiff spread its limited 
resources over both small and large vessel jobs. Thus, plaintiff, by relying on the 28 percent figure, is in a sense seeking to profit 
from defendants' wrong, something it should not be permitted to do. See Eastman Kodak Co. v. Southern Photo Materials Co., 
supra, 273 U.S. at 378, 47 S. Ct. 400. A related difficulty concerns the effect on plaintiff's share of small vessel jobs had it acquired the 28 percent share of large vessel 
jobs. Plaintiff's position on this question has vacillated. This of course is not a case where plaintiff had a proven capacity to 
handle additional volumes of business. Nor is this a case where plaintiff proposed to acquire additional equipment, intending 
instead to rely on the availability of defendants' equipment to augment its own capacity. Professor McFadden's prediction in this regard that plaintiff could have greatly expanded its volume with its existing fleet of tugs 
(See note 5 Supra ) depended on his assumption that each of plaintiff's tugs had a capacity of 2.9 jobs per day, and that plaintiff 
had not been working at its full capacity. (R.T. 2257-62) However, this capacity figure is speculative and is based only on Mr. 
Murphy's observation that during a five-month period, one of his tugs, the Go Getter, averaged 2.9 jobs per day. (R.T. 2104-05) 
There are serious problems with plaintiff's approach of taking the total number of jobs done, dividing by the number of workdays, 
and then assuming that this is the capacity of each tug for purposes of calculating damages: Red Stack did not operate at this 
2.9 figure, although there is no reason to assume it was less efficient than Murphy; the 2.9 figure does not take into account the 
need to have standby capacity to handle periods of peak demand; and it is speculative to assume that each Murphy tug, no 
matter what size or in what condition, would have the same capacity as the Go Getter, a large tug which alone operated 
continuously for 3 1/2 years. (R.T. 2467-85, 2509-14) "
203,25," Bay Cities' financial statements, from which plaintiff derived the 8.2 percent figure, were received into the record in connection 
with plaintiff's sales below cost claim. There was no suggestion when they were offered that they would be used as a basis for 
making a comparison to support the claim for future profits, advanced for the first time in closing argument. This use, without 
adequate foundation that Bay Cities' business was comparable to plaintiff's, would in any event require granting a new trial on 
damages."
203,26," The confusion engendered in the jury's mind by plaintiff's ""damage proof"" is confirmed by the verdict. In the closing argument 
counsel for plaintiff stated that ""our total losses are . . . in this amount, $ 669,666,"" and went on: ""And that is what we firmly feel that these defendants damaged Murphy Tug, in that amount. And that is what we ask you to 
award as your verdict."" (R.T. 4096) With no other relevant evidence before it, the jury awarded an aggregate of $ 700,000, assessing different amounts for which 
there is no apparent basis against Bay Cities, Red Stack, Crowley Maritime and Thomas B. Crowley on the Section 2 claim and 
Red Stack on the Red Stack pilots' agreement claim. "
205,1," At trial the parties presented several stipulations, some of which were marked as ""Court Exhibits."" There was an additional 
stipulation which was not given a number.  The Court informed the parties that the Court would hear arguments as to the "
206,," admissibility of the unnumbered exhibit at the time of arguments for a directed verdict. For purposes of this opinion, the Court 
considered all stipulations as part of plaintiff's case."

being illegal although the performances promised are not; also with respect to the transaction of business without a license.  It 
will be found that the determination of divisibility may depend as much upon the remedy that is sought (specific performance,

233,2," The request for peer review almost always comes from the insurer although, on occasion, chiropractors and their patients have 
requested peer review if the insurer has denied or reduced a claim and it is hoped that favorable review from the Committee

patients' claims on several occasions. "
234,3," Rule 10(b), Fed. R. Civ. P., requires that the contents of each alleged claim be limited as far as practicable to a statement of a 
single set of circumstances and that each claim founded upon a separate transaction be stated in a separate count whenever 
separation facilitates the clear presentation of the matters set forth.  In apparent disregard of this rule, the complaint 
amalgamates in a single count the federal antitrust claim and the state law defamation claim.  Since the parties have treated the 
complaint as attempting to state two separate causes of action, the court will do so as well. "

in Royal Drug, stating: Transactions between an insurer and an agent, unlike the Pharmacy Agreements, are wholly intra-

carriers participate.  Deposition of Horace F. Hartley at 61-62."
248,4," Rule 2 of the Rules and Regulations defines Class A carriers as: common carriers of passengers and/or property operating over a fixed route or between fixed termini in intrastate and interstate 
commerce, under Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity. "
251,5," Had the defendants argued, or had they established, that state law required all prices for identical services along the same 
route be uniform, this would be a very different case.  We do not doubt that the five subject states are capable of entirely 
displacing the marketplace mechanism of setting prices with a system in which price competition plays no part.  The states might 
have determined that their businesses and consumers would be best protected by a regulatory rate-making process that 
mandates uniform prices for a given service, typically based on a ""just and reasonable"" standard, than by the marketplace.  
Consequently, they could have replaced price competition with a state-mandated price-setting scheme in which intrastate 
common carriers would compete, but only by means other than price competition. The nature of the carrier's participation in such a system regulated by legislative or administrative mandate would seem to be 
entirely different from the nature of its role in the marketplace.  Where price competition is permitted (and protected), the 
individual participant attempts to lower prices so as to attract business from his competitors. Once prices are regulated, 
however, his participation in the price-setting ""system"" changes significantly, for his interest will usually lie in raising prices 
instead of lowering them.  By charging a lower price he will ordinarily not gain an advantage over his competitors, who must 
always charge an identical price.  Moreover, he will act in essentially the same manner regardless of whether he is alone or 
combining with other carriers, by attempting to convince the regulatory body to accept higher tariffs. Were prices made uniform by state mandate, we would question the applicability of an antitrust theory designed to stimulate 
price competition.  Indeed it would be doubtful that such practices as are engaged in by the defendant conferences could 
correctly be said to be ""in restraint of trade,"" within the meaning of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. The parties have made it clear, 
however, that each of the subject states guarantees to individual carriers the right to charge rates lower than their competitors' 
rates for identical service.  E.g., Statement of Material Facts, submitted in support of SMCRC's motion for summary judgment, 
filed Aug. 1, 1978, at 3, 4.  By preserving the carriers' right of independent action, the subject states have permitted, to an 
admittedly limited degree, price competition.  HN9[
] Within the range of rates that will be approved as just and reasonable, 
See United States v. Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad Co., 294 U.S. 499, 506, 55 S. Ct. 462, 79 L. Ed. 1023 
(1935), the states do not impede the ability of the carriers to set prices competitively. "
252,6," See Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, 433 U.S. 350, 361 n.13, 97 S. Ct. 2691, 53 L. Ed. 2d 810 (1977), noting that only four 
justices joined in that part of Cantor v. Detroit Edison, 428 U.S. 579, 96 S. Ct. 3110, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1141 (1976), holding Parker 
inapplicable to private defendants.  In Cantor, however, Justice Stevens went on to suggest circumstances under which merely 
private conduct required by state law would still be exempt from the Sherman Act. Since his discussion of those circumstances 
was adopted by a majority of the court, the question of whether private parties are protected under Parker is largely mooted: a 
private party claiming ""state action"" exemption must always satisfy the stricter Cantor requirements. "
256,7," For an excellent presentation of the pertinent inquiry in such a case, See Sullivan, supra, ยง 238 at 738-39."
256,8," A review of existing authority on the state action doctrine suggests the necessity of specifying the meaning we ascribe to the 
notion of compulsion by the state.  Professors Areeda and Turner have argued that courts ought not require state ""compulsion"" 
of a private activity as a prerequisite to invocation of the state action defense.  P. Areeda & Turner, I Antitrust Law ยง 215 
(1977).  Over-application of the Cantor principle that many regulatory decisions are industry-initiated, these observors fear, may 
lead courts to find antitrust liability in circumstances where, unlike Cantor, the challenged private practice lies at the heart of the 
regulatory scheme.  Areeda and Turner cite the facts in Parker to illustrate a situation in which industry participation in regulatory 
decision making should not render the state action defense unavailable. Areeda and Turner, are employing a special definition of state ""compulsion."" They characterize both Parker and Cantor as cases 
in which there was not ""compulsion,"" evidently based on the fact that the Impetus for the state action came from the regulated 
entities. The language of Cantor, and our discussion here, however, analyses compulsion differently.  Justice Stevens specifically 
described the light bulb tie-in as ""required."" 428 U.S. 579 at 592, 96 S. Ct. 3110, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1141. He then determined that 
such compelled activity might be protected under either an ""unfairness"" or an ""already regulated"" theory.  In either case, the 
threshold compulsion that existed arose from the fact that state law Formally required the tie-in by virtue of the Commission's 
having approved Detroit Edison's tariff: so long as there was no new filing, Detroit Edison had to continue the light bulb 
distribution program.  It is only this minimal, formal, compulsion that we find to be a necessary element to a Parker defense. "
257,9," Earlier in its opinion, the Court quoted, with apparent approval, the order of the Fifth Circuit: ""A subordinate state governmental body is not Ipso facto exempt from the operation of the antitrust laws. Rather, a district court 
must ask whether the state legislature contemplated a certain type of anticompetitive restraint.  In our opinion, though, it is not 
necessary to point to an express statutory mandate for each act which is alleged to violate the antitrust laws. It will suffice if the 
challenged activity was clearly within the legislative intent.  Thus, a trial judge may ascertain, from the authority given a 
governmental entity to operate in a particular area, that the legislature contemplated the kind of action complained of.  On the 
other hand, as in Goldfarb, the connection between a legislative grant of power and the subordinate entity's asserted use of that 
power may be too tenuous to permit the conclusion that the entity's intended scope of activity encompassed such conduct.  
HN16[
] Whether a governmental body's actions are comprehended within the powers granted to it by the legislature is, of 
course, a determination which can be made only under the specific facts in each case.  A district judge's inquiry on this point 
should be broad enough to include all evidence which might show the scope of legislative intent.  532 F.2d, at 434-435

the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it is such as may 
suppress or even destroy competition."" Board of Trade of the City of Chicago v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 238, 38 S. Ct. 242, 
244, 62 L. Ed. 683 (1918). Considerations such as the need of the smaller shippers for the supposed efficiencies accompanying 
collective rate formulation and the fact that current intrastate rates are materially lower than interstate rates in the subject states, "
260,," while perhaps quite meaningful from a policy standpoint, would have only limited significance to our inquiry.  The focus would 
continue to be on the effect of collective rate-making on price competition among intrastate carriers."

262,1," .  Actually, because the dealers sold their papers to carriers, who in turn sold to the public, the agreement established a ""resale-

262,2," .  The Court of Appeals also ordered ""a limited remand on the Section 2 count."" Knutson, supra, 548 F.2d at 800. However, it 
did not indicate which aspects of this Court's findings should be reconsidered.  Having fully weighed the evidence presented at 
trial, and having considered the legal analysis contained in the Court of Appeals' decision, this Court reaffirms its finding that 
there has been no Section 2 violation. "
263,," Plaintiffs' Section 2 claim was that ""sometime prior to 1970 defendants attempted and conspired to monopolize the publication of 
community or suburban daily newspapers in the southern Alameda County area in violation of ยง 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 
ยง 2,"" and that ""as an integral part of that attempt to monopolize defendants fixed resale prices, imposed territorial restraints on 
dealer distribution, and terminated all independent home-delivery dealers."" 383 F. Supp. at 1369, 1370-1371. An attempt and 
conspiracy to monopolize can only be established if plaintiffs have proven that defendants ""possessed ""a specific intent to 
acquire unlawful monopoly power.' "" Id. at 1371, Quoting Chisholm Brothers Farm Equipment Co. v. Int'l Harvester Co., 498 F.2d 
1137, 1144 (9 Cir. 1974). Because there was ""no indication in the evidence as a whole * * * of predatory or knowingly unlawful 
activity in connection with defendants' effort to establish, by contract, the subscription price of their newspapers,"" Id. at 1372, 
and because defendants in fact ""took prompt action to bring their distribution practices into compliance with the antitrust laws * * 
*,"" Ibid., this Court found that there was no specific intent to monopolize and denied plaintiffs relief on their Section 2 claim.  Id. 
at 1372, 1376. The Court of Appeals agreed with the standards used to determine whether there had been a Section 2 violation and disagreed 
only with the Court's determination that defendants had not knowingly engaged in any unlawful activity in setting a maximum 
resale price. 548 F.2d at 814. However, despite this disagreement, the Court of Appeals concluded that "" * * * the Section 1 violation alone, or in conjunction with (the publisher's) newspaper acquisitions, the questionable promotional 
practices, and the padding of circulation figures would have supported a district court finding of specific intent, but that finding 
was not compelled and We cannot say that the district court's contrary determination was clearly erroneous."" Id. at 815 
(emphasis added). Despite the Court of Appeals' assertion that defendants' conduct was ""knowingly unlawful,"" the evidence demonstrates that 
there was no specific intent to monopolize and this Court therefore reaffirms its earlier holding that ""plaintiffs have failed to prove 
that * * * defendants attempted or conspired to monopolize the publication of community daily newspapers in the southern 
Alameda County area."" 383 F. Supp. at 1376."
263,3," .  Defendant's violation need not be the sole cause of the injury; however, it must be at least a substantial factor in bringing the 
injury about.  See Mulvey v. Samuel Goldwyn Productions, 433 F.2d 1073, 1075 n.3 (9 Cir. 1970), Cert. denied, 402 U.S. 923,

264,4," .  There are two reasons why plaintiff's burden of proving the amount of damages is relaxed in an antitrust case: first, the ""self-
evident intangible nature of the subject matter""; and second, the recognition that most difficulties in computing antitrust damages 
arise as a result of defendant's own wrongful conduct.  See Flintkote Co. v. Lysfjord, 246 F.2d 368, 391 (9 Cir.) Cert. denied, 355 
U.S. 835, 78 S. Ct. 54, 2 L. Ed. 2d 46 (1977). Precise calculation of damages is often made impossible where defendant has 
restrained plaintiff in his profit-making activities, as this restraint obscures the conditions that would have prevailed in a free 
market.  Further, courts have recognized that to allow defendants to escape payment of damages because they have made it 
difficult for the plaintiff to prove the exact amount of injury would be to permit a wrongdoer to profit by his own wrongdoing.  Such 
defendants should not be permitted to argue that inexact and imprecise damages are improper.  If the courts were willing to 
accept such arguments, potential defendants would be encouraged to act in a manner that would render damages as uncertain 
and speculative as possible, and this would of course undercut the policies underlying the antitrust laws. See Bigelow v. RKO 
Radio Pictures, Inc., 327 U.S. 251, 264-265, 66 S. Ct. 574, 90 L. Ed. 652 (1946); Story Parchment Co. v. Paterson Parchment

264,5," .  There were two groups of independent newspaper distributors who brought this lawsuit, those who sold The Daily Review and 
those who sold the Argus.  On remand, this Court is only concerned with The Daily Review plaintiffs, Joseph W. Berthiaume, 
Robert A. Dutra, Kenneth W. Jackson, Willard B. Kittredge, Jean E. Nyland, and Evan F. Williams.  Gayle C. Ely, the seventh "
265,," Daily Review plaintiff, did not appeal from the adverse decision below.  The Court of Appeals has agreed that the Argus plaintiffs 
are not entitled to damages, stating that "" * * * the Argus plaintiffs * * * did not meet the-fact-of-damage Flintkote test.  * * * Unlike other plaintiffs, the Argus plaintiffs had 
a complete failure of proof of damages, not simply some deficiencies in the proof of amount of damages."" Knutson, supra, 548 
F.2d at 813."
265,6," .  Plaintiffs' proof of lost profits was based on a ""before/after"" theory under which the ""before"" period was the time during which 
plaintiffs were restrained from raising their prices and the ""after"" period was the time subsequent to September 1, 1973, when 
plaintiffs were free to charge whatever prices they wished.  All the Daily Review plaintiffs raised their subscription prices during 
the ""after"" period.  They all claim increased net profits resulting from this price hike, despite losses in circulation. See Knutson, 
supra, 548 F.2d at 810. As a result, they contend that the evidence proves that their profits would have been higher before 
September 1, 1973, had they been allowed to charge their subscribers the ""profit-maximizing"" price. After considering the testimony and demeanor of the Daily Review plaintiffs, this Court found that their post-September 1973 
actions were self-serving and that the evidence taken from the ""after"" period was unreliable: ""Since plaintiffs' crucial profit and loss data, * * * was recorded and compiled well after the complaint was filed in the very 
litigation in which it was to be used to prove actual injury, its credibility is certainly suspect.  Plaintiffs clearly had the opportunity 
to vary their gross income and expense figures during the ""after' period in order to exaggerate the favorable impact that price 
increases might have on profitability.  * * * Some of plaintiffs' profit data strains the Court's credulity to the breaking point.  * * * "" * * * Moreover, when assessing the credibility of these profit and loss statements the Court cannot ignore the fact that the 
unaudited financial statements originally offered by several of the plaintiffs purportedly reflecting their actual operations indicated 
significantly higher net profit figures than were reported on those plaintiffs' federal income tax returns for the years in question.  * 
* * ""Another and equally fundamental weakness in plaintiffs' proof of the fact of damage arises from the artificiality of the ""after' 
period upon which the claims of lost profits are based.  Plaintiffs conceded that ""damages must be predicated on real market 
conditions * * *.' (Footnote omitted.) Yet during the entire ""after' period one dominant market factor the wholesale price charged 
by the publisher and paid by the dealers has been under a court-imposed restraint that prevents defendants from raising that 
price."" Knutson, supra, 383 F. Supp. at 1382-1383. Moreover, as will be seen later in this opinion, the evidence demonstrates that plaintiffs would not have charged a higher price 
for their papers, even if it had been profitable to do so, because of their fear of publisher response.  Because of the need to 
maintain a uniform sales price and a high level of circulation, the publisher could not have permitted the dealers to raise their 
prices with the resulting drop in circulation without taking action to protect his interests. For these reasons, it appears to this Court that there remains a substantial question as to whether plaintiffs have produced 
evidence that they were in fact injured by defendants' maximum resale price restraint."
265,7," .  Because vertical resale price restraints have long been viewed as Per se violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, See 
Albrecht v. Herald Co., 390 U.S. 145, 151-152, 88 S. Ct. 869, 19 L. Ed. 2d 998, Rehearing denied, 390 U.S. 1018, 88 S. Ct. 
1258, 20 L. Ed. 2d 169 (1968); Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Seagram & Sons, 340 U.S. 211, 213, 71 S. Ct. 259, 95 L. Ed. 219, "
266,," Rehearing denied, 340 U.S. 939, 71 S. Ct. 487, 95 L. Ed. 678 (1951), courts have not found it necessary to evaluate the anti-
competitive consequences of each violation.  However, recent case law has called into question the continued application of Per 
se analysis to this type of case.  See Continental T. V. Inc., v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 57-59, 97 S. Ct. 2549, 53 L. Ed. 
2d 568 (vertical territorial restrictions should be subjected to rule of reason rather than Per se analysis); Eastern Scientific Co. v. 
Wild Heerbrugg Instruments, Inc., 572 F.2d 883, 885-886 (1 Cir. 1978), Cert. denied, 439 U.S. 833, 99 S. Ct. 112, 58 L. Ed. 2d 
128 (1978) (resale price restraint having lesser anti-competitive effect than pure territorial restriction analyzed under rule of 
reason in light of Continental ).  For this reason, it seems appropriate for the Court to consider whether the purposes of the 
antitrust laws are truly served by a finding that plaintiffs have proven a violation and the fact of injury.  See Brunswick, supra, 429 
U.S. at 487-488, 97 S. Ct. 690, 697 (respondents not allowed to recover under Clayton ยง 7 for lost profits suffered when large 
manufacturer acquired their competitors, thus preventing competitors from going out of business; Court held that because 
respondents sought to recover ""the profits they would have realized had competition been reduced,"" their ""injury was not of ""the 
type that the statute was intended to forestall,' "" and that it would be ""inimical to the purposes of (the antitrust) laws to award 
damages for the type of injury claimed * * * ""); Murphy Tugboat Co. v. Crowley, 454 F. Supp. 847, 851-852 (N.D.Cal.1978) 
(Brunswick reasoning applicable to Sherman ยง 1 claim). The anticompetitive consequences that usually flow from the imposition of maximum resale price restraints were articulated by 
the Supreme Court in Albrecht, supra : ""(First,) agreements to fix maximum prices ""no less than those to fix minimum prices, cripple the freedom of traders and thereby 
restrain their ability to sell in accordance with their own judgment.' (Footnote and citation omitted.) "" * * * (Second, maximum prices may be fixed too low for the dealer to furnish services * * * and conveniences which consumers 
desire and for which they are willing to pay.  (Third, maximum price fixing may channel distribution through a few large or 
specifically advantaged dealers who otherwise would be subject to significant non-price competition.  * * * (Fourth,) if the actual 
price charged under a maximum price scheme is nearly always the fixed maximum price, which is increasingly likely as the 
maximum price approaches the actual cost of the dealer, the scheme tends to acquire all the attributes of an arrangement fixing 
minimum prices."" 390 U.S. at 152-153, 88 S. Ct. at 873, Quoting Kiefer-Stewart, supra, 340 U.S. at 213, 71 S. Ct. 259. None of these ""evils"" are present in this case.  First, even if the restraint ""cripple(d) the freedom"" of plaintiffs, the Supreme Court 
has expressly rejected this factor as a basis for imposing antitrust liability.  See Continental T. V. Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 
supra, 433 U.S. at 53 n. 21, 97 S. Ct. 2549. Second, plaintiffs have not alleged that they would have provided additional services or conveniences to their subscribers if they 
had been allowed to charge a higher price.  The motivation for raising prices was to effect a decrease in circulation that, because 
of the dual rate structure, would lead to higher net profits.  Setting higher prices In order to increase services would appear to be 
counterproductive; it would retard the desired circulation drop. Third, there is no indication that the price restraint protected any dealer from ""significant non-price competition."" In fact, the 
dealers did not compete among themselves for subscribers and, if anything, the elimination of the price restraint would have 
made inter-dealer competition even less likely.  The dealers wanted to restrict distribution.  Because of the dual rate structure 
they had no interest in expanding their distribution into other dealers' territories.  See Knutson, supra, 548 F.2d at 809, 810. Fourth, it cannot be said that the price ceiling was actually a cover for a minimum price setting scheme.  The resale price was 
not set at the dealers' cost.  Had the dealers wanted to increase circulation, they could have afforded to undercut the suggested 
price.  The reason they chose not to sell at a lower price was simply because they had no need and no motivation to increase 
circulation once the base level of sales had been reached. In fact, it is not unreasonable to conclude that defendants' maximum resale price restraint had a pro-competitive effect and that 
price freedom would have had anticompetitive consequences.  By seeking the removal of the resale price restrictions, plaintiffs 
sought the power to increase profits by raising subscription prices in their areas of distribution.  However, because each plaintiff 
had a De facto monopoly in his or her area, these increased profits could only be characterized as monopoly rents.  The result of 
lifting the price ceiling would therefore be to encourage each dealer's fortification and exploitation of his or her particular 
monopoly.  Moreover, because the effect of a price hike would be to decrease circulation, a dealer's freedom to raise prices 
would logically lead to the elimination of any inter-dealer competition that may have existed on the fringes of each dealer's area 
of distribution. This analysis suggests that although plaintiffs' alleged losses may be of the type that the claimed violation would be likely to 
cause, they are not of the type that the antitrust laws were intended to prevent.  For this reason, the Court questions whether "
267,," plaintiffs should have been found to have demonstrated a violation and resulting fact of injury.  See Brown Shoe Co. v. United 
States, 370 U.S. 294, 320, 82 S. Ct. 1502, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1962) (antitrust laws were enacted for the protection of competition, 
not competitors); Cf.  Albrecht, supra, 390 U.S. at 156-159, 88 S. Ct. 869 (Harlan, J., dissenting)."
267,8," .  Noting that ""(t)he evidence * * * presented * * * amounted to no more than conjectural hindsight and even contained 
contradictory assertions of interested parties,"" 383 F. Supp. at 1379, that ""(t)he credibility of the evidence is further diminished by 
the fact that these claims (of damage) were first made during the trial and lack any corroborating circumstantial evidence,"" 383 
F. Supp. at 1380, that ""plaintiffs' crucial profit and loss data * * * recorded and compiled well after the complaint was filed * * * is 
certainly suspect * * * (and) strains the Court's credulity to the breaking point,"" 383 F. Supp. at 1382, and that ""the ""after' period 
upon which the claims of lost profits are based"" constitutes ""an artificial rather than a real market experience thereby destroying 
the probative value of the ""before/after' test relied upon by plaintiffs,"" 383 F. Supp. at 1383, the Court held "" * * * that plaintiffs have not shown that there is a reasonable probability that they actually would have increased their prices 
during the damage period if they had been permitted to do so or that they actually would have realized higher profits had they 
raised their prices.  Consequently, plaintiffs have failed to prove both the fact and amount of damage on their lost profits claim."" 
383 F. Supp. at 1384. "
268,9," .  As noted by the Court of Appeals, defendants could rebut the presumption that plaintiffs would have charged the profit-
maximizing price by introducing contrary evidence such as ""dealer testimony that he would not have raised his price, or (other testimony) that the dealers had reasons other than the 
restraint for selling below a profit-maximizing price."" 548 F.2d at 812. It is significant that these examples rebut the presumption that each dealer intended to charge the profit-maximizing price, not 
the presumption that the profit-maximizing price was higher than the fixed price. "
269,10," .  Under most circumstances, plaintiffs who fail to establish the amount of their injury are not entitled to any damage award.  
However, in this case, the Court of Appeals' determination that ""fact of injury"" has been established compels a finding that 
plaintiffs are entitled to at least nominal damages. "
271,11," .  This conclusion is supported by plaintiffs' ""Second Supplemental Damage Study,"" submitted after trial, in which their expert, 
Dr. David Bradwell, calculated damages based on the assumption that plaintiffs would not have raised their prices until July 1, 
1971.  See, e.g., Plaintiffs' Exhibits 1002B, 1005B, 1006B, and 1007B. "
272,12," .  Plaintiffs' own expert, Dr. David Bradwell, testified that if the dealers had been permitted to effect the proposed price hike, 
circulation levels would have dropped approximately 22%.  Transcript, Jan. 25, 1978, at 151."
272,13," .  Either of these options could have been pursued without violating the antitrust laws, particularly insofar as they would have 
been the result of a good-faith, valid business decision, having across-the-board effect, and authorized by the explicit terms of 
the termination clause of the Dealership Agreements.  See Knutson, supra, 548 F.2d at 804-807; 383 F. Supp. at 1358, 1359-
1367."
272,14," .  This conclusion is reinforced by Sparks' ""termination"" letter of July 25, 1973, in which he stated that the conversion of his 
distribution system was ""necessary to obtain closer supervision over our circulation, and in particular over efforts to increase 
such circulation. * * * Any loss in circulation to (our) competitors would adversely affect our advertising revenue."" Knutson, supra, 
383 F. Supp. at 1353-1354. "
273,15," .  If that were the case, the Court could award plaintiffs damages for the profits they lost between the date they would have 
responded to price freedom by raising prices and the date the publisher would have responded by converting his distribution 
system. Because of the time lag in dealer response mentioned earlier, however, and the publisher's need to act quickly, this 
damage period would have been very short indeed."
273,16," .  ""Q. Did you happen to discuss with any of the plaintiffs the emphasis that the circulation department placed upon 
maintenance and growth of circulation and volume at the Hayward Daily Review?"" ""A. Yes, there was some discussions (Sic ) of the promotional activities of the circulation department. ""Q. Well, and the emphasis upon the part of the circulation management that the dealers' primary function was to develop 
circulation? ""A. Yes. ""Q. And the dealers recognized that, the extreme importance of that fact to circulation management? ""A. Oh, no question."" Transcript, Jan. 25, 1978, at 148-149. ""Q. Of course you recognize there are substantial differences in the factors which a publisher considered from those which a 
dealer considered, do you not? ""A. Yes. ""Q. Do you assume that the dealer is equally (concerned) about the impact of his actions upon the newspaper firm? ""A. In a different way, yes. ""Q. In which way, Doctor Bradwell? ""A. Well, if he were to act in such a predatory way that he destroyed his source of supply, he would be out of business."" Transcript, Jan. 25, 1978, at 153, 155. "
274,17," .  Although the record has not been fully developed, evidence of the Sacramento Union dealers' experience seems to support 
this conclusion.  The Sacramento Union Dealership Agreements did not set any maximum resale prices; those dealers were free 
to charge whatever price they wished.  See Transcript, Vol. 16, Apr. 16, 1974, at 74-75; Transcript, Vol. 16, Apr. 17, 1974, at 
168, 232.  However, none of them actually sold their papers at other than the publisher's suggested price.  See Transcript, Jan. 
25, 1978, at 134.  This lends support to the Court's conclusion that because of the need for uniformity of prices and the need to 
maintain circulation at a level that would support advertising revenues, a newsdealer would not vary from his publisher's 
suggested resale price even if he or she were free to do so. "

subsequently complied with the applicable service requirements."

sold in competition with defendant(s)."" "
280,4," .  HN4[
] The term ""commerce"" is defined in Section 1 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. ยง 12) as follows: ""Commerce,' as used herein, means trade or commerce among the several States and with foreign nations, or between the 
District of Columbia or any Territory of the United States and any State, Territory, or foreign nation, or between any insular 
possessions or other places under the jurisdiction of the United States, or between any such possession or place and any State 
or Territory of the United States or the District of Columbia or any foreign nation, or within the District of Columbia or any 
Territory or any insular possession or other place under the jurisdiction of the United States: Provided, That nothing in this Act 
contained shall apply to the Philippine Islands."
280,5," .  Without referring to any applicable case law, defendants also contend that the ""engaged in commerce"" language requires an 
allegation that they purchased the commodity in question from a supplier in the United States. In analyzing commerce questions 
under the Robinson-Patman Act, courts have exclusively focused on the ""in the course of commerce"" language. Since 
defendants' reasoning on this issue simply reformulates their other commerce arguments, the Court rejects this contention 
without further consideration. "
281,6," .  In Gulf Oil, the Court rejected the claims that allegations that certain activities had a ""close nexus"" to interstate commerce or 
""affected"" interstate commerce would suffice to meet the jurisdictional requirements of Section 2(a) of the Robinson-Patman Act."
281,7," .  The Court also notes a potential alternative basis for this decision. Defendants claim that the commerce language of Section 
2(f) requires that the wrongdoing buyer receive the discriminatory price concession in the course of its commerce. The Court 
acknowledges that a plain reading of the section supports this argument. On the basis of the Supreme Court's mandate in Gulf 
Oil to construe strictly the commerce requirements of the Robinson-Patman Act, one circuit court has specifically accepted this 
interpretation.  Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. F. T. C., 557 F.2d 971, 979 (2d Cir. 1977), Aff'd on other grounds, 440 U.S. 
69, 99 S. Ct. 925, 59 L. Ed. 2d 153 (1979). Limiting buyer liability to those situations in which the buyer has received the discriminatory price concession in the course of its 
commerce creates an anomaly between buyer and seller liability. See generally, Von Kalinowski, Antitrust Laws and Trade 
Regulation 16D, ยง 36.04 (1976). Section 2(a) covering seller liability requires only that one of the two sales giving rise to the 
discrimination the higher or the lower be in interstate commerce. See e.g., Moore v. Mead's Fine Bread Co., 348 U.S. 115, 118, 
75 S. Ct. 148, 99 L. Ed. 145 (1954); Foremost Dairies, Inc. v. F. T. C., 348 F.2d 674, 677 n.5 (5th Cir. 1965). Thus in a case in 
which a seller conveys to a favored buyer in a transaction that is wholly intrastate and sells to the disfavored buyer interstate, the 
buyer could escape liability on jurisdictional grounds whereas the seller in the same transaction would be liable on account of 
having made one of the two sales interstate. (This situation could arise in the case at hand if the Court determined that 
defendants substantially altered the steel in Japan.) This anomaly may be inconsistent with the purposes of Section 2(f). The Supreme Court has recently noted the ""derivative 
nature of liability under ยง 2(f)"" stating that ""buyer liability under ยง 2(f) is dependent on seller liability under ยง 2(a)."" Great Atlantic 
& Pacific Tea Co. v. F. T. C., 440 U.S. 69, 99 S. Ct. at 928, 931 (1979). The brief legislative history of this section indicates that 
its authors intended to make coextensive buyer and seller liability under the Act. 80 Cong. Rec. 9419 (1936) (remarks of Rep. 
Utterback). Several commentators have stated that they can conceive of no logical reason why Congress would have 
intentionally created this exception for favored buyers who purchase intrastate from discriminatory sellers. See Von Kalinowski, 
Antitrust Laws and Trade Regulation 16D, at ยง 36.04 (1976) and the authority cited therein. Thus, in order to give effect to the 
Congressional intent, it might be necessary to read liberally the commerce language of Section 2(f) and hold that that language 
imposes no additional requirements than those found in Section 2(a). "
284,8," .  See also, Moore v. Mead's Fine Bread Co., 348 U.S. 115, 75 S. Ct. 148, 99 L. Ed. 145 (1954), in which the Court held that a 
plaintiff who maintained an Intrastate business could bring a price discrimination action against a competitor who maintained 
prices in interstate transactions but cut prices in intrastate transactions, thereby driving plaintiff out of business. Despite the local 
nature of the commerce involved, the Court noted that the requisite injury under the Act had occurred competitive injury at the 
primary level and defendant's connections with interstate commerce sufficed to meet Section 2(a)' ยง jurisdictional requirements."
284,9," .  HN12[
] The competitive injury requirement of Section 2(a) arises out of the following language of that section: It shall be unlawful . . . where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a 
monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any person who either grants or knowingly 
receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them . . . "

would still recover automatically the full amount of the overcharge that the indirect purchaser had shown to be passed-on;

might be permitted is where the direct purchaser is owned or controlled by its customer."" Id. at 736 n.16, 97 S. Ct. at 2070. We 
relied on this remark to fashion an exception to the Illinois Brick rule in In re Sugar Industry Antitrust Litigation (Stotter & 
Co., Inc. v. Amstar Corp.), 579 F.2d 13 (3d Cir. 1978), where although the plaintiff purchased directly from a division (as well 
as from a subsidiary) of two of the alleged offenders, it did not buy the price-fixed product itself but rather, a product that 
incorporated the price-fixed product as one of its ingredients.  See discussion in Part III.C. Infra."
295,9," 431 U.S. at 736, 97 S. Ct. at 2070. Under a cost-plus contract a product is sold at a specified markup above the seller's own 
cost.  The supermarket plaintiffs submit that this exception should be interpreted expansively so as to permit recovery even if the 
pre-existing cost-plus contract does not fix the quantity of goods to be purchased.  Under such circumstances, plaintiffs point 
out, it is always true that the illegal profit earned by defendants is traceable in its entirety to the indirect purchaser. Also, plaintiffs 
suggest, the exception should be stretched to include informal arrangements and patterns of cost-plus pricing. Nevertheless, we 
are bound by the clear dictate of Illinois Brick and may not extend the exception beyond the limited circumstances recognized by 
the Supreme Court.  The Court explicitly rejected any exception for ""cost-based rules of thumb"" and other informal 
arrangements.  See id. at 743-44, 97 S. Ct. 2061. Furthermore, the Court has deemed it to be legally significant that when a 
cost-plus contract does not specify a fixed quantity of goods, the direct purchaser may suffer a loss in sales to its customers and 
seek damages for its losses, thereby complicating the allocation of the recovery.  See id. at 736, 97 S. Ct. 2061. But rather than 
instruct that whenever a direct purchaser sells under a variable quantity cost-plus contract, the indirect purchaser to whom the 
entire burden of the overcharge is traceable may sue for treble damages in the full amount while the direct purchaser may sue 
separately for additional damages attributable to lost sales, the Supreme Court evidently has concluded that even in such 
circumstances, the entire overcharge, multiplied threefold, is to be awarded to the direct purchaser. The Court's approach is 
understandable in that it avoids the complexities that would inevitably result from an alternative rule, such as that urged by the 
supermarket plaintiffs, since under an alternative rule, inquiry would have to be made into each sale consummated by the direct 
purchaser to ascertain the terms under which it was made and determine accordingly who may sue for recovery.  Even more 
important, by adopting a general rule with a very circumscribed exception the Court has ensured that under all circumstances 
there will be an incentive for direct purchasers to sue, a factor that, in the Court's view, is necessary to promote effective 
enforcement of the antitrust laws, See e. g., id. at 734-35, 97 S. Ct. 2061. See Schaefer, Passing-On Theory in Antitrust Treble

298,24," Apparently Murray believes that Illinois Brick would preclude indirect purchasers from competitors of the defendants from 
suing.  Although this is a possibility, it is by no means a foregone conclusion.  The Hanover Shoe-Illinois Brick rule is predicated 
in part on the perceived need to concentrate the recovery in direct purchasers from the defendants so that there be one group 
with an incentive to sue and enforce the antitrust laws. See text at note 4 Supra.  If ever confronted with the issue, the Supreme 
Court may well conclude that there is no reason to give an added incentive to sue to direct purchasers from competitors of the 
defendants, and consequently no reason to deviate from the general rule that a plaintiff may recover only for harm sustained by 
it.  See also note 46 Infra."
298,25," Murray's argument is premised upon the uncontroverted averment in the deposition of one of its officers that ""it's possible"" 
that one of its suppliers of consumer bags also manufactures the bags. See app. 231a.  It may well be that this would be proven 
false after further discovery, and that consequently Murray is in fact not a direct purchaser from a competitor of the defendants.  
But defendants, upon whom the burden rests to show that no dispute exists as to a material fact, have not met their burden in 
this regard, and we therefore must accept the uncontroverted statement of Murray's officer as true for purposes of reviewing the 
district court's grant of summary judgment. See Smith v. Pittsburgh Gage and Supply Co., 464 F.2d 870, 874 (3d Cir. 1972)."

criticized.  Thus, for example, Professors Areeda and Turner have observed: There is something to be said for excusing the defendant from damage liability for injuries that he neither intended nor could 
reasonably foresee.  The law of torts often grants that excuse, and punitive treble damages create even more reason to do so.

] In order to recover treble damages, Murray must prove actual causation that it has been harmed by the defendants'

] Admittedly, at least in an oligopolistic market, a price-fixing arrangement creates an umbrella under which a 
competitor may safely raise its prices without fear of a corresponding decrease in demand for its product.  But in order to prevail, 
a purchaser from a competitor must prove more than the creation of an umbrella; it must also establish the more difficult 
proposition that its supplier would have sold to it at a lower price had the conspiracy not existed.  On oligopolistic market 
structures, See generally L. Sullivan, Antitrust ยงยง 61, 115-17 (1977) and authorities cited therein; 2 P. Areeda & D. F. Turner, 
Supra, note 27 at P 404; Posner, Oligopoly and the Antitrust Laws: A Suggested Approach, 21 Stan.L.Rev. 1562, 1571 (1969);

302,46," In addition, if a court were unwilling to extend the Hanover Shoe-Illinois Brick rule to the context of a suit by purchasers from 
competitors, See note 24 Supra, the complexities would be greatly multiplied, as plaintiffs would also be required to establish 
what portion of the alleged overcharge was absorbed by them."
302,47," A different problem is presented where prices are fixed below the competitive market price or where defendants engage in 
other forms of anticompetitive conduct, such as group boycotts, vertical restrictions, or monopolization, since defendants' 
benefits in those instances are not so readily ascertainable, and may not be sufficient to compensate ""those individuals whose 
protection is the primary purpose of the antitrust laws."" In such circumstances courts have awarded damages based upon the 
amount of injury suffered by the plaintiff rather than the benefits derived by the defendants.  See, e. g., Pitchford v. Pepi, supra, 
531 F.2d at 107-09."
302,48," See 431 U.S. at 745-46, 97 S. Ct. 2061. The Supreme Court noted that ""direct purchasers sometimes may refrain from 
bringing a treble-damage suit for fear of disrupting relations with their suppliers,"" Id. at 746, 97 S. Ct. at 2075, but concluded that 
on balance this risk of non-enforcement does not warrant it to reconsider its conclusion that indirect purchasers are to be barred 
from suing.  Given the fact that the Supreme Court evidently reached its decision without considering the possibility that 
purchasers from competitors could fill this gap in enforcement, we see no reason to expand upon the Supreme Court's "
303,," assessment of the issue by suggesting, as does the dissent, that granting standing to purchasers from competitors ""is one way 
of preventing that risk of non-enforcement from becoming a reality."" Infra at p. 596.  For, as we now know, on the basis of 
studies conducted in the wake of Illinois Brick, this fear of non-enforcement is not supported by the evidence; direct purchasers 
do indeed sue their suppliers under the antitrust laws and are ""the backbone of private antitrust enforcement."" See Handler, 
Antitrust 1978, 78 Colum.L.Rev. 1363, 1425-26 (1978). And although we agree with the dissent that enforcement efforts might 
be enhanced by granting purchasers from competitors standing to sue, as indeed would be the result whenever any plaintiff is 
granted standing to sue, we conclude that this benefit is outweighed by the countervailing factors discussed in the text."
303,49," We recognize that on rare occasions it may be unnecessary to engage in such economic analyses because the particular 
competitor of the defendants that supplied the plaintiff would be able and willing to testify that it raised its prices by a specific 
amount as a result of the wrongdoers' pricing decisions.  Nevertheless, inasmuch as we are fashioning a rule of standing, we 
must consider the general situation and not the unusual exception.  To do otherwise would be to make determinations regarding 
standing to sue contingent upon what evidence a plaintiff has mustered at the time the court rules on the standing issue.  In 
addition, given the other factors discussed in the text, we cannot say that were these problems of proof not present, a purchaser 
from a competitor would have standing to sue for treble damages. The dissent apparently concedes that complex economic analyses usually would be required in treble damage suits brought by 
purchasers from competitors of the defendants, but maintains that there is little reason to believe that proof of damages would 
be significantly more complex or speculative than in actions by direct purchasers. Both with respect to the defendants and with 
respect to their competitors, the dissent points out, the price actually charged is known or easily ascertainable, and the only 
difficulty is in determining the price that would have been charged had the anticompetitive conduct not occurred.  Infra at p. 599.  
What the dissent seems to overlook, however, is the purpose for which the admittedly speculative economic data is to be used in 
each situation.  The direct purchasers have clearly been harmed by the price-fixing conspiracy in that they have absorbed at 
least a portion of the illegal overcharge, and would introduce the economic data merely to establish the amount of the illegal 
overcharge. As we know, an antitrust plaintiff is not held to the same standard of proof as are plaintiffs in other types of actions, 
and the factfinder is allowed to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of damages suffered.  See note 43 Supra.  In 
contrast, a purchaser from a competitor, in addition to proving the amount of damages suffered, ordinarily must also establish 
the very fact that it was injured, which fact it must prove with ""reasonable certainty."" See id.  It therefore appears that a different 
sort of economic analysis is called for in each situation: whereas to establish the amount of damages, the factfinder simply has 
to settle on some approximation of the price that would have been charged by the defendants and their competitors in a 
competitive market, to establish the fact of injury, or causation, the factfinder must ascribe specific reasons to a competitor's 
pricing decisions and determine that such decisions would not have been made had one of a number of variables been slightly 
different.  As discussed in the text accompanying notes 44-45 Supra, this task is difficult to perform, and indeed may be 
impossible."
303,50," Only under an economist's hypothetical model either of perfect elasticity of demand or of a direct purchaser that does not wish 
to maximize profits would no portion of the overcharge be absorbed by the indirect purchasers. See Schaefer, Supra note 9, at 
887-97, 901-06."
303,51," The dissent attempts to minimize the potentially ruinous effect of such open-ended liability by suggesting that Only businesses with a substantial share of a market are likely, by fixing prices, to significantly affect the prices charged by 
competing businesses.  Thus, it can reasonably be assumed that there will only be large recoveries against large companies or "
304,," a large group of smaller companies who are best able to withstand such losses.  . . .  Thus, the operation of the market would 
tend to prevent recoveries in suits such as this from being of a ruinous or anticompetitive dimension. Infra at p. 598.  We are not persuaded by this statement.  Although we agree with the premise that ""only businesses with a 
substantial share of a market are likely, by fixing prices, to significantly affect the prices charged by competing businesses,"" See 
generally, L. Sullivan, Antitrust ยงยง 61, 115-17 (1977) we do not believe that the conclusion that large recoveries will be borne by 
those companies ""who are best able to withstand such losses"" follows from it.  Noncompetitive pricing patterns can prevail under 
a variety of market conditions, See generally, Hay & Kelley, An Empirical Survey of Price Fixing Conspiracies, 17 J. Law & Econ. 
12 (1974), and a firm may become an industry price leader with a remarkable small ""substantial"" share of the market, simply 
because it has a larger share than any other company and is perceived for one reason or another to be the industry pace-setter.  
Given this fact, merely because a company has become an industry price leader, whether advertently or inadvertently, it does 
not mean that it can withstand the burdens of a treble damage recovery that is based upon profits obtained by the rest of the 
industry."

chemicals, and agricultural products.  Consumer bags also include air sickness bags. In response to the defendant's request in the criminal suit for a more specific definition of the term ""consumer bags,"" the 
government filed a ""Voluntary Bill of Particulars"" that relied upon the defendants' price lists to identify the bags. None of the price 
lists mention the packaging of automobile or machine parts as one of the uses for the product being offered for sale."
305,57," The order treats Mid-West's claim together with the claims of the supermarket plaintiffs that are grouped in the first category, 
which clearly were dismissed on the legal ground that such plaintiffs were indirect purchasers. In contrast, in dismissing the 
claim of another plaintiff, Sambo's Restaurants, Inc., the next paragraph of the order states that the dismissal is based ""on the 
ground that the paper bag (Sambo's) purchases is not a ""consumer bag.' """
305,58," We note in this regard that paragraph 6 of the indictment did not purport to give an exhaustive list of uses for consumer bags, 
which are described in paragraph 5 in the following manner: Consumer bags, also known in the trade as ""small bags,"" are made from one or more plies of paper and may be combined with 
other materials used as linings and/or coatings.  Consumer bags are preformed by the manufacturer in many styles and sizes 
according to customer specifications.  Most consumer bags have printed exterior designs as specified by the customer. 
Consumer bags are designed for capacities of less than twenty-five pounds.  They are normally used to pre-package products 
which are then marketed in such bags."

307,63," Apparently, both the defendants and Mid-West are of the belief that Mid-West's entitlement to injunctive relief is completely 
dependent upon whether Mid-West may sue for treble damages. That assumption overlooks the possibility that Mid-West may 
be found to have purchased consumer bags but that it may not sue defendants for treble damages because Continental Group 
is not legally accountable for its subsidiary's sales.  In that event the issue would arise whether Mid-West, as a direct purchaser 
of consumer bags from competitors of the defendants, has standing to sue for injunctive relief. Inasmuch as neither side briefed 
that issue and since it is presently premature for decision, we merely note its existence.  A parallel issue exists with respect to 
Murray, but we need not decide it either, since we conclude that Murray has standing to sue for injunctive relief in its capacity as

309,76," The question whether the damage sustained by indirect purchasers has been proximately caused by the antitrust violators for 
purposes of standing to sue for treble damages has, of course, been mooted by Illinois Brick's holding that as a matter of law 
indirect purchasers may not sue for treble damages. Prior to Illinois Brick there existed a split among the various courts of 
appeals on this issue.  Compare, e. g., Donson Stores, Inc. v. American Bakeries Co., 58 F.R.D. 481, 483-85 (S.D.N.Y.1973)

310,81," As mentioned earlier, only in a hypothetical economic model would no portion of the illegal overcharge be absorbed by the 
indirect purchaser, and then only if the indirect purchaser's demand for the product was perfectly elastic or if the middleman did 
not wish to maximize its profits and therefore absorbed the entire overcharge on its own.  See note 50 Supra."
310,82," In this critical respect, the indirect purchaser is to be distinguished from those parties that have been denied standing to sue 
for injunctive relief by other courts.  E. g., Jeffrey v. Southwestern Bell, supra; (residential telephone subscribers have no 
standing to seek to enjoin higher rates allegedly sought from, and approved by, public utility commission to recoup losses from 
illegal predatory pricing of telephone equipment); Nassau County Ass'n of Insurance Agents, Inc. v. Aetna Life & Casualty Co., 
497 F.2d 1151 (2d Cir.), Cert. denied, 419 U.S. 968, 95 S. Ct. 232, 42 L. Ed. 2d 184 (1974) (unincorporated insurance 
associations have no standing under ยง 16 to prevent insurance companies from terminating contracts of insurance agents that 
are members of plaintiff associations, where only loss alleged is decrease in membership and dues); Conference of Studio 
Unions v. Loew's Inc., supra ; (unions, association of unions, and individual members may not sue major motion picture 
companies for allegedly destroying independent companies and thereby causing loss of wages to members, dues to association, 
and expenditures by unions to secure new employment for members).  The district court in Parkview Markets, Inc. v. Kroger Co., 
 -- - F. Supp.  -- , 1978 CCH Trade Cases P 62,373 (S.D.Ohio 1978) relied on these factually dissimilar cases to deny standing 
under ยง 16 to an indirect purchaser."
310,83," True, as the defendants' argument suggests, once the antitrust violation is being actively contested by other parties, the 
interest of the judicial system in economizing its own efforts comes into play.  Similarly, if a defendant is already enjoined from 
engaging in the illegal activities, it would be wasteful to require it to defend another suit seeking to enjoin the same activities 
once again, particularly since attorneys fees may now be awarded to successful plaintiffs under ยง 16.  See 15 U.S.C.A. ยง 26 
(1978 Supp.).  In our view, however, these considerations do not bear upon the problem of determining proximate causation for 
purposes of ยง 16.  The ""private and public actions were designed to be cumulative, not mutually exclusive.  . . .  They may 
proceed simultaneously or in disregard of each other."" United States v. Borden, supra, 347 U.S. at 518-19, 74 S. Ct. at 706. And 
it would be odd if Congress' recent authorization of attorneys fees under ยง 16, which was intended to enhance the effectiveness 
of private injunctive suits, See H.Rep.No.94-499, 94th Cong. 2d Sess. 18-20 (1975), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1976, p. "
311,2572," , resulted in a circumscription of the parties eligible to sue.  Instead, it would appear that these concerns are properly to be 
considered by the court when it exercises its equity powers to decide whether an injunction is appropriate under the 
circumstances."
311,84," 84.  Zenith Radio Corp., supra, 395 U.S. at 131, 89 S. Ct. 1562."
311,85," We disagree with the defendants' argument that a remand is unnecessary because, they claim, it is evident that the plaintiffs 
are not entitled to injunctive relief. First, contrary to defendants' assertions that plaintiffs must prove irreparable injury, the proper 
standard is that articulated in Zenith Radio Corp., supra.  Second, we do not regard the plaintiffs to be necessarily foreclosed 
from injunctive relief by the mere pendency of the government and direct purchaser suits for similar remedies.  Generally, ""they 
may proceed simultaneously or in disregard of each other,"" United States v. Borden Co., supra, 347 U.S. at 519, 74 S. Ct. at 
706, and should be permitted to do so if, considering all the circumstances (including the present status of the government and 
direct purchaser suits), the plaintiffs are still able to establish a ""significant threat of injury"" under general equity principles.  In 
this regard we note, however, that the district court may wish to consider whether any meaningful difference exists in the present 
case ""with respect to the parties capable of enforcing"" the injunction, or whether the reality here is that ""one injunction is as 
effective as 100, and concomitantly, that 100 injunctions are no more effective than one.  . . ."" See Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., 
supra, 405 U.S. at 261, 92 S. Ct. 885, 891. Also, in view of the fact that the natural litmus test for determining whether a party is 
sufficiently injured to obtain injunctive relief whether it was willing to bear the burden of litigation has been swept away by the 
recent congressional award of attorneys fees under ยง 16, and in view of the consequent potential for unnecessary litigation costs 
to defendants, the district court may wish to consider the feasibility of consolidating the various suits for injunctive relief. "

312,3," I take mild exception to the majority's description of how antitrust violators are to be deterred: ""by depriving them threefold of 
the ""fruits of their illegality.' "" Supra, at p. 583.  As will be discussed later, not all antitrust remedies are based on a calculation of 
the defendant's ill-gotten profits. "
313,4," As the majority recognizes, Illinois Brick was not, itself, a standing case.  I agree with the majority, however, that the reasoning 
utilized in that opinion has implications for standing analysis."
313,5," The Court, in Illinois Brick, stated: (W)e understand Hanover Shoe as resting on the judgment that the antitrust laws will be more effectively enforced by 
concentrating the full recovery for the overcharge in the direct purchasers than by allowing every plaintiff potentially affected by 
the overcharge to sue only for the amount it could show was absorbed by it."
313,431," U.S. at 734-35, 97 S. Ct. at 2069."
313,6," I believe the majority is seriously mistaken when it states: Illinois Brick represents in effect the proposition that when defendants have fixed prices above the competitive market price, 
where the benefit derived by them is readily ascertainable, the objectives of the treble damage action are fulfilled when the 
defendants are required to pay the direct purchasers three times the overcharge. Supra, at p. 585 (footnote omitted).  Neither the language nor logic of Illinois Brick justifies the conclusion that Only direct 
purchasers from price-fixers can ever recover when prices are fixed at above the market rate.  Rather the conclusion is that, 
among direct and indirect purchasers from the defendant price-fixers, only the direct purchasers can recover and they can 
recover the entire amount of damages sustained by that whole chain.  This limitation is designed to enhance enforcement of the 
antitrust laws. See n. 5, Supra.  As is discussed in the text accompanying this note, denying standing here would not further that 
end."

313,9," See Bogus v. American Speech & Hearing Association, 582 F.2d 277 at 284 (3d Cir. 1978) (""The doctrine of standing as 
applied to antitrust cases limits the apparent breadth of this provision by elaborating a concept of proximate causation between 
defendant's unlawful act and plaintiff's out-of-pocket losses.""); Bogosian v. Gulf Oil Corp., 561 F.2d at 447 n. 6. "
314,10," See generally, Prosser, Law of Torts (4th ed.) ยง 43.  The majority criticizes ""the injection of a foreseeability concept"" into the 
determination of standing, at least with respect to the ""target area"" test.  Supra, at p. 581 n. 27.  I believe, however, that 
foreseeability is one of the relevant factors that must be considered as long as directness of injury is one of the criteria of 
standing.  Although the majority cites Handler, supra note 2, as criticizing foreseeability analysis in the context of the ""target 
area"" test, that article concludes by listing the ""reasonable foreseeability of injury"" as a ""significant element"" in determining 
whether a plaintiff has standing to sue.  Handler at 30.  I believe it is a wise inclusion."
314,11," One formulation of the target area test requires that the plaintiff not only be in the area, but that he be aimed at.  See, e. g., 
Calderone Enterprises Corp. v. United Artists Theatre Circuit, 454 F.2d 1292, 1296 (2d Cir. 1971), Cert. denied, 406 U.S. 930, 
92 S. Ct. 1776, 32 L. Ed. 2d 132 (1972). Plaintiffs admittedly would not have standing under such an analysis.  This test, 
however, has not been adopted by this court, is unduly restrictive and inadequately serves the purposes of compensation and 
deterrence."
314,12," See Handler, supra note 2 at 30."
314,13," Although the majority expresses some doubt, I believe it is clear that the logic of Illinois Brick requires that any recovery by 
those in the chain of distribution beginning with defendants' competitors be concentrated in the hands of those that purchase 
directly from the competitors. "
315,14," Creditors, shareholders and officers of corporations injured by antitrust violations have frequently been denied standing 
because their claims are derivative.  See, e. g., Pitchford v. Pepi, 531 F.2d 92 (3d Cir.), Cert. denied, 426 U.S. 935, 96 S. Ct. 
2649, 49 L. Ed. 2d 387 (1976). See also Von Kalinowski, 11 Antitrust Laws and Trade Regulation, ยง 81.02(2) and cases cited 
therein.  Lessors have also been denied standing on this basis.  See e. g., Melrose Realty Co. v. Loew's, Inc., 234 F.2d 518 
(3d Cir.), Cert. denied, 352 U.S. 890, 77 S. Ct. 128, 1 L. Ed. 2d 85 (1956) (per curiam)."
315,15," For example, in Pitchford v. Pepi, supra, this court approved measures of damages from illegal territorial restrictions and the 
termination of a dealership which looked to the amounts lost by the plaintiff without regard to whether there was a corresponding 
profit to the defendant.  The Supreme Court has recognized that ""the treble damage provision (of Section 4 of the Clayton Act) 
which makes awards available only to injured parties, and measures the awards by a multiple of the injury actually proved, is 
designed primarily as a remedy."" Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. at 485-86, 97 S. Ct. at 696. "
316,16," The majority, on four occasions, refers to those "" ""whose protection is the fundamental purpose of the antitrust laws.' "" I do not 
believe that the invocation of this phrase advances our analysis here.  To the extent that the majority intends this phrase to do 
more than identify those who are properly allowed standing after consideration of the criteria referred to throughout this opinion, I 
believe it is pursuing a most misguided course.  If Congress' purpose was to protect certain individuals through the treble 
damage remedy, it is irrelevant that the protection of such individuals was not the ""fundamental"" purpose of the antitrust laws. 
Thus we are left with the problem of defining exactly who Congress intended to be able to sue under Section 4.  I have already 
discussed the factors to be considered in making such determinations.  The ambiguity of the term ""fundamental purpose"" makes 
it ill-suited for service as an additional factor to be analyzed in resolving antitrust standing issues or as a substitute for the factors 
already discussed.  I fear that overemphasizing this term may lead to a narrowing of antitrust standing unsupported by law or 
logic. "

that a per se violation results when a manufacturer sells products to his distributor subject to territorial restrictions on resale.  
Although the court left unanswered the possibility that some vertical restrictions might justify per se prohibition, it concluded that 
a return to the ""rule of reason"" which governed vertical restrictions prior to Schwinn was warranted.  Continental T.V., Inc. v. 
GTE Sylvania, Inc., supra, 58-59. The court noted that ""departure from the rule-of-reason standard must be based upon

335,5," One commentator has suggested that a different approach may be appropriate in considering foreign statutes. ""Prevention of fraudulent acquisition of patent rights may be more important under United States law than under foreign law, 
because once the right is established we generally do not police profits, and we generally do not require licensing . . . .  Since we 
do neither of those things, and thus essentially allow a monopoly return to the inventor of a product of commercial significance, it 
becomes very important to determine whether the patent was valid in the first place.  Because of this, we have additional 
engraftings on the element of validity.  One enlargement . . .  is the doctrine that fraudulently obtaining a patent is an antitrust

337,7," [***329]   We note the suggestion in the concurring opinion that problems regarding the formulation of relief can be dealt with 
at a subsequent stage of the litigation.  That may be possible in some cases.  Once the trial court has had an opportunity to 
evaluate the effects of possibly countervailing interests and policies based on a record presented with a view toward addressing 
these issues, it may well determine that exercise of jurisdiction is appropriate and that a remedy tailored to meet incidental 
enforcement problems can be designed.  But in our view, the record on this 12(b)(6) dismissal is inadequate to allow a reasoned 
decision on that issue as well as the others we have enumerated. "
339,1," See, e. g., Mortensen v. First Federal Savings and Loan Association, 549 F.2d 884, 890-98 (3d Cir. 1977) (dismissal of suit 
charging violation ยง 1 of the Sherman Act for want of subject-matter jurisdiction was held to be premature because same facts 
are relevant for ascertaining jurisdiction as well as the substantive offense).  See also Ongman, ""Be No Longer a Chaos"":

340,4," Id.  Concededly, it may be that unlike fraudulently procured American patents, a number of foreign patents will remain valid 
under foreign law notwithstanding their fraudulent procurement. But that does not appear relevant to the question whether the 
holder of such a foreign patent has monopolized trade in violation of the Sherman Act. However, as discussed in the text Infra, 
the continued validity of a foreign patent may have some bearing on the formulation of an antitrust remedy. The majority opinion appears to sidestep the question whether Walker Process applies to the fraudulent procurement of a 
foreign patent, but cites one commentator who suggests that Walker Process should be limited to situations involving United 
States patents. Supra at pp. 1295-1296 & n. 5.  The reason advanced for such a limitation is that American patents are unique in 
that it is very important to determine at the outset whether an American patent is valid, because we do not police profits or 
require licensing, thereby making it necessary to have ""additional engraftings on the elements of validity,"" including ""the doctrine 
that fraudulently obtaining a patent is an antitrust violation."" Such an ""engrafting"" is unnecessary, it is asserted, with respect to 
foreign patents. It would seem, however, that this argument is flawed in that it subordinates the Sherman Act to patent law 
policies; it implies that Walker Process was a special enlargement of the antitrust laws designed to deal with the problem of 
identifying invalid patents, instead of recognizing that Walker Process merely removed the limited patent exception to the 
antitrust laws in those circumstances where a patent has been obtained by deliberate fraud. "

the existence of jurisdiction is to be determined solely under an ""effects"" standard, but that a court may then decline to exercise 
jurisdiction because of considerations of international comity. As I understand it, however, a court may not abstain where 
jurisdiction properly lies unless abstention is warranted under a recognized abstention doctrine.  See, e. g., McClellan v. 
Carland, 217 U.S. 268, 281, 30 S. Ct. 501, 54 L. Ed. 762 (1910); Cohens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 264, 404, 5 L. Ed. 257 
(1821) (""It is most true, that this court will not take jurisdiction if it should not: but it is equally true that it must take jurisdiction, if it 
should.  . . .  We have no more right to decline the exercise of jurisdiction which is given, than to usurp that which is not given."") 
See generally P. Bator, P. Mishkin, D. Shapiro & H. Wechsler, Hart and Wechsler's The Federal Courts and the Federal System, 
1258-59 (2d ed. 1973).  And to my knowledge no abstention doctrine exists with respect to considerations of international 
comity. Rather, as Timberlane and Pacific Seafarers demonstrate, such considerations have been incorporated into an 
expanded jurisdictional test. "
342,10," In this respect, this case presents a less problematical situation for application of the Sherman Act than was presented in 
Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U.S. 100, 89 S. Ct. 1562, 23 L. Ed. 2d 129 (1969), which was criticized in 
Note, American Antitrust Law and Canadian Patent Rights, 118 U.Pa.L.Rev. 983 (1970), for ignoring the fact that Canadian law 
apparently required the restrictive patent licensing policy that was under attack in that case.  The present case is also readily 
distinguishable from those situations, referred to by the majority, where a litigant who has been ordered by an American court to 
produce records maintained in a foreign country would be in violation of foreign law if it complied with the American court order."
342,11," See, e. g., United States v. General Electric Co., 115 F. Supp. 835 (D.N.J.1953); United States v. Imperial Chemical 
Industries, 105 F. Supp. 215 (S.D.N.Y.1952) (in each case, savings clause included in order so as not to place defendant in 
violation of foreign laws).  See generally Beausang, The Extraterritorial Jurisdiction of the Sherman Act, 70 Dick.L.Rev. 187, 
194-95 (1966). "
352,1," .  Jurisdiction is premised upon sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. ยงยง 15 and 26; section 1337 of the Judiciary 
Code, 28 U.S.C. ยง 1337; and the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction."

other grounds, 578 F.2d 1256, 1259, 1262 (8th Cir. 1978); but are not directly material to the legal issues raised by defendants' 
motion to dismiss."
352,3," .  The complaint alleges a combination and conspiracy unreasonably restraining trade in the relevant market, a rule of reason 
violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 1 (count 1); a group boycott, in per se violation of section 1 (count 2); an 
unlawful attempt to monopolize the relevant market, in violation of section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 2 (count 3); a

(1978) (count 6). "
353,," There is no question that the defendants, including the City of Mason City, are ""persons"" within the meaning of the federal 
antitrust laws. E.g., City of Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., 435 U.S. 389, 394-97, 98 S. Ct. 1123, 55 L. Ed. 2d 364

98 S. Ct. at 2044 n.3. (Powell, J., concurring) (1978)."
353,4," .  See notes 2 and 3 Supra.  The court emphasizes that it construes the complaint to be claiming that the City's affirmative 
agreement to exclude all competing developers violates the antitrust laws. Thus, it is not the City's decision to deny Beaver 
Farm's zoning request, as such and without more, that is the allegedly offensive activity."
353,5," .  Thus, HN2[
] a state cannot ""give immunity to those who violate the Sherman Act by authorizing them to violate it, or by 
declaring that their action is lawful."" 317 U.S., at 351, 63 S. Ct., at 314. "
354,6," .  The court's research of the relevant Iowa authorities does not indicate any interpretation of the Iowa zoning statute supporting 
the view that the Iowa legislature's intent and policy in enacting ch. 414 were anticompetitive in nature.  Nor have the defendants 
referred the court to any. "
355,7," .  To say that the Iowa legislature may have foreseen that the zoning statute, when otherwise properly applied by the 
municipalities, might result in anticompetitive Effects is not to say that it therefore also affirmatively contemplated and approved 
direct anticompetitive Activity violative of the federal antitrust laws. See, e.g., Goldfarb, 421 U.S., at 790-91, 95 S. Ct., at 2015 ("".

the opinions."").  Accord, Cantor, 428 U.S., at 579 at 595-96, 96 S. Ct. 3110, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1141 . "
356,8," .  The same analysis would apply with respect to the Iowa Home Rule Statute, Ch. 364, Iowa Code (1978); which defendants 
intimate would possibly be pertinent here.  See, Defendants' Brief in Resistance at p. 6, n.5, filed January 15, 1979.  Cf., City of 
Des Moines v. Lohner, 168 N.W.2d 779, 782 (Iowa 1969)."
356,9," .  Pennington specifically involved an agreement between a union and large coal operator/employers that was in part intended 
to secure uniform labor standards throughout the coal industry.  The Court held that to the extent the agreement had 
anticompetitive effects on segments of the industry outside the particular bargaining unit it was restricted by national antitrust 
policy.  The Clayton and Norris LaGuardia labor exemptions to the Sherman Act would not apply.  381 U.S., at 661-668, 85 S. 
Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626. However, to the extent evidence adduced an agreement between private entities involving concerted 
effort merely to influence action by the Secretary of Labor, the agreement would not be in violation of the Sherman Act. Id., at 
669-72, 85 S. Ct. 1585."
356,10," .  In California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S., at 508 at 510-11, 92 S. Ct. 609, 30 L. Ed. 2d 642, the 
Supreme Court extended the Noerr-Pennington rule to attempts to influence administrative and judicial proceedings in addition 
to the legislative and executive actions specifically at issue in Noerr and Pennington.  The Court, furthermore, clarified the Noerr-
Pennington delineation of a ""mere sham"" exception.  See, California Transport, id., at 511-12, 92 S. Ct. 609. "
357,11," .  A specific holding in Mark Aero, see 580 F.2d, at 297, was that the allegations of the complaint did not come within the ""mere 
sham"" exception to Noerr-Pennington immunity the exception the Supreme Court delineated in its California Motor decision.  
There were no allegations in Mark Aero, as there are here, that the governmental entity was a partner in the anticompetitive 
agreement or conspiracy. Such allegations are sufficient to raise the reasonable inference that any meaningful access to Mason 
City's zoning procedures on plaintiffs' part was totally and permanently foreclosed.  Unlike the Mark Aero case, the allegations 
here are sufficient to interject the ""mere sham"" exception as an issue requiring further factual elaboration.  See, e.g., Mark Aero, 
580 F.2d, at 295 & n.28, 296 (""The fundamental question presented in each case involving the ""sham' exception, whether 
argued in a nonadjudicative or an adjudicative setting, is the question of intent."")."

license by the Interstate Commerce Commission to so operate, has it suffered injury ""in its business"" which is compensable in 
an action under Section 303 of the Labor Management Relations Act?"
370,2," . Does the NLRB's finding of an unfair labor practice foreclose consideration of the labor exemptions, statutory or implied, to the 
antitrust laws?"
370,3, . Must the legality of the Rules on Containers be tested against a Per se rule of antitrust violation?
370,4," . Where plaintiff's business is conducted unlawfully, that is, where it operates as a freight forwarder having been refused a

the Clayton Act?"
370,7, .  See note 3 Supra. 
371,8," .  See, e.g., Old Dutch Farms, Inc. v. Milk Drivers & Dairy Employees Union, 359 F.2d 598, 602-03 n. 7 (2d Cir.), Cert. denied, 
385 U.S. 832, 87 S. Ct. 71, 17 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1966); United Brick & Clay Workers of America v. Deena Artware, Inc., 198 F.2d 
637 (6th Cir. 1952), Cert. denied, 345 U.S. 906, 73 S. Ct. 644, 97 L. Ed. 1342 (1953). In Riverton Coal Co. v. UMW, 453 F.2d

foreclosed on the basis of a prior agency decision had not been decided in prior NLRB proceedings involving the same parties. 
Hence that case is inapposite here. "
372,9," .  ILA also argues against recognition of the judgment in the unfair labor practice case in that the NLRB's proceedings are 
directed toward vindication of ""public"" rights, while those asserted in the ยง 303(b) count are only private. It is true that the 
charging party in an unfair labor practice proceeding before the Board advances the public interest in a fair and orderly labor 
marketplace. But the typical charging party acts primarily in his own interest to halt conduct that is injuring him personally. 
Equally when resorting to a ยง 303(b) remedy the plaintiff, while acting primarily in his own interest, vindicates the public policy of 
the National Labor Relations Act prohibiting unfair labor practices. That public policy, as interpreted by the NLRB, should in the ยง 
303(b) case determine whether or not there has been a violation. We are therefore unpersuaded that the differing object of 
proceedings before the NLRB should serve as a ground for reducing their collateral estoppel effect. "
373,10," .  These rejections also may indicate that evidence of the manner in which Conex and Twin acquired the stuffing and stripping 
work would not have had any impact on the NLRB decision. It was the General Counsel's position in the ยง 10(L ) case before 
Judge Lacey, and that of the charging parties before the Board, that regardless of how the latter acquired the work the Rules on 
Containers were an illegal work reacquisition agreement. The Board appears subsequently to have adopted that position. See 
International Longshoremen's Ass'n (Dolphin Forwarding, Inc.), 236 N.L.R.B. No. 42, 98 L.R.M.M. 1276, 1277 n.3 (1978). 
Because we hold that there was an adequate opportunity to litigate the work acquisition contention, however, it is not necessary 
to rest our holding on the probable irrelevancy of the tendered evidence to the unfair labor practice determination."
373,11," .  In International Longshoremen's Ass'n, Local 1248 (U.S. Naval Supply Center), 195 N.L.R.B. 273 (1972), an attempt to 
enforce the Rules against an off-pier consolidator was held to be an unlawful secondary boycott. Thus a full year before the 
enforcement of the Dublin Supplement began the NLRB had questioned its legality. "
375,12," .  Because we hold that the choice of a governing limitations period, borrowed or otherwise, does not depend on New Jersey 
choice of law rules we need not decide whether, had we concluded New Jersey choice of law rules applied, the result would be 
different. We note, however, that since New Jersey Teamsters were employed by Conex and Twin in that state, and were 
deprived of employment there by the unfair labor practices complained of, it seems likely that New Jersey would apply its own 
statute of limitations. See Schum v. Bailey, 578 F.2d 493 (3d Cir. 1978); Allen v. Volkswagen of America, Inc., 555 F.2d 361, 364 
(3d Cir. 1977) (Seitz, C.J., concurring)."

App. 321a. "
378,15," .  The stevedore defendants do contend that as a matter of antitrust law the record on summary judgment is legally insufficient 
to bind them. That contention is discussed at Part V. F., Infra. "
379,16," .  Congress at the same time recognized that the special historical situation in the construction and apparel industries justified a 
limited exception to ยง 8(e) for those two industries. Those provisions are, of course, inapplicable here. "
380,17," .  The Supreme Court has recently cautioned that all exemptions from the antitrust laws, including the labor exemption, are to 
be narrowly construed.  Group Life & Health Insurance Co. v. Royal Drug Co., 440 U.S. 205, 229, 230, 99 S. Ct. 1067, 1082, 59 
L. Ed. 2d 261 (1979). "
388,18," .  Even if the rule of reason were to be applied here, the parties have suggested no procompetitive effects which would justify 
the challenged restraints under a rule of reason analysis. "
389,19," .  Conex and Twin settled the FMC proceeding with TTT, the third vessel owner and dismissed the FMC complaint against it 
with prejudice. Twin settled its FMC complaint against Seatrain and dismissed its complaint with prejudice as to that defendant 
only. Whether Seatrain is entitled to a credit for whatever it paid in reparation for violations of the Shipping Act should Twin 
establish damage to its business or property is an issue not presented on this appeal."
389,20," .  Compare, e.g., The Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. ยง 9. "

(1943). We do not believe that holding survives Perma Life. "
392,1," .  I do not dispute that collateral estoppel, to the extent it establishes violations of ยงยง 8(b)(4) and 8(e), is applicable here. I do 
not, however, agree with all of the dictum in the majority opinion. I note particularly that in International Bhd. of Teamsters v. 
Daniel, 439 U.S. 551, 99 S. Ct. 790, 58 L. Ed. 2d 808 (1979), the Supreme Court cautioned that the weight to be given an 
administrative agency's interpretation of the statute under which it operates must be limited by a court's obligation to honor the 
clear meaning of the legislation. I also read Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322, 99 S. Ct. 645, 58 L. Ed. 2d 552 (1979), 
as permitting scrutiny of administrative procedures before according collateral estoppel effect to agency decisions."
392,2," .   National Soc'y of Professional Eng'rs v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 98 S. Ct. 1355, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1978), though 
emphasizing the anti-competitive focus of the rule of reason, was interpreting that very precept, not announcing a new per se 
classification. That opinion, therefore, is of no relevance in determining as an initial matter which mode of antitrust analysis to 
employ. See generally Handler, Antitrust 1978, 78 Colum.L.Rev. 1363, 1364-74 (1978)."
392,3," .  The courts of appeals have favored the rule of reason in noncompetitor boycott situations. See the cases collected in Smith v.

the District Court's conclusion that the blanket license was not an unreasonable restraint of trade.  See 562 F.2d 130, 132, 135, 
141 n. 29 (CA2 1977)."
402,9," At CBS's suggestion, the Court of Appeals held that the challenged conduct constituted misuse of copyrights solely on the 
basis of its finding of unlawful price fixing. Id., at 141 n. 29."
402,10," The Court of Appeals went on to suggest some guidelines as to remedy, indicating that despite its conclusion on liability the 
blanket license was not totally forbidden.  The Court of Appeals said: ""Normally, after a finding of price-fixing, the remedy is an injunction against the price-fixing -- in this case, the blanket license. 
We think, however, that if on remand a remedy can be fashioned which will ensure that the blanket license will not affect the 
price or negotiations for direct licenses, the blanket license need not be prohibited in all circumstances.  The blanket license is 
not simply a 'naked restraint' ineluctably doomed to extinction.  There is not enough evidence in the present record to compel a 
finding that the blanket license does not serve a market need for those who wish full protection against infringement suits or 
who, for some other business reason, deem the blanket license desirable.  The blanket license includes a practical covenant not 
to sue for infringement of any ASCAP copyright as well as an indemnification against suits by others. ""Our objection to the blanket license is that it reduces price competition among the members and provides a disinclination to 
compete.  We think that these objections may be removed if ASCAP itself is required to provide some form of per use licensing 
which will ensure competition among the individual members with respect to those networks which wish to engage in per use 
licensing."" Id., at 140 (footnotes omitted)."
402,11," ""This principle of per se unreasonableness not only makes the type of restraints which are proscribed by the Sherman Act 
more certain to the benefit of everyone concerned, but it also avoids the necessity for an incredibly complicated and prolonged 
economic investigation into the entire history of the industry involved, as well as related industries, in an effort to determine at 
large whether a particular restraint has been unreasonable -- an inquiry so often wholly fruitless when undertaken."" Northern

403,13," CBS also complains that it pays a flat fee regardless of the amount of use it makes of ASCAP compositions and even though 
many of its programs contain little or no music. We are unable to see how that alone could make out an antitrust violation or 
misuse of copyrights: ""Sound business judgment could indicate that such payment represents the most convenient method of fixing the business value 
of the privileges granted by the licensing agreement. . . .  Petitioner cannot complain because it must pay royalties whether it 
uses Hazeltine patents or not.  What it acquired by the agreement into which it entered was the privilege to use any or all of the 
patents and developments as it desired to use them."" Automatic Radio Mfg. Co. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 339 U.S. 827, 834

fee if the parties are unable to agree.  Nonetheless, the parties stipulated, and the courts below accepted, that ""CBS could

405,22," National Broadcasting Co. did, in 1971, request an annual blanket license for 2,217 specific ASCAP compositions most 
frequently used on its variety shows.  It intended to acquire the remaining rights to background and theme music through direct 
transactions by it and its program packagers.  See United States v. ASCAP (Application of National Broadcasting Co.), supra."

405,24," Cf. Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S., at 50 n. 16. Moreover, unthinking application of the per se rule might 
upset the balancing of economic power and of procompetitive and anticompetitive effects presumably worked out in the decree. "
406,25," See cases cited n. 18, supra.  Those cases involved licenses sold to individual movie theaters to ""perform"" compositions 
already on the motion pictures' soundtracks.  ASCAP had barred its members from assigning performing rights to movie 
producers at the same time recording rights were licensed, and the theaters were effectively unable to engage in direct 
transactions for performing rights with individual copyright owners. "
407,26," Certain individual television and radio stations, appearing here as amici curiae, argue that the per se rule should extend to 
ASCAP's blanket licenses with them as well.  The television stations have filed an antitrust suit to that effect.  Buffalo 
Broadcasting Co. v. ASCAP, 78 Civ. 5670 (SDNY, filed Nov. 27, 1978)."
407,27," See n. 10, supra.  The Court of Appeals would apparently not outlaw the blanket license across the board but would permit it 
in various circumstances where it is deemed necessary or sufficiently desirable.  It did not even enjoin blanket licensing with the 
television networks, the relief it realized would normally follow a finding of per se illegality of the license in that context.  Instead, 
as requested by CBS, it remanded to the District Court to require ASCAP to offer in addition to blanket licensing some 
competitive form of per-use licensing. But per-use licensing by ASCAP, as recognized in the consent decrees, might be even 
more susceptible to the per se rule than blanket licensing. The rationale for this unusual relief in a per se case was that ""[the] blanket license is not simply a 'naked restraint' ineluctably 
doomed to extinction."" 562 F.2d, at 140. To the contrary, the Court of Appeals found that the blanket license might well ""serve a 
market need"" for some.  Ibid.  This, it seems to us, is not the per se approach, which does not yield so readily to circumstances, 
but in effect is a rather bobtailed application of the rule of reason, bobtailed in the sense that it is unaccompanied by the 
necessary analysis demonstrating why the particular licensing system is an undue competitive restraint."
407,28," Surely, if ASCAP abandoned the issuance of all licenses and confined its activities to policing the market and suing infringers, 
it could hardly be said that member copyright owners would be in violation of the antitrust laws by not having a common agent 
issue per-use licenses. Under the copyright laws, those who publicly perform copyrighted music have the burden of obtaining 
prior consent.  Cf. Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U.S., at 139-140."
407,29," In its complaint, CBS alleged that it would be ""wholly impracticable"" for it to obtain individual licenses directly from the 
composers and publishing houses, but it now says that it would be willing to do exactly that if ASCAP were enjoined from 
granting blanket licenses to CBS or its competitors in the network television business. "

408,32," Cf.  Silver v. New York Stock Exchange, 373 U.S. 341 (1963). Because a musical composition can be ""consumed"" by many different people at the same time and without the creator's 
knowledge, the ""owner"" has no real way to demand reimbursement for the use of his property except through the copyright laws 
and an effective way to enforce those legal rights.  See Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken, 422 U.S. 151, 162 (1975). It 
takes an organization of rather large size to monitor most or all uses and to deal with users on behalf of the composers. 
Moreover, it is inefficient to have too many such organizations duplicating each other's monitoring of use."
408,33," The scrutiny occasionally required must not merely subsume the burdensome analysis required under the rule of reason, see 
National Society of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 690-692 (1978), or else we should apply the rule of 
reason from the start.  That is why the per se rule is not employed until after considerable experience with the type of challenged 
restraint. "
409,34," And of course changes brought about by new technology or new marketing techniques might also undercut the justification for 
the practice."

which compositions are used."

Contemp. Prob. 294, 297 (1954) (""The disk-jockey's itchy fingers and the bandleader's restive baton, it is said, cannot wait for 
contracts to be drawn with ASCAP's individual publisher members, much less for the formal acquiescence of a characteristically 
unavailable composer or author"").  Significantly, ASCAP deals only with nondramatic performance rights.  Because of their 
nature, dramatic rights, such as for musicals, can be negotiated individually and well in advance of the time of performance.  The 
same is true of various other rights, such as sheet music, recording, and synchronization, which are licensed on an individual 
basis."

performing rights are licensed on other than a blanket basis in any nation in the world"")."
409,40," Moreover, because of the nature of the product -- a composition can be simultaneously ""consumed"" by many users -- 
composers have numerous markets and numerous incentives to produce, so the blanket license is unlikely to cause decreased "
410,," output, one of the normal undesirable effects of a cartel.  And since popular songs get an increased share of ASCAP's revenue 
distributions, composers compete even within the blanket license in terms of productivity and consumer satisfaction."

410,43," It is argued that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should nevertheless be affirmed on the ground that the blanket license is 
a tying arrangement in violation of ยง 1 of the Sherman Act or on the ground that ASCAP and BMI have monopolized the relevant 
market contrary to ยง 2.  The District Court and the Court of Appeals rejected both submissions, and we do not disturb the latter's 
judgment in these respects, particularly since CBS did not file its own petition for certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals' 
failure to sustain its tying and monopolization claims. "
411,44," The Court of Appeals did not address the rule-of-reason issue, and BMI insists that CBS did not preserve the question in that

414,16," For many years prior to the commencement of this action, the BMI blanket-license fee amounted to 1.09% of net receipts from 
sponsors after certain specified deductions.  400 F.Supp., at 743. The fee for access to ASCAP's larger repertoire was set at 
2.5% of net receipts; in recent years, however, CBS has paid a flat negotiated fee, rather than a percentage, to ASCAP.  23 Jt. 
App. in CA2 No. 75-7600, pp. E1051-E1052, E1135."
414,17," See Cirace, supra, at 288: ""This history indicates that, from its inception, ASCAP exhibited a tendency to discriminate in price.  A license fee based upon a 
percentage of gross revenue is discriminatory in that it grants the same number of rights to different licensees for different total 
dollar amounts, depending upon their ability to pay.  The effectiveness of price discrimination is significantly enhanced by the all-
or-nothing blanket license."""
414,18," Under the ASCAP consent decree, on receipt of an application, ASCAP is required to ""advise the applicant in writing of the fee 
which it deems reasonable for the license requested."" If the parties are unable to agree on the fee within 60 days of the 
application, the applicant may apply to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York for the 
determination of a ""reasonable fee."" United States v. ASCAP, 1950-1951 Trade Cases para. 62,595, p. 63,754 (SDNY 1950). 
The BMI decree contains no similar provision for judicial determination of a reasonable fee."

414,20," See 562 F.2d, at 136 n. 15. In determining royalties ASCAP distinguishes between feature, theme, and background uses of 
music. The 1950 amended decree requires ASCAP to distribute royalties on ""a basis which gives primary consideration to the 
performance of the compositions."" The 1960 decree provided for the additional option of receiving royalties under a deferred 
plan which provides additional compensation based on length of membership and the recognized status of the individual's 
works.  See United States v. ASCAP, 1960 Trade Cases para. 69,612, pp. 76,469-76,470 (SDNY 1960). "

prohibitively high, at least in the absence of any broker or agency routinely handling such requests.  Moreover, the District Court 
found that writers and publishers support and prefer the ASCAP system to direct dealing.  Id., at 767. While their apprehension 
at direct dealing with CBS could be overcome, the District Court found, by CBS's market power and the importance of television 
exposure, a similar conclusion is far less likely with respect to other users."
416,31," The risks involved in such a venture appear to be substantial.  One significant risk, which may be traced directly to ASCAP 
and its members, relates to music ""in the can"" -- music which has been performed on shows and movies already in the network's 
inventory, but for which the network must still secure performing rights.  The networks accumulate substantial inventories of 
shows ""in the can."" And, as the Government has pointed out as amicus curiae: ""If they [the networks and television stations] were to discontinue the blanket license, they then would be required to obtain 
performance rights for these already-produced shows.  This attempt would create an opportunity for the copyright owners, as a 
condition of granting performing rights, to attempt to obtain the entire value of the shows 'in the can.' It would produce, in other 
words, a case of bilateral monopoly. Because pricing is indeterminate in a bilateral monopoly, television networks would not 
terminate their blanket licenses until they had concluded an agreement with every owner of copyrighted music 'in the can' to "
417,," allow future performance for an identified price; the networks then would determine whether that price was sufficiently low that 
termination of the blanket license would be profitable.  But the prospect of such negotiations offers the copyrights owners an 
ability to misuse their rights in a way that ensures the continuation of blanket licensing despite a change in market conditions 
that may make other forms of licensing preferable."" Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 24-25. This analysis is in no sense inconsistent with the findings of the District Court.  The District Court did reject CBS's coercion 
argument as to music ""in the can."" But as the Government again points out, the District Court's findings were addressed 
essentially to a tie-in claim; ""the court did not consider the possibility that the copyright owners' self-interested, non-coercive 
demands for compensation might nevertheless make the cost of CBS' dropping the blanket license sufficiently high that ASCAP 
and BMI could take this 'termination penalty' into account in setting fees for the blanket license."" Id., at 25 n. 23. "

426,5," .  The court certified a conditional class pursuant to Rule 23(c)(1), Fed.R.Civ.P., for settlement. Settlement Order No. 1, entered 
April 3, 1978.  The Manual for Complex Litigation, Part 1, ยง 1.46 (rev. ed. 1977), recognizes tentative certification of classes as a 
growing practice in complex actions but recommends that the practice not be continued.  The Manual's recommendation has, it 
appears, been more honored by breach than by compliance.  See City of Detroit v. Grinnell Corp., 495 F.2d 448, 466 (2d Cir. 
1974) and cases cited therein.  See also Developments in the Law Class Actions, 89 Harv.L.Rev. 1318, 1555-60 (1976). The 
procedures set out in the Manual are not intractable rules but are suggestions for the orderly progress of complicated litigation.  
Manual for Complex Litigation, Foreword (rev. ed. 1977).  The causes for not conditionally certifying a class for settlement 
(possibilities of collusion, of less than total representation of class members, of hasty and inadequate settlements by attorneys 
jockeying to earn a fee award) are not present herein.  There have been no charges of collusion and no offers for settlement for 
less than the whole class, Cf.  In re General Motors Corp. Engine Interchange Litigation, 594 F.2d 1106, n. 38 (7th Cir. 1979). 
(subclass tentatively certified for settlement).  Class counsel worked jointly through lead counsel to secure the proposed 
settlement conditions and terms.  Conditional certification of the class for settlement was appropriate under the circumstances 
presented."
426,6," .  The notices were mailed to a list of potential class members. The master list was compiled from the defendants' records of 
customers, their suggestions of customers of competitors' services, their identification of the Governor, Secretary of State, and 
Attorney General of each of the fifty states, and from the plaintiffs' purchase from National Business Lists, Inc., mailing lists of: 
(a) banks, (b) savings and loan associations, (c) grocery stores with a net worth in excess of $ 75,000, (d) department and 
discount stores with a net worth in excess of $ 75,000, (e) city halls, (f) county seats, (g) stock and bond brokers, (h) universities 
and colleges, (i) junior colleges, and (j) school district headquarters."
426,7," .  The settlement amount of $ 11,800,000.00, deposited on April 3, 1978, bears interest at the prime rate.  The fund reportedly 
totalled $ 12,931,991.65 on March 19, 1979.  The notice stated that attorney fees and expenses and costs of administration of 
the fund, estimated not to exceed $ 1,750,000, would be subtracted from the settlement fund. The potential class members were 
notified that the settlement fund was offered in exchange for the dismissal with prejudice of all antitrust claims held against the 
three codefendants for the period January 1, 1968 to February 21, 1978. It further announced that the proportional shares of the 
claimants would be determined upon a plan of distribution to be presented to the claimants and court if the settlement proposal 
were approved. "
427,8," .  The State of California, the Central Penn National Bank, and the Atlantic Richfield Company have filed objections to the 
settlement proposal and the joint petition for attorneys' fees.  The State of Ohio (nominally joined by the State of Arizona) has 
filed objection to the attorneys' fee request. The State of Missouri, a named settling plaintiff, apprised the court in timely fashion of its concern that the attorneys' fee position 
was excessive and noted belatedly its objection to the settlement."
427,9," .  The court might conclude that the State of Ohio's and the Central Penn National Bank's failure to renew their objections after 
the plaintiffs' submission of the economic supplement should be deemed an abandonment of their opposition.  The court will not 
draw this conclusion but will consider Ohio's objection to the fee petition and Central Penn's objection to the notice, definition of 
the class, and attorneys' fees along with similar opposition raised by the State of California and the Atlantic Richfield Company. "
429,10," .  Before the settlement agreement was executed plaintiffs' counsel reviewed thousands of documents, those produced by 
defendants pursuant to Grand Jury subpoena and those produced in discovery in this litigation, in order to verify defendants' 
negotiation representations of the structure and economics of the industry and the nature of the violations charged.  Counsel 
also interviewed their named plaintiff clients for a customer's view of these matters.  Affidavit of D. Shapiro. "
430,11," .  The court is reminded of similar circumstances raised in this appellate review of a trial court's approval of the settlement of an 
employment discrimination action: It is true that very little Formal discovery was conducted and that there is no voluminous record in the case.  However, the lack of 
such does not compel the conclusion that insufficient discovery was conducted. At the outset, we consider this an appropriate occasion to express our concern over the common belief held by many litigators 
that a great amount of formal discovery must be conducted in every case. Often has this Court reviewed records of cases which 
attest to this commonly held fallacy.  We have often seen cases which were ""over discovered."" In addition to wasting the time of 
this Court, the parties and their attorneys, it often adds unnecessarily to the financial burden of litigation and may often serve as 
a vehicle to harass a party.  Discovery in its most efficient utilization should be totally extra-judicial.  The Court should rarely be 
required to intervene.  Being an extra-judicial process, informality in the discovery of information is desired.  It is too often 
forgotten that a conference with or telephone call to opposing counsel may often achieve the results sought by formal discovery. In the instant case, Judge Pointer specifically requested the plaintiffs and defendants to conduct discovery on an informal basis.  
Counsel proceeded to do just that.  The attorneys for plaintiffs and defendants indicated to the trial judge that they had achieved 
the desired quantum of information necessary to achieve a settlement. The Court was informed of the results of their discovery 
in several conferences. Cotton v. Hinton, 559 F.2d at 1332. "
431,12," .  The court notes that a federal grand jury sitting in the Central District of California has recently returned criminal indictments: 
(1) charging Armored Transport, Inc. and two of its corporate officers with engaging in a conspiracy to allocate customers and to 
rig bids and price quotations; and (2) charging Loomis Armored Car Service, Inc. with engaging in an unlawful combination to 
submit rigged and collusive bids and price quotations.  These conspiracies are alleged to have restrained trade in the armored 
car industry in the State of California and the Los Angeles area, respectively.  Brink's, Inc. is named, but not charged in both 
indictments. California's Further Authority in Opposition to the Class Settlement, filed March 15, 1979.  These indictments lend 
support to our determination that California may have been injured as a result of an unrelated conspiracy. California should be 
free to pursue any antitrust claims it holds against Armored Transport and Loomis. "
434,13," .  HN11[
] Damages conventionally would be estimated by internal comparisons of the conspirators' prices during and after 
the conspiracy or by external comparisons of the conspirators' prices with those of a nonconspiring competitor or in an 
unaffected market, See e.g., City of New York v. Darling-Delaware, Inc., 1976 Trade Cases (CCH) P 60,812 (S.D.N.Y.1976). 
Upon a review of the data compiled by defendants from random accounts and price histories, the plaintiffs' expert concluded that 
a classic study and projection of damages could not be done.  The traditional internal and external comparisons were not 
possible and prices, the currency of comparisons, were not available in the instant litigation."
434,14," .  Plaintiffs' expert expressed the comparison of during and post conspiracy profits as a differential in profit margins, I. e., the 
percentage profit margin during the conspiracy minus the percentage profit margin after the conspiracy. These differentials were 
adjusted to isolate the effect of the conspiracy from other known market and economic variables. "
437,15," .  If defendants were thrust into bankruptcy, plaintiffs would likely recover only a small part of their claimed damages when 
defendants' assets were apportioned among an array of scheduled creditors.  Also if defendants, three of the largest suppliers in 
the trade, were forced out of business, the cost of armored car services predictably would climb.  Either result would disserve the 
interests of the class of claimants. "
438,16," .  The court does not deprecate the stern adversarial role which the State of California has assumed in this litigation.  The state 
attorney general is charged with scrutinizing such settlements in the public interest.  The objector has satisfied this weighty 
assignment herein.  The court notes, however, that this is not an antitrust conspiracy directly affecting private individuals of 
modest means; rather it is a conspiracy which allegedly tended to injure large public and private institutions that had occasion to 
use armored car services.  These behemoths need not rely upon one attorney general but may assert their own objections.  
Their silence in this case should therefore be read as acquiescence instead of inadequacy. "
439,17," .  California objects that it has been more severely injured from the alleged conspiracy than other claimants yet must share with 
them in the fund.  First, the court has already concluded that California's damages may have been aggravated by an unrelated 
conspiracy and that its rights against the West Coast conspirators are unaffected herein.  Order entered December 4, 1978.  
See note 12, Supra.  Further, any plan of distribution (a scheme of equal shares or weighted shares) has yet to be presented 
and argued. California may wish to renew its objections if a later proposed plan does not appear to satisfy its interests."
439,18," .  The notice did not offer a take-it-or-leave-it choice to potential class members.  Instead the recipients were notified of the 
options: (i) of tendering claims to participate in the settlement proposal, (ii) of opting out of the class and pursuing individual 
remedies, or (iii) of remaining in the class but objecting to the settlement terms.  No cognizable rights were compromised upon a 
decision to be excluded from the settlement class or upon the choice to remain in the class but object to the settlement. 
Compare In re General Motors Engine Interchange Litigation, 594 F.2d 1106 (7th Cir. 1979) (subclass members were compelled 
to waive their federal right of action upon a decision to opt out) With Philadelphia Housing Authority v. American Radiator & 
Standard Sanitary Corp., 323 F. Supp. 364, 373 (E.D.Pa.1970) (tentative class members' rights were not determined by the 
mere submission of the settlement proposal for approval as the proposal allowed opportunities for exclusion from class and 
objection to the settlement). "
440,19," .  Twenty law firms or groups have submitted claims in the joint application for attorneys' fees.  The Office of Attorney General 
for the State of Connecticut has been listed among counsel of record in Connecticut v. Brink's, Inc., C.A. No. 77-1878, but seeks 
no share in the award.  Counsel has been separately retained in Hillman's, Inc. v. Brink's, Inc., C.A. No. 77-1880; See Note 4, 
Supra, and has not joined the united petition."
440,20," .  The Atlantic Richfield Company appeared to second the objectors' complaints with the joint fee petition at the fairness 
hearing on January 25, 1979.  Tr. at 82, 91. "
442,21," .  Courts have also been guided in determining attorneys' fee awards by a need ""to stimulate the motive for representation of 
classes . . . ."" Manual for Complex Litigation, Part 1, ยง 1.47(a) (rev.ed.1977).  This need has been apparent in some civil rights 
actions.  See NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 443, 83 S. Ct. 328, 9 L. Ed. 2d 405 (1963); Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, 
Inc., 488 F.2d 714, 719 (5th Cir. 1974). Nationwide antitrust class actions appear more desirable among the organized bar and 
the need to stimulate representation is less evident.  The court therefore will rely more heavily on the principle of benefit to class 
than upon consideration of encouraging class representation in fashioning this attorneys' fee award. "
443,22," .  The ""mixed hourly rate"" averages the reasonable rates of senior and novice attorneys and recognizes a variety of legal tasks, 
from complex to routine. "
444,23," .  On remand from Grinnell I, 495 F.2d 448 (2d Cir. 1974), the district court allowed an hourly rate of $ 125 for Mr. David 
Berger. On appeal, the Second Circuit set this award aside on grounds that the hourly rate was excessive.  Grinnell II, 560 F.2d 
1093, 1102 (2d Cir. 1977). In the instant litigation 22 attorneys have claimed hourly rates of $ 125 and above.  Lead counsel 
seek the following: David Berger, $ 250/hour; David I. Shapiro, $ 200/hour; Harold E. Kohn, $ 250/hour; and John E. Burke, $ 
110/hour."
444,24," .  The finding of a mixed hourly lead law firm rate of $ 80/hour is calculated by setting senior counsel rates at $ 125/hour, 
proportionally reducing junior and associate counsel fees, and calculating a weighted average."
444,25," .  The mixed hourly adjunct law firm rate of $ 65/hour derives from setting senior counsel rates at $ 100/hour and scaling down 
junior personnel fees accordingly.  A weighted average hourly rate is then computed. "
446,26," .  The court may be overindulgent in allowing adjunct counsel who did not participate in the court proceedings to recover for this 
time.  Counsel were more likely guarding their individual clients' interests than benefiting the class by attendance at these 
hearings.  See In re Sugar Industry Antitrust Litigation, M.D.L. No. 201, slip op. at 28 and n.29 (N.D.Cal. May 10, 1978). "

] A sufficient relationship to interstate commerce is both a critical jurisdictional fact and an element of the substantive offense charged under 15 U.S.C. ยง 1. Facts sufficient for the one are sufficient for the other, and vice versa. Existence of the 
jurisdictional fact may be attacked independently, or in conjunction with the defense on the merits. Cf.  McLain v. Real Estate 
Board of New Orleans, Inc., 583 F.2d 1315, 1323-24 (5th Cir. 1978), cert. granted,  -- - U.S.  -- , 99 S. Ct. 2159, 60 L. Ed. 2d 
1043 (discussing comparable procedures in civil actions). In this case, all the defendants but Schick & Pepe Realty, Inc. made a 
jurisdictional attack by pre-trial motion to dismiss the indictments under Fed.R.Crim.P. 12. The district court denied this motion, 
assessing the facts as charged in the indictments. When the case then proceeded to trial, the substantive interstate commerce 
issue was submitted to the jury and found against the defendants. Defendants' attack is therefore upon the jury's finding on this 
issue as it was necessarily subsumed within the general verdict of guilty. No challenge having been made to the district court's 
instruction on the issue, we assume its correctness. The only remaining basis for challenge is therefore to the sufficiency of the 
evidence to support the implicit jury finding on this issue, and it is this we review. Because there is no suggestion of variance 
between indictment and proof, review of the sufficiency of the evidence on the substantive issue necessarily reviews the 
sufficiency of the facts as found to support the court's jurisdiction. The jury's findings on the evidence thus in effect supersede 
the district court's jurisdictional finding on raw factual averments in the indictments."
472,3," It may be questioned whether, in any event, these two ""tests"" will withstand logical scrutiny as discretely different frameworks 
for close legal analysis. Courts quite frequently conduct searching interstate commerce relationship analyses without express 
reliance upon them. See, e. g., Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 95 S. Ct. 2004, 44 L. Ed. 2d 572 (1975). 
Significantly on the point, while both sides and the district judge in this case assumed that Goldfarb was a ""local but affecting"" 
case, a distinguished constitutional scholar in a recent analysis assumed without elaboration that it was an ""in-commerce"" type.

473,4," Distinguishing this case factually from those wherein real estate brokerage activities were not shown to have involved any 
considerable volume of out-of-state buyers and sellers. E. g., Diversified Brokerage Services, Inc. v. Greater Des Moines Board 
of Realtors, 521 F.2d 1343, 1346 (8th Cir. 1975). While it may generally be correct to say that ""the mere movement of individuals 
from one state to another in order to utilize particular services does not transform those services into interstate services within 
the meaning of the Sherman Act,"" Id., that hardly describes the factual situation presented here. A more apposite principle for 
the facts of this case is the congressional determination upheld in Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U.S. 241, 85 
S. Ct. 348, 13 L. Ed. 2d 258 (1969), that even ""local"" businesses that provide services to substantial numbers of persons 
traveling across state lines may affect interstate commerce. Here, as the analysis in the body of our opinion shows, there was 
much more of an interstate character to defendants' activities than merely awaiting passively the chance descent of out-of-state 
customers and then providing these with purely ""local"" services. "
474,5," This included advertising in Washington, D.C., newspapers and radio stations (App. 111, 998, 1003), the Foreign Service 
Journal, and the Army, Navy, Air Force Times (App. 1020-21). At least one defendant advertised its use of a ""Military Transfer 
Department"" and a ""Corporate Referral Department"" which enabled it to identify potential buyers and sellers among military and 
business transferees (App. 1042-43); offered to military personnel a ""Free Relocation Kit"" (App. 187-88); and invited collect 
telephone calls from prospective home purchasers coming into the Washington, D.C., area (App. 1039)."

478,12," Some defendants may contend for an even more specific intent: to denigrate or mock the law in the sense apparently of 
intending specifically to violate the Sherman Act. Because we find even the less stringent requirement without support, we do 
not address this one."
478,13," Gypsum also involved a rule of reason offense rather than a per se violation of ยง 1 such as the price fixing here alleged. While

framed in terms of all ยง 1 criminal prosecutions. "
480,14, See text accompanying note 4 Supra.
480,15," This rule has developed in cases involving alleged constitutional improprieties so it may be said to be predicated on a lack of

See Burdeau v. McDowell, 256 U.S. at 476-77, 41 S. Ct. 574 (Brandeis, J., dissenting). If impropriety of a constitutional

is the very reason underlying the policy of judicial abstention expressed in the doctrine in issue."" 550 F.2d at 77-78. The court found that, even if the Department of State had not openly expressed its position, the political and diplomatic 
dimensions were too burdensome for resolution by the judiciary: ""The action taken here is obviously only an isolated act in a 
continuing and broadened confrontation between the East and West in an oil crisis which has implications and complications far 
transcending those suggested by appellants."" 550 F.2d 78. No such ""implications and complications"" hinder a resolution of

500,5," We have struggled to fashion what we believe is an appropriate test because recent Seventh Circuit decisions have created a 
doctrinal void in this area.  In its most recent decision expressly adopting a standing test, the Seventh Circuit seemed to use 
both the ""zone of interests"" and ""target area"" tests.  Illinois v. Ampress Brick Co., 536 F.2d 1163, 1164, 1167 (7th Cir. 1976). 
That decision was reversed by the Supreme Court in an opinion which expressly refrained from addressing the standing issue.  
Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 728 n.7, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977). The Seventh Circuit's most recent 
opinion on standing admits that, because of the Supreme Court reversal, the legal foundation of its standing analysis in Ampress 
Brick now requires reconsideration, but then finds it unnecessary to select or reject any of the various standing and injury 
doctrines.  Lupia, supra, 586 F.2d at 1169. "
504,6," Sullivan states that ""Injured competitor's suppliers, landlord, employees and stockholders . . .  (might well be denied standing) 
unless under the particular circumstances they could show a more immediate relationship to the violation that is typically 
associated with such status,"" Quoted in Petroleum for Contractors, Inc. v. Mobil Oil Corp., 1978-2 Trade Cases P 62,352 
(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 20, 1978). "
505,7," We agree with Utah that the Seventh Circuit's Bernard Food decision, although quoting the Samson Crane limitations on the 
Act, was not intended to freeze the statute into so rigid a mold as Westinghouse contends.  The quotation is followed by a 
statement recognizing the Act's applicability to ""false or deceitful representations which the manufacturer or merchant makes 
about his own goods or services"" and by a citation to L'Aiglon Apparel v. Lana Lobell, Inc., 214 F.2d 649 (3d Cir. 1954), where 
the court rejected the argument that the Act should be limited to trademark misuse or ""palming off"" of one's goods as those of 
another.  The quotation is best viewed as support for the more narrow holding of Bernard Food, namely, that the Act does not 
embrace representations made by a defendant about a Plaintiff's product.  See Skil Corp. v. Rockwell International Corp., 375 F. 
Supp. 777, 782-86 (N.D.Ill.1973). "
506,8," On this basis, our decision can be harmonized with such divergent cases as Ames Publishing, supra, where the court applied 
ยง 43(a) to misrepresentations concerning magazine circulation, which was the primary basis of competition among controlled 
circulation publishers, and with Fur Information and Fashion Council, Inc. v. E. F. Timme & Son, Inc., 501 F.2d 1048 (2d Cir. 
1974), where the court refused to apply ยง 43(a) to misrepresentations about the environmental virtues of imitation fur garments, 
since the inherent qualities of the goods provided the major basis for consumer choice.  Because of our limited holding, we find it 
unnecessary to consider Utah's argument that ยง 43(a) covers Any misrepresentation by a defendant of his merchandise where 
that merchandise moves in interstate commerce. "

limitation on the antitrust statute appellees allegedly violated. HN7[
] While ยง 1 of the Sherman Act in terms prohibits all combinations and conspiracies in restraint of interstate or foreign trade or commerce, the scope of the Act has been narrowed by judicial construction to combinations or conspiracies which 
""unreasonably"" affect trade or commerce in the sense that they violate the ""rule of reason"" which has long been recognized in 
antitrust cases.  See, e. g., Northern Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 4-5, 78 S. Ct. 514, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1958), and 
Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U.S. 469, 60 S. Ct. 982, 84 L. Ed. 1311 (1940). The rule of reason requires that the restraint in 
question affect market prices or otherwise deprive the consuming public of the benefits of free competition. Apex Hosiery Co. v.

condemns there is substantial interplay between the theory of the labor exemption and the ""rule of reason"" doctrine, See Apex 
Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U.S. 469, 60 S. Ct. 982, 84 L. Ed. 1311 (1940), and the protection afforded appellees in the instant

outlet for Wetterau products in the face of an economic strike which threatened to close this outlet.  While Wetterau's conduct

863, Rehearing denied, 403 U.S. 912, 91 S. Ct. 2204, 29 L. Ed. 2d 690 (1971). The complete text of the court's decision reads 
as follows: Ethicon's Gerard patent No. 3,028,576 was held invalid because the trial court found that under 35 U.S.C. ยง 102(b) there was 
prior public use for more than one year of the concept of the machine, the subject of the patent. There is little or no direct contradiction in the oral evidence. In our view, we have a case that could have been decided either 
way. Ethicon contends the testimony of Handgards' principal was too weak and impaired by certain circumstances. But the trial 
court was entitled to give more weight to other circumstances which point to Handgards' version being correct. The decree is affirmed because the findings are not clearly erroneous. "
526,6," Walker Process stands for the proposition that ""the enforcement of a patent procured by fraud on the Patent Office may be 
violative of ยง 2 of the Sherman Act provided the other elements necessary to a ยง 2 case are present."" 382 U.S. at 174, 86 S. Ct. 
at 349. Mr. Justice Harlan, concurring, stressed that ""deliberate fraud"" was required and that the Court did not hold that private antitrust suits might also reach monopolies practiced under patents that for one reason or another may turn out to be 
voidable under one or more of the numerous technicalities attending the issuance of a patent (for such a result) might well chill 
the disclosure of inventions through the obtaining of a patent because of fear of the vexations or punitive consequences of 
treble-damage suits."
526,382," U.S. at 180, 86 S. Ct. at 351-352 (Harlan, J., concurring). Handgards' original complaint charged the defendants with (i) a violation of section 7 of the Clayton Act, allegedly occurring 
when Ethicon acquired the assets of the Scott Company in 1961 and (ii) violations of the Sherman Act, allegedly occurring as 
the result of a fraudulent procurement of the Orsini patent. A supplemental complaint was filed in 1974 which also charged that 
the defendants had continued to violate the antitrust laws since the date of the original complaint by committing certain illegal 
acts such as the instigation of baseless lawsuits and pricecutting. Neither complaint charged Ethicon with fraudulent 
procurement of the Gerard patent. Although plaintiff sought to add such a contention in 1974, the district court had denied leave 
to amend the complaint. The only allegations in either complaint pertaining to the invalidity of the Gerard patent were that the 
Gerard patent had been found invalid on the basis of a prior public use and that ""(during) the pendency of such action, 
defendants obtained additional information showing and confirming the invalidity of the Gerard patent."""
526,7," In 1971 Ethicon filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the undisputed facts precluded a finding that the Orsini 
product patent had been fraudulently procured under the criteria set out in Walker Process, supra. See note 6 Supra. The district 
court denied defendant's motion in 1972 pending completion of discovery in the case, but noted that ""(a) ruling that no triable 
issue of fraud in the procurement of the Orsini divisional patent exists would be within . . . (its) sound discretion."" Ethicon 
renewed its motion for summary judgment in 1975, at which time the district court granted the motion in part and denied it in 
part.  Handgards, Inc. v. Johnson & Johnson, 413 F. Supp. 921 (N.D.Cal.1975). The district court's opinion on the motion for 
summary judgment noted the death of any Walker Process allegations, stating that ""Handgards represented at oral argument on 
the motion and in its post-hearing reply memorandum that it was not proceeding as though this case were governed by Walker 
Process Equipment, Inc. v. Food Machinery & Chemical Corp.,"" that the ""abandonment by plaintiff of its primary theory of 
recovery based on the Orsini patent is no surprise,"" that the ""Orsini patent infringement suit was not prosecuted in violation of 
Walker Process,"" and that plaintiff's complaint had never contained a Walker Process allegation regarding the Gerard patent. 
413 F. Supp. at 923. "
527,8," In its 1972 decision on defendant's motion for summary judgment, See note 7 Supra, the district court noted that the failure to 
supply the Patent Office with the information pertaining to the Orsini patent, which already allegedly was part of its files, did not 
constitute fraud on the Patent Office in the Walker Process sense. In its 1975 decision on defendant's motion for summary 
judgment, the district court formally held that Ethicon's ""failure to inform the Patent Office of information in its own files does not 
amount to the extremely circumscribed ""intentional fraud' necessary to prove an action under Walker Process."" 413 F. Supp. at 
923."
527,9," Plaintiffs argued that the Gerard and Orsini patents were known by Ethicon to be invalid because they claimed: (1) a Mr. Babb 
had testified that Gerard had told him that he knew the Gerard patent was invalid; (2) evidence had been introduced suggesting 
that Ethicon knew of Shabram's invalidating prior public use; (3) evidence had been introduced suggesting (a) that Ethicon knew 
that Gerard's invention had been ""on sale"" more than one year prior to the date of the filing of the patent application within the 
meaning of 35 U.S.C. ยง 102(b) and (b) that Ethicon's patent attorneys knowingly falsified an answer to an interrogatory in the 
prior patent action regarding the ""on sale"" issue; (4) evidence had been introduced suggesting that Ethicon's patent attorneys 
knowingly falsified an answer to an interrogatory in the prior patent action concerning the date on which Gerard's invention had 
been reduced to practice, in an attempt to mislead Handgards' counsel into defending the suit on a more difficult ground; and (5) 
evidence had been introduced suggesting that Ethicon knew the Orsini patent to have been invalid because of its having been 
anticipated or made obvious by a prior patent. "
528,10," The power to exclude, which is the essence of every patent, is monopoly power. Hence, ""(a)ny action to enforce a patent is in 
a very explicit sense ""exclusionary,' both in purpose and, if successful, in effect."" L. Sullivan, Handbook of the Law of Antitrust ยง 
181, at 522 (1977). See P. Areeda & D. Turner, III Antitrust Law P 704a, at 114-15 (1978). The patent laws contemplate ""broad 
criteria of patentability while lodging in the federal courts final authority to (determine patent validity),"" Blonder-Tongue 
Laboratories, Inc. v. University Foundation, 402 U.S. 313, 332, 91 S. Ct. 1434, 1444, 28 L. Ed. 2d 788 (1971); patentees invoke 
that authority by initiating infringement suits to enforce their patents. The antitrust laws on the other hand, proscribe certain types 
of exclusionary conduct that threaten or create monopoly power, including, in at least some situations, the use of vexatious 
litigation. See, e. g., Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States, 410 U.S. 366, 93 S. Ct. 1022, 35 L. Ed. 2d 359, On remand, 360 F. 
Supp. 451 (D.Minn.1973), aff'd mem., 417 U.S. 901, 94 S. Ct. 2594, 41 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1974). It therefore is necessary to reach 
an accommodation between the patent and the antitrust laws whenever antitrust liability is premised on a finding regarding a 
patentee's intent to monopolize or its exercise of exclusionary power. To determine the existence of section 2 liability properly 
requires careful distinctions between lawful patent-related exclusionary conduct or intent and unlawful patent-related 
exclusionary conduct or intent; only unlawful patent-related exclusionary conduct or intent is evidence of an intent to monopolize 
or the exercise of exclusionary conduct within the meaning attributed to section 2. See SCM Corp. v. Xerox Corp., 463 F. Supp. 
983 (D.Conn.1978). The task then, is to ""identify the point at which . . . (an attempt to enforce a patent), always exclusionary in . 
. . (the) literal sense, . . . become(s) so intractable as to warrant its being called exclusionary in the sense relevant to the 
establishment of a Section 2 violation. . . ."" L. Sullivan, Supra, ยง 181, at 522. "
529,11," It is worth emphasizing that the absence of an immunity does not create an antitrust offense. The fact that defendant's 
conduct is not immune from antitrust scrutiny does not satisfy the plaintiff's burden of proving the usual elements of an antitrust 
offense, including significant harm causally related to the conduct. P. Areeda & D. Turner, Supra, I Antitrust Law P 204e2. See California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508, 92 S. Ct. 609, 30 L. Ed. 2d 642 (1972); Otter Tail Power 
Co. v. United States, 410 U.S. 366, 93 S. Ct. 1022, 35 L. Ed. 2d 359, On remand, 360 F. Supp. 451 (D.Minn.1973), aff'd mem., 
417 U.S. 901, 94 S. Ct. 2594, 41 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1974); Franchise Realty Interstate Corp. v. San Francisco Local Joint Executive 
Board of Culinary Workers, 542 F.2d 1076 (9th Cir. 1976), Cert. denied, 430 U.S. 940, 97 S. Ct. 1571, 51 L. Ed. 2d 787 (1977)."
529,12," Subjecting a potential rival or actual rival to . . . (the burden of defending an infringement suit) may weaken him or even 
dissuade him from beginning or continuing the rivalry with the monopolist-patentee and perhaps without regard to the merits of 
the infringement claim. P. Areeda & D. Turner, Supra, III Antitrust Law P 708, at 145. See generally L. Sullivan, Supra, ยง 181; Stedman, Supra, at 593-
94."
529,13," HN2[
] An antitrust plaintiff pursuing a bad faith patent prosecution theory must still prove the other requisites of a ยง 2 offense. In Walker Process the Supreme Court emphasized the need to demonstrate the patentee's possession of exclusionary 
power within the relevant market before antitrust liability would result. To establish monopolization or attempt to monopolize a part of trade or commerce under ยง 2 of the Sherman Act (on a Walker 
Process theory), it would . . . be necessary to appraise the exclusionary power of the illegal patent claim in terms of the relevant 
market for the product involved. Without a definition of that market there is no way to measure . . . (defendant's) ability to lessen 
or destroy competition. It may be that the (patented) device . . . does not comprise a relevant market. There may be effective 
substitutes for the device which do not infringe the patent. This is a matter of proof, as is the amount of damages . . . ."
529,382," U.S. at 177-78, 86 S. Ct. at 350-51. We note the existence of a jury finding in this case that the relevant market consisted of the market of heat-sealed plastic gloves 
sold to manufacturers of home hair care coloring kits, or the home hair care plastic disposable glove market; a market 
coterminous with that covered by the Gerard patent. In view of that finding, Ethicon's prosecution of a bad faith infringement 
action likely would constitute an attempt to monopolize violative of section 2. The requisite intent to monopolize in this case 
could be inferred from the finding of bad faith. Not all bad faith infringement actions will necessarily constitute attempts to 
monopolize violative of section 2. Nor will a patentee found guilty of prosecuting an infringement action in bad faith necessarily 
be guilty of an offense of monopolization. The imposition of antitrust liability will depend upon plaintiff's proof that the defendant-
patentee possessed or threatened to possess an ability to lessen competition in the relevant market. "
530,14," The issue in Rex Chainbelt was whether Harco could recover attorneys' fees incurred in its successful defense of a patent 
infringement suit as damages resulting from an antitrust violation by Rex Chainbelt. After studying the Report of the Attorney 
General's National Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws 247-48 (1955) and a line of cases highlighted by Kobe, supra and 
Ansul Co. v. Uniroyal, Inc., 448 F.2d 872 (2d Cir. 1971), Cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1018, 92 S. Ct. 680, 30 L. Ed. 2d 666 (1972), 
we concluded that ""(t)he mere coincidence of an antitrust violation (an illegal tying arrangement) and a patent infringement suit is 
not sufficient to entitle Harco to attorney's fees expended in defense of the patent infringement claim absent some showing from 
which the . . . court can find or infer, that The patent infringement suit was brought in furtherance and as an integral part of a 
plan to violate the antitrust laws."" 512 F.2d at 1005-06 (emphasis added)."
530,15," The district court instructed the jury on both the ""bad faith"" and ""overall scheme"" theories, stating that ""(the prosecution) of 
one or more ill-founded patent infringement actions in bad faith . . . constitutes an antitrust violation in and of itself if such suits 
are initiated or pursued with an intent to monopolize a particular market or industry,"" Reporter's Transcript at 2134, and that ""if . . 
. the lawsuits instituted by Ethicon against plaintiff were brought or maintained in whole or in part to further a plan or a scheme . . 
. to monopolize . . . or in furtherance of a conspiracy or combination to monopolize or restrain trade . . . (then) the institution and 
maintenance of these suits violate the antitrust laws, even though the defendants may actually have believed that the . . . 
patents were valid, and even though the defendants believed that Handgards had infringed these patents."" Id. at 2151. The court 
defined ""bad faith"" in this context as ""knowing either at the time the lawsuit is filed or during its pendency that the particular 
patent sued upon is invalid."" Id. at 2134. Proof of bad faith, the court charged, must be shown by a preponderance of the 
evidence, which it described as proof that the proposition is ""more likely true than not true."" Id. at 2095. The district court summarized the evidence pertaining to the overall scheme for the jury as follows: . . . (Under) the overall scheme theory, the plaintiffs contend that the defendants accumulated numerous patents on plastic 
gloves to prevent competition; that they threatened to sue manufacturers, or purchasers, of allegedly infringing gloves, and 
misused the Gerard patent. To support this claim, the plaintiff introduced Gerard's letter to Sam Porter, claiming that anyone manufacturing gloves on paper 
was in violation of his patent, and was subject to suit for patent infringement. "
531,," The plaintiff also presented the testimony of Mr. Webbe regarding the difficulty that Handgards encountered obtaining financing 
for its operations. Mr. Campbell, a past employee of Glore Forgan, also testified that his company would not become involved in underwriting the 
sale of Handgards' stock, because of the pendency of the infringement suit. Mr. Webbe also testified as to the reluctance of Sam Porter to enter into a joint venture because of the pending suit. And Porter, 
similarly, testified regarding his concern over the infringement action. The defendants presented the following evidence to refute the plaintiff's claim that the patent suits were brought as part of an 
overall scheme to monopolize. Messrs. Laff and Neuman both testified that the patent actions were filed against Plasticsmith and Mercury Manufacturing 
because Ethicon was unsure of the relationship between the two companies. Mr. Laff explained that Delaware was chosen as the place to sue, because it was more convenient for Ethicon; and that after the 
court ordered the case transferred to San Francisco, Ethicon did not oppose the consolidation of the lawsuit against Mercury, so 
the action could be tried as one lawsuit. Messrs. Laff and Neuman testified that the lawsuit was begun against Mr. Reidy when it was learned that Mr. Reidy paid for 
some of the accused machines. The evidence shows Ethicon offered Handgards a license under the Gerard patent prior to the lawsuit. Mr. Webbe and Mr. Blatz have testified that in their opinion the license offered was not reasonable, and would have put 
Handgards at a competitive disadvantage. Messrs. Laff, Neuman, and Schlemmer, testified that the letter from Mr. Gerard to Mr. Porter, dated March 16th, 1965, in which 
Mr. Gerard enclosed a copy of his patent, did not constitute a misuse of the Gerard patent. The evidence shows that as of at least the date of that letter, all disposable plastic gloves purchased by hair care kit companies 
were manufactured under the Gerard process. Mr. Gerard and Mr. Porter testified that the letter was sent at the specific request of Mr. Porter. Messrs. Laff, Neuman, and Schlemmer testified that no one except a manufacturer of gloves could have been sued under the 
Gerard patent, which was the sole object of that letter. Id. at 2114-16. As we indicated in the text, our review of the record convinces us that only the bad faith theory of recovery exists in this case. 
The evidence of an overall scheme to monopolize the relevant market constitutes substantially the same evidence relied upon to 
show Ethicon's alleged bad faith prosecution conduct. If this evidence, under the instructions our opinion requires, should fail to 
support the bad faith theory, it should not be sufficient to support the overall scheme theory. To hold otherwise would undercut 
the protections we here seek to afford the ordinary patentee. For this reason we are unable to affirm the judgment below on the 
basis of the jury's finding that an overall scheme existed. It is unnecessary for us to address explicitly the issue whether the trial 
court erred in charging the jury on two theories. It is enough to point out that if on retrial the evidence remains substantially the 
same, the charge to the jury should reflect only the bad faith theory. We express no opinion on the type of additional evidence 
that would require an overall scheme charge.  Kobe, Inc. v. Dempsey Pump Co., 198 F.2d 416 (10th Cir.), Cert. denied, 344 
U.S. 837, 73 S. Ct. 46, 97 L. Ed. 651 (1952) is the archetype, however."
531,16," Judge Kennedy's opinion, concurring in the result and qualifiedly concurring in the majority's opinion, suggests that defendant 
Ethicon may have available on remand the ""immunity"" afforded by Franchise Realty. Our opinion treats ""infringement actions 
initiated and conducted in bad faith,"" established in the manner we require, as violative of Section 2 of the antitrust law. When "
532,," so established, it would be strange to then hold that nonetheless a Franchise Realty immunity might exist. In any event, this is 
an issue that the present record does not require us to address. "
534,17," We note that substantial disincentives to instigating ill-founded patent infringement suits that are not actionable under the 
standard of antitrust liability announced today already exist. For example, the patent laws contain a specific remedy for 
prosecution in bad faith.  35 U.S.C. ยง 285; the rule of collateral estoppel announced in Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc. v. 
University Foundation, 402 U.S. 313, 91 S. Ct. 1434, 28 L. Ed. 2d 788 (1972) serves to dissuade ill-founded patent infringement 
suits; and nothing appears to preclude a successful defendant in an infringement action from bringing a common law malicious 
prosecution claim. Moreover, this opinion does not limit any antitrust liability that a patentee may incur for conduct actionable 
under an overall scheme or Walker Process theory. "
535,1," Defendant's position on this appeal was that antitrust claims based on the prior bringing of infringement actions differ from 
other kinds of antitrust suits based on alleged abuse of the judicial system. It expressly declined to rely on California Motor, 
stating in its brief: ""The only relevance of California Motor Transport, which had nothing to do with patents, is its explicit 
reaffirmation by the Supreme Court of Walker Process as the applicable standard of fraud in connection with a ยง 2 case charging 
enforcement of invalid patents."" Appellant's Brief at 27. Instead, defendants argued that this case was governed by Walker 
Process. They claimed plaintiff should have been required to prove common law intentional fraud, not merely bad faith, and that 
the standard of proof should have been clear and convincing instead of a preponderance of the evidence. Their second 
argument is adopted in Judge Sneed's opinion. "
540,1," As pertinent here, Art. I, ยง 19, of the Constitution of Tennessee provides: ""That the printing presses shall be free to every person to examine the proceedings of the Legislature; or of any branch or 
officer of the government, and no law shall ever be made to restrain the right thereof.  The free communication of thoughts 
and opinions, is one of the invaluable rights of man, and every citizen may freely speak, write, and print on any subject, 
being responsible for the abuse of that liberty."" Art. I, ยง 22, of the Constitution of Tennessee provides: ""That perpetuities and monopolies are contrary to the genius of a free State, and shall not be allowed."" "
541,2," Of course, HN6[
] freedom of the press, like other freedoms, is not absolute.  Thus, the constitutional rights of others, such as 
the right to equal treatment under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, require the recognition of narrow 
exceptions to the otherwise complete freedom of the publisher to publish or refuse to publish as he pleases.  See, Pittsburgh 
Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Com'n on Human Rel., 413 U.S. 376, 93 S. Ct. 2553, 37 L. Ed. 2d 669 (1973); United States v. Hunter, 
459 F.2d 205 (4th Cir. 1972); Civil Rights Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. ยง 3604(c).  Nor does freedom of the press authorize the 
newspaper to ""attempt to monopolize"" in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.  Lorain Journal Co. v. United States, 342 U.S. 
143, 72 S. Ct. 181, 96 L. Ed. 162 (1951)."
541,3," Since both parties and both lower courts have treated the case as one alleging a violation of the Federal antitrust laws, we 
confine our discussion to that theory and do not determine whether the anti-monopoly provision of Art. I, ยง 22, of the Constitution 
of Tennessee is self executing and may furnish the basis for a civil action by one who claims that another has violated that 
provision.  See, The Charles River Bridge v. The Warren River Bridge et al., 36 U.S. 420, 11 Pet. 420, 9 L. Ed. 773 (1837); 
Leeper v. State, 103 Tenn. 500, 53 S.W. 962 (1899); 58 C.J.S. Monopolies ยงยง 1, 27 (1948). "
546,1," All counts of plaintiffs' complaint relating to defendants City and Board were decided by the trial court; therefore, the one final 
judgment rule permits this appeal.  (6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Pt. I, ยง 42, p. 4057.) Summary judgment for defendants was granted as to the third cause of action; however, this decision is not being appealed.  
The second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh causes of action do not run against the City or the Board and are therefore 
irrelevant to this appeal. The portion of this action concerning Westgate California Corporation, Yellow Cab Company and Charles O'Connor were stayed 
by pending bankruptcy proceedings; as a result of these proceedings, the action against Yellow Cab was dismissed without 
prejudice. "
547,2, The District Attorney filed a written brief on appeal.  Intervener adopts and joins in all arguments in District Attorney's brief.
547,3," An amicus curiae brief filed on behalf of Consumers Union of United States, Inc. and the Gray Panthers of San Francisco takes 
essentially the same position as plaintiffs. "
549,4," The internal reasoning of Widdows appears to us to be inconsistent.  After determining that municipalities do not come within 
the definition of ""persons,"" the court writes: ""The city . . . made no contract or agreement and entered into no conspiracy in 
restraint of trade or to establish monopoly, but imposed the restraint as an act of government which the Cartwright Act did not 
undertake to prohibit."" (P. 235.) Implicit in this language is the concept that a city is liable under the Cartwright Act if its actions 
are not characterized as an act of government.  This is not consistent with its earlier holding that cities are not ""persons"" and are 
not subject to Cartwright Act restrictions. "
550,5," Plaintiffs rely on article XII, section 9, of the 1974 amendment, which reads: ""The provisions of this article restate all related 
provisions of the Constitution in effect immediately prior to the effective date of this amendment and make no substantive 
change."" "
569,1," .  Mr. Ziegler, the President of the National Hockey League, testified concerning the objectives the National Hockey League's 
version of the reserve system is designed to serve.  According to Ziegler, the reserve system prevents deterioration in 
competitive balance among the NHL teams, thereby allowing the presentation of an attractive form of competitive entertainment.  
We note, however, the effectiveness of a reserve system in preserving competitive athletic balance depends in great measure 
upon its restraint of the free market forces that would otherwise control player movement within the sports league. Historically 
and continuing to the present day, professional sports leagues have employed various forms of the reserve system.  See, e.g., 
Flood v. Kuhn, 407 U.S. 258, 259 n. 1, 92 S. Ct. 2099, 32 L. Ed. 2d 728 (1972) (baseball); Smith v. Pro-Football, Inc., 193 U.S. 
App. D.C. 19, 593 F.2d 1173 (1978) (football); and Robertson v. National Basketball Ass'n., 389 F. Supp. 867, 874 
(S.D.N.Y.1975) (basketball)."
569,2," .  Paragraph 17 describes a player's rights and duties upon the expiration of the term of his contract.  In relevant part, Paragraph 
17 states: (a) The Club may no later than August 10th of the final year of this contract, tender the Player a Player's Termination Contract 
and notify him that he has the choice of executing said Player's Termination Contract and delivering it to the Club on or before 
September 10th of that year or automatically being unconditionally released from any further obligation to provide services under 
this contract as of midnight, September 10th of that year.  The Player's Termination Contract shall be on the same terms and 
conditions as this contract except that it shall be for only one additional season at the Player's previous year's salary and shall 
provide for the Player's unconditional release from any further obligation to provide services under said Player's Termination 
Contract effective the following June 1st. (b) If the Club does not take the action permitted under subsection(a), it shall no later than September 1st of the final year of this 
contract (August 10th if the Player is a ""protected"" player or played at least fifty NHL games in the preceding season), tender the 
Player a new Standard Player's Contract upon the same terms and conditions (including this Section 17) as this Standard 
Player's Contract except that salary and the number of years of its fixed term may be different. (c) Without regard to any action taken by the Club under subsections (a) or (b), the Player may notify the Club no later than 
September 10th of the final year of this contract that he wishes to sign a Player's Option Contract.  If the Player gives such 
notice, the Club shall no later than September 25th of that year tender the Player a Player's Option Contract, and the Player 
shall forthwith enter into said contract.  The Player's Option Contract shall be on the same terms and conditions as this contract 
except that it shall be for only one additional season at the Player's previous year's salary and shall provide that effective the 
following June 1st the Player will be a free agent, without any further obligation to provide services under said Player's Option "

on the reverse side hereof, to negotiate and contract with any club in the League, or with any other club. (d) If the Club does not take the action permitted under subsection (a) and the Player does not give notice to the Club in 
accordance with subsection (c), then the parties shall enter into a new Standard Player's Contract by mutual agreement or, 
failing such agreement, the parties shall enter into a new one-year Standard Player's Contract for the succeeding season upon 
the same terms and conditions (including this Section 17) as this Standard Player's Contract, except as to salary, which shall be 
determined by neutral arbitration under the applicable collective bargaining agreement providing a mechanism for such 
arbitration, provided, however, that if no such collective bargaining agreement is then in effect, the Player's salary shall be the 
same as his salary for the previous year. Paragraph 18 goes further.  By Paragraph 18, the parties ""mutually promise and agree to be legally bound by the Constitution 
and By-Laws of the League and by all the terms and provisions thereof . . . ."""
570,3," .  Section 9.03, in part, provides: (a) Each hockey player employed by each Club in the National Hockey League shall enter into the form of Standard Players

it has been duly authorized to collectively agree to paragraph 17 of the Standard Players Contract . . .  and to the applicability of 
the provisions of Section 9A of the National Hockey League By-Laws as fair and reasonable terms of employment . . . . The Association hereby so agrees in its capacity as the exclusive bargaining representative of hockey players in the National 
Hockey League under this Agreement."
570,4," .  McCourt has claimed that the Red Wings admitted that his contract included an unwritten understanding with the club that he 
would not be involuntarily traded.  Nevertheless, his contract provided, in Paragraph 11: It is mutually agreed that the Club shall have the right to sell, assign, exchange and transfer this contract, and to loan the 
Player's services to any other professional hockey club, and the Player agrees to accept and be bound by such sale, exchange, 
assignment, transfer or loan, and will faithfully perform and carry out this contract with the same purpose and effect as if it had 
been entered into by the Player and such other Club . . . . If the Player fails to report to such other Club he may be suspended by such other club and no salary shall be payable to him 
during the period of such suspension . . . . The testimony was that such side agreements were not infrequent, but that any contract which formally incorporates a no-trade 
provision would automatically be rejected by the Commissioner.  This is obviously true, since By-Law Section 9A.8(d), 
incorporated in McCourt's contract by Paragraphs 17 and 18, specifically provided that the contracts of all players under an 
acquiring club at the time a free agent is acquired shall be available for equalization purposes.  The breach of contract counts 
have not as yet been decided below or appealed to this court. "
571,5," .  Three other counts in the complaint asserting state contract and antitrust claims and one count alleging a violation of the U.S. 
Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. ยง 1 Et seq. (1976), are not the subject of this appeal."
571,6," .  The defendants brought this appeal from the issuance of the preliminary injunction. Following oral argument, the parties filed a 
stipulation stating: It is hereby stipulated by and between all the parties to this action: (1) that all parties waive their rights to a trial on the merits of 
this action as to Count I of plaintiff's Complaint; (2) that the record and the oral and written findings of fact and conclusions of law 
now before this Court, which were developed at the hearing on plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction, shall be deemed to 
constitute the final record and findings of fact and conclusions of law after a trial on the merits as to such Count I; (3) that the 
appeals filed by defendants under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1292(a)(1) from the order granting a preliminary injunction may be treated by this 
Court as appeals, under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1291, from a final decision of the District Court and (4) that plaintiff may renew his 
remaining claims following this appeal. "
572,7," .  Jacobs and Winter, in Antitrust Principles and Collective Bargaining by Athletes: Of Superstars in Peonage, 81 Yale L.J. 1 
(1971), strongly suggest that the antitrust issue is altogether irrelevant in considering the validity of the reserve system.  This 
article and its conclusion were specifically noted, without comment, by Mr. Justice Blackmun in Flood v. Kuhn, supra. In 
Radovich v. National Football League, 352 U.S. 445, 77 S. Ct. 390, 1 L. Ed. 2d 456 (1957), the Supreme Court reversed the 
dismissal of a complaint charging Sherman Act violations by the National Football League and in so doing held that a complaint 
by a former guard on the Detroit Lions team charging that the National Football League had boycotted him and prevented him 
from becoming a player-coach in the Pacific Coast League, adequately stated a cause of action under the antitrust laws. A 
majority of the Court made it clear that while Radovich was entitled to an opportunity to prove his charges, it expressed no 
opinion as to whether or not the respondents had in fact violated the antitrust laws. The precise language of the reserve system 
provisions does not appear to have been considered by the Supreme Court in Radovich, its emphasis rather having been to hold 
that its prior decisions relating to the game of baseball did not invariably apply to all team sports. Lower court activity has almost 
uniformly indicated that the restraints of the reserve system in sports other than baseball amount to a type of group boycott 
against a player who desires to sell his professional athletic services to another team after having earlier been engaged by a

and the representative of the employees to meet at reasonable times and confer in good faith with respect to wages, hours, and 
other terms and conditions of employment, or the negotiation of an agreement, or any question arising thereunder, and the 
execution of a written contract incorporating any agreement reached if requested by either party, but Such obligation does not

return for many player benefits.  In addition to the benefits described in the district judge's opinion, our review of the record 
indicates that the players bargained for substantial benefits: (1) increased pension benefits; (2) increased bonus money to 
players on teams finishing high in their divisions and participating in the Stanley Cup Playoffs; (3) sharing with the owners 
receipts from international hockey games; (4) greater salary continuation for players injured as a result of playing hockey; (5)

or its agreement contained in this Section 9.03 with respect to the said paragraph 17, . . .  and the said Section 9A upon written 
notice to the Clubs within 15 days after notice of said agreement to merge.  If the Association elects to terminate as provided in 
the preceding sentence, the subjects covered by the said termination shall then be reopened for collective bargaining at the 
request of either party. (e) The parties hereto recognize that recent court decisions affecting professional sports other than hockey, may give rise to 
uncertainty as to whether the provisions of Paragraph 17 of the Standard Players Contract . . .  and Section 9A of the National 
Hockey League By-Laws are lawful subjects of collective bargaining. The Association further recognizes that the provisions of 
this agreement beneficial to the Association and the (sic) the players were entered into by both parties in the good faith belief 
that subparagraphs (a) and (b) above are lawful subjects of collective bargaining and are valid, and that the Clubs agreed to said 
beneficial provisions in reliance thereon.  In the event of a final judicial determination not subject to appeal that Paragraph 17 of 
the Standard Players Contract . . .  or Section 9A of the National Hockey League By-Laws are not lawful subjects of collective 
bargaining or are otherwise invalid, the Clubs may within 30 days thereafter terminate this Collective Bargaining Agreement

600,3," While the primary objective of patent law is the public benefit, Rep. Att'y Gen. Nat'l Comm. to Study Antitrust Laws 224 (1955), 
it remains generally true that "". . .  whilst the remuneration of genius and useful ingenuity is a duty incumbent upon the public, 
the rights and welfare of the community must be fairly dealt with and effectually guarded.  Considerations of individual 
emolument can never be permitted to operate to the injury of these.  * * * "" (Footnote omitted).  Id. citing Kendall v. Winsor, 62

resale price maintenance is also a Per se violation.  R. Posner, Supra, at 155-56.  Colgate has been traditionally criticized on the 
grounds that it weakens the Per se prohibition against resale price maintenance first enunciated in Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John

602,5," The Karseal court also reaffirmed the ""target area"" doctrine as to proximate cause in an antitrust injury: the rule is that one who is only Incidentally injured by a violation of the antitrust laws, the bystander who was hit but not aimed at, 
cannot recover against the violator.  Loeb v. Eastman Kodak Co., 3 Cir. 1910, 183 F. 704; Gerli v. Silk Ass'n of America,

602,6," This issue will be treated in considerable detail in the discussion of antitrust standing, Infra. "
603,7," At issue here obviously is the difficulty in assessing both the costs of arriving at an invention and the means of providing an 
appropriate return on the investment undertaken.  This problem is complicated whenever a vital product is discovered by 
accident or as a spin-off from research designed to produce something completely different.  For an example involving ""teflon"" 
see W. S. Bowman, Jr., Patent and Antitrust Law: A Legal and Economic Appraisal 39 (1973). "
604,8," Section 2 of the Sherman Act reads as follows: Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to 
monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a 
misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding fifty thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not 
exceeding one year, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court."
604,9," The evidence consisted of portions of the depositions of various officials from Ford and GM, including Messrs. Desmarais, 
Cook, and Fisher who were intimately involved in or knowledgeable about the automakers' patent licensing policies, as well as 
licensing agreements, correspondence, and an internal Ford Supply Manual outlining the procedures for negotiation of license "
605,," agreements.  The highlighted portions of these documents demonstrate the existence of the policy but do not indicate the 
presence of a conspiracy. "
607,10," In their briefs, both sides have addressed the various issues raised in this case which are similar to those presented in Illinois 
Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977). Illinois Brick held that the pass-on theory, rejected as 
a proper defense in Hanover Shoe, supra, could not be asserted offensively by an indirect purchaser (plaintiff) against an 
alleged violator (defendant).  431 U.S. at 726, 97 S. Ct. 2061. In rejecting the offensive use of passing-on, the court noted that to 
do otherwise would be to run the risk of duplicative recoveries as well as to complicate the ""evidentiary complexities and 
uncertainties"" involved in proving an offense.  431 U.S. at 732, 97 S. Ct. 2061. With regard to the enforcement policies of the 
antitrust laws implicated by restricting recovery to direct purchasers only, the court said: (w)e understand Hanover Shoe as resting on the judgment that the antitrust laws will be more effectively enforced by 
concentrating the full recovery for the overcharge in the direct purchasers rather than by allowing every plaintiff potentially 
affected by the overcharge to sue only for the amount it could show was absorbed by it."
607,431," U.S. at 734, 97 S. Ct. at 2069. [***473]  On its face, although the court specifically stated that the outcome did not turn on the matter of standing, 431 U.S. at 
728 n.7, 97 S. Ct. 2061, Illinois Brick appears relevant to the instant case, especially as a precedent for defendants.  Plaintiffs 
would minimize its impact by referring to the possibility of Congressional modifications, while defendants cite it but without fully 
or precisely explaining its relevance.  Here, what is being passed-on is lower prices rather than higher ones, and unlike the 
Illinois Brick situation, recovery would not be concentrated on the intermediate party (I. e., the licensees) since that party has 
accepted the royalty-free policy.  This Court notes the relevance of Illinois Brick in light of what may be called the ""pass-back"" 
present in this case.  Since the presence of a patent context is vital to understanding the relevant antitrust policies to be applied 
in this oligopsony context, the value of Illinois Brick as a precedent must await further clarification by the Supreme Court.  The 
standing tests considered Infra are sufficient to dispose of the issues presented in this case, and the Court is mindful of the 
Supreme Court's distinction that ""the question of which persons have been injured by an illegal overcharge (read ""undercharge"" 
here) for purposes of ยง 4 is analytically distinct from the question of which persons have sustained injuries too remote to give 
them standing to sue for damages under ยง 4."" 431 U.S. at 728, n.7, 97 S. Ct. at 2066, n.7. "

609,12," The In re Multidistrict Court provided a summary as to how the various circuits had approached this analysis: We do not mean to imply that each circuit falls neatly into one of the two pigeonholes.  Only the Eighth Circuit and ours, for 
example, have consistently followed the ""target area"" approach, E.g., Mulvey v. Samuel Goldwyn Productions, 433 F.2d 1073 
(9th Cir. 1970); Sanitary Milk Producers v. Bergjans Farm Dairy, Inc., 368 F.2d 679, 688-689 (8th Cir. 1966) (Blackmun, J.), and 
even they have diverged occasionally.  E.g., Perkins v. Standard Oil Co., supra, note 6 (396 F.2d 809 (9th Cir. 1968)). The "
610,," First, Third, Sixth and Tenth Circuits on the other hand, generally apply the test we label ""direct injury."" E.g., Reibert v. Atlantic 
Richfield Co., 471 F.2d 727 (10th Cir. 1973); Kauffman v. Dreyfus Fund, 434 F.2d 727, 732-734 (3d Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401 
U.S. 974, 91 S. Ct. 1190, 28 L. Ed. 2d 323 (1971); Volasco Products Co. v. Lloyd A. Fry Roofing Co., 308 F.2d 383, 394-395 
(6th Cir. 1962); Miley v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., 148 F. Supp. 299 (D.Mass.), aff'd Per curiam, 242 F.2d 758 (1st Cir.), 
cert. denied, 355 U.S. 828, 78 S. Ct. 38, 2 L. Ed. 2d 41 (1957). The Second, Fourth and Fifth Circuits have formulated their own 
particular mixtures of the two tests, E.g., Calderone Enterprises Corp. v. United Artists Theatre Circuit, Inc., 454 F.2d 1292 (2d 
Cir. 1971); Dailey v. Quality School Plan, Inc., 380 F.2d 484 (5th Cir. 1967); South Carolina Council of Milk Producers, Inc. v. 
Newton, 360 F.2d 414 (4th Cir. 1966), although the approach of the Second more closely resembles the ""direct injury"" test and 
that of the Fourth and Fifth, the test of ""target area"".  The Seventh Circuit's approach is uncertain, although it appears closer to 
""target area"".  Compare Sandidge v. Rogers, 256 F.2d 269 (7th Cir. 1958) With Congress Building Corp. v. Loew's, Inc., 246 
F.2d 587 (7th Cir. 1957). In ascribing positions to the various circuits, we have ignored self-descriptions and have attempted to 
analyze their actual approaches."
610,481," F.2d at 127, n.7. "
611,13," The Court also considered standing under ยง 16 of the Clayton Act: Any person, firm, corporation, or association shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief, in any court of the United 
States having jurisdiction over the parties, against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws . . .  when and 
under the same conditions and principles as injunctive relief against threatened conduct that will cause loss or damage is 
granted by courts of equity, under the rules governing such proceedings . . . ."
611,15, U.S.C. ยง 26. 
612,14," The Fifth Circuit has developed a two-step approach for focusing on the affected area of the economy.  Yoder Bros. v. 
California-Florida Plant Corp., 537 F.2d 1347 (5th Cir. 1976), Cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1094, 97 S. Ct. 1108, 51 L. Ed. 2d 540 
(1977). See also Hardwick v. Nu-Way Oil Co., 443 F. Supp. 940, 944 (S.D.Tex.1978): First, the affected area of the economy must be identified.  Second, the court must determine whether the claimed injury 
occurred within that area.  Yoder Bros. v. California-Florida Plant Corp., 537 F.2d 1347, 1360 (5th Cir. 1976) (citing In Re 
Multidistrict Vehicle Air Pollution M. D. L. No. 31, 481 F.2d 122, 129 (9th Cir. 1973), Cert. denied Morgan v. Automobile Mfgrs. 
Ass'n, 414 U.S. 1045, 94 S. Ct. 551, 38 L. Ed. 2d 336). "
614,15," The court cited approvingly the following passage from the Ninth Circuit's opinion in Conference of Studio Unions v. Loew's, 
Inc., 193 F.2d 51, 55 (9th Cir. 1951): Such a construction is in accordance with the basic and underlying purposes of the anti-trust laws to preserve competition and to 
protect the consumer.  Recovery and damages under the anti-trust law is available to those who have been directly injured by 
the lessening of competition and withheld from those who seek the windfall of treble damages because of incidental harm. "
617,16," The quotation is from Mr. Justice Rehnquist's opinion in Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U.S. 723, 95 S. Ct. 
1917, 44 L. Ed. 2d 539 (1975), in which the Court upheld the Birnbaum rule limiting private damages for violations of rule 10b-5, 
17 C.F.R. ยง 240.10b-5 (1975), to purchasers and sellers of securities.  Although the context of private antitrust litigation 
obviously differs from that presented in Blue Chip Stamps, the analogy is a fitting one since it indicates that policy considerations 
frequently shape a court's evaluation of standing arguments.  The Birnbaum rule had, in fact, been criticized as being ""an 
arbitrary restriction which unreasonably prevents some deserving plaintiffs from recovering damages which have in fact been 
caused by violations of Rule 10b-5."" Id. at 738, 95 S. Ct. at 1926. The Court went on to hold that such a limitation was based on 
""countervailing"" policy considerations.  Id. at 739, 95 S. Ct. 1917."
617,17," The court proceeds to define a target as ""a person or business against which competitive aim is taken.  The line is clearly 
drawn by requiring that to have standing one must be an object of an antitrust conspiracy."" 454 F.2d at 1296 n. 2. "
619,18," Some of the factors to be considered in such negotiations are: the patent's strength, availability of competing technology, the 
cost to develop the invention, the savings (or profit) to be realized, the cost of the suit, the nature of the license, negotiation 
costs, the costs of assembling concomitant technical information for the licensee, costs of servicing the agreement, and the 
licensee's investment.  T. Costner, Supra, at ยง 3.01. "
620,19," See comment by J. G. Van Cise, Supra. "
628,1," .  Connecticut also suggests that the facts pleaded would support a claim for violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices 
Act, Conn.Gen.Stat. ยง 42-110a Et seq., and of various common law standards.  Nevertheless Connecticut prefers to stand or fall 
on its state antitrust law claim, an election specified on the face of the complaint.  Cf.  Minkoff v. Scranton Frocks, Inc., 172 F. 
Supp. 870, 873 n. 4 (S.D.N.Y.1959). "
629,2," .  It is not clear whether the courts that view preemption as a defense and therefore leave the pleader of a preempted state law 
claim to proceed (to defeat) in state court would permit the pleader to file a new suit based on the preempting federal law either 
in state court, from which it would clearly be removable, or directly in federal court.  If the claim can be refiled as a federal claim, 
it seems pointless to remand the losing state law claim. On the other hand, if these courts would hold the pleader to have split 
his cause of action and would consider the adverse ruling on the state law claim as Res judicata with respect to a subsequent 
allegation of the same facts as a federal law claim, then a remand, though harsh, is at least dispositive."
629,3," .  A difference in remedies available under state and federal law is not necessarily a conflict resulting in preemption. See Ohio 
ex rel. Brown v. Klosterman French Baking Co., (1977-1) Trade Cases (CCH) P 61,361 (S.D.Ohio 1976) (four-year statute of 
limitations for federal antitrust claims does not preempt longer state statute of limitations and damage period).  Thus, the fact 
that a federal Parens patriae remedy is available only for events after the Hart-Scott-Rodino amendments came into effect in 
October, 1976, See Pub.L.No.94-435, ยง 301, 90 Stat. 1394-95 (1976), does not automatically preclude a more severely 
retroactive application of the Connecticut Parens patriae statute, Conn.Gen.Stat. ยง 35-32, if that law is construed to differ from 
federal law. "
631,4," .  It would be equally inappropriate, and unavailing, for this Court to proceed with construction of the state statute. If this Court 
construed state law to be constitutional, a remand to proceed under valid state law would occur.  If this Court found state law, as 
construed, unconstitutional, the plaintiff's available claim under federal antitrust law would still not be within the removal 
jurisdiction of this Court, because of Lambert Run. Moreover, any constitutional objection to the validity of the state statute is technically a matter of defense, which traditionally 
cannot be used as the basis for federal question jurisdiction.  Louisiana & Nashville Railroad v. Mottley, 211 U.S. 149, 29 S. Ct. 
42, 53 L. Ed. 126 (1908). A federal court's disregarding the defensive nature of the contention that the state law is 
unconstitutional, and adjudicating that question before the state court has a chance to do so, would propel it into adjudication not 
only of the constitutional issue but also, preliminarily, of the contours of the state statute. This is a further reason not to rest 
federal question jurisdiction on what is in essence a defense contention. The danger of anticipatory federal court construction of a state statute does not normally arise in cases involving statutory 
preemption. In those cases the issue is typically whether federal law has filled the field; the focus of inquiry is on the reach and 
effect of the federal statute, and construction of state statutes is rarely involved.  In such a situation, it may be legitimate for a 
federal court to which a state claim has been removed to adjudicate the contention that state law has been preempted by a 
federal statute, rather than treat preemption as a defense and remit to the state court what is obviously an important federal 
question, even though one that occurs in a suit arguably not arising under federal law."
631,5," .  Although this is a suit between a state and a citizen of another state, it may not be brought under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1251(b)(3).  
That section, giving original but not exclusive jurisdiction of such suits to the Supreme Court, allows for concurrent jurisdiction in 
the district courts.  But it does not confer jurisdiction on those courts.  Ohio v. Wyandotte Chemicals Corp., 401 U.S. 493, 498 
n.3, 91 S. Ct. 1005, 28 L. Ed. 2d 256 (1971); C. Wright, Federal Courts 559 (3d ed. 1976).  A specific statutory basis for district 
court jurisdiction is required, such as the diversity grant of 28 U.S.C. ยง 1332."
631,6," .  Clearly Connecticut would be acting as a sovereign if it were considered to be bringing this suit in its enforcement capacity.  
Access to diversity jurisdiction is not aided by considering Connecticut as representative of a class, even assuming that "
632,," Connecticut could be a member of a consumer class and its adequate representative, with typical claims.  The citizenship of a 
class is determined by the citizenship of its representative, Snyder v. Harris, 394 U.S. 332, 340, 89 S. Ct. 1053, 22 L. Ed. 2d 319 
(1969); Supreme Tribe of Ben Hur v. Cauble, 255 U.S. 356, 41 S. Ct. 338, 65 L. Ed. 673 (1921), and in pressing any claim of its 
own as representative of a class, Connecticut would be acting as a sovereign."
632,7," .  In Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., 405 U.S. 251, 92 S. Ct. 885, 31 L. Ed. 2d 184 (1972), which included a Parens patriae claim 
alleging violations of federal antitrust laws, complaints of injury to the ""general economy"" of the state did not change the nature 
of the claim from one in which the state was really putting forth the claims of many individuals.  Id. at 262-64, 92 S. Ct. 885. The 
subsequently enacted ยง 4C of the Clayton Act, added by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976, Pub.L.No.94-
435, ยง 301, 90 Stat. 1394-95 (1976), now authorizes the attorney general of any state to bring a Parens patriae suit, in the name 
of the state, on behalf of those who have sustained injury through violations of the Sherman Act.  But cf.  Illinois Brick Co. v. 
Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977). A similar provision exists in Connecticut law.  Conn.Gen.Stat. ยง 
35-32.  But those authorizations do not change the nature of the suits. "
643,1," .  Section 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 26, is not specifically cited in the Complaint, but leave to amend the Complaint to 
include this statutory provision as a jurisdictional basis could be granted. HN3[
] Rule 15(a), Fed.R.Civ.P., provides that leave to amend ""shall be freely given when justice so requires."" "
644,2," .  The Court believes that, for similar reasons, the causation requirement under New York State antitrust law is also satisfied in 
this case. The decision in Mobil Oil Corp. v. Rubenfeld, 48 A.D.2d 428, 370 N.Y.S.2d 943 (2d Dept. 1975), Aff'd, 40 N.Y.2d 936, 
390 N.Y.S.2d 57, 358 N.E.2d 882 (1976) is not to the contrary since the court in that case did not find that there was an 
insufficient causal relationship between the landlord's antitrust violations and the tenant's eviction, but rather found that the 
recognition, in those circumstances, of a retaliatory defense would impose a disproportionate penalty upon the landlord whereas 
monetary damages would adequately effectuate the purpose of the antitrust laws. "
645,3," .  Mr. Ransom also said that the proportion of out-of-state as opposed to in-state products purchased for the Northern Lights 
store was probably about the same as that purchased for the other Optivision retail outlets."
645,4," .  Testimony was received at the hearing showing that Optivision accepts credit cards from customers, but the Court does not 
have to consider what significance this might have in establishing the required nexus with interstate commerce, because the 
witness, who was asked this question, was unable to state where the credit card payments came from. "
646,5," .  While there is a sufficient nexus between the complained of conduct and the interstate commerce engaged in by the Northern 
Lights store, there would not be an adequate nexus between the activities in question and the other seventeen retail stores 
owned and operated by Optivision, at least in the absence of proof that Optivision will be driven out of business by the 
defendants' actions. There is no evidence that Optivision as a corporate entity will be so affected."
646,6," .  The purchases which DeWitt makes from out-of-state suppliers could also be considered in determining the substantiality of 
the effect which the complained of conduct has upon interstate commerce, see Harold Friedman Inc. v. Thorofare Markets Inc., 
supra, 587 F.2d at 132-33, but no proof in this regard was introduced at the hearing."
646,7," .  The interstate connections in Mohammad also included very limited payments received from out-of-state insurance companies 
and relatively small amounts spent on interstate travel by the plaintiff's officers or employees."
646,8," .  Since the Court believes that it is likely that the plaintiff will be able to prevail on the ""affecting commerce"" theory, it is 
unnecessary to consider the ""in commerce"" theory. "
648,9," .  In support of its argument that exclusivity clauses are, in essence, sophisticated attempts at price fixing, plaintiff relies upon 
State of Ohio ex rel. Brown v. Zayre of Ohio, Inc., 1974-2 Trade Cases P 75,232 (Ohio Ct.Comm.Pl.Cuyahoga Co.1974). This 
Court notes that while the decision in Zayre discussed federal precedents, it was actually based upon state antitrust law."
648,10," .  HN12[
] An exclusivity clause in a shopping center lease is similar, in many respects, to an exclusive dealing arrangement 
between a manufacturer and a distributor since in both situations ""a business entity in control of a product restrictively selects 
the parties to whom it will sell the commodity."" Harold Friedman Inc. v. Thorofare Markets Inc., supra, 587 F.2d at 142. See also "
649,," Borman's, Inc. v. Great Scott Super Markets, Inc., supra, 433 F. Supp. at 351. Exclusive distributorships between manufacturers 
and sellers have generally been upheld by the courts under the rule of reason. b Oreck Corp. v. Whirlpool Corp., 579 F.2d 126

(S.D.N.Y.1974). "
650,11," .  Mr. Ransom testified that the volume of traffic passing by Northern Lights was significant, but when asked by plaintiff's 
counsel to compare the amount of traffic going by Northern Lights with that on Route 11, he was unable to do so because of his 
lack of familiarity with the area."
650,12, .  There are perhaps thirty or more optical stores in the Greater Syracuse Metropolitan Area.
650,13," .  Of course, when a Per se violation of the Sherman Act has been established, the applicability of the antitrust laws is not 
affected by the fact that only one competitor has been eliminated, Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., supra, but the Court 
has previously indicated that a Per se Approach is not appropriate here. Also, it should be pointed out that Optivision is not being 
completely eliminated as a competitor. It has another retail outlet in the market area a small store adjacent to its factory in 
Liverpool. Moreover, Optivision has four other stores in the Greater Syracuse Metropolitan Area. "
651,14," .  Mr. DeWitt stated that other shopping centers will not put in a second optical store until there are two or three department 
stores. He said that his lease at Penn Can Mall does not contain an exclusivity clause, but does provide him with the first right of 
refusal if a second optical store is to be opened there. It is also noted that there is an exclusivity clause in Optivision's lease 
although Optivision states that, if it is allowed to remain at Northern Lights, it would not seek to enforce this provision."
651,15," .  Mr. Rosenberg testified that he was not aware of exclusivity clauses in any other leases at Northern Lights, but he also said 
that he was not responsible for negotiating provisions of that nature. Such negotiations are apparently conducted directly by the 
landlord."
651,16," .  In view of the vigorous competition in the relevant market and the lack of any other evidence of specific intent, the Court is 
also unwilling to infer specific intent on the part of DeWitt from the fact that DeWitt, in addition to securing an exclusivity clause in 
its Northern Lights lease, has received assurance of the first right of refusal on the leasing of a second optical store in Penn Can 
Mall. "
652,17," .  From the wording of the ยง 2 claim in the Complaint, it is possible that plaintiff may be alleging that defendants' conduct 
constitutes attempted monopolization as well as a conspiracy to monopolize, but a letter sent by plaintiff's counsel to the Court 
after the hearing appears to disclaim this theory. In any event, the Court's discussion of the failure to establish proof of a 
conspiracy to monopolize shows that the two essential elements of an attempt to monopolize specific intent to build a monopoly 
and dangerous probability of success have not been demonstrated in this case. See Buffalo Courier-Express, Inc. v. Buffalo 
Evening News, Inc., 601 F.2d 48, (2d Cir. 1979); Bowen v. New York News, Inc., supra, 522 F.2d at 1252 n. 7."
652,18," .  The Court has pendent jurisdiction over this claim and the other causes of action arising under New York State law. While 
plaintiff has not made a sufficient showing on the merits to be entitled to preliminary injunctive relief on the federal antitrust 
claims, those claims are not properly characterized as wholly insubstantial or patently frivolous. Therefore, the federal causes of 
action form a sufficient basis upon which to predicate pendent jurisdiction over the state claims. See Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 
682-83, 66 S. Ct. 773, 90 L. Ed. 939 (1946); George C. Frey Ready-Mixed Concrete, Inc. v. Pine Hill Concrete Mix Corp., 554 
F.2d 551, 554 n. 3 (2d Cir. 1977). "
654,19," .  At the time of the hearing, the Court reserved decision on the admissibility of Mr. Ransom's letter of August 15, 1978. The 
Court now rules that the letter is admissible to establish the propositions discussed in the text. "
655,20," .  There is a conflict in the testimony as to whether the contact in October, 1978 between Optivision representatives and Mr. 
Rosenberg was in person or by telephone, but it is unnecessary to resolve this conflict."
655,21," .  This is based upon the assumption that the exclusivity clause itself is valid. If the provision were found to be invalid, DeWitt 
presumably would not be able to collect any damages for its breach. "
656,22," .  The causation requirement for tortious interference with pre-contractual relations appears to be more stringent than the 
causation requirement under the antitrust laws. See section I.A. of the text Supra. Thus, it is quite possible that there might be a 
sufficient causal relationship between the activity in question and the asserted injury to establish antitrust standing even though 
there is not a sufficient degree of certainty that plaintiff would have received the contract to establish the tort of intentionally 
interfering with pre-contractual relations. "
657,23," .  The contract with Garfield Construction Company is for $ 17,502, of which $ 2,000 constitutes a down payment and $ 5,000 
represents work already commenced. Thus, Optivision's liability to Garfield will be $ 7,000 plus the construction company's profit 
margin."
657,24," .  The landlord would probably be liable to DeWitt for such lost profits if the validity of the exclusivity clause were upheld and an 
injunction were issued solely on the state law claims."
657,25," .  Defendants contend that since Optivision's lease, as well as the one to which DeWitt is a party, contains an exclusivity 
clause, the doctrines of unclean hands and In pari delicto require the motion for a preliminary injunction to be denied. It is 
unnecessary to consider the extent to which these doctrines might be relevant to a motion for preliminary injunctive relief since 
the Court has determined that an exclusivity clause, in the circumstances presented here, is probably not unlawful. "
675,1," The motion to strike the jury demand was first filed by Mitsubishi Corp. and the Toshiba, Matsushita, and Sony defendants. 
Motorola, Inc., and the Sharp defendants subsequently joined in the motion. The Mitsubishi Electric Corporation (""Melco""), 
Hitachi, Sanyo and Sears defendants have not participated in this motion. Except where the context indicates otherwise, 
""defendants"" will be used herein to mean only the moving defendants."

676,5," This case was transferred to our docket from the docket of Judge A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr., following his elevation to the 
Court of Appeals. Although the progress of the case had been slowed by the illnesses and subsequent deaths of two judges to 
whom the case had previously been assigned, Judge Higginbotham moved the litigation forward vigorously. One of the most 
important events of Judge Higginbotham's stewardship was the filing of an opinion, based on a voluminous record, disposing of 
the defendants' challenges to jurisdiction and venue, and to the constitutionality of the 1916 Antidumping Act. See Zenith Radio 
Corp. v. Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., 402 F. Supp. 251 (E.D.Pa.1975) (opinion on constitutionality of antidumping act);

676,6," Sony Corporation and its sales subsidiary, Sony Corporation of America, were originally named in both suits. However, they 
were dismissed from the Zenith action after settling with Zenith in April, 1977, and are defendants now only in the NUE action. The seven other principal Japanese defendants are named in both actions, as are eight of their subsidiaries: Matsushita Electric 
Corporation of America, Toshiba America, Inc., Hitachi Sales Corporation of Japan, Hitachi Sales Corporation of America, Sharp 
Electronics Corporation, Sanyo Electric, Inc., Sanyo Electric Trading, Inc., and Mitsubishi International Corporation. Sears and Motorola are named only in the Zenith suit, as are Melco Sales, Inc., Sanyo Manufacturing Co., Matsushita 
Electronics Corporation, Matsushita Electric Trading Co., Ltd., and Quasar Electronics Corp., also a Matsushita subsidiary."
676,7," The NUE suit is limited to television receivers; the lines of commerce encompassed in the Zenith complaint also include radios,

same is made by or between two or more persons or corporations, either of whom, as agent or principal, is engaged in importing 
any article from any foreign country into the United States, and when such combination, conspiracy, trust, agreement, or contract 
is intended to operate in restraint of lawful trade, or free competition in lawful trade or commerce, or to increase the market price 
in any part of the United States of any article or articles imported or intended to be imported into the United States, or of any "
677,," manufacture into which such imported article enters or is intended to enter. Every person who shall be engaged in the 
importation of goods or any commodity from any foreign country in violation of this section, or who shall combine or conspire 
with another to violate the same, is guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof in any court of the United States such 
person shall be fined in a sum not less than $ 100 and not exceeding $ 5,000, and shall be further punished by imprisonment, in 
the discretion of the court, for a term not less than three months nor exceeding twelve months."
677,10," ยง 72. Importation or sale of articles at less than market value or wholesale price It shall be unlawful for any person importing or assisting in importing any articles from any foreign country into the United States, 
commonly and systematically to import, sell or cause to be imported or sold such articles within the United States at a price 
substantially less than the actual market value or wholesale price of such articles, at the time of exportation to the United States, 
in the principal markets of the country of their production, or of other foreign countries to which they are commonly exported after 
adding to such market value or wholesale price, freight, duty, and other charges and expenses necessarily incident to the 
importation and sale thereof in the United States: Provided, That such act or acts be done with the intent of destroying or injuring 
an industry in the United States, or of preventing the establishment of an industry in the United States, or of restraining or 
monopolizing any part of trade and commerce in such articles in the United States. Any person who violates or combines or conspires with any other person to violate this section is guilty of a misdemeanor, and, 
on conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $ 5,000, or imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both, in the 
discretion of the court. Any person injured in his business or property by reason of any violation of, or combination or conspiracy to violate, this section, 
may sue therefor in the district court of the United States for the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an 
agent, without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages sustained, and the cost of the suit, 
including a reasonable attorney's fee. The foregoing provisions shall not be construed to deprive the proper State courts of jurisdiction in actions for damages 
thereunder."
677,11," The original complaints included counts alleging that price discrimination between Japanese and American purchasers 
violated the Robinson-Patman Act. These counts were dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.  
Zenith Radio Corp. v. Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., 402 F. Supp. 244 (E.D.Pa.1975) (Higginbotham, J.)."
677,12," Zenith challenges two acquisitions. The first is the 1974 sale by Motorola of its consumer electronic products division and its 
""Quasar"" tradename to Matsushita. The other is the 1976 acquisition by Sanyo of a majority interest in Warwick Electronics, Inc. 
Warwick had manufactured television receivers for sale to U.S. private label customers, the largest of which was Sears. Sears 
owned 25% Of Warwick's common shares, and after the transactions was 25% Owner of Warwick's successor, Sanyo 
Manufacturing Co. (an American corporation). Zenith alleges that Sears has contracted to purchase 70% Of its console color 
television requirements from Sanyo Manufacturing. "
678,13," The counterclaims described in the text are asserted by certain of the Matsushita, Mitsubishi, Hitachi, Sharp, Sanyo, and 
Toshiba defendants. In addition, Sears asserts a counterclaim against Zenith based on the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. ยงยง 1051-
1127."
678,14," The time remaining before trial will be devoted to the disposition of numerous motions for summary judgment, and to the 
preparation by counsel of annotated final pretrial statements setting forth all facts to be proved, and trial briefs."
678,15," We draw much sustenance from the excellent discussions of this problem already extant in the literature. Among the cases 
which we find particularly helpful are Bernstein v. Universal Pictures, Inc., 79 F.R.D. 59 (S.D.N.Y.1978) (Brieant, J.); Radial Lip 
Machine, Inc. v. International Carbide Corp., 76 F.R.D. 224 (N.D.Ill.1977) (Marshall, J.); and In re U.S. Financial Securities 
Litigation, 75 F.R.D. 702 (S.D.Cal.1977) (Turrentine, J.). Of equal value is an article by Judge Patrick Higginbotham, Continuing 
the Dialogue: Civil Juries and the Allocation of Judicial Power, 56 Tex.L.Rev. 47 (1977). "
679,16," These grounds are that plaintiffs have waived a jury and that the plaintiffs have engaged in a publicity campaign so prejudicial 
to the defendants that striking the jury demand is appropriate both as a sanction for this alleged misbehavior and because the 
publicity has made it impossible to impanel an impartial jury. The defendants concede that both plaintiffs made timely demands for jury trial. Their waiver argument is based instead on 
excerpts from the transcripts of numerous pretrial conferences. In several of these colloquies, plaintiffs' counsel indicated a willingness to agree to a non-jury trial if All parties so agreed, but ""A 
demand for trial by jury made as herein provided may not be withdrawn without the consent of the parties."" Rule 38(d), 
Fed.R.Civ.P. 39(a) permits the withdrawal of jury demands ""by written stipulation filed with the court or by an oral stipulation 
made in open court and entered in the record . . . ."" See Collins v. Government of the Virgin Islands, 366 F.2d 279 (3d Cir.) Cert. 
denied, 386 U.S. 958, 87 S. Ct. 1026, 18 L. Ed. 2d 105 (1966). We have carefully reviewed the cited portions of the record, and find that at no time did the plaintiffs state an unequivocal much 
less irrevocable intention to withdraw their jury demands. Even if they had, it would be manifestly unjust to treat an unaccepted 
offer to enter into a Rule 39(a) stipulation as irrevocable throughout the pendency of the pretrial stages in any case. Moreover, at 
no time have all parties agreed to dispense with a jury, and several defendants continue to join the plaintiffs in seeking a jury 
trial. The alleged ""waiver"" or ""withdrawal"" therefore fails to meet the clear requirements of the Federal Rules. Defendants' argument based on allegations of plaintiff-inspired prejudicial publicity fails for several reasons. First, we simply do not believe that the ""massive publicity campaign"" characterized by the Sharp defendants as ""a plan to corrupt 
the minds of the ultimate triers of fact"" could possibly have more than a marginal effect on the venire in this district. The 40-odd 
press clippings presented as evidence of ""Zenith's publicity crusade"" are, for the most part, collected from the inner pages of the 
Japan Times, Home Furnishings Daily, Electronics News, the Chicago Tribune, and other periodicals of limited circulation in this 
area. Even if every single one of the allegedly prejudicial articles had been published on the front pages of the general 
circulation Philadelphia dailies, they would not even begin to compare with the press coverage given to Watergate or the My Lai 
massacre yet impartial juries were selected in cases dealing with those events. See United States v. Haldeman, 181 
U.S.App.D.C. 254, 282-294, 559 F.2d 31, 59-71 (1976) Cert. denied, sub noms.  Ehrlichman v. United States and Mitchell v. 
United States, 431 U.S. 933, 97 S. Ct. 2641, 53 L. Ed. 2d 250 (1977); Calley v. Callaway, 519 F.2d 184, 203-13 (5th Cir. 1975) 
(en banc) Cert. denied, 423 U.S. 888, 96 S. Ct. 182, 46 L. Ed. 2d 119 (1976). Moreover, this district is comprised of 10 counties, 
in most of which the Philadelphia newspapers are not widely read. There has been no evidence of publicity on radio and 
television. Second, in the absence of prejudicial publicity so outrageous and pervasive that ""any subsequent court proceedings in (the) 
community . . . could be but a hollow formality,"" Rideau v. Louisiana, 373 U.S. 723, 726, 83 S. Ct. 1417, 1419, 10 L. Ed. 2d 663 
(1963), any conclusion as to the impact of publicity on prospective jurors in this case now, almost a year before trial, would 
necessarily be speculative. See Nebraska Press Ass'n. v. Stuart, 427 U.S. 539, 563, 96 S. Ct. 2791, 49 L. Ed. 2d 683 (1976). 
The Voir dire will provide an opportunity to determine whether the prospective jurors have, in fact, been prejudiced; it would 
clearly be improper to strike the jury demand on no more than speculation. Third, a variety of less drastic measures may be available to cure or ameliorate any prejudice which might be found. See, e.g., 
id. at 563-64, 96 S. Ct. 2791. The alternatives listed in Nebraska Press must be carefully considered before resort may be had to 
a step as extreme as denying the constitutional right to jury trial. If at Voir dire we find that Zenith's ""publicity campaign"" has in fact ""corrupted the minds"" of the potential jurors, and if we also find 
the prejudice so substantial that the defendants' right to a fair trial can best be protected by a remedy as drastic as striking the 
plaintiffs' jury demands, we would then have to confront a number of difficult constitutional questions. Several courts have 
recently discussed the extent to which the paramount interest in preserving the integrity of the judicial process can justify 
interference with activities normally protected by the First Amendment. See, e.g., Hirschkop v. Snead, 594 F.2d 356 (4th Cir. 
1979); In re Halkin, 194 U.S.App.D.C. 257, 598 F.2d 176 (1979); Rodgers v. United States Steel Corp., 536 F.2d 1001 (3d Cir. 
1976); CBS Inc. v. Young, 522 F.2d 234 (6th Cir. 1975); Chicago Council of Lawyers v. Bauer, 522 F.2d 242 (7th Cir. 1975) 
Cert. denied, 427 U.S. 912, 96 S. Ct. 3201, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1204 (1976). Because the possibility that the Voir dire will uncover 
substantial prejudice is remote at best, we need not decide the First Amendment issues now, and express no opinion thereon. "
681,17," See In re U. S. Financial Securities Litigation, 75 F.R.D. 702 (S.D.Cal.1977) (striking jury demand in litigation involving 
eighteen cases consolidated for trial in which five classes had been certified). Permission to appeal from the order of the District 
Court was granted by the Ninth Circuit on August 29, 1977. That appeal is currently pending. "
682,18," In this respect, we note that Rule 52(a) requires the judge in a bench trial to find both ultimate and subsidiary facts with ""detail 
and exactness."" See EEOC v. United Virginia Bank, 555 F.2d 403 (4th Cir. 1977); O'Neill v. United States, 411 F.2d 139, 146 
(3d Cir. 1969); Roberts v. Ross, 344 F.2d 747, 751 (3d Cir. 1965). The number of findings which a court would have to make 
might therefore equal or exceed the number of interrogatories which would have to be submitted to a jury. If this number were a 
mere 50,000 a number well within the defendants' projections and if the finder of fact were to work 40 hours a week without 
respite, spending a mere five minutes on each, it would take the court or jury two full years just to make the requisite findings of 
fact."
682,19," At the time that the Fleitmann suit was brought, only the government could seek an injunction to restrain an antitrust violation. 
Before the Supreme Court issued its decision, the Clayton Act extended that right to private parties; however, the Court rejected 
the notion that this effected any change in the right to a jury trial on treble damage claims.  240 U.S. at 29, 36 S. Ct. 233, 60 L. 
Ed. 505. "
683,," The plaintiff in Fleitmann sought relief in equity because shareholder derivative suits were purely equitable actions, not 
cognizable at law. See United Copper Co. v. Amalgamated Copper Co., 244 U.S. 261, 37 S. Ct. 509, 61 L. Ed. 1119 (1917) 
(shareholder had no standing to sue at law on a corporate cause of action). The merger of law and equity, effected by the adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in 1938, eliminated the dilemma. 
The legal claims in a derivative action can now be tried by a jury after a court determination of the plaintiff's right to proceed on 
the corporation's behalf. See Ross v. Bernhard, 396 U.S. 531, 535-37 & n. 6, 90 S. Ct. 733, 24 L. Ed. 2d 729 (1970). "
684,20," Although decisions of the Supreme Court have necessarily assumed that there is a right to a jury trial in antitrust suits, the 
Court has never had to decide whether the right is grounded in the statute or in the Seventh Amendment. The rather oblique 
statement of the Court in Fleitmann that ""the statute should not be read as attempting to authorize liability to be enforced 
otherwise than through the verdict of a jury . . . . (but) it plainly provides the latter remedy, and it provides no other,"" 240 U.S. at 
29, 36 S. Ct. at 234, can be read as finding the right in the statute, or it could be read as confirming and adding to the clear 
holding of the Court of Appeals in that case that the right is constitutional, See Fleitmann v. United Gas Improvement Co., 211 F. 
103 (2d Cir. 1914), Aff'd sub nom. Fleitmann v. Welsbach Street Lighting Co., 240 U.S. 27, 36 S. Ct. 233, 60 L. Ed. 505 (1916), 
especially in view of the settled principle that ""courts of equity do not award . . . damages penal in character without express 
statutory authority"" Decorative Stone Co. v. Building Trades Council, 23 F.2d 426, 427-28 (2d Cir.) Cert. denied, 277 U.S. 594, 
48 S. Ct. 530, 72 L. Ed. 1005 (1928). Later decisions of the Court have been equally ambiguous. In Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500, 79 S. Ct. 948, 3 
L. Ed. 2d 988 (1959), the Court discussed the right to a jury trial on the issues presented by an antitrust counterclaim. At one 
point in its opinion the jury trial right in antitrust cases is described as ""an essential part of the congressional plan for making 
competition rather than monopoly the rule of trade . . .,"" id., at 504, 79 S. Ct. at 953 (dictum); at another the Court refers to the 
right involved as constitutional.  Id., at 510, 79 S. Ct. 948 (dictum). In Ross v. Bernhard, 396 U.S. 531, 90 S. Ct. 733, 24 L. Ed. 
2d 729 (1970), the Court described Fleitmann and said, ""Although the decision had obvious Seventh Amendment overtones, its 
ultimate rationale was grounded in the antitrust laws."" Id., at 536, 90 S. Ct. at 737 (dictum). See id., at 547, 90 S. Ct. 733 
(Stewart, J., dissenting). "
685,21," Prior to consideration of the Clayton Act, it had been held that damage suits under the Sherman Act were actions at law in 
which the parties were entitled to trial by jury. See Meeker v. Lehigh Valley R. R., 162 F. 354 (C.C.S.D.N.Y.1908)."
685,22," The presumption that Congress intends to ""reenact"" the meaning given to language by judicial interpretation is particularly 
strong when the interpretation at issue is that of the Supreme Court. Ward v. Northern Ohio Telephone Co., 251 F. Supp. 606, 
610 (N.D.Ohio 1966) Aff'd. per curiam 381 F.2d 16 (6th Cir. 1967). See Shapiro v. United States, 335 U.S. 1, 16, 68 S. Ct. 1375, 
92 L. Ed. 1787 (1948); Hecht v. Malley, 265 U.S. 144, 153, 44 S. Ct. 462, 68 L. Ed. 949 (1924). "
686,23," The debates in the House concerned a proposal that final judgments in suits brought by the government have conclusive 
collateral estoppel effect, both for and against the defendant, in subsequent private actions. Since there would be no right to a 
jury in suits brought by the government in equity to restrain antitrust violations, Congress was concerned that the statute might 
unconstitutionally foreclose presentation of those issues to a jury in later damage suits. The colloquy included the following statement by Representative Green: I am not entirely clear as to whether this section is constitutional even as against the defendant corporation, but I am inclined to 
think that the provision might stand in that respect. . . . The suit commenced by a third party might be a suit for damages 
commenced in a case at law, in which either party is entitled to a trial by jury. . . . (T)he trial by jury will still go on as to the extent 
of the damages; . . . (b)ut I agree with the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BEALL) in saying that even as to that matter the section is 
of doubtful constitutionality. . . . He can use, presumably, and obtain the same evidence which the Government has used, even 
though the decree be not made conclusive in his favor; but if it is possible, if it can constitutionally be made conclusive in his 
favor, I would be in favor of having it done. In any event, the amendment of the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. VOLSTEAD) 
ought to be agreed to. . . ."" (Emphasis added) And this response from Representative Scott: I think there is a grave question also as to the constitutionality of the statute, even if changed to conform to the amendment 
offered by the gentleman from Minnesota. However, I am not clear upon that question. I am satisfied, however, that the matter 
never will be settled until it reaches the Supreme Court of the United States. When you enact into this statute a provision which 
deprives a corporation of the right to a hearing before a jury as provided by the Constitution you will find that statute challenged 
and you will never know what the law is upon the question until the court of last resort speaks the last word. . . . However, upon no course of reasoning could it be held that this statute in its present form would be constitutional, and, 
therefore, I believe that the amendment of the gentleman from Minnesota should prevail. The proposal being debated was eventually rejected in favor of what is now 15 U.S.C. ยง 16(a), providing that the judgment in a 
government suit is only prima facie evidence, and only against the defendant."
686,24," Even if we were able to find the right to jury trial implicit in the statutory scheme, it would still be necessary to address the 
constitutional question in order to determine the scope of the statutory right, because the right incorporated by such an exercise 
of statutory construction Is the constitutional right. We might also have to decide whether the right thus incorporated is ""frozen"" 
despite later changes in what the Seventh Amendment is thought to require, or whether the statutory right is now whatever the 
Seventh Amendment now requires, even if it was thought to require something else at the time of enactment of the statute in 
question. For example, at the time that the Clayton Act became law, Congress doubtless thought not only that treble damage 
actions required juries, but that they required juries of twelve. See e.g., Capital Traction Co. v. Hof, 174 U.S. 1, 13-14, 19 S. Ct. 
580, 43 L. Ed. 873 (1899); Maxwell v. Dow, 176 U.S. 581, 586, 20 S. Ct. 448, 44 L. Ed. 597 (1900) (""And as the right of trial by 
jury in certain suits at common law is preserved by the Seventh Amendment, such a trial implies that there shall be a unanimous 
verdict of twelve jurors in all Federal courts where a jury trial is held.""). Now that the Seventh Amendment is known Not to 
require a jury of twelve, See Colgrove v. Battin, 413 U.S. 149, 93 S. Ct. 2448, 37 L. Ed. 2d 522 (1973), courts in districts that do 
not make a jury of twelve available as of right would need to decide whether such juries must nevertheless be available to the 
parties in antitrust suits and other actions based on statutes whose legislative histories show some expectation that the 
constitution would require juries of twelve. "
687,," This type of puzzle would be presented here by the alternate possibilities that there was a ""complexity"" exception to the jury trial 
rule at the time that the antitrust laws were enacted, (a possibility suggested by the defendants' reliance on Kirby v. Lake Shore 
& M. S. R. R., 120 U.S. 130, 7 S. Ct. 430, 30 L. Ed. 569 (1887), decided just three years before the Sherman Act), or that such 
an exception was first recognized to be of constitutional dimension in Ross v. Bernhard, 396 U.S. 531, 538 n. 10, 90 S. Ct. 733, 
24 L. Ed. 2d 729 (1970). The decisions of the Court in Colgrove and in Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322, 99 S. Ct. 
645, 58 L. Ed. 2d 552 (1979), would seem to imply that the statutory right is whatever the constitution would require, complete 
with exceptions and limitations, but that issue is not before us."
687,25," See, e.g., Jackson v. Bishop, 404 F.2d 571, 578-79 (8th Cir. 1968) (Blackmun, J.) (scope of the Eighth Amendment ban on 
cruel and unusual punishment is determined by society's ""evolving standards of decency"")."
687,26," The first ten amendments were submitted to the states by Congress on September 25, 1789, 1 Stat. 97 (1789), and became 
effective on December 15, 1791, when Virginia brought to eleven the number of states approving them. See Wolfram, The 
Constitutional History of the Seventh Amendment, 57 Minn.L.Rev. 639, 725-726 (1973)."
687,27," The historical test may have evolved almost by accident. See generally, Wolfram, Supra, note 26 at 639-642. The reference 
to the law of England appears to have been first used by Justice Story in United States v. Wonson, 1 Gall. 5, 28 F.Cas. 745, 750 
(C.C.D.Mass.1812): Beyond all question, the common law here alluded to (in the Seventh Amendment) is not the common law of any individual state, 
(for it probably differs in all), but it is the common law of England, the grand reservoir of all our jurisprudence. It cannot be 
necessary for me to expound the grounds of this opinion, because they must be obvious to every person acquainted with the 
history of the law. According to Wolfram, this rule has never been seriously questioned: ""perhaps later judges have hesitated to appear to be the 
kind of intractable person that would require Mr. Justice Story to elaborate on the obvious."" Wolfram, Supra, 57 Minn.L.Rev. at 
641. Nevertheless, Wolfram's thorough canvass of the debates in the Constitutional Convention and in the state ratification 
conventions demonstrates that the reference to English law could hardly have been ""obvious."" See id., at 712-18, 721-22, 734. Once the use of English common law had become settled, the historical test followed, though not until the end of the nineteenth 
century. See id., at 642. Wolfram suggests that this is because earlier cases involved issues as to which changes in the English 
common law were irrelevant. Id. However, since England had no parallel constitutional guarantee, Parliament was free to 
change the scope of the right to a jury, and it did. The Judicature Acts of 1873-75 permitted the court ""to dispense with a jury in 
chancery cases, cases requiring review of voluminous documents, and cases requiring any scientific or other type of 
investigation not conveniently made with a jury."" Higginbotham, Continuing the Dialogue: Civil Juries and the Allocation of 
Judicial Powers, 56 Tex.L.Rev. 47, 51 (1977). Thus, the historical reference may have been required to prevent the scope of an "
688,," American constitutional right from depending on changes in English practice a century after independence. See Wolfram, Supra, 
at 642. Although English decisions from the 1780's and 90's are obviously the most helpful in determining which issues were tried to 
juries there in 1791, Seventh Amendment questions frequently require recourse to earlier or later cases, which ""presumably 
would be authoritative only to the extent that they themselves accurately reflect the English state of practice in 1791."" Id., at 642, 
n. 8. But since the constitution itself has sought to ""preserve"" that state of practice in the federal courts, federal cases may be 
presumed to reflect that position somewhat more accurately than cases from the English courts or the state courts, other things 
being equal. Most state constitutions also ""preserve"" the right to trial by jury in similar terms, but the scope of those guarantees 
varies widely. This is because the practices in the original 13 colonies varied and because states admitted later sometimes used 
a different referent. For example, in California the scope of the right is determined by reference to the English common law in 
1850, when California's constitution was adopted. See F. James & G. Hazard, Civil Procedure ยง 8.1 at 347-348 & n. 4 (1977)."
688,28," In Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322, 99 S. Ct. 645, 58 L. Ed. 2d 552 (1979), the Court held that a defendant in a 
private damage suit may be collaterally estopped from relitigating before a jury issues adversely determined in an earlier 
injunctive action brought by the SEC, where no jury was available. Whether he is thereby denied a jury determination of an issue 
on which he would have been entitled to one in 1791 depends on how the question is put. It is true that there would have been 
no estoppel in 1791 because at that time collateral estoppel was available only between parties in the prior litigation; on the 
other hand, it is equally the case that at common law, ""a litigant was not entitled to have a jury determine issues that had been "
689,," previously adjudicated by a chancellor in equity."" Compare id. 99 S. Ct. 652 at 652-55 (opinion of the Court) With id. at 659-61. 
(Rehnquist, J., dissenting). See generally Shapiro and Coquillette, The Fetish of Jury Trials in Civil Cases: A Comment on 
Rachal v. Hill, 85 Harv.L.Rev. 442 (1971)."
689,29," In view of this concession, it is unnecessary to engage in the extensive historical analysis which would be required to 
determine conclusively the question of the applicability of the Seventh Amendment to antitrust actions. For examples of this type 
of analysis, see Mr. Justice Marshall's opinion for the Court in Pernell v. Southall Realty, 416 U.S. 363, 94 S. Ct. 1723, 40 L. Ed. 
2d 198 (1974), tracing the history of actions for the recovery of real property, and Judge Friendly's opinion for the majority in 
Damsky v. Zavatt, 289 F.2d 46 (2d Cir. 1961), tracing the history of the Court of Exchequer in order to determine whether there 
was a constitutional right to a jury in a suit by the government to collect taxes allegedly due. Although in view of the defendant's position we assume without deciding that there is a constitutional right to jury trial in antitrust 
cases, we note that this assumption is supported by abundant evidence. The acts prohibited by the antitrust laws are similar to 
those banned by the Statute of Laborers, 1349, 23 Edw. Ch. 3, c. 6, and the Statute of Monopolies, 1623, 21 Jac. c. 3, both of 
which gave a right to penal damages in the courts of common law. In addition, antitrust actions have been held to sound in tort, 
classically a ""legal"" cause, See n. 61, Infra. Finally, treble damages are traditionally a remedy available only in the courts of law. 
See pp. 921-922, Infra. "
690,30," See Williams v. Collier, 32 F. Supp. 321 (E.D.Pa.1940) (Kalodner, J.); Belsheim, The Old Action of Account, 45 Harv.L.Rev. 
466 (1932); 5 Moore's Federal Practice P 38.25, at 198 (2d ed. 1978); 2 Story's Equity Jurisprudence ยงยง 580-602, at 1-17 (14th 
ed. 1918). Belsheim traces Account back to the early thirteenth century when, in a system of land ownership where ""it was 
common for (feudal) lords to grant out manors to bailiffs, who were to account for the rents and profits thereof, deduction being 
made for the expenses incurred,"" the action provided redress for the lord ""in case such a bailiff refused to account."" Belsheim, 
Supra, at 467-68."
690,31," In order to obtain relief, the plaintiff needed first to establish before a jury the defendant's obligation to account to him. The 
defendant would then be compelled by physical arrest and imprisonment, if necessary to appear before auditors appointed by 
the court, who would settle the accounts between the parties. Disputed issues of fact arising before the auditors would also be 
resolved by a jury. See Ex parte Peterson, 253 U.S. 300, 308, 40 S. Ct. 543, 64 L. Ed. 919 (1920). Finally, the plaintiff could 
submit the auditors' final computation to the court of law to obtain a final judgment for any amount due. Belsheim, Supra note 30, 
at 493-499."
690,32," During the earlier middle ages, account could be brought only against bailiffs, guardians in socage, receivers ad 
computandum, and certain few others; it was later extended to other types of receivers, to partners, to the plaintiff's executors, to 
the defendant's executors, and to third party beneficiaries. See id., at 475-493."
690,33," Though the old action of account fell into general disuse, it had not entirely disappeared at the close of the eighteenth century. 
See, Belsheim, Supra note 27, at 466; 2 Story's Equity Jurisprudence ยง 581, at 2 & n. 1 (14th ed. 1918). According to Story, 
such actions were also brought ""in the form of assumpsit, covenant, and debt . . . in the Courts of Common Law,"" or by a bill in 
equity. Id."
690,34," The concurrent jurisdiction in matters of account also included cases involving mutual accounts, an accounting between two 
partners, an accounting by the principal where the agent's compensation depended upon the principal's profits, and others. See 
4 Pomeroy's Equity Jurisprudence ยงยง 1420, 1421 (5th ed. 1941). For a survey of other matters within the concurrent jurisdiction, 
See 1 id. ยงยง 139, 140, at 191-194. "
691,35," The proposition that complex accounting cases were within the concurrent jurisdiction of law and equity might best be 
described as the majority view. At least one court has expressed the opinion that some cases might be complex enough to 
justify an injunction against a pending action at law. See Crane v. Ely, 37 N.J.Eq. 564, 571 (1883) (dictum). Other authorities 
imply that mere complication of accounts, in the absence of some trust or fiduciary relation, may not be enough to sustain equity 
jurisdiction: "
692,," It is held that equity has jurisdiction to award an accounting between parties where there are involved mutual accounts or 
accounts of such complication that it is not practicable to try the case at law before a jury. . . . This has been denied where no 
trust relationship is involved. . . . But, however this may be, it is settled that equity will not take jurisdiction because of the 
complication of accounts unless the remedy at law is clearly inadequate; and where the practice at law permits reference to 
auditors or referees there is seldom occasion for the exercise of the jurisdiction. . . . Under the federal practice, cases involving 
complicated accounts can be referred to auditors for the simplification of the issues involved, and the difficulties of trial at law of 
actions involving such accounts are thus in large measure obviated. Broderick v. American General Corp., 71 F.2d 864, 867-68 (4th Cir. 1934) (citations omitted). See Sedalia v. Standard Oil Co., 
66 F.2d 757, 761 (8th Cir. 1933) Cert. denied, 290 U.S. 706, 54 S. Ct. 374, 78 L. Ed. 607 (1934); 2 Story's Equity Jurisprudence 
ยง 598, at 13-14 (14th ed. 1918). We may well conclude with Story that ""where there is a remedy at law there is no small 
confusion and difficulty in the authorities . . . which . . . seem to deliver over the subject to interminable doubts."" Id., ยง 595, at 11-
12. That the Seventh Amendment guaranty of jury trial extends to the plaintiffs in such cases was assumed by the Court in Ex parte 
Peterson, 253 U.S. 300, 40 S. Ct. 543, 64 L. Ed. 919 (1920). The plaintiff brought an action at law on an account including 298 
items; the defendant's answer and counterclaim ""set up another account containing 402 items."" In the trial court, Judge 
Augustus Hand appointed an auditor to make a preliminary investigation as to the facts, hear the witnesses, examine the accounts of the parties, and make and file a 
report in the office of the clerk of this court, with a view to simplifying the issues for the jury, but not to finally determine any of the 
issues in the action, the final determination of all issues of fact to be made by the jury on the trial . . . . Id., at 304, 40 S. Ct. at 544. The plaintiff then sought a writ of mandamus, complaining that the appointment of the auditor 
interfered with his Seventh Amendment right. In an opinion by Justice Brandeis, the Court approved Judge Hand's appointment of an auditor, comparing it to the traditional 
practice of appointing such auditors to aid courts of equity ""where the facts are complicated and the evidence voluminous."" Id., 
at 313, 40 S. Ct. at 547. What the District Judge was seeking when he appointed the auditor in the case at bar was just such aid. He required it himself, 
because without the aid to be rendered through the preliminary hearing and report, the trial judge would be unable to perform his 
duty of defining to the jury the issues submitted for their determination and of directing their attention to the matters actually in 
issue.  United States v. Reading Railroad, 123 U.S. 113, 114, 8 S. Ct. 77, 31 L. Ed. 138. The hearing and report were also 
essential as shown above to enable the jury to perform their specific duty. Owing to the difference in the character of the 
proceedings and of the questions ordinarily involved, the occasion for seeking such aid as is afforded to a judge by special 
masters, auditors, or examiners arises less frequently at law than in equity. Id., at 313-14, 40 S. Ct. at 547. Thus, the Court recognized that matters complex enough to require the aid of an auditor, though 
more often found in courts of equity, were cognizable at law as well. And as long as the auditor's report was no more than prima 
facie evidence, ""(t)he limitation imposed by the (Seventh) amendment . . . that enjoyment of the right of trial by jury be not 
obstructed, and that the ultimate determination of issues of fact by the jury be not interfered with,"" was respected. Id., at 310, 40 
S. Ct. at 546. Provision for such appointments in complex matters to be tried to juries is now made in Rule 53(b), Fed.R.Civ.P. See Dairy 
Queen, Inc. v. Wood, 369 U.S. 469, 478, 82 S. Ct. 894, 8 L. Ed. 2d 44 (1962)."
692,36," Issues as to which the plaintiff was able to choose the mode of trial arose in two basic patterns. They are explained by 
Professors James and Hazard: B's violation of A's statutory right (e.g., to a patent or copyright) might entitle A to an injunction, to compensatory damages, and 
to a penalty. The right to any relief would turn on whether B violated the statute. A might get a determination of that issue without 
a jury in an equity suit, seeking an injunction and perhaps compensatory damages as incidental to an injunction. Or he might get 
such determination in an action at law for damages or for the penalty. Since equity refused to enforce a penalty and the law 
would not give an injunction, two suits would be required for complete relief. A had the choice which to bring first. And the first "
693,," determination of the common issue (violation vel non) would bind the parties in the second action. The plaintiff thus had the 
power to choose the mode of trial of the common issue, and he could so exercise it as to leave no room for judicial discretion. If the statute did not provide for a penalty, A might be able to get complete relief in a suit in equity. But he would also have the 
option to sue for damages at law and for an injunction in equity separately, in whichever order he chose. So here again A could 
control the mode of trial of the common issue, without leaving room for judicial discretion. In another class of cases A also had a choice, but it was a more limited one. Breach of certain kinds of contracts (e.g., to convey 
land) would entitle the injured party to either specific performance (with incidental damages for delay of performance, and the 
like) or to damages for breach (measured on the assumption that the contract would not be performed). Here A could in no case 
get both forms of relief he had to elect one or the other. His election would govern the mode of trial of issues (the making of the 
contract, performance of conditions precedent, breach, and the like), which would be presented in a claim for Either kind of relief. F. James & G. Hazard, Civil Procedure ยง 8.7, at 370-72 (1977) (footnotes omitted); James, Right to a Jury Trial in Civil Actions, 
72 Yale L.J. 655, 671-73 (1963). Actions within the concurrent jurisdiction of law and equity fall into the latter pattern, except 
that, instead of choosing between ""legal"" and ""equitable"" remedies for the same right, the plaintiff simply chooses between the 
remedy provided in the law courts and the remedy ""of the same general nature"" made available by equity because for some 
reason the remedy administered at law is not ""full, adequate, and complete."" 1 Pomeroy's Equity Jurisprudence ยง 139, at 191-92 
(5th ed. 1941)."
693,37," The complaint in Beacon Theatres sought a declaratory judgment that the plaintiff was not violating the antitrust laws, and an 
injunction to prevent the defendant from instituting an antitrust suit against the plaintiff. The defendant counterclaimed for treble 
damages, and the trial court then ordered that the plaintiff's ""essentially equitable"" claims be tried without a jury before the jury 
trial on the counterclaim, even though the issue of violation of the Sherman Act was common to both claims, and the party 
against whom that issue was determined in the court trial would be collaterally estopped from relitigating it before the jury. The 
Supreme Court granted mandamus and ordered a jury trial on all issues in defendant's claim. "
694,38," In Dairy Queen, a franchiser alleging breach of the franchise agreement sued to restrain the franchisee from use of the 
franchise and trademark, and from collecting funds from subfranchisees. It also sought ""an accounting to determine the exact 
amount of money owing . . ."" 369 U.S., at 475, 82 S. Ct. at 898. The district court struck the defendant's jury demand on the 
alternate theories that the action was ""purely equitable"" or that, if not, then the legal issues were ""incidental"" to the equitable 
ones. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the claim for a money judgment for breach of contract is not equitable merely 
because it is ""cast in terms of an ""accounting,' rather than in terms of an action for ""debt' or ""damages.' "" Id., at 477-78, 82 S. Ct. 
at 900. And it strongly rejected the notion that it is ever permissible to characterize legal issues as ""incidental"" in order to restrict 
the right to a jury trial."
694,39," The expanded boundaries for the right to jury trial established in Beacon Theatres and Dairy Queen seem to have been 
regarded in those opinions as constitutionally required. Consequently, some commentators have viewed Beacon Theatres, Dairy 
Queen, and Ross v. Bernhard, 396 U.S. 531, 90 S. Ct. 733, 24 L. Ed. 2d 729 (1970) as representing an abandonment of the 
historical test in favor of a ""dynamic"" or ""flexible"" or ""rational"" approach to the Seventh Amendment. See 9 C. Wright and A. 
Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure ยง 2302, at 24 (1971); McCoid, Procedural Reform and the Right to Jury Trial; A Study of 
Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 116 U.Pa.L.Rev. 1 (1967); Redish, Seventh Amendment Right to Jury Trial: A Study in the 
Irrationality of Rational Decision Making, 70 Nw.U.L.Rev. 486, 526 (1975). Note, The Right to a Jury Trial in Complex Civil 
Litigation, 92 Harv.L.Rev. 898, 900-904 & n. 28 (1979). However, the Court in later cases has referred to the Beacon 
Theatres/Dairy Queen holding as an ""equitable doctrine."" See Katchen v. Landy, 382 U.S. 323, 339, 86 S. Ct. 467, 15 L. Ed. 2d 
391 (1966). To the extent that Beacon Theatres And Dairy Queen have expanded the right to jury trial further than required by a 
strict application of the historical test, the characterization in Katchen is accurate. The Seventh Amendment, of course, does not 
prohibit such an expansion, but merely prohibits any contraction of the jury trial right to limits narrower than those permitted by "
695,," the historical test. Moreover, the Court's more recent decisions have eliminated any doubt about the continuing validity of the 
historical test. See pp. 926-929, Infra."
695,40," The dicta in Dairy Queen were themselves based on earlier dicta in Kirby v. Lake Shore & M. S. R. R., 120 U.S. 130, 7 S. Ct. 
430, 30 L. Ed. 569 (1887). In Kirby, after holding that ""The complicated nature of the accounts between the parties constitutes 
itself a sufficient ground for going into equity,"" id., at 134, 7 S. Ct. at 432, the Court went on to observe, It would have been difficult, if not impossible, for a jury to unravel the numerous transactions involved in the settlements between 
the parties, and reach a satisfactory conclusion as to the amount of drawbacks to which Alexander & Co. were entitled on each 
settlement. 1 Story, Eq.Jur. ยง 451. Justice could not be done except by employing the methods of investigation peculiar to courts 
of equity. When to these considerations is added the charge against the defendants of actual concealed fraud, the right of the 
plaintiff to invoke the jurisdiction of equity cannot well be doubted. Id., at 134, 7 S. Ct. at 432. "

697,42," For a more extended discussion of special juries, see Thayer, The Jury and Its Development, 5 Harv.L.Rev. 295, 300-302 
(1892). According to Thayer, ""there seems always to have existed the power of selecting those especially qualified for a given 
service . . . . What we call the ""special jury"" . . . was a natural result of the principle that those were to be summoned who could 
best tell the veritatem rei. . . . For the handling of these greater and more complicated causes, there was picked out a better 
class of jurymen . . . ."" Id., at 300-301."
697,43," The defendants appear to adopt the presentation of this argument found in In re U. S. Financial Securities Litigation, 75 
F.R.D. 702, 708-709 (S.D.Cal.1977) Appeal pending # 77-8213 (9th Cir. 8/29/77)."
697,44, The relevant rules provide:

697,3," . Subject to the provisions of the following Rules, the plaintiff may, with his reply, or at any time after the close of the pleadings,

notice within four days from the time of the service of the notice of trial, or within such extended time as the Court or Judge may 
allow, to the effect that he desires to have the issues of fact tried before a Judge and jury, be entitled to have the same so tried."

jury, but the 1875 Act and Rules generally restored the jury trial right to its pre-1873 limits. See Judicature Act, 1875, ยง 22; Sugg 
v. Silber, 1 Q.B.D. 362, 366 (1876) (opinion of Pollock, B.). "
699,45," We suggest the above reading of Clench largely for the purpose of showing that defendants' reading is not necessarily the 
only or the best one. We do not claim ours to be definitive; nevertheless, given the fact that juries had long considered 
documentary evidence, any ""recognition"" in Clench that equity would enjoin jury trials of matters involving complex documents 
would have been out of step with the prior and subsequent developments in the common law. Other grounds for the Clench decision can easily be hypothesized. In view of the significance of documentary evidence, Lord 
Egerton may have kept the matter in equity because only in equity could discovery be compelled. And there is certainly a hint of 
the doctrine of laches in the order enjoining trial of a 50-year-old claim ""till he had shewed better matter . . ., being a thing so 
long past."" Cf.  Gee v. CBS, Inc., 471 F. Supp. 600 (E.D.Pa.1979) (50 year old claim for breach of fiduciary duty barred by 
statute of limitations). Finally, it is possible that a complete reading of Clench would have to take account of the temptations to excess at a time when 
the famous struggle between law and equity was approaching its climax. See F. James & G. Hazard, Civil Procedure ยง 1.5, at 
15-17 (1977). "
700,46," See p. 902 & n. 40, Supra ; Goffe & Clarkener, Inc. v. Lyons Milling Co., 26 F.2d 801 (D.Kan.1928), and sources cited therein. 
Perhaps the most extreme example is provided by Bennett v. United Lumber & Supply Co., 110 Conn. 536, 148 A. 369 (1930): The action upon the second count was in reality an action for an accounting involving many charges and credits between the 
parties aggregating upwards of $ 50,000. The trial was a protracted one; the account a difficult one to unravel. The printed 
evidence consists of 366 pages of the record while there were introduced in evidence 64 exhibits. No action for an accounting, 
or one of this character, should be tried to the jury. It imposes upon a jury an impossible task to expect them to carry in memory 
the details of a case of this character. It is unfair to a litigant to have his case determined by a tribunal which cannot fulfill that 
duty with accuracy or justice, however intelligent and desirous of doing their full duty the tribunal may be. Id. Surprisingly enough, the court in Bennett then proceeded to reinstate the jury's verdict, reversing the judgment n. o. v. won by 
the defendant in the trial court. Dicta such as those in Bennett must be read with extreme caution, not only because they are dicta, but also because ""the courts 
of the nineteenth and early twentieth century simply did not share (the unequivocal commitment to the virtue of jury trials shown 
in Beacon Theatres. There was instead) a more or less distinctly conscious judicial aversion to jury trial, especially in the federal 
courts and the court systems of the Northeastern states."" F. James & G. Hazard, Civil Procedure ยง 8.5, at 364 (1977) (footnotes 
omitted). The Bennett dictum must be read with even greater caution, coming as it does from a state system which, at the time 
of the adoption of the federal constitution, ""had a procedure all its own, going beyond anything in English practice, by which all 
issues of fact or law could be decided by the court,"" Henderson, The Background of the Seventh Amendment, 80 Harv.L.Rev. 
289, 317 (1966), and in which such procedures apparently survived well into the twentieth century. See Ex parte Peterson, 253 
U.S. 300, 308-09 & n. 3, 40 S. Ct. 543, 64 L. Ed. 919 (1920); Sulzer v. Watson, 39 F. 414 (C.C.D.Vt.1889) (in action of ""book-
account"" in Connecticut, trial is by court-appointed auditor rather than by jury; Connecticut procedure could not be used in 
federal court because of Seventh Amendment)."
700,47," Blackstone's Commentaries were first published in 1765 and may, therefore, be especially valuable as a guide to the theory 
and practice of late eighteenth-century England."
700,48," Story was responding to Blackstone's view that discovery was the sole ground for equity jurisdiction in matters of account. According to Story, discovery "
701,," . . ., although a strong yet is not the sole ground of (concurrent) jurisdiction (in matters of account). The whole machinery of 
Courts of Equity is better adapted to the purpose of an account in general, and in many cases independent of the searching 
power of discovery, and supposing a Court of Law to possess it, it would be impossible for the latter to do entire justice between 
the parties; for equitable rights and claims not cognizable at law are often involved in the contest. Lord Redesdale has justly said 
that in a complicated account a Court of Law would be incompetent to examine it at Nisi Prius with all the necessary accuracy. 
This is the principle on which Courts of Equity constantly act by taking cognizance of matters which though cognizable at law are 
yet so involved with a complex account that it cannot be properly take at law; and until the result of the account is known, the 
justice of the case cannot appear."

702,49," It is noteworthy that in the case before us the alleged complexity is in the determination of liability, not damages."
702,50," The defendants' claim of an absolute right to a non-jury trial in this litigation must be based upon the unarticulated premise 
that matters deemed too complex for juries were within the Exclusive jurisdiction of equity, much as derivative actions were 
cognizable only in equity. But, had defendants been able to establish this premise, the exclusively legal nature of treble 
damages would create a potential conflict of rights in every complex antitrust case not unlike the conflict that left the plaintiff in 
the Fleitmann case without a remedy. See n. 19, Supra. However, the refusal of the law courts to entertain derivative suits was a 
mere ""procedural impediment"" to the trial by jury of legal claims presented in such suits, a problem eliminated by merger. See 
Ross v. Bernhard, 396 U.S. 531, 90 S. Ct. 733, 24 L. Ed. 2d 729 (1970). The conflict of rights which the defendants here seek to 
create would admit of no solution unless one of the rights is preferred, or all parties agree on the mode of trial. "
703,51," The plaintiffs in Ross were shareholders in a closed-end investment company, which they claimed had paid excessive 
brokerage fees because of improper control by its broker. The plaintiffs alleged breach of the contract between the investment 
company and its broker; they accused the directors of breach of fiduciary duty, conversion of corporate assets, bad faith, gross 
negligence, and misconduct. The suit sought to require that the defendants, including the brokerage house, ""account for and pay 
to the Corporation . . . their profits and gains and its losses."" 396 U.S. at 531-32, 90 S. Ct. at 734. HN15[

703,52," Because there were no factual questions common to both issues in Ross, the principles of Beacon Theatres were not 
offended by resolving the equitable issue first."
703,53," Letter from Ronald Lee Gilman, Esquire to Judge Edward R. Becker (March 2, 1979), filed of record. Mr. Gilman, who 
represented McCoy, was kind enough to furnish this information at our request. "
704,54," Had McCoy been entitled to a jury trial, the court of appeals could have affirmed the judgment n. o. v. only if there was 
insufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict. See Upton v. Western Ins. Co., 492 F.2d 148 (6th Cir. 1974); DeGarmo v. City 
of Alcoa, 332 F.2d 403 (6th Cir. 1964). Since the court of appeals determined that McCoy was not entitled to a jury, the trial 
court's findings of fact on the fraudulent conveyance issue were reviewed under the ""clearly erroneous"" standard applicable after 
a bench trial."
704,55," The court may also have been influenced by the fact that interpleader, like the derivative action, had been a remedial device 
belonging to equity alone, although it interpreted Ross as requiring that in interpleader suits, as in derivative actions, the legal or 
equitable nature of the underlying issues was to determine the Seventh Amendment question. "
705,56," The court's analysis of the third Ross factor emphasized the centrality of ""an impartial and capable fact finder"" to the fairness 
which, under the due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, measures ""the legitimacy of government action. 
. . ."" 420 F. Supp., at 104. The court then considered the need to excuse employed persons from the jury because of an 
estimated trial time of four to six months, the possibility that evidence of settlement of other litigation against the defendant would 
prejudice the jury, and the advantages enjoyed by the court as fact finder, including experience in other commercial cases, 
familiarity with the case from the pretrial proceedings, the ability to review daily transcripts, etc.  Id., at 103, 104-05."
705,57," The cases considered by the court in reaching this conclusion included the Clench and Wedderburn cases discussed above 
at 49-55, and several of the complex accounting cases discussed above at 33-40. "
706,58," The court rejected the defendants' suggestion that the damages be characterized as equitable restitution. The plaintiffs also 
sought injunctive relief, but it is of course well settled that the joinder of legal and equitable claims does not waive the right to a 
jury on the legal claims, including any common issues. See Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500, 79 S. Ct. 948, 3 L. 
Ed. 2d 988 (1959)."
706,59," In ILC Judge Conti had denied a pretrial motion to strike the jury demand on the ground of complexity. The trial took 96 days 
but ended in a mistrial, declared when the jury was deadlocked after 19 days of deliberations. Judge Conti then directed a 
verdict for the defendants, and struck the jury demand in the event that a remand necessitated a second trial. In finding that the case was beyond the abilities of jurors, Judge Conti relied heavily on his own observations during trial: The jurors were conscientious and diligent, but their past experience had not prepared them to decide a case involving technical 
and financial questions of the highest order. Throughout the trial, the court felt that the jury was having trouble grasping the concepts that were being discussed by the expert 
witnesses, most of whom had doctorate degrees in their specialities. This perception was confirmed when the court questioned 
the jurors during the course of their deliberations and after they were discharged. When asked by the court whether a case of 
this type should be tried to a jury, the foreman of the jury said, ""If you can find a jury that's both a computer technician, a lawyer, 
an economist, knows all about that stuff, yes, I think you could have a qualified jury, but we don't know anything about that."" (Tr. 
19,548). Several of the other jurors indicated that they thought the major stumbling block was the requirement that the verdict be 
unanimous. When they were questioned after the trial, most of the jurors indicated that they thought a complex antitrust case like 
this one should be tried to the court."

707,60," Even the famous dictum in United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U.S. 144, 152 n. 4, 58 S. Ct. 778, 82 L. Ed. 1234 
(1938) did not go nearly as far as some have suggested for the Ross footnote. See Regents of the University of California v. 
Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 98 S. Ct. 2733, 2748 n. 28, 57 L. Ed. 2d 750 (1978)."

708,62," See pp. 907, 913-914 & n. 40, Supra."

392 n. 4 (5th Cir. 1976); Tondas v. Amateur Hockey Ass'n., 438 F. Supp. 310, 315 (W.D.N.Y.1977); Albert Levine Associates v. 
Bertoni & Cotti, S.p.A., 314 F. Supp. 169, 171 (S.D.N.Y.1970); Fagan v. Sunbeam Lighting Co., 303 F. Supp. 356 (S.D.Ill.1969)."
708,64," One commentator draws the opposite inference from the failure of the Curtis and Pernell decisions to mention the Ross 
footnote, thinking it ""unlikely . . . that the Court would overturn so significant a decision without some comment."" Note, The Right "
709,," to a Jury Trial in Complex Civil Litigation, 92 Harv.L.Rev. 898, 902 n. 28. But this argument Assumes that the Ross footnote 
announced a significant constitutional doctrine, and is also based on the questionable premise that the Court had abandoned the 
historical test in favor of a ""dynamic"" interpretation of the Seventh Amendment. See note 39, Supra."
709,65," See pp. 905-906, Supra."
709,66," Although in Pons the Court described the parameters of the Seventh Amendment in terms of ""legal relief . . . and legal rights,"" 
the holding of the Court was based on statutory grounds."
709,67," Because the ""legal"" or ""equitable"" nature of a claim was not an issue in Parklane, the Court's failure to use the Ross ""test"" 
does not of itself vitiate the claim that the Ross footnote is the appropriate test for such issues. However, both the majority and 
dissenting opinions in Parklane clearly subscribed to the historical test. Compare Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322, 
99 S. Ct. 645, 652-55, 58 L. Ed. 2d 552 (1979), With id., at 337-350, 99 S. Ct. at 655-61 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). "
711,68," The decision in the Hyde Properties case would seem to apply not only to the action then before the court, but to all such 
actions. However, as we have noted, the alleged difficulty of such matters for juries did not seem to be important to the holding 
of the court. See supra, at 923."
711,69," In Radial Lip Machine, Inc. v. International Carbide Corp., 76 F.R.D. 224 (N.D.Ill.1977), the court read Ross as ""clearly 
(directing) federal courts to inquire into the competence of juries to handle different kinds of issues,"" Id., at 226, but considered 
and rejected the case-by-case approach: The inquiry is a generic one, directed toward classifying a group of claims. Thus, the historical portion of the Ross test evaluates 
the entire line of judicial precedents to determine the traditional characterization of a particular claim. Once the court finds that 
the nature of an issue is basically legal, the right to a jury trial exists for that entire class of claims. The portion of the Ross test 
which weighs the practical abilities and limitations of juries contemplates a general analysis of the problems typically presented 
by those claims, not a specific case-by-case analysis of the complexity of the litigation. Otherwise, the courts would be forced to 
apply an unmanageable standard of complexity in every case before them. Id., at 227-28. While we agree with Judge Marshall that the case-by-case approach is unmanageable, it is difficult for us to see 
how the proposed ""generic"" inquiry is any less so. On what basis would the court find the relevant facts and decide that patent or 
tax or antitrust or securities issues are, as a class, too difficult for juries? Clearly, issues within each of these classes (or almost 
any other that might be named) range from the very simple to the very complex. The judgment that some generic class of issues 
is ""too complex"" for decision by jury is the type of judgment better made in the political or legislative process."
711,70," Actions seeking an accounting, maintainable in equity if sufficiently complicated, would seem to have been an exception to 
this general rule. See supra, at 923-924. "
712,71," In an attempt to avoid such speculation, a court may indicate, as the court did in In re U. S. Financial Securities Litigation, 75 
F.R.D. 702, 714 (S.D.Cal.1977) that the jury demand will be reinstated if subsequent developments sufficiently simplify the case. 
This would give the party seeking trial by jury an incentive to settle part of the case in order to obtain a jury trial of the remainder. 
At the same time, the party opposing trial by jury is given a countervailing and similarly strong incentive Not to settle even when 
he otherwise would, since by settling some of the claims he jeopardizes his new-found ""right"" to a non-jury trial of the remainder."
712,72," The line-drawing problems awaiting any attempt to apply the Ross test in a principled and consistent manner are obvious. 
Compare, e.g., In re Boise Cascade Securities Litigation, 420 F. Supp. 99, 105 (court would be ""more capable of fairly deciding 
the facts""); SEC v. Associated Minerals, Inc., 75 F.R.D. 724, 726 (E.D.Mich.1977) (""issues . . . are indeed complex and for this 
reason are not especially suited for resolution by a jury""); With Bernstein v. Universal Pictures, Inc., 79 F.R.D. 59, 70 
(S.D.N.Y.1978) (matter is ""beyond the ability and competence of any jury to understand and decide with rationality"")."
712,73," See Note, Ross v. Bernhard: The Uncertain Future of the Seventh Amendment, 81 Yale L.J. 112, 128-29 (1971). Decisions in 
which the Supreme Court has explicitly prescribed multi-pronged ""tests"" provide examples of the kinds of rules that there might 
be, and a contrast to the absence, in Ross, of any such rule defining the role of each ""prong"" in the test. In Committee for Public Education and Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U.S. 756, 93 S. Ct. 2955, 37 L. Ed. 2d 948 (1973), the 
Court enumerated the three factors relevant in determining whether a government program violates the establishment clause: 
""To pass muster under the Establishment Clause the law in question first must reflect a clearly secular legislative purpose . . ., 
second, must have a primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion . . ., and, third, must avoid excessive government 
entanglement with religion . . . ."" Id., at 773, 93 S. Ct. at 2965. Accord, e.g., Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U.S. 349, 358, 95 S. Ct. 
1753, 44 L. Ed. 2d 217 (1975); Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 91 S. Ct. 2105, 29 L. Ed. 2d 745 (1971). Although this test 
does not set ""the precise limits to the necessary constitutional inquiry,"" Meek, supra, 421 U.S. at 358-59, 95 S. Ct. 1753, See id., 
at 373-74, 95 S. Ct. 1753 (Brennan, J., concurring and dissenting), the language used by the Court makes clear that a law or 
government program which fails Any of these three ""prongs"" is invalid. A different type of rule was used in Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 92 S. Ct. 2182, 33 L. Ed. 2d 101 (1972). There the Court held 
that the question of deprivation of the Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial was to be determined by balancing four factors: 
""Length of delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant's assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant."" Id., at 530, 92 
S. Ct. at 2192. Because the test prescribed is a ""balancing"" test, ""none of the four factors identified above (is) either a necessary 
or sufficient condition to the finding of a deprivation of the right of speedy trial."" Id., at 533, 92 S. Ct. at 2193. A third type of test prescribes one or more factors which are normally dispositive, and one or more others to be used only if the 
first level of the test yields no result. Examples of this type are rules permitting the presiding officer in a legislative body to vote 
only to break a tie and rules in athletic leagues for determining which team is ""champion"" when the won-lost records produce a 
tie for first place. Some tests of this sort prescribe a factor or set of factors (themselves to be ordered by some rule) which are 
sufficient but not necessary for membership in a given category. Examples are the rules for Per se antitrust violations and the 
SEC's ""safe harbor"" rules. There are doubtless other types of rules as well, and endless variations and combinations of the types 
described here. The courts in the Boise Cascade, U. S. Financial, Bernstein, and ILC cases struck the jury demands on the strength of the third 
factor listed in the Ross dictum, without regard to the other two. Although this approach could be consistent with any of the three 
types of tests just described, it probably indicates an assumption that the test was like the test in Nyquist that the ""equitable"" 
nature of Any of the factors was sufficient to mandate a non-jury trial. But such an assumption is without support in Ross itself, 
and seems to fly in the face of Fleitmann, which held that a defendant may not be deprived of his right to a jury determination of 
treble damage claims in spite of the ""equitable"" nature of derivative actions. At least one court seems to regard the Ross dictum as prescribing a kind of balancing test. See Radial Lip Machine, Inc. v. 
International Carbide Corp., 76 F.R.D. 224, 227 (N.D.Ill.1977) (""The three Ross criteria are guides for determining whether a 
claim typically has a sufficient quantum of legal elements so that it must be tried to a jury.""). But a balancing approach to these 
Seventh Amendment questions is also without warrant in Ross or in other cases and, at least as an approach to an entire case, 
has been rejected by the modern cases. "
713,," The relation of the third Ross factor to the other two (and of the first two to each other) may, of course, be determined by 
reference to history. But to do so is to jettison any claim that the Ross footnote authorizes a departure from the historical test. 
And, as we have already determined, the history of jury practice and of Seventh Amendment adjudication provide no support for 
the deprivation of the jury trial right in all cases deemed ""too difficult"" for juries."
713,74," Cf.  Community Broadcasting of Boston v. FCC, 178 U.S.App.D.C. 256, 261, 546 F.2d 1022, 1027 (1976) (""A rule allowing 
interlocutory appeals (from orders denying motions to disqualify counsel on ethical grounds) would provide litigants with yet 
another device by which to delay final determination on the merits, and would lead the court to divert its attention from the 
central issues in the case.""); Melamed v. ITT Continental Baking Co., 592 F.2d 290 (6th Cir. 1979). In spite of the potential for 
abuse, interlocutory review may be desirable because of the importance of jury trial and the likelihood that erroneous decisions 
to strike juries would necessitate retrials. We note that the courts in the Boise Cascade, U. S. Financial, and Bernstein cases 
certified their orders for interlocutory review pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1292(b). Should a trial court decline such certification in an 
effort to move the case along, ""the right to grant mandamus to require jury trial where it has been improperly denied is settled.""

713,75," In Hyde Properties v. McCoy, 507 F.2d 301 (6th Cir. 1974), the jury demand was struck after trial, and only as to certain 
issues deemed equitable by the court of appeals; the jury's verdict on a breach of contract issue was not challenged. The court 
recognized the need to deal separately with the legal and equitable issues presented in a single case.  Id., at 303, n. 1. Because 
the jury demand in Hyde was struck after trial and because the trial lasted only four days the court was not as concerned with 
the size of the litigation and the length of trial as were the courts in ILC, Bernstein, U. S. Financial, and Boise Cascade."
713,76," See pp. 911-913, Supra. "
714,77," The Court in Beacon Theatres did indicate that ""only under the most imperative circumstances, circumstances which in view 
of the flexible procedures of the Federal Rules we cannot now anticipate, . . . the right to a jury trial of legal issues (might) be lost 
through prior determination of equitable claims."" 359 U.S. at 510-11, 79 S. Ct. at 957. Such circumstances have since arisen, if 
at all, only in Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322, 99 S. Ct. 645, 58 L. Ed. 2d 552 (1979) (defendant in private damage 
suit may be estopped from relitigating before jury issues adversely determined in prior SEC injunctive action, where no jury was 
available), and Katchen v. Landy, 382 U.S. 323, 86 S. Ct. 467, 15 L. Ed. 2d 391 (1966) (Bankruptcy Court in summary

Court, experts are available only as witnesses or special masters. See Rule 53, Fed.R.Civ.P.; Rule 706, Fed.R.Ev."
714,80," Judge Higginbotham also demonstrates that the abandonment of the civil jury in England, widely believed to be a recognition 
of its inefficiency, actually resulted from manpower shortages during the two World Wars, and the inertial failure to do anything to

715,81," We do not intend by this reference to intimate a view on the issues raised by defendants' motion for summary judgment in 
which it is alleged that the predatory intent question must now be decided in favor of defendants as a matter of law on the 
developed record."
715,82," The need for improved techniques in managing jury trials of complex antitrust litigation has recently received attention from a 
Presidential Commission, and we note with interest their suggestions: Even if the role of juries in some antitrust cases is limited, juries will continue to try many antitrust cases, including some that 
cannot be considered simple, and a number of innovative techniques can help juries understand those cases better. It has 
proved useful for courts to instruct the jury on the relevant legal issues at the beginning of trial as well as at the end. It may also 
be useful for courts to refresh juries on the factual and legal relationships of the different parts of the trial, such as evidence and 
argument on the ""relevant"" market. Counsel may assist the jury's early understanding of the case by giving more comprehensive "
716,," and focused opening statements. If the case is to be submitted on interrogatories, a preliminary set of interrogatories may be 
given to the jury at the start of the trial. These procedures collectively should facilitate the jury's understanding and assessment 
of the evidence presented. The parties might provide the jurors with a binder containing important exhibits. During trial, the expanded use of visual aids may 
contribute to ready comprehension. Jurors may be permitted to take notes during trial and the exhibits, trial transcript (if ready), 
and jury instructions can be made available in the jury room during deliberations. Counsel should also evaluate the utility of 
preparing summaries of the evidence for the jury's use. Report to the President and the Attorney General of the National Commission for the Review of Antitrust Laws and Procedures

716,83," This due process argument was the basis for the decision in In re Boise Cascade Securities Litigation, 420 F. Supp. 99, 104 
(W.D.Wash.1976), in which the court specifically related the Ross footnote's mention of ""the practical abilities and limitations of 
juries"" to considerations of fairness and due process. As part of their ""due process"" argument, the defendants contend that the anticipated length of the trial makes it impossible to 
obtain a fair trial by jury: Because business people and professionals would have to be excused for cause pursuant to 28 U.S.C.

10 Conn.L.Rev. 775 (1978). The student Comment presents a statistical analysis of the jury selection process in SCM Corp. v. 
Xerox Corp., 463 F. Supp. 983 (D.Conn.1978), showing that excuses for cause and peremptory challenges eliminated 
disproportionate numbers of prospective jurors who were employed in technical or managerial fields, who were male, or who had 
attended college. It may well be that factors of ""undue hardship or extreme inconvenience,"" 28 U.S.C. ยง 1866(c), will persuade the court to excuse 
many business executives and professionals, but this certainly does not mean that the defendants will be forced to submit their 
case to a jury selected from society's incompetents and misfits. Moreover, the factors justifying excuse from jury service will have to be reassessed in light of the Jury System Improvements Act 
of 1978, P.L. 95-572, 92 Stat. 2453 (1978). Congress recognized that economic hardship to jurors threatened the statutory 
policy of providing to all litigants the right to juries ""selected at random from a fair cross-section of the community in that judicial 
district,"" and sought in the 1978 Act to correct that problem. H.R.Rep.No.95-1652, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. (1978), U.S.Code Cong. 
& Admin.News 1978, pp. 5477, 5479. The Act increases jurors' compensation to $ 30 per day for the first thirty days of service 
and $ 35 per day thereafter, and also increases travel allowances. The Act also protects employees from intimidation, coercion, 
or discharge as a result of their jury service, and guarantees the resumption of their employment rights without loss of seniority, 
as if they had been on furlough or leave of absence. Finally, the Act defines the terms ""undue hardship or extreme 
inconvenience"" as they are used in 28 U.S.C. ยง 1866(c) to mean: . . . great distance, either in miles or travel-time, from the place of holding court, grave illness in the family or any other 
emergency which outweighs in immediacy and urgency the obligation to serve as a juror when summoned, or any other factor 
which the court determines to constitute an undue hardship or to create an extreme inconvenience to the juror; and in addition, 
in situations where it is anticipated that a trial or grand jury proceeding may require more than thirty days of service, the court 
may consider, as a further basis for temporary excuse, severe economic hardship to an employer which would result from the 
absence of a key employee during the period of such service; . . ."
716,28," U.S.C. ยง 1869(j). Thus, the Act necessarily limits the number of prospective jurors who might be excused from service in this 
case because of economic hardship to themselves or their families. We therefore expect that the pool from which the jury is 
drawn will include a fair number of people of considerable sophistication and intelligence, drawn from the ranks of the employed 
as well as from those men and women who have chosen not to have a ""job"" or who are retired or unemployed. "
717,," Moreover, it is clear that the right to trial by jury does not include the right to have any particular number of economics professors 
or bankers on the jury. The Supreme Court has described the requirements of due process and the Sixth Amendment in criminal 
trials: It should also be emphasized that in holding that petit juries must be drawn from a source fairly representative of the community 
we impose no requirement that petit juries actually chosen must mirror the community and reflect the various distinctive groups 
in the population. Defendants are not entitled to a jury of any particular composition, Fay v. New York, 332 U.S. 261, 284, 67 S. 
Ct. 1613, 1625, 91 L. Ed. 2043 (1947); Apodaca v. Oregon, 406 U.S. (404, 92 S. Ct. 1628, 32 L. Ed. 2d 184), at 413, 92 S. Ct. at 
1634 (plurality opinion); but the jury wheels, pools of names, panels, or venires from which juries are drawn must not 
systematically exclude distinctive groups in the community and thereby fail to be reasonably representative thereof. Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U.S. 522, 538, 95 S. Ct. 692, 702, 42 L. Ed. 2d 690 (1975). Whatever due process may require in the 
civil context, it cannot be more than is required in criminal trials by the Sixth Amendment's guarantee of ""an impartial jury""; 
certainly here there is no threat of systematic exclusion of distinctive groups in the community. The legislative policy declared in 
28 U.S.C. ยง 1861 goes no further, though its requirements could not in any event overcome the clear command of the Seventh 
Amendment. See Comment, Supra, 10 Conn.L.Rev. at 783 n. 27. Finally, even if defendants' ""cross-section"" contentions had some merit, we think it would be premature to act on them at this 
time, rather than after the voir dire has reduced the element of speculation. See note 16, Supra. HN17[

718,84," Professor Calabresi therefore calls the jury an ""aresponsible agency."" See G. Calabresi & P. Bobbitt, Tragic Choices 57-79 
(1977)."

United States, 411 F.2d 139, 146 (3d Cir. 1969), and to do so with sufficient ""detail and exactness"" to facilitate appellate review.

18, Supra."
718,86," Mr. Justice Black, the author of the Court's opinions in Beacon Theatres and Dairy Queen, has been reported as suggesting, 
in conversation, ""that the jury system was accorded its prominence and protection in the Constitution because its aresponsibility 
allowed it to disregard legal rules when the rules produced results contrary to community standards, and its representativeness 
insured that it would do just that."" Calabresi & Bobbitt, Supra note 84, at 208 n. 12."
718,87," Our rejection of the notion that the Ross footnote prescribes the test for Seventh Amendment questions, Supra at 926-930, 
eliminates the need to parse each word and comma in it. Those who are so moved, however, might well consider the ""practical 
abilities"" of juries and not only their ""limitations."" "
719,88," Two of Wolfram's observations on the ratification debates are of interest here. First, the antifederalists' arguments showing 
the importance of the jury's ability to produce results that sometimes were at variance with the law were usually very indirect. 
Wolfram explains this as made necessary by the politics and the ""instincts of public morality"" of the time.  57 Minn.L.Rev., at 
703-05. Second, there were some ""scattered references"" during and after the debates to the utility of jury trials in particular types of 
cases, ""(b)ut none of these seem to have contemplated that these issues of utility could be evolved into a standard for 
determining the extent of the right to jury trial."" Id., at 718, 719. For some of these scattered references, See id., at 671 n. 86, 
719. A contemporaneous expression of the view that complex matters were properly tried in equity, without juries, may be found in 
The Federalist No. 83 (A. Hamilton): My convictions are equally strong that great advantages result from the separation of the equity from the law jurisdiction, and 
that the causes which belong to the former would be improperly committed to juries. The great and primary use of a court of 
equity is to give relief in Extraordinary cases, which are Exceptions * to general rules. To unite the jurisdiction of such cases with 
the ordinary jurisdiction, must have a tendency to unsettle the general rules, and to subject every case that arises to a Special 
determination; while a separation of the one from the other has the contrary effect of rendering one a sentinel over the other, and 
of keeping each within the expedient limits. Besides this, the circumstances that constitute cases proper for courts of equity are 
in many instances so nice and intricate, that they are incompatible with the genius of trials by jury. They require often such long, 
deliberate, and critical investigation as would be impracticable to men called from their occupations, and obliged to decide before 
they were permitted to return to them. The simplicity and expedition which form the distinguishing characters of this mode of trial 
require that the matter to be decided should be reduced to some single and obvious point; while the litigations usual in chancery 
frequently comprehend a long train of minute and independent particulars."
719,*," It is true that the principles by which that relief is governed are now reduced to a regular system; but it is not the less true that 
they are in the main applicable to SPECIAL circumstances, which form exceptions to general rules. PUBLIUS Id., at 549-550 (Mod. Library ed.) (emphasis in original). This argument is proposed by Hamilton in defense of the omission from 
the constitution of a right to jury trial in civil actions. Certainly the widespread opposition to the constitution expressed because of 
this omission, and the adoption of the Seventh Amendment in response thereto, represent a resounding rejection of Hamilton's 
conclusions; whether his premises were also rejected is not clear."
719,89," The concern for debtors was due in part to the provision in the 1783 treaty of peace with Great Britain ""that creditors on either 
side, shall meet with no lawful impediment to the recovery of the full value in sterling money, of all bona fide debts heretofore 
contracted."" Wolfram, Supra note 25, at 673-679 & n. 92. During the preconstitutional period, creditors from Britain or another of 
the states had to sue in the courts of the debtor's state ""where, under the protection of favorable local laws, the debtor might 
receive a sympathetic hearing before a jury composed of his friends and relatives."" Id., at 676. Several provisions in the new 
constitution, including those for federal diversity and alienage jurisdiction, were intended to provide some measure of relief for 
creditors. Id., at 677-78 & n. 95. Wolfram canvasses the ratification debates in each state, and concludes that ""concern for local debtors faced with the threat of 
suit in a federal court, without a jury, was one of the chief motivations for opposition to the Constitution."" Id., at 678. A good 
example is the remark with which Patrick Henry concluded a speech in the Virginia ratification convention: ""If previous 
amendments are not obtained, the trial by jury is gone. British debtors will be ruined by being dragged to the federal court, and 
the liberty and happiness of our citizens gone, never again to be recovered."" Id., at 691."
719,90," The power of a jury to disregard the court's instructions in accordance with the equities of the individual case or with what they 
thought the law should be had been rather dramatically demonstrated to colonial America in the celebrated libel trial of John "
720,," Peter Zenger in 1735. At the time, truth was no defense in a criminal libel case, and the jury was to determine only whether the 
defendant had published the allegedly libelous material; the presiding judge charged the jury that ""whether the words . . . make a 
libel . . . is a matter of law . . . which you may leave to the Court."" Alexander, A Brief Narrative of the Case and Trial of John 
Peter Zenger 100 (Katz ed. 1963). But Andrew Hamilton, perhaps the original ""Philadelphia lawyer,"" had argued eloquently to 
the jury that truth should be a defense to libel, and that a jury ""are by law at liberty . . . to find both the law and the fact . . .;"" the 
jury returned a general verdict of not guilty. Id., at 12-13, 23, 91-93, 101. Somewhat ironically, one of the ""libels"" for which 
Zenger was tried was ""that it seems trials by juries are taken away when a governor pleases."" Id., at 64. Although the Zenger trial was a criminal one, it seems to have contributed to ""a widespread popular conviction at the time of the 
adoption of the seventh amendment that a jury in a civil case (had) the right to ""decide the law'."" Compare Wolfram, Supra, at 
669 n. 84 With Henderson, The Background of the Seventh Amendment, 80 Harv.L.Rev. 289, 289-291, 327-335 (1966). The evidence from the ratification debates that the possibility of jury nullification was important to the antifederalists consists 
mainly of expressions ""that trial by jury is a safeguard against an oppressive exercise of the power of taxation."" Wolfram, Supra, 
at 705-709. The words are Alexander Hamilton's in The Federalist No. 83, used to describe an antifederalist argument which he 
goes on to rebut by pointing out, Inter alia, that in most states summary procedures of distress and sale were available to collect 
taxes without a jury trial. Id., at 705 n. 183. But cf.  Damsky v. Zavatt, 289 F.2d 46 (2d Cir. 1961) (In 1791 in England, taxes 
could be collected in action of debt, which carried right to jury trial). And Hamilton himself argues that the possibility of disregard 
of the law makes prize cases especially unsuitable for determination by juries: Juries cannot be supposed competent to investigations that require a thorough knowledge of the laws and usages of nations; 
and they will sometimes be under the influence of impressions which will not suffer them to pay sufficient regard to those 
considerations of public policy which ought to guide their inquiries. There would of course be always danger that the rights of 
other nations might be infringed by their decisions, so as to afford occasions of reprisal and war. Though the proper province of 
juries be to determine matters of fact, yet in most cases legal consequences are complicated with fact in such a manner as to 
render a separation impracticable. Hamilton, The Federalist No. 83, at 548-49 (Mod. Lib. ed.). A clear statement of the power of nullification may be found in Chief Justice John Jay's charge to the jury in Georgia v. 
Brailsford, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 1, 1 L. Ed. 483 (1794), a jury trial in the Court's original jurisdiction arising on a feigned issue in an 
equity case, and tried to a ""special jury"": It may not be amiss, here, gentlemen, to remind you of the good old rule, that on questions of fact, it is the province of the jury, 
on questions of law, it is the province of the court, to decide. But it must be observed, that by the same law, which recognizes 
this reasonable distribution of jurisdiction, you have, nevertheless, a right to take upon yourselves to judge of both, and to 
determine the law as well as the fact in controversy. On this, and on every other occasion, however, we have no doubt, you will 
pay that respect which is due to the opinion of the court: for as, on the one hand, it is presumed, that juries are the best judges of 
facts; it is, on the other hand, presumable, that the court are the best judges of law. But still, both objects are lawfully within your 
power of decision. Id., at 4 (footnotes omitted). "
721,91," Holmes himself seems to have had a rather Hamiltonian view of juries; he looked forward to the day when the ""democratic 
verdict of the jury"" might eventually be replaced by ""the commercial and rational test of the judgment of a man trained to decide."" 
Id., at 445. And his view, expressed with only a touch of sarcasm, was that . . . every time that a judge declines to rule whether certain conduct is negligent or not he avows his inability to state the law, and 
the meaning of leaving nice questions to the jury is that while if a question of law is pretty clear we can decide it, as it is our duty 
to do, if it is difficult it can be decided better by twelve men taken at random from the street. Id., at 457. An example of the classic Holmes-Knowlton debate on the relative merits of simple or per se liability rules which can 
be applied by courts ""as a matter of law"" against those of more complex rules which require a jury, is Lorenzo v. Wirth, 170 
Mass. 596, 49 N.E. 1010 (1898) (Holmes, J.); Id., 49 N.E. at 1011 (Knowlton, J., dissenting). For discussions of this choice, See

721,93," Indeed, in view of the jury's role as a check on judicial power, it ""might be thought to be particularly inappropriate . . . for the 
federal courts to claim a broad and loosely structured power to determine whether this civilian check on their own functioning 
should be interposed."" Wolfram, Supra at 644. "

legislative history of this statute make clear that in 1976 Congress believed that consumers have a cause of action under ยง 4, 
which the statute authorizes the states to assert in a parens patriae capacity.  See, e. g., 15 U. S. C. ยงยง 15c (a)(1), 15c

777,1, CalComp has dropped its ยง 1 claim on this appeal. 
778,2," Although the district court may direct a verdict either against the party who does not bear the burden of persuasion or the party 
who does bear that burden, the amount of evidence required for a directed verdict differs. The party seeking a directed verdict 
must make a stronger showing of evidence if he bears the burden of persuasion. See United California Bank v. THC Financial 
Corp., 557 F.2d 1351, 1356 (9th Cir. 1977); Juhnke v. EIG Corp., 444 F.2d 1323, 1325 (9th Cir. 1971); Comment, ""Directing the 
Verdict in Favor of the Party with the Burden of Proof,"" 50 N.C.L.Rev. 843 (1972). Thus directed verdicts for defendants are 
more frequent than for plaintiffs. See C. Wright, Federal Courts 464 (3d ed. 1976)."
778,3," This test is a hybrid of the so-called ""new trial"" and ""most favorable evidence"" tests. Shortly after the power of the federal 
courts to grant directed verdicts consistently with the seventh amendment was established in Galloway v. United States, 319 
U.S. 372, 63 S. Ct. 1077, 87 L. Ed. 1458 (1943), two polar tests were proposed for determining whether the evidence in a 
particular case is sufficient to warrant a directed verdict against the bearer of the persuasion burden. The first, the ""setting aside"" 
or ""new trial"" test, permitted a directed verdict against the party with the burden of persuasion if the judge, looking at All the 
evidence, both favorable and unfavorable, determined that he would be duty bound to set aside a verdict for that party. In the 
second, the ""most favorable evidence"" test, the court was to consider only the evidence favorable to the party with the 
persuasion burden, completely disregarding all unfavorable evidence, and determine whether a reasonable jury, viewing the 
evidence in the light most favorable to that party, could find every essential part in that party's favor. If it could not, a directed 
verdict for the other party would be proper. See McBaine, ""Trial Practice: Directed Verdicts; Federal Rule,"" 31 Calif.L.Rev. 454, 
460-61 (1943). The principal differences between these polar tests were that the ""setting aside"" test involved passing upon the 
credibility of witnesses and weighing contradictory evidence, while the ""most favorable evidence"" test did not; and the former test 
permitted consideration of all the evidence, while the latter did not. "
779,4," That directed verdicts in antitrust cases have not been ""generally disapproved"" is evident from the fact that Santa Clara Valley, 
like Syufy, Janich Brothers, Cleary and Chisholm Brothers, affirmed a directed verdict in favor of the antitrust defendant. In "

is a necessary element of the completed offense of ยง 2 monopolization but is not necessary for attempt, it follows that the same 
conduct may provide a basis for the monopolization offense and yet be excluded as a basis for the attempt offense. This is so 
since a defendant's monopoly power or lack thereof is part of the ""reasonableness"" calculus; conduct reasonable for other firms 
is not necessarily reasonable for the monopolist. "

784,16," CalComp also claims that prior to IBM's price cuts on disk products, it offset losses on CPUs with ""monopolistic profits"" from 
its then high-priced disk equipment. Even if we were to accept that CalComp's evidence was sufficient to go to a jury on the 
issue of whether such an antitrust violation occurred, a directed verdict would still be required because of the lack of any 
showing of causal injury. CalComp did not introduce substantial evidence (and indeed, would have had difficulty if it had 
attempted to do so) that it was ""injured in (its) business or property by reason of"" IBM's High prices on disk products.  15 U.S.C. 
ยง 15. Cf.  Greyhound Computer Corp. v. IBM Corp., 559 F.2d at 499 (""Greyhound can hardly complain of IBM's increase in its 
rental rates for main frame equipment, since this change could only work to the advantage of leasing companies"")."
784,17," CalComp quoted the chief financial officer of IBM's Data Processing Group as saying, ""(w)e have strategically put ourselves 
into a weak position as a result of IBM's very high profit on disk products."" CalComp's Chairman stated that IBM's loss of disk 
products business ""was heading straight toward 100%, like in two or three years,"" and that IBM ""had to react because they were 
losing so much business that no other choice was open to them. I wouldn't call that a punitive reaction. I'd call it a defense of 
market position."" Another of CalComp's witnesses, a securities analyst who followed the computer industry in general and IBM in 
particular, testified that IBM ""was facing very strong competition in the marketplace"" from plug-compatible manufacturers, and 
that there was ""an acceleration in terms of migration to non-IBM equipment."" The same witness had earlier described IBM's disk 
price cuts in one of his reports as ""dropping the traditional price umbrella for drive manufacturers."" Still another CalComp 
witness, a former IBM employee, testified that if IBM had not responded to the ""accelerating"" competition for peripheral 
equipment sales, it would have lost ""most or all"" of this business. "
785,18," Other evidence indicated that by reducing the price of the system, the 2319A also helped IBM in competing with systems 
manufacturers such as RCA."
785,19," IBM's evidence was that the profit on each of its disk products was greater than 20% Of revenue before taxes, and that the 
2319A in particular was expected to yield a profit of 33%. In its Amicus brief, Memorex Corp., another peripheral products manufacturer, contended that IBM's cost accounting system is 
too ""inexact"" to rely on for such determinations of profitability. Its argument is that by allocating the fixed cost burden for a 
particular product in part according to the product's revenues, ""costs"" are artificially reduced when a product's price is cut, and 
hence profitability is artificially increased. The evidence at trial, however, supports the single conclusion that IBM indeed fairly 
expected significant profits from its disk products even after price reductions. In response to IBM's price cuts, CalComp and 
other manufacturers reduced their prices again below IBM's, with the effect that, according to CalComp, they ""received much 
smaller profit margins"" as opposed to incurring losses. CalComp's own evidence established that prior to its price cuts, IBM's 
projected profits on its disk products ranged from 47% To 58%. In addition, IBM's evidence on profitability that Memorex 
challenges consisted of its internal calculations relied on at the time the decision to go forward with each product was made. As 
one of CalComp's experts testified, profit expectations at announcement or introduction of a product at a particular price are the 
primary consideration in analyzing a firm's pricing behavior. Finally, there is Absolutely no evidence that IBM priced its disk 
products below marginal cost, which ordinarily is required to show predatory pricing as a means of obtaining or maintaining a 
monopoly in violation of ยง 2. See Janich Brothers, Inc. v. American Distilling Co., 570 F.2d at 855-58, and text Infra."
785,20," CalComp argues on appeal that IBM's failure to cut prices on existing disk products for use with System 360 CPUs to the 
level of the 2319B constituted ""discrimination."" Since the 2319B ""retread"" was available to all IBM System 360 users, however, 
this fact is of little consequence."
785,21, See note 17 Supra.
785,22," See note 19 Supra. IBM's evidence was that the 2319B was expected to return a profit before taxes equal to 32% Of 
revenues."
785,23," According to CalComp's Chairman, CalComp, like other plug-compatible manufacturers, generally had to offer discounts from 
the systems manufacturers' prices in order to convince users to take their copy instead of the original."
785,24," CalComp introduced evidence of IBM studies reviewed by IBM management shortly before the announcement of FTP that 
included an analysis of the extent to which two of IBM's competitors, Telex and Memorex, could afford to increase manufacturing 
and sales volume and reduce prices on disk products. In particular, the studies concluded that Memorex would remain viable 
despite IBM's introduction of its 2319 disk drives, and that by 1976 IBM would lose 28.8% Of the plug compatible disk market. 
IBM's financial group also reported, however, that if Memorex achieved 60% Of the plug-compatible disk market, such rapid 
growth in marketing overhead and working capital requirements would require substantial additional financing particularly if 
Memorex met IBM price cuts in the area of 17%-22%. The obvious concern in these reports to management was the increasing gains by peripheral manufacturers and the lengths to 
which price competition by Memorex in particular might be carried. Accepting CalComp's inferences from this evidence, FTP "
786,," was a direct response to these competitor gains, and the level of FTP price cuts was determined by IBM's estimation of the 
extent of its competitors' willingness to lower prices still further."
786,25," CalComp's argument that ISC and IFA, by placing part of the control function ""inboard,"" were designed solely to preclude 
plug-compatible manufacturers from part of the controller market is discussed under the heading ""Design Changes"" Infra."
786,26," CalComp attributed its price reductions and consequent lost revenues solely to the 2319B and FTP price reductions. We need 
not discuss the resultant question of causation with respect to IBM's other price cuts in view of our result. "
787,27," ""Marginal cost"" refers to the variable cost of the last unit of output, while ""average variable cost,"" appropriately, refers to the 
average variable cost of all units. See Janich Brothers, 570 F.2d at 857 n.8, 858 n.11. Hanson determined that ""because 
marginal cost is often impossible to ascertain"" average variable cost was a sufficient judicial surrogate, 541 F.2d at 1358; Janich 
Brothers concurred that ""average variable cost is likely to approximate marginal cost."" 570 F.2d at 858. Given the variation in 
cost accounting systems among business firms and the likelihood of the significant differences in capacity utilization from case to 
case, we expect that acceptance of this rule of thumb would first require careful scrutiny of the particular facts in a case where 
the defendant's prices are very near average variable cost. That is not the case here. "
788,28," Unlike the 2319A, the 2319B introduced for use with all System 360 models attached to IBM's 2314 stand-alone controller."
788,29," The System 370 Models 158 and 168 also featured substantial minimum memory integrated within the CPU. CalComp 
claimed that this redesign injured add-on memory manufacturers by making it impossible for them to compete for the integrated 
portion of these models' memories."
788,30," This same witness reported that the inclusion of a minimum memory capacity within the CPU was made possible by the 
reduction in memory size, ""reflecting the product evolution from relatively large magnetic cores to high density semi-conductor 
packaging."" He continued: As the basic cycle speed of the memory increases, it becomes important to minimize the distance between components. It may 
well be impractical to keep the new memories external to the processor . . . . "

dealing with a different record developed from the same underlying facts, the district court found with respect to IFA and ISC that 
there had been a ""preponderant showing that these integrations represented a legitimate technological and performance 
advance consistent with trends in the industry and at significant decreased cost."" No appeal was taken from this ruling. "
790,32," In its Telex decision, the Tenth Circuit held that IBM's conduct in this regard was not violative of ยง 2, focusing on the 
profitability of both the CPU and FTP prices rather than on IBM's possible motivation. Regardless of intent, the court implied, ยง 2 
condemns only the monopolist's ""use of monopoly power,"" and the facts in Telex showed that IBM's lowering peripheral prices 
and raising CPU prices was not a case of ""an economic giant (dropping) prices to a level where it is not receiving an adequate 
return and . . . instead (relying) on its reserves or other activities to continue producing and marketing the particular product.""

Court has strongly suggested that one harassing piece of litigation may be enough to invoke the protection of the antitrust laws 
under the California Motor Transport exception.  Vendo Co. v. Lektro-Vend Corp., 433 U.S. 623, 635 n.6, 652-53, 97 S. Ct.

adopted the same approach. Other courts may well view OMC's complaint in a different light and the plaintiff is entitled to act on 
that hope or expectation. Stated simply, the counts dismissed here were by no means dismissed as frivolous. See Outboard 
Marine Corp. v. Pezetel, supra, at 399-403, 408-09. "
799,12," .  The Supreme Court in Otter Tail, Supra, ordered a remand for a determination whether the lawsuits fell within the ""sham"" 
exception of California Motor Transport, decided after the district court's opinion. While it is true that the complaint in Otter Tail, 
to the extent that it is quoted in the district court's opinion, See 331 F. Supp. at 56, appears every bit as generally drafted as the 
Counterclaim here, the district court in that case was evidently under the impression, possibly correct at the time but certainly 
erroneous in light of California Motor Transport, that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine had no application to judicial proceedings 
such as state-court litigation. Now, it is clear that resort to the courts, even if taken with anti-competitive intent, is protected under 
the Noerr-Pennington doctrine."
799,13, .  Doc. 70 at 76-77. 
800,14," .  As Pezetel-Melex read California Motor Transport, the sham exception may be based on a variety of models including: (1) 
upon the perjury-fraud-bribery model, as alleged in Counterclaim P 17; (2) upon an assertion that the conspirators participated in 
agency or court action with little or no interest in obtaining government action but simply to harass, a purely ""sham"" undertaking 
as described by the Supreme Court in Noerr, Supra ; (3) upon the charge that the antitrust plaintiff was excluded in a literal 
sense from the administrative forum that would lead to participation in a market, See California Motor Transport, Supra, so that 
the government merely acted as an unwitting surrogate for the conspirators. Doc. 70 at 69-71."
800,15," .  Even more factually apposite is the Supreme Court's own opinion in Walker Process Equipment, Inc. v. Food Machinery & 
Chemical Corp., 382 U.S. 172, 86 S. Ct. 347, 15 L. Ed. 2d 247 (1965), in which the counterclaim in a patent infringement action 
alleged that the plaintiff had obtained the patent by knowing and willful misrepresentations before the Patent Office. The Court 
held that such fraud, if proven in combination with the necessary market power, would violate ยง 2 of the Sherman Act. Of course, 
competitors possess no right of access to Patent Office initial patent application proceedings and thus in a limited sense, Walker 
Process does OMC no harm on its access argument. In that case, however, the Supreme Court rejected the argument made 
here that if misconduct occurred in the agency, the agency itself must rectify the error and the antitrust court cannot intervene: The trial court dismissed its suit not because Walker failed to allege the relevant market, the dominance of the patented device 
therein, and the injurious consequences to Walker of the patent's enforcement, but rather on the ground that the United States 
alone may ""annul or set aside"" a patent for fraud in procurement. The trial court has not analyzed any economic data. Indeed, no 
such proof has yet been offered because of the disposition below. In view of these considerations, as well as the novelty of the 
claim asserted and the paucity of guidelines available in the decided cases, this deficiency cannot be deemed crucial. Id. at 178, 86 S. Ct. at 351. "
801,16," .  The commentators agree with defendants' reading of California Motor Transport : As compared with the legislative process, improper behavior in the adjudicatory or judicial context is more readily identified as 
improper and more widely regarded as reprehensible. To be sure, adjudication explicitly relies on the adversary process to 
develop ""truth"" and thus might seem to expect, and therefore to excuse, overstatements or even misstatements by a party. In 
fact, however, the expected standards of conduct are much higher. The Supreme Court recognized this by observing, for 
example, ""Misrepresentations, condoned in the political arena, are not immunized when used in the adjudicatory process."" 
Indeed, there are well developed and highly elaborated definitions of what is or is not proper behavior by litigating parties. . . . 
HN7[
] There certainly is no privilege for misrepresentations to administrative agencies which base their decisions on 
information provided by the parties. Antitrust Law I, supra, P 204, at 48 (footnotes omitted)."
801,17," .  In the case's present posture, no record has been made regarding the internal procedures of the Treasury Department both 
in general and with respect to the particular proceeding in which the misconduct is alleged to have occurred. Of course, the 
administrative law applicable to the proceeding involved is a question of law, inquiry into which could be made on a motion to 
dismiss; still, a question of fact would remain regarding the particular agency proceeding collaterally challenged here. "
802,18, .  See notes 3-5 Supra and accompanying text.
802,19," .  As the discussion regarding ""sham"" litigation demonstrated, OMC's avoidance of dismissal of its federal-court claim here 
weighed heavily in favor of dismissal of Pezetel-Melex's charge that virtually identical federal-court complaints were harassing. 
The apparent inconsistency in these two positions is explained by the allegation that knowingly false information was considered 
by the Treasury Department, a charge which, if proven, would undermine the validity of any agency action taken in reliance upon 
the information. "
803,20," .  It is emphasized, however, that this holding is perfectly in accord with the position of Areeda and Turner, much pressed by 
Outboard Marine, that unfair competition of the sort alleged by the Counterclaim should generally be ignored in the antitrust 
forum. Antitrust Law III, supra, P 737, at 278. First, as defendants argue, the suggestion of the authors that business 
disparagement of rivals should ""presumptively be ignored,"" necessarily contemplates that the charge survive a motion to 
dismiss. Otherwise, the result would be to completely exclude such charges from the antitrust realm. Second, to permit the 
defendants to proceed with the claim does not relieve them of a formidable burden of proof."
803,21," .  Of course, if defendants did prevail on their claim that OMC submitted knowingly false information to the Treasury, then some 
overlap in the market effect (i. e., damages) flowing from the two courses of conduct would probably exist. "
812,1," .  Berkey had charged several other violations that are not before us on this appeal. During the liability trial, Berkey withdrew or 
the court dismissed claims under the Clayton Act, ยงยง 3 & 7, 15 U.S.C. ยงยง 14 & 18, as well as allegations arising from some of 
Kodak's early acquisitions, its use of patents, its relations with Polaroid Corp., and its other activities in the instant photography 
field. Despite jury findings of ยง 2 liability, Berkey did not attempt to prove damages with respect to color negative printers and 
chemicals, and the jury found no damages with respect to amateur movie cameras. Kodak's purchases of flashcubes, 
magicubes, and flipflash arrays led to a $ 245,100 jury verdict under the Robinson-Patman Act, ยง 2(f), 15 U.S.C. ยง 13(f), which 
was set aside by Judge Frankel because there was no evidence of injury to Berkey. "
813,2," .  More complicated cameras, such as those in the 135 format (""35-millimeter"") commonly used by professionals and 
photographic hobbyists, were found not to be part of this market. The jury also rejected Kodak's request to include in the 
definition ""instant"" cameras, pioneered by the Polaroid Corporation, which produce a finished print within minutes, or even 
seconds, after the shutter is snapped."
813,3," .  Instant-loading cameras are not to be confused with the ""instant"" cameras referred to in the previous footnote."
813,4," .  In 1967 Berkey acquired a manufacturer of amateur photographic accessories, the Atlas-Warner Corp., along with three 
distributors of Atlas-Warner products."
813,5," .  Berkey entered into the manufacture of instant cameras in 1972, but discontinued this line in settlement of patent litigation 
instituted by Polaroid Corp. "
814,6," .  The jury included movie film and 35-millimeter film in this market, presumably because they are substantially identical to the 
film used in amateur still cameras. Instant film, however, a product chemically distinct from laboratory-processed film, was 
excluded."
814,7," .  Kodak marketed improved versions of Kodacolor in 1945, 1949, and 1955."
814,8," .  The new film was also initially sold for use in 35-millimeter cameras, which are not part of the amateur market. It did not 
replace Kodacolor in the amateur 127 and 620 sizes until one year later. ""Film speed"" refers to an emulsion's sensitivity to light. 
Thus Kodacolor X as compared to its predecessor could produce acceptable images under markedly inferior lighting conditions."
814,9," .  To be sure, Kodak could not in this fashion control the market for color reprints production of additional prints from slides or 
negatives. Here it resorted to other tactics. By refusing to sell the special paper or chemicals necessary to produce such reprints 
to rival photofinishers, it ensured since there was no other adequate source for these supplies that even this segment of the 
market did not escape its grip. "
815,10," .  Prior to 1954 a small part of Berkey's business consisted of processing Anscocolor film manufactured by a rival of Kodak's, 
Ansco into both slides and color prints. Using paper and chemicals supplied by Ansco, Berkey was also able to produce color 
prints from Kodachrome slides. "
816,11," .  See our discussion of the relevant markets, Part I Supra. Kodak sold approximately two-thirds of all amateur conventional still 
cameras throughout most of the relevant period. The frequency with which flashlamp manufacturers approached Kodak with "
817,," suggestions for joint development of products and their willingness to acquiesce in arguably one-sided agreements is further 
evidence of Kodak's power in the camera market. See our discussion of Berkey's ยง 1 allegations, Part V Infra. The precipitous 
decline, beginning in 1976, of Kodak's share of the camera market was evidence that the jury could consider, although it was not 
dispositive. "
818,12," .  Nor is a lawful monopolist ordinarily precluded from charging as high a price for its product as the market will accept. True, 
this is a use of economic power; indeed, the differential between price and marginal cost is used as an indication of the degree 
of monopoly power, 2 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Supra, at 323-24; See Borden, Inc., 3Trade Reg. Rep. (CCH) P 21,490, at 21,502-
03 (FTC 1978). But high prices, far from damaging competition, invite new competitors into the monopolized market. See Part IV 
Infra. Excessive prices may, however, create an illegal ""price squeeze"" in another market. See Alcoa, supra, 148 F.2d at 438."
818,13," .  The jury rejected this contention, which was submitted to them Dubitante. "
819,14," .  That is, Alcoa sold ingot to rival sheetmakers at such a high price that it gained a distinct competitive advantage for its own 
sales of sheet."
819,15," .  We cannot accept Kodak's argument that, read literally, ยง 2 prevents a plaintiff from recovering unless there was at least an 
attempt to monopolize the market in which it claims to have been injured. Since monopoly power itself is the target of ยง 2, it is 
unreasonable to suggest that a firm that possesses such power in one market and uses it to damage competition in another 
does not ""monopolize"" within the meaning of the statute. "
820,16," .  Writing on March 9, 1967, Zwick saw ""no need"" for a new film, which would require a higher-temperature process: ""We can 
make Small improvements in Kodacolor X grain and sharpness, in a film which could go through the C-22 process."" On the 
same day, another Kodak scientist, N. H. Groet of the Color Photography Division, wrote that he was ""convinced that Project 30 
could go with the presently available Kodacolor X film."" Like Zwick, Groet conceded that a finer-grained film ""would be most 
welcome for P-30,"" but he did not believe that major changes in Kodacolor X would be necessary. Indeed, he believed that the 
new finishing process being considered by the Kodacolor Future System Committee would raise hell in the photofinishing business, would do little to decrease the cost of the operation, and that the ultimate 
customer would not benefit. "
821,17," .  Kodacolor II's grain, though disappointing, was clearly superior to that of Kodacolor X. Berkey does not appear to dispute the 
point. Shortly after introduction of the 110 system, a confidential memorandum prepared by a competitor in the film market 
compared Kodacolor II with Kodacolor X and found that the new film ""yields a less granular image structure and, therefore, 
better detail rendition in an enlarged color print."""
821,18," .  Three pre-existing Kodak films were, however, sold for other uses: Verichrome Pan for black-and-white snapshots, and 
Kodachrome X and Ektachrome X for color slides."
821,19," .  The jury found Kodak guilty of leveraging its monopoly power into the market for photofinishing chemicals, See note 1, Supra. 
Berkey withdrew this claim during the damages trial, citing its inability to obtain statistical proof of its own harm. "
822,20," .  Since the issue is not presented on this appeal, we need not express our view on whether some actions may be too complex 
to be tried to a jury. The relevant cases are canvassed in Note, The Right to a Jury Trial in Complex Civil Litigation, 92 
Harv.L.Rev. 898 (1979)."
822,21, .  See note 11 Supra. 
823,22, .  The same memorandum also recommended six-month predisclosure to competing film manufacturers. 
824,23, .  This is apparent from the transcript of the conference to settle the language of the charge to the jury.
824,24," .  Berkey's argument that Kodak considered predisclosing the 110 system, and so could not be surprised when found liable for 
failing to do so, is thus a two-edged sword. It illustrates the difficulties in prediction even when the problem has been squarely 
faced. "
825,25," .  The ""red-eye"" problem experienced by the early 110 models, See note 35 Infra, does not detract from the fact that the new 
camera was indeed smaller and more convenient than its predecessors. "
826,26," .  The Minox ""spy camera"" was even smaller, but substantially more expensive, than the 110."
826,27," .  Although Kodak does not manufacture cameras in the 135 format, it does sell film for them. This policy may represent a 
perception that the 135 format competes less directly with Kodak's popular cameras than do the Minolta and other miniature 
models."
826,28," .  Even if the format obstructed by Kodak were comparable to the 110, predisclosure would not be a necessary remedy, as the 
following example demonstrates. Suppose that Berkey, unaware that Kodak is planning to bring forth the 110 camera, asks 
Kodak to make film available for a new camera it has designed that happens to be identical in all respects to the 110 except that 
it requires a slightly different film format. Kodak, without a legitimate competitive reason and solely to prevent Berkey's camera "
827,," sales, declines to supply the film. Berkey then concludes that marketing of its new camera would be economically unfeasible. 
Just three months later, without predisclosure to Berkey, Kodak introduces the 110, which is a great commercial success. At first it might appear that in this extreme hypothetical case Berkey has a right to share the initial profits of the 110 camera 
through predisclosure. On closer examination, it becomes clear that the wrong to Berkey is not the absence of knowledge of the 
110 but exclusion from the market of its own essentially identical camera. To be sure, most of Kodak's 110 sales would have 
been captured earlier by Berkey had it not been prevented from introducing its camera, so the volume of Kodak's 110 sales may 
assist in computation of Berkey's damages. That, however, is the only relevance of the 110 system to this hypothetical case. As 
the premise is varied to bring the hypothetical closer to the actual case at bar for example, by attenuating the physical similarity 
between the two cameras or the proximity of their arrival in the market even this relevance disappears. Kodak's violation is 
completed when it blocks Berkey's new camera format; nothing is added to the offense by its decision to introduce its own new 
format without predisclosure."
827,29," .  The three 110 damages theories, submitted to the jury in the alternative, attempted to measure the displacement of Berkey 
camera sales from the moment the 110 system was introduced. One theory, allocating to Berkey its ""fair share"" of all Kodak 
post-introduction camera sales, indicated untrebled damages of $ 16,073,000. The other two theories, addressing 110 sales 
only, suggested $ 13,668,000 and $ 15,835,000 respectively. "
828,30," .  This is not to say, of course, that new product introductions are Ipso facto immune from antitrust scrutiny, and we do not 
agree with Kodak's argument that they are, See, e. g., Sargent-Welch Scientific Co. v. Ventron Corp., 567 F.2d 701 (7th Cir. 
1977), Cert. denied, 439 U.S. 822, 99 S. Ct. 87, 58 L. Ed. 2d 113 (1978) (use of power over old product to promote sale of new); 
in all such cases, however, it is not the product introduction itself, but some associated conduct, that supplies the violation."
828,31," .  To the extent that Berkey argues that Kodak's past monopolization of film hindered any other firm from introducing a new 
photographic system, the contention is merely a repetition of that rejected in Part III.A.1 Supra."
828,32, .  See note 16 Supra.
828,33," .  Testimony and documents introduced at trial indicated that Kodacolor II lost much of its ""speed"", See note 8, Supra, within 
three to six months of manufacture. In addition, there were problems with ""latent image keeping"" the ability of the film to retain a 
scene until the film was developed."
828,34, .  See note 17 Supra. 
829,35," .  ""Red-eye"" is the appearance of a red glint in the eye of the snapshot's subject on a picture taken with a flashlamp. It is a 
result in large part of the small distance between the flash device and the camera lens. Hence, it was a greater problem for the 
original 110 cameras than for their larger predecessors in the 126 format."
829,36, .  See note 42 Infra.
829,37," .  See 3 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Supra, at 41-42."
829,38," .  Similarly, it appears that the Pocket Instamatic spurred sales of Kodak's film at the expense of its competitors, despite a red-
eye problem that made the camera unacceptable to many consumers. But it would appear unreasonable on its face to allow a 
jury to conclude from this that the introduction of the 110 camera, which millions of other customers welcomed eagerly, was 
improper conduct."
829,39," .  Thus, the situation might be completely different if, upon the introduction of the 110 system, Kodak had ceased producing film 
in the 126 size, thereby compelling camera purchasers to buy a Kodak 110 camera. Or had Kodak shifted production in all 
formats from Kodacolor X to Kodacolor II before other photofinishers could process the new film, it would force photographers to 
procure their photofinishing services from CP&P. In such a case the technological desirability of the product change might bear 
on the question of monopolistic intent. See Response of Carolina, Inc. v. Leasco Response, Inc., 537 F.2d 1307, 1330 (5th Cir. 
1976)."
829,40," .  Indeed, Kodak apparently did precisely that in introducing the 110 camera. Aware of the camera's substantial red-eye 
problem, the firm evidently decided ""to provide enough ambient light for exposure without flash"" at the press conference 
announcing the new system. This rather obvious ploy certainly did not amount to the type of deception that might, as we indicate 
in the following footnote, support an action under ยง 2. "
830,41," .  There was evidence that Kodak indicated on the boxes in which Kodacolor II was sold that the film had a shelf life of 14 
months, whereas in fact the film lost half its speed within three to six months. We need not decide whether this action amounted 
to deceptive advertising, or whether and under what circumstances such deception might amount to a violation of ยง 2. See 3 P. 
Areeda & D. Turner, Supra, at 278-79. The Sherman Act is not a panacea for all evils that may infect business life. Before we 
would allow misrepresentation to buyers to be the basis of a competitor's treble damage action under ยง 2, we would at least 
require the plaintiff to overcome a presumption that the effect on competition of such a practice was De minimis. See id. Berkey, 
however, has failed to provide any evidence that a significant number of Kodak 110 purchasers would have, if the Kodacolor II 
boxes had included accurate information on the shelf life of the film, bought a Berkey camera in a pre-existing format instead."
830,42," .  We have already stated that in September 1967 Kodak's management noted that development of the new film was justified, 
even if Project 30 were never brought to fruition, because of the benefits it would yield to pre-existing formats. Kodak, however, 
tentatively decided at the same meeting that Kodacolor II would at first be sold in the 110 format only. See Part III.A Supra. 
Kodak's explanation for the initial restriction of Kodacolor II to the 110 size is that the advantages of the new film were most 
useful for small cameras; until the defects in Kodacolor II were eliminated, therefore, Kodak preferred to continue selling 
Kodacolor X in pre-existing formats. That Kodak did not advertise the restriction was evidence in support of its assertion that the 
plan was not undertaken for an anticompetitive purpose. "
831,43," .  Advertisements of dealers, like those of Kodak, emphasized that Kodacolor II would yield sharp pictures but not that the film 
was exclusively available in the 110 size."
831,44," .  Because of the extraordinary complexity of this case, we invited the parties to submit post-argument briefs on any aspect of 
the case they felt merited further attention."
831,45," .  But see Part V Infra, where we hold that Berkey's claim arising from the introduction of the ""flipflash"" in 1975, the damages for 
which were not considered separately but were included in the total computation of damages for lost 110 camera sales, must be 
submitted to a new trial on these damages only. "
832,46," .  Kodak also did not inform independent photofinishers, or even its own technical sales representatives assigned to help the 
independents process Kodak films, that there were two distinct ""populations"" of Kodacolor II with markedly different color 
characteristics. CP&P, however, was told of this divergence as soon as it was discovered."
832,47, .  See Part III.A Supra.
832,48, .  See id. 
833,49," .  See Part II.C. & n.13 Supra. Although Kodak was for a time the only firm able to finish Kodacolor II, and for a longer period 
the only company able to provide equipment for the C-41 process, the new process and the machinery used in it did not define 
separate markets; rather, they were, like Kodacolor II and the 110 camera itself, new entries in markets of wider scope. Kodak 
held a temporary monopoly in C-41 processing and equipment only in the sense that every firm initially possesses a 100% 
Market share in its own innovations and the peripheral products and services associated with it. See Telex Corp. v. International 
Business Machines Corp., 510 F.2d 894, 915 (10th Cir.), Cert. dismissed, 423 U.S. 802, 96 S. Ct. 8, 46 L. Ed. 2d 244 (1975) 
(endorsing district court statement)."
833,50," .  We do not, of course, intend to cast any doubt on the well-established doctrine, which we have reaffirmed, See Part II.B 
Supra, that certain actions may violate ยง 2 when taken by a monopolist even though they would be perfectly legitimate in the 
hands of a firm lacking market control. Rather, our consideration rests on a simple proposition: if an action that gains a firm a 
competitive advantage is effective because of the company's efficiency, prestige, and innovativeness, and not because of its 
control over the market, the action is not a use of power."
833,51," .  In 1972, fewer than one-tenth as many rolls of Kodacolor film were processed in the 110 format as were finished in the 126 
size, and CP&P processed only about 15% Of the 110 rolls. Even in 1973, photofinishers processed more than three times as 
many 126 Kodacolor rolls nearly all of it Kodacolor X as Kodacolor rolls in the 110 format, and CP&P's share in the 110 size fell 
to approximately 6%."
833,52," .  We do not hold that Kodak, which did not have a monopoly in photofinishing equipment, was required to provide such 
machinery for other photofinishers. But a violation might be found if Kodak's ability to market equipment at an excessive price 
was attributable to its monopoly power in other areas. "
834,53," .  Judge Frankel's opinion appears to contradict itself on this point. Compare Berkey Photo, Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 457 
F. Supp. 404, 425 (S.D.N.Y.1978) With id. at 433. "
835,54, .  See Part V Infra. 
837,55," .  If, as the Ninth Circuit has held in International Telephone & Telegraph Corp. v. General Telephone & Electronics Corp., 518 
F.2d 913, 922 (9th Cir. 1975), dissolution or divestiture may only be ordered in a Government suit a question that we of course 
do not reach the rule for which Kodak argues would be even less tolerable. "
838,56," .  To the extent that any inference may be gleaned from the extended Hanover Shoe litigation, it favors the wrongful conduct 
rule. After the Supreme Court affirmed Judge Wyzanski's judgment in the celebrated United Shoe case, Hanover, a United 
customer, brought an action to recover illegal overcharges. The calculation of Hanover's damages was based on ""the excess of 
leasing costs over what it would have cost to own the same machines had they been available for purchase,"" Hanover Shoe, 
Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 245 F. Supp. 258 (M.D.Pa.1965); See Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery 
Corp., 392 U.S. 481, 487, 88 S. Ct. 2224, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1231 (1968). Significantly, the hypothetical purchase prices for prior years 
were determined from the actual prices for 1955 the first year the lease-only machines were offered for sale and clearly, as later 
litigation would demonstrate, a period in which United retained its monopoly. See United States v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 
266 F. Supp. 328, 331 (D.Mass.1967), rev'd on other grounds, 391 U.S. 244, 88 S. Ct. 1496, 20 L. Ed. 2d 562 (1968). Moreover, 
United's anticompetitive leasing policy was only a partial source of its monopoly power; the other roots were, as Judge Wyzanski 
indicated in his original opinion, ""plainly beyond reproach."" 110 F. Supp. at 344. It appears, therefore, that damages in Hanover 
Shoe were limited to the price excess caused by United's wrongful conduct. "
839,57," .  The situation might be different in a Government equity action. It is interesting to note that Areeda and Turner would allow the 
break-up of a persistent monopoly in such a suit even in the absence of exclusionary conduct, 3 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Supra, 
at 63-64. They strongly advocate the position we are asserting here, however that ""an injured plaintiff is not entitled to have 
damages based on the excess of the monopoly price over the competitive price but only to the price increment reasonably 
attributable to actionable behavior."" Id. at 73; See id. at 99."
839,58," .  We express no view on how the trial judge should allocate the burden of proving this causal relation, or lack of it, when 
plaintiff makes a preliminary showing of persistent monopoly power and a substantial history of anticompetitive conduct. Cf.  
Ohio Valley Electric Corp. v. General Electric Co., 244 F. Supp. 914, 946 (S.D.N.Y.1965). "
840,59," .  The flashcube contains four flashbulbs mounted on the face of a small cube, each containing its own reflector. The cube is 
rotated after each shot, so four flash pictures may be taken without the need to change cubes."
840,60," .  Several other camera makers complained bitterly to Sylvania following this episode. They were particularly disturbed that 
Sylvania had assigned its camera patents to Kodak, keeping only its lamp patents. One Sylvania official wrote: Also during the past years the royalties other camera manufacturers have paid to EK to use Sylvania flashcubes on their 
equipment have disturbed them deeply. They keep telling us that the flashcube was a Sylvania development . . . why did they 
have to pay royalties? "
841,61," .  As Kodak's trial counsel conceded, there was conflicting evidence concerning the terms of the secrecy agreement. The 
written agreement permitted disclosure to ""other responsible camera manufacturers,"" but Sylvania never made disclosure to 
anyone but Polaroid, which only manufactured instant cameras and was thus not a competitor of Kodak's. In October 1968, 
Sylvania pressed Kodak for an early announcement to the trade, but Kodak resisted, in part to ""make sure that our foreign 
manufacturing plants could change to the new system."" Kodak then instituted a ""crash program"" to get to market before, as the 
jury could have found, Sylvania unilaterally decided to disclose its invention to the trade. In March 1970, Sylvania again complained to Kodak about delay, noting that rumors of the Kodak-Sylvania project had caused 
other camera manufacturers to press Sylvania for disclosure. Kodak agreed to a limited form of disclosure, but refused to permit 
release of, Inter alia, the design of the camera socket into which the magicube would fit."
841,62," .  In addition to the evidence adduced in connection with the 110 camera that Kodak had a policy of cyclical product 
introduction, a Kodak official testified that if the piezo would not be ready for the initial 110 introduction, Kodak could not use it 
for another two or three years."
841,63," .  For example, at a time when Kodak was committed to Sylvania and had shelved its own piezo plans, it complimented GE on 
its devices and urged them to continue development."
841,64," .  This device was a rectangular array of eight bulbs, set in four rows of two. The top four bulbs would be fired and the array 
would then be ""flipped"" and the remaining bulbs, now on top, would be used. "
842,65," .   United States v. Citizens & Southern National Bank, 422 U.S. 86, 95 S. Ct. 2099, 45 L. Ed. 2d 41 (1975), involved the 
antitrust implications of an attempt to evade Georgia's branch banking laws and has nothing to do with joint development 
ventures by firms in complementary markets."
842,66," .  Until 1962, Argus Camera was operated as a division of Sylvania. In May of that year, Sylvania sold Argus for a small amount 
of cash and $ 7.8 million in promissory notes. Over the next seven years, as a result of recapitalizations of Argus, Sylvania was, 
at various times, a major creditor, common shareholder, and preferred shareholder of its former division, on occasion placing a 
nominee on Argus's Board of Directors. Berkey contended that Sylvania's relationship with Argus permitted the jury to infer that 
the lamp manufacturer was a potential camera competitor as well. "
843,67," .  In particular, there was in each instance evidence that Kodak used its camera monopoly to extract secrecy agreements from 
the lamp manufacturers, and that the benefits it derived from the agreements far exceeded the value of its technological 
contributions. We note, in passing, that Kodak contends that Berkey should be barred from recovery because a Berkey official 
once told an officer of GE that Berkey was not interested in innovation, preferring to copy Kodak designs. The evidence 
concerning this conversation was conflicting, however, and we must assume the jury resolved the conflict in Berkey's favor. 
Accordingly, we need not determine the effect such a Berkey policy would have on its right to complain of Kodak's illicit 
agreements with the lamp makers. "
844,68," .  Kodak has waived its right to contest the charge on royalty-free licensing by failing to raise an objection below. Fed.R.Civ.P. 
51. "
845,69," .  By contrast, the jury awarded all but $ 4,000 of the claimed amount for 1970. "
848,70," .  A careful reading of the transcript reveals one brief interchange that was not relevant to Peck's own veracity, but only to that 
of Perkins himself. Peck was asked if he now was aware of the falsity of the representations Perkins made to Berkey that all the 
expert's papers had been destroyed. Peck replied that he did know this. Although we believe that the reference to Perkin's 
dissembling and Peck's present knowledge of it was immaterial, we do not think that this dialogue, or the reference to it in Mr. 
Stein's summation, was so prejudicial as to warrant a new trial. It was proper to argue to the jury that Peck played a role in the 
attempt to conceal information from Berkey, and to urge the jury to infer that Peck was either aware, or consciously chose not to 
recognize, that material was not in fact being destroyed, but withheld. The sole additional fact that it was Perkins who actively 
misrepresented the facts to Berkey was, at worst, incremental. We do not think that Kodak has met its heavy burden of 
demonstrating that this interchange, standing alone, caused it prejudice so severe as to call for reversal. See, e. g., Gray v. Shell 
Oil Co., 469 F.2d 742, 751-52 (9th Cir. 1972), Cert. denied, 412 U.S. 943, 93 S. Ct. 2773, 37 L. Ed. 2d 403 (1973)."

testimony in earlier unrelated trial)."
848,72," .  We have examined Kodak's other objections to the conduct of the trial and believe they are without merit. We also find 
insubstantial Kodak's contentions that the Sherman Act and the treble damages provision of the Clayton Act are unconstitutional 
on their face. Moreover, we do not think that our interpretation of the former statute has effected a fundamental alteration of the 
law of monopolization. Accordingly, we reject the view that the Sherman Act is unconstitutional as applied to the facts of this suit. 
See generally Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 392 U.S. 481, 495-502, 88 S. Ct. 2224, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1231 
(1968)."
848,73," .  In a letter dated March 4, 1976, Mr. Stein of Parker Chapin wrote to co-counsel that ""the client has no commitment to any of 
the firms representing it in the case to pay a contingent fee or to compensate us on any measure other than time and effort 
expended."" Moreover, despite the trial court's repeated requests, counsel failed to provide any information from which the judge 
could determine the size of the ""success premium"" Berkey allegedly agreed to pay its law firm."
848,74," .  Because of the conclusions we have reached on appeal, we have decided not to award costs to either party. "
849,75," .  Since the question was neither briefed nor argued, we do not decide under what circumstances a court may award fees for 
time expended by counsel on claims that ultimately prove unsuccessful. Compare Union Leader Corp. v. Newspapers of New 
England, Inc., 218 F. Supp. 490, 493 (D.Mass.1963), Set aside on other grounds sub nom.  Haverhill Gazette Co. v. Union 
Leader Corp., 333 F.2d 798 (1st Cir.), Cert. denied, 379 U.S. 931, 85 S. Ct. 329, 13 L. Ed. 2d 343 (1964) With Trans World 
Airlines, Inc. v. Hughes, 312 F. Supp. 478, 483 (S.D.N.Y.1970), Modified on other grounds, 449 F.2d 51 (2d Cir. 1971), rev'd on 
other grounds, 409 U.S. 363, 93 S. Ct. 647, 34 L. Ed. 2d 577 (1973) And L. Sullivan Supra, at 794. Judge Frankel also awarded Berkey $ 343,794.97 in costs, comprising court costs taxable under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1920, and certain 
expenses incurred in taking depositions. This award must also be vacated and reconsidered by the district court. We do make 
two observations for the guidance of the court below. Berkey's contention that the trial court erred in refusing to allow 
reimbursement for expert witness fees is clearly foreclosed by our decision in Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hughes, 449 F.2d 51, 
81 (2d Cir. 1971), rev'd on other grounds, 409 U.S. 363, 93 S. Ct. 647, 34 L. Ed. 2d 577 (1973), in which we indicated that the

Maryland Antitrust Laws, Md.Com.L.Code Ann. ยง 11-204(a) & (b).  By Memorandum and Order dated April 5, 1978, this Court 
granted defendants' motion for summary judgment as to counts 1 and 4 only. "
856,2," .  In the Memorandum accompanying his Motion for Summary Judgment, at 19, plaintiff argued as follows: Abell, a monopolist in the newspaper wholesale market in the Baltimore Metropolitan Area, in competing with plaintiff for 
customers on his route, has in effect sold newspapers to itself at the retail level of distribution and by virtue of its monopoly 
power at the wholesale level, has made it impossible for plaintiff to compete with the price charged by Abell through its direct 
delivery system. Plaintiff raised the same point again in his Trial Memorandum at 18.  As will be explained below, this argument makes sense 
only on the assumption that Abell can be found to have a ""natural monopoly"" of its own products in violation of the antitrust laws. "
857,3," .  The News American employs a different delivery system which primarily utilizes young boys and girls, known as ""Little 
Merchants,"" who provide independent delivery services.  Some adult carriers, however, are also used.  Transcript at 246, 366."
857,4," .  The parties have agreed that the relevant geographical market is the PMA, or the Baltimore Metropolitan area. "
858,5," .  Reliance on price elasticity has been discussed in E. Gellhorn, Antitrust Law and Economics 123-25 (1976) and R. A. 
Posner, Supra, at 438-41. "
859,6," .  Plaintiff's arguments concerning demand cross-elasticities show a flaw parallel to that manifested in his attempt to define the 
relevant market in terms of the newspaper distribution system. For example, plaintiff contends that cross-elasticity of demand in 
the wholesale market is zero because each Sunpaper is a unique product unavailable from any supplier other than Abell.  This 
argument is nothing more than the ""natural monopoly"" argument which, as a matter of law, fails to allege a violation of the 
antitrust laws. Plaintiff reasons that since He cannot demand Sunpapers from anyone other than Abell, Abell has no competition 
from possible substitutes.  This logic would sap Cellophane and Grinnell of any meaning whatsoever and would hardly comport 
with Grinnell's requirement that ""commercial realities"" be evaluated.  When these realities are considered, it becomes readily 
apparent that the relevant market for the application of the antitrust laws and cross-elasticity of demand principles is the 
newspaper retail market. "
860,7," .  Plaintiff's Trial Memorandum, at 5, displays the confusion of relevant markets in the following passage: Under any interpretation of the term ""relevant market"" it is clear that Abell has monopoly power in the newspaper wholesale 
market.  First, Abell is the sole supplier of the Sunpapers and by reason of this fact, plaintiff and other authorized carriers have 
no alternative source of supply for their business, regardless of the wholesale price Abell charges them for the newspapers. 
Even under the broad DuPont definition for plaintiff's purpose there are no other products that are reasonably interchangeable 
because of the nature of his contractual relationship with Abell and the nature of the business in general.  The Sunpapers is a 
""unique and distinctive"" product to him because if he wishes to remain in his current business as a Sunpapers authorized carrier, 
the Sunpapers are the only product available to him for resale to his customers. For this reason, the situations in which the 
courts have defined the relevant market as simply the single product of the defendant is clearly applicable here. The real issue raised here is whether plaintiff and Abell actually compete in the newspaper wholesale market.  Plaintiff claims 
that they do and argues that defendant Abell, when selling at retail itself, establishes a stipulated ""shadow"" wholesale price for 
its own newspapers. In other words, plaintiff claims that Abell the wholesaler sells Abell papers to Abell the retailer.  See note 2 
Supra.  Plaintiff must invent such a fictional wholesale price in order to overcome the natural monopoly argument; however, his 
efforts in this respect are belied by the cases, such as Bushie, which recognize that such a natural monopoly is not actionable 
under the antitrust laws. See Transcript at 129 where one of plaintiff's expert witnesses comments that ""(plaintiff), in fact, is "
861,," paying the higher wholesale price. Now, we can't see directly what wholesale price the Sun charges itself; that is not something 
you can't (sic) document because the sale never takes place."" Defendant has a natural monopoly at the wholesale level, and it is 
this fact, plus the fact that defendant also distributes at the retail level, which constitutes the basis of plaintiff's grievance. "
862,8," .  In making these factual findings, the Knutson court distinguished the holding in Bowen v. New York News, Inc., 366 F. Supp. 
651, 675-76 (S.D.N.Y.1973), Aff'd in pertinent part, rev'd in part, 552 F.2d 1239 at 1242 (2d Cir. 1975). In Bowen, the trial court 
found that the daily paper in question there was a distinct line of commerce having no real substitute.  The court specifically 
rejected the defendant's efforts to show that other media competed with the newspaper; however, it did recognize the existence 
of competition from numerous other newspapers. Yet the cases which the court relied on for this narrow definition of the relevant 
product market were premised upon factual determinations of the particular record.  366 F. Supp. at 675 n.56. The issue presented in this case can be looked at in two ways: (1) whether defendants have shown the existence of the high 
cross-elasticity of demand which they claim is present, or (2) whether plaintiff has succeeded in showing the narrow relevant 
product market and low cross-elasticity needed to support his antitrust claims.  This Court made it clear to plaintiff what his 
burdens were in its earlier ruling on the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment.  Because plaintiff has failed to meet this 
initial burden, the Court does not have to reach a finding that defendants' description of their competition necessarily extends to 
other media.  See Knutson, 383 F. Supp. at 1366 n.24. Finally, Bowen undermines plaintiff's claim here that in his dealings with defendants he was functioning as a wholesaler. The trial 
court found that ""franchise dealers also function as wholesalers in selling to their carrier boys,"" and that the News acted as a 
""wholesaler"" in selling to various retail dealers and independent wholesalers. 366 F. Supp. at 666. The appeals court rejected 
the trial court's reasoning and went on to interpret ""wholesaler"" in terms of commercial realities: in determining whether a party to 
a Fair Trade Agreement is a ""wholesaler,"" we must look to whether the franchisee buys for the purpose of reselling in gross and 
whether the persons to whom he sells actually resell at retail. Judged by these standards, the franchise dealer here performs no true ""wholesale"" functions.  Unlike the normal wholesaler, 
who buys in bulk and distributes to a broad spectrum of independent merchants who then resell for their own profits, here the 
Carrier Agreement clearly contemplates ""sales"" only to home subscribers.  Although Paragraph (a)(5) of the McGuire Act 
prohibits Fair Trade agreements between wholesalers, its thrust is the prevention of price fixing between those in competition 
with sellers at the same functional level.  United States v. McKesson & Robbins, Inc., 351 U.S. 305, 313, 76 S. Ct. 937, 100 L. 
Ed. 1209. Even accepting the characterization of the transactions involved here as ""resales"" by the franchise dealers to the 
delivery boys, the distribution was exclusively through the franchise dealers to the delivery boys, so that The News, however its 
function is described, would never be engaged in selling directly to delivery boys or to home subscribers and thus would not 
have any occasion to agree with competing sellers upon the resale price.  It would therefore be anomalous to classify as 
""wholesalers"" buyers whose resales are solely to a narrow group of this nature.  522 F.2d at 1251 (footnote omitted).  Although 
the court's reasoning was framed with reference to the McGuire Act's prohibitions of unfair methods of competition, 15 U.S.C. ยง 
45(a), its conclusions are generally applicable to the present case.  While both Neugebauer and defendants sold directly to 
home subscribers there has been no evidence of any conspiracy, or unfair or anticompetitive practices insofar as defendants' "
863,," behavior has been concerned.  The testimony at trial showed that defendants began their home delivery solicitations to increase 
circulation and not to deprive plaintiff of any customers."
863,9," .  Defendants note that in H & B, supra, plaintiff attempted to establish a submarket consisting solely of one particular 
International Harvester model.  The court concluded that while the 3960 model was sold only by International Harvester, this fact 
was insufficient to create an issue for the jury.  Accordingly, defendants note that there is no evidence that the Sunpapers is 
unique enough in the newspaper market to constitute a proper submarket.  Defendants' Memorandum In Support of Motion for 
Directed Verdict at 16 n.13."
863,10," .  Paragraph 9 of the Amended Complaint refers to the News American as ""another high quality newspaper of general 
circulation in the Baltimore area with a circulation almost as great as that of the Sun.  . . ."" Plaintiff continues, adding that ""(o)ther 
papers from nearby cities such as the Washington Post do compete at retail with the Sun but account for a relatively small 
portion (5%-25%) of the job market sales in the area which constitutes defendant's marketing area."" "
866,11," .  Although not explained clearly at trial, presumably Abell itself faced an upper limit on its own retail price, and this upper limit 
was set by competition from other newspapers selling or publishing in the PMA.  Depending on the demand elasticity at the 
newspaper retail level, raising retail prices beyond a certain point might, given the slope of the demand curve, actually decrease 
overall revenues since the income lost from circulation decrease might well exceed that generated by the higher retail price.

retailers and their price to the consumer as its ""cost of distribution,' which it would prefer to minimize."" Continental T. V., Inc. v.

880,2," Fruehauf also appeals the Commission's refusal to reopen consideration of its analysis of the impact of the merger on one of 
the relevant product markets in light of developments subsequent to the publication of its decision.  91 F.T.C. 1153 (1978). For 
reasons discussed within, see pp. 3489-3492, Infra, we need not decide whether this refusal to reopen was improper and, if so, 
whether we could order the Commission to reopen the proceedings. "
882,3," The Commission reversed the finding of the ALJ that the merger violated ยง 7 by removing Fruehauf as a potential entrant in 
the HDW market.  The Commission found insufficient evidence that Fruehauf was likely to enter this market.  91 F.T.C. at 238. 
The ALJ also ruled that the merger was illegal because it would entrench Fruehauf in the truck trailer market.  The Commission 
determined that this theory overlapped with the ""captive supply"" theory, and saw no reason to inquire into entrenchment as a 
separate basis for condemning the merger. 91 F.T.C. at 240."
882,4," The history of Standard 121 through April 1978 is recounted in considerable detail in Paccar, Inc., supra, 573 F.2d at 634-39. "
883,5," The release containing these amendments to the regulation states that the exclusion for trailers is ""temporary,"" although no

braking standards for trucks and trailers and solicited comments on a standard to replace Standard 121.  44 Fed.Reg. 9786 
(Feb. 15, 1979)."
883,6," The Commission's opinion uses the figure 3.9% For Fruehauf's share of cast wheel production, but this figure is in error, as the 
brief for the Commission tacitly concedes.  See FTC Br. at 18, n.10."
883,7," One firm, Erie Malleable Iron Co., produces cast iron spoke wheels, but in light of Erie's small share of the market, it is safe to 
assume that case iron wheels have limited appeal.  See text at note 18, Infra."
883,8," For the period 1970-72, the top eight firms (in descending order) in the HDW market, measured in dollar sales, and the type of 
wheel they produce were: Firestone (disc), Dayton-Walther (cast), Kelsey-Hayes (principally cast), Budd (disc), Motor Wheel 
Division of Goodyear (disc), Rockwell, Webb Wheel Division of Marmon Industries (cast), and Reyco.  Rockwell and Reyco do 
not produce center members. Usually the purchaser of the truck or trailer specifies the type of wheel to be used, spoke or disc. Fleet operators generally 
standardize their fleets by adopting one or the other for exclusive use.  For reasons not fully made clear, truckers operating 
primarily west of the Mississippi, and particularly those operating on the West Coast, tend to use disc wheels, whereas cast 
spoke wheels predominate east of the Mississippi.  Each type of wheel enjoys a number of relative advantages over the other, 
and cast spoke and disc producers compete vigorously with each other to convince fleet operators of the superiority of their 
respective products. "
885,9," In a literal sense, any vertical foreclosure represents a lessening of competition inasmuch as the foreclosed transactions are 
removed from the arena of competition.  A ""substantial"" lessening of competition might then be a foreclosure of a numerically 
significant percentage of the market.  At times Brown Shoe appears to encourage this simplified analysis.  See 370 U.S. at 323-
24, 82 S. Ct. 1523: ""The primary vice of a vertical merger or other arrangement tying a customer to a supplier is that, by 
foreclosing the competitors of either party from a segment of the market otherwise open to them, the arrangement may act as a 
""clog on competition,' Standard Oil Co. of California v. United States, 337 U.S. 293, 314, 69 S. Ct. 1051, 1062, 93 L. Ed. 1371 
(1949), which ""deprive(s) . . .  rivals of a fair opportunity to compete.' H.R. Rep. No. 1191, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 8"" (footnote 
omitted).  Du Pont, supra, also lends support to this view where both the market affected and the degree of foreclosure are 
substantial.  353 U.S. at 595, 77 S. Ct. 872; see also Id. at 607, 77 S. Ct. at 884 (""The statutory policy of fostering free 
competition is obviously furthered when no supplier has an advantage over his competitors from an acquisition of his customer's 
stock likely to have the effects condemned by the statute."") Of course, in Du Pont the size of the companies and of the 
percentage of foreclosure in the market as defined by the Court left no doubt that the vertical tie conferred market power upon 
Du Pont. But we are unwilling to assume that any vertical foreclosure lessens competition.  Absent very high market concentration or 
some other factor threatening a tangible anticompetitive effect, a vertical merger may simply realign sales patterns, for insofar as 
the merger forecloses some of the market from the merging firms' competitors, it may simply free up that much of the market, in 
which the merging firm's competitors and the merged firm formerly transacted, for new transactions between the merged firm's 
competitors and the merging firm's competitors. See 2 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law P 527a (1978). A similar issue arises under ยง 3 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 14, governing exclusive dealing contracts, including 
requirements contracts, which present much the same evil as a vertical merger foreclosing a portion of the supplying firm's 
market.  See Standard Oil, supra, where the Court found that a requirements contract violated ยง 3 because of the percentage of 
the market foreclosed, 337 U.S. at 314, 69 S. Ct. 1051. The Court observed that use of such exclusive dealing arrangements by 
Standard and its major competitors enabled them to maintain oligopolistic control of the market.  Id. at 295, 309, 69 S. Ct. 1051."
885,10," See text at notes 23 to 27, Infra, and cases cited therein. "
886,11," The Guidelines state that the Department may be expected to challenge ""a merger or series of mergers between a supplying 
firm, accounting for approximately 10% Or more of the sales in its market, and one or more purchasing firms, accounting In toto 
for approximately 6% Or more of the total purchases in that market, unless it clearly appears that there are no significant barriers 
to entry into the business of the purchasing firm or firms."" Guidelines P 12, Supra, p. 6886."
886,12," Fruehauf would enjoy an unfair advantage over its competitors if Kelsey diverted sales to Fruehauf from customers who do 
not build trailers, but the relative advantage would not be as great.  Moreover, Kelsey's non-trailer customers, including Ford and 
General Motors, exercise the greatest leverage over Kelsey with the threat of retaliatory withdrawal of patronage. "
887,13," Appellant contends that the merger came about through the initiative of Kelsey, which turned to Fruehauf in order to forestall 
a takeover by a less desired suitor.  A witness for appellant who participated in the merger negotiations testified that the subject 
of vertical dealings was never broached in the meetings between Kelsey and Fruehauf.  Whatever specific topics were 
discussed by the negotiators, we tend to doubt that the parties, in concluding that they would be compatible merger-partners, 
failed to take into account possible vertical transactions between them, even though nothing may have been said on the subject."
887,14," The last shortage, in 1973-74, was not foreseen.  A witness from Dayton-Walther suggested that this shortage was due in 
part to a heavier than expected stampede of truckers rushing to buy trucks and trailers before Standard 121 went into effect."
887,15," The Commission issued the final order on February 22, 1978, and denied the petition to reopen the order on June 22, 1978.  
Paccar, supra, was decided on April 17, 1978, and certiorari was denied on October 2, 1978.  The Commission denied 
Fruehauf's motion to reopen the order on the grounds that the possibility remained that NHTSA would reimpose the same or 
similar performance standards for air-braked vehicles, or that Fruehauf would remain a substantial purchaser of ASBD even if it 
had no legal obligation to instal the device, and that reversal of the finding of a violation with respect to the ASBD market would 
not in any event alter the scope of the divestiture order.  91 F.T.C. at 1153-55. "

Supreme Court reversed an agency's refusal to reopen a hearing to consider changed economic circumstances, Atchison, T. & 
S. F. Ry. Co. v. United States, 284 U.S. 248, 52 S. Ct. 146, 76 L. Ed. 273 (1932), the Court observed that a record closed in 
September, 1928, was not ""representative"" of conditions prevailing in 1931, when the Commission's order went into effect.  Id. at 
260-61, 52 S. Ct. 146. A recent decision of this court, Greene County Planning Bd. v. FPC, 559 F.2d 1227, 1233 (2d Cir. 
1976), Cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1086, 98 S. Ct. 1280, 55 L. Ed. 2d 791 (1978), follows the Jersey City standard although it 
phrases it differently."
888,17," See United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, 148 F.2d 416, 445-46 (2d Cir. 1945) (""There is no reason why an appellate 
court . . .  should not advise itself from outside the record of such facts as appear to admit of no genuine dispute,"" although 
evidence taken from outside the record cannot be regarded as conclusive).  The instant case could be distinguished from those 
in which the rule of complete agency discretion is usually invoked inasmuch as this case does not involve a rate-making or 
permit-application procedure, where the agency is solely responsible for the substantive decision, but the application of a statute 
jointly administered by the Commission and the courts. "
889,18," One firm, Erie, produces cast iron spiders, but its sales account for less than 3% Of the market for cast wheels. "
890,19," The ALJ did not establish a precise figure for the volume associated with maximum scale efficiencies, but suggested that the 
figure would be about 5-10% Of the market.  91 F.T.C. at 187."
890,20," Evidently, the ALJ did not consider the feasibility of entry into the HDW market with production only of center members, which 
could be sold as an individual component or as an assembled unit with components purchased from other manufacturers. 
Greenberg's study indicates that under the most likely circumstances of entry, a firm could launch into production of cast spokes 
at a volume of 200,000-300,000 at an initial cost of about $ 8-10 million."
890,21," The evidence on the barriers to entry into the HDW market via production of steel discs is meager in comparison to that for 
cast spokes. See 91 F.T.C. at 185 (P 222).  What evidence there is suggests that the cost is less for discs. On the other hand, 
appellant does not argue that because of the relative ease of entry via disc production the HDW producers are wide open to 
potential competition."
890,22," The ALJ and the Commission found that Fruehauf traditionally purchases in-house whenever possible, even when the 
immediate commercial interest would seem to dictate obtaining supplies aliunde.  91 F.T.C. at 204, 235. Prior to the merger 
Fruehauf's principal supplier of cast spoke wheels was the Dayton-Walther Co.  Shortly after the merger took place Fruehauf 
granted Dayton a five-year, renewable contract for the purchase of wheels in response to Dayton's inquiries about the impact of 
the merger on its relationship with Fruehauf.  A spokesman from Dayton testified that the contract gives it the option of 
continuing to supply Fruehauf as long as it offers wheels at a competitive price, although the witness was not unreservedly 
confident that the contract could be enforced.  This witness also testified that loss of Fruehauf's business would not have a 
""drastic"" effect on the company. At least through the trial, Fruehauf continued to purchase wheels from Dayton but, subject to Dayton's rights under the contract, 
we agree with the Commission's observation that conduct while litigation is predictable or pending is no sure guide to a merging 
company's ultimate intentions.  91 F.T.C. at 236, n.29. Fruehauf does not contend that it does not expect to have Kelsey supply 
all the cast spoke wheels it needs. "

892,30," In the late 1960's and early 1970's Fruehauf experimented with a fabricated aluminum wheel and a fabricated steel wheel for 
production in Fruehauf's own facilities.  Fruehauf abandoned the steel wheel project in early 1970 in order to concentrate its 
efforts on the aluminum wheel, which seemed more promising.  This project was abandoned in 1971 when Fruehauf determined 
that under existing market conditions production of fabricated aluminum wheels was not economically feasible.  Following the 
termination of these efforts to develop a wheel for in-house production, Fruehauf explored with U.S. Steel the development of a 
fabricated steel wheel to be designed by an outside engineering firm and produced by U.S. Steel. The prototype turned out to be 
unacceptable for commercial use, and the project ended in September 1973. In 1967-68, when a strike halted wheel production at Dayton-Walther, the leading producer of cast spoke wheels and Fruehauf's 
traditional principal supplier, Fruehauf favorably responded to an inquiry from McConway and Torley, a leading producer of cast 
steel components used by the railroad industry, about the possibility of it producing wheels for Fruehauf.  Eager to cultivate an 
alternate source of supply, Fruehauf provided McConway with necessary drawings and helped finance the purchase of patterns 
and equipment.  For a few years, McConway sold cast spokes to Fruehauf.  Fruehauf stopped buying from McConway in late 
1973, and shortly thereafter McConway, which had experienced greater than anticipated production problems, exited from the 
market.  According to testimony of a spokesman from McConway, when the demand for the company's railroad products 
revived, and when Dayton resumed production of wheels, McConway figured that it had overestimated the need for a new wheel 
producer and so decided to concentrate on its traditional product lines. In the late 1960's Fruehauf, at the initiative of Webb Wheel, held preliminary discussions about an arrangement whereby Webb 
would supply Fruehauf's cast spoke requirements.  These discussions terminated at an early stage, however, because of a lack 
of interest on the part of Webb's senior executives."
892,31," The Commission has recognized that the ""test for finding injury due to elimination of a potential competitor is not simple."" It 
cannot rest on concentration ratios alone.  ""Additional factors enter into any analysis of the loss of a potential competitor. Among 
these are: trends toward concentration in the market; extensive entry barriers; high probability that the lost potential competitor 
would have actually entered the market; whether the lost potential competitor was one of only a few such potential competitors 
and whether, if he had entered the market, his new competition would have had a significant impact on price and quality."" 
Beatrice Foods Co., 81 F.T.C. 481, 526-27 (1972). "
893,32," The Commission does not specify whether it proceeded under the theory that Fruehauf, at the time of the merger, exerted a 
present pro-competitive effect because HDW producers knew that Fruehauf was seeking to attract new sources of supply or 
would do so if prices rose to an unacceptable level, and conducted themselves accordingly, or under the theory that Fruehauf 
represented a potential pro-competitive effect through its ability to draw a new competitor into the market at some future time, 
and thereby strengthen competition at some future time. The theory of perceived potential competition received the Supreme Court's imprimatur in FTC v. Procter & Gamble Co., 386 
U.S. 568, 581, 87 S. Ct. 1224, 18 L. Ed. 2d 303 (1967). The validity of the theory of actual potential competition is a question 
that has been reserved twice by the Supreme Court, United States v. Marine Bancorporation, 418 U.S. 602, 639, 94 S. Ct. 2856, 
41 L. Ed. 2d 978 (1974); United States v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., 410 U.S. 526, 537, 93 S. Ct. 1096, 35 L. Ed. 2d 475 (1973), 
once by this court, BOC International Ltd. v. FTC, 557 F.2d 24, 25 (2d Cir. 1977), and by at least one other circuit court, FTC v. 
Atlantic Richfield Co., 549 F.2d 289, 294 (4th Cir. 1977). Here the evidence is inadequate to sustain either of these theories.  
Ordinarily, these theories are applied when one of the merging firm is the potential entrant, but they conceivably could apply, 
assuming the necessary factual predicates, when the merging firms is not itself a potential competitor but a potential promotor of 
a third-party entrant. "

909,8," Id. at 243, 358. In The 1970 National Power Survey, the Commission discussed the advantages of staggered construction: Staggered construction is a technique which involves construction of excess capacity by one utility for the use of one or more 
other utilities with the supplier-buyer arrangement being reversed or modified with each succeeding unit. Several variations of 
this practice are widely used. Sometimes adjacent systems informally coordinate their capacity additions over a period of several 
years so that the total installed capacity reserve approximates the amount required by the entire geographic area. Each 
individual system's reserve in percent of peak-hour load may vary widely from year to year, but the total peak-hour reserves for 
the group are maintained at approximately a constant level. A refinement of this coordinating technique includes short-term capacity transactions which permit a system to install a larger 
unit than its own immediate needs require and to sell firm capacity to neighboring systems for one or more years. Later this utility 
purchases firm capacity from neighboring systems for a period of time and then repeats the cycle by installing an even larger 
generating unit. This arrangement has found general acceptance by some power pools and other coordinating groups since 
each member can achieve benefits from economy of scale and maintain most economically the installed capacity reserves 
required by the coordinating group. Another form of staggered construction which has gained widespread acceptance in recent years is the unit-sale concept. This 
entails arrangements whereby a system installs a larger unit than it otherwise normally would, and sells a specified amount of 
excess capacity from that unit to one or more neighboring systems. The purchaser's entitlement is limited to the availability of 
capacity from the specific unit. In the event of an outage of such unit, the buyer is not entitled to any portion of the supplier's 
other capacity resources. Rates for unit sale transactions usually reflect actual capacity and energy costs from the specific unit 
involved. Federal Power Commission, The 1970 National Power Survey at I-17-23 (1971)."

the transmission of power. Pooling arrangements are basically of two types. The first is designed primarily to accomplish a high degree of operational 
reliability on a day-to-day basis, but it will usually also reduce the relative cost of providing reliability. . . . The second type is 
designed to achieve these goals, plus the economies of joint planning and construction of generation and transmission facilities. Meeks, Concentration in the Electric Power Industry: The Impact of Antitrust Policy, 72 Colum.L.Rev. 64, 101 (1972); See note 8

Alexandria is not contesting the general reasonableness of price levels, See id. at 449, but contends that the rate-setting 
procedures are indicative of MAPP's anticompetitive nature. In upholding the schedules, the ALJ and the Commission relied on 
the need to stimulate short-term purchases of excess capacity in lieu of adding new capacity and to discourage reliance on 
emergency energy when units are less efficient. See id. at 381-82, 411-12 & n.14. We conclude that the Commission's decision 
that such procedures were not anticompetitive is reasonable."

U.S.C. ยง 824e(a) (1976), because pool services were limited; that the Commission did not engage in reasoned decisionmaking; 
that the Commission failed to fulfill its duty under section 202(a) of the Act, 16 U.S.C. ยง 824a(a) (1976), to promote and 
encourage interconnection and coordination of facilities; and that the Commission erred in holding it has no authority to order 
increased pool services. South Dakota also suggests that the Commission failed to carry out its responsibilities under section 207 of the Act, 16 U.S.C. ยง

which require, Inter alia, filing a complaint with the Commission and sending notice to all affected state commissions."
915,33," South Dakota suggests that the Commission gave inadequate attention to ""national energy policy."" Brief for South Dakota at 
31-34. Specifically, South Dakota asserts that the Commission failed to act with the requisite urgency to conserve energy and 
failed to give due regard to coordination with the states. We disagree. The Commission had specific responsibility in this 
proceeding to decide whether a particular voluntary pool agreement was unjust, unreasonable, or unduly discriminatory. We 
have no reason to believe that its decision was inconsistent with ""national energy policy."" However, even if it could be so 
construed, we recall this court's recent decision in Richmond Power & Light v. FERC, 187 U.S.App.D.C. 399, 405-06, 574 F.2d 
610, 616-17 (1978) (footnotes omitted): While an administrative agency must remain faithful to public policies directly related to its regulatory authority, surely at any 
given moment of history it may rationally decline to affirmatively foster other policies in weighing the specific interests that it is 
required by statute to consider."

] Under section 202(b), 16 U.S.C. ยง 824a(b) (1976), the Commission, upon application of a state commission or a person engaged in the sale or transmission of electrical energy, may order a public utility to establish physical connection of its 
transmission facilities with another electric system and sell or exchange energy. The Commission may not compel the 
enlargement of generating facilities for such purpose or impose undue burden upon such public utility. See also ยง 202(c), 16 
U.S.C. ยง 824a(c) (1976) (emergency powers)."
916,36," The Commission explained the different degrees of power pooling in The 1970 National Power Survey, Supra note 8, at I-17-
1 to I-17-2: There are thousands of arrangements among systems from all segments of the industry providing for various degrees and 
methods of electrical coordination. These variations reflect differences in load density, characteristics of generating resources, 
geography, and climate. They are also a product of managerial views with respect to planning, marketing, competition, and 
retention of prerogatives. Because of these differences, no single definition of coordination has been established by the electric 
utility industry. As used in this chapter, Coordination is joint planning and operation of bulk power facilities by two or more 
electric systems for improved reliability and increased efficiency which would not be attainable if each system acted 
independently. Full coordination involves coordination of all systems within an area, to the extent technologically and 
economically feasible to permit the serving of their combined loads with a minimum of resources and to exploit opportunities for 
coordination with adjacent areas. The highest degree of coordinated planning results when a group of utilities jointly plan, design, and construct their generation 
and transmission facilities as a single system. However, such coordinating groups must be large enough to take full advantage 
of the efficient generating units and EHV transmission made available by modern technology, yet be of manageable size with all 
members capable of sharing the responsibilities of the coordinated effort. Similarly, the highest degree of coordinated operation 
is achieved when a group of utilities operate all of their bulk power facilities as a single system."
916,37," See Brief for South Dakota at 21. We also reject South Dakota's assertion that the Commission's decision should be reversed 
because the Commission did not reopen the evidentiary proceedings to receive a report prepared by South Dakota in 1977 "
917,," entitled An Evaluation of Power Supply Planning by the Six-Investor Owned Electric Utilities in South Dakota. Basically, the 
report concludes that MAPP participants continue to plan and construct ""sub-optional"" facilities. Brief for South Dakota at 24. 
The report apparently underlies South Dakota's arguments that the Commission should have ordered pool operations to result in 
enlargement of generation facilities. See text at  -- - U.S.App.D.C.  -- , 606 F.2d 1166 Supra. South Dakota first referred to its 
ongoing ""study of the power supply alternatives available to South Dakota"" in its brief of exceptions to the ALJ's initial decision. 
J.A. II at 398. At that time, however, South Dakota specifically indicated that the present proceeding could be concluded without 
consideration of the report. South Dakota recommended reopening the record only ""if the Commission believe(d) additional 
information would be useful."" Id. at 399. In its petition for rehearing of the Commission's decision, South Dakota indicated it was 
prepared to present evidence that the Agreement ""fails to establish reasonable mechanisms for more efficient regional planning 
and construction."" Id. at 439. South Dakota then suggested that it join with the Commission in further investigation ""if the . . . 
Commission finds the present record inadequate to evaluate the pool agreement and order necessary improvements."" Id. In view of the lack of a firm request for reopening of the record, and our decision with respect to the Commission's authority to 
mandate enlarged pool services, we cannot say that the Commission abused its discretion in failing to reopen the evidentiary 
record. See generally Willis Shaw Frozen Express, Inc. v. ICC, 191 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 7, 587 F.2d 1333, 1339 (1978)."

918,45," The MAPP Management Committee submitted a filing with the Commission on March 6, 1979, which contains new 
membership provisions. This filing is the subject of ongoing Commission proceedings and we express no view on its merits. "
919,46," In ordering the modification of the membership provisions, the Commission stated: We agree with Staff that the membership criteria of Article IV of MAPP are not reasonably related to the MAPP objectives. Those 
objectives are the effectuation of reserve sharing so as to best develop through coordination reliable and economic generating 
capacity. As far as access to the operational functions of MAPP, Staff is correct that ownership and use of generation and at 
least one interconnection is the minimum criterion. The criteria now employed to differentiate Participants from Associate 
Participants all distill down to size of the system. While the smaller systems could conceivably benefit from MAPP membership, 
they do not have the transmission facilities to reciprocate in kind for the short-term transmission services included in the MAPP 
services schedules. Because of the significant advantages flowing from MAPP membership and the corresponding impact of 
denied access, we do not feel that this size criterion is reasonable. So long as the small utility can provide compensation for the 
true value of this transmission service, whether in kind or money, the pool should not be injured. Although the complexities involved in establishing some standard for monetary compensation do not deter the ultimate result 
that Article IV must be modified, they do cause us to proceed cautiously. Accordingly, we shall hereby direct Commission Staff to 
initiate dialogue with the MAPP Management Committee to develop a fair and equitable measure of compensation to be paid by 
those Participants which do not have the transmission wherewithal to reciprocate in kind. This process of modifying the 
membership provisions should be open so that any electric system in the mid-continent area can observe. Access to the MAPP 
planning function should also be improved as a part of this modification process. . . . In making this decision that the membership criteria must be modified, we do not deny the benefits which any utility, including 
those too small to presently become MAPP Participants, can glean from purely bilateral, non-pool reserve sharing 
arrangements; however, that fact does not mollify the discrimination inherent in Article IV which we must, under Sections 205 
and 206 of the Federal Power Act, remedy. While there is no obligation for utilities in the first instance to have a pooling 
agreement, if one does exist it must be nondiscriminatory. Within the dynamics of the electric utility industry, the oftentimes 
subtle and yet significant long-term impact of power pooling demands our close scrutiny of provisions which deny access to the 
benefits of the pool. Thus the presence of such bilateral arrangements and the absence of denials of membership do not 
vindicate discrimination inherent in the membership provisions. In this regard, apart from the inherent discrimination Article 
4.02(b) and (c) contain standards (forming an integral part of the regional transmission network and contributing significantly to 
the reliability of the interconnected systems operations) which are not sufficiently quantitative to assure objective and 
nondiscriminatory interpretation. This problem must be cured when the membership provisions are reformed. Id. at 417-18."

not relieve such systems from reserve obligations and should not have a detrimental impact on planning functions. "

926,3," .  Pragmatically our rejection or acceptance of the Danko theory would not change the fate of Plaintiffs' appeal.  Even under the 
theory we reject, the separateness of parent and wholly-owned subsidiary must be established in order for a transfer between

between parent and subsidiary. See authorities cited note 1, Supra.  The Plaintiffs here depend on little else but the 
appearances of independence incident to Gates' and National's separate corporate status.  Gates exercised full dominion and 
control over National; there was no arm's length dealings between them.  Thus, on this record we would reverse even under the 
Danko theory had we found the theory itself persuasive.  See Boeing v. Shipman, 411 F.2d 365 (5th Cir. 1969) (appellate 
standard for review of jury verdict). Those who suffer real antitrust damage are not necessarily left without any antitrust remedy either under our own analysis or 
under an unsuccessful attempt to recover on the Danko theory we reject.  See, e. g., Schaben v. Samuel Moore and Company,

934,1," Chief Judge Seitz is of the view that the question whether the defendants' agreement is violative of ยง 8(e) of the NLRA is not 
presented as a ""collateral issue"" in this antitrust action, and need not be decided. See Connell Construction Co. v. Plumbers & 
Steamfitters Local 100, 421 U.S. 616, 626, 95 S. Ct. 1830, 1837, 44 L. Ed. 2d 418 (1975). He notes that the defendants here 
have not argued, as did the defendants in Connell, that their agreement was ""explicitly allowed by the construction-industry 
proviso to ยง 8(e) and that antitrust policy therefore must defer to the NLRA."" Id. Moreover, he believes that we should not convey 
the impression to the district courts that an appropriate short-hand method of deciding the applicability of the non-statutory 
exemption in cases such as this is to determine whether the challenged agreement constitutes an unfair labor practice; such a 
method would lead to the needless resolution by the federal courts of significant labor law questions that ought to be decided in 
the first instance by the NLRB. Cf. Consolidated Express, Inc. v. New York Shipping Ass'n, Inc., 602 F.2d 494 (3d Cir., 1979) 
(effect of prior NLRB determination that an agreement is violative of ยง 8(e)). "
935,2," Because of the dispute's labor context, Judge Weis is of the view that the activity here should not be construed as a 
conventional group boycott to which the Per se rule would apply. He would use the rule of reason standard. See Consolidated

953,1," .  Schottland and Harley testified that Cooper announced a three per cent increase.  Mendenhall and Hughes testified that 
Cooper mentioned a specific percentage, but they could not remember what it was. "
954,2," .  Appellants contend that the government was obligated to prove an overt act by each defendant in furtherance of the 
conspiracy during the felony period.  We need not decide here whether this contention is correct.  But see United States v. 
United States Gypsum Co., 600 F.2d 414, 417-20 (3d Cir. 1979). "
961,3," .  The most notable exception is Cooper's alleged statement at the breakfast in Bermuda that he had the support of ""the others"" 
for a three per cent increase.  Although this statement appears to be hearsay as to Chase Bag and Rue, we believe that the 
remaining, independent evidence against those defendants is sufficient to support the district court's decision under Trowery. "
963,4," .  Appellants argue that the distinction drawn in Gillen is erroneous because the defendants in Gypsum also were accused of 
conspiring to fix prices. See 438 U.S. at 427, 98 S. Ct. 2864. This argument fails to recognize the narrow focus of the Supreme 
Court's opinion in Gypsum.  The district court's instructions in that case allowed the jury to convict the defendants if the jury 
concluded that there was an agreement to exchange price information and that such exchanges had the effect of stabilizing 
prices.  This instruction rendered the indictment and the government's theory of the case irrelevant. "

abused its discretion in denying Continental's motion for a new trial under Fed.R.Crim.P. 33, that the district court erred in 
charging the jury on the government's burden of proving Continental's participation in the conspiracy during the felony period, 
that the district court erroneously admitted evidence of activities antedating the crime charged, that the district court erred in 
admitting the testimony and exhibits of Julius Tolton, that the district court erred in refusing to admit defense exhibit AE-204, that 
the district court erroneously admitted vague and imprecise accusatory testimony by government witnesses; (C) Chase Bag's

erroneously charged the jury with a sterile recitation of black letter law, that the district court erred in its charge on corporate 
culpability, that the district court erred in its charge on apparent authority for a corporate agent, that the district court failed to 
give a proper instruction on price leadership/followership, that the district court erred in denying Chase Bag's motions for 
severance and for a bill of particulars, that the district court erroneously limited cross-examination by Chase Bag's counsel, that 
the district court erred in admitting Stanley Schottland's testimony concerning his understanding of the meaning of silence at 
allegedly conspiratorial meetings, that the district court erred in refusing to allow Chase Bag's counsel to give the jury selected 
exhibits collected in ""jury books,"" that the district court improperly restricted counsel's time for closing argument, that the district 
court erred in its procedure for selecting the jury; (D) Cooper's contentions that the prosecutor engaged in improper summation 
and rebuttal, that the district court erred in admitting the testimony of Robert Pentz, that the district court erred in denying 
Cooper's motion for severance, that the trial court's general management of the proceedings deprived Cooper of a fair trial; (E) 
Rue's contentions that the district court erred in refusing to charge the jury in a way that ensured separate consideration of the 
charges against Rue, and that the district court erred in refusing to take corrective action as to alleged misstatements of fact

974,5," BRITISH LEYLAND MOTOR CORPORATION, LTD. (hereinafter referred to as British Leyland) a defendant-appellee, in 1968 
became the top company of the British Leyland group as the result of the merger of British Motor Corporation, manufacturer of 
Austin, MG and Jaguar, and Leyland Motor Corporation, manufacturer of Triumph, Rover and Land Rover. As a result of this 
merger, British Leyland became the parent of three separate U.S. marketing organizations: British Motor Holdings (U.S.A.), Inc., 
which marketed MG; Leyland Motor Corporation of North America, the importer of Triumph (and Rover at that time), and Jaguar 
Cars, Inc., importer of Jaguar. These three U.S. companies were consolidated into British Leyland Motors, Inc. (BLM), on 
October 1, 1968, which continued to operate through three divisions up to 1972: Jaguar, Triumph-Rover and Austin-MG. BRITISH LEYLAND MOTORS, INC. (BLM), a Delaware corporation, a defendant-appellee, is the wholly-owned subsidiary of 
British Leyland, being the October 1, 1968, consolidation of the three U.S. companies as mentioned above. BLM as the United 
States importer resells British Leyland products to its wholly-owned subsidiary, Leyland Motor Sales, Inc. (LMS), or to 
independent distributors such as British Motor Car Distributors, Ltd. (BMCD). BRITISH MOTOR CAR DISTRIBUTORS, LTD. (BMCD), another defendant-appellee, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Jensen 
International Motors Corp. and its ownership is independent of the other defendants-appellees. BMCD is a distributor of 
passenger cars, parts and accessories manufactured by British Leyland and imported by BLM. LEYLAND MOTOR SALES, INC. (LMS), another defendant-appellee, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of defendant-appellee BLM. 
LMS is a distributor of passenger cars, parts and accessories manufactured by British Leyland and imported by BLM. Plaintiff-
appellant Vincent's franchise agreement involved here was signed with LMS for an additional one-year period expiring 
December 2, 1973. Peter SATORI Company, Inc. (Satori), a defendant-appellee, was a long-established retailer of imported cars in Pasadena, 
California, where Vincent did business. Satori bought Jaguars from one independent distributor in Los Angeles, and MG and 
Austins from another distributor in Compton, California. It was appointed a full-line British Leyland dealer in Pasadena when 
Vincent lost its Triumph franchise in the same city in 1972 in connection with BLM's consolidation of its wholesale distribution 
system pursuant to a ""Rationalization Program"". Gary H. SHERMAN, plaintiff-appellant, was the president and sole shareholder of the other plaintiff-appellant, Vincent Imports, 
Inc., dba European Motors, which conducted business as a retail automobile dealership in Pasadena, California, from December 
1, 1971, until March 15, 1974. VINCENT IMPORTS, INC. (Vincent), dba European Motors, one of the plaintiffs-appellants, conducted business as a retail 
automobile dealer in Pasadena, California, from December 1, 1971, until March 15, 1974. Sherman became the president and 
sole shareholder of Vincent on December 1, 1971, and continued as such during all relevant times. Vincent previously had been 
a Triumph dealer, and under Sherman was given a one-year Triumph franchise by LMS. The franchise was renewed by LMS on 
December 2, 1972, for an additional one-year period. "
975,6," Gary W. Whitehead, president of both BLM and LMS, conceived the Rationalization Program, perhaps as early as 1968. He, 
together with Michael H. Dale, a vice-president of BLM and also LMS, participated in the implementation of the program. "
976,7," The text of this agreement apparently was not made part of the record on appeal but appears in the brief of appellees at 90-97. 
It, however, is referred to on the record in the ""Distribution Agreement"" as ""Exhibit A"". "
977,8," ""It is perfectly true, as plaintiff says, that the Rationalization Program ultimately caused plaintiff to lose its Triumph franchise 
when it expired in December 1973."" Leyland appellees' answering brief at 7. "
978,9," Paragraph 16(c)(1) of the franchise agreement provided, among other things, that the ""death, incapacity, removal, resignation, 
or withdrawal from active participation with the dealer for any reason of any of the persons listed on the Schedule as principals of 
the Dealership"" would give the distributor cause to terminate the agreement. The schedule listed ""Gary Harold Sherman 
President"" and ""Helga Sherman Vice President"". But the franchise in paragraph 16(g) provided also ""that either party may in its 
full discretion and with or without any cause cancel this Agreement upon not less than thirty days notice to the other."" "
979,10," Sherman alleged by affidavit: My salary income and fringe benefits of approximately $ 36,000 per year ended with the loss of the Triumph franchise and in 
addition I was required to repay loans on behalf of the corporation by reason of my personal guarantee. In early 1974, I repaid $ 
70,000 to banks as such guarantees. Of this amount, some $ 11,000 has been repaid to me by the corporation, leaving a 
balance owing to me, by the corporation, of approximately $ 59,000 which the corporation is wholly unable to pay."

with reference to the Dealers' Act claims, but we are not persuaded to follow it. The provision involved in that case, and this, that 
if certain stockholders did not continue as principals in the business the dealership could be terminated by the franchiser, was for 
the benefit of the latter only and did not expand the parties to the agreement, as we view it."

Bravman's case (involving direct restraints upon his independent sales activities) for in all of them the alleged impact of a 
restraint of trade was felt in the business or property of a corporation, and the injury, if any, to the plaintiffs consisted only in the 
diminution of the value of the injured corporation."" But see Data Digests, Inc. v. Standard & Poor's Corp., 43 F.R.D. 386 
(S.D.N.Y.1967) (where unlike the present case the plaintiff officer of the corporation who was left in the case beyond a motion to 
dismiss on the pleadings had not had an opportunity to develop any record of his interest). We do not believe that Reiter v. 
Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 99 S. Ct. 2326, 60 L. Ed. 2d 931 (1979), raises any question concerning our conclusion, dealing 
as that case does with direct damage to consumers rather than indirect losses suffered by corporate stockholders or creditors 
from the impact of antitrust law violations upon the corporation."
979,13," Sherman lacks standing in his individual capacity to bring any of the pendent claims. Where there is an injury to the 
corporation, the cause of action should be brought by the corporation, or by the shareholders derivatively if the corporation fails 
to act; only for separate individual damage does an individual cause of action lie.  Jones v. H. F. Ahmanson & Co., 1 Cal.3d 93, 
81 Cal.Rptr. 592, 460 P.2d 464 (1969); Sutter v. General Petroleum Corp., 28 Cal.2d 525, 530, 170 P.2d 898, 901 (1946). 
Sherman lacked standing as a third party beneficiary, since his status was that of an incidental beneficiary. Where there was no 
direct undertaking or intention to benefit him, he had no rights under such a contract. Restatement of Contracts ยงยง 133, 147; 
Martinez v. Socoma Cos., 11 Cal.3d 394, 113 Cal.Rptr. 585, 521 P.2d 841 (1974)."
979,14," See Wright, Miller & Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure ยง 3531 (1975). The trial court, although dismissing his antitrust 
and pendent claims for lack of standing, did not expressly deny Sherman's standing to individually maintain the Dealers' Act and 
pendent fraud claims. Without including the point in their cross-appeal, defendants argue that Sherman had no standing with 
respect to the latter claims also. Finally, the district court's dismissal of all claims as to all parties contained no explanation of 
reasons. "
980,15," While the answer of British Leyland was not made part of the record on appeal, memoranda before the district court indicate 
that its answer raised an issue of the In personam jurisdiction of the district court over it. Such issue remained unresolved when 
summary judgment was granted in its favor apparently on other grounds."
980,16," Reference to the franchise agreement in this formulation departs from the not infrequent statements that there must be a 
written franchise agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant or between the manufacturer and the dealer. The latter 
statements would be unduly restrictive in view of the agency-conspiracy concept hereafter discussed."
980,17," British Leyland Motor Corporation Limited, the English company . . . was, concededly, ""the manufacturer"" of Triumph cars in 
the 1971-1973 period. Its subsidiary, BLM, and the latter's subsidiary, LMS, are conceded to be each a ""manufacturer"" under the 
Dealer Act, although the Act also requires that there be a written contract between the manufacturer and the dealer, and there 
was no such contract between BLM and plaintiff. Supplemental trial memorandum of the British Leyland defendants at R. 00534. "
981,18," Stansifer at 66. Referring to provisions of the distributorship agreement some of which were similar to those with which we are 
concerned, including the provisions for a veto of the distributor's appointment of dealers, the court had observed: ""Contractual 
provisions of the type here involved are not uncommon. In construing similar contracts the courts have held consistently that 
controls of the kind reserved by Chrysler do not create a relationship of agency, but rather one of buyer and seller."" Id. at 65."
981,19," Typical of supporting cases cited in Marquis is York Chrysler-Plymouth v. Chrysler Credit Corp., 447 F.2d 786 (5th Cir. 1971), 
in which the court stated: ""(T)here being no showing that would make either responsible for the acts of the other on an agency 
theory, and the facts indicating that they are separate legal entities each operating in its own sphere, only the one who has 
entered into a franchise agreement could be held accountable for performing or complying with it."" 447 F.2d at 791."
981,20," See Stansifer, 487 F.2d at 66, Supra. However, for reasons hereafter discussed the problem in this case is essentially 
different than that in Stansifer."
981,21," BMCD's letter . . . constitutes BMCD's version of its contractual relationship with plaintiffs between October 1 and December 
15, 1973. The letter refers to an enclosed Dealer Agreement and says that BMCD will assume its terms are acceptable unless 
the dealer otherwise indicates. The letter and enclosure constitute a ""franchise"" within the meaning of the statute, and one which 
could not be terminated or nonrenewed by means of coercion or intimidation (the enclosure to the letter does not appear as part 
of the record before us). Vincent brief at 40."
981,22," The approach taken in Stansifer v. Chrysler Motors Corp., supra, in this court's view, misconceive(d) the nature of the remedy 
provided under the Automobile Dealers' Act, and, if followed, would effectively remove from the Act's protection all situations 
involving midstream changes in channels of wholesale distribution. This is a result which this court does not conceive as having 
been intended. DeCantis v. Mid-Atlantic Toyota Distributors, 371 F. Supp. at 1243. "
982,23," HN4[
] ""A manufacturer may be liable notwithstanding it is not a party to the franchise if the party contracting with the dealer is the manufacturer's agent or merely a ""straw man' erected to insulate it from statutory liability."" Marquis at 630. HN5[
] The term ""franchise"" is defined in 15 U.S.C. ยง 1221(b) as ""the written agreement or contract between any automobile manufacturer engaged in commerce and any automobile dealer which purports to fix the legal rights and liabilities of the parties 
to such agreement or contract."" It is clear that without a written franchise there can be no claim or cause of action under the Act. There was no written agreement between Chrysler and Stansifer. The written agreements were between Chrysler as 
manufacturer and Fisher as distributor and between Fisher as distributor and Stansifer as dealer. Nor is there any evidence that 
Chrysler had any direct dealings with Stansifer prior to the termination of the dealer agreement between Fisher and Stansifer. Stansifer at 63-64. "
983,24," From an examination of the entire record we find no evidence to support appellant's contention that Chrysler was acting as 
Fisher's agent (with respect to alleged coercion by employees of Chrysler after termination of the franchise in question by 
Fisher). Appellant also alleged in his complaint that appellees ""conspired to wrongfully terminate plaintiff's non-exclusive dealership."" No 
proof was offered to support this claim. . . ."

175 (S.D.Cal.1959)."
983,26," In view of the restrictive definition of ""good faith"" contained in ยง 1221(e) of the Act, this court has said: There is no question that HN6[
] the failure to exercise good faith within the meaning of the Act has a limited and restricted 
meaning. It is not to be construed liberally. . . . It does not mean ""good faith"" in a hazy or general way, nor does it mean 
unfairness. The existence or non-existence of ""good faith"" must be determined in the context of actual or threatened coercion or 
intimidation (citations omitted). In order to lack good faith the manufacturer's actions must be unfair and inequitable in addition to being for the purpose of 
coercion and intimidation (citations omitted). "

2d 787 (1978)."
984,27," Vincent claims coercion because of the suggestion of the president of BMCD and the vice-president of BLM and LMS that a 
merger or buy out of another dealer would be one way for the dealer to handle the full line. Sherman testified that he approached 
Satori about merger and was rejected, and that the matter ended there. It is straining to contend that Sherman's subjective 
feeling of coercion from the suggestion mentioned satisfied this element of a claim under the statute. Not the suggestion of 
merger but the unsatisfied insistence upon full-line representation was the cause of Vincent's rejection as a dealer."
984,28," Misallocation of cars by itself without any threat of sanctions is not actionable under the Dealers' Act. See Cecil Corley Motor 
Co. v. Gen. Motors Corp., 380 F. Supp. 819 (M.D.Tenn.1974). There was an uncontroverted showing that a fair share of 
available automobiles was furnished to Vincent, and there was an absence of any causal connection between the number of

985,31," ""No provision of (the Dealers' Act) shall repeal, modify, or supersede, directly or indirectly, any provision(s) of the antitrust 
laws of the United States"" 15 U.S.C. ยง 1224. We assume a reciprocal preservation of the reach of the Dealers' Act by the 
antitrust laws so that both types of statutes are to be afforded their full effect in view of each other. The Franchise Act reaches those activities of an automobile manufacturer which would constitute an unreasonable restraint of 
trade under the Sherman Act or another invalid trade practice. In the lack of good faith evaluation the presence or absence of 
such invalid trade practices is, of course, a foremost consideration. Randy's Studebaker Sales, Inc. v. Nissan Motor Corp., 533 F.2d 510, 516 (10th Cir. 1976). We are mindful of the comment in Marquis at 641, in connection with its rejection of antitrust claims made there, that the Dealers'

actionable antitrust violation."" The converse, no doubt, is also true, but far from precludes recognition of an inescapable

986,34," Although the two distributing organizations regarded each other as competitors, since each up to that time had been selling 
either Triumph (LMS) or MG (BMCD) but not the other, this does not make the British Leyland Agreement appointing each to the 
full line in different sections of California a horizontal conspiracy to divide geographic markets, at least not less (sic) one 
disregards the fact that LMS is a wholly-owned subsidiary of British Leyland (emphasis added). British Leyland answering brief at 14-15."
986,35," Although this agreement was signed only by BLM and BMCD, Vincent contends that it is implicit in the writing and in the 
surrounding circumstances that LMS was deemed a part and parcel of the agreement. Those portions of the agreement relied 
upon by Vincent are these: "
987,," ""C. In exchange therefor, the Distributor (I. e., BMCD) is willing to surrender its distribution rights under the Northern Agreement, 
together with any claim that it may have for the renewal of such agreement, to BLM In order that BLM may through its 
subsidiary, Leyland Motor Sales, Inc. (""LMS'), add distribution of Austin, MG and Jaguar to its existing Triumph and Land Rover 
distribution."" (CT 363; emphasis added.) ""As of November 1, 1973, BLM shall have the right to transfer distribution rights to another distributor (Including LMS ) through 
all or any part of the Development Area described in the Northern Agreement."" (CT 364; emphasis added.) ""3. Transfer of Distribution. The Distributor and BLM (For itself and its subsidiary, LMS ) pledge themselves to effect transfer of 
distribution rights in an orderly manner and with minimum disruption of the supply of cars and spare parts to dealers. Neither the 
Distributor, BLM, Nor LMS will enter into any extraordinary contracts or commitments in connection with distribution operations 
to be transferred, . . ."" etc. (CT 364; emphasis added.) "". . . if the amount determined under (2) is larger than (1), BLM Or LMS will pay the Distributor the net balance."" (CJ 366; 
emphasis added.) ""(e) The Distributor and BLM Or LMS will maintain records showing all sales under the foregoing provisions, and Each will 
supply to the other a statement signed by an officer and certifying as to the number of such sales."" (CJ 367; emphasis added.) ""(b) Without the prior consent of the other party, neither BLM (Nor LMS) nor the Distributor will renew or extend any dealer 
agreement now in force, nor will it appoint any new dealer or make any representations to any dealer as to his future status after 
transfer of distribution has been effected."" ""8. Warranties. BLM, For itself and for LMS, and Distributor each warrant and represent to the other as follows: . . ."" etc. (CT 
368, emphasis added.) Appellants' opening brief at 26, 27."
987,36," In so holding we do not foreclose the possibility that particular application of vertical restrictions might justify per se prohibition 
under Northern Pac. R. Co. But we do make clear that departure from the rule of reason standard must be based upon 
demonstrable economic effect rather than as in Schwinn ( U. S. v. Arnold Schwinn & Co., 388 U.S. 365, 87 S. Ct. 1856, 18 L. 
Ed. 2d 1249) upon formalistic line drawing. Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. at 58-59, 97 S. Ct. at 2562. "
988,," In Oreck Corp. v. Whirlpool Corp., 579 F.2d 126 (2d Cir.) (En banc ), Cert. denied, 439 U.S. 946, 99 S. Ct. 340, 58 L. Ed. 2d 338 
(1978), the majority held because of the vertical nature of the restraint that the rule of reason applied, while Judge Mansfield, 
dissenting, considered the Per se rule to have been invoked because of involvements of a horizontal nature. See also Note, 
Vertical Agreements to Terminate Competing Distributors, 92 Harv.L.Rev. 1160 (1979). Despite some ambivalence that may be 
encountered in this troublesome area, the facts of the present case render it more likely that a horizontal rather than a vertical 
agreement was operative."
988,37," The question of whether a horizontal or vertical division was involved does not alter the effect of the proof tending to show 
that in either event there was a geographic division of the market. The fact that there was common ownership or control of 
contracting corporations did not liberate them from the impact of the antitrust laws, and in any event each Leyland appellee 
could be deemed as having conspired with the independent company, BMCD. See Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. Int'l Parts Corp., 
392 U.S. 134, 141-42, 88 S. Ct. 1981, 20 L. Ed. 2d 982 (1968). Cf.  Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc. v. Hawaiian Oke & Liquors, 
Ltd., 416 F.2d 71, 82 (9th Cir. 1969), Cert. denied, 396 U.S. 1062, 90 S. Ct. 752, 24 L. Ed. 2d 755 (1970) (recognizing this 
general rule but holding that purely intra-corporate conspiracy is not enough to invoke it)."
988,38," In Gough v. Rossmoor Corp., 585 F.2d 381, 385 (9th Cir.), Cert. denied, 440 U.S. 936, 99 S. Ct. 1280, 59 L. Ed. 2d 494 
(1979), this court said that ""unless the alleged anticompetitive conduct is per se unreasonable, the fact that the conduct 
restrained trade in a relevant market is an essential part of plaintiff's case . . . and the burden of establishing it lies on him."" "
989,39," Sherman's own experience supported such a market definition. Vincent points to statements by defendants' employees to the 
effect that Triumph and MG competed and that both competed with ""sporty"" cars imported from Japan, Italy and Germany in the 
same price range. A damage study undertaken by Professor David A. Aaker, submitted to the district court by plaintiff as an 
addendum to an interrogatory reply, not only supported plaintiff's definition of the relevant market but described the reduction of 
competition resulting from the Rationalization Program in that market as ""significant"" both on the retail and wholesale levels. 
Vincent claimed that dealers in the Triumph and MG automobiles had been reduced from five to one in the market while the 
combining of the MG and Triumph shares of the market under a single distributor in the San Gabriel Valley established 
approximately 59% Total share as a consequence of the Rationalization Program. The defendants presented little direct rebuttal 
of these claims, their primary effort being to question plaintiff's definition as to both the product and geographical markets. Their 
data as to lack of economic impact related primarily to their own definition of the relevant market rather than to that of the 
plaintiff. Appellees suggested that the relevant market would be southern California rather than merely the San Gabriel Valley. Such 
does not appear from the record as a matter of law. Much less is there legal support for the contention made by BMCD in its 
reply to an interrogatory that ""plaintiffs' competitors in the sale of Triumph automobiles, parts and accessories included all retail 
dealers of foreign and domestic automobiles in the general price range of Triumphs (from $ 2,995) in California and adjacent 
areas (such as Las Vegas)."" BLM, LMS and BMCD in their replies to plaintiffs' interrogatories at another point said: ""During the 
one year that Gary Sherman was a Triumph dealer under the name of European Imports, it is assumed that his competitors 
were all the retail dealers of automobiles selling in the general price range of Triumphs (from $ 2,995 to.$ 4,095) in the City of 
Pasadena and in a broader area of Los Angeles County."" (Record p. 00210.)"
989,40," Plaintiffs point out that when the motion for summary judgment was submitted below and when they filed their principal brief in 
this case, they had assumed in line with the district court's decision in GTE Sylvania that the rule was different than as finally 
approved by this court and the Supreme Court, and that without further discovery they have been handicapped in addressing the 
question of whether defendants' conduct was unlawful under the rule of reason. Since, however, their ยง 2 claims necessarily 
involved similar elements from the beginning, we shall evaluate the record in its present state."
989,41," ""Plaintiffs should be given the full benefit of their proof without tightly compartmentalizing the various factual components and 
wiping the slate clean after scrutiny of each."" Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 699, 82 S. Ct. 
1404, 1410, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1962)."
989,42," It is true that the question of interchangeability within the claimed area has not yet been fully explored. But the entire question 
of relevant market where there are persuasive considerations advanced with respect to it, as here, is one of fact which we 
believe on the record before us it was inappropriate to resolve on summary judgment. Decisions holding that a single 
manufacturer's products cannot normally constitute the relevant market do not foreclose the plaintiff's claims as a matter of law, 
since plaintiff's position is that British Leyland products are only part of the relevant market. Nor does it appear as a matter of law 
that the Rationalization Program necessarily was lawful by reason of its procompetitive aspects. "

990,45," In McGeorge there had been no proof that the tie-in between Triumph and Rover reduced competition. Nor did the case deal 
with any conspiracy aspects of the Rationalization Program. The decision was upon trial and in view of the factual finding that 
Leyland's conduct toward McGeorge did not impede competition. ""(I)t is this fact which clearly distinguishes the case before us

than the fact that one distributor would be replaced by another. A related Dealers' Act claim also was rejected. That the 
circumstances were inapposite to those of the present case is demonstrated by the court's conclusion there: ""GM did not act in 
bad faith by initially requiring that the Dealership be located at a specified (and previously agreed to) site. Thereafter, 
Kohlenberg prompted GM's actions by unilaterally breaching the location provision of the Agreement."")."

] Direct evidence of specific intent to control prices or destroy competition is not indispensable when the claim is ""founded upon a substantial claim of restraint of trade"" I. e., a ยง 1 violation. In these circumstances the requisite specific intent 
may be inferred.  Trixler Brokerage Co. v. Ralston Purina Co., 505 F.2d 1045, 1051-52 (9th Cir. 1974); See Gough v. Rossmoor

relevant to determining whether such an inference is proper; but where a ยง 1 violation ""clearly exists"", proof of market power is 
unnecessary to support an inference of specific intent.  Hallmark Industry v. Reynolds Metals Co., 489 F.2d 8, 12-13 (9th Cir. 
1973), Cert. denied, 417 U.S. 932, 94 S. Ct. 2643, 41 L. Ed. 2d 235 (1974). Even though the restraint effected may be

Ct. 471, 77 L. Ed. 825 (1933); Greyhound Computer Corp. At 505, n. 37. The requirement that there be a demonstration that a 
defendant's specific intent to control prices or destroy competition has a ""dangerous probability of success"" may be satisfied 
either by direct proof of market power, Janich Bros., Inc. v. American Distilling Co., 570 F.2d 848, 853 (9th Cir. 1977), Cert.

F.2d 1196, 1205 (1975), Cert. denied, 425 U.S. 959, 96 S. Ct. 1741, 48 L. Ed. 2d 204 (1976)."
992,48," The evidence tending to establish an unlawful conspiracy coupled with that relating particularly to the attempted 
monopolization claim is sufficiently supportive of the conspiracy to monopolize formulation as to sustain against the motion for 
summary judgment the survival of plaintiff's claim on the latter theory also. In harmony with Pacific Coast Agricultural Export 
Ass'n at 1205, n. 13, we observe that possible jury consideration of the evidence concerning a conspiracy constituting an 
unreasonable restraint of trade must be kept in mind in determining the sufficiency of evidence to support both the attempted 
monopolization and conspiracy to monopolize charges without tight compartmentalization."
992,49," In Marquis, at 640, this court in concluding that violation of the antitrust laws had not been made out, stated: ""A 
manufacturer's refusal to deal with a distributor or a dealer does not violate the antitrust laws merely because it adversely affects 
the entity refused. In fact, such effects are immaterial when the refusal is ""for business reasons which are sufficient to the 
manufacturer . . . in the absence of any arrangement restraining trade.' Bushie v. Stenocord Corp., 460 F.2d 116, 119 (9th Cir. 
1972) (quoting Ricchetti (v. Meister Brau, Inc.), 431 F.2d (1211) at 1214 (9th Cir.)) (footnote omitted)."" Although the evidence 
there had already been developed for trial purposes, there was no showing of market effects, nor was there any indication of a 
conspiracy between competitors as here. Cf.  Moore I, 473 F.2d 328 (9th Cir. 1973) (where the court on surely more satisfactory 
but still fragmentary economic data bearing particularly on monopoly issues, required the case to go to trial on the latter issues 
as well as on the primary issue of tying, and thus made possible later definitive and differentiating ruling in another leading case, 
Moore II, Supra, on the basis of a fully-developed record). "
993,50," This agreement shall be deemed canceled, without further action by the Distributor (LMS) in the event of termination or 
cancellation of the Distributor's Distribution Agreement with (BLM) or upon the withdrawal for any reason of the right of the 
Distributor to purchase (Triumphs) and resell the same within the area within which the Dealer is located. The Dealer 
acknowledges that all of his rights under this Agreement are subordinated to, and conditioned upon the continuance of, the 
ability of the Distributor to supply the Dealer with the Products."
993,51," Q. If any of the above events occur would the present dealer organization retain their franchise or would it revert to the 
privately owned distributor? A. We see no reason why a good dealer's franchise should not continue whoever the distributor may be. The council requested that in order to retain the Triumph dealer body's confidence a moratorium was (sic) declared on the 
appointment of new Triumph dealers. The Council also requested that in the event that any Triumph dealer now operating under 
a Zone should find himself operating under a private distributor after the rationalization was complete that British Leyland would 
retain control of Triumph dealer appointments and cancellations for a period of two years after the date of such distribution 
change. British Leyland agreed that the matter would be given consideration. (Record pp. 00380-81.)"

employees as plaintiffs, and the certification of the suit as a class action.  Because the complaint must be dismissed on other 
grounds, this subject need not be further pursued. "
1037,6," .  The other cases relied upon by ACTWU are similarly distinguishable.  Carpenters District Council v. United Contractors 
Association of Ohio, Inc., 484 F.2d 119 (6th Cir. 1973), Modified, 539 F.2d 1092 (6th Cir. 1976), and International Association of 
Heat and Frost Insulators and Asbestos Workers v. United Contractors Association, Inc., 483 F.2d 384 (3rd Cir. 1972), Modified, 
494 F.2d 1353 (3rd Cir. 1974), represented, as characterized by the Court in East Central Ohio Building and Construction 
Trades Council v. Landmark, Inc., (N.D.Ohio, April 26, 1977), an effort by the defendants ""to lessen competition by organizing 
and directing a ""sham' union."" East Central, slip op. at 5.  Thus in the International Association case, the complaint alleged that 
""an object of the illegal combination and conspiracy is to prevent the Unions from representing for collective bargaining purposes 
employees of the members of the Association and thus to obtain A competitive advantage over employer parties to collective 
bargaining arrangements with the Unions . . ."" 483 F.2d at 387 (emphasis added).  In East Central, the defendants were charged 
with comparable monopolistic objectives, albeit by a different device.  East Central distinguished Prepmore Apparel, Inc. v. 
Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, 431 F.2d 1004 (5th Cir. 1970), upon which Stevens relies in the case at bar, 
because the complaint in Prepmore alleged only a conspiracy to ""injure the union and destroy its operations . . ."" 431 F.2d at 
1006. The Court in East Central observed that in Prepmore, ""there was apparently no allegation that the offending employer 
conspired to monopolize or otherwise restrain trade."" Slip op. at 6.  But the allegations in the complaint at bar mirror those of 
Prepmore, since their essential thrust is that Stevens, in conspiracy with others, seeks to frustrate the union.  Relying upon 
Apex, Supra, and subsequent Supreme Court authority, the Fifth Circuit said in Prepmore : ""There is no indication, however remote, of a conspiracy or combination on the part of Prepmore and Blue Bell to restrain 
competition in the marketing of Prepmore's goods.  In sum, the allegations of the first count of the counterclaim do not rise to the 
level of alleging a restraint of the type to which the Sherman Act is directed.  Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, supra. It follows that 
the district court did not err in dismissing the count."" 431 F.2d at 1007. See also United Brick & Clay Workers v. Junction City Clay Co., 158 F.2d 552 (6th Cir. 1946), Infra. "

1055,2," .  ""Passing-on"" usually means the process whereby a middleman in the chain of distribution who has been overcharged by a 
manufacturer or by a producer adjusts his prices upward in sales to a lower level in the chain to reflect the overcharge. This case 
presents the converse of that situation.  Here the passing-on was the result of alleged depressed prices fixed by retailers and 
imposed upon the middlemen (slaughterhouses and packers).  In turn, the middlemen passed-on the undercharge, the 
depression in prices, to the primary producers (cattle ranchers and feeders). "

these cases. "
1058,8," .  Before Illinois Brick, a strong case could have been made that the Hanover Shoe decision rested primarily on the Court's 
perception that the middleman, and not the remote purchaser, is the likeliest enforcer of the antitrust laws.  Although it is 
probable that Hanover, like most middlemen, passed on much of the overcharge, recognition of a passing-on defense would 
have reduced the incentives for middlemen to sue.  Professor Posner has observed: ""The choice was thus between 
overcompensating Hanover and underdeterring United.  The Court's preference for the former is consistent with the view that the 
primary purpose of antitrust damage actions is to deter violations of law."" R. Posner, Antitrust Cases, Economic Notes and Other 
Materials 149 (1974).  See Illinois Brick, 431 U.S. at 752-53, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (Brennan, J., dissenting). In Illinois Brick, however, the Court observed that the Hanover Shoe decision rested primarily on the difficulty-of-proof problem, 
and not on the deterrence rationale.  Illinois Brick, 431 U.S. at 720 n.12, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 n.12."
1058,9," .   Normally the impact of a single change in the relevant conditions cannot be measured after the fact; indeed a businessman 
may be unable to state whether, had one fact been different (a single supply less expensive, general economic conditions more 
buoyant, or the labor market tighter, for example), he would have chosen a different price.  Equally difficult to determine, in the 
real economic world rather than an economist's hypothetical model, is what effect a change in the company's price will have on 
its total sales.  Finally, costs per unit for a different volume of total sales are hard to estimate.  Even if it could be shown that the 
buyer raised his price in response to, and in the amount of, the overcharge and that his margin of profit and total sales had not 
thereafter declined, there would remain the nearly insuperable difficulty of demonstrating that the particular plaintiff could not or 
would not have raised his prices absent the overcharge or maintained the higher price had the overcharge been discontinued."
1058,392," U.S. at 492-93, 88 S. Ct. at 2231."
1058,10," .  A serious risk of overlapping liability would remain even under a rule permitting the offensive use of passing-on only in 
situations in which the defendant could use a passing-on defense, unless the scope of passing-on were narrowly restricted to "
1059,," cases in which the incidence of overcharges could be established with certainty.  That risk would arise from the risk of 
inconsistent factfindings in separate lawsuits by direct and indirect purchasers. Note, Scaling the Illinois Brick Wall: The Future 
of Indirect Purchasers in Antitrust Litigation, 63 Cornell L.Rev. 309, 319 n.43 (1978). The magnitude of that risk would vary 
directly with the speculativeness of the proof of the incidence of the overcharge. By narrowly limiting the use of passing-on to 
cases in which the overcharge can be traced with ease and certainty, see part II, B of this opinion below, the Supreme Court has 
all but eliminated this risk of duplicative liability."
1059,11," .  See generally J. Hibdon, Price and Welfare Theory 244-53 (Monopoly pricing); 264-67 (Monopsony) (1969); K. George & J. 
Shorey, The Allocation of Resources 150-52 (1978). "
1060,12," .  In the case of monopoly price-fixing, the price-fixing generally raises the price of all goods that incorporate the product 
subject to the price-fixing. If the conspirators sell directly to the consuming public, the only businesses adversely affected are 
those in industries that supply complementary goods.  If the conspirators do not sell directly to the consuming public, then the 
product is but an input in the production of other goods or services.  By raising the cost of that input, the price-fixing conspiracy 
might conceivably have the effect of driving marginal firms that use the input out of the market.  The likelihood of this occurring 
depends upon the magnitude of the cost of the input relative to the purchasing firm's total costs of production and on the 
elasticity of demand for the firm's product.  A fifteen percent rise in the cost of beef, for example, threatens the profitability of a 
steakhouse far more than that of a grocery store.  The impact will be greatest in the rare case of a firm that simply buys and 
resells only the good affected by the price-fixing conspiracy. Most firms that sell directly to the typical monopsony or oligopsony price-fixing conspiracy, however, are in a position analogous 
to that of the single-product distributor who purchases his product from price-fixing conspirators.  The good affected by the price-
fixing conspiracy is likely to be the seller's only product or to represent a significant percentage of the seller's output.  In general, 
the impact on a firm's revenues of a purchaser price-fixing scheme aimed at the product it sells is greater than the impact on a 
firm's costs of a monopoly price-fixing scheme affecting an input into the firm's product."
1060,13," .  If Illinois Brick did not involve such a balancing, even implicitly, then the appellants' argument that the greater harm flowing 
from purchaser, as compared with seller, price-fixing, justifies special treatment of passing-on problems in monopsony cases 
loses its premise.  Formally, at least, Illinois Brick involved no such balancing as suggested in the text.  The Illinois Brick holding 
is essentially the rule of mutuality.  That rule was justified almost entirely by reference to the problem of overlapping liability, and 
the Court's focus on the risk of overlapping liability was a result of its assumption that direct purchasers, as well as indirect, 
would likely sue the price-fixers.  On the surface of it, then, Illinois Brick does not acknowledge that its pass-on rule involves any 
significant sacrifice of antitrust enforcement: in those cases in which the rule bars indirect purchasers from suing, the direct 
purchasers, it is assumed, will likely come to the fore."
1060,14," .   E. g., Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 1969, 395 U.S. 100, 89 S. Ct. 1562, 23 L. Ed. 2d 129; Continental Ore

Ct. 996, 92 L. Ed. 1328. The cases cited by the appellants, with the exception of Mandeville Island Farms, were cases involving 
monopolization or exclusionary practices, not price-fixing. None involved passing-on theories of damage. "
1061,15," .  Indeed, many of the allegations strongly suggest that all the non-defendant co-conspirators adverted to in the complaints are 
food retailers.  Paragraph 34 of the MPIA Amended and Substituted Complaint, for example, states in part: b. Specifications have been established by the defendant retail food chains and other co-conspirators for the beef they buy.  In 
most instances, the specifications for beef carcasses or parts thereof have varied . . .  thus eliminating competition between and 
among the defendants and other co-conspirators. c. The defendant food chains and other co-conspirators have allocated retail marketing areas . . . . d. The defendant food chains and other co-conspirators have agreed not to compete with one another on a price basis in 
purchasing beef at wholesale . . . . e. . . .  Through uniform entry into the wholesale beef market or uniform withdrawal from the wholesale beef market, the 
defendant food chains and other co-conspirators have combined to monopolize to affect the demand for beef products and 
artificially depress the wholesale price of beef products to an unreasonably low level, which level is directly reflected by the 
Yellow Sheet price and the ""Safeway price,' and which prices are directly passed on to the beef producer. "
1062,16," .  ""Another situation in which market losses have been superseded and the pass-on defense might be permitted is where the 
direct purchaser is owned or controlled by its customer. Cf.  Perkins v. Standard Oil Co., 395 U.S. 642, 648, 89 S. Ct. 1871, 
1874, 23 L. Ed. 2d 599 (1969); In re Western Liquid Asphalt Cases, 487 F.2d 191, (at) 197, 199."" But ""reliance upon direct 
purchasers to bring suit is wholly unjustified when they are controlled by the prospective defendants"".  The Supreme Court, 
1976, 91 Harv.L.Rev. 70, 230 (1977)."
1062,17," .  That paragraph states: Most slaughterers and packers have standing agreements with various receivers, including the defendant chain stores and other 
co-conspirators, for certain quantities of beef each week.  With knowledge of their weekly requirements and of the prices quoted 
in the Yellow Sheet or the ""Safeway Price,"" the packers and slaughterers directly pass down the price established by the 
defendant retail food chains. The packers and slaughterers in aggregate do not suffer any diminution of sales, purchases, 
margins or profits as a result of this artificially low price. "
1063,18," .  The only explanation given is the Chapparal plaintiffs' lame assertion that it took a long time to divine the meaning and 
implications of the Illinois Brick Decision. "
1064,19," .  In Hanover Shoe the Court emphasized the inadequacy of economic theory to the task of tracing the incidence of an 
overcharge. See note 7 Supra.  In Illinois Brick the Court elaborated on the point.  The Court noted that economic theory 
provides a formula for determining the incidence of an overcharge, but that the analysis rests on ""an array of simplifying 
assumptions"" and assumes knowledge of the elasticities of supply and demand in the relevant market.  431 U.S. at 741-42, 97 
S. Ct. 2061. The unacceptability of the assumptions and the near-impossibility of measuring the relevant elasticities renders 
such incidence analysis little more than a guessing game in practice, the Court seemed to suggest.  The Court was concerned 
not so much with the complexity of such proof as with its speculative character."
1064,20," .  In Yoder Bros., Inc. v. California-Florida Plant Corp., 5 Cir. 1976, 537 F.2d 1347, Cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1094, 97 S. Ct. 1108, 
51 L. Ed. 2d 540, a panel of this Court reversed a treble damages judgment that was erroneously reduced by recognition at trial "
1065,," of a passing-on defense.  The Court ruled that the defense was not available because the evidence of the party asserting the 
defense did not demonstrate the applicability of the cost-plus exception suggested in Hanover Shoe.  The Court found that the 
evidence did not show the effect of a price change on the direct purchaser's total sales or unit costs for a different sales volume.  
Under the rule of Yoder Bros., the passing-on defense is unavailable absent evidence that the direct purchaser did not suffer 
harm in the form of lost sales volume, even if it is proved that the direct purchaser passed on the entirety of the overcharge. Application of the Illinois Brick mutuality principle would suggest that, because under Yoder Bros. these defendants could not 
assert a passing-on defense at all in a treble damages suit brought by the packers and slaughterers absent proof that the 
packers and slaughterers suffered no loss of volume as a result of the alleged price-fixing, the cattlemen should be barred from 
using passing-on theory offensively against the defendants unless they demonstrate that the packers and slaughterers suffered 
no loss of volume.  If this is so, then the bar against use of passing-on is absolute, for it would be impossible, not simply 
""virtually"" impossible to make such a showing.  Indeed, Yoder Bros. has the effect of eliminating the passing-on defense 
altogether, except perhaps in the very narrow case of a pre-existing, fixed quantity cost-plus contract. We do not believe, however, that the Yoder Bros. Court's treatment of the pass-on issue is viable after Illinois Brick.  The Yoder 
Bros. Court's very literal reading of Hanover Shoe to require parties asserting a pass-on defense to prove that the intermediary 
suffered no harm whatsoever rested, we think, on its view that the private treble damage action is of ""overriding importance . . .  
in the antitrust enforcement scheme."" Id. at 1375. Indeed, Hanover Shoe was plausibly read, before Illinois Brick, as resting on 
the view that the strong policy in favor of antitrust enforcement justifies buying enforcement at the expense of overcompensating 
plaintiffs.  See note 6 Supra.  In Illinois Brick, however, the Court denigrated the importance of the antitrust enforcement 
rationale in the decision of Hanover Shoe and characterized the difficulty-of-proof problem as the key to Hanover Shoe.  431 
U.S. at 732 n.12, 97 S. Ct. 2061 n.12. Indeed, Illinois Brick itself demonstrated that the policy in favor of vigorous antitrust 
enforcement must sometimes give way in face of the risk of overpunishing antitrust violators.  The Yoder Bros. panel would not 
have taken so niggardly a view of the passing-on defense had it had the benefit of the Illinois Brick Court's interpretation of the 
Hanover Shoe opinion, or had it known the implications that its decision might have for antitrust plaintiffs after Illinois Brick. Post-Illinois Brick commentary, moreover, has generally assumed that the issue of the impact on the direct purchaser's sales 
volume of an overcharge should not be dispositive in a case involving the offensive use of passing-on theory.  E. g., Note, 
Recovery by Indirect Purchasers and the Functions of Antitrust Treble Damages, 55 Texas L.Rev. 1445, 1455 n.69 (1977). See 
also, Note, Scaling the Illinois Brick Wall: The Future of Indirect Purchasers in Antitrust Litigation, 63 Cornell L.Rev. 309, 329 
n.87 (1978)."
1065,21," .  Because these cases come up on appeal from dismissals on the pleadings, we are not concerned with the question whether 
packers and slaughterers in fact applied pricing formulae without deviation, or with the question whether the formulae employed 
were such that a change in wholesale prices in a given region had a predetermined effect on the price offered feeders in the 
region by the packers and the slaughterers. We must assume, for purposes of these appeals, that the plaintiffs could 
demonstrate that both questions are to be answered in the affirmative. "
1066,22," .  In Hanover Shoe the Court pointed out that in attempting to prove a pass-on a litigant would have to demonstrate that the 
intermediary would not have raised his price absent the overcharge. 392 U.S. at 493 and n.9, 88 S. Ct. 2224 and n.9. This is a 
causation issue.  The Court's general rejection of the use of passing-on theory rested in part on its view that this issue of 
causation could not, except in rare cases, be resolved with adequate certainty.  See note 17 Supra.  If, however, an intermediary 
over a long period of time consistently determines his purchase price by applying a fixed formula to the price he will receive 
when he in turn sells, the objection based on the speculativeness of the causation evidence disappears.  Our legal system 
routinely permits triers of fact, as indeed it must, to infer causation, or the lack of causation, from the observation of deviation Vel 
non from long-indulged habit or practice."
1066,23," .  That view was recently taken by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Mid-West Paper Products Co. v. Continental Group, 
Inc., 596 F.2d 573 (1979), As amended April 5, 1979."
1066,24," .  The appellees have suggested that the plaintiffs will have to trace their cattle through the chain of production to establish that 
the cattle they sold to packers and slaughterhouses were in turn sold, in carcass form, to members of the alleged retail chain "
1067,," conspiracy. If the prices allegedly established by the defendants were uniformly followed by the beef retailing industry, as the 
plaintiffs allege, however, tracing would be unnecessary.  The plaintiffs' theory of damages is not in all respects a pass-on type 
of theory.  Their theory, stated most broadly, is that the activities of the alleged price-fixing conspiracy depressed wholesale 
prices generally, and not simply the prices paid by members of the conspiracy, and that packers and slaughterers based their 
purchases of live cattle on the depressed wholesale price.  It is immaterial whether or not a steer purchased from a plaintiff 
found its way into the hands of a conspirator retailer.  It is enough if, as alleged, the conspirators' activities caused a general 
depression in wholesale prices and the intermediary purchasing from a plaintiff based his pricing decision on the depressed 
wholesale beef price. We disagree with the recent ruling of a divided panel of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals that one who deals with a 
nonconspiring competitor of price-fixing firms lacks standing to sue those firms for treble damages.  See Mid-West Paper 
Products Co. v. Continental Group, Inc., supra note 23, 596 F.2d 587. That decision supports the appellants' contention, for if a 
person who deals directly with a nonconspiring competitor lacks standing, then an indirect purchaser from, or an indirect seller 
to, a nonconspiring competitor of the defendants A fortiori lacks standing.  We agree with the dissent in Mid-West Paper 
Products that such a plaintiff satisfies the ""target area"" test for standing, See Part IV below, and that the injury suffered by such a 
plaintiff satisfies the tests for proximate causation.  See 596 F.2d at 597. "

1070,26," .  Part 1.80 states in relevant part: In some complex cases it becomes apparent at the preliminary pretrial conference or shortly thereafter that the determination of 
a legal question will expedite the disposition of the cause.  This is particularly the case where the nature and scope of discovery 
and further pretrial proceedings would be substantially affected by the determination of the preliminary legal question.  For 
example, in the electrical equipment civil antitrust cases the question whether fraudulent concealment would toll the running of 
the statute of limitations was one of the most important questions.  It was very desirable to secure a determination of this 
question as early as possible, for if the statute was not tolled by fraudulent concealment, the discovery would be comparatively 
narrow in scope of time and a summary judgment on some or all issues could be rendered in many cases. Manual for Complex Litigation 80 (1977)."

standardization the variety of offerings open to buyers and competitive differentiation open to sellers will inevitably be reduced, 
as they are when the product is standardized. . . . But the standardization of non-price terms, like standardization of product, will 
have other effects. It will in a sense serve to channel all transactions into a single, better integrated market; buyers will more 
easily be able to compare their alternative opportunities as to the unstandardized terms, most notably price, and sellers will more 
likely be aware of competitive offerings. L. Sullivan, Supra, ยง 99, at 277-78. "
1077,6," Plaintiffs allege that the defendants have not reduced the price of beer to reflect the termination of free credit. As a result, the 
measure of damages for plaintiffs' injury, it is argued, should be equal to the cost of financing the beer inventories. Three 
different methods for determining the amount of damages were suggested by plaintiffs: (1) measure the opportunity cost of any 
new capital that plaintiffs invested in the business; (2) measure the opportunity cost of borrowing outside funds to finance the 
inventories; or, (3) measure the reduction in the value of plaintiffs' business occasioned by the financing of inventories out of 
cash on hand, thereby reducing the liquidity of the business. While not specifically sanctioning any of these methods, difficulty in 
measuring the amount of damages should not preclude plaintiffs from establishing that injury was suffered. "

1079,3," Lest we be led to a false conclusion by the use of ambiguous concepts, it is necessary to point out that the statement of the 
majority that ""an agreement to eliminate credit could sharpen competition with respect to price by removing a barrier perceived 
by some sellers to market entry,"" is curiously inappropriate in this case. I am quite unpersuaded by this strange assertion, nor do 
I subscribe to the suggestion that it would justify an agreement to fix prices. No person seeking entry to the beer distributors' 
market is a party to this case. Furthermore, how another distributor who would abide by the agreement could add to price 
competition is difficult to understand since the agreement would ""cripple (his) freedom . . . and thereby restrain (his) ability to sell 
in accordance with (his) own judgment."" Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 340 U.S. 211, 213, 71 S. Ct.

1089,2," The North County area has in recent years experienced the immigration of many new residents.  This influx has resulted in an 
increased demand for housing.  The current need, coupled with inflationary pressures, has forced many new residents to seek 
alternatives to conventional housing.  Thus an expanding market for mobilehomes has been an outgrowth of these forces.  
Mobilehome housing, as consumer goods, is comprised of two components: mobilehomes, a moveable commodity, and 
mobilehome park space, a right of use of real property.  Within a particular geographical area, these two components are

1116,4," .  Of course, the seven million dollar attachment includes property that is also covered by the motion for a preliminary injunction. 
The overlap should not be counted twice, since attachment alone constitutes a sufficient property deprivation to trigger due 
process requirements. In addition, because NET no longer distributes Toyota automobiles in New England, it may be that NET's 
stock has no value apart from the value of the company's assets. If so, the stock would add nothing to the total value of the 
property plaintiffs wish to encumber. On the other hand, NET's stock may be worth more than the attachment amount of $ 
5,000,000 or even more than likely damages of $ 12,000,000. At this point, we lack sufficient information to make these 
determinations. "
1120,5," .  Prior to 1972, NET itself had subcontracted the delivery function to independent common carriers."
1120,6," .  This trend appears to be most marked in those opinions which analyze justifications as affirmative defenses; however, their 
teachings apply with equal force to the single product issue. "
1123,7," .  In oral argument, defendants contended that the dealers suffered no injury at all because they passed on any overcharges to 
consumers. In general defendants who are direct purchasers cannot make use of a pass-on theory to defend against a private 
antitrust damages action.  Illinois Brick v. Illinois, 1977, 431 U.S. 720, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707; Hanover Shoe, Inc. v.

1125,8," .  Even if proof of individual coercion were an element of a tying violation, it appears from an examination of the affidavit 
evidence that there is a reasonable likelihood that plaintiffs would prevail on this issue. Only in 1972 did NET switch from hiring 
independent common carriers to using its own transportation facilities. Dealers who voluntarily accepted centralized delivery with 
the use of independent contractors could not also be deemed to have agreed to delivery by NET itself. The switch-over appears 
to have been a unilateral NET decision pursuant to the general terms of the standard dealer franchise agreement reserving the 
seller's right to control delivery. Dealers were not allowed to negotiate this new arrangement; they could either accept it or risk 
termination of their franchise. See, Toyota Dealer Sales and Service Agreement, Article XIII, P B(3) (most recent agreement) 
(Pltff's Ex. 1 to 5/10/76 Anderson Dep). Considering the large investment of each dealer in his ongoing business and the fact 
that no dealer could purchase Toyotas from another distributor, the latter alternative was hardly a realistic one. NET, therefore, 
exercised its power in the tying product market, its economically powerful position vis a vis its dealers, to coerce compliance with 
the new delivery system. Cf., F. T. C. v. Texaco, 1968, 393 U.S. 223, 226-29, 89 S. Ct. 429, 21 L. Ed. 2d 394."

dealers did not object to the NET delivery scheme. We attach little weight to this highly informal, self-serving study. "

1134,11," The rule read as follows: Section 5 Solicitations.  On a cooperative sale, only the listing participant is authorized to make any contact with the neighbors 
with sold cards, brochures, letters and the like, except with the consent of the listing broker. The Rule was withdrawn in 1978.  The district court concluded that the fact of this advertising restriction ""does not help plaintiffs 
because rules relating to advertising are independent of rules relating to commission splits."" Memorandum and Order of 
February 14, 1977.  However, Penne's claim against the Board does not rest solely on the issue of ""punitive"" commission splits; 
the claim is rather that the Board has been involved in a conspiracy to fix and maintain brokerage fees.  The Board's advertising 
restriction would conceivably have something to do with such a conspiracy."

monopoly in the aforesaid interstate trade and commerce in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act in the following ways, 
among others: a. Actual and potential competition between MGM and Columbia will be substantially lessened; and b. Concentration will be increased to the detriment of actual and potential competition."" Paragraph 6 alleges: "
1172,," ""6. On or about December 26, 1978, defendant Tracinda began its tender offer for approximately 1,750,000 shares of the 
common stock of Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as ""Columbia'), representing approximately 19% Of

otherwise to bring about, or in attempting to bring about, the substantial lessening of competition. "
1173,5," .  The Government asserts that the test for ""investment"" should turn solely on whether the effect of the acquisition is or may be 
substantially to lessen competition. Such an interpretation would give absolutely no meaning to the 2-pronged specific language 
Congress deliberately chose to include in the investment exemption and it would completely obliterate the investment 
exemption. Thus this Court doubts the validity of such an approach. In view of this Court's conclusions in respect to the effect of 
this acquisition, even if this approach were taken, the Court's decision for defendants herein would not change on this 
investment exemption issue."
1173,6," .  This is not to say that the only two possible purposes are investment or control. In United States v. du Pont & Co., 353 U.S. 
586, 77 S. Ct. 872, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1057 (1957), the Court found that the acquisition by du Pont of General Motors stock was not 
made solely for investment based upon du Pont's use of its General Motors stock position to remain a major supplier to General 
Motors. In the present action, however, since the Government's position is that defendants purchased this stock for control as 
opposed to investment, this control-investment distinction is relevant. "
1174,7, .  Columbia wanted the restrictions to last ten (10) years. The defendants would only agree to a three (3) year period.
1174,8," .  The Government also pointed out that the restrictions on Kerkorian and Tracinda could terminate at any time because the 
contract provides for an early termination in the event of the withdrawal of certain key managerial persons from employment at 
Columbia. Yet here again for the Court to base its judgment on this possibility would call for speculation: speculation concerning 
whether these key persons will ever withdraw, and speculation concerning the conditions that would exist at the time of any such 
withdrawal. Actually, this contract provision gives us further evidence of defendants' investment intent, since it clearly illustrates 
defendants' undoubted commitment and loyalty to the present management of Columbia. "
1175,9," .  When one considers that even if divestiture were granted with respect to the Tracinda stock, Kerkorian would still be a 
substantial stockholder with 5% And as such would have access to the management in order to voice his opinion, the 
Government's position that the additional 19% Of Columbia stock gives Kerkorian a greater voice is absurd in view of the stature 
of the people in the management of Columbia. Indeed the acquisition by Tracinda actually undermines Kerkorian's position since 
the Stockholders' Agreement restricts the use of Kerkorian's stock, as well as Tracinda's, while prior to that Agreement there 
were no restrictions on Kerkorian's personal holdings."
1175,10," .  In the substantive provisions of the first two paragraphs of Section 7, Congress showed concern for the probable future 
consequences of the acquisition by utilizing the language ""May be substantially to lessen competition."" On the other hand, with 
the investment exemption, Congress exhibited a concern for the past and present effect of the acquisition by utilizing the 
language ""and not Using the same . . . to bring about . . . the substantial lessening of competition."" Thus while evidence of 
competitive conduct since the acquisition may not be a determining factor when discussing whether a violation of the substantive 
provisions of Section 7 has occurred, Ash Grove Cement Co. v. F.T.C., 577 F.2d 1368, 1378-1380 (9th Cir. 1978), this evidence 
is of primary concern when determining the application of the investment exemption. See Anaconda Co. v. Crane Co., 411 F. 
Supp. 1210, 1219 (S.D.N.Y.1975). "
1178,11," .  This is not to say that this Court will look to the world-wide effects for all purposes. This Court is well aware of the limits 
contained within Section 7 when it refers to any section of the Country. The Court's conclusion with respect to the geographic 
market rests in a recognition of the extent to which the world-wide nature of this industry effects competition here in the United 
States. "
1179,12," .  The possible vertical aspects of this acquisition have never been raised by the Government and are not properly before the 
Court. Even if these effects were before the Court, this decision would not be altered. The present contract between MGM and 
UA prevents any vertical consolidation between MGM and Columbia. This contract runs through 1983. This Court will not 
speculate with respect to what conditions will exist at that time and will not base this ruling on such speculation. Furthermore, the 
vertical aspects are taken into consideration later in the Court's conclusions with regard to the competitive effect of this 
acquisition even if the line of commerce is assumed to be production And distribution, which it is not."
1179,13," .  If divestiture were to be ordered with respect to Tracinda's holdings, Kerkorian would still retain a substantial interest in 
Columbia and possibly would no longer be restricted by the Stockholders' Agreement. Thus there might arguably be less of a 
likelihood that competitively sensitive information will fall into the wrong hands so long as Tracinda retains its stock and the 
Stockholders' Agreement remains in effect."
1179,14," .  As used in the context of the Variety lists, gross rentals means the total amount a distributor receives from an exhibitor for 
one particular motion picture. "
1180,15," .  In its complaint, the Government alleged other uses for motion pictures to be for commercial television broadcasts, pay cable 
television broadcasts, and for use in the home video disc and cassette playback units. The Variety lists do not purport to 
measure the income from these sources. Thus, again, the relevance of this data must be questioned. "
1181,16," .  In determining whether there has been a violation of Section 7, this Court is primarily concerned with the probable future 
effects of the acquisition. The present condition of the industry and the participants to the acquisition is of chief importance. 
Evidence of past conditions can also be helpful in determining future effects. The further one retreats into the past, however, the 
less relevant will be the evidence retrieved. In view of MGM's major reorganization of late 1973, this Court holds that the 
statistics and other evidence alleged to show the volume of commerce and the market shares of individual firms in the motion 
picture industry in years prior to 1974 do not represent current conditions and do not aid in predicting the probable competitive 
effects of defendants' acquisition of Columbia stock. Accordingly, such evidence of years prior to 1974 is held to be inadmissible. "
1183,17," .  Incidentally, the Government's non-expert witnesses were drawn chiefly from small film exhibitors and all of these witnesses, 
curiously enough, testified that they had no evidence of any act or threat, that could by the wildest imagination be traced to either 
of the defendants, that would tend to show that the defendants had purchased any portion of the Columbia stock other than 
solely for investment, or that the defendants had used, were using, or threatened in any way to use the stock by voting or 
otherwise to bring about or in attempting to bring about the substantial lessening of competition. Nor could the Government 
witnesses give a shred of credible evidence that the effect of the Columbia stock acquisition was, could be, may be, or might 
even possibly be, substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce in any section of 
the country. Moreover, these Government witnesses, which ran the gamut from an admitted pornographer, through small, middle size and 
one or two fairly large film exhibitors, to retired financial experts without any recent expertise other than occasional consultations, 
and the chief of the ""Star Wars"" producer, in every instance but one or two vague guesses or opinions, admitted that the relevant 
line of commerce was production, Not production And distribution, and that there is no concentration, monopoly or denial of 
access to new producers in this relevant line of commerce. Even some of the Government witnesses opined that the relevant 
geographical market is world-wide, and not merely the United States or the United States and Canada, and that competition in 
production was and is being increasingly manifest, in its effect, both in increasing competition in the United States and 
increasing competition in every section of the United States in film production. "

1224,14," The legislative intent of FSIA does state that a "" ""regular course of commercial conduct' includes the carrying on of a 
commercial enterprise such as a mineral extraction company, an airline or a state trading corporation."" House Report No. 94-
1487 at 16, 5 U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News (1976) pp. 6614-6615. Plaintiff contends that because the OPEC member nations have a proprietary interest in the oil companies which are extracting 
the oil from within their respective territories, the price fixing activities in which the defendants engage are necessarily 
""commercial"" in view of this legislative intent. While it may be true that through their activities as partial or total owners of these 
companies, the defendant nations do engage in commercial activities, this does not mean, and the legislative intent does not 
support the conclusion, that all activities, even those remotely connected with these companies, are necessarily commercial. 
The fact that a nation owns and operates an airline company, does not mean that all government activities regulating the use of 
airspace, or the ingress and egress of airplanes to and from the nation's airports, are commercial activities. Accordingly, we must 
look to the specific activities in which the defendants engage. Here, a clear distinction must be drawn between the activities each government engages in by virtue of its proprietary interests 
and the activities in which it engages by virtue of its status as a sovereign. The activities of which plaintiff complains are clearly 
governmental. These activities are engaged in by the defendants in their status as sovereigns and not in their status as 
proprietors. This determination is conclusively established by looking to the nature of these activities and comparing them with 
governmental activities of other nations as we have already done. This determination is further supported by the activities of the nations herein involved. Prior to Any proprietary interest in any oil 
extracting company, each defendant nation set the terms of the withdrawal of its resources, through the mediums of taxation and 
royalties. Thus, the defendants were engaging in this governmental conduct setting terms for crude production long before they 
obtained any ownership in any production companies. It necessarily follows that these activities are engaged in by virtue of each 
defendant's status as a sovereign because these activities preceded Any proprietary interest. Therefore, the essential nature of 
the activity is governmental. Furthermore, this governmental nature does not change merely because the medium through which the activity is accomplished 
has changed. When defendants' obtained ownership interests in their respective oil production companies, the media being 
utilized by the defendants to fix the terms of oil extraction were altered and were changed. Through their proprietary interests the 
nations could directly control the establishment of these terms. But this change in format does not change the essential nature of 
the activity, which is still governmental. As a result, the conclusion is irrefutable that these activities are governmental in nature. "

1226,17," Plaintiff has argued that Parker v. Brown has lost its effect through the decisions in Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 
773, 95 S. Ct. 2004, 44 L. Ed. 2d 572 (1975) and LaFayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., 435 U.S. 389, 98 S. Ct. 1123, 55 L. 
Ed. 2d 364 (1978). Goldfarb was an action challenging under ยง 1 of the Sherman Act a minimum fee schedule published by the 
Fairfax County Bar Association and enforced by Virginia State Bar. The State Bar and the County Bar attempted to use the 
Parker v. Brown doctrine as a defense because the State Bar was a State Agency and, as argued by the County Bar, the ethical 
codes and the activities of the State Bar prompted it to issue fee schedules. The Court, however, rejected these arguments, 
holding that anticompetitive activities must be compelled by direction of the State acting as a sovereign before the Parker v. 
Brown doctrine may be relied upon.  421 U.S. at 791, 95 S. Ct. 2004. The Court, finding that these activities were not compelled 
by the State, held that the Parker v. Brown doctrine did not apply to the activities of these State and County Bar defendants. Here, the activities in which the OPEC defendants are engaged, are conducted by each sovereign nation itself. Thus we can 
only conclude that the nation by its direction has compelled these activities. Our case here is clearly distinguishable from Goldfarb by the simple fact that we are not dealing with an agency of the state but 
the state itself. Accordingly, Goldfarb does not apply here except to the extent that it further supports the determination that 
when the state itself is conducting the activity, there is no violation of the antitrust laws. LaFayette is equally inappropriate. The Court concluded in LaFayette that municipalities should not be excluded from the reach 
of the antitrust laws. The Court found that Parker v. Brown's exemption from the antitrust laws was limited to official action 
directed by the state.  435 U.S. at 412, 98 S. Ct. 1123. The Court supported its ruling by stating that ""States' subdivisions 
generally have not been treated as equivalents of the States themselves."" Id. (Footnote omitted). Once again, we are not 
involved with any subdivisions of the OPEC nations, but the nations themselves. Accordingly, LaFayette does not apply to our 
suit here. "
1227,18," Giving a foreign sovereign the Option to sue, merely allows the nation to use our judicial system if it wishes. Allowing foreign 
sovereigns to be sued, however, would Require their presence in our courts. Thus the latter poses the greater threat to sensitive 
matters of foreign policy."
1227,19," This determination is consistent with the Court's rulings concerning domestic States under the antitrust laws. States may sue, 
Georgia v. Evans, 316 U.S. 159, 62 S. Ct. 972, 86 L. Ed. 1346 (1942), but not be sued, Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 63 S. Ct.

1246,12," Products that are similar to each other, that are substitutes for each other, display positive cross-elasticity. That is, if the price 
of A remains constant, an increase in the price of B will generate more sales of A as buyers switch to it.  High cross-elasticity 
means that if the price of A remains constant, an X % Increase in the price of B will generate a greater than X % Increase in the 
sales of A.  See United States v. DuPont & Co., 351 U.S. 377, 400, 76 S. Ct. 994, 100 L. Ed. 1264 (1956)."
1246,13," This is not always the case.  As Professors Areeda and Turner explained: Notwithstanding high cross-elasticity between two products at given prices, the producer . . .  of one product has market power if 
he has a significant cost advantage that would persist as he expanded output.  (But) since producers with such an advantage 
will be motivated to cut price and expand their sales, the case will often be taken into account, at least partially, by adjusting 
market shares to reflect clear trends. II P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law at 371 n. 1 (1978); See also Sullivan at 56."

although in Brown Shoe and DuPont relatively expansive markets were found to be appropriate, subsequent Supreme Court

1248,16," Beginning in May 1968, Fotomat's franchise agreements contained a buy-back option by which Fotomat was entitled to 
repurchase the franchise after three years at a price equal to the greater of $ 50,000 or 5 times the total net profit for the 12 
month period preceding exercise of the option."
1248,17," Although this factual discussion is taken primarily from the district court's opinion, we have found that the record supports it. "
1249,18," In October 1968, after Photovest purchased the fifteen franchises in Marion County, Fotomat placed an advertisement in the 
Wall Street Journal soliciting the purchase of franchises in certain midwestern cities.  The ad stated that Fotomat was ""one of the 
fastest growing franchise systems in the nation"" and that ""only a few key franchise areas are still available."" The ad prominently 
displayed the names of various midwestern cities, including Indianapolis, with a line drawn through the name and the notation 
""sold out."" "
1250,19," Photovest's break-even point is $ 55,000 exclusive of general overhead and $ 65,000 after all expenses.  The incremental 
break-even point (i. e. the point at which sales exceed the direct costs of the particular store and begin to contribute to general 
overhead) is $ 50,000 for a franchised store.  Because a franchised store must pay royalties, advertising fees and rents, which 
company stores do not pay, the break-even point of a company store is significantly lower.  For example the incremental break-
even point for a company store is $ 21,000 to $ 25,000."
1250,20," Fotomat argues that the district court's finding that Photovest's franchises were worthless is inconsistent with its finding that 
sales dropped ""a mere 15%"" from 1975 to 1977.  These findings are not inconsistent since Photovest had relatively high fixed 
costs and relatively slim profit margins per store.  Thus a 15% Drop in sales could mark the difference between a profitable 
enterprise and a bankrupt enterprise.  This is also supported by the fact that franchisees would buy blocks of franchises so that a 
minor drop in the sales at one or two stores could be temporarily absorbed by the other stores in the block. "
1251,21," Fotomat seems to suggest that if it respected the market areas and did not open overlapping stores, it might be subject to 
antitrust prohibitions against territorial allocations.  But in Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 57 n.26, 97 S. 
Ct. 2549, 2561 n.26, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568 (1977), the Court, in rejecting the inherent illegality of territorial allocations, stated: We also note that Per se rules in this area may work to the ultimate detriment of the small businessmen who operate as 
franchisees. To the extent that a Per se rule prevents a firm from using the franchise system to achieve efficiencies that it 
perceives as important to its successful operation, the rule creates an incentive for vertical integration into the distribution 
system, thereby eliminating to that extent the role of independent businessmen."
1251,22," See Ohio-Sealy Mattress Mfg. Co. v. Sealy, Inc., 585 F.2d 821, 831-32 & n.14 (7th Cir. 1978), Cert. denied, 440 U.S. 930, 99 
S. Ct. 1267, 59 L. Ed. 2d 486. "
1252,23," Other indications of Fotomat's purpose in adding numerous stores in Indianapolis include the fact that Fotomat was well 
aware that ""the more profitable the franchise is, the more expensive and difficult it is to reacquire it,"" and that the franchise 
relations director was hired ""to work himself out of a job."""
1252,24," The yearly cost of pickup and delivery in Indianapolis was about $ 23,000 during 1974, approximately 50% Of Photovest's 
annual profit in 1974.  The cost of customer service was $ 7,000 per year. "
1253,25," The district court found that one of the contributing factors to Fotomat's attempt to monopolize was its refusal to settle this 
litigation.  It stated: ""In sum, this litigation itself has been utilized by defendant as an instrument to drain plaintiff for purposes of 
ultimately buying plaintiff out at an inadequate price."" We are of the opinion that the district court erred in considering this as a factor.  See our discussion of this issue in section V.A., 
Infra.  Consequently, on remand the district court must reconsider the damage award for the ยง 2 violation.  The award must be 
reduced by $ 72,267 (the $ 24,089 litigation expenses trebled.)."
1253,26," Fotomat and Photovest together had 30 of the 39 drive-thru outlets at the conclusion of the trial.  Fotomat's regional director 
estimated Fotomat's and Photovest's aggregate share of sales in 1975 at 95% Of the Indianapolis drive-thru market."
1253,27," Ind. Code ยง 24-1-2-1 is patterned after ยง 1 of the Sherman Act and Indiana courts have looked to decisional law under ยง 1 to 
interpret ยง 24-1-2-1.  See Orion's Belt, Inc. v. Kayser-Roth Corp., 433 F. Supp. 301, 302-03 (S.D.Ind.1977); Citizens National 
Bank of Grant County v. First National Bank in Marion, 165 Ind. App. 116, 331 N.E.2d 471, 478 n.5 (1975). "
1254,28," The other four Photovest franchises were subject to clauses which prohibited Photovest from purchasing its processing from 
anyone else without written approval of Fotomat. "
1256,29," Photovest contends that Fotomat's conduct in response to Photovest's desire to switch processors was a consistent policy 
that Fotomat had developed since June 1971.  However, Photovest was unaware of this alleged policy until period three.  Thus 
this policy cannot be used to extend the tying violation into period two. Even if there were sufficient evidence that during period two Fotomat would have responded to Photovest's attempt to change 
processors in the same manner as Fotomat responded after September 1974, we would not extend the tying violation to include 
period two because Photovest could not have proved that it was coerced to stay with Carhart because of its desire to receive the 
tying product (the pickup and delivery services, etc.) since it was totally unaware that the tying product was conditioned on 
staying with Carhart. "
1257,30," The Supreme Court has explained that for purposes of tying arrangements, ""appreciable restraint results whenever the seller 
can exert some power over some of the buyers in the market, even if his power is not complete over them . . . ."" Fortner 
Enterprises, Inc. v. United States Steel Corp., 394 U.S. 495, 503-04, 89 S. Ct. 1252, 1258, 22 L. Ed. 2d 495 (1969)."
1257,31," The district court also held this same conduct violative of Ind. Code ยง 24-1-2-1.  It further held that Fotomat violated ยง 24-1-2-
1 since June 1971, before Labs was on the scene, by engaging in an unlawful scheme and design having the same purpose.  
The district court apparently was of the opinion that two actors, as required by ยง 1 of the Sherman Act, were not necessary 
under ยง 24-1-2-1.  Subsequent to the district court's opinion in this case, the Chief Judge of that district issued an opinion, with 
which we agree, that states that the Indiana statute does not extend beyond the bounds of federal antitrust law.  Orion's Belt, 
Inc. v. Kayser-Roth Corp., 433 F. Supp. 301, 302-03 (S.D.Ind.1977). Accordingly, the district court in the present case erred in 
finding a violation of ยง 24-1-2-1 before March 1972. "
1259,32," Commentators have not called for the expansion of the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine.  One respected commentator has 
referred to the doctrine as ""one of the weirdest concepts ever to rear its head in antitrust jurisprudence."" Handler, Some 
Misadventures in Antitrust Policymaking Nineteenth Annual Review, 76 Yale L.J. 92, 119 (1966)."
1259,33," Since we have decided that Fotomat and Labs were not two economic entities for ยง 1 purposes, we need not reach the issue 
of whether their conduct was sufficient to establish an agreement or conspiracy. However, we note that the evidence in this 
regard is very thin. "
1260,34," For the same reasons, we reverse the litigation expenses damage component awarded under other counts."
1260,35," Although this statement might be interpreted to mean that the tort liability arose from the numerosity of breaches rather than 
from the substance of the breaches, it is clear from the context and from the allegations in the count which the court was 
addressing that the number of breaches alone was not the basis for the tort liability. "
1261,36," Although the court and the parties agreed that California law applied for contract breach purposes, the court apparently 
applied Indiana law regarding tortious breach of contract because the tort occurred in Indiana.  The parties have not contested 
this."
1261,37," Although the district court held that punitive damages were appropriate, it concluded that: ""Because the court holds that 
defendant has violated Indiana Code 24-1-2-1 and 24-1-2-2, which are Indiana criminal statutes, plaintiff may not under Indiana 
law recover the punitive damages to which it would otherwise be entitled for activity by defendant which violates those criminal 
statutes."" Because the conduct which supported the punitive damages was in essence the same conduct which contributed to the antitrust 
treble damage liability, it would be inappropriate under Indiana law to award punitive damages in addition to the punitive aspects 
of the treble damage award.  See Taber v. Hutson, 5 Ind. 322, 325 (1854); Glissman v. Rutt, 175 Ind. App. 493, 372 N.E.2d 
1188, 1190 (1978)."
1261,38," The district court stated that Fotomat's tortious breaches of contract constituted a basis for actual damages of $ 894,046.76 
and for an equal amount of punitive damages."
1261,39," To eliminate any confusion, our holding does not disturb the district court's award of compensatory damages for normal, as 
distinct from tortious, breaches of contract regarding film markups, processing discounts, etc. "
1262,40," We do not suggest that a plaintiff with knowledge of the fraud may nevertheless claim justifiable reliance just because it does 
not know the exact dollar amount involved or every intricate detail of the fraud.  But that is not the case here. "
1263,41," Pursuant to Circuit Rule 16(e), that part of the foregoing opinion captioned ""I. EXCHANGE OF BRIEFS PROCEDURE"" has 
been circulated among all judges of this court in regular active service.  No judge favored a rehearing En banc on the question 
presented by the direction that any district court of this circuit now following the practice of delayed exchange of trial briefs 
should require in all future cases each party to serve his trial brief on all other parties at some reasonably short time before or 
after he files the brief with the court or provides a copy to the judge. "
1270,1," .  The activities of the AAFES find their genesis in an exercise of enumerated federal powers under the Constitution; namely, the 
war and military powers of Art. I, ยง 7, clauses 11-14, together with the Necessary and Proper Clause. With regard to the District 
of Columbia, however, Congress is not limited to enumerated powers. It has, instead, the general police powers of a state 
government. U.S. Const. art. I, ยง 7, cl. 17; National Mutual Insurance Co. v. Tidewater Transfer Co., Inc., 337 U.S. 582, 69 S. Ct. 
1173, 93 L. Ed. 1556 (1949). "
1272,2," .  It seems apparent from the statutory language that a buyer cannot be guilty of inducing if the seller cannot be guilty of 
discriminating, and the Supreme Court has so held. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., Inc. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 440 U.S. 
69, 99 S. Ct. 925, 59 L. Ed. 2d 153 (1979). A&P, However, says nothing about the reverse case which is the situation here."
1272,3," .  The doctrine that the sovereign retains immunity from suit unless expressly waived and the rule of construction that restrictive 
statutes do not apply to the sovereign unless expressly named obviously overlap to a great extent. The distinctions emerge 
where, as here, the action somehow depends on the legal rights of the United States, and the amenability of the sovereign to 
suit is not at issue. "
1273,," For example, in the United Mine Workers case, the validity of a federal court injunction against a labor strike depended on 
whether the Norris-LaGuardia Act covered the labor dispute. If it did, the anti-injunction provisions of that Act would have 
deprived the court of jurisdiction to issue the injunction. The strike occurred while the federal government had taken over 
operation of the mines pursuant to a Presidential declaration of national emergency. The Supreme Court recognized that the 
Norris-LaGuardia Act, with its anti-injunction provision, would apply if the operation of the mines had remained in private hands. 
But because the Act covered only ""employees"" and ""employers"" generally, the Court held that the government was not an 
""employer"" for purposes of the Act, and the Act did not apply. The United States Supreme Court has applied the presumption in other cases to allow the United States to pursue a common-
law collection remedy prohibited by statute to other creditors, Dollar Savings Bank v. United States, 86 U.S. (19 Wall.) 227, 238-
39, 22 L. Ed. 80 (1869); to allow the United States to collect a debt that would have been discharged in bankruptcy had it been 
owed to a private party, United States v. Herron, 87 U.S. (20 Wall.) 251, 263, 22 L. Ed. 275 (1873); to allow the United States to 
collect a partnership debt against a bankrupt out of the bankrupt's individual estate, even though the United States had not 
proved its claim in bankruptcy and even though private creditors would have been limited to the partnership estate, Lewis v. 
United States, 92 U.S. 618, 622, 23 L. Ed. 513 (1875); and to allow the United States to bring a criminal indictment under a 
statute prohibiting the importation of alien labor, when the statute spoke of enforcement only by forfeiture and penalty, United 
States v. Stevenson, 215 U.S. 190, 197, 30 S. Ct. 35, 54 L. Ed. 153 (1909). "
1274,4," .  The Act has been applied to terminate vigorous competitive activity, even when that activity was succeeding in breaking the 
probable monopolistic market share of an ""injured"" plaintiff.  Utah Pie Co. v. Continental Baking Co., 386 U.S. 685, 87 S. Ct. 
1326, 18 L. Ed. 2d 406 (1967). "
1278,1," This complex antitrust case was initiated in 1971 but pretrial motions and skirmishes delayed in-depth discovery until about 
1977.  As a result of that discovery, plaintiffs advised that their theory of the case was radically altered.  So different was the 
plaintiffs' present theory from that articulated in the original complaint that the court ordered the plaintiffs to file with it and 
defense counsel a ""Statement of Contentions."" That statement is dated August 29, 1977.  After its receipt the court ordered the 
plaintiffs to propose an amended complaint.  That document is dated July 9, 1979.  By letter of July 18, 1979 defense counsel 
objected to certain portions of the amended complaint as inadmissible under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  The court 
invited plaintiffs to respond to the defendants' letter, which the plaintiffs did by a voluminous response dated July 31, 1979.  
Defense counsel answered the response by detailed letter of August 6, 1979. In a separate ruling of this date, we have sustained the defendants' objections to (1) inclusion in the amended complaint of 
material expanding the scope of conspiracy to include co-conspirators not named as defendants and (2) inclusion of material 
relating to alleged fraudulent concealment of the conspiracy. Moreover, we have specified that allegations increasing damages 
from $ 18,000,000. to $ 61,000,000. must be particularized.  The information contained in this note is given as background.  Our 
ruling dismissing the complaint would not be different if the proposed amended complaint were accepted as tendered."

1280,3," In P 44 of the Amended Complaint, Reading alleges: ""44. The aforesaid combinations and conspiracies in violation of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act had the following effects 
among others: ""a. Created a gap between the U.S. producers' price and the price of copper traded on open markets in which the U.S. 
producers' price was for the period 1964-70 significantly lower than the price of copper prevailing on the open markets during the 
same period; ""b. Caused dislocations in the normal supply and demand relationships in the copper market and corresponding hardships for 
domestic fabricators, including Reading, and resulted in distortions in the domestic copper market; ""c. Resulted in an artificially low U.S. producers' price which in turn caused the price for copper prevailing on open markets, 
including the dealer market for scrap, to reach artificially high premium levels.  This would not have occurred but for the 
artificially maintained, low U.S. producers' price; ""d. Created an artificial demand for, and shortage of, U.S. producers' price copper and forced domestic fabricators, such as 
Reading, to purchase their requirements of copper at the artificially high open market prices; ""e. Created a substantial disparity in the raw material costs of copper for domestic fabricators by allocating lower U.S. producers' 
price copper to preferred and selected customers of the Defendants while forcing the remainder of the domestic fabricators, 
such as Reading, to purchase their copper requirements at the artificially higher open market prices; and ""f. Had the direct effect of limiting competition by smaller U.S. mine producers by restricting the amount of copper that would 
have been available but for the artificially low U.S. producers' price."""

U.S.C.A. ยงยง 1, 2.  Upon defendants prevailing on the federal antitrust claims, the District Court dismissed plaintiff's remaining 
state law claims.  Here, plaintiff has abandoned the Section two claim.  Any horizontal implications of the distribution 
arrangement under Section 1 of the Sherman Act were not part of Aladdin Oil's theory of the case and will not be considered 
here.  The theory of the complaint and the Summary Judgment proceeding was strictly vertical.  But see Cernuto, Inc. v. United

1301,17," .  This distinction was made in Barber, Refusals to Deal Under the Federal Antitrust Laws, 103 U.Pa.L.Rev. 847 (1955): When the element of purpose to coerce the trade policy of third parties or to secure their removal from competition is absent, the 
policy question raised by agreements under which the parties mutually limit their own freedom to deal with outsiders becomes 
more difficult, and the courts have appropriately outlined wider limits before declaring such agreements illegal. There are many ""normal and usual agreements in aid of trade and commerce,' * * * which involve the acceptance by the parties 
of limitations on their freedom individually to deal with others * * * .  Requirements contracts, exclusive dealing contracts and 
contracts involving exclusive territories all involve limitations on the freedom of one or more of the parties to do business with 
others * * * . Because all of these situations involve an agreement between two or more persons under which one or more of them agree not 
to deal with third persons and for that reason foreclose a part of the market to such third persons, they are all subject to scrutiny 
under the antitrust laws. But in the ordinary case these do not involve combining for the primary purpose of coercing or 
excluding; rather they involve combinations of two or more persons to further directly the business of the parties to the 
agreement, and the effect on third parties and on competition is indirect.  The issue in these cases is not the existence or 
nonexistence of concerted refusal to deal, but rather whether the purpose and effect of the operation of the contract, association, 
exchange or joint sales agency was such as unreasonably to exclude outsiders from participation in the trade in question.  The "
1302,," principle of the group boycott cases that it is prima facie unreasonable for a dominant group to combine to coerce is not here 
applicable. Id. at 876-77, Quoted in Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc. v. Hawaiian Oke & Liquors, Ltd., 416 F.2d 71, 77 (9th Cir. 1969), Cert.

from one person to another as money.  This is not only intended, but it is widely advertised that travelers checks are readily 
accepted in commerce as money and that they are safer.  The public is made to believe that travelers checks are a substitute for 
money, a medium of exchange, which are self-identifying and accepted everywhere, but, unlike currency, they can be carried 
without danger of loss or theft because of the protective device of signature and countersignature. We believe that if travelers checks are intended by the issuer and accepted by the public as a medium of exchange to take the 
place of money, they should be subjected to the same rules of law applicable to money under like circumstances. We therefore hold that travelers checks upon being printed become a medium of exchange or acquire negotiable characteristics 
and all the risk of theft is with the issuer. The issuer is thus liable to any bona fide holder of stolen travelers checks who has paid 
valuable consideration."

distinction between extortion and exaction, then, is a fine one. Extortion involves a case in which the person illegally obtains 
more than is due, when something is initially due him; exaction involves obtaining something of value when there was nothing 
due him in the first instance. Id. In the present case, it is arguable under the alleged facts that both, or either, extortion and

1360,1," Defendant has submitted various exhibits and affidavits with its brief in support of its motion to dismiss. Were we to consider 
these materials in ruling the present motion, we would be required to treat the motion as one for summary judgment under Rule 
56, Fed. R. Civ. P. See Jennings v. Davis, 476 F. 2d 1271, 1273-4 (8th Cir. 1973); Rule 12(b), Fed. R. Civ. P. The Court 
believes, however, that defendant's motion can be granted on the pleadings in this case, and thus, the motion will be treated as 
one for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), Fed. R. Civ. P."
1360,2," Plaintiff's tradename is ""Red Dog""; defendant Triangle allegedly is using the tradename ""Black Tom"".  While any deceptive 
similarity between these two tradenames escapes the Court's scrutiny on the record before us, we will accept this allegation as a 
proven fact, as we must in reviewing a motion to dismiss. See Profesional Beauty Supply v. National Beauty Supply, Inc. [1979-1 
TRADE CASES P62,485], 594 F. 2d 1179, 1181 (8th Cir. 1979). "
1361,3," While plaintiff's conspiracy allegations suffer from some ambiguity and might be construed as setting forth contentions that the 
three individual defendants engaged in a conspiracy, and that the corporate defendant Triangle also engaged in that conspiracy, 
in its suggestions, plaintiff disclaims any intention to state the latter contention.  Indeed, in identifying the participants in the 
alleged conspiracy in paragraph 14 of its complaint, plaintiff avers that ""Defendant Hodges, Defendant Fitts and Defendant 
Caton conspired and agreed"", but makes no mention of Triangle as a conspirator. We agree with the defendants however, that 
absent an allegation that they -- the individual defendants, officers and employees of Triangle -- were acting beyond the scope of 
any corporate authorization when allegedly engaging in anticompetitive acts, Triangle could not legally and conceptually have 
been a co-conspirator to the alleged conspiracy of the individual defendants.  See Morton Bldgs. of Nebraska, Inc. v. Morton 
Bldgs., Inc., 531 F. 2d 910, 917 (8th Cir. 1976). (""Since more than one entity or person is required to establish a conspiracy, the "
1362,," general rule is that a conspiracy cannot be based on an agreement between a corporation and its officers, agents, or 
employees.  The only exception arises when the officers or agents, were, at the time of the conspiracy, acting beyond the scope 
of their authority or for their own benefit."") Accordingly, the Court treats plaintiff's complaint as alleging a conspiracy among only 
the individual defendants. "

The rule requires a court to weigh competing factors to determine whether a particular ""restraint, on balance, substantially 
impedes competition, rather than encouraging or regulating it in neutral ways."" Id. ยง 68, at 188-89. "
1364,5," While defendants do not question the sufficiency of plaintiff's pleadings of specific intent, the Court believes that this element 
has, at best, been only indirectly pleaded.  In the only paragraphs of its complaint in which plaintiff makes allegations concerning 
defendants' intent, paragraphs 14, 16, 18 and 19, its sole repeated claim is that defendants acted with ""the intent to injure and 
destroy the plaintiff in its business and property."" HN12[
] ""Specific intent to monopolize must be well pleadedโฆ."" Hiland Dairy, Inc. v. Kroger Co., 402 F. 2d 968, 971 (8th Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 395 U.S. 961, 89 S. Ct. 2096, 23 L. Ed. 2d 748 (1969) 
(emphasis added.) Not only does plaintiff fail to even make pro forma allegations of intent or purpose to monopolize, but, more "
1365,," significantly, it does not allege ""conduct or acts"" from which intent to monopolize the relevant market (presumably the plumbing 
specialties distribution market in the geographical market of the entire United States) might be inferred.  See id. at 975. 
HN13[
] ""Specific intent to monopolize or to obtain monopoly power may be defined for purposes of ยง 2 of the Sherman Act as an intent to control prices or to restrict competition unreasonably."" United States v. Empire Gas Corp., supra, 537 F. 2d at 302. 
In the earlier discussion of the ยง 1 claim, the Court concluded that plaintiff failed to aver any facts demonstrating or even 
suggesting that the allegedly wrongful acts of defendants were causing anti-competitive effects in the relevant market. It would 
seem to follow, then, that the complaint lacks allegations of predatory acts or acts unreasonably restraining trade, such as would 
establish specific intent to monopolize. See Hiland Dairy, Inc. v. Kroger Co., supra, 402 F. 2d at 975. Since the Court believes 
that the issue of dangerous probability is dispositive of dismissal of the present ยง 2 claim, we find it unnecessary to rule as a 
matter of law that plaintiff's allegations do not allege a specific intent to monopolize. Plaintiff is cautioned, however, that an 
amended complaint will not withstand a motion to dismiss unless it clearly sets forth allegations of conduct which is exclusionary 
and anti-competitive in nature.  Union Lender Corp. v. Newspapers of New England, Inc., 180 F. Supp. 125, 140-41 (D. Mass. 
1959), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 284 F. 2d 582 (1st Cir. 1960), cert. denied, 365 U.S. 833, 81 S. Ct. 747, 5 L. Ed. 2d 744 
(1961)."
1365,6," Although the Court has construed plaintiff's allegations in paragraph 8 of its complaint to satisfy the requirement that the 
relevant market be identified, we believe plaintiff should supply more clarity and specificity in setting forth the area of trade which 
it contends is adversely affected by defendants' actions.  ""Without a definition of that market there is no way to measureโฆ [the 
defendants'] ability to lessen or destroy competition."" Walker Process Equip., Inc. v. Food Mach. & Chem. Corp., 382 U.S. 172, 
177, 86 S. Ct. 347, 15 L. Ed. 2d 247, 251 (1965). In redrafting this portion of its complaint, plaintiff is directed to the Eighth 
Circuit's discussion of the issue of relevant market in United States v. Empire Gas Corp., supra, 537 F. 2d at 302-5."
1365,7," We are not stating that a firm's status as a new entrant ends the inquiry into its ability to monopolize or its possession of market 
power; but such a factor, in the absence of other information, mitigates against the likelihood that the new entrant possesses "
1366,," monopoly power or the ability to monopolize, espectially if it has not been transacting business as an established firm in another 
business market.  See generally P. Areeda, Antitrust Analysis P227-241 (2d Ed. 1974); L. Sullivan, supra, ยงยง 9-11."
1366,8," The Court has evaluated plaintiff's ยง 2 claim as an ""attempt to monopolize"" claim in accordance with the language of the 
pleading.  However, since plaintiff also alleged a ยง 1 conspiracy, the ยง 2 claim might be construed to plead a ""conspiracy to 
monopolize"".  HN17[
] The elements of this offense are somewhat different from those of an attempt to monopolize, namely: ""(1) the existence of a combination or conspiracy; ""(2) overt acts in furtherance of that combination or conspiracy; ""(3) a substantial amount of commerce affected; and ""(4) specific intent to monopolize."""
1366,2," J. Von Kalinowski, supra, ยง 9.02[1], at 9-29 to 9-30.  While the Court has found that plaintiff sets forth sufficient factual 
allegations to state the existence of a conspiracy, overt acts, and arguably specific intent to monopolize (see note 5 supra), our 
ruling on the ยง 1 claim indicated that plaintiff failed to make any allegation as to the effect of defendants' alleged actions on the 
relevant market. See Part III supra. Nowhere in the complaint does plaintiff allege facts that could, even when liberally 
construed, be said to plead an impact on a substantial amount of interstate commerce. Thus, even if we were to infer from 
plaintiff's complaint an intention to allege a conspiracy to monopolize, an essential element of that offense is not presented in the 
factual averments of the complaint. "

1374,4," As is indicated below, allowing credit for unsold magazines is critical to the industry. Since periodicals go out of date quickly, 
no retailer would accept more than a minimal number of periodicals for resale if he bore the risk of loss. Accordingly, it is industry 
practice for regional wholesalers to accept unsold periodicals for credit from retailers so long as returns are made within a 
certain time period. Similarly, the national distributors accept unsold magazines for credit from the regional wholesalers. It is not 
clear from the record whether the ultimate loss for unsold magazines is borne by the national distributors or by the publishing 
companies themselves. Of course, to the extent that the national distributors are owned by the publishing companies, the 
question is academic. "

1375,9," Still, as in most such relationships, there is some indication that plaintiff was regarded as an employee of Bluff City. The 
plaintiff qualified for and received prizes and bonuses awarded from time-to-time by Bluff City to its regular route men. Similarly 
he also received Christmas certificates and participated in Bluff City's group insurance plans. Bluff City insured plaintiff's 
inventory and provided free warehouse space where he picked up the magazines. The plaintiff appeared on Bluff City's roster of 
employees. On balance, however, it is clear that both Byars and Bluff City recognized that Byars was different from a regular 
employee and that he had considerable discretion in the servicing of his own accounts which Bluff City's regular employees did 
not. "

1378,16," In a famous dictum, Judge Hand stated that it was doubtful whether 60 or 64% of the market would be enough to constitute a

1378,17," This is the reason why relevant market is so critical in antitrust cases. How one defines the relevant market determines 
market share and market share all but determines whether one is a monopolist. See e. g.  United States v. DuPont & Co., 351 
U.S. 377, 76 S. Ct. 994, 100 L. Ed. 1264 (1956) (Majority's broad definition of relevant market resulted in a finding that DuPont

These commentators have noted that HN8[
] two factors in particular could offset the inference of monopoly power which goes 
with possession of a high market share: 1) entry barriers and 2) temporal considerations. If entry barriers are low, the threat of 
potential competition operates as a significant check on monopoly power since competitors will quickly enter the market if prices 
are raised significantly. Similarly, possession of monopoly power may only indicate short-term success from innovation which will 
quickly dissipate as competitors catch up. A careful examination of the publishing industry might reveal other factors which could 
raise doubts whether the defendant possesses monopoly power. One factor which deserves assessment is the conduct of the national distributors. It is clear that to the extent that Bluff City does 
have a monopoly in the relevant market, that monopoly exists at the pleasure of the national distributors. It may be that the 
national distributors carefully police the conduct of the regional distributor and are quick to withdraw an exclusive franchise at the 
first sign of consumer dissatisfaction. On the other hand, the national distributors may not care about the regional distributors' 
conduct so long as they make their profit. "
1379,20," See Pac. Coast Agr. Export Ass'n v. Sunkist Growers, Inc., 526 F.2d 1196 (9th Cir. 1975), Cert. denied, 425 U.S. 959, 96 S. 
Ct. 1741, 48 L. Ed. 2d 204 (1976) (defendant's share of the relevant distribution market ranged from 45-70%, but competitors 
were small and defendant had monopoly power over supply market); United States v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 110 F. 
Supp. 295, 343 (D.Mass.1953), Aff'd per curiam, 347 U.S. 521, 74 S. Ct. 699, 98 L. Ed. 910 (1954), (court gave ""some weight"" to 
75 plus percent market share, but performed careful analysis of the shoe machinery industry to reach its conclusion that 
defendant possessed monopoly power). Cf.  United States v. General Dynamics Corp., 415 U.S. 486, 94 S. Ct. 1186, 39 L. Ed. 
2d 530 (1974) (Court did not discuss market share, but concluded from its analysis of the industry that no substantial lessening 
of competition would result from a merger challenged under ยง 7 of the Clayton Act)."
1379,21," At the time of trial, the defendant served 554 customers, the plaintiff served 59. Three other retail outlets received publications 
from other sources. Our examination of confidential dollar sales volume figures submitted under seal shows that between 1973 
and 1975, Bluff City had from 94% To 96% Of the relevant market measured in sales volume."
1379,22," This case does not present any issues involving a violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act because of a joint refusal to deal, 
sometimes referred to as a group boycott. See e. g.  Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., 359 U.S. 207, 79 S. Ct. 705, 3 L. 
Ed. 2d 741 (1959); William Goldman Theatres v. Loew's, Inc., 150 F.2d 738 (3d Cir. 1945), Cert. denied, 334 U.S. 811, 68 S. Ct. 
1016, 92 L. Ed. 1742 (1948). It is true that none of the primary line national periodical distributors would deal with plaintiff, 
despite his requests that they do so. Testimony in the record reveals that each distributor made an independent decision not to 
sell to plaintiff, and that no conspiracy or joint refusal to sell took place."
1379,23," Although we accept this finding, we note that it may not be true under all circumstances. If two distributors both supply the 
same magazines to a retail store, then there will be an increase in unsold magazines and confusion as to which distributor's 
magazines were sold. If two distributors compete among themselves as to which retail stores to service, these adverse effects 
do not necessarily follow so long as only one distributor ends up supplying each store."
1379,24," The decision made by the national distributors is similar to that made by national film companies to only allow distributors with 
a full line of products to market posters and other movie display accessories. The Third Circuit upheld this decision because it 
was independently made for valid business reasons. See Lawlor v. National Screen Service Co., 270 F.2d 146 (3d Cir. 1959), 
Cert. denied, 362 U.S. 922, 80 S. Ct. 676, 4 L. Ed. 2d 742 (1960). In another analogous case, the Second Circuit upheld the right of publishing companies to cease doing business with a regional 
distributor with whom they were dissatisfied and to replace it with a system of 13 smaller regional distributors. Each company 
acted independently and for a valid business reason. See Interborough News Co. v. The Curtis Publishing Co., 225 F.2d 289 (2d 
Cir. 1955) Aff'ing 127 F. Supp. 286 (S.D.N.Y.1954). "
1380,25," In its brief and in a post-argument supplemental letter, Bluff City argued that there were other wholesalers active in the area. 
However, there is no finding below to this effect and other wholesalers appear to serve only 3 stores in the stipulated geographic 
market. The existence of potential competition of course, can check the exercise of monopoly power. See n. 19, Supra. The 
parties are free to argue this issue on remand."
1380,26," Important to this determination will be an analysis of plaintiff's allegations of adverse effect upon the small retailers. There is 
evidence in the record, not addressed by the district court, that when Bluff City took over servicing Byars' former small retail 
customers, the result was inferior service at greater cost which the small retailers were forced to bear since they had nowhere 
else to turn for primary-line periodicals. Byars' customers mostly operated neighborhood convenience stores. When Bluff City cut off Byars and took over his accounts, it 
imposed a service charge on them which Byars had not. In addition, Bluff City provided some of the stores only with drop 
shipment service, i. e., magazine bundles were simply dropped off. Byars always provided full service, i. e., he always placed the 
new magazines on the store racks. A number of the small store operators testified that Bluff City's services were very poor 
compared with Byars'. Specifically, Bluff City was slow in giving credit for returns and was sometimes overly rigid in demanding 
that retailers carry large numbers of unwanted titles. It appears that the retailers preferred Byars' eager-to-please personalized 
service to Bluff City's ""assembly-line"" approach. This evidence, if credited, lends strong support to plaintiff's contention that Bluff 
City possesses monopoly power."
1380,27," The classic case is that of a ""natural"" monopoly such as that possessed by a utility company in a city. For example, in Otter 
Tail Power Co. v. United States, 410 U.S. 366, 369, 93 S. Ct. 1022, 35 L. Ed. 2d 359 (1973), the Court noted that ""(e)ach town in "
1381,," Otter Tail's service area generally can accommodate only one distribution system, making each town a natural monopoly market 
for the distribution and sale of electric power at retail."" Other examples of a ""natural"" monopoly are the single newspaper in a small-town, See Times-Picayune Publishing Company v. 
United States, 345 U.S. 594, 602-603, 73 S. Ct. 872, 97 L. Ed. 1277 (1953); Union Leader Corp. v. Newspapers of New 
England, Inc., 284 F.2d 582 (1st Cir. 1960), Cert. denied, 365 U.S. 833, 81 S. Ct. 747, 5 L. Ed. 2d 744 (1961); United States v.

1381,28," Indeed, there is absolutely no dispute that this occurred."
1381,29," To be sure, there is some evidence in the record which indicated that some stores were offered the choice of being served by 
Byars or by Bluff City. On the whole, however, Byars and Bluff City served distinct customer groups."
1381,30," There was some testimony in the record which, if credited, could result in a finding of predatory conduct by Bluff City. These 
alleged activities included: 1) removal of plaintiff's periodicals from sales racks at various retail outlets; 2) covering up of 
plaintiff's periodicals on the racks to put them out of the view of prospective buyers; 3) below cost pricing of those few periodicals 
being distributed by the plaintiff; 4) disparagement of the plaintiff, his financial condition, and the periodicals he was able to 
obtain; 5) surreptitious addition of its own periodicals identical to those placed on racks by plaintiff in order to increase plaintiff's 
return and diminish plaintiff's profits; 6) intimidation of plaintiff's customers to purchase periodicals solely from defendant; 7) 
threats to the regional representative of an independent news company with reprisals if he assisted plaintiff in the direct 
purchase of periodicals from independents. See generally Photovest Corp v. Fotomat Corp., 606 F.2d 704 (7th Cir. 1979); 3

integrated facility. We are not so sure. There may indeed be significant considerations of fairness and efficiency where a single 
innovative firm builds or obtains a unique facility. However, many such situations arise purely by chance or accident. We 
question the wisdom of permitting exclusionary behavior by the accidental owner of a unique facility while prohibiting such 
conduct if the facility is owned by two or more competitors at least so long as the judicial price regulation problem we discuss 
below can be overcome."

1385,38," Griffith contains a famous dictum which also provides a rationale for halting abuse of monopoly power: ""the use of monopoly 
power, however lawfully acquired, to foreclose competition, to gain a competitive advantage, or to destroy a competitor, is 
unlawful."" 334 U.S. at 107, 68 S. Ct. at 945. Griffith makes it clear that an exclusionary, anti-competitive use of monopoly power 
is illegal. See Pac. Coast Agr. Export Ass'n v. Sunkist Growers, Inc., 526 F.2d 1196 (9th Cir. 1975), Cert. denied, 425 U.S. 959,

are distinguishable. Those cases upheld the right of a tunnel and terminal, respectively, to give out exclusive contracts for the 
operation of a business on their premises. Since the tunnel and terminal operators were not competitors of the excluded 
businesses, they had no reason to arbitrarily abuse their monopoly position. See TV Signal Co. of Aberdeen v. AT & T Co., 462 
F.2d 1256 (8th Cir. 1972). We must concede, however, that there exists tension between these cases and those cases adopting 
the ""bottleneck"" theory."
1385,40," This was because the national movie companies ""have traditionally insisted that licensees to manufacture its accessories

(N.D.Ga.1961), Aff'd, 305 F.2d 647 (5th Cir. 1962) (opinion granting preliminary injunction). Of course, Poster Exchange (or any

companies, but that would have required a ""multimillion dollar investment"".  Poster Exchange, Inc. v. National Screen Service 
Corp., 431 F.2d at 339. The court held that this was not a reasonable alternative. Id. "
1386,41," Assuming that the district court finds that Bluff City possessed monopoly power, that power extended over wholesale 
distribution of primary-line periodicals in the Memphis-Shelby County area. Within this market, there existed what can be viewed 
as a submarket consisting of small retail outlets served by the plaintiff. By refusing to deal with the plaintiff, Bluff City used its 
power to exclude Byars from the small-store submarket so that it could take over his business thus vertically integrating into the 
small-store market. For the relevant factors which are used in defining a submarket under ยง 2, See Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 
325, 82 S. Ct. 1502, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1962); Spectrofuge Corp. v. Beckman Instruments, Inc., 575 F.2d 256, 283-84 (5th Cir.

the small-store submarket composed of distinct customers served by Byars and arranged their business dealings accordingly."
1386,42," Further, that intent can readily be found if it is a natural and likely consequence of the monopolist's conduct. See United

1388,47," To illustrate, with an example taken from Areeda and Turner, Supra at P 725c. Assume raw copper ingot costs $ 40.00 and 
that the cost of making copper pipe is $ 35.00. A vertically integrated monopolist with control over both copper ingot and copper 
manufacturing would set the price of the copper pipe to the consumer at the optimum monopoly level say $ 100.00. Where there 
were two separate monopolists, the one with control over the ingot would set the price of the ingot to the second monopolist at $ 
65.00 so that the former could reap all of the monopoly profit. The second monopolist would now be facing costs of $ 100.00 $ 
65.00 for the ingot and $ 35.00 for manufacturing costs. It would set the ultimate price to the consumer at some level above $ 
100.00. Even if the first monopolist were to lower its price to the second monopolist, absent agreement, the ultimate price to the 
consumer would always be above $ 100.00."
1388,48, Areeda and Turner would find a vertical integration presumptively lawful and would outlaw it only in rare cases.

1389,54," As indicated in n. 4, Supra, credit for unsold publications is allowed to the retailer by the wholesaler and to the wholesaler by 
the national publishers. Ordinarily, dealers or wholesalers must return some proof that a magazine was indeed unsold such as a 
torn-off cover. Trusted wholesalers, however, are allowed to simply execute an affidavit certifying that a certain number of 
periodicals were unsold. "
1390,55," A common justification for anti-competitive behavior is self-preservation. That argument has not been made in this case, but it 
could be since imposing a broad duty to deal on Bluff City could result in its replacement by a competitor to which it was forced 
to sell periodicals at below-wholesale prices. This would be similar to Otter Tail's argument that if it were forced to sell and 
""wheel"" power to any municipality which requested it to do so, then it would be forced out of business. See the district court and 
the Supreme Court discussion of Otter Tail's need-to-survive defense.  410 U.S. 366 at 380-82, 93 S. Ct. 1022, 35 L. Ed. 2d 359

1390,57," Fear of judicial ""utility regulation"" permeates Areeda & Turner's analysis of monopolists' refusals to deal. We agree that 
federal judges do not make good regulators of business conduct. However, courts must be careful not to abdicate their 
responsibilities under the Antitrust laws in the name of expedience. When the adverse effect of allowing a monopolist to maintain 
certain practices is clear, a court should stay its hand rarely, if ever."
1390,58," There exists no theoretical distinction between ordering a monopolist to deal with a former customer and ordering the 
monopolist to deal with anyone who comes along. Yet, as a practical matter, it is far different to order the reestablishment of a 
ruptured relationship than to order a monopolist to deal with a stranger. The difficulty of setting reasonable terms, especially 
price, should be a substantial factor when confronted with the latter situation. An alternative analytical view would be that there 
exist valid business reasons why a monopolist should not have to deal with a stranger."
1390,59," Findings of fact on this issue would also dispose of Byar's separate claim of unfair competition based on the same alleged 
""dirty tricks."" "

1400,2," .  On January 26, 1973, a grand jury handed down criminal indictments charging Texas Industries and one of its employees, 
Radcliff Materials, Inc. and one of its employees, Jahncke Services, Inc. (later changed to OKC Dredging, Inc.) and one of its 
employees, and Jimco, Inc. with violations of 15 U.S.C. ยง 1. The indictments charged the existence of an unlawful combination 
and conspiracy in unreasonable restraint of interstate trade and, in particular, accused the defendants of entering into an 
agreement to raise and stabilize the price of ready-mix concrete in the New Orleans area. The criminal proceedings were 
ultimately concluded upon the entry of Nolo contendere pleas by each of the defendants."

issue of contribution, and Kraftco, which arguably implies a no-contribution rule, are in point. The decisions in American Motor "

to proceed against any one or combination of them."

1401,5," .  The case law has uniformly characterized a private antitrust suit as a tort action. See, e. g., Solomon v. Houston Corrugated 
Box Co., 526 F.2d 389, 392 n. 4 (5 Cir. 1976); Simpson v. Union Oil Co., 311 F.2d 764, 768 (9 Cir.), Rev'd on other grounds, 377

(W.D.N.Y.1977); Wolf Sales Co. v. Rudolph Wurlitzer Co., 105 F. Supp. 506 (Colo.1952). One commentator, however, has questioned the assumption that private antitrust actions sound in tort or that antitrust violators 
are necessarily ""tortfeasors."" Note, Contribution in Private Antitrust Suits, 63 Cornell L.Rev. 682, 692-97 (1978). As that writer 
notes, a large percentage of antitrust actions do not involve activity considered tortious under the common law. Since the no-
contribution rule has traditionally applied only to joint tortfeasors, the writer suggests that the courts should carefully examine the 
nature of the particular antitrust violation to see what common law form of action most closely resembles the plaintiff's statutory 
claim. Because he concludes that price-fixing arrangements more closely resemble quasi-contract than tort, he apparently would 
award contribution in this case. We cannot subscribe to this analysis. First, the focus of the antitrust laws is not so much on the defendant's unjust enrichment as 
on the injuries the plaintiff has suffered. In fact, the plaintiff's right to damages is totally independent of whether the defendant 
has profited at the plaintiff's expense. Thus, we cannot agree that price-fixing ""more closely resembles quasi-contract than tort."" 
Second, the anti-competitive activity which escaped liability at common law has, because of altered social and economic 
conditions, become unacceptable behavior in modern society. Indeed, conduct once non-tortious has become criminal under the 
antitrust statutes. It is difficult to believe that the law of torts, which has always been in constant flux, would not have eventually 
encompassed such conduct if legislation had not preempted the field. We believe that the same rationale justifying a no-
contribution rule among ""tortfeasors"" applies to intentional antitrust violators. See Corbett, Apportionment of Damages and 
Contribution Among Coconspirators in Antitrust Treble Damages Actions, 31 Fordham L.Rev. 111, 114 (1962). "

] At common law no right of contribution existed among intentional tortfeasors. Merryweather v. Nixan, 8 Durn. & East 
186, 101 Eng. Rep. 1337 (K.B.1799). This no-contribution rule was subsequently extended to cases involving unintentional 
conduct, See W. Prosser, Law of Torts ยง 50 at 305-06 (4th ed. 1971), and was adopted by the federal common law. Union Stock 
Yards Co. v. Chicago, B. & Q. R. R., 196 U.S. 217, 25 S. Ct. 226, 49 L. Ed. 453 (1905). This rule, however, had been modified in 
some cases, at least among unintentional tortfeasors, See, e. g., Kohr v. Allegheny Airlines, Inc., 504 F.2d 400 (7 Cir. 1974), 
Cert. denied, 421 U.S. 978, 44 L. Ed. 2d 470, 95 S. Ct. 1980 (1975), and the Eighth Circuit has rejected the rule in its entirety in 
the antitrust context. See Professional Beauty Supply, Inc. v. National Beauty Supply, Inc., 594 F.2d 1179 (8 Cir. 1979). The 
Professional Beauty Supply court relied upon Cooper Stevedoring Co. v. Fritz Kopke, Inc., 417 U.S. 106, 94 S. Ct. 2174, 40 L. 
Ed. 2d 694 (1974), as indicative of the erosion of the no-contribution rule. Even assuming that Cooper Stevedoring, an admiralty 
case, is apposite, it would not be dispositive of the present case since the implication of a cause of action under the federal 
common law is a discrete inquiry focused upon the circumstances of a particular case."
1402,8," .  Economists have argued that business managers, particularly in larger organizations, are generally ""risk averse"" that is, they 
are deterred more by the slight prospect of a large loss than by the strong prospect of a small loss. If this hypothesis is correct, 
application of the rule denying contribution should inhibit those managers who are aware of the rule from participating in unlawful 
group activity: Although the rule decreases the likelihood that an individual participant will be held liable, it increases the size of 
the potential liability. Note, Supra, 63 Cornell L.Rev. at 702. The author of the note suggests that the participant's unfamiliarity with the no-contribution 
rule may limit its deterrent effect. We are convinced, however, that, as a class, antitrust defendants are more likely to be familiar 
with the no-contribution rule than tortfeasors in general. Furthermore, the percentage of participants unaware of the rule will 
certainly decrease as the rule is applied. "
1403,9," .  We therefore hold that the doctrine of In pari delicto, with its complex scope, contents, and effects, is not to be recognized as a 
defense to an antitrust action."

also Kestenbaum v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., 514 F.2d 690 (5 Cir. 1975)."
1403,11," .  In a contribution action there is necessarily an antitrust defendant who is faced with potential liability to an injured plaintiff; 
deterrence does not suffer if contribution is denied since a real threat of liability exists for all participants in the illegal scheme 
any one of them could have been selected as the defendant in the plaintiff's action. On the other hand, a rule that bars suit by "
1404,," any plaintiff who participated in the wrong will, in many instances, mean that no defendant will face liability since there is no 
plaintiff willing to bring the action a result that clearly undermines the deterrence objectives of the antitrust laws."

1438,100," The only exception to this was the 2319A3. It should be emphasized that this Court does not accept the PET matrix as proof 
of capital costs, but even if it had, it would find the price of the 2319A3 reasonable, and not to have damaged Transamerica in 
any way. The 2319A3 was a specialized program, a disk drive with a power supply, and there is no evidence that Transamerica 
or any other competitor even considered supplying the very limited market this product addressed. "
1439,101," This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that IBM included estimates of cost contingencies, allowances for unexpected cost 
increases, in its announcement financial analyses that ranged from 5.2 percent of expected revenue (for the 2319B) to 7.8 
percent (for Aspen). This Court would be inclined to diminish defendant's costs by the amounts included as contingencies if the 
price-cost relationship were a closer question."

1444,109," It should be noted here that any finding this Court might make that the multiplexor degradation violated the Sherman Act 
would be accompanied by a finding that Transamerica suffered no injury as a result of that conduct. The market for the tapes 
excluded by this conduct was insignificant. Only tape drives with data rates between 30 and 50KB were affected. Those were 
older, low performance technology devices that would only have been competitive at prices far below those contemplated in 
Transamerica's damage claim. Transamerica probably owned some of them, but its President didn't know how many, and any 
Transamerica owned were purchased in the second Telex tape contract. Because that contract was not an arms-length 
transaction, this Court would be reluctant to award Transamerica any damages on the equipment purchased thereunder. Also, 
there is no evidence that Transamerica in the past supplied peripherals for the 115/125 migrator systems, or that it intended to, 
or took any steps to supply peripherals for the 115 and 125 systems. "

1476,2," Arnott also claimed that during the operation of the lease agreement Amoco misrepresented the benefits to be received by 
Arnott from the installation of a carwash."
1476,3," In instructing the jury the court stated: ""This is not disputed by the plaintiff (sic)."" No further reference is made to this $ 393.75 
item until Amoco in its reply brief complains that the court elected not to charge the jury on this issue and thus the judgment 
should be reversed.  Earlier in the trial proceedings Amoco's counsel indicated there was no dispute about this item.  Under the 
circumstances we pretermit any further discussion of the same."
1476,4," Prior thereto Arnott, after attending a two-week training school sponsored by Amoco, had operated Standard Oil stations at 
Lake Preston, Wessington Springs, and Huron, South Dakota, during the period 1960-67.  He discontinued his dealership in 
1967 to become a life insurance salesman.  In 1970, after again attending a dealer training school, he opened the Minneapolis 
station. "
1477,5," Since the Statement of Policy contained several representations which Arnott claims were false and fraudulent and made with 
intent to deceive, which were relied upon by Arnott in entering into the lease agreement with Amoco, and which form the basis 
for his claim for damages as a result thereof, pertinent portions are set out as follows: STATEMENT OF POLICY Since we first began leasing service stations to independent dealers over 35 years ago, this company has been committed to a 
policy which recognizes that the dealers it serves are independent businessmen who have the right to run their stations free from 
coercion or improper pressure on the part of any Company representative.  * * *. FIRST, with respect to our gasoline, we believe every dealer must use his best efforts to promote their sale to the motorist.  We 
believe every dealer should provide prompt and courteous service and just treatment to customers, hire adequate help, maintain 
reasonable hours of operation and keep the premises in a clean and attractive condition. SECOND, with respect to motor oils, we expect you as a minimum to stock and display our line of oils, since most motorists who 
buy our gasolines also wish to purchase our motor oils. However, no Company representative may bring any pressure to bear 
on you if you also choose to handle some competitive brands. THIRD, with respect to tires, batteries, and accessories, you have complete freedom to buy these products from whomever and 
in whatever quantities you choose.  The Company will not tolerate coercion, harassment, or improper pressure of any kind by 
our salesmen in the sale of these products.  However, because we believe our line of TBA offers you an unparalleled opportunity 
for additional profit, we expect our salesmen to call your attention to the merits of our products and try to sell them to you. FOURTH, with respect to all products, you have an absolute right to set your own resale prices except in states where Standard 
Oil products are fair traded.  You also are free to display and promote your products as you see fit.  While we have developed a 
wide variety of advertising, sales promotion and merchandising programs which we believe will assist you in your sales efforts, 
you are free to reject them if you desire.  We will, of course, give you our suggestions and advice on all of these matters based 
on our long experience in the business, but you alone must decide your own course of action. "
1480,6," (Y)ou are instructed that a fiduciary relationship existed between the defendant and the plaintiff.  A fiduciary relationship is one 
founded on trust or confidence placed by one person in the integrity and fidelity of another person.  Out of such a relation, the 
law requires that neither party exert undue influence or pressure upon the other, take selfish advantage of his trust or deal with 
the subject matter of the trust in such a way as to benefit himself or prejudice the other except in the exercise of the utmost good 
faith and with the full knowledge and consent of the other person involved."
1480,7," In this connection the district court further instructed the jury Inter alia : If you find that the circumstances presented during the time period in question were such that the reason for maintaining a 24-
hour operation could not be fulfilled, then you may consider that fact in deciding whether the plaintiff substantially performed his 
obligations under the terms of the lease, notwithstanding his failure to maintain a 24-hour operation. You are instructed that under the laws of the State of South Dakota that the terms of the contract may be implied if manifested 
by the conduct of the parties.  Therefore, if you should find that under all the facts and circumstances presented, that the 
defendant's conduct implied that it would supply plaintiff with sufficient quantities of gasoline and other petroleum products to 
enable the plaintiff to maintain a 24-hour operation, then you may also find that the defendant's failure to fulfill that implied 
condition would excuse the plaintiff's failure to maintain a 24-hour operation of the station. You are instructed that under the laws of the State of South Dakota the failure of a party to perform under the terms of an 
agreement is excused when the party's performance is prevented by the act of the other party, or by the operation of law. The district court further instructed as follows as to the essential elements which plaintiff must establish: First, that the defendant terminated its lease with the plaintiff without good cause. In this regard, good cause is defined as the 
failure by plaintiff to substantially perform his obligations to the defendant under the terms of the lease; Second, that as a direct and proximate result of the defendant's termination of the lease, the plaintiff suffered a loss; and Third, the monetary amount of that loss. "
1482,8," It is true, as Amoco contends, that the court's instruction was taken from Mobil Oil Corp. v. Rubenfeld, 72 Misc.2d 392, 339 
N.Y.S.2d 623 (N.Y.City Civ.Ct.1972), a case in which the determination that a fiduciary relationship existed between the dealer 
and the oil company was reversed on appeal.  In reversing, however, the court noted that the New York legislature had passed a 
franchise statute, but the bill was vetoed by the governor and did not become law.  The court concluded that New York, 
therefore, had negated any fiduciary policy of termination only for cause by failing to enact the statute.  Mobil Oil Corp. v. 
Rubenfeld, 48 A.D.2d 428, 370 N.Y.S.2d 943, 949 (Sup.Ct.1975). This is plainly distinguishable from the instant case due to 
South Dakota's Franchise Act. "

1487,14," Counsel for Amoco was present when the jury returned its verdicts and in fact requested that each juror be individually polled 
on each and every interrogatory and verdict."
1487,15," Although not raised by the parties, we suggest that if a new trial occurs, the better practice is to omit from the jury instructions 
any reference to the trebling of damages in connection with the recovery of damages under the antitrust laws. See Devitt & 
Blackmar, 3 Federal Practice and Instructions ยง 90.39 (3d ed. 1977). "
1488,1," The appellant's objection that the proof of damages offered by the appellee was speculative has merit, but it does not appear 
that appellant objected to some of the evidence now questioned.  Moreover, the jury quite obviously did not accept the 
calculations of plaintiff's expert.  Under these circumstances, I agree with the majority that the jury award may stand if the 
appellee accepts the remittitur."
1488,2," In the passage relied on by the majority, plaintiff's counsel was attempting to explain the New Jersey Superior Court's 
interpretation of that state's franchise statute in Shell Oil Co. v. Marinello, 120 N.J.Super. 357, 294 A.2d 253 (1972), Aff'd, 63 
N.J. 402, 307 A.2d 598 (1973), Cert. denied, 415 U.S. 920, 94 S. Ct. 1421, 39 L. Ed. 2d 475 (1974). Judge Nichol interrupted to 
observe, ""In other words, they were codifying the common law."" Plaintiff's counsel replied, ""That's exactly right."" Judge Nichol 
then said, ""Just as Maybe South Dakota did when it adopted the Franchise Act, was codifying what was really the law in South 
Dakota anyway."" (Emphasis added.) Plaintiff's counsel responded, ""That's exactly what the New Jersey Court said."" "
1489,3," The evident purpose of the statutory and common law termination requirements * * * is the protection of franchisees who have 
conscientiously striven to carry out their obligations under the franchise agreement.  They were not intended to prevent the 
severance of those who deliberately disregard reasonable requirements contained in their contract with the franchiser. ( 
Amerada Hess Corp. v. Quinn, 143 N.J.Super. 237, 362 A.2d 1258, 1267 (1976).)"
1489,4," This error was not made harmless by the context in which it occurred, as the majority suggests.  Ante, at 884.  The disputed 
instruction was repeated by the court without benefit of context when, after two hours of deliberations, the jury returned with the 
question, ""Define fiduciary duty."""
1489,5," 15 U.S.C. ยง 1 provides in pertinent part: ""Every contract, combination * * * or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce 
among the several States, * * * is hereby declared to be illegal(.)"""
1489,6," If I were writing on a clean slate with only the rule of reason for guidance, See Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 221 U.S. 1, 
31 S. Ct. 502, 55 L. Ed. 619 (1911), I would be hard pressed to find unlawful an actual combination that succeeded in keeping 
down Arnott's prices.  Arnott was, after all, exploiting the modicum of monopoly pricing power that he enjoyed by virtue of his 
location on an interstate highway. Arnott testified that, in effect, many of his customers were ignorant of the prices charged by his off-highway competitors.  He 
therefore found it advantageous to raise his prices; demand for his gas was not greatly reduced.  Amoco, on the other hand, had 
a direct interest in maintaining the volume of Arnott's sales, in part because his lease payments were based solely on fuel 
gallonage.  See Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 56 n. 24, 97 S. Ct. 2549, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568 (1977). 
Amoco also had an important interest in the pricing reputation of its stations generally.  Success in restraining Arnott's prices 
would have advanced the interests of both Amoco and Arnott's customers, at the same time replicating (with respect to Arnott) 
the consequences of a fully competitive retail gasoline market.  See Albrecht v. Herald Co., 390 U.S. 145, 169, 88 S. Ct. 869, 19 
L. Ed. 2d 998 (1968) (Stewart, J., dissenting). "
1490,," The Supreme Court has, however, displaced the rule of reason in cases such as this by making agreements or combinations to 
fix maximum prices Per se illegal.  Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Seagram & Sons, 340 U.S. 211, 213, 71 S. Ct. 259, 95 L. Ed. 219 
(1951); Albrecht v. Herald Co., supra, 390 U.S. at 151, 88 S. Ct. 869. But cf.  Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., supra 
(restoring the rule of reason in cases addressing the legality of vertical nonprice restrictions).  Notwithstanding the caveat in 
Continental T. V. distinguishing price from nonprice restrictions, 433 U.S. at 51 n. 18, 97 S. Ct. 2549, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568, the 
Court's reasoning in that case suggests that the Per se approach adopted in Albrecht may not survive reexamination.  See 
Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., supra, 433 U.S. at 69-70, 97 S. Ct. 2549 (White, J., concurring); Posner, The Rule of 
Reason and the Economic Approach: Reflections on the Sylvania Decision, 45 U.Chic.L.Rev. 1, 12 (1977); Koches,

266-68 (1978); Pitofsky, The Sylvania Case: Antitrust Analysis of Non-Price Vertical Restrictions, 78 Colum.L.Rev. 1, 16 n. 59 
(1978). "
1491,7," To be sure, Arnott alleged that Amoco breached this promise.  But the breach of a contract term does not transform the 
contract, so that what it once promised, it now forbids.  Nor can it be argued that price fixing was a term in an implied contract 
that replaced the fraudulently induced lease agreement; as noted above, Arnott never agreed to such a term.  If Amoco sought 
to fix Arnott's prices, it did so in spite of, not in furtherance of, the terms of their agreement.  Theirs was simply not a contract in 
restraint of trade."
1491,8," Examples of this process may be found in Call Carl, Inc. v. BP Oil Corp., 554 F.2d 623 (4th Cir.), Cert. denied, 434 U.S. 923, 
98 S. Ct. 400, 54 L. Ed. 2d 280 (1977); Knutson v. Daily Review, Inc., 548 F.2d 795 (9th Cir. 1976), Cert. denied, 433 U.S. 910,

1495,2, .  Bates has settled with plaintiff and no longer has any interest in this action.
1495,3," .  In each instance Ambook dealt with Victor Schiff, who specialized in the direct response advertising in which Ambook was 
interested.  Mr. Schiff was associated with Newmark, Posner & Mitchell, Inc., in an office and credit sharing arrangement, and 
Victor Schiff & Company had a similar arrangement with Kaplan.  Newmark, Posner & Mitchell, Inc. and the Kaplan Agency were 
apparently members of the 4As; Schiff/Brown & Company was not."

(D.C.Cir. 1977)."
1498,11," .  The Time report, referred to below, indicates that the system may have gone back as far as 1864.  Although it has become 
customary to speak of the 15% As a ""commission"", it is not such in the ordinary sense.  The advertising agency is not the seller's 
agent but the buyer's.  The system is thus better characterized as a dual price system the card rate for the direct advertiser and 
15% Less when the advertising is done through an agency with the agency receiving the difference."
1498,12," .  For example, if an advertiser could perform the services rendered by the agency at 8% Of the card rate, his costs would be 
7% Less if he could deal directly with the medium at the rate accorded the agency.  One item of potential saving would be any 
excess of the agency's profit over what would be a fair return on whatever assets the advertiser devoted to providing the 
services; plaintiff adduced evidence that the return on investment for five publicly traded advertising agencies during the period 
1968 through 1972 averaged over 19%. "
1499,13," .  (A) A conspiracy among all the defendants whereby the media associations adopt substantially uniform standards for 
recognition of advertising agencies, only agencies meeting such standards may be extended credit and allowed agency 
commissions, agencies which rebate any part of their commissions to advertisers will be cut off; recognition will be denied to 
house agencies; and gross rates would be charged to direct advertisers. Also that members of the media associations adhere to 
their published rates, and that agency commissions be fixed and maintained at 15% Of the gross rate for advertising. (B) A 
conspiracy between the 4As and its members whereby members would retain all commissions and not rebate any part of them 
to advertisers; commissions would be retained at 15%; and that members refrain from competing with each other by submitting 
advertising copy etc. in solicitation of new business.  (C), (D), (E), (F) and (G) Conspiracies between the media associations and 
their members to substantially the same effect as (A)."
1499,14," .  We are, of course, fully aware that under ยง 5(a) of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 16(a), a plaintiff cannot make use of a 
consent decree against a defendant in an action where no testimony was taken, and also that private plaintiffs cannot enforce 
government consent decrees, see United States v. American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, 341 F.2d 1003, 
1007-08 (2 Cir.), Cert. denied, 382 U.S. 877, 86 S. Ct. 160, 15 L. Ed. 2d 119 (1965); Dahl, Inc. v. Roy Cooper Co., Inc., 448

However, we read the district court's opinion and appellees' argument as taking the consent decrees as a watershed, see 464 F. 
Supp. at 1137. Conceding, as seemingly they must, that certain of the pre-1956 practices violated ยง 1, appellees contend that all "
1500,," the evils existing then have since been cured.  It is thus primarily the defendants who rely on the consent decree; we view it 
simply as a historical fact."
1500,15, .  These are:
1500,1, . Media commissions plus percentage of other charges and additional fees for certain specified services.
1500,2," . Same as No. 1, without the additional fees for certain specified services."
1500,3, . Media commissions only.

1500,8," . Cost plus an agreed overage. The last two are wholly unrelated to the media 15% ""commission"". "
1501,16," .  The fact that apparently there was little direct advertising does not undermine the possibility of this inference.  A jury could 
find that, without substantially unanimous action by the media to prevent it, a market for such advertising could be expected to 
develop, a market which those adhering to the dual rate system would lose to the renegades.  Nor does the fact that the effect of 
unanimous action would be essentially to eliminate direct advertising as a mode of doing business (except for those advertisers 
able to create house agencies) invalidate the analysis: non-unanimous action would have the far more deleterious effect on 
those adhering to the system of channeling direct advertisers to non-adhering competitors. "
1502,17," .  Professor Handler doubts whether a verdict for the plaintiff in Theatre Enterprises would have been upheld, 1 Twenty-Five 
Years of Antitrust 565-66, and so do we.  Defendants had proffered such overwhelming evidence of the individual reasons for 
their parallel behavior as completely to overcome whatever inference would arise from that alone."

1503,20," .  The precise instruction was: TIME wants to eliminate the agency commission.  What are the alternatives to this method of compensation?  How can these 
alternatives be implemented? This language suggests that at least when the inquiry began the publisher of Time considered the agency ""commission"" 
something against Time's interest, to which it was being held by others. "
1504,21," .  Auer was surely right about this.  The agency is the advertiser's agent, not the media's. It would be wholly improper for the 
agency to include in its charges to a client services as sales agent for the medium.  Yet Bond could be taken as having more 
than implied that the agencies were doing exactly this."
1504,22," .  We do not read the record as waiving any right of Ambook to call such persons.  The limitation referred to above (p. 609) was 
on the specific issue of Ambook's relations with Schiff-Brown."
1504,23," .  Appellant seemingly assumes that if an agreement for a dual pricing system existed, this would be a Per se violation of ยง 1.  
Appellees, concentrating on the alleged absence of sufficient evidence of an agreement and the other points discussed in this 
section, did not argue whether such an agreement would constitute a Per se violation or would be subject to the rule of reason.  
Plaintiff made no claim that members of the media agreed among themselves to fix their card rates.  The case seems more 
analogous to concerted refusal to deal.  We note that recently there has been considerable questioning of the applicability of Per "

1526,1," .  In this Final Order of Dismissal, filed August 23, 1977, in which the judge dismissed all other claims against those defendants, 
apparently on his own motion, express reference was made only to the monopoly claims, but we will treat the order as also a 
dismissal of the conspiracy claims against Burger King and Davmor under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6)."
1526,2," .  Davmor and Burger King argue that the Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) dismissal of the claims against Carpenter is not properly before 
this court, that order allegedly having become final before the trial court's final order of dismissal.  Carpenter did not make an 
appearance in this appeal, although it was properly served with notice of appeal. We conclude Perington may challenge that 
order.  In multiparty actions such as this, unless the trial judge expressly directs entry of a final judgment as to less than all the 
parties in accordance with the requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b), the order does not become final until entry of judgment 
adjudicating all the claims, rights and liabilities of all the parties.  Golden Villa Spa, Inc. v. Health Industries, Inc., 549 F.2d 1363, 
1364 (10th Cir. 1977); Pipeliners Local Union No. 798 v. Ellerd, 503 F.2d 1193, 1199 (10th Cir. 1974). Since the trial judge did 
not make such an entry, the order was not final until the final order of dismissal from which Perington appeals.  An appeal from a 
final judgment draws into question all nonfinal orders preceding it.  Herron v. Rozelle, 480 F.2d 282, 285 (10th Cir. 1973); 9 
Moore's Federal Practice P 203.18 (2d ed. 1975).  The notice of appeal was not misleading and the docketing statement filed 
according to Tenth Cir. R. 8 fairly apprised the parties, including Carpenter, of the issues to be argued.  Therefore, we conclude 
the questioned matters are properly before this court. "
1527,3," .  Because we have concluded that the amendment added nothing to the original complaint, we need not deal with Davmor's 
and Burger King's contention that the additional count's reference to Carpenter ""only"" somehow requires a different result 
concerning the allegations against them. "
1528,4," .  Defendants would make much of the fact that Perington conducted no discovery, although it allegedly had ample opportunity 
to develop facts to show in detail the nature of the alleged violations.  While we do not condone Perington's dilatory conduct of 
the litigation, we cannot agree that failure to discover, when the complaint is otherwise adequate, justifies dismissal for failure to 
state a claim for relief.  If a party has had ample opportunity to discover, yet has not, the opposing party may move for summary 
judgment under Rule 56 and thereby put the claimant to its proof on the merits.  Natrona Service, Inc. v. Continental Oil Co., 598 "
1529,," F.2d 1294 (10th Cir. 1979). See also First Nat'l Bank v. Cities Service Co., 391 U.S. 253, 288-290, 88 S. Ct. 1575, 20 L. Ed. 2d 
569 (1968); Modern Home Inst., Inc. v. Hartford Accident & Indem. Co., 513 F.2d 102 (2d Cir. 1975). "
1530,5," .  Even though Perington's complaint pursued only the theory of a tying arrangement violating this statute, we must examine the 
complaint to determine if the allegations support relief on any possible theory.  See Robertson v. Johnston, 376 F.2d 43 (5th Cir. 
1967); 5 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure: Civil ยง 1357 (1969). "
1532,6," .  Whether Perington's complaint asserts the claim of conspiring to monopolize is ambiguous, but in view of the liberal rules of 
pleading, we conclude it fairly raises this claim. "
1533,7," .  While the trial court treated the affidavit as ""an additional amendment to the amended complaint, as amended,"" the order 
related to the Rule 56(b) motion and an evidentiary question.  We therefore treat the affidavit as a matter outside of the 
pleadings and the order as one granting summary judgment. "
1543,1," .  Both plaintiffs' complaint and this Court's order of September 8, 1978, mistakenly refer to FNMA as a ""quasi-public"" 
corporation.  Prior to 1968, the federal government did own the preferred stock of FNMA.  However, the Housing and Urban 
Development Act of 1968, 12 U.S.C. ยงยง 1716b, 1717(a)(2), partitioned FNMA into the Government National Mortgage 
Association (GNMA), under the jurisdiction of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and FNMA became a wholly 
private corporation serving a public purpose."
1543,2, .  This dismissal order is now on appeal to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
1544,3," .  The A.M. Best Company has issued reports on insurance companies since 1900.  It is now the only major specialized 
insurance reporting and rating service in the United States.  Best's provides two ratings. First is the ""Financial Size Category"" 
with which we are primarily concerned here.  The second is the ""Policyholders' Rating"" which gives Best's opinion as to the 
relative permanence and safety of each company.  Best's ratings are widely used in the mortgage field."
1544,4," .  Actually, in 1974 Best's ""Financial Size Category"" was rated alphabetically.  Thus, FNMA and FHLMC adopted a BBB+ rating. 
In 1976 Best's converted from an alphabetical to a numerical system and Class VI became the appropriate rating. "
1547,5," .  Anchor claims that its Class VI requirement is also based upon its desire to protect its shareholders and depositors, this being 
part of the reason why Anchor had an even higher rating requirement for many years prior to 1974. "
1550,6," .  To put this another way, in order for a boycott to constitute a Per se violation, it must have as its purpose either the exclusion 
of a competitor or some other anticompetitive goal.  Alpha-Sentura Business Services, Inc. v. Interbank Card Ass'n, supra ; 
Chastain v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 401 F. Supp. 151, 161 (D.D.C.1975); Jones v. National Collegiate Athletic 
Ass'n, 392 F. Supp. 295, 304 (D.Mass.1975). "
1551,7," .  Plaintiffs claim that the Supreme Court's recent decision in St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Barry, supra, 438 U.S. at 531, 98 
S. Ct. 2923, substantially broadened the definition of boycott in the antitrust context.  However, it appears that Barry merely held 
that a ""boycott"" includes at least the practice involved in that case, I. e., an agreement by which one company ""induced its 
competitors to refuse to deal on any terms with its customers."" Smith v. Pro Football, Inc., supra, 593 F.2d at 1180, n. 22. Such a 
factual situation is not present here.  Further, Barry once again made it clear that not all concerted refusals to deal are Per se 
invalid.  Neeld v. National Hockey League, supra, 594 F.2d at 1298-1299 n. 3. "
