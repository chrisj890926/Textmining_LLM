regulating the business of insurance, or which imposes a fee or tax upon such business, unless such Act specifically relates to 
the business of insurance: Provided, That after June 30, 1948, the Act of July 2, 1890, as amended, known as the Sherman Act, 
and the Act of October 15, 1914, as amended, known as the Clayton Act, and the Act of September 26, 1914, known as the 
Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, shall be applicable to the business of insurance to the extent that such business is 
not regulated by State law. "

28,1," .  In district court, the insurance company defendants insisted that ""disposition of this case is simplified because the McCarran 
Act questions it raises have been disposed of in at least five recent cases . . . With facts not materially distinguishable from those 
involved here."" ""Insurance Company Defendants' Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Their Motion to Dismiss"" 
at 7. One of these cases was Royal Drug (defendants relied on the district court's holding in that case that the pharmacy 
agreements Were the business of insurance. 415 F. Supp. 343 (W.D.Tex.1976). Of the four other cases the defendants here 
found indistinguishable, two were singled out by the Supreme Court in Royal Drug as being ""in conflict"" with the Court's own 
interpretation of the phrase ""business of insurance"": Anderson v. Medical Service, 551 F.2d 304 (4th Cir. 1977) and Proctor v. 
State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., 182 U.S. App D.C. 264, 561 F.2d 262 (D.C.Cir. 1977) (Vacated and remanded, 
440 U.S. 942, 99 S. Ct. 1417, 59 L. Ed. 2d 631 (1979)). Royal Drug, 440 U.S. 205, 99 S. Ct. 1067 at 1072, n.2."
28,2," .  Congress' primary concern in enacting the McCarran Act was to ""ensure that the States would continue to have the ability to 
tax and regulate the business of insurance,"" Royal Drug, 99 S. Ct. at 1076, following the Supreme Court's ruling that insurance 
is interstate commerce. The applicability of the antitrust laws to the insurance business was only a ""secondary concern,"" which 
""focused simply on whether cooperative rate-making should be exempt."" Id. at 1076, 1079. See S.Rep. No. 20, 79th Cong., 1st 
Sess. (1945); H.R.Rep. No. 143, 79th Cong., 1st Sess. (1945); 91 Cong.Rec. 1442-1444, 1477-1489 (1945). "
29,3," .  Plaintiffs claim that the insurance companies' participation goes beyond their use of peer review recommendations to 
determine the amount of reimbursement they will pay. According to plaintiffs, the insurers have advised their policyholders that 
plaintiffs' fees are unreasonable, and have defended policyholders against suit brought by plaintiffs to recover the difference 
between plaintiffs' actual charge and the ceiling fixed by the peer review committee."
29,4," .  For a detailed history of the McCarran Act, See C. Weller, The McCarran-Ferguson Act's Antitrust Exemption for Insurance: 
Language, History and Policy, 1978 Duke L.J. 587."
29,5," .  Two of the ten articles in the Virginia Code's insurance provisions were enacted in direct response to the McCarran Act. Article 
6 apparently seeks to fully displace the Federal Trade Commission Act within the state, by listing and defining all insurance 
company practices ""which constitute unfair methods of competition or unfair or deceptive acts or practices and by prohibiting the 
trade practices so defined or determined."" Va.Code §§ 38.1-49 to -57. See FTC v. National Casualty Co., 357 U.S. 560, 78 S. "
30,," Ct. 1260, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1540 (1958). The State Corporation Commission is given enforcement power, but may not ""enlarge upon 
or extend"" the detailed listing in the statute. Va.Code § 38.1-53. Article 7, the ""antitrust provisions,"" does not purport to be 
similarly exclusive. It simply forbids two types of activities, insurance company mergers and interlocking directorates, if they 
would ""substantially lessen competition generally in the business of insurance, or (tend) to create a monopoly therein."" Id., §§ 
38.1-58, -59. There is no indication that, by failing to deal with other practices having an anti-competitive impact, the Virginia 
legislature intended to authorize such practices or to remove them from federal antitrust scrutiny. In addition to the Code provisions relating specifically to the insurance business, Virginia has a state antitrust law, Va.Code § 
59.1-9.1 Et seq., which arguably applies to the conduct alleged in plaintiffs' complaint. See Blue Cross v. Commonwealth, 211 
Va. 180, 176 S.E.2d 439 (1970). But the McCarran Act does not grant primacy to all types of state regulation which might apply 
to the business of insurance. The Act concerns only ""the type of state regulation that centers around the contract of insurance."" 
SEC v. National Securities, Inc., 393 U.S. 453, 460, 89 S. Ct. 564, 568, 21 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1969)."
30,6," .  In 1977, the insurance code's listing of unfair or deceptive trade practices was amended to prohibit fourteen specific ""unfair 
claim settlement practices."" Va.Code § 38.1-52(8a). Regardless of whether this statute now provides state regulation of the 
particular conduct at issue in this case, and it is not clear from the face of the statute that it does, it would not bar plaintiffs' 
complaint, which was filed in 1977 and concerns conduct which began in 1973. The conduct of defendant chiropractors is clearly not regulated by the state's insurance laws. Those laws apply only to insurance 
companies and their agents, and the State Corporation Commission, which has enforcement responsibility, has no authority over 
providers of services. See Blue Cross v. Commonwealth, supra at 192, 176 S.E.2d at 447. Yet the majority offers McCarran 
immunity to all defendants, including the ACA, which is not even subject to service of process within the state."
30,7," .  In signing the McCarran Act, President Roosevelt stated that ""Congress did not intend to permit private rate fixing which the 
Antitrust Act forbids, but was willing to permit actual regulation of rates by affirmative action by the states."" S. Rosenman, The 
Public Papers of Franklin D. Roosevelt 587 (1950) (quoted in Royal Drug, supra, 99 S. Ct. at 1079). As the Court noted in Royal 
Drug, 99 S. Ct. at 1076-1080, the floor debates also show that the Act's purpose was to defer to the states' desire to permit 
certain anticompetitive conduct, particularly cooperative ratemaking. See 91 Cong.Rec. 1442-1444, 1477-1489 (1945). "
31,1," This requested award appears to have mistakenly omitted some 126.00 hours of billable time.  The sum of the categories of 
time spent in Appendix C-3 to the ""Memorandum of Harold Brown In Support of the Petition For Fees and Costs"" exceeds the 
sum of the hours attributed to each of the three named attorneys by that figure. Because I have determined this discrepancy to 
have been the result of a mathematical error and, moreover, because the position of the objectors to the application would not 
be materially affected or altered by an increase in the number of hours billed by petitioners, I will consider the application as 
correctly requesting an award which would encompass the additional 126.00 hours. "
32,2," From this total award petitioners will, of course, reimburse to class members monies which had been advanced in the form of 
retainers ($ 58,400.00) or expenses ($ 6,778.86)."
32,3," 15 U.S.C. § 15 provides: Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue 
therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides . . .  without respect to the amount 
in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's 
fees."
32,4," The compromise settlement reached in this case included, in addition to contractual changes in the franchise agreements, a 
fund of $ 900,000.00. "
33,5," The Court notes that in many instances, Mr. Brown has attributed a great deal of hours to single dates.  Specifically, on 
November 27, 1973 he assigned 62.00 hours; on April 12, 1974, 87.00 hours are charged; 28.00 hours are billed for May 30, 
1974 and, on January 13, 1975, 30.00 hours are listed.  Obviously, the times charged must represent the total number of hours 
put in over several days.  Therefore, while this type of billing is somewhat of a hindrance to the Court, the hours will not be 
rejected as having insufficient documentation."
33,6," The remaining 4.20 hours of non-compensated time is comprised as follows: 1) 3.00 hours of the 4.00 hours charged on 
November 18, 1974 for studying issues of moving for a separate trial of liability and damages.  Since this case ended in 
settlement, the fund was not benefitted by these hours.  2) On June 24, 1974 Mr. Brown charged 2.00 hours for studying this 
Court's two-page order adopting the Magistrate's recommendation concerning discovery motions 1.00 is clearly sufficient.  3) 
Finally, the remaining .20 hour was disallowed because Mr. Brown sought to be compensated for reserving a room at a hotel on 
October 16, 1978. "
35,7, See Appendix A-1 (Economic Expert's Final Report). 
36,8," Petitioners' figures with respect to hours worked by Stadfeld and Pease differ somewhat from the findings made by this Court.  
The information contained in the diary of time records (Appendix C-1) as well as the categorized graph extrapolated therefrom 
(Appendix C-2) were of little assistance to the Court in this regard."
36,9, See Appendix to this Memorandum for computational analysis.
36,10," This amount does not include compensation for 25.00 hours of ""Post Settlement Activity"" due to the nebulous nature of this 
particular category and due also to the fact that the lodestar encompasses a total of 254.00 hours for ""Settlement Promotion"" 
and ""Settlement Procedures."" See Appendix. Furthermore, the 49.80 hours billed for work done in preparation of the fee application has not been factored in because that 
time benefitted only the petitioners and not the class fund.  See Lindy II, supra, 540 F.2d at 111. Petitioners' contention that the 
fee award in Souza v. Southworth, 564 F.2d 609 (1st Cir. 1977) controls here is not persuasive.  Souza speaks to compensation 
for time spent litigating the fee issue on appeal and is therefore not directly on point with the issue before this Court. "
42,1," .  The action was initiated in the District Court of Mercer County, North Dakota. It was removed on the basis of diversity of 
citizenship, 28 U.S.C. § 1332 to the federal District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1441. "

likewise refrain from expressing a view on this question. "

45,5," .  See, e. g., Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., 405 U.S. 251, 92 S. Ct. 885, 31 L. Ed. 2d 184 (1972); Buckley Towers Condominium, 
Inc. v. Buchwald, 533 F.2d 934 (5th Cir. 1976), Cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1121, 97 S. Ct. 1157, 51 L. Ed. 2d 571 (1977); Nassau 
Cty. Ass'n of Ins. Agts., Inc. v. Aetna Life & Cas. Co., 497 F.2d 1151 (2d Cir.), Cert. denied, 419 U.S. 968, 95 S. Ct. 232, 42 L. 
Ed. 2d 184 (1974). "
46,6," .  Bechtel relies upon Buckley Towers Condominium, Inc. v. Buchwald, supra, for the proposition that an association cannot 
obtain standing as a representative for the harms alleged to its members in § 16 actions. In that case, the plaintiff, an association 
of condominium owners, attempted to challenge an allegedly illegal tying arrangement involving the condominium's builder. The 
Court denied standing under § 16. While acknowledging that the Supreme Court in ""Warth held that an association may have 
standing as the representative of its members even in the absence of injury to itself,"" it found Warth to be ""inapposite"" to the 
case before it, stating that injury to the members was not ""of the sort that would make out a justiciable case (even if) the 
members themselves had been parties to the suit."" Id. at 938 n. 3. In light of this language, we think this case is better analyzed 
as one in which the Court determined that neither the association nor its members had presented allegations stating a claim for 
relief under substantive antitrust law, rather than a case in which standing was actually lacking. Bechtel also relies upon Nassau Cty. Ass'n of Ins. Agts., Inc. v. Aetna Life & Cas. Co., supra, and N.A.A.C.P. v. New York 
Clearing House Ass'n, 431 F. Supp. 405 (S.D.N.Y.1977). Nassau County was decided before Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 95 
S. Ct. 2197, 45 L. Ed. 2d 343 (1975), and is of little assistance here. Similarly, in N.A.A.C.P., the court relied heavily on Nassau 
County to reach its conclusion that ""the standing rules developed in treble damage cases apply to the plaintiffs in this injunctive 
relief action."" 431 F. Supp. at 409. We think that a better analysis of the associational standing issue under § 16 appears in DeGregorio v. Segal, 443 F. Supp. 
1257 (E.D.Pa.1978). There, individual plaintiffs were joined by the Philadelphia Welfare Rights Organization (PWRO) in alleging 
a conspiracy among nursing homes to fix prices. Both § 4 and § 16 relief were sought. The PWRO was denied standing under § 
4 despite the fact that the suit was found to be germane to its purposes because it ""failed to demonstrate that Each member 
would have standing or that individual participation would not be necessary."" Id. at 1264 (emphasis in original). This, we take it, 
reflects a concern with the problems of proving damage in a § 4 action. The association was, however, granted § 16 standing. 
Citing Warth, the court, in a footnote, wrote: In light of the allegations that PWRO members are being denied needed nursing facilities care which places their lives and 
health in serious jeopardy, the association has adequately asserted ""injury to its members of sufficient immediacy and ripeness 
to warrant judicial intervention."" Id. at 1265 n. 13 (citation omitted). "
47,7," .  This vote was taken before the filing of the original complaint in state court. There is no indication that a second vote was 
taken on the amended complaint."
47,8," .  HN8[
] Section 34-01-14 of the N.D.Cent.Code provides as follows: The right of persons to work shall not be denied or abridged on account of membership or nonmembership in any labor union or 
labor organization, and all contracts in negation or abrogation of such rights are hereby declared to be invalid, void and 
unenforceable."
47,9," .  N.D.Cent.Code §§ 34-08-02, 34-09-01, 34-10-02 (repealed 1965), and 34-12-03."
47,10," .  HN9[
] N.D.Cent.Code § 34-01-05 provides as follows: "
48,," Every person who, by any use of force, threats, or intimidation, prevents or endeavors to prevent another from employing any 
person, and every person who uses force, threats, or intimidation to compel another to employ any person, or to force or induce 
another to alter his mode of carrying on business, or to limit or increase the number of his hired foremen, journeymen, 
apprentices, workmen, laborers, servants, or other persons employed by him, or their rate of wages or time of service, is guilty of 
a class B misdemeanor."
48,11," .  HN12[
] A closed shop is one in which only union members can obtain work. A union shop is one in which employees are 
required to join a union within a specified period after starting their employment. An agency shop is one in which the requirement 
is not of joining a union within the specified period, but of paying the equivalent of union dues within that time, leaving the 
decision to join to the worker."
48,12," .  Jurisdiction, however, would be in the National Labor Relations Board, not in state court. As noted by the District Court: If there were discrimination In fact, the proper forum for any dispute arising from such discrimination would be the National Labor 
Relations Board, for discrimination based on union membership status is an unfair labor practice. 29 U.S.C. § 158(a)(3). The 
state courts would not have jurisdiction over discrimination In fact, absent an agreement requiring discrimination, for § 14(b) 
speaks of ""the execution or application of Agreements requiring membership in a labor organization as a condition of 
employment . . . ."" (emphasis added). For § 14(b) to apply, then, there must be discrimination on the face of the agreement, and 
that discrimination must be in the form of a union security clause, I. e., a union shop or agency shop agreement."
48,457, F. Supp. at 1219 n.10 (emphasis by the District Court). 
49,13," .  In recognition of the problems of preemption facing its Count Four allegation, the AGC also pled that the defendants' conduct 
could induce its members to commit violations of the federal labor laws. If these were indeed violations of either §§ 8(a)(1) or 
8(a)(3) of the NLRA, the National Labor Relations Board would have exclusive jurisdiction. 29 U.S.C. § 160(a). "
52,*, Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council. 
53,1," The trial court gave Guild's instruction 37: ""Under the facts of this case any restrictions and limitations on territories or on 
customers imposed by Guild on its distributors would not constitute a violation of the antitrust laws entitling Mr. Sosnick to 
recover unless the acts were taken by Guild not as a producer or manufacturer interested in the distribution of its product, but 
rather were taken to enforce an agreement or conspiracy among the competing independent wholesalers of its product to divide 
the territories and customers between themselves. ""If you find that such an agreement existed, that is an agreement between the independent wholesalers to divide the market and 
to allocate the customers and that Guild, in terminating Sosnick, knowingly joined and acted as a party or acted in furtherance of 
that agreement, then you must find in favor of Sosnick and against Guild on this issue."""
53,2," The court also gave Guild's instruction 36: ""I instruct you that if Guild, provided it was acting alone and not pursuant to an 
unlawful conspiracy asked Sosnick to cease dealing with Lucky Stores because it wanted to service Lucky Stores and then 
terminated Sosnick because he refused, an antitrust violation could not be established for that termination."""
53,3," Sosnick's proposed instructions 17 and 19 stated: ""A seller of goods has a legal right to announce to his customers that he has 
established a policy prohibiting such customers from reselling the goods to a specified person or persons, and to refuse to deal 
with any customer who does not follow the policy.  But it is illegal for the seller to take affirmative action, such as threatening to 
stop selling to his customer, to enforce his policy.  Furthermore, the law imposes two important limitations on this right: ""First, if a seller announces to his customer a policy which -- if accepted by the customer -- would result in an illegal horizontal 
customer allocation agreement, it is illegal for the seller to go beyond a mere announcement of the policy and use other means -
- such as threats of termination if the customer refuses to comply -- which effect adherence to the policy. ""Second, it is illegal for the seller to refuse to deal with a customer, if the refusal is made pursuant to an illegal combination or 
conspiracy."" (Instruction 17.) ""If a supplier (such as Guild) having an ongoing business relationship with a distributor (such as Sosnick) requests the distributor 
to enter into an agreement which would violate the Cartwright Act; if the distributor refuses to enter into the proposed illegal 
agreement; if the supplier exerts pressure upon the distributor to accept the illegal agreement; and if the supplier terminates the 
distributor because of the distributor's refusal to accept, then the termination itself is in violation of the Cartwright Act."" 
(Instruction 19.) "
57,1," A nonprice distribution restraint restricts competition among wholesale or retail distributors by, e.g., forbidding distributors from 
selling from any but a designated location, assigning exclusive territories to distributors, reserving certain customers to the 
manufacturer, forbidding wholesale distributors from selling to other than authorized retail outlets, or forbidding distributors from 
selling to other distributors. (See Posner, The Rule of Reason and the Economic Approach: Reflections on the Sylvania Decision 
(1977) 45 U.Chi.L.Rev. 1.) "
58,2," A location restriction limits a distributor's sales of a manufacturer's product to certain authorized outlets.  The manufacturer 
does not assign specific territories, but as a practical matter the size of each distributor's market will be controlled and limited by 
the number of authorized outlets.  (Note, Antitrust Treatment of Intrabrand Territorial Restraints Within a Dual Distribution 
System (1978) 56 Tex.L.Rev. 1486, 1487, fn. 8.)"
58,3," The classic statement of the rule of reason is that of Mr. Justice Brandeis in Chicago Board of Trade  v. United States (1918) 
246 U.S. 231, 238 [62 L.Ed. 683, 687, 38 S.Ct. 242]: ""The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely 
regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition.  To 
determine that question the court must ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its 
condition before and after the restraint was imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable.  The history of 
the restraint, the evil believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, 
are all relevant facts.  This is not because a good intention will save an otherwise objectionable regulation or the reverse; but 
because knowledge of intent may help the court to interpret facts and to predict consequences."" "
60,4," ""A manufacturer employing a dual distribution system markets a product through two separate and competitive channels.  The 
manufacturer supplies independent retailers either directly or through its wholly-owned branch distributors. It also supplies the 
product to independent distributors who resell to retailers. Consequently, the manufacturer, whether or not vertically integrated, 
faces competition on two market levels.  On the production level, it competes interbrand with other manufacturers of the same 
generic product; on the distribution level, it competes intrabrand with the independent distributors of its own brand."" (Note, Antitrust Treatment of Intrabrand Territorial Restraints Within a Dual Distribution System, supra, 56 Tex.L.Rev. 1486, 
1489.)"

67,1," The copyright laws are not involved in this case because business ideas, such as a game concept, cannot be copyrighted, See 
17 U.S.C. § 102(b); Baker v. Selden, 101 U.S. 99, 25 L. Ed. 841 (1880). This copyright rule is analogous to the genericness

protected by a patent. Id. at 102-03."
67,2," The owner of a widely recognized trademark cannot, however, prevent a competitor from referring to the owner's mark in the 
context of comparative advertising. This is so despite the benefits which the competitor reaps from the product recognition 
engendered by the owner's popularization, through expensive advertising, of the mark.  E. g. Smith v. Chanel, Inc., 402 F.2d 562

69,4," Drawing upon antitrust law, Professor McCarthy has suggested that a genus or product category can be defined as including 
commodities for which "" ""there is a cross-elasticity of demand,' "" I. e., that are "" ""reasonably interchangeable by consumers for 
the same purpose.' "" 1 J. McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 12:8 at 418 (1973) (quoting United States v. E. I. 
DuPont de Nemours & Co., 351 U.S. 377, 394-95, 76 S. Ct. 994, 100 L. Ed. 1264 (1956)). If used, cross-elasticity of demand 
analysis, like the genus-species distinction itself, should focus upon consumer perception of product interchangeability. "
70,5," A prior case concerning the PARCHEESI mark, Selchow v. Chaffee & Selchow Mfg. Co., 132 F. 996 (S.D.N.Y.1904), Appeal 
dismissed, 140 F. 989 (2d Cir. 1905), is also instructive.  There, the court declared the PARCHEESI mark invalid because it 
already signified the name of a game in the Indian language when registered as a mark in the United States."
70,6," In a third case, H. B. Chaffee Mfg. Co. v. Selchow, 131 F. 543 (S.D.N.Y.1904), Aff'd, 135 F. 1021 (2d Cir. 1905), the court held 
that when the inventor of a card game ""Flinch"" failed to trademark its name, no one else could, by simply manufacturing the 
selling ""Flinch"" for a long period, obtain that name as a trademark. Id. at 545.  The court stated: The general rule is that the generic name of a thing is not the subject of a trade-mark. . . .  If chess or golf or whist were now 
invented and named, could any manufacturer or vendor of the implements with which such games are played obtain a trade-
mark in their names by selling such implements put up in boxes marked with the names of the games? He, of course, could 
adopt a trade-mark to distinguish the chessmen or the playing cards or the golf clubs which he made from those made by others, 
but I think he could not acquire a trade-mark in the names of the games by simply selling the games after they had become 
known to the public under such names. Id. at 545-46.  Although factually distinguishable, the ""Flinch"" case exemplifies the analysis used herein: that a trademark which 
the public uses primarily to denote the name of a game, rather than a producer, is generic. Various other courts have mentioned, without deciding, the question whether the name of a game is a generic term.  See, e. g., 
Selchow & Righter Co. v. McGraw-Hill Book Co., 580 F.2d 25, 28 (2d Cir. 1978) (""The extent to which (SCRABBLE) has come 
into general use to describe a game or games rather than their origin or source of supply is fairly open to proof"" ; thus, plaintiff, 
owner of SCRABBLE mark, was entitled to a preliminary injunction to prevent the mark's dilution, pending judicial resolution of 
SCRABBLE's validity as a trademark); Affiliated Hosp. Prods., Inc. v. Merdel Game Mfg. Co., 513 F.2d 1183, 1186, 1188-89 (2d 
Cir. 1975) (finding consideration for settlement agreement in possibility, strongly intimated by the district judge, that game name 
CARROM invalid); Application of Cooper, 254 F.2d 611, 614-17, 45 CCPA 923, Cert. denied, 358 U.S. 840, 79 S. Ct. 63, 3 L. 
Ed. 2d 75 (1958) (holding a book title generic, because as the book's name it performs a product-denoting, not source-denoting 
function; observing that Patent Office may be registering names of games erroneously; and stating that if trademarked name of 
game is its only possible descriptive name, mark is generic). "
72,7," It is significant, though not of course dispositive, that the original patent application in August 1935 divulged that ""the game is 
known on the market as Monopoly."" This usage, of course, predated any association of Parker Brothers with the game. This 
should be considered by the district court when analyzing whether, when registered, MONOPOLY primarily denoted the game's 
producer."
72,9," ( The alleged infringer's intent in adopting the mark is weighed, both as probative evidence of the likelihood of confusion and as 
an equitable consideration.) "
80,1," The Act, by definition, classifies all persons who sell or consign gasoline to dealers as ""distributors."" Ga.Code § 106-1103(a).  
Amicus Curiae Gulf Oil Corporation proposes that proper analysis of the gasoline marketing industry requires a tripartite 
classification in which distributors are further defined as either suppliers (major oil refiners or suppliers) or jobbers (middlemen 
who buy from suppliers and sell to retailers).  Most of the parties have employed this nomenclature and we adopt it in portions of 
this order.  Of course, all gasoline marketed in Georgia does not necessarily pass through a three-step distribution process. "
81,2," Section 4A of the Act, cited in Exxon's brief, has been codified as Ga.Code § 106-1104.1.  In this order we will cite to the 
codified form of the statute."
81,3," Exxon has not invoked the court's diversity or pendent jurisdiction, and has not separately discussed the applicability of the 
Georgia constitution.  We thus consider that the case presents only federal constitutional issues."
81,4," HN2[
] Section 106-1104 provides: It shall be a violation of this Chapter for any gasoline distributor who has a marketing agreement with a gasoline dealer, directly 
or indirectly, through any officer, agent or employee, to commit any of the following acts: (a) to terminate or cancel such marketing agreement without good cause prior to the expiration date; (b) to terminate or cancel an existing marketing agreement prior to expiration date or to not enter subsequent agreements 
without having first given written notice setting forth all the reasons for such action to the gasoline dealer at least 60 days in 
advance of such termination, cancellation or expiration of the existing agreement; provided, however, that such notice shall not 
be required of a gasoline distributor acting with reasonable cause to believe said dealer is maliciously and willfully damaging the 
property rights of said gasoline distributor, who has voluntarily abandoned the marketing relationship, or who after five days 
notice has failed to pay his just debts when due to said distributor; "
82,," HN3[
] (c) by the use of coercion, intimidation or threats, to force or induce such gasoline dealer to deal exclusively in products 
manufactured, distributed or sponsored by such gasoline distributor or to participate in promotions.  Hours of operation, which 
are set in any written agreement, in effect prior to July 1, 1978, can only be changed by mutual consent.  It shall also be the duty 
of the distributor to advise the dealer in writing prior to execution of the agreement the projected potential gallonage and the 
dealer shall acknowledge same in writing prior to execution of the marketing agreement that he is willing to accept same; HN4[
] (d) to engage in any acts which have the purpose, intent or effect of fixing or maintaining prices, or of forcing or 
inducing adherence to prices at which such gasoline distributor's products are to be resold by such gasoline dealers: Provided, 
that nothing herein shall be deemed to prohibit recommendation, suggestion, urging or discussion; (e) to require a gasoline dealer, at the time of entering into a marketing agreement, to assent to a release, assignment, novation, 
waiver or estoppel which would relieve any person from liability imposed by this Chapter; (f) to require or prohibit any change in management of any gasoline dealer unless such requirement or prohibition of change 
shall be for good cause, which cause shall be stated in writing by the gasoline distributor; (g) to impose standards of performance upon the gasoline dealer other than those in the marketing agreement; HN5[
] (h) to provide any term or condition in any marketing agreement, or other agreement, ancillary or collateral thereto, 
which term or condition directly or indirectly violates this Chapter; (i) after July 1, 1978, to require operation in excess of a six-day week and/or in excess of a 12-hour day if the dealer can prove it 
results in substantially lessening the profits earned in his entire operation to the extent that it is not economically feasible to 
continue said operation: Provided, however, that the provisions of this subsection shall in no way impair the obligation of 
contracts made prior to July 1, 1978: and Provided, further, that the provisions of this subsection shall not impair the writing of a 
contract for hours in excess of the hours expressed herein or to impair the right to enforce the hours contained in any contract 
until sufficient evidence is available to a dealer to exercise the rights hereinbefore provided: and Provided, further, that the 
provisions of this subsection shall not be applicable to dealers or distributors who operate a food or convenience store in 
conjunction with the retail sale of automotive gasoline and related products; (j) after July 1, 1978, to refuse to continue to deal with an automotive gasoline dealer with whom it has had a marketing 
agreement for three years unless: (1) the dealer fails to comply with conditions of such agreement or fails to act in good faith in carrying out the terms of such 
agreement, or (2) such automotive gasoline distributor's principal stockholder or principal operator dies during the term of any marketing 
agreement, in which case such agreement may be refused renewal by the heirs giving notice as provided for in this Chapter, or (3) the dealer has violated the laws of this State relative to the ownership or operation of retail businesses; (k) after July 1, 1978, to refuse to continue to deal with an automotive gasoline dealer with whom it has had a marketing 
agreement for three years if such automotive gasoline dealer satisfies the court in an action brought by the automotive gasoline 
dealer under this Section that such refusal to deal is not the product of the good faith business judgment of the automotive 
gasoline distributor. "
83,5," As we will explain, proper analysis of a void for vagueness attack requires an early inquiry into whether the proscriptions of the 
challenged statute are civil or criminal.  Although Exxon fails to discuss explicitly this fundamental distinction, the fact that its 
description is couched in criminal terms betrays an awareness that the criminal statute is more easily susceptible to a void for 
vagueness challenge.  The Georgia Act, of course, carries no criminal penalties."
83,6," Courts have also scrutinized with extreme caution laws involving sanctions deemed as serious as criminal penalties.  See, 
e.g., Alsager v. District Court of Polk County, Iowa (Juvenile Division), 406 F. Supp. 10 (D. Iowa 1975), adopted 545 F.2d 1137 
(8th Cir. 1976) (termination of parental rights).  See also Paccar v. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 573 F.2d 632 
(9th Cir. 1978) (dictum) (statutes ""prescribing penalties"" must be drafted without ambiguity). "
88,7," The record does not suggest, and defendants do not contend, that Georgia has erected a ""cohesive regulatory program"" that 
might immunize coerced anticompetitive conduct under the state action doctrine of Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 63 S. Ct. 307, 
87 L. Ed. 315 (1942). See L. Sullivan, Handbook of the Law of Antitrust 735 (1977). "
89,8," We recognize, however, that wholesalers who can obtain gasoline more cheaply than retailers may be particularly effective 
competitors in the retail market. "

tariffs on specified commodities by the Interstate Commerce Commission or the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals; or 
questions of an owner's right to reclaim his property when commingled with that of another, as when a famous artist paints a 
portrait on canvas belonging to someone else.  See Dumbauld, Thomas Jefferson and the Law (1978) 110. "

rule, disregarded it because he disagreed with it.  He admitted all declarations offered, leaving entirely to the jury the evaluation 
of their admissibility, and never at any time making a preliminary determination based on nonhearsay evidence.  Hence in 
Ziegler it was impossible to find an implied determination by the trial judge that the standard of admissibility had been met, since 
he had expressly refused to make the determination required by Geaney.  See 583 F.2d 77 at 80 at n. 5. "
99,14," The jury could well have found that Azzarelli's high bid on item 27 was pursuant to collusion (in spite of his denial) since Loitz

that item.  It is of no consequence that Azzarelli may not have known that Boettcher was to receive ""payola."" All three of the

105,1," One such example is the following from the deposition of Clary, at 253: Q. There was no doubt in your mind that Blair was a part of the business scene?A. He (sic) was making himself a part of it at 
that time.Q. Did you have any objection to that? A. I would like to see all of my competitors bow out of business.Q. You would?A. Yes. Q. You would like the entire northern California area for yourself?A. The whole world, yes. Wouldn't that be nice?Q. Have you 
always felt that way? MR. PARKINSON: Let the record show the witness is laughing at this. Counsel is taking it up as a serious matter. THE WITNESS: You ask a silly question, you get a silly answer."
105,2," The deposition testimony of a former Glen-Webb employee's wife, Nellie Duncan, is quoted repeatedly in Blair's opening brief. 
She recounts conversations which her husband, since deceased, had with Clary and with Scheetz and which he subsequently 
related to her. Admitting the hearsay character of the veiled threats by Clary and warnings by Duncan to Scheetz contained 
therein, Blair withdrew this testimony from consideration by the lower court. "
106,3," In Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting System, 368 U.S. 464, 82 S. Ct. 486, 7 L. Ed. 2d 458 (1962), the Court stated: Summary judgment should be entered only when the pleadings, depositions, affidavits, and admissions filed in the case ""show 
that . . . there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law."" 
Rule 56(c), Fed.Rules Civ.Proc., 28 U.S.C.A. This rule authorizes summary judgment ""only where the moving party is entitled to 
judgment as a matter of law, where it is quite clear what the truth is, * * * (and where) no genuine issue remains for trial * * * (for) 
the purpose of the rule is not to cut litigants off from their right of trial by jury if they really have issues to try."" Sartor v. Arkansas

106,368," U.S. at 467, 82 S. Ct. at 488. We look at the record on summary judgment in the light most favorable to Poller, the party opposing the motion, and conclude 
here that it should not have been granted. We believe that summary procedures should be used sparingly in complex antitrust 
litigation where motive and intent play leading roles, the proof is largely in the hands of the alleged conspirators, and hostile 
witnesses thicken the plot. It is only when the witnesses are present and subject to cross-examination that their credibility and 
the weight to be given their testimony can be appraised. Trial by affidavit is no substitute for trial by jury which so long has been 
the hallmark of ""even handed justice."" Id. at 473, 82 S. Ct. at 491. "
107,4," We note that, according to Glen-Webb, its share of the market was less than six percent. Although the lower court did not 
explicitly refer to this amount in its decision, it did state that Glen-Webb and Blair ""competed with some one hundred food 
service wholesalers all of whom were in the business of supplying restaurants and institutions."" "
108,5, See note 3 Supra.
108,6," Rule 56(e) of the Fed.R.Civ.P. provides in part as follows: (e) * * * When a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest 
upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleading, but his response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, must 
set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. If he does not so respond, summary judgment, if 
appropriate, shall be entered against him."
108,7," In First National Bank of Arizona v. Cities Service Co., 391 U.S. 253, 88 S. Ct. 1575, 20 L. Ed. 2d 569 (1968), the Court stated: What Rule 56(e) does make clear is that a party cannot rest on the allegations contained in his complaint in opposition to a 
properly supported summary judgment motion made against him. . . . Petitioner's position is, in effect, that he is entitled to rest 
on the allegations of conspiracy contained in his pleadings. * * * "
109,," To the extent that petitioner's burden-of-proof argument can be interpreted to suggest that Rule 56(e) should, in effect, be read 
out of antitrust cases and permit plaintiffs to get to a jury on the basis of the allegations in their complaints, coupled with a hope 
that something can be developed at trial in the way of evidence to support those allegations, we decline to accept it. While we 
recognize the importance of preserving litigants' rights to a trial on their claims, we are not prepared to extend those rights to the 
point of requiring that anyone who files an antitrust complaint setting forth a valid cause of action be entitled to a full-dress trial 
notwithstanding the absence of any significant probative evidence tending to support the complaint."

No. 1. The second filed action was brought in the name of BMI alone. See Civil Action No. 79-96, Docket No. 1."
132,3," The Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 101, et seq. (1978), was substantially amended on October 19, 1976, effective January 1, 
1978. Thus, the first filed action is governed by the Copyright Act of 1909, as amended prior to October 19, 1976, while the 
second filed action is governed by the law as amended on that date. Except as noted infra the changes enacted do not affect the 
analysis required to resolve the legal issues presented in these consolidated actions. "
133,4," The songs within BMI's repertory which plaintiffs allege were performed at the Triple Nickel on May 11, 1977 were ""Okie From 
Muskogee,"" ""Rub It In,"" ""Rocky Top,"" ""Johnny B. Goode,"" ""A Good Hearted Woman,"" and ""Before The Next Teardrop Falls."""

Be There,"" ""Before The Next Teardrop Falls,"" ""Crying Time,"" and ""The Midnight Hour."""
133,7," See Civil Action No. 79-96, Docket No. 1. "
134,8," At oral argument counsel for defendants conceded that two defenses raised earlier that defendants are not liable for any 
copyright infringement committed by performers appearing at the Triple Nickel because such performers are not employees of 
Moor-Law, and that Moor is not liable for such infringements because he does not do business personally as the Triple Nickel 
are not ""viable."" Tr. of Oral Arg. at 17-18."
134,9," Indeed, BMI is the sole and exclusive licensor of the right to perform publicly for profit the copyrighted musical compositions 
involved in these actions."
134,10," Paragraph IX(C) of the 1966 BMI consent decree provides as follows: Defendant (BMI) shall not, in connection with any offer to license by it the public performance of musical compositions by music 
users other than broadcasters, refuse to offer a license at a price or prices to be fixed by defendant with the consent of the 
copyright proprietor for the performance of such specific (i. e., per piece) musical compositions, the use of which shall be 
requested by the prospective licensee. "
135,11," The 1909 Act prohibited only unauthorized public performance for profit of musical compositions, whereas the 1976 Act 
prohibits all unauthorized public performance. The distinction is of no consequence in the context of this litigation, however, in 
light of the fact that musical compositions performed in establishments such as the Triple Nickel have traditionally been 
considered ""for profit"" whether or not admission has been charged. HN6[
] A public performance for profit may exist even though no admission fee is exacted or no profit actually made. 
Accordingly, the performance of a copyrighted musical composition in a restaurant or hotel, without charge for admission to hear 
it, infringes the exclusive right of the owner of the copyright to perform the work publicly for profit. The performance is part of a 
total for which the public pays, and the fact that the price of the whole is attributed to a particular item is not important."

136,16," As to defendants' contention that a genuine factual dispute exists as to whether the performance of plaintiffs' songs at the 
Triple Nickel may have constituted ""fair use"" and did not, therefore, infringe plaintiffs' copyrights, I need only note that 
defendants raised this contention for the first time in their brief in opposition to plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment. 
Defendants' failure to assert a fair use defense in their amended answer to plaintiffs' complaints or in an appropriate manner 
pursuant to Rule 56(e) precludes them from raising it at this late date. Certainly nothing in the present record suggests that such 
a defense is available to the defendants. "
137,17," Plaintiffs place particular reliance upon BMI v. Grant's Cabin, Inc., 204 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 633, Cause No. 77-1192C(1) (E.D.Mo.

138,19," The soundness of the Court's rationale in the K-91 case has also been questioned in light of that Court's conclusion that 
ASCAP's blanket license cannot constitute price-fixing because a potential user may ""invoke the authority of the United States 
District Court for the Southern District of New York to fix a reasonable fee whenever the applicant believes that the price 
proposed by ASCAP is unreasonable, and ASCAP has the burden of proving the price reasonable."" K-91, Inc. v. Gershwin 
Publishing Corp., supra, 372 F.2d at 4. As the Second Circuit observed in the CBS case, reasonableness is not a defense to a 
claim of price-fixing. See CBS III, supra, 562 F.2d at 138 n. 23."
138,20," The parties in K-91 agreed to the following stipulation: It would be commercially, practicably and virtually impossible for defendant and almost all other broadcasters to acquire a 
separate license for each performance broadcast over commercial stations. It would be commercially, practicably and virtually 
impossible for plaintiffs and other composers, authors and publishers to issue a separate license for each performance 
broadcast over broadcasting stations or to have their payment for such performances on the basis of each individual use. Quoted in CBS I, supra, 337 F. Supp. at 400."

(e.g. country and western) or a ""musical family"" (e.g. country and western, country-rock, folk music and bluegrass music) . . . c) 
Provide for the payment of fees based on the actual type of BMI music used by the establishment. d) which contains no 
provision for the payment of a minimum royalty regardless of whether any live music is played, and e) That contains a fee 
formula which at least attempts to reflect the use of BMI music which BMI has the right to license. Docket No. 102, at 11."

understand this to mean that they contend that BMI would have reneged on its offer if it had been accepted, thereby exposing 
itself to a contempt proceeding for violation of the consent decree. The present record does not support such a contention. 
Rather, what is intended, I believe, is that BMI's offer was illusory as a practical matter, with or without a list, and that BMI was 
aware of that fact. "

143,1," The district court's ruling on the Robinson-Patman Act claim is not being appealed to this court.  Upon due consideration of the 
refusal to deal and interference with contract claims, we agree with the district court that they are without merit. The district court correctly concluded that the validity of the refusal to deal claim depended on whether the underlying exclusive 
dealership arrangement and concomitant territorial restrictions constituted unreasonable restraints of trade.  Because we 
conclude Infra that these restrictions were not shown to be unlawful, the district court's finding that there was no illegal boycott 
was correct. Appellants' claim of tortious interference with contract or prospective business advantage is meritless because appellants 
proffered no evidence at trial to indicate that Aeromotor had knowledge of a valid contract as required by Arizona law.  See

Ed. 2d 112, 119. Notably, the FTC Act, as discussed below, has been amended to broaden investigatory power from ""corporations"" alone to 
include also ""partnerships"" and, most importantly for this case, ""persons."" Thus, if Morton Salt authorized legitimate ""official 
curiosity"" nearly thirty years ago, under the broadened consumer redress and investigatory provisions of the FTC Improvements 
Act, administrative inquiries with an articulable, specific purpose should be even simpler to permit."
154,5," .  In the words of Kenneth Culp Davis, What has happened, in broad perspective, is that regulatory agencies operating under such statutes have obtained essentially 
all the information they have sought from private parties.  The barriers to reasonable investigation vanished through Oklahoma 
Press Publishing Co. v. Walling, 327 U.S. 186, 66 S. Ct. 494, 90 L. Ed. 614, (1946).  Agencies now conduct investigations,

dark to find out whether something should be done and if so, what. K. C. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise § 4:4 at 234 (1979).  Courts have consistently followed these principles.  E. g., FTC v.

163,3," A review of this Court's prior Orders discloses that its failure to invoke collateral estoppel principles has been predicated in 
significant part on the recognition that the statutory mandates of the foregoing administrative forums differ substantially and 
materially from that of a tribunal presiding over a civil antitrust action.  See Tipler v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co., 443 F.2d 
125, 128-29 (6th Cir. 1971). It would appear from the recent decision of In the Matter of Houston Lighting and Power Co., (South 
Texas Project, Units 1 and 2), Docket Nos. 50-498A, 50-499A, (October 9, 1979), that a NRC licensing board is in complete 
agreement.  There, the licensing board refused to be bound by the antitrust findings of a United States District Court, reasoning 
in pertinent part: [Consideration] must be given to the comparability of the issues involved in the two proceedings when the application of res 
judicata or collateral estoppel is invoked.  Issues are not identical if the second action involves the application of a different legal 
standard, even though the factual setting of both proceedings may be the same.  Thus the same historical facts may be involved 
in two actions, but the legal significance of the facts may differ because different legal standards are applicable to them….  The 
instant proceeding involves a finding under § 105c(5) whether the activities under the license would create or maintain a 
situation inconsistent with the specified antitrust laws (42 U.S.C.  § 2135(c)).  Such an inquiry covers a board range of activities 
considerably beyond the scope of the ""violation"" standard of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. It is well established that in a Section 
105c proceeding, it is not necessary to show an actual violation of the antitrust laws.. . [T]here are substantial differences between the standards and issues involved in the Sherman Act, Section 1 suit based on 
restraint of trade by concerted action as alleged in the District Court litigation, when contrasted with the issues involved in this 
proceeding arising from allegations of monopolization (Sherman Act, Section 2), unfair methods of competition (FTC Act, 
Section 5), and inconsistency with underlying policies of antitrust laws (Section 105c).  Where, as here, the legal standards of 
two statutes are significantly different, the decision of issues under one statute does not give rise to collateral estoppel in the 
litigation of similar issues under a different statute. In the Matter of Houston Lighting and Power Co., supra at pp. 8-10.(footnotes omitted) "
167,1," On July 12, 1972, the presiding examiner for the FPC entered his decision on the petition of the City of Cleveland for a 
permanent interconnection with CEI.  That decision was later adopted by the FPC on January 11, 1973.  At page 16 of the initial 
decision, the administrative law judge concluded: Finally, the City's allegations that its difficulties in maintaining service to its customers are due in whole or in part to CEI's 
anticompetitive practices are not supported by the record in this consolidated proceeding.  This record indicates that the City's 
past inability to furnish reliable, dependable service on the MELP system to its own customers has been due primarily to 
incompetent management and inefficient operations… A contrary conclusion was reached by the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board of the NRC in its initial decision of January 6, 
1977 upon review of petitions for licenses to operate the Davis-Besse and Perry Nuclear Power Stations.  The confusion raised 
by the elemental conflict of the decisions of the FPC and the NRC is more surprising in light of the NRC's failure to bind itself to 
the earlier determinations of the FPC under the doctrine of collateral estoppel. Plaintiff would, nevertheless, have this Court 
follow in the footsteps of the NRC. Reviewing the opposing conclusions of the FPC and the NRC, this Court stated, at page 5 of its Order of February 15, 1978: The resolution of the issues presented to the FPC and the NRC has resulted in a spate of indecisive rulings and conflicting 
opinions.  This Court cannot defer a full and fair presentation of the evidence to the discordant and inconsistent findings of the 
FPC and the NRC.  To invoke the doctrine of collateral estoppel by adopting the conflicting administrative decisions and the 
antithetical findings of fact of the FPC and NRC would blanket these proceedings with an impenetrable stygian fog of confusion 
and doubt. This Court shall not become a party to this administrative chaos. That determination also reflects the Court's position with respect to the instant Motion and is therefore adopted herein."
167,2," In the proceedings before the Atomic Energy Licensing Board of the NRC, the City of Cleveland filed a motion on November 
20, 1975 seeking the disqualification of the law firm of Squire, Sanders & Dempsey (SS&D), counsel for CEI.  After an 
evidentiary hearing, the Board granted the motion on January 20, 1976 and disqualified SS&D from further representation of CEI 
in proceedings before the NRC.  Pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Commission, the matter was thereafter referred to a 
Special Board for review of the disqualification proceedings.  The Special Board issued its opinion on February 24, 1976 therein 
concluding that SS&D should not be disqualified.  The Licensing Board subsequently determined that the opinion of the Special 
Board was advisory only, and, choosing not to follow that opinion, the Licensing Board again disqualified SS&D. Undaunted by this double reverse, SS&D pressed an appeal to the Atomic Safety and Licensing Appeal Board.  In its decision of 
June 11, 1976, the Appeal Board concluded that the Licensing Board had proceeded improperly in conducting disqualification 
proceedings in the first instance and remanded the matter to the Special Board for a formal evidentiary hearing.  Shortly 
thereafter, on August 3, 1976, while the administrative carousel whirled merrily along, this Court, in disqualification proceedings 
simultaneously conducted in the within action, entered its Order denying the City's Motion to Disqualify SS&D.  Decelerating to 
keep time with the music, the Special Board of the NRC granted, on November 5, 1976, the motion of CEI to dismiss the 
disqualification proceedings in conformity with the Court's Order of August 3, 1976.  The City, however, still out of tempo, 
appealed the decision of the Special Board to the Appeal Board.  On March 1, 1977 the Appeal Board stopped the music 
altogether by affirming the decision of the Special Board, with the caveat that the chase could begin anew if the Court of Appeals 
for the Sixth Circuit reversed this Court's Order of August 3, 1976.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the August 3, 1976 Order in its 
opinion dated December 12, 1977, and reaffirmed that position on January 24, 1978. The matter is now, of course, a closed chapter in the NRC proceedings. In retrospect, however, this circuitous and debilitating 
administrative imbroglio resembles more a confusing misadventure than it does an orderly and efficient system of administrative 
justice imbued with sagacity and experience. The NRC disqualification proceedings demonstrated not only a misunderstanding 
of the substantive legal principles of conflict of interest, but further manifested a fundamental misinterpretation of the procedural 
rules and regulations by which administrative proceedings are to be conducted. "
168,3," The NRC's ""Congressionally mandated antitrust review"", advanced in plaintiff's motion, is authorized by the recent 
amendments to the Atomic Energy Act, 42 U.S.C.  § 2135(c) (amended December 19, 1970), Pub.L.No.91-560, 84 Stat. 1473, 
which directs the Commission to ""make a finding as to whether the activities under the license would create or maintain a 
situation inconsistent with the antitrust laws as specified in subsection (a) of this Section."" 42 U.S.C.  § 2135(c)(5).  This finding, 
which is the sole manifestation of the NRC's authority to review alleged anticompetitive activities of prospective licensees, is 
dependent in large part upon the advice of the Attorney General regarding the existence of any adverse antitrust aspects of a 
proposed license. 42 U.S.C.  § 2135(c)(5).  It may also be observed that the wording of this particular statutory provision is 
deliberately ambiguous, (e.g. ""adverse antitrust aspects"", ""a situation inconsistent with the antitrust laws""), and affords the NRC 
no authority to determine the existence of any direct violations of the Sherman and Clayton Acts. That determination rests within 
the statutory jurisdiction of the United States District Court.  15 U.S.C.  §§ 4 and 15. "

170,4," The comments of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy on the 1970 amendment of 42 U.S.C.  § 2135 are instructive in this 
regard. The concept or certainty of contravention of the antitrust laws or policies clearly underlying these laws is not intended to be 
implicit in this standard….  It is intended that, in effect, the Commission will conclude whether, in its judgment, it is reasonably 
probable that the activities under the license would, when the license is issued or thereafter, be inconsistent with any of the 
antitrust laws or the policies clearly underlying these laws. With respect to the above finding, although the words ""reasonable probability"" do not appear in the standard, the concept of 
reasonable probability is intended to be a silent partner to the factors in the standard.  The standard must be considered in the 
focus of reasonable probability -- not certainty or possibility. H.R.Rep.No.91-1470, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., reprinted in 1970 U.S.Code Cong. & Ad. News 4981, 4994, 5011. "
171,5," This Court's Order of February 6, 1978, which held that depositions taken in the NRC proceeding may be used in the same 
manner and to the same extent as if they had been taken in this action, presents no insurmountable problems.  If counsel for the 
City finds it necessary to refer to the NRC proceeding in laying a proper foundation for the use of such a deposition, a side bar 
conference will be appropriate. "

184,19," .  Indeed, plaintiffs have advanced no rationale as to why competing distributors would combine in order to lower prices for 
retail accounts.  Such a combination is counter-intuitive.  The more likely object of a combination among distributors would be to 
withstand demands by large accounts for lower prices. Compounding the failure to explain the motivation for the purported combination to lower retail prices, plaintiffs inconsistently 
assert the existence of a distributors' scheme to maintain retail prices.  Compare Plaintiffs' Memorandum pp. 36-7, which allege 
low selling practices with pp. 48-50, which allege price maintenance. Plaintiffs' only reference to the required showing of motivation is a single sentence which reads ""The reward of group conspiracy, 
the raising of list and cost prices, the ease of early market penetration with albums, but with extensive returns allowed to the 
favored chains, the control of entry into distribution provided the motivation."" This conclusory allegation, hardly amounts to a showing of motivation and is without support in the record. "
185,20," .  Section 2 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 730 (1914)-later amended by the Robinson-Patman Act-which made price and 
promotional discriminations unlawful under certain circumstances was enacted because the Sherman Act did not proscribe such

and did not ship $ 19,604.00."" These are also the figures referred to in plaintiffs' trial memorandum.  While plaintiffs' testimony and exhibits at trial could be

209,1," The trial court gave Guild's instruction No. 37: ""Under the facts of this case any restrictions and limitations on territories or on 
customers imposed by Guild on its distributors would not constitute a violation of the antitrust laws entitling Mr. Sosnick to 
recover unless the acts were taken by Guild not as a producer or manufacturer interested in the distribution of its product, but 
rather were taken to enforce an agreement or conspiracy among the competing independent wholesalers of its product to divide 
the territories and customers between themselves. ""If you find that such an agreement existed, that is an agreement between the independent wholesalers to divide the market and 
to allocate the customers and that Guild, in terminating Sosnick, knowingly joined and acted as a party or acted in furtherance of 
that agreement, then you must find in favor of Sosnick and against Guild on this issue."" "
210,2," The court also gave Guild's instruction No. 36: ""I instruct you that if Guild, provided it was acting alone and not pursuant to an 
unlawful conspiracy asked Sosnick to cease dealing with Lucky Stores because it wanted to service Lucky Stores and then 
terminated Sosnick because he refused, an antitrust violation could not be established for that termination."""
210,3," Sosnick's proposed instructions Nos. 17 and 19 stated: ""A seller of goods has a legal right to announce to his customers that 
he has established a policy prohibiting such customers from reselling the goods to a specified person or persons, and to refuse 
to deal with any customer who does not follow the policy.  But it is illegal for the seller to take affirmative action, such as 
threatening to stop selling to his customer, to enforce his policy.  Furthermore, the law imposes two important limitations on this 
right: ""First, if a seller announces to his customer a policy which -- if accepted by the customer -- would result in an illegal horizontal 
customer allocation agreement, it is illegal for the seller to go beyond a mere announcement of the policy and use other means -
- such as threats of termination if the customer refuses to comply -- which effect adherence to the policy. ""Second, it is illegal for the seller to refuse to deal with a customer, if the refusal is made pursuant to an illegal combination or 
conspiracy."" (Inst. No. 17.) ""If a supplier (such as Guild) having an ongoing business relationship with a distributor (such as Sosnick) requests the distributor 
to enter into an agreement which would violate the Cartwright Act; if the distributor refuses to enter into the proposed illegal 
agreement; if the supplier exerts pressure upon the distributor to accept the illegal agreement; and if the supplier terminates the 
distributor because of the distributor's refusal to accept, then the termination itself is in violation of the Cartwright Act."" (Inst. No. 
19.) "
214,1," A nonprice distribution restraint restricts competition among wholesale or retail distributors by, e.g., forbidding distributors from 
selling from any but a designated location, assigning exclusive territories to distributors, reserving certain customers to the 
manufacturer, forbidding wholesale distributors from selling to other than authorized retail outlets, or forbidding distributors from 
selling to other distributors. (See Posner, The Rule of Reason and the Economic Approach: Reflections on the Sylvania Decision 
(1977) 45 U.Chi.L.Rev.  1.)"
214,2," A location restriction limits a distributor's sales of a manufacturer's product to certain authorized outlets.  The manufacturer 
does not assign specific territories, but as a practical matter the size of each distributor's market will be controlled and limited by 
the number of authorized outlets.  (Note, Antitrust Treatment of Intrabrand Territorial Restraints Within a Dual Distribution 
System (1978) 56 Texas L.Rev. 1486, 1487 fn. 8.) "
215,3," The classic statement of the rule of reason is that of Mr. Justice Brandeis in Chicago Board of Trade v. United States (1918) 
246 U.S.  231, 238 [62 L.Ed. 683, 687, 38 S.Ct. 242]: ""The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely 
regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition.  To 
determine that question the court must ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its 
condition before and after the restraint was imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable.  The history of 
the restraint, the evil believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, 
are all relevant facts.  This is not because a good intention will save an otherwise objectionable regulation or the reverse; but 
because knowledge of intent may help the court to interpret facts and to predict consequences."" "
216,4," A manufacturer employing a dual distribution system markets a product through two separate and competitive channels.  The 
manufacturer supplies independent retailers either directly or through its wholly-owned branch distributors. It also supplies the 
product to independent distributors who resell to retailers. Consequently, the manufacturer, whether or not vertically integrated, "
217,," faces competition on two market levels.  On the production level, it competes interbrand with other manufacturers of the same 
generic product; on the distribution level, it competes intrabrand with the independent distributors of its own brand."" (Note,

237,2," Norton Packaging owned more than 75% Of First Beverages' outstanding stock. Norton Packaging was owned and managed 
by Will Norton."
237,3," The trial court gave the following rule of reason instruction: In determining whether or not a particular restraint is reasonable or unreasonable and therefore that it is or is not a violation of 
the antitrust laws, you may consider: First: The nature of the particular industry involved; Second: Facts which are peculiar to the business in which the restraint is applied; Third: The nature of the restraint and its effect, actual and probable, upon soft drink bottlers and upon consumers; Fourth: The history of the restraint; and Fifth: The reasons for adopting the practice."
237,4," The judgment was amended several times in January and July of 1977. The amendments made provision for the award of 
costs and attorney's fees to Royal Crown."
237,5, Appellants requested that the following Per se instruction be given: 
238,," There are certain agreements or practices which because of their pernicious effect on competition and lack of any redeeming 
virtue are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and therefore illegal without elaborate inquiry as to the precise harm they 
have caused or the business excuses for their use. Such agreements or practices are termed per se unreasonable, and are not 
to be tolerated even if they are well intended or because they are allegedly developed to increase competition. A vertical territorial restraint is a restraint imposed by a manufacturer as a condition of doing business with a dealer or distributor. 
A vertical territorial restraint is a per se violation of § 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act where a manufacturer of a product, which 
manufacturer is neither a new entrant in the business nor a failing company, sells its product to its dealer or distributor and 
thereafter, by agreement with the dealer, prohibits the dealer from selling to persons located outside of a specifically designated 
territory. The rule that a vertical territorial restraint is per se unreasonable does not apply in the situation where the manufacturer 
delivers his products to a dealer whose position and function are, in fact, indistinguishable from those of an agent or salesman of 
the manufacturer and the manufacturer completely retains all indicia of ownership including title, dominion, and risk. The instruction concludes with a direction that the jury find that the Royal Crown franchise agreement Per se violated § 1."
238,6," One explanation for the district court's refusal to give a Per se instruction may be found in our decision in GTE Sylvania Inc. v. 
Continental T. V., Inc., 537 F.2d 980 (9th Cir. 1976). There, we distinguished Schwinn on several grounds: the nature of the 
restrictions involved, their effect upon competition and the market shares of the parties imposing the restrictions. See 
Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S. 36 at 41, 97 S. Ct. 2549, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568. At the time of the trial in this case, the rationale of our GTE Sylvania decision had not yet been rejected by the Supreme Court. 
The district court therefore ordered the parties to submit memoranda likening the case before it to either Schwinn or our GTE 
Sylvania. Based upon these memoranda and the record before it, the court adopted the rule of reason as the appropriate 
yardstick by which to measure Royal Crown's conduct. The Supreme Court reviewed our GTE Sylvania decision after judgment had been entered in this case. While rejecting our 
distinction, it affirmed our judgment that the GTE Sylvania restrictions could not be analyzed under the Per se rule. As we point 
out in this opinion, the Supreme Court also effectively ratified the district court's decision to apply the rule of reason in this case. "
239,7," That restriction was described in GTE Sylvania as follows: ""Each distributor had a defined geographic area in which it had the 
exclusive right to supply franchised retailers."" 433 U.S. at 42, 97 S. Ct. at 2553. This restriction is one of many involved in 
Schwinn. See 433 U.S. 36 at 42-43, 97 S. Ct. 2549, 53 L.Ed.2d 568; United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co., 388 U.S. 365 at 
370-71, 87 S. Ct. 1856, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1249."
239,8," The Supreme Court and this court indicated before the trial in this case that HN2[
] both interbrand and intrabrand 
competition must be considered under the antitrust laws. See, e. g., White Motor Co. v. United States, 372 U.S. 253 at 268-70, 
83 S. Ct. 696, 9 L. Ed. 2d 738 (Brennan, J., concurring); United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co., 388 U.S. 365 at 369-70, 379-
82, 87 S. Ct. 1856, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1249; GTE Sylvania Inc. v. Continental T. V., Inc., 537 F.2d at 1000-01. Appellants also apparently recognized that both interbrand and intrabrand competition and their relationship should be 
considered. During their opening statement, H & M and Mae-Con indicated that they would present evidence that the restriction 
involved had anticompetitive effects on both interbrand and intrabrand competition. Royal Crown also addressed this issue in its "
240,," opening statement. Moreover, evidence concerning the effects of the restriction here challenged on both interbrand and 
intrabrand competition was presented at trial. Therefore, we reject appellants' contention that they were not aware of the importance of both interbrand and intrabrand 
competition prior to the Supreme Court's discussion of them in GTE Sylvania."
240,9," The Chicago Board of Trade formulation cited by the Supreme Court reads as follows: The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition 
or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition. To determine that question the court must ordinarily consider 
the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and after the restraint was imposed; the 
nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable. The history of the restraint, the evil believed to exist, the reason for 
adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, are all relevant facts. This is not because a good 
intention will save an otherwise objectionable regulation or the reverse; but because knowledge of intent may help the court to 
interpret facts and to predict consequences."
240,246," U.S. at 238, 38 S. Ct. at 244. "
241,10," Of course, even if the FTC had adopted a new rule of law or changed existing law, we would not be bound by the new FTC 
rule."
241,11, We express no opinion on the merits of such a motion. 
242,12," Appellants argue that the jury might have considered the evidence on the question of the reasonableness of the franchise 
restraint. In this argument, they rely heavily on Royal Crown's pretrial statement that such evidence would be relevant on the 
question of reasonableness as well as on damages issues. We reject this position. Royal Crown's pretrial argument was intended to convince the court that the ""gypsy"" trucking evidence 
should be admitted for more than just the issue of damages. The court rejected Royal Crown's argument and expressly limited 
such evidence to that issue. Therefore, appellants' reliance on Royal Crown's pretrial and pre-ruling statements is misplaced. The district court clearly limited the jury's consideration of the illegal shipping arrangement to the issue of damages, and used an 
instruction proposed by appellants in doing so. "
244,13," In support of this contention, appellants rely on two statements to the jury. The first was made by counsel for Royal Crown in 
closing argument: We are only asking for nominal damages just to emphasize the point, and his Honor will advise you, we have limited our request 
to $ 500 per party, and his Honor will instruct you that is the maximum that can be awarded. The other statement appellants rely on is one of the court's instructions to the jury. Here, however, Royal Crown Cola Company seeks only nominal damages or $ 500 from the plaintiffs. Even if you find that Royal 
Crown Cola Company's damages are more than $ 500, you may not award a greater amount. "
249,1," .  See, e.g.  United States v. Sealy, Inc., 388 U.S. 350, 87 S. Ct. 1847, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1238 (1967) (""Sealy""); Ohio-Sealy Mattress 
Mfg. Co. v. Sealy, Inc., 585 F.2d 821 (7th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 930, 99 S. Ct. 1267, 59 L. Ed. 2d 486 (1979), on 
remand to the district court for consideration of equitable relief, Civil Action No. 71 C 1243 (N.D.Ill.) (""Ohio-Sealy""); Ohio-Sealy v. 
Kaplan, Civil Action No. 76 C 810 (N.D.Ill.)."
249,2," .  The defendant Sealy is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Chicago, Illinois.  It is the owner of 
certain trademarks under which Sealy bedding is sold, and licenses the use of those trademarks by various companies.  The "
250,," licensees of Sealy twelve in number own more than 90 percent of the Sealy shares.  As a licensor, Sealy provides national 
advertising for Sealy products as well as other services functions, such as product specifications, quality control, research and 
development, and marketing plans.  In return, Sealy receives royalties from the licensees based on the licensees' total sales.  In 
addition, Sealy itself in recent years has become involved in the sale and manufacture of Sealy bedding through a number of 
wholly-owned subsidiaries."
250,3," .  Ohio-Sealy, the plaintiff herein, is an Ohio corporation with its principal place of business in Ohio.  Ohio is one of the largest 
Sealy licensees, as it has five wholly-owned subsidiaries and primary responsibility for the territories composed of six states, the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the American Virgin Islands.  Ohio is also one of the best Sealy subsidiaries, in that it 
produces a consistently high-quality product, markets it effectively, and turns a better profit on its operations than either the 
defendant or the other licensees."
250,4," .  Portland, also a licensee of Sealy, is an Oregon corporation with its principal place of business in Portland, Oregon.  Its 
primary sales area consists of Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington."
250,5," .  By a separate order, the Court has granted Ohio's motion for leave to file a Supplemental Complaint."
250,6," .  Jurisdiction of the antitrust claims is conferred upon this Court by Section 4 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 4, and Sections 4 
and 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 15, 26.  Jurisdiction of the state law claims is premised on the diversity statute, 28 
U.S.C. § 1332."
250,7," .  Ohio-Sealy v. Kaplan, Civil Action No. 76 C 810 (N.D.Ill.)."
250,8," .  During these proceedings, Ohio called five witnesses to testify and introduced into evidence 73 exhibits.  Sealy offered 
testimony of six witnesses and placed 10 exhibits into evidence. "
251,9," .  Leave was granted upon the oral motion of counsel who represented Portland.  The document filed, however, was by a 
different attorney on behalf of the stockholders of Portland.  Counsel then reappeared on behalf of Portland, the corporate entity, 
and requested to withdraw Portland's intervention.  The magistrate declined to dismiss the corporate entity pending clear 
identification of all the Portland stockholders, so as to insure that all parties necessary to effect any possible relief were present.  
The Court agrees with the magistrate's action.  Since no further identification of the Portland stockholders has been offered, both 
Portland and its stockholders remain as intervening parties on this motion for preliminary injunction."
251,10," .  Portland objected to this extension by a motion filed December 28, 1979.  Since this extension was made pursuant to a 
contractual provision in the purchase agreement, however, the Court finds no basis for Portland's objection."
251,11," .  The magistrate did find, however, that an extended delay of the closing date for purchase the unavoidable effect of the 
injunctive relief requested herein would cause irreparable harm to Portland, ""at least in the sense that Portland may have no 
legal recourse."" Although the magistrate found that Portland could operate during a delay in the closing without a significant loss 
of business, he concluded that uncertainty as to Portland's ultimate purchaser would have a deleterious impact on the morale of 
Portland's employees and the company's operations."
251,12," .  After the jury verdict in Ohio-Sealy, the trial judge found that Ohio was entitled to no equitable relief whatsoever.  The 
Seventh Circuit reversed this ruling, and remanded the case to the district court for reconsideration of the appropriate equitable 
relief.  Ohio-Sealy v. Sealy, Civil Case No. 71 C 1243 (N.D.Ill.), on remand from 585 F.2d 821 (7th Cir. 1978)."
251,13," .  In addition to the parties that appeared before the magistrate, the Court granted leave to the Sealy Mattress Company of 
Michigan (""Michigan"") to file an amicus brief.  Michigan, a Sealy licensee, is a party defendant in Ohio-Sealy v. Kaplan, Civil 
Action No. 76 C 810 (N.D.Ill.).  In that action, Michigan also has filed a cross-claim against Sealy, alleging that Sealy's exercise 
of the right of first refusal against Michigan in April, 1978, violated the antitrust laws. "
252,14," .  See e.g.  John B. Hull, Inc. v. Waterbury Petroleum Products, Inc., 588 F.2d 24, 27 (2d Cir. 1978); Sonesta International 
Hotels Corp. v. Wellington Associates, 483 F.2d 247, 250 (2d Cir. 1973). Recent decisions in the Second Circuit, however, 
suggest that closer adherence to the irreparable injury standard is now required.  See Jack Kahn Music Co., Inc. v. Baldwin 
Piano & Organ Company, 604 F.2d 755, 758 (2d Cir. 1979); Jackson Dairy, Inc. v. H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc., 596 F.2d 70, 72 (2d 
Cir. 1979)."
252,15," .  Indeed, the Seventh Circuit rule is just the opposite.  Where there is a strong showing of irreparable harm, the movant may 
be held to a lesser standard of proving likelihood of success on the merits.  Fox Valley, 545 F.2d at 1098; Mullis v. Arco 
Petroleum Corp., 502 F.2d 290, 293 (7th Cir. 1974)."
252,16," .  The only exception to this general rule is when the Court, invoking the authority granted by Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(a)(2), orders that 
the trial on the merits of the action be advanced and consolidated with the hearing on the motion for preliminary injunctive relief. 
Rule 65(a)(2) was not utilized in this proceeding."
252,17," .  As Voltaire observed in Candide, anything is ""possible."" "
253,18," .  An APR is a specific geographic area which the licensing agreement assigns to each Sealy licensee. Within this area, the 
designated licensee maintains responsibility for satisfactory sales performance.  Licensees also are permitted to make sales 
outside of their APRs, but such sales have been conditioned upon certain payments which will be discussed more fully infra."
253,19," .  In none of the cases cited by Ohio, in which the damages were found to be incalculable, did there exist such comparative 
data from which inferential estimates of damages could be made. "
255,20," .   Ohio-Sealy, 585 F.2d at 845 n. 34. Moreover, the Court in passing notes that Ohio's concern about the availability of undoing 
the purchase of Portland assumes that liability will be found only on the antitrust claims.  Although the Court at this time 
expresses no view on the merits of Ohio's common law claims, see note 26, infra, the Court does observe that if Ohio should 
prevail on these theories, the Court's broad equitable powers could be used to fashion a remedy which includes the relief that 
Ohio seeks."
255,21," .  This is not a situation in which the Court is viewing a completed transaction retrospectively and considering the appropriate 
after-the-fact remedial measures.  Rather, this case presents a prospective sale, thus permitting the Court far greater latitude in 
ensuring that the sale does not preclude the availability of certain remedies to Ohio.  Accordingly, the Court considers the debate 
concerning the availability of divestiture in private antitrust litigation to be inapplicable to the facts herein."
255,22," .  Ohio, on the other hand, argues that if an injunction is denied, the hold-separate order should provide unconditionally for 
divestiture of the Portland purchase and resale to Ohio should Ohio prevail on the merits.  At this stage of the proceedings, 
however, it cannot be said with certainty that if Ohio's case is meritorious it will be entitled to purchase Portland.  For now, it is 
sufficient that the possibility of such a purchase is preserved by the hold-separate order."
255,23," .  Nor can the harm to Portland provide a basis for finding irreparable harm in this case.  The Court agrees with the magistrate's 
finding that Portland will be harmed in some measure by uncertainty as to its ultimate owner.  This harm, however, cannot be 
prevented by the granting of a preliminary injunction. All that such an injunction would accomplish is the delay of the closing 
date.  Portland still would not have the certainty it needs.  That can only be provided by a conclusive determination as to which 
party, Ohio or Sealy, is entitled to own Portland.  Unfortunate though it may be for Portland, this determination can only be made 
after a full determination of the merits."
255,24," .  Indeed, were a hold-separate order providing for possible resale to Ohio not a realistic option in this case, the Court would 
have to reevaluate its conclusion that Ohio would not suffer irreparable harm if the sale is not enjoined. "
256,25," .  Such a price would take for its baseline the purchase price paid by Sealy at the January 31, 1980, closing of its acquisition of 
Portland.  At the conclusion of the litigation, the resale price of Portland to Ohio would be adjusted to take into account inflation 
as well as interest Sealy could have earned on the money paid for Portland since a decision for Ohio surely would entitle it to the 
profits made by Portland while under Sealy ownership during the pendency of the litigation.  Should the parties be unable to 
agree on this adjusted resale price, the Court would resolve the disagreement."
256,26," .  The magistrate found that Ohio also would prevail on its Section 7 claim, but was unlikely to do so on its state law claims.  
This Court's conclusion that Ohio is likely to prevail on its Section 1 claim makes it unnecessary to reach the other potential 
bases for liability. "
257,27," .  HN12[
] Horizontal territorial restraints arise out of decisions by competitors, or potential competitors, to restrict competition 
inter sese by dividing the geographic market into exclusive enclaves.  Vertical territorial restraints, on the other hand, involve a 
decision by one competitor to impose territorial limitations on independent dealers as a condition of their right to sell that 
competitor's product.  In Sealy, the Supreme Court found that Sealy's territorial allocations fell into the former category: The territorial arrangements must be regarded as the creature of horizontal action by the licensees. It would violate reality to 
treat them as equivalent to territorial limitations imposed by a manufacturer upon independent dealers as incident to the sale of a 
trademarked product.  Sealy, Inc., is an instrumentality of the licensees for purposes of the horizontal territorial allocation.  It is 
not the principal."
257,388," U.S. at 354, 87 S. Ct. at 1851."
257,28," .  The jury in Ohio-Sealy returned a verdict of $ 6,814,852 against Sealy.  This amount was trebled pursuant to the antitrust 
laws, 15 U.S.C. § 15, to reach the total of $ 20,444,556 in damages.  Ohio then accepted a remittitur of 50 percent of these 
treble damages, thereby making the final award of $ 10,222,278."
257,29," .  At the time of the Supreme Court decision in 1967, Sealy itself neither manufactured nor sold bedding. Thereafter, Sealy 
began to enter this aspect of the business through the purchases of licensees. By the time of the Seventh Circuit opinion, 
Sealy's market share of bedding had reached approximately 27 percent of all Sealy products sold. "
258,30," .  The evidence presented before the magistrate showed that although Ohio accounts for less than 20 percent of all Sealy-label 
sales in the continental United States, it makes approximately 55 percent of all the out-of-APR sales in the Sealy organization.  
In 1978, 13.1 percent of its total sales were made out of its APRs, a significant increase from the 4.9 percent total registered in 
1974."
258,31," .  At trial, Sealy had argued that its acquisition of licensees was spurred by the 1967 Supreme Court opinion, and represented 
an effort to reconstitute the Sealy manufacturing and sales function as a vertical structure."
258,32," .  It should be emphasized that pending the ruling on the equitable issues in Ohio-Sealy v. Sealy, Civil Case No. 71 C 1243 
(N.D.Ill.), these modifications, with the exception of the new board of directors, offered by Sealy are not binding.  Thus, while 
they are relevant factors in determining the intent of Sealy vis-a-vis Ohio, they cannot yet be considered as permanent changes 
in Sealy's practices."
258,33," .  See HN14[
] Fed.R.Ev. 404(b), which states that while evidence of past acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith, it may be used for other purposes, such as to prove intent.  
Although there is a fine line between the forbidden and the permissible use of prior acts evidence, the Court believes that a jury, 
properly instructed, can use such evidence properly. "
259,34," .  Sealy suggests that it decided to purchase Portland because at the price offered it represented a sound business investment.  
In addition, the decision allegedly was influenced by the fact that Sealy licenses are perpetual; thus, the only way to extinguish 
the license is for Sealy to acquire it."
259,35," .  Until 1978, Sealy had exercised its right of first refusal exclusively against Ohio.  Since that time, Sealy has exercised its right 
of first refusal to prevent a purchase by Michigan.  With that sole exception, Sealy has invoked its right of first refusal against no 
prospective purchaser other than Ohio."
259,36," .  As matters now stand, Ohio's closest plant to the West Coast is in Fort Worth, Texas, more than 1,000 miles away.  Sealy, on 
the other hand, owns the five most westernly-located plants in the Sealy organization.  Because of the bulk and weight of 
bedding products, the high cost of transportation, the reluctance of retailers to warehouse bedding products, and the need for 
customer sales calls, the bedding industry is highly localized.  Rarely can a company serve areas more than 200-300 miles from 
its plant. As a result, Ohio is unable to make sales in the western APRs from any of its present locations."
259,37," .  In August, 1976, Ohio sought approval to build a plant in Las Vegas, Nevada, or elsewhere in the western United States.  
This request was denied by the Sealy board of directors in March, 1977.  Ohio renewed its request in April and May of 1977.  In 
September, 1978, the board which already had been restructured so as to be ""independent"" from the licensees once again 
denied the request."
259,38," .  Sealy also asserts that the restructuring of the board of directors has rendered the corporate entity vertical rather than 
horizontal. As observed by the Seventh Circuit in Ohio-Sealy, however, HN15[
] the key factor in determining whether to treat 
this as a horizontal or vertical market allocation case is whether the alleged allocation is the result of concerted action by 
licensees against a horizontal potential competitor. 585 F.2d at 827. Thus, it cannot be said as a matter of law that the 
reconstituted board of directors eliminates the horizontal nature of the alleged market allocation.  Rather, the critical question will 
involve the actual degree of independence of the directors from the licensees. As indicated above, there is strong reason to 
question the independence of the directors.  For this reason, the Court believes it reasonably likely that Ohio will be able to show 
that the alleged market allocation is horizontal in nature, notwithstanding the installation of the new directors. "
260,39," .  The magistrate's recommendation that the purchase be enjoined stemmed from his view that it would be prudent to wait for a 
ruling on the equitable issues in the remand of Ohio-Sealy v. Sealy, Inc.; and if no decision was forthcoming by April 30, 1980, to 
deny preliminary relief to Ohio and allow Sealy to close the purchase.  Given the finding that there is no irreparable harm that will 
result from the denial of injunctive relief, the Court believes it would be inappropriate to enjoin the purchase.  Moreover, issuance 
of a hold-separate order will serve the function usually performed by injunctive relief. In this case, it will ensure that Ohio is not 
deprived the right to undo the transaction if it prevails on the merits and the Court finds no legal impediment to resale to Ohio.  In 
this sense at least, the hold-separate order will preserve the status quo pending the outcome of this litigation."
260,40," .  The Court will retain jurisdiction over Sealy's operation of Portland to ensure compliance with the provisions of the hold-
separate order."
260,41," .  It is clear from this opinion that the Court does not consider the possible unavailability of divestiture in private antitrust 
litigation to constitute a bar to resale of Portland to Ohio after trial.  If Ohio prevails on the merits, the question will not be 
whether Sealy may be compelled to sell Portland, but rather, whether Ohio's purchase of Portland would be illegal itself.  The 
record reflects no such illegality; nor does the Court at this time foresee any problems with a sale of Portland to Ohio.  The 
Court, however, expresses no final conclusion as to this issue.  The parties are not foreclosed from raising claims of illegality at 
a later time in these or other proceedings. "

Commission.  (42 U.S.C. §§ 7151, 7172, 7341; Exec. Order No. 12009, 42 Fed. Reg. 46267 (Sept. 13, 1977), 42 U.S.C.A. §

288,3," A proceeding against PG&E culminated in an order of the San Francisco Superior Court filed November 22, 1976, which 
enforced most of the terms of the subpena and is now final.  ARCO did not respond to its subpena. Instead it obtained from the 
United States District Court, Central District of California, an injunction against enforcement that is still on appeal.  See post, 
footnote 8.  The ARCO proceeding is discussed below in connection with defendants' contention that the present proceedings 
are barred by collateral estoppel."
288,4," Federal cases interpreting the Sherman Act generally apply to construction of the Cartwright Act.  ( Mailand v. Burckle (1978) 
20 Cal.3d 367, 376 [143 Cal. Rptr. 1, 572 P.2d 1142]; Marin County Bd. of Realtors, Inc. v. Palsson (1976) 16 Cal.3d 920, 925 
[130 Cal. Rptr. 1, 549 P.2d 833]; Corwin v. Los Angeles Newspaper Service Bureau, Inc. (1971) 4 Cal.3d 842, 852-853 [94 Cal. 
Rptr. 785, 484 P.2d 953].) "
289,5," Cases cited as examples of conflict between state and federal antitrust laws involve statutory differences not present here: 
Connell Co. v. Plumbers & Steamfitters (1975) 421 U.S. 616 [44 L. Ed. 2d 418, 95 S. Ct. 1830] (though federal antitrust law 
applies to contractor's collective bargaining agreement to subcontract only with firms recognizing union, Texas law does not 
apply because, unlike federal law, it conflicts with federal policies favoring employee organization); cf.  Shell Oil Co. v. Younger 
(9th Cir. 1978) 587 F.2d 34 ( Bus. & Prof. Code, § 21200, prohibiting motor-fuel price discrimination, not preempted by Sherman 
or Robinson-Patman acts even though it provides a ""meeting competition"" defense that is narrower than 15 U.S.C. § 13(b) 
(Robinson-Patman))."
289,6," In questioning the relevance of those concerns to an investigation designed to uncover violations of state antitrust law, the 
dissenting opinion (post, at p. 419) appears to lose sight of (1) the overlap and consequent necessity for coordination of state 
and federal antitrust enforcement, and (2) the Attorney General's right, on discovering possible violations, not only to invoke 
existing remedies but also to recommend to legislators and administrators improvement of those remedies or creation of 
alternate remedies. "
291,7," Defendants rely on Standard Radio & Television Co. v. Chronicle Pub. Co. (1960) 182 Cal. App. 2d 293 [6 Cal. Rptr. 246], 
which barred a Cartwright Act suit that attacked ""exclusivity"" clauses through which contracts for film distribution to defendant 
television stations forbade marketing of the same films to other stations, including plaintiff's, within a 60-mile radius.  The Court 
of Appeal concluded that the suit was foreclosed by the FCC's power over such arrangements in connection with its aims to 
optimize use of broadcast channels (182 Cal. App. 2d at pp. 298-300; see Nat. Broadcasting Co. v. U.S. (1943) 319 U.S. 190, 
200-201, 214-220, 222-224 [87 L. Ed. 1344, 1354-1355, 1361-1367, 63 S. Ct. 997]), even though such power would not 
foreclose a suit to enforce federal antitrust laws (182 Cal. App. 2d at pp. 300-301). That case preceded decisions that limited the preemptive effect of the Federal Communications Act ( Head v. New Mexico 
Board of Examiners in Optometry (1963) 374 U.S. 424 [10 L. Ed. 2d 983, 83 S. Ct. 1759]; see O'Neil, Television, Tort Law, and 
Federalism (1965) 53 Cal. L. Rev. 421, 456-460) and that curtailed federal statutes' preemptive effect on state proceedings 
peripheral to these statutes' central concerns ( De Canas v. Bica, supra, 424 U.S. 351; Farmer v. United Brotherhood of 
Carpenters, supra, 430 U.S. 290). (See too Note, Federal Preemption in Television Antitrust (1961) 13 Stan.L. Rev. 629) 
(criticizing Standard Radio even under precedents then available.) Standard Radio is disapproved insofar as it holds that a 
federal regulatory scheme which does not expressly restrict the states and allows enforcement of federal antitrust laws 
nonetheless may preclude state antitrust enforcement consistent with those laws. "
292,8," See footnote 3, ante.  ARCO was granted a temporary restraining order on June 14, 1976, a preliminary injunction on 
September 29, 1977, and a summary judgment incorporating a permanent injunction on June 26, 1978.  (Lewis and Atlantic 
Richfield Co. v. Younger et al., (C.D. Cal.) Dock. No. CV 76-1890-FW.) Appeal is pending in the Ninth Circuit."
292,9," The factual distinction discussed in the dissenting opinion (post, at pp. 419-420) does not undercut the applicability here of the 
quoted words.  Though asserted by the FPC the distinction was rejected by the court of appeals, which said: ""In our former 
opinion we fully adjudicated and decided the same issue recurring now under equivalent circumstances that the Commission 
lacks jurisdiction to regulate gas produced, sold, and consumed intrastate, which is transported in a pipeline commingled with 
interstate gas and that decision as between these parties bars resurrection of the issue again."" (334 F.2d at p. 412.) When reversing, the Supreme Court majority gave no weight to the asserted distinction and indicated no disagreement with the 
court of appeals' conclusion that its former opinion ""decided the same issue recurring now under equivalent circumstances."" The 
concurring opinion footnote (379 U.S. at p. 691 [13 L. Ed. 2d at p. 608]), quoted in the dissent here (post., p. 420, fn. 8), declared 
that the factual changes ""standing alone, makes inapplicable any doctrine of collateral estoppel"" (italics added) but did not 
disagree with the majority's broader statement, quoted in our text above, that the doctrine ""has no place here"" (379 U.S. at p. 
690). "
293,1," The Exxon subpena was actually served on Exxon Company, U.S.A., one of Exxon's operating divisions, but Exxon itself 
responded."
293,2," It does not appear from the record whether other parties as well were served with subpoenas in connection with the 
investigation. "
294,3," The operative provisions of the federal judgment, of which we may take judicial notice ( Evid. Code, §§ 452, subd. (d); 459), are 
as follows: ""It Is Ordered, Adjudged and Decreed that Defendants' Investigation of Ownership, Production, Sale and Distribution 
of Prudhoe Bay, Alaska Natural Gas and Defendants' Subpoena directed to Plaintiffs to Attend, Testify and to Produce Books, 
Records, Papers and Documents are unconstitutional.  [para. ] It Is Further Ordered, Adjudged and Decreed that Defendants, 
and each of them, and all persons acting under them or in concert with them, be, and hereby are, permanently enjoined and 
restrained from conducting an Investigation of Plaintiff Company's Ownership, Production, Sale and Distribution of Prudhoe Bay, 
Alaska Natural Gas and enforcing the Subpoena to Attend, Testify and to Produce Books, Records, Papers and Documents 
directed to Plaintiffs Howard H. Lewis and Atlantic Richfield Company."" (Italics added.) In its memorandum of decision, filed concurrently with the judgment, the court indicated that its injunction was to be made 
permanent ""[because] of the potential for serious harm such an investigation would have on the federal regulatory scheme."" It 
also stated: ""Generally [federal] courts will not enjoin the enforcement of state criminal statutes.  'But this is not an absolute 
policy and in some circumstances injunctive relief may be appropriate.' Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705, 712 (1977). Such a 
situation exists in this case; the rule applies to civil cases."""
294,4," In the words of an influential commentary on the subject, ""[collateral] estoppel is that aspect of res judicata concerned with the 
effect of a final judgment on subsequent litigation of a different cause of action involving some of the same issues determined in 
the initial action."" (Note, Developments in the Law: Res Judicata (1952) 65 Harv. L. Rev.  818, 840, fn. omitted.) "
295,5," ""A federal court judgment has the same effect in the courts of this state as it would in a federal court.  [Citations.] The federal 
rule is that a judgment or order, once rendered, is final for purposes of res judicata until reversed on appeal or modified or set 
aside in the court of rendition.  ( Stoll v. Gottlieb, supra, 305 U.S. 165, 170 . . . .)"" ( Martin v. Martin, supra, 2 Cal.3d 752, 761-
762, fn.  omitted.) "
296,6," The reply brief urges in addition that the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Act does not preempt the subject investigation and 
that the investigation involves no violation of the commerce clause, the due process clause, or Fourth Amendment search and 
seizure protections."
296,7," As indicated above, the Attorney General's delegation of authority to investigate pursuant to Government Code section 11182 
authorizes the delegates ""to conduct an investigation into the ownership, production, sale and distribution of Prudhoe Bay, 
Alaska, natural gas insofar as it affects the state of California, to determine the existence, nature, and scope of violations of the 
federal and state antitrust laws pertaining to price fixing, monopolization, division of markets, and restraint of trade, and to hold 
hearings, issue subpoenas inspect books and records, take testimony, hear complaints, and administer oaths in connection 
therewith, as [the delegates] deem necessary."" The Attorney General has at no time suggested that the instant investigation is 
directed toward the development of an informational basis for possible future action by him under the federal antitrust laws. (See 
generally, Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co. (1972) 405 U.S. 251, 257-260 [31 L. Ed. 2d 184, 189-191, 92 S. Ct. 885]; In re Multidistrict 
Vehicle Air Pollution M.D.L. No. 31 (9th Cir. 1973) 481 F.2d 122, 131.) Nor has he suggested, aside from a passing reference in 
his opening brief, that other less specific purposes, such as making a report to some appropriate legislative body, such as the 
United States Congress, was contemplated.  As I indicate in more detail below, an investigation having such broad purposes as 
these would raise questions which, in light of the Attorney General's posture in these proceedings, are not now before us. "
297,8," The controlling effect of the clear factual differences between the two sets of contracts was made even clearer in a concurring 
opinion representing the views of three justices.  It was there stated: ""Some years prior to this action Amerada-Signal claimed no 
more than its proportionate share, and under those circumstances the FPC disclaimed jurisdiction.  See North Dakota v. FPC, 
247 F.2d 173 (C.A. 8th Cir.  1957). The fact that the amount claimed by respondents at the time of this action exceeds Amerada-
Signal's proportionate share is due to the addition of new sources of supply to the commingled stream.  This change, standing 
alone, makes inapplicable any doctrine of collateral estoppel based on the FPC's disclaimer or the Court of Appeals' affirmance 
in North Dakota v. FPC, supra."" (379 U.S. at p. 691, fn. * [13 L. Ed. 2d at p. 608, fn. 1]; italics added.) "

holding company . . .."" 12 U.S.C. § 1841(a)(1) (1976). A company controls a bank if it: ""owns, controls, or has power to vote 25

directors or trustees of the bank . . ., (or) directly or indirectly exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies

316,2," The Federal Reserve Board in 1976 rejected an earlier application by a Stine entity, Nebraska Banco Inc., to reorganize NSB 
as a one-bank holding company. See 62 Fed.Res.Bull. 638 (1978). The Board relied on the adverse competitive effects of the 
proposed transaction and the managerial and financial structure of the applicant in denying the application. Id. "
317,3," Federal Reserve Board approval is not required for purchase of banks by individuals, for the definition of ""company"" does not 
include natural persons. See 12 U.S.C. § 1841(b) (1976). Thus, Stine's acquisition of NSB in 1972 was outside the Board's 
control. In 1978 Congress enacted the Change in Bank Control Act, Pub.L. No. 95-630, tit. 6, 92 Stat. 3641 (codified at 12 
U.S.C.A. § 1817(j)(1) (West Supp. 1979)), which gives the appropriate federal banking agency the authority to disallow a 
purchase of a bank by an individual."
317,4," If the state banking authority disapproves of the transaction, a hearing is required, 12 U.S.C. § 1842(b); if it approves, a 
hearing generally is not held. In this case, the application received the approval of Nebraska officials, so the Board did not hold a 
hearing. HN2[

337,10," An analogy was found in the sale of credit life and disability insurance, where the demand is ""derived"" in the sense that it 
would not exist except for the underlying transaction, and the cost represents a small percentage (one-half of 1 percent) of the 
total transaction price.  (See Credit Ins. Gen. Agents Assn. v. Payne (1976) 16 Cal.3d 651 [128 Cal.Rptr. 881, 547 P.2d 993].)"
337,11," It was noted that Guardian Title had no intention of offering escrow services, because of the existence of Coldwell Banker's 
wholly owned escrow service corporation, Landmark. "
338,12," The evidence upon which the department relied in making this finding concerned experience in northern California rather than 
any figures relative to market share, market penetration or growth of realtor-owned underwritten title companies in the four 
southern California counties in which Guardian Title proposed to operate.  The northern California experience, however, led the 
department to conclude that the market share of wholly owned underwritten title companies would be closely aligned to the 
share of the market controlled by the parent. "

The Legislative Counsel's Digest merely summarizes its content. "
346,17," ""It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, to lease or make a sale or 
contract for sale of goods, wares, merchandise, machinery, supplies, or other commodities, whether patented or unpatented, for 
use, consumption, or resale . . . or fix a price charged therefor, or discount from, or rebate upon, such price, on the condition, 
agreement, or understanding that the lessee or purchaser thereof shall not use or deal in the goods, wares, merchandise, 
machinery, supplies, or other commodities of a competitor or competitors of the lessor or seller, where the effect of such lease, "
347,," sale, or contract for sale or such condition, agreement, or understanding may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to 
create a monopoly in any line of commerce."" "
348,18," HN13[
] That section provides, in pertinent part, that ""[no] corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire, directly or 
indirectly, the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital and no corporation subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal 
Trade Commission shall acquire the whole or any part of the assets of another corporation engaged also in commerce, where in 
any line of commerce in any section of the country, the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition, or 
tend to create a monopoly."" (Italics added.) "
350,*," Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation. "
361,1," Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals directly addressed only claim 60, finding that claims 60 and 61 were nearly 
identical.  275 F. Supp. at 964. "
363,2," E. g., actions for unfair competition, Tubeco, Inc. v. Crippen Pipe Fabrication Corp., 402 F. Supp. 838 (E.D.N.Y.1975), aff'd 
mem., 538 F.2d 314 (2nd Cir. 1976), for antitrust violations or for breach of the license agreement. "
365,3," We need not here reiterate the Court of Appeals' comprehensive technical analysis.  See 399 F.2d 373. Of course, we do not 
decide here whether these changes are new or simply non-inventive changes in manufacture.  We need only decide whether the 
changes were proposed as amendments by Hughes' patent attorneys with the knowledge that they were new and with a 
calculated effort and intent to deceive the Patent Office, or with reckless disregard of their novelty. "
369,4," We note that Rosenberg was the attorney who was prosecuting the claim at this time.  A Patent Office action had been issued 
on March 20, 1953.  Rosenberg responded by an Amendment dated September 16, 1953.  Without waiting for a reply, 
Rosenberg filed the ""Supplemental Amendment"" dated March 9, 1954, which contained the ""incriminating"" statements.  We 
question if he intended that the supplemental amendment relate back to the September 1953 amendment. If so, it might serve to 
explain the ""nine months"" statement since the I.R.E. Bulletin advertising the diode was issued in February, 1953."
369,5," As we did earlier in advising that we were not deciding that claims 60 and 61 were non-inventive matter, we again do not 
decide that claims 60 and 61 would fail for late filing.  That is not at issue here.  The issue here is whether Hughes, with "
370,," knowledge that the time for filing had expired, conducted its patent prosecution fraudulently to conceal the new matter from the 
Patent Office and capture patent protection to which it was not entitled. "
371,6," While we do not attach any significance to the fact in view of our conclusion, we note that Carman witnessed the program 
conducted by Elmo Maiden at Hughes of the successful testing of the gold thermosetting paste from DuPont from February 15 to 
March 14, 1952. Carman was employed by Hughes until May, 1954."
371,7," ""§ 185. Patent barred for filing without license. HN13[
] ""Notwithstanding any other provisions of law any person, and his successors, assigns, or legal representatives, shall 
not receive a United States patent for an invention if that person, or his successors, assigns, or legal representatives shall, 
without procuring a license prescribed in section 184 of this title, have made, or consented to or assisted another's making, 
application in a foreign country for a patent or for the registration of a utility model, industrial design, or model in respect of the 
invention. A United States patent issued to such person, his successors, assigns, or legal representatives shall be invalid."" "
372,8," A royalty rate of 21/2% established by a master was found by the Sixth Circuit to be too low in a case which involved similar 
circumstances in that there were no available non-infringing substitutes for the patented device and in that there was great 
competition among sellers of infringing devices.  Panduit Corp. v. Stahlin Bros. Fibre Works, Inc., 575 F.2d 1152 (6th Cir. 
1978). "
373,9," Even the Court's direct inquiry to the witness as to a means of ascertaining production from inventory or raw material control 
failed to reveal any possibility of definitive figures. "
383,1," Only Count I is involved in this appeal.  Count II is being held in abeyance pending disposition of this appeal.  Appellees have 
withdrawn Count III."
383,2," HRS § 443-44 provides in relevant part that: No collection agency shall use . . . any conduct which is described as follows: . . . . (8) Any representation that an existing obligation of the debtor or alleged debtor may be increased by the addition of 
attorney's fees, investigation fees, service fees, and any other fees or charges when in fact such fees or charges may not 
legally be added to the existing obligations. . . . HN1[
] HRS § 480-2 states that: Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are 
unlawful."
383,3," HRS § 443-23 states that: A licensee shall not collect, or attempt to collect, any collection fee or attorney's fee or commission from any debtor; 
provided, however, attorney's fee or commission may be collected after filing of a suit against any debtor and such fee or 
commission shall not be in excess of twenty-five per cent of the unpaid principal balance."
383,4," HRS § 607-17 provides in pertinent part that: Any law to the contrary notwithstanding, no . . . attorney's fee shall be allowed to the plaintiff by any court: . . . . (2) If prior to or at the time the debt was incurred, the debtor did sign an instrument in writing which provided for the 
payment of an attorney's fee and such instrument in writing contains within its principal amount any attorney's fee from a 
prior debt."
383,5, HRS § 443-47 states that: 
384,," A violation of this part by a collection agency shall constitute unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or 
practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce for the purpose of section 480-2."
384,6, HRS § 480-12 provides that: Any contract or agreement in violation of this chapter is void and is not enforceable at law or in equity.
384,7," HRS § 480-13 provides in relevant part that: (a) Any person who is injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden or declared unlawful by this 
chapter: (1) May sue for damages sustained by him, and, if the judgment is for the plaintiff, he shall be awarded a sum not less than 
$ 1,000.00 or three-fold damages by him sustained, whichever sum is the greater, and reasonable attorneys fees together 
with the cost of suit; provided that no showing that the proceeding or suit would be in the public interest (as these terms are 
interpreted under section 5(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act) is necessary when the party against whom the 
proceeding or suit is brought is a merchant as that term is defined in chapter 490. . . ."
384,8, See note 7 supra.
384,9," Defendant does not specifically address plaintiffs' prayer for a declaratory judgment that the promissory note is void and 
unenforceable under HRS § 480-12.  We find, in any event, that plaintiffs have standing to sue for such relief by virtue of HRS § 
632-1. "
385,10," We note that even were sufficient ambiguity present to require resort to legislative history, defendant's theory that the 
legislature did not intend the private enforcement of HRS § 480-2 is unsupportable.  Reporting on H.B. No. 136, the 1965 
amendment to the Hawaii Antitrust Act adding HRS § 480-2, the House Standing Committee on Housing and Consumer 
Protection noted that: The Hawaii Antitrust Act now contains appropriate enforcement provisions, including authority to the Attorney General to 
bring proceedings to enjoin any violations of the provisions of the act.  The amendment of that act, as provided by H.B. No. 
136, would make all of its enforcement provisions, except the criminal provisions, applicable to the amendment. House Comm. on Housing and Consumer Protection, S.C. Rep. No. 55, 3d Leg., Reg. Sess., House Journal at 538 (1965).  
HRS § 480-13, providing for individual enforcement proceedings, was then in effect.  The legislature, moreover, has amended § 
480-13 two times subsequent to the enactment of § 480-2, and in both instances clearly indicated that such amendments were 
designed to facilitate private action against unfair or deceptive trade practices.  See Senate Judiciary Comm., S.C. Rep. No. 
703-74, 7th Leg., Reg. Sess., Senate Journal at 1021 (1974); Senate Comm. on Consumer Protection and Criminal Revision, 
S.C. Rep. No. 600, 5th Leg., Reg. Sess., Senate Journal at 1111 (1969)."
385,11," It should be remembered that it was the stated intent of the House and Senate conferees, in recommending passage of the 
Hawaii Antitrust Act, that: wherever there are comparable provisions of the federal anti-trust laws and tests similar in language to those provided in 
this bill, it is intended that those decided federal cases applicable and relating to those provisions and tests will guide the 
interpretation and application of such terms and provisions of this bill in the light of the economic and business conditions of 
this State. Conference Comm., C.C. Rep. No. 16, 1st Leg., Reg. Sess., House Journal at 1075 (1961). "
386,12," Although the public interest requirement is not a literal part of the federal antitrust laws, the doctrine that an allegation of public 
interest is essential to a complaint charging violation of the antitrust laws has been widely debated in the case law relevant to the 
Sherman and Clayton Acts.  See E. Timberlake, Federal Treble Damage Antitrust Actions, Ch. 15 (1965).  Judicial 
interpretations of the public interest doctrine in the context of the Sherman and Clayton Acts have thus proved helpful to our 
analysis."
386,13," There appears to be confusion as to whether Radiant Burners has eliminated public injury as a separate element of all 
antitrust violations or whether the rule is simply applicable to cases of per se illegality. See Discussion of lower court decisions 
subsequent to Radiant Burners in ABA Antitrust Section, Antitrust Law Developments 265-67 (1975).  Timberlake, for example, "
387,," argues that the Supreme Court intended by Radiant Burners to abolish the public injury requirement only in per se cases.  E. 
Timberlake, Federal Treble Damage Antitrust Actions, Ch. 15 (1965).  Areeda, on the other hand, contends that the conclusion that conduct offends the antitrust laws is inherently a declaration that it offends the public interest. The public 
injury issue may reflect confusion concerning the definition of the substantive offense.  A harmful effect upon the economy 
is sometimes an essential element of the antitrust violation.  In that event, the private plaintiff -- as well as the government 
plaintiff -- must prove it.  But where defendant's conduct is illegal without proof of market effects, the government would 
prevail merely by proving the conduct.  The private plaintiff should also prevail in these circumstances -- subject, of course, 
to proving direct injury to himself. P. Areeda and D. Turner, II Antitrust Law para. 331c. (1978) (footnote omitted)."
387,14," In recommending passage of HRS § 480-2, the House Judiciary Committee quoted Congressional justification for the broad 
and general language of the Federal Trade Commission Act: It is impossible to frame definitions which embrace all unfair practices.  There is no limit to human inventiveness in this field.  
Even if all known practices were specifically defined and prohibited, it would be at once necessary to begin over again.  If 
Congress were to adopt the method of definition, it would undertake an endless task. House Judiciary Comm., S.C. Rep. No. 267, 3d Leg., Reg. Sess., House Journal at 600 (1965).  See also House Comm. on 
Housing and Consumer Protection, S.C. Rep. No. 55, 3d Leg. Reg. Sess., House Journal at 538 (1965). "
388,15, See note 2 supra.
388,16, See note 3 supra.
388,17," It is further to be noted that attorney's fees are totally disallowed to a plaintiff by HRS § 607-17: [i]f prior to or at the time the debt was incurred, the debtor did sign an instrument in writing which provided for the payment 
of an attorney's fee and such instrument in writing contains within its principal amount any attorney's fee from a prior debt. Since the debtors herein did in fact sign a promissory note which provided for an attorney's fee pyramided upon an attorney's fee 
from a prior debt, the defendant-creditor would have been unable to collect the newly provided attorney's fee in any action 
against the debtors.  The representation that the obligation of the debtors could be increased by an attorney's fee prohibited 
under HRS § 607-17 was therefore also in violation of § 443-44(8)."
388,18, See note 6 supra. 
398,1," Fairchild Camera & Instrument Corp. v. Data General Corp., No. C-78-2418 (N.D.Cal., filed Oct. 1978); SCI Systems, Inc. v. 
Data General Corp., No. C-78-2417 (N.D.Cal., filed Oct. 1978); Digidyne Corp. v. Data General Corp., No. C-78-1261 (N.D.Cal., 
filed June 1978)."
398,2," In May, 1979, the Panel transferred three actions to this Court: Bytronix Corp. v. Data General Corp., No. 78-3832-RF 
(C.D.Cal., filed Oct. 1978); Data General Corp. v. Ampex Corp., No. 79-1247 (D.N.J., filed Aug. 1978); Data General Corp. v. 
Ampex Corp., No. 77-0636 (D.N.J., filed Mar. 1977).  In June, 1979, the Panel conditionally transferred here Data Compass 
Corp. v. Data General Corp., No. 79-1784-AA (C.D.Cal., filed Feb. 1979). In November, 1979, the Panel conditionally transferred here three additional actions: Data General Corp. v. Data National Corp., 
No. 78-2869-K (D.Mass., filed Nov. 1978); Data General Corp. v. Ampex Corp., No. 79-1342-MRP (C.D.Cal., filed Apr. 1979); 
Data General Corp. v. Ampex Corp., No. 79-193-T (D.Mass., filed Jan. 1979).  Because those three actions were transferred 
here after the filing of the cross-motions for summary judgment that are the subject of this Opinion, the Court's rulings herein do "
399,," not apply directly to those actions.  The seven actions which are directly affected by this Opinion will hereinafter be referred to 
collectively, unless otherwise noted."
399,3," In five of the seven consolidated actions, Data General is aligned as the sole defendant.  In the remaining two actions (both of 
which were brought by Data General against Ampex), Data General is nominally the plaintiff.  Because all of the antitrust claims 
place Data General in a defense posture, Data General will be referred to herein as the defendant and all of the non-Data 
General parties will be referred to collectively as the plaintiffs."
399,4," Section 3.30 of the Manual directs the moving party to submit separate narrative statements of each of the facts and legal 
contentions on which it relies.  The opposing party must admit or deny each factual statement and respond to each legal 
contention.  Plaintiffs initially submitted 77 factual statements and 25 legal contentions.  Supporting each factual statement were 
fact citations and evidentiary documents from which the citations were excerpted.  Data General responded with direct 
responses, factual assertions, and comments addressed to each factual statement and with a brief addressed to the legal 
issues.  In support of its cross-motion for summary judgment, Data General submitted 163 factual statements, 52 legal 
contentions, and another brief.  The documents submitted to substantiate its factual statements and assertions included a 
compilation of 59 affidavits and declarations and 3 volumes of tabbed evidentiary materials.  Each side then responded to the 
other's first-round submissions.  Supplementary fact citations, affidavits and declarations, and evidentiary materials were filed.  
In addition, plaintiffs Ampex, Bytronix, and Data Compass submitted separate briefs, affidavits, and evidentiary support."
399,5," The software items in issue here are operating systems software. Unless otherwise noted, the term ""software"" will refer 
hereinafter to operating systems software. "
400,6," Two plaintiffs are involved in the software market.  Fairchild has developed software specifically for use with the CPUs which it 
manufactures.  Data Compass develops its own software, but markets it along with CPUs which it purchases from Data General.  
A third plaintiff SCI is in the process of developing software for use with its CPUs."
400,7," Data General claims that plaintiffs misappropriated its trade secrets and proprietary information in the development of their 
NOVA-emulating CPUs.  The trade secrets issues will be litigated immediately following the resolution of the antitrust issues."
400,8," Data General has approved the use of its software with CPUs manufactured by ROLM Corporation and Nippon Minicomputer 
Corporation, neither of whose computer products compete with products offered by Data General in the United States and 
Europe.  Data General has refused requests from other manufacturers to license its software for use with their CPUs.  Data 
General's factual assertion in response to plaintiffs' fact statement II, A, 3."
400,9," Data General will also sell CPUs on a replacement basis from its spare parts list.  See Section IV, A, 2, infra. "
402,10," In light of this conclusion, it is unnecessary to reach Data General's contention that computer software is not ""goods, wares, 
merchandise, machinery, supplies or other commodities"" within the scope of the Clayton Act."
402,11," It has occasionally been stated that plaintiffs must satisfy two additional requirements in order to prove an illegal tie-in. That 
is, they must show that the seller of the tying product has an economic interest in the tied product and that buyers have been 
subjected to ""some modicum of coercion."" Moore v. Jas. H. Matthews & Co., 550 F.2d 1207, 1216 (9th Cir. 1977). However, 
these factors have not been generally recognized as additions to the governing three-part (plus fact of damage) test.  Rather, 
they are taken into account in the context of the separate products and economic power issues.  See, e.g., Bogosian v. Gulf Oil 
Corp., 561 F.2d 434, 449-50 (3d Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1086, 98 S. Ct. 1280, 55 L. Ed. 2d 791 (1978); Hill v. A-T-O, 
Inc., 535 F.2d 1349, 1355 (2d Cir. 1976); BBD Transportation Co. v. United States Steel Corp., 1976-2 Trade Cas. P 61,079 at 
69,874 (N.D.Cal.1976) (CCH)."
402,12," Some courts have evaluated alleged business justifications in the course of determining whether each of the requisite 
elements has been established (most asserted justifications pertain to the separate products issue).  Other courts view such 
justifications as affirmative defenses to be taken into account after all of the elements have been separately considered.  The 
Ninth Circuit has employed the latter approach in two of its leading tie-in cases.  Moore v. Jas. H. Matthews & Co., supra n.11; 
Siegel v. Chicken Delight, Inc., 448 F.2d 43 (9th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 955, 92 S. Ct. 1172, 31 L. Ed. 2d 232 (1972). 
Under this approach, the defendant bears the burden of proving that his case fits within the narrow contours of the business 
justification defense.  Advance Business Systems & Supply Co. v. SCM Corp., 415 F.2d 55, 68 n.12 (4th Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 
397 U.S. 920, 90 S. Ct. 928, 25 L. Ed. 2d 101 (1970); Anderson Foreign Motors v. New England Toyota Distributors, 475 F. 
Supp. 973, 981 (D.Mass.1979). "
404,13," Although Rule 56(d) practice is occasionally described as ""partial summary judgment,"" that term is a misnomer where, as 
here, no final judgment is rendered and the parties must proceed to trial.  Diamond Door Co. v. Lane-Stanton Lumber Co., 505 
F.2d 1199, 1202 (9th Cir. 1974). See also 6 Pt. 2 Moore's Federal Practice P 56.20(3-1) at 56-1214 (1979). "

affidavit of Stephen R. Steinberg, attorney for Data General, quoted at plaintiffs' fact citations I-B, tab. 1.  There is a genuine 
issue of fact concerning whether plaintiffs' CPUs are functionally equivalent to Data General's CPUs (i. e., whether they are fully 
compatible with Data General's software).  Compare plaintiffs' fact statement I,B,8, and citations referenced therein, with Data 
General's factual assertions in response thereto, and evidentiary materials cited therein.  Although this dispute is material to the 
determination of the extent of plaintiffs' damages a factual determination to be made by the jury at trial it is not material to the 
question whether software and CPUs are separate products.  For purposes of establishing separate products, the dispositive 
facts regarding ""compatibility"" are not in dispute: numerous companies market CPUs, in competition with Data General's NOVA 
CPUs, for use with Data General's software."
405,20," Deposition of Stephen Gaal, Data General's North American manager, systems engineering, quoted at plaintiffs' fact citations 
II-B(4), tab 17. "
406,21," Data General claims that ""plaintiffs have offered no evidence that CPU manufacturers other than Data General have in fact 
licensed (as distinguished from offering to license) operating systems software for use on competing CPUs."" Data General's 
factual assertion (a) in response to plaintiffs' fact statement II,B,9.  However, Data General's own submissions acknowledge that 
both IBM and Intel have in fact licensed their software for use on other companies' CPUs.  Data General's factual assertion 
(b)(5) in response to plaintiffs' fact statement II,B,9 (re IBM); deposition of Edson D. de Castro, Data General's president, quoted 
at plaintiffs' fact citations II-B(4), tab 16 (re IBM); deposition of Roger Borovoy, Intel's general counsel, quoted at Data General's 
evidentiary materials, tab 3 (re Intel).  In addition, Data General provides no specific facts disputing plaintiffs' submissions which 
establish that Zilog will also make its software available separately from its CPUs.  Deposition of William B. Sweet, Zilog's 
director of marketing, quoted at plaintiffs' supp. fact citations II-B, tab 2. On the other hand, plaintiffs have not presented specific facts disputing Data General's argument that, among the companies 
that offer both software and CPUs, it is the ""predominant practice"" to license software only for use on the licensing company's 
CPUs.  Declaration of Richard L. Bernacchi, P 5.  This fact alone neither calls for a finding that software and CPUs are 
components of a single product nor precludes a finding that they are separate products.  First, ""(a) favorable intra-industry 
comparison, although relevant, is by no means conclusive on the single product issue."" Anderson Foreign Motors, Inc. v. New 
England Toyota Distributors, Inc., supra n.12. Second, in the particular circumstances of this case, the undisputed facts 
(including separate availability, separate pricing, and separate marketing of CPUs and software, and the existence of numerous 
companies that market either software or CPUs, but not both) establish that software and CPUs are separate products within the 
meaning of the antitrust laws."

228, 232 (N.D.Cal.1978), does not affect the analysis here.  In that case, the Court found that the aggregation of computer 
peripheral devices constituted a single product, in part because the purpose of combining the items was to enhance their 
technological capabilities and satisfy a recognized customer need for increased on-line storage capacity.  Id.  This case does not 
involve physical aggregation and there is no evidence that bundling for marketing purposes yields any technological benefits 
apart from those attributable to joint R&D (which, for reasons discussed above, does not require joint marketing)."

418,97," Plaintiffs allege four types of injury in addition to the lost sales.  They claim that Data General's copyright and trade secrets 
claims prevented the development of competing software to which customers could easily convert (fact statement II,D,21), that 
plaintiffs incurred additional expenditures to develop software for use with their own CPUs and that they would not have 
developed such software in the absence of the tie-in (fact statement II,D,23), that they incurred legal expenses defending Data 
General's lawsuits enforcing the illegal tie-in (fact statement II,D,24), and that they paid higher prices for unwanted tied items 
purchased from Data General than they would have paid in the absence of the tie-in (fact statement II,D,25).  Disputed issues of 
fact exist with respect to each of these claims.  See Data General's responses to each of the cited fact statements.  However, 
the undisputed fact of lost sales is sufficient to support a finding of fact of damage under Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine

matters stated in the foregoing 'Petition to Deny' are true * * *."" JA 1120. (2) Charles R. Blankenship, a sales officer of American Satellite, stated that a potential customer had told him that IBM had 
conducted a seminar partially concerning the SBS system. JA 1436-1437; see also JA 1087 n.2 (American Satellite petition to 
deny). (3) John A. Keyes, a sales officer of American Satellite, stated that another potential customer had attended another such 
seminar. JA 1438; see also JA 1087 n.2 (American Satellite petition to deny). (4) H. R. Johnson, Vice President of Western Union, stated (1) that potential customers do not need to be given simultaneous 
presentations by communications and computer suppliers; (2) that 72% of present interstate private line communications is 
generated by 88 large customers; and (3) that data communications users are among the long-distance communications service 
customers. He also asserted, without support, that ""large corporations and the federal government"" comprise a ""principal 
market"" for domestic satellite services, and that ""certain users""--identities unspecified--may be able to employ only satellite, and 
not terrestrial, communications services. JA 1058-1060. (5) Jayaram Ramasastry, electrical engineer and Director of Transmission Systems Engineering of Western Union, stated that 
the SBS system will perform ""highly sophisticated data organization and integration functions"" that other systems cannot, and 
that development of the system required very substantial research expenditures. He concluded that he was unable to evaluate 
the accuracy of SBS's research cost summary. He also challenged the completeness and accuracy of other SBS cost data. JA 
1061-1063, 1497-1499. (6) Robert R. Nathan, an economic consultant hired by Western Union, stated as his expert opinion (1) that information could be 
generated to define relevant submarkets with sufficient precision at any one given point in time; (2) that potential competition 
from IBM or Comsat could competitively influence the market; and (3) that more information is needed to evaluate whether the 
SBS entry would become so entrenched as to deter future entry. JA 1485-1496. "
450,," Our dissenting colleague asserts that the petitions to deny submitted by Western Union and American Satellite ""set forth 
allegations that indisputably are specific in nature."" Opinion of Judge Robinson, text at note 185. Our examination of these 
documents, however, reveals a detailed legal and economic analysis, but little in the way of ""specific allegations of fact."" Indeed, 
Judge Robinson's three selected illustrations of purportedly specific factual allegations in the petitions underscore this 
conclusion. See id., note 185. The first illustrative allegation--Western Union's statement concerning the principal customers for 
domestic satellite service--is essentially undisputed. Disputed is the inference that might be drawn: for example, whether these 
principal customers so dominate SBS's potential clientele, and are so separate an economic unit, as to constitute a relevant 
submarket for purposes of antitrust analysis. The second and third examples--concerning entry requirements and IBM's 1975 
statement that it had considered separate entry--were supported by citations to the CML Decision, supra note 35, 51 F.C.C.2d 
14, and statements by IBM. These ""allegations"" were not disputed, nor did they contribute anything not already known to the 
Commission. The disagreements among the parties are not genuinely factual; rather, they concern the appropriate public interest 
determination on the antitrust and communications issues. An evidentiary hearing is not required in such a situation."

111, 54 L. Ed. 2d 89 (1977) (""We think it odd that the Department [of Justice] has not presented factual data to the Commission 
which would allow it to assess the likely effect of its rules on various fields of competition. The Department's arguments are 
basically speculative * * *.""). In this case, though the Department's submissions have been more detailed and sophisticated, they 
still fall short of the ""specific allegations of fact"" required of petitions to deny by § 309(d)."
450,84," The Department of Justice has in effect admitted that the allegations of fact in the petitions to deny were in themselves 
insufficient to trigger the hearing requirement of § 309(e): ""We lack sufficient information to make such a judgment. So does the 
Commission, but it has refused to admit as much."" Brief for appellant United States of America (hereinafter Dep't of Justice) at 
18. In view of this admission, the position of our dissenting colleague, see opinion of Judge Robinson at Part II-B, is puzzling. It is 
even more puzzling when compared to this court's decision in Columbus Broadcasting Coalition v. FCC, supra note 81, 505 F.2d 
320, 164 U.S. App. D.C. 213, in which Judge Robinson joined. In that case the court upheld an FCC licensing decision against 
the challenge that an evidentiary hearing under § 309(e) had been erroneously denied. The Columbus Broadcasting petitioner 
had submitted a petition to deny relying on four substantial alleged deviations of the licensee from the public interest standard. 
The petition alleged facts more specific, more disputed, and more within its personal knowledge than any in the present case. 
Nevertheless, the court recognized that the FCC's decision not to hold a hearing was within its discretion and expertise. 
Following a similar standard in this case, we must affirm the Commission."

451,87," Thus, our dissenting colleague's professed adherence to a congressional decision to require hearings in cases such as this, 
see opinion of Judge Robinson, text and notes at notes 156-169, is misplaced. Section 309(e) does not ""give [] the Commission 
no authority to consider the public interest in deciding whether a hearing must be conducted[.]"" Id., text following note 168. Nor 
did the FCC in this case ""ignore the will of Congress"" or show ""flat disregard of a procedure mandated by statute."" Id., text at 
note 199. Section 309(e) HN14[
] requires an evidentiary hearing if a substantial and material question of fact is presented, or 
if the FCC is unable to reach a determination on the public interest. Contrary to our colleague's mechanical approach, these 
determinations require judgment. The substantiality and materiality of purported issues of fact, and the need for further 
information, are issues to be evaluated in the first instance by the Commission in the light of its public interest responsibility. This 
court's oversight role is quite limited.  Columbus Broadcasting Coalition v. FCC, supra note 81, 505 F.2d 320, 164 U.S. App.

452,97," We observe that the appellants and amicus curiae as a group offer or imply at least seven purported grounds for distinguishing 
Network Project. The Department of Justice has offered three: (1) that the satellite industry is no longer experimental, brief of 
Dep't of Justice at 53; (2) that Network Project involved only inferences from undisputed facts, supplemental brief of Dep't of 
Justice at 32; and (3) that Network Project involved vertical integration or anticompetitive behavior susceptible of alleviation by "
453,," FCC restrictive orders, reply brief of Dep't of Justice at 11 n.4. In its main brief American Satellite offered two grounds for 
distinguishing the cases: that Network Project involved no disputed material facts, and that it involved the question whether the 
FCC could impose a per se disqualification on all entries posing vertical integration problems. Brief of American Satellite at 38 
n.2. In its reply brief American Satellite offered a third: that in this case--unlike the original license proceeding--there are carriers 
operating in the field that deserve protection from a new entrant. Reply brief of American Satellite at 2-3. The FTC suggests that 
Network Project did not involve a balancing of anticompetitive and other factors, and that the present case, unlike Network 
Project, presents a prima facie Clayton Act violation. Brief of FTC at 31 n.66; supplemental brief of FTC at 9 n.8. We do not 
consider any of these grounds for distinction persuasive. If anything, this appeal presents a clearer case for affirmance than did 
Network Project, because the factual record is more complete and the analysis of the antitrust issues more careful. We 
especially reject American Satellite's argument that once several firms are granted entrance into the field the rules should be 
changed to block competition from additional entrants. Our dissenting colleague also attempts to distinguish Network Project, on the ground that the petitioner in that case ""did not 
dispute any of the material facts upon which the determination was predicated, but asserted only that those facts were 
insufficient to underpin a public-interest finding."" This he calls ""only a legal question, on which a hearing was obviously 
unnecessary."" Opinion of Judge Robinson at note 144. In the case at bar, however, appellants have not disputed any of the 
material facts, but have concentrated instead on the ultimate conclusion, just as the Network Project did. Here, as in Network 
Project, appellants primarily assert that insufficient facts have been adduced to make a public interest finding. See text and

FCC's fears about regulatory delay. We cannot endorse this proposal. First, it assumes what the hearing is designed to prove: 
that Comsat or IBM would be willing to operate SBS alone, without the other. Second, it would impede SBS's attempts to garner 
customers, since those customers may rely on the combined expertise of Comsat and IBM. Finally, the uncertainty of the capital "

460,126," Western Union, AT&T, and GTE have well known positions in the telegraph and telephone industries. RCA Alascom, the 
terrestrial telephone carrier in Alaska, seeks to transfer most of Alaska's telephone traffic to RCA's satellite system. American 
Satellite presently has no such capability, but it has announced plans to combine its satellite effort with Continental Telephone, 
which does. See note 3 supra."
460,127," SBS Decision, 62 F.C.C.2d at 1091 P 279, JA 1614."
460,128," In its CML Decision, supra note 35, 51 F.C.C.2d at 40- 41 P 42, the Commission described the ""substantial economic and 
technical resources"" of IBM, which might enable IBM to enter the field separately."
460,129," The Department of Justice has charged that the FCC's conclusion that IBM is not likely to enter the domestic satellite 
communications industry alone is contradicted by a statement in the earlier CML Decision. According to the Department's 
supplemental brief at 46, the FCC had ""found it 'likely' that IBM would enter if denied the opportunity to engage in a joint venture 
with Comsat. 51 F.C.C.2d at 39."" The baselessness of this charge is revealed by quoting the cited language of the CML 
Decision in context: It is, of course, possible that both IBM and Comsat General would seek independent entry as domestic satellite applicants if 
we forbid their joint entry in any manner whatsoever. Indeed, our decision herein implicitly acknowledges as much in 
providing them with the option of doing so in the event they find this preferable to the balanced CML and leasing options set 
forth herein. But in arriving at a determination on the Section 7 allegations of the various parties we must pragmatically 
acknowledge the fact that the financial barriers to both IBM and Comsat General entering independently are formidable 
indeed. On a conservative estimate, entry into the domestic satellite field requires a capital investment well in excess of $ 
100 million. Considering this enormous capital investment cost, in light of the present difficulties in raising capital and the 
very uncertain nature of the demand for satellite communications services * * *, we cannot indulge in the same assumptions 
about the ease of entry that might be appropriate for other industries * * *. Given IBM's resources we might well suppose it 
likely that it would proceed alone if necessary, but if it did so, could we suppose it is equally likely that Comsat General 
would enter--in competition with IBM and the other domestic satellite carriers such as AT&T, Western Union and RCA 
satellite carriers? Reasonable men can debate at length over the probabilities of independent entry by both IBM and 
Comsat General, but the debate cannot be resolved simply by recitation of antitrust decisions dealing with assorted other 
industries and other circumstances. * * * "
461,," CML Decision, supra note 35, 51 F.C.C.2d at 39 P 40 (emphasis in original; citations omitted). Obviously, the FCC did not find it 
""likely"" that IBM would enter the field alone."

461,132," It is important to remember that joint ventures are the characteristic form of entry in the domestic satellite industry, and have 
been encouraged from the start. See Proposed Second Report and Order, supra note 14, 35 F.C.C.2d at 850 P 17. If joint 
ventures are necessarily suspect under the Penn-Olin doctrine, then most current satellite firms--and presumably most potential 
entrants--are suspect as well. The doctrine cannot be confined to IBM and Comsat alone. "
462,133," The relevant market analysis considered in text and notes at notes 111-116 supra is equally important to the entrenchment 
argument, but it need not be considered again here."
462,134," It is ironic, therefore, that appellants argue in effect that the joint venture should be disallowed because it prevents IBM from 
entering the market separately from Comsat, and also that IBM should be prohibited from entering because of entrenchment 
problems."

tribunals. Moreover, such an argument is particularly pertinent in connection with alleged violations of the antitrust statutes "
476,," which are the particular province of the Department of Justice and do not, by any other law, come within the jurisdiction of 
any independent quasi-judicial agency of government. Id. at 9. Only the Sherman Act, which relies on criminal penalties, is ""the particular province of the Department of Justice."" See 
15 U.S.C. §§ 1-7 (1976). The Clayton Act, on the other hand, is administered by FTC, FCC and several other ""independent

in section 311. The Commission's authority to determine whether or not the public interest, convenience, or necessity will 
be served by the granting of a license remains paramount and if it finds that the conviction of a licensee under the antitrust 
laws or under section 313 has materially affected the character or standing of such licensee so as to warrant refusal of a 
renewal, or grant of license, it may so proceed. See also 98 Cong. Rec. 7399, 7403, 7417-7421 (reaffirming primacy of public interest standard)."
476,98," I note, too, that in 1950 Congress amended § 7 of the Clayton Act to increase substantially the scope of coverage by 
outlawing anticompetitive intercorporate acquisitions of assets, Act of Dec. 29, 1950, Pub. L. No. 81-899, 64 Stat. 1125, to close 
a significant loophole under the earlier provision barring such shifts of control only if accomplished by stock purchases. S. Rep. 
No. 1775, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 3 (1950). But in so doing, Congress included only those businesses subject to FTC jurisdiction, 
declining to grant this important antitrust tool to the other agencies mentioned in § 11. Finding no recorded explanation for this 
action, I can only speculate that it reflects a further diminishing of legislative interest in administrative enforcement of the Clayton 
Act outside FTC itself. I find unpersuasive, however, the court's attempt to discern present legislative intent in the failure of Congress to adopt bills that 
would have expressly declared competition to be in the public interest. See Maj. Op., text at notes 65-69. ""Legislative silence is a 
poor beacon to follow in discerning the proper statutory route,"" Zuber v. Allen, 396 U.S. 168, 185, 90 S. Ct. 314, 323, 24 L. Ed.

479,," ""specifically addressed the ICC's responsibilities under Section 11 of the Clayton Act."" Maj. Op., text following note 70. To be 
sure, Seaboard involved Clayton Act questions, while in McLean the Sherman Act was at issue. The three-judge District Court 
reviewed in Seaboard found the distinction important and held that, in part because of its Clayton Act responsibilities, ICC was 
required to make specific findings under that Act's standards before deciding to grant immunity.  Florida E. C. Ry. v. United 
States, 242 F. Supp. 14, 20-22 (M.D. Fla. 1965). But the Supreme Court merely held that such findings were unnecessary 
because, as McLean had indicated, the final determination under § 5(2) is not controlled by antitrust considerations, a result that 
says nothing about the effect of § 11 of the Clayton Act when not counterpoised against a provision, such as § 5(11), specifically 
waiving antitrust enforcement."

480,129,"  In contrast, the Clayton Act is prohibitive, and imposes a positive obligation upon the ICC to act. The Commission is 
directed, whenever it has reason to believe any carrier within its jurisdiction is violating § 7, to ""issue and serve upon such 
person and the Attorney General a complaint stating its charges in that respect, and containing a notice of a hearing. . . ."" 
15 U.S.C. § 21(b). Section 16, 15 U.S.C. § 26, excepts from the power of private persons to bring § 7 suits for injunctive 
relief all cases involving matters subject to ICC jurisdiction. By thus limiting the authority of private persons to institute court 
proceedings to enjoin § 7 violations, this provision underscores the ICC's responsibility to act when such violations are 
brought to its attention. Id. (emphasis supplied). Similar language appeared earlier in the opinion, see id. at 493, 87 S. Ct. at 1759-1760, 18 L. Ed. 2d at 
912-913, where the Court found in ICC's § 11 enforcement responsibility support for its conclusion that anticompetitive conduct 
is a factor not to be ignored in the public interest determination under § 20a. It was in reference only to its use in this context that 
the Court later stated that the presence of § 11 had not controlled the result in Denver. See Gulf States Utils. Co. v. FPC, 411 
U.S. 747, 761-762, 93 S. Ct. 1870, 1879, 36 L. Ed. 2d 635, 645-646 (1973)."
480,130," It is not entirely clear that the Court so holds, however. Ultimately it concludes that ""if [an alliance between Greyhound and 
Railway Express] would in fact be against the public interest, then § 7 of the Clayton Act requires that it be stopped in its 
incipiency."" Id. at 504, 87 S. Ct. at 1765, 18 L. Ed. 2d at 919. The Court may have meant that a combination in violation of § 7 
necessarily contravenes the public interest, and consequently is forbidden. On the other hand, one may plausibly read it as 
saying that only those Clayton Act violations that, on balance, are against the public interest need be proscribed."

483,147," In Gulf States, supra note 129, the Supreme Court interpreted § 204 of the Federal Power Act, 49 Stat. 850, 16 U.S.C. § 824c 
(1976) [hereinafter cited as codified]. The relevant portion of this statute states: (a) No public utility shall issue any security . . . unless and until, and then only to the extent that, upon application by the 
public utility, the Commission by order authorizes such issue. . . . The Commission shall make such order only if it finds that 
such issue . . . (a) is for some lawful object, within the corporate purposes of the applicant and compatible with the public 
interest, which is necessary or appropriate for or consistent with the proper performance by the applicant of service as a 
public utility and which will not impair its ability to perform that service, and (b) is reasonably necessary or appropriate for 
such purposes…. (b) The Commission, after opportunity for hearing, may grant any application under this section in whole or in part, and with 
such modifications and upon such terms and conditions as it may find necessary or appropriate, and may from time to time, 
after opportunity for hearing and for good cause shown, make such supplemental orders in the premises as it may find 
necessary or appropriate…."
483,16," U.S.C. § 824c(a), (b) (1976) (emphasis supplied). In Bell Tel. Co., supra note 146, § 201(a) of the Communications Act was interpreted by the Third Circuit. Section 201(a) 
provides: It shall be the duty of every common carrier engaged in interstate or foreign communication by wire or radio to furnish such 
communication service upon reasonable request therefore; and, in accordance with the orders of the Commission, in cases 
where the Commission, after opportunity for hearing, finds such action necessary or desirable in the public interest, to 
establish physical connections with other carriers, to establish through routes and charges applicable thereto and the 
division of such charges, and to establish and provide facilities and regulations for operating such through routes."

The Bell Tel. Co. case involved a dispute over FCC's authority to require Bell of Pennsylvania to establish interconnections with 
other carriers. One issue focused on whether the Commission could require establishment of interconnections as provided in § 
201(a), see note 147 supra, without first holding evidentiary hearings. The Third Circuit refused to interpret § 201(a) as imposing 
a per se hearing requirement. See 503 F.2d at 1265. In reaching this conclusion the court specifically noted that ""the statutory 
phrase ('opportunity for hearing') is neutral: it no more requires an evidentiary hearing than does the equivocal phrase 
'proceeding.'"" Id. at 1264."
483,152," This reasoning is also consonant with the Supreme Court's decision in Gulf States, supra note 129. In Gulf States, as in 
Denver & R. G. W. R.R. v. United States, supra note 103, cited in Gulf States, the Court spoke of close scrutiny of the agency 
decision not to hold a hearing in the course of review under the abuse-of-discretion standard. This is perfectly consistent with my 
interpretation of § 309. Review of the agency's determination as to procedures to emply in reaching a decision is governed by 
the abuse-of-discretion standard where the statute itself requires only opportunity for a hearing rather than specifically mandated 
procedures. "

required AEC to adhere to § 102 of the National Environmental Protection Act, 42 U.S.C. § 4321 et seq. (1976). We stated that 
statutorily-prescribed ""duties are not inherently flexible. They must be complied with to the fullest extent, unless there is a clear 
conflict of statutory authority. Considerations of administrative difficulty, delay or economic costs will not suffice to strip the 
section of its fundamental importance."" Id. at 39, 449 F.2d at 1115 (emphasis in original). Contrary to the position advanced by 
the court in the instant case, see Maj. Op. at note 109, so-called considerations of ""demonstrable urgency"" do not make 
statutory requirements any more flexible. Nor can an agency excuse its failure to obey the statute on the ground that the 
""procedures were adopted to enable the agency better to fulfill, not to frustrate the statutory mandate."" Id. at n.108. Just as § 102 
of NEPA, § 309 of the Communications Act ""mandates a particular sort of careful and informed decision-making process and

484,155," Section 309(e) contains the hearing provisions. In full, it provides: If, in the case of any application to which [§ 309(a)] applies, a substantial and material question of fact is presented or the 
Commission for any reason is unable to make the finding specified in such subsection, it shall formally designate the 
application for hearing on the ground or reasons then obtaining and shall forthwith notify the applicant and all other known 
parties in interest of such action and the grounds and reasons therefor, specifying with particularity the matters and things 
in issue but not including issues or requirements phrased generally. When the Commission has so designated an 
application for hearing the parties in interest, if any, who are not notified by the Commission of such action may acquire the 
status of a party to the proceeding thereon by filing a petition for intervention showing the basis for their interest at any time 
not less than ten days prior to the date of hearing. Any hearing subsequently held upon such application shall be a full 
hearing in which the applicant and all other parties in interest shall be permitted to participate. The burden of proceeding 
with the introduction of evidence and the burden of proof shall be upon the applicant, except that with respect to any issue 
presented by a petition to deny or a petition to enlarge the issues, such burden shall be as determined by the Commission."
484,47, U.S.C. § 309(e) (1976).
484,156," The only exception Congress made to the requirements of § 309 was to permit temporary license authorizations in cases of 
emergency operations. This exception is set forth in § 309(f): When an application subject to subsection (b) of this section has been filed, the Commission, notwithstanding the 
requirements of such subsection, may, if the grant of such application is otherwise authorized by law and if it finds that 
there are extraordinary circumstances requiring emergency operations in the public interest and that delay in the institution 
of such emergency operations would seriously prejudice the public interest, grant a temporary authorization, accompanied 
by a statement of its reasons therefor, to permit such emergency operations for a period not exceeding ninety days, and 
upon making like findings may extend such temporary authorization for one additional period not to exceed ninety days. 
When any such grant for a temporary authorization is made, the Commission shall give expeditious treatment to any timely 
filed petition to deny such application and to any petition for rehearing of such grant filed under section 405 of this title. "
485,47," U.S.C. § 309(f) (1976). The Commission's authority under § 309(f) is extremely cabined. The only time the Commission may consider the need for 
expedition as an element of the decision as to which procedures to employ is in electing whether to proceed pursuant to 
subsection (f) or subsection (e). According to the Senate Report accompanying the 1960 amendments, § 309(d) ""provides a 
safety valve to protect the public interest in those rare cases in which the Commission finds that the delay required by 
subsection [309(a)] would seriously prejudice the public interest."" S. Rep. No. 690, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. 4 (1959). At that time it 
was acknowledged by John C. Doerfer, Chairman of the FCC, that in view of the findings necessary for invoking this section, it is anticipated that it will be rarely used. However, it is felt that it 
does provide the Commission with flexibility to take care of emergency situations where any delay would prejudice the 
public interest, and at the same time would reserve final action on the application until after the objections are disposed of. Id. at 6."
485,157," The Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. § 151 et seq., was amended in several respects in 1960. Section 309 was revised in an 
effort to provide more efficient and meaningful Commission review of objections to license applications filed pursuant to § 
308(a). See text supra at notes 155-163. The 1960 amendments resulted in the replacement of the prior mechanism for 
registering such objections with a new procedure. Prior to 1952, § 309 required the Commission to grant a license application if it 
found it in the public interest to do so. If the Commission was unable to make such a finding, it was to notify the applicant and 
provide an opportunity for a hearing on the matter. In 1952, the section was amended to allow parties in interest to protest any 
license granted by the Commission within 30 days of this action. Protestants were required to include in their pleadings 
statements demonstrating their interest in the matter, and they were to specify, on the basis of information and belief, see note 
188 infra, facts evidencing the impropriety of granting the license. The Commission was required to rule on protests within thirty 
days, and to designate a hearing on a license with respect to which a sufficient protest had been filed. In 1956, § 309 was again 
amended, in order to permit the Commission to dispense with the hearing requirement where no ground for setting aside the 
license grant existed, even if the facts were as alleged in the petition. The 1960 amendments also altered the notice 
requirements devised in 1952. See note 169 infra."
485,158," The current statutory scheme works as follows. Pursuant to subsection (a), the Commission is directed to grant any 
application whenever the grant would serve the public interest, convenience, and necessity. With a few special exceptions 
provided in subsection (c), however, the Commission is directed by subsection (b) to hold each application for at least 30 days 
following the issuance of public notice by the Commission of the acceptance of the application for filing. Subsection (d) provides 
the means by which parties may object to license applications. Combined with subsection (e), which sets forth the evidentiary 
hearing requirements, subsection (d) sets forth the new pre-grant procedure devised in 1960. See text supra at notes 134-139. 
Subsection (f) provides temporary emergency authorization power, see note 156 supra; subsection (g) provides that the 
Commission must adopt reasonable classifications for applications and amendments; and subsection (h) provides for the form 
and condition of station licenses."

sized earth stations available in most instances at the customer's premises; (2) integrated voice/data/image transmission 
service utilizing a largely digital format; (3) A TDMA and demand assignment technology which allows more efficient use of 
the spectrum than present use allows; and (4) the 12 and 14 GHz band. The most important aspect of this proposal is not "

489,184, 47 U.S.C. § 309(d) (1) (1976).
489,185," Both petitions begin with specific allegations charging that the SBS joint venture in its current form fails to comply with the 
conditions prescribed by the Commission in its earlier decisions on the matter. With respect to the antitrust problems with the 
joint venture, the following illustrations serve as examples of the specificity of the petitions. One part of Western Union's petition 
alleges that the relevant markets must be defined. After making several legal arguments, Western Union states that its 
""marketing experts and the SBS Applications recognize that the principal customers for domestic satellite service will be large 
corporations and the federal government. These organizations presently generate almost three-quarters of the interstate private 
line communications revenues."" App. 1043-1044 (footnote omitted). This statement is supported both by the affidavit of an officer 
of Western Union, H. R. Johnson, and a quote from one of SBS' applications. App. 1043 & n.34. On the basis of these 
allegations Western Union proceeds to state its reasons why the relevant markets must be defined, specifying its views about 
the cross-elasticity of demand for satellite and terrestrial services and other relevant considerations. These allegations support 
the material issue Western Union raises over the accuracy of the ultimate factual conclusion, accepted by the Commission, that 
there is only one market because all forms of telecommunications--both terrestrial and satellite--are reasonably interchangeable. 
Similarly, with respect to its allegations concerning the question of the effects of the SBS entry on potential competition, Western 
Union cites, among other sources, the Commission's own findings--a proper subject of official notice--that IBM has the economic 
and technical resources required for independent and sustained entry into the domestic satellite industry. See Approval of 
Changes in Corporate Structure of CML Satellite Corporation (CML), 51 F.C.C.2d 14, 26, 27, 39-41 (1975) [hereinafter cited as 
CML]. American Satellite also alleges that the entry of SBS will result in elimination of potential competition, citing IBM's own 
concession at the oral argument in the CML proceeding--again a proper subject of official notice-- CML, supra, at 30 (Nov. 25, 
1975) (transcript of oral argument). IBM stated that it had considered independent entry, and that it likely would proceed alone if 
necessary. App. 1113. To some extent the petitions also rely on legal arguments, citing Supreme Court and other federal cases requiring evidentiary 
hearings in proceedings of this type, see, e.g., App. 1041-1042, and they include considerable economic analysis. There is no 
question that through citation to specific facts in their possession and reference to sources of which the Commission may take 
official notice, combined with legal and economic analysis, Western Union and IBM raised substantial disputed issues of fact."

489,187," The language with respect to specificity of factual allegations in the petitions, see text supra at note 184, was to ensure that

D.C. 39, 42 (1968). This decision, however, must be reversed if it is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law. While in a proper 
case such an exercise of administrative discretion must be given considerable deference, an act or omission that clearly 
contraverts the governing statute cannot be tolerated. See text at note 132 supra. See also note 154 supra."
491,199," See notes 132, 154, 198 supra. I am unable to detect the value the court attaches to Columbus Broadcasting Coalition v. 
FCC, 505 F.2d 320, 164 U.S. App. D.C. 213 (1974). See Maj. Op. at note 84. Of four contentions that the public interest 
question on a license-renewal application was laden with substantial fact issues, one was never presented to the Commission, 
another left decisive evidence entirely unrebutted, and each of the remaining two rested on factual premises too innocuous in 
any event to generate a dispute material to the outcome. Id. at 218-223, 505 F.2d at 325-330. Moreover, there the Commission 
itself determined that no material fact remained in dispute, while in the instant case the court itself has conjured up this position, 
failing to come to grips with the Commission's own rationale for its procedures. See note 194 supra. Thus the claimed similarity 
of this situation to that at bar is lost on me. "

492,203," In United States v. CAB, 511 F.2d 1315, 167 U.S. App. D.C. 313 (1975), we noted that there is a special need for factual 
findings with respect to antitrust issues because such grounds are unusually ""complex, requiring painstaking assessment of many relevant considerations."" As a 
result, such ""issues are particularly suited to resolution by evidentiary hearing. . . . Disposition of antitrust questions by other 
means creates a greater likelihood of administrative error, and invites a more skeptical judicial scrutiny."" Id. at 323, 511 F.2d at 1325 (footnotes omitted). Similarly, in Marine Space Enclosures, Inc. v. FMC, 420 F.2d 577, 137 U.S. 
App. D.C. 9 (1969), we noted that ""ordinarily,…antitrust issues do not lend themselves to disposition solely on briefs and 
argument."" Id. at 21, 420 F.2d at 589. It has also been held that even in cases where the underlying facts are undisputed, 
summary judgment is inappropriate where conflicting inferences can be drawn from these facts. See, e.g., Carroll v. American 
Fed'n of Musicians, 35 F.R.D. 535, 539-540 (S.D.N.Y. 164); United States v. United Scenic Artists Local 829, Brotherhood of 
Painters, 27 F.R.D. 499, 501 (S.D.N.Y. 1961)."
492,204," Moreover, in attempting to make such an assumption, the Commission must give the antitrust laws the full consideration to 
which they are entitled. The Commission is correct in asserting that the Sherman and Clayton Acts assume that promotion of 
competition in and of itself serves the public interest, while competitive effects are but one element of the public interest 
determination in the communications field. See Satellite Business Sys., supra note 141, at 1069. Antitrust problems are an 
important factor, however, as the Supreme Court has emphasized on a number of occasions. See notes 10-12, 58-63 supra and 
accompanying text. As we stated in Northern Natural Gas Co. v. FPC, supra note 103, the antitrust laws and regulation by 
administrative agencies are intended to be complementary. An ""example of their common purpose is that both types of 
regulation seek to establish an atmosphere which will stimulate innovations for better service at a lower cost."" 399 F.2d at 959, 
130 U.S. App. D.C. at 226. See also note 197 supra. Another example of the complementary nature of antitrust laws and 
administrative regulation is the enforcement authority given to certain agencies, including the FCC, under § 11 of the Clayton 
Act, 15 U.S.C. § 21(a) (1976). See note 12 supra and accompanying text. See also Northern Natural Gas Co. v. FPC, supra

cannot be put to a subjective test. It is not 'susceptible of a ready and precise answer.'"" Maj. Op., text at note 101. In Penn-Olin, 
however, this statement was made by the Court in rejecting a District Court's finding that no reason existed to conclude that a 
firm formed by the merger of two corporations would be a less effective competitive force than the two separate entities, even if 
only one actually entered the market and the other remained in the wings. The Court concluded ""that a finding should have been 
made as to the reasonable probability that either one of the corporations would have entered the market . . . or the other would 
have remained a significant potential competitor."" Id. at 175-176, 84 S. Ct. at 1719, 12 L. Ed. 2d at 788. The Court went on to 
note generally criteria which the District Court could take into account in assessing the potential anticompetitive effects: The number and power of the competitors in the relevant market; the background of their growth; the power of the joint 
venturers; the relationship of their lines of commerce; the competition existing between them and the power of each in 
dealing with the competitors of the other; the setting in which the joint venture was created; the reasons and necessities for 
its existence; the joint venture's line of commerce and the relationship thereof to that of its parents; the adaptability of its 
line of commerce to noncompetitive practices; the potential power of the joint venture in the relevant market; an appraisal of 
what the competition in the relevant market would have been if one of the joint venturers had entered it alone. . . ; the 
effect, in the event of this occurrence, of the other joint venturer's potential competition; and such other factors as might 
indicate potential risk to competition in the relevant market. Id. at 177, 85 S. Ct. at 1720, 12 L. Ed. 2d at 789. Penn-Olin thus does not stand for the proposition that further inquiry need not be undertaken where the disputed facts are 
""incapable of definite ascertainment."" To the contrary, the Court required that such an inquiry be carefully conducted. Similarly, 
in United States v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., 410 U.S. 526, 93 S. Ct. 1096, 35 L. Ed. 2d 475 (1973), also cited by the court, see 
Maj. Op. at note 101, the court's criticism of the District Court's dependence on the testimony of corporate officials was made in 
the context of assigning error to the District Court's assumption that because Falstaff would never have entered the market de 
novo, it could in no sense be considered a potential competitor. The outcome of Falstaff was a decision by the Supreme Court 
that the District Court should have considered whether the corporation was a potential competitor exercising influence on the 
market from its fringes. Again this is a directive to undertake study of antitrust questions carefully, especially where such issues 
are not readily susceptible to absolute proof. Moreover, if all facts incapable of definite ascertainment could be determined without benefit of evidentiary proceedings, 
hearings would never be held in cases where violations of § 7 of the Clayton Act were alleged, because § 7 looks toward future 
economic behavior and ""can deal only with probabilities, not with certainties."" FTC v. Procter & Gamble Co., 386 U.S. 568, 577, 
87 S. Ct. 1224, 1229, 18 L. Ed. 2d 303, 309 (1967)."

useful. Expert discretion is secured, not crippled, by the requirements for substantial evidence, findings and reasoned analysis. 
Expertise is strengthened in its proper role as the servant of government when it is denied the opportunity to ""become a

intimate terms with the communications industry than the federal courts, it is not necessarily more expert in handling the antitrust 
matters. Even if the Commission were expert in all aspects of the antitrust field, however, this would still not excuse its failure to 
hold an evidentiary hearing as required by statute where disputed questions of material fact existed."

503,4," Two Supreme Court decisions have held maximum resale price agreements to be illegal per se.  Albrecht v. Herald Co., 390 
U.S. 145, 88 S. Ct. 869, 19 L. Ed. 2d 998 (1968); Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, 340 U.S. 211, 71 S. Ct. 259,

Ed. 2d 56 (1967). This circuit has not extended those rulings to horizontal agreements that establish maximum prices.  For an 
argument that the extension is proper, see L. Sullivan, Antitrust 210 (1977).  A consequence of the extension, however, would 
be to moot an aspect of the currently lively debate concerning ""limit-pricing"" and predatory price-cutting.  See 643 F.2d at 558-
560 infra.  It can hardly be said, then, that a per se rule forbidding horizontal maximum price agreements is well settled.  It is 
arguable that this case does not present the issue for our decision.  The FMC membership agreements do not set price ceilings 
for given services across the board but only limit the fees recoverable from certain patients, namely, those covered by FMC-
approved insurance policies. "
504,5," HN4[
] When a questioned business practice affects more than one sphere of competition, the Rule of Reason of course 
recognizes that the enhancement of competition in one sphere may offset the weakening of competition in another.  Sometimes, 
for example, ""both interbrand and intrabrand competition must be considered"", First Beverages, Inc. v. Royal Crown Cola Co., 
612 F.2d 1164, 1170 n.8 (9th Cir. 1980), although not every case requires extensive analysis of these multiple effects or jury 
instructions concerning them, id. at 1170-72. Here the novelty of the market or markets and the inadequacy of the record make 
an inquiry into the affected areas of competition essential."
504,6," There is no disagreement about what constitutes predatory pricing. It is ""pricing at a level calculated to exclude from the 
market an equally or more efficient competitor,"" R. Posner, supra, at 188, ""conduct which has the purpose and effect of 
advancing the actor's competitive position, not by improving the actor's market performance, but by threatening to injure or 
injuring (competitors), so as to drive them or keep them out of the market, or force them to compete less effectively,"" L. Sullivan, 
supra, at 108.  But while this definition of predatory behavior stresses anticompetitive intent, business tactics are exceptionally 
resistant to state-of-mind analysis.  Antitrust theorists have therefore gravitated toward purely economic definitions.  For 
example, Areeda and Turner propose that the courts regard as predatory pricing, policies that yield returns below average or 
marginal cost, whichever is lowest.  Areeda & Turner, supra.  Since marginal and average cost include a normal return on 
capital, however, the difficulties of determining the normal return for the firm in question make this proposal a demanding one for 
the courts to implement.  See L. Sullivan, supra, at 110; R. Posner, supra, at 191-93.  Posner believes that a modified form of 
the below-cost pricing criterion is appropriate.  Id. at 188-91.  Although this court has entertained the possibility of proving 
predation by marginal or average cost statistics, Hanson v. Shell Oil Co., 541 F.2d 1352 (9th Cir. 1976), we have not held that 
mode of proof to be exclusive, id. at 1358 (""(Predatory pricing) could be shown by evidence"" of below cost pricing (emphasis 
added) ); cf.  Janich Bros., Inc. v. American Distilling Co., 570 F.2d 848, 858 (9th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 829, 99 S. 
Ct. 103, 58 L. Ed. 2d 122 (1978) (""Thus, as stated in Hanson, average variable cost can be used as evidence of marginal "
505,," cost."").  More recently, the court has recognized ""that refinement of the marginal or average variable cost test will be necessary 
as future cases arise."" California Computer Products, Inc. v. International Business Machines Corp., 613 F.2d 727, 743 (9th Cir. 
1979) (citing Williamson, supra, among other recent commentators on predatory pricing).  Since there is no contention before us 
that predation has occurred, we note only that our skepticism about limit-pricing in no way discredits theories of predation."
505,7," The district court reasoned that since ""the agreements between physicians participating in the foundation-approved plans and the insurers underwriting the plans … 
spread no risk peculiar to the business of insurance, the McCarran-Ferguson Act exemption does not apply to exempt the 
defendants' conduct from possible antitrust liability …."" Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Society, No. CIV-78-800 PHX WPC (D.Ariz. June 11, 1979) (memorandum and order), 
Designated Record at 22-24.  The parties before us have not attacked that holding.  Recently, however, the Fourth Circuit 
decided that a chiropractors' association performing peer review and fee supervision on behalf of health insurers was within the 
exemption. Bartholomew v. Virginia Chiropractors Ass'n, 612 F.2d 812 (4th Cir. 1979). The Bartholomew court explained that 
""the procurement of drugs,"" with which Group Life and Health Insurance Co. v. Royal Drug Co., 440 U.S. 205, 99 S. Ct. 1067, 59 
L. Ed. 2d 261 (1979) dealt, was ""admittedly an act only thinly tangential to … the business of insurance,"" whereas the 
chiropractors' association played a part in insurance as ""a single, composite business."" Bartholomew, supra, at 817. We express 
no opinion regarding the validity of this distinction. "
507,1," Although the district court's June 5, 1979, memorandum is well reasoned, it displays a misperception of the current state of 
antitrust analysis.  The district court felt that per se rules were being supplanted by greater use of the rule of reason. A careful 
survey of recent decisions discloses that not only are per se rules continuing to be applied in traditional areas like price-fixing, 
but they are also being extended to encompass new anticompetitive practices.  The Supreme Court has continually reaffirmed 
the value of per se rules, especially when applied to conduct affecting pricing. Maximum price-fixing clearly has been and should 
be regarded as per se illegal, particularly in a horizontal context.  See text, infra 643 F.2d at 563. The Kallstrom article referred to 
by the district court takes the position that maximum price setting among individual medical providers should be per se illegal, 
especially when done by a Foundation for Medical Care. Kallstrom, Health Care Cost Control by Third-Party Payors, 1978 Duke 
L.J. 645, 680-83. Finally, the district court felt that professionals were accorded special treatment under the antitrust laws. 
Supreme Court and other decisions, however, indicate that when commercial practices of a profession are at issue, per se rules 
may be applied, particularly if the challenged activity affects price.  See text, infra, 643 F.2d at 564-565. The combined effect of 
all these errors requires that the district court at least be ordered to reconsider its refusal to continue the preliminary injunction."
507,2," I have concentrated on the general standards for preliminary injunctions but it should be noted that § 16 of the Sherman Act, 
15 U.S.C. § 26, also governs preliminary relief under the antitrust laws. Much of the procedural difficulty here could have been 
avoided by closer adherence to the requirements of Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, particularly after defendants 
objected to the April 30 continuation of Paragraph 6. "
508,3," This continuum approach has been utilized by several circuit courts of appeals.  See Chromalloy American Corp. v. Sun 
Chemical Corp., supra; Maryland Undercoating Co. v. Payne, 603 F.2d 477, 481 (4th Cir. 1979); Florida Medical Assoc. v. 
United States Dept. of Health, 601 F.2d 199, 202 (5th Cir. 1979); Jackson Dairy, Inc. v. H. P. Hood & Sons, 596 F.2d 70, 72, 74

706 (3d Cir. 1979). One of these courts has suggested that the balance may also work in the opposite direction; the greater the 
movant's likelihood of success, the less the balance of harms must swing in his favor.  See Maryland Undercoating Co. v. 
Payne, supra, at 481 n.8. "

anticompetitive consequences.  Recent studies have concluded that physicians and other health-care providers typically 
dominate the boards of directors of Blue Shield plans.  Thus, there is little incentive on the part of Blue Shield to minimize costs, 
since it is in the interest of the providers to set fee schedules at the highest possible level.  This domination of Blue Shield by 
providers is said to have resulted in rapid escalation of health-care costs to the detriment of consumers generally."" "

511,11," In Broadcast Music the Supreme Court's major concern was the danger of too-quick characterization of conduct as price-
fixing. Placing activity in the per se illegal price-fixing category essentially forecloses the issue of liability against the defendant.  
Therefore, care must be taken to ascertain that the conduct is indeed a traditional form of price-fixing, or a variant displaying 
similar anticompetitive aspects.  The Court felt that defendant's behavior in Broadcast Music was not traditional price-fixing. 441 
U.S. at 23, 99 S. Ct. at 1564 (""the blanket license cannot be wholly equated with a simple horizontal arrangement among 
competitors"").  Defendant was already subject to antitrust decrees, id. at 10-16, 99 S. Ct. at 1557-1560, and was seen as 
performing a middleman function, id. at 19-23, 99 S. Ct. at 1562-1564. See Comment, 91 Harv.L.Rev. 488 (1977) (author's 
analysis apparently followed by Supreme Court). Here we are examining conduct which is a customary form of price-fixing between competitors, 441 U.S. at 8, 99 S. Ct. at 1556 
(""(Agreements) among competitors to fix prices on their individual goods or services are among those concerted activities that 
the Court has held to be within the per se category.""), and the deficiencies of ""analysis by characterization"" are not a problem.  In 
my view, the fact that defendants' activity is conventional price-fixing makes this second area of inquiry unnecessary in this case. "
512,," What is different here is not the challenged practice itself, but the industry in which it occurs.  As I stated above at  --  F.2d at  --

512,12," Civil liability under the Sherman Act may be predicated on a finding of either an unlawful purpose or an anticompetitive effect.

here was to fix prices and to suppress competition.  These are per se unlawful purposes.  It may not be necessary to assess the 
actual competitive effects of the controverted behavior where the unlawful purpose is clear."

513,14," See Havighurst, Controlling Health Care Costs, supra, at 485."
513,15," The fee schedule also poses potential anticompetitive problems as a price information exchange.  The schedule was widely 
disseminated and could be used by doctors who were not Foundation members and could be used to bill clients not covered by 
the third-party payors. In this way the schedule would have an even greater impact on prices.  This price information sharing 
relates to the level of price and does not seem to have a market-perfecting function.  As such it is particularly dangerous.  See 
United States v. United States Gypsum Co., supra, 438 U.S. at 441 n.16, 98 S. Ct. at 2875 n.16; L. Sullivan, supra, at §§ 93-96;

v. United States, 449 F.2d 846, 851 n.1 (5th Cir. 1971)."
518,2," The district court limited the trial to the liability issue, with a trial on damages, if necessary, to follow. "
519,3," TV Signal did not own the distribution system for two years. Its assets, including the distribution system, were sold less than a 
year after it formally accepted the system.  TV Signal Co. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 465 F. Supp. at 1095."
519,4," The plaintiff adduced evidence that burying the cable was not only more expensive but detracted from its overall efficiency and 
use.  In 1969 the cable industry had not yet developed satisfactory underground cable and accessories for use in a CATV 
system.  TV Signal used aerial cable in its underground system and there was some evidence that aerial cable which was used 
underground would corrode rapidly.  Underground construction was normally slower and maintenance expenses were greater.  
As a result of these and other difficulties, plaintiff claimed that aerial construction was far more desirable than underground 
construction."
519,5," Numerous cases have granted standing to plaintiffs who continued to make a profit or made a profit in the sale of their 
business, in spite of being the victim of an antitrust violation. Actually, this argument is a form of the pass-on theory i. e. because 
the plaintiff could or did charge a higher price and made a profit it is not entitled to recover.  This theory has been consistently 
rejected.  Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 728, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 2066, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977); accord, Hanover Shoe,

519,6," The district court's finding specifically supports the conclusion that Bell's conduct was the proximate cause of the injury.  TV 
Signal Co. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 465 F. Supp. at 1092. "
522,7," In finding no competitive injury the district court relied in part on this court's decision in Reiter v. Sonotone, 579 F.2d 1077 (8th 
Cir. 1978). The opinion of the district court was handed down on February 16, 1979, before the Supreme Court's unanimous 
reversal of this court in Reiter v. Sonotone, 442 U.S. 330, 99 S. Ct. 2326, 60 L. Ed. 2d 931 (1979). That case makes it clear that 
competitors are not the only persons who have standing under 15 U.S.C. § 15. Bell argues as it did on the first appeal, that it is not illegal to enter into an exclusive dealing contract, as it had done here, 
allowing use of its facilities (poles) to only one operator. It relies on numerous cases: Donovan v. Pennsylvania Co., 199 U.S. 
279, 26 S. Ct. 91, 50 L. Ed. 192 (1905); Black & White Taxicab & Transfer Co. v. Brown & Yellow Taxicab & Transfer Co., 276

(1962). These cases (sometimes called the ""Terminal"" cases) are clearly distinguishable because in the present case there 
exists evidence that the purpose of Bell's exclusion policy was to coerce operators to utilize Bell's own equipment, thus yielding 
greater revenue to Bell, and deterring independent operators from entering the CATV and potential broadband communications 
fields."
522,8," HN5[
] There exist two requirements under section 1 of the Sherman Act for proof of relevant market: Plaintiff must establish (1) the relevant geographic market, and (2) the relevant product market. The evidence strongly suggests that the relevant 
geographic market is Aberdeen.  The relevant product market relates to the development of a distribution system and the 
distribution of CATV signals. Defendants' one per pole policy tends to eliminate competition in the development of distribution 
systems and the distribution of CATV signals. Neither relevant product market nor relevant geographic market were discussed 
by the trial court once it determined that TV Signal did not compete with Bell.  We feel in light of the remand the trial court should 
make specific factual findings related to the evidence on these issues.  Although plaintiff asserts there is no requirement of proof 
of relevant market under section 1 of the Sherman Act in contrast to section 2, we disagree.  HN6[
] No proof of relevant market is required under section 1 where a per se violation is established.  See, e. g., United States v. Topco Assocs., Inc., 405 
U.S. 596, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515 (1972); Radiant Burners, Inc. v. Peoples Gas Light & Coke Co., 364 U.S. 656, 81 S. 
Ct. 365, 5 L. Ed. 2d 358 (1961); 1 von Kalinowski, Antitrust Laws and Trade Regulation, Ch. 6 (1979).  However, where the Rule 
of Reason governs in section 1 cases, proof of relevant market is necessary to demonstrate the unreasonableness of the

534,4," But see Council of Defense v. International Magazine Co., 267 F. 390 (8th Cir. 1920), wherein a state-created Council of 
Defense sought to boycott a publishing company because of the pro-German sympathies of stockholder William Randolph 
Hearst.  In Council of Defense, this court found that the Council's actions did violate the Sherman Act. However, it is significant "
535,," to note that our court held in that case that ""(t)he declared and obvious purpose was to destroy complainant's business in New 
Mexico."" Id. at 411. In the immediate case, no such purpose exists in fact, there was a specific finding by the district court that there was no punitive 
purpose in NOW's boycott in the sense that it was designed to punish for past conduct.  The economic coercion of the boycott 
was designed to procure affirmative action by the Missouri legislature.  In Council of Defense there was economic punishment 
for past actions; in the instant case there is economic injury to achieve immediate or future action. Further, a more basic distinction is that Council of Defense did not involve any issue of the right to petition, a fundamental 
consideration in the instant case and in Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 
S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961). There can be drawn a distinction between political speech and petitioning of the government.  
At some point, a line must be drawn; this is not the case in which it is necessary to draw the line. State v. Horsemen's Benevolent & Protective Ass'n, 55 A.D.2d 251, 389 N.Y.S.2d 868 (1976) does consider a very similar 
issue, although the Sherman Act was not involved.  In that case, an association of horse owners engaged in a boycott of horse 
racing (in order to pressure the state to finance an employee pension plan, the cost of which would otherwise fall on the 
association's members), causing a cessation of racing at Aqueduct.  The state brought an action against the association under 
the New York State ""Little Sherman Antitrust Act"" for damages.  The court disposed of the issue we find so troublesome in this 
case with the statement ""(t)his was not merely an attempt to influence legislation, see Eastern R. Conf. v. Noerr Motor Freight, 
365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961) * * *."" State v. Horsemen's Benevolent & Protective Ass'n, supra, 389 
N.Y.S.2d at 869. We do not find the court's reasoning persuasive. See also Mark Aero, Inc. v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 580 F.2d 288 (8th Cir. 1978)."
535,5," Examples of political boycotts include the boycott of Florida citrus products which was to protest against the Miami referendum 
withdrawing protection for gay civil rights, and the refusal by colonists to import British goods in order to communicate the 
strength of public feeling against the Stamp and Townsend Acts early in our country's history. One of the more famous political boycotts occurred in Montgomery, Alabama, to protest the racial segregation and discrimination 
on city buses.  There have been consumer boycotts on meat, supermarkets, grapes, iced tea in cans, sugar or soft drinks, 
slacks, lettuce, textiles, chocolate, Saran Wrap, Mexico, tuna, animal skins and furs, Russian products and Japanese products. The term boycott was derived from a method of retaliation used against a land agent, Captain Boycott, who paid starvation 
wages to tenants and then evicted those who protested these wages.  Tenants rallied the support of Boycott's servants, herders 
and drivers, and all agreed to cease relations with the Boycott family.  See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 264 
(1971)."
535,6," The legislative history of the Sherman Act is comprehensively compiled and edited in 1 E. Kintner, The Legislative History of 
the Federal Antitrust Laws and Related Statutes (1978).  See also Letwin, Congress and the Sherman Antitrust Law: 1887-
1890, 23 U.Chi.L.Rev. 221 (1956). Letwin examines the political mood of the country during the years that Congress discussed 
and passed the Sherman Act. "
536,7," The argument that the Sherman Act should cover, i. e., all boycotts regardless of motivation, purpose, ultimate goal, etc., is 
that without coverage, groups would be able to pool economic power in pursuit of private goals with ""no more than self-imposed 
restraints on harms caused to others.  The danger is in the collective possession of power itself * * *."" Bird, Sherman Act 
Limitations on Noncommercial Concerted Refusals to Deal, 1970 Duke L.J. 247, 260 (1970)."
536,8," Kintner points out in his book that Senator James Z. George (D., Miss.), played a significant role in shaping the Sherman Act. 
1 E. Kintner, supra at 15. "
540,9," For example, note the Supreme Court's language in Fashion Originators' Guild of America, Inc. v. FTC, 312 U.S. 457, 61 S. 
Ct. 703, 85 L. Ed. 949 (1941). In reference to a discussion of whether or not the challenged practice (a boycott) was reasonable, 
necessary and beneficial, the Court stated: As we have pointed out, however, the aim of petitioners' combination was the intentional destruction of one type of manufacture 
and sale which competed with Guild members.  The purpose and object of this combination, its potential power, its tendency to 
monopoly, the coercion it could and did practice upon a rival method of competition, all brought it within the policy of the 
prohibition declared by the Sherman and Clayton Acts. Id. at 467-68, 61 S. Ct. at 708 (emphasis added).  The Court's language indicates that the Court conducted its analysis 
assuming that the category of acts which the Sherman Act condemned were those within the competitive business economy of 
the United States. We do not mean to overemphasize any reliance upon this type of implicit reference to competitors' practices made by the Court; 
indeed, we fully recognize that there are probably just as many statements that do not contain such qualifying language.  For 
example, there are comprehensive statements such as follows: HN1[
] Section 1 of that Act makes illegal every contract, combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states; § 2 makes illegal every combination or conspiracy which monopolizes or attempts to monopolize any part of 
that trade or commerce. Id. at 465, 61 S. Ct. at 707 (emphasis added). "
541,10," The Court states that boycotts have long been forbidden and cites Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 340 U.S. 211, 
213, 71 S. Ct. 259, 260, 95 L. Ed. 219 (1951) ""such agreements * * * cripple the freedom of traders"" in emphasizing the disfavor 
with which the courts have viewed boycotts. Additionally, Klor's has been interpreted as standing for the proposition that boycotts 
are illegal per se.  Handler, Recent Developments in Antitrust Law: 1958-1959, 59 Colum.L.Rev. 840, 862 (1959). However, 
even in the portion of its opinion in Klor's where the Court addresses the crippling effects of boycotts, the Court focuses upon 
""(g)roup boycotts, or concerted refusals by traders to deal with other traders * * *."" Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., 
supra, 359 U.S. at 212, 79 S. Ct. at 709 (emphasis added). "
542,11," Parker v. Brown, supra, of course, deals with the content of legislation by its state action exemption. "
543,12," Further, the factual setting which Missouri depicts as the background to its ""secondary boycott theory"" ignores the posture of 
the case.  Missouri paints the picture thus: NOW is withholding all convention business from the Holiday-Johnson Motel (HJM) 
until HJM goes to its legislator and convinces its legislator to vote for the ratification of the proposed ERA.  This characterization 
of the facts portrays HJM as the target of NOW's boycott. The target of the boycott was not HJM; it was the State of Missouri.  It 
was the State of Missouri which suffered financial loss and which had standing to sue, not ""to prosecute purely personal claims 
of its citizens, * * * but * * * to protect the public interest."" Missouri v. NOW, supra, 467 F. Supp. at 301, quoting Kelley v. Carr, 
442 F. Supp. 346, 357 (W.D.Mich.1977). Further, the facts clearly reveal, and the district court so found, that there were no 
punitive intentions involved in the boycott insofar as punishment for Missouri's past failure to ratify the ERA was concerned. We find Missouri's focus on the facts of this case and not the the district court's misleading.  The district court's view is more 
appropriate for the issues at hand.  NOW's boycott was directed against states that had yet to ratify the proposed ERA.  NOW 
was aware that such a boycott would work against the public's economic interests; NOW was hopeful that the public's interest 
would suffer to the extent that the public would be persuaded that ratification of the ERA was ""desirable; "" NOW wanted the 
public to influence the legislature to ratify the ERA; NOW operated on the presumption that legislators act with regard for the 
public interest.  This is not distinguishable analytically from Noerr."
543,13," In essence, Missouri tries to limit Noerr to a case where a combination uses publicity to get a law passed that would harm the 
truckers. Noerr is more than a Parker v. Brown, supra, state action exemption case.  The Court in Noerr discusses the publicity 
campaign apart from the substantive effect of the legislation. "
544,14," See text accompanying note 12, supra. "
545,15," It is important to remember that the district court specifically found that the motivation of NOW was to be viewed from two 
points, both aimed at the legislative process.  These two points were (1) the desire of NOW to make a symbolic gesture and (2) 
the desire of NOW to create publicity, i. e., attract attention and bring public visibility to the issue of ratification. State of Missouri 
v. National Organization for Women, Inc., supra, 467 F. Supp. at 295."
545,16," The State of Missouri cites Hennessey v. NCAA, 564 F.2d 1136, 1147-49 (5th Cir. 1977); Young v. Motion Picture Ass'n of 
America, Inc., 112 U.S.App.D.C. 35, 299 F.2d 119 (D.C.Cir.), cert. denied, 370 U.S. 922, 82 S. Ct. 1565, 8 L. Ed. 2d 504 (1962);

(D.C.Cir.1969) for the proposition that the Sherman Act applies to noncommercial and non-economic boycotts. We do not decide 
that issue.  The Sherman Act may apply in some situations to noncommercial and non-economic boycotts. However, we do not 
rest our decision in this case upon the basis that the boycott was noncommercial and non-economic.  Our decision is based 
upon the right to use political activities to petition the government, as was the underlying factor in Noerr.  None of the cases cited 
above involved the political right to petition the government, thus it is not necessary in this case to distinguish them. The same is true of Council of Defense v. International Magazine Co., 267 F. 390 (8th Cir. 1920). See note 4 infra. "
546,," Other courts have been more generous and have equated noncommercial activities with a political right to petition the 
government.  See, i. e., Council for Employment & Economic Energy Use v. WHDH Corp., 580 F.2d 9 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 
440 U.S. 945, 99 S. Ct. 1421, 59 L. Ed. 2d 633 (1978). It is not necessary, under the facts of our case, for our ruling to be so 
broad. "
548,17," An important exception to this statement is United Mine Workers of America v. Pennington, supra, 381 U.S. at 669-72, 85 S. 
Ct. at 1592-94. In ""Pennington "" (as in ""Noerr-Pennington doctrine"") the Court's reference to Noerr is rather undramatic and 
rather unenlightening insofar as what general application the Court plans to give Noerr in the future.  It is surprising, however, 
only to the extent that one expects more out of the Pennington of ""Noerr-Pennington ;"" the facts of Pennington, however, require 
the Supreme Court only to reiterate that Noerr ""shields from the Sherman Act a concerted effort to influence public officials 
regardless of intent or purpose."" Id. at 670, 85 S. Ct. at 1593 (emphasis added). In Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., supra, 435 U.S. at 399-400 n.17, 98 S. Ct. at 1130 n.17, the Supreme Court noted 
the Pennington holding and added: ""Subsequent cases (to Pennington ) have emphasized the possible constitutional infirmity in 
the antitrust laws that a contrary construction would entail in light of the serious threat to First Amendment freedoms that would 
have been presented."" Other exceptions to this statement are Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., supra, and National Society of Professional Engineers v. 
United States, supra."
548,18," See also California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, supra, 404 U.S. at 517, 92 S. Ct. at 615 (Stewart, J., with 
whom Brennan, J., joins, concurring in the judgment) (Noerr explicitly holds that the joint exercise of the constitutional right of 
petition is given immunity from the antitrust laws). "
549,1," The State of Missouri also argues that certain of the District Court's findings of fact are clearly erroneous, and that the court 
erred in concluding that the boycott was beyond the scope of the Missouri Antitrust Law and in concluding that the boycott was 
privileged activity, not actionable in tort under Missouri law.  Missouri contends that the factual findings regarding the motivation 
for the boycott are clearly erroneous because they fail to acknowledge the intention to inflict economic harm.  In fact, however, 
the District Court found that ""NOW and the other groups also intended that the adverse economic impact of the boycott on those 
who would otherwise profit from conventions in Missouri would cause those persons to influence their legislators to support ERA 
ratification."" 467 F. Supp. at 295. Missouri apparently intends to argue that the District Court erred in not according this factor 
greater weight in determining whether Congress intended the boycott to be subject to antitrust regulation.  The latter two 
arguments primarily involve contentions subsumed in other issues raised, in particular whether the District Court made an 
appropriate first amendment analysis."
549,2," These terms are used in the sense defined by Bird, in Sherman Act Limitations on Noncommercial Concerted Refusals to 
Deal, 1970 Duke L.J. 247, 249 (footnote omitted): A group's purpose will be considered commercial if the objective is profit, and the group is composed entirely of businessmen.  A 
group's purpose is economic if the objective is the advancement of the group's economic self-interest and is not a commercial 
purpose as defined above.  A group's purpose is noneconomic if it has ""no substantial content of material self-interest."" "
550,," Professor Coons initially established this framework in Coons, Non-Commercial Purpose as a Sherman Act Defense, 56 
NW.U.L.Rev. 705, 708 (1962)."
550,3," The District Court states: ""(T)he issue in this case * * * is whether NOW's actions, which are themselves an exercise of first 
amendment rights, constitute a violation of the Sherman Act."" 467 F. Supp. 289, 304 (E.D.Mo.1979) (footnote omitted).  Indeed, 
this formulation of the issue would almost seem rhetorical.  Obviously, first amendment protected activities cannot be outlawed 
by Congress."
550,4," The Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1 (1976), provides in relevant part: Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several 
States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal.  Every person who shall make any contract or engage in any 
combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a felony * * *. The State of Missouri brings this action solely for injunctive relief pursuant to section 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 26 
(1976), which provides in relevant part: Any person, firm, corporation, or association shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief, in any court of the United 
States having jurisdiction over the parties, against threatened loss or damage by violation of the antitrust laws * * *."
550,5," The Rule of Reason has been used to illuminate the true meaning of the first and second sections of the Sherman Act. 
Standard Oil Co., supra, 221 U.S. at 49, 31 S. Ct. at 511. It resorts to common-law traditions to define unreasonable restraints of 
trade and includes all restraints which new times and economic conditions render unreasonable.  Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale 
Stores, Inc., 359 U.S. 207, 211, 79 S. Ct. 705, 708, 3 L. Ed. 2d 741 (1959). It is important to note that this established test to 
define the bounds of antitrust regulation focuses solely upon economic injury to the extent that ""the inquiry is confined to a 
consideration of impact on competitive conditions."" National Society of Professional Engineers v. United States, supra, 435 U.S. 
at 690, 98 S. Ct. at 1364 (footnote omitted). "
551,6," See also United States v. Topco Associates, Inc., 405 U.S. 596, 610, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 1135, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515 (1972), stating: Antitrust laws in general, and the Sherman Act in particular, are the Magna Carta of free enterprise.  They are as important to 
the preservation of economic freedom and our free-enterprise system as the Bill of Rights is to the protection of our fundamental 
personal freedoms.  And the freedom guaranteed each and every business, no matter how small, is the freedom to compete to 
assert with vigor, imagination, devotion, and ingenuity whatever economic muscle it can muster."
551,7," See U.S.Const., art. I, § 8, cl. 3."
551,8," In reaching this conclusion, the majority rejected the implication of coverage that can be derived from the numerous references 
to the comprehensiveness of the statutory language and the emphasis upon protecting against economic injury to victims of 
restraints of trade and from anticompetitive effects.  In Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U.S. 469 at 506-07, 60 S. Ct. 982 at 
999, 84 L. Ed. 1311, the Court noted ""(t)hat the objective of the restraint in the boycott cases * * * was thought to be immaterial 
because the Court viewed the restraint itself * * * to be of a kind regarded as offensive at common law because of its effect in 
curtailing a free market and it was held to offend against the Sherman Act because it effected and was aimed at suppression of "
552,," competition * * *."" Other cases have focused upon the injury to individual businesses from restraints of trade and extrapolated 
from this the injury to free enterprise in the market system as a whole.  See Radiant Burners, Inc. v. Peoples Gas Light & Coke 
Co., 364 U.S. 656, 659, 81 S. Ct. 365, 367, 5 L. Ed. 2d 358 (1961); Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., 359 U.S. 207, 213, 
79 S. Ct. 705, 710, 3 L. Ed. 2d 741 (1959); Paramount Famous Lasky Corp. v. United States, 282 U.S. 30, 42-43, 51 S. Ct. 42, 
44-45, 75 L. Ed. 145 (1930)."
552,9," The first amendment to the United States Constitution states: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the 
freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a 
redress of grievances."
552,10," The District Court premised its conclusion that NOW's activities were more dissimilar to traditional restraints of trade found 
violative of the Sherman Act than the activities in Noerr on the difference between the subject matter of the legislation desired.  
The railroads sought the passage of legislation which would have placed their competitors at an economic disadvantage 
whereas NOW sought the passage of legislation to support a social goal.  This type of analysis poses the threat of judicial 
interference in matters outside the scope of judicial review and was disapproved in Noerr.  365 U.S. at 139, 81 S. Ct. at 530. The 
relative merits or character of lobbying goals is irrelevant to judicial consideration of whether the manner of lobbying may be 
regulated.  ""The Sherman Act, moreover, is not an invitation to de novo judgments by courts as to the desirability of the goals 
sought to be achieved by anticompetitive practices."" Note, ""Political"" Blacklisting in the Motion Picture Industry: A Sherman Act 
Violation, 74 Yale L.J. 567, 579 (1965)."
552,11," See note 2, supra.  These motivation classifications do not attempt to delineate the anticompetitive effect of the conduct 
described by them.  They may, however, aid an evaluation of first amendment claims and a determination of whether the 
interaction of the boycotters is sufficient to find a combination or conspiracy. Great economic injury and interference with free 
market competition can result from a boycott, regardless of its motivation. See Bird, supra, note 2, 1970 Duke L.J. at 261. In a 
sense, ""it would be hard to say that any boycott is purely non-commercial in character.  No matter what the ultimate aim of the 
combination, a boycott generally involves the infliction of some commercial harm upon the person the combination is trying to 
coerce into changing his ways."" Note, Use of Economic Sanctions by Private Groups: Illegality Under the Sherman Act, 30 
U.Chi.L.Rev. 171, 174 (1962). See also Kestenbaum, The Antitrust Challenge to the Arab Boycott: Per Se Theory, Middle East 
Politics, and United States v. Bechtel Corporation, 54 Tex.L.Rev. 1411 (1976); Note, supra note 10, 74 Yale L.J. 567 (1965). "
553,12," In Noerr, the Court stated: ""Insofar as that Act sets up a code of ethics at all, it is a code that condemns trade restraints, not 
political activity, and, as we have already pointed out, a publicity campaign to influence governmental action falls clearly into the 
category of political activity."" 365 U.S. at 140-41, 81 S. Ct. at 531. This statement does not control the disposition of the case 
before us, but rather leaves open the issue of whether a trade restraint intended as a political communication should be 
condemned under the Act.  The Court's reference to the railroads' use of the third-party technique in Noerr does not present an 
analogous circumstance to NOW's use of a boycott. The third-party technique was challenged only on the basis that it 
apparently involved unethical business conduct, not because it created a separate economic tool that could be considered a 
restraint of trade."
553,13," We note that nothing in the antitrust laws would prohibit NOW or other organizations from individually resolving to boycott 
states that have not passed the ERA and then publicizing their resolution.  ""The illegality consists, not in the separate action of 
each, but in the conspiracy and combination of all to prevent any of them from dealing with the (victim)."" Binderup v. Pathe 
Exchange, Inc., 263 U.S. 291, 312, 44 S. Ct. 96, 100, 68 L. Ed. 308 (1923). The Supreme Court recently confronted this distinction between individual and collective action in Brown v. Glines, 444 U.S. 
348, 100 S. Ct. 594, 62 L. Ed. 2d 540 (1980). Brown involved the first amendment right to petition for redress of grievances even 
more directly than the case at bar.  In reviewing military regulations that unquestionably impinge upon conduct involving first 
amendment rights (solicitation of signatures on and circulation of petitions to members of Congress), the Court balanced the first 
amendment interests with the ""substantial government interest unrelated to the suppression of free expression"" sought to be 
protected by the regulations (military effectiveness).   -- - U.S. at  -- , 100 S. Ct. at 599, 62 L. Ed. 2d at 547. Although forwarding 
individual communications to Congress was not restricted, group petitioning was distinguished and held to warrant special 
restrictions on free expression as reasonably necessary to promote the substantial government interest."
553,14," It is difficult to determine where to draw the line in balancing the various interests, and while it is easy to conclude that political 
action should not immunize from antitrust attack behavior that is ""unnecessarily harmful"" to competition, devising a standard to 
implement the appropriate balance and take into account all the necessary factors is difficult.  One standard proposed is: Behavior is ""unnecessarily harmful"" to competition when it is excessively dangerous without being indispensable to the political 
activity. Analysis of whether conduct is indispensable to the political activity depends upon (1) the severity of the danger to "
554,," competition, (2) the availability of a less dangerous alternative, and (3) the customary political character of the challenged 
behavior. Book Review, 11 Rut.-Cam.L.J. 19, 23 n.36 (1979) (citations omitted), restating the standard proposed in 1 Areeda & Turner, 
Antitrust Law: An Analysis of Antitrust Principles and Their Application, PP 201-06 (1978).  See also American 
Communications Assn. v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 397, 70 S. Ct. 674, 683, 94 L. Ed. 925 (1950) (no absolutist test in weighing 
when harmful conduct and substantial interests of society can justify restrictions upon speech)."
554,15," The Supreme Court has previously encountered cases where first amendment interests must give way to antitrust 
enforcement.  In Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co., 336 U.S. 490, 69 S. Ct. 684, 93 L. Ed. 834 (1949), the Court confronted a 
conflict between first amendment rights of peaceful picketers and the state's valid interest in forbidding agreements in restraint of 
trade. In rejecting the picketers' argument that their activity was protected dissemination of information, with violation of the state 
anti-trade restraint laws merely incidental, the Court stated: ""Such an expansive interpretation of the constitutional guarantees of 
speech and press would make it practically impossible ever to enforce laws against agreements in restraint of trade as well as 
many other agreements and conspiracies deemed injurious to society."" 336 U.S. at 502, 69 S. Ct. at 691. In National Society of 
Professional Engineers v. United States, supra, dealing with the curtailment of first amendment rights of expression on 
competitive bidding held to be violative of the antitrust laws, the Court held that: While the resulting order may curtail the exercise of liberties that the Society might otherwise enjoy, that is a necessary and, in 
cases such as this, unavoidable consequence of the violation.  Just as an injunction against price fixing abridges the freedom of 
businessmen to talk to one another about prices, so too the injunction in this case must restrict the Society's range of expression 
on the ethics of competitive bidding."

554,16," For a comprehensive scholarly examination of the thorny first amendment issue in this case, see Note, Political Boycott 
Activity and the First Amendment, 91 Harv.L.Rev. 630 (1978)."
554,17," The majority's attempt to distinguish this case from Council of Defense v. International Magazine Co., 267 F. 390 (8th Cir. 
1920), ante at 1304 n.4, and other noncommercial and noneconomic boycott cases, ante at 1315 n.16, will not aid reaching a 
principled disposition of antitrust claims.  The difficulty in differentiating political speech from petitioning the government will be 
great and does not seem warranted by the language of the first amendment, see Bird, supra note 2, at 288 n.161.  In both 
situations the analysis should reckon with the potential economic disruption produced by the manner of using economic 
weapons as communication.  Furthermore, the Council of Defense case simply cannot be distinguished on the basis of an intent 
to inflict punishment for past actions.  The Council evidently believed that Hearst had pro-German sympathies which continued 
and would continue to bias his reporting.  In a sense, the Council's ultimate motive could be considered in part a show of support 
for war-related legislation.  Unfortunately, the majority's decision to address this precedent obliquely rather than directly may 
leave in confusion the basic issue of when economic tools may be used with impunity in pursuit of social and political goals. "
555,18," A recurring and complicated antitrust problem is how to determine the existence of an agreement to restrain trade.  See 
Turner, The Definition of Agreement under the Sherman Act: Conscious Parallelism and Refusals to Deal, 75 Harv.L.Rev. 655 
(1962). The District Court applied the legal test articulated in Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. United States, 306 U.S. 208, 226-27, 59 S. 
Ct. 467, 474, 83 L. Ed. 610 (1939), which permits finding a conspiracy without finding any explicit agreement.  This test may not 
generally be appropriate in the circumstance of a noneconomic boycott because the normal assumptions regarding market 
power and the need for interdependence do not exist.  See Bird, supra note 2, 1970 Duke L.J. at 251-52; Kestenbaum, supra 
note 11, 54 Tex.L.Rev. at 1428. In the situation of a boycott promoted by a group that does not have an economic or commercial 
motive, it may be desirable to probe more carefully into the interdependent nature of the concerted action and whether or to what 
degree coercion, economic or otherwise, as opposed to pure persuasion, is the impetus to the combination.  Furthermore, the 
distinction between acts of concerted refusal to deal and acts of persuasion or inducement may be relevant to a reconciliation of 
the first amendment and economic interests involved.  See Note, supra note 15, 91 Harv.L.Rev. at 687-91."
555,19," The difference between a primary and secondary boycott is one method of focusing on the potential extent of economic and 
anticompetitive injury because secondary boycotts have a more extenuated economic impact that direct refusals to deal.  See 
Bird, supra note 2, 1970 Duke L.Rev. at 253; Note, supra note 11, 30 U.Chi.L.Rev. at 178, 181, 190. This distinction has been 
important in drawing the line between protected and unprotected activity in other noncommercial contexts, see, e. g., Apex 
Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U.S. 469, 505, 60 S. Ct. 982, 998, 84 L. Ed. 1311 (1940), and might be relevant to the balance to be 
drawn in this situation.  The District Court did not determine whether the convention boycott constituted a primary or secondary 
boycott. "
557,1," At oral argument, plaintiff finally conceded that what the quoted words really mean is a combination or conspiracy within the 
context of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. "
564,*," The Restatements have been revised since the national Oil decision, however, their substance has not changed. "
570,1," That dismissal left pending a severed counter claim of the defendants, alleging antitrust violations on the part of CBS.  The 
dismissal of the complaint, disposing of less than all the claims, would ordinarily not result in an appealable final judgment in the 
absence of a certification pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b); however, the dismissal is appealable under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1) 
because it is an order denying an injunction."
570,2," Judge Lumbard was assigned to the panel after the death of Judge Anderson; Judge Newman was assigned to the panel after 
the death of Judge Gurfein."
570,3," The oral argument was held before Judge Newman was assigned to the panel, but he has had the benefit of a complete 234-
page transcript of that argument."
570,4," United States v. ASCAP, 1940-1943 Trade Cas. P 56,104 (S.D.N.Y.1941)."
570,5," United States v. ASCAP, 1950-1951 Trade Cas. P 62,595 (S.D.N.Y.1950). "
572,6," The distinction may have significance, since the lawfulness of the blanket license has also been challenged by non-network 
broadcasters. "
573,7," Not the least of the ironies of the CBS claim is that the per use charge it finds acceptable is simply the formula now used by 
ASCAP to distribute royalties among its members.  That formula, based on type of music and frequency of use, does not value 
any song differently than any other.  Thus, if ASCAP were to base charges to CBS on the ASCAP royalty formula, CBS would 
obtain no price competition whatsoever.  Neither CBS nor the packagers would be able to shop competitively for cheaper songs 
when selecting music. "
574,8," We were advised at oral argument that at the present time CBS holds no license from ASCAP and has held none since March 
1978. "
575,9," CBS also contends that the blanket license impairs its ability to add films to its inventory.  Asserting a disadvantage vis-a-vis its 
network competitors, CBS alleges that, lacking performance rights, it would be precluded from bidding on films available to 
networks holding blanket licenses. Apart from the fact that this argument concerns competition among networks, not among 
copyright owners, it fails to reckon with the possibility that CBS can negotiate an individual license for the performance rights to 
music on a film, with the license to become effective only upon CBS's acquisition of the film. "
586,*," Honorable Alfonso J. Zirpoli, Senior United States District Judge of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation."
586,1," HN1[
] Section 202 of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 192 (1964) (amended 1976), provides in pertinent part: ""It shall be unlawful with respect to livestock, meats, meat food products, livestock products in unmanufactured form * * * for any 
packer * * * to: (a) Engage in or use any unfair, unjustly discriminatory, or deceptive practice or device in commerce; or (e) Engage in any course of business or do any act for the purpose or with the effect of manipulating or controlling prices in 
commerce, or of creating a monopoly in the acquisition of, buying, selling, or dealing in, any article in commerce, or of restraining 
commerce; or (g) Conspire, combine, agree, or arrange with any other person to do, or aid or abet the doing of, any act made unlawful by 
subdivisions (a)-(d) or (e) of this section."" The administrator also alleged violation of § 201.43(b) of the Regulations, 9 C.F.R. § 201.43(b) (1977) (amended 1977), which 
provides in pertinent part: ""Purchasers to pay promptly for livestock. Each packer, market agency, or dealer purchasing livestock shall, before the close of 
the next business day following the purchase of livestock and the determination of the amount of the purchase price, transmit or 
deliver to the seller or his duly authorized agent the full amount of the purchase price, unless otherwise expressly agreed 
between the parties before the purchase of the livestock. * * *"" "
587,," Violation was also charged of two other regulations prohibiting the furnishing of information to competitive buyers, and the 
restriction or limitation of competition.  On appeal, these have been treated as encompassed within the statutory violation."
587,2," The Judicial Officer's order provides: ""Respondents DeJong Packing Company, Ferry Bros., Inc., Hygrade Food Products Corporation, Mount Vernon Meat Co., Inc., 
and John F. Lenz, their officers, directors, agents, employees, successors, and assigns, directly or indirectly, individually or in 
combination with others, or through any corporate or other device, in connection with their operations as packers, shall cease 
and desist from:"
587,1," . Entering into or acting in furtherance of any conspiracy, combination, agreement or arrangement with any other packer or 
livestock buyer for the purpose or with the effect of establishing or imposing any terms or conditions relating to the purchase of 
or the payment for livestock purchased in commerce."
587,2," . Conducting any of its operations relating to the purchase of livestock in commerce jointly or in combination with any other 
packer or livestock buyer, or furnishing any information of such buying operations to any other packer or livestock buyer."
587,3," . Failing to pay, when due, the full purchase price of livestock purchased in commerce. This order shall become effective as to each respondent on the first day after service upon such respondent."""
587,3," 7 U.S.C. § 208(b) (Supp.1979) provides in part: ""It shall be the responsibility and right of every stockyard owner to manage and regulate his stockyard in a just, reasonable, and 
nondiscriminatory manner, to prescribe rules and regulations and to require those persons engaging in or attempting to engage 
in the purchase, sale, or solicitation of livestock at such stockyard to conduct their operations in a manner which will foster, 
preserve, or insure an efficient, competitive public market."" "
588,4," As to this letter, the administrative law judge stated in his initial decision: ""The obvious tenor of the document is threatening and coercive.  * * * The meaning of the document was not unclear to the 
recipient markets.  They understood it to be what it was an ultimatum by their major customers.  Without the patronage of these 
customers, the markets could not profitably conduct their business.  Upon receipt of this ultimatum, it is no wonder that the 
markets sought Government aid in order to resist."" Petitioners allege that they took this action in response to the increasingly common practice on the part of some sellers of 
administering antibiotics so that diseased cattle which will not pass government inspection appear to be healthy at the time of 
auction. The market operators opposed the shift to ""subject"" terms, asserting that it would cause added administrative problems 
and expense to the market.  The Judicial Officer found that ""each group had valid business reasons for its position * * *."" "
589,5," The Judicial Officer stated: ""1. Both letters applied only to cattle (although Hygrade purchases other species)."
589,2," . Under both letters, all cattle would be purchased ""subject' rather than ""as is.'"
589,3," . Both letters provided that the packer would refuse to pay for an animal found unfit for human consumption if slaughtered 
within the identical time period, viz., three bank days; and both provided for the packer to pay for condemned animals 
slaughtered after such period."
589,4," . Both letters provided for notice of condemnation by telephone, with condemnation slips to be thereafter mailed to the auction 
markets. "
590,," The only difference between the purchasing conditions of the two letters was in the method of payment.  Hygrade would have 
withheld payment of only two animals from each sale until it was determined whether any animals failed to pass inspection; * * * 
whereas the other respondents would have withheld payment for all cattle for three bank business days."""
590,6," The Judicial Officer stated: ""3. Hygrade's letter was sent practically simultaneously with the letters of the other respondents in 1974, and all of the letters 
had the identical effective date, May 1, 1974, except for Ferry, which had an April 29, 1974, effective date. Respondents contend 
that they all simultaneously and independently arrived at the decision to send their 1974 letters as a result of the State Court 
decision referred to in Findings 11, 12 and 19, supra.  But it is not likely that such uniformity in timing would have occurred 
absent collective action.  The State Court decision was filed February 15, 1974.  The time for appeal expired about March 18, 
1974.  Although the beginning of a month might have been picked by each respondent, acting independently, as the effective 
date for action, not one of the respondents picked April 1, 1974, as the effective date, and not one picked June 1, 1974, or 
thereafter as the effective date."""
590,7," While § 202 of the Packers and Stockyards Act may have been made broader than antecedent antitrust legislation in order to 
achieve its remedial purpose, it nonetheless incorporates the basic antitrust blueprint of the Sherman Act and other pre-existing 
antitrust legislation such as the Clayton Act and the Fair Trade Commission Act.  See Armour & Co. v. United States, 402 F.2d 
712, 722 (7th Cir. 1968); Swift & Co. v. United States, 393 F.2d 247, 253 (7th Cir. 1968). Thus the courts that have considered § 
202 have consistently looked to decisions under the Sherman Act for guidance, although recognizing that § 202 in some cases 
proscribes practices which the Sherman Act would permit.  E. g., Armour & Co. v. United States, supra, 402 F.2d 712 (7th Cir. 
1968); Swift & Co. v. United States, supra, 393 F.2d 247 (7th Cir. 1968); Swift & Co. v. United States, 308 F.2d 849, 853 (7th 
Cir. 1962). The parties in the present case agree, as indeed they must, that decisions under the Sherman Act are germane to 
the issues before us. "
591,8," The Supreme Court did not indicate in Paramount Famous Lasky Corp. or First National Pictures, Inc., whether it was 
proceeding under the rule of reason or whether it deemed the practices in question illegal per se.  The court used language 
which suggests a rule-of-reason analysis and it also used language which suggests a per-se approach. We do not find it necessary to decide that question here or to suggest which mode of analysis should apply under the Sherman 
Act. The present Act, as we discuss later is, if anything, broader in scope than the Sherman Act, and conduct of the kind held 
improper in Paramount and First National would clearly justify issuance of a cease and desist order under § 202. "
594,1," A tidy constellation of Supreme Court decisions stands for the proposition that group boycotts are per se illegal.  United States 
v. General Motors Corp., 384 U.S. 127, 86 S. Ct. 1321, 16 L. Ed. 2d 415 (1966); Silver v. New York Stock Exchange, 373 U.S. 
341, 83 S. Ct. 1246, 10 L. Ed. 2d 389 (1963); Radiant Burners, Inc. v. Peoples Gas Light & Coke Co., 364 U.S. 656, 81 S. Ct. 
365, 5 L. Ed. 2d 358 (1961); Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, 359 U.S. 207, 79 S. Ct. 705, 3 L. Ed. 2d 741 (1959); Times-
Picayune Pub. Co. v. United States, 345 U.S. 594, 73 S. Ct. 872, 97 L. Ed. 1277 (1953); United States v. Columbia Steel Co., 
334 U.S. 495, 68 S. Ct. 1107, 92 L. Ed. 1533 (1948); see also L. Sullivan, Antitrust 229-30 (1977); R. Posner, Antitrust Law: An 
Economic Perspective 207 (1976); von Kalinowski, 11 Antitrust Laws and Trade Regulation P 76.01, at 76-1 to 76-2 (1969); 
Barber, Refusals to Deal Under the Federal Antitrust Laws, 103 U.Pa.L.Rev. 847 (1955); Comment, Per Se Illegality and 
Concerted Refusals to Deal, 13 B.C.Ind. & Com.L.Rev. 484 (1972). If every group refusal to deal were a boycott, then all 
attempts to pool bargaining power would fall under the per se prohibition, for a group bargaining posture necessarily depends on 
overt or implicit threats of group refusal to deal.  In a number of decisions, however, the Court has indicated that the concept of 
unlawful boycott does not extend so far.  Fashion Originators' Guild of America, Inc. v. FTC, 312 U.S. 457, 61 S. Ct. 703, 85 L. 
Ed. 949 (1941); Appalachian Coals, Inc. v. United States, 288 U.S. 344, 53 S. Ct. 471, 77 L. Ed. 825 (1933); Chicago Bd. of 
Trade v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 38 S. Ct. 242, 62 L. Ed. 683 (1918); Eastern States Retail Lumber Dealers' Ass'n v. United 
States, 234 U.S. 600, 34 S. Ct. 951, 58 L. Ed. 1490 (1914). Further retreat from peremptory condemnation of the concerted 
refusal to deal seems inevitable given the unexplored range of differently motivated practices that would otherwise be outlawed.  
For a discussion of some joint activities yet to be examined by the courts, see L. Sullivan, supra, at 247-311. Paramount Famous Lasky Corp. v. United States, supra, and United States v. First Nat'l Pictures, Inc., supra, both decided 
under the Sherman Act, convinced the majority that it is an antitrust violation for competitors jointly to exact more favorable 
terms of trade from their suppliers than they could otherwise obtain ""through the normal play of competitive forces."" 618 F.2d at 
1336. The majority applies the principle just stated to the packers' conduct.  This of course assumes that the conduct deviated 
from the competitive norm, but more importantly, it puts forward a reading of Paramount Famous Lasky and First National 
Pictures, and an assessment of their place in antitrust jurisprudence, that are highly questionable. Neither Paramount Famous Lasky nor First National Pictures uses the term ""boycott"" or explicitly applies a per se rule.  Indeed, 
Mr. Justice McReynolds' opinions for the Court in these cases are hardly specific in their criticism of the condemned joint 
activities.  Judge Friendly has recently described the ""somewhat inscrutable opinion"" in Paramount Famous Lasky as leaping to 
a result ""(after) quoting from a miscellany of largely irrelevant opinions about the purposes of the Sherman Act."" Drayer v. 
Krasner, 572 F.2d 348, 354 (2d Cir. 1978). Film distributors in Paramount Famous Lasky agreed to use a standard contract form 
in dealing with exhibitors and not to deal with any exhibitor who breached the form's arbitration clause.  The clause was the 
focus of the parties' and the Court's attention.  The opinion does not emphasize the combination by the distributors at all.  It 
stresses instead that the contract ""cannot be classed among ""those normal and usual agreements in aid of trade and commerce' 
"" which, though restraints of trade, are deemed reasonable and permissible.  282 U.S. at 43, 51 S. Ct. at 45; cf.  Drayer v. 
Krasner, supra, 572 F.2d at 355 (suggesting that the Court's generally low opinion of arbitration at the time may account for the 
result).  Nevertheless, Mr. Justice McReynolds went on to shift the blame from arbitration as such to its anti-competitive effect in 
this setting.  ""It may be that arbitration is well adapted to the needs of the motion picture industry; but when under the guise of 
arbitration parties enter into unusual arrangements which unreasonably suppress normal competition their action becomes 
illegal."" Id.  Although this hints that the Court saw a weakening of competition not in the mere pooling of the distributors' 
bargaining power but in the design of this particular arbitration clause, the opinion goes no further.  Judge Friendly offers the 
following hypothesis: The details of the arbitration clause . . .  were indeed harsh and had operated harshly on exhibitors, as revealed in the Court's 
statement of the facts, 282 U.S. at 37-41, 51 S. Ct. 42, and further in the Government's brief, see 282 U.S. at 35-36, 51 S. Ct. 
42. A further factor which, although not mentioned, must have lurked in the background, was that many of the distributors 
themselves were important exhibitors and, indeed, were later found to have conspired with the goal of attaining a monopoly in 
exhibition, see United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 334 U.S. 131, 167-71, 68 S. Ct. 915, 92 L. Ed. 1260 (1948). Drayer v. Krasner, supra, 572 F.2d at 354-55. "
595,," First National Pictures dealt with a similar agreement of film distributors to impose a credit check on exhibitors. The agreement 
allowed a credit committee appointed by the distributors to exact a security deposit from exhibitors with low credit ratings.  The 
Court explained the evil of this combination very briefly: The obvious purpose of the arrangement is to restrict the liberty of those who have representatives on the Film Boards and 
secure their concerted action for the purpose of coercing certain purchasers of theaters by excluding them from the opportunity 
to deal in a free and untrammeled market."
595,282," U.S. at 54, 51 S. Ct. at 48. While this may imply disapproval of joint negotiation by the distributors, it also disapproves the 
restraint on distributors' freedom to vary the terms of their contracts with exhibitors. The Court may therefore have been 
concerned about the limitation on competitive variations of substitutable ""goods,"" about the distributors' increased bargaining 
strength, or both. Professor Sullivan comments: Arrangements like those in Famous Laskey and First National are more like price fixing agreements than they are like classic 
boycotts. Indeed, if a concerted agreement, say, to include a security deposit in all contracts is a ""boycott"" because it excludes 
all buyers who won't agree to it, then by parity of reasoning every price fixing agreement would be a boycott also.  The use of the 
single concept, boycott, to cover agreements so varied in nature can only add to confusion.  But there is an even more important 
reason for not referring to an agreement which concertedly sets non-price terms of trade as a boycott, to which the per se 
doctrine applies.  Such agreements may not be as consistently adverse to competition as their price fixing agreements or classic 
boycotts. In some situations for example if there are large numbers of small sellers and buyers an agreement fixing collateral 
terms, like an agreement standardizing product, might tend to increase price competition by reducing confusing variations 
between the offerings of competing sellers. In other situations concerted decisions about the terms on which competitors will 
trade may advance other social objectives and be competitively neutral.  Though courts should look at all such arrangements 
critically, a per se response may be too severe. L. Sullivan, supra, at 257-58 (footnote omitted); see also R. Posner, supra, at 207-08. In the light of these and related thoughts about the vitality of Paramount Famous Lasky, the Second Circuit held that a collective 
attempt to impose a standard arbitration clause, which did not ""inhibit the freedom of any firm in competing for business or of any 
investor in seeking the firm that will give him the best and cheapest service,"" Drayer v. Krasner, supra, 572 F.2d at 354, was 
""within the rule of reason,"" id. at 355. Thus one circuit, at least, is unwilling to extrapolate from Paramount Famous Lasky even 
to all concerted efforts to impose arbitration clauses, to say nothing of other forms of joint negotiation. "
599,*," Honorable William H. Orrick, United States District Judge for the Northern District of California, sitting by designation. "
601,1," In December, 1969, the Clymin patent was issued to Conso Engineering Co., a subsidiary of Consolidated Foods Corporation 
(""CFC"").  CFC initiated litigation against Giffen concerning the validity and infringement of the Burgess patents held by Giffen.  
The claim relating to the ""703"" process was dismissed, and the remaining claims settled in December, 1974.  Pursuant to the 
settlement, CFC assigned the Clymin patent to Giffen, reserving for itself a nonexclusive license under the patent. CFC in turn 
received a covenant from Giffen not to sue CFC under the Burgess patents and the right to twenty percent of any royalties 
collected for licenses granted under the Clymin patent. However, no such licenses have been granted, and no royalties have 
been paid to CFC."
601,2," In 1970, embossed ribbed tape came into the market and has since become the most popular variety of hot-melt adhesive 
carpet seaming tape. The Winkler patent describing this embossed tape was issued to Bruck Industries, Inc. (""Bruck"") in August, 
1973.  In 1970, Bruck had been licensed under the Burgess patents by Giffen.  However, Bruck stopped payment of royalties 
due to the CFC litigation.  After the settlement of that case, Giffen sued one of Bruck's distributors.  Bruck responded with a suit 
for declaratory judgment of invalidity and noninfringement and a separate suit for infringement of the Winkler patent. These 
actions were settled in the spring of 1976 by Giffen forming the appellant corporation herein.  Appellant received exclusive 
licenses under the Burgess, Clymin, and Winkler patents, and Bruck received rights to a two-and-a-half percent reduction in the 
royalty rate for licenses which were granted to it by appellant in accordance with appellant's standard nonexclusive license 
arrangement.  Bruck also agreed to pay $ 75,000 liquidated past royalties upon condition that other major infringers either be 
licensed or sued for infringement. "
602,3," In conjunction with this point, it is worthwhile to repeat the admonition found in both case law and treatise that despite the 
obvious value in expeditious disposition of cases, Rule 41(b) HN1[
] motions should be granted only in clear cases and ""in the 
interest of obtaining a full and complete picture for both the trial and the appellate court it may be advisable to deny the 
defendant's motion, put the defendant to its proof, and then decide the case when all the evidence has been adduced."" 5 J. 
Moore, Federal Practice § 41.13(4) at 41-192 (2d ed. 1979); see also, Riegel Fiber Corp. v. Anderson Gin Co., 512 F.2d 784 
(5th Cir. 1975); White v. Rimrock Tidelands, Inc., 414 F.2d 1336 (5th Cir. 1969). In addition, the trial judge relied in large part upon findings of fact submitted by the parties which contained an abundance of 
superfluous material and all too little of the facts needed to properly resolve the matters at issue.  The responsibility of the trial 
judge to make his or her own findings of fact has been emphasized repeatedly.  The 1946 Advisory Committee Note to 
Subdivision (a) of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52 stated that such findings ""should represent the judge's own determination 
and not the long, often argumentative statements of successful counsel."" The Advisory Committee Note cited with approval 
United States v. Forness, 125 F.2d 928 (2d Cir. 1942), cert. denied, 316 U.S. 694, 62 S. Ct. 1293, 86 L. Ed. 1764 (1942), in 
which Judge Jerome Frank stated: ""We have recently asked for ""brief and pertinent findings of contested matters * * * rather than the delayed, argumentative, 
overdetailed documents prepared by winning counsel.' Matton Oil Transfer Corp. v. Tug Dynamic, 2 Cir., Dec. 1, 1941, 123 F.2d 
999, 1001. Otherwise, we lose the benefit of the judge's own consideration.  In the instant case, a comparison of the findings 
with the opinion seems to show that the findings proposed by the defendants were mechanically adopted, with the consequence 
that some of the findings made by the district court are not supported by the evidence and not substantially in accord with the 
opinion.  Such a result can usually be avoided by following what we believe is the better practice of filing findings with the 
opinion, when the evidence is still fresh in the mind of the trial judge, and permitting the parties to file objections under Federal 
Rules of Civil Procedure, rule 52(b).  See Matton Oil Transfer Corp. v. Tug Dynamic, supra. We stress this matter because of the grave importance of fact-finding. The correct finding, as near as may be, of the facts of a 
law suit is fully as important as the application of the correct legal rules to the facts as found.  An impeccably ""right' legal rule 
applied to the ""wrong' facts yields a decision which is as faulty as one which results from the application of the ""wrong' legal rule 
to the ""right' facts.  The latter type of error, indeed, can be corrected on appeal.  But the former is not subject to such correction 
unless the appellant overcomes the heavy burden of showing that the findings of fact are ""clearly erroneous.' Chief Justice 
Hughes once remarked, ""An unscrupulous administrator might be tempted to say ""Let me find the facts for the people of my 
country, and I care little who lays down the general principles."" "" That comment should be extended to include facts found 
without due care as well as unscrupulous fact-finding; for such lack of due care is less likely to reveal itself than lack of scruples, 
which, we trust, seldom exists.  And Chief Justice Hughes' comment is just as applicable to the careless fact-finding of a judge 
as to that of an administrative officer.  The judiciary properly holds administrative officers to high standards in the discharge of 
the fact-finding function.  The judiciary should at least measure up to the same standards. It is sometimes said that the requirement that the trial judge file findings of fact is for the convenience of the upper courts.  While 
it does serve that end, it has a far more important purpose that of evoking care on the part of the trial judge in ascertaining the 
facts.  For, as every judge knows, to set down in precise words the facts as he finds them is the best way to avoid carelessness 
in the discharge of that duty: Often a strong impression that, on the basis of the evidence, the facts are thus-and-so gives way 
when it comes to expressing that impression on paper.  The trial court is the most important agency of the judicial branch of the 
government precisely because on it rests the responsibility of ascertaining the facts.  When a federal trial judge sits without a 
jury, that responsibility is his.  And it is not a light responsibility since, unless his findings are ""clearly erroneous,' no upper court 
may disturb them.  To ascertain the facts is not a mechanical act.  It is a difficult art, not a science.  It involves skill and judgment.  
As fact-finding is a human undertaking, it can, of course, never be perfect and infallible.  For that very reason every effort should 
be made to render it as adequate as it humanly can be."" Id. at 942-43 (footnotes omitted). "
603,4," The court in Norton v. Curtiss, 433 F.2d 779, 795-96, 57 CCPA 1384 (1970), noted: ""HN4[
] The state of mind of the one making the representations is probably the most important of the elements to be 
considered in determining the existence of ""fraud'.  Perhaps it is most of all in the traditional element of ""scienter' that the 
existence of a fiduciary-like duty should have its effect.  As we have already indicated, the procurement of a patent involves the 
public interest, not only in regard to the subject matter of the patent grant, but also in the system under which that grant is 
obtained.  Conduct in this area necessarily must be judged with that interest always taken into account and objective standards 
applied.  Good faith and subjective intent, while they are to be considered, should not necessarily be made controlling.  Under 
ordinary circumstances, the fact of misrepresentation coupled with proof that the party making it had knowledge of its falsity is 
enough to warrant drawing the inference that there was a fraudulent intent.  Where public policy demands a complete and 
accurate disclosure it may suffice to show nothing more than that the misrepresentations were made in an atmosphere of gross 
negligence as to their truth."" "

residential demand meters. In 1960, HL & P applied for a rate increase which resulted in hearings lasting over a year and ended 
with the City Council fixing the rate of return on all classes of service. In 1966, the Public Service Department recommended to 
the City that HL & P earnings were too high and HL & P was required to lower all of its rates. In 1970, following application and 
investigation, new rates were enacted and approved by the City for HL & P earnings."

limited to those situations where it is not feasible for the Company to furnish service direct to the users of such service."
617,6," .  On direct examination, Mr. Tom Tyson, Public Service Director, testified as follows about the provisions in rate schedules 
against resale: Q. From the standpoint of regulating the company, is that provision of some importance, or not?A. Of great importance. Q. And could you describe for us what the significance or what the importance of that provision is? A. It's in the public interest that the utilities serve the customers directly, and from the regulatory viewpoint it is very important 
that the regulatory agency have jurisdiction over the entity that is providing the service. And for those two primary reasons, the 
city policy is not to permit resale of electric utility services in the city.Q. What's so bad about resale, Mr. Tyson? A. Several several things are bad about it. One, the city would have no control over the party that is doing the reselling, of his 
rates, of the service he provides. And when people have a complaint about the service, they normally call the utility or the city. 
When you have a situation where you do have someone reselling service, you have a problem of determining who is at fault, 
and if there is a problem you have difficulty in obtaining the solution to the problem. I'm talking about rates and service now. And the city has had some experiences over the years, not so much from resale but from other instances where there was 
another party involved between the utility that was providing the service and the customer that was actually receiving the 
service. (T. 1383-85)."
617,7," .  Dr. Garfield testified in the trial outside the presence of the jury because of the District Court judge's order in limine concerning 
evidence of impact on ratepayers. Dr. Garfield testified on direct examination: Q. Now, are provisions such as the one at stake in this case, where it says the rates are not available for resale, are these types 
of provisions in rates normally and customarily accepted by regulatory authorities? A. Yes. They were accepted a long time ago. Issues as to resale prohibitions just don't arise. I think this is the first one I have 
encountered, and I have been at work in this area for twenty-eight or twenty-nine years. Q. Could you explain to the Court what the purpose of these types of rate provisions is, that is, prohibition against resale? A. Yes, sir. First of all, the regulators want the utility companies to earn the revenues that they are supposed to earn from each 
market sector. That is, when regulatory decisions are made as to how much revenue is supposed to be produced from each 
market sector, or from each rate schedule, they expect that to take place. The resale ban amounts, in effect, to insulation as 
between the market sectors so that a customer can't buy from the light company and turn right around and sell to another 
customer of the light company. In other words, the resale prohibition is there to create orderliness in the regulatory process, so that when a regulatory decision 
is made which says the utility company will earn a certain portion of its revenues from a certain market sector, that expectation is 
supposed to be realized. And it can't be realized with any certainty if the customers can start doing business with one another. Which leads me to my second point, in answer to your question: Public policy is very clear in desiring what ultimate consumers 
of utility service be served by regulated public utilities, by regulated public utilities who are responding to public officials with the 
power to tell those utilities what to do, if those in official positions don't like what the utilities are doing. Q. At least insofar as the utility's ability to earn money, is it fair to say that the resale prohibition, such as that which is at stake in 
this case, is designed to insure that the utility will earn from each class of rate that money which that rate is designed to produce 
for the utility? A. Yes, this was the first of the two points that I was explaining when I made reference to orderliness in the control of the utility's 
operations by the regulators. "
618,," But that first point is integral with the second point I was developing, which was that public policy abhors utility service being 
rendered by an unregulated supplier. And the two are not separable. If the customers can turn around and resell, since they are not public utilities, a customer of a 
utility who resells to yet another customer is an unregulated seller, and this is against public policy. Q. It is is accurate to say, then, that provisions such as this one, that say the rate is not available for resale service, is it accurate 
that they are an integral part of the rate structure? A. Absolutely. The resale provision is just as integral a part of the total offering to serve as are the pricing provisions. These are 
not severable or separable, they are integral. "
619,8," .  Damages calculated by the appellants were computed by taking the gross dollars which each appellant mall would have 
received for resale of electricity and subtracting from this gross figure the cost of electricity they would have paid under the LGS 
rate and the cost of investment in the distribution system designed by each mall. The yielded result would produce the net profit 
lost by each mall. Estimated computations showed that Almeda Mall lost between $ 764,680.02 and $ 789,907.65 in profits, 
depending on the approach taken in certain calculations. The damage figures for Northwest Mall ranged between $ 807,092.95 
and $ 991,303.78 and the figures for Westwood Mall between $ 529,109.51 and $ 1,448,463.35. "
620,9," .  At the outset of this discussion of legal issues, we note that the appellee HL & P filed a cross-appeal on the issues of (1) 
immunity from application of the antitrust laws based upon ""state action"" and (2) ""primary jurisdiction."" The District Court found 
for the appellants on these issues and relied on  Cantor v. The Detroit Edison Co., 428 U.S. 579, 96 S. Ct. 3110, 49 L. Ed. 2d 
1141 (1976), and  Litton Systems, Inc. v. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., 539 F.2d 418 (5th Cir. 1976). We agree with the reasoning 
of the District Court on these issues and find no reason to discuss them here since we hold for the appellee HL & P on the main 
issue presented concerning application of the antitrust laws."
620,10," .  Commentators point out that retail competition is not usually applicable in antitrust law. See Meeks, Concentration in the 
Electric Power Industry: The Impact of Antitrust Policy,  72 Colum.L.Rev. 64, 94 (1972). The author notes that competitive 
distribution processes within the electric power industry usually lead to duplicate facilities that increase cost and waste. He 
concludes, ""competition in the usual sense at the distribution level is generally out of the question."" Shenefield, Antitrust Policy 
Within the Electric Utility Industry,  16 Antitrust Bull. 681, 684 n. 8 (1971). The author comments on the resale of electric power 
at the wholesale level and notes: The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the electric utility industry have traditionally viewed the subject of retail 
sales as being by and large withheld from the operation of the antitrust laws as they may affect intra-industry relationships."

621,12," .  As Sylvania points out in a footnote, a frequently cited proper analysis of the ""rule of reason"" is that of Mr. Justice Brandeis in  
Chicago Bd. of Trade v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 238, 38 S. Ct. 242, 244, 62 L. Ed. 683 (1918): Every agreement concerning trade, every regulation of trade, restrains. To bind, to restrain, is of their very essence. The true 
test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or 
whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition. To determine that question the court must ordinarily consider 
the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and after the restraint was imposed; the 
nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable. The history of the restraint, the evil believed to exist, the reason for 
adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, are all relevant facts. This is not because a good 
intention will save an otherwise objectionable regulation or the reverse; but because knowledge of intent may help the court to 
interpret facts and to predict consequences."
621,13," .   15 U.S.C. § 2 states in part: Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to 
monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a 
felony . . .. "
622,14," .  Interbrand competition is the competition found among the manufacturers of the same generic product and is the primary 
concern of antitrust law. Intrabrand competition is the competition between distributors of the product of a manufacturer, 
whether it be at wholesale or retail level. Even though the two competitions may operate independent of each other, it is possible 
with a market involving vertical restrictions for a reduction in intrabrand competition to stimulate interbrand competition. See  
Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. at 51-52, 97 S. Ct. at 2558. Since HL & P holds a natural monopoly in the Houston area as the only provider of electric power, interbrand competition does 
not exist. The appellants assert, therefore, that intrabrand competition in the form of retail resale of power has been hindered 
without any counterbalancing increase in interbrand competition which could justify HL & P's restriction against resale. This 
assertion assumes, naturally, that vertical restraints on competition are being exercised by HL & P and that resale is intrabrand 
competition."
622,15," .  The appellants point out that the relevant market might be identified as one of three possible service areas: (1) the retail sale 
of electric power in the entire service area of HL & P, (2) the area covering merely the City of Houston, or (3) the competitive 
market area surrounding each of the appellant malls. They assert that, regardless of the area designated as the relevant market, 
HL & P actively maintains a monopoly over the sale of electric power in it."
622,16," .  ""Wheeling"" electric power refers to transfer by direct transmission or displacement electric power from one utility to another 
over the facilities of an intermediate utility. The Otter Tail Power Company not only refused to sell power directly to municipal 
power systems at a wholesale price but also refused to let the municipalities receive electric power from other utilities via 
transfer over their facilities. See  Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States, 410 U.S. at 368, 93 S. Ct. at 1025."

Bull. 559, 563-65 (1977), criticizing Otter Tail for failing to examine precisely the application of conventional monopolization 
principles to regulated industries with natural monopoly characteristics. "
623,18," .  The appellants had Mr. Irving Schwartz, a consulting electrical engineer, testify concerning the economic advantages of a 
single meter system. His main testimony related to recoverable monetary damages based on savings in using a single meter 
system under the cheaper LGS rate. His evidence did touch on the design of his system but this was not specifically compared 
with the system used by HL & P regarding efficiency and reliability. The plan proposed by Mr. Schwartz was designed a month 
prior to trial for comparison purposes. "
624,19," .  See Areeda, Antitrust Violations Without Damage Recoveries,  89 Harv.L.Rev. 1127, 1134 (1976): (""Thus, as long as there is 
no anticompetitive activity, the fact of injury to a competitor is not a concern of the antitrust laws.)."
624,20," .  See Watson and Brunner, supra note 17, at 566-69. The authors discuss the peculiarities involved in applying antitrust law 
to regulated monopolies. With regard to market share data they comment: These industries are regulated precisely because it has been determined that competition either cannot or should not prevail 
there. Thus, the regulatory scheme not only seeks to act as a surrogate for competition, but may, for public interest reasons, 
affirmatively seek to exclude competition from the marketplace. In particular, where economic and legal forces cause a single firm to obtain a dominant market share, lower courts have 
recognized that this situation cannot support an inference of monopoly power. (Footnote omitted.) For example, in  United States 
v. United Shoe Machinery Corp. (110 F. Supp. 295 (D.C.)) Judge Wyzanski held that there is no monopolization if the existence 
of a monopoly market share is due ""solely to . . . licenses conferred by, and used within, the limits of the law, (including . . . 
franchises granted directly to the enterprise by a public authority )."" (Emphasis supplied.) Concerning the power to control prices, they add: Where prices of a regulated firm are subject to meaningful and timely review by the agency, the firm would appear to lack one of 
the two indicia of monopoly power. Thus, where the regulatory scheme is effective, regulated firms are not permitted to engage in monopoly pricing and are 
encouraged to operate their business efficiently roughly the same ends as are sought through the promotion of competition. 
Consequently, in these circumstances, the absence of competition in a regulated marketplace need not mean that the 
statistically-dominant firm in that market possesses monopoly power over prices or that the prevailing structure necessarily 
frustrates antitrust policy. "
625,21," .  See Watson and Brunner, supra note 17, at 575-79. The authors suggest that ""willfulness"" by a regulated natural monopoly 
may be shown only by evidence of predatory conduct or other exclusionary acts contrary to public policy. Contending that no 
court has yet considered the question in a regulated industry context, they offer three guidelines for consideration: (1) conduct 
enforcing a clearly articulated public policy against competition in a particular industry should not be considered exclusionary 
conduct demonstrating willful monopolization, (2) actions, or refusals to act, required because of one's status as a public utility or 
common carrier should not be considered predatory conduct, and (3) reasonable actions legitimately taken by a regulated 
monopoly to protect its ability to provide reliable, economic service to customers should not be considered a form of improper 
""willfulness"", particularly where the monopoly's customers do not have alternative sources of obtaining the service the monopoly 
provides. We are also aware that an action brought under Sections 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act requires a showing of restraint of trade or 
monopolization affecting interstate commerce. Because of our views already expressed denying relief to appellants for failure to 
show anticompetitive activity, a discussion of the interstate commerce issue is not necessary."

subsidiary or affiliate at the date of this agreement, or acquired during its terms which may hereafter (during the term of this

635,6," The employees of the plaintiff who went on strike at the time the Union claimed the contract had terminated did not lose their 
status as employees during the strike.  The circumstances under which strikers, on termination of the contract, may lose their 
status as employees are detailed in  NLRB v. Fleetwood Trailer Co., (1967) 389 U.S. 375, 378-79, 88 S. Ct. 543, 546, 19 L. Ed. 
2d 614. Those circumstances did not prevail here.  Furthermore, the Union remained the presumed bargaining agent for these 
employees even though its contract had terminated, since the plaintiff made no showing that the Union had lost its status as the 
representative of a majority of the employees in the unit.   Terrell Machine Company v. N.L.R.B., (4th Cir. 1970) 427 F.2d 1088, 
1090, cert. denied,  398 U.S. 929, 90 S. Ct. 1821, 26 L. Ed. 2d 91. Moreover, the plaintiff with its operations completely closed 
by a strike called by the Union, had every indication that the Union continued to represent a majority of its employees in the 
bargaining unit and to bargain with and enter into a contract with a rival union in that context could well have been regarded as 
an unfair labor practice.   N.L.R.B. v. Trosch, 321 F.2d 692, 695, (4th Cir. 1963) cert. denied,  375 U.S. 993, 84 S. Ct. 632, 11 L. 
Ed. 2d 478 (1964). "
636,7," This was a perfectly legitimate request under the circumstances.  In fact, where an employer asserts financial inability to meet 
the wage demands in a bargaining agreement, he is obligated to make available to the Union his financial records so that the 
Union can determine whether the claim is sound, and a failure to do so may lay the employer open to an unfair labor charge.

employees to eliminate competition over wages and working conditions.  Union success in organizing workers and standardizing 
wages ultimately will affect price competition among employees, but the goals of federal labor law never could be achieved if this 
effect on business competition were held a violation of the antitrust laws."""

collective bargaining agreement with employers that restrains the ""business market,"" as distinguished from the ""wage market,"" is 
without labor's exemption, but suggests that, if the agreement is a part of a collective bargaining agreement, the result would not 
be the same.  This appears to be the import of the following statement in the opinion: ""There can be no argument in this case, whatever its force in other contexts, that a restraint of this magnitude might be entitled 
to an antitrust exemption if it were included in a lawful collective-bargaining agreement.""  Pp. 625-26, 95 S. Ct. p. 1836."

823, 835 (1965): ""What would be an antitrust infraction for a group of employers acting in their capacity as competing sellers or buyers is not 
immunized by reason of labor's complicity."" For another summarization of Allen Bradley see Bernhardt, The Allen Bradley Doctrine: An Accommodation of Conflicting 
Policies,  110 U.Pa.L.Rev. 1094, 1107 (1962): ""The Allen Bradley doctrine is concerned with the labor exemption being used to shelter employer violations from the antitrust 
laws. Therefore, the employer participation in a conspiracy found to violate the antitrust laws under the doctrine must itself 
amount to a violation independently.  The employer activity must be of the kind that business interests would be likely to 
undertake in the absence of the union rather than mere cooperation with the union in the achievement of typical Union goals.""

Contract on any basis other than those specified in this Contract or any applicable District Contract.  The United Mine Workers of 
America will diligently perform and enforce without discrimination or favor the conditions of this paragraph and all other terms "
641,," and conditions of this Contract and will use and exercise its continuing best efforts to obtain full compliance therewith by each

Milk Dealers, Inc. v. Milk Drivers U., Local 753, (7th Cir. 1970) 422 F.2d 546, 554. Moreover a ""most favored nation"" clause, 
which is what the PWC was, is within the definition of a mandatory collective bargaining agreement.  Dolly Madison Industries, 
(1970) 182 N.L.R.B. 1037. In this area of mandatory bargaining, the rule of exemption is especially appropriate.  See  Meat 
Cutters v. Jewel Tea, (1965) 381 U.S. 676, 689, 85 S. Ct. 1596, 1601, 14 L. Ed. 2d 640: ""Employers and unions are required to bargain about wages, hours and working conditions, and this fact weighs heavily in favor 
of antitrust exemption for agreements on these subjects."""
641,25," In any antitrust suit against a labor organization, it is not sufficient merely to find that the activity of the labor organization was 
without the labor exemption; there must in addition be proof of an antitrust violation itself.  This point was noted in Apex where 
the court said that ""activities of labor organizations not immunized by the Clayton Act are not necessarily violations of the 
Sherman Act.""  310 U.S. at 512, 60 S. Ct. at 1002. Recently in  FMC v. Pacific Maritime Assn., (1978) 435 U.S. 40, 61, 98 S. Ct. 927, 939, 55 L. Ed. 2d 96, the Supreme Court 
reiterated the same thought: ""It is plain from our cases that an antitrust case need not be tried and a violation found before a determination can be made 
that a collective-bargaining agreement is not within the labor exemption, just as it is clear that denying the exemption does 
not mean that there is an antitrust violation."" The court then added as a footnote to this statement: ""In  Connell Construction Co. v. Plumbers & Steamfitters, 421 U.S. 616 (, 95 S. Ct. 1830, 44 L. Ed. 2d 418 (1975), for 
example, the Court, after concluding that the agreement in question was not entitled to the nonstatutory labor exemption 
from the antitrust laws, remanded for consideration whether the agreement violated the Sherman Act. See also,  Meat 
Cutters v. Jewel Tea, 381 U.S. 676, 688-689, 85 S. Ct. 1596, 1601-1602, 14 L. Ed. 2d 640 (1965) (opinion of White, J.)"" n.

finding of antitrust liability.  Once the exemption is lost, a separate determination of the alleged antitrust violation must be 
made in which the plaintiff is required to prove his case by a preponderance of evidence.  Second, at least for purposes of 
the nonstatutory exemption, a claim of exempt status is not limited to a labor organization, i. e., an employer may assert the 
exemption."" In the Comment, Antitrust Law Most Favored Nation Clause and Labor's Antitrust Exemption,  19 J.Pub.L., 399, 403, n. 29, the 
editor says: ""Even when it is determined that a (most-favored nation) clause is beyond the scope of the exemption, it does not 
automatically follow that every case will result in an antitrust violation. That is to say, once an agreement is placed beyond 
the protection of the exemption, it remains to be proved that a violation has occurred; and in the cases claiming an alleged 
conspiracy under the Sherman Act, predatory intent is an integral part of such proof."" (Italics added) Levy, 5 San Fernando Valley Law Review at 278 declares: ""Pennington, however, required proof of predatory intent to find that a ""most favored nations' clause violates antitrust 
statutes."" "
642,," And in  Embry-Riddle Aeronautical Univ. v. Ross Aviation, Inc., (5th Cir. 1974) 504 F.2d 896, 904, the court said: ""In effect the court placed the exemption issue and the issue of liability on the merits before the jury under one instruction.  
Perhaps the preferable practice would be to separate them."""

liability under the antitrust laws.""  381 U.S. at 661, 85 S. Ct. at 1589. He concluded his opinion with the statement: ""Thus the relevant labor and antitrust policies compel us to conclude that the alleged agreement between UMW and the 
large operators to secure uniform labor standards throughout the industry, if proved, was not exempt from the antitrust 
laws.""  381 U.S. at 669, 85 S. Ct. at 1593. The author of the Comment on Connell in  89 Harv.L.Rev. at 242, n. 63, offers a reason for this focus by Mr. Justice White on 
exemption by observing that this was the significant issue in the case since ""(t)he district court provided the Pennington Court 
with an explicit finding that the union intended to drive out the smaller operators."" This ""explicit finding"" was sufficient to establish 
a substantive antitrust violation (the second issue in the case), leaving only the issue of the applicability of the exemption (the 
first issue in the case)."

644,," ""On remand the Pennington case was tried before District Judge Taylor, sitting without a jury.  After reviewing the Supreme 
Court's decision, Judge Taylor concluded that a finding of predatory intent to drive small coal companies out of business 
was necessary to hold the employer and union for a Sherman Act violation.  He also emphasized that Mr. Justice White's 
second footnote indicated that HN13[
] the antitrust laws were ""not designed to protect marginal operators' and that ""ill 
effects alone on marginal operators (are) not enough to show intent.' Thus Judge Taylor adopted the Douglas ""reading' in 
Pennington with emphasis on the sufficiency of evidence relating solely to marginal producers' damages (White).  The 
requirement of additional proof of predatory intent was crucial here in that the District Judge stated that the ""preponderance 
of proof' showed that all but one of the plaintiffs could not afford to pay the wages and royalties provided for in the 1950 
industry-wide agreement as periodically amended.  By centering his opinion on predatory intent, Judge Taylor managed to 
harmonize the White and Douglas opinions better than anyone could have expected."""

put some of the employers in the industry out of business, established by something more than evidence that the union and 
signatory employers were aware that marginal operators could not afford to pay the union scale."" In the Comment to  28 U.Fla.L.Rev. at 629, the writer said: ""To find a conspiracy (by labor) with a non-labor group, the courts have consistently required proof of predatory purpose or a 
design to injure or eliminate a competitor."" Dean St. Antoine in  62 Va.L.Rev. at 613 finds that ""In Pennington the key question was whether a labor agreement dealing with wages would violate the antitrust laws if its purpose 
was to put certain competitors out of business.  The answer was ""yes'."" In  Embry-Riddle, 504 F.2d 896 at 903, the court said: ""At least in cases falling within the Pennington model, for nonexemption and liability to be found the union must be proved to 
have had a purpose to injure or eliminate the competitor of a company whose employees it represents."" In  Associated Milk Dealers, 422 F.2d 546 at 554, the court said: ""Therefore, a majority of the Supreme Court in Pennington requires proof of predatory purpose as a prerequisite to finding that a 
most favored nation clause violates the antitrust laws."" In  Consolidated Express, 602 F.2d at 516, the court, after carefully reviewing Pennington and Ramsey, said: ""Since the three Justices who joined in the Douglas opinion would have upheld the union's claim of antitrust immunity absent a 
showing of predatory intent, and three others would have upheld the claim of immunity on broader grounds announced by 
Justice Goldberg, the Douglas opinion may well be read as limiting antitrust liability for agreements concerning subjects at the 
""very heart' of the collective bargaining process to cases where predatory intent can be shown."" "

664,16," MELCO Sales' motion for summary judgment, filed together with MELCO's and supported by the same brief, does not rest on 
subject matter jurisdictional grounds, and will therefore not be considered at this time. "
665,17," As we noted in a recent answer to a petition for writ of prohibition or mandamus which was denied by the Court of Appeals on 
January 17, 1980: Even routine matters such as extension of deadlines all too frequently have involved my personal intervention; I have resolved 
literally hundreds of problems involving scheduling of depositions, deadlines for production of documents and responses to 
interrogatories, etc. These routine problems have come to my attention at the regular day-long pretrial conferences, through correspondence (I 
receive on the average 15 letters a week from counsel), and through a program of telephone conference calls which are 
reported by a court reporter and are designed to provide a forum for adjudication of case management problems on an 
expeditious basis. Over the past few years, there has never been a week without two or three conference calls, often quite 
lengthy, and often with as many as 20 to 25 lawyers involved. The 110 reported pretrial conferences and conference calls which 
have taken place between January 1978 and May 1979 only tell part of the story, for there have been many calls unreported by 
the court reporter. Symbolic of the problem is the fact that the parties were not even able to agree on English language 
translations of Japanese language documents. I have had to appoint special translation masters to troubleshoot in the area, and 
I still have had to hold half a dozen conferences devoted to the translation problem. In sum, for the first year and a half of my 
stewardship in this case, I probably devoted close to fifty percent of my time to superintendence of this case."
665,17," A Inter alia, many thousands of document pages requested by the plaintiffs were not produced by various defendants until well 
after April 1979. "
666,18," MELCO also later filed a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12 based upon the same subject matter 
jurisdiction grounds as are used to support its summary judgment motion. See the discussion relating to this procedural problem, 
section III, infra."
666,19," Plaintiffs contend that Judge Higginbotham, in his opinion concerning personal jurisdiction and venue, see note 5 supra, 
already decided this issue, and that MELCO is plainly doing business in this country. We are not convinced that the issues are 
identical, however, and will not restrict our scrutiny of the record to the ""minimum contacts"" required for personal jurisdiction. See 
International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 66 S. Ct. 154, 90 L. Ed. 95 (1945). "
667,20, See note 19 supra.
667,21," Although the requirement that activities be ""in commerce"" or that they ""affect"" interstate or foreign commerce is always said to 
be a prerequisite for federal jurisdiction under the Sherman Act, see e.g., McLain v. Real Estate Board, Inc., 444 U.S. 232, 100 
S. Ct. 502, 509, 62 L. Ed. 2d 441 (1980); Hospital Building Co. v. Trustees of Rex Hospital, 425 U.S. 738, 742 n. 1, 96 S. Ct. 
1848, 1851 n. 1, 48 L. Ed. 2d 338 (1976); Gulf Oil Corp. v. Copp Paving Co., 419 U.S. 186, 203 n. 19, 95 S. Ct. 392, 402 n. 19, 
42 L. Ed. 2d 378 (1974); Harold Friedman, Inc. v. Thorofare Markets, Inc., 587 F.2d 127, 132 n. 14 (3d Cir. 1978), it is unclear 
why this is so. The Sherman Act provides that ""(e) very contract, combination . . . or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or 
commerce among the several States . . . is declared to be illegal."" 15 U.S.C. § 1. Federal jurisdiction over antitrust disputes is 
provided by 28 U.S.C. § 1337, which grants jurisdiction to the district courts over all actions ""arising under an Act of Congress 
regulating commerce."" 28 U.S.C. § 1337. Because it is well established, at least in this Circuit, that ""(t)he tests of ""arising under' 
required by Section 1337 are the same as those demanded by Section 1331, (the general federal question jurisdictional grant, 
which contains the same ""arising under"" language) except that no jurisdictional amount need be alleged,"" Jersey Central Power 
& Light Co. v. Local Unions 327, etc., IBEW, 508 F.2d 687, 699 n. 34 (3d Cir. 1975), vacated on other grounds, 425 U.S. 987, 96 
S. Ct. 2196, 48 L. Ed. 2d 812 (1976), it would seem that the only question which would be relevant for jurisdictional purposes is 
whether the allegations state a cause of action ""arising under"" the Sherman Act. The test whether a claim arises under a given 
statute is a lenient one, permitting dismissals for lack of jurisdiction only if the allegations of the complaint are frivolous or on 
their face do not implicate a federal statute. See, e.g., Hagans v. Lavine, 415 U.S. 528, 94 S. Ct. 1372, 39 L. Ed. 2d 577 (1974); 
Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 66 S. Ct. 773, 90 L. Ed. 939 (1946). Where a plaintiff has made non-frivolous allegations of a 
violation of the Sherman Act, federal court jurisdiction should attach and the court should be ""empowered to determine whether 
the claim is good or bad, on the basis of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim or cause of action."" Romero v. 
International Terminal Operating Co., 358 U.S. 354, 359, 79 S. Ct. 468, 473, 3 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1959). If a claim were not 
adequately alleged, the action would be dismissed on the merits.  Bell v. Hood, supra. This jurisdiction-based analysis, however, has not been articulated by the HN3[
] courts, which have instead consistently 
looked to the language of the Sherman Act, the substantive statute, for further jurisdictional guidance, interpreting the effect on 
interstate or foreign commerce element as a jurisdictional requirement. It appears that this concept derives from the fact that "
668,," Congressional power to legislate in this manner is limited by the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. The question remains, 
however, whether this constitutional limitation on legislative jurisdiction also applies to judicial jurisdiction. The argument for 
applying the same restrictions would seem to be that judicial application of legislation beyond its permissible constitutional reach 
would in effect extend legislative power in an unconstitutional manner. On the other hand, however, it is clear that the jurisdiction 
of the courts is not necessarily coextensive with that of Congress. Thus, the courts are constitutionally empowered to hear cases 
involving parties from different states, but federal law is not controlling.  Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S. Ct. 817, 82 
L. Ed. 1188 (1938). Additionally, it has been settled since Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 2 L. Ed. 60 (1803), that 
the courts have jurisdiction to determine the constitutionality of federal legislation. This power clearly entails the extension of 
judicial jurisdiction where legislative jurisdiction does not exist. Logically, then, in the Sherman Act context, the lack of a nexus with interstate commerce should be treated as a failure to state a 
claim under the Act, and not as a jurisdictional defect. This would sufficiently limit the reach of the Sherman Act, for a complaint 
failing to allege an interstate commerce nexus would be dismissed on a 12(b)(6) motion for failure to state a claim. On the other 
hand, the plaintiff would clearly have an adequate opportunity to prove this interstate commerce nexus, because cases involving 
disputed issues of fact would proceed to the trial stage. The parties' right to a jury trial would likewise be protected. As noted above, this jurisdictional analysis has not been adopted by the federal courts, hence we cannot break with well-
established precedent by adopting it here. However, we have found this analysis helpful in considering the appropriate modus 
procedendi in this area. We note additionally that, while the ""arising under"" approach would resolve or eliminate many of the procedural problems 
discussed below, that approach would have its limitations in a situation in which the jurisdictional and substantive requirements 
are truly intertwined. See discussion infra related to claims brought, e.g., under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, where the element of state 
action is present in the jurisdictional provision as well as in the substantive section. Hence, the problems which face the federal 
courts arguably needlessly in Sherman Act cases must still be faced in other contexts."
668,22," See, e.g., Gilbert v. David, 235 U.S. 561, 35 S. Ct. 164, 59 L. Ed. 360 (1915) (diversity); Nelson v. Keefer, 451 F.2d 289 (3d

669,23," The Court also read the pleadings in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, 100 S. Ct. at 511, a procedure not generally 
followed when a court is dealing with a jurisdictional challenge.  Mortensen v. First Federal Savings & Loan Ass'n, 549 F.2d 884, 
891 (3d Cir. 1977)."
669,24," Two other recent Supreme Court cases warrant discussion here. In Hospital Building Co. v. Trustees of Rex Hospital, 425 
U.S. 738, 96 S. Ct. 1848, 48 L. Ed. 2d 338 (1976), the Court was unconcerned whether the interstate commerce question was 
treated as a question of jurisdiction or as a substantive element of the offense, but chose to follow the court of appeals and treat 
it as an element of the claim, noting that the analysis would be no different.  Id. at 742 n. 1, 96 S. Ct. at 1851 n. 1. Because the 
court determined that the complaint sufficiently alleged a substantial effect on interstate commerce for purposes of withstanding 
a 12(b)(6) motion, it did not have to address the possibility of a lower standard for jurisdictional purposes. Moreover, because the 
case had been appealed from a dismissal at the pretrial stage, the jury trial issue was not implicated. The court did point out that 
""(i)t may, of course, be that even though petitioner's complaint adequately alleges an effect on interstate commerce, further 
proceedings in this case will demonstrate that respondents' conduct in fact involves . . . no substantial effect on interstate 
commerce."" Id. at 747 n. 5, 96 S. Ct. at 1853 n. 5. Left unclear by this comment, however, was whether this later demonstration "
670,," would oust the court of subject matter jurisdiction, or merely oust the plaintiffs from federal court by an adverse decision on the 
merits. The previous term, in Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar Ass'n, 421 U.S. 773, 95 S. Ct. 2004, 44 L. Ed. 2d 572 (1975), the Court 
considered the question of a nexus with interstate commerce with no reference whatsoever to subject matter jurisdiction. Early Supreme Court cases construing the reach of the Sherman Act in cases with a disputed interstate commerce nexus 
similarly did not address the judicial jurisdiction question, discussing instead the extent of Congressional power. See, e.g., Swift 
& Co. v. United States, 196 U.S. 375, 25 S. Ct. 276, 49 L. Ed. 518 (1905); United States v. E. C. Knight Co., 156 U.S. 1, 15 S. 
Ct. 249, 39 L. Ed. 325 (1895)."
670,25," In Mortensen, plaintiffs were mortgagors who brought suit against their mortgagee and the mortgagee's law firm, alleging an 
illegal tie-in of legal services in violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act. The question on appeal was whether the district court had 
erred in dismissing the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the grounds that the alleged tie-in was neither in nor 
substantially affected interstate commerce. The Third Circuit vacated the dismissal, holding that plaintiffs had alleged an 
interstate impact sufficient to withstand a pretrial motion to dismiss. Mortensen's primary value is in its detailed clarification of the formal, procedural differences between treatments of motions 
under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b) (1), 12(b)(6), and 56, 549 F.2d at 890-92, a discussion which need not be repeated here. At one point, 
the court notes that when a trial court is considering its jurisdiction under 12(b)(1), it is free to weigh the evidence and satisfy itself as to the existence of its power to hear the case. In short, no presumptive 
truthfulness attaches to plaintiff's allegations, and the existence of disputed material facts will not preclude the trial court from 
evaluating for itself the merits of jurisdictional claims. Id. This statement will be helpful in some contexts, but not in those addressed at pp. 1175-1177 infra. While the Mortensen court found that the jurisdictional and substantive issues were so intertwined as to preclude permissible 
pretrial resolution, a later Third Circuit case makes it clear that certain questions can clearly be denominated as jurisdictional and 
others as substantive. The court explained that the only jurisdictional question is whether there is a ""material effect on interstate 
commerce."" Harold Friedman, Inc. v. Thorofare Markets, Inc., 587 F.2d 127, 132 (3d Cir. 1978). The question whether 
defendant's conduct caused a restraint of trade or commerce falls squarely within the substantive portion of the Sherman Act. Id. 
at 137."

672,31," To further demonstrate the checkered character of the law in this area, we pose the following query. Suppose that a judge in 
a Nelson v. Keefer situation made a pretrial ruling (on the basis of the discovery record) that plaintiff's claim in a personal injury 
case with conceded liability appeared ""to a legal certainty"" to be in excess of $ 10,000. Let us further suppose that the jury 
returns a verdict on damages of $ 250. We think that no one would contend that the plaintiff could not collect the $ 250 because 
there was no federal jurisdiction, i. e., the $ 10,000 jurisdictional amount had not been met."

673,34," Section 7 of the Clayton Act applies to corporations ""in commerce"" or subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade 
Commission who acquire assets of other corporations when the effect is ""substantially to lessen competition"" or to ""tend to 
create a monopoly."" 15 U.S.C. § 18. The Robinson-Patman Act prohibits price discrimination by ""any person engaged in 
commerce, in the course of such commerce . . . where either or any of the purchases involved . . . are in commerce"" and where 
the effect is ""substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce."" 15 U.S.C. § 13(a). The 
Antidumping Act of 1916 applies to ""any person importing or assisting in importing"" articles into the United States, 15 U.S.C. § 
72. The Wilson Tariff Act applies to combinations between persons ""engaged in importing any article from any foreign country 
into the United States"" when the combination ""is intended to operate in restraint of lawful trade . . . ."" 15 U.S.C. § 8. Jurisdiction 
under all these statutes is based on 28 U.S.C. § 1337, which reads: ""The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action or proceeding arising under any Act of Congress regulating 
commerce or protecting trade and commerce against restraints and monopolies."""
673,35," The legal standards under the Clayton and Robinson-Patman Acts are somewhat narrower than under the Sherman Act: 
under those statutes, the ""in commerce"" provision, see note 34, supra, does not extend to activities which merely ""affect"" 
commerce, Gulf Oil Corp. v. Copp Paving Co., 419 U.S. 186, 95 S. Ct. 392, 42 L. Ed. 2d 378 (1974). To that extent, the ultimate 
factual inquiry will differ. "

674,37," See Rivard v. United States, 375 F.2d 882, 885 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 884, 88 S. Ct. 151, 19 L. Ed. 2d 181 (1967); 
Restatement (Second) of Foreign Relations §§ 30-36 (1965)."
674,38," While the passive personality principle could possibly support jurisdiction over antitrust violations on the theory that the 
""victim"" is the United States populace, the United States does not accept this principle as a legitimate basis for jurisdiction. See 
Restatement (Second) of Foreign Relations § 30(a) and comment e."
674,39," We do not fully understand the objective/subjective dichotomy in this context. The usage appears to have widespread 
currency, however. See, e.g., W. Fugate, Foreign Commerce and the Antitrust Laws (2d ed. 1973). "
675,40," At oral argument, MELCO suggested that the effects doctrine (the objective territorial principle) was accepted internationally 
only in the criminal context, or at least that it was unacceptable as a basis for jurisdiction over economic regulation. This theory 
is plainly incorrect. See W. Fugate, Foreign Commerce and the Antitrust Laws 36-37 (2d ed. 1973). Indeed, the Japanese 
themselves apply their antitrust laws extraterritorially. See The Case of Nippon Yusen Kabushiki-Gaisha and Five Other 
Respondents, decided on August 18, 1972 by the Japanese Fair Trade Commission (1964) (Decision No. 2), as does the 
European Common Market, see Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd. v. E. C. Commission, 1972 Common Market Law Reports 
557, and both use the effects doctrine as a basis for their assertion of jurisdiction. Moreover, this argument of MELCO's is 
inconsistent with the argument pursued by it more strenuously, that we should be particularly chary of applying a punitive statute 
(such as the Sherman Act) to acts beyond our borders, thus analogizing this civil antitrust suit to a criminal one. If this action is 
similar to a criminal action, then presumably international law would support jurisdiction based on the effects principle even 
under MELCO's own theory."
675,41," The legislative history of the Sherman Act, found in 21 Cong.Rec., does not address the foreign reach of the Act beyond 
mentioning that it extends to foreign commerce. See 21 Cong.Rec. 2461-62 (remarks by Sen. Sherman) (1890). The paucity of 
discussion relevant to foreign commercial activity has led one commentator to declare the Sherman Act's legislative history to be 
""simply useless in dealing with specific fact situations in American foreign trade."" Ongman, ""Be No Longer a Chaos "":

02 (1977)."
675,42," We emphasize again that it is United States law which we are bound to apply. The international law which we apply is not that 
expounded by the commentators, but that which has been accepted as part of our domestic law; as a district court, we are not at 
liberty to write on tabula rasa as MELCO urges we should. "
676,43," See, e.g., Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 705, 82 S. Ct. 1404, 1413, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777 
(1962); United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, 148 F.2d 416, 443 (2d Cir. 1945)."
676,44," The act of state doctrine provides that ""(e)very sovereign State is bound to respect the independence of every other sovereign 
State, and the courts of one country will not sit in judgment on the acts of the government of another done within its own

Sabbatino, 376 U.S. 398, 84 S. Ct. 923, 11 L. Ed. 2d 804 (1964); Mannington Mills, Inc. v. Congoleum Corp., 595 F.2d 1287 (3d

state issues, which will be addressed in a separate opinion. "
677,45," Plaintiffs contend that the first hint of erosion of American Banana came in Strassheim v. Daily, 221 U.S. 280, 31 S. Ct. 558, 
55 L. Ed. 735 (1911), which broadly stated that ""(acts) done outside a jurisdiction but intending to produce and producing 
detrimental effects within it, justify a State in punishing the cause of the harm as if he had been present at the effect,"" 211 U.S. at 
285, 31 S. Ct. at 560. Strassheim is plainly distinguishable on two grounds, however. First, it dealt with an interstate, rather than 
international, effect, and therefore had totally different comity ramifications. Moreover, it was a criminal extradition case in which 
material steps in the scheme to defraud were taken in the state seeking extradition, although the accused was not present in the 
state when the result ensued. "
678,46," Although not decided by the Supreme Court, Alcoa was a final, unappealable judgment. A quorum of the Supreme Court was 
unobtainable, and the appeal was certified to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit sitting as a special statutory court 
pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 29, which authorized it to hear such cases ""in lieu of a decision by the Supreme Court"" and provided 
that such decision ""shall be final and there shall be no review of such decision by appeal or certiorari or otherwise."" The 
Supreme Court in American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U.S. 781, 811, 66 S. Ct. 1125, 1140, 90 L. Ed. 1575 (1946),

that the Constitution gives authority over foreign commerce to the legislative and executive branches of government does not 
preclude Congress from ceding a portion of that power to the judiciary, or, indeed, to private citizens via the ""private attorney 
general"" provision of the Sherman Act. In fact, the entire jurisdiction/substantive merits question of ""effect on commerce"" exists 
precisely to avoid constitutional infirmity."

682,60," Judge Choy suggested that the substantiality test had crept into the analysis via the comparable test required in the interstate 
context in order to save federal regulation from being unconstitutional. Since there is no constitutional problem in defining 
congressional power over foreign commerce, however, he considered it unwise ""blindly to apply the ""substantiality' test to the 
international setting."" 549 F.2d at 612. Cf.  Hospital Building Co. v. Trustees of Rex Hospital, 425 U.S. 738, 96 S. Ct. 1848, 48 L.

682,61," Section 18 of the Restatement (Second) of Foreign Relations suggests a similar approach: A state has jurisdiction to prescribe a rule of law attaching legal consequences to conduct that occurs outside its territory and 
causes an effect within its territory, if either (a) the conduct and its effect are generally recognized as constituent elements of a crime or tort under the law of states that 
have reasonably developed legal systems, or (b)(i) the conduct and its effect are constituent elements of activity to which the rule applies; (ii) the effect within the territory is 
substantial; (iii) it occurs as a direct and foreseeable result of the conduct outside the territory; and (iv) the rule is not inconsistent 
with the principles of justice generally recognized by states that have reasonably developed legal systems."
682,62," MELCO contends that this fact alone totally distinguishes Mannington Mills from the instant litigation. We disagree. While the 
broad language there may technically be dictum, the analytical approach, if not the factual pattern, is plainly applicable. "
683,63," Mannington Mills was decided by a divided panel: the opinion was written by Judge Weis and joined by District Judge Weiner 
sitting by designation; Judge Adams joined portions of the opinion and concurred in the result, but differed as to the analytical 
approach. We are, of course, bound by the majority's view, described in the text, which creates a tidy framework, easily workable 
in practice. On the other hand, Judge Adams' view that consideration of factors of international comity is part of the jurisdictional 
determination rather than a separate, subsequent matter viewed within an abstention framework finds much support in the 
caselaw. See Mannington Mills, supra, 549 F.2d at 1301-02 n. 9 (Adams, J., concurring). But see In re Uranium Antitrust 
Litigation, 617 F.2d 1248 (7th Cir. 1980)."
683,64," See also the ""jurisdictional rule of reason"" outlined in K. Brewster, Antitrust and American Business Abroad 446 (1958). In the 
Uranium Antitrust case, supra n. 63, the 7th Circuit declined to adopt the Mannington Mills or Timberlane comity factors in the 
unique procedural posture of that case, where foreign corporations had refused to appear and default judgments were entered. 
Instead, the court found that the district court had not abused its discretion by considering only the complexity of the multi-
national action, the seriousness of the charges, and the recalcitrant attitude of the defaulters.  617 F.2d at 1254-56."
683,65," It is plain that the intent required is general, and not specific. See, e.g., Alcoa, supra; Fleischmann Distilling Corp. v. Distillers 
Co., 395 F. Supp. 221, 227 (S.D.N.Y.1975); United States v. General Electric Co., 82 F. Supp. 753, 891 (D.N.J.1949); W. 
Fugate, Foreign Commerce and the Antitrust Laws 48 (2d ed. 1973). Many of the cases fail to mention intent as a requirement at 
all; this is possibly because, since parties are deemed to intend the natural consequences of their acts, intent is easily inferred 
from the factual patterns under analysis."
683,66, We note that the substantiality of both the effect and the intent are taken into consideration in the balancing process. 
690,1," J. Viner, Dumping: A Problem in International Trade 4 (1923, reprinted 1966)."
690,2," [**5]  The ten principal defendants are Mitsubishi Corporation, a Japanese trading company; Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., 
Ltd., Toshiba Corporation, Hitachi, Ltd., Sharp Corporation, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation (""MELCO""), Sanyo Electric Co., Ltd., 
and Sony Corporation, all Japanese manufacturers of consumer electric products; and two American companies, Motorola, Inc. 
and Sears, Roebuck & Co. Fourteen other defendants are subsidiaries of the principal Japanese defendants. Of the twenty-four 
defendants, fifteen are defendants in both suits, seven in the Zenith action only, and two in the NUE action only."
690,3," In addition to the twenty-four named defendants, the plaintiffs have identified dozens of alleged coconspirators whose business 
operations span the globe, ranging from small Japanese companies to such world industrial giants as N. V. Phillips 
Gloeilampenfabrieken and General Electric."
690,4," The Antidumping Act of 1916, hereinafter variously ""the 1916 Antidumping Act,"" ""the 1916 Act,"" or, where appropriate, ""the 
Act,"" is here reproduced in full: HN1[
] It shall be unlawful for any person importing or assisting in importing any articles from any foreign country into the 
United States, commonly and systematically to import, sell or cause to be imported or sold such articles within the United States 
at a price substantially less than the actual market value or wholesale price of such articles, at the time of exportation to the 
United States, in the principal markets of the country of their production, or of other foreign countries to which they are 
commonly exported after adding to such market value or wholesale price, freight, duty, and other charges and expenses 
necessarily incident to the importation and sale thereof in the United States: Provided, That such act or acts be done with the 
intent of destroying or injuring an industry in the United States, or of preventing the establishment of an industry in the United 
States, or of restraining or monopolizing any part of trade and commerce in such articles in the United States. Any person who violates or combines or conspires with any other person to violate this section is guilty of a misdemeanor, and, 
on conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $ 5,000, or imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both, in the 
discretion of the court. Any person injured in his business or property by reason of any violation of, or combination or conspiracy to violate, this section, 
may sue therefor in the district court of the United States for the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an 
agent, without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages sustained, and the cost of the suit, 
including a reasonable attorney's fee. The foregoing provisions shall not be construed to deprive the proper State courts of jurisdiction on actions for damages 
thereunder."
690,15," U.S.C.  § 72. The plaintiff's claims under the 1916 Act are stated in Count I of the Complaint of plaintiff NUE, in Count VII of 
the Complaint of plaintiff Zenith, and in Count VI of Zenith's Counterclaim. NUE's claims involve only television receivers, while 
Zenith's claims encompass other consumer electronic products as well. "
691,5," The Hitachi-Toshiba-Sanyo motion was joined by Sharp Corporation, Mitsubishi Corporation, and their subsidiaries. Sony 
Corporation and its subsidiary have moved separately for summary judgment on factual grounds particular to Sony, but have 
also asserted the legal theory which is addressed in this opinion. Three of the four motions listed in the text are addressed to 
other matters as well as the 1916 Act claims. Sears Roebuck's motion is concerned only with Zenith's dumping claims as stated 
in Count VI of the Zenith Counterclaim. These motions and others raise additional questions concerning the construction of the 1916 Act, apart from the comparability 
issue which is addressed in this opinion. In particular, a number of arguments have been made concerning the predatory intent 
proviso of the Act. We do not reach these arguments here."
691,6," Throughout this opinion, we refer on occasion to ""U. S."" products and ""Japanese"" products, as a shorthand for products 
manufactured for sale and use in the United States and in Japan, respectively. In deciding the instant motions, we are only 
concerned with products manufactured in Japan; we are deciding whether products manufactured in Japan for the Japanese 
domestic home market are comparable with products manufactured in Japan for exportation to the United States. The products 
made by American manufacturers and their characteristics are not discussed anywhere in this opinion. Consequently, the 
appellation ""U. S.,"" whenever used in this opinion, refers to the place of intended use of electronic products, and never to their 
place of manufacture. "
693,7," In conjunction with granting summary judgment, we dismiss Count I of NUE's Complaint, which states NUE's claims under the 
1916 Act and is limited to television receivers. Zenith's claims under the 1916 Act encompass non-television products as well as 
television receivers, and, as will appear in due course, a small category of non-television products escapes the effects of our 
summary judgment order. Accordingly, we do not dismiss the Zenith 1916 Act claims in toto."
693,8," Some of the arguments stated in this part of our opinion have been made by all the moving defendants; some arguments have 
been made only by one defendant or one group of defendants. We make no attempt here to ascribe particular arguments to the 
particular defendants who made them. We do not consider in this opinion the contention of defendants Sharp Corporation and 
Sharp Electronics Corporation that any claim under the 1916 Antidumping Act is barred b the 1953 Treaty of Friendship, 
Commerce and Navigation with Japan, 4 U.S.T. 2063, T.I.A.S. 2863. While that contention is properly before us, the plaintiffs 
have not had the opportunity to respond to it. We have scheduled argument on the Sharp defendants' contentions based on the 
1953 Treaty for June 18, 1980. "
694,9," Some of the defendants have also argued that plaintiffs' 1916 Act claims should be dismissed because U.S. consumer 
electronic products do not have an ""actual market value or wholesale price"" in Japan. They rely on Outboard Marine Corp. v. 
Pezetel, 461 F.Supp. 384, 408-09 (D.Del.1978), in which Judge Schwartz dismissed a claim under the 1916 Antidumping Act for 
the alleged dumping of golf carts manufactured in Poland. It was undisputed in Pezetel that the defendants' golf carts were not 
sold in Poland and were not commonly exported to third countries, but were sold only in the U.S. Judge Schwartz ruled that the 
1916 Act does not provide a private right of action to challenge activity in a single market, i. e., the United States, and 
accordingly dismissed the dumping claims. The defendants in the instant case try to assimilate this litigation to Pezetel by arguing that there are no relevant sales in Japan 
because products made for sale in the U.S. are not sold in Japan. This argument, however, ""puts the rabbit in the hat"" by 
assuming that the consumer electronic products which defendants concede are sold in Japan are not comparable with those 
sold in the U. S., either because they are not identical or because they are not sufficiently similar. In Pezetel, in contrast, there 
were no sales of golf carts of any type in Poland or in relevant third countries. Because defendants' argument relying on Pezetel 
assumes what is to be proved, i. e., that the standard for comparability of products under the 1916 Act is not met here, we 
consider it to be merely an alternate verbal formulation of defendants' main arguments on comparability."
694,10," While the differences with which we are concerned in this opinion are those between U.S. products, as a class, and Japanese 
products, as a class, there are also, in some instances, individual differences between the particular products which plaintiffs 
have sought to pair for their dumping comparisons. Such individual differences are revealed in the model-by-model matchups to 
which we will refer in our discussion of the factual record. See pp. 1202-1203, infra. The defendants have not based their 
arguments on these individual differences; neither however have they conceded that the class-by-class differences are the only 
pertinent ones. "
695,11," All told, the various defendants submitted a total of 13 briefs which deal, in whole or in part, with issues discussed in this 
opinion. The plaintiffs submitted 8 briefs. In addition, we heard extensive oral argument on the motions."
695,11," a Sears Roebuck has recently filed a motion arguing that Zenith's dumping claims against it, which were made in Zenith's 
Counterclaim filed March 17, 1977, are barred by the statute of limitations. Sears, which is not a defendant in the NUE action, 
contends that the relevant statute of limitations is the Pennsylvania six-year statute, 12 P.S.  § 31. In addition, Motorola contends in a recent motion that the dumping claim against it must be dismissed because Zenith has failed 
to set forth in the FPS any facts supporting a dumping claim against Motorola. Motorola is not a defendant in the NUE action."
695,12," [**25]  We reject the contention of defendants Mitsubishi Corporation and Mitsubishi International Corporation that plaintiffs 
cannot establish predatory intent with respect to defendants whose market share in sales of consumer electronic products in the 
United States is small. The 1916 Antidumping Act, unlike e. g. section 2 of the Sherman Act, does not require plaintiffs to show 
that any defendant's predatory intent was accompanied by a dangerous probability of success. Thus the plaintiff is entitled to 
attempt to establish a defendant's predatory intent by inference, even if the defendant's small market share makes it unlikely that 
it will succeed in injuring American industry. Moreover, plaintiffs claim that all the Japanese defendants and their coconspirators "
696,," joined a conspiracy which had the requisite predatory intent; if the plaintiffs can produce evidence aliunde of the conspiracy and 
of particular defendants' membership in it, the defendants who joined the conspiracy will be chargeable with its intent. "
697,13," We reject the contention of defendant MELCO that the record for summary judgment closed at some date prior to the filing of 
plaintiffs' Expert Witness Reports and Final Pretrial Statement. See discussion in our opinion on subject matter jurisdiction filed 
this day, 494 F.Supp. 1161, 1168-1170."
697,14," In addition, defendants have referred to the deposition testimony of Walter C. Fisher, a Zenith executive, and to a letter of 
William G. Frick, Executive Vice President of Zenith International Sales Corp., dated February 7, 1974, produced as Zenith 
Document Nos. 30519-20. The Fisher testimony and Frick letter are primarily relevant to cost issues which we do not consider. 
See n. 23, infra."
697,15," Plaintiffs have also referred to statements in Toshiba Document No. TJ 4629 (Zenith Document No. 4863). According to 
plaintiffs' translation of that document, S. Yajima, a Toshiba employee, wrote ""(t)he same thing exported is to be sold 
domestically."" In context, the statement appears to refer to the cabinet for a television receiver. In light of the undisputed physical 
differences between U.S. and Japanese television receivers, see text infra, and although we are mindful of our duty to make all 
inferences favorable to the plaintiffs, we cannot infer from this lone statement that there is a genuine issue of fact as to the 
specific differences detailed infra."
697,16," We required plaintiffs to prepare and file these model-by-model matchups during the discovery phase of this case in order to 
inform the defendants of plaintiffs' contentions concerning their dumping claims and the manner in which plaintiffs intend to 
prove their dumping case at trial, so that defendants would be able to prepare their defenses. The requirement for specific 
model-by-model matchups was necessary because there were literally thousands of television models made by the defendants 
during the relevant time period, and many models of non-television products. As a result there was a virtually limitless number of 
possible pairings of models upon which plaintiffs might base their dumping claims. We required plaintiffs to select a limited 
number of home market and export models to pair for comparison. Because of the great technical detail involved in the selection 
of models for comparison, and more particularly because of the technical differences which were not considered by plaintiffs' 
experts in preparing model-by-model matchups, the matchups shed considerable light on the instant motions. "

700,18," The defendants' affiant Gordon A. Reichard avers that a fourth component, the Video Intermediate Frequency System, would 
have to be altered or replaced. The VHF and UHF tuners in a television receiver convert the broadcast frequencies which they 
receive to a lower frequency known as the intermediate frequency (""IF"") for transmission to the Video Intermediate Frequency 
System. The IF still has encoded upon it the audio and video information which will eventually be used to produce sound and 
pictures, after being processed by the Video Intermediate Frequency System and other components of the television receiver. 
The intermediate frequencies in use in the United States and in Japan are different. In the United States, the IF is 45.75 Mhz for 
video and 41.25 Mhz for audio; in Japan, the IF is 58.75 Mhz for video and 54.25 Mhz for audio. Although Reichard states that a 
TV receiver designed for use in one market could not be used in the other market without changes in the Video Intermediate 
Frequency System, presumably to accommodate the admitted difference in IF values, plaintiffs' affiant Vito Brugliera avers that 
physically and electronically identical components of this type could be used in the U.S. and in Japan. There is thus a genuine 
issue of fact on this point, but the issue is not material since the other differences between U.S. and Japanese products are 
sufficient for summary judgment under the legal standard formulated in Part V of this opinion."
700,19," [**39]  Although receivers with only these differences would be physically capable of operation in both countries, receivers 
which are operable in Japan might not be legally operable in the United States because of federal standards governing the 
emission of radiation. See 21 C.F.R. Part 1020 (1979). "

704,21," UHF channel allocations of the U.S. and Japan are listed in the 1966 World Radio TV Handbook (20th ed.) at 249 (attached to 
Report of Walter Lukas)."
704,22," For example, Vito Brugliera has stated in more than one affidavit that ""television receiver sets manufactured for sale in Japan 
do not differ in any significant respect, either from a technical or cost standpoint, from television receivers manufactured by 
Japanese manufacturers or others for sale in the United States."" In another affidavit, Brugliera avers, ""Monochrome and color 
television receivers in each market are electronically identical, function by function by virtue of the NTSC standard. That 
components may differ between domestic and export receivers is of little consequence from a design viewpoint."" And Brugliera 
and Karl Horn, in their expert witness report, state: It is our opinion that such products are comparable at the functional, technological and manufacturing level. Any purported 
differences, once one understands the technical issues, are not significant. Walter Lukas, the plaintiffs' other expert witness on technical issues, explaining the model-by-model matchups which he 
constructed, wrote: In this comparison of television receivers, the following general considerations do not materially impact upon technological 
comparability: "
705,," (1) Minor modifications of VHF and UHF tuners and video intermediate frequency amplifiers reflect a slight variance in channel 
allocations for the markets in Japan and the U.S. . . . . (2) Power sources available for television receiver operation in Japan are 100 Volts, 50/60 Hz; in the U. S., 120 Volts, 60 Hz. 
(These voltage characteristics constitute the prevalent standard used for television receivers in those markets.) Lukas concludes, ""My opinion . . . is that such television receivers are practically identical in substantially all material 
technological respects."""
705,22," a  [**45]  In addition to the physical differences we have discussed, TV receivers are constructed differently to comply with legal 
safety standards applicable in the U. S., see n. 18, supra, and in Japan. The nature of the Japanese standards, and the physical 
differences which the two sets of standards necessitate, have not been developed in the record before us. Since the different 
safety standards render TV receivers manufactured for one market legally unmarketable in the other, this difference also 
supports the grant of summary judgment on the plaintiffs' 1916 Act claims with respect to television receivers."
705,23," As a result, we need not consider the record which the parties have made on the relative cost of production of television 
receivers for the U.S. and for Japan. Specifically, we do not consider the 1974 letter of William G. Frick and the deposition 
testimony of Walter C. Fisher, see n. 14, supra, concerning Zenith's plans to market U. S.-made television receivers in Japan, 
the investment that Zenith determined would be necessary to modify its product for the Japanese market, and the ultimate 
abandonment of Zenith's plans. Defendants contend, on the basis of the Frick letter, the Fisher testimony, and Gordon Reichard's affidavit of April 16, 1979, that 
there are no genuine issues of fact as to differences in the relative cost of manufacturing television receivers for the Japanese 
and American markets and as to the investment required to switch production facilities from one type of receiver to the other. Reichard avers that in order to convert a color television model manufactured for the United States market so that it could be 
used in the Japanese market, it would be necessary to set up special production facilities, to obtain new test equipment, and to 
invest a minimum of $ 100,000 in new capital equipment. Defendants interpret the Fisher testimony and Frick letter as support 
for this position, since Frick concluded that ""it is not economically feasible for Zenith to enter the Japanese market with 
Television products,"" and Fisher explained the reasons for that decision in his deposition testimony. Plaintiffs' affiants Brugliera, 
Schupp, and Mainiero state, however, that the steps which Reichard says are necessary to change from production of U.S. to 
production of Japanese TV receivers may or may not be necessary, depending on other economic factors, such as production 
volume, and technological factors. As we have previously noted, Brugliera avers in other affidavits that the differences in the cost 
of manufacturing products for the U.S. market or for the Japanese market are insignificant. In light of the averments of plaintiffs' 
affiants, we could not conclude that there are no genuine issues of fact either with respect to the relative cost of production of 
U.S. and Japanese products, or with respect to the investment necessary to change over production facilities from one product 
to the other. For the reasons stated in the text, however, we do not view these issues as material to the disposition of the 
summary judgment motions. "
706,24," Mr. Brugliera testified as follows: Q. Just a simple question. If you plugged the Japanese set in the wall, do you know what would happen here in the United 
States? A. If you plugged it into the wall, it would probably operate, depending on how good their power supply circuit was. It would 
probably run hot. You would probably receive at least four or five channels here.Q. How long could you operate it that way? A. As I said, depending on how good their power supply design was.Q. Suppose they had a poor power supply design.A. Well, it 
would get hot.Q. What would happen then? A. You are talking about the AC line differences. In Japan it is 100 volts, 50 or 60 cycles. Here it is 120 volts, and from an 
engineering point of view, that is nothing.Q. But what would happen to the set, anything? A. As I said, depending on the power supply. Some of them might last indefinitely. Some of them might overheat and go. It is a 
function of individual design, but it is a minor engineering difference. While Brugliera testified that certain Japanese TV sets might not ""overheat and go"" in the U. S., we do not require the moving 
defendants to demonstrate that there is no genuine issue of material fact with respect to overheating of particular specified 
models because the frequency difference, which applies to all TV receivers without exception, would by itself be sufficient to 
justify the grant of summary judgment. "
707,25," Brugliera testified: A. There are two things. One is misapplication of something designed for one market versus the technology and cost associated 
with designing for each of those specific markets. If you want to stretch the analogy, I will grant you would be misapplying a Japanese domestic TV model by plugging it into U.S. 
wall outlet, but I am saying that it is not very difficult to design for either market, knowing the environment you are going to face, 
and that the cost differentials are miniscule. I am saying you could build the same set and just have a different module for the 
power supply and substitute A or B and have a different tuner package and substitute A or B, depending upon which market you 
were designing for. Q. But going really to the set as it was designed for use in Japan as opposed to this set as it was designed for use in the United 
States, would you state that it would be a misapplication to attempt to use the one or the other in the foreign market? A. Yes, but that is saying, for instance, do you drive a British car in the U. S.? You normally wouldn't. You could if you wanted to. I could take a Japanese set and use what is called a variable transformer and operate it all the time."
707,26," [**50]  Brugliera testified: Q. But it is a different component or tuner in each set, is that right? A. The tuners are different well, if the tuners are click stop, you know, individual channels, they would be different; but, for 
instance, if you were using what we call a strip tuner, which is a mechanical tuner that has plastic strips in it that have resistors 
and capacitors and coils on them, you could use the mechanical housing in the electronic circuits and just interchange the strips. 
. . . Q. When you are talking about interchanging the strips, would that be from a lab or technical end? In other words, if you were a 
consumerA. A consumer could conceivably do it.Q. Let's say the average consumer A. It would usually be a technician at a technical level because you normally don't want a customer getting inside the set. Although Brugliera's statement that ""you normally don't want a customer getting inside the set"" was made during a discussion of 
strip tuners, we view it as of wider import. Brugliera admitted that modification of a set designed for use in Japan to make it 
operable in the U.S. requires at least the substitution of different tuner and power supply components. n. 25, supra. The record 
reveals no instances of television receivers which are designed so that the necessary substitution can be made without ""getting 
inside the set."" It follows from these facts and from Brugliera's statement quoted above that the necessary substitution would 
normally be made by a technician, and not by the consumer. HN2[
] We note that although we must, on these summary 
judgment motions, make all inferences in favor of the plaintiffs, we are not required to ignore the rules of logic. See First National 
Bank of Arizona v. Cities Service, Co., 391 U.S. 253, 287-89, 88 S.Ct. 1575, 1591-92, 20 L.Ed.2d 569 (1968). "

708,28," The only affidavit submitted by defendants in support of the summary judgment motions on Zenith's 1916 Act claims with 
respect to non-television products is that of Harry E. Ruther, Jr., an electrical engineer employed by Sears, Roebuck and Co. An 
affidavit of Vito Brugliera responds to Ruther on behalf of Zenith. The expert witness report of Brugliera and Karl Horn addresses 
itself to the comparability of non-television products and explains the construction of Zenith's model-by-model matchups of 
allegedly comparable products. The plaintiff's FPS sets forth Zenith's dumping claims for non-television products, vol. 17 at 
8149-64, and includes voluminous price comparison reports submitted as Appendix J. The price comparisons are based on 
model-by-model matchups listed in the FPS at 8151-64. According to the FPS, those matchups are to be authenticated by the 
testimony of Horn and Brugliera, and consequently we assume that the matchups were constructed according to the methods 
stated in the Horn/Brugliera expert witness report. As a result, the validity of Zenith's non-television dumping claims as set forth 
with preclusive effect in the FPS is dependent on the validity of the model-by-model matchups constructed by Horn and 
Brugliera, which in turn depends on whether or not we share their assumption that the physical differences recounted in the text 
are legally significant. See pp. 1203-1204, supra. The Ruther and Brugliera affidavits, the Horn/Brugliera report, and the model-by-model matchups in the FPS are all concerned 
solely with radios, phonographs, and tape and cassette recorders. None of these sources include stereo and audio instruments 
or electronic components, even though these two categories of electronic products were included in Zenith's complaint and 
counterclaim. We have previously ruled that Zenith has abandoned its dumping claim with respect to electronic components by 
failing to include them in its previous submission of model-by-model comparisons. See Pretrial Orders No. 146 at p. 233 (Feb. 
27, 1979); No. 165 at pp. 76 & 97-98 (Apr. 23, 1979); No. 222 at 153-57 (Jan. 16, 1980). Since stereo and audio instruments are 
not mentioned in any of the evidentiary sources which we have consulted in deciding the instant motions, we do not deal with 
them here. At a subsequent pretrial conference we will take up the question whether or not stereo and audio instruments remain 
in this case. See n. 63, infra. "
709,29," Vito Brugliera states that ""radios, phonographs and open reel and cassette tape recorders manufactured for sale in Japan do 
not differ in any significant respect either from a technical or cost standpoint from similar items manufactured by Japanese 
manufacturers or others for sale in the United States."" He avers that to prevent objectionable hum ""only minor technical 
modifications are necessary,"" that the problem of motor speed may be solved by ""a simple mechanical modification"" and that the 
differences in the FM band are ""of no technical significance."" The Horn/Brugliera report observes, e. g., that the differing voltage 
and power frequency of alternating current in the U.S. and Japan is ""easily accommodated"" in tape recorders ""by interchanging 
two components: the electric drive motor and power transformer,"" and concludes that the products are ""technically comparable."""
709,30," [**56]  The factual record with respect to non-television products does not include averments as to the effects of the operation 
in the U.S. of products designed for use in Japan. Thus we cannot add here, as we did in our discussion of TV receivers, the 
words ""and vice versa."" This difference is immaterial, however, for the fact that the differences stated in the text affect consumer 
use and marketability in Japan is sufficient by itself to preclude comparison of the products for purposes of the 1916 Act. "
711,31," 15 U.S.C.  § 72 (quoted in full at n. 4, supra ). The Act also permits ""actual market value or wholesale price"" to be calculated 
with respect to the principal markets ""of other foreign countries to which (the articles) are commonly exported."" Id. However, this 
provision is of no significance in the instant litigation since the plaintiffs have not sought to compare U.S. prices with values 
derived from sales of consumer electronic products in any nation other than the country of their production, Japan. In our 
discussion, we will frequently abbreviate the statutory language quoted in the text by referring to the ""actual market value."""
711,32," Section 2 of the Clayton Act, as enacted in 1914, provides in full as follows: Sec. 2. That it shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, either directly or 
indirectly to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities, which commodities are sold for use, 
consumption, or resale within the United States or any Territory thereof or the District of Columbia or any insular 
possession or other place under the jurisdiction of the United States, where the effect of such discrimination may be to 
substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce: Provided, That nothing herein 
contained shall prevent discrimination in price between purchasers of commodities on account of differences in the grade, 
quality, or quantity of the commodity sold, or that makes only due allowance for difference in the cost of selling or 
transportation, or discrimination in price in the same or different communities made in good faith to meet competition: And

711,33," [**65]  Section 1 of the Robinson-Patman Act, 49 Stat. 1526 (1936), made extensive amendments in section 2 of the Clayton 
Act; the amended section is often referred to simply as ""the Robinson-Patman Act,"" since the original version of section 2 of the 
Clayton Act is no longer operative. In our discussion, we refer to the ""Robinson-Patman amendments"" and the ""Robinson-
Patman Act"" interchangeably, depending on the context. Section 2(a) of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman 
Act, which is the only portion of the amended section 2 which we consider in this opinion, reads in full as follows: HN6[
] (a) It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, either directly or 
indirectly, to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality, where either or any 
of the purchases involved in such discrimination are in commerce, where such commodities are sold for use, consumption, 
or resale within the United States or any Territory thereof or the District of Columbia or any insular possession or other 
place under the jurisdiction of the United States, and where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen 
competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any 
person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them: 
Provided, That nothing herein contained shall prevent differentials which make only due allowance for differences in the 
cost of manufacture, sale, or delivery resulting from the differing methods or quantities in which such commodities are to 
such purchasers sold or delivered: Provided, however, That the Federal Trade Commission may, after due investigation 
and hearing to all interested parties, fix and establish quantity limits, and revise the same as it finds necessary, as to 
particular commodities or classes of commodities, where it finds that available purchasers in greater quantities are so few 
as to render differentials on account thereof unjustly discriminatory or promotive of monopoly in any line of commerce; and 
the foregoing shall then not be construed to permit differentials based on differences in quantities greater than those so 
fixed and established: And provided further, That nothing herein contained shall prevent persons engaged in selling goods, 
wares, or merchandise in commerce from selecting their own customers in bona fide transactions and not in restraint of 
trade: And provided further, That nothing herein contained shall prevent price changes from time to time where in response "

719,43," Platforms, supra n.39, at 195."
719,44," The Wilson administration took the same position. The antidumping provision recommended by Secretary of Commerce 
Redfield was conceived as ""supplemental to the Clayton Antitrust Act"" and was not intended to retard ""that normal ebb and flow 
of legitimate commerce between our land and all others which will provide for our people the security against exaction which is 
insured by reasonable competition: See pp. 1219-1220, supra. In a letter to the New York Times published on July 4, 1916, 
Assistant Attorney General Samuel J. Graham stated the administration's position on the pending antidumping provision: Any anti-dumping provision is not a matter of taxation, or, strictly speaking, tariff. It is a power exercised under the commerce 
clause of the constitution and not under the taxing clause. Its purpose should be to prevent unfair competition. Just as we have 
said to our own people by the Clayton Act that they should not indulge in unfair competition, so we propose to say the same to 
the foreigner. Quoted in J. Viner, supra n. 1, at 243 n. 1. "
720,44," a The references in the legislative history to ""the same unfair competition law"" do not specify the Clayton Act, and could be read 
to refer to the Sherman Act instead. However, the Sherman Act is not concerned primarily with price discrimination, although 
pricing behavior may be relevant to its prohibitions of combinations in restraint of trade and of attempted or actual 
monopolization. Since the 1916 Act is a price discrimination law, it makes more sense to infer that Representative Kitchin and 
the House Ways and Means Committee were referring to § 2 of the Clayton Act, another price discrimination law, passed less 
than two years before, which is expressly limited in its scope to domestic transactions. Moreover, both Secretary of Commerce 
Redfield and Assistant Attorney General Graham viewed the proposed antidumping legislation as supplemental to the Clayton 
Act, not the Sherman Act. See pp. 1219-1220 & n. 44, supra. "

726,49," Although the plaintiffs' affiant and expert witnesses aver that U.S. and Japanese consumer electronic products are 
""comparable"" and ""similar,"" their opinions are not controlling. We cannot stop our inquiry here and rule that there is a genuine 
issue of fact as to the similarity of the products, without exploring the legal standard in greater depth. As we demonstrate in the 
text to follow, there are available sources of law which control the interpretation of the term ""similar"" in this litigation. One such 
source is the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, which is considered at pp. 1231-1234, infra. The other 
source is customs appraisement law, which is considered at pp. 1234-1239, infra. As the court observed in Nichols & Company 
v. United States, 59 C.C.P.A. 67, 72, 454 F.2d 1183, 1187 (1972), ""the word 'similar' has a very specific and slightly out of the 
ordinary meaning in this context in customs law."" Given the more precise legal standard governing the comparability of products, which is derived from these two sources of law, 
we shall hold that the issues of fact as to the technical comparability of U.S. and Japanese consumer electronic products, while 
genuine, are not material. Although plaintiffs' affiant and witnesses characterize the technical differences between U.S. and "
727,," Japanese products as minor or insignificant, the legal significance of those differences is an issue of law to be decided by the 
court. Legal conclusions stated in an affidavit or an expert witness report do not raise an issue of material fact so as to preclude 
the grant of summary judgment."
727,50," The Justice Department has trenchantly criticized the economic impact of the Robinson-Patman Act. United States 
Department of Justice, Report on the Robinson-Patman Act (1977). Without expressing any opinion on the economic arguments 
of the Justice Department report, we note our concurrence with the Department's observation that the use of the word 
""discrimination"" to describe the behavior forbidden by the Robinson-Patman Act and by the 1916 Antidumping Act carries with it 
no undertones of moral condemnation: The word 'discrimination' has a pejorative connotation derived from its use in other contexts, e. g. racial or religious 
discrimination. A proper understanding of its use in economic terms requires a conscious effort to disassociate the word's social 
meanings. Id. at 4 n. 4."

728,53," As the Supreme Court has observed, ""the legislative history of these amendments leaves no doubt that Congress was intent

1267, 1271-1272, 4 L.Ed.2d 1385 (1960). Thus if any change were intended by Congress in altering the verbal formulation of the 
""grade"" and ""quality"" provisions, the change must have been in the direction of expanding the coverage of the Act. In other 
words, the ""like grade and quality"" provision of the Robinson-Patman Act must adopt either the same standard as the 
corresponding provision of the Clayton Act, or a less exacting standard which broadened the coverage of the Act. If the moving 
parties can show that the products are insufficiently similar to meet the standard of ""like grade and quality,"" then a fortiori the 
products are insufficiently similar to meet the equally or more exacting standard of the pre-1936 Clayton Act."
728,54," In Checker Motors, the plaintiff claimed that Chrysler sold automobiles for use as taxicabs at a lower price than it sold similar 
automobiles for use as private passenger cars, in violation of the Robinson-Patman Act. The defendant moved for summary 
judgment, arguing that its taxicabs and its private cars were not ""of like grade and quality."" The court stated the standard by 
which ""like grade and quality"" would be determined, and denied summary judgment on that issue because there was a genuine 
issue of material fact as to whether or not the differences between Chrysler's taxicabs and its passenger cars were ""substantial 
enough to affect consumer use, preference or marketability."" 283 F.Supp. at 889. "

730,57," [**136]  McClelland, G. A. Decided January 28, 1921. Opinion. The Merchandise which is the subject of this appeal consists of photographic dry plates 3 1/4 by 4 inches, imported from London 
and invoiced at 2/6 per dozen, less 40 per cent discount. The appraiser advanced them to 3/-per dozen, allowing the same 
discount. The importing company seeks to maintain the invoice value upon the theory that while similar photographic dry plates 
are manufactured and sold in England for home consumption this particular size is manufactured expressly for export, and that 
by reason of such fact the market value ought to be found under the last provision of paragraph L of the tariff act of 1913 based 
upon the selling price of such plates in the United States, due allowance by deduction being made for estimated duties, etc., as 
therein provided. From the evidence submitted I do not believe that this contention is tenable. It is shown that similar plates are manufactured by 
several English concerns and sold for home consumption in England, and the price lists of several of these manufacturing 
concerns are in evidence. In all of these price lists the per se prices are the same, but they show varying discounts. The plates 
of the various manufacturers, including those covered by this importation, differ only as to size. The list price of the size 3 1/2 by 
3 1/2 inches, equalling 12 1/4 square inches, is listed at 3/-, while the size 3 1/4 by 4 1/4 , equalling 13 13/16 square inches, is 
listed at 3/6 . The plates in question, equaling 13 square inches, are invoiced at 6d. per dozen less than the list price of 3 1/2 by 
3 1/2 inches, and it would seem to follow that the market value should be at least what the smaller size plates were listed at. Paragraph R of the tariff act of 1913, supra, provides That the words ""value,"" or ""actual market value,"" or ""wholesale price,"" wherever used in this act, or in any law relating to the 
appraisement of imported merchandise, shall be construed to be the actual market value or wholesale price of such, or similar 
merchandise comparable in value therewith, as defined in this act. "
731,," I find from the evidence that plates similar to those under consideration are freely offered for sale in wholesale quantities in 
England, and that therefore, for the purpose of appraisement, in view of this provision in Paragraph R, resort may not be had to 
the provisions of paragraph L, supra. To hold that such recourse had to be taken in all cases where it could not be shown that 
merchandise in every minor detail the same as that the subject of appraisement had been sold in the principal markets of the 
country of exportation would be simply to create chaos in the work of appraising officers. The examiner was, it seems to me, not 
only liberal in the finding of the per se value but was equally liberal in the allowance of discount, and I therefore affirm his action. Photographic Dry Plates, C.R. 30586, aff'd mem., C.R. 30870 (1921)."
731,58," [**137]  Decided November 2, 1921. Sullivan, G. A. Opinion. The merchandise under consideration consists of lamp chimneys purchased in Germany, the entered 
value being marks 12.30 per dozen, and the purchase price being marks 18.64 per dozen. They were appraised at the purchase 
price. It appears this is the price required to be paid by exporters, and that the home price for use in Germany is marks 12.30 per 
dozen. There may be some question as to whether or not the identical merchandise is sold for domestic use. It is unquestioned that 
similar or comparable merchandise is sold in Germany for domestic use, the only difference being that the merchandise under 
consideration consists of a street lamp chimney glass bulged, while the comparable merchandise consists of a street chimney 
lamp glass without the bulge. The latter is used in Germany; the former from a sale made to an American importer to be used in 
the city of Baltimore. It is clear from the testimony there is practically the same amount of glass, the same amount of workmanship, and the same 
price for the straight as for the bulged glass. That being the fact, the domestic price is what governs, and I sustain the entered 
value. These importations were made prior to the emergency tariff act of 1921. Blown Glass Chimneys, C.R. 31289, aff'd mem., C.R. 31459 (1921) & 31608 (1922)."
731,59," Between 1913 and 1921, ""actual market value"" as defined in P R of the 1913 Tariff Act was the principal valuation standard for 
imported merchandise. If ""actual market value"" under P R could not be calculated, appraisement would be made on the basis of 
cost of production or of wholesale price in the United States, as provided in P L of the 1913 Act. See Goodyear Tire & Rubber 
Co. v. United States, 11 Ct.Cust.App. 351 (1922). In the Emergency Tariff Act of 1921, Congress added a new standard for the 
appraisement of imported merchandise: export value, defined as follows: Sec. 302. That for the purposes of this title the export value of imported merchandise shall be the price, at the time of exportation 
of such merchandise to the United States, at which such or similar merchandise is sold or freely offered for sale to all purchasers 
in the principal markets of the country from which exported, in the usual wholesale quantities and in the ordinary course of trade, 
for exportation to the United States, plus, when not included in such price, the cost of all containers and coverings and all other 
costs, charges, and expenses incident to placing the merchandise in condition, packed ready for shipment to the United States, 
less the amount, if any, included in such price, attributable to any additional costs, charges, and expenses, and United States 
import duties, incident to bringing the merchandise from the place of shipment in the country of exportation to the place of 
delivery in the United States, and plus, if not included in such price, the amount of any export tax imposed by the country of 
exportation on merchandise exported to the United States."
731,42," Stat. 15-16 (1921). The principal difference between this definition and the one in P R of the 1913 Act, quoted in full at n. 36, 
supra, is that export value as defined in the 1921 Act is the price at which merchandise is offered for sale in the relevant foreign 
market ""for exportation to the United States."" The Supreme Court had ruled in United States v. Passavant, 169 U.S. 16, 18 S.Ct. "
732,219," , 42 L.Ed. 644 (1898), that actual market value had reference to the price at which merchandise was offered for sale in the 
foreign market for home consumption in the foreign country, interpreting § 19 of the Customs Administrative Act of 1890. The 
same definition of actual market value was subsequently incorporated into P R of the 1913 Tariff Act, compare 169 U.S. at 21-
22, 18 S.Ct. at 222 with n. 36, supra. By 1921, because of the postwar currency inflation in Europe, the export value and the 
actual market value for home consumption of the same goods were often highly divergent. See R. Smith, Customs Valuation in 
the United States 138-39 (1948); B. Levett, Through the Customs Maze 37-38 (1923). Congress provided in § 303(a) of the 
Emergency Tariff Act of 1921 that thereafter all references to the value of imported merchandise should ""be construed to refer . . 
. to actual market value as defined by the law in existence at the time of the enactment of this Act, or to export value as defined 
by section 302 of this Act, whichever is higher."" 42 Stat. 16 (1921). The Antidumping Act of 1916 was excepted from the change 
in valuation made by § 303(a). See p. 1216, supra. To summarize, immediately prior to the enactment of the Tariff Act of 1922, imported merchandise was appraised by the 
following hierarchy of appraisement standards: (1) The actual market value as defined in /R of the 1913 Act, or the export value as defined in § 302 of the 1921 Act, whichever 
was higher; (2) The cost of production, or the wholesale price in the United States, as defined in /L of the 1913 Act, if actual market value 
could not be ascertained. In the Tariff Act of 1922, Congress continued the valuation system of existing law, with minor changes. H.R.Rep. No. 1223, 67th 
Cong., 2d Sess. 148 (1922) (quoted in the text following this footnote). However, Congress changed the name ""actual market 
value"" used in the 1913 Act to ""foreign value,"" and shortened its definition somewhat. Section 402(a)-(c) of the Tariff Act of 1922 
read as follows: Sec. 402. VALUE. (a) For the purposes of this Act, the value of imported merchandise shall be (1) The foreign value or the export value, whichever is higher; (2) If neither the foreign value nor the export value can be ascertained to the satisfaction of the appraising officers, then the 
United States value; (3) If neither the foreign value, the export value, nor the United States value can be ascertained to the satisfaction of the 
appraising officers, then the cost of production; (4) If there be any similar competitive article manufactured or produced in the United States of a class or kind upon which the 
President has made public a finding as provided in subdivision (b) of section 315 of Title III of this Act, then the American selling 
price of such article. (b) The foreign value of imported merchandise shall be the market value or the price at the time of exportation of such 
merchandise to the United States, at which such or similar merchandise is freely offered for sale to all purchasers in the principal 
markets of the country from which exported, in the usual wholesale quantities and in the ordinary course of trade, including the 
cost of all containers and coverings of whatever nature, and all other costs, charges, and expenses incident to placing the 
merchandise in condition, packed ready for shipment to the United States. (c) The export value of imported merchandise shall be the market value or the price, at the time of exportation of such 
merchandise to the United States, at which such or similar merchandise is freely offered for sale to all purchasers in the principal 
markets of the country from which exported, in the usual wholesale quantities and in the ordinary course of trade, for exportation 
to the United States, plus, when not included in such price, the cost of all containers and coverings of whatever nature, and all 
other costs, charges, and expenses incident to placing the merchandise in condition, packed ready for shipment to the United 
States. If in the ordinary course of trade imported merchandise is shipped to the United States to an agent of the seller, or to the 
seller's branch house, pursuant to an order or an agreement to purchase (whether placed or entered into in the United States or 
in the foreign country), for delivery to the purchaser in the United States, and if the title to such merchandise remains in the seller 
until such delivery, then such merchandise shall not be deemed to be freely offered for sale in the principal markets of the 
country from which exported for exportation to the United States, within the meaning of this subdivision."
732,42," Stat. 949 (1922). It is apparent both from the place which ""foreign value"" occupied in the overall valuation system established 
in § 402(a) and from the definition of ""foreign value"" in § 402(b) that despite minor changes in the definition, Congress intended 
""foreign value"" to correspond to ""actual market value"" as defined in P R of the 1913 Tariff Act, see n. 36, supra. Consequently 
we may consult the construction of the term ""similar"" in decisions interpreting § 402(b) of the Tariff Act of 1922 in order to 
determine the meaning of the word ""similar"" as used in the Tariff Act of 1913. "
733,60," The valuation system in § 402 of the Tariff Act of 1930 was essentially the same as that in § 402 of the Tariff Act of 1922. 
Compare 46 Stat. 708 (1930) (codified with amendments at 19 U.S.C.  § 1402) with 42 Stat. 949 (1922) (quoted in pertinent part 
at n. 59, supra ). In the Customs Simplification Act of 1956, Congress revised the valuation system, 70 Stat. 943 (1956) (codified 
at 19 U.S.C.  § 1401a), while providing that the 1930 system should remain in effect with respect to certain imported articles. 
See 19 U.S.C.  § 1402. While the details of the appraisement provisions are not relevant here, what is relevant is that the appraisement statutes 
continued to refer to ""such or similar merchandise,"" and the customs courts continued to interpret the word ""similar"" in that 
phrase by referring to the leading cases of Irving Massin, supra, and Wecker, supra, decided under the Tariff Act of 1922. For 
example, in United States v. Eggen, 55 C.C.P.A. 95, 100 (1968), the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals quoted the legal 
standard for determining similarity from Massin and also analyzed the Wecker decision. In United States v. Ford Motor Co., 46 
Cust.Ct. 735, 740, the court set forth the standard of similarity stated in Massin, quoting virtually identical language from a 
subsequent decision of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals which adhered to the Massin rule. Since these decisions are 
applications of the Massin rule, which we have held should also be applied in the interpretation of the 1913 Tariff Act, and 
thereby to the interpretation of the 1916 Antidumping Act, we are justified in relying on Eggen, supra, and Ford Motor, supra, in 
the construction of the 1916 Act. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 includes both an antidumping provision which we have previously considered, p. 1223 & n. 
45, supra, and a revision of the valuation system for imported goods. The new valuation law includes a statutory definition of 
""similar merchandise"" which is essentially the same as the definition found in customs case law beginning with Irving Massin, "
734,," supra, and Wecker, supra. The definition provides, inter alia, that ""similar merchandise"" must be ""commercially interchangeable 
with the merchandise being appraised."" Pub.L. No. 96-39, 93 Stat. 201 (1979), 19 U.S.C.A.  § 1401a(h)(4) (1980). "
735,61," The ""slightest doubt"" formulation of the evidentiary standard for summary judgment has been explicitly rejected by the Second 
Circuit. Beal v. Lindsay, 468 F.2d 287, 291 (2d Cir. 1972). The National Commission for the Review of Antitrust Laws and 
Procedures, appointed pursuant to Executive Order 12022 to make recommendations on ""(r)evision of procedural and 
substantive rules of law needed to expedite the resolution of complex antitrust cases,"" criticized the ""slightest doubt"" formulation 
as ""an unwarranted gloss on the 'genuine issue' requirement."" National Commission for the Review of Antitrust Laws and 
Procedures, Report to the President and the Attorney General at 70, 80 F.R.D. 509, 566 (1979). However, the ""slightest doubt"" 
formulation has been adopted by the Third Circuit, Tomalewski, supra, 494 F.2d at 884, and by other circuits see Antitrust 
Commission Report at 79 n.44, 80 F.R.D. at 575, and is binding on this court, which must apply the law as stated by the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Of course, in order to preclude the grant of summary judgment, any doubt must be based 
on ""significant probative evidence"" rather than mere allegations.  First National Bank of Arizona v. Cities Service Co., 391 U.S. 
253, 289-90, 88 S.Ct. 1575, 1593, 20 L.Ed.2d 569 (1968); Tripoli Co. v. Wella Corp., 425 F.2d 932, 935-36 (3d Cir.) (en banc), 
cert. denied, 400 U.S. 831, 91 S.Ct. 62, 27 L.Ed.2d 62 (1970)."
735,62," The determination of the effects of the undisputed physical differences on consumer use, consumer preference, and 
marketability is necessarily hypothetical since it is undisputed that Japanese domestic electronic products have not been 
marketed in the United States. Our inference that the products are not usable to consumers or marketable in the country for 
which they were not designed is based on the rules of logic, see First National Bank of Arizona, supra, and on the characteristics 
of a hypothetical ""rational consumer."" The use of the term ""rational"" here is not meant to refer to any economic theory of 
maximization of utility, but rather to the ordinary common-sense meaning of the word. For example, we deem it clear beyond 
peradventure that a rational consumer would prefer a TV set which receives all broadcasts to one that only receives broadcasts 
on a limited number of channels. "
737,63," We are uncertain whether or not there are any products in this residual category which Zenith has sought to compare for 
purposes of its dumping claims. The list of technical comparisons of non-television products which plaintiff provided in the FPS, 
v. 17 at 8151-64, describes the products very briefly, e. g., ""AM radio."" This brief description is insufficient to enable us to 
determine whether a particular product is solely battery-operated and receives no FM radio transmissions, the two 
characteristics which together would protect the products from our summary judgment order. If there are no such products, then 
we have granted summary judgment for defendants on all of the plaintiffs' dumping claims. If the defendants can demonstrate 
that there are no products in this residual category, they may of course move for dismissal of Count VII of Zenith's Complaint 
and Count VI of Zenith's Counterclaim. We will take this matter up at our next regularly scheduled pretrial conference. See n. 28, 
supra."
737,64," Certification of an order for immediate interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C.  § 1292(b) is accomplished by placing in the order 
itself a statement that the court is of the opinion that the order involves a controlling question of law as to which there is a 
substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate 
termination of the litigation. This statement is prescribed by the language of § 1292(b). "
738,," Neither the plaintiffs nor the defendants have formally moved for certification of this opinion and order; obviously they could not 
since, as of this writing, they had not seen it. At a recent hearing, however, counsel for the parties, indicated in response to our 
inquiry that they would assuredly seek certification if the legal issue were decided adversely to their position. Pretrial Order No. 
236 (transcript of pretrial conference of April 2, 1980). Subsequently, however, plaintiffs' counsel informed us that plaintiffs would 
prefer to examine our opinion before deciding whether or not to seek § 1292(b) certification. HN15[
] We have the authority to certify our order under § 1292(b) sua sponte. See, e. g., Ettinger v. Central Penn National Bank, 2 B.R. 385 (E.D.Pa.1979) (Bechtle, J.); Bernstein v. Universal Pictures, Inc., 79 F.R.D. 59 (S.D.N.Y.1978); In re United 
States Financial Securities Litigation, 75 F.R.D. 702 (S.D.Cal.1977), rev'd on other grounds, 609 F.2d 411 (9th Cir. 1979). 
Because we are certain that the order should be certified, and in order to save the time that would be consumed by proceedings 
on a separate motion for certification, we have decided to include the certification in the order granting summary judgment. We 
are concerned over time because we wish to avoid slippage in the trial date. This case will be a decade old on December 21, 
1980. "
739,65," That portion of our order which dismisses Count I of the NUE complaint in Civil Action No. 74-3247 might also be appealable 
as a final judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) if the requisites of that Rule are met. See generally Curtiss-
Wright Corp. v. General Electric Co., 597 F.2d 35 (3d Cir.) rehearing en banc denied, 599 F.2d 1259 (3d Cir. 1979), cert. 
granted, 444 U.S. 823, 100 S.Ct. 43, 62 L.Ed.2d 29 (1979); Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Philadelphia Electric Co., 521 F.2d 360 (3d 
Cir. 1975). Since we have determined that the order should be certified for interlocutory appeal under § 1292(b), we do not reach 
the issues related to certification under Rule 54(b) for appeal as a final judgment. "
745,1, .  The substantive portions of the counterclaim are as follows:
745,3," . Upon information and belief, Cities have engaged in an unlawful combination and conspiracy among themselves and with 
others for the purpose of causing injury to FPL's business and property. The means employed by the Cities in furtherance of this 
combination and conspiracy have included, upon information and belief, joint and collusive conduct to obtain from FPL 
unreasonable and noncompensatory rates, terms and conditions for the purchase by them of wholesale power and transmission 
services; the commencement of numerous proceedings, including this litigation against FPL for the specific purpose, and with 
the specific intent, of coercing and harassing FPL into agreeing to demands made by the Cities of FPL; and attempting to induce 
municipalities in the State of Florida not to grant or renew franchises authorizing FPL to supply electricity to those municipalities 
and their residents."
745,4," . The actions by the Cities set forth in paragraph 3 above violate Section 1 of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. § 1) and Sections 
501.204(1) and 542.05 of the Florida Statutes, and constitute a tortious interference with advantageous relationships maintained 
by FPL with municipalities that have issued franchises to FPL. "
746,2," .  See, e.g., Larry R. George Sales Co. v. Cool Attic Corp., 587 F.2d 266, 273-74 (5th Cir. 1979) (per curiam ) (adopting the 
district court's Memorandum Opinion and Order) (and cases cited therein); cf.  Quinonez v. National Ass'n of Securities Dealers, 
Inc., 540 F.2d 824, 828 (5th Cir. 1976) (the pleading need not list ""with evidentiary specificity the acts complained of,"" but it 
""must comprehend a so-called prima facie case"") (""the alleged violations when combined with the rather complete exegesis of 
the facts relating to the plaintiff's plight gave ample notice of what was complained of""); Brett v. First Federal Savings & Loan 
Ass'n., 461 F.2d 1155, 1158 (5th Cir. 1972) (""although plaintiffs may be unable to allege specific facts proving actual acts of 
agreement or conspiracy, the pleadings are sufficient if they set forth facts from which an inference of unlawful agreement can 
be drawn""). Other courts of appeal and commentators agree that a conclusory allegation of an antitrust violation will not suffice. See, e.g., 
Heart Disease Research Foundation v. General Motors Corp., 463 F.2d 98 (2d Cir. 1972); SCM Corp. v. Radio Corporation of 
America, 407 F.2d 166 (2d Cir. 1969); Wright & Miller, supra § 1228 at 170; 2A Moore's Federal Practice P 8.17(3) at 1752 
(1978-79 Cumulative Supplement). "
747,3," .  E.g., Banco Continental v. Curtiss National Bank, 406 F.2d 510, 514 (5th Cir. 1969); Barber v. Motor Vessel ""Blue Cat"", 372 
F.2d 626, 627 (5th Cir. 1967); City of Fort Lauderdale v. East Coast Asphalt Corp., 329 F.2d 871, 872 (5th Cir. 1964); Shull v. 
Pilot Life Insurance Co., 313 F.2d 445, 447 (5th Cir. 1963)."
747,4," .  However, the sham exception has come up tangentially in a number of cases. See, e.g., City of Lafayette v. Louisiana Power 
& Light Co., 435 U.S. 389, 98 S. Ct. 1123, 55 L. Ed. 2d 364 (1978) (municipalities not excluded by state action exemption from 
the reach of an antitrust counterclaim which included sham allegations); Vendo Co. v. Lektro-Vend Corp., 433 U.S. 623, 635 n.6, 
97 S. Ct. 2881, 2889 n.6, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1009 (1977) (plurality opinion) (California Motor unaffected by decision on federal anti-
injunction statute); id., 433 U.S. at 644, 97 S. Ct. at 2894 (Blackmun, J., concurring in the result) (California Motor requires 
repetitive series of sham lawsuits); id., 433 U.S. 660-62, 97 S. Ct. at 2902-03 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (California Motor requires 
only single sham lawsuit); Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., 428 U.S. 579, 96 S. Ct. 3110, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1141 (1976) (Stewart, J., 
dissenting) (discussion of state action immunity from antitrust laws); Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States, 410 U.S. 366, 93 S. 
Ct. 1022, 35 L. Ed. 2d 359 (1973) (remanding for reconsideration in light of California Motor ) aff'd without opinion following 
remand 417 U.S. 901, 94 S. Ct. 2594, 41 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1974). "
748,5," .  A wholly different type of ""sham"" may arise where a litigant or party actually wants the relief sought from the court or agency 
but perpetrates the equivalent of fraud on that body. See generally P. Areeda & D. Turner, 1 Antitrust Law P 204 (1978). The 
pre-California Motor Fifth Circuit decision in Woods Exploration & Producing Co. v. Aluminum Co. of America, 438 F.2d 1286 
(5th Cir. 1971), perhaps retains vitality on this basis. However, nowhere in the counterclaim, the memoranda submitted by FPL, 
or at oral argument is there even the slightest trace that such an alleged fraud by the plaintiffs might be the basis for the 
counterclaim. Hence, this Court has not considered that type of possible sham on this motion."
748,6," .  The Supreme Court cases on point are replete with references that anticompetitive motive per se does not eliminate Noerr-
Pennington immunity. See Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 138-39, 81 S. Ct. 
523, 530, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961); United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 669, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 1593, 14 L. Ed. 2d 
626 (1965) (""Nothing could be clearer from the Court's opinion than that anticompetitive purpose did not illegalize the conduct 
there involved""); California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508, 515, 92 S. Ct. 609, 614, 30 L. Ed. 2d 642 
(1972) (""any carrier has the right of access to agencies and courts, within the limits, of course, of their prescribed procedures, in 
order to defeat applications of its competitors""). See also P. Areeda & D. Turner, 1 Antitrust Law P 202 (1978). The Fifth Circuit has recognized that an anticompetitive motive does not make a complaint a sham. I. T. T. Corp. v. United 
Telephone Co., 550 F.2d 287, 289 (5th Cir. 1977) (per curiam ). "
749,7," .  Many various factual allegations, which need not be detailed here, could provide a reasonable basis for inferring the requisite 
intent. It is reasonable to expect such allegations since, as Professors Areeda and Turner have noted, the California Motor sham 
exception is judged not by a subjective test but by an objective standard. P. Areeda & D. Turner, 1 Antitrust Law P 203b at 41 
(1978)."
749,8," .  As is clear from this decision, the Court concludes that the awarding of electricity franchises by municipalities is a discretionary 
political act and therefore efforts to influence that award which are neither a sham nor fraudulent are covered by Noerr-
Pennington. See Fla.Const., Art. VIII, § 2(b) (1968 rev.); Fla.Stat. § 166.042(1); State v. Dade County, 142 So.2d 79, 87 
(Fla.1962); see generally 11 Fla.Jur. Electricity and Gas §§ 5-7; 14 Fla.Jur. Franchises §§ 5-10; cf. P. Areeda & D. Turner, 1 
Antitrust Law P 206d3 (1978) (grant of an exclusive franchise by a governmental entity does not violate antitrust laws). "
750,9," .  In discussing whether to infer a private right of action to enforce proxy violations, the Court turned to the legislative history of 
the Securities Exchange Act and quoted from various committee reports. It then concluded: While this language makes no specific reference to a private right of action, among its chief purposes is ""the protection of 
investors,' which certainly implies the availability of judicial relief where necessary to achieve that result. . . . Private enforcement of the proxy rules provides a necessary supplement to Commission action."
750,377," U.S. at 432, 84 S. Ct. at 1559-60. Numerous litigants have seized on the ""necessary supplement"" approach in arguing for 
inference of new private rights of action. See, e.g., Touche Ross and Transamerica cases discussed infra. "
751,10," .  In determining whether a private remedy is implicit in a statute not expressly providing one, several factors are relevant. First, 
is the plaintiff ""one of the class for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted,"" . . . that is, does the statute create a federal 
right in favor of the plaintiff? Second, is there any indication of legislative intent, explicit or implicit, either to create such a remedy 
or to deny one? . . . Third, is it consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to imply such a remedy for the 
plaintiff? . . . And finally, is the cause of action one traditionally relegated to state law, in an area basically the concern of the 
States, so that it would be inappropriate to infer a cause of action based solely on federal law?"
751,422," U.S. at 78, 95 S. Ct. at 2088 (citations omitted)."
751,11," .   441 U.S. at 718-30, 99 S. Ct. at 1968-74 (White, J., dissenting) (joined by Blackmun, J.)."
751,12," .   441 U.S. at 730-49, 99 S. Ct. at 1974-85 (Powell, J., dissenting). "
752,13," .  Justice Brennan, who concurred in the majority opinion, interpreted that opinion as merely holding that when the first two Cort 
factors are not present, ""the remaining two Cort factors cannot by themselves be a basis for implying a right of action."" 442 U.S. 
580, 99 S. Ct. at 2491 (Brennan, J., concurring)."
752,14," .  To the extent our analysis in today's decision differs from that of the Court in Borak, it suffices to say that in a series of cases 
since Borak we have adhered to a stricter standard for the implication of private causes of action, and we follow that stricter 
standard today."
752,442," U.S. 578, 99 S. Ct. at 2490. "
753,15," .  Specifically, the Cities argue that FPL has refused to sell them firm wholesale power in violation of its tariff schedule. The 
Cities state that this refusal has been determined to be unlawful in several Commission proceedings. Plaintiffs' Memorandum at 
14-17 citing Florida Power & Light Co., Docket Nos. ER78-19, Opinion No. 57 (August 3, 1979); Florida Power & Light Co., 
Docket No. EL78-4, Order Terminating Proceeding (Nov. 8, 1979); Id. Staff Report (April 7, 1978). FPL vigorously contests both 
this characterization of its actions and the Cities' interpretation of the Commission's decisions. "
754,16," .  Similarly, the debate in the House centered around the holding company aspects of the legislation. Only two members of the 
House commented at length on the rate-making and regulatory aspects of Title II. See 79 Cong.Rec. 10377-79 (1935) 
(Comments of Rep. Lea); id. at 10381-89 (Comments of Rep. Cole). Interestingly enough, both Representatives Lea and Cole 
intimated that the ""just and reasonable"" language in Section 205 was solely a standard to be used by the Commission in fulfilling 
its rate-making function: This bill also involves the question as to the rate base that should apply in governing the rates for public utilities. The bill contains 
the general rule that rates must be just and reasonable. The committee would like to have been able to provide a better standard 
of valuation as a rate-making base, but after considering the question fully we determined that it would be a futile thing to do. 
After the recent decision of the Supreme Court in a Maryland telephone case it is practically a futile thing, in my judgment, for 
any legislative body to try to write a rate-making base. Id. at 10378 (Comments of Rep. Lea); accord. id. at 10384 (Rep. Cole). There was no hint that either Sections 205 or 206 would 
provide the basis for a private cause of action."
754,17," .  Sections 205 and 206 have not been amended since their enactment in 1935 except for the enlargement of the period for 
notice of rate changes from thirty to sixty days and the addition of provisions on automatic adjustment clauses. Public Utility 
Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, Pub.L. 95-617, Title II, §§ 207(a), 208, 92 Stat. 3142 (Nov. 9, 1978). Interestingly enough, other 
provisions of the 1978 Act expand the jurisdiction of the Commission with respect to the wholesale distribution of electric energy. 
See, e.g., Section 202 (Interconnection orders). If the 1978 Act affects the decision in the instant case at all, it reaffirms the 
Congressional purpose of regulating interstate electricity through the Commission and not through private litigation in federal 
courts. The present Congress is seeking ways in which to improve regulatory efficiency, e.g., Section 207(b) (requiring a study of 
rate-making procedures), rather than a means of circumventing the Commission's processes. "
755,18," .  Section 314(a) provides, in pertinent part: Whenever it shall appear to the Commission that any person is engaged or about to engage in any acts or practices which 
constitute or will constitute a violation of the provisions of this chapter, or of any rule, regulation, or order thereunder, it may in its 
discretion bring an action in the proper District Court of the United States, the United States District Court for the District of 
Columbia, or the United States courts of any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, to enjoin 
such acts or practices and to enforce compliance with this chapter or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder, and upon a 
proper showing a permanent or temporary injunction or decree or restraining order shall be granted without bond."
755,16, U.S.C. § 825m(a) (emphasis added).
755,19," .  In contrast, when Congress intended to grant jurisdiction in the federal courts, it did so explicitly. For example, Section 314(b) 
provides, in pertinent part: (b) Upon application of the Commission the district courts of the United States . . . shall have jurisdiction to issue writs of 
mandamus commanding any person to comply with the provisions of this chapter or any rule, regulation, or order of the 
Commission thereunder."
755,16," U.S.C. § 825m(b) (emphasis added). See also H.Rep. No. 1318, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. 34 (1935) (briefly discussing Section 
314(a) as ""authorizing the Commission to bring a civil action"" whereas Section 314(b) ""confers . . . jurisdiction"" and Section 317 
""imposes . . . jurisdiction""). "
756,20," .  In Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, 444 U.S. 11, 22, 100 S. Ct. 242, 248, 62 L. Ed. 2d 146 (1980), the 
Supreme Court relied in part on the deletion of the words ""actions at law"" and ""liability"" from the jurisdictional provision of the 
Investment Advisers Act of 1940 as evidence of lack of a Congressional intent to provide a private right for damages under the 
Act. It does not logically follow, however, that the inclusion of similar words in an earlier statute implies a private right of action, 
especially if the inclusion of similar words can be linked to explicit causes of action provided by the statute. See Touche Ross & 
Co. v. Redington, 442 U.S. at 577, 99 S. Ct. 2479, 2490, 61 L. Ed. 2d 82 (1979) (jurisdictional provision ""creates no cause of 
action of its own force and effect""). "
757,21," .  Neither side has argued in any depth the fourth Cort factor that the cause of action is not a traditional concern of the states. 
While utility rate-making is a traditional concern of the states, rate-making for interstate sales of power is traditionally a concern 
of the national government. Moreover, the enforcement of federal regulatory orders is a federal concern. Clearly, however, the 
mere fact that an area is of federal concern does not establish a federal cause of action beyond the administrative remedies 
available."

Irrigation Dist., 411 F. Supp. 361 (E.D.Cal.1975). In Cleveland the ""sole issue"" in the appeal was whether the electric company's 
counterclaims under the Federal Power Act were compulsory counterclaims giving the federal court jurisdiction under 
Fed.R.Civ.P. 13(a).  570 F.2d at 124. Having focused on the jurisdictional issue exclusively, the court did not discuss the issue of 
whether a private cause of action for damages existed under the act. Moreover, the F.P.C. orders upon which the electric 
company relied had been reduced to a contract between the parties, 570 F.2d at 125, and therefore there was no need for the 
appeals court to decide the private cause of action question since there was a contract action available for non-payment of 
various fees. Cleveland is of no assistance to the plaintiffs. In Oroville-Wyandotte one California state agency (DWR) sought declaratory and injunctive relief against a second state agency 
(OWID), contending that a California Public Utility Commission order requiring DWR to pay for a tunnel conflicted with a Federal 
Power Commission order that OWID construct the tunnel. The district court assumed jurisdiction of the case but decided that 
there existed no conflict and granted declaratory judgment for the defendant. The district court's memorandum indicates that 
neither party raised the private right of action issue, 411 F. Supp. at 366-67, and the court reached the ""central issue"" of the 
case, the alleged conflict between state and federal regulation, in order to ""cut through the convoluted history of this case and 
the maze of motions herein."" Thus the district court memorandum and its summary affirmance by the court of appeals, 536 F.2d 
304 (9th Cir. 1976), is of little persuasive value on the question of a private right of action. "
758,23," .  The separate 1967 Amoco-FGT agreement permitted supplies of gas by Amoco beyond those minimum daily amounts 
required by the original agreement to be ""banked"" to balance against later possible underdeliveries. See Florida Gas 
Transmission Co., FERC Case No. CP74-192, at 13 n. 26 (August 21, 1978) (Order Rejecting Settlement and Directing Office of 
Enforcement to Institute Investigation). The FERC staff argued that as a result of this banking agreement both FGT and Amoco 
violated the Natural Gas Act. Id. nn. 27 & 28. FPL has been included in the investigation ordered by the Commission, but the 
precise theory under which it could be held to have violated the Act is unclear. See Florida Gas Transmission Co., 43 Fed.Reg. 
38456 (Aug. 21, 1978). Apparently, the Cities contend that FPL conspired with Amoco or FGT or induced them to alter their 
agreement in order to protect its warranty contract at the expense of the FGT warranty contract."

760,29," .  The plaintiff cited two cases as demonstrating that the Fifth Circuit recognizes an implied private right of action under the 
Natural Gas Act. In Socony Mobil Oil Co. v. Brooklyn Union Gas Co., 299 F.2d 692 (5th Cir. 1962), aff'g Brooklyn Union Gas Co. 
v. Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp., 201 F. Supp. 673 (S.D.Tex.1960) and id.; D.C. 201 F. Supp. 679, the Fifth Circuit 
affirmed a recovery for over-payment of natural gas charges in excess of a rate determined by the Commission. Nowhere in the 
Circuit Court opinion nor in the District Court opinions is there a discussion of the private right of action issue. Primarily of 
concern in Brooklyn Union was the effect of a unique series of circumstances: On June 7, 1954 the Supreme Court held that 
sales by independent gas producers were covered by the Act and the Commission later determined that the contract rates in 
effect on June 7 were to be the lawful rates under the Act until rate changes were requested. Socony and other companies 
appealed the Commission decision and a stay of the Commission decision was granted by the Fifth Circuit. The stay was later 
dissolved and the purchasers of the natural gas sought recovery of the overcharges they had paid in the interim. Much of the 
judicial discussion turned on the effect of the Fifth Circuit stay. If the Brooklyn Union decisions are to be understood as authority "
761,," for an implied right of action, they certainly must be limited to the rather unusual facts of that case and understood as an 
instance in which the private action is ancillary to the Commission's power to order a return of unjustified rate increases under 
Section 4(e), 17 U.S.C. § 717c(e). Such is not the case here. In Tenneco Oil Co. v. FERC, 580 F.2d 722 (5th Cir. 1978) the Fifth Circuit declined to reach the merits of an appeal from a 
district court decision until the panel had the benefit of a Commission ruling on whether the disputed agreements were covered 
by the Act. The district court had dismissed a declaratory judgment action, deciding that the litigated agreements were not 
covered by the Act. The Cities argue that (1) the district court would not have reached the merits of the case if there existed no 
suitable private right of action, and (2) the court of appeals would have affirmed without waiting for a Commission decision if 
there existed no suitable private right of action. Unfortunately, the Tenneco case is too slender a reed to support the Cities' 
claimed private right of action. First, the only possible private right of action involved in that case was for declaratory relief. 
Second, the two-page Fifth Circuit order decided nothing more than that a decision on the appeal must await a Commission 
determination. Finally, the lower court memorandum does not indicate whether the private right of action issue was ever raised 
at the trial court. Even had the private right of action question been raised, a finding that there existed no private right of action 
would have been compatible with the district court's conclusions as an alternate ground for the dismissal."

764,32," .  Quite correctly, the Newark court observed that the concern in the Robinson-Patman Act was about ""price discrimination with 
respect to manufactured products and consumer goods."" However, the Newark court never explains why electricity is not a 
manufactured product or a consumer good. Clearly, it is both. Rather, the Newark court appears to have further restricted the 
term commodity to the department store or mail order house situation. This Court has already noted that the Robinson-Patman 
Act is not to be so narrowly construed. See FTC v. Sun Oil Co., 371 U.S. 505, 520, 83 S. Ct. 358, 367, 9 L. Ed. 2d 466 (1963). "
769,1," I wrote in my opinion of April 14, 1978 that the Supreme Court's ruling in the case had made compromise a reasonable 
solution for all concerned in the case. ""In view of the Supreme Court's clear holding I must approve the settlement proposed by the parties.  The opinion in Cantor has 
created, in Justice Stewart's words of dissent, ""the prospect of massive treble damage liabilities' payable ultimately by the 
customers of regulated utilities.  Neither the parties, the proposed intervenors, nor this court can quantify precisely the degree of 
risk to which Detroit Edison would expose itself should it decide to litigate this matter.  Neither the argument that the risk is 
minimal because of a belief that Detroit Edison can win the anti-trust suit nor the argument that the anti-trust laws are being 
misused by plaintiffs and their counsel can be given great weight in view of the Supreme Court's opinion.  The existence of the 
risk, because of the large potential of treble damage liability, provides sufficient justification for me to approve the proposed 
settlement. ""The settlement, by imposing prospective injunctive relief only, protects Detroit Edison, its shareholders and those members of 
the public to whom it provides service, from paying a potentially large treble damage claim either now or in the future.  It also 
allows plaintiff class members, for the first time, to compete openly and equally for the light bulb market in the Detroit Edison 
marketing area.  Furthermore, in view of the Supreme Court's opinion, the settlement spares both parties the time and expense 
of protracted litigation in this complex case."""

774,7," It appears that petitioners had this same understanding of paragraph 10 at the time the stipulation of settlement was presented 
to me.  See, October 28, 1977 Tr. 17."
774,8," ""MR. HARTE: "" . . .  if it is the approach of the Detroit Edison Company that essentially this Paragraph 10 commits it really to nothing if it is the 
position of Detroit Edison that it will not agree that the figure of 690,000 is the bottom figure, is a fair and reasonable 
compensation for plaintiffs' counsel in this case up to and including the date the settlement agreement was reached, then I feel 
the Court should be advised as to the time that counsel have expended in pursuing this question of attorney fees for the Court's 
consideration here. ""It appears that the law is clear, that this is a right that they have given up which could be argued which could be compensable. 
So, I would want to place on the record the hours of counsel with respect to prosecuting this question of attorney fees.  We have 
in the record the hours expended in defending the ethics investigation.  This is the point that I wanted to take up with the Court 
and I suppose it is in the nature of an offer of proof rather than in the nature of direct testimony. ""I do not want the Court to take the position that I do not feel that Detroit Edison is bound by Paragraph 10.  I put that in as an 
alternate form of proof, however, that if they persist in what I believe to be a withdrawal from the agreement, that the Court 
should consider this time that I am talking about now."" (Dec. 19 Tr. 357-358.) "

779,12," E. g., Nelson stated that he spent hours early in the case ""familiarizing myself with the cases at the Federal level under the 
antitrust law."" (Defendant's Exhibit 5, Nelson Deposition 35.) In contrast, Basil Mezines, an experienced antitrust attorney in 
Washington, D. C., and one of the attorneys petitioners consulted, stated that when a client comes into his office with an antitrust 
problem, ""We know what the cases are.  We know them intimately.  We are able to quote them, to cite them, and we are able to 
prepare a memorandum."" (Plaintiff's Exhibit 13, Mezines Deposition 10.) "
780,13," In denying a bonus multiplier in Northcross the Court of Appeals relied on language in Oliver, supra, at 715, where the court 
stated: ""The use of the multiplier was without statutory authority. The antitrust cases relied upon by the district court are inapposite since 
there is usually a large monetary recovery in those cases."" Petitioners seek to distinguish Northcross and Oliver on this basis.  I believe the Northcross holding should be read more broadly 
to include all attorney fee cases.  The approach utilized by the Court of Appeals the number of hours expended multiplied by a 
reasonable hourly rate is based on what the attorneys actually earned by their work.  Consistent with this approach is the court's 
denial of any bonus or multiplier which suggests a windfall to the attorneys.  Thus, the Court of Appeals' denial of a multiplier is 
followed here. "
781,14," Some items for which photocopies receipts were submitted are questionable.  For example, in Plaintiff's Exhibit 15 an 
American Express charge for which petitioners seek reimbursement is simply listed ""Leather Shop, Chicago, Illinois $ 75.18."" I 
will allow such an item even though poorly identified.  I also note that Weinstein has claimed expenses of $ 4,953.29.  I cannot 
allow undocumented expense items and hence the resolution to $ 3,347.38. "

] The Communications Act does provide explicit exemptions for telephone company consolidations and acquisitions."
787,47," U.S.C. §§ 221(a), 222(c)(1). The existence of an explicit exemption in one part of the Act does not provide authority for the 
proposition that other actions not directly covered are impliedly exempt.  Industrial Communications Systems, Inc. v. Pacific Tel. 
& Tel. Co., 505 F.2d 152, 156 (9th Cir. 1974). The existence of explicit immunities may indicate that Congress did not intend for 
courts to imply exemptions in other parts of the statute. See California v. FPC, 369 U.S. 482, 485, 82 S. Ct. 901, 904, 8 L. Ed. 2d

Inc., 599 F.2d 316, 320 (9th Cir. 1979). In order to assure the proper relationship between regulatory provisions and antitrust 
safeguards, courts must inquire if ""application of the antitrust laws would seriously undermine a comprehensive regulatory "
788,," scheme,"" even in the absence of explicit exemption. See Note, AT&T and the Antitrust Laws: A Strict Test for Implied Immunity, 
85 Yale L.J. 254, 269-70 n.76 (1975). Cf.  Pan Amer. World Airways, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 296, 320-21, 83 S. Ct. 476,

(1963). Bell contends that immunity is justified because ""scarcely a single business act is free from continuous regulation or at 
least (some) administrative governmental review."" Carter v. AT&T, 365 F.2d 486, 495 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 1008, 87 
S. Ct. 714, 17 L. Ed. 2d 546 (1967). See Western Electric Co. v. Milgo Electronic Corp., 568 F.2d 1203 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 
439 U.S. 895, 99 S. Ct. 255, 58 L. Ed. 2d 241 (1978). Neither Carter nor Western Electric considered the immunity question 
directly. Carter concerned the application of the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, whereas Western Electric involved the 
appealability of an FCC order. Indeed, courts have often rejected the argument that antitrust immunity should be implied 
because of the pervasiveness of federal and state regulation. See, e. g., Essential Communications Systems, Inc. v. AT&T, 610 
F.2d 1114 (3d Cir. 1979); MCI Communications Corp. v. AT&T, 462 F. Supp. 1072, 1080-82 (N.D.Ill.1978); United States v.

AT&T had refused interconnection with new independent telephone companies organized to serve new communities. 
Memorandum of FCC as Amicus Curiae, reprinted at 62 F.C.C. 1102, 1130. The FCC's brief stated in part that: (f)or purposes of communications policy, interconnection in that circumstance would appear to be a neutral act; if it were 
required for reasons of competition, and if there were no affirmative communications policy reasons to forbid interconnection, 
maintenance of an antitrust action would not necessarily interfere with Commission regulation."

manner similar to section 201(a) in that interconnection refusals are subject to review by a centralized commission under a

793,9," .  Indeed, WTC has not alleged a consistent pattern whereby Bell refused interconnection requests in all cases and then raised 
points of procedure for the purposes of delay before the FCC. In fact, Bell has voluntarily interconnected with other independent 
phone companies in the past. Thus, the situation is unlike California Motor where it was contended that the various conspirators 
opposed every effort by a new competitor to enter the market by initiating administrative proceedings ""without probable cause 
and regardless of the merits."" California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508, 512, 92 S. Ct. 609, 612, 30 L.

793,10," .  In this regard, Bell requested and was denied an instruction specifically setting forth the application of the Noerr-Pennington 
doctrine with respect to its opposition to WTC's complaint before the FCC. In particular Bell requested an instruction to the effect: WTC claims that Southwestern Bell acted unlawfully in opposing WTC's informal complaint before the FCC to compel 
Southwestern Bell to interconnect, and in insisting that the FCC hold a formal evidentiary hearing to decide the matter. You are 
instructed that to demand a hearing before a court or an administrative agency does not violate the Sherman Act, even if such 
demand is made as a joint and concerted action, and even if the intent or purpose of the demand is to eliminate competition, 
unless that demand is purely and simply a sham. Therefore, you are instructed that, even if you believe that Southwestern Bell 
and AT&T combined or conspired to restrain trade as I have defined in those terms to you, you may not find that Defendants 
violated the Sherman Act unless WTC specifically proves by a preponderance of the evidence that Southwestern Bell opposed 
WTC's informal complaint before the FCC and demanded a hearing without any probable cause and totally regardless of the 
merits of Southwestern Bell's or AT&T's position under the Communications Act. You are instructed that petitioning an administrative agency such as the FCC can result in certain delays because administrative 
procedures are often time consuming. Such delays are a price which businesses have to pay in our complex, highly regulated 
economy. Southwestern Bell and AT&T cannot be held responsible for the delays occasioned solely by adherence to the 
statutory provisions and procedural requirements of the FCC. Such delays cannot, as a matter of law, form a basis for the finding 
of an antitrust violation. Bell's Requested Instruction # 8 (footnotes omitted). While the district court instructed the jury on the import of Noerr-Pennington 
in general, we believe that in substance Bell's requested specific instruction was proper. "

AT&T, however, removed the section 1 conspiracy claims. Accordingly, WTC's claim against Bell was premised solely on section 
2. "
796,12," .  Refusals to deal by a monopolist have been analyzed under two somewhat different approaches. Note, Refusals to Deal by 
Vertically Integrated Monopolists, 87 Harv.L.Rev. 1720, 1732-51 (1974). The first approach focuses on the monopolist's intent in 
refusing to deal. See Eastman Kodak Co. v. Southern Photo Materials Co., 273 U.S. 359, 47 S. Ct. 400, 71 L. Ed. 684 (1927). 
See also United States v. Colgate & Co., 250 U.S. 300, 307, 39 S. Ct. 465, 468, 63 L. Ed. 992 (1919). The second approach to 
the problem of a monopolist's refusal to deal is the so-called ""bottleneck"" theory. Under this approach, a monopolist who controls 
a ""facility or resource that is essential to competitive viability in the marketplace must grant access to it on reasonable terms to 
(its) competitors."" Watson & Brunner, Monopolization by Regulated ""Monopolies"": The Search for Substantive Standards, 22 
Antitrust Bull. 559, 571 (1977). See, e. g., United States v. Terminal Railroad Association, 224 U.S. 383, 32 S. Ct. 507, 56 L. Ed. 
810 (1912) (group of railroad companies acquiring essential transportation facility and denying access to competitors); 
Associated Press v. United States, 326 U.S. 1, 14-15, 65 S. Ct. 1416, 1422, 89 L. Ed. 2013 (1945) (news agency's rules denying 
membership to competitors of existing members). While in theory there exist differences between the two approaches, in 
practice the theories are similar.  Byars v. Bluff City News Co., 609 F.2d 843, 856 (6th Cir. 1979). "
797,13," .  Analysis of the factual context in which an action allegedly in violation of the antitrust laws occurred is also important under 
the ""rule of reason"" under section 1. See, e. g., Board of Trade v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 238, 38 S. Ct. 242, 243, 62 L. Ed. 
683 (1918); Neeld v. National Hockey League, 594 F.2d 1297 (9th Cir. 1979); E. A. McQuade Tours, Inc. v. Consolidated Air 
Tour Manual Commission, 467 F.2d 178 (5th Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1109, 93 S. Ct. 912, 34 L. Ed. 2d 690 (1973). 
Both Bell and WTC have expended considerable energies debating whether the ""rule of reason"" concept applies in section 2 
cases. It is clear, however, that the analysis under section 2 is similar to that under section 1 regardless whether the rule of 
reason label is applied per se.  Byars v. Bluff City News Co., 609 F.2d 843, 860 (6th Cir. 1979)."
797,14," .  Unlike other parts of this opinion, this issue is not determined by Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States, 410 U.S. 366, 93 S. 
Ct. 1022, 35 L. Ed. 2d 359 (1973). In Otter Tail, there existed no positive justification for the monopolist's actions, and indeed, 
the company did not dispute that ""its purpose in refusing to deal with municipalities desiring to establish municipally owned 
systems is to protect itself in the position it now enjoys in the area."" United States v. Otter Tail Power Co., 331 F. Supp. 54, 61 
(D.Minn.1971). The company engaged in other predatory practices that went far beyond a mere refusal to deal including refusals 
to wheel power, use of restrictive clause in various contracts, and instigating a pattern of litigation to harass municipalities. Thus, 
Otter Tail did not present a case like the present one where the utility is arguing that its actions were justified by articulable 
public interest factors. "
798,15," .  In this regard we note the statement in plaintiff-appellee WTC's brief that ""The issue of regulation was relevant for the jury 
only insofar as it reflected Bell's intent or motive in denying the interconnection."" (WTC's brief pp. 51-52.)"
798,16," .  Even granting that the district court erred in failing to instruct on the nature of regulation, WTC contends that the omission 
was harmless error. We reject that argument. The question on appeal is not whether an instruction was faultless in every 
respect, but whether the jury, considering the instruction as a whole, was misled.  Coughlin v. Capitol Cement Co., 571 F.2d 
290, 300 (5th Cir. 1978); International Air Industries, Inc. v. American Excelsior Co., 517 F.2d 714, 728 (5th Cir. 1975), cert. 
denied, 424 U.S. 943, 96 S. Ct. 1411, 47 L. Ed. 2d 349 (1976). Thus, only in those cases where the reviewing court has a 
substantial doubt whether the jury was fairly guided in its deliberations should the judgment be disturbed.  McCullough v. Beech 
Aircraft Corp., 587 F.2d 754, 759 (5th Cir. 1979). WTC argues that the failure to instruct on the nature of regulation was 
harmless because Bell presented evidence on regulation during trial and discussed the effect of regulation during its closing 
argument. Moreover, WTC asserts that the district court's instruction that liability could not be found if the jury believed that Bell 
""refused to interconnect for legitimate telephone business reasons,"" was sufficiently broad to include consideration of regulation. 
We disagree. The failure to instruct on the impact of regulation is too central to be harmless error. Bell's presentation of evidence on regulation 
and discussion during closing argument cannot in and of itself justify the district court's failure to provide guidance on the issue 
for without specific instruction the jury has no indication how such evidence was to be used in its deliberations. To hold 
otherwise would be to abrogate the district court's duty to instruct the jury accurately. "
799,17," .  The charge was obviously ambiguous and confusing as the chambers conference colloquy between the court and counsel 
reveals. Though requested by Bell's counsel to do so, the district judge declined to delete the charge in what was a critically 
important portion of his instructions. It is even possible under the language of the charge that the jury may have believed that it 
was being told to assume the WTC monopoly. (See Tr. 3484-3488.)"
799,18," .  The transcript discloses that the expert witness chose the cutoff year of 1999 a 27-year period at the direction of plaintiff's 
counsel. Tr. 2325-2327."
799,19," .  Though plaintiff's exhibit 261 shows net profits before federal income taxes and is the predicate for the jury's $ 18 million 
verdict, plaintiff's exhibit 265 discloses by years on the bottom line Net Income (Loss) after deduction for federal income taxes. 
Obviously a net profits total after income taxes would be substantially lower than that shown in exhibit 261. Cf.  Norfolk & 
Western Ry. Co. v. Liepelt, 444 U.S. 490, 100 S. Ct. 755, 62 L. Ed. 2d 689 (1980) for the Supreme Court's most recent 
pronouncement on the propriety of considering income taxes in damage awards. "
804,1," .  The instant motion was filed by the Matsushita, Hitachi, Sanyo, Sharp, Mitsubishi Corp. and Mitsubishi International Corp. 
defendants. The Toshiba defendants later joined the motion."
804,2," .  See Opinion (Introduction to Summary Judgment Motions; Subject Matter Jurisdiction), 494 F. Supp. 1190 at 1195-1198 (April 
14, 1980), which we hereby incorporate by reference."
804,3," .  As the defendants have moved for summary judgment on grounds of indirect injury against Zenith alone, National Union 
Electric Corporation (NUE), the other plaintiff in this consolidated litigation, is not involved in the instant motion."
804,4," .  The ten principal defendants are Mitsubishi Corporation, a Japanese trading company; Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd., 
Toshiba Corporation, Hitachi, Ltd., Sharp Corporation, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation (""MELCO""), Sanyo Electric Co., Ltd., and 
Sony Corporation, all Japanese manufacturers of consumer electric products; and two American companies, Motorola, Inc. and 
Sears, Roebuck & Co. Fourteen other defendants are subsidiaries of the principal Japanese defendants. Of the twenty-four 
defendants, fifteen are defendants in both suits, seven in the Zenith action only, and two in the NUE action only."
804,5," .  In our Opinion (1916 Antidumping Act), accompanied by Pretrial Order No. 237, both filed April 14, 1980, we granted summary 
judgment for the defendants with respect to virtually all of Zenith's dumping claims under the 1916 Act, and dismissed NUE's 
dumping claims in toto. In our opinion we certified the ruling for interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b), and the 
plaintiffs have petitioned the Court of Appeals for leave to appeal the ruling. No. 80-8072 (3d Cir., petition filed Apr. 24, 1980). HN1[
] "
805,6," .  Zenith owns four of its wholesalers. The defendants concede that Illinois Brick would not bar Zenith from maintaining this 
action for any injury it might have suffered as a distributor of its own products. They point out, quite correctly, however, that 
Zenith has not sought to recover damages for injury to its business as a distributor of its own products."
805,7," .  We have described this motion as an Indirect Injury Illinois Brick motion. Because, however, of the kinship between motions of 
indirect injury and motions of standing and antitrust injury in general, see discussion at p. 1253 infra, it is important at the outset 
that we define precisely what it is that this motion asks us to decide. It is clear that this case does not present an issue of 
standing to sue under § 4. As pointed out by the Supreme Court:HN2[
] (T)he question of which persons have been injured by an illegal overcharge for purposes of § 4 is analytically distinct from the 
question of which persons have sustained injuries too remote to give them standing to sue for damages under § 4. Illinois Brick, 431 U.S. at 728, n. 7, 97 S. Ct. at 2065-2066. Illinois Brick does not purport to be a ""standing"" case as opposed to 
an ""indirect injury"" case, and the defendants do not assert lack of § 4 standing. Less clear is whether we are asked to determine whether Zenith has suffered antitrust injury as defined by Brunswick Corp. v. 
Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 97 S. Ct. 690, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977). Although Zenith, in its memorandum, went to 
great lengths to show how it was injured, and although at times during oral argument it appeared that defendants were disputing 
the existence of any such injury, the questions has not been briefed or precisely advanced in those terms, and we deem this 
antitrust injury question not to be before us. Rather, we must determine whether Zenith's injury as alleged is indirect within the 
meaning of Illinois Brick, and if Zenith is barred from recovery for that reason. "
806,8," .  The three dissenting members of the Court and the United States as amicus curiae adopted the opposite position: that the 
pass-on theory should be barred as a defense under Hanover Shoe, but that offensive use of the theory should have been 
permitted in Illinois Brick, 431 U.S. at 749, 97 S. Ct. at 2076 (Brennan, J., dissenting). The petitioner, the respondent, and the 
six-member majority of the Court agreed that whatever pass-on rule were adopted should apply equally, offensively and 
defensively.  Id. at 729, 97 S. Ct. at 2066. "
807,9," .  We note that defendants' counterclaim presents the same potential Illinois Brick questions as does Zenith's complaint, i. e., if 
defendants' indirect injury motion were to prevail, their marketing counterclaims, which are subject to the same attack as they 
have directed to plaintiffs' claims, would have to be dismissed at least to the extent that Zenith could prove that the 
counterclaimants sell to independent distributors and thus are not in direct competition with Zenith or its distributors."
807,10," .  Certain Defendants' Reply Memorandum in Support of Their Motions for Summary Judgment on the Grounds of Indirect 
Injury at 5-6. We think it somewhat disingenuous to refer to Zenith as a competitor of the Japanese defendants in a ""colloquial 
sense."" At best it ""puts the rabbit in the hat."""
807,11," .  The defendants' motion seeks dismissal of all counts of Zenith's Complaint and Counterclaim, including Zenith's claims under 
§ 2 of the Clayton Act as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 13, for price discrimination among domestic U.S. 
purchasers, and under the Antidumping Act of 1916, 15 U.S.C. § 72, for international price discrimination. In view of our 
disposition of the motion, we need not decide whether or not Illinois Brick requires the dismissal of particular counts of the 
Complaint and Counterclaim. However, we note that even if we were to agree with defendants' position that Illinois Brick 
mandates dismissal of Zenith's Sherman Act and Clayton Act § 7 claims, we might decline to extend Illinois Brick to reach 
Zenith's claims under the Robinson-Patman Act and the 1916 Antidumping Act. We note in this regard that in Julius Nasso 
Concrete Corp. v. DIC Concrete Corp., 467 F. Supp. 1016, 1020 n. 1 (S.D.N.Y.1979), Judge Robert L. Carter determined that 
Illinois Brick does not bar actions by indirect purchasers under §§ 2(a) and 2(f) of the Clayton Act as amended by the Robinson-
Patman Act. We also note that, with respect to the 1916 Act, we might well hold that Congress plainly contemplated enforcement 
of the Act by means of civil suits brought by domestic manufacturers against foreign manufacturers, regardless of the nature of 
their distribution network. While we observed in our opinion of April 14, 1970, supra n. 5, at 37, that the standing provision of the 
1916 Act tracks § 4 of the Clayton Act, defendants have conceded that the instant motion does not involve § 4 standing to sue. 
See n. 7, supra. "
808,12," .  The court also noted that a vertical conspiracy could also fall within the control exception to the Illinois Brick rule, see p. 1250, 
supra."
808,13," .  The Fifth Circuit also applied Illinois Brick to plaintiffs' claims against a trade publication and trade association which were not 
in the single chain of distribution. It did so, however, solely on the premise that the plaintiffs' claims against those defendants as 
coconspirators of the supermarket defendants asserted the same pass-on theory which the court of appeals rejected when 
asserted against the supermarket defendants themselves.  600 F.2d at 1159-60. Ultimately, the Fifth Circuit held that the 
plaintiffs' pleadings stated a cause of action within the cost-plus exception to Illinois Brick, see p. 1250, supra, 600 F.2d at 1163-
67. "
811,14," .  Although the burdens of mounting complex litigation might be eased if the Zenith distributors could maintain a class action 
under F.R.Civ.P. 23, defendants' counsel, in response to a question on this point, suggested at argument that the distributors 
could not maintain such an action."
811,15," .  To the extent that the actual probability of suit by the distributors is relevant, a point which we do not decide, it is worth noting 
that any suit filed by distributors in the future might well run afoul of the statute of limitations. "
812,16," .  While scholarly criticism of Illinois Brick and legislative attempts to overturn it do not undermine its authority as controlling 
precedent, if it were in fact controlling in this case, we note that the decision in Illinois Brick has drawn much criticism. It was 
contrary to the holdings of all but one of the courts of appeals to address the issue and contrary to the views of the vast majority 
of the commentators. See Illinois Brick, 431 U.S. at 753 n. 10, 97 S. Ct. at 2079 (Brennan, J., dissenting). The decision 
prompted an almost immediate legislative reaction, with bills to overrule it being introduced in two successive sessions of 
Congress. See Harris & Sullivan Passing on the Monopoly Overcharge, 128 U.Pa.L.Rev. 269 (1979). "
813,1," .  The Court perceives no reason to distinguish the potential liabilities of Fedders and its subsidiary, Airtemp Corporation.  The 
evidence established that Fedders was in total control of Airtemp Corporation, and thus Airtemp agents were also Fedders 
agents.  Consequently, the Court will treat Airtemp and Fedders as a single defendant, referred to jointly as Fedders. "
814,2, .  Exhibit FA1; testimony of Sam Muscanera; Exhibit 1; Exhibit 3.
814,3, .  Exhibit 1.
814,4, .  Exhibit 3. 
815,5, .  Exhibit FA1.
815,6," .  Given the fact that Airtemp Corporation was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fedders with interlocking directorates, the Court 
finds that Bierman acted as an agent for Fedders.  The written contract (Exhibit FA1) specifically provided that Fedders 
controlled Airtemp Corporation, including its officers and employees."
815,7," .  There is evidence that Chrysler offered reemployment after the complaint in this case was filed, but that evidence would be 
relevant only in regard to the issue of damages, which this Court will not address."
815,8," .  Deposition of William Bolin 31-32.  The Court also finds that Bolin was an agent for Fedders.  See note 6, supra. "
817,9," .  The terms ""group boycott"" and ""concerted refusal to deal"" will be used interchangeably.  See Bauer, Per Se Illegality of 
Concerted Refusals to Deal: A Rule Ripe for Reexamination, 79 Colum.L.Rev. 685 (1979). "
818,10," .  The Court recognizes that the defendants' legitimate motive would not save an otherwise unlawful agreement, see 
Associated Press v. United States, 326 U.S. 1, 16, n.15, 65 S. Ct. 1416, 1423, 89 L. Ed. 2013 (1945), but the defendants' motive 
is certainly relevant in determining whether the alleged restraint was indeed unlawful.  See Neeld, supra, 594 F.2d at 1298-1300."
818,11," .  Professor Bauer's conclusion is that courts should apply a per se rule to group boycotts ""only when two conditions are met: 
first, the conduct must be intended to coerce or exclude other entrepreneurs; second, the conduct must be likely to have anti-
competitive effects."" Bauer, supra, at 705.  Under Professor Bauer's test, which appears to be the same as the Ninth Circuit's 
test as enunciated in Neeld v. National Hockey League, 594 F.2d 1297 (9th Cir. 1978), the Court would reach the same 
conclusion, i. e., that the per se rule should not be applied to this case. "
819,12, .  Deposition of Matthew Bolin 20-21; Deposition of William Blakeslee 12.
819,13," .  The purpose would have been anti-competitive had the agreement been entered into for the purpose of relieving Fedders of 
the necessity for ""outbidding"" Chrysler for the services of its former employees, for example.  There are no facts to support a 
finding of any such anti-competitive purpose, however."
819,14," .  Although the agreement may best be characterized as a covenant not to compete, that does not preclude the agreement 
from also being treated as a group boycott. See St. Paul Fire & Marine Insurance Co. v. Barry, 438 U.S. 531, 544 n.16, 98 S. Ct. 
2923, 57 L. Ed. 2d 932 (1978)."
819,15," .  This claim's lack of merit is further demonstrated by the plaintiffs' failure to address it in their trial brief.  Moreover, there is no 
reference to a civil conspiracy theory in the pretrial order, and therefore the Court concludes that the issue of Chrysler's liability 
under Count II was not before the Court at trial.  See F.R.Civ.P. 16. "
820,16," .  The defendants failed to consider the choice-of-law issues in their brief, apparently assuming that Tennessee law was to be 
applied."
820,17," .  See also Industrial Equipment Co. v. Emerson Electric Co., 554 F.2d 276 (6th Cir. 1977); Davis H. Elliot Co. v. Caribbean 
Utilities Co., 513 F.2d 1176 (6th Cir. 1975); Thermo Thrift Industries, Inc. v. Mono-Therm Insulation Systems, 450 F. Supp. 398 "
821,," (W.D.Ky.1978); Walt Peabody Advertising Service v. Pecora, 393 F. Supp. 328 (W.D.Ky.1975). All of these cases were decided 
prior to Carmichael and Henkin, and therefore the Court has not relied upon them to any significant extent. "
822,18," .  For the purposes of establishing their prima facie case, the plaintiffs need not show that Chrysler would in fact have rehired 
them.  The Court is satisfied that Chrysler was precluded from hiring them, and that showing is sufficient for a prima facie case 
of prospective interference."
822,19, .  These were the respective states of residence of the plaintiffs at the time of filing. 
823,20," .  For the purposes of convenience and uniformity, the place of a plaintiff's residence should be determined as of the time of the 
filing of the complaint.  This is not inconsistent with the Court's analysis, because a plaintiff's residence at the time of filing is 
presumably the place where he first experiences his injury.  The Court does not fear the possibility of forum shopping by using 
this approach, because this is simply not the sort of tort claim that lends itself to forum shopping."
823,21," .  Cf.  Henkin v. Berea Bank & Trust Co., 566 S.W.2d at 425, in which the Court of Appeals appears to have narrowed the 
scope of the tort."
823,22," .  It may be observed that the Court's reasoning in regard to the plaintiffs' claim of prospective interference is virtually identical 
to that used in dealing with the first theory of recovery, i. e., that the defendants interfered with existing relationships.  The 
existing relationships in this case were contracts terminable at will, the interest in which is primarily an interest in future relations, 
and thus closely analogous to the interest in prospective contractual relations.  See Second Restatement § 766, Comment g.  
The Court has considered the claims independently, however, because of their essentially different bases.  The first theory is 
based on the fact that the plaintiffs were terminated from Chrysler; the second claim is based on the additional, independent 
agreement that Chrysler would not rehire the plaintiffs in the future.  Because the claims derive from analytically distinct sources, 
the Court has dealt with them discretely, although the considerations are much the same."
823,23," .  The Court recognizes that section 768 deals with the privilege of competition, a privilege that is clearly not applicable in the 
instant case.  However, Comment e's explication of what the Restatement refers to as ""wrongful means"" of interference is still 
persuasive. "
824,24," .  Unlike, Kentucky, Tennessee does have a substantial case law on interference with existing contractual relations.  See 
Edwards v. Travelers Insurance, 563 F.2d 105, 119-122 (6th Cir. 1977); Koehler v. Cummings, 380 F. Supp. 1294, 1305-06 
(M.D.Tenn.1974); Dynamic Motel Management, Inc. v. Erwin, 528 S.W.2d 819 (Tenn.App.1975); Mefford v. City of Dupontonia, 
49 Tenn.App. 349, 354 S.W.2d 823 (1961). In fact, Tennessee has a statute that codifies the common law tort and provides for 
treble damages.  T.C.A. § 47-15-113 (1979).  These authorities do not provide any significant guidance in dealing with 
interferences to prospective advantage, however. "
835,*," Of the Eastern District of New York, sitting by designation."
835,1," Texaco claims that Yentsch was not terminated, since he voluntarily signed a ""mutual cancellation"" agreement.  By signing the 
agreement, Yentsch received a promise from Texaco that it would buy back his inventory and settle all accounts within 60 days. 
Since the record makes it clear that Texaco intended to end its relationship with Yentsch whether he consented or not, he had 
nothing to lose and a little to gain by making the ""termination"" mutual. "
836,2," In addition to the dispute over prices, hours of operation, promotional programs, and volume of gasoline sold, the appearance 
of the station became an issue.  Texaco claims that Yentsch failed, for example, to keep the men's room clean and the toilet in "
837,," running order.  Yentsch responds that he had continuous problems with the plumbing and repeatedly asked Texaco to make the 
repairs, as it was required as landlord to do."

837,15," U.S.C. § 1. We need not enter the debate over whether maximum resale price maintenance should be treated differently from minimum 
resale price maintenance, since both are presently considered illegal per se.  Albrecht v. Herald Co., supra, 390 U.S. at 152-53,

838,4," Justice Harlan, in dissent, thought that the majority opinion had in effect overruled Colgate without so stating, 362 U.S. at 49, 
80 S. Ct. at 514 (Harlan, J., dissenting), although he later largely retracted this critical view, Albrecht v. Herald Co., supra 390 
U.S. at 163 n. 7, 88 S. Ct. at 879 n. 7, (Harlan, J., dissenting)."
838,5," Justice Harlan posited that ""there is no ""combination' when a manufacturer simply states a resale price and announces that he 
will not deal with those who depart from it; there is a combination when the manufacturer goes one inch further."" Albrecht v. 
Herald Co. supra, 390 U.S. at 163, 88 S. Ct. at 879 (Harlan, J., dissenting). One commentator has suggested that the very facts 
in the original Colgate opinion would no longer be protected under the modern version of the Colgate doctrine.  Maslow, Colgate 
Updated : Resale Price Maintenance and Antitrust Liability, 48 N.Y.St.B.J. 626, 638 (1978). Others have counseled companies 
about the risks inherent in relying on a Colgate pricing program.  L. Sullivan, Handbook of the Law of Antitrust § 139, at 395

839,6," A review of cases from other circuits leads one to conclude that the character of the instant interaction between Yentsch, 
Texaco, and its other Connecticut dealers is, or in the petroleum products business was, by no means unique.  See, e.g., Arnott 
v. American Oil Co., 609 F.2d 873 (8th Cir. 1979), petition for cert. filed, 446 U.S. 873, 100 S. Ct. 1852, 64 L. Ed. 2d 272, 48 
U.S.L.W. 3664 (1980); Umphres v. Shell Oil Co., 512 F.2d 420 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 929, 96 S. Ct. 278, 46 L. Ed. 2d 
257 (1975); Lehrman v. Gulf Oil Corp., 464 F.2d 26 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1077, 93 S. Ct. 687, 34 L. Ed. 2d 665

839,7," One might argue that forcing dealers to pass out trading stamps is a form of illegal price-fixing, since the stamps operate as a 
de facto price discount for customers.  Since the evidence on the chief price-fixing claim is sufficient, however, we need not 
consider this issue."
839,8," We do note in passing that, in the original posture of this case, eight other former Texaco dealers along with Yentsch filed suit.  
The district court granted Texaco's motion for severance of each of the named plaintiffs. "
840,9," There was some evidence that dealers were told that they were expected to follow tank wagon pricing (wholesaler dealer 
pricing) as part of the TVA program.  But is was insufficient to show that availability of the TVA was expressly conditioned upon a 
dealer's corresponding price reduction, or that the allowance would be withdrawn without such compliance.  Compare Hanson v. 
Shell Oil Co., 541 F.2d 1352, 1356 (9th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1074, 97 S. Ct. 813, 50 L. Ed. 2d 792 (1977) (because 
TVA was initiated by dealers, i. e., ""not initiated by Shell to force dealers to fix prices,"" it was not illegal price-fixing), with 
Lehrman v. Gulf Oil Corp., 464 F.2d 26, 32-33, 41 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1077, 93 S. Ct. 687, 34 L. Ed. 2d 665 (1972) 
(withdrawal of TVA because dealer refused to lower price is improper)."
840,10," Texaco asserts that ""plaintiff acknowledges that he did not comply with Texaco's alleged pricing demands"" and ""(t)hat 
admission establishes that there was no conspiracy between plaintiff and Texaco."" Reply Brief of Appellant at 3.  We find no 
such admission by Yentsch in his brief or in the record.  There is some conflict in Yentsch's testimony about how often and when 
he lowered his prices.  At one point, he seemed to indicate that the only time he dropped prices other than the first few months 
of 1970 was in May 1970.  However, he also twice testified at trial and once in a deposition that he decreased prices in 1971 at 
Hammer's request. Although appellee commented that Hammer ""convinced me to participate in the pricing"" (emphasis added), it 
seems clear that such convincing included threats of finding a replacement dealer if compliance was not forthcoming.  Thus, his 
testimony indicated that he did at least three times lower his price in compliance with Texaco's pricing policy, once unwittingly 
(when he thought his allowance would be three cents and he would not have to contribute), once voluntarily (when he knew he 
would have to contribute), and once in response to Hammer."
840,11," Texaco argues that Quinn v. Mobil Oil Co., 375 F.2d 273 (1st Cir.), cert. dismissed, 389 U.S. 801, 88 S. Ct. 8, 19 L. Ed. 2d 56 
(1967), supports its conduct as permissible.  In Quinn, Mobil threatened to increase its rent in an upcoming renewal of a station 
operator's lease, unless he reduced prices, but the dealer refused. Several months later, Mobil threatened lease termination, 
delayed payments needed by the dealer as well as gasoline shipments, attempted to unload a consignment of tires, batteries, 
and accessories in lieu of payments owed, and otherwise harassed the dealer. The supplier eventually terminated the dealer for 
failure to reduce his prices. Judge McEntee's opinion said: The allegation that defendant pressured plaintiff to reduce his retail price at best amounts to a unilateral attempt to coerce 
plaintiff into making such an agreement.  Therefore the immediate question is whether this is actionable under section 1 of the 
Sherman Act. I think not.  If Congress intended to make attempts actionable under this section undoubtedly it would have done 
so expressly as it did in the very next section of the Act (15 U.S.C. § 2) dealing with monopolies. Id. at 275. The court viewed the dealer's failure to agree to reduce his prices as dispositive, presaging the Supreme Court's 
statement in Albrecht v. Herald Co., supra, 390 U.S. at 150 n. 6, 88 S. Ct. at 872 (suggesting a combination was formed 
between the newspaper company and the independent carrier ""at least as of the day he unwillingly complied with (the 
newspaper company's) advertised price"").  Here, Yentsch did lower his price, not counting the unintentional reduction, thereby "
841,," signalling agreement. Furthermore, in Quinn, there was no evidence of any Mobil policy or action toward other dealers, whereas 
the evidence in the instant case portrayed-although vaguely-a general Texaco policy directed at its Connecticut dealers. The Quinn case promotes an interesting dichotomy between attempted and successful coercion. Judge Coffin, specially 
concurring, discussed the apparent anomaly of rewarding the plaintiff who agrees to fix prices while denying reward to one who 
""steadfastly resist(s) pressure to enter such an agreement."" 375 F.2d at 278. Justice Harlan echoed this sentiment: ""Obviously it 
makes no sense to deny recovery to a pressured retailer who resists temptation to the last and grant it to one who momentarily 
yields but is restored to virtue by the vision of treble damages."" Albrecht v. Herald Co., supra, 390 U.S. at 162, 88 S. Ct. at 878 
(Harlan J., dissenting).  Judge Aldrich, dissenting in Quinn, would not draw any distinction between successful and unsuccessful 
coercion. 375 F.2d at 281 (Aldrich, J., dissenting).  Justice Harlan's dissent in Albrecht puts a damper on reading the majority's 
""at least as of the day"" (emphasis added) language as suggesting the possibility that an attempt might be sufficient.  Therefore, 
while we see arguments pro and con for differentiating attempts from actual compliance, we believe existing law demands such 
a distinction."
841,12," There was evidence in the record that, over a three-year period, 75% of Texaco's service stations changed hands.  The direct 
proof did not indicate whether the turnover rate was fueled by threats of termination or actual terminations. However, we 
presume that hard news or rumors of terminations, resulting from noncompliance with Texaco's pricing policy, would in and of 
itself have a coercive effect on dealers' pricing independence."
841,13," The amended complaint was filed on February 10, 1976 by the original nine Texaco service stations dealers, including 
Yentsch."
841,14," Judge Murphy also thought he had submitted a breach of contract claim to the jury upon which it may have based its decision.  
Although he initially granted Yentsch's motion for treble damages, he subsequently vacated the trebling order, apparently on the 
rationale that one could not be sure whether the jury had decided the case on antitrust or non-antitrust grounds. "
842,15," Appellant urges us to adopt a sixth test for determining an illegal tying, namely whether the seller of the tying product has a 
direct economic interest in the market for the tied product.  We see considerable logic for using such a criterion, and other 
circuits have already applied it, see Keener v. Sizzler Family Steak Houses, 597 F.2d 453, 456 (5th Cir. 1979); Ohio-Sealy 
Mattress Manufacturing Co. v. Sealy, Inc., 585 F.2d 821, 835 (7th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 930, 99 S. Ct. 1267, 59 L. 
Ed. 2d 486 (1979); Venzie Corp. v. United States Mineral Products Co., 521 F.2d 1309, 1317-18 (3d Cir. 1975); Crawford 
Transport Co. v. Chrysler Corp., 338 F.2d 934, 938-39 (6th Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 380 U.S. 954, 85 S. Ct. 1088, 13 L. Ed. 2d "
843,971," (1965). Nevertheless, we do not decide today whether to incorporate this element into our tying analysis, since appellee's 
claim fails on another ground. "
844,16," One commentator has criticized Fortner II, on the ground that a company's own efficiency and enterprise resulting in a cost 
advantage over other competitors should not be adequate to prove sufficient economic power.  See Jones, The Two Faces of 
Fortner: Comment on a Recent Antitrust Opinion, 78 Colum.L.Rev. 39, 45 (1978)."
844,17," The district court's charge to the jury on what constitutes an illegal tying arrangement was inadequate.  The judge charged as 
follows: So, turning to the other three tie-ins involving glassware, Coca-Cola and Green Stamps, to prevail on any one of these claims, 
Plaintiff must prove each of the following elements by a preponderance of the evidence.  One, that there are two separate and 
distinct products involved, a tying product and a tied product. Two, Texaco has sufficient economic power in the tie-in market to 
coerce purchase of the tied product.  Three, Texaco, in fact, coerced Plaintiff to purchase the tied product.  Four, that here were 
anticompetitive effects on the tied market.  And five, a not insubstantial amount of interstate commerce in the tied market was 
involved. No further explanation of these five elements was proffered. While the bare bones of the charge was correct, it did little else to 
direct the jury toward proper consideration of the facts.  How, for example, would a jury understand that ""sufficient economic 
power"" does not equal mere bigness, or that it requires some advantage not shared by other competitors? Our own analysis of 
the tying problem in this very opinion indicates the level of care necessary for understanding.  A charge to the jury, especially in 
as complex an area as antitrust law, should avoid sacrificing clarity for brevity."
844,18," Both United New York and Morrissey deal with claims improperly submitted to the jury.  Although Texaco bases this appeal 
on the district court's failure to grant a judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a new trial, it could just as well have appealed 
the court's denial of its two motions for directed verdict, apparently made both after plaintiff's and defendant's case.  For "
845,," purposes of this appeal, the directed verdict and JNOV considerations are functionally equivalent.  See Epoch Producing Corp. 
v. Killiam Shows, Inc., 522 F.2d 737, 742-43 (2d Cir. 1975). The contract and tying claims never should have reached the jury.  
Once they did, however, and a general verdict was returned, the judge erred further by failing to grant a JNOV."
845,19," Should appellee prevail on retrial, we must caution the judge to exercise greater supervision on the determination of 
damages. Although damages may be ascertained from a jury's just and reasonable inference from proof of the wrongful act, its 
tendency to injure plaintiff's business, and evidence of decline in profits, Bigelow v. RKO Radio Pictures, Inc., 327 U.S. 251, 264, 
66 S. Ct. 574, 579, 90 L. Ed. 652 (1946), there must nevertheless be a reasonable foundation from which a jury can calculate 
the amount of damages.  See Coleman Motor Co. v. Chrysler Corp., 525 F.2d 1338, 1352-53 (3d Cir. 1975). When the evidence 
presented precludes such rational consideration, it must be excluded.  Herman Schwabe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 
297 F.2d 906, 912-13 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 369 U.S. 865, 82 S. Ct. 1031, 8 L. Ed. 2d 85 (1962). Appellee's expert Victor Cino, a New Jersey Shell station dealer, calculated future lost profits by using the actual gasoline sales 
volume figures from Yentsch's station, operated by a new dealer, for 1972 through 1975, and then by using the 1975 figure, 
1,134,000 gallons, as a surrogate for years 1976 though 1981.  Yet, Cino knew before he testified the actual station figures from 
1976 through part of 1979, figures which showed a substantial drop from 1975.  (801,300 gallons in 1976; 724,800 in 1977; 
639,500 in 1978; 562,320 in 1979, as projected from the first five months).  We can see no reason to use 1975 as a model year 
instead of actual figures other than to inflate future profits and increase the damage award. Cino admitted as much-when asked 
whether using the actual figures would have been ""a more honest way to calculate Mr. Yentsch's alleged losses,"" he responded, 
""I don't know if-it would be more intelligent.  That might have been more honest . . . ."" Certainly that portion of the testimony 
dealing with the later years should have been excluded from jury consideration. "

851,1," If a court finds that there has been an agreement between a union and a ""non-labor group"", the agreement may still be entitled 
to antitrust immunity under the ""non-statutory"" exemption. Connell Construction Co. v. Plumbers Local 100, 421 U.S. 616, 622, 
95 S. Ct. 1830, 1835, 44 L. Ed. 2d 418 (1975). Since both the ""statutory"" and ""non-statutory"" exemptions are based on judicial 
readings of the Sherman, Clayton and Norris-LaGuardia Acts, this choice of terminology seems unfortunate.  See I Areeda & 
Turner, Antitrust (1978) § 229 at 192."
851,2," An exception is an employer in job competition with his employees, e. g., a bandleader who sometimes both leads a band and 
plays an instrument.  American Federation of Musicians v. Carroll, 391 U.S. 99, 88 S. Ct. 1562, 20 L. Ed. 2d 460 (1967). "
855,*," Honorable Howard T. Markey, Chief Judge, United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, sitting by designation. "
860,1," It is not necessary to question the sincerity of the city's officials, acting in the belief that they were better able than Boulder's 
cable consumers to determine which cable operator was the ""best"" for Boulder's citizens.  The refusal to permit individual 
consumers to decide among competitors in open competition has here spawned delay in service to new consumers, arrests, 
equipment tear-down, two law suits, an appeal, continuing litigation, and the concomitant expense to all local and federal 
taxpayers.  That harm may be caused by the sincere who would do good is but a price to be paid, lest no good be ever done.  In 
this particular case, however, the circumstances tend to confirm the wisdom animating the Sherman Act, its national policy 
insistence on open, free competition, and its prohibition against unnecessary interference therewith. "
861,2," Affirmance on First Amendment grounds avoids the constitutionality-risking interpretation of the Colorado constitution's ""home 
rule"" provisions found necessary by the majority to support absolute immunity of Colorado cities from the Sherman Act. Further, 
affirmance on First Amendment grounds avoids the concern expressed by Mr. Justice Blackmun in City of Lafayette for the 
effect on municipalities and their citizens of the Sherman Act's treble damage provisions. The Colorado Attorney General's brief for Amicus State of Colorado, concentrating on Sherman Act considerations, ""assumed 
arguendo that the first amendment may limit, but does not wholly prohibit"" Boulder's authority."
861,3," Cable TV is a First Amendment speaker.  See Midwest Video Corp. v. FCC, 571 F.2d 1025 (8th Cir. 1978) (aff'd on other 
grounds sub nom.  FCC v. Midwest Video, 440 U.S. 689, 99 S. Ct. 1435, 59 L. Ed. 2d 692 (1979); Home Box Office, Inc. v. FCC,

Television Transmission, Inc. v. Public Utilities Commission, 47 Cal.2d 82, 301 P.2d 862, 865 (1956)."
861,4," Concerning the First Amendment, the trial judge said: Obviously there are wider concerns, including interstate commerce, giving rise to some uncertainty about the power of the state 
government in this regard, both in terms of an obstruction to interstate commerce, and with respect to the First Amendment 
rights of communicators. There are two other aspects of this case which are deserving of preliminary observations at this time.  The plaintiff has 
attempted to use the shield of the First Amendment to avoid any interference from City government.  That is an obvious 
overstatement of the law and an attempt to escape the reality that the messages it chooses to transmit must pass through a 
medium which is subject to some control by the City. While the defendant Boulder readily concedes that the First Amendment would prohibit its control of the content of these 
transmissions, it does assert both the right and the responsibility for restricting the use of the public ways in this communications 
system.  The question, of course, is what are the limits of that authority?  If controlling content of the programs is beyond those 
limits, is it different, either in degree or in kind, for the City government to prescribe the number, variety, and scope of "
862,," programming and services to be offered?  And, is it appropriate for the City administration to say that the acceptability of a cable 
company rests on its willingness to contribute free services to that government or to such institutions or groups as may be 
considered to be in need of benefit or reward?  Stated bluntly, may the City exact tribute for its favor? While these questions are not now ripe for decision, they are potential problems in this developing situation.  It is inappropriate to 
ascribe any illegal or improper intent to action which has not yet been taken, but it may be helpful to give caution about the 
potential consequences of that which may be contemplated. The City should carefully consider the need to exercise its authority 
by narrowly drawn regulations which do not unnecessarily interfere with First Amendment freedoms, as the Supreme Court has 
cautioned in Village of Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 441 U.S. 922, 99 S. Ct. 2029, 60 L. Ed. 2d 395."
862,5," The trial court referred to ""interested persons who are not before the court."""
862,6," Nor is CCC likely, under the city's plan, ever to speak again outside its present area.  The city, after receiving the majority 
opinion, signaled its intent to impose a second moratorium. In its briefs here it repeated, ad nauseam, that its 90-day moratorium 
was merely ""a one-time, temporary"" delay in CCC's expansion.  The city refused, however, to assure Judge Matsch that it would 
not impose second and continuing moratoriums if he denied the injunction. The city appealed the injunction interlocutorily, and 
moved to expedite, even though the moratorium expired the day after the injunction issued.  Moreover, a failure to impose 
continuous moratoriums might, as the city elsewhere argues, allow CCC to ""wire the entire city"" and thus defeat the city's plan to 
grant either one monopoly for the entire city, or a number of monopolies, each in a specified district.  Hence, the city must either 
abandon its present plan or it must continue to impose moratoriums on CCC's right to speak outside its present area."
862,7," The city says it considered, and may still consider, ""districting,"" i. e., parceling out areas of the city to different cable operators.  
The effect on the First Amendment, however, is the same, for the city would be restraining each operator from speaking outside 
his assigned area, and would be dictating each consumer's choice, limiting it to the one cable operator chosen by the city to 
speak to that consumer."
862,8," The trial court said: Under the present technology, more than one cable company can be on the same poles without adversely affecting the public 
ways. While there certainly are finite limits to overbuilding, those limits are something beyond two companies. "
863,," and again: I disagree that the evidence shows that cable television is such a natural monopoly that the only feasible competition is in the 
process of currying favor with the City Council to obtain a permit to operate.  To the contrary, the evidence is that there can be 
competition in the marketplace, with the choice of price and service left to the consumers."
863,9," The city and Colorado's Attorney General cite the refusal of BCC and 2 other potential cable operators to compete unless they 
are granted a monopoly over all or part of the city as ""evidence"" that ""economics"" preclude open competition.  That the 
operations of multiple competitors may result in one getting more customers than another, however, is an inherent element of, 
not an economic barrier, to competition.  United States v. Alcoa, 148 F.2d 416, 430 (2d Cir. 1945)."
863,10," The city correctly says it cannot be forced to grant a license to ""every operator that applies,"" but that is not to say that the city 
can unilaterally stifle the voice growth of an operator already licensed, for the sole purpose of enabling the city to choose a 
favorite monopolist or series of neighboring monopolists.  Nor, assuming financial integrity and willingness to comply with police 
power regulations relating to use of the city's rights of way on the part of applicants, no reason is seen or cited why licenses 
should not be granted to those applicants. "
864,11," The city's brief repeats, in reference to the First Amendment, that its moratorium was to prevent CCC's monopolization and 
""to foster competition in"" the marketplace.  But the city could have done all that with ease by merely granting additional non-
exclusive licenses. As established in the record, found by the trial judge, and not denied by the majority, the moratorium, and its 
continuation, is critical to the city's effort to prevent competition and to insure monopolization, albeit by the monopolist it 
considers ""best."""
864,12," The record on this interlocutory appeal reflects no intent by city officials beyond a desire to grant monopoly licenses to one or 
more ""best"" monopolists.  An absolute freedom to stifle unilaterally the growth of a licensed communicator, because city officials 
disliked its programming or its editorial position in an upcoming election, for example, could certainly chill the exercise of that 
communicator's First Amendment rights.  Like the power to tax, a unilateral, arbitrary power to stunt can also be the power to 
destroy."
864,13," Colorado's constitution speaks of city autonomy in ""local and municipal matters."" The trial court and the majority here refer to 
""local concern."" CATV is not merely a local matter, United States v. Southwestern Cable Co., 392 U.S. at 168-169, 88 S. Ct. at 
2000-01, but if it were, that fact would be irrelevant to First Amendment implications.  It is difficult to imagine a more local 
enterprise than a newspaper composed, edited, printed, and distributed within any of the thousands of communities like Boulder 
in the United States.  Moreover, a Colorado city's authority in relation to non-communication type activities must be carefully 
circumscribed when it is applied to restrict First Amendment rights. "
865,14," That the trial court may have founded its judgment primarily on reasons deemed erroneous by the majority on appeal is not 
controlling.  It is a judgment we review, not reasons."
865,15," The city has not yet been found guilty of violating the antitrust laws. We deal only with whether a city like Boulder may be 
enjoined from unilaterally restricting, limiting, or revoking plaintiff's lawful, contractual rights to operate its business. Though in 
my view the city's actions did violate the Sherman Act, and will probably be shown at trial to have done so, the majority opinion 
rests on immunity from suit, the violation being presumed. The brief of the Attorney General of Colorado argues persuasively 
against immunity, but is mistaken on the facts and therefore unpersuasive in arguing that there was no violation. "
866,16," Post Lafayette jurisprudence has been in accord.  See e. g., United States v. Texas Board of Public Accountancy, 464 F. 
Supp. 400 (W.D.Tex.1978), aff'd per curiam, 592 F.2d 919 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 925, 100 S. Ct. 262, 62 L. Ed. 2d 
180 (1979) (no immunity, prohibiting accountants from competitive bidding was neither directed by nor within contemplation of 
state Accountancy Act, authorizing rules for maintaining high standards for accountants); Mason City Center Associates v. City 
of Mason City, 468 F. Supp. 737 (N.D.Iowa 1979) (no immunity, anticompetitive agreement in exercise of city's zoning power 
was not within direction or contemplation of state statute conferring zoning powers and authorizing zoning mechanisms); 
Pinehurst Airlines, Inc. v. Resort Air Services, Inc., 476 F. Supp. 543 (M.D.N.C.1979) (no immunity, county board's statutory 
authority over airport did not authorize its prevention of airline becoming fixed base operator); Whitworth v. Perkins, 559 F.2d 
378 (5th Cir. 1977), vacated and remanded sub nom.  City of Impact v. Whitworth, 435 U.S. 992, 98 S. Ct. 1642, 56 L. Ed. 2d 
81 (1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 911, 99 S. Ct. 1224, 59 L. Ed. 2d 460 (1979) (no immunity, city zoning ordinance allegedly part 
of conspiracy in restraint of trade); Kurek v. Pleasure Driveway & Park District, 557 F.2d 580 (7th Cir. 1977), vacated and 
remanded, 435 U.S. 992, 98 S. Ct. 1642, 56 L. Ed. 2d 81 (1978), reinstated on remand, 583 F.2d 378 (7th Cir. 1978), cert. 
denied, 439 U.S. 1090, 99 S. Ct. 873, 59 L. Ed. 2d 57 (1979) (no immunity, park district's statutory authority over golf courses 
did not exempt price fixing not within direction or authorization of the governing statute. "
867,17," The Colorado constitution, as broadly and literally interpreted by the majority, would appear to render Boulder immune from 
the Sherman Act, and any other Act of Congress, at least insofar as the matter were viewable as one of ""local concern,"" even if 
the state's policy was to encourage competition, and if state legislation prescribed adherence to the particular Act of Congress 
under review. "
868,18," There were actually three actions: (1) Ordinance 4473, the 90-day moratorium and its enforcement; (2) Ordinance 4472, 
making plaintiff's continued service an acceptance; and (3) creation and offering the proposed model ordinance, giving the city 
total control-by-contract of the cable TV business in Boulder, as well as the right to eventual ownership of that business.  The 
city was specifically and repeatedly advised by its attorneys that only by use of its contracting power might it escape a charge of 
antitrust violation."
868,19," The nature of the activity under review is important.  Rates applicable to all similarly situated were set by the city in Manor 
Vail.  In the present case, some citizens were permitted service by CCC, while others were denied that service, and the city's 
actions were specifically designed and intended to insure a monopoly."
868,20," The majority's citation of TV Pix, Inc. v. Taylor, 396 U.S. 556, 90 S. Ct. 749, 24 L. Ed. 2d 746, as involving a situation 
comparable with this case appears strained.  In TV Pix, the Supreme Court, by order and without comment, affirmed a judgment 
in which the district court, 304 F. Supp. 459 (D.C.Nev.), stated that cable TV was in interstate commerce but that its limited 
equipment regulation as a utility by the State did not unconstitutionally interfere with that commerce.  That regulation was vastly 
different from the market control-by-contract attempted by the city here.  Again, the federal antitrust law is nowhere mentioned 
in TV Pix. "
869,21," The majority recognizes that the first moratorium terminated long ago, yet appears to focus solely on that action.  Though I 
view that action alone as impermissible on First Amendment grounds (and note its intended and inevitable repetition by the city 
following issuance of the majority opinion), I submit that it cannot be viewed in a vacuum. "
872,*," The Honorable Robert L. Carter, United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation. "
873,1," To become a franchised dealer, a retailer must be recommended by the local Yamaha sales representative to the Regional 
Manager and by the Regional Manager to Yamaha's Audio Products Division headquarters in California.  The prospective dealer 
must then be accepted by the management of the Audio Products Division and by Yamaha's Credit Department.  Although an 
applicant can be rejected at any level of this multi-tiered screening process, final acceptance can come only from top 
management in California."
873,2," Although the record is not very clear on this point, it appears that the lines acquired by Borger's since October 1976 include at 
least Luxman, Dahlquist, Advent, Mitsubishi, Dayton-Wright, Optonica, and Matsushita. "
874,3, The four interrogatories read:
874,1, . Do you find that defendant entered into a combination or contract as defined in the instructions of the Court?
874,2," . If your answer to Question 1 is Yes, do you find that such combination or contract unreasonably restrained trade, as defined in 
the instructions of the Court? "
875,3," . If your answer to Questions 1 and 2 are Yes, do you find that the combination or contract caused injury to the business of 
plaintiffs?"
875,4," . If your answer to Questions 1-3 are Yes, what amount of damages do you find? "
877,4," Although there are numerous judicial statements to the effect that agreements may violate section 1 if unreasonable restraint 
was either their object or effect, see, e.g., Times-Picayune Publishing Co. v. United States, 345 U.S. 594, 614, 73 S. Ct. 872, 
883, 97 L. Ed. 1277 (1953); United States v. Columbia Steel Co., 334 U.S. 495, 522, 68 S. Ct. 1107, 1121, 92 L. Ed. 1533 
(1948), it is difficult to conceive of a viable private action for damages under section 1 if some unreasonable restraint has not 
been effected.  The Fifth Circuit has clearly held that in the absence of an anti-competitive effect, an unlawful or evil intent will 
not suffice to establish a rule of reason violation.  See H & B Equipment Co., Inc. v. International Harvester Co., 577 F.2d 239, 
246 (5th Cir. 1978); Northwest Power Products, Inc. v. Omark Industries, Inc., 576 F.2d 83, 90 (5th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 439 
U.S. 1116, 99 S. Ct. 1021, 59 L. Ed. 2d 75 (1979). See also Bormans, Inc. v. Great Scott Supermarkets, Inc., 433 F. Supp. 343, 
348-49 (E.D. Mich.1975). "
879,5," Moreover, if the sale of other products similar to Yamaha's could be used as a gauge for what Yamaha sales would have 
been, allowance had to be made for the diversion of sales efforts from Yamaha to the other products and the increased profits 
resulting from that diversion. "
883,1," .  Prior to its amendment in 1978, see Footnote 6 infra, DR2-102 provided: ""(A) A lawyer or law firm shall not use professional cards, professional announcement cards, office signs, letterheads, telephone 
directory listings, or similar professional notices or devices, except that the following may be used if they are in dignified form: ""(6) A listing in a reputable law list or legal directory giving brief biographical and other informative data.  A law list or directory is 
not reputable if its management or contents are likely to be misleading or injurious to the public or to the profession.  A law list is 
conclusively established to be reputable if it is certified by the American Bar Association as being in compliance with its rules 
and standards.  . . ."""
883,2," .  Defendant ABA, while not a party to the summary judgment motion, has filed ""comments"" to the Magistrate's memorandum 
and recommendation."
883,3," .  Court records reveal that this memorandum was filed March 29, 1978.  However, as a result of an inadvertent oversight, it was 
not docketed or served on the parties until August 8, 1979.  The parties were given ten days from the date of service to file 
written objections pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b). "
884,4," .  Martindale's rating system provides for three classifications of legal ability: ""a"" (very high), ""b"" (high), and ""c"" (fair).  According 
to Martindale-Hubbell, no rating of legal ability is published unless the recommendations received also support the ""v"" portion of 
the rating, i. e., ""av"", ""bv"" or ""cv"".  The ""v"" is an abbreviation for ""very high"" general recommendation. Ratings are based on 
confidential recommendations furnished Martindale by lawyers and judges in the city or area where the rated attorney practices."
884,5," .  Martindale-Hubbell undertakes to list all attorneys practicing in the United States or Canada in the geographical section of the 
Directory. The entry for each attorney includes his or her name, date of birth, college and law school attended, date of admission 
to the bar, office address, and in many instances the rating of the attorney.  Beginning with the 1978 edition, it is no longer 
necessary to have a rating in order to enter a subscription for ""professional representation"" in the geographical section.  As 
additional information, attorneys may now list in the geographical section their cable address, telephone and telex number, 
names of partners and associates, fields of law in which the lawyer or firm concentrates, specialties of practice, and the names 
of not more than ten clients or references. The biographical section, on the other hand, includes such information as an attorney's legal publications, membership in legal 
fraternities, societies and associations, awards, type of practice and a listing of representative clients."
884,6," .  This section of the Code of Professional Responsibility was amended by the North Carolina Supreme Court on February 24, 
1978.  The amended DR2-102 states in Section (A)(5): ""(A) A lawyer or law firm shall not use or participate in the use of professional cards, professional announcement cards . . .  law 
lists, legal directory listings . . .  except that the following may be used if they are in dignified form: ""(5) A listing in a reputable law list, legal directory, or a directory published by a state, county or local bar association, giving brief 
biographical and other informative data.  A law list or any directory is not reputable if its management or contents are likely to be 
misleading or injurious to the public or to the profession.  . . .  N.C.G.S. Volume 4A, Appendix VII, DR2-102(A)(5) (1979 
Cum.Supp.). "
885,7," .  ABA ended this practice of certification on February 10, 1978.  See Affidavit of Robert I. deSherbinin at 5-6."
885,8," .  In 1974, a written contract was executed between the ABA and Martindale which provided that Martindale would pay to the 
ABA fifty cents per member for the Association's list. "
886,9," .  The court is well aware that HN5[
] a finding of benefit to a co-defendant is unnecessary to establish liability.  Duplan Corporation v. Deering Milliken, Inc., 594 F.2d 979 (4th Cir. 1979). Nevertheless, the presence or absence of a perceived benefit 
to a defendant in an antitrust action for restraint of trade is a viable factor to consider in making the initial determination of 
whether or not an actionable conspiracy exists.  See Albrecht, 390 U.S. 145, 88 S. Ct. 869, 19 L. Ed. 2d 998 (1968); Harold 
Friedman, Inc. v. Kroger Company, 581 F.2d 1068 (3d Cir. 1978). "
887,10," .  The parties have exhaustively argued Lorain Journal v. United States, 342 U.S. 143, 72 S. Ct. 181, 96 L. Ed. 162 (1951), on 
the issue of Martindale's claimed unilateral refusal to deal.  Lorain did not abrogate the Colgate doctrine, however, and the court 
finds Lorain factually distinguishable from the instant action."
887,11," .  Hester has not alleged and the court detects no evidence that Martindale-Hubbell has acted to prevent other law lists and 
legal directories from establishing an identical rating system and publication format. "
888,12," .  HN10[
] N.C.G.S. § 75-1 (1975 Repl. Vol.) provides in relevant part: ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce in the State of North Carolina is hereby declared to be illegal."""
888,13," .  HN11[
] N.C.G.S. § 75-1.1 (1979 Cum.Supp.) provides in relevant part: ""(a) Unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, are declared unlawful."" "
892,*, Judge Tuttle did not participate in either the consideration or determination of this case.
892,1," Suit was also brought against two companies involved in the operation of broadcasting in nearby communities but who were 
not co-owners of the cable company. "
893,2," Besides the stations owned by defendants Midessa and Doubleday, CCC carried the third VHF station operating in the 
Midland-Odessa area. That station was not involved in the CCC joint venture."
893,3," The allegations are set forth in Midland's Third Amended Complaint filed August 9, 1976 (R. 647). Midland moved for leave to 
file a Fourth Amended Complaint. After hearing oral argument, the district court did not rule on the motion prior to entering its 
order dismissing the action."
893,4," Midland also claimed that the formation of CCC by Midland's competitors constituted a violation of section 7 of the Clayton Act, 
15 U.S.C. § 18. The district court did not rule on the applicability of section 7 to the facts alleged in this suit, and accordingly this 
issue is not presented on appeal. Midland's Fourth Amended Complaint raised claims based on section 2 of the Sherman Act, 
15 U.S.C. § 2. Since the district court did not rule whether Midland could file its amended complaint, the section 2 claim is also 
not raised on appeal."
893,5," A district court's acceptance of the findings of fact and conclusions of law prepared by the prevailing party to a suit, while not 
prohibited, should be discouraged since it leaves the reviewing court with doubt concerning the actual basis of the trial judge's 
decision. See Amstar Corp. v. Domino's Pizza, Inc., 615 F.2d 252, 257-258 (1980)."
893,6," Three other issues raised by the district court's decision do not require extended discussion. First, appellees argue that CCC's refusal to carry Midland's signal is protected by the Noerr-Pennington doctrine because CCC 
would have had to obtain FCC approval in order to carry the signal. See Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor 
Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961); United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 
1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965). The basis of the doctrine is the ""need to protect efforts directed to government officials for the 
purpose of seeking redress."" Mid-Texas Communications Systems, Inc. v. AT&T, 615 F.2d 1372, 1382 (5th Cir. 1980). Here, 
appellees do not claim that they did anything designed to influence the FCC directly, but rather that they are entitled to Noerr-
Pennington protection for failing or refusing to bring an administrative proceeding. As such, there was no effort to influence "
894,," governmental action within the meaning of the doctrine. Cf.  Mid-Texas Communications, 615 F.2d at 1384. Appellees also 
argue that the district court's decision should be affirmed because there was no issue of material fact. In similar circumstances, 
the Supreme Court has stated that ""summary procedures should be used sparingly in complex antitrust litigation where motive 
and intent play leading roles, the proof is largely in the hands of the alleged conspirators, and hostile witnesses thicken the plot . 
. . Trial by affidavit is no substitute for trial by jury which so long has been the hallmark of 'even handed justice.'"" Poller v. CBS, 
368 U.S. 464, 473, 82 S. Ct. 486, 491, 7 L. Ed. 2d 458 (1962). See Norfolk Monument Co. v. Woodlawn Memorial Gardens, Inc., 
394 U.S. 700, 89 S. Ct. 1391, 22 L. Ed. 2d 658 (1969); Dailey v. Quality School Plan, Inc., 380 F.2d 484, 486 (5th Cir. 1967). 
Here, contrary to the district court's resolution, it is clear that there exist several issues of material fact. Foremost is the motive 
and intent of the appellees in refusing Midland's requests to have its signal carried. The fact that Midland does not have any 
direct evidence of improper motive is not determinative as the Supreme Court made clear in Poller. Appellees' asserted defense 
that Midland's signal was too weak to be carried, while it may present an adequate defense at trial, cf.  E. A. McQuade Tours, 
Inc. v. Consolidated Air Tour Manual Committee, 467 F.2d 178 (5th Cir. 1972), must be proven first and the quality of Midland's 
signal is disputed. Accordingly, summary judgment was not warranted since issues of material fact existed which should be 
resolved by a jury. Finally, appellees contend that Midland cannot collect any damages for the period from March 16, 1971 to March 26, 1973 since 
Midland was not then broadcasting a signal. But if appellees' alleged illegal conduct was the proximate cause of Midland's 
inability to broadcast, appellant is entitled to recover lost profits even though it was not broadcasting. See Terrell v. Household 
Goods Carriers' Bureau, 494 F.2d 16, 23-24 (5th Cir. 1974). See generally Note, Private Treble Damage Antitrust Suits: 
Measure of Damages for Destruction of All or Part of a Business, 80 Harv.L.Rev. 1566 (1967). The question whether appellees' 
actions were responsible for Midland's failure to broadcast, and if so, what damages, if any, were sustained, are issues of fact to 
be resolved by the jury. "
895,7," The Communications Act provides explicit exemptions from the antitrust laws only for telephone company consolidations and 
acquisitions.  47 U.S.C. §§ 221(a), 222(c)(1). The existence of an explicit exemption covering certain acts is evidence that 
Congress did not intend to grant immunity to other acts not covered by the explicit exemptions. See, e. g., California v. FPC, 369 
U.S. 482, 485, 82 S. Ct. 901, 904, 8 L. Ed. 2d 54 (1962); Cain v. Air Cargo, Inc., 599 F.2d 316, 320 (9th Cir. 1979). "
896,8," The rules promulgated by the FCC for smaller television markets are as follows: § 76.59 Provisions for smaller television markets. A cable television system operating in a community located in whole or in part within a smaller television market, as defined 
in § 76.5, shall carry television broadcast signals only in accordance with the following provisions: (a) Any such cable television system may carry or, on request of the relevant station licensee or permittee, shall carry the 
signals of: (1) Television broadcast stations within whose specified zone the community of the system is located, in whole or in part; (2) Noncommercial educational television broadcast stations within whose Grade B contours the community of the system 
is located, in whole or in part; (3) Commercial television broadcast stations licensed to communities in other smaller television markets within whose 
Grade B contours the community of the system is located, in whole or in part; "
897,," (4) Television broadcast stations licensed to other communities which are generally considered to be part of the same 
smaller television market (Example: Burlington, Vermont-Plattsburgh, New York television market); (5) Television translator stations, with 100 watts or higher power, licensed to the community of the system; (6) Commercial television broadcast stations that are significantly viewed in the community of the system. See § 76.54."
897,36," F.C.C.2d at 230-31. Under these rules, CCC may have been required to carry Midland's signal. Resolution of this point 
depends on certain factual questions which are best resolved on remand."
897,9," Appellees seek to distinguish RCA on the ground that in that case the Supreme Court was considering antitrust immunity within 
the confines of the FCC's regulatory authority under Title III of the Communications Act concerning regulation of broadcasting 
whereas FCC authority over cable televisions arises from Title I of the Act. This argument is incorrect. First, the Supreme Court 
decisions in United States v. Southwestern Cable Co., 392 U.S. 157, 88 S. Ct. 1994, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1001 (1968), and FCC v. 
Midwest Video Corp., 440 U.S. 689, 99 S. Ct. 1435, 59 L. Ed. 2d 692 (1979), hold that while the FCC general authority over 
cable broadcasting arises from Title I, its specific authority is exercised in conjunction with its authority over broadcasting under 
Title III. As such, the RCA decision is directly relevant. Moreover, appellees have failed to demonstrate the significance of a 
holding that FCC authority arises under Title I. Cases concerning Title II and the FCC's regulation over common carriers have 
also refused to find antitrust immunities. See, e. g., Mid-Texas Communications Systems, Inc. v. AT&T, 615 F.2d 1372 (5th Cir. 
1980); MCI Communications Corp. v. AT&T, 462 F. Supp. 1072, 1078-1084 (N.D.Ill.1978). Accordingly, since the issue is not 
relevant to our ultimate determination, we need not resolve whether the question of antitrust immunity must be considered within 
the confines of Title I or Title III. "
898,10," The FCC description of the procedure indicates the pro forma nature of the certificate requirement: Absent special situations or showings, requests consistent with our rules will receive prompt certification. The rules will operate 
on a ""go, no-go"" basis--i. e., the carriage rules reflect our determination of what is, at this time, in the public interest with respect 
to cable carriage of local and distant signals. We will, of course, consider objections to signal carriage applications and have 
retained special relief rules, but those seeking signal carriage restrictions on otherwise permitted signals have a substantial 
burden. Before restrictions are imposed in such cases, there will have to be a clear showing that the proposed service is not 
consistent with the orderly integration of cable television service into the national communications structure and that the results 
would be inimical to the public interest. We have during the course of this proceeding fully considered the question of impact on 
local television service and we do not expect to re-evaluate that general question in individual cases. And, for the same reason, 
we have no intention of re-evaluating on request of cable systems in individual proceedings the general questions settled in our 
carriage and exclusivity rules. Rather, we strongly believe that cable systems must generally operate under these rules and that, 
only after meaningful experience, will we be in position for a general reassessment."
898,2, F.C.C.2d at 186-87. 
913,1," This reading of the statute is supported by its legislative history.  Senator Jack Davies, author of the statute, stated to the 
Senate Judiciary Committee that this section ""forces more responsible litigation by imposing costs including attorneys' fees on a 
party or his lawyer who presses an issue not in good faith -- so people have to search through their lawsuits more effectively for 
what really ought to be litigated."" "
915,1," .  The litigation is described generally in our opinion addressed to the subject matter jurisdiction motion; that opinion also 
catalogues the numerous summary judgment motions.  See 494 F. Supp. 1161 (E.D.Pa.1980). The present motion is interposed on behalf of the following defendants: Sanyo Electric Co., Ltd., Sanyo Electric Trading Co., 
Ltd., Sanyo Electric Inc.; Toshiba Corp., Toshiba America, Inc.; Hitachi, Ltd., Hitachi Kaden Hanbai Kabushiki Kaisha, Hitachi 
Sales Corp. of America; Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd., Matsushita Electric Corp. of America; Mitsubishi Corp., 
Mitsubishi International Corp., Sony Corp., Sony Corp. of America; Sharp Corp., and Sharp Electronics Corp."
915,2," .  Together with various members of his family, Mr. Feldmann owned at the time of his death approximately forty-two percent of 
the outstanding NUE common stock."
915,3," .  Ninety-two percent of NUE's shares were acquired as a result of the tender offer and the eight percent balance as the result of 
the merger. In December, 1975, Electrolux contributed all the stock of NUE to another wholly-owned Electrolux subsidiary, 
Dometic, Inc. The parties have treated Electrolux as the sole owner of the NUE stock, and, at least for purposes of the 
conclusions herein, we do not regard the transfer of shares to Dometic as relevant."
915,4," .  For purposes of this motion only, the conduct complained of is admitted, and we treat NUE's allegations of antitrust violations 
as true throughout this opinion. "
916,5," .  NUE sought successfully to uphold the appraiser's conclusion that the $ 28 per share paid the stockholders in the freeze-out 
merger was fair. "
918,6," .  Dean Pound's discussion also presumes that the cause of action was not in the contemplation of the parties at the time the 
shares were transferred.  Id. at 1030.  This assumption, while a valid one in both Home Fire and Bangor Punta, is simply not 
applicable here. See discussion infra at 1004-1005. "
919,7," .  It should be noted, however, that at least part of the impetus for the holding in Home Fire was that the present shareholders 
acquired a large portion (but not all) of their stock by virtue of the very acts of mismanagement they sought to attack, i. e., their 
vendor had wrongfully used funds of the company to buy the shares he later sold to plaintiffs at fair market value.  There is no 
evidence that Bangor Punta similarly misappropriated corporate funds to purchase the shares it later sold to Amoskeag, so the 
facts of Bangor Punta are somewhat less compelling, and in that sense the opinion can be read as enunciating a doctrine more 
broadly applicable than that announced in Home Fire."
919,8," .  Less than one percent of BAR's stock was held by persons other than Amoskeag.  To the extent that the dissenters' view is 
premised on the existence of those minority shareholders, who owned stock at the time of the alleged wrongdoing, it does not 
support the position plaintiff here espouses, since this lawsuit, like Home Fire, is brought by a corporation whose ownership has 
completely changed hands since the time of the acts at issue."
919,9," .  Notable among the post Bangor Punta cases are In re REA Express, Inc., 412 F. Supp. 1239 (E.D.Pa.1976); REA Express, 
Inc. v. Travelers Insurance Co., 406 F. Supp. 1389 (D.D.C.1976), aff'd in part and modified in part, 180 U.S. App. D.C. 341, 554 "
920,," F.2d 1200 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 858, 98 S. Ct. 182, 54 L. Ed. 2d 131 (1977); and Rock River Savings & Loan Ass'n 
v. American States Insurance Co., 594 F.2d 633 (7th Cir. 1979), all of which included among the defendants third parties who 
were not former shareholders. Though by virtue of this fact, they provide some support for the defendants' position here, 
because the factual patterns on which they are based are so closely allied with that of Bangor Punta, they provide little guidance 
for such a case as is before us. In In re REA Express, Inc., supra, the principal defendants were a number of railroads who were also former owners of almost all 
the REA stock and who had allegedly conspired in violation of §§ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1 and 2, to (1) avoid 
competition among themselves and other railroads by setting rates to be charged REA for rail transportation and by dictating 
contract terms that were disadvantageous to it; (2) impose onerous charges and conditions on REA's use of defendants' 
properties and facilities; and (3) prevent REA from engaging in activities competitive with those engaged in by defendants.  
Those defendants who were not former owners had but a miniscule role in the litigation; they were signatories of the uniform 
contracts that formed the basis of the antitrust violations alleged.  In granting summary judgment for defendants on Bangor 
Punta grounds, we characterized the action as one involving a ""parent-subsidiary relationship where the ""damage' suffered by 
the subsidiary is essentially only a matter of internal accounting,"" 412 F. Supp. at 1254, and we noted that, like the defendants in 
Bangor Punta, the defendants in REA had inflicted damage only upon themselves.  Id. at 1252. The question whether the non-
owner defendants could have been treated differently than the owner defendants did not arise and was not discussed. REA Express, Inc. v. Travelers Insurance Co., supra, was another case brought by REA against its former owners and others, 
including Traveler's Insurance Co.  Traveler's role as a defendant in the suit was premised on the fact that it wrote health and life 
insurance policies that covered both railroad and REA employees.  REA's required participation at the same rate as was paid by 
the railroads was alleged to constitute illegal price-fixing, waste, and mismanagement. The court described the factual posture of 
the case as ""almost identical"" to that in Bangor Punta, 406 F. Supp. at 1392, and summarized its holding as follows: ""In short, 
REA has not shown any injury which accrued to anyone but the railroad defendants.  To allow REA, the holding corporation, or 
REA's creditors, to recover for wrongs inflicted by the defendants on themselves, would clearly be unjust enrichment …"" Id. at 
1396. Once again, the unjust enrichment conclusion is couched in terms of self-inflicted injury; the non-owner defendants, 
against whom the action was also dismissed, acted in concert with the owner defendants as they inflicted damage upon 
themselves.  Because the court supplies no separate analysis in discussing the non-owner defendants (the entire discussion is 
relegated to a one-sentence footnote, id. n.6), it is impossible to draw any broad rule of law from the dismissal of the action as to 
them. While perhaps the strongest authority for defendants' position can be found in Rock River Savings & Loan Ass'n v. American 
States Insurance Co., supra, a close reading of that case reveals that it too provides little in the way of precedent for the case at 
bar.  In Rock River the plaintiff savings and loan association alleged that it had suffered a loss due to the fraudulent conduct of 
five of its former officers and that this loss was compensable under a surety bond issued by the defendant, American States 
Insurance Co. American States joined as third-party defendants the five former officers and the association's accountants; the 
latter's liability was premised on their alleged failure to discover the fraudulent transactions.  Following settlement of the primary 
action, the district court dismissed the third party action, reasoning that since after the fraud was made public the entire stock of 
the association had been sold, any recovery by the association from the former owners or the accountants would be of the sort 
held impermissible in Bangor Punta.  Since the subrogee has no greater rights than the subrogor, American States had no 
standing to maintain the action.  The court of appeals affirmed.  It rejected American States' contention that Bangor Punta did 
not apply because it was seeking recovery from a third party who was neither guilty of wrongdoing nor acquiesced in it.  The 
court determined that Bangor Punta need not be confined to actions against former owners but rather that its equitable 
considerations come into play if (1) plaintiff is a shareholder who acquired its shares from a wrongdoer and (2) the claim for relief 
seeks damages for those same acts of mismanagement. ""It is the combination of these two factors that ""would permit (the new 
shareholder) to reap a profit for wrongs done to others.' Viewed from this perspective, then, it is clearly a matter of no 
consequence that the appellant is seeking to recover such a ""windfall' from the accountants…."" 594 F.2d at 635. Thus, the thrust 
of the holding is once again the tainted shares/self inflicted injury analysis we have seen in the REA cases and in Bangor Punta 
itself, and the incidental presence of a party acting in concert makes no difference in the result.  The focus is on the nature of the 
plaintiff, who has acquired his shares from the wrongdoer at a fair price. "
921,10," .  Of course, Electrolux has incurred obligations here too, since its wholly owned subsidiary, NUE, continues to finance the 
lawsuit."
921,11," .  Prior to the adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which abolished the procedural distinctions between law and 
equity (Rule 2), a suit for treble damages, which was deemed an action at law, could not have been brought by a shareholder, 
since a derivative suit is an equitable device. "
922,12," .  The question whether the contemporaneous ownership requirement is one of procedure or of substantive law has generally 
arisen in the context of diversity cases.  If the rule is one of procedure only, then it would bar a diversity action where the plaintiff 
did not own shares at the time of the alleged injury.  If, however, the rule has a substantive basis, then under Erie Railroad Co. v. 
Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S. Ct. 817, 82 L. Ed. 1188 (1938), it could not validly be applied to defeat an action where the forum 
state does not require contemporaneous ownership. In the context of the present case, it would appear that if the rule is merely 
one of procedure, it does not rise to the level of an equitable principle that would support disregard of the corporate veil, even 
though it would bar suit by the shareholders."
922,13," .  To the extent that the contemporaneous shareholder rule is aimed at preventing a broader kind of speculation in litigation 
than the strike suit, it might legitimately be used to pierce the corporate veil where a stranger to a corporation, aware of 
intracorporate mismanagement or fraud, wholly acquires the distressed company in the hope of extracting damages from the 
wrongdoers, be they the former owners (as in Bangor Punta ) or directors and officers or others who held no shares.  In this 
sense, Bangor Punta need not be read narrowly and might similarly have application where a stranger to a corporation, aware of 
possible antitrust activity directed at that corporation, wholly acquires its shares at a price reflecting the antitrust damage and 
then seeks to institute an action in the name of the corporation to recover for that damage, thus speculating in a corporate cause 
of action that had lain dormant prior to the transfer of shares.  We do not believe, however, that if the contemporaneous 
shareholder rule does indeed reflect a desire to prevent this sort of speculation, it should be extended to cases such as the one 
before us, where the litigation was ongoing at the time of sale.  See infra at 1003-1005. "
923,14," .  In both Bangor Punta and Home Fire, the defendants disgorged the gain they made at the expense of the corporation when 
they sold their shares at a distressed price. "
924,15," .  Defendants seem to be saying that there is something special about lawsuits that puts them into the ""windfall"" category and 
makes it inequitable for the purchasers of stock to retain the benefits thereof, even derivatively.  We fail to see the distinction 
between a lawsuit and other assets, except to the extent that a lawsuit may not be valued with the precision of certain other 
corporate property.  To illustrate our point, consider the following example: Suppose that among the corporate assets of BAR 
was a fifty cent lottery ticket purchased with corporate funds on the occasion of its president's birthday.  Assume further that 
when Bangor Punta sold its interest in BAR to Amoskeag, Amoskeag paid no ""extra"" consideration for the lottery ticket, which 
remained, as it had for many months, in the Executive Vice-President's ""In"" box.  When the lottery ticket is drawn as a million 
dollar winner, does the corporation get to keep the proceeds, even though its new shareholders are unexpectedly enriched by 
the new influx of capital into their corporation?  Of course it does.  Is this ""windfall"" somehow unjust?  We think not.  In sum, we 
believe there would be no windfall more or less, than with a preexisting lawsuit. What all this illustrates is how useless and 
misleading it is to talk of ""windfalls"" in contrast to the kinds of equitable considerations which actually informed the Home Fire, 
Bangor Punta, and REA decisions."
924,16," .  Defendants have cited Jannes v. Microwave Communications, Inc., 385 F. Supp. 759 (N.D.Ill.1974), to support their 
contention that Bangor Punta prohibits this action even though it was commenced before the transfer of shares.  We do not find 
Jannes helpful on this point because of the peculiarity of its facts.  In Jannes, which was a derivative action on behalf of a 
corporation, MCI, suit was instituted against another corporation, MI-COM and certain former directors of MCI for violation of the 
securities laws and acts of waste and mismanagement. While the lawsuit was pending, MI-COM, the principal defendant, 
became the major shareholder of MCI; thus any recovery would principally benefit the defendant.  As the court observed, ""the 
interests of equity would certainly demand that the wrongdoer should not profit from his own wrong."" Id. at 760. Thus MI-COM 
and MCI were prohibited from sharing in any recovery, though the action was permitted to proceed for the benefit of the minority "
925,," shareholders. We find little guidance in Jannes for the present situation, where the action was brought by the corporation and its 
new shareholder is not a wrongdoer."
925,17," .  The Tender Offer provides that ""shareholders who tender their shares will, of course, not receive directly or indirectly any 
portion of any such recovery"" in the NUE lawsuit. The Notice of Merger provides that ""if National Union is successful in this 
litigation it could recover substantial monetary damages …. as recited elsewhere herein minority shareholders receive $ 28 per 
share in payment of their shares in the merger, subject to appraisal rights as discussed herein, and there is no provision in the 
merger for receipt by them directly or indirectly of any portion of any such recovery."" "
926,18," .  In Perma Life itself the Court refused to permit an equitable defense, in that case in pari delicto, to bar a treble damage 
action."
926,19," .  It has been suggested that the majority's rejection of the deterrence argument may be interpreted as a refusal to extend the 
deterrence rationale of private actions to cases in which the only injury is a fictional one to the corporate entity.  Since the 
wrongdoer had disgorged its unlawful gain upon sale of its shares, insulating it from a lawsuit would neither encourage nor 
countenance similar acts of mismanagement. The deterrence is provided by the sale itself.  The Supreme Court, 1974 Term, 88

928,22," .  The negotiations for the acquisition of NUE by Electrolux proceeded in three phases.  Electrolux's initial offer was to purchase 
a controlling interest in NUE for $ 30 per share. That offer was rejected because the Feldmann family could not be assured that 
all of their NUE stock would be purchased unless the buyer agreed to take all the outstanding shares.  The second phase of 
negotiations involved a proposed joint purchase of all NUE stock by Electrolux and Scovill Manufacturing Corporation at $ 30 per 
share. That proposal was abandoned when it became clear that the Federal Trade Commission would oppose it.  The final 
phase of negotiations, and the one with which we are here concerned, commenced with Electrolux's offer to buy all the 
outstanding shares of NUE at $ 24 per share and concluded with the finally accepted bid of $ 28 per share."
928,23," .  Rule 56(e) provides in relevant part: When a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon the 
mere allegations or denials of his pleading, but his response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth 
specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.  If he does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall 
be entered against him. "
929,24," .  The ""holes"" in the balance sheet consisted of approximately $ 10,000,000 carried as proceeds from the sale of air 
conditioners, which were in fact sold on consignment and therefore subject to return, and an approximately $ 3,000,000 
overvaluation of National Presto Stock, which was carried at purchase price but which was trading for significantly less. "

Business at Columbia University.  He has provided expert testimony in several major cases involving the valuation of securities."
930,26," .  The appraiser was guided by the process defined in Tri-Continental Corp. v. Battye, 31 Del. Ch. 523, 74 A.2d 71, 72 
(Del.Sup.1950): In determining what figure represents this true or intrinsic value, the appraiser and the courts must take into consideration all 
factors and elements which reasonably might enter into the fixing of value.  Thus, market value, asset value, dividends, earning 
prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts which were known or which could be ascertained as of the date of the 
merger and which throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation are not only pertinent to an inquiry as to the 
value of the dissenting stockholders' interest, but must be considered by the agency fixing the value. "
931,27," .  Both the appraiser and Chancellor Marvel relied on the wisdom of the Third Circuit in In re Universal Lubricating Systems, 
150 F.2d 832, 835 (3d Cir.), cert. denied sub nom.  Stockholders' Committee v. Staley, 326 U.S. 744, 66 S. Ct. 58, 90 L. Ed. 
444, reh. denied, 326 U.S. 808, 66 S. Ct. 138, 90 L. Ed. 493 (1945): We have not, of course, the faintest notion of the strength of the debtor's case nor the defendant's defense in the forthcoming 
litigation.  The suit has not yet been tried and is still in the preliminary stage.  Lawsuits, even those in which a plaintiff endeavors 
to prove liability up to the hilt, are uncertain things both as to the time which they take and what the end product to the litigant will 
be."
931,28," .  In this regard it is also important to set forth NUE's argument that the finding of the appraiser was based upon a failure of 
plaintiffs' proof, an argument that finds support in the appraiser's report, which notes at 15 that the plaintiff's only evidence as to 
value of the lawsuit was counsel's statement that there was a ""substantial likelihood of … recovery,"" coupled with NUE's claim 
for damages of $ 360 million, plus $ 13.4 million representing the loss from NUE's discontinued television operations.  The 
appraiser observed that while minority shareholders deserve the benefit of the doubt on valuation questions, ""one cannot indulge 
in gratuitous presumptions lacking any competent evidence of value to support them."" Id.  Viewed from this perspective, the 
conclusion of the appraiser about the asset value of the lawsuit is somewhat less compelling than it otherwise might be.  
Presumably, had plaintiff offered expert testimony, the findings might well have been different.  Given the posture of the "
932,," Delaware litigation, it would be unfair to saddle NUE with the failure of certain of its former shareholders to come forward with 
competent evidence.  See n. 28 infra."
932,29," .  We add that while mutuality of estoppel is no longer required, at least "" ""where the prior judgment (is being) invoked 
defensively in a second action against a plaintiff bringing suit on an issue he litigated and lost as plaintiff in a prior action.' "" 
Cramer v. General Telephone and Electronics Corp., 582 F.2d 259, 267 (3d Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 1129, 99 S. Ct. 
1048, 59 L. Ed. 2d 90 (1979), it does not automatically follow i. e., without a careful examination of the circumstances, that 
collateral estoppel can be asserted offensively against a plaintiff who was a successful defendant in the proceeding sought to be 
invoked, although in view of our determination that the issue was not decided, we need not consider the ramifications of the 
doctrine of collateral estoppel in these circumstances."
932,30," .  It is worthy of note that in Scarano the court specifically declined to decide whether the broader formulation of judicial 
estoppel set forth in II Freeman on Judgments § 631 (5th ed. 1925) was correct: ""A party to a litigation will not be permitted to 
assume inconsistent or mutually contradictory positions with respect to the same matter in the same or a successive series of 
suits."" Thus, even if we were to decide that NUE's position in the Delaware proceeding is inconsistent with its position here, it is 
by no means clear that in this circuit the doctrine of judicial estoppel would permit a stranger to the Delaware proceeding to 
invoke that inconsistency against NUE.  See 1B Moore's Federal Practice P 0.405(8). "

agreed facts, similar UPC systems are presently in operation at approximately 15 retail food stores in the Commonwealth and

940,5, The parties agreed that the UPC system became commercially available in 1973. 
941,6," Federal cases preceding National Petroleum had accorded force-of-law status to other agency regulations. See, e.g., Mourning 
v. Family Publications Servs., Inc., 411 U.S. 356 (1973) (Federal Reserve Board, under 15 U.S.C. §§ 1601 et seq. [Truth-in-

Morgan Stanley & Co. v. SEC, 126 F.2d 325 (2d Cir. 1942) (SEC, under 15 U.S.C. §§ 79a et seq.)."
941,7," The rule at issue in National Petroleum involved disclosure, like the present case: it prohibited failure to post octane rating 
numbers on gasoline pumps at service stations.  See National Petroleum Refiners Ass'n v. FTC, 482 F.2d 672, 674 (D.C. Cir. 
1973), cert. denied, 415 U.S. 951 (1974)."
941,8," We are aware that the Federal Trade Commission Improvements Act of 1980, Pub. L. No. 96-252, was signed into law by 
President Carter on May 28, 1980.  The 1980 Act significantly alters FTC rulemaking procedures and limits the power of the FTC "
942,," to make rules in certain substantive areas.  For the text of the 1980 Act, see 126 Cong. Rec. No. 69, at H3149-H3156 (May 1, 
1980).  Without engaging in a detailed analysis of the changes, we make two observations.  First, we have held herein that G. L. 
c. 93A does not incorporate the procedural requirements of the FTC Act. Second, we have examined the substantive changes in 
the 1980 Act, and find none which applies to the rule in question in the present case."
942,9," Chapter 93A began as a petition in the House for ""legislation to protect consumers against unfair trade practices."" 1967 House 
Doc. No. 4957.  The House Ways and Means Committee reported it to the House on July 11, 1967.  1967 House Doc. No. 5025.  
J. House of Rep. 2268 (1967).  The House passed House Bill No. 5025 on July 26, 1967.  J. House of Rep. 2401 (1967).  
Neither 1967 House Doc. No. 4957, nor House Bill No. 5025, as passed by the House, contained § 2 (c) allowing the Attorney 
General to promulgate rules and regulations. The Senate referred House Bill No. 5025 to the Senate Ways and Means Committee, which recommended to the full Senate on 
September 25, 1967, that House Bill No. 5025, ""with an amendment,"" ought to be passed.  J. Senate 2063 (1967).  On "
943,," September 27, 1967, the full Senate adopted ""the pending amendment"" and redesignated the amended bill Senate Doc. No. 
1409.  J. Senate 2086 (1967).  The Senate passed No. 1409 on December 19, 1967.  J. Senate 2472 (1967).  The House 
approved No. 1409, as amended.  J. House of Rep. 3061 (1967).  The Governor signed it into law as St. 1967, c. 813, § 1, on 
December 26, 1967.  Although the Senate Journal does not specify what the amendment was, we may infer from the fact that 
Senate Bill No. 1409 as published contains § 2 (c), that § 2 (c) was added by the Senate Ways and Means Committee.  
Nowhere is there an indication of why this was done.  (The Massachusetts Senate and House maintain journals showing only 
what business was transacted, but do not publish debates in a manner similar to the Congressional Record.)"
943,10," The advent of computerized pricing systems is itself a prime example of the reason the FTC Act and c. 93A were intentionally 
phrased broadly to empower administrative bodies to define new offenses.  See generally Mourning v. Family Publications Serv., 
Inc. 411 U.S. 356, 365-366 (1973) (Truth in Lending Act broadly structured and Federal Reserve Board empowered to define by 
regulation to deal ""not only with the myriad forms in which credit transactions then occurred, but also with those which would be 
devised in the future"")."
943,11," As of 1977, 48 States plus Puerto Rico and Guam had enacted consumer protection laws.  Uranga, Idaho and Oregon 
Consumer Protection Acts: Administrative Powers of the Attorneys General, 13 Willamette L.J. 455, 455 (1977). Many of these 
are ""little FTC acts,"" as is G. L. c. 93A, and most are enforced by State Attorneys General.  Tongren & Samuels, The 
Development of Consumer Protection Activities in the Ohio Attorney General's Office, 37 Ohio St. L.J. 581, 582 (1976). Note, 
Consumer Protection by the State Attorneys General: A Time for Renewal, 49 Notre Dame Law, 410, 411 & n.7 (1973). See also 
Pirozzolo, Chapter 93A: The Massachusetts Little FTC Act -- A Potent Unexplored Remedy in Business Disputes, 62 Mass. L.Q. 
77 passim (1977).  Many States provide by statute that rules made by the enforcement agency shall have the force of law, or 
that violation of a rule will be prima facie evidence of violation of the statute.  See, e.g., Ill. Ann. Stat. c. 121 1/2, § 264 (Smith-
Hurd Supp. 1979) (force of law); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 5, § 207(2) (prima facie evidence); N.J. Stat. Ann. § 56:8-4 (1964) (force 
of law); R.I. Gen. Laws § 6-13.1-7 (c) (Supp. 1979) (force of law); Vt. Stat. Ann. tit.9, § 2453 (d) (1970) (prima facie evidence).  
Other States have established by case law that rules made by their Attorneys General have the force of law. See, e.g., "
944,," Department of Legal Affairs v. Rogers, 329 So. 2d 257, 261 n.2, 267 (Fla. 1976). Oregon provides by statute a list of acts which 
will be considered unfair or deceptive, and adds a ""catch-all"" category.  See Or. Rev. Stat. § 646.608(1)(u) (1979).  In order for 
an act to fall within the ""catch-all"" category, the Attorney General has to have first promulgated a rule which covers the act.  See 
Or. Rev. Stat. § 646.608(4) (1979).  See generally Uranga, supra at 474-475."
944,12," In 1976, the Legislature amended § 6 of c. 30A to provide that ""[t]he contents of the Massachusetts Register shall be judicially 
noticed and, without prejudice to any other mode of citation, may be cited by volume and page number."" St. 1976, c. 459, § 5.  
The Attorney General's regulations are duly filed with the State Secretary and published in the Massachusetts Register.  See 20 
Code Mass. Regs. 940."
944,13, The regulation in question here was properly incorporated into the record.
944,14," Purity points to the agreed fact that at the time the regulation was promulgated the Attorney General had no one on his staff 
who was an expert in the retail food industry.  Presumably FTC staff members are not experts in the substance of each business 
they regulate, but in the general areas of trade, commerce, antitrust, and consumer protection. Furthermore, Regulation XII (A) 
(1) applies to all sellers of goods or services, and is not an attempt to regulate the retail food industry only."
944,15," We note also that the FTC Act has heavy historical roots in antitrust law.  The Act as originally enacted in 1914 spoke only of 
""unfair methods of competition""; the phrase ""unfair or deceptive acts"" was added in 1938.  52 Stat. 111, c. 49, § 3 (1938).  The 
1938 amendment was probably in response to a leading case holding that a practice can be ""unfair"" even if it is not 
anticompetitive, FTC v. R.F. Keppel & Bros., 291 U.S. 304 (1934). The 1938 amendment extended protection under the FTC Act 
to consumers as well as competitors.  See H.R. Rep. No. 1613, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (1937). Chapter 93A has no such roots.  The Massachusetts Antitrust Act, G. L. c. 93, §§ 1-14A, added by St. 1978, c. 459, § 1, 
operates independently of c. 93A, except to the extent that § 11 of c. 93A (the businessman's remedy) was amended by St. 
1978, c. 459, § 3, to direct courts to consider decisions under c. 93 when interpreting ""unfair methods of competition"" in c. 93A, § 
11, actions. The Massachusetts Antitrust Act delegates investigative and enforcement powers to the Attorney General.  Presumably 
therefore the Legislature intends his powers to be very similar to those of the FTC, and it expects that his staff will have 
expertise in the areas of trade, commerce, antitrust and consumer protection. See G. L. c. 93, §§ 8, 9; G. L. c. 93A, §§ 4-8 
(investigative and enforcement powers of Attorney General under Antitrust Act and Consumer Protection Act, respectively). "
945,16," Purity does not argue that a delegation to the Attorney General to determine substantive violations of c. 93A, without specific 
statutory standards, would be improper.  See generally Opinion of the Justices, 368 Mass. 831 (1975). "
946,17," Our cases and those of the Appeals Court have begun the process of judicial inclusion, and illustrate the principle that 
unfairness or deception must be judged from the circumstances.  The following cases have held that the act in question was 
unfair or deceptive within the meaning of § 2 (a).  Linthicum v. Archambault, 379 Mass. 381, 387-388 (1979) (material breach of 
warranty by roofing contractor).  Lowell Gas Co. v. Attorney Gen., 377 Mass. 37, 50 (1979) (allocation of short-term debt interest 
expense to inventory cost of gas charged to consumers).  Heller v. Silverbranch Constr. Corp., 376 Mass. 621, 626-627 (1978) 
(failure by contractor to disclose drainage problem to prospective home buyers).  Schubach v. Household Fin. Corp., 375 Mass. 
133, 137 (1978) (practice permitted under State law may, in certain circumstances, be unfair or deceptive).  Commonwealth v. 
Gustafsson, 370 Mass. 181, 190-191 (1976) (total prohibition of ""For Sale"" signs in mobile home park).  York v. Sullivan, 369 
Mass. 157, 162 (1975) (failure of landlord to advise prospective tenants of pending rent increase).  Southbridge Water Supply 
Co. v. Department of Pub. Utils., 368 Mass. 300, 310 (1975) (dictum) (overcharging of customers by utility).  Slaney v.

176D).  Goes v. Feldman, 8 Mass. App. Ct. 84, 91-92 (1979) (improper retention of security deposit by landlord).  Frank J. 
Linhares, Inc. v. Reliance Ins. Co., 4 Mass. App. Ct. 617, 622-623 (1976) (refusal to deliver truck to which plaintiff had right of 
possession unless plaintiff would agree to release defendant from warranties on repairs). The following cases have held that the act or practice in question was not unfair or deceptive within the meaning of § 2 (a).  
Mechanics Nat'l Bank v. Killeen, 377 Mass. 100, 109 (1979) (selling of collateral by bank in erroneous belief that it could 
rightfully sell).  Kantrovitz v. Academy of Physical & Social Dev. Corp., 370 Mass. 858 (1976) (commencing illicit sexual relations 
with plaintiff's wife on guise of counseling plaintiff's son).  PMP Assocs. v. Globe Newspaper Co., 366 Mass. 593, 596 (1975) 
(refusal to sell advertising space, without more).  Cf.  Baldassari v. Public Fin. Trust, 369 Mass. 33, 44-45 (1975) (allegation that 
defendant caused ""severe emotional distress"" not sufficient to state cause of action under G. L. c. 93A, § 9). "
947,18," The Consumer Protection Act will best be effectuated when consumers participate in its enforcement.  In order to discover an 
overcharge under the UPC system a consumer would have to rely on his own marking of an item or his memory of the sign 
price.  Item pricing will enhance the over-all consumer protection scheme by removing these obstacles."
947,19," The case called to our attention by Purity in its reply brief, Katharine Gibbs Schools (Inc.) v. FTC [1979] 5Trade Reg. Rep. 
(CCH) para. 63,077 (2d Cir. Dec. 12, 1979), is distinguishable from the present case in that the preventive FTC rule overturned 
in Katharine Gibbs failed to define with specificity any act or practice which might potentially be unfair or deceptive. Instead, it 
required, among other things, schools to institute a tuition refund policy on a strict pro rata basis in order to prevent 
""indiscriminate enrollment."" See id. para. 63,077, at 77,343."
947,20," We note that the FTC consent decrees allowing posted signs near items marked with electronically scanned pricing codes 
also required the retail food stores to sell at or below advertised prices, and required stores to post signs advising consumers to 
report to the store manager any discrepancy between advertised price and price charged.  See 42 Fed. Reg. at 23,846, 23,847, 
23,851. "
948,21," HN22[
] Section 2 (b) of c. 93A, as amended by St. 1978, c. 459, § 2, states that ""[i]t is the intent of the legislature that in construing paragraph (a) of this section in actions brought under sections four, nine and eleven, the courts will be guided by the 
interpretations given by the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Courts to section 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade 
Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45(a)(1)), as from time to time amended"" (emphasis supplied).  HN23[
] Paragraph (a) of G. L. c."
948,93," A, § 2, inserted by St. 1967, c. 813, § 1, reads: ""Unfair methods of competition and unfair and deceptive acts or practices in 
the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful."" "
953,1," In the actual theory, HN3[
] marginal cost is a value determined by the additional cost necessary to produce an additional unit 
of output, be it product or service.  Defined as such, each and every unit of output has its own independent, though not 
necessarily different, marginal cost.  Accordingly, any analysis which attempts to assess the ""marginal"" cost of any aggregation 
of units of output necessarily departs from the constraints of the theory, and in fact such analyses move closer to some form of 
averaging.  Additionally, if a firm or industry in a non-perfectly competitive market faces normal theoretical cost functions, there 
may easily be levels of output for which the price obtainable in the market, i.e. the average revenue per unit, exceeds the 
average cost of supplying the product or service (thus, a clearly compensatory price) but is for some of those units less than 
their theoretical marginal cost.  Levels of output within that range are thus profitable although they are not profit maximizing.

964,1," .  As noted above, the Court rejected a similar contention in earlier litigation. In that case, Hawaiian maintained that the 
discounted car rental was the tying product and the airfare was the tied product. Here, plaintiffs urge the Court to view the airfare 
as the tying product and the car rental as the tied product. Of course, it is necessary for these plaintiffs to so urge, as only those

the buyer is free to take either product by itself there is no tying arrangement. The court also indicated that evidence of coercion 
would be an appreciable number of buyers forced to accept the tied product instead of desirable substitutes. Plaintiffs have 
made no showing at all on this point. See also Ungar v. Dunkin' Donuts of America, Inc., 531 F.2d 1211 (3d Cir.), cert. denied,

suffered nonrecoverable ""incidental' damages from an alleged conspiracy to drive certain movie production companies which 
employed none of the union members out of business."" Under this view, not only was the conspiracy itself not directed at putting 
the Conference out of business, it was not even directed at anyone who employed Conference members. The Blankenship 
quote, therefore, can be viewed as intimating that had the Conference alleged that illegal conduct had been directed toward 
putting them out of business, or even directed toward putting someone who employed them out of business, there might have 
been standing. In this case, Budget was not concerned about competition in the air transportation market. It is irrelevant that a 
greater effect might have been expected in the air transportation market, as long as it is alleged that some restraint was 
foreseeable in the car rental market as well."

Real Estate Board of New Orleans, Inc., 444 U.S. 232, 100 S. Ct. 502, 509, 62 L. Ed. 2d 441 (1980). The unlawful purpose 
referred to is an intent to enter into a conspiracy to violate the antitrust laws. While it is possible that this can be the intent to 
commit a rule of reason violation, all the cases cited by the Supreme Court involved per se violations usually price-fixing. An 
unlawful purpose egregious enough to remove the requirement of showing anticompetitive effect, and yet not involving a per se 
violation, is difficult for this Court to imagine. These plaintiffs have not shown a purpose to enter into a conspiracy per se 
violative of the Sherman Act. Neither have they shown any direct evidence of an intent to eliminate competition. Whatever 
circumstances the Supreme Court may have envisioned for allowing a § 1 violation to be established by showing unlawful 
purpose without anticompetitive effect not involving a per se violation of § 1, and not involving direct proof of an intent to 
eliminate competition are not present in this case. The Ninth Circuit's formulation of the essential elements of a rule of reason, § 
1 violation is applicable here. "

972,12," .  Sitkin even contains some language favorable to plaintiffs. The court talks of a showing that the contract or conspiracy in a 
substantial way ""unreasonably restrict(ed) competitive opportunity."" 575 F.2d at 448. Though plaintiffs have not pressed Sitkin in 
this regard, they could argue that since they were unable to legally meet Budget's price, their competitive opportunities were 
unreasonably restricted. However, the way the Court approaches the problem, nothing unreasonably restricts competitive 
activity unless it affects more than the profits of competitors. If a restraint forces competitors out of the market so that 
competition is reduced, or if it allows someone in the market to raise market prices or otherwise adversely affect the consumer, 
then and only then can there be an unreasonable restriction of competitive opportunity. "
973,13," .  Brunswick does have some language arguably favorable to plaintiffs: The short-term effect of certain anticompetitive behavior predatory below-cost pricing, for example may be to stimulate price 
competition. But competitors may be able to prove antitrust injury before they actually are driven from the market and 
competition is thereby lessened. Of course, the case for relief will be strongest where competition has been diminished."
973,429," U.S. at 489 n.14, 97 S. Ct. at 698. There is no evidence of predatory pricing here, however, see part III infra, because the 
hallmark of predatory pricing is its likelihood to exclude competitors from an entire relevant market if continued indefinitely. In this 
case, the alleged below-cost pricing (excluding the rebates) affected only a portion of the relevant car rental market. Even the 
situation anticipated in the Brunswick footnote was one of a competitor facing a substantial threat of being forced out of 
business. There is no evidence that even had the fly-drives continued indefinitely, anyone would have been forced out of the 
entire relevant market. In addition, the fly-drives were not short-lived, and so any tendency to exclude competition would likely have manifested itself. 
As noted, there was no evidence presented of exclusion of competition, nor was there even any evidence that Robert's lost 
money, as opposed to profits, in the years of the fly-drives. The Brunswick footnote does not help plaintiffs. "
974,14," .  The dissent also relied on Utah Pie's large market share in arguing no injury to competition. Admittedly, that aspect is not 
present in this case."
974,15," .  The Ninth Circuit has, since Janich, listed the essential elements of an attempt to monopolize claim in different, sometimes 
confusing ways. In Blair Foods, Inc. v. Ranchers Cotton Oil, 610 F.2d 665 (9th Cir. 1980), the court noted that specific intent to 
control prices or destroy competition, and predatory conduct directed to the accomplishment of that unlawful purpose, are the 
only two indispensible elements of an attempt to monopolize claim.  610 F.2d at 669. The court also noted that despite Lessig v. 
Tidewater Oil Co., 327 F.2d 459 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 993, 84 S. Ct. 1920, 12 L. Ed. 2d 1046 (1964), market power is 
relevant in determining whether specific intent to monopolize is present. This is not inconsistent with Janich ""s holding that 
specific intent can be inferred if there is a § 1 violation, for market power is relevant in determining whether there is a § 1 
violation. See note 17 infra. The Blair Foods court may also have been saying that market power is relevant in connection with 
direct, as opposed to inferential proof of specific intent. Finally, the Blair Foods court may have been saying that market power is 
relevant even when a § 1 violation is shown, but as no § 1 violation has been shown in this case, the Court need not consider 
that possibility. Janich also implied that there was another way specific intent could be found. Where a plaintiff relies only upon a defendant's conduct to establish an attempted monopolization claim and does not show 
market power, specific intent to monopolize should ordinarily be inferred only where the alleged conduct is of a kind clearly 
threatening to competition or clearly exclusionary. Thus, where the plaintiff does not allege and prove market power (element 3), 
he must demonstrate conduct which is clearly threatening to competition or clearly exclusionary in order to show ""predatory 
conduct which may form the basis of a substantial claim of restraint of trade."""
974,570," F.2d at 854 n.4. The quoted language suggests that conduct that does not rise to the level of an unreasonable restraint of 
trade, combined with market power sufficient to support a finding of a dangerous probability of success, may also serve as the 
basis for an inference of specific intent. Thus, in reality, plaintiffs can demonstrate specific intent by direct proof, by showing a "
975,," substantial restraint of trade (a § 1 violation) or by showing some lesser restraint of trade combined with very significant market 
power."
975,16," .  As regards the latter method, see Janich, supra, 570 F.2d at 854 n. 4 and note 15 supra."
975,17," .  In California Computer Products, supra, the court made the following statement: ""Market power is relevant to determining 
whether (making an inference of specific intent from a § 1 violation) is proper, but where a § 1 violation ""clearly' exists, proof of 
market power is unnecessary to support an inference of specific intent."" 613 F.2d at 736-37 (footnote omitted). See also 
Sherman v. British Leyland Motors, Ltd., 601 F.2d 429, 453 n.47 (9th Cir. 1979). The Court is puzzled by this statement. It does 
not see how market power is relevant in inferring specific intent from a § 1 violation that exists, but is not relevant when that § 1 
violation ""clearly"" exists. There cannot be a meaningful distinction between violations that ""merely"" as opposed to ""clearly"" exist. The California Computer Products court may have been attempting to equate a ""clear"" violation with a per se violation. However, 
once a § 1 violation is found, be it per se or rule of reason, the same market power considerations should control in determining 
whether to infer specific intent. Proof of market power may not be indispensable once a § 1 violation has been established, but 
the role of market power cannot be both qualitatively and quantitatively different, depending on whether the violation is rule of 
reason or per se. Rule of reason violations have as a concomitant part market definition, while per se violations apparently do 
not. See California Computer Products, supra, 613 F.2d at 737 n.10. Thus, the court may simply have been trying to say that in "
976,," determining whether there is a per se violation of § 1, market definition (and by implication market power) is not relevant, and so 
when considering whether to infer specific intent from a per se violation, market definition (and hence by implication market 
power) is not indispensable. It is also possible that the court was trying to paraphrase Hallmark Industry v. Reynolds Metals Co., 489 F.2d 8, 12-13 (9th Cir. 
1973), cert. denied, 417 U.S. 932, 94 S. Ct. 2643, 41 L. Ed. 2d 235 (1974), which stated: ""Therefore, evidence of market power 
may be relevant, but it is not indispensable where a substantial claim of restraint of trade is made."" Hallmark, however, made no 
distinctions between rule of reason and per se violations, or between clear and other types of violations. A substantial claim of 
restraint of trade is always necessary for a § 1, rule of reason violation. There is a difference between the market power considerations that go into a determination of whether there was an 
unreasonable restraint of trade, and the market power considerations that go into a determination of whether there was a 
dangerous probability of successfully monopolizing a particular market. Even absent the latter degree of power, the market 
share held by the defendant may well be relevant in determining whether the conduct of the defendant was sufficient to support 
a finding of an unreasonable restraint of trade. Determinations of injury to competition are made after examining all the facts surrounding a restraint. Acts carried out by a 
manufacturer with a 5% market share might not injure competition, while those same acts, when carried out by a manufacturer 
with a 33% market share, might well injure competition. Yet, that 33% market share probably could not support a finding of 
dangerous probability of success. The Court notes that it has already found that the fly-drives have not been shown to have 
injured competition regardless of Budget's market share."
976,18," .  As was stated in note 15 supra, market power may be relevant in a third way in connection with direct proof of specific intent. 
As noted, plaintiffs, in their memoranda, have not tried to establish specific intent by direct proof, but rather only by inference."
976,19," .  Defendant has introduced copies of the yellow pages from the telephone books of the several Hawaii counties from 1973, a 
period at the height of the fly-drives, and from 1976, a period just prior to the filing of the instant lawsuit. Though the yellow 
pages themselves are hearsay, the Court believes they could either come into evidence under one of several exceptions to the 
hearsay rule, or else the data underlying them (which is almost certainly reliable) could be proved by non-hearsay testimony. "
977,20," .  The court granted defendant's motion for summary judgment on the ground that there was not sufficient evidence to support 
a finding of either specific intent to monopolize or dangerous probability of success. The court did note that if it had been forced 
to decide the dangerous probability issue, it would have required more evidence defining the relevant market. What this Court considers most instructive about Motorola is that the basis for the antitrust violations was alleged unfair trade 
practices. The Motorola court noted: ""While plaintiff may have a viable cause of action under state law or the Federal Trade 
Commission Act, this court does not believe that defendant's conduct, even accepting plaintiff's version of it, is sufficient to 
support the requisite inference of intent to monopolize under section 2."" 421 F. Supp. at 291. In this case, though the relevant 
market is also very competitive, plaintiffs have not even presented evidence that Budget's market share was as large as 
Motorola's in the Motorola case."
977,21," .  It is perhaps possible that an inference of specific intent may be drawn exclusively from conduct that is not actionable under § 
1, but only if that conduct is unilateral, and hence not a contract, combination or conspiracy. The conduct must still unreasonably 
restrain trade, and hence a plaintiff would still have to show an injury to competition. "
978,22," .  Fixed costs are those that in the short run do not vary with changes in output. They include such things as expenses of 
management, interest on bonded debt and items of irreducible overhead. Variable costs vary in the short run with changes in 
output. They include such items as raw materials, fuel, labor used to produce the product, indirect labor for clerical and custodial 
tasks, utilities, repair and maintenance costs and per unit royalties and license fees. Average cost is determined by adding the 
fixed and variable costs and dividing by output. Average variable cost is determined by dividing the variable costs by output.

Marietta Corp., 615 F.2d 427 (7th Cir. 1980)."
978,23," .  There was testimony that Budget admitted that absent the payments from Aloha it would have lost money on the fly-drives. 
This probably means it would have lost money considering average cost. Average cost is the relevant cost if before the fly-
drivers all of the Budget's cars were being rented. If a firm is operating at capacity, marginal cost must include increasing the 
ability to produce, and in this context that would mean either buying more cars or reducing turnaround time. If there is complete 
use, reducing prices only results in losing money (disregarding the rebates). There is no evidence regarding what percentage of 
Budget's, or anyone else's cars were being rented prior to the fly-drives. "
979,24," .  The Court has also discussed whether there was below marginal cost pricing of any product, aside from the question of 
whether that product had sufficient market importance to even support a claim of predatory pricing, and aside from the question 
of whether the rebates should be disregarded. Were the only issue before the Court whether, ignoring the rebates, the fly-drives 
were sold at below marginal or average variable cost, the Court would find that there are disputed questions of fact on this issue. "
980,25," .  Though the state limitations provision, Haw.Rev.Stat. § 480-24 (1976), differs from the federal, see part V infra, this case is 
not one of a ""continuing violation,"" as the fly-drives took place two years after the acquisitions. Hence, there can be no possible 
relation back. "

983,27," .  The Court viewed these criteria not as relevant only in the context of cigarette advertising, but rather as those generally used 
by the Commission in considering questions of fairness."
983,28," .  Some guidance is available from other courts as to what constitutes an unfair method of competition or an unfair trade 
practice. In Barquis v. Merchants Collection Association of Oakland, Inc., 7 Cal.3d 94, 496 P.2d 817, 101 Cal.Rptr. 745 (1972), 
the court was discussing California's statute prohibiting unfair competition, which is statutorily defined as any unlawful, unfair or 
fraudulent business practice. The court talked of such things as wrongful business practices generally, in whatever context they 
may occur. The court also spoke of violations of fundamental rules of honesty and fair dealing. In Covenant Radio Corp. v. Ten Eighty Corp., 35 Conn.Supp. 1, 390 A.2d 949, 955 (1977), the court, quoting Spiegel, defined 
an unfair trade practice as one that offends ""public policy and is immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous or substantially 
injurious to consumers."" Interpretations of the Connecticut statute, as interpretations of § 480-2, are to be guided by 
interpretations of § 5 of the F.T.C. Act. In Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Melody Recordings, Inc., 134 N.J.Super. 368, 341 A.2d 348, 352 
(Super.Ct.App.Div.1979), the court noted that the tendency of the law has been to espouse scrupulous standards of commercial 
morality and business fairness in trade. ""Reflecting this bent, it has been observed that the essence of unfair competition is fair 
play."" In Harrington Manufacturing Co., Inc. v. Powell Manufacturing Co., Inc., 38 N.C.App. 393, 248 S.E.2d 739, 744 (Ct.App.1978), 
the court stated that unfair competition refers to conduct a court of equity would consider unfair. ""Thus viewed, the fairness or 
unfairness of particular conduct is not an abstraction to be derived by logic. Rather, the fair or unfair nature of particular conduct 
is to be judged by viewing it against the background of actual human experience and by determining its intended and actual 
effects upon others."" "

G. Renner, and the district court ordered such.  The trial proceeded on this basis.  The jury returned a verdict in favor of ITA in 
the sum of $ 139,000.  On February 22, 1978, a new trial was granted by the district court on the basis that a jury trial presided 
over by a United States magistrate was improper.  The parties then stipulated to a retrial by Magistrate Renner acting as a 
Special Master pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(2) and Fed.R.Civ.P. 53.  The stipulation and order thereon provided that the 
evidentiary proceedings and the jury trial would be deemed to be the proceedings before the Special Master. On April 24, 1978, the transcript and documentary evidence of the jury trial, along with some additional testimony and exhibits,

advertisement, that Lynn made a few changes, but that the ad as published was substantially the same as the initial draft."
995,8," Additionally, Western chose not to rerun the ad inasmuch as TGCs had ceased doing well on the west coast and chose to run 
a very similar ad in the Minnesota papers.  Both of these factors may have been taken into consideration in regard to the 
findings by the Special Master that the ad was effective. "
996,9," In relevant part, the letter read as follows: There has been a good deal of talk and activities centered around Travel Group Charters. Obviously, Western has a point of 
view on TGCs.  Frankly, we don't think they are a good deal for the public or for the travel industry.  Let me tell you why. Most TGCs are filed for peak-season departures.  We wonder if the entire travel industry isn't doing itself a good deal of harm to 
take its prime vacation destinations and sell them at bargain basement rates during a period when that product is at peak 
demand. I have attached a proof of the first advertisement that is scheduled to run in newspapers in your area on Sunday, September 16.

997,10," Western asserts, as a defense to ITA's allegations, that ITA's TGC advertisements appearing before Western initiated its anti-
TGC campaign were deceptive, illegal and fraudulent, and thus Western should not be held liable for its own challenged 
conduct.  We find the Special Master's reliance on Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. International Parts Corp., 392 U.S. 134, 138-40, 
88 S. Ct. 1981, 1984-85, 20 L. Ed. 2d 982 (1968) to be on point and controlling: Although in pari delicto literally means ""of equal fault,"" the doctrine has been applied, correctly or incorrectly, in a wide variety of 
situations in which a plaintiff seeking damages or equitable relief is himself involved in some of the same sort of wrongdoing.  
We have often indicated the inappropriateness of invoking broad common-law barriers to relief where a private suit serves 
important public purposes.  It was for this reason that we held in Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Seagram & Sons, 340 U.S. 211, 71 S. Ct. 
259, 95 L. Ed. 219 (1951), that a plaintiff in an antitrust suit could not be barred from recovery by proof that he had engaged in 
an unrelated conspiracy to commit some other antitrust violation.  Similarly, in Simpson v. Union Oil Co., 377 U.S. 13, 84 S. Ct. 
1051, 12 L. Ed. 2d 98 (1964), we held that a dealer whose consignment agreement was canceled for failure to adhere to a fixed 
resale price could bring suit under the antitrust laws even though by signing the agreement he had to that extent become a 
participant in the illegal, competition-destroying scheme.  Both Simpson and Kiefer-Stewart were premised on a recognition that 
the purposes of the antitrust laws are best served by insuring that the private action will be an ever-present threat to deter 
anyone contemplating business behavior in violation of the antitrust laws. The plaintiff who reaps the reward of treble damages 
may be no less morally reprehensible than the defendant, but the law encourages his suit to further the overriding public policy in 
favor of competition.  A more fastidious regard for the relative moral worth of the parties would only result in seriously 
undermining the usefulness of the private action as a bulwark of antitrust enforcement.  And permitting the plaintiff to recover a 
windfall gain does not encourage continued violations by those in his position since they remain fully subject to civil and criminal 
penalties for their own illegal conduct.  Kiefer-Stewart, supra. In light of these considerations, we cannot accept the Court of Appeals' idea that courts have power to undermine the antitrust 
acts by denying recovery to injured parties merely because they have participated to the extent of utilizing illegal arrangements 
formulated and carried out by others.  * * * We therefore hold that the doctrine of in pari delicto, with its complex scope, contents, 
and effects, is not to be recognized as a defense to an antitrust action. The only exception that Perma Life allows is when the illegal conspiracy ""would not have been formed but for the plaintiff's 
participation."" Javelin Corp. v. Uniroyal, Inc., 546 F.2d 276, 279 (9th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 938, 97 S. Ct. 2651, 53 L. 
Ed. 2d 256 (1971). This exception is not applicable here. "

1001,14," Western devotes much time and effort to a First Amendment defense, arguing in connection with this defense that the 
Sherman Act cannot be violated by the publication of an ad.  We find no merit in this argument.  First, HN5[
] the First Amendment/Sherman Act relationship is embodied in the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 
U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965) and Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 
U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961), and the basis of this doctrine is not an all-encompassing First Amendment 
protection.  While consideration of the First Amendment is an inherent part of the Noerr-Pennington analysis, the basis is that 
activities done in furtherance of the right to petition are not within the scope of the Sherman Act. State of Missouri v. National 
Organization for Women, Inc., 620 F.2d 1301 (8th Cir. 1980). Secondly, the ad is not the violation in this case; the violation is the anti-TGC campaign. Finally, Western admits that conduct otherwise illegal cannot be immunized merely because it was carried out by means of 
speech.  Consequently, simply because part of the anti-TGC campaign (which we hold to be an unreasonable restraint of trade) 
was carried out by means of ""speech,"" does not create a basis for immunization. "
1002,15," But see Perryton Wholesale, Inc. v. Pioneer Distributing Co., 353 F.2d 618, 621-22 (10th Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 383 U.S. 
945, 86 S. Ct. 1202, 16 L. Ed. 2d 208 (1966) (conspiracy to suppress competition through the elimination of competition by 
unfair means is an unreasonable restraint of trade)."
1002,16," As discussed in Part V infra, Western also had a monopoly over the Twin Cities-Las Vegas route, and operated a plan known 
as the Group 60 Fare, the seats for which were very much in demand by travel agencies."
1002,17," Hard competition * * * is neither unfair nor a violation of the antitrust laws * * * the antitrust laws were not designed to 
immunize competitors from the public-serving rigors of the market place; rather they were supposed to advance the system of 
free competition to the fullest extent practicable, all to the end that the consuming public might receive better goods and services 
at lower prices. General Communications Engineering, Inc. v. Motorola Communications & Electronics, Inc., 421 F. Supp. 274, 290-91 
(N.D.Cal.1976). "
1004,18," Western points out that the meeting was called by MSAA to discuss the ad, and that the ad was cancelled following the 
meeting.  Western argues from this that it is inconsistent to conclude that MSAA was threatened by Western in regard to MSAA's 
participation in TGCs.  Apparently, it is Western's contention that if MSAA succeeded in having Western cancel the ad, then 
MSAA had the upper hand throughout the entire meeting.  We perceive no inconsistency in both of these topics, cancelling the 
ad and cancelling the TGCs, being discussed, and the finding of a threat by Western. "

Century-Fox Film Corp. v. Brookside Theatre Corp., 194 F.2d 846, 859 (8th Cir. 1952). We note that at least one court has approved an award of attorney's fees which far exceeded the substantial untrebled damage 
figure.  Pitchford Scientific Inst. Corp. v. Pepi, Inc., 440 F. Supp. 1175 (W.D.Pa.1977), aff'd, 582 F.2d 1275 (3d Cir. 1978)."
1009,23," In reviewing the award of attorney's fees, this court has expressed the following caveat: A party is not entitled needlessly to accumulate exorbitant legal fees with the expectation that the losing party will be called upon 
to pick up the entire tab.  This court will exercise vigilance and pare down needless and unconscionably high legal fees.  An 
award of attorney's fees is compensatory, not punitive, * * *. Planned Parenthood of Minnesota, Inc. v. Citizens for Community Action, 558 F.2d 861, 871 (8th Cir. 1977) (award of attorney's 
fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988). "

1011,25," Western asks that we disallow time spent on the jury trial before the magistrate, and make further reductions for duplications 
of effort because two firms were involved in the work.  With regard to this latter point, this court will not interfere with the decision 
of ITA and its two counsel to divide the burdens of a complex trial between the counsel.  See Computer Statistics, Inc. v. Blair, 
418 F. Supp. 1339, 1351 (S.D.Tex.1976). Concerning the jury trial which was later ruled invalid by the district court, we note both 
parties stipulated to the jury trial. While we disagree with the contention of ITA that the jury trial did not require more attorney 
time than would a bench trial, we do agree ITA should not be denied this time simply because a higher court ruled the jury trial 
invalid.  As stated in Pitchford Scientific Inst. Corp. v. Pepi, Inc., supra, 440 F. Supp. at 1178 (footnote omitted) (we reject) defendants' contention that because the case was tried twice counsel is not entitled to compensation for work done at 
the second trial, on the theory that such work was ""duplication."" It seems clear that it is reasonably necessary to retry a case 
when an appellate court directs a retrial.  Counsel are not to be penalized by being required to work for nothing as punishment 
for failure to know at the first trial what the Court of Appeals was going to do. "
1012,26," See, e. g., Dunn v. H. K. Porter Co., 602 F.2d 1105, 1110 (3d Cir. 1979); Farmington Dowel I, supra, 421 F.2d at 89-90.

1012,28," It has been noted that (a) HN20[

F.2d 430 (2d Cir. 1960). The subject was discussed in some detail during the congressional debates on the Labor Management 
Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, reproduced at 2 NLRB-Legislative History (1959) pp. 1377, 1385, 1576, 1680, 1708. In 
brief, the industry developed in this fashion when union attempts to organize garment workers met with management resistance. 
Manufacturers transformed themselves into jobbers and farmed out their production work to non-union outside contractors that 
sprang up to meet the manufacturing demand. The fierce competition among these contractors was made possible by the 
substandard wages paid their unorganized workers. The unions responded by picketing jobbers to obtain agreements binding "
1024,," them to use only unionized contractors. Congressional concern for the garment workers unions' ability to continue organizing 
outside contractors' employees by picketing jobbers led to enactment of the garment industry proviso of § 8(e) of the National 
Labor Relations Act (""NLRA""), 29 U.S.C. § 158(e). See note 5, infra."

skill or price, the Employer shall be permitted to subcontract its work to any other shop whether union or not."" Counsel for the ILGWU defendants were understandably puzzled at oral argument by the apparent discrepancies in the

any agreement which is within the foregoing exception."" "
1032,30," While the ILGWU defendants comprise the parent union and two of its affiliated locals, their actions must be regarded as 
unilateral action within the context of antitrust law. In Connell the Court acknowledged that the statutory exemption ""allows 
unions to accomplish some restraints by acting unilaterally,"" 421 U.S. 616 at 622, 95 S. Ct. 1830 at 1835, 44 L. Ed. 2d 418, 
citing Federation of Musicians v. Carroll, 391 U.S. 99, 88 S. Ct. 1562, 20 L. Ed. 2d 460 (1968), where the challenged conduct 
was that of a parent union and one of its locals."
1032,31," ""Combinations are no less unlawful because they have not as yet resulted in restraint. An agreement or combination to follow 
a course of conduct which will necessarily restrain or monopolize a part of trade or commerce may violate the Sherman Act, 
whether it be ""wholly nascent or abortive on the one hand, or successful on the other.' "" Associated Press v. U. S., 326 U.S. 1, 
12, 65 S. Ct. 1416, 1421, 89 L. Ed. 2013 (1945), quoting U. S. v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 225, 60 S. Ct. 811, 
846, 84 L. Ed. 1129 (1940). "
1033,32," The concerted conduct of the ILGWU defendants cannot be regarded as a combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade 
under § 1 of the Sherman Act, since such conduct constitutes unilateral action by a union. See n. 30, ante. The sought-for 
jobber's agreement with Jou-Jou is an illegal contract in restraint of trade only if such a Hazantown agreement constitutes a per 
se violation of § 1. This proposition, implicit in Jou-Jou's argument if not expressly stated, finds no support in antitrust law, and, 
as demonstrated ante, runs counter to labor law. Thus no claim arises under § 1 of the Sherman Act; and, for comparable 
reasons, the facts do not support a claim of attempted monopolization under § 2, individually or as the result of combination or 
conspiracy. Professor Sullivan, after reviewing the recent Supreme Court cases, sums them up thus: ""In their totality these cases suggest both an analytical stance and an objective: to reconcile labor and antitrust policy where 
possible and, where not, to weigh claims of each and give way to the stronger."" Op. cit. supra at p. 729. In the case at bar, labor policy favoring the defendant unions' conduct clearly predominates."
1033,33," In Connell the Court left open the effect of the Norris-LaGuardia Act upon the general contractor's request for a permanent 
injunction against picketing to coerce execution of the agreement; there was no picketing then in progress, and, ""(i)f the 
agreement in question is held on remand to be invalid under federal antitrust laws, we cannot anticipate that Local 100 will 
resume picketing to obtain or enforce an illegal agreement."" 421 U.S. at 637 n. 19, 95 S. Ct. at 1842. The circumstances are 
different in the case at bar, since the Article XX arbitration (the analogue to the picketing sought to be enjoined in Connell ) is 
presently pending. Having held that the unions' conduct in the instant case does not violate the antitrust laws, perhaps we could 
also avoid the Norris-LaGuardia question; but it has been fully briefed and argued, and forms an alternative basis for decision. 
There is also something to be said for indicating this Court's view, in the event of an appeal. We have also considered Jou-Jou's contention that, under principles of res judicata, the absence of a ""labor dispute"" is 
established by the prior proceedings before Judge Pollack of this Court, and the state court on remand (see text accompanying 
n. 19, ante ), so as to preclude the application of Norris-LaGuardia. We have examined the transcript of the evidentiary hearing "
1034,," before Judge Pollack. While at times he spoke in rather broad phrases, Judge Pollack focused exclusively upon whether Local 
23-25's picketing was violent or peaceful. That was the only issue before him. Concluding that Jou-Jou had shown the violent 
nature of the picketing, Judge Pollack remanded the case to the state courts, under settled authority. The issue whether the 
ILGWU unions' subsequent initiation of Article XX arbitration gives rise to a Norris-LaGuardia ""labor dispute"" (a question 
answered in the affirmative by Green v. Obergfell, supra ) was not before Judge Pollack or the state courts, and res judicata 
does not apply."
1034,34," Jou-Jou's professed irreparable injury arising out of labor relations ""instability,"" which the Court was initially inclined to accept, 
does not withstand further analysis. There is no evidence that either Jou-Jou's ""inside"" employees or its contractors are in such a 
state of nervous tension, as the result of these events, that Jou-Jou's business has been adversely affected. Jou-Jou further argues that ""(w)hat the ILGWU was unable to accomplish by enjoined violence, it seeks under Article XX"" (reply 
brief at p. 2). That is not necessarily a ground for condemnation; the beating of swords into ploughshares is accepted social 
conduct. In the view we take of the case, it is unnecessary to reach the issues said to arise under NLRB v. Plasterers' Local 79, 404 U.S. 
116, 92 S. Ct. 360, 30 L. Ed. 2d 312 (1971)."

claims are dismissed before trial, even though not insubstantial in a jurisdictional sense, the state claims should be dismissed as 
well.""). "

1053,2," In a happy if unusual circumstance both the private and public sector have endorsed the escrow system.  The Federal Housing 
Administration (F.H.A.) regulations mandate the use of escrow accounts on all government insured loans.  24 C.F.R.  § 
203.24(a) (1979).  The Veteran's Administration (V.A. encourages the use of escrow accounts.  38 C.F.R.  § 36.4512 (1979)."
1053,3," A study published in 1973 estimated that 93.6 per cent of mortgage lenders used the escrow method of accounting. See United 
States Savings & Loan News, March, 1973."
1053,4," Escrow accounts are also called reserve, trust, impound, or impoundment accounts. "
1054,5," A typical agreement in a mortgage or Deed of Trust may provide: ""When requested by the noteholder, Grantors will pay with and in addition to the monthly payments of principal and interest 
installments are due and payable, a sum equal to one-twelfth of the estimated annual ground rents, taxes, hazard insurance 
premium and special assessments, if any, next due on the Mortgaged Premises.  If the amount so paid is not sufficient to pay 
such ground rents, taxes, hazard insurance premium and assessments when due, then Grantors will deposit immediately with 
the Noteholder an amount sufficient to pay such ground rents, taxes, hazard insurance premiums and assessments.  If there is a 
default under any of the provisions of this Deed of Trust resulting in a sale of the Mortgaged Premises or foreclosure or if the 
Noteholder acquires the Mortgaged Premises otherwise after default, the Noteholder shall apply at the time of commencement 
of such proceedings or at the time the property is otherwise acquired, the balance then remaining of the funds accumulated 
under this provision as a credit against the amount then remaining unpaid under the Note.  No interest shall accrue or be 
allowed on any payments made under the provisions of this paragraph, nor shall Noteholder be required to maintain accounts 
separate and apart from its general funds for deposit of the escrow herein provided for ."""
1054,6," But see Haas v. Pettsburgh National Bank , 60 F.R.D. 604 (W.D. Pa. 1973). In Haas , the federal district court for the Western 
District of Pennsylvania concluded that a single plaintiff, as a class representative, had standing to sue two banks against which 
the plaintiff had no individual claims.  The court reasoned that ""once the class has been determined whatever defects may exist as to the standing of the original named plaintiff can be cured 
by the eventual opting in (or more properly, under Rule 23(c)(2) failure to opt out) of class members who possess exactly those 
elements necessary to standing that the named plaintiff lacked."" Id., at 612. The Court regards Hass as contrary to the weight of authority, and declines to follow its rationale.  With Judge Newcomer, this 
Court believes that standing to sue is ""an essential threshold which must be crossed before any determination as to class under 
Rule 23 can be made."" Weiner v. Bank of King of Prussia, 358 F.Supp. 684, 688 (E.D. Pa. 1973)."
1054,7," Plaintiffs plainly have alleged an injury to their ""business or property"" within the meaning of Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 
U.S.C.  § 15. See Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 337-45 (1979). There thus has been satisfaction of the Article III 
requirement that a plaintiff suffer ""some actual or threatened injury as a result of the putatively illegal conduct of the defendant."" 
Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group , 438 U.S. 59, (1978).  The focus of the analysis here is to determine "
1055,," whether those injuries ""fairly can be traced"" to the nondealing defendants.  This causation element of the standing requirement 
was amplified in Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization , 426 U.S. 26, 41-42 (1976)."
1055,8," This is a lesson to be gleaned from Peather-bridge v. Altadena Federal Savings & Loan Ass'n , 37 Cal. App. 3d 193, 112 Cal. 
Rptr. 144 (1974). Peatherbridge is a case which arose under California law.  Plaintiffs alleged that thirty eight lending institutions 
conspired to coerce their borrowers to maintain escrow accounts.  The plaintiffs had dealt with only three of the thirty eight 
defendants, and offered only a ""scintilla"" of evidence to support their conspiracy claim.  The trial court dismissed the thirty-five 
defendants with whom the plaintiffs had not dealt, ruling that plaintiff had failed to show a ""substantial possibility"" that she could 
prove a conspiracy. This decision was affirmed, the appellate court ruling that ""the trial court… properly required some proof of 
the conspiracy charge for the purpose of ascertaining whether plaintiff had standing."" 37 Cal. App. 3d at 201-02, 112 Cal. Rptr. 
at 150. The appellate court explained its ruling: ""[The evidence in support of the conspiracy claim] was minuscule at best.  If such a scintilla of evidence was sufficient to justify 
the maintenance of a class action, the fundamental requirement of standing would be rendered meaningless.  By merely alleging 
a conspiracy without any significant proof, any plaintiff could maintain any type of action against any combination of defendants 
with whom he enjoyed no legal relationship."" Id.; See also Kinee v. Abraham Lincoln Federal Savings & Loan Ass'n, 365 F.Supp. 975 (E.D. Pa. 1973)."
1055,9," Largely because plaintiffs standing to sue non-dealing defendants, and thus this Court's jurisdiction over those defendants, are 
dependent upon the sufficiency of the conspiracy allegations, the Court twice has directed plaintiffs to set forth with particularity 
the facts which form the basis for their conspiracy claim. See Worth v. Seldin , 422 U.S. 490, 501 (1975). These directives, 
although arising in a different context, fulfill much the same purpose as the ""certification"" procedure used in Mountain View 
Pharmacy v. Abbott Laboratories , No C-77-0094 (D. Utah, filed Mar. 23 1977), and Portland Druggist Ass'n v. Abbott 
Laboratories , No. 71-543 (D. Ore., filed Aug. 6, 1971).  In Mountain View Pharmacy and Portland Retail Druggist , both antitrust 
conspiracy cases, merits discovery was stayed until the plaintiffs filed a certificate specifying a factual basis for concluding first, 
that the claim was made in good faith, and second, that there were reasonable grounds to believe that discovery would yield 
information relevant to the claim.  This procedure was analyzed, refined, and endorsed in an insightful article, Durham & Dibble, 
Certification: A Practical Device for Early Screening of Spurious Antitrust Litigation , 1978 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 299 (1978). The article, 
in turn, was cited with approbation by the Supreme Court in Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 345 (1979)."
1055,10," The eight defendants that changed from the capitalization to the escrow procedure of accounting, and the dates of the change, 
are: ""A.  Peninsula Savings & Loan Assoc. -- March 1973 for conventional loans; "
1056,," ""B.  Virginia Beach Federal Savings & Loan Assoc. -- October 1974; ""C.  Atlantic Permanent Savings & Loan Assoc. -- January 1972 for other than FHA which were always escrowed; ""D.  Chesapeake Savings & Loan Assoc. -- June 1975; ""E.  Fidelity American Bank -- June 1972; ""F.  First American Savings & Loan Assoc. of Virginia -- June 1975; ""G.  First Savings & Loan Assoc. of Suffolk -- October 1973; ""H.  Mutual Federal Savings & Loan Assoc. -- December 1972"" A ninth defendant, Life Federal Savings and Loan Association, adopted the escrow method of accounting for conventional loans 
in 1960."
1056,11," Pleading requirements under the federal rules, in the context of antitrusts suits, have been discussed in a number of articles.  
See Freund, The Pleading and Pre-Trial of an Antitrust Claim , 46 Cornell L.Q. 555 (1961); Marcus, The Big Antitrust Case in the 
Trial Courts ; 37 Ind. L.J. 51 (1961); 58 Colum. L. Rev. 408 (1958); 30 Rocky Mtn. L. Rev. 363 (1958). "
1057,12," In other mortgage escrow cases courts have ruled uniformly that plaintiffs allegations do state a claim upon which relief can be 
granted.  See, e.g., Wolfson v. Artisans Savings Bank, 428 F.Supp. 1315, 1319 (D.C. Del. 1977), Beck v. Athens Building Loan 
& Savings Ass'n, 65 F.R.D. 691; 694-95 (M.D. Pa. 1974); Kinee v. Abraham Lincoln Federal Savings & Loan Ass'n , 365 
F.Supp. 975, 980 (E.D. Pa. 1973); Stavrides v. Mellon Bank & Trust Co., 353 F.Supp. 1072, 1076 (W.D. Pa. 1973). See also 
First Federal Savings & Loan Assn' of Chester, 466 F.Supp. 578 (E.D. Pa. 1979) (summary judgment)."
1057,13," The rigorous standard of analysis that governs claims under Rule 11, as expressed in Murchison, has been applied in other 
decisions.  See e.g., Child v. Beame, 412 F.Supp. 593, 600 (S.D.N.Y. 1976); Covnaglia v. Ricciardi, 63 F.R.D. 416, 419 (E.D. 
Pa. 1974). The Court will defer to the precedent set by these decisions, but admits to some reservations about the wisdom of so 
strict a standard.  Other courts have employed a more objective measure.  See, e.g., Crimmins v. American Stock Exchange, "
1058,368," F.Supp. 270, 281 (S.D.N.Y.), aff'd, 503 F.2d 560 (2d Cir. 1974) (an attorney must be ""convinced beyond professional doubt"" 
that there are facts and law to support claims asserted in a pleading). A clearly undesirable standard would be one requiring a lawyer to sign a complaint only if he or she ""has every reason to 
believe"" that the plaintiff will prevail.  This was the standard enunciated by the English Court of Chancery in Great Austalian Gold 
Mining v. Martin, 5 Ch. D. 1, 10 (1877). For a thorough treatment of the history, purpose, and application of Rule 11, see, Risinger, Honesty in Pleading and its 
Enforcement: Some ""Striking"" Problems with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, 61 Minn. L. Rev. (1976). "
1059,14," Three defendants, Berkley Citizens Mutual Savings & Loan Ass'n, Seaboard Savings & Loan, and Colonial Mortgage 
Corporation of the District of Columbia, have denied maintaining escrow accounts.  It is Court's understanding that these 
defendants do not require monthly prepayment, do not pay interest on those funds, and do not capitalize on the funds.  How 
these institutions account for their prepayments is unknown to the Court.  They will be kept as parties defendant only because of 
the plaintiffs' assertion that the institutions do require prepayments on which no interest is paid."
1059,15," Pleadings were stricken in an action when it was clear that the named plaintiff essentially was recruited by the attorney and 
knew little or nothing of the nature of the claim.  See Freeman v. Kirby, 27 F.R.D. 395, 397-99 (S.D.N.Y. 1961)."
1059,16," See also Hernandez v. United Fire Insurance Co., 79 F.R.D. 419, 426 (N.D. Ill. 1978); Wellman v. Dickinson, 79 F.R.D. 341, 
347 (S.D.N.Y. 1978); George v. LeBlanc, 78 F.R.D. 281, 285 (N.D. Tex. 1971). "
1060,17," See generally Waterman, An Appellate Judge's Approach when Reviewing District Court Sanctions Imposed for the Purpose 
of Insuring Compliance with Pretrial Orders, 29 F.R.D. 420 (1961); Comment, Involuntary Dismissal for Disobedience or Delay: 
The Plaintiff's Plight, 34 U. Chi. L. Rev. 922 (1963); Comment Sanctions at Pre-Trial Stages, 72 Yale L.J. 819 (1963); Annot.  4 
A.L.R. 2d 348 (1949) (Dismissal of Action for Failure or Refusal of Plaintiff to Obey Court Order)."
1060,18," This observation, of course, applies only when a dismissal is with prejudice.  See Generally 9 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal 
Practice and Procedure § 2373(1971)."
1060,19," The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals enumerated some of the factors that govern motions pursuant to Rule 41(b) in McCargo v. 
Hedrick, 545 F.2d 393 (4th Cir. 1976). Among the factors noted were the degree of personal responsibility on the part of the 
plaintiff, the amount of prejudice to the defendant caused by the delay or noncompliance, the indications of deliberately dilatory 
strategies, and, lastly, the appropriateness of the sanction.  545 F.2d at 393. Judge Butzner summarized the broad issue in these cases in one sentence: ""Against the power to prevent delays [and to 
dismiss for noncompliance] must be weighed the sound public policy of deciding cases on their merits."" Reizakis v. Loy , 490 
F.2d 1132 (4th Cir. 1974)."
1060,20," Defendants also cite Fendler v. Westgate-California Corp., 527 F.2d 1168 (9th Cir. 1975) (dismissal of third amended 
complaint because plaintiff failed to comply with directive of court that such complaint be limited ""to certain expressly stated 
claims""); and Finley v. Rittenhouse, 416 F.2d 1186 (9th Cir. 1968) (dismissal because plaintiff failed to comply with an order that 
he file an amended complaint setting out the particular facts on which he relied). "
1061,21," In practice district courts have relied more on the ""rule-making"" power conferred by Rule 83 than on the ""decision-making"" 
power which the drafters of the rule considered more significant.  The Supreme Court has held that a district court has a duty to 
fashion procedures to ""dispose of the matter as law and justice require."" Harris v. Nelson, 394 U.S. 286 (1969). The Court also 
has stated that Rule 83 enables a district court, in appropriate circumstances, to dismiss a case before it in the absence of a 
local or federal rule explicitly permitting such a dismissal.  See Link v. Wabash, 370 U.S. 626, 633 n. 8 (1962); see also Van 
Bronkhorst v. Safeco Corp., 529 F.2d 943, 951 (9th Cir. 1976)."
1061,22," The problem of abusive class suits brought largely to secure settlement was examined recently in a superb study, Durham & 
Dibble, Certification: A Practical Device for Early Screening of Spurious Antitrust Litigation, 1978 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 299 (1978). In 
the view of the authors, ""[one] of the most deeply troubling perversions of the discovery process involves using the threat of "
1062,," expensive discovery costs to extort substantial settlements from innocent defendants."" Id. at 302. The authors explained how 
this might occur: ""By thoroughly invoking the process of discovery, the plaintiff can possibly find enough evidence to establish a jury issue, and in 
any event can immediately boost the amount of a nuisance value settlement from the defendants.  By pulling everyone in an 
industry into a complex lawsuit dragnet-style and then selling peace for a price below the costs of defending the lawsuit, the 
plaintiff can often secure early settlements, thereby augmenting its war chest while simultaneously narrowing the number of 
parties and reducing its prosecution costs.  In this setting, the pragmatic business man is faced with the dilemma of either 
investing in a fight to protect his honor of capitulating to save litigation expenses.  Confronted with such a choice, companies 
may well decide to pay a nuisance value settlement rather than face an irate board of directors later if the legal expenses 
escalate or the lawsuit is lost."" Id . at 306 (footnotes omitted). The Supreme Court has noted that: ""[to] the extent that… [the discovery] process eventually produces relevant evidence which is useful in determining the merits of 
the claims asserted by the parties, it bears the imprimatur of those Rules and of the many cases liberally interpreting them.  But 
to the extent that it permits a plaintiff with a largely groundless claim to simply take up the time of a number of other people, with 
the right to do so representing an in terrorem increment of the settlement value rather than a reasonably founded hope that the 
process will reveal relevant evidence, it is a social cost rather than a benefit."" Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U.S. 733, 741 (1975). See also the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Powell, joined 
by Justices Stewart & Rehnquist, to the recently proposed amendments to the federal discovery rules.  42 U.S.L.W. 4499 (May 
6, 1980). For further discussion, see generally Belcher, Is the Class Action Doing the job?  (Plaintiff's Viewpoint), 55 F.R.D. 365 (1972);

1063,23," Professor Sullivan illustrates why ""conscious parallelism"" far from establishes a classic conspiracy: ""If a newsboy hawks 'Extra'!  and several passers stop to buy, one cannot infer from their common action that they were acting 
concertedly in the manner of a group carrying out a shared plan to buy papers.  No more is the world of the living a conspiracy to 
breathe.  A classic conspiracy has occurred only when common action has been taken in furtherance of some common design, 
only if the actors have become a group and have reached an accord about how they will act.  One can infer accord from 
common action only if it occurs in a setting which bespeaks accord."" L. Sullivan, Handbook of the Law of Antitrust § 110 at 315 (1977)."

Schedules and the Sherman Act, 1978 Duke L.J. 645 (1978). The problem of provider control was also alluded to by the

Physicians Service was unchallenged, id. at 330, 72 S. Ct. at 694. Goldberg & Greenberg, supra at 65-66."
1081,3," A Blue Shield advertising brochure used until recently to attract physician membership stated: Blue Shield is a nationally recognized symbol of voluntary prepayment coverage for medical expenses. It is known as the 
""doctors' plan for the people,"" but it is, realistically, also the doctors' plan for the doctors, with control and guidance originating 
from members of the medical profession. "
1082,4," The Blue Shield brochure described in note 3 continued: When new programs are established, they are sustained by reimbursement principles representing the collective judgments of 
area physicians acting through societies and through Board representation."
1082,5," In United States v. Sealy, Inc., the Supreme Court rejected the contention of Sealy manufacturer-licensees that their exclusive 
territories were vertically imposed by the licensor, Sealy, Inc. The Court found that Sealy, Inc. was substantially owned and 
controlled by the manufacturer-licensees, and therefore its action in allocating territories was actually a horizontal agreement 
between its licensee stockholders. Accord, United States v. Topco Associates, Inc., 405 U.S. 596, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 31 L. Ed. 2d 
515 (1972)."
1082,6," A most illuminating illustration of the provider interest at work in the administration of the Plans is this statement by Levi W. 
Hulley, Jr., M.D., medical director of the Richmond Plan, which appears in the May 25, 1972 minutes of the Committee on 
Mental Health of the Medical Society of Virginia: "
1083,," BLUE CROSS-BLUE SHIELD COVERAGE; Dr. Hulley assured the Committee of the interest of Blue Cross-Blue Shield where psychiatric services are concerned and 
discussed a report prepared under the direction of Dr. Wingfield and a special committee of the Neuropsychiatric Society. The report is concerned with services provided by psychiatrists and charges involved. It has been referred to the Blue Shield 
Board for consideration and final disposition. It was brought out that a number of groups, which have a part in the overall mental health picture, are little by little working their 
way into the therapy field. It seemed to be the consensus that The Medical Society of Virginia should take a firm stand on this 
encroachment and seek to stop it once and for all. It was brought out that psychotherapy apparently means different things to different people and it was agreed that it should be 
defined as that performed by psychiatrists or under the direct supervision of psychiatrists."
1083,7," See American Motor Inns, Inc. v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 521 F.2d 1230, 1243 (3rd Cir. 1975)."
1083,8," Contrary to the suggestion by the district court, it was the Commission and not BSV which brought the action. The 
constitutionality of the statute was upheld by the Commission. Commonwealth of Virginia ex rel State Corporation Comm. v. 
Blue Cross of Virginia, Case No. 19829 (Feb. 14, 1979)."
1083,9," We do not hold that the defendant's conduct was within the ""sham"" exception to the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. See Noerr, 
supra, 365 U.S. at 144, 81 S. Ct. at 533, California Motor Transport, supra. The ""sham"" exception applies when the right is 
actually exercised, but in a manner calculated to interfere directly with a competitor's business. Repeated frivolous litigation "
1084,," calculated to delay a competitor's licensing would be an illegal sham. But until the right to petition is exercised, the ""sham"" 
inquiry is not reached."
1084,10," We are also unable to agree with the district court's application of the State action exemption to the collaboration of the 
Richmond and Roanoke Plans in the administration of ""national accounts,"" the operation of which is fully described in the district 
court's opinion.  469 F. Supp. at 557-58. Although Virginia may have created a need for cooperation by prohibiting the Plans 
from operating outside their assigned territories, the State certainly does not compel the defendants to exclude psychologists 
from direct coverage. The application of the State action exemption in this case is thus precluded by our decision in Ballard v. 
Blue Shield of Southern West Virginia, Inc., 543 F.2d 1075 (1976). (No) action on the part of West Virginia compels the defendants to exclude chiropractors from their insurance plans. West 
Virginia law specifically authorizes the defendant companies to insure the costs of chiropractic treatment, but the defendants 
have not elected to provide this coverage. Therefore they can claim no immunity under Parker v. Brown. Cantor v. Detroit Edison 
Co., 428 U.S. 579, 96 S. Ct. 3110, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1141 (1976); Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 778-92, 95 S. Ct.

Ed. 2d 233 (1980). In this case the state does not even permit the challenged policy; A fortiori it is not state action. Despite our disagreement with the Court's reasoning, we do not rest our finding of liability on the cooperation of the plans in the 
management of these accounts. Each national account involves a contract between one ""control plan"" and subscriber whose 
employees reside in several Blue Shield territories. The terms are arrived at between those parties; and the ""participating plans"" 
act as the agents of the control plan in administering the contract in their respective areas. They are required to follow exactly 
the terms of the control contract, and are reimbursed by the control plan for their expenditures. This cooperation certainly is not 
in restraint of trade. "

Carroll, and all the cases cited by the defendant relate to corporations and their subdivisions or officers.  In addition, counsel for 
the defendants repeatedly stressed at oral argument the independent nature of each local's decision, characterizing the January 
9 directive as one of ""policy"", not ""command""."

1100,8," .  In the previous year, the Court had ruled that certain violent activity on behalf of labor organizations did not subject the labor 
groups to antitrust liability.  Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U.S. 469, 60 S. Ct. 982, 84 L. Ed. 1311 (1940). Some employees of 
a hosiery factory, together with a large number of non-employees, seized control of the plant, prevented the employer from 
shipping completed hosiery in interstate commerce and destroyed over $ 800,000 of machinery. Nonliability of the defendants 
was based not on statutory immunity, but rather upon the plaintiff's failure to demonstrate the requisite jurisdictional effect on 
interstate commerce. The Court emphasized that ""only when the intent or necessary effect upon such commerce in the article is 
to enable those preventing the manufacture to monopolize (the) supply or control its price, or discriminate as between its would- "
1101,," be purchasers, that the unlawful interference with its manufacture can be said directly to burden interstate commerce."" Id., at 
510-11, 60 S. Ct. at 1001. In the circumstances of Apex the obstruction of transportation of the goods of a single manufacturer 
was deemed to have an insufficient effect on interstate commerce to invoke the Sherman Act. Since 1940 the jurisdictional breadth of the Sherman Act has expanded significantly. ""(Activities) within the flow of interstate 
commerce or affecting commerce are within the statute's embrace . . . (and) (w)hat may appear to be relatively local will, in fact, 
ultimately affect similar or related goods or services moving into or out of a market."" P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law PP 
232a, 232b (1978). This expansive view was recently exemplified in a private antitrust action against real estate brokers and trade associations 
alleging that the defendants conspired to fix prices through an agreement to conform to a fixed rate of broker's commissions on 
sales of residential realty. The Court ruled that the plaintiffs need not make the particularized showing of an effect on interstate 
commerce caused by the alleged conspiracy or other allegedly unlawful acts. Sherman Act jurisdiction could be established, 
rather, by demonstrating that the defendants' brokerage activity had a substantial effect on interstate commerce. McLain v. Real 
Estate Board of New Orleans, Inc., 444 U.S. 232, 242, 100 S. Ct. 502, 509, 62 L. Ed. 2d 441 (1980). Professors Areeda and Turner would presume the existence of Sherman Act jurisdiction even when trade restraints are localized 
based on their ""inherent tendency to affect interstate resource allocation and the interstate movement of goods and services in 
our national economy."" P. Areeda & D. Turner, supra, P 232b, at 230."

1111,1," .  No other defendant has joined in SEC's motion. However, the other defendants have indicated that in their view, they have the 
right to assert the arguments comprehended in SEC's motion in the pending appeal of Pretrial Order No. 237 (April 14, 1980) in 
the Third Circuit. See n.2, infra. A description of the litigation may be found in our Opinion and Order (Introduction to Summary Judgment Motions; Subject 
Matter Jurisdiction), 494 F. Supp. 1161, also filed on April 14, 1980."
1111,2," .  In addition, the Third Circuit may want our views on the issues comprehended in SEC's motion, since SEC's argument, if valid, 
would constitute an alternate ground in support of our order of April 14, 1980, Pretrial Order No. 237. In considering the § 
1292(b) appeal, the Third Circuit may reach all issues ""properly put in dispute"" bearing upon whether the order appealed from 
was appropriate.  Consolidated Express, Inc. v. New York Shipping Ass'n, 602 F.2d 494 (3d Cir. 1979). "
1112,3," .  SEC does not contend that Article XVI of the treaty affects in any way the power of the United States to control importation by 
levying customs duties or by other means. Accordingly, SEC does not contend that the Treaty rendered illegal the assessment 
of dumping duties under the Antidumping Act of 1921, 19 U.S.C. § 160 et seq., prior to the revision and reenactment of that law 
in 1979, 19 U.S.C. § 1673 et seq. See generally Antidumping Opinion, 494 F. Supp. at 1223-1226 (comparing 1916 and 1921 
Antidumping Acts)."
1112,4," .  Thus we do not reach the standing issue raised by Zenith. We note, however, that SEC contends that the decisions cited by 
Zenith are inapposite here because they are grounded in substantive provisions of the Treaty other than Article XVI and are not 
based on principles of standing which are of general application in interpretation of the Treaty. Cf. Calnetics Corp. v. Volkswagen 
of America, Inc., 532 F.2d 674, 693 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 940, 97 S. Ct. 355, 50 L. Ed. 2d 309 (1976) (treaty 
considered in litigation involving no parties of foreign nationality). SEC notes in this regard that Article XVI(1) of the treaty, unlike 
the provisions considered in Avigliano, supra, and Spiess, supra, protects Japanese ""products"" and not just Japanese nationals 
or Japanese companies. Accordingly, SEC argues, an American national or American company which resells Japanese 
products in the United States is entitled to invoke the protection of Article XVI(1) against discriminatory treatment of the products 
which it resells. We express no opinion on the merits of this argument. We also do not undertake the comparison of the 1916 Act with the Robinson-Patman Act, which would be necessary if we 
accepted SEC's contentions. The Treaty mandates only that Japanese products be accorded treatment as favorable as that 
afforded to products made in the United States. SEC complains that as a reseller of Japanese products, it is subjected to a law 
which does not apply to domestic products. However, the 1916 Act is a price discrimination law which was intended to extend to 
importers the strictures of Section 2 of the Clayton Act, the price discrimination law which controlled domestic commerce in 1916 
and which, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act in 1936, applies to domestic commerce today. See Antidumping Opinion, 
494 F. Supp. at 1217-1223. Thus the prohibitions of the 1916 Act are similar, in gross terms, to prohibitions which do apply to 
resellers of domestic products as well, viz, the Robinson-Patman Act. To the extent that, in SEC's submission, the Treaty "
1113,," requires that the legal strictures which apply to sellers of imported goods and those which apply to sellers of domestic products 
must be precisely identical, we could not rule on SEC's motion without making a detailed comparison between the 1916 Act and 
the Robinson-Patman Act. Our disposition of SEC's motion renders that comparison unnecessary. "
1115,5," .  Although this question arose prior to consideration by the Subcommittee on Commercial Treaties of the Treaty with Japan, the 
State Department's representation as quoted in the text, supra, is pertinent to the interpretation of the Treaty with Japan. The 
treaties then under consideration were essentially the same as the Treaty with Japan, and were eventually considered by the full 
Committee on Foreign Relations and by the full Senate along with the Treaty with Japan, on a consolidated basis. In In the 
Matter of Grand Jury Investigation of the Shipping Industry, 186 F. Supp. 298, 320 (D.D.C.1960), the court relied on the same 
State Department letter which we consider here, finding the representations therein pertinent to the interpretation of the same 
Treaty with Japan which is now before us. "

section, the public policy of this state is declared to be: To ease the burden of payment for hospital services, particularly in the 
low income groups, where with the advance of scientific methods the payment for adequate hospital services is a pressing 
problem with grave social ramifications, nonprofit hospital service corporations, based on the tested experience in many parts of 
the United States, economically sound and socially beneficent, are needed.  While in no way changing the present status of 
voluntary hospitals in the state, these corporations will enable a larger number to procure for themselves adequate hospital 
services and leave the use of the free and part-free services given by the hospitals to those whose economic status makes self-
procurement of such services impossible.  Without imposing the burden on the public treasury and free from any motive of profit, 
these corporations will contribute to the solution of a pressing social and economic problem in the state and merit the support of 
the citizens."" In 1975, the legislature completely revised Wisconsin insurance law.  Sec. 182.032, Stats., was repealed by ch. 223, sec. 4,

1178,1," By order of the Court dated March 15, 1979, Allied Artists Pictures Corp., one of the plaintiffs in this action, was allowed to 
withdraw from the lawsuit and is no longer a party."
1178,2," By order of the Court dated June 22, 1979, defendants Riffe, Brown and Celeste, the Speaker of the House, former Secretary 
of State and former Lieutenant Governor, respectively, were dismissed from this action.  Allied Artists Corp. v. Rhodes, 473 F. 
Supp. 560 (S.D.Ohio 1979). "
1181,3," ""Final print"" is a term used in the industry for the completed motion picture from which copies are made for distribution to 
theaters."
1181,4," ""Trade screening"" is used herein as defined by the Ohio Act to mean the showing of a motion picture to interested exhibitors 
prior to bidding, offering terms, accepting bids, or agreeing to terms for licensing that picture. See R.C. 1333.05(H) and (I)."
1181,5," The plaintiffs suggest that the Court use the more neutral term ""advance licensing"" to refer to this bidding process. Although 
neither term satisfactorily describes the process, I have selected ""blind bidding"" to refer to bidding without prior trade screening, 
since it appears to be more widely used in the industry and since it more accurately describes the situation of an exhibitor 
offering terms on a picture he has not seen. ""Advance licensing,"" on the other hand, is used in this opinion to refer to the 
licensing of a film with or without screening before the final release print is available."
1181,6," This stipulation, covering a two-year period beginning January 1, 1969, was subsequently extended for two additional two-year 
periods and expired January 1, 1975. United States v. Paramount Pictures, Civil Action 87-273 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 14, 1968). The 
signatory parties to the decrees were Columbia Pictures Corp., MGM Inc., National General Corp., Paramount Pictures Corp., 
Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp., United Artists Corp., Universal Pictures, and Warner Brothers-Seven Arts Distributing Corp. "
1186,7," The Court does not credit the defendant's argument that trade screening should not delay a release because a film may be 
trade screened before it is completed. The statute does not specify whether a motion picture must be in final form before it is 
trade screened, and evidence has been introduced that for purposes of screening before the Classification and Rating 
Administration (CARA), trade usage has construed the term ""completed motion picture"" to mean a picture at some stage short of 
completion. There is also evidence that a film has on occasion been trade screened in a rough form. (See, e.g., Tr. IV-62, 
""Prophecy."") Nonetheless, the evidence is ample that for the purpose of assessing the commercial viability of a motion picture, 
both producer-distributors and exhibitors prefer to view the completed film as that term is understood in its plain ordinary 
everyday meaning, that is, after a final print is produced. "
1187,8," Other evidence relevant to alleged delays was provided by Paul Grossman, head buyer for Mid-States Theatres, Inc. Mr. 
Grossman's testimony shows clearly that dozens of the plaintiffs' first-run films were successfully licensed in suitable theaters in 
Ohio between the operative date of the Act and the time of trial. Of approximately 33 new releases licensed by Mid-States 
Theatres in Cincinnati during that time, about half had been assigned national release dates. Of those, the witness could identify 
only one which had been delayed in Ohio, ""Prisoner of Zenda."" A few were exhibited in Ohio before the national release date. 
The time between the date of trade screening and the date of exhibition varied from ten days for ""Manhattan"" to over four 
months for ""Voices."" The time between the mailing by plaintiffs of bid solicitations and the date bids were due after trade 
screening varied from eight days to a month. The longer periods did not arise by operation of the statute but were a direct result 
of plaintiffs' decisions. Thus, for example, the one delayed picture, ""Prisoner of Zenda,"" distributed by Universal, was solicited in April 1979, trade 
screened on May 14 and licensed by Grossman to appear in his Ohio theaters on the national release date of May 25. A few 
weeks before its scheduled release date, Universal unilaterally changed the Ohio date to June 15. Mr. Grossman testified that he believed another picture, ""Meatballs,"" appeared in Ohio a week later than it did in the rest of the 
country. Assuming that ""Meatballs,"" distributed by Paramount, was indeed delayed a week in Ohio, it is difficult for the Court to 
infer that its delay was caused by the Ohio statute. That film was solicited April 23, 1979, trade screened on April 28 and bid on 
May 7. It was not shown in Ohio until July 20. Granting Paramount a reasonable time to consider bids and award contracts, it is 
clear that the trade screening requirement was not the cause of the one week delay. Similarly, ""Voices"" was not shown until four months after the bidding process began. Yet to include four months in assessing the 
time required to license a picture would be inaccurate. ""Voices"" was trade screened five days after bid solicitation letters were 
mailed and Ohio exhibitors had returned bids for it within twelve days. Other examples of bidding times under the statute may be 
found at Tr. XV-106-145. "
1192,9," Plaintiffs' complaint, in Count III, alleges that the Ohio statute violates the Equal Protection Clause as well as the Due Process 
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Although the plaintiffs do continue to assert that the Act 
has no rational relation to any legitimate state interest, because they have not pursued the equal protection challenge, and 
because the Court can conceive of no grounds in support of such an argument, the Court declines to consider the equal 
protection claim further. "
1194,10," Even when a license agreement was cancelled months in advance of the exhibition date, exhibitors testified that most other 
first-run films were by that time unavailable, having themselves been advanced licensed. Tr. XV-103; XVI-56-58. Paramount 
Vice President Frank Mancuso testified that when production delays threatened to postpone release of the motion picture ""Going 
South,"" Paramount cancelled existing license agreements and speeded up production on another film, ""American Hot Wax"" to fill 
that time slot. He acknowledged that the alternative film was not given to exhibitors who had committed their theaters to ""Going 
South""; those exhibitors were compelled to bid competitively with others with no assurances of obtaining the ""replacement"" film. 
Tr. IV-139."
1194,11," There has been much argument concerning the ""abusive"" and ""oligopolistic"" practices of the plaintiffs. The question whether 
the uses to which the plaintiffs put their bargaining power before the Act rose to the level of federal or state antitrust violations is 
not presented to this Court and is not decided by it. There is no hint in the Act that it was intended to rectify antitrust abuses. Whether the Ohio General Assembly perceived abuses 
of that magnitude is not in issue here. The Court finds merely that the plaintiffs, as the major producer-distributors of motion 
pictures, are in a strong market position relative to the smaller and more numerous exhibitors, and that the statute serves to put 
the Ohio exhibitors on a more equitable footing. It is a fair inference that the legislature perceived a situation in the trade which it 
considered unfair to Ohio exhibitors and sought, by the Act, to improve their lot. "
1196,12," Since the parties have stipulated that none of the motion pictures produced or distributed by the plaintiffs is obscene, this 
Court is not concerned with First Amendment theories rooted in the notion of obscenity as ""unprotected expression."" See, e.g., 
Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 93 S. Ct. 2628, 37 L. Ed. 2d 446 (1973); Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 77 S. 
Ct. 1304, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1498 (1957)."
1196,13," Within this category may lie the obscenity censorship cases; those cases are irrelevant to the issues presented in this case 
insofar as they deal with content-directed regulation which calls for a stricter scrutiny. They are pertinent only to the extent that 
they indicate that motion pictures are protected forms of expression and that this protection is never absolute. See, e.g., 
Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U.S. 51, 85 S. Ct. 734, 13 L. Ed. 2d 649 (1965). "
1197,14," In fact, the opposite may be true. To the extent that plaintiffs' former practices affect the diversity of motion pictures at all, the 
evidence supports the inference that they may discourage production and distribution of controversial films or of low-budget films "
1198,," with unknown artists. Of this opinion was Max E. Youngstein of Max E. Youngstein Enterprises, Inc. who gave the following 
illustration in discussing the academy award-winning movie ""Marty,"" distributed by United Artists in 1955: . . . I don't think that under today's conditions of blind bidding that a picture like ""Marty,"" which costs approximately $ 
350,000 to make and had no stars in it, could ever be made. . . . if you blind bid, by its very term, you don't get a chance to look at the picture. You don't know what the quality is. I 
mean, anyone looking at the basic ingredients only ha(s) a story about a fat butcher from the Bronx played by Ernie 
Borgnine who had never played a leading role in his life. (It) isn't exactly the most attractive package. It becomes attractive 
after you have seen the picture. Tr. XVII-115-16. "
1199,15," See also the discussion below, Part V. D. relating to delay in the context of lesser restrictive alternatives under the Commerce 
Clause."
1199,16," Plaintiffs attempt to strengthen their Commerce Clause claims by stressing the nature of their product as subject to First 
Amendment and copyright protection and to establish a hierarchy of items in commerce in which First Amendment protected 
material has a prominent place. Accordingly, plaintiffs argue that this Court should apply ""a far more exacting level of scrutiny"" 
under the Commerce Clause because ""the item of commerce at stake is expression protected by the First Amendment."" 
Plaintiffs' Reply Brief at 7; plaintiffs' Post-Trial Brief at 34. While some authority for distinguishing between the types of products 
in commerce may be found in cases in which the Supreme Court has relaxed its Commerce Clause doctrine for regulation of 
objects which it found to be ""not legitimate subjects of trade and commerce,"" Bowman v. Chicago & Northwestern R. Co., 125 
U.S. 465, 489, 8 S. Ct. 689, 700, 31 L. Ed. 700 (1888); see Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U.S. 617, 98 S. Ct. 2531, 57 L. Ed. 
2d 475 (1978); and certainly the type of product subject to regulation must normally be considered in assessing the impact of a 
regulation on its flow in commerce, the Supreme Court has avoided drawing doctrinal lines on the basis of the nature of the 
product regulated. See Philadelphia v. New Jersey, supra, 437 U.S. at 622, 98 S. Ct. at 2535. In Breard v. Alexandria, 341 U.S. 
622, 637, 71 S. Ct. 920, 930, 95 L. Ed. 1233 (1951), the Court specifically rejected the argument now urged by plaintiffs when it 
remarked as follows in connection with the effect of a ""Green River"" ordinance on magazine sales: We recognize the importance to publishers of our many periodicals of the house-to-house method of selling by solicitation. As a 
matter of constitutional law, however, they in their business operations are in no different position so far as the Commerce 
Clause is concerned than the sellers of other wares. (Emphasis supplied.) "
1200,17," As of the time of trial, 14 states in addition to Ohio had enacted anti-blind bidding statutes. The states adopting similar 
provisions up to the time of trial are: Alabama, South Carolina, Louisiana, Virginia, Georgia, Tennessee, West Virginia, New 
Mexico, Utah, Idaho, North Carolina, Washington, Maine and Oregon. Aside from variations in enforcement provisions, the enactments are quite similar, in every case prohibiting blind bidding, 
requiring trade screening, and regulating bidding procedures. "
1205,18," While it is clear that ""one of the fundamental purposes behind the Copyright Clause of the Constitution, as shown in 
Madison's comments in The Federalist, was to promote national uniformity and to avoid the practical difficulties of determining 
and enforcing an author's rights under the differing laws and in the separate courts of the various states,"" H.Rep. No. 94-1476, 
94th Cong., 2d Sess., (1976), the Copyright Clause of the Constitution envisages concurrent rather than exclusive federal 
power.  Goldstein v. California, 412 U.S. 546, 93 S. Ct. 2303, 37 L. Ed. 2d 163 (1973); 1 Nimmer on Copyright § 1.01(B) at 1-6. 
Since that clause does not preempt state legislation in this area, the Court will not consider the claim of preemption by Article I, § 
8 further. But Congress in enacting the Copyright Act of 1976, Pub.L. No. 94-553, § 101 et seq., 90 Stat. 2572, effective January 
1, 1978, statutorily preempted state copyright laws by creating a single federal system for both published and unpublished 
works. 1 Nimmer on Copyright § 1.01(B) at 1-6. "
1208,19," The two cases relied on by the plaintiffs are clearly distinguishable from the instant case.  Sperry v. Florida, supra, it should 
be noted, is concerned not with patent rights, which are in legal effect analogous to copyrights, but with a federally-endowed 
license to practice patent law under certain circumstances. It does not stand for a proposition that no state may regulate the sale 
or licensing of patented articles in commerce. In Remick Music Corp. v. Interstate Hotel Co., supra, the court was clearly 
concerned with the absolute forfeiture of the federally protected right worked by the state statute for the failure to abide by the 
conditions it imposed on the exercise of that right. "
1209,20," The Court has rejected above the chain of inferences advanced by the plaintiffs intended to yield the conclusion that the 
guarantee prohibition will discourage investment and ultimately reduce artistic endeavor. Even if such a finding could be made, 
the legal conclusion the plaintiffs would have the Court draw therefrom is defeated by the rule discussed infra that ""(t)he 
copyright law, like the patent statutes, make reward to the owner a secondary consideration."" United States v. Paramount 
Pictures, Inc., 334 U.S. 131, 156-57, 68 S. Ct. 915, 929, 92 L. Ed. 1260 (1948). "
1214,21," The evidence indicates that large exhibitors have the means to gain information about a motion picture and license terms that 
small exhibitors cannot. See, e.g., Tr. XI-66; XVII-32-34. The most obvious example is the ability of the larger exhibitor with 
theaters in several states to use information gained from licensing in one state when licensing in other states. "
1218,1," The case had been transferred by the Clerk in April, 1979, to Judge McNaught upon his assuming office; but as transferor 
judge we retained jurisdiction of all motions then under advisement."
1218,2," As grounds for the additional attachment, plaintiffs explained that a leasehold interest which they had sought to attach in the 
amount of $ 5,000,000 had been terminated while the motion for attachment was being considered by the court. "
1219,3," Plaintiffs' decision to withdraw the motion for preliminary injunction seems to us well taken.  In its August 1979 memorandum 
of decision, which is reported at 475 F. Supp. 973, the court sua sponte addressed the question of its authority to order a Rule 
65 preliminary injunction as a form of equitable attachment over defendants' stock. The precise issue had not been argued or 
briefed by the parties.  At the time, we proposed alternative bases for our power to order the requested form of preliminary 
injunction. Each depended on whether we took a narrow or broad view of the phrase, "". . .  and other corresponding or 
equivalent remedies"", in Rule 64 a point apparently not settled under the present state of the law.  See 475 F. Supp. at 977. 
Defendants correctly point out in their recent memorandum, however, that on the question of the scope of state law remedies we 
incorrectly distinguished the case of Daley v. Ort, D.Mass.1951, 98 F. Supp. 151, which denied a motion for equitable 
attachment prior to verdict.  Had we had the occasion to rule now directly on this point, which we would have had if plaintiffs had 
not withdrawn their motion for preliminary injunction, we probably would have changed that aspect of our prior decision and 
denied the injunction.  Massachusetts law permits equitable attachment in this instance, presented in the form of a preliminary 
injunction only in actions founded upon a debt, which this action is not.  Mass.G.L. c. 214, § 3(7).  See, H. G. Kilbourne Co. v. 
Standard Stamp Affixer Co., 1913, 216 Mass. 118, 103 N.E. 469; Daley v. Ort, supra, at 152. "
1220,4," Hence the rule regarding backhaul allowances. See 85 F.T.C. 1174 (1975). Since the backhaul issue was raised by 
defendants' counsel at the hearing on the pending motions, the rule bears restating.  If a seller adopts a uniform delivered 
pricing system, its pricing options must be ""(1) uniform, and (2) available to all customers on a non-discriminatory basis."" 85 
F.T.C. at 1176. While the delivered pricing system is in operation, a backhaul allowance to one customer is illegal; a non-
discriminatory option offered to all customers to purchase at an alternative f. o. b. price is not.  Thus an improper backhaul 
allowance involves selective deviation from a delivered pricing system once it's in place.  It is not the equivalent, as defendants 
seem to suggest, of charging a uniform mill or base price for the product and either adding a delivery charge according to the 
distance of the purchaser from the plant, or permitting all purchasers to contract independently for delivery."
1220,5," The quoted opinion clarified an earlier advisory opinion to the General Foods Corporation.  In the course of the clarification the 
FTC noted that the legality or illegality of the delivered price system chosen by General Foods was not at issue.  At issue was "
1221,," only whether General Foods could follow a delivered price system with respect to one set of purchasers, while it offered freight-
related allowances to private carrier customers positioned to take ""dock"" delivery. 85 F.T.C. at 1175. "
1222,6," In ITT Community Development Corp. v. Barton, 5 Cir. 1978, 569 F.2d 1351, for example, nothing in the Florida law on 
garnishment authorized a court to order funds paid into the registry of the court to secure payment before judgment was entered."
1222,7," We are confused by the citation to Bruce's Juices, Inc. v. American Can Co., 1946, 330 U.S. 743, 67 S. Ct. 1015, 91 L. Ed. 
1219, upon which defendants have in part based their statutory construction of the Clayton Act. Bruce's Juices construed only 
the Robinson-Patman Act.  At issue in that case was whether the plaintiff-buyer should be allowed to seek as a final remedy a 
declaration from the court that certain notes could not be collected on by the defendant-seller who was found to have violated 
the Robinson-Patman Act.  Such a remedy, in the Court's view, was clearly outside the intended purposes of the Robinson-
Patman Act.  The case does not deal either with the Sherman or Clayton Acts, or with the provisional remedy of prejudgment 
attachment. "
1227,1, .  The contract provided as follows: 
1228,," R&F/TVA Sales : In the event that after the date of this agreement, and continuing through and including February 28, 1985, 
R&F shall sell or deliver coal to TVA, whether such sale shall be made directly to TVA by R&F or through any other agency or 
intermediary, under the (1975 Havoco-TVA contract), or any other subsequent agreement, then in that event, R&F shall pay to 
Havoco (0.35%) of the net selling price per ton to TVA for the first 150,000 tons per month, and (0.7%) per ton for each ton in 
excess of 150,000 tons per month, based upon net selling price of R&F, f. o. b. Bellaire, Ohio. . . . The payments referred to 
herein shall be made promptly upon receipt of payment by R&F for such coal delivered. The contract was negotiated not only as consideration for the assignment, but also in settlement of a lawsuit between R&F and 
Havoco which arose out of an earlier contract between the parties."
1228,2," .  The complaint also named Seaway River Terminal, Inc., which is engaged in the business of operating barge loading facilities 
for the transport of coal and is also a subsidiary of Seaway Coal, and Elmer Hill and Hilco, Inc., the latter of which is also 
engaged in the marketing of coal to TVA. Between April 1975 and March 1976, Hill who now serves as president of Hilco, served 
as an officer and director of Havoco. It was Havoco's contention that Hill conspired with R&F during this time period to induce 
Havoco's agreement to the assignment, knowing that R&F did not intend to make the commission payments. "
1229,3," .  Section 2 of the Sherman Act may be employed to challenge a merger or acquisition which will create a vertical integration 
that will foreclose a share of the market otherwise open to competitors, if the net effect of the integration is to provide the 
economic power or leverage within the market for the creation of the monopoly. See Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 
294, 328, 82 S. Ct. 1502, 1525, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1962). See generally II E. Kintner, Federal Antitrust Law § 12.16 (1980). "
1232,4," .  The district court observed in its order dismissing the original complaint that ""(it) appears from the facts as pleaded that there 
has simply been an elimination of a middle-man between a manufacturer and a buyer."" We think, however, that the elimination 
of an independent marketer or ""middleman"" may well run afoul of the Sherman Act where, for example, the effect will be to 
eliminate a marketer of competing brands in favor of an exclusive sales agent of the manufacturer or producer, thereby affecting 
interbrand competition. For the reasons discussed in text, infra, we do not believe this to be such a case."
1232,5," .  Because our decision rests on an analysis of the pleading, we set out in full the pertinent allegations of the amended 
complaint:"
1232,23," . Commencing in the Spring or Summer of 1977, defendant Shell Oil Co. entered into unlawful contracts, and engaged in an 
unlawful combination and conspiracy, with co-conspirators R&F Coal, Seaway Coal, Seaway Terminal, Hilco, Inc., Hill, and 
others. The unlawful contracts, combination, and conspiracy were entered into and engaged in with the purpose and effect of 
restraining interstate commerce in an effort to lessen and restrict competition between plaintiff on the one hand and Shell Oil 
Company and the co-conspirators on the other."
1232,24," . Shell Oil Company's unlawful conduct has included, but is not limited to, (a) its combination with Seaway Coal, Seaway 
Terminal, and R&F Coal (by acquisition of Seaway Coal, and its subsidiaries Seaway Terminal and R&F Coal), in order to 
establish Shell Oil Company (i) as a dominant marketer of competitive sources of energy, oil and coal, in the same geographical 
area, and (ii) as a dominant marketer of coal to the TVA; and (b) causing, in whole or in part, R&F Coal to breach its March 19, 
1976 contract with Havoco, Exhibit B hereto, by not paying to Havoco any of the commissions due and payable thereunder."
1232,25," . The purpose, intent, and effect of the unlawful contracts, combination and conspiracy alleged herein was to damage and 
injure plaintiff, the public, and the trade by destroying plaintiff's competitive position as an established marketer of coal and 
producer of oil. As a result, competition in interstate commerce has been lessened and restricted, with a harmful effect on prices 
and on the availability of choices to customers for coal and oil. Plaintiff was a competitor, and still is a potential competitor, of 
defendant Shell Oil Company's R&F Coal subsidiary, of Hilco, Inc., and of Hill in the marketing of coal to the TVA and others. In 
addition, plaintiff was, and still is a competitor of Shell Oil Company in the production of oil."
1232,26," . As Shell Oil Company and its co-conspirators knew, the contract between plaintiff and R&F Coal was one of the most 
valuable assets plaintiff owned, and performance by R&F Coal of its obligations under that contract was essential to plaintiff's 
economic viability."
1232,27," . In addition, Shell Oil Company is one of the largest oil producers in the world, while plaintiff is a small, independent oil 
producer. Destruction (or substantially (sic) weakening) of plaintiff would serve Shell Oil Company's ends by reducing 
competition in oil production."
1232,28," . If allowed to continue, the unlawful contracts, combination, and conspiracy alleged herein will have precisely the effect Shell 
Oil Company and its co-conspirators intended. As a direct result, plaintiff has been unable to engage in further marketing of coal 
in competition with the co-conspirators (including Shell Oil Company's R&F Coal subsidiary), and has been unable to expand its 
activities as an independent oil producer. "
1234,6," .  There is no allegation here, nor could there be, that TVA represents the entire market for coal, either nationally or within a 
defined geographic area. While we need not decide the question here, we acknowledge that a situation where a single 
purchaser represented the entire market for a commodity would be distinguishable, and that effect on such a market might in 
some circumstances be sufficient to meet the anticompetitive effect element of a Section 1 violation. "
1238,1," .  The contractual relationship between Hess and its dealers may be embodied in a single, comprehensive document, or in two 
or more related documents. The Court finds no significance in the difference, and therefore will refer to either arrangement as a 
""dealership agreement."" "
1239,2," .  The federal statute is Subchapter I, ""Franchise Protection,"" of the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 2801-
2806, which is noted at 25 S.D.L.Rev. 69 (1980). For an example of a state statute, see the New Jersey Franchise Practices Act, 
N.J.Stat.Ann. §§ 56:10-1 to :10-15 (West Supp. 1979-1980). In some states, such rights have been created by case law. See, 
e.g., Shell Oil Co. v. Marinello, 63 N.J. 402, 307 A.2d 598 (1973), cert. denied, 415 U.S. 920, 94 S. Ct. 1421, 39 L. Ed. 2d 475

1239,3," .  See Transcript of Proceedings at 125 (Dec. 18 & 19, 1978)."
1239,4," .  The New Jersey Franchise Practices Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. §§ 56:10-1 to :10-15 (West Supp. 1979-1980), appears to allow the 
franchisor to obstruct transfer of the franchise only for reasons related to the ""character, financial ability or business experience 
of the proposed transferee"": It shall be a violation of this act for any franchisee to transfer, assign or sell a franchise or interest therein to another person 
unless the franchisee shall first notify the franchisor of such intention by written notice setting forth in the notice of intent the 
prospective transferee's name, address, statement of financial qualification and business experience during the previous 5 
years. The franchisor shall within 60 days after receipt of such notice either approve in writing to the franchisee such sale to 
proposed transferee or by written notice advise the franchisee of the unacceptability of the proposed transferee setting forth 
material reasons relating to the character, financial ability or business experience of the proposed transferee. If the franchisor 
does not reply within the specified 60 days, his approval is deemed granted. No such transfer, assignment or sale hereunder 
shall be valid unless the transferee agrees in writing to comply with all the requirements of the franchise then in effect. Id. § 56:10-6. Moreover, it makes it a prohibited practice for any franchisor, inter alia : To require or prohibit any change in management of any franchisee unless such requirement or prohibition of change shall be for 
good cause, which cause shall be stated in writing by the franchisor(,) To restrict the sale of any equity or debenture issue or the transfer of any securities of a franchise or in any way prevent or 
attempt to prevent the transfer, sale or issuance of shares of stock or debentures to employees, personnel of the franchisee, or 
heir of the principal owner, as long as basic financial requirements of the franchisor are complied with, and provided any such 
sale, transfer or issuance does not have the effect of accomplishing a sale of the franchise(, or) To provide any term or condition in any lease or other agreement ancillary or collateral to a franchise, which term or condition 
directly or indirectly violates this act. "
1240,," Id. § 56:10-7. Additionally, the statute defines ""franchise"" as follows: ""Franchise"" means a written arrangement for a definite or indefinite period in which a person grants to another person a license 
to use a trade name, trade mark, service mark, or related characteristics, and in which there is a community of interest in the 
marketing of goods or services at wholesale, retail, by lease, agreement, or otherwise. Id. § 56:10-3(a). This Court has found no published decisions determining the effect of these provisions on the type of non-
assignment clause used in Hess dealership agreements."
1240,5," .  Section 56:10-10 of the New Jersey Franchise Practices Act provides for a private right of action by a franchisee against its 
franchisor, and for the franchisor's payment of successful franchisees' attorneys' fees. "
1241,6," .  The pertinent section of the Act provides: HN3[
] To the extent that any provision of this subchapter applies to the termination (or the furnishing of notification with 
respect thereto) of any franchise, or to the nonrenewal (or the furnishing of notification with respect thereto) of any franchise 
relationship, no State or any political subdivision thereof may adopt, enforce, or continue in effect any provision of any law or 
regulation (including any remedy or penalty applicable to any violation thereof) with respect to termination (or the furnishing of 
notification with respect thereto) of any such franchise or to the nonrenewal (or the furnishing of notification with respect thereto) 
of any such franchise relationship unless such provision of such law or regulation is the same as the applicable provision of this 
subchapter."
1241,15, U.S.C. § 2806(a).
1241,7," .  The Act itself states: HN4[
] Nothing in this subchapter authorizes any transfer or assignment of any franchise or prohibits any transfer or 
assignment of any franchise as authorized by the provisions of such franchise or by any applicable provision of State law which 
permits such transfer or assignment without regard to any provision of the franchise."
1241,15," U.S.C. § 2806(b). In Ted's Tire Service Inc. v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc., 470 F. Supp. 163 (D.Conn.1979), the court stated: HN5[
] The (Petroleum Marketing Practices) Act does not preempt all state laws regulating petroleum franchises; rather it 
merely supplants those provisions which are different from the (Act). The language of the . . . Act prohibiting states from 
enforcing ""any provision of any law"" which is different from the (Act), 15 U.S.C. § 2806(a), manifests a Congressional intent to 
treat state laws which govern petroleum franchises as severable. Id. at 165. "
1242,8," .  See Locafrance U.S. Corporation v. Intermodal Systems Leasing, Inc., 558 F.2d 1113 (2d Cir. 1977); Artvale, Inc. v. Rugby 
Fabrics Corporation, 363 F.2d 1002 (2d Cir. 1966); Dale Hilton, Inc. v. Triangle Publications, Inc., 198 F. Supp. 638 
(S.D.N.Y.1961). "
1248,1," .  Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides in pertinent part: Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several 
states, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal …"
1248,15, U.S.C. § 1. 
1249,2," .  In this case, which involved a principal-agent relationship, the elements the court considered included: whether the agent performs a function on behalf of his principal other than securing an offer from a buyer for the principal's 
product; the degree to which the agent is authorized to exercise his discretion concerning the price and terms under which the 
principal's product is to be sold; and finally whether use of the agent constitutes a separate step in the vertical distribution of the 
principal's product. Id. at 1031 n. 5. "
1258,1," References in the opinion to ""defendant"" refer only to Stardust. "
1259,2," We note that the trial court entered a specific finding of fact that Ignatovich and Perry, his attorney, ""were unreliable witnesses 
and their testimony was completely ignored."""
1259,3," HN2[
] ORS 646.725 provides as follows: ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce is declared to 
be illegal."""
1259,4," HN3[
] Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act (15 USC § 1) provides in pertinent part: ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the 
several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal: * * *."" HN4[
] "
1262,5," HN11[
] The California Franchise Investment Law provides, in pertinent part, the following: ""§ 31110.  Registration of offer; necessity "
1263,," ""On and after April 15, 1971, it shall be unlawful for any person to offer or sell any franchise in this state unless the offer of 
the franchise has been registered under this part or exempted under Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 31100) of this 
part."" Plaintiff argues that the franchise in question is exempted under the following provision: ""§ 31100.  Rule of commissioner ""There shall be exempted from the provisions of Section 31100 any other transaction which the commissioner by rule 
exempts as not being comprehended within the purposes of this law and the registration of which he finds is not necessary 
or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors."" Plaintiff cites a rule of the California Corporation Commissioner that exempts out-of-state sales.  We, however, do not need to 
decide whether the franchise offer is exempted because, as we hold later in the text, the defendant's reliance on the defense of 
illegality is misplaced and incorrect."
1263,6," The contract provided the following: ""Each party agrees that this agreement does not constitute the sale of a franchise prohibited by California, Oregon, or 
Federal law.  Each party further agrees [sic] that he understands the consequences of the franchise laws and has received 
all the information required by those laws even if they were applicable [sic] to this agreement.  Each party specifically 
waives any and all rights available to him or it under those laws."" (Emphasis added.)"
1263,7," Because we conclude that plaintiff did not violate Oregon and federal antitrust laws and that the franchise contract is not 
illegal, we conclude that there is no merit to defendant's defense of unclean hands. "
1264,8," ORS 20.096 was amended in 1979, and ORS 20.096(3) became ORS 20.096(5).  Or Laws 1979, ch 735, § 1.  The definition 
of ""prevailing party,"" however, is unchanged. "
1265,9," California Civil Code § 1717 reads as follows: 'In any action on a contract, where such contract specifically provides that attorney's fees and costs, which are incurred to 
enforce the provisions of such contract, shall be awarded to one of the parties, the prevailing party, whether he is the party 
specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees in addition to costs and necessary 
disbursements. ""Attorney's fees provided for by this section shall not be subject to waiver by the parties to any contract which is entered 
into after the effective date of this section.  Any provision in any such contract which provides for a waiver of attorney's fees 
is void. ""As used in this section, 'prevailing party' means the party in whose favor final judgment is rendered."" "
1271,1," .  At the end of Northeastern's case, both on liability and damages, defendants moved for a directed verdict.  Defendants 
renewed their motion at the close of all evidence at both trials.  These motions were denied by the Court and all issues were 
permitted to go to the jury.  Though expressing doubt about the strength of some of Northeastern's claims, the Court recognized 
that it is normally ""in the best interests of efficient judicial administration for the trial judge to refrain from considering a motion for 
a directed verdict in favor of deciding a motion for judgment n.o.v."" Mattivi v. South African Marine Corp., 618 F.2d 163, 166 
n.2 (2d Cir. 1980)."
1271,2," .  This case was transferred to the undersigned on August 1, 1979 solely for the purpose of pretrial and trial.  Prior to that date, 
the case was assigned to the Hon. T.F. Gilroy Daly."
1271,3," .  The motion was granted with respect to Count Six of the Complaint which asserted a claim under the Connecticut Antitrust 
Act, Conn.Gen.Stat. §§ 35-24 et seq. "
1272,4," .  The Court's decision to adhere to Judge Daly's ruling is based upon its own independent assessment of the various legal 
issues and not on a rote application of res judicata or the law of the case doctrine."
1272,5, .  Formerly the Public Utilities Control Authority.
1272,6," .  One aspect not considered by Judge Daly at any length was the legislative and administrative history of the Communications 
Act.  To the extent that it bears on the instant analysis, it plainly reinforces the decision reached by Judge Daly.  See, e.g., 
Essential Communications Sys., Inc. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 610 F.2d 1114, 1117-21 (3d Cir. 1979); Litton Sys., Inc. v. 
American Tel. & Tel. Co., 487 F. Supp. 942, 947-50 (S.D.N.Y.1980). "
1273,7," .  The basis for defendants' oft-repeated assertion that the FCC ""approved"" the tariff revision is difficult to discern.  The FCC in 
its Foreign Attachment ruling plainly stated that ""we will permit the tariff revisions to become effective as scheduled with the 
understanding that in doing so we are not giving any specific approval to the revised tariffs."" 15 F.C.C.2d at 610. In denying 
reconsideration of the ruling, the FCC further stated that ""paragraph 27 of our decision is clear in its statement that ""our action is 
not to be construed as approval thereof and these tariffs are subject to such further action as the Commission may wish to take 
with respect thereto.' "" 18 F.C.C.2d at 874."
1273,8," .  This result finds strong support in a series of recent decisions.  See, e.g., Essential Communications Sys., Inc. v. American 
Tel. & Tel. Co., supra ; Litton Sys., Inc. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., supra ; Sound, Inc. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 1979-2 
Trade Cas. P 62,978 (D.Iowa 1979); Jarvis, Inc. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 481 F. Supp. 120 (D.D.C.1978). "
1274,9," .  This formulation of the test for determining state action immunity for private parties is somewhat dissimilar from that set forth 
by Judge Daly.  The principal difference is that this Court finds that a necessary element of state action immunity in these 
circumstances is that the state compel the anticompetitive act.  Judge Daly, relying on Mobilfone of Northeastern Pa., Inc. v. 
Commonwealth Tel. Co., 571 F.2d 141, 144 (3d Cir. 1978), apparently found no such requirement. The fact that courts have differed in considering the appropriate test for determining state action immunity is hardly surprising.  
The Supreme Court's recent decisions in this area-Goldfarb, Cantor, Bates, and Lafayette -are confusing at best.  ""The . . .  
issue raised by this . . .  quartet of decisions is whether anyone can make sense of what the Supreme Court is letting us know 
about the state action doctrine."" M. Handler, Antitrust-1978, 78 Colum.L.Rev. 1363, 1376 (1978). "
1275,10," .  Defendants argue that market share statistics in the context of a regulated utility which had 100% of the market in 1968 are 
meaningless in determining whether SNET possessed monopoly power. On the contrary, market structure in the relevant 
market, though not an absolute talisman, is an indicia of monopoly power. United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, 148 F.2d 
416 (2d Cir. 1945). It is uncontroverted that more than ten years after the Carterfone decision, SNET still maintains over 90% of 
the relevant market, whether measured by number of systems or by revenue.  The jury could properly consider these figures on 
the question of monopoly power. "
1276,," Defendants' argument is further undercut by the charge to the jury which stated that ""if a company has an increasing share of 
the revenue of the relevant market from one year to the next over a period of years, that has been seen as evidence of 
monopoly power, while a declining share has been seen as evidence of the lack of monopoly power. In this connection, you may 
consider that SNET in our situation started with 100% of the market share as of 1968."" "
1277,11," .  That is, the additional costs that SNET would incur by introducing Dimension, but which are not attributable to the product 
itself. "
1278,12," .  The fact that this Court has determined that SNET's KTS rates were not predatory does not undermine the jury's response to 
Question 3(a).  It is clear from the evidence that the KTS rates did not form the basis for the jury's verdict in Question 3(a), and 
the Court is ""fairly convinced that the jury proceeded on the only sound ground(s)."" Morrissey v. National Maritime Union, 544 
F.2d 19, 27 (2d Cir. 1976). "
1279,13," .  Northeastern also contended that there were problems concerning supply and service of PCAs; however, those issues did 
not go to the jury. "
1280,14," .  Although defendants do not raise the issue, the Court finds that the uncontroverted evidence of SNET's 95% plus share of 
the interconnect market is sufficient to establish ""dangerous probability of success."" Ernest W. Hahn, Inc. v. Codding, 615 F.2d 
830, 846 (9th Cir. 1980). "
1281,15," .  Defendants argue that any injury or damage caused by the coupler design was not antitrust injury.  However, this is one of 
the clearest examples of conduct which had ""the effect of significantly impairing the ability of rivals to compete."" Areeda & 
Turner, Antitrust Law P 626, at 80 (1978).  The use of an overdesigned and overly expensive PCA in the small key market "
1282,," effectively foreclosed competition, since in that market, the monthly charge for the PCA comprised a significant portion of the 
overall cost of small key terminal equipment."
1282,16," .  The figures were as follows: PBXs-211; KTS (3 lines & up)-468; small KTS-305.  With respect to the small key calculation, 
the actual sales plus the projected sales were less than Northeastern's total estimated market share because of preregistration 
sales losses due to the PCA requirement which was not an issue in this suit."
1282,17," .  Again, the breakdown is as follows: PBXs-$ 15,192,000; KTS (3 lines & up)-$ 3,774,000; small KTS-$ 457,500."
1282,18," .  This figure was based on a projected number of total lost stations multiplied by $ 54 per station, an estimated figure as to the 
amount of revenue each lost station would provide on a yearly basis. "
1283,19," .  The fact that this Court has determined that SNET's KTS rates were not predatory does not change this result.  As is clear 
from the evidence, a lion's share, if not all of the damage suffered by Northeastern in the KTS market was attributable to the two-
tier payment option and the design of the coupler."
1283,20," .  The term ""speech"" is slightly misleading.  The speech was a technical presentation delivered at a Bell System Presidents' 
Conference. "
1284,21," .  The incremental profit rate was calculated by first computing the increase in sales ($ 1,345,776) and the increase in income 
($ 255,419) from 1978 to 1979 and then dividing the sales figure into the income figure. "
1288,22," .  This adjustment is in line with what other district courts in the circuit have awarded.  See, e.g., Michelman v. Clark-Schwebel 
Fiber Glass Corp., 1975-2 Trade Cas. P 60,551 (S.D.N.Y.1975) (approximately 14% increase), appeal dismissed as moot, 534 
F.2d 1036 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 885, 97 S. Ct. 236, 50 L. Ed. 2d 166 (1976); FLM Collision Parts, Inc. v. Ford Motor 
Co., supra (approximately 56% increase).  The courts in this circuit have permitted a doubling of the lodestar only in class 
actions.  See City of New York v. Darling-Delaware, 440 F. Supp. 1132 (S.D.N.Y.1977); In re Master Key Antitrust Litigation, 
1978-1 Trade Cas. P 61,887 (D.Conn.1977). The only district court that more than doubled the lodestar was reversed in Grinnell 
II.  Cf.  Seigal v. Merrick, 619 F.2d 160 (2d Cir. 1980). In view of the case law that has developed in this circuit, Northeastern's request for a seven-fold adjustment to the lodestar is 
unrealistic. "
1293,1," Two different Dealer Franchise Agreements were actually utilized during this period.  Any differences between the two 
versions, however, are not relevant here and the two forms will be treated hereinafter as one.  See post at 209."
1293,2," The Lawn King service mark was registered for a term of twenty years with the United States Patent Office on January 23, 
1973 (Principal Register No. 951,517).  The registration form notes that this service mark was first used by Lawn King in 
September 1970."
1293,3," Thus, every distributor was also a dealer. "
1294,4," This section provides that ""[e]very contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy in restraint of trade or 
commerce, in this State, shall be unlawful."" N.J.S.A. 56:9-3. "
1299,5," A finding of such ""redeeming virtues"" is ""implicit in every decision sustaining vertical restrictions under the rule of reason."" 
Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 54, 97 S.Ct. 2549, 2560, 53 L.Ed.2d 568, 583 (1977). "
1314,1," Although the defendant contends that genuine factual issues do exist, aside from the bald assertion that the summary judgment 
standard is not met, the defendant fails to specify any such controversy, nor do we find any to be revealed by the pleadings or 
affidavits of the parties. In evaluating the propriety of a summary judgment, we are confined to an examination of the pleadings and affidavits of the 
parties to determine whether (1) there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and (2) the moving party is entitled to 
judgment as a matter of law.  Practice Book, 1978, § 384.  As we do not find any issue of material fact to be in dispute, the sole 
issue is whether the summary judgment is correct as a matter of law."
1314,2," Paragraphs 19 and 20 of the ""Declaration of Covenants and Restrictions"" read as follows: ""19. If the Grantee decides to sell said above described premises through any other person, agent or real estate broker to whom 
a commission would be payable, he hereby gives exclusive sales right to James F. Hartnett, or such person, agent or broker as 
he may designate, said listing to be at the lowest price the Grantee is willing to accept, and for a period of three (3) months.  
When decision to sell is made Grantee hereby agrees to list in writing the lowest price he is willing to accept. ""20. If the Grantee decides to lease through any other person, agent or real estate broker to whom a commission would be 
payable, he hereby gives exclusive leasing right to the Grantor, or such other person, agent or broker as he may designate, the 
said listing to be at the lowest price the Grantee is willing to accept and for a period of three (3) months.  In the event of such 
lease the amount of said commission shall not exceed 10%.  When decision to lease is made Grantee hereby agrees to list in 
writing the lowest price he is willing to accept."" "
1315,3," The validity of the restrictive covenants as to subsequent grantees was not raised in the pleadings, litigated or considered at 
trial and therefore we express no opinion as to this issue.  Authorities discussing the question whether similar covenants run with 
the land or are personal indicate that the covenant here found invalid on antitrust grounds may be susceptible to attack premised 
upon traditional rules of property law.  See Restatement, 5 Property § 537; Pulver v. Mascolo, 155 Conn. 644, 237 A.2d 97; 
Patrone v. Falcone, 345 Mass. 659, 189 N.E.2d 228."
1315,4," The defendant also interposes a claim of immunity from the Connecticut Anti-Trust Act under the exception provided in General 
Statutes § 35-31b.  This claim, while assigned as error, was not addressed in the defendant's brief or at oral argument and is 
therefore considered abandoned.  Gluck v. Gluck, 181 Conn. 225, 435 A.2d 35; Healy v. White, 173 Conn. 438, 441, 378 A.2d 
540; Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. § 327.  Nor does the defendant make any claim that the sale of interests in land does not fall 
within the statutory language of General Statutes § 35-29. "
1316,5," Comparison of § 3 of the Clayton Antitrust Act; 15 U.S.C. § 14; printed below, to General Statutes § 35-29 highlights the 
similarity of their provisions. ""It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, to lease or make a sale or contract 
for sale of goods, wares, merchandise, machinery, supplies, or other commodities, whether patented or unpatented, for use, 
consumption, or resale within the United States or any Territory thereof or the District of Columbia or any insular possession or 
other place under the jurisdiction of the United States, or fix a price charged therefor, or discount from, or rebate upon, such 
price, on the condition, agreement, or understanding that the lessee or purchaser thereof shall not use or deal in the goods, 
wares, merchandise, machinery, supplies, or other commodities of a competitor or competitors of the lessor or seller, where the 
effect of such lease, sale, or contract for sale or such condition, agreement, or understanding may be to substantially lessen 
competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce."""
1316,6," Under federal law, a complaint concerning a tying arrangement involving services can only be brought under the Sherman act 
and its two-pronged per se test because the federal Clayton act, unlike its Connecticut counterpart, is applicable only to 
commodities. Robbins Flooring, Inc. v. Federal Floors, Inc., 445 F. Sup. 4, 10 (E.D. Penn.).  The Clayton act test requires 
that only one of the two requirements be met.  The justification for the lesser standard is that under § 3 of the Clayton act there 
need not be the actuality of an unreasonable restraint or monopoly which the Sherman act requires, but merely the probability 
that the activity complained of ""may substantially lessen commerce or tend to create a monopoly."" Mytinger & Casselberry, Inc. 
v. F.T.C., 301 F.2d 534, 535 (D.C. Cir.); Robbins Flooring, Inc. v. Federal Floors, Inc., supra, 10, 11. "
1317,7," The defendant's argument that the limited duration of the exclusive sales and leasing rights (three months) as well as the 
competitive commission rate (6 percent) saves the tying agreement is unsupported by the case law.  A tying agreement is not 
valid even if the price charged and the terms offered are the same as those offered by competitors. The United States Supreme 
Court has condemned agreements even where the tie was removed if a competitor offered a better price.  International Salt Co. 
v. United States, 332 U.S. 392, 397, 68 S. Ct. 12, 92 L. Ed. 20. A tying arrangement which forces competitors to undercut the 
market while the tie holder merely meets competition is impermissible.  Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 12, 
78 S. Ct. 514, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545. "
1318,8," Because our decision on the tying issue is dispositive of this appeal, no opinion is expressed on the boycott claim. "
1322,1," .  This is the description of the Act as set forth by Justice Brennan in his dissenting opinion in Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, (1977) 
431 U.S. 720, 756, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 2080, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707.

1324,11," .  The exact language of the Report is as follows: ""Section 4F promotes parens patriae actions as a major aspect of antitrust enforcement by encouraging Federal-State 
cooperation. The section provides that whenever the United States has brought suit in its proprietary capacity under § 4A of the 
Clayton Act, and the U.S. Attorney General believes that the same antitrust violation may have given rise to potential parens 
patriae claims, he shall notify the appropriate State attorneys general.  Whenever a State attorney general so requests, in order 
to evaluate the notice from the U.S. Attorney General or in order to bring a parens patriae action, section 4F(b) requires the U.S. "
1325,," Attorney General to make the Justice Department's investigative files available to the State attorneys general ""to the extent 
permitted by law.' This means that the files are to be made available except where specifically prohibited. ""Section 4F(b) reflects the committee's desire that the Federal Government cooperate fully with State antitrust enforcers. ""The benefits of increases in Federal-State cooperation and coordination of antitrust enforcement are obvious, and are achieved 
in H.R.8532 without the expenditure of additional Federal funds."" H.R.No.94-499, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 17 (1975), reprinted in 1976 U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News, at pp. 2586-87. It is true this statement was in a Report on an earlier version of the Act.  But the only distinctions between the section 4F(b) 
discussed in House Report No. 94-499, and the present law are: (1) under the earlier version access was granted to the United 
States Attorney General's files (other than to evaluate notice) only for purposes of bringing an action under 4C, 15 U.S.C. § 15c 
(1976) (the parens patriae damage provision): the enacted version requires access for purposes of ""bringing any action under 
this (the Clayton) Act"" (emphasis added) and (2) under the earlier version the ""usage clause"" was conjunctive: ""To assist a State 
attorney general in evaluating the notice and in bringing any action . . ."" (emphasis added); this dual foundation for disclosure of 
investigative and other materials was changed in the enacted section by substituting ""or"" for ""and."""

its deliberations, and to prevent persons subject to indictment or their friends from importuning the grand jurors; (3) to prevent 
subornation or perjury or tampering with the witnesses who may testify before grand jury and later appear at the trial of those 
indicted by it; (4) to encourage free and untrammeled disclosures by persons who have information with respect to the 
commission of crimes; (5) to protect innocent accused who is exonerated from disclosure of the fact that he has been under 
investigation, and from the expense of standing trial where there was no probability of guilt."" This statement of the basis for grand jury secrecy was cited with approval in Douglas Oil Co., 441 U.S. at 219, n. 10, 99 S. Ct. at

require it."" In U. S. Industries v. United States District Court, 345 F.2d at 21, the court put it: ""In other words, if the reasons for maintaining secrecy do not apply at all in a given situation, or apply to only an insignificant 
degree, the party seeking disclosure should not be required to demonstrate a large compelling need."" "
1327,21," .  There is some similarity here with the power given by Rule 6(e) to disclose grand jury materials ""to the attorneys for the 
government for use in the performance of their duties."" In such a case, there is no need for the attorney to show a ""particularized 
need"" as a necessary predicate for disclosure of grand jury materials.  In re December 1974 Term Grand Jury Investigation,

N.E.2d 1230 (Mass. 1979), have conclusively resolved issues of state law relevant to this case."
1333,6," .  With respect to the antitrust theory, the parties have asked at this point only for a ruling as to the availability of a state 
exemption defense under Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 63 S. Ct. 307, 87 L. Ed. 315 (1942). "

regulation cannot invidiously discriminate in violation of equal protection). "
1335,8," .  The Arno court noted that a hearing is available to test whether a filed objection meets the statutory criteria i. e., whether the 
objector is a church or school actually located within 500 feet of the applicant's premises and whether the objection was 
authorized by the objector's governing body. See Arno, supra, 384 N.E.2d at 1228. Indeed, the Church's first objection to 
Grendel's application was rejected by the CLC for failure to meet the statutory element of due authorization. Arno makes clear, however, that a church or school may object without having to submit to a hearing at which its reasons or 
motives are examined or explained. Id. Simply put, under § 16C a church or school may exercise its discretion to object for good 
reason, bad reason, or no reason at all."
1335,9," .  Thus, certification of the issue of legislative intent to the Supreme Judicial Court, as suggested by the Commonwealth, would 
be pointless, since such a determination would have no bearing on the effect of the statute's actual operation. "
1336,10," .  Plaintiff has also assailed § 16C as violative of due process because of the lack of a hearing to probe the standards and 
motives governing § 16C entities' exercise of their veto powers. In view of this court's decision concerning plaintiff's primary due 
process claim, it is unnecessary to reach this issue. To the extent that § 16C is invalid because it permits private parties to use public power for invalid purposes, those aspects of § 
16C are better discussed in connection with particular allegations made by Grendel's, e.g., its Establishment Clause and 
antitrust claims, infra. "
1337,11," .  Zoning regulations also present the potential for bargaining and discretion, and churches may, of course, exercise such 
powers along with other property owners subject to such regulations. In zoning, however, the breadth of regulation negates any 
finding that the regulation has a primary effect of advancing religion. Here, because § 16C defines a narrow class of "
1338,," beneficiaries and because churches and their related schools compose such a large part of the protected class, the same 
inference of neutrality cannot be drawn. Likewise, a licensing structure in which the local licensing board could consider a church's objection, but would retain the right to 
make an independent determination, is distinguishable from this case."
1338,12," .  The defendants have cited three lower state court opinions which they claim as precedent upholding the validity of § 16C. 
The first, Appeal of Rusch, 32 Pa.Cmwlth. 578, 379 A.2d 1375 (1977), is inapplicable because it involved the exercise of a 
licensing board's discretion in rejecting an application for a license near a church. Moreover, no constitutional challenge was 
either advanced, considered, or decided in Rusch. The second, Horne v. Hernando County, 297 So.2d 606 (Fla.App.1974), is 
distinguishable because it upheld a county ordinance flatly banning licenses within 1500 feet of a church or school. The third case cited, Wiles v. Michigan Liquor Control Comm'n, 59 Mich.App. 321, 229 N.W.2d 434 (1975), did reject an 
Establishment Clause attack on a statute virtually identical to § 16C. But it is clear from the opinion in Wiles that the court was 
not presented with the specific due process and Establishment Clause arguments advanced here. Indeed, Wiles contains only a 
short paragraph concluding that the licensing statute did not have the primary effect of advancing religion. Given its conclusory 
nature, Wiles is hardly persuasive authority on the issues before this court."
1338,13," .  As has been noted, supra, however, that possibility does provide grounds for due process and Establishment Clause 
challenges. "
1339,14," .  U.S.Const., art. VI."
1339,15," .  For example, church members who own liquor establishments or restaurants might exploit their churches' § 16C veto power 
to disadvantage a competitor seeking to obtain a license. At this stage of the case, the court expresses no opinion as to the 
validity of such a theory and no findings as to the facts surrounding Grendel's application. "

of J. Ray McDermott & Co., Inc.  At all times relevant to the complaint Charles Graves was president and chairman of the board 
of McDermott; James Cunningham was executive vice-president and chief administrator of McDermott; and Robert Richie was 
president of Oceanic and a director of McDermott. Brown & Root, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Halliburton Co.  At all times relevant to the complaint Hugh Gordon was

brought within four years of the accrual of the cause of action.  The RICO statute does not specify a limitations period, and 
therefore the analogous one-year period of Louisiana Civil Code Article 3536 applies.  This one-year period also applies to the 
state antitrust claims.  Loew's, Inc. v. Don George, Inc., 237 La. 132, 110 So.2d 553 (1959). The state law claims for rescission

1348,5," .  § 44 of the complaint provides in relevant part: At the time of negotiations leading to the sale agreement, as well as prior and subsequent thereto, the defendants, acting in 
accordance with and in furtherance of the conspiracy alleged herein, fraudulently concealed from plaintiffs the existence of the 
causes of action stated in this Complaint, through acts and omissions including but not limited to the following: (b) Submitting prearranged losing bids by the company that had agreed not to receive the award, in order to give the illusion of 
competition among the corporate defendants; (c) Maintaining agreed-upon ratios of major equipment spreads, and positioning equipment in particular localities throughout the 
world, so as to give the false impression that excessive bids on particular projects were the result of equipment availability rather 
than of the unlawful conspiracy; "
1349,," (d) Falsifying, destroying and concealing from accountants, auditors, independent directors and attorneys, records of the 
corporate defendants that would have revealed the existence of the unlawful conspiracies; (e) Making payments of cash and other things of value to employees of customers, and to employees and former employees of 
the defendants, in order to prevent such employees from revealing to others their knowledge of the unlawful activities of the 
defendants in this Complaint; P 25 of the complaint states in relevant part, . . .  Despite the exercise of due diligence, plaintiffs were unaware of and did not discover the existence of causes of action set 
forth in this Complaint until on or about December 14, 1978. P 46 essentially repeats that contention. Plaintiffs exercised all due diligence in informing themselves of facts that might give rise to claims against the defendants but 
were prevented by the defendants' fraudulent concealment from learning of the existence of the causes of action stated in this 
Complaint until the return of the criminal indictment on December 14, 1978, described in paragraph 24 above. "
1350,6," .  Brown & Root, not being a party to either release, makes no claim thereunder."

1350,8," .  In addition to evidence of fraudulent concealment Ingram also submitted evidence regarding statements made by McDermott 
representatives in 1971 and 1973 concerning ""stacked costs,"" a document entitled ""Summary of Current Status with Ingram"" 
which was used by McDermott during the 1973 negotiations, and certain statements made by Roger Wilson, then president of 
McDermott, and Jerrold Van Cise, a McDermott attorney, in 1971."
1350,9, .  The other two indictments which Ingram cited are

At P 23(c)-(e) of the McDermott and Brown & Root had conspired to (c) (designate) the low bidder on marine construction projects made subject to the aforesaid conspiracy; (d) (exchange) information concerning bid amounts or bid ranges on marine construction projects made subject to the aforesaid 
conspiracy; "
1351,," (e) (submit) intentionally high, or complimentary (sic), bids on marine construction projects on which one of the defendants or co-
conspirators had been designated as the low bidder."
1351,11," .  Paragraphs 6 and 7 of the G. Glen Martin affidavit state, During the time I was with Ingram I was aware that in the offshore contracting industry, generally, the location of major 
equipment owned by McDermott, Brown & Root, and Ingram, such as derrick barges, is published periodically in various industry 
journals.  Also, I and other responsible company officers and employees made it a practice to keep abreast of where Ingram's 
competitors had positioned their equipment.  Moreover, it is common knowledge in the industry that the personnel of the major 
companies kept abreast of the location of one another's equipment.  My responsibilities with Ingram required that I continue to 
keep abreast of the location of equipment in the industry until the time of the sale.  I had the impression that bids of McDermott 
and Brown & Root were based on the location of their equipment, and did not suspect an agreement between them to divide the 
market for marine contracting services.  Had McDermott and Brown & Root not positioned their equipment to give the impression 
that the pattern of bidding was explained by equipment location, I and anyone else familiar with the industry might well have 
been able to detect indications of collusion in the pattern of bidding. During the time prior to the Purchase and Subcontract Agreements it appeared to me that McDermott and Brown & Root were 
submitting competitive bids against each other.  I and other Ingram personnel generally undertook to ascertain who in the 
industry was submitting bids on major jobs, and I had knowledge of such bids, and certain terms and conditions of such bids. It 
was common knowledge among the companies in the industry that such information was generally learned by personnel for the 
various companies.  Had McDermott and Brown & Root not purported to be bidding against each other on most major projects, 
we would have known this, and it would have been obvious to us and anyone in the industry that there was collusion between 
the two.  Furthermore, if they had not been bidding against each other on certain projects, but always bidding against Ingram, it 
would have indicated that their collusion was aimed at driving Ingram out of the business.  After the Purchase and Subcontract 
Agreements, McDermott and Brown & Root did not dispel the appearance that they were competing against each other, and my 
perception of their purported competition remained unchanged up through and including the date of execution of the Settlement 
Agreement and Releases in 1973. "
1352,12," .  The cases to this effect include, inter alia, Three Rivers Motors Co. v. Ford Motor Co., 522 F.2d 885 (3rd Cir. 1975); Virginia 
Impression Products Co. v. SCM Corp., 448 F.2d 262 (4th Cir. 1971); Aladdin Oil Co. v. Texaco, Inc., 603 F.2d 1107 (5th Cir. 
1979); Schott Enterprises v. Pepsico, Inc., 520 F.2d 1298 (6th Cir. 1975); Richard's Lumber & Supply Co. v. United States 
Gypsum Co., 545 F.2d 18 (7th Cir. 1976); Suckow Borax Mines Consolidated, Inc. v. Borax Consolidated, Ltd., 185 F.2d 196 
(9th Cir. 1950); Duffy Theatres, Inc. v. Griffith Consolidated Theatres, Inc., 208 F.2d 316 (10th Cir. 1953)."
1352,13," .  McDermott also argues that there is no nexus between the fraudulent concealment and the release since the object of the 
conspiracy, Ingram's sale of asserts, was achieved in 1971.  This argument misses the point, for Ingram does not contend here 
that the releases were obtained as ""part and parcel"" of the conspiracy. Rather, the issue is whether active concealment of the 
causes of action during the period when the releases were negotiated constitutes fraud which renders the releases voidable. "
1353,14," .  These same policy considerations apply to the RICO claim, 18 U.S.C. § 1961 et seq., for which Congress took the antitrust 
laws as a model.  The ABA actually suggested the private right of action contained in § 1964(c), which is said was ""based upon 
the concept of § 4 of the Clayton Act."" Measures Relating to the Control of Organized Crime in the United States: Hearings 
before Subcommittee No. 5 in the House Committee on the Judiciary, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., 543-44 (1970) (Statement of 
Edward L. Wright, president-elect of the ABA).  Moreover, in introducing S. 1861, the predecessor of § 1964, Senator McClellan 
described the civil enforcement provisions as having ""ample precedent in the antitrust laws."" 115 Cong.Rec. 9567 (1969). "
1354,15," .  Several months after the motion for summary judgment was decided, Ingram amended its complaint to allege three more 
pendent causes of action. The releases are equally applicable to all of these state law claims, and while McDermott's motion to 
reconsider formally addresses only Count 4, it is in fact addressed to Counts 5 through 7 as well."
1354,16," .  As a third alternative McDermott contends that I should not exercise pendent party jurisdiction over the state law claims 
against it.  In view of my decision to vacate the order of March 19, 1980 and deny McDermott summary judgment on the federal 
claims, this pendent jurisdiction argument is moot. "
1356,17," .  McDermott has requested that, should I rule against it on the motions to reconsider, I certify my ruling to the Fifth Circuit 
Court of Appeals pursuant to HN15[
]  28 U.S.C. § 1292(b), which provides When a district judge, in making in a civil action an order not otherwise appealable under this section, shall be of the opinion that 
such order involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an 
immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation, he shall so state in writing in "
1357,," such order.  The Court of Appeals may thereupon, in its discretion, permit an appeal to be taken from such order, if application is 
made to it within ten days after the entry of the order: Provided, however, That application for an appeal hereunder shall not stay 
proceedings in the district court unless the district court or the Court of Appeals or a judge thereof shall so order. There is no doubt that my ruling here involves a controlling question of law, for if the releases are valid and enforceable against 
the claims brought by plaintiffs, McDermott has an absolute defense.  Moreover, there is substantial ground for difference of 
opinion as to the correctness of my ruling today.  However, in view of a probable delay of at least 18 to 20 months before a 
decision from the Fifth Circuit upon an appeal from this ruling, I am unable to conclude that an immediate appeal would advance 
the ultimate termination of this litigation.  Even given the large amount of discovery which this case will require, trial should be 
completed before the Fifth Circuit is able to act.  Furthermore, should the Court of Appeals determine my ruling here to be 
wrong, either wholly or in part, no retrial would be required.  Therefore I decline to certify my decision on the motions to 
reconsider for interlocutory appeal."
1357,18," .  See n. 5, supra. "
1361,1," .  The promotional allowances and introductory discounts complained of apparently involved only Ragu sauces in existence prior 
to the introduction of Ragu Extra Thick and Zesty. "
1364,2," .  The minimum standard was almost certainly not met in Hiland Dairy, Inc. v. Kroger Co., 402 F.2d 968 (8th Cir. 1968), cert. 
denied, 395 U.S. 961, 89 S. Ct. 2096, 23 L. Ed. 2d 748 (1969), where the court dismissed a complaint that alleged that Kroger, a 
grocery store chain controlling 8 per cent of the grocery market, was attempting to monopolize the sale of milk to groceries by 
building a dairy processing plant capable of supplying 20 per cent of that market. The court stated in categorical terms that a 20 
per cent market share would not be sufficient to allow a firm to control prices or exclude competition."
1364,3," .  The fact that dangerous probability of success is considered a separate element does not necessarily mean that the plaintiff 
must show market power. The probability of success may be established by direct proof, or it may be inferred from predatory 
conduct and specific intent to control prices or exclude competition.  Janich Bros., Inc. v. American Distilling Co., 570 F.2d 848, 
853 (9th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 829, 99 S. Ct. 103, 58 L. Ed. 2d 122 (1978). "
1366,4," .  As might be the case, for example, if Ragu demonstrates that it lacked market power."
1366,5," .  Ragu contended at oral argument that Chesebrough-Pond's and Ragu are incapable of combining and conspiring with each 
other within the meaning of section 1. In general, affiliated corporations cannot conspire with each other where they function as a 
single economic unit.  Las Vegas Sun, Inc. v. Summa Corp., 610 F.2d 614, 617-18 (9th Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 447 U.S. 906, 
100 S. Ct. 2988, 64 L. Ed. 2d 855 (1980); Harvey v. Fearless Farris Wholesale, Inc., 589 F.2d 451, 455-58 (9th Cir. 1979); 
Mutual Fund Investors, Inc. v. Putnam Management Co., 553 F.2d 620, 625-26 (9th Cir. 1977); Knutson v. Daily Review, Inc., 
548 F.2d 795, 801-02 (9th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 433 U.S. 910, 97 S. Ct. 2977, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1094 (1977). Resolution of the 
question hinges on the particular facts involved, such as unity of control and the existence of real or apparent competition 
between the related corporations. Such factual questions are not suited to resolution on the face of the complaint. In the event this issue becomes material in the proceedings on remand, we note that a finding of incapacity to combine and 
conspire under section 1 would mandate the same result with regard to the section 2 conspiracy to monopolize claim."
1366,6," .  Hunt argues that the trial court improperly judged the Sherman Act claim based on acts of price discrimination by the same 
standards applicable to its Robinson-Patman Act claim. We need not decide whether a claim based on price discrimination is 
defined precisely the same under both the Sherman Act and the Robinson-Patman Act, see Janich Bros., Inc. v. American 
Distilling Co., 570 F.2d 848, 855 (9th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 829, 99 S. Ct. 103, 58 L. Ed. 2d 122 (1978), because 
Hunt failed to raise a material question of fact about the existence of discrimination of any sort. "
1367,7," .  Rule 56(f) provides: HN6[
] When Affidavits are Unavailable. Should it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing the motion that he cannot for 
reasons stated present by affidavit facts essential to justify his opposition, the court may refuse the application for judgment or 
may order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or depositions to be taken or discovery to be had or may make such 
other order as is just."
1367,8," .  Hunt argues that although introductory discounts are ""normally"" used to obtain initial penetration of a geographical area for a 
new product, Ragu discounted an established product to grocers who were not yet purchasing it. Ragu offers a somewhat 
different view of its discounting practices. According to Kiernan's affidavit, grocers purchasing a particular product for the first 
time were given a one-time discount. In any event, it is irrelevant whether Ragu's introductory discount plan followed the trade 
norm."
1367,9," .  Kiernan stated in his initial affidavit that ""Ragu since at least 1973 has offered in all markets a standard introductory discount 
to every new purchaser . . . ."" and attached a number of authorizing bulletins that show all of the discounts that were offered in 
the test markets. He stated that each introductory discount was evidenced by an authorizing bulletin, which was prepared to 
instruct Ragu's accounting personnel and billing computer of the details of the sale. Hunt responded with the unsubstantiated 
statement in its Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment that although the 
introductory discounts may have been offered in all markets, they nevertheless were not offered simultaneously in all markets. 
Kiernan responded in his second affidavit that the discounts were available to ""every new purchaser wherever located,"" and he 
attached a sample of 20 out of 150 discount bulletins relating to discounts offered outside the test markets. Hunt claims in its 
brief that the bulletins show that the discounts were discontinuous and not simultaneously available in all cities but offers nothing 
to contradict Kiernan's statements. According to Kiernan's uncontroverted statement, each discount was evidenced by a 
separate bulletin. In other words, the bulletins necessarily reflect that introductory discounts were offered in different locations 
during different time periods, because the bulletins were prepared for individual purchasers. "
1379,1," The Court finds unpersuasive the plaintiff's assertion that sufficient trustworthiness is imparted herein by the mere fact that the 
former Muny Light customers have previously ""stood in a business relationship"" with the MELP enterprise.  The Court observes 
in this regard that the City is apparently unable to advance any legal authority which lends support to this rather expansive 
construction of Rule 803(6).  The Court would observe additionally that the ""business relationship"" which the plaintiff suggests 
assures reliability is one which, under the instant circumstances, has apparently deteriorated to such a degree that the 
informant-customer has deemed it in his best interest to sever the relationship and secure electric power service from an 
alternate source.  While one could at least argue that informants who supply information in the course of an existing and 
continuing business relationship with the party offering the ensuing business records act under some discernible ""duty of 
accuracy"", it is difficult to perceive any logical or legal basis for assigning special trustworthiness to statements elicited not in the 
course of an enduring business relationship but rather at a time where, as here, the relationship was in the very process of being 
terminated."
1379,2," The Court does not mean to imply that it necessarily concurs with the City's assertion that the meter reports in issue contain in 
material part ""factual findings resulting from an investigation"" as that term is employed in Rule 803(8).  The Court observes in 
this respect that there is no evidence of ""investigative"" activity on the part of the MELP employees beyond the mere soliciting 
and recording of the customers responses, the substance of which were apparently taken entirely at face value and subjected to 
no further scrutiny or effects directed toward verification.  To say that this rather cursory procedure constituted an ""investigation"" 
for purposes of Rule 803(8) would appear to confer upon the provision an extremely broad scope.  Moreover, it is clear from the 
procedures followed that the accuracy of the meter reports, insofar as they purport to set forth the particular reasons underlying 
customer loss, depend entirely upon the veracity of the customer-informants who, as indicated, proffered their respective 
explanations in the absence of any compulsion of accuracy. "
1380,3," The Sixth Circuit proceeded to hold that while the driver's statement was not within the scope of Rule 803(8), it was 
nevertheless properly introduced pursuant to a separate exception to hearsay rule codified in Rule 801(d)(1)(B).  In the instant 
action, it would not appear that the customers' responses ""meet the test of some other hearsay exception"", Weinstein's 
Evidence, supra, and the City does not contend otherwise. "
1386,1," The Court finds entirely unpersuasive the City's contention that the heretofore adduced testimony of Hauser has already served 
as a predicate for the introduction of the constitutionally protected activity described in Joint Stipulations 226-241.  A review of 
the testimony in question discloses beyond peradventure that Hauser's responses pertained solely to the construction of the 
138KV permanent synchronous interconnection and did not concern the 69KV temporary intertie.  See Transcript at pp. 14,189-
14,192. "
1389,1," The other two defendants have both been dismissed: Illinois Farmers Insurance Co. by order of this court dated March 28, 
1980, and Aetna Casualty and Surety Co. by order dated June 13, 1980. "
1390,2," Plaintiff has no standing to argue that defendants are not fulfilling their obligations under their insurance policies, for it is not a 
party to these contracts.  Moreover, it has been held that HN1[
] insurance companies are entitled to pay only the lowest 
competitive cost, when their policies obligate them to pay the reasonable cost of services.  See, e.g., Gamble v. Allstate 
Insurance Co ., 209 Pa. Super. 330, 333; 228 A. 2d 58, 60 (1967). "
1393,3," The court recognizes that it appears somewhat anomalous that the implementation of a price-fixing scheme by means of 
provider agreements could be illegal under the Sherman Act, while the price fixing agreement itself may be immune from 
scrutiny by virtue of the McCarran-Ferguson Act.  See footnote 4 infra .  This result, however appears to follow from the limited 
exception to McCarran-Ferguson found by the Supreme Court in Group Life ."
1393,4," Even if plaintiff had shown horizontal price fixing agreements in this case, it would seem that the McCarran-Ferguson Act would 
still apply, despite Group Life .  The Supreme Court noted that a primary concern of Congress in passing this legislation ""was 
that cooperative ratemaking efforts be exempt from the antitrust laws."" 440 U.S. at 221. Thus, at least some agreements that 
would otherwise be condemned as price fixing were intended to be immune when engaged in by insurance companies.  
Agreements concerning the level of benefits would appear to fall into the same category as agreements setting rates.  See id. at 
244 (Brennan, J., dissenting).  Such agreements can and should be distinguished from those between insurance companies and 
providers, which the Court found did not constitite the ""business of insurance."" In essence, the cooperation among insurance 
companies alleged in this case merely sets the level of benefits provided to claimants.  Defendants will not pay more than the 
""competitive rate"" for pay more than the ""competitive rate"" for repairs. Even if it could be shown that they have agreed on the 
rate, defendants' conduct would be within the protection of the McCarran-Ferguson Act. Other courts to consider this question have concurred.  In Proctor v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., 561 F. 2d 
262, 267 N.C. Cir. 1977), vacated, 440 U.S. 942 (1979), the D.C. Circuit had no difficulty in finding that horizontal agreements 
similar to those alleged here were within the scope of McCarran-Ferguson.  The court found more difficulty in classifying 
agreements between insurance companies and providers as being the ""business of insurance."" It did so find, and it was 
presumbly this latter finding that was vacated in light of Group Life .  This court regards the Proctor court's conclusion that "
1394,," horizontal agreements are exempt from the antitrust law as unaffected by the Supreme Court decision and still sound.  See 
also Bartholomew v. Virginia Chiropractors Ass'n, 612 F. 2d 812 (4th Cir. 1979); 57 Tex. L. Rev. 1127 infra, at 1183-85."
1394,5," It is unnecessary to consider whether the alleged boycotting practices of defendants are protected by the McCarran-Ferguson 
Act.  That Act does not by its own terms apply to agreements to boycott or acts of boycott. 15 U.S.C.  § 1013; St. Paul Fire & 
Marine Insurance Co. v. Barry, 438 U.S. 531 (1978) (defining ""boycott"" as it has traditionally been understood under the 
Sherman Act). "
1399,1," Mr. Letcher died while the first appeal of this case was pending in this Court. His executors were substituted as plaintiffs.  
Copper Liquor, Inc. v. Adolph Coors Co., 5 Cir. 1975, 506 F.2d 934, 936 n.1, rehearing denied, 509 F.2d 758."
1399,2," In the first trial the district court trebled the jury's $ 101,011 damage award to $ 303,033 and awarded $ 75,000 attorneys' fees. "
1400,3," Letcher operated the store from January 1, 1966, through December 31, 1966, as a sole proprietorship. On January 1, 1967, 
he sold a one-half interest in the store to Mr. and Mrs. Williams. On September 1, 1967, Letcher and Mr. and Mrs. Williams 
incorporated the business and became the sole shareholders. Letcher sold his interest in the corporation to Mr. and Mrs. 
Williams in July 1971. Mr. and Mrs. Williams dissolved the corporation and reopened the store as a sole proprietorship."
1400,4, A case of 24 twelve oz. bottles of beer cost $ 4.00; a case of four six-pack bottles and cans cost the store $ 4.10.
1400,5," The plaintiff did not introduce any business records corroborating Mrs. Williams's recollection of the cost and sales price of 
Coors beer. "
1401,6," By examining the store's beginning and ending inventories for the year 1966, Green was able to determine the markup on all 
goods sold during that year. Because the store kept no monthly inventories, however, Green was not able to ascertain whether 
the store reduced its markup from 25 percent to 15 percent after the loss of Coors."
1401,7," Green determined the markup on goods sold from 1967 to 1971 by comparing the store's gross profits to sales as listed on the 
store's corporate income tax returns. He then computed the profit that would have been made in each year had the store used a 
25 percent markup. His calculations were as follows: Actual Percent Losses Based on Time Period of Markup"
1401,25, % Markup January-August
1401,1967, 
1401,15," % $ 16,191.00 September 1967-August"

1402,12," ,689.00 $ 89,697.00"
1402,8," . According to Coors's expert, Wayne Peters, goodwill is the amount that a purchaser would be willing to pay for a business 
over and above the value of the business's tangible assets. Valuing a business's goodwill, of course, is a subjective 
determination that takes into consideration factors such as a business's age, profit history, customers, and potential for future 
earnings."
1402,9," Relying on the assumption that the store reduced its markup from 25 percent to 15 percent in 1966, Green calculated the 
store's goodwill value by adding the lost gross profits for each year of the store's operation to the net profits for the store as they 
appeared on the store's corporate income tax returns. The sum of lost gross profits and net profits for the four years, 1967 to 
1971, was identified as adjusted net income. Adjusted net income, in the amount of $ 100,046, was divided by the number of 
years to obtain average net income. Mr. Green then subtracted from average net income the store's return on capital computed 
at 6 percent per year to derive average net income after return on investments. This figure, $ 21,980, was multiplied by five to 
arrive at a goodwill value of $ 109,899."
1402,10," According to Peters, the net income generated by the store from 1966 to 1971 was as follows: YEAR NET INCOME "
1403,1966,"  $ 17,042.00 FISCAL YEAR NET INCOME September 1, 1967-August"
1403,31," , 1968 $ 26,810.00 September 1, 1968-August"

1403,31," , 1971"
1403,22," ,834.00 "
1404,11," At the first trial, Letcher testified that the store may have sold some Coors at a profit.  509 F.2d at 759. We noted that this 
""impressionistic recollection"" was not inconsistent with Coors's uncontradicted assertion that Letcher sold Coors at an overall 
loss. At the second trial, the plaintiff maintained that Coors was not sold at an overall loss. Mrs. Williams's testimony is 
consistent with this position. Moreover, she testified with reasonable specificity with respect to the volume and price of Coors 
sold at the store. Her credibility was a question for the jury.  Hobart Bros. Co. v. Malcolm T. Gilliland, Inc., 5 Cir. 1973, 471 F.2d 
894, 903, cert. denied, 412 U.S. 923, 93 S. Ct. 2736, 37 L. Ed. 2d 150. "
1405,12, We have considered and found meritless arguments of the defendant-appellant not discussed in this opinion.
1405,13," The plaintiff argues that the damage award was too low because it does not compensate for lost future profits that resulted 
from the reduction in markup. The plaintiff's evidence of a reduction in markup is insufficient, however, to compel a reversal of 
the jury's damage award. "
1406,14," HN9[
] - A district court is not bound by, and may not merely ratify, the agreement of the parties as to the amount of attorneys' fees.  
Piambino v. Bailey, 5 Cir. 1980, 610 F.2d 1306, 1328. "
1407,15," The Johnson test, as interpreted in First Colonial, is similar to the Third Circuit's ""lodestar"" method of computing attorneys' 
fees. See Lindy Bros. Bldrs., Inc. v. American Radiator & Standard Sanitary Corp., 3 Cir. 1976, 540 F.2d 102, 112-18; Lindy 
Bros. Bldrs., Inc. v. American Radiator & Standard Sanitary Corp., 3 Cir. 1974, 487 F.2d 161, 167-69; accord, City of Detroit v. 
Grinnell Corp., 2 Cir. 1977, 560 F.2d 1093, 1098-1103; City of Detroit v. Grinnell Corp., 2 Cir. 1974, 495 F.2d 448, 469-74; 
Grunin v. International House of Pancakes, 8 Cir., 513 F.2d 114, 128-29, cert. denied, 1975, HN10[
] 423 U.S. 864, 96 S. Ct. 
124, 46 L. Ed. 2d 93; Knutson v. Daily Review, Inc., N.D.Cal.1979, 479 F. Supp. 1263, 1268-72. Under the ""lodestar"" analysis, 
the district court must find determine the number of hours reasonably spent by the plaintiff's attorney on matters upon which the 
plaintiff was successful. Next, the court must ascertain the value of the attorney's time based on his or her normal billing rate. If a 
number of attorneys are involved, the court may use different rates to reflect the different amounts of skill, expertise, and 
experience possessed by the different attorneys. The court then must determine the ""lodestar"" amount by multiplying the hours 
spent by each attorney on the case by his or her respective hourly rate. Before arriving at a final award, at least two other 
subjective factors must be considered. The first is the contingent nature of success. The second factor is the extent to which any 
exceptionally positive or negative quality of an attorney's work mandates increasing or decreasing the lodestar. A fact to be 
considered in making this adjustment is the amount recovered in damages as compared to the defendant's potential liability. See 
Knutson v. Daily Review, Inc., 479 F. Supp. at 1269-70. See generally Comment, Attorneys' Fees in Individual and Class Action 
Antitrust Litigation, 60 Cal.L.Rev. 1656 (1972)."
1407,16," The district court, in awarding $ 45,000 attorneys' fees, seems to have placed great weight on the amount of treble damages. 
HN12[
] We have recognized that a substantial damage award may justify an enhancement of an attorneys' fee award over 
and above the amount regularly received for such services.  Wolf v. Frank, 5 Cir. 1977, 555 F.2d 1213, 1218. The converse may 
be true in this case. Nevertheless, the size of a damage award should not be the exclusive determinate of an attorneys' fee 
award. "
1414,1," But see Consolidated Pretrial Proceedings, supra, awarding attorneys general fees as if they were private attorneys.  The 
method of computing the fee award was apparently not contested, however. "
1419,1," Since there is no class composed entirely of indirect purchasers, the objectors' argument in one sense is either premature or 
untimely.  To approve the interclass sharing proposal, the court need not determine whether the indirect purchasers secreted 
within the various classes should receive any of the fund, only whether under the circumstances the share assigned to each 
class is fair, adequate, and reasonable.  Assuming that this plan is approved, the court will have to pass upon the blueprints for 
distributing this share among each class at some later date.  To the extent that this argument ties in with the objectors' other 
contention that these shares do not reflect economic realities and should be redrafted, these issues, however, are ripe for 
decision.  Furthermore, the principal complaint of the objectors seems to be that they will not receive what they feel is a large 
enough share of the fund.  Even before the settlement agreements were approved, which the objectors did not oppose, they had 
some idea of what their return would be if the court approved the settlements and the interclass sharing proposal.  If the 
objectors are disappointed with their expected recovery, perhaps they should have opted out of the settlement and pursued their 
own remedies. "
1420,2," The court sees little value in reiterating any further the legal principles discussed in its order of March 7, 1980, when the 
settlement agreements were approved. "
1421,3," The Fifth Circuit's decision in In re Beef Industry Antitrust Litigation, 600 F.2d 1148 (5th Cir. 1979), clearly demonstrates, if 
anything, that this issue cannot be resolved without a thorough review of the circumstances. "
1423,4," The objectors make much of the fact that the sharing proposal was adopted after only three hours of discussion among the 
plaintiffs' representatives, apparently inviting the court to infer that the plan is ill-conceived and hastily drafted.  But even 
assuming that this is all the time it took the plaintiffs' representative to agree, the court does not feel that this fact precludes 
approval of the proposal.  No minimum amount of time is required to produce an acceptable plan; the fact that only a little time 
was invested does not detract from an otherwise acceptable plan. "
