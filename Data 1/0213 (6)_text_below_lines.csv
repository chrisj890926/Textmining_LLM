25,1," .  The national agreement, Article VI, P 34 (Sept. 1, 1975) provided in pertinent part that: ""The employer (national agreement signatory) shall pay only fringe benefit funds … established by a local collective 
bargaining agreement … Nothing contained in this paragraph is intended to require the Employer to become a party to nor 
be bound by the local collective bargaining agreement except for the fringe benefit fund contributions as required herein, 
nor is any signatory employer required to assign his bargaining rights or become a member of any employer group or 
association as a condition for making such contributions. (Exhibit 1673, emphasis added)."
25,2," .  See, CR # 424, B & C Reply Memorandum with Addendum. On June 8, 1976 MCA filed an unfair labor practice charge 
asserting Local's failure to inform MCA of the nature of its demands, and striking on June 1, upon non-mandatory subjects of 
bargaining. This claim settled prior to a complaint issuing from Regional NLRB. "
26,3," .  Plaintiff must have some factual basis for an antitrust action before he files suit; he cannot expect the discovery process to 
reveal evidence of a violation that he merely suspects or hopes to find. See, Program Engineering v. Triangle Publications, 634 
F.2d 1188, 1193-1194 (9th Cir. 1980). Nevertheless, Courts generally have concern for a claimant, facing a motion for summary 
judgment or dismissal for failure to state a claim, who might not know, before discovery, which facts to allege. There is no need 
for similar concern in this case. "
28,4," .  Appearing as it does to fall within the context of a collective bargaining relationship and not imposing a direct restraint upon 
business, any indirect effect on competition would not contravene antitrust policies to a degree not justified by congressional 
labor policy. Defendants would be entitled to claim nonstatutory exemption."
28,5," .  Several Defendants filed affidavits in support of their motions for summary judgment. Plaintiffs filed no affidavit. Moreover, 
Plaintiffs' statement of issues of material fact is essentially a statement of ultimate facts it would seek to prove at trial. See, CR # 
408. However, in its opposition memorandum, Plaintiffs attempt to dispute and raise genuine issues of material fact. "
29,6," .  Local characterizes this as a demand backed by the coercive force of the lockout. But Local rejected MCA's proposal, 
presented no counter proposal, and struck, aware that the Defendants intended to lockout. The union could freely reject any 
""demand"" so long as it bargained in good faith. Presented with an impermissible motivated negotiating demand Local could have 
filed a complaint with the NLRB. The union had other choices. It could consent to an agreement containing an unlawful demand 
and safely refuse to abide by a term the effective enforcement of which would violate Section 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act. Connell 
Construction v. Plumbers & Pipefitters, 421 U.S. 616, 95 S. Ct. 1830, 44 L. Ed. 2d 418 (1975). It could sue for declaratory or 
injunctive relief. Mere participation in a collective bargaining agreement does not predicate antitrust liability and standing alone, 
signing an agreement which has an anticompetitive effect does not violate the Sherman Act. See, Local Union v. Jewel Tea, 381 
U.S. 676, 85 S. Ct. 1596, 14 L. Ed. 2d 640 (1965). "
33,1," Defendants also asserted a Robinson-Patman Act claim, which has since been abandoned. "

34,3," The exclusive jurisdiction of federal courts over cases brought under the federal antitrust statutes does not alter the application 
of traditional collateral estoppel principles in these circumstances.  See Note, The Collateral Estoppel Effect of Prior State Court 
Findings in Cases Within Exclusive Federal Jurisdiction ,"" 91 Harv. L. Rev. 1281, 1290 at 48 (1978)."
34,4," See Defendants' Answers to Interrogatories (Docket No. 82), pp. 11-20."
34,5," The Chancery Court found that defendants had engaged in the practice of giving ""complementary"" i.e., non-competitive 
estimates. 419 A. 2d at 949. "
35,6," In their counterclaim, the defendants assert that Nationwide coerced a tow truck operator into not referring his customers to 
their shops. After oral argument I do not understand Henry Bros. to be pressing this claim.  If I am wrong in this, however, it 
would not change the result.  The defendants' post-trial briefing in its state action summarizes the evidence on this point as 
follows: ""Croxton (a Nationwide adjuster)… told [the] operator of a local towing service, that he would prefer that [the operator] 
discontinue recommending any repair shop, including Henry Bros., which charged ""more than competitive prices"" until 
Nationwide had inspected the vehicle and talked with the owner."" Plaintiff's Opening Post-Trial Brief, p. 24.  This effort at persuasion hardly constitutes a form of ""coercion"" cognizable under the 
antitrust laws. "
36,7," Henry Bros. acknowledges that it received complete or partial payment from Nationwide for about 8% of all the work performed 
by that shop in 1979.  Defendants also admit that from 1974 to 1979 they experienced an increase in the number of repair jobs 
and dollar volume of business done for Nationwide insureds and claimants. "
49,1," .  Four defendants, Marathon, Tenneco, Crown Central, and Colonial Oil Industries sold gasoline at various marketing levels.  
The fifth defendant, Georgia Independent Oilmen's Association, did not sell gasoline, but was accused by Malcolm of facilitating 
the price fixing and predatory pricing that Malcolm accused the other defendants of implementing."
49,2," .  One defendant, Tenneco, sold gasoline to Malcolm's last supplier of gasoline. Thus, this defendant was apparently an indirect 
supplier of Malcolm. "
50,3," .  His records could not adequately support a claim for damages under this count at all his stations so his claim included 
damages for only some of his stations. Although neither side considered it important enough to brief, the record reveals that 
those stations were in Acree; Adel; Albany; Cordele; Cochran; Clyattsville; Macon; Moultrie; and Valdosta.  Malcolm similarly 
limited his claim for damages to a specific time period.  The record reveals that this period extended from June, 1971 to August, 
1972."
50,4," .  This system would not fully explain the occasions when his competitors allegedly decreased their prices beneath his costs. 
This system apparently only explains drops in prices to meet Malcolm's price.  Because the extent of the price drops constitute a 
part of the substantive violations, we need not deal with any difficulty in this part of the plaintiff's case. "
51,5," .  Malcolm did not always specify which competitor decreased their prices.  But it is clear from his testimony that the generally 
prevailing price in the market drastically dropped even if not all his competitors dropped their individual prices.  We think this 
testimony was sufficiently specific to accomplish the same purpose as testimony that all his competitors dropped their prices.  It 
is also clear that when he described these price drops he intended to convey the idea that all his competitors participated in the 
drops."
51,6," .  Not all of these instances were within the locations and time periods for which damages were claimed.  But some were within 
the relevant areas and time periods."
51,7, .  See note 4 supra.
51,8," .  The trial court had misgivings about Malcolm's proof relating to revenues, actual or hypothetical. The trial court initially 
rejected the proof of the actual revenues and costs as summarized by Malcolm's lawyer, because it found Malcolm had not 
established the effect of the conspiracy, a prerequisite for establishing the amount of damages.  The court later admitted this 
summary of Malcolm's revenues and expenses for this period.  Malcolm originally sought to show potential revenues by 
introducing calculations of revenues based on purely hypothetical retail price levels.  The trial court rejected the projected 
revenues assumed in the tendered exhibits because no one testified on the possibility of actually selling gasoline on the various 
hypothetical price levels. "
52,9," .  Tenneco did not turn Malcolm down but rather did not return Malcolm's call.  Malcolm evidently claims that this failure to return 
his call constitutes an unlawful refusal to deal."
52,10," .  Stone's stated that the reason for the cutoff was the debt to Hi-Octane.  Stone's concern for the debt was more than an 
ordinary concern about Malcolm's credit.  Both Stone's and Hi-Octane were acquired by the same company in the summer of 
1972.  Malcolm knew that these two companies belonged to the same larger organization."
52,11," .  On an issue not presently before the Court, Malcolm sought to show that the defendants and other suppliers in refusing to 
sell gasoline to him acted unlawfully to further the ""price-fixing"" conspiracy by eliminating his stations. He first offered the general 
evidence that he claimed tied the suppliers to the conspiracy the suppliers' dislike of price-cutters and their attempts to injure him 
by their pricing practices.  In addition, Malcolm introduced evidence showing that other price-cutters were refused supply.  And 
testimony was given that indicated that prices increased after Malcolm and other price-cutters left the market. And on cross-
examination by one of the defendant's lawyers, one witness in the gasoline retail and wholesale business testified that Malcolm 
was the only retailer refused supply before any shortage of gasoline and no one, to the witness' knowledge, had ever been 
denied supply because of a failure to pay his bills. "
53,12," .  The requisite proof may be divided into four categories: ""the … antitrust violation, the fact of injury, the requisite causal 
relationship between violation and injury, and the amount of damages."" See Lee-Moore Oil Co. v. Union Oil Co., 599 F.2d 1299, 
1306 (4th Cir. 1979). Regardless of the segmentation of the plaintiff's case, the same total proof makes the case."
53,13," .  Of course, this statement is conditioned on our assumption that Malcolm introduced substantial evidence of the two antitrust 
violations.  If there was no violation, defendants' actions, even if harmful to Malcolm, did not cause him any antitrust injury.  See 
Pollock, supra, at 694-95."
53,14," .  Indeed, it is a ""hard core"" per se offense of the antitrust laws and is open to criminal prosecution.  See Baker, To Indict or Not 
To Indict: Prosecutorial Discretion in Sherman Act Enforcement, 63 Cornell L.Rev. 405, 406-08 & n. 20 (1978). "
54,15," .  We infer from Malcolm's brief that predatory pricing is his desired claim.  Malcolm's basic claim is that the defendants' price-
fixing activities violated § 1 of the Sherman Act. But he claims that his injury resulted from the defendants' contrivance of low 
retail prices in order to later fix these prices at a high level.  He apparently treats this enforcement action as if it is separate from 
the activity he labels as ""price-fixing."" But it is not clear exactly what label he would attach to the enforcement mechanism.  In his 
main brief, Malcolm never precisely labels this alleged violation as predatory pricing. Neither does he state which section of the 
antitrust statutes this action violated.  Nor does he cite controlling case law that defines the substantive offense. Although both 
parties agree that this Court need not pass on the alleged violations, some background discussion of the law allegedly violated 
would have been helpful in determining the extent, if any, of Malcolm's antitrust injury.  Nevertheless, Malcolm does state in his 
brief that the pricing practices were designed either to gain his cooperation with the price-fixing conspiracy or to drive him out of 
business.  Malcolm, in his reply brief, does begin to label the violations as ""predatory price-cutting."" Without clearer allegations, 
these statements indicate that Malcolm believed that the defendants' actions constituted predatory pricing with intent to 
monopolize, a violation of § 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2. This interpretation of Malcolm's theory is bolstered by his complaint, where he alleges that in order to fix retail prices, some of 
the defendants: sold below cost for long periods at various of defendants' retail stations located in cities where Plaintiffs did business to cause 
Plaintiffs to return to retail prices set and approved by members of the conspiracy. Malcolm apparently viewed this as a violation of § 2, because in discussing the refusal to deal claim against Stone's, not 
presently a party, Malcolm accused Stone's of ""predatory practices"" in an attempt to monopolize ""in violation of section 2 of the 
Sherman Act."" These alleged ""predatory practices"" by Stone's involved: Sale of gasoline on their retail level at the same time as and at a price lower than their wholesale price. Although Malcolm's pleading and briefing may leave something to be desired, this Court understands that the violation he 
alleged and attempted to prove was predatory pricing in an attempt to monopolize. The defendants were alleged to be members of a conspiracy that took such unlawful action.  The conspiracy and pricing action 
constitute the violation in this case.  Price-fixing may have been the defendants' ultimate goal, but it is extremely misleading to 
frame the issue before this Court as ""whether Malcolm was harmed by a price-fixing conspiracy."" Of course, Malcolm may have intended to allege some other, as yet unnamed, antitrust violation. He may even have viewed the 
setting of low prices as merely another form of ""price-fixing."" But the general outline of the offense alleged clearly resembles that 
of predatory pricing, because Malcolm alleges that the defendants used prices to punish him or injure his business.  And for the 
purposes of discussing causation and damage, the alleged offense is identical to predatory pricing. Thus, we will simply refer to 
the alleged violations under this count as ""predatory pricing,"" and we will assume that even if Malcolm does not believe that the 
relevant action constitutes predatory pricing, whatever action he has described would constitute some other antitrust violation."

] Predatory pricing violates § 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2, when there is an attempt to monopolize, see United States v. American Tobacco Co., 221 U.S. 106, 180-84, 31 S. Ct. 632, 648-50, 55 L. Ed. 663 (1911); Standard Oil Co. v. 
United States, 221 U.S. 1, 43, 31 S. Ct. 502, 509, 55 L. Ed. 619 (1911), § 2 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 13, when the 
predation includes price discrimination, see Moore v. Mead's Fine Bread Co., 348 U.S. 115, 99 L. Ed. 145, 75 S. Ct. 148 (1954), 
and § 3 of the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 13a, under any circumstances.  The issues, with regard to predation are the 
same under all those provisions.  Williamson, Predatory Pricing: A Strategic and Welfare Analysis, 87 Yale L.J. 284, 284 n.1 
(1977). A private right of action, however, does not lie for a violation of § 3 of the Robinson-Patman Act, Nashville Milk Co. v. 
Carnation Co., 355 U.S. 373 (78 S. Ct. 352, 2 L. Ed. 2d 340) (1958), although some lower courts had, at one time, been of the 
opposite view.  See 5 J. von Kalinowski, Antitrust Laws and Trade Regulation § 37.01(4) (1976). In any event, § 2 of the 
Sherman Act may be used by private plaintiffs who suffer a violation of § 2 of the Sherman Act. See Ovitron v. General Motors "
55,," Corp., 295 F. Supp. 373, 377-78 (S.D.N.Y.1969); see generally Areeda & Turner, Predatory Pricing and Related Practices Under 
Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 88 Harv.L.Rev. 697 (1975)."
55,17," .  L. Sullivan, Handbook of the Law of Antitrust 111 (1977).  See Moore v. Mead's Fine Bread Co., 348 U.S. 115, 75 S. Ct. 148, 
99 L. Ed. 145 (1955). Judicial formulations of the predatory pricing concept often turn on the inherently vague test of intent: if an 
alleged predator ""desires"" that its pricing practices injure its competitors, it was using predatory pricing. See L. Sullivan, supra, at 
108-09. Two writers have suggested that a strictly economic test replace the subjective intent test: predatory pricing occurs when pricing 
policies yield returns below average or marginal cost, whichever is lower.  Areeda & Turner, supra note 13.  See also R. Posner, 
Antitrust Law 184-96 (1976).  This suggestion is offered as a way to provide an objective standard as a substitute for proof of 
intent. One author has defended the focus on the subjective intent of the defendant as proved by less precise means.  L. 
Sullivan, supra, at 109-12.  This defense is based on the inherent unreliability of economic measurements and judges' and juries' 
relative ease in understanding human motivations apart from applied economics.  Id. Such objections challenge the feasibility of 
a cost-based approach to a trial context. The Courts of Appeal have recently shown varying degrees of favor toward cost-based tests such as the test proposed by 
Areeda & Turner.  See Chillicothe Sand & Gravel Co. v. Martin Marietta Corp., 615 F.2d 427, 430-32 (7th Cir. 1980); California 
Computer Products, Inc. v. IBM Corp., 613 F.2d 727, 742-43 (9th Cir. 1979); Janich Bros., Inc. v. American Distilling Co., 570 
F.2d 848, 857 (9th Cir. 1977); Pacific Eng'r & Prod. Co. v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 551 F.2d 790, 797 (10th Cir. 1977); Hanson v. 
Shell Oil Co., 541 F.2d 1352, 1358 (9th Cir. 1976); National Ass'n of Regulatory Util. Comm'rs v. FCC, 173 U.S. App. D.C. 413, 
525 F.2d 630, 637-38 & n.34 (1976); International Air Indus. v. American Excelsior Co., 517 F.2d 714, 723-25 (5th Cir. 1975). This consideration of cost-based tests meets with mixed results.  Professors Areeda and Turner would generally welcome such 
a trend. And these developments have been hailed by others.  See, e. g., 11 Ga.L.Rev. 960 (1977). But, as noted above, 
Professor Sullivan has an aversion to cost-based tests, and following the beginning of this trend, scholars have voiced 
objections to the accuracy and hence desirability of Areeda and Turner's cost-based test.  Williamson, Predatory Pricing: A 
Strategic and Welfare Analysis, 87 Yale L.J. 284, 285 (1977); Scherer, Predatory Pricing and the Sherman Act: A Comment, 89 
Harv.L.Rev. 869, 898 (1976). In any event, this classic debate among the titans of the antitrust world rages still.  Compare 
Williamson, supra and Williamson, Williamson on Predatory Pricing II, 88 Yale L.J. 1183 (1979) and Scherer, supra with Areeda 
& Turner, Williamson on Predatory Pricing, 87 Yale L.J. 1337 (1978) and Areeda & Turner, Predatory Pricing: A Rejoinder, 88 
Yale L.J. 1641 (1979) and Areeda & Turner, Scherer on Predatory Pricing, 89 Harv.L.Rev. 891 (1976). This Court need not presently offer its views on this debate. But before he may get his case to a jury, Malcolm must establish the 
existence of the substantive violation of predatory pricing in the time period and markets for which he intends to claim damages.  
On this appeal, he is greatly aided by our assumption that he proved the substantive violation alleged."
55,18," .  The trial court specifically stated that its directed verdict was based only on lack of evidence on causation and amount of 
damages.  Given this limitation, the simplest method of handling this appeal would be to assume the existence of whatever 
violations Malcolm alleged and to limit our holding to causation and damages. Proceeding under that method we assume that 
Malcolm proved predatory pricing traceable to some extent to the defendants' actions that intermittently took place over a 15 
month period in the several markets serviced by the nine of Malcolm's stations for which he claimed damages. The trial court, however, did not entirely agree with this perception of the case.  It sometimes viewed parts of the substantive 
violation as if they were parts of the causation question.  We can and do simply hold the trial court to the explicit limits of its 
directed verdict order.  But, in the alternative, such parts of the trial court's order may be answered directly as well. For example, the trial court, in explaining its direction of the verdict, asked: ""How can the jury conclude that just because 
anybody went down in price at the time Mr. Malcolm went down that that was caused by the conspiracy? That's sheer 
guesswork."" This question seems directed at the alleged violation rather than causation, although it is framed in causation terms.  
A drop in prices is perfectly legal, but a drop in prices instigated by a conspiracy to rid the market of price-cutters would be 
unlawful. See note 17 and accompanying text supra.  In any event, Malcolm did offer evidence tying the conspiracy to the price 
drops when he offered evidence of: 1) alleged conspirators' threats of price drops unless he increased his prices; 2) 
simultaneous price drops at every location where he had a station; and 3) the defendants' antipathy toward price-cutters as 
evidenced by their temporary price allowances that placed price-cutters such as Malcolm at a competitive disadvantage.  This "
56,," evidence should suffice to create a jury question regarding the conspiracy's connection to the price drops, assuming the 
existence of a conspiracy. Intent behind predatory pricing, or, as in this case the connection between the conspiracy and the 
unnaturally low prices, is not susceptible of direct proof, L. Sullivan, supra note 14, at 111, because conspirators are unlikely to 
leave such proof.  It seems to place too great a burden on plaintiffs to show separate intent behind each discrete instance of low 
prices once evidence of a conspiracy has been introduced. Similarly, the trial court, while commenting on Malcolm's testimony asked: ""(I)f the defendants did not go down (in price) in 
concert, then where is the cause and effect of the conspiracy."" These comments resulted from the trial court's perceived conflict 
in Malcolm's testimony, where on direct examination, Malcolm stated that in 1971 and 1972 his competitors ""dropped the price"" 
and then on cross-examination, he stated that ""every competitor didn't drop his price when I dropped mine."" At most this 
inconsistency, challenges the credibility of Malcolm and is not a proper ground for a directed verdict. And in any event, not every 
competitor need be a conspirator before Malcolm's business is injured. In addition, the trial court was troubled because Malcolm had not specifically stated which competitors dropped their prices.  The 
trial court asked: How is the jury going to conclude who went down?  And why they went down?  Just on the word ""everybody."" You can't prove a 
conspiracy by saying everybody did it, gentlemen. This statement carries two meanings.  First, it challenged the effect of the violation.  Malcolm specified the competitors of each 
of his stations. If he stated on direct examination that all of them went down in price, his meaning is sufficiently clear.  His 
credibility may be improved by a second specific recitation of the competitors' identities when the specific price drops were 
discussed.  But if Malcolm intends to accuse them all of such action, it is not clear why he could not make such a statement in 
the simplest possible terms.  Second, this statement challenges the existence of a conspiracy, but the trial court explicitly 
reserved judgment on whether a conspiracy has been proved."
56,19," .  This is not a novel observation. In a case involving similar price-cutting by competitors, the Supreme Court summarily concluded that the record contained 
sufficient evidence of injury to the plaintiff's business and property resulting from the unlawful combination, and, in discussing the 
amount of damage the Court noted that: (I)t is fair to say that the natural and probable effect of the combination and price cutting would be to destroy normal prices …. Story Parchment Co. v. Paterson Parchment Paper Co., 282 U.S. 555, 561, 51 S. Ct. 248, 250, 75 L. Ed. 544 (1931). In discussing the proof of causation in a private antitrust case, one author has stated that: There are three stages of proof in treble damage cases: first, that defendant committed a violation; second, that it caused 
plaintiff some harm; third, the amount of the harm.  In some cases, evidence establishing the violation will support the inference 
that plaintiff must have suffered some harm as a result it will, in short, establish the first two elements of the case together.  
Thus, in Story Parchment Co. v. Paterson Parchment Paper Co., proof that defendant cut prices below the cost of production in "
57,," order to drive plaintiff out of business would without more justify the conclusion that defendant must have caused plaintiff, one of 
his competitors, some loss, unless other evidence rebutted it. Harvard Note, supra, at 1573 (footnote omitted).  The situation envisioned by that author greatly resembles Malcolm's case. In another context, one court has discussed the effect of an ultimate buyer-defendant's actions in depressing the market price for 
the goods upon the original sellers: (T)here was sufficient evidence that the plaintiffs sold cattle in a market at prices depressed due to the acts of the defendant. It 
was the defendant who created an environment into which the plaintiffs were forced to sell their wares…. That this economic 
manipulation had a direct adverse effect on the plaintiffs cattlemen attempting to sell in a depressed market is obvious. Bray v. Safeway Stores, Inc., 392 F. Supp. 851, 863-64 (N.D.Cal.1975) (citation omitted), cause dismissed following 
settlement by parties, 403 F. Supp. 412. See also Cackling Acres, Inc. v. Olson Farms, Inc., 541 F.2d 242 (10th Cir. 1976)."
57,20," .  HN8[
] An antitrust plaintiff must show an anticompetitive injury of the kind envisioned by the antitrust laws. See Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 97 S. Ct. 690, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977). Thus, an injury resulting from normal 
price competition would not entitle the plaintiff to recover.  But any injury resulting from predatory pricing would be an 
anticompetitive injury because the substantive violation is anticompetitive, by nature it is distinguished by definition from normal 
competitive pricing and lost sales or profits are the kind of injury to be remedied by a private right of action."
57,21," .  The existence of low prices may be part of the proof of the substantive violation.  Assuming that the legal requisites for proof 
of the predatory pricing violation were satisfied, the evidence of low prices would also be part of the proof of damage.  Because 
of the nature of predatory pricing, this evidence would be used to prove both the violation and the fact of damages.  Thus, to 
show the fact of damage Malcolm must have introduced evidence of low prices which we will assume constituted the violation. Malcolm met this requirement with three forms of evidence. First, he testified about instances where in relevant markets his 
competitors set unnaturally low prices that dropped to near his wholesale costs.  Second, Malcolm points to testimony by others 
of low or depressed prices in various retail markets.  Third, Malcolm also introduced evidence of his own average monthly retail 
prices. And, if his method of calculating damages is followed, from these averages, a Court can derive the approximate average 
monthly price prevailing in the independent retail markets.  This conclusion follows because Malcolm claims that he priced one 
to two cents per gallon below the prevailing independent price.  And if the average prevailing price, thus derived, is below the 
""normal price"" Malcolm would claim that this piece of evidence shows the existence of depressed prices in a third way. We are aware that Malcolm's stations generally operated in different markets, even though Malcolm in his brief has made no 
attempt to detail the relevant markets and time period or to show specifically how his stations in these relevant markets were 
injured.  His proof relevant to the injuries claimed are merely lumped together with proof relating to markets and time periods for 
which damages are not claimed.  Malcolm left it for the court to sort this evidence.  Evidence of depressed prices in Macon 
would not affect the profits of Malcolm's station in Valdosta.  But those depressed prices would injure the profits of Malcolm's 
Macon station. Thus, there was evidence of injury because there was evidence of low prices in several relevant markets.  And if 
the low prices, shown to exist in at least some of the relevant markets, constituted predatory pricing violations, Malcolm has 
shown the possibility of at least, some antitrust injury.  Any further inquiry then must be directed at the proof of the amount of 
damage in those markets.  See Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U.S. 100, 114 n.9, 89 S. Ct. 1562, 1571 n.9, 
23 L. Ed. 2d 129 (1969). And Malcolm's evidence of depressed prices as derived from his own prices would be evidence of 
depressed prices in all relevant markets.  Thus, Malcolm would have shown some injury at all nine stations for which damages 
are claimed."
57,22," .  Cases involving maximum price ceilings set by defendants in other cases are urged upon us by the present defendants who 
apparently argue that those cases offer a useful analogy on the present causation issue.  We agree that these cases are 
somewhat analogous, but we believe they do not undercut the plaintiff. Malcolm has satisfied the injury-in-fact requirements of "
58,," those cases.  See Kestenbaum v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., 575 F.2d 564 (5th Cir. 1978) (plaintiff must show that he could have 
sold same volume at higher prices in a free market and in absence of defendant's restraints on maximum price).  These cases 
did not involve major disruptions of market prices.  Where these plaintiffs were restrained from raising prices, they must still 
demonstrate why they could have raised prices absent the restraint.  Without evidence that the prevailing market prices was 
higher than the restrained price this showing of injury would be difficult.  In this case, it is clear that if the market price had not 
been lowered below normal, every retailer could have raised his prices without losing volume. Thus, Malcolm does not have as 
difficult a proposition to prove as did those plaintiffs in the price restraint cases.  He has sufficiently shown that his profit-
maximizing price was greater than the low market price effectively set by the conspirators in those specific instances of 
unnaturally low prices testified to by Malcolm.  And with respect to the other periods of time when the prices were below normal, 
we think it is sufficiently clear that if the market prices rose, Malcolm could and would have raised his prices. The Ninth Circuit has on one occasion found that a requirement such as the one in Kestenbaum is unnecessary.  In that case, 
Judge Hufstedler wrote that: Rather than imposing the nearly impossible burden of proving what each dealer would have done if he had been free to make 
his own pricing decision, we assume that, absent evidence to the contrary, a dealer would have raised his prices had it been 
profitable to do so; that is, dealers are profit maximizers.  This assumption merely amounts to a recognition that a ""restraint"" in 
fact restrains. The defendants can attempt to show plaintiffs would have kept their prices beneath a maximizing point despite 
their violative behavior. Contrary evidence might include dealer testimony that he would not have raised his price, or a showing 
by the defendants that the dealers had reasons other than the restraint for selling below a profit-maximizing price. Knutson v. Daily Review, Inc., 548 F.2d 795, 812 (9th Cir. 1976). We need not follow the Ninth Circuit rule in order to hold that 
Malcolm did produce sufficient evidence of his injury in fact, because Malcolm did offer evidence that retail prices were lowered 
below the price level he had chosen. The defendants, at this point, make an interesting argument. They assert that Malcolm's marketing philosophy conflicts with his 
damage theory on this count.  Malcolm testified that he often lowered his prices to increase his volume and the defendants 
argue that this testimony contradicts his damage theory which holds that Malcolm was injured when the defendants' conspiracy 
forced him to lower his prices to meet depressed prices caused by the defendants' acts.  The defendants argue that Malcolm 
should have sold a larger quantity when he lowered his prices to meet the predatory prices in the market than when he sold 
gasoline in a free market.  In support of this argument, the defendants cite the work of an economist who was once retained by 
Malcolm: (Experience) shows that, if other things remain equal, buyers will buy a larger number of units of a good at a lower price than 
they will at a higher price. R. Pfouts, Elementary Economics: A Mathematical Approach 22 (1972).  Many economists have undoubtedly expressed similar 
opinions because this tenet is basic to the price theory of economists.  But this view of the ""laws"" of supply and demand does 
not undercut the plaintiff's case.  The key assumption in the quotation is found in the phrase ""if other things remain equal."" In this 
case, Malcolm could expect to sell at least the same volume at a higher price if all his competitors abandoned predatory pricing 
and raised their prices back to the ""normal price."" If they took that action Malcolm could actually expect to increase his volume 
because he would regain his only competitive advantage the ability to price below other independent retailers in a freely 
competitive market. Upon regaining that advantage Malcolm could return to his policy of pricing one to two cents below other 
independents and his relative market share, and hence volume, would naturally increase.  Under the defendants' asserted view 
of economics Malcolm would be privileged to sell his goods in a market of depressed prices created by the defendants. Defendants also urge upon us Chrysler Credit Corp. v. J. Truett Payne, Inc., 607 F.2d 1133 (5th Cir. 1979), cert. granted, 449 
U.S. 819, 101 S. Ct. 70, 66 L. Ed. 2d 20 (1980) and Foremost-McKesson, Inc. v. Instrumentation Laboratory, Inc., 527 F.2d 417 
(5th Cir. 1976) as examples of the proper application of directed verdicts with respect to antitrust issues of causation and 
damage.  We find that those cases are distinguishable from this case.  Neither Chrysler Credit nor Foremost-McKesson 
concerned alleged actions that were as inherently destructive or as calculated to injure as the actions alleged in this case.  The 
rebates, discounts and other actions challenged in those cases can very easily serve competitive purposes.  HN9[
] A part of 
the substantive violation of predatory pricing is the intent to injure competitors. Given the intent behind predatory pricing and the 
natural tendency of such action to injure, it is correct that we not demand, in this case, the stronger evidence of causation 
required by those two cases.  Moreover, Foremost-McKesson may also be distinguished because of the numerous evidentiary 
deficiencies in that plaintiff's case.  In an action against a competitor, that plaintiff failed because: it also engaged in ""all or "
59,," nothing bidding,"" one of the challenged practices; was not at all shut off from obtaining ""exclusives"" such as those it challenged 
were held by the defendant; and failed to specify other alleged losses."
59,23," .  We repeat that this is a cognizable antitrust injury only if it was the result of predatory practices, not if it was the result of 
normal competitive policies."
59,24," .  Malcolm prepared summaries of his expenses and revenues for the relevant time period.  The revenue records contain 
Malcolm's average monthly retail prices as derived from Malcolm's business records that were also in evidence.  The defendants 
attack the validity of the revenue and expense figures, but these arguments are directed to the accuracy of these figures.  The 
key variable is the retail price figure, and we will focus on it.  See Story Parchment Co. v. Paterson Parchment Paper Co., 282 
U.S. 555, 561-62, 51 S. Ct. 248, 49-50, 75 L. Ed. 544 (1931). In computing the amount of his damage, Malcolm attempted to 
demonstrate that amount by estimating how much he would have increased his retail price but for the actions of the conspiracy. 
He offered evidence that he set his prices one to two cents below the independent retail competition. There was evidence from 
the defendants' records and testimony of a ""normal price"" that prevailed in absence of price depressions that Malcolm asserts 
were created by the defendants.  Thus, Malcolm claims that he would have set his price at one to two cents below the ""normal 
price"" but for the defendants' allegedly unlawful acts.  The difference between this projected price and Malcolm's actual average 
monthly price represents Malcolm's lost revenue per gallon of gasoline sold.  He assumes his relative share of the retail market, 
and hence his volume, would remain constant in these calculations because all retail prices would rise by at least as much as his 
prices.  From these figures his lost profits may be derived in substance. A chart comparing these figures for one city would be illustrative.  Set out below is a chart of the figures for Macon. Macon is 
apparently the city for which the most complete records are available.  Included for further illustration in this chart are price "
60,," figures of Malcolm's Macon competitors whose data is available in some of the exhibits.  These same exhibits show the normal 
price in Macon. Macon 1971 Macon Prices per gallon Jan. July Aug. Sept. Oct. Nov. Dec. Regular Gas Malcolm Avg."

65,25," .  Malcolm did not testify that, in response to the market price drops, he lowered his price.  But he would clearly be injured by 
such general price decreases and we can infer that he did lower his price, because he did offer evidence that he sought to 
compete on the basis of low prices and to stay one to two cents beneath the market.  Thus, it is natural to expect that if the 
general market price decreased, Malcolm would follow that price in order to fulfill his marketing philosophy and to preserve his 
only competitive advantage.  It would be unrealistic to expect that a small businessman would remember his daily reaction to 
market prices."
65,26," .  Of course, the defendants may attempt as a defense to show that Malcolm caused the market prices to decrease rather than 
the market forcing Malcolm to decrease his price.  But we need not resolve this problem on this appeal. "
66,27," .  Malcolm also testified that one of the conspirators, his last supplier, sought to buy him out just before the refusal to deal. "
67,28," .  Malcolm responds that even if the refusals to deal did not directly force him out of business, he may still claim damages for 
the loss of his business because the pricing practices oppressed his business.  HN15[
] A plaintiff need not ""retain possession 
of a business oppressed by anti-trust violation until the business is bankrupted or directly shut down by the violator."" Pollock & 
Riley, Inc. v. Pearl Brewing Co., 498 F.2d 1240, 1244 (5th Cir. 1974). Malcolm is correct that he may voluntarily close his 
business and still collect lost future profits if he can show that the defendants' antitrust violations forced him out of business.  
This Court has stated that: We do not accept (the defendant's) restrictive application of the principle of future profits as antitrust damages.  When a practice 
condemned by the Sherman Act puts a small operator out of business, we do not think it matters whether the antitrust violator 
directly closes down the small proprietor or whether he takes anti-competitive steps which foreseeably will result in the 
proprietor's demise if carried on for a sufficient amount of time. Lehrman v. Gulf Oil Corp., 464 F.2d 26, 45 (5th Cir. 1972). Although Malcolm correctly states the law, these principles do not 
aid him because his proof does not show that the defendants' oppressive pricing practices forced him out of business.  This 
isolated mention of the defendants' ""oppressive"" pricing practices does little to bolster his argument for damages based on future 
profits. All his other arguments and proof at trial were directed at showing that he was entitled to such damages because a 
concerted refusal to deal put him out of business.  He may not under these circumstances argue that the oppressive pricing 
practices caused his business' demise.  His proof as discussed in his brief fails to show a causal link between the pricing 
practices and his closing his service station. "
68,29," .  Of course, a plaintiff who does tap an alternative source may still prove some injury if a change of suppliers results in other 
losses such as increased costs or decreased revenues.  See Lee-Moore Oil Co. v. Union Oil Co., 599 F.2d 1299, 1305 (4th Cir. 
1979). This recognition will not greatly aid Malcolm who seeks to recoup future profits."
68,30," .  This formulation is slightly inaccurate, because an Hofeldian plaintiff has no ""duty"" where there is no correlative right.  
Ellerman Lines, Ltd. v. The President Harding, 288 F.2d 288, 289 (2d Cir. 1961) (citing Some Fundamental Legal 
Conceptions as Applied in Judicial Reasoning, 23 Yale L.J. 16, 30-32 (1913)). The rule may be conceived as a method of 
apportioning damages between the parties. And its proper formulation is that HN19[
] a defendant is not liable for post-injury 
consequences avoidable by the plaintiff who uses reasonable care.  See Tennessee Valley Sand & Gravel Co., v. M/V Delta, 
598 F.2d 930, 932-33 (5th Cir. 1979); Ellerman Lines, Ltd. v. The President Harding, 288 F.2d 288, 289-90 (2d Cir. 1961). "
69,31," .  Moreover, Malcolm had plans for further expansion that are in no manner accounted for in his evidence of profit history.  
Malcolm also argues that these figures are conservative for an additional reason the defendants' ""predatory"" pricing practices 
reduced Malcolm's profits in 1972."
69,32," .  We recognize that courts have disapproved of estimates based on short, unrepresentative periods.  See, e. g., Hanson v. 
Shell Oil Co., 541 F.2d 1352, 1360-61 (9th Cir. 1976). But on the facts of this case a longer period would not necessarily 
represent a true picture and we have no reason to believe the period was unrepresentative. "
70,33, .  The only purpose of this effort could have been to keep his stations open.
70,34," .  Admittedly, Malcolm could cancel these leases but that fact does not mean that the leases carry no evidentiary weight. "
77,1," In March of 1973 a check drawn by Island Tobacco was dishonored because of insufficient funds on deposit; in June, an 
expected payment from Island was late; a financial statement also due in June was not submitted until November. The delayed fiscal report indicated the principal officer-stockholder's indebtedness to the company had increased dramatically 
within a fairly short period, a small stockholder equity had been replaced by a large deficit, the company was short of working 
capital, and it owed a large sum in unpaid taxes. The debt owed the company by the principal officer-stockholder, which represented its principal asset, was subsequently written 
off as an uncollectible debt. "
78,2," While the complaint, as amended, did not specifically aver that defendants engaged in price-fixing in violation of HRS § 480-
4(b), in its pre-trial statement, plaintiff asserted its claims included one for illegal price-fixing. And in oral argument before this 
court, plaintiff contended the quintessence of its complaint was predatory pricing by defendants. "
79,3," HRS § 480-4(a) reads: Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce in the State, 
or in any section of this State is illegal. In 1961, 15 U.S.C. § 1 read in relevant part: Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the 
several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. . . ."
79,4," HRS § 480-9 reads: No person shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person to monopolize any 
part of the trade or commerce in any commodity in any section of the State. In 1961, 15 U.S.C. § 2 read in relevant part: "
80,," Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to 
monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of 
a misdemeanor. . . ."
80,5," HRS § 480-4(b) reads: Without limiting the generality of the foregoing no person, exclusive of members of a single business entity consisting of a 
sole proprietorship, partnership, trust, or corporation, shall agree, combine, or conspire with any other person or persons, or 
enter into, become a member of, or participate in, any understanding, arrangement, pool, or trust, to do, directly or 
indirectly, any of the following acts, in the State or any section of the State: (1) Fix, control, or maintain, the price of any commodity; (2) Limit, control, or discontinue, the production, manufacture, or sale of any commodity for the purpose or with the 
result of fixing, controlling or maintaining its price; (3) Fix, control, or maintain, any standard of quality of any commodity for the purpose or with the result of fixing, 
controlling, or maintaining its price; (4) Refuse to deal with any other person or persons for the purpose of effecting any of the acts described in (1) to (3) 
of this subsection."
80,6," The Supreme Court has summarized the bases for declaring certain practices unlawful in and of themselves, and not subject to 
a ""rule of reason,"" as follows: However, there are certain agreements or practices which because of their pernicious effect on competition and lack of any 
redeeming virtue are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and therefore illegal without elaborate inquiry as to the 
precise harm they have caused or the business excuse for their use.  This principle of per se unreasonableness not only 
makes the type of restraints which are proscribed by the Sherman Act more certain to the benefit of everyone concerned, 
but it also avoids the necessity for an incredibly complicated and prolonged economic investigation into the entire history of 
the industry involved, as well as related industries, in an effort to determine at large whether a particular restraint has been 
unreasonable -- an inquiry so often wholly fruitless when undertaken. Northern Pac. Ry v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5 (1958). It also enumerated some of the per se unlawful practices in the same opinion: Among the practices which the courts have 
heretofore deemed to be unlawful in and of themselves are price fixing, United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 
150, 210; division of markets, United States v. Addyston Pipe & Steel Co., 85 F. 271, aff'd, 175 U.S. 211; group boycotts, 
Fashion Originators' Guild v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 312 U.S. 457; and tying arrangements, International Salt Co. v. 
United States, 332 U.S. 392. Id."
80,7," The conference committee report reads in part: It is the intent of subsection (1) [now codified as HRS § 480-4(a)] to retain the language and interpretation of section 1 of 
the Sherman Act and it is not intended to be restricted or limited by any other subsection of this section. It is the intent of subsection (2) [now codified as HRS § 480-4(b)] to codify certain acts which have been held by the courts 
to be ""per se"" violations of the Sherman Act, and therefore not subject to the ""rule of reason"" as considered by the courts in 
Sherman Act cases.  A further subsection (3) [now codified as HRS § 480-4(c) and not at issue here] has been added the "
81,," purpose of which is to exclude from the prohibitions of subsection (2) those ancillary restrictive covenants and agreements 
which the federal courts have found not to be restraints of trade within the meaning of Sherman Act language and to make 
them subject to the Clayton Act test where the effect may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a 
monopoly in any line of commerce in any section of the state.  It is understood that the listing of ""per se"" violations 
contained in subsection (2) of section 2 may not necessarily include all of the ""per se"" violations.  Likewise, it is understood 
that the listing of ancillary restrictive covenants and agreements which are similar in type and nature and related to the 
lawful purposes of another agreement or transaction may be excluded by the courts from the application of the ""per se"" 
violations listed in subsection (2) and from the application of subsection (1) of this section if such is the interpretation given 
by the federal courts in construing section 1 of the Sherman Act. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 16, in 1961 House Journal 1067, 1068.  (Footnote omitted)."
81,8," The conference committee concluded its report on the following note: In conclusion it is the intent of your Committee on Conference that wherever there are comparable provisions of the federal 
anti-trust laws and tests similar in language to those provided in this bill, it is intended that those decided federal cases 
applicable and relating to those provisions and tests will guide the interpretation and application of such terms and 
provisions of this bill in the light of the economic and business conditions of this State. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 16, supra, in 1961 House Journal, at 1075."
81,9," HRS § 480-2 reads: Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are 
unlawful."
81,15," U.S.C. § 45(a)(1) reads: Unfair methods of competition in commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce, are declared unlawful."
81,10," HRS § 480-3 reads: It is the intent of the legislature that in construing section 480-2 the courts will be guided by the interpretations given by the 
Federal Trade Commission and the federal courts to section 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act."
81,11," The committee report states in part: H.B. No. 136 provides that the courts, in construing its terms, will be guided by the interpretations given by the Federal 
Trade Commission and the Federal courts to the appropriate sections of the Federal Trade Commission Act. In each case, 
however, the courts of Hawaii must also necessarily give due regard to problems peculiar or pertinent to the State of 
Hawaii. Hse. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 55, in 1965 House Journal 538, 539. "
82,12," The report of the House Committee on Judiciary and Corrections states in part: Section 480-2, H.R.S., declares that unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct 
of any trade or commerce are unlawful.  In interpreting the broad provisions of section 480-2, the Hawaii courts are directed 
by section 480-3, H.R.S., to be guided by the interpretations given by the Federal Trade Commission and the federal courts 
to section 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. That section of the FTC Act is the statute on which section 480-2, 
H.R.S., is patterned.  The FTC rules and the FTC and federal court interpretations of section 5(a)(1) of the FTC Act require 
some measure of public interest being involved.  This requirement of showing an infringement upon the public may be an 
impediment to an individual filing an action for treble damages under section 480-13, H.R.S. This is because in many 
instances an individual may only be able to show that a merchant practiced an unfair or deceptive act upon him rather than 
upon others in the general public. Your Committee finds that it is desirable to allow individuals to sue for unfair or deceptive business practices which may 
affect only the aggrieved individual without the necessity for showing that the action involves an infringement upon the 
public.  Allowing such suits will discourage such practices and is in the public interest. Hse. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 735-74, in 1974 House Journal 829, 830.  See also Sen. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 703-74, in 1974 
Senate Journal 1020, 1021."
82,13," The report from the Senate Committee on Judiciary on the pertinent measure reads in part: This bill, with two slight changes, was copied verbatim from the California statute.  The California statute appears to have 
been based upon the South Dakota, Nebraska, Minnesota and Iowa statutes.  These statutes have been construed and 
tested upon a number of occasions and have been upheld as being valid (226 U.S. 157, 123 N.W. 504, 117 N.W. 768, 133 
N.W. 895, 60 Pac. (2) 596). Generally speaking the bill makes unlawful the following trade practices: (1) to discriminate between different sections, 
communities or cities, or portions thereof by selling any commodity with intent to destroy competition of any regularly 
established dealer in such commodity, or to prevent competition; (2) to sell or offer for sale any article at less than cost for "
83,," the purpose of injuring competitors and destroying competition (the term cost is defined in sections 3, 4 and 5 of the bill); (3) 
to give or offer to give any article away for the purpose of injuring competitors and destroying competition; and (4) to make 
secret payment or allowance of rebates, refunds, commissions or unearned discounts or special privileges to injure a 
competitor and to destroy competition. The purpose of the bill, as concisely expressed in section 13 thereof, is ""to safeguard the public against the creation or 
perpetuation of monopolies and to foster and encourage competition"".  To attain this paramount purpose the bill is designed 
to prevent certain unfair trade practices that destroy or prevent competition or unfairly injure competitors. Sen. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 293, in 1937 Senate Journal 1222.  See also Hse. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 527, in 1937 House 
Journal 2056, 2057."
83,14," S.L.H. 1937, c. 223, § 3, read in part: It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, firm, corporation, joint stock company, or other association engaged in 
business within this Territory, to sell, offer for sale or advertise for sale any article or product, or service or output of a 
service trade, at less than the cost thereof to such vendor, or give, offer to give or advertise with the intent to give away any 
article or product, or service or output of a service trade, for the purpose of injuring competitors and destroying competition, 
and he or it shall also be guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof shall be subject to the penalties set out in 
section 11 of this Act for any such act. For all practical purposes, the foregoing was a duplicate of § 3 of the California Unfair Practices Act, Gen. Laws Supp. 1935, Act 
8781, § 3, as it read in 1937. "
84,15," ""[S]ummary procedures should be used sparingly in complex antitrust litigation. . . ."" Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting Sys., 
Inc., 368 U.S. 464, 473 (1962). But where the issues are primarily legal questions not subject to determination by the trier of 
facts, we have found summary judgments appropriate, even in an antitrust setting.  Technicolor, Inc. v. Traeger, 57 Haw. 113, 
119, 551 P.2d 163, 168 (1976). Moreover, summary judgments on issues related to HRS Chapter 480 were sought by all 
parties."
84,16," While plaintiff alleges a violation of HRS § 481-1 in its pleadings, it has not argued that defendants engaged in discriminatory 
pricing practices.  Although its primary contention is that defendants were guilty of predatory pricing, its arguments have 
centered on alleged below-cost sales."
84,17," The Supreme Court's paraphrase of the Government's theory of the case read as follows: The complaint charges that the restraint of interstate trade was not only effected by the combination of the appellees but 
was the primary object of the combination.  The theory of the complaint, to borrow language from United States v. Reading 
Co., 253 U.S. 26, 57, is that ""dominating power"" over the cab operating companies ""was not obtained by normal expansion 
to meet the demands of a business growing as a result of superior and enterprising management, but by deliberate, 
calculated purchase for control."" If that theory is borne out in this case by the evidence, coupled with proof of an undue 
restraint of interstate trade, a plain violation of the Act has occurred."
84,332, U.S. at 227-28. 
85,18," The Court's statement on other theories of unlawful combinations was: In any event each petitioner can clearly charge a combination between Midas and himself, as of the day he unwillingly 
complied with the restrictive franchise agreements, Albrecht v. Herald Co., 390 U.S. 145, 150, n.6 (1968); Simpson v. Union 
Oil Co., supra, or between Midas and other franchise dealers, whose acquiescence in Midas' firmly enforced restraints was 
induced by ""the communicated danger of termination,"" United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co., 388 U.S. 365, 372 (1967); 
United States v. Parke, Davis & Co., 362 U.S. 29 (1960)."

86,19," While the holding in this case was largely based on the exemption of agricultural cooperatives from antitrust laws provided by 
§ 6 of the Clayton Act and § 1 of the Copper-Volstead Act, the decision undoubtedly also turned on the Court's observations that 
there was no indication ""the use of separate corporations had economic significance in itself or that outsiders considered and 
dealt with the three entities as independent organizations."" 370 U.S. at 29."

87,21," Although plaintiff's complaint does not specifically allege attempted monopolization, the circuit court apparently read plaintiff's 
general averments that defendants breached § 480-9 as including an attempt to effect a monopoly. "
88,22," Cf. V. & L. Cicione, Inc. v. C. Schmidt & Sons, Inc., 403 F. Supp. 643, 651-52 (E.D. Pa. 1975), aff'd, 565 F.2d 154 (3d Cir. 
1977) (plaintiff's suggestion that a beer manufacturer and a distributor conspired to monopolize relevant market for all beers 
brought a response from the court that the suggestion ""does not even show a faint possibility of success""); Wisdom Rubber 
Indus., Inc. v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., 415 F. Supp. 363, 368 (D.Haw. 1976) (""intent, without some probability of success, is 
mere wishful thinking and not the type of activity which the antitrust laws were designed to protect"")."
88,23," The conclusion that defendants did not possess or were not likely to acquire the requisite power in a relevant market renders a 
discussion of a ""willful acquisition or maintenance of that power"" (wrongful intent) unnecessary."
88,24," The affidavit above was accompanied by several financial statements expressly prepared by defendants for summary 
judgment purposes.  One of the statements purportedly indicates the cost of manufacturing and merchandising the cigarettes 
sold in Hawaii by the Reynolds enterprise.  But its self-serving nature precludes the award of summary judgment to defendants 
solely on this basis. "
89,25," The earlier discussion also noted §§ 480-2 and 481-3 were both designed to protect individual ""competitors"" and private 
interests as well as ""competition"" and the public interest.  In this sense, they undoubtedly share common objectives. "

105,15," .  Vertical integration describes the extent to which a firm is involved in more than one stage of the development of a product 
from the time it is manufactured until it is sold to ultimate consumers. It can be distinguished from horizontal integration, which 
describes a firm which makes or sells more than one product. "
106,16," .  HN16[
] Marginal cost is the addition to total cost from producing an additional unit of output. Areeda & Turner, Predatory Pricing and Related Practices Under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, supra, 88 Harv.L.Rev. at 700. Variable costs are costs which 
vary with changes in output.  Janich Bros., Inc. v. American Distilling Co., supra, 570 F.2d at 858 n.11, citing Areeda & Turner, 
supra at 700. Variable costs typically include such items as materials, fuel, labor directly used to produce the product, indirect 
labor such as foremen, clerks, custodial help, utilities, repair and maintenance, and per unit royalties and license fees. Average 
variable cost is the costs that vary with changes in output divided by the output. Id. See also International Air Industries v. 
American Excelsior Co., 517 F.2d 714, 724 n. 27 (5th Cir. 1975)."
106,17," .  The degree of integration indicates the extent to which the market varies from the competitive model, which holds that 
economic activity could be carried on by an infinitely large number of infinitely small firms each being the best possible size and 
working at the optimum level of efficiency. Adelman, Integration and Antitrust Policy, 63 Harv.L.Rev. 27, 28 (1949)."

] Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce in 
the State, or in any section of this State is illegal."
106,19," .  Hawaii Rev.Stat. § 480-9 is the State of Hawaii's monopolization statute. This claim is left for discussion under 
monopolization claims below."
106,20," .  Legislative history of Hawaii's antitrust statutes clearly indicates that it was the intention of the legislature to rely on and refer 
to federal antitrust law for guidance and interpretation. The House Conference Committee in discussing what subsequently 
became Hawaii Rev.Stat. § 480-4, noted that ""it is the intention of subsection (1) (§ 480-4) to retain the language and "
107,," interpretation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act and it is not intended to be restricted or limited by any other subsections of this 
section."" House Conference Committee Report No. 19, H.B. No. 27, H.D. 2, S.D. 2, C.D. 1 (May 27, 1961) at page 3. "
108,21," .  Each of the Supreme Court cases suggests the validity of an intra-enterprise conspiracy theory, but in each case there was at 
least one alternative basis for finding an antitrust violation. The Ninth Circuit cases, similarly, accept the intra-enterprise 
conspiracy theory but provide little analysis for the rule or define the scope of its application."
108,22," .  Where independent firms agree to fix prices, they reduce the number of economic units with market price discretion. 
Allocative inefficiency occurs where, for example, open market discretion is eliminated and firms agree to fix prices above the 
marginal cost of production, which is the level toward which prices tend to move if many firms within the market freely compete 
with each other. Section 1 should attack such agreements if they result in a decrease in the number of units with market 
discretion. Therefore, section 1 should not apply if a parent controls the day-to-day operations of its subsidiary, since the entire 
enterprise presents the market with one decision-making unit."
108,23," .  Report of the U.S. Attorney General's National Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws, supports this conclusion: The use of subsidiaries is generally dictated by normal, prudent business considerations. No social objective would be 
obtained were subsidiaries enjoined from agreeing not to compete with each other or with their parents. To demand internal 
competition between the members of a single business unit would invite chaos without promotion of the general welfare. Id.

120,*," Honorable Howard T. Markey, of the United States Court of Customs and Pattent Appeals, sitting by designation."
120,1," Counts one and four alleged violations of both § 1 and § 2 of the Sherman Act. Appellants do not press the § 2 claim on 
appeal, and we find no evidence in the record to support a finding of monopolization. "
121,2," Forstater's motions were filed on July 16 and denied on August 8, 1980.  Appellants filed their notice of appeal on July 24, 
1980.  Appellees have moved to dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction, contending that the appeal is barred by F.R.A.P. 
4(a)(4), which HN1[
] provides that ""the time for appeal for all parties shall run from the entry of the order denying a new trial or 
granting or denying"" a motion for judgment n.o.v.  The 1979 amendments to Rule 4(a) provide that ""[a] notice of appeal filed 
before the disposition of any of the above motions shall have no effect."" Appellants plainly failed to satisfy the demands of Rule 4(a).  We are reluctant to treat the default as jurisdictional, however, in 
light of the substantial forfeiture that would result and the absence of any prejudice to appellees resulting from the premature 
filing.  As Judge Van Dusen wrote for the court in Hodge v. Hodge, 507 F.2d 87, 89 (3d Cir. 1975), ""[s]o long as the order is an 
appealable one and the non-appealing party is not prejudiced by the prematurity… the court of appeals should proceed to 
decide the case on the merits rather than dismiss on the basis of such a technicality."" We have discretion under Appellate Rule 2 
to ""suspend the requirements or provisions of any of these rules in a particular case… on [our] own motion,"" and we exercise our 
discretion to waive the Rule 4(a) default in this case.  We do so ""to relieve litigants of the consequences of default where 
manifest injustice would otherwise result."" Note of Advisory Committee on Appellate Rules, 28 U.S.C.A. following Rule 2.  We 
note also that Forstater's motions could not have led to alteration of the judgments appealed from.  See id . following Rule 4 
(1979 Amendment, Note to Subdivision (a)(4)). "
122,3," Forstater, a certified public accountant since 1950, had been a full-time employee of Tose and his various enterprises from 
1966 to 1976.  He left that position sometime in 1976 to ""go into the consulting business,"" 4 App. 1012, but the continued to work 
part-time for the Eagles. "
123,4," Appellants describe the March 24 memorandum as ""one of the most remarkable documents in the history of antitrust litigation."" 
Brief for Appellants at 4.  Appellee Pemberton, who first saw the memorandum on April 6, 1977, testified that he was ""surprised"" 
and ""appalled."" He stated that ""in my mind it appeared to be an effort to be too tough on the borrower and it appeared as if the 
only way that he could comply with what I consider to be the demands would be to sell the club."" 7 App. 1615."
123,5," Hayes' March 17 memorandum recommended that Forstater be designated for this position, but Bunting instructed Hayes not 
to name Forstater in his second draft because he thought Forstater ""was working with… Tose and… [was] his best friend."" 9 
App. 2203."
123,6," Rome explained at trial that he did not want Barness to learn that FPB was planning to lend Tose money to purchase Barness' 
interest because he was concerned that Barness would then ""increase his demand as to a purchase price."" 10 App. 2474. "
124,7," Bunting also stated that he intended to ignore a written commitment to lend to the Eagles $ 1.25 million in receipts from 
advance ticket sales, which had been paid to the bank to reduce the principal of the loan and thereby to reduce interest 
payments.  The bank had agreed to relend the ticket money for the Eagles' operating expenses.  See 2 App. 288-89.  Appellants 
state that if FPB had breached this agreement, ""all Eagles checks, beginning the next day and including payroll checks to be 
issued the following Monday, would [have] bounce[d]."" Brief for Appellants at 3. "
126,8," Kline testified that on December 9 Tose indicated that he ""had a commitment at that time for refinancing,"" and that he wished 
Tose well and stated that ""if for any reason he should want to come back to Provident"" the bank would be willing to reopen 
discussions.  12 App. 3165-66. "
127,9," Appellants contend that at the end of the meeting a Chase vice-president ""said they had a deal, shook hands with Tose, among 
others, and toasted the agreement with champagne."" Brief for Appellants at 14, citing 3 App. 666-67.  The evidence cited does 
not support this contention, and we have not discovered any other evidence in the record to provide support."
127,10," The principal obstacles identified by Chase's attorneys related to Barness' right of first refusal to acquire Tose's interest in the 
Eagles, which would inhibit the marketability of Tose's interest if the bank had to foreclose, and ambiguities in the partnership 
agreement regarding transfer of the general partnership interest and appointment of a successor general partner. Counsel also 
referred to lawsuits filed aginst Tose by Barness and Firestone, the necessity for Interstate Commerce Commission approval of 
a promissory note to be given by Tose, Inc. (a trucking company), the requirement that the City of Philadelphia consent to 
assignment of the Eagles' stadium lease as security for the loan, the fact that the NFL's television contracts which were to be 
assigned as security were not yet in existence, and Tose's wife's dower interest in real property which was to be mortgaged as 
part of the loan package.  See 2 App. 493-96, 3 App. 505, 507, 509-13, 516-19, 522-26, 531."
127,11," This announcement followed a private conference of the Chase representatives.  One Chase officer ""wanted to go ahead and 
try to make it work"" but another wanted the application to ""die"" because it was ""causing too much trouble."" 3 App. 520.  The 
second officer concluded the private discussions by saying, ""As it stands right now, we are not prepared to make this loan.  
However, if you feel so strongly about it, if you can button it all up and make me happy, that [counsel] is happy, then we can talk 
about it again."" Id ."
127,12," St. Clair testified that he could not recall why he agreed to discuss the application with Duffy after twice refusing to consider 
Eagles' applications. 3 App. 706, 709-10. "
128,13," St. Clair met informally with three Girard officers on Friday, February 3, shortly before he departed for New York, and at least 
two advised him ""not to make the loan because it wasn't worthwhile all the aggravation that would occur."" 14 App. 3737.  One of 
the three testified that he ""had no enthusiasm for the proposal"" because ""[o]ver a long period of years.  Mr. Tose had developed, 
I think, a high degree of notoriety.  He appeared to me to be a contentious person and I was just not interested in considering a 
loan."" Id . 3601.  He was also unimpressed by financial statements and projections submitted by Duffy."
128,14," The district court scheduled a trifurcated trial, liability, damages and counterclaims, but omitted the trial on damages after 
granting judgment to defendants on all of appellants' claims."
128,15," Count four alleges a conspiracy to fix prices -- interest rates charged on bank loans -- in violation of § 1.  We deal with count 
four separately, in Part VI. of this opinion. "
130,16," Reiter v. Sonotone Corp ., 442 U.S. 330 (1979), and Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc ., 359 U.S. 207 (1959), are not 
to the contrary.  Reiter held that a consumer who pays a higher price for personal goods as a result of an antitrust violation (a 
conspiracy to fix prices) may sue under § 4 of the Clayton Act, which provides a treble damages remedy for ""[a]ny person who 
shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws."" (The court of appeals had held 
that § 4 only authorizes relief for injuries of a commercial or business nature.) Klor's disapproved of the so-called ""public wrong 
doctrine,"" holding that a single retailer may obtain relief for an antitrust violation (a group boycott instigated by a competing 
seller) even if the public is not denied the opportunity to buy in a competitive market.  The question of violation was not an issue 
in Reiter or Klor's .  Each plaintiff alleged conduct that had previously been designated illegal per se due to its anticompetitive 
effects.  The plaintiff in Klor's was denied the ability to compete for retail sales.  The plaintiff in Reiter was charged a higher price 
for goods because her seller had agreed with his competitors not to engage in price competition.Tose, by contrast, asserts only 
that he was damaged by a conspiracy between his banker and his limited partner to force him to sell his share of the 
partnership. Without proof that the alleged conspiracy was intended or likely to affect competition, and therefore ""forbidden in the 
antitrust laws,"" he cannot obtain relief under § 4."
130,17," Our cases make clear that HN8[
] proof of anticompetitive impact or intent is a necessary element of a prima facie case 
under the rule of reason.  See, e.g., Franklin Music Co. v. American Broadcasting Co., Inc ., 616 F.2d 528, 541-42 (1979) 
(Gibbons, J., announcing decision of the court); id . at 553-56 (Sloviter, J., concurring in part); Sitkin Smelting & Refining Co. v. 
FMC Corp ., 575 F.2d 440, 448 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 866 (1978); Martin B. Glauser Dodge Co. v. Chrysler Corp ., 570 
F.2d 72, 81 (3d Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 436 U.S. 913 (1978). Cf.  Brunswick, 429 U.S. at 489 (plaintiff must prove ""antitrust 
injury""). "
131,18," See, e.g., Card v. National Life Insurance Co ., 603 F.2d 828, 834 (10th Cir. 1979); H & B Equipment Co., Inc. v. International 
Harvester Co ., 577 F.2d 239, 244 (5th Cir. 1978); Morton Buildings of Nebraska, Inc. v. Morton Buildings, Inc ., 531 F.2d 910, 
917 (8th Cir. 1976); Greenville Publishing Co., Inc. v. Daily Reflector, Inc ., 496 F.2d 391, 399-400 (4th Cir. 1974); Chapman v. 
Rudd Paint & Varnish Co ., 409 F.2d 635, 643 & n.9 (9th Cir. 1969). "
132,19," Barness also contacted Chase about the loans, but not until after Chase had rejected the applications and communicated its 
decision to Tose.  Thus, the Barness contact adds nothing to the case against Chase. "
133,20," Not every pricing agreement between businesses is subject to the per se rule of illegality established in United States v. 
Socony-Vacuum Oil Co ., 310 U.S. 150 (1940), and United States v. Trenton Potteries Co ., 273 U.S. 392 (1927). The Supreme 
Court has recognized that cooperation among businesses in some situations is pro-competitive, and therefore in accord with the 
purposes of federal antitrust law, because two or more businesses acting together can achieve desirable ends that an 
individual business cannot.  As the Court noted in Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc ., 441 U.S. 1, 23 
(1979), ""[j]oint ventures and other cooperative arrangements are… not usually unlawful, at least not as price-fixing schemes, 
where the agreement on price is necessary to market the product at all."" Joint lending arrangements provide support for a 
vigorous economy by making possible large extensions of credit beyond the capacity of any single bank.  Cf.  United States v. 
Morgan, 118 F.Supp. 621 (S.D.N.Y. 1953) (system of syndicated underwriting of new securities to be sold at a fixed price 
schedule held a reasonable business combination with the purpose and effect of efficiently promoting trade); see generally 
United States v. Penn-Olin Chemical Co ., 378 U.S. 158 (1964). We recognize that appellants do not attack participating loans, 
but only the practice of following the lead bank's prime rate, as illegal per se .It may be that the record would preclude summary 
judgment if appellants had standing to raise this claim, because of a genuine factual question whether ""the agreement on price 
is necessary to market the product at all."" Broadcast Music, 441 U.S. at 23. Because of the view we take, however, we need not 
reach that question."
133,21," See, e.g., Weit v. Continental Illinois National Bank, Nos. 79-1077, 79-2113 (7th Cir. Feb. 11, 1981).  In an opinion affirming a 
summary judgment for defendants on charges of a bankers' conspiracy to fix the interest rate on bank credit cards at 18% per "
134,," annum, the court ""noted that parallel pricing or conduct lacks probative significance when the product in question is standardized 
or fungible,"" slip op. at 11 (citations omitted), and continued: ""In the instant case, the product in question is consumer credit, or 
more fundamentally, the cost of borrowing money for a given period.  The underlying product -- money -- is not only fungible, it is 
by definition an interchangeable medium of exchange."" Id . at 11-12.  See generally Independent Iron Works, Inc. v. United 
States Steel Corp ., 322 F.2d 656, 665 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 922 (1963); United States v. FMC Corp ., 306 F.Supp. 
1106, 1139 (E.D.Pa. 1969) (Higginbotham, J.)."
134,22, Conspiracy is not an element of a § 1972(1)(C) violation. 
135,23," We affirm the judgment in favor of Bunting and Pemberton for an additional reason.  Section 1972(1) provides that ""[a] bank 
shall not"" engage in certain conduct, but it does not forbid individual conduct.  The term ""bank"" is defined in § 1971, 
incorporating the definition found in § 1841(c) of the same title, as an ""institution…."" Further, § 1972(2)(F) expressly forbids 
certain individual conduct, which leads us to infer that Congress deliberately limited § 1972(1) to banks.Therefore, Bunting and 
Pemberton could not in any event be held liable for a violation of § 1972(1)(C)."
135,24," The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has frequently adopted sections of the Restatement (Second) of Torts as Pennsylvania 
common law when its ""common-law precedents varied from the Restatement or when the Pennsylvania common law provided 
no answer."" Gilbert v. Korvette's, Inc ., 457 Pa. 602, 611-12 n.25, 327 A.2d 94, 100 n.25 (1974) (citations omitted).  The Court 
looked to Restatement (Second) §§ 766, 766B, and 767 in establishing rules of liability for interference with existing or 
prospective contractual relations in Thompson Coal, 488 Pa. at 207-08, 412 A.2d at 470, and in Adler, Barish, 482 Pa. at 430-
34, 393 A.2d at 1183-84. We believe that if it were presented with the question the Court would adopt the ancillary rules stated in 
§§ 774A and 47 as Pennsylvania common law, so we look to those sections in fashioning rules for decision of this case. "
137,25," We note that Tose requested the court to instruct the jury regarding the existence and effect of a confidential relationship 
between the parties.  See generally Young v. Kaye, 443 Pa. 335, 342-43, 279 A.2d 759, 763 (1971). Forstater did not join in this 
request, however, and so he may not assign error to its refusal. "
142,1," .  In the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff asserts that there can be no dispute as to liability or damages and 
that he, therefore, is entitled to summary judgment. The substance of the plaintiff's brief in support of his motion for summary 
judgment centralizes on the dispute between the parties over whether or not the plaintiff can prove an antitrust injury.  Contrary 
to the suggestion made within the plaintiff's motion, however, assuming that the Court finds that the plaintiff can potentially prove 
an antitrust injury, there would remain a dispute between the parties over whether or not the defendant Cadillac has violated the 
antitrust laws. The Court, therefore, hereby denies the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and shall treat this motion as 
plaintiff's brief in opposition to the defendant's motion for summary judgment. "
143,2," .  Although the municipal court awarded judgment on all three counts of Crestmont Cadillac's complaint, where count one 
included an allegation that Rahal failed to have non-emergency repairs done at an ""authorized dealer of the make of the leased 
vehicle"", it is clear from the court's journal entry that the court did not award damages to Crestmont Cadillac for Rahal's failure to 
obtain repairs at an authorized Cadillac dealer. The court stated that no damages were asked for by Cadillac nor awarded to 
Cadillac for Rahal's failure to obtain such authorized repairs. The court's award under count one, therefore, necessarily was 
based on the court's finding that Rahal failed to maintain the leased vehicle in good repair, and/or failed to return the leased 
vehicle to Cadillac in good repair. "
145,3," .  Additionally, the Court finds that an allegation that the antitrust violation invalidates the lease so as to constitute a defense in 
the municipal court case is equally incorrect.  The municipal court holding was not based on the provision claimed to be violative 
of the antitrust laws. Also, the enforcement of the lease by the municipal court requiring the plaintiff to maintain and return the 
leased vehicle in good repair did not make that court a party to the alleged antitrust violation. The antitrust violation, therefore, 
could not have constituted a valid defense to Cadillac's suit in municipal court.  Atlantic Richfield Co. v. Malco Petroleum, Inc., 
471 F.2d 1258 (6th Cir. 1972). Consequently, the plaintiff cannot allege that the municipal court improperly enforced an invalid 
lease. "
146,4," .  The suit in California Motor was brought by the respondent Trucking Unlimited against California Motor Transport Company 
for injunctive relief and damages.  Trucking Unlimited charged California Motor with conspiring to monopolize trade and 
commerce by instituting state and federal proceedings for the purpose of resisting and defeating applications for operating rights 
by Trucking Unlimited.  The Supreme Court held that the institution of these court proceedings could constitute an antitrust "
147,," violation overriding the first amendment right to free and unlimited access of the courts, if these lawsuits were found to be an 
abuse of the judicial process and a sham to coverup antitrust violations. "

sections I and II of the federal Sherman Act to prohibit agreements in restraint of trade, monopolization, and attempts and 
conspiracies to monopolize. In using the federal language the committee intends that federal precedent under the Sherman 
Act provide a guide to the interpretation and construction of the state Act.  In particular, the committee recognizes and 
intends to adopt the federal case law under section II of the Sherman Act which requires that predatory intent be present 
before a violation of section 20 of the bill is found."

159,11," Whitney-Fidalgo argues in its brief that its 30% market share is evidence of insufficient market power for it to have a 
substantial probability of achieving monopoly status, and, therefore, it could not be guilty of attempt under the majority rule.  
Although our decision today moots the issue, we note Areeda and Turner's discussion at para. 835, pointing out that in 
jurisdictions which have adopted the majority rule a market share as low as 20% has been found sufficient for an attempt, and 
that firms with 40% and higher shares are commonly held to have enough power to be guilty of section 2 violations.  Areeda and 
Turner recommend the adoption of a rule of presumptive dismissal of all cases where the defendant's share is below 30%, and a 
presumptive finding of ""probability of success"" where the defendant's share exceeds 50% and his conduct meets certain 
requirements. "
160,12," Alaska R. Civ. P. 51(a) provides in part: No party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless he objects thereto before the jury retires 
to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which he objects and the grounds of his objection. In construing this rule we have held that where an instruction is objected to, reasons for the objection must be expressed and, on 
appeal, only those reasons will be reviewed, not others that later occur to counsel.  Nordin Constr. Co. v. City of Nome, 489 P.2d 
455, 471-72 (Alaska 1971). However, in Pepsi Cola Bottling Co. v. Superior Burner Serv. Co., 427 P.2d 833 (Alaska 1967), we 
stated: Numerous authorities have concluded that if the defective, or erroneous requested instruction directs the court's attention to 
an issue which the jury has not been instructed upon but which is necessary to enable the jury to intelligently determine the 
case, ""the court's error in failing to charge may not be excused by technical defects in a request to charge."""
160,427," P.2d at 837, quoting 2B Barron & Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1102, at 447-48 (rev. ed. 1961). "
161,13," AS 09.40.270 provides: Undertaking. A peace officer shall not take personal property into custody until the plaintiff delivers to him the affidavit and 
undertaking of sufficient sureties to the effect that they are bound in double the value of the property for the prosecution of the 
action and the return of the property to the defendant if return be adjudged, and for the payment to the defendant of any sum 
which may be recovered against the plaintiff. "
163,270," There is no doubt that this was the theme most frequently voiced by defendants' counsel throughout the issue development 
and pretrial management phases of the case. Our acceptance of the legitimacy of that plaint is embodied in a provision of 
Pretrial Order 154 which provides in P III.C: In view of the primacy of the conspiracy claims in plaintiffs' case and defendants' counterclaims, the FPS shall itemize all overt 
acts to be proved at trial. In particular, the FPS shall enumerate with specificity the facts (i. e., the evidence aliunde ) upon which 
they rely to prove that each defendant (including counterclaim defendant) or other entity knowingly joined in the alleged 
conspiracy and all facts, separately as to each defendant, upon which they rely as to each defendant's participation in the 
alleged conspiracy. Where any facts will be offered against fewer than all parties, the FPS shall identify the parties against which 
the facts are or are not offered. "
164,271," We shall not attempt here to rescribe the conclusions set forth at length in earlier segments of this opinion as to plaintiffs' 
lack of evidence of conspiracy, even though some of that discussion pertains to the Matsushita defendants. We incorporate our 
earlier discussion by reference and address here only those evidentiary matters specially relevant to the Matsushita defendants."
164,272," Quasar Electronics Corp., a fifth Matsushita defendant, is involved only in the transactions surrounding its acquisition by MEI, 
which we have discussed in Part VII.N.2, supra, and is at most a passive figure in this case. We incorporate that discussion here 
by reference, and note that there is no evidence anywhere in the record to link Quasar to the alleged conspiracy. Plaintiffs' 
meritless Clayton Act § 7 claims against Quasar are addressed in Part XI, infra. "
165,273," We note that, in any event, the portion of the Tokizane diary relied upon by plaintiffs does not advance their conspiracy 
claims. "
167,274," For example, DSS's 1267, 1268, 1269, and 1271 are MET documents identified in MET's interrogatory answers pursuant to 
Fed.R.Civ.P. 33(c). Also on plaintiffs' DSS list are Penney transactional documents which relate to these transactions, including 
a series of documents pertaining to a single purchase contract between Penney and MEI, which plaintiffs claim show a rebate 
(DSS 1240-47), along with other shipping documents (DSS 1249-1260), invoices (DSS 1249-1260; DSS 1267), credit forms 
(DSS 1268; DSS 1269-70), 90 day letters of credit (DSS 1271), shipment schedules (DSS 1272; DSS 1401); and tooling 
charges and debits to private label customers (DSS 1267). There are certain additional documents contained in DSS's 1267, 
1271, 1272, 1318, 1398-1400, and 1401 (MET 25724, 25726, and 25729) which plaintiffs allege indicate that items of value were 
given to these same private label customers. In addition, MET is alleged to have agreed to reimburse Magnavox for dumping 
duties which might be imposed. See DSS 1316."
167,275," In the Supplemental and Amended Answers of MEI and MET to Interrogatory 51 of Plaintiffs' Interrogatories to Defendants, 
Set No. 1, MET stated that it gave the following ""things of value"" to private label customers: payments totalling $ 9,000 to the 
J.C. Penney Purchasing Corporation during a portion of 1967-68; acceptance of payment from Penney by 90 day letters of credit 
from April 1969 to September 1971; and reduction or elimination of tooling charges respecting certain television purchases by 
Penney (1971-73) and Grant (1971-72)."
167,276," Supplemental Answers of MECA to Plaintiffs' Interrogatories, Set No. 1."
167,277," Other documents plaintiffs cite for this proposition are: DSS 1275; MA 31001-13; ZH-48; ZB-54; ZB-54A-G, J, L; MA 033722, 
23, 26; MA 019953-60; MA 029447, 29453, 29465, 29496, 33634, 33707; TPB 689-90. "
168,278," DSS's 1273 and 1274 were produced by MECA in response to plaintiffs' interrogatories to MECA, see interrogatory No. 51, 
which requested MECA to indicate whether it gave credit to its customers. In answer, MECA stated that ""Documents MECA has 
in its possession which are responsive to this Interrogatory have been made available for plaintiffs' inspection at MECA's 
headquarters…."" Plaintiffs argue that the format of the documents indicates that they are business records. The customer order 
numbers, model numbers, and prices in the documents were compared by Arnold Kalman, Esq., one of plaintiffs' attorneys, with 
other documents produced by defendants, see PTO 277 at 270-78. Defendants, on the other hand, state that there is no 
evidence as to who prepared any of the documents, no evidence that they were prepared in the regular course of business, no 
authentication of the documents, and that plaintiffs never took a deposition of a single MECA witness to explain the documents 
or lay foundation for their admissibility, and that they are therefore inadmissible on multiple grounds. We shall not, however, rule 
on admissibility at this time. We shall, however, note that, working with what he had, Mr. Kalman's general presentation on 
rebates was very impressive."
168,279," The evidence cited in the text could be read to create an inference of agreement between MEI and/or its trading company 
subsidiaries (MET and MECA) with respect to the granting of rebates. In fact, Mr. Brown, attorney for the Sanyo defendants, 
conceded during argument that, to the extent the Sanyo parent company knew of rebating practices, its trading subsidiaries 
shared that knowledge. This comment would apply to many of the Japanese defendants. We ignore here the pro-competitive 
aspect of the ""rebate scheme"" which we discuss at Parts VI.A(7) and VII.L., supra, which renders plaintiffs' rebate claims, insofar 
as they have evidence to support them, inoperative as a basis of liability. Rather, given the apparent knowledge of the various 
Matsushita defendants about rebates paid by various Matsushita subsidiaries, we consider the logical question whether plaintiffs 
can evade summary judgment by allegations of an intra-enterprise conspiracy within the Matsushita family. See Columbia Metal 
Culvert Co., Inc. v. Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corp., 579 F.2d 20 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 876, 99 S. Ct. 214, 58 L. 
Ed. 2d 190 (1978). The answer to this question is essentially two-fold. First, plaintiffs have never framed their Sherman Act § 1 or Wilson Tariff Act 
conspiracy claims in this fashion. To so frame them now would be antithetical to plaintiffs' posture during a decade of this 
litigation. The integrity of our case management orders prevents plaintiffs from changing their approach to their case at this late 
date. Secondly, any attempt to construct the case like the spokes of a wheel, asserting that each group of defendants is 
engaged in a separate intra-enterprise conspiracy, would be improper. See discussion of Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 
750, 66 S. Ct. 1239, 90 L. Ed. 1557 (1946) and its progeny at note 30, supra. "
169,280," For reasons explained in Part VIII.C, plaintiffs' claim that the Matsushita-Philips agreement provides an ""improper"" 15% 
discount to MEI on MEC sales of components is contrary to the otherwise monolithic theme of this litigation. The main foci of the 
MEI-Philips meetings, as reflected in the ""minutes"" cited by plaintiffs in their supplementary in limine list, were general world-
wide market trends and a study of the possibility of involving MEC in Philips research at an early stage (MIH 29339). These 
documents do not give rise to an inference of participation by MEC (or Philips) in the ""unitary"" conspiracy. Plaintiffs have 
asserted a Robinson-Patman Act claim against MEC on account of alleged price discrimination in the sale of components. This 
claim is disposed of in n.395, infra."
169,281," We shall not attempt here to rescribe the conclusions set forth at length in earlier segments of this opinion as to plaintiffs' 
lack of evidence of conspiracy, even though some of that discussion pertains to the Toshiba defendants. We incorporate our 
earlier discussion by reference and address here only those evidentiary matters specially relevant to the Toshiba defendants."
169,282," That department had no role in export matters. As Mr. T. Kamakura of Toshiba stated in his protocol: The Department of TV 
Business has a Management Section, the First TV Section, the Second TV Section, and the Business Technique Section. These 
sections exist in both Tokyo Shibaura and Toshiba Shoji and the Section Managers serve concurrently, but the staff members 
separate. The work is the same. The TV Business Department is in charge of the domestic business ; the first TV Section is in 
charge of black & white TV; and the Second TV Section is in charge of color TV. DSS 81, pp. MJ003294-2, MJ003294-2 
(emphasis added). "
170,283," We repeat that we found the testimony of all witnesses before the JFTC as to domestic matters admissible against the ""Six 
Companies""; ""export"" or ""war-chesting"" references, however, with certain exceptions not relevant to Toshiba, were excluded."
170,284," Moreover, the only reference to export in any of the Toshiba materials is contained in Mr. Kamakura's testimony, where he 
notes in response to a question concerning export pricing that export matters were ""beyond my area of responsibility,"" DSS 69, 
pp. MJ002081-1, MJ002082-1. "
171,285," This listing also applies to the other defendants. As we explained in Part V, supra, while defendants have the burden of 
showing the lack of a material factual issue, plaintiffs must come forward with ""significant probative evidence"" and cannot rest on 
their allegations."
171,286," We will treat together Hitachi, Ltd. (""Hitachi""), the parent corporation, and Hitachi Kaden Hanbai Kabushiki Kaisha (""Hitachi 
Kaden""), the domestic sales corporation. There will be brief separate consideration of Hitachi Sales Corporation of America 
(HSCA), infra. "
172,287," We shall not attempt here to rescribe the conclusions set forth at length in earlier segments of this opinion as to plaintiffs' 
lack of evidence of conspiracy, even though some of that discussion pertains to the Hitachi defendants. We incorporate our 
earlier discussion by reference and address here only those evidentiary matters specially relevant to the Hitachi defendants."
172,288," The testimony of Messrs. Adachi and Yamamoto of Hitachi contains no export references and in no respect tends to show 
Hitachi's involvement in the alleged conspiracy. It should be noted that Hitachi does not accept plaintiffs' translation of Mr. Nishi's 
testimony."
172,289," Hitachi maintains that the Shimizu memorandum, if admissible, would evidence not anti-competitive activity, but independent 
rational competitive behavior. It relies on the statement in the memorandum that Hitachi should strive for a sizeable market 
share in Japan and that Hitachi would not export until export prices went up. Moreover, the ""Memorandum of Hitachi Defendants 
Concerning Lack of Evidence Which Would Justify an Inference of Conspiracy,"" filed September 19, 1980, notes that at the time 
the Shimizu memorandum was written, Hitachi was not even involved in the export of color television receivers."
172,290," The Hitachi defendants concede the payment of rebates and highlight the evidence of rebates paid by Hitachi Sales 
Corporation of America to one U.S. buyer plaintiff NUE/Emerson. In their memorandum cited at n.289, supra, the Hitachi "
173,," defendants argue that the plaintiffs have engaged in ""unprincipled hypocrisy"" in charging that the practice of rebating could be 
an essential vehicle for carrying out the objective of the conspiracy since one of the plaintiffs was involved in that very practice. 
Additionally, they point to the rebates as demonstrating that U.S. buyers and Japanese manufacturers were independently 
acting in their economic self-interests by negotiating competitive prices in a very competitive market. They also point to the fact 
that the evidence concerning the NUE rebates demonstrates the existence of a competitive motivation to maintain the 
confidentiality of prices actually paid."
173,291," We take up together the evidence against Sanyo Electric Co., Ltd. (""Sanyo Denki"" or ""Sanyo""), the parent company; Sanyo 
Electric Trading Company, Ltd. (""Trading""), Sanyo's Japanese Trading Company; and Sanyo Electric, Inc. (""Inco""), its American 
sales subsidiary. The only allegations with regard to Sanyo Manufacturing Corp. relate to the Warwick acquisition, discussed in 
Part VII.N.3, supra. That discussion is incorporated here by reference. We shall not attempt here to rescribe the conclusions set forth at length in earlier segments of this opinion as to plaintiffs' lack of 
evidence of conspiracy, even though some of that discussion pertains to the Sanyo defendants. We incorporate our earlier 
discussion by reference and address here only those evidentiary matters specially relevant to the Sanyo defendants."
173,292," Even if that export reference were admissible as an admission against Sanyo, it would not help the plaintiffs. The reference 
(MJ002250-1 and MJ002251-1) is merely a passing one, serves Sanyo's interest, and in any event does not tend to show the 
conspiracy alleged by plaintiffs. "
174,293," Sanyo is claimed to have paid rebates to the Magnavox Company (DSS 1280 through DSS 1319, DSS 1333A and 1333C); 
to Sears Roebuck and Company (DSS 1070 to DSS 1135); to General Electric Company (DSS 1375-1378, DSS 1382, and DSS 
1074); and to several other private label and OEM customers. Sanyo does not deny the payment of rebates, the principal vehicle 
for which was the so-called ""loyalty discount"" program."
174,294," DSS 1239, Trading document No. B-1185(38)-(41), Trading document No. B-1106, Sanyo INCO document No. ZSX-0247, 
Trading document B-1113(4)-(9), and INCO document No. ZSX-0134 (the latter documents were contained in plaintiffs' 
postargument submissions, though not given the stature of DSS's) all corroborate Sanyo's contention of competitive conditions, 
with each of the Japanese defendants responding to market conditions, including price competition from other Japanese 
companies, in an attempt to get American private label and OEM business. They also reflect a policy of not disclosing rebates to 
competitors."
174,295," Sanyo also points out that DePodwin's analysis examines only factory data, not overall company data, and ignores the data 
concerning Trading, the company which exported products manufactured by Denki. Sanyo observes that DePodwin's finding that 
the Gifu plant was not profitable during the six month fiscal term ending in November 1969 fails to highlight that that was the first 
year of Gifu's operation, and that it turned a profit in 1970, the first full year of its operation, bringing it in line with the rest of 
Sanyo's profitable operation."
174,296," Plaintiffs rely in this regard on DSS's 1236 and 1237 and a number of other documents. The Sanyo defendants take 
umbrage at DSS 1237, pointing out that plaintiffs therein misrepresented a monetary exchange-rate loss for an operating loss 
and overstated the figures at issue by a factor of a thousand by confusing a yen sign for a dollar sign. Although plaintiffs also rely 
heavily on DSS 1236 as demonstrating the existence of dumping and predatory pricing, we find it susceptible of no such 
interpretation. Rather, assuming admissibility of the document, it reflects the competitive desire of Sanyo to turn around the loss 
it was incurring as an entrant in a market as soon as possible. Viewing DSS 1236 as a whole (including the memo from Mr. 
Tachibana of Sanyo to Mr. Yano of INCO, together with the various attachments in the folder), we find indications only of 
competition, not of conspiracy. In any event, a fair reading does not support plaintiffs' statement that the document ""made clear 
that the penetration of the … market was a consequence of Sanyo's and its co-defendants' massive and widespread predatory 
dumping … and was achieved only at substantial sales losses."" "
175,297," We address in this segment plaintiffs' evidence against both Sharp Corporation (formerly Hayakawa Electric Company, Ltd.), 
one of the Japanese manufacturing defendants, and its American sales subsidiary, Sharp Electronics Corporation (SEC). We shall not attempt here to rescribe the conclusions set forth at length in earlier segments of this opinion as to plaintiffs' lack of 
evidence of conspiracy, even though much of that discussion pertains to the Sharp defendants. We incorporate our earlier 
discussion by reference and address here only those evidentiary matters specially relevant to the Sharp defendants."
175,298," It is useful to comment on plaintiffs' offer of DSS 1141 as evidence of Sharp's participation in the conspiracy. That document, 
produced by Montgomery Ward, reflects a meeting between Mr. A. Saeki and Mr. Y. Fukao of Sharp and Mr. R.A. Noreen of 
Ward. It is apparently offered by plaintiff as evidence of collusive rebate activity. Leaving aside the serious questions of 
admissibility (one problem is that the document gives only Mr. Noreen's impression of what Sharp's officials said), at best the 
document reflects a rebate arrangement between sellers and buyers, each acting in their own best interests. To the extent that 
the document could be read to give rise to an inference of customs fraud, we note again that that does not help the plaintiffs. "
176,299," Mr. Fukao, who states that he has personal knowledge of the pricing of Sharp's export CEPs, flatly denies that any 
agreement among competitors ever affected Sharp's export pricing decisions. (P 4). He avers that no communications or 
discussions at any of the meetings alleged by plaintiffs or otherwise ever entered into Sharp's export pricing decisions. (Id. PP 4-
8). The Fukao Affidavit states that not only did Sharp set its own export prices and run its own business independently of any of 
the defendants and alleged coconspirators, but also that export CEP prices at Sharp were determined without regard to 
domestic profits, were set at a profit-maximizing level, and in fact consistently resulted in a positive contribution to Sharp's 
profits. (P 4). Additionally, the Fukao Affidavit denies that Sharp's export prices or practices were predatory or that they were 
ever intended to be so. (PP 10-11)."
176,300," In July 1980, MSI changed its corporate name to Mitsubishi Electric Sales America, Inc. (MESA). However, we refer to it 
throughout as MSI."
176,301," We shall not attempt here to rescribe the conclusions set forth at length in earlier segments of this opinion as to plaintiffs' 
lack of evidence of conspiracy, even though some of that discussion pertains to Melco. We incorporate our earlier discussion by 
reference and address here only those evidentiary matters specially relevant to the Melco defendants."
176,302," Although none of the diaries seized by the JFTC which plaintiffs have sought to introduce were written by Melco employees, 
during the discovery period there was much controversy about the diary of Mr. T. Kiuchi, a Melco employee. While the extent to 
which the plaintiffs advance Mr. Kiuchi's diary as evidence of conspiratorial activity is not clear, having read the diary in 
translation we are satisfied that it does not aid plaintiffs' case one iota. It is a personal diary which lists Mr. Kiuchi's golf dates 
and social engagements as well as business meetings, and which does not give any substantive information about any of the 
entries. The plaintiffs seek to draw inferences from such items as Mr. Kiuchi's dinner appointment with Mr. ""Super"" Yamaguchi, 
once a Melco employee who became the president of MSI at its inception in 1974. The dinner apparently occurred at the 
Yoshida Restaurant on April 10, 1968 in company with several other Melco employees. We do not have the faintest notion what "
177,," occurred at this dinner, and, as we have seen, mere meetings among individuals, even those affording the opportunity to 
conspire, cannot create an inference of conspiracy."
177,303," Melco's briefs in this area have been devoted to both substantive and evidentiary issues, including vigorous attacks upon the 
admissibility of such questionable submissions as the Gambles Import Corporation ""Voluntary Disclosure Statement"" (DSS 
1166)."
177,304," In addition to Melco's total ownership of Melco USA, Inc. and that subsidiary's total ownership of MSI, plaintiffs also counter 
with loans and loan guarantees from Melco to MSI, and numerous documents reflecting the personal and business relationship 
between the operating officers of MSI and Melco officials with respect to the operation of MSI's business."
177,305," Yoshito Yamaguchi, President of MSI, has also filed an affidavit on the nature of a general denial of plaintiffs' allegations 
against MSI."
177,306," Melco unsuccessfully sought mandamus relief from Judge Higginbotham's order. In the absence of appellate review, Melco, 
of course, preserves the issue. Although we have held Judge Higginbotham's findings on the preliminary issues not binding on 
the merits, insofar as personal jurisdiction, venue, and service of process are concerned his decision is the ""law of the case."" 
Additionally, Melco, alone among the defendants, has attacked the subject matter jurisdiction of the court. See Opinion 
(Introduction to Summary Judgment Motions; Subject Matter Jurisdiction), 494 F. Supp. 1161 (E.D.Pa.1980)."
177,307," Melco is primarily a manufacturer of heavy electrical equipment, automotive electric equipment, elevators, radar, computers, 
and aerospace equipment. CEPs which are sold in Japan and then exported for resale to the U.S. constitute an extremely small 
percentage of Melco's total sales (from 1966 to 1976, this percentage never exceeded 1% of Melco's total sales). Moreover, 
from 1965 to 1973, Melco's share of Japanese television receiver exports to America never exceeded 3.53% of monochrome "
178,," television receivers and 5.52% of color television receivers. During that period, Melco's sales never achieved even 1% of the 
total sales of monochrome or color TV receivers on the American market."
178,308," Akira Shirado, Manager of Foreign Trade Matters for Melco, has filed an affidavit denying such a relationship between Melco 
and MIC, as well as making a general denial of conspiratorial activity. Buichi Mochida, Manager, International Contract 
Administration Department of Melco, has filed a similar affidavit denying conspiratorial activity and denying the existence of any 
""Mitsubishi Group."""
178,309," Resolving the questions would require discussion of hundreds of documents which bear on the issues and the treatment of 
dozens of legal arguments encapsulated in hundreds of pages of briefs. We would have to consider, inter alia, the issues of 
Melco's relationship with MC/MIC, Melco's alleged involvement with the establishment of the ESD Group within MIC, the issue of 
the ""Mitsubishi Group,"" and a host of evidentiary questions."
178,310," Plaintiffs have alleged that the motions of Melco, MSI, MC, and MIC must be dismissed for discovery abuse. While alleged 
discovery misconduct will be the subject of a separate phase of these proceedings and monetary sanctions will be awarded if 
deemed appropriate, the abuse alleged here is not a proper basis for denial of the summary judgment motions."
178,311," We shall not attempt here to rescribe the conclusions set forth at length in earlier segments of this opinion as to plaintiffs' 
lack of evidence of conspiracy, even though some of that discussion pertains to Sony. We incorporate our earlier discussion by 
reference and address here only those evidentiary matters specially relevant to the Sony defendants. "
179,312," For example, Sony was not a member of the Tenth Day Group, Palace Group, Okura Group, Palace Preparatory Group, or 
Twentieth Day Group."
179,313," We held the initial Sony argument separately from the others because of our perception that there were ""distinguishing"" 
factors, see discussion infra. "
180,314," NUE has contended that Sony's pricing at the retail level is ""a small part of the story,"" because ""Sony's wholesale level 
pricing, together with the retail pricing of its products define the profit margin of the dealers who handle Sony television 
receivers, and Emerson competed with Sony for sales to such dealers and distributors."" (NUE brief in opposition to Sony motion 
for summary judgment at p. 75). However, this assertion by counsel in a brief is not accompanied by any evidence of ""wholesale 
level pricing"" comparing Sony and Emerson television sets, and accordingly, Sony's posture as a high price seller remains 
uncontradicted. Not only are the allegations about Sony's pricing uncontradicted, but Sony's allegations about Emerson's 
location in the ""low leader"" end of the market are likewise uncontradicted."
180,315," We will not dignify by extended comment what we will dub plaintiffs' ""smorgasbord"" theory of conspiracy. Under that view, 
the ends of the conspiracy were served by the inclusion of both high and low price sellers. "
181,316," For a description of the pre-war Japanese zaibatsu, see Part VII.C, supra. The Mitsubishi zaibatsu was one of the most 
prominent zaibatsus. "
182,317," MC apparently attended the JMEA meetings at which the television and radio export control rules were adopted, and plaintiff 
asserts that MC ""assented"" to their adoption. Even if plaintiffs had offered evidence of MC's ""assent"" (they have not), they could 
not complain about what are minimum price agreements for the reasons we have explained in Part VI.B, supra. With respect to 
MC's attendance at meetings of the Transistor Radio Export Examination Committee and three departments of the Electric 
Home Appliance Department of JMEA, we note that plaintiffs have adduced no evidence that MC attended any specific meeting 
or evidence of what transpired at any meeting. We cannot assume that MC personnel attended specific meetings or that 
anticompetitive agreements were reached at those meetings, or that MC entered into them, or that MC carried out acts pursuant 
to them, or that any such acts were directed at and caused antitrust injury to plaintiffs. We note again that plaintiffs might have 
attempted to establish such matters by discovery, but elected not to do so. Plaintiffs' allegations that MIC is responsible for 
certain pre- and post-employment conduct of certain employees is patently baseless and requires no further comment. MIC has 
not admitted membership in the Japan Light Machinery Information Center. Although that would make no difference, see Part 
VII.G.3, supra, the allegation of membership is not borne out by the record."
182,318," We have reviewed plaintiffs' objections to the affidavits of MC and MIC. Those four affidavits, which deny all of plaintiffs' 
allegations, in actuality are unnecessary because of plaintiffs' failure to meet their burden to advance significant probative 
evidence to controvert defendants' well-pleaded motion. We rely herein upon the non-controversial aspects of the affidavits, 
noting that, as to those, plaintiffs' objections are unavailing. "
183,319," Plaintiffs also charge that MC and MIC's alleged invoicing at MITI check prices constitutes evidence from which their 
participation in the alleged manufacturers' conspiracy may be inferred. FPS at 3458-59. This argument is baseless. First, the 
record is clear that MC and MIC had no role in establishing the check price system. Second, for reasons explained above, 
neither MC and MIC's adherence to check prices nor to the Five Company Rule (also complained of with respect to MC and 
MIC) could have injured plaintiffs."
183,320," Plaintiffs rely in part on DSS 1231, a telex whose author is unknown, which has no addresses, and with respect to which no 
discovery was taken. It is unauthenticated and inadmissible as hearsay under the standards established in the Japanese 
Materials Evidentiary Opinion, notwithstanding its mode of production. The plaintiffs also rely on a double hearsay statement that 
""Gamble saying our basic price be quoted on basis 10 pct. less from check prices"" to prove that MIC ""was a party to defendants', 
particularly Melco's, continual sales below check prices."" But even assuming admissibility arguendo, the document does not 
establish that sales below check prices were consummated, or that MIC was a ""party"" to other defendants' sales, or that such 
sales were continual. For all that appears, if MC and MIC were ""parties"" to another defendant's sales of private label products, it 
was in their capacity as buyers. Moreover, plaintiffs' interpretation of the telex is strained, converting a general reference to a ""5 
pct. price reduction for 1970"" into a specific one, referable to MC and Melco without any discernible basis. Plaintiffs also charge that MC and MIC ""facilitated"" a rebate transaction and reference a certain agreement to sell Melco TVs to 
Amcrest Corporation (AMC), a large retail service company. Plaintiffs purport to explain the transaction at pp. 6869-73 of their 
FPS. The entire account of the transaction is based on documents; no depositions were taken to explain what really occurred. In 
any event, while the transaction in question might well have involved a Melco rebate had it been consummated (according to the 
FPS at 6873 it was ultimately cancelled), plaintiffs' account is at best unclear as to MC and MIC's roles, and we can only 
speculate. DSS 1164, also relied upon by plaintiff, relating to alleged rebates to Midland International Corp. in 1969, is equally cryptic, and 
neither the author nor the recipient of the document was ever deposed. Its admissibility has not been established within the 
strictures of the Japanese Materials Evidentiary Opinion. Finally, plaintiffs' allegation about the cooperative advertising program fails because the documents on which plaintiffs rely 
contain no reference to Melco or to communication between MIC and Melco about the program and because the program clearly 
did not involve a rebate, but rather a genuine cooperative advertising program of a type that is generally considered to be pro-
competitive."
183,321," Plaintiffs also claim that losses incurred by MIC's MGA Division for 1970-74 were ""due to Melco and MIC's arbitrary pricing 
with the intent to predatorily take over the U.S. CEP market."" The losses are conceded, but plaintiffs' ascription of cause is pure 
speculation. Plaintiffs have offered no evidence that Melco controlled or even influenced MIC's resale price in the U.S. market, 
nor may predatory intent be inferred from losses by a new entrant in a highly competitive market. There is no evidence of a later 
price increase to reap monopoly profits. Finally, MIC sold its MGA division, serving its own self-interest, instead of acting 
contrary to that interest by continuing to sustain losses. "
184,322," Plant visits among even horizontal competitors fail to give rise to any inference of conspiracy. United States v. National 
Malleable & Steel Castings Co., 6 F.2d 40 (6 Cir. 1957), aff'd per curiam, 358 U.S. 38, 79 S. Ct. 39, 3 L. Ed. 2d 44 (1958). 
Therefore, visits by a customer to one of its suppliers' plants a fortiori cannot imply that the manufacturer informed the customer 
about a manufacturers' conspiracy."
184,323," Plaintiffs have relied upon, but have not clarified, the significance of Melco employees' temporary use of MIC office space in 
the United States. Apparently, those matters are offered to show that MC and MIC had contacts with Melco which, in turn, was 
allegedly a member of trade association committees to which MC did not belong. These informal office sharing arrangements 
provide no evidence that MC or MIC knew of the alleged manufacturers' conspiracy. At most, office sharing represents only 
opportunities for disclosure, not positive evidence of it.  Hunt v. Mobil Oil Corp., 465 F. Supp. 195 (S.D.N.Y.1978), aff'd, 610 F.2d 
806 (2d Cir. 1979). Plaintiffs have elected not to depose MC and MIC employees regarding the substantive nature of any 
contacts between MC and Melco as a result of their office sharing arrangements, and thus have failed to offer any evidence 
relating to such contacts. Moreover, MIC has denied that it learned of any alleged manufacturers' conspiracy as a result of these 
office sharing contacts (Tadatoshi Kitayama Affidavit at 7-8 and 11, PP 21 and 27 (Exhibit B)). Plaintiffs have also failed to 
connect the timing of the office sharing periods to any event significant to the alleged conspiracy."
184,324," Nifty Foods Corp. v. The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, Inc., 614 F.2d 832 (2d Cir. 1980); Fuchs Sugars & Syrups, 
Inc. v. Amstar Corp., 602 F.2d 1025 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 917, 100 S. Ct. 232, 62 L. Ed. 2d 172 (1979); Pitchford v. "
185,," Pepi, Inc., 531 F.2d 92 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 426 U.S. 935, 96 S. Ct. 2649, 49 L. Ed. 2d 387 (1976); Klein v. American Luggage 
Works, Inc., 323 F.2d 787 (3d Cir. 1963); Edward J. Sweeney & Sons, Inc. v. Texaco, Inc., 478 F. Supp. 243 (E.D.Pa.1979), 
aff'd, 637 F.2d 105 (3d Cir. 1980). A fortiori, such discussions cannot implicate the customer in a broader horizontal conspiracy 
among manufacturers."
185,325," We do note, however, that plaintiffs' interlocking directors' claim is incredibly strained. Plaintiffs rely on the presence of one 
Melco officer on a 43 to 47 person MC board. This approach is not, however, nearly as strained as that contained in DSS 32, 
initially offered in the in limine hearings but then withdrawn. That document was a staff study prepared by the Subcommittee on 
Reports, Accounting and Management of the U. S. Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs entitled ""Interlocking Directorates 
Among the Major U. S. Corporations."" Plaintiffs' proposed use of that study proceeded from its incredibly expansive definition of 
indirect interlocking directorates which is said to occur: when each of the two companies has a director on the board of a third or intermediate company, or conversely where the third 
company has a director on the boards of each of the two companies. In such situations, there is also the opportunity for direct 
communication and shared knowledge between the first and second company, even though they are indirectly, rather than 
directly, interlocked. The staff report includes many thousands of pages somewhere amidst which it is apparently indicated that a director of Sears, 
Roebuck or a director of Motorola served on another board on which a director of Montgomery Ward or J. C. Penney or some 
other U. S. importer apparently served. The point of the matter, in plaintiffs' aborted submission, was that this ""indirect interlock"" 
showed that Sears or Motorola were linked with the other coconspirators."
185,326," We incorporate by reference what we said at n. 310, supra with respect to plaintiffs' claim that MC and MIC's motions must 
be denied on the ground of their alleged discovery abuse."
185,327," Plaintiffs have no evidence of Sears' direct involvement in any activities in Japan, such as participation in export control 
arrangements or presence at meetings of ""conspiratorial groups."" In paragraph 17 of plaintiffs' counterclaim joining Sears, an 
allegation is made (and Sears' reply admits) that certain Sears catalog merchandise is offered for sale to the public in Japan by 
the Seibu department store chain, and that such merchandise does not include the television sets made in Japan which are 
offered to Sears' U. S. catalog customers. Paragraph 17 of the Counterclaim alleges, and Sears' Reply denies, that Sears 
withholds such television sets from sale in Japan in order to avoid disrupting the alleged price fixing conspiracy and cartel 
maintained there by Japanese television manufacturers. "
186,," The FPS contains no evidence that Sears consciously assisted a high price cartel in Japan. Indeed, at page 3445, the FPS 
acknowledges Sears' attempts to market television sets in Japan, and cites the Nehmer Report which, at page IV-18, discusses 
the ""exclusion of Sears,"" asserting that, ""Sanyo and Toshiba were not allowing any sales of their television receivers through 
Sears into the Japanese market …."" However, the record reveals that what kept Sears' television receivers off the Japanese 
market was the nature of the merchandise and of the Japanese market. The contract between Sears and Seibu, identified in an 
affidavit of Mr. Norris, who was in charge of Sears' catalogue sales program with Seibu, provides that the Sears catalog 
merchandise to be offered for sale by Seibu in Japan is to be limited to ""… those items displayed in a Sears catalog which 
SEARS, after consultation with (SEIBU), determines are (2) readily saleable or adaptable for sale in Japan…."" It is undisputed 
that the sets manufactured for Sears in Japan have tuners which will not receive a substantial portion of the television 
transmission in Japan and require power supplies which would result in the sets probably not receiving any picture at all in 
Japan, let alone a satisfactory one. Zenith's Mr. Horn, in his deposition, admitted that a Sears set could not in good conscience 
be recommended for use in Japan, and Zenith conceded through its highest ranking officer, Mr. Nevin, that Sears would need 
television sets with different electronics for sale in Japan than those it bought for sale in the United States. See generally 
Opinion (1916 Antidumping Act), 494 F. Supp. 1190 at 1204, et seq. It is thus undisputed that Sears' television sets were not 
saleable in Japan. Moreover, Norris explained that direct delivery to customers in Japan of merchandise which Sears purchased 
there and did not first remove from that country would have caused Sears to lose the exemption from Japanese taxes which its 
Japanese buying office enjoys and which, in Mr. Norris' judgment, would have more than offset any profits Sears might have 
earned by such activity. The short of it is that there are innocent and logically compelling reasons why Sears television sets were never sold by Seibu. 
Assuming, but by no means conceding, that all the Japanese manufacturers were conspiring in their ""home market"" as Zenith 
alleges, it is illogical to suppose that they either sought or received Sears' acquiescence or assistance, for they would have 
required neither. All they would have needed to do was to refuse to supply Sears with television sets which would operate 
satisfactorily in Japan."
186,328," Although plaintiffs have made some generalized allegations about the involvement of Sears in connection with non-TV 
products, the preclusive FPS contains no cognizable evidence of it."
186,329," Much stress is placed by Zenith upon the fact that, on February 26, 1980, a federal grand jury in the Central District of 
California indicted Sears on charges of customs fraud arising out of the ""rebate scheme"" discussed at such length in this 
opinion. That case is still pending. Zenith's allegations in this regard are not mere litigation rhetoric; they are tinged with 
bitterness. Zenith devotes some ten pages of its Supplemental Reply Memorandum in Opposition to the Motion for Summary 
Judgment (filed Aug. 11, 1980), to detailing the charges in the indictment and listing the alleged conspirators, most of whom are 
Sears, Sanyo, and Toshiba merchandising personnel. "
187,330," We observe that, despite challenge, the plaintiffs have failed to lay the foundation for the admission of these documents as 
business records under the F.R.E. 803(6) standards enunciated in our Japanese Materials Evidentiary Opinion; they thus cannot 
be admitted against all parties. Many of the documents, however, are doubtless admissible against Sears or against the 
company employing the author of the documents in the rare case when that company is a defendant."
187,331," Part of Zenith's claim against Sears is based on Sears' alleged knowledge that the probable result of the Japanese 
defendants' pricing policies would be the demise of U.S. CEP manufacturers. However, the principal evidence offered to support 
this claim, Sears document 4955, a memorandum written by a Mr. Amato, formerly the head of Sears' home entertainment 
purchasing department (and now deceased), does not do so. The memorandum on its face, and taken in its historical context, is 
at best highly ambiguous, especially in terms of its identification of the ""casualties,"" who may have been smaller Japanese 
manufacturers, not U.S. manufacturers. The allegation is not otherwise supported."
187,332," We include all the oft-mentioned ""Ex. Hall"" documents, even assuming their admissibility. "
188,333," We also note that the Japanese television sets were of undisputably better quality and availability than those which Sears 
had been procuring for years from Warwick, so that it was in Sears' interest to purchase them from its Japanese rather than its 
American suppliers. See Part VII.N.3, supra."
188,334," We note that Zenith's president, Mr. Nevin, testified that it was unrealistic to believe that Sears could substantially increase 
its market share (except ""through prayer""). In any event, there are numerous indications, see pp. 1232-1233, supra, that Zenith 
had precisely the same intention."
188,335," Plaintiffs have pointed to losses incurred by Sanyo, Sears' supplier, and Sears as evidence of conspiratorial activity. We 
have addressed the matter of Sanyo's ""losses"" in Part VII.Q.5, supra. We do not dwell on Sears' alleged losses because there is 
no evidence (and no evidence from which it can be inferred) that any losses incurred by Sears in the CEP field were either 
deliberate or prolonged."
188,336," Sears notes that, in this respect, the FPS relies largely upon testimony and documents obtained by depositions of non-Sears' 
witnesses at a time prior to Sears' joinder in this litigation. Sears argues that these matters are therefore inadmissible against 
Sears under F.R.Civ.P. 32(a). In view of our conclusion, we need not address this argument. "
189,337," Sears describes all of the meetings discussed in the FPS. For example, the first two meetings a June 2, 1970 meeting of 
representatives of Sears, other retail merchants, and certain Japanese manufacturers, and a June 4, 1970 meeting of attorneys 
for certain members of the National Retail Merchants Association, including Sears are asserted by Sears to be ""innocuous as a 
matter of law."" Sears also refers to a July 2, 1970 meeting of representatives of the National Retail Merchants Association, 
including the President of Sears, with Treasury Secretary Kennedy, seeking to persuade him to take certain action in the 
conduct by his Department of the television dumping investigation, as quintessentially the type of activity specifically immunized 
from antitrust attack by the Pennington decision."
189,338, Motorola is a defendant only in the Zenith case; NUE never stated a claim against Motorola.
189,339," See discussion at p. 1247, supra, which suggests that they were. Even Zenith's witnesses testified that the U.S. 
manufacturers have known about the check prices for years."
189,340," DSS 1178 is an internal Motorola memorandum which plaintiffs submit establishes the existence of the overall conspiracy. It 
does not. Moreover, plaintiffs laid no foundation for the admission of the document as a business record, and it contains multiple 
hearsay. Neither is Motorola's knowledge of the ""unitary conspiracy"" established by DSS 1173, produced from Motorola's files, 
which is entitled ""Highlights of Far East Trip, 1964."" Zenith has offered the document as a business record, as an admission 
against Motorola, and under the residual hearsay exceptions as evidence that Motorola participated with the defendants in the 
conspiracy, or at least that it had knowledge of the conspiracy. What is apparently of greatest interest to plaintiff is a notation in 
that document that a MITI representative was reported to have pounded hard on the theme that Japanese companies doing 
business in the United States should not ""do to the U.S. TV business what (they) did in portable radios."" Zenith is apparently 
also interested in the general information contained in the document about the condition of the TV manufacturing business in 
Japan. Supposedly the trip report was prepared by Paul Stancik, Motorola's Director of Purchasing, but his deposition was never 
taken (although he was once subpoenaed and has always been available). Mr. Haberstich, a Motorola purchasing agent and 
presumably a key witness, testified at his deposition that he had never seen the document, and that he did not know whether Mr. 
Stancik went to Japan in 1964, whether Stancik had ever visited MITI, or whether anyone else at Motorola had ever visited MITI. 
When this document is measured against the standards outlined in the Japanese Materials Evidentiary Opinion, it is 
inadmissible. However, even if the document were admissible, nothing therein constitutes evidence tending to show that 
Motorola was aware of the ""unitary"" conspiracy alleged by the plaintiffs. Even if one assumes that Motorola is charged with 
knowledge of a radio conspiracy (and there is no such evidence) such an inference cannot be drawn. Plaintiffs' trenchant and 
repeated reliance on documents of this character is indicative of the problems with their case."
189,341," This reference, typical of plaintiffs' strained arguments, is from DSS 1173. "
190,342," It is undisputed that Motorola sent a separate form of letter to the local collector of customs explaining the difference between 
the MITI check price and the actual selling price and requesting that the sets be appraised at the actual selling price. The 
plaintiffs contend that this was not ""telling all."" Resolution of this factual dispute is unimportant to the outcome here. Neither is it 
necessary to discuss the ramifications of the suit which Motorola filed against U.S. Customs in the United States Customs Court 
articulating Motorola's position that the duty should have been assessed at the price MSCL actually paid, i. e., price less rebate."
190,343," It bears noting in this regard that the purchase from Sharp referred to above was Motorola's only purchase of Japanese color 
television receivers, rendering Motorola's purchases insignificant in comparison with total television imports from Japan."
190,344," Zenith's arguments about Motorola's complicity stem from its allegations about the existence of ""reciprocal arrangements"" 
supposedly executed in connection with the sale which, according to Zenith, involved ""shared, mutual, cross and corresponding 
transfers of inventions, technological information, technological know-how, buy and/or sell agreements, or cooperative marketing 
and sales agreements"" for semiconductors and solid state devices, products which are not involved in this litigation. Zenith has 
adduced no facts to support the ""reciprocal arrangements"" theory. Under oath, both Motorola and MEI have denied such 
arrangements. Moreover, Motorola's semiconductor sales to MEI have declined significantly. In any event, this allegation, even if 
it were to be fleshed out, does not create a logical inference of conspiracy. Motorola had no motive to join a conspiracy to 
destroy American CEP manufacturers in return for prospective semiconductor business with MEI, given that Motorola, as is 
conceded, already had an active semiconductor product business with the U.S. CEP industry. "
191,345, Zenith does allege that Alps and Motorola executives met in Japan to discuss a tape equipment dumping complaint.
191,346," In fact, Zenith was AMI's best CEP customer, the largest U.S. importer of AMI's tape equipment. As the primary importer of 
AMI products, Zenith is hardly in a position to claim that AMI conspired to flood the United States with artificially low-priced 
products, because in accord with Zenith's theory, that would make Zenith one of the conspirators!"
191,347," Zenith considered plans to establish a manufacturing facility in Japan through a joint venture with a Japanese firm. Instead, it 
opened its own production facility in Taiwan. Moreover, in 1972, Zenith explored the possibility of marketing its television 
receivers in Japan, and discussed a joint venture with C. Itoh, a large Japanese trading company. Motorola asserts that it is 
""incongruous"" for Zenith to criticize Motorola for its joint venture with AMI in light of the fact that in February, 1977, Zenith 
entered into a joint venture with defendant Sony under which Zenith would market in the U.S. Sony's ""Betamax"" video cassette 
recorders. We shall not comment on this allegation."
191,348," Motorola was involved in other joint ventures. Its principal venture was an agreement, entered into in 1973, to market U.S. 
made large-screen color television receivers in Japan through AIWA, a subsidiary of Sony in Japan. Shortly before its U.S. 
television business was sold to MEI, Motorola terminated the agreement and paid Sony $ 250,000 in settlement. This aspect of 
the matter is discussed supra in Part VII.N.2. Additionally, Motorola had a 100% owned subsidiary in Japan, Motorola Semi-
Conductor Japan, Ltd. (MSJL) and also held a 50% interest in Alps-Motorola Semiconductor, Ltd. (AMSK). MSJL, which was in 
business between 1968 and mid-1973, sold only semiconductors, primarily manufactured in the United States and exported to 
Japan. AMSK, formed in 1973 when Alps-Electric purchased a 50% interest in MSJL, made an abortive attempt to manufacture 
semiconductors in Japan. Neither MSJL nor AMSK sold anything outside Japan, nor exported anything for sale in the United 
States. "
193,349," Our review of the record suggests that, in some cases, we might have found there was sufficient closeness or dominance in 
the relationship to charge the parent with the acts of the subsidiary. (We do not believe that the principle operates in reverse.)"
193,350," Coconspirator statements, of course, must also have been made in furtherance of the conspiracy."
193,350," A In making this finding we have considered the letter of February 4, 1980, from William H. Roberts, Esq., one of plaintiffs' 
counsel, in response to our request for a listing of the categories of plaintiffs' evidence aliunde. That letter listed the following 
categories, all of which we have addressed herein."
193,1, . Cartel Agreements Entered into by the Japanese Manufacturers of Consumer Electronic Products.
193,2, . The Rules of Japan Machinery Exporters' Association Which Implemented the Cartel Agreements.
193,3, . The Activities of the Defendants in Various Groups and Associations.
193,4," . The Activities of Defendants in the Japan Light Machinery Information Center, New York, New York."
193,5," . The Evidence Before the Fair Trade Commission of Japan, Case No. 6, 1966, Against Sanyo and Five Others."
193,6," . Defendants' Agreement to Allocate the United States Market by Establishing the Five Company Rule and the Registration of 
Trademarks."
193,7, . Schemes to Fraudulently Conceal Evidence of Their Collusive Conduct.
193,8," . Findings of the Fair Trade Commission of Japan in 1957 Against the ""Market Stabilization Council"" and its Participants."
193,9, . Findings of the United States Treasury Department and of the United States International Trade Commission.
193,10," . The Inference to Be Drawn from Parallel, Interdependent Rebating Schemes in Which Defendants and Their Co-conspirators 
Participated."
193,11," . The Inferences to be Drawn from Activities and Meetings of Groups and Associations at Which Complete, Regular 
Information Exchanges Took Place."
193,12," . The Inferences to Be Drawn from Evidence of Knowledge of Defendants' Concerning Export Systems, Including Rebating 
Schemes of Other Defendants and Co-Conspirators. "
194,13," . The Inferences to Be Drawn from Similar Conduct by Defendants in Selling Consumer Electronic Products in the United 
States at Prices Substantially Lower than Prices in Japan and at Below Cost."
194,14," . The Inference to Be Drawn from Uniform and Consistent Loss of Money by Japanese Manufacturers' United States 
Subsidiaries."
194,15, . The Inference from Jointly Expressed Intent by Defendants and Their Co-conspirators.
194,16, . The Sealing Off of the Japanese Home Market from Foreign Competition.
194,17, . The Pattern of Take-overs and Acquisitions.
194,18, . Defendants' Discriminatory Pricing of Consumer Electronic Products to Customers in the United States. 
197,351," Obviously, in the absence of the ""unitary"" conspiracy claim, we would not be considering allegations of conduct in Japan 
affecting only the Japanese market. See generally Opinion (Subject Matter Jurisdiction), 494 F. Supp. 1161 (E.D.Pa.1980)."
197,352," Plaintiffs have also offered a number of basic background matters: (1) an explanation that the Japanese CEP industry has 
been built on borrowed (mostly U.S.) technology (Part VII.B); (2) a description of various patent licensing arrangements entered 
into by the Japanese manufacturing defendants with U.S. firms (Part VII.B); and (3) an exegesis of the factors which have all but 
closed the Japanese domestic CEP market to foreign competition, supposedly making it possible for the Japanese 
manufacturing defendants to carry out the home market aspect of the ""unitary"" conspiracy (Part VII.C). None of these factors are 
even remotely conspiratorial. Plaintiffs also rely upon the ""combined economic power of the defendants and their cartel"" (VII.E), 
but that ""puts the rabbit in the hat."" The fact that defendants are large firms, with huge assets, high sales, and great economic 
power is no basis for inferring a conspiracy. "
198,353," For the most part the documents to which we now refer were not submitted for our consideration at the pretrial evidentiary 
hearings. We observe that they suffer the same flaws as the evidence excluded at those hearings, but we have nonetheless 
assumed their admissibility."
198,354, Many of the documents represented in the FPS as referring to export shipments refer in actuality to domestic shipments.
198,355," Plaintiffs' premise that the defendants had allocated the U.S. market via the Five Company Rule and that they were acting in 
concert in the U.S. market only against the U.S. CEP manufacturers and not against each other is fatally flawed for lack of 
supportive evidence. See discussion at n. 72 and p. 1213, supra. "
199,356," Plaintiffs also say that there were artificially low prices, but it appears that what makes the price artificially low is the mere 
fact that it will get the sale. "
200,357," We have found it unnecessary to decide whether the Manufacturers' Agreements, which establish the check prices, were 
compelled by the Japanese government, or whether the sovereign compulsion, act of state, or international comity doctrines are 
bases for non-liability."
200,358," Concomitantly, a number of techniques were employed to conceal the rebates from U.S. Customs."
200,359, There is significant evidence of the use of this stratagem by American importers. 
201,360," The same proposition applies to alleged concealment from MITI, although the only document offered to establish that 
proposition, the celebrated Japan Victor document, was excluded in the Japanese Materials Evidentiary Opinion. "
202,360," a Plaintiffs' reliance on United States v. Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422, 98 S. Ct. 2864, 57 L. Ed. 2d 854 (1978), in this regard is 
totally misplaced. "
203,361," In view of the fact that the parent corporations have themselves not been linked to the conspiracy, we have found it 
unnecessary to engage in an analysis of plaintiffs' evidence as to the relationships between parents and subsidiaries in support 
of their ""functional alter ego"" and agency approaches. "
204,362," We will take up tape equipment, phonographs, stereo and audio instruments under the general heading ""Tape and Stereo 
Products."" "
205,363," As with the TV agreements, different agreements with different provisions were in effect for varying periods of time, but all 
were similar in tenor."
205,364," Plaintiffs invoke the ""Rationales"" to the agreements as evidence of conspiratorial intent. The text of the Rationales essentially 
tracks that of the TV agreements, and we have explained at Part VII.I. above why the Rationales do not provide any evidence of 
conspiracy."
205,365, The JMEA committees dissolved when the export control arrangements terminated.
205,366, The Kansai Chapter was composed of representative companies with headquarters in the Osaka area of Japan. 
206,367," The ""evidence"" upon which Zenith relies in connection with the radio claims consists of defendants' own interrogatory 
answers, which do not reveal conspiratorial conduct, unidentified and unauthenticated ""minutes"" of meetings produced by the 
EIAJ and various defendants, for which, despite evidentiary challenge, foundation was not laid and statistical documents which 
suffer from similar flaws. Most of the documents are probably inadmissible."
206,368, Plaintiffs offer statistics as to the increase in radio sales of the defendants and the decline of Zenith's radio business. 
207,369," Plaintiffs invoke the Rationales to the agreements as evidence of conspiratorial intent. The text of the Rationales essentially 
tracks that of the TV agreements, and we have explained in Part VII.I, supra why the Rationales do not provide any evidence of 
conspiracy. "
208,370," We also incorporate by reference our earlier discussions of data dissemination, Parts VI.A.5 and VII.G.2(b) and (c)."
208,371," We have already discussed, at p. 1259 and n.280, supra, some weaknesses of plaintiffs' claims about the ""cooperation 
system."" "
209,372," In our opinion addressed to plaintiffs' dumping claims, in which we granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on 
grounds of non-comparability of products, we left open a narrow category of battery operated phonographs, tape and cassette 
recorders, and radios which do not receive FM transmission.  494 F. Supp. at 1242. But plaintiffs have not demonstrated in their 
FPS the existence anywhere in the record of any evidence that would tend to show that any of the requisites of the 1916 
Antidumping Act have been met, nor of any evidence that would create a genuine issue of material fact with respect to any 
conspiracy claims concerning such products. Alternatively, since these matters are not even mentioned by plaintiffs in any of 
their voluminous post-antidumping opinion briefs, in oral argument, or in any other submission, we consider those claims 
abandoned and will grant summary judgment with respect thereto."
209,373, At least no such claims were stated in the preclusive FPS.
209,374," PTO 61 (Aug. 3, 1976) at 2. Each of these broad generic categories contains an endless variety of discrete electronic 
devices, many of which, as we understand it, have only industrial uses and are not usable in television, radio, stereo, or tape 
products. In its FPS references to these categories of components, Zenith makes no attempt to specify the particular device to 
which it is referring or to exclude components which have only industrial uses."
209,375," For example, Braun tubes are mentioned twice (FPS at 4193, 11245) and one of the references is to Braun tubes exported to 
the United Kingdom; capacitors and diodes are mentioned only once each (FPS at 4074, 4331)."
209,376," The components documents also present problems of admissibility similar to those of the documents mentioned earlier and 
in the Japanese Materials Evidentiary Opinion. "
210,376," A Plaintiffs have asserted a Robinson-Patman Act claim against MEC alleging price discrimination in the sale of components, 
which we have disposed of at n. 395, infra."
210,377," For example, plaintiffs rely upon documents such as MIH 029201 through 029210 which purport to be ""minutes"" of high level 
meetings involving the highest executives of Philips and MEI. But these ""minutes"" constitute only general (though wide-ranging) 
discussion of world and U.S. market conditions and do not begin to suggest conspiratorial activity of the kind suggested by 
plaintiffs, either alone or in conjunction with other evidence."
210,378," We have already explained, in Part VII.Q.2, supra, that there is no evidence of involvement by MEI in the alleged conspiracy. 
We have also explained, see n. 30, supra, that plaintiffs cannot proceed on a theory of a ""wheel"" type conspiracy. "
211,379," Section 2 provides: Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to 
monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a 
misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding fifty thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not 
exceeding one year, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court."
211,15, U.S.C. § 2.
211,380," Moreover, in their April 9, 1980 ""Memorandum in Opposition to Certain Defendants' Motions for Partial Summary Judgment 
on Issues of Monopolization and Attempted Monopolization,"" plaintiffs had stated, ""There are no separate counts … which 
address monopolization and attempted monopolization under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2, which do not 
address defendants' conspiracy to monopolize."" "
212,381," Professor Sullivan points out that ""there is a substantial area of potential overlap between the offenses of conspiracy to 
restrain trade, conspiracy to monopolize, and monopolization and attempt to monopolize."" L. Sullivan, supra, at 133. We would 
add to the list of potentially overlapping offenses ""monopolization by combination."" Professors Areeda and Turner point out that the § 2 prohibition against conspiracies to monopolize may be redundant, given § 1, 
in civil litigation: Sherman Act § 2 also condemns those who ""combine or conspire … to monopolize."" The prohibition is curious, because, given § 
1, it seems entirely redundant. Any arrangement that could be considered a combination or conspiracy to monopolize must 
necessarily also be an unreasonable restraint of trade offending § 1. To be sure, not all § 1 violations would constitute 
conspiracies to monopolize. But the key point is this: every combination or conspiracy that offends antitrust policy can easily be 
held to be an unreasonable restraint of trade, without the need for considering the additional complexities that flow from using 
the § 2 monopoly concept. There is therefore no need whatever to try to define the content of the § 2 conspiracy. P. Areeda and D. Turner, supra, at 358."
212,382," As the Supreme Court stated in American Tobacco, referring to § 2 requirements, ""(t)he trial court described this combination 
or conspiracy as an ""essential element' and an ""indispensable ingredient' of the offenses charged. It is, therefore, only in 
conjunction with such a combination or conspiracy that these cases will constitute a precedent."" 328 U.S. at 798, 66 S. Ct. at 
1133-1134. In other words, a finding of monopolization as charged in American Tobacco requires a finding of agreement among 
the defendants. In that case the same circumstantial evidence of agreement supported both the § 1 conspiracy and the § 2 
""combination."""
212,383," Plaintiffs, in their Memorandum in Reply to Motions for Summary Judgment of Certain Defendants, Matsushita Defendants 
and Sears, Roebuck and Co., dated April 2, 1979, suggest at p. 90 that a ""violation may be shown even though no restraint 
under Section 1 has been effected."" However, leaving aside the question of attempt, which violates § 2 but perhaps not § 1, we "
213,," find it difficult to conceive of a combination to monopolize which would not also be a combination in restraint of trade. See n. 
381, supra. The cases cited by plaintiffs do not support their proposition. In American Tobacco, a restraint violative of § 1 was 
indeed present and was the same agreement which violated § 2. The footnote to which plaintiffs refer us in United States v. 
Griffith, 334 U.S. 100, 107 n. 9, 68 S. Ct. 941, 945 n. 9, 92 L. Ed. 1236 (1948), merely points out that a firm can run afoul of the 
""conspiracy to monopolize"" provision of § 2 even if it has not acquired monopoly power. And the cited pages of United States v. 
Columbia Steel, 334 U.S. 495, 531-32, 68 S. Ct. 1107, 1126, 92 L. Ed. 1533 (1948) address attempted monopolization, which 
we agree might not necessarily violate § 1. "
214,384," There must be evidence, for example, of ""industry or public recognition of the submarket as a separate economic entity, the 
products' peculiar characteristics and uses, unique production facilities, distinct customers, distinct prices, sensitivity to price 
changes, and specialized vendors."" Id., quoting Brown Shoe, supra, 370 U.S. at 325, 82 S. Ct. at 1524."
214,385," The FPS does not make clear whether these product markets are defined for purposes of Sherman 1, Sherman 2, or both. 
Without any clear guidance from plaintiffs, we must assume the markets are defined for both purposes. Another indication of 
potential product markets is found in Count IV of the Zenith complaint, which sets out six categories of CEP's which defendants 
ship to the United States. These six categories, not defined as relevant product markets, include all the products listed in the 
text, with the additional breakdown of television receivers into monochrome and color."
214,386," For example, although the FPS posits that one relevant product market is ""all television receivers,"" plaintiffs have provided 
figures separately for monochrome and color receivers, as well as by screen size. Thus, were we to reach the market share 
issue, it would be necessary to determine whether television receivers of different screen sizes are different product markets or 
submarkets."
214,387," Plaintiffs asset that the Trendix figures are understated because they only reflect sales of the defendants' own brand names, 
ignoring OEM and private label purchases."
214,388," Plaintiffs also include figures for other product markets, although there are a number of problems raised by their figures. 
First, plaintiffs allege that radio imports in dollars from Japan represented at least 67% of the U.S. radio market in 1976. Plaintiffs 
have also broken down the defendants' market share in certain segments of the radio market. For example, they claim that 
Japanese imports represented 54% of the U.S. total sales in units of table radios from 1970 to 1976. They have not, however, 
attempted to prove that table radios are a relevant submarket. Citing the Nehmer Report, the plaintiffs conclude that the ""cartel 
members' "" share of the U.S. radio market was approximately 55% by 1970, excluding shipments from their offshore 
manufacturing facilities. This is probably the best indication of what plaintiffs assert to be defendants' market share as to radios. Plaintiffs list within an ""audio products"" market a wide variety of items, including but not limited to phonographs, turntables, 
changers, and loudspeakers. We are supplied with market share data for some of these individual items, but not for all, nor for "
215,," the (putative) relevant product market as a whole. For example, phonographs from Japan are claimed to have accounted for 
90% of all phonograph imports into the U.S. during 1968-1972. Total imports accounted for 65% of the U.S. phonograph market. 
Therefore, we can assume that plaintiffs believe that Japanese phonographs constituted something less than 65% of the U.S. 
market. Plaintiffs also provide us with excerpts from the Nehmer Report which show that Japanese imports of loudspeakers and 
amplifiers constituted an average of 36% of the U.S. market (in quantity) in loudspeakers from 1973 to 1976. Japanese 
amplifiers also held 36% of the U.S. amplifier market from 1972 to 1976. Additionally, plaintiffs' statistics purport to show that the 
defendants held 77.4% in 1968, 89.0% in 1970, and 87.1% in 1972 of the U.S. tape recorder market in terms of unit sales. While 
the Nehmer Report asserts that Japanese imports accounted for more than half of all audio products imported into the United 
States between 1967 and 1977, we are not told what share of the total U.S. audio market was captured by Japanese 
manufacturers, let alone by those who have been named as defendants."
215,389," Zenith contends that the following defendants (individually as opposed to vicariously) have violated the Robinson-Patman 
Act: Matsushita Electronics Corporation of America (MECA); Matsushita Electronics Corporation (MEC); Mitsubishi International 
Corporation (MIC); MELCO Sales, Inc.; Toshiba America, Inc. (TAI); Hitachi Sales Corporation of America (HSCA); Sanyo 
Electric, Inc. (INCO); and Sharp Electronics Corporation (SEC). NUE has not asserted any Robinson-Patman Act claims."
215,390," In addition to Pinkerton, Zenith relies on a number of decisions, such as FTC v. Cement Institute, 333 U.S. 683, 68 S. Ct. 
793, 92 L. Ed. 1010 (1948), which, in its submission, have imposed liability under the Robinson-Patman Act upon all 
coconspirators for what Zenith calls ""a combination and conspiracy among sellers in which overt acts of price discrimination 
exist."" We do not reach those legal issues related to vicarious liability for the same reasons that we do not reach the Pinkerton 
issues, i. e., there is no genuine issue of material fact as to the alleged conspiracy. As a consequence of that ruling, Zenith's 
theory asserting vicarious liability for Robinson-Patman Act violations is unsupportable. This reason is sufficient by itself to 
require that summary judgment be granted for the following defendants, against whom no individual Robinson-Patman Act 
violations are alleged: Mitsubishi Electric Corporation; Mitsubishi Corporation; Sanyo Electric Company, Ltd.; Sanyo Electric 
Trading Company, Ltd.; Sanyo Manufacturing Corp.; Hitachi, Ltd.; Hitachi Kaden Hanbai Kabushiki Kaisha; Sears Roebuck & 
Co.; Motorola, Inc.; Matsushita Electric Industrial Company; Matsushita Electric Trading Company, Ltd.; Quasar Electronics 
Corp.; Toshiba Corporation; and Sharp Corporation. In addition, for the reasons stated in the text, infra, Zenith's claims against 
these defendants also fail for lack of standing and for absence of proof of competitive injury. "
216,391," The Robinson-Patman Act provides in pertinent part: It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce in the course of such commerce, either directly or indirectly, to 
discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality, where either or any of the purchases 
involved in such discrimination are in commerce, where such commodities are sold for use, consumption, or resale within the 
United States or any Territory thereof or the District of Columbia or any insular possession or other place under the jurisdiction of 
the United States, and where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a 
monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any person who either grants or knowingly 
receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them…"
216,15," U.S.C. § 13(a). Both Zenith and NUE originally also sought to maintain claims under the Robinson-Patman Act for price 
discrimination between the U.S. and Japanese markets. Judge A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr., our predecessor in this case, ruled, 
however, that the Robinson-Patman Act has no application unless both ""legs"" of the alleged price discrimination involve 
commodities sold for use or resale within the United States. Zenith Radio Corp. v. Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., 402 F. 
Supp. 244 (E.D.Pa.1975). Price discrimination between two different national markets is governed instead by the Antidumping 
Act of 1916, which was intended to supplement § 2 of the Clayton Act, the statutory predecessor of the Robinson-Patman Act, 
by extending the reach of U.S. price discrimination law to foreign commerce. See Zenith Radio Corp. v. Matsushita Electric 
Industrial Co., 494 F. Supp. 1190, 1213-23 (E.D.Pa.1980), appeal pending, No. 80-2080 (3d Cir.)."
216,392," The statute provides a defense for price differences which are ""justified"" because of cost differences resulting from changing 
conditions affecting marketability, or which are necessary to meet competition."
216,393," Some courts have held that a primary-line plaintiff (see n. 395 infra ) must show sales at a price below some measure of cost 
in order to establish injury to competition.  E. g., Pacific Eng. & Prod. Co. v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 551 F.2d 790 (10th Cir.), cert. 
denied, 434 U.S. 879, 98 S. Ct. 234, 54 L. Ed. 2d 160 (1977); International Air Industries, Inc. v. American Excelsior Co., 517 
F.2d 714 (5th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 943, 96 S. Ct. 1411, 47 L. Ed. 2d 349 (1976). In addition to their contentions 
about standing and evidence of injury, discussed infra, various of the defendants have argued that without evidence of sales 
below cost Zenith cannot show competitive injury. We do not reach this question."
216,394," Defendants contend that Zenith has failed to provide proof of certain jurisdictional elements required by the words of the 
statute. Various defendants claim, for example, that Zenith has not come forth with sufficient evidence of at least two different 
purchasers. They argue that Zenith does not have evidence of actual sales prices, as opposed to list prices, and that only actual 
sales prices will support a Robinson-Patman Act claim. They contend that the instances of price discrimination in plaintiff's FPS 
are in any event de minimis and could not support a finding of substantial incipient injury to competition. The Matsushita 
defendants claim in addition that Zenith has failed to show that the commodities were sold for use or resale within the United "
217,," States. We have examined these contentions and have found that in most, although not in all, instances they are well founded. 
However, there is no point in adding to this lengthy opinion an extensive analysis of a plethora of financial detail when there is an 
alternative and simpler mode of resolution. Finally, various defendants have moved for dismissal of Zenith's Robinson-Patman Act claims under F.R.Civ.P. 16 and/or 37 on 
the ground that Zenith refused to supply detailed information about its Robinson-Patman Act claims in answer to interrogatories 
or in that surrogate for incomplete discovery, the FPS, in violation of Pretrial Orders 136, 142, and 154. In view of our conclusion 
set forth in the text, infra, that there is no genuine issue of material fact with respect to the Robinson-Patman Act claims, we 
need not reach the Rule 37 issue. We add in this regard only that the defendants' complaints about plaintiff's failure to develop 
their Robinson-Patman Act claims seem justified. MC and MIC observe, for example, that Zenith's entire factual narrative 
addressing its Robinson-Patman Act claims against MC and MIC consists of a single paragraph in its FPS (at 7606)."
217,395," Our discussion in this section will be confined to Zenith's primary-line Robinson-Patman claims, i. e., those asserting injury to 
Zenith as a competitor, as opposed to its secondary-line claims, i. e., those asserting injury as a purchaser. Zenith makes some 
assertions of secondary-line injury with respect to MEC's alleged discrimination in the sale of components which we have 
mentioned in Part VIII.C, supra. However, for the reasons which follow, there is no genuine issue of material fact with respect to 
that claim either. First, Count V of Zenith's complaint alleges price discrimination only among ""United States purchasers,"" but 
neither MEI nor Philips, the supposed favored purchasers, are U.S. purchasers. Second, the Act requires proof that the sales on 
both sides of the alleged discrimination were for ""use, consumption or resale within the United States."" See Zenith Radio Corp. 
v. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., 402 F. Supp. 244 (E.D.Pa.1975) (Higginbotham, J.). Zenith has made no such showing. Zenith 
alleges that MEC discriminated in price between, on one hand, a U.S. purchaser (Zenith) and, on the other, a Japanese 
""purchaser"" (MEI) and a European ""purchaser"" (Philips), and makes no attempt to show that the components allegedly ""sold"" to 
either MEI or Philips at purportedly discriminatory prices were sold for ""use, consumption or resale within the United States."" 
Thus, Zenith has failed to satisfy a fundamental jurisdictional prerequisite for its secondary-line claim. Third, Zenith has failed to 
set forth any evidence that MEC made actual, contemporaneous sales of products of ""like grade and quality"" to Zenith and MEI 
and/or Philips. With respect to its own purported purchases, Zenith relies upon aggregate yearly purchase statistics which do not 
identify individual sales transactions or even the components purchases. Moreover, Zenith does not identify actual purchases of 
specific components by MEI or Philips contemporaneous with purchases of components of ""like grade and quality"" by Zenith. 
Fourth, Zenith has not offered evidence of any discrimination in the actual prices at which MEC allegedly ""sold"" its components 
to Zenith, on one hand, and MEI and Philips, on the other. Zenith has advanced no evidence of the actual prices at which MEI, 
Philips, or even Zenith itself purchased the components involved in the alleged discriminations. Finally, Zenith does not offer any 
evidence that the alleged discriminations by MEC had the requisite anticompetitive effect. In this case, a showing of such effects 
would require proof that the alleged discriminations in component prices injured or threatened competition among manufacturers 
of the finished products into which the components were incorporated. Zenith has not even identified the relevant finished 
products or the components involved. "
218,396," Plaintiffs' dumping claims are now before the Court of Appeals under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). In view of the analysis in the text, 
it may be that the individual dumping claims (because dumping is international price discrimination, see n. 391, supra ), are also 
flawed for failure to provide sufficient nexus between the price discrimination of a given defendant and injury to Zenith. The 
problem is illustrated by the following colloquy during the deposition of Zenith's former President, John Nevin, on July 31, 1979: Q: (By Mr. Gartland, counsel for Sharp) Is there any attempt that has been made by Zenith or will be made by Zenith to calculate 
the damages caused by what Zenith contends to be individual dumping by individual defendants? A: (By Mr. Nevin) No there has not been. Q: Do you intend to make any such calculation? A: I wouldn't see any reason for us to make such a calculation. Q: Well, I am not trying to pin you to what the law of conspiracy is or anything like that, Mr. Nevin, or what the law of dumping is. "
219,," Isn't it conceivable that as a naked proposition that Sharp, U.S.A. alone could be charged with dumping and held responsible to 
a competitor that was injured? A: It is conceivable that Sharp, U.S.A. could be, yes. Q: Do you know whether or not Zenith has charged Sharp as an individual company with individual dumping of its own and 
attempted to calculate the damages sustained by Zenith by reason thereof? A: Well, I think I have to answer both questions no. To the best of my knowledge, we have not charged Sharp with anything as 
an individual company. Our charges have been addressed to a group of companies, and to the best of my knowledge, we have 
made no attempt to say that absent Sharp's activity the rest of this damage would or would not have occurred or to assign the 
responsibility. Q: I am not THE WITNESS: Is that accurate?MR. CURTIS: Yes. Q: I am just trying to ascertain whether Zenith has a separate claim different from and separate from the claim against all the 
other defendants for joint activities. A: No sir. The answer to your question is no. There is no Zenith claim that has ever been brought to my attention that would be 
directed separately at Sharp. Q: Is this likewise true of the other defendants individually? A: Yes, sir. "

Judgment Relating to Robinson-Patman Act Claims at 15-19; Supplemental Memorandum of Zenith Radio Corporation in 
Opposition to Certain Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment Relating to Robinson-Patman Act Claims at 9."
220,398, NUE has asserted no claims under § 7 of the Clayton Act.
220,399," Zenith contends that the following defendants have directly violated § 7 of the Clayton Act: Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., 
Ltd. (MEI), Matsushita Electronics Corp. (MEC), Matsushita Electric Trading Co., Ltd. (MET), Matsushita Electronics Corp. of 
America (MECA), Motorola, Inc., Quasar Electronics Corp., Sanyo Electric Co., Ltd., Sanyo Electric Trading Co., Ltd., Sanyo 
Manufacturing Corp., and Sears, Roebuck & Co. "
221,," As pleaded in Count III of their complaint and counterclaim, Zenith's § 7 claims presented the additional wrinkle of two smaller 
conspiracies within the overall conspiracy, for, of the ten companies just named, only MEI and Sanyo, as acquiring companies, 
were charged with actual violations. The other companies against whom Clayton § 7 counts were specifically instituted (the MEI 
and Sanyo subsidiaries, Sears, and Motorola) were charged with having ""conspired with each other and among themselves and 
with other defendants named in this complaint"" to violate § 7. Zenith Complaint P 61; Zenith Counterclaim P 42. This allegation 
is distinct from the more general allegation bringing in all defendants under the Pinkerton theory. See Zenith Complaint P 64; 
Zenith Counterclaim P 45; Part VI.D.5, supra. However, upon a challenge by the defendants named as part of the ""internal"" 
conspiracy asserting that there is no such action as a ""conspiracy"" to violate § 7, Zenith foreswore any attempt to maintain such 
a claim, adhering solely to its Pinkerton theory. Zenith's Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant's Motions for Summary 
Judgment Relating to the § 7 Clayton Act Claims at 46. Thus, the separate allegations were apparently for no purpose. We note in addition that we do not understand Zenith to suggest that the acquired companies or the selling companies could be 
held liable on any conspiracy theory other than on the ""unitary"" conspiracy theory. Indeed, given the plain words of the statute 
and the consistent interpretation by the courts that only the acquiring companies can be held liable under § 7, they could not so 
contend. See e.g., Dailey v. Quality School Plan, Inc., 380 F.2d 484, 488 (5th Cir. 1967)."
221,400," For the reasons set forth in that Part VI.D.5 and elaborated upon in the course of our discussion of the Robinson-Patman Act 
Claims, we do not reach the Pinkerton issue. Similarly, we need not consider Booth Bottling Co. v. Beverages International, Inc., 
361 F. Supp. 340 (E.D.Pa.1973), which Zenith cites in support of its conspiracy theory of Clayton § 7 liability."
221,401," During the time period covered in this litigation, Section 7 provided in pertinent part: No corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital 
and no corporation subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission shall acquire the whole or any part of the assets 
of another corporation engaged also in commerce, where in any line of commerce in any section of the country, the effect of 
such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly."
221,15," U.S.C. § 18. Section 7 was amended in the Antitrust Procedural Improvements Act of 1980, P.L. No. 96-349, 49 U.S.L.W. 117. Section 6(a) 
of the Act extends the reach of the anti-merger provisions beyond corporations to apply now to ""persons""; moreover, the 
jurisdictional reach is extended not just to entities engaged in commerce, but to those involved in ""any activity affecting 
commerce"" as well. "
222,402," To sustain the failing company defense, a defendant must also show not only that the acquired company was failing, but also 
that there was no alternative purchaser that would lessen the anti-competitive effect. See Citizen Publishing Co., supra."
222,403, Much of the confusion stems from the opacity of the Supreme Court's opinion in Citizen Publishing.
222,404, Count III asserts plaintiffs' Clayton § 7 claims. 
223,405," Because we have determined that there is no material factual issue with regard to plaintiffs' conspiracy claims, Zenith's 
theory asserting liability against those defendants that have not been charged with direct § 7 liability is unsupportable. That 
reason alone justifies dismissal of the § 7 claims against the Toshiba defendants, the Hitachi defendants, the Sharp defendants, 
MELCO, MELCO Sales, MC, MIC and Sanyo Electric, Inc."
223,406," We have also found no evidence supporting the home market facet of the ""unitary"" conspiracy."
223,407," As we have explained, these claims are, in the context of this case, primarily conspiracy based."
223,408," The decision to grant summary judgment, reached after the painstaking, independent review of the evidence and the law 
described in the parallel series (evidentiary and summary judgment) of opinions which we have filed since March, 1980, may 
come to the parties as no surprise. Pursuant to a Consent Order dated November 18, 1977 (the very first Order we signed after 
transfer of this case to our docket), in order to enable U.S. Justice Department consideration of potential antitrust violations, 
plaintiffs were permitted: (1) to show the Justice Department any of defendants' documents produced in this litigation that they 
desired; (2) to comment upon them; and (3) to explain to the Department the full import of what they believed they had 
uncovered. In other words, plaintiffs' counsel were permitted to, and did, cull their ""best case"" against defendants from the 
documents and present it to the Justice Department. However, after a review of the documents and presentations, the Justice 
Department announced that it had found no evidence of any violation of law. The April 12, 1978 statement of Assistant Attorney 
General John H. Shenefield, Chief of the Antitrust Division, describing the Department's finding to the Committee on the 
Judiciary of the U.S. Senate went as follows: "
224,," Shortly after I assumed my duties, about a year ago, representatives of Zenith and National Union Electric (NUE) Corporations 
came to me and complained that several Japanese color television receiver manufacturers were engaged in a concerted 
program to fix prices and predatorily destroy the American TV industry. I was aware that my predecessor, Don Baker, in a letter 
to Senator Kennedy, had communicated his decision not to conduct any investigation of these charges at that time. The complainants assured me that if the Antitrust Division reviewed the pretrial discovery in the private antitrust litigation they 
had begun in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania 8 years before, we would conclude that a full investigation and probably 
prosecution of these Japanese enterprises was warranted. Given the seriousness of the charges and the assurance that the evidence to back them up was accessible, I agreed to take a 
fresh look to have the Antitrust Division undertake a preliminary investigation to determine if there was any reasonable basis for 
proceeding with a full investigation through compulsory process. …. For the past six months, we have inspected approximately 35,000 pages of documents, fully 5,000 untranslated from the original 
Japanese. More than half of these were shown to us by Zenith and NUE. We are assured that we have seen the best evidence 
the complainants have so far gathered. About 10,000 of these documents were made available for inspection by third parties in 
the litigation; and we reviewed approximately 4,000 documents shown to us by Japanese defendants. We have committed 
substantial resources to this matter. The professional time alone has exceeded 200 full person work days. This investigation has 
been conducted with the cooperation of both plaintiffs and defendants in the Pennsylvania litigation and without any pressure 
from or intervention by any other agency of the United States government or any official or representative of the Japanese 
government. I recently concluded a detailed review of the evidence examined. I have agreed with the investigative staff's unanimous 
conclusion that it does not provide any reasonable basis for conducting a full-scale Antitrust Division investigation of predatory 
activity by the Japanese color TV industry. In short, we found no evidence of on-going concerted activity by Japanese 
enterprises aimed at the United States market. As you are, I am aware of the check price agreements of an earlier period. However, we have no evidence that these 
agreements continued beyond 1973. In addition, we found no evidence that, even in earlier periods, any concerted activity was 
intended to or did serve a predatory purpose. In any event, at the present time, an orderly marketing agreement is in place, an 
effect of which will be to reduce the percentage of Japanese color TV sales in the United States in 1978 to approximately 16% of 
the U.S. market. Most importantly, in view of the charges made by Zenith and NUE, we found no evidence of concerted predatory conduct 
intended to destroy and supplant the U.S. color TV industry, either at an earlier period or at the present time. Given this finding 
after careful investigation, I find no basis for proceeding further. I understand that pre-trial discovery in the Pennsylvania litigation is not complete. It may be that at a trial, the plaintiffs will 
persuade a factfinder that there has been a violation of the antitrust laws but at this point, based on all the available evidence, 
we have no basis to justify commencement of a full scale investigation. (emphasis added) We note Mr. Shenefield's conclusion only in passing, for our inquiry into plaintiffs' case in connection with the summary judgment 
motions has been, as is demonstrated in the preceding segments of this opinion, in the pretrial evidentiary trilogy, in the 
summary judgment opinions preceding them, and in the transcripts of the countless pretrial conferences, far more sustained and 
much greater in scope and depth."

provides in pertinent part: HN1[
] ""It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, either directly or indirectly, 
to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality, where either or any of the 
purchases involved in such discrimination are in commerce, where such commodities are sold for use, consumption, or resale 
within the United States . . . and where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to 
create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy or prevent competition with any person who either grants or 
knowingly receives the benefits of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them . . . ."" Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731, 15 U. S. C. § 15, provides: HN2[
] ""Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may 
sue therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, 
without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover three-fold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, 
including a reasonable attorney's fee."" "
232,2," The automatic-damages theory has split the lower courts.  The leading case approving the theory is Fowler Manufacturing Co. 
v. Gorlick, 415 F.2d 1248 (CA9 1969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 1012 (1970). See also Elizabeth Arden Sales Corp. v. Gus Blass 
Co., 150 F.2d 988 (CA8) (involving §§ 2 (d) and 2 (e) of the Act), cert. denied, 326 U.S. 773 (1945); Grace v. E. J. Kozin Co., 
538 F.2d 170 (CA7 1976) (involving § 2 (c) of the Act).  The leading case rejecting the theory is Enterprise Industries, Inc. v. 
Texas Co., 240 F.2d 457 (CA2), cert. denied, 353 U.S. 965 (1957). Accord, Edward J. Sweeney & Sons, Inc. v. Texaco, Inc., 
637 F.2d 105 (CA3 1980); McCaskill v. Texaco, Inc., 351 F.Supp. 1332 (SD Ala. 1972), affirmance order, 486 F.2d 1400 (CA5 
1973); Kidd v. Esso Standard Oil Co., 295 F.2d 497 (CA6 1961)."
232,3," Relying on Bruce's Juices, Inc. v. American Can Co., 330 U.S. 743, 757 (1947), petitioner argues that this Court has previously 
accepted the automatic-damages theory.  In that case, the Court stated that if petitioner can show an illegal price discrimination 
under the Act, ""it would establish its right to recover three times the discriminatory difference without proving more than the 
illegality of the prices."" Ibid.  But that statement is merely dictum, since the only issue before the Court was whether a violation of 
§ 2 (a) could be used as an affirmative defense to void a contract. "
233,4," Respondent suggests that petitioner's inability to show that his favored competitors lowered their retail sales price should 
defeat recovery.  That argument assumes that evidence of a lower retail price is the sine qua non of antitrust injury, that the 
disfavored purchaser is simply not ""injured"" unless the favored purchaser has lowered his price.  If the favored purchaser has 
lowered his retail price, for example, the disfavored purchaser will lose sales to the extent it does not match that lower price.  
Similarly, if the disfavored purchaser matches the lower price, it will lose profits.  Because petitioner has not shown that the 
favored purchasers have lowered their retail price, petitioner is arguably foreclosed from showing that it lost either sales or 
profits.  Justice Cardozo seemingly adopted this position in ICC v. United States, 289 U.S. 385, 390-391 (1933), a case involving 
rate discrimination under the Interstate Commerce Act: ""If by reason of the discrimination, the preferred producers have been able to divert business that would otherwise have gone to 
the disfavored shipper, damage has resulted to the extent of the diverted profits.  If the effect of the discrimination has been to 
force the shipper to sell at a lowered price . . . damage has resulted to the extent of the reduction.  But none of these 
consequences is a necessary inference from discrimination without more."" Petitioner argues that is an overly narrow view of antitrust injury.  To the extent a disfavored purchaser must pay more for its 
goods than its competitors, it is less able to compete.  It has fewer funds available with which to advertise, make capital 
expenditures, and the like.  Although the inability of petitioner to show that the favored retailers lowered their retail price makes 
petitioner's argument particularly weak, we find it unnecessary to decide in this case whether such failure as a matter of law 
demonstrates no competitive injury. "
234,5," Story Parchment Co. v. Paterson Parchment Paper Co., 282 U.S. 555 (1931), is similarly distinguishable.  In upholding a jury 
verdict against respondents for a violation of § 2 of the Sherman Act, the Court observed: ""It is true that there was uncertainty as to the extent of damage, but there was none as to the fact of damage; and there is a clear 
distinction between the measure of proof necessary to establish the fact that petitioner had sustained some damage, and the "
235,," measure of proof necessary to enable the jury to fix the amount.  The rule which precludes the recovery of uncertain damages 
applies to such as are not the certain result of the wrong, not to those damages which are definitely attributable to the wrong and 
only uncertain in respect of their amount. . . ."" Id., at 562. ""If the damage is certain, the fact that its extent is uncertain does not prevent a recovery."" Id., at 566. In this case, by contrast, the issue is not so much the amount of damages as whether petitioner has in fact been injured by an 
antitrust violation. "
240,1," Plaintiffs also alleged a violation of section 2 of the Sherman Act, but alleged no facts sufficient to make out a separate 
offense. This allegation adds nothing to the issue whether an effect on ""commerce"" must be established under sections 1, 2 and 
3."
240,2," The bank would seem to be the primary beneficiary of the policy; presumably the dealer is the purchaser of the policy because 
the policy proceeds satisfy the dealer's liability to the bank for the remainder due on the car customer's defaulted loan."

244,30," The Puerto Rico Anti-Monopoly Act of 1964 (Act No. 77 of June 25, 1964) superseded the Puerto Rico Act of March 14, 1907, 
and draws heavily on federal legislation. However, there are important differences. For example, the prohibition of restraints of 
trade in the Puerto Rico Act is expressly limited to ""unreasonable"" restraints. But see Standard Oil v. U. S., 221 U.S. 1, 31 S. Ct. "
245,502," , 55 L. Ed. 619 (1911). The Puerto Rico Act's anti-merger provision extends to acquisitions by ""any person"", defined to 
include natural persons and unincorporated associations, which were not included within the comparable provision of the 
Clayton Act. The Puerto Rico Act's anti-merger provisions also exempt asset acquisitions which are for the purpose of 
developing new local industries. There is no comparable provision under federal law. See generally Estrella, Antitrust Law in 
Puerto Rico, 28 Revista del Colegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico 505, 580-709 (1968)."
245,31," The application of section 2 of the Sherman Act to Puerto Rico is a different matter, for there is no comparable provision in 
section 3 to the section 2 prohibition of monopolization. Whether section 2 applies to Puerto Rico following Commonwealth 
status, when no equivalent prohibition applied before it, is an issue not before us and not briefed. Consideration of such an issue 
would require, among other things, exploration of the reasons why Congress chose not to extend such a prohibition to the 
territories."
245,32," We find nothing to the contrary in First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Puerto Rico v. Hector L. Ruiz de Jesus, 644 
F.2d 910 (1st Cir. 1981). In that case, we held that post-1952 Banking Act amendments did not alter the scope of section 632 of 
the federal banking code, 12 U.S.C. § 632. Section 632, enacted in 1933, grants federal question jurisdiction to district courts in 
all civil suits involving ""international or foreign banking, or banking in a dependency or insular possession of the United States "" 
where a federally chartered corporation is a party to the suit. Post-Commonwealth Banking Act amendments did not reflect any 
congressional intent to narrow this grant of jurisdiction by discontinuing federal question jurisdiction in civil cases involving 
banking in Puerto Rico where a federally chartered corporation is a party. And, Commonwealth status itself, although it 
established the full measure of local self-government, did not necessarily withdraw this jurisdictional grant. Such a grant, in 
contradistinction to congressional regulation of local affairs, does not threaten the balance between federal prerogatives and 
local autonomy. Although there is not a parallel grant of jurisdiction over banking transactions in a state where a federally 
chartered corporation is a party, that fact alone does not suggest that, as a matter of comity, section 632 no longer applies to 
Puerto Rico. Among other things, its history, language and mercantile custom may, in Congress' view, render Puerto Rico 
sufficiently different as to merit availability of a federal forum for a federally chartered corporation banking there. Cf.  12 C.F.R. § 
211.2(a), 213.2(b) (1979); 12 C.F.R. § 211.2(f) (1980) (Federal Reserve Board regulations which define the terms ""foreign"", 
""foreign country"" and ""abroad"" to include the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico). Such a result respects the interests of both 
sovereigns. Finally, there have been different historical understandings with respect to section 3 of the Sherman Act and section 
632 of the federal banking code. The Puerto Rico District Court held soon after Commonwealth status that section 3 of the 
Sherman Act no longer applied to Puerto Rico, whereas that court and this court until quite recently assumed that section 632 
continued to apply to banking transactions in Puerto Rico. "
246,33," Pub.L.No.600 § 5, 64 Stat. 320, continuing in force section 58 of the Second Organic Act, and Pub.L.No.600 § 6, 64 Stat. 
320."
246,34," The phrase ""not locally inapplicable"" originated in Henry Clay's Report of the Committee of Thirteen, the proposed 
Compromise of 1850. As part of the settlement of the clash of interests sparked by the Wilmot Proviso (a proposed 
Congressional ban of slavery in New Mexico and other territories), the Compromise was silent on introduction of the ""local"" 
institution of slavery to these territories. The Southern view was that changing social and economic conditions (including 
adaptation to dry soil) might bring about slavery in New Mexico, perhaps supported by retained Mexican law and custom. In 
addition, the Southern view held that the territorial legislature should be free to recognize and support slavery even if such 
territorial law thereby superseded general federal law dealing with personal rights. Of course, the North differed strongly on the 
propriety of establishing slavery in New Mexico and took its chances on the dry soil and local sentiment. Thus, the phrase ""not 
locally inapplicable"" was viewed by its Southern proponents as a means by which New Mexico, should it choose to do so, could 
adopt slavery despite general federal laws dealing with personal rights. And, the Northerners apparently considered it sufficiently 
ambiguous as to minimize its import. The phrase ""not locally inapplicable"" (and elimination of the Wilmot Proviso) expressly left 
the issue of slavery in New Mexico to be determined by developing local social, economic and legislative conditions, and, 
thereby, staved off the political crisis that enveloped the nation several years later. This history of the compromise language is perhaps of some continuing significance. Senator Foraker, in 1900, deliberately 
chose this model (rather than following the simpler Wisconsin territorial act model ""so far as may be applicable""). His choice 
reflects, if anything, a more, rather than less, deferential view of the effect of local social, economic and legislative developments 
on general federal law. In sum, the phrase reflects at least some intent that not only developing social and economic conditions 
but also emerging territorial self-government could render general federal law inapplicable. Cf.  United States v. Ferrer, 613 F.2d 
1188, 1192-93 (1st Cir. 1980) (Puerto Rico has authority to enact local legislation inconsistent with federal maritime legislation). 
For the history of the phrase ""not locally inapplicable"", see Congressional Globe, 31 Cong. 1st Sess. 944-48 (May 8, 1850) (H.

another expansive view of territorial legislative power over ""local"" matters and a limited view of Congressional power to legislate 
for the territories see Mr. Justice Campbell's concurring opinion in Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393, 513-14, 15

locally inapplicable"", see Leibowitz, The Applicability of Federal Law to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 56 Geo.L.J. 221, 234-

247,35," Whatever special considerations might move a court to hold that Congress did not intend section 2 of the Sherman Act to 
apply to Puerto Rico, see note 31 supra, would also lead a court to say that the FRA was not ""inconsistent"" with the 
nonapplication of section 2 or that section 2 was still ""locally inapplicable"". Again, all roads lead to Rome."
247,36," To hold the contrary in a price-fixing case, such as McLain, would undo years of jurisprudence making clear that a plaintiff 
need only prove a price-fixing agreement, not the agreement's effects, in order to prevail. The cases cited by the Court, 
American Tobacco and Socony-Vacuum, make clear that the Court had just this problem in mind. "
248,37," See United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 60 S. Ct. 811, 84 L. Ed. 1129 (1940); United States v. Trenton

248,38," The brokerage president stated in a deposition that many firms engage in reinsurance; but his deposition does not show that 
defendants did so in this case."
248,39," Whether these allegations fit within the boycott exception of the McCarran-Ferguson Insurance Regulation Act, 15 U.S.C. § 
1013(b), was neither briefed nor argued. "
253,1," For some limitations on this rule, see United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 664-669 (1965)."
253,2," For further elaboration of this point, see California State Council of Carpenters, No. 77-2323, slip op. at 1040-41 nn. 8 & 9 and 
accompanying text (9th Cir. Nov. 20, 1980)."
253,3," In his dissent from this order, Judge Sneed suggests several scenarious of employer behaviour that, he says, might constitute 
conduct violative of the antitrust laws as interpreted by the majority.  The majority opinion, like the Court's opinion in Connell 
Construction Co. v. Plumbers Local 100, 421 U.S. 616 (1975), was not intended to establish a comprehensive set of rules 
governing all imaginable future group conduct by employers.  The majority simply holds that employers may not be exempt from 
the antitrust laws when they indulge in conduct directly analogous to the union conduct found to be non-exempt in Connell. "
254,1, Consider these hypothetical cases:
254,1," .  Suppose that one or more, but fewer than a majority, of the members of the multiemployer bargaining unit described in the 
text oppose attempting to destroy the union, but are required to go along with the other employers under the multiemployer 
bargaining unit's charter.  Are the dissenting employers subject to antitrust liability?"
254,2," .  Members of a multiemployer bargaining unit prefer their employees' representative, union X, to union Y, which is attempting 
to replace union X.  Therefore, the employers agree to bargain very easily with union X.  May union Y sue the employers under 
the Sherman Act? Would it matter whether the employers unanimously adopted the strategy or some opposed it?"
254,3," .  Consider this case, which is similar to the employer activity challenged in Part XXIV(6) of the Complaint, reprinted in the 
dissenting opinion, supra n.1.  A multiemployer bargaining unit sponsors a workshop on the law relating to decertification of 
bargaining representatives under section 9 of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.  § 159 (1976). Both members of the 
unit and other employers attend the workshop, the goal of which is to reduce union representation.  May a union representing 
employees of an employer workshop participant sue under the Sherman Act?"
254,4," .  Members of a multiemployer bargaining unit adopt the following strategy for contract negotiations.  The members agree to 
bargain to impasse and then impose the terms of their final offer. They further agree that no member of the unit may agree to 
separate terms with the union until the union either accepts the unit's final offer or loses its status as bargaining representative.  
May the union sue under the Sherman Act, even though this agreement is probably an unfair labor practice under section 
8(a)(5), 29 U.S.C.  § 158(a)(5) (1976), which requires good faith bargaining? In the absence of the majority opinion in this case, each of the hypothetical cases would not suggest an antitrust violation.  That 
is not now the case.  Each is hard to distinguish from this case.  Each should be treated as a labor case and the antitrust laws 
should be preempted. "
260,*," David Alter, Joseph Ferraro, Mortimer Becker, Henry Kaiser, Ronald Rosenberg, and Paul P. Selvin filed a brief for the 
American Federation of Television and Radio Artists et al. as amici curiae urging affirmance. "
261,1, The respondent Donald Grody is the executive secretary of Equity.
261,2," The basic sources of organized labor's exemption from federal antitrust laws are §§ 6 and 20 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731 
and 738, 15 U. S. C. § 17 and 29 U. S. C. § 52, and §§ 4, 5, and 13 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 47 Stat. 70, 71, and 73, 29 U. 
S. C. §§ 104, 105, and 113."
261,3," Such vulnerability was, and still remains, particularly acute for actors and actresses without established professional 
reputations, who have always constituted the overwhelming majority of Equity's members. "
262,4, The challenge was grounded on allegations of common-law tortious interference with business relationships.
262,5, Judge Manton dissented without opinion.
262,6," For contemporary descriptions of agent abuses of actors and actresses, see generally A. Harding, The Revolt of the Actors 
(1929).  See also New Rules for Actors, N. Y. Times, Sept. 24, 1928, p. 20, col. 3; The New Republic, Oct. 24, 1928, p. 263.  Cf.  
Ribnik v. McBride, 277 U.S. 350, 359-375 (Stone, J., joined by Holmes and Brandeis, JJ., dissenting) (general abuses by 
employment agencies, particularly at times of widespread unemployment).  The Court's decision in Ribnik v. McBride was 
overruled unanimously in Olsen v. Nebraska, 313 U.S. 236."
262,7," The petitioners do not dispute this.  The regulations have undergone revision in some details, largely as a result of negotiations 
between Equity and Theatrical Artists Representatives Associates (TARA), which until shortly before this litigation began was the 
only association voicing the concerns of agents with regard to their representation of Equity members.  Until their voluntary 
resignation in late 1977, most of the petitioners were members of TARA.  The petitioners are now members of the National 
Association of Talent Representatives (NATR).  Unlike TARA, which functions only in the legitimate theater field, NATR also 
functions in the fields of motion pictures and television.  In those fields, agents operate under closely analogous agent 
regulations maintained by the Screen Actors' Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. The history of the negotiations and disputes between Equity and TARA are described in the opinion of the District Court in the 
present case.  478 F.Supp. 496, 498 (SDNY)."
262,8," The minimum, or ""scale,"" wage varies.  In August 1977, for example, the minimum weekly salary was $ 335 for Broadway 
performances, and $ 175 for performances off Broadway.  Scale wages are set by a collective-bargaining agreement between 
Equity and the producers, to which the agents are not parties.  When an agent represents an actor or actress whose 
professional reputation is not sufficient to demand a salary higher than scale, the agent hopes to develop a relationship that will 
become continually more remunerative as the performer's professional reputation grows, and with it the power to demand an 
ever higher salary. No agent is required to represent an actor or actress whom he does not wish to represent. "
263,9," It is Equity's view that commissions in the industry are not necessarily related to efforts by the agents, and that an agent often 
functions as little more than an ""order taker,"" who is able to collect a percentage of a client's wages for the duration of a show for 
doing little more than answering a producer's telephone call.  Indeed, an agent may collect a commission on the salary of an 
actor or actress he represents even if the client obtains the job without the agent."
263,10," Equity argues that this restriction is necessary because there is an incentive for agents to represent as many actors and 
actresses as possible -- and not necessarily to serve them all well -- because an agent receives a commission whenever his 
client is employed at a salary higher than scale, regardless of the extent of his involvement in obtaining employment for the 
client. "
264,11," The Court of Appeals recognized that even if there had been an agreement between Equity and a ""non-labor group,"" the 
agreement might still have been protected from the antitrust laws under the ""non-statutory"" exemption. 622 F.2d, at 649, n. 1. 
See Connell Construction Co. v. Plumbers & Steamfitters, 421 U.S. 616, 622. See n. 19, infra."
264,12," See generally Meltzer, Labor Unions, Collective Bargaining, and the Antitrust Laws, 32 U. Chi. L. Rev. 659 (1965); Winter, 
Collective Bargaining and Competition: The Application of Antitrust Standards to Union Activities, 73 Yale L. J. 14 (1963). See 
also Leslie, Principles of Labor Antitrust, 66 Va. L. Rev. 1183 (1980)."
264,13," See Winter, supra n. 12, at 30-38."
264,14," As is true under the Clayton Act, the specified activities are protected only in the context of a labor dispute. The Norris-
LaGuardia Act defines a labor dispute to include ""any controversy concerning terms or conditions of employment, or concerning 
the association or representation of persons in negotiating, fixing, maintaining, changing, or seeking to arrange terms or "
265,," conditions of employment, regardless of whether or not the disputants stand in the proximate relation of employer and 
employee."" 29 U. S. C. § 113 (c)."
265,15," In Milk Wagon Drivers v. Lake Valley Farm Products, Inc., 311 U.S. 91, 103, the Court stated: ""For us to hold, in the face of 
[the Norris-LaGuardia Act], that the federal courts have jurisdiction to grant injunctions in cases growing out of labor disputes, 
merely because alleged violations of the Sherman Act are involved, would run counter to the plain mandate of the Act and would 
reverse the declared purpose of Congress."""
265,16," See also Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U.S. 469. There, in the Term preceding that in which the Hutcheson case was 
decided, the Court reasoned that the Sherman Act prohibits only restraints on ""commercial competition,"" 310 U.S., at 497, 499, 
510-511 -- or those market restraints designed to monopolize supply, control prices, or allocate product distribution -- and that 
unions are not liable where they merely further their own goals in the labor market."
265,17," In Hunt v. Crumboch, 325 U.S. 821, decided the same day as Allen Bradley, the Court ruled that the labor exemption 
protected a union's boycott of a truck hauler through successful secondary pressure on purchasers of the hauler's services with 
whom the union had contracts, because of the absence of union participation in a conspiracy with the hauler's competitors.  See 
325 U.S., at 824; Meltzer, supra n. 12, at 677, and n. 74. "
266,18," Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, also dealt with a union combination with employers, but the grounds of decision 
were unrelated to the antitrust exemption."
266,19," Even where there are union agreements with nonlabor groups that may have the effect of sheltering the nonlabor groups from 
competition in product markets, the Court has recognized a ""nonstatutory"" exemption to shield such agreements if they are 
intimately related to the union's vital concerns of wages, hours, and working conditions.  See, e. g., Meat Cutters v. Jewel Tea 
Co., 381 U.S. 676. This nonstatutory exemption was described as follows in Connell Construction Co. v. Plumbers & 
Steamfitters, 421 U.S., at 622: ""The Court has recognized . . . that a proper accommodation between the congressional policy favoring collective bargaining 
under the NLRA and the congressional policy favoring free competition in business markets requires that some union-employer 
agreements be accorded a limited nonstatutory exemption from antitrust sanctions. . . . ""The nonstatutory exemption has its source in the strong labor policy favoring the association of employees to eliminate 
competition over wages and working conditions.  Union success in organizing workers and standardizing wages ultimately will 
affect price competition among employers, but the goals of federal labor law never could be achieved if this effect on business 
competition were held a violation of the antitrust laws. The Court therefore has acknowledged that labor policy requires tolerance 
for the lessening of business competition based on differences in wages and working conditions."" Neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals in this case decided whether the nonstatutory exemption would independently 
shield the respondents from the petitioners' antitrust claims.  See n. 11, supra."
266,20," LEdHN[4B][
] [4B] Of course, a party seeking refuge in the statutory exemption must be a bona fide labor organization, and not an independent 
contractor or entrepreneur.  See Meat Drivers v. United States, 371 U.S. 94; Columbia River Packers Assn. v. Hinton, 315 U.S. 
143. See generally 1 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law § 229c, pp. 195-198 (1978).  There is no dispute about Equity's 
status as a bona fide labor organization."
266,21," [****27]   LEdHN[5B][
] [5B] As the employers of Equity's members, producers are plainly a ""nonlabor group."" Employers almost always will be a ""nonlabor 
group,"" although an exception has been recognized, for example, when the employer himself is in job competition with his 
employees.  See Musicians v. Carroll, 391 U.S. 99 (orchestra leaders who both lead an orchestra and play an instrument). "
267,22," These consisted of a minimum scale for sidemen, a ""leader's fee,"" which was twice the sidemen's scale in orchestras of at 
least four, and an additional 8% for social security, unemployment insurance, and other expenses.  In addition, if a leader did not 
appear but designated a subleader, and four or more musicians performed, the leader was required to pay from his leader's fee 
1.5 times the sidemen's scale to the subleader."
267,23," The Court did not explicitly determine whether the second prong of the Hutcheson test for the statutory exemption had been 
met, i. e., whether the union had acted in its ""self-interest."" But given its various findings that the challenged restrictions were 
designed to cope with job competition and to protect wage scales and working conditions, 391 U.S., at 108, 109, 110, 113, it 
clearly did so sub silentio."
267,24," Several cases before Carroll also upheld union regulation of the practices of independent entrepreneurs affecting the wages or 
working conditions of union members.  See Milk Wagon Drivers v. Lake Valley Farm Products, Inc., 311 U.S. 91; Teamsters v. 
Oliver, 358 U.S. 283 (Oliver I); Teamsters v. Oliver, 362 U.S. 605 (Oliver II).  In Milk Wagon Drivers, the Court held that the 
union had engaged in a ""labor dispute"" within the meaning of the Norris-LaGuardia Act when it attempted to organize 
independent ""vendors"" who supplied milk to retail stores.  There the union feared that the ""vendor system"" was designed to 
escape the payment of union wages and the assumption of union-imposed working conditions.  In Oliver I, the Milk Wagon 
Drivers decision was invoked to protect from state antitrust challenge a union's successful efforts to prescribe through collective-
bargaining agreements a wage scale for truck-drivers, and minimum rental fees for drivers who owned their own trucks.  The 
union feared that driver-owners, whose fees included not only an entrepreneurial component but also a ""wage"" for the labor of 
driving, might undercut the union scale by charging a fee that effectively included a subscale wage component.  The Court 
stated that ""[the] regulations [embodied] . . . a direct frontal attack upon a problem thought to threaten the maintenance of the 
basic wage structure established by the collective bargaining contract."" 358 U.S., at 294. See also Oliver II, supra, at 606 (after 
remand to the state court)."
267,25," Indeed, the District Court in Carroll, whose judgment was affirmed by this Court ""in its entirety,"" 391 U.S., at 114, drew 
parallels with the restrictions at issue in the present case.  The court noted that ""[apparently], similar abuses by booking agents 
existed in other fields too.  Edelstein v. Gillmore, 35 F.2d 723, 726 (2d Cir. 1929) (actors)."" Carroll v. AFM, 241 F.Supp. 865, 
892 (SDNY). "
268,," The petitioners argue that theatrical agents are indistinguishable from ""numerous [other] groups of persons who merely supply 
products and services to union members"" such as landlords, grocers, accountants, and lawyers.  But it is clear that agents differ 
from these groups in two critical respects: the agents control access to jobs and negotiation of the terms of employment.  For the 
actor or actress, therefore, agent commissions are not merely a discretionary expenditure of disposable income, but a virtually 
inevitable concomitant of obtaining employment."
268,26," See Carroll v. AFM, 241 F.Supp., at 881-882; Harding, supra n. 6, at 319-325."
268,27," The Court of Appeals found that ""the union cannot eliminate wage competition among its members without regulation of the 
fees of the agents."" 622 F.2d, at 651 (emphasis added).  Wage competition is prevented not only by the rule precluding 
commissions on scale jobs.  Actors and actresses could also compete over the percentage of their wages they were willing to 
cede to an agent, subject only to the restrictions imposed by state law."
268,28," In many industries, unions maintain hiring halls and other job referral systems, particularly where work is typically temporary 
and performed on separate project sites rather than fixed locations.  By maintaining halls, unions attempt to eliminate abuses 
such as kickbacks, and to insure fairness and regularity in the system of access to employment.  In a 1947 Senate Report, 
Senator Taft explained: ""The employer should be able to make a contract with the union as an employment agency.  The union 
frequently is the best employment agency.  The employer should be able to give notice of vacancies, and in the normal course of 
events to accept men sent to him by the hiring hall."" S. Rep. No. 1827, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., 13 (1947), quoted in Teamsters v. 
NLRB, 365 U.S. 667, 673-674. The National Labor Relations Board and the courts have ruled that union demands for hiring halls are a mandatory subject of 
collective bargaining, and that strikes to obtain such provisions are protected activity.  See, e. g., Houston Chapter, Associated 
General Contractors, 143 N. L. R. B. 409, enf'd, 349 F.2d 449 (CA5); NLRB v. Tom Joyce Floors, Inc., 353 F.2d 768, 771 (CA9).  
Cf.  Teamsters v. NLRB, supra, at 672-673, 676. "
269,29," See Carroll, 241 F.Supp., at 881. We have, in fact, found no case holding that a union may extract such fees from 
independent agents who represent union members."
269,30," As already indicated, the franchise fees are not segregated in any manner but merely deposited in the union's general fund."
269,31," The respondents offer union hiring hall fees as an analogy in support of Equity's collection of franchise fees.  In that context, 
the respondents argue, without citation, that a union may impose reasonable fees upon employers to meet the costs of 
maintaining a union-run hiring hall. But even if the respondents' statement of labor law is correct, the analogy would not be 
persuasive.  Assuming that hiring hall fees are so imposed, the fees are borne by parties who directly benefit from the 
employment services of the hiring halls and are collected by the entities that provide them.  That is not true in the present case. The view expressed in the separate opinion filed today as to who are the beneficiaries of the franchising system will undoubtedly 
surprise the agents who brought this lawsuit.  Post, at 724. "
279,1," HN1[
] General Statutes § 35-26 provides: ""Every contract, combination, or conspiracy in restraint of any part of trade or commerce is unlawful."" Section 35-27 states: ""Every contract, combination, or conspiracy to monopolize, or attempt to 
monopolize, or monopolization of any part of trade or commerce is unlawful."" Section 35-28 provides in pertinent part: ""Without 
limiting section 35-26, every contract, combination, or conspiracy is unlawful when the same are for the purpose or have the 
effect of: . . . (c) allocating or dividing customers or markets . . . (d) refusing to deal, or coercing, persuading, or inducing third

of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby . . . ."" U.S. Const., art. VI."
279,3," Even without an express declaration of preemption, the nature of the congressional legislation and the subject matter may 
exclude state legislation. Bethlehem Steel Co. v. New York State Labor Relations Board, 330 U.S. 767, 772, 67 S. Ct. 1026, 91 
L. Ed. 1234 (1947). Federal regulations as well as statutes may have a preemptive effect.  See Ray v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 435 U.S. 151, 160-62, 
98 S. Ct. 988, 55 L. Ed. 2d 179 (1978); Free v. Bland, 369 U.S. 663, 667-68, 82 S. Ct. 1089, 8 L. Ed. 2d 180 (1962). "
280,4," The presumption of state jurisdiction in this case is particularly strong because federal courts have held that a federal savings 
and loan association's preemption defense does not provide federal subject matter jurisdiction for an action which arises under 
state law. Home Federal Savings & Loan Assn. v. Ins. Department of Iowa, 571 F.2d 423 (8th Cir. 1978); Michigan Savings & 
Loan League v. Francis, 490 F. Sup. 892 (E.D. Mich. 1980). See Public Service Commission v. Wycoff Co., 344 U.S. 237, 248,

committed, or in any judicial district where any of the alleged offenders reside or are found, or any agency resides or is found, or 
where any proprietor, association, firm, partnership, or corporate defendant does business."""
280,6," Our conclusion that the Connecticut courts have subject matter jurisdiction over the claims advanced by the plaintiff does not 
mean that Connecticut may apply its antitrust law to federal savings and loan associations under the averments of the 
complaint or that our courts must always proceed to resolve such disputes.  Kaski v. First Federal Savings & Loan Assn., 72 
Wis. 2d 132, 143, 240 N.W.2d 367 (1976). We have acknowledged that federal law may preempt a state statute without ousting 
state court jurisdiction over a complaint arising under the preempted statute.  Such a complaint, however, does not state a claim 
upon which relief can be granted.  Furthermore, if state law applies but an administrative agency has concurrent jurisdiction with 
Connecticut courts, a court under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction may exercise its discretion to defer to the expertise of the 
administrative agency.  Mazzola v. Southern New England Telephone Co., 169 Conn. 344, 349, 363 A.2d 170 (1975)."
280,7," The district court in California v. Coast Federal Savings & Loan Assn., 98 F. Sup. 311, 317-18 (S.D. Cal. 1951), apparently 
confused the distinct questions of exhausting administrative remedies, primary jurisdiction and exclusive subject matter 
jurisdiction in erroneously concluding that state courts had no subject matter jurisdiction over anything relating to the affairs of 
federal savings and loan associations.  Mazzola v. Southern New England Telephone Co., 169 Conn. 344, 349-50, 363 A.2d 
170 (1975), correctly differentiates the questions. "
281,8," During discussion of the Sherman Act; 26 Stat. 209, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1-7; on the floor of the United States Senate, Senator John 
Sherman said: ""This bill . . . has for its . . . object to invoke the aid of the courts of the United States to deal with the 
combinations . . . when they affect injuriously our foreign and interstate commerce . . . and in this way to supplement the "
282,," enforcement of the established rules of the common and statute law by the courts of the several States in dealing with 
combinations that affect injuriously the industrial liberty of the citizens of these states.  It is to arm the Federal courts within the 
limits of their constitutional power that they may co-operate with the State courts in checking, curbing, and controlling the most 
dangerous combinations that now threaten the business, property, and trade of the people of the United States."" 21 Cong. Rec., 
Pt. 3, p. 2457 (1890)."
282,9," State antitrust laws may not apply to union organizational activity and some other areas covered by federal antitrust laws 
because in such exceptional areas carefully tailored federal antitrust law delicately accommodates federal policies that state 
antitrust laws either harmonize differently or fail to consider.  Connell Construction Co. v. Plumbers & Steamfitters, 421 U.S. 616, 
635-37, 95 S. Ct. 1830, 44 L. Ed. 2d 418 (1975). The defendant argues that 12 C.F.R. § 563.35 (a) (3), which prohibits the conditioning of a loan upon the selection of a particular 
attorney to represent the borrower expresses the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's (board) considered judgment of the extent to 
which antitrust law applies to federal savings and loan associations' closing practices.  The general counsel of the board, 
however, has noted that that provision ""was not intended to, and does not supplant the antitrust laws in any manner."" Mortensen 
v. First Federal Savings & Loan Assn., No. 1763-73 (Coolahan, J.) (D. N.J. Nov. 3, 1977)."
282,10," For example, states may impose nondiscriminatory taxes on federal savings and loan associations.  12 U.S.C. § 1464 (h). "
283,11," Despite extensive federal regulations of trademarks and tradenames a federal court of appeals applied state law to a federal 
diversity action in which a federal savings and loan association alleged that the defendant adopted and used a confusingly 
similar name.  First Southern Federal Savings & Loan Assn. v. First Southern Savings & Loan Assn., 614 F.2d 71, 74 (5th Cir. 
1980). After the effective date of a specific federal regulation that governed the practice, the Oregon Supreme Court applied state law to 
a federal savings and loan association in a suit brought on behalf of borrowers claiming entitlement to the income the 
association, by investing funds the borrowers deposited with it for payment of taxes and insurance premiums on their dwellings, 
derived prior to the effective date of the federal regulation. Derenco, Inc. v. Benjamin Franklin Federal Savings & Loan Assn.,

283,12," The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held that a state may not subject a federal savings and loan 
association to state procedures providing for monitoring, notice, complaint resolution, and enforcement to ensure compliance 
with a state law prohibiting discrimination in lending based upon consideration of a borrower's race, color, religion, sex, marital 
status, national origin, ancestry or due to consideration of conditions in the neighborhood or geographic area surrounding the 
borrower's housing accommodations.  Conference of Federal Savings & Loan Assns. v. Stein, 604 F.2d 1256, 1257 (9th Cir.

savings and loan associations.  Meyers v. Beverly Hills Federal Savings & Loan Assn., 499 F.2d 1145 (9th Cir. 1974). The Second Circuit has held that federal law governs the access of members of a federal savings and loan association to lists of 
persons eligible to vote at the association's annual meeting.  Murphy v. Colonial Federal Savings & Loan Assn., 388 F.2d 609, 
611-12 (2d Cir. 1967). The Wisconsin Supreme Court has held that federal law determines the validity of an interest rate escape clause, challenged as 
unconscionable, vague, and indefinite, when the clause appears in a mortgage note given to a federal savings and loan 
association.  Kaski v. First Federal Savings & Loan Assn., 72 Wis. 2d 132, 240 N.W.2d 367 (1976)."

occupied or to be occupied by the borrower, an insured institution or subsidiary thereof may require such borrower to reimburse 
it for legal services rendered by its attorney, or to directly pay such attorney for such services, only if: (1) Such attorney's fee is 
limited to legal services, attributable to processing and closing such loan (and not unrelated services performed for the institution 
or subsidiary by the attorney); (2) Such attorney's fee, if in excess of $ 100, is supported by a statement provided to the borrower

being performed; and (4) Such attorney's fee is separately itemized on the loan settlement sheet and identified as a fee to the 
lender's attorney."""
284,16," In Connecticut, the quality and validity of a lender's lien on real estate are customarily affirmed by a written opinion from the 
lender's attorney.  The defendant does not have house counsel.  It uses a number of attorneys throughout Fairfield and New 
Haven Counties to represent it in mortgage loan transactions.  In the vast majority of transactions, the defendant (unlike other 
institutions) does not review or pass upon any of the closing papers in advance of the scheduled closing.  The defendant may 
have four or five closings on a given day.  The defendant's closings do not take place in its offices, but in its attorney's office.  
None of its officers or employees attend.  The defendant relies solely and exclusively upon its closing counsel to make a title 
search, to provide it with a certificate of title certifying that the mortgage is a first lien on the property, to ensure that the property 
will be marketable upon default, and to prepare the mortgage note, deed, tax bill authorization, closing statement and signature 
card.  In many instances, the defendant's attorney must prepare a financing statement creating a lien on personal property, an 
assignment of rents, an escrow agreement, and documents creating easements appurtenant to the mortgaged property. "
285,17," On occasion the committee has waived one or the other of the guidelines.  For example, the committee approved an attorney 
who has lectured on real estate law throughout the country and had closed 125 mortgage transactions in his year of practice in 
Connecticut."
285,18," In closing transactions the lender and the borrower are generally both interested in obtaining clear title to the property.  Their 
interests, however, may sometimes conflict.  For example, an easement may be acceptable to a borrower but not to the lender. 
The defendant tries to impress attorneys who represent both it and a borrower in a mortgage loan transaction that the attorney's 
legal obligation is to protect the defendant's interest, and in the event of a conflict to apprise it of all the facts that may adversely 
affect its interest. "

295,7," Of course, not all equitable principles apply in antitrust cases.  For example, in Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. International Parts 
Corp., 392 U.S. 134 (1968), the Court held that traditional notions of in pari delicto would not bar a franchisee from recovering 
from its franchisor even though the franchisee had sought a franchise and thus, to some degree, acquiesced in the scheme 
alleged to be illegal. "
296,8," Economists disagree over whether business decisionmakers, be they the high-level or the middle-level management, are ""risk 
averse""; i. e., they would prefer a greater certainty of a small loss to a less certain chance of a greater loss.  Compare K. Elzinga

296,10," In Northwest Airlines, we decided that no such right exists under the Equal Pay Act or Title VII, and we declined to fashion 
such a right from federal common law. "
297,11," That Congress knows how to define a right to contribution is shown by the express actions for contribution under § 11 (f) of the 
Securities Act of 1933, 15 U. S. C. § 77k (f), and §§ 9 (e) and 18 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U. S. C. §§ 78i 
(e) and 78r (b).  Some courts have extrapolated from these provisions that when an implied right of action exists under the 
securities laws, there also is an implied right to contribution. See, e. g., Heizer Corp. v. Ross, 601 F.2d 330 (CA7 1979); Globus, 
Inc. v. Law Research Service, Inc., 318 F.Supp. 955 (SDNY), aff'd, 442 F.2d 1346 (CA2), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 941 (1971); De 
Haas v. Empire Petroleum Co., 286 F.Supp. 809 (Colo. 1968), aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 435 F.2d 1223 (CA10 1970). We 
intimate no view as to the correctness of these decisions; in any event, they do not support implication of a right to contribution 
when a statute expressly creates a damages action but does not provide for contribution.  See Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. 
Transport Workers, ante, at 91-92, n. 24. "

cases do not directly involve state boundaries, disputes over which more often come to this Court under our original jurisdiction; 
they nonetheless involve especial federal concerns to which federal common law applies.  In Hinderlider v. La Plata River & 
Cherry Creek Ditch Co., supra, at 110, decided the same day as Erie, the Court observed: ""Jurisdiction over controversies concerning rights in interstate streams is not different from those concerning boundaries.  These

299,16," Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U. S. C. § 15, which provides the private treble-damages action, derives from § 7 of the 
Sherman Act as originally enacted.  See H. R. Rep. No. 627, 63d Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 1, p. 14 (1914).  Congress repealed the 
original § 7 in 1955, Act of July 7, 1955, ch. 283, 69 Stat. 282, as being redundant of Clayton Act § 4, H. R. Rep. No. 422, 84th

299,17," Courts, of course, should be wary of relying on the remarks of a single legislator, and Senator Morgan's comments are not 
unambiguous.  Yet it is clear that when the Sherman Act was adopted the common law did not provide a right to contribution 
among tortfeasors participating in proscribed conduct.  One permissible, though not mandatory, inference is that Congress relied 
on courts' continuing to apply principles in effect at the time of enactment.  See, e. g., Edmonds v. Compagnie Generale

1446, were consolidated for trial below. The fourth, Pote v. Washington-Lee Savings and Loan Association, No. 81-1005, was 
consolidated with the others on appeal."
304,2," .  Williams, et al. v. First Federal Savings and Loan Association, et al., involving three of the transactions before us, attacks only 
on the grounds that the due-on-sale clauses were not triggered, in view of the form the transactions took. Pote v. Washington-
Lee Savings and Loan Association raises that question and the additional contention as well, that, if the due-on-sale clause was, 
indeed, triggered, it was, nevertheless, legally unenforceable. "
305,," A preliminary matter for consideration is the one of our jurisdiction to hear the cases. The Pote case presents no problem 
inasmuch as the parties are diverse. The Potes are residents of Michigan. The persons to whom they sold, the Saltos, are 
residents of Columbia. The defendant Washington-Lee Savings and Loan Association is a Virginia corporation with its principal 
office in Virginia. Jurisdiction in the other three cases is not quite so certain. No diversity jurisdiction has been asserted, presumably because of 
the commonality of citizenship of some of the homeowners and of the lenders. However, in the case of Williams v. First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Arlington, a federal question under 28 U.S.C. 
§ 1331 has been raised. The deed of trust in that case was executed on April 27, 1977, well after the June 8, 1976 effective date 
of regulations of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (""FHLBB""), originally codified as 12 C.F.R. § 545.6-11(f) and (g) and 
recodified in 1980 as 12 C.F.R. § 545.8-3(f) and (g). HN1[
] Those regulations provide, inter alia: An association continues to have the power to include, as a matter of contract between it and the borrower, a provision in its 
loan instrument whereby the association may, at its option, declare immediately due and payable sums secured by the 
association's security instrument if all or any part of the real property securing the loan is sold or transferred by the borrower 
without the association's prior written consent…. The deed of trust, on a uniform instrument form for use in Virginia for deeds of trust within the purview of operations by the 
Federal National Mortgage Association (""FNMA"") and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (""FHLMC""), employed 
essentially the regulation language: If all or any part of the Property or an interest therein is sold or transferred by Borrower without Lender's prior written consent, … 
Lender may, at Lender's option, declare all sums secured by this Deed of Trust to be immediately due and payable. Thus, the federal question arises as to whether, as a matter of contract between the lender and the borrower, a provision having 
been included declaring immediately due and payable the deed of trust if all or any part of the real property securing the loan 
was sold or transferred, the transactions through which Mrs. Bailey and the Williams changed beneficial ownership constituted a 
sale or transfer as contemplated by the regulation. It is true that the deed of trust states that it shall be governed by the law of Virginia, the jurisdiction in which the property is 
located. That language, however, relates to the validity or invalidity of provisions and does not extend to questions of which, as 
between competing interpretations, should be accorded language when either would be perfectly valid. The other two cases (Boyd v. Arlington-Fairfax Savings and Loan Association and Milne v. Herndon Federal Savings and Loan 
Association) are less certain as to jurisdiction, either because the association is state chartered or because the deed of trust, 
while to a federal savings and loan association, antedated the FHLBB regulations and did not conform to them in its language. 
Nevertheless, we proceed on the belief that they, too, properly raise a federal question. If, in fact, they should have been 
dismissed for want of jurisdiction, in view of the conclusions we have reached on the law, the result would not, because of stare 
decisis, significantly differ from a holding affirming the lower court."
305,3," .  See Larchmont Homes, Inc. v. Annandale Water Co., 201 Va. 178, 181, 110 S.E.2d 249, 251 (1959) (""Black defines a deed of 
trust at page 503 as ""an instrument in use in many states, taking the place and serving the uses of a common-law mortgage, by 
which the legal title to real property is placed in one or more trustees, to secure the repayment of a sum of money or the 
performance of other conditions.' ""); Yasuna v. Miller, 399 A.2d 68, 71-72 (D.C.Ct. of App.1979) (""Deeds of trust are viewed as 
generally equivalent to common-law mortgages, a mortgage being by definition an interest in property given as security for the "
306,," payment of a debt.""); LeBrun v. Prosise, 197 Md. 466, 473-74, 79 A.2d 543, 547 (1951) (""This deed of trust is like deeds of trust 
which, we understand, are generally used in Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia in lieu of mortgages and are not 
infrequently so used in Montgomery and Prince George's Counties and perhaps in other counties bordering on the Potomac. It is 
also similar to deeds of trust ordinarily executed by corporations to secure issues of negotiable or transferable bonds. For most 
purposes any such deed of trust is a mortgage, … and is subject to some (but not all) statutory provisions relating to 
mortgages…. On the other hand, some statutory provisions distinguish between ""mortgage' or ""deed in the nature of a mortgage' 
and ""deeds of trust in the nature of mortgages' ….""); but cf.  Billingsley v. Mitchell, 257 Md. 301, 304, 262 A.2d 746, 747 (1970) 
(""… a deed of trust securing a debt although it serves the purpose and performs the function of a mortgage is not in the eyes of 
the Maryland law a mortgage or a deed in the nature of a mortgage, …."")."
306,4," .  Thus, for example, the mortgagor owns an equity of redemption. A trustee, like a mortgagee, holds legal title, and the 
borrower has only equitable interests.  E. g. Everette v. Woodward, 162 Va. 419, 426, 174 S.E. 864, 867 (1934) (""The trustee's 
power of sale is coupled with an interest; that is, he holds the legal title, while the grantor in the trust deed has the equitable 
title."")."
306,5," .  Some of the precise figures for the Bailey-Williams transaction do not appear in the record. We deprecate the failure of 
counsel to include in the record so relevant a document as the note secured by the deed of trust from the Baileys, containing as 
it does particulars of the loan terms. We have been able, nevertheless, to make reasonably accurate approximations. The 
figures need be only approximate for the illustrative purposes they serve. Thus the 1977 interest rate applicable to the Bailey's borrowing from First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Arlington 
was somewhere between 10% and 10.25% per annum. For convenience, we shall refer to the annual interest rate payable by 
Mrs. Bailey as 10%."
306,6," .  Three of the four deeds of trust (one for each of the consolidated cases) employed a June, 1975 uniform instrument of the 
FNMA and the FHLMC, instrumentalities which, in conjunction with the FHLBB operated to further interests of the Federal 
Government in the residential lending area. Two of the four lenders (First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Arlington and 
Herndon Federal Savings and Loan Association) include in their titles the word ""federal."" Interestingly, the only lender to use 
another deed of trust form than the uniform FNMA-FHLMC document was one of the federal associations, Herndon Federal 
Savings and Loan Association. In the case of Arlington-Fairfax Savings and Loan Association, the appellants treated it as a 
federal association, asserting in the Complaint that it is ""a federal savings and loan association under the provisions of the Home 
Owner's Loan Act, 12 U.S.C. § 1461 et seq. (Arlington-Fairfax converted)."" Similarly, with respect to Washington-Lee Savings 
and Loan Association the Complaint alleged: ""The Defendant is a state chartered Savings and Loan Association: a Federal 
Home Loan Bank Member; Seller Servicer for the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and an insured institution of the 
Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation"" and ""a Federally related Lender."" "
307,, In all events the deed of trust forms employed in general represented a nationwide federal policy favoring due-on-sale clauses.
307,7," .  The language in the Bailey deed of trust on April 27, 1977, in favor of First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Arlington 
read: ""Transfer of the Property; Assumption. If all or any of the Property or an interest therein is sold or transferred by Borrower 
without Lender's prior written consent, excluding (a) Creation of a lien or encumbrance subordinate to this Deed of Trust … 
Lender may, at Lender's option, declare all the sums secured by this Deed of Trust to be immediately due and payable…."" That language, from Section 17 of the Uniform FNMA-FHLMC instrument form, also was used in the case of the Pote deed of 
trust to Washington-Lee Savings and Loan Association dated March 14, 1976. For another lender, Arlington-Fairfax Savings and Loan Association (the borrower being Mary S. Boyd), the phraseology under 
the deed of trust of November 29, 1977, initially was identical with that appearing in the Bailey-Williams and Pote deeds of trust. 
However, by an agreement of modification, also dated November 29, 1977, the language was changed to read: ""IN THE EVENT 
TITLE to the property above described is transferred, the unpaid balance of the indebtedness hereby secured shall be 
immediately due and payable, at the option of the party of the third part."" In the case of Herndon Federal Savings and Loan Association, which had on June 24, 1975, made a secured loan to John K. 
Milne et ux. the language ran: ""If the aforesaid described property is sold or conveyed prior to the maturity date of the note 
hereinabove described and secured hereby, the said note shall be immediately due and payable in full at the option of the holder 
thereof."" Each deed of trust in the consolidated cases also contained in the margin the following capitalized statement: NOTICE: THE DEBT SECURED HEREBY IS SUBJECT TO CALL IN FULL OR THE TERMS THEREOF BEING MODIFIED IN 
THE EVENT OF SALE OR CONVEYANCE OF THE PROPERTY CONVEYED (or SECURED HEREBY). The statement was mandated by Va.Ann.Code § 6.1-330.34 reading: Where any loan is made secured by a mortgage or deed of trust on real property … and the note, or mortgage or deed of trust 
evidencing such loan contains a provision that the holder of the note secured by such mortgage or deed of trust may accelerate 
payment of or renegotiate the terms of such loan upon sale or conveyance of the security property or part thereof, then the 
mortgage or deed of trust shall contain in the body or on the margin thereof a (the following) statement, either in capital letters or 
underlined: ""Notice The debt secured hereby is subject to call in full or the terms thereof being modified in the event of sale or 
conveyance of the property conveyed (secured hereby)."" The bracketed language appeared in the initial enactment by Ch. 292 of the Acts of 1974. The word immediately before the 
bracketed language, in each case, was substituted by Ch. 448 of the Acts of 1975, and, for our purposes, effected no 
substantive alteration. A companion statute, Va.Ann.Code § 6.1-330.33, contemporaneously enacted and reenacted in 1974 and 1975, prohibited any 
lender from collecting or receiving any prepayment penalty if prepayment should result from the enforcement of the right to call 
the loan upon the sale of the real property securing the loan."
307,8," .  For example, an unencumbered house might have a market value of $ 100,000. If it had an unexpired mortgage or deed of 
trust on it covering an outstanding unpaid balance of $ 50,000 payable over another 27 years at a rate of 10%, and that 
obligation could be transferred, in today's market that house would realize something in the neighborhood of $ 115,000, i. e. 
more than the property free and clear of all liens and encumbrances would bring. It is no answer to that somewhat anomalous state of affairs that the person owning the house outright could also realize $ 
115,000 by himself granting a purchase money mortgage or purchase money deed of trust at 10% for 27 years. The extension of 
such unrealistically favorable borrowing terms would represent an economic disadvantage here capable of evaluation at $ 
15,000. The outright owner of his house who would have to impose on himself the $ 15,000 economic disadvantage would "
308,," consequently be worse off than a couple who, were they able to effect a transfer of the loan, would be able to keep the entire $ 
15,000, placing the economic disadvantage on a third party, the deed of trust lender. So, Mrs. Bailey and her co-appellants 
argue for a result under which they would be better off than a prudent couple who owned their home free and clear. In the case of a property worth $ 100,000 if totally unencumbered, which is subject to a mortgage or deed of trust with 27 years 
still to run at an interest rate of 10% per annum, and the outstanding unpaid principal amounting to $ 50,000, let us assume that 
buyers would be willing to pay cash of $ 65,000, and either (a) assume the favorable 10% mortgage of $ 50,000, or (b), if they 
must, go into the current mortgage market and pay its equivalent. The equivalent, in approximate terms, would be a $ 35,000 27 
year mortgage at 15%. (The monthly level payments on $ 50,000 at 10% per annum would be substantially the same as the 
monthly payments on $ 35,000 at 15%.) Under the former procedure, the selling couple would net $ 65,000, since they would need pay nothing towards satisfaction of 
the deed of trust note (assuming no subsequent default by the buyers). Under the latter procedure, however, the deed of trust 
note would have to be satisfied in full. The application of the $ 35,000 in new borrowing would still leave unpaid $ 15,000 which 
would have to come out of the $ 65,000 so that the sellers would net $ 50,000. Since the seller, for a $ 100,000 house, would be freed of an outstanding obligation of $ 50,000, and additionally receive $ 
50,000 in cash, he would be as well off economically as a homeowner having title free and clear, and netting $ 100,000. Mrs. Bailey's contentions, consequently, were they to succeed, would yield to her not only whatever profit inheres in the rise in 
the real estate market (in the world of today, it was to be expected that she and Mr. Bailey bought the house for less than the $ 
79,903.63 which was the price at which she sold to the Williams. The purchase price was, in fact, $ 63,831.) It would also 
additionally confer on her an artificial profit attributable to the decline in value of the deed of trust loan. ""What the seller is then 
selling is his mortgage rate, and not his property…. the mortgagor has already benefited from the loan terms, and providing the 
benefit of transferability of those terms in a pricing context … is a windfall."" Article, Enforcement of Due-on-Transfer Clauses, 13 
Real Property, Probate and Trust Journal 891, 926, 930 (1978) (hereafter ""Enforcement""). Yet the Baileys were not the 
investors, the risk takers, on the loan. Nothing in reason commends a rule which would lead to such a windfall."
308,9," .  As it happens, Mrs. Bailey enjoyed another advantage not vouch-safed to all home borrowers. First Federal Savings and Loan 
Association of Arlington had sold a 90% interest in her obligation to the FHLMC. Consequently, purchasers from her, if credit-
worthy, could arrange assumption for a 1% assumption fee."
308,10," .  The assertion is made, mind you, despite the candid admission in Appellants' reply brief that: ""Some Appellants, indeed, sold 
their ""principal residences' … to other Appellants who use the residences as their ""homes.' "" "
310,11," .  Counsel for appellants has written a brochure describing what was assigned as ""the exclusive right to exercise the normal 
incidents of ownership."""
310,12," .  The argument derives from the provision in Va.Ann.Code § 55-17.1 governing creation of land trusts stating that the interest 
of a beneficiary of a land trust should ""be deemed to be personal property."" The language was added to the statute in 1975. But such ""deeming"" could not, by the express terms of the statute be ""construed … to affect any right which a creditor may 
otherwise have against a trustee or beneficiary…."""
310,13," .  The appellants frankly concede in their Brief that the Williams ""now enjoy the structure as their home."" Indeed, it goes further than that. Paul D. Scanlon, Esq. and Paul D. Scanlon, Ltd., which we take to be a professional 
association controlled by him, not only argued for all appellants in the consolidated cases. Paul D. Scanlon, or his professional 
association, was a participant in the transactions leading up to the litigation, accepting fees from both buyer and seller in each 
case. Counsel for appellants, therefore, can hardly fail to contend that he effectively produced, in return for his fees, a beneficial 
holding in the Williams, Mr. Nault, the Bittners and the Saltos, respectively, equal in substance to that which a customary real 
estate transaction involving purchase of a home would have provided."
310,14," .  The contract further incorporated into itself by reference the language of ""a form contract"" for ""the sale and purchase of real 
estate, setting forth the terms and conditions of sale between the parties and warranties, covenants and conditions to be 
performed by the respective parties"" provided only that the subject matter of the contract should be ""THE BENEFICIAL 
INTEREST IN THE LAND TRUST HEREIN ABOVE MENTIONED."" In a purely conclusory way, manifestly not binding on the lender under the deed of trust, who was not a party to the contracts 
between Mrs. Bailey and the Williams, nor binding on the court as to what the contract in fact constituted or accomplished, the 
contract added: ""The use of the attached contract form is for the convenience of the parties and is in no way to be interpreted as 
contemplating or intending that the parties are agreeing to sell or purchase a real estate interest, either legal or equitable."" The 
plain fact is that the Williams did purchase an interest in real estate from Mrs. Bailey, whether or not, as between themselves, 
they might choose to treat it as personalty. Two of us may agree that the emperor is clothed, and are, therefore, estopped to 
deny that he is bcaparisoned cap-a-pie. A third party is nonetheless free to cry out the true fact that his imperial majesty is as 
naked as the day he was born."
310,15," .  See Larchmont Homes, Inc. v. Annandale Water Co., supra, 201 Va. at 181, 110 S.E.2d at 251 where the meaning of 
conveyance is discussed. Black's Law Dictionary is quoted: In real property law. In the strict legal sense, a transfer of legal title to land. In the popular sense, and as generally used by 
lawyers, it denotes any transfer of title, legal or equitable…. "
311,16," .  The argument has a fundamental frailty. Bouvier contains an enlightening discussion of the definition of ""Title"" derived from 
Blackstone: There are several stages or degrees requisite to form a complete title to lands and tenements. The lowest and most imperfect 
degree of title is a presumptive title or the mere possession, or actual occupation of the estate, without any apparent right to hold 
or continue such possession …. The next step to a good and perfect title is the right of possession, which may reside in one man 
while the actual possession is not in himself, but in another."
311,2," Bouvier's Law Dictionary, p. 3281 (8th ed. 1914) (emphasis in original). Thus a couple such as the Williams had a kind of title, however it was denominated, since they had the full right of occupancy or 
possession. Indeed, it should be noted that what reliance appellants place in the word ""title"" is confined exclusively to the Boyd-Fairfax 
Savings and Loan Association deed of trust. There the due-on-sale clause operates if the ""title is transferred."" As to the others, 
the controlling language is ""Property or an interest therein is sold or transferred,"" or ""property is sold or conveyed."" In each of 
those cases, the property, irrespective of whether it was real property or personal property, was unmistakably ""sold."" Cf.  
Chapman v. Ford, 246 Md. 42, 46, 227 A.2d 26, 27 (1967), holding that an oral agreement, unenforceable under the statute of 
frauds, constituted a sale for purposes of a provision reading: ""in the event the Mortgagors sell the property hereby mortgaged 
…."" Of course, over and beyond its other defects, the improbability of the reading advocated by appellants is fatal. In choosing 
language to create ""uniform covenants for national use … to constitute a uniform security instrument covering real property,"" the 
federal agencies never intended that the transfers with which we are here concerned should be entirely free of the due-on-sale 
clause. Such an interpretation would obliterate the uniformity sought. Nor is it an answer for appellants to point to the language of the FNMA-FHLMC deed of trust form reading: ""This Deed of Trust 
shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Property is located."" Apart from the restraint on alienation and 
antitrust contentions which we shall hereafter demonstrate to be unfounded, there is nothing in Virginia law which would 
preclude a definition of ""sale,"" ""conveyance,"" or ""transfer"" so as to reach the land trust transactions entered among the 
appellants. We find as a matter of construction that the due-on-sale clauses in all of the consolidated cases were triggered."
311,17," .  Cf. the rule that insurance policies will be construed most strictly against the insurer. 17 Am.Jur.2d § 276, p. 690 (1972); 4 
Williston On Contracts, § 621, pp. 764-72 (3d ed. 1961)."
311,18," .  As restraints on alienation are not favored, conditions against alienation are strictly construed, and, even if they would 
otherwise be valid, are ineffectual unless certainly and clearly expressed. 61 Am.Jur.2d § 96 at 94 (1972). However, as we shall 
later elaborate, there is here no forbidden restraint on alienation."
311,19," .  See 17 Am.Jur.2d § 276, p. 691 (1972): These principles apply only where a contract is open to more than one reasonable construction, and should not be applied to 
reach an unreasonable construction in defiance of the terms of the contract, or to overturn the intention of the parties when it is 
clearly manifest from the entire contract. Furthermore, the rule that expressions will be interpreted against the party selecting 
and using them applies only where, after the ordinary rules of construction have been applied, the agreement is still ambiguous. 
(Footnotes omitted). "
312,20," .  In construction of a contract, the purpose of the contract is more important than the academic definition of the words used.  
Krikorian v. Dailey, 171 Va. 16, 197 S.E. 442 (1938)."
312,21," .  In another context, Dean, later Solicitor General, Erwin N. Griswold, impressive teacher and distinguished lawyer, used a 
telling phrase to deal with situations, in the federal tax area, in which practitioners, by exalting the formality of words over their 
true substance, would seek to obtain unwarranted, unreasonable, and unfair advantages. The cases would inevitably be lost, to 
the infinite disgust of the ingenious practitioners. Dean Erwin N. Griswold called them ""You think you're smart cases."" See, e. g., 
Gregory v. Helvering, 293 U.S. 465, 469-70, 55 S. Ct. 266, 267-68, 79 L. Ed. 596 (1935): Putting aside, then, the question of motive in respect of taxation altogether, and fixing the character of the proceeding by what 
actually occurred, what do we find? Simply an operation having no business or corporate purpose a mere device which put on 
the form of a corporate reorganization as a disguise for concealing its real character …. In these circumstances, the facts speak for themselves and are susceptible of but one interpretation. The whole undertaking, 
though conducted according to the terms of subdivision (B), was in fact an elaborate and devious form of conveyance 
masquerading as a corporate reorganization, and nothing else. The rule which excludes from consideration the motive of tax 
avoidance is not pertinent to the situation, because the transaction upon its face lies outside the plain intent of the statute. To 
hold otherwise would be to exalt artifice above reality …."
312,22," .  A beneficial ownership interest is not an encumbrance. See, e. g., Annotated Code of Virginia § 8.9-105(g): "" ""Encumbrance' 
includes real estate mortgages and other rights in real estate that are not ownership interests ;"" (Emphasis added). Appellants do not appear to contend that the beneficial ownership interests are a ""lien."" They are right not to do so. While that 
term is capable of a variety of uses, here it evidently signifies the customary meaning: ""a claim … upon the property … as a 
security for some debt or charge."" 2 Bouvier's Law Dictionary, p. 1978. Again, beneficial ownership interests are not 
encompassed within the word ""lien."" "
313,," In sum, the rights to beneficial ownership, possession, and enjoyment fall outside the concept of ""lien or encumbrance."""
313,23," .  The authorization reads: An association continues to have the power to include, as a matter of contract between it and the borrower, a provision in its 
loan instrument whereby the association may, at its option, declare immediately due and payable sums secured by the 
association's security instrument if all or any part of the real property securing the loan is sold or transferred by the borrower 
without the association's prior written consent."
313,12," C.F.R. § 545.8-3(f) (formerly 12 C.F.R. § 545.6-11(f)). However, the regulations in 12 C.F.R. § 545.8-3(g) go on to prohibit exercise of a due-on-sale clause as a consequence of 
""creation of a lien or other encumbrance subordinate to the association's security instrument."""
313,24," .  Appellants appear to have abandoned a final argument asserted in their complaint: ""Finally, Plaintiff Beneficiaries are 
""assigns' of Mortgagors per P 15 (sic) of the deed of trust. (Presumably the reference was intended to be P 13)."" In all events the 
contention is totally unpersuasive. The assignment provisions of the deed of trust explicitly state that they are ""subject to the 
provisions of paragraph 17 hereof."" Paragraph 17 contains the due-on-sale clause."
313,25," .  Appellants' counsel traces the origins of the legal concept outlawing unreasonable restraints on alienation to the 1290 Statute 
Quia Emptores, the Statute of Westminster, 18 Edw. I. ch. 1. That statute, eliminating the feudal relationship of the feoffee to all 
mesne lords beneath the king, and limiting to the king the right to impose restraints on alienation, is only of historical interest. 
There has been little occasion to invoke the statute in the United States, because of the allodial nature of holdings in this 
country. 28 Am.Jur.2d pp. 74-75 (Estates § 4). Tenure in Virginia is allodial. 1 Minor, Real Property, § 16 (2d ed. 1928). In considering the due-on-sale clause it merits remembering that it is ""imposed"" not by a predecessor in the homeowner's chain 
of title a mesne landlord, but by a collateral lender concerned with security for its loan. Quia Emptores hardly seems to extend to 
such matters. Nevertheless, regardless of the source, there is a general rule forbidding the fettering of rights of ownership so as to permit 
someone else to control its alienation or use. 61 Am.Jur.2d p. 108 (Perpetuities and Restraints on Alienation, § 100). At the 
same time, a limited and reasonable restraint on the power of alienation may be valid. Id. p. 111, § 102. For our purposes, we 
need not finally determine whether there is no restraint of alienation at all. The result will not differ, should we conclude that there 
was no restraint, or should we determine that, if there be restraint, it is reasonable. Application of the doctrine outlawing 
unreasonable restraints does not appear to turn on whether the relation of the person creating or enjoying the restraint is in the 
direct line of title, or a collateral one. "

314,27," .  See Conference of Federal Savings and Loan Associations v. Stein, supra, 495 F. Supp. at 17: California law with respect to the validity and exercisability of due-on-sale clauses in the loan instruments of the plaintiff Federal 
associations is inapplicable whether such instruments were executed before or after the effective date of 12 C.F.R. § 545.6-11(f) 
and (g). See also, Bailey v. First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Ottawa, 467 F. Supp. 1139 (D.C. C.D. Ill.1979)."
314,28," .  We are fortunately spared the complications associated with what to do where a due-on-sale clause is valid under federal 
law, but in a particular case leads to a result which state law would disallow as inequitable. See First Federal Savings and Loan 
Association of Englewood v. Lockwood, 385 So.2d 156, 160 (Fla.App.1980) (""The true issue before us is not whether a due-on-
sale clause may be authorized or even required in a federal association mortgage instrument, but whether the due-on-sale 
clause must be automatically enforced by a state court without regard to traditional principles of equity…. We answer the 
question by stating that a plaintiff who initiates a suit in equity must be subject to all of the applicable consequences of that 
action and not merely those to which he chooses to submit.""). Cf.  Tucker v. Pulaski Federal Savings & Loan Association, 252 
Ark. 849, 853, 481 S.W.2d 725, 728 (1972) (""… appellee cannot, simply on the basis of the quoted clause, accelerate the "
315,," note…. This procedure cannot be countenanced in a court of equity.""). Of course, the election of the Potes and the Saltos to 
initiate the action in federal, rather than state, court weakens their posture on that point. However, it is of no significance in any event, since we conclude that the due-on-sale clause is valid and enforceable in the 
Potes case under Virginia law. Similarly, it, therefore, is not necessary to explore the possibility that the deed of trust language 
means ""the law of the state in which the property is located as preempted or supplemented by federal law."" Great Western 
Union Federal Savings and Loan Association v. Walters, U.S.D.C. W.D.Wash. No. C-79-906V, June 18, 1980 (emphasis

315,29," .   Occidental Savings and Loan Association v. Venco Partnership, 206 Neb. 469, 471, 293 N.W.2d 843, 845 (1980) (""An 
examination of the law pertaining to restraints on alienation makes it clear that a ""due-on-sale' clause is not a restraint on 
alienation and cannot be so considered for any purpose, theoretical or practical."") The due-on-sale clause, standing by itself, can 
hardly be a restraint on alienation. In the first place, its effect is to remove a lien or encumbrance namely the security deed of 
trust and thereby render the parcel of land more alienable not less. Moreover, and perhaps more importantly, the homeowner 
whose property is subject to a due-on-sale clause is as free to sell, and, in selling, to realize as much as a homeowner holding 
the same property free and clear of any encumbrance. See note 8, supra. Cf. ""Enforcement,"" supra, at 926: To label the loss of a purported favorable economic position as a restraint on alienation is a misconception of that doctrine, 
which was not intended to provide profitability of alienation, but only the ability to alienate without penalty. The point is tellingly made by Justice Clark dissenting in Wellenkamp v. Bank of America, 21 Cal.3d 943, 954, 148 Cal.Rptr. 379, 
386, 582 P.2d 970, 977 (1978): Additionally, the majority opinion awards the owner of the encumbered real property a bonus in that he can now sell his property 
for something in excess of what he could sell it for if unencumbered. We have thus come full circle. In attempting to take away contractual rights of lenders in order to assist borrowers in selling 
encumbered properties, the majority opinion has devised a scheme which affords yesterday's borrower a clear advantage over 
today's seller who comes to the marketplace with his property free from encumbrance. The majority's attempted rebuttal reads (21 Cal.3d at 951, 148 Cal.Rptr. at 384 n.7, 582 P.2d at 975 n.7): The argument of the dissent that our holding places the seller of encumbered real property at a ""competitive advantage"" over the 
seller of unencumbered real property in periods of rising interest and tight money simply misses the point. The fact that market 
conditions may operate to hamper the sale of some real property during such periods certainly cannot be held to justify the 
hampering of all such sales regardless of whatever financing arrangements may be outstanding against such property. Sellers of 
unencumbered real property have presumably benefited from lower interest rates in achieving their position. To require sellers of 
encumbered real property, who have not enjoyed this benefit, to suffer from market contingencies along with those who have, is 
to take a very narrow view of ""competitive advantage."" In any event we here concern ourselves with the effect of due-on "
316,," provisions in the sale of properties subject to existing financing not with the effect of market conditions upon properties not 
subject to existing financing. The dissent exposes that combination of non-sequitur and unsupported assumptions for what it is (21 Cal.3d at 957, 148 
Cal.Rptr. at 388 n.3, 582 P.2d at 979 n.3): The majority cling to the thesis that its decision today serves to eliminate restraints on alienation. However, in footnote 7 (ante, p. 
951 (of 21 Cal.3d, 148 Cal.Rptr. at 384, 582 P.2d at 975)) it concedes its concern only for properties with existing financing to 
the disadvantage of unencumbered properties, when such properties are competing on the same market. In an attempt to justify 
its lack of equal concerns, it argues that sellers of unencumbered real property ""have presumably benefitted (sic) from lower 
interest rates in achieving their position,"" and now such advantage should be balanced in favor of those who have not benefited 
(sic), they being the sellers of encumbered real property. The presumption by the majority is completely gratuitous nothing in the 
record nor in sound reason supports it. See ""Enforcement,"" supra, at 926: This logic problem is cogently noted in Mr. Justice Clark's dissenting opinion in Wellenkamp (Cal.). To make the point in another way, consider that the due-on-sale clause does not preclude, forbid, or deter sale of the property 
free and clear at any time. It concerns instead only the time when the borrower must pay his obligation. It could hardly be 
seriously contended that, if a loan secured by a deed of trust to provide funds to purchase a house were, from the outset 
payable on demand, it would amount to an unreasonable restraint of alienation. So how can it be an unreasonable restraint of 
alienation for the loan to be payable on demand under some conditions (in case of sale), and payable at fixed period intervals 
under other conditions (in case of continued ownership and occupancy)? The loan is on terms more favorable to the borrowers 
than a totally demand loan would be, or the terms of a variable interest rate deed of trust, which a demand deed of trust in 
important particulars strongly resembles. Correspondingly, ""(t)he economic effect of the variable interest rate mortgage and the 
exercise of the due-on clause to achieve an interest rate increase cannot be vastly different. ""Enforcement,"" supra, at 930. The 
Potes seek to convert an advantage obtained by them when they first borrowed to buy the house, which there was no legal 
obligation for the lender to provide, into an even greater advantage. What the Potes argue is that, when they acquired the property, they should have been granted a better deal, allowing full rights 
to maintain the full 30 year term status of the loan, despite a change in the home ownership. The economics, if the loan 
agreement so provided, certainly, as long as conditions of rising interest rates continue, would then have been more attractive to 
the home buyer. On that reasoning, however, to call the due-on-sale clause a restraint on a subsequent alienation would 
logically constitute the use of 10% as the annual interest rate, instead of 7%, or 6%, or, indeed, any interest rate, an 
unreasonable restraint on alienation, as would, in fact, the requirement that the principal of the loan ever be repaid. The 
subsequent sale will be less attractive if the loan must be met. See ""Enforcement,"" supra, at 926: The reduction of the purchase price brought about by the increase of interest rate should do nothing more than reduce the price 
of the property to that market rate commanded by similar properties which are not encumbered. The seller must use the 
favorable mortgage rate as a factor in establishing the price of the property, in excess of that available for unencumbered 
property. Thus, the reduction in price is nothing more than the loss of a ""premium"" engendered by the mortgage rate. It is simply a misperception to eviscerate, as the California majority in Wellenkamp appears ready to eviscerate, as a restraint on 
alienation, a clause that only precludes the homeowner from realizing an additional and unbargained for economic advantage 
because interest rates have risen since the time when he secured, by mortgage or deed of trust, his promise to repay what he 
borrowed. Cf.  Nichols v. Ann Arbor Federal Savings and Loan Association, 73 Mich.App. 163, 165, 250 N.W.2d 804, 805 (1977), another 
case where the court decided that its disenchantment with a due-on-sale clause was so great that it would be invalidated, 
although with a reluctant acknowledgment that ""the due-on-sale clause in question does not fit within the definition of a restraint 
on alienation found in the Restatement of the Law of Property."""
316,30," .  Such is the inescapable effect of Va.Ann.Code § 6.1-330.33 and 330.34, supra, note 7. "
317,31," .  Even if the only penalty expressed for such a default is the creation of a right to accelerate and to compel repayment in full of 
the deed of trust note, the imposition in the contemplation of the law is unreasonable. A person should not be placed in a 
position in which he or she must violate an agreement, must dishonor his promise, to achieve a result."
317,32," .  Usually the acceleration is considered a ""call"" if initiated by the lender, and ""prepayment"" if brought about by the borrower."
317,33," .  Other prohibition of sale without consent of the lender cases include: Sanders v. Hicks, 317 So.2d 61, 62-63 (Miss.1975) 
(""The within property shall not be sold or encumbered without the express written consent of the within mortgagees, or their 
assigns.""); First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Englewood v. Lockwood, 385 So.2d 156, 157 (Fla.App.1980) (""No 
conveyance of said property, or any part thereof, shall be made by Mortgagor without the written consent of Mortgagee.""). Cf.  
First Southern Federal Savings and Loan Association v. Britton, 345 So.2d 300, 301 (Ala.Civ., App.1977) (""The particular clause 
… is as follows: ""… The Mortgagor shall not sell or transfer title … without the written approval of the Mortgagee, and any 
violation … shall constitute a default … and, at the option of the Mortgagee, all amounts secured by this mortgage shall become 
due and payable.' ""); Clark v. Lachenmeier, 237 So.2d 583, 584 (Fla.App.1970) (""It is hereby agreed that in the event of transfer 
of ownership … the Mortgagee has the right and privilege of accepting or rejecting … such successor in ownership.""); Terry v. 
Born, 24 Wash.App. 652, 653, 604 P.2d 504, 505 (1979) (""The contract … was ""not assignable nor (could) the buyer convey the 
property without the seller's written consent.' ""). But see Baker v. Loves Park Savings and Loan Association, 61 Ill.2d 119, 121, 
333 N.E.2d 1, 2 (1975) (Although the mortgage flatly prohibited a sale, assignment or transfer of any right, title or interest without "
318,," the prior written consent of the mortgagee, the prohibition was, nevertheless, upheld as a reasonable restraint on alienation, 
justifying an increase in the interest rate, a sanction for default provided in the mortgage in addition to the right to call the loan.)"
318,34," .  Such an attitude no doubt underlies a tendency to deny the advantages of a due-on-sale clause to a lender, on the grounds 
that the prospect of an acceleration upon sale was disguised, or at least not clearly revealed to the borrower. First Southern 
Federal Savings & Loan Association of Mobile v. Britton, 345 So.2d 300, 303-04 (Ala.Civ.App.1977) (""We do not say that the 
mortgagee may not specifically contract for the option to accelerate in the event of sale unless the purchaser agrees to payment 
of increased interest up to the current rate at time of assumption of the unpaid mortgage balance. We do hold that such purpose 
may not be hidden behind a clause which is assumed to only provide protection for the security. If the clause is to be used to 
advance the financial interest of the lender … an increase in the interest rate, such purpose must be openly stated and 
bargained for…. If the condition … may be hidden …, the mortgagor will be at the mercy of the mortgagee."") That decision of the 
Court of Civil Appeals of Alabama was held by the Alabama Supreme Court to be in error. Tierce v. APS Co., 382 So.2d 485, 
487 (Ala.1979). Cf. ""Enforcement,"" supra, at 927. In Virginia, however, any judicial concern on that score is stilled by Va.Ann.Code § 6.1-330.34. Cf. ""Enforcement,"" supra, at 
932: To the extent that the lack of statement of this underlying purpose of the due-on clause is interposed to bar enforcement for the 
purpose of increasing interest rate, the now widely used FNMA/FHLMC Uniform Mortgage Instrument attempts to provide a clear 
statement of this purpose."
318,35," .  What goes up must, of course, ultimately come down. At some time, interest rates may fall. Within the living memory of man, 
mortgage interest rates have been as low as 5%, and just possibly may, in time, return to such a level. In such circumstances, 
the homeowner would want acceleration of the loan in case he should sell. With rates declining, say, to 5% as against the 8.5% 
called for in the Pote deed of trust note of March 15, 1976, no punishment to the lender would result from invalidation of the due-
on-sale clause, because there existed a requirement of consent from the lender before any sale could properly be made. 
Generally (absent an unusual risk to the stability of the security) the lender would be happy to have the deed of trust assumed by 
a purchaser, with no acceleration, in view of the favorable interest rate. Thus, where interest rates have fallen, it would be the 
prohibition on sale without consent itself which the homeowner would be interested in seeing invalidated. If acceleration upon sale were not permitted to the homeowner in an atmosphere of declining interest rates (or if he could 
accelerate only upon the payment of a substantial premium or penalty), the homeowner would be placed in a situation where he 
could not sell on as favorable terms as would be the case if he were an owner of his premises free and clear of the lien or 
encumbrance of a deed of trust. As already observed, that disadvantage manifestly is a restraint on alienation. See Iron Castle 
Associates v. Wood, supra; Best, supra."
318,36," .  Related to the results where there is something amiss, are similar results achieved by narrowly limited interpretation where 
the deed of trust contains language indicating an understanding of the parties that the due-on-sale clause was intended only as 
a protection of the lender's security interest. Sometimes the security instrument may remark that a purpose of the due-on-sale 
clause is to protect the lender's security. Applying expressio unius est exclusio alterius, courts have foreclosed resort to the due-
on-sale clause absent a showing by the lender that the security would be impaired (not usually an easy burden since the selling "
319,," homeowner remains obliged to pay the note, with the purchaser of the home, who assumes the debt, an additional obligor). See 
Best, supra, where a clause providing for acceleration in case of an unapproved sale was described as included in the deed of 
trust ""in order more fully to protect the security of the Deed of Trust."" Cf.  First Federal Savings and Loan Association of 
Englewood v. Lockwood, supra, 385 So.2d at 159: "" ""It is the intent of this mortgage to secure payment of said note…' Thus, the 
sole purpose set out by First Federal deals with the protection of its security."" Other courts have taken the further questionable step of asserting that any purpose underlying the insistence by a lender on a 
due-on-sale clause save protection of the security (and in particular a purpose to protect against the adverse consequences of 
rising interest rates) is not permitted by law.  Wellenkamp v. Bank of America, supra, 21 Cal.3d at 953, 148 Cal.Rptr. at 385-86, 
582 P.2d at 976-77: ""For the foregoing reasons, we hold that a due-on-sale clause contained in a promissory note or deed of 
trust cannot be enforced upon the occurrence of an outright sale unless the lender can demonstrate that enforcement is 
reasonably necessary to protect against impairment to its security or the risk of default."" See also Patton v. First Federal Savings 
and Loan Association of Phoenix, 118 Ariz. 473, 478-79, 578 P.2d 152, 157-58 (1978) (""… we … hold that the ""due on sale' 
clause cannot be enforced unless First Federal can show that its security is jeopardized by the transfer of the subject 
property….""); Bellingham First Federal Savings & Loan Association v. Garrison, supra, 87 Wash.2d at 441, 553 P.2d at 1092; 
Annotation, Validity, Construction, and Application of Clause Entitling Mortgagee to Acceleration of Balance Due in Case of 
Conveyance or Transfer of Mortgaged Property, 69 A.L.R.3d 713, 749-50 (1976). No Virginia case has so held, and such a decision would be difficult to sustain in light of Article I, Section 1 of the Virginia 
Constitution (the Bill of Rights); cf.  Young v. Commonwealth, 101 Va. 853, 45 S.E. 327 (1903). Nor has any Virginia case reasoned that, unless the document expressly spells out a particular reason for the inclusion of the 
due-on-sale clause (i. e., here, the right to minimize the adverse consequences of rises in interest rates), it is to be deemed that 
no such purpose for the clause was intended by the parties. (For example, contrast an intermediate appellate court in New York 
which has held that the failure to state in the mortgage, as the purpose of the due-on-sale clause, the wish to raise the interest 
rate, to protect against market fluctuation, precludes exercise of a due-on-sale clause when that indeed is the only purpose.  
Silver v. Rochester Savings Bank, 73 App.Div.2d 81, 424 N.Y.S.2d 945 (1980) (mortgage provided mortgagee would not 
unreasonably withhold consent to a sale.)) Under the FNMA/FHLMC uniform deed of trust, that ""interpretation"" would be too 
forced. The Potes' deed of trust permits the due-on-sale clause to operate ""if all or any part of the Property or an interest therein 
is sold or transferred …"" except for four specific cases, none of which is applicable here: (i) subordinate lien or encumbrance, (ii) 
security for household appliances, (iii) succession by one life tenant on the death of another, and (iv) leasehold interest of less 
than three years. The interest rate fluctuation is evidently a, indeed the, principal underlying characteristic of home lending 
activities which leads lenders to insist on due-on-sale clauses. ""Enforcement,"" supra, at 896-97 (""… whatever the traditional 
purpose of a due-on clause, its modern purpose has been to relieve the lender of low-interest rate loans in its portfolio.""). It 
cannot reasonably be held not to have been contemplated as a reason for the clause."
319,37," .  Such is the precise holding of the only Virginia authority which appears to be squarely on point. Lipps v. First American 
Savings & Loan Association, in the Circuit Court of Prince William County, Chancery No. 13246, decree dated March 19, 1980, 
appeal pending to the Supreme Court of Virginia. The court had before it a transaction which used the June 1975 FNMA-FHLMC 
Virginia Uniform Instrument. It held that a sale brought into operation the due-on-sale clause, conferring on the savings and loan 
association the right to accelerate. It further held that the due-on-sale clause was legal and enforceable and in accordance with 
the statutes of Virginia. It is only the case's lack of finality because of the pending appeal which prevents us from giving preclusive effect in this matter of 
state law. However, for the reasons we have advanced, the case appears to have been rightly decided. Cf.  Fidelity Union Trust 
Co. v. Field, 311 U.S. 169, 61 S. Ct. 176, 85 L. Ed. 109 (1940); West v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 311 U.S. 223, 237, 61 S. Ct. 
179, 183, 85 L. Ed. 139 (1940); Six Companies of California v. Joint Highway Dist. No. 13, 311 U.S. 180, 188, 61 S. Ct. 186,

320,38," .  The FHLBB regulation, 12 C.F.R. § 545.8-3(g)(2), explicitly forbids ""a prepayment charge or equivalent fee for acceleration of 
the loan by exercise of a due-on-sale clause."" Va.Ann.Code § 6.1-330.33 declares that ""no lender shall collect or receive any prepayment penalty on loans secured by real 
property … if said prepayment results from the enforcement of the right to call the loan upon the sale of the real property which 
secures said loan."""
320,39," .  See Nichols v. Ann Arbor Federal Savings & Loan Association, 73 Mich.App. 163, 250 N.W.2d 804 (1977). That case 
invalidated a due-on-sale clause, but in taking that action was careful to distinguish a North Carolina case, Crockett v. First 
Federal Savings and Loan Association of Charlotte, 289 N.C. 620, 224 S.E.2d 580 (1976), on the very grounds that ""a 
mortgagor's ability to prepay without penalty and take advantage of declining interest rates supported a like ability on the part of 
the mortgagee to take advantage of interest rates in his favor."" The note in Nichols imposed a penalty for prepayment. In upholding a due-on-sale clause in Crockett, the North Carolina court read the financing documents as creating a right in the 
lender to accelerate at its option, in the event of a sale, but further creating a right in the borrower ""to prepay whenever he chose 
and take advantage of lower interest rates in the market."" Crockett, supra, 289 N.C. at 626, 224 S.E.2d at 585. To the same effect is Century Federal Savings and Loan Association of Bridgeton v. Van Glahn, 144 N.J.Super. 48, 54, 364 
A.2d 558, 562 (1976) (""This mortgage may be prepaid. Thus if, in this case, the interest rate had fallen, the borrower would have 
been privileged to refinance his debt elsewhere at the lower rate and pay off the loan. The borrower may repay the entire debt 
without penalty three years after the date of the mortgage, although slight penalties prior to that date are assessed."")."
320,40," .  The maximum penalty for prepayment of the $ 44,000 Pote loan was, consequently, $ 352.00 (1% of $ 35,200, i. e. $ 44,000 
less 20% or $ 8800). No evidence was adduced by appellants to suggest that the penalty was excessive, given the need for the 
lender to incur the expense of investigations and decisions preparatory to relending the prepayment. We cannot say simply from 
the figure of $ 352 itself, that it is excessive or otherwise unjust."
320,41," .  A 1979 amendment, renumbered § 6.1-330.27.1 made no changes of significance for the purposes with which we are 
concerned."
320,42," .  By reason of § 6.1-330.29, the effective penalty rate might have been 2% of any prepayment. See the Addendum to Note and 
Deed of Trust between Mrs. Bailey and First Federal Savings and Loan Association, providing for 2% in the first 3 years and 1% 
in the fourth and fifth year. "
321,43," .  Cf.  12 C.F.R. § 545.8.5(b): The prepayment penalty for a loan secured by a home occupied or to be occupied in whole or in part by a borrower shall not be 
more than 6 months' advance interest on that part of the aggregate amount of all prepayments made on such loan in any 12 
month period which exceeds 20% of the original principal amount of the loan. Under that federally adopted language, a prepayment penalty might range as high, in the case of the Potes, as $ 1496 (4 1/4 of 
$ 35,200)."
321,44," .  For cases from jurisdictions other than Virginia, not otherwise referred to in this opinion, upholding the validity of due-on-sale

Federal Savings and Loan Association v. Fetter, 564 P.2d 1013, 1019 (Okl.1977) (""No allegation was made … to show the 
mortgagee's security as impaired…. We, therefore, find that it was unreasonable and inequitable for appellant to impose a one 
per cent transfer fee as a condition precedent to giving its consent to transfer the mortgage because neither the note nor the 
mortgage contained such a provision; …"")."
321,45," .  Va.Ann.Code § 59.1-9.5 makes unlawful ""(e)very contract, combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce…."" "

State, or (2) by an administrative or constitutionally established agency of this State or of the United States having jurisdiction of 
the subject matter and having authority to consider the anticompetitive effect, if any, of such conduct. Nothing in this paragraph 
shall be construed to alter or terminate any other applicable limitation, exemption or exclusion."
322,47," .  The purpose of the due-on-sale clause evidently was to deter a practice which would diminish profits or cause losses to 
federal savings and loan institutions. If the result for which the appellants contend could be achieved, the development would, in 
the course of time, inexorably lead to an increase in interest rates over and beyond and independent of increases attributable to 
other factors. Essentially all future purchasers of homes in the end would suffer, just to permit a relative few who, despite sale, 
could hang on to the economic benefits of a mortgage or deed of trust with a favorable interest rate to benefit. Prevention of that 
is a public purpose which evidently outweighs the allowance of the windfall sought by the appellants in the transactions here 
under scrutiny. As Justice Davis dissenting in Wellenkamp v. Bank of America, supra, 21 Cal.3d at 954, 148 Cal.Rptr. at 386, 
582 P.2d at 977 so cogently put it: But our beneficence may be shortsighted. For in attempting to assist the Wellenkamps, the majority opinion must necessarily 
restrict if not dry up mortgage funds otherwise available to the next generation of borrowers."
322,48," .  One can only wonder where it leaves the jurisprudence of California with its state court decision, Wellenkamp v. Bank of 
America, 21 Cal.3d 943, 148 Cal.Rptr. 379, 582 P.2d 970 (1978), decided August 25, 1978, essentially voiding due-on-sale 
clauses for state lending institutions speedily followed, on November 1, 1978, by Glendale Federal Savings and Loan 
Association v. Fox, 459 F. Supp. 903 (C.D.Cal.1978), which held valid due-on-sale clauses in lending documents of federal 
associations. The state can hardly relish the competitive disadvantage inexorably following for state lending associations. "
326,*," Of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation. "
327,1," The Bell System consists of AT&T, Western Electric, Bell Laboratories, and the twenty-three affiliated operating companies that 
provide local telephone service."
327,2, SNET is one of two local affiliates in which AT&T possesses a minority interest.
327,3," SNET, which is specially chartered by the Connecticut General Assembly and is under the regulatory supervision of the 
Connecticut Division of Public Utilities Control (DPUC), does not sell or lease equipment to its customers; it provides services 
pursuant to tariffs. For convenience, however, we will refer to SNET's service offerings as ""products."""
327,4, These numerical designations refer to the number of telephone lines each type of PBX could accommodate. 
328,5," As a consequence of this design feature, a Northeastern customer, unlike one using SNET equipment, would lose outside 
telephone service in the event of a power failure."
328,6, The parties have stipulated that this is the relevant product and geographic market for the purposes of this litigation. 
329,7," Appellants also maintain that the remaining areas of conduct challenged by Northeastern--pricing, advertising, marketing, the 
introduction of new products, and the use of SNET's utility function--are insulated from antitrust scrutiny by the ""state action"" 
doctrine first enunciated in Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 63 S. Ct. 307, 87 L. Ed. 315 (1943). While there is considerable force 
to the contentions of Northeastern and of the Government as amicus curiae that such immunity is unavailable, see Cantor v. 
Detroit Edison Co., 428 U.S. 579, 96 S. Ct. 3110, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1141 (1976); Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 95 S. 
Ct. 2004, 44 L. Ed. 2d 572 (1975); Litton Systems, Inc. v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 487 F. Supp. 942, 958-59 
(S.D.N.Y. 1980), we need not reach this issue in view of our holding that on the facts of this case, none of the charged activities 
gives rise to antitrust liability. See Part III. B. infra. "
330,8," At that time, the Federal Communications Act empowered the FCC to suspend a proposed tariff for only ninety days. See 47 
U.S.C. § 204, as amended, Pub. L. No. 94-376, § 2, 90 Stat. 1080 (1976). The maximum period of suspension has since been 
increased to five months. See id. "
331,9," The potential for conflict between the regulatory and antitrust provisions is further reduced because Northeastern seeks 
damages only for appellants' past activities. Had it requested an injunction prohibiting appellants from engaging in conduct 
expressly approved by the FCC, a different question might be presented. "
332,10," The jury was not asked to consider these issues separately. Judge Eginton, in ruling on appellants' motion for judgment 
notwithstanding, the verdict, concluded there was insufficient evidence that the key telephone rates were below ""cost."" The court 
nevertheless refused to set aside the verdict, professing certainty that the jury did not base its finding of liability on that evidence. "
333,," In view of our disposition of the other two pricing claims, we need not decide whether this conclusion was erroneous. Moreover, 
because Northeastern did not cross-appeal from the judgment below, the issue of the lawfulness of those rates is not before us."
333,11," Predation may also refer to a monopolist's practice of ""selling at a loss"" to discipline smaller rivals for undercutting the 
monopoly price. See 3 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law P 711a, at 151 n.5 (1978). As in the first case, the predator 
expects to recoup his losses once the disciplinary period is over. Northeastern has not accused appellants of this type of predatory conduct, acknowledging, presumably, that because they are 
subject to regulation, they lack the pricing flexibility necessary to respond quickly to the price reductions of rebellious firms."
333,12," Whether a particular expense, e.g., the cost of a new factory, should be classified as variable or fixed depends in part on the 
time period under consideration. Over the short run, such an expense would be independent of output and hence fixed. In the 
long run, it would be classified as variable. Indeed, all costs are variable in the long run. See 3 P. Areeda & D. Turner, supra, P 
712, at 155-56."
333,13," The relationships among marginal cost, average cost, and average variable cost are depicted graphically in Areeda & Turner, 
Predatory Pricing and Related Practices Under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 88 Harv. L. Rev. 697, 701 n.14 (1975). "
334,14," It may seem incongruous that a more efficient firm may lose money at the monopolist's lawful price, see In re International 
Business Machines Corp. Peripheral Electronic Data Processing Devices Antitrust Litigation, 481 F. Supp. 965, 991-95 (N.D. 
Cal. 1979) (dictum); Comment, Draining the Alcoa ""Wishing Well"": The Section 2 Conduct Requirement after Kodak and 
Calcomp, 48 Ford. L. Rev. 291, 317-20 (1979). But these losses are unlikely to have any serious anticompetitive effects. If the 
monopolists' marginal-cost price is below its average cost, not only will it be incurring greater losses per unit of output than the 
more efficient firm, but it will suffer those losses over a much greater range of output, since it will be making the vast majority of 
sales in the market. That the monopolist will suffer more than its rival will tend to negate whatever competitive benefits the 
monopolist may derive from its presumably superior wealth. Moreover, since the monopolist will have to raise his price 
eventually, the rival has a strong incentive to stay in the market, because its profits will exceed those of the monopolist at the 
new, higher price. See generally McGee, Predatory Pricing Revisited, 23 J. Law & Econ. 289, 295-97 (1980). Finally, the 
average cost rule that some commentators would apply in this situation has serious flaws of its own. See note 19 infra."
334,15," Areeda & Turner's concern over maximizing short term as opposed to long term welfare has provoked considerable criticism. 
See, e.g., Scherer, Predatory Pricing and the Sherman Act: A Comment, 89 Harv. L. Rev. 869 (1976); Scherer, Some Last 
Words on Predatory Pricing, id. at 901; Williamson, Predatory Pricing: A Strategic and Welfare Analysis, 87 Yale L.J. 284 (1977). 
Maximizing consumers' welfare over the long run is the theoretically preferable solution, as Areeda and Turner concede. See 
Areeda & Turner, Scherer on Predatory Pricing: A Reply, 89 Harv. L. Rev. 891, 896-97 (1976). But we despair that economists 
will ever formulate workable criteria for reaching this goal. Certainly Scherer's approach cannot be applied in a judicial setting. 
See Janich Brothers, Inc. v. American Distilling Co., 570 F.2d 848, 857 n.9 (9th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 829, 99 S. Ct. 
103, 58 L. Ed. 2d 122 (1978); McGee, supra, at 306-07. Furthermore, this case does not present us with a stark choice between long run and short run welfare maximization, since 
SNET did not set its prices solely with respect to short term marginal costs. Instead it took such ""long term"" items as the return 
on investment into consideration in formulating its PBX tariffs. See note 19 infra. "
335,16," Areeda and Turner would create an exception to the prohibition of below marginal cost pricing when a firm's prices exceed its 
average costs, a situation that can only arise when the firm is operating at output levels above capacity. This exception has been 
strongly criticized. See Scherer, Predatory Pricing and the Sherman Act: A Comment, 89 Harv. L. Rev. 869, 871-75 (1976). 
Fortunately, we need not resolve this highly technical issue, since Northeastern does not allege that SNET's marginal costs were 
above its average costs; it alleges the reverse."
335,17," See V. Brudney & M. Chirelstein, Corporate Finance (1972)."
335,18," As mentioned previously, Northeastern was formed by two Connecticut businessmen in 1972 on a total capital investment of $ 
1,000."
335,19," Moreover, the more demanding average cost test of predatory pricing gives rise to serious problems when applied to a 
diversified enterprise. This is because the accounting conventions used to allocate joint costs, i.e., those costs that are not 
directly attributable to a particular product, are all arbitrary to a degree. See 3 P. Areeda & D. Turner, supra, P 719, at 183. Even 
Northeastern's expert witness, who testified that appellants should have allocated a portion of their joint expenditures to the cost 
of their PBXs, did not explain how those costs should be apportioned. Since businessmen are entitled to notice that their pricing decisions may subject them to antitrust liability, they should be allowed 
to adopt any reasonable and consistent method for allocating joint expenditures. See In re IBM Peripheral EDP Devices Antitrust 
Litigation, supra, 481 F. Supp. at 998-99. SNET's method, which it termed Long Range Incremental Analysis (LRIA), was to "
336,," calculate all of the costs directly attributable to a particular product, including such items as operating expenses, capital costs, 
start-up charges, inflation factors, and ""elastic costs"" (i.e., the losses in revenue occasioned when a SNET customer switched 
from using older SNET equipment to a new SNET product). SNET would then estimate the net revenues to be expected from 
pricing the new product at each of four or more price levels, and select the price that maximized net revenues. In essence, Long 
Range Incremental Analysis let the market allocate SNET's joint costs. While this method is not beyond challenge, see p. 24 
infra, we believe it was a reasonable procedure for apportioning common expenditures."
336,20," Judge Eginton defined fully distributed cost as the ""marginal or incremental cost of supplying a particular good or service [plus] 
some portion of the unattributable costs (i.e., indirect costs.)."""
336,21, See note 19 supra.
336,22," If an unregulated, diversified monopolist were to try this tactic, its high price on the product bearing all of the firm's joint costs 
would come under heavy competitive attack. To remain competitive, the monopolist would have to lower that product's price, 
thereby reallocating common expenditures. "
337,23," Wilson's analysis of SNET's first year ""tracking report"" does not cure this lack of evidence. During the first year that the 
Dimension PBXs were on the market, SNET compiled data on the costs and revenues associated with those products. That 
study, which covered the period from March 1, 1977, to February 28, 1978, showed that while Dimension's revenues were 
greater than expected, so were its costs, resulting in a $ 2,000 shortfall where a $ 25,700 surplus had been forecast. But the 
existence of this loss does not demonstrate that SNET's tariffs did not exceed its reasonably anticipated average variable costs. 
Two factors support this conclusion. The first involves the size of the loss itself. Even monopolists cannot be held to a standard 
of perfection. We have stated that SNET was entitled to price its PBXs at a level equal to its short run average variable costs. A 
loss of $ 2,000 on total revenues of more than $ 232,000 cannot subject SNET to antitrust liability under this standard. Moreover, 
both the tracking study and SNET's Long Range Incremental Analyses, see note 19 supra, include certain items of long term 
expense that are generally excluded from a calculation of short run average variable costs. See generally 3 P. Areeda & D. 
Turner, supra, P 715c, at 173. For example, SNET included the rate of return on investment in estimating the costs of its 
Dimension PBX program. If this component were eliminated, the tracking study would have shown a profit instead of a deficit for 
the first year of the program's operation."
337,24," Of course, SNET would still be entitled to prove that its below-cost prices has an acceptable business justification. See 
Hanson v. Shell Oil Co., 541 F.2d 1352, 1359 n.6 (9th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1074, 97 S. Ct. 813, 50 L. Ed. 2d 792 
(1977). One affirmative defense would be that its prices, while below marginal cost, were loss minimizing. Such prices are 
inconsistent with the intent to forego short term revenues--a necessary element of the offense of predatory pricing. See 3 P. 
Areeda & D. Turner, supra, P 711b, at 151. "
338,25," Of course, if the customer knows SNET will not give him fair value for the equipment he has been using, he will be less 
inclined to trade it in. But in the absence of evidence that SNET regulatory undervalued its customers' used terminal equipment, 
we must assume that this practice did not occur. "
339,26," For example, introduction of a new product may violate § 2 if a monopolist acts to compel customer choice by withdrawing a 
substitute product from the market. See Berkey, supra, 603 F.2d at 287 & n.39."
339,27," Although Northeastern also contended that its customers experienced problems concerning the supply and service of the 
protective couplers, those issues were not submitted to the jury, and we need not consider this evidence. "
340,28," Northeastern argues strenuously that it ""should be given the full benefit of [its] proof without tightly compartmentalizing the 
various factual components and wiping the slate clean after scrutiny of each."" Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon 
Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 699, 82 S. Ct. 1404, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1962). Although the logical presentation of our holding has required 
us to treat each of Northeastern's claims of anticompetitive conduct separately, we have not ignored Continental Ore's edict. We 
have found, however, that in numerous critical respects Northeastern's proof was utterly lacking. Under such circumstances, 
treating Northeastern's claims collectively cannot have any synergistic effect. See California Computer Products, Inc. v. 
International Business Machines Corp., 613 F.2d 727 (9th Cir. 1979). "
341,29," In other circumstances, we might be reluctant to allow a jury to second-guess engineers' decisions as to the proper 
construction of a sophisticated piece of equipment. But in this case we cannot look to the reaction of the competitive market to 
determine whether one design is superior to another, compare Berkey, supra, 603 F.2d at 287. As noted previously, ATT's post-
Carterfone tariffs gave it the exclusive right to provide protective couplers. Market forces cannot operate under such 
circumstances. Thus, we see no alternative to entrusting the matter of coupler design to the judgment of the jury."
341,30," To forestall a controversy that will doubtlessly recur should a second damage trial become necessary, we will consider 
appellants' contention that Northeastern cannot recover both lost profits and damages to its going concern value. We recognize 
that these two types of recovery may be awarded in the same case, albeit not for the same time period. See Story Parchment 
Co. v. Paterson Parchment Paper Co., 282 U.S. 555, 51 S. Ct. 248, 75 L. Ed. 544 (1931); Atlantic City Electrical Co. v. General 
Electric Co., 226 F. Supp. 59, 61 (S.D.N.Y.), application for an interlocutory appeal denied, 337 F.2d 844 (2d Cir. 1964) (per 
curiam). For example, recovery on both grounds will often be appropriate when an antitrust plaintiff can prove that he first lost 
business and was then driven from the market by the defendant's anticompetitive practices. See, e.g., Heatransfer Corp. v. 
Volkswagenwerk, A.G., 553 F.2d 964, 987 n.20 (5th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1087, 98 S. Ct. 1282, 55 L. Ed. 2d 792 
(1978). But Northeastern has not shown that its future profitability will be diminished by the design of appellants' protective 
coupler. Indeed, to do so would be impossible, since the jury's implicit finding that the couplers were unreasonably designed 
involved the ephemeral and now-invalidated post-Carterfone tariffs. Furthermore, we are told that the couplers still in use have 
been modified to accommodate two-wire interconnection. Under these changed circumstances, Northeastern cannot recover on 
the theory that it suffered a loss to its value as a going concern. Cf.  Volasco Products Co. v. Lloyd A. Fry Roofing Co., 308 F.2d 
383, 393 (6th Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 372 U.S. 907, 83 S. Ct. 721, 9 L. Ed. 2d 717 (1963). "

379,1," Defendants' basic claims are for breach of contract.  There can be no doubt as to the cognizability of such claims under Ohio 
law.  Beyond these claims, defendants also seek to require Chest Hill to develop the Chestnut Station property in a manner 
consistent with the alleged agreement between Guttman and Kaiser-Aetna.  Although such claims are not favored under Ohio 
law, they are not prohibited either.  See 10 O. Jur. 3d, Buildings, Zoning and Land Contracts, § 57; 17 Jur. 3d, Contracts, § 116; 
Berger v. Van Sweringen Co ., 6 Ohio St. 2d 100, 216 N.E. 2d 54 (1966)."
379,2," HN20[
] Ohio Revised Code §§ 5301.252 and 5309.72 permit the recording, respectively, of affidavits stating facts relating to conditions setting forth adverse claims against Ohio real estate.Ohio Revised Code § 5309.58, in turn, provides that no action or 
proceeding, in any court, affecting real estate is lis pendens or notice to any person dealing with such real estate unless a "
380,," certificate of the pendency of the action or proceeding is filed with the county recorder and memorialized by him on the certificate 
of title to the affected real estate. "
382,3," According to Mr. Fernand Grauz, the owner of several Chestnut Station condominiums, defendant Guttman offered to withdraw 
all notices of lis pendens against his property for $ 60,000.00.  (See doc. 20.) Assuming what Mr. Gruaz says is true, Guttman's 
offer is not an act beyond those incident to use of the courts for which antitrust liability can attach, for it is not an offer directed at 
achieving the alleged anticompetitive purpose, i.e., eliminating competition from neighboring apartments and condominiums. To 
the contrary, Guttman's offer, if accepted, would concede the competition.  The offer, if in fact it was made (and we assume it 
was for purposes of this motion), is thus unlike the anticompetitive offer made by the defendant in Otter Tail. "
387,1," Preliminarily, we note that the present appeal does not run counter to the one final judgment rule since the two-cause action 
involves multiple parties and the judgment now before us disposes of the only cause alleged against all the named defendants 
except the Sacramento Board of Realtors. ( Justus v. Atchison (1977) 19 Cal.3d 564, 568 [139 Cal.Rptr. 97, 565 P.2d 122]; see 
also 6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Appeal, §§ 36, 48, pp. 4050-4051, 4062-4064.) The interests of justice are better 
served by affording prompt appellate review of the issues definitively adjudicated as to these defendants than by requiring 
postponement of the appeal until the final outcome of the remaining trial proceedings.  ( Justus, supra, at p. 568.) Moreover, 
section 437c Code of Civil Procedure was amended in 1973 to provide ""Except where a separate judgment may properly be "
388,," awarded in the action, no final judgment shall be entered on a motion for summary judgment prior to the termination of such 
action . . . ."" We deem this to be a proper situation for a separate judgment."
388,2," This is a distillation from the eight-count original complaint purporting to be a class action as to both plaintiffs and defendants 
and the six-count first amended complaint also purporting to be a class action.  Demurrers by SBOR and United Multiple Listing 
Service, Inc. were sustained with leave to amend as to the first amended complaint; SBOR's motion for summary judgment in 
the two ""Feldman"" causes of action was denied."

390,8," Nor may plaintiff on remand rely on the same dicta and by different construction (i.e., ""per capita cost of services received by 
plaintiff"") interpret the fees in question to be per se an unreasonable restraint of trade."
390,9," Defendants suggest in passing that the Hounsell decision (72 Cal.App.3d 210) interpreting Palsson (16 Cal.3d 920) was in 
error and the proper interpretation is that a board of realtors which offers board membership to brokers and salesmen on "
391,," nondiscriminatory terms has no duty to provide MLS access to a person who is not a member of its board.  They admit however 
that such issue was not raised below and is not before us on this appeal."

""affects commerce."" Id. n. 48, citing J. P. Mascaro & Sons, Inc. v. William J. O'Hara, Inc., 565 F.2d 264 (3d Cir. 1977)."

this point unknown because defendants have objected to answering plaintiff's interrogatories until the jurisdictional issue is

require(s) the purchase of virtually all replacement parts from MBNA."" Complaint P 14(a)."
403,3," .  Although defendant relies in part on Principe v. McDonald's Corp., 631 F.2d 303 (4th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 970, 
101 S. Ct. 2047, 68 L. Ed. 2d 349 (1981), that case deals primarily with the question of whether certain required business 
arrangements, including the lease of a company-owned store, were separate products from a McDonald's franchise, NOT 
whether a per se standard was appropriate.  Thus this case is discussed infra in the ""separate products' section. "
404,4," .  The court accepts that every trademarked automobile dealer is the franchised outlet for the automobile and replacement parts 
of their respective trademark franchisor. See In re General Motors Corp., FTC Docket No. 9077 (1979) (Defendant's Exh. 3).  
However it does not necessarily follow that because an automobile manufacturer cannot be required to sell its parts to a non-
franchised outlet that a franchised outlet can be prohibited from selling non-franchised parts."
404,5," .  HN2[
] The standard for finding a § 3 Clayton Act violation is substantially the same as that for a § 1 Sherman Act claim. See Moore v. Jas. H. Matthews & Co., 550 F.2d 1207, 1214 (9th Cir. 1977). "
405,6," .  As each new dealer signed an original sales agreement, he was presented with an LMDA (advertising fund) agreement.  Only 
four Lincoln-Mercury dealers in the United States have not been members of some LMDA since 1950.  The testimony showed 
that Ford representatives made it unmistakably clear that a dealer's franchise would be terminated if he resigned from LMDA. Miller Motors, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 252 F.2d 441, 445 (4th Cir. 1958)."
405,7," .  Additionally, the opportunity is reduced for non-Mercedes-Benz parts distributors to compete with defendant for Mercedes-
Benz dealer accounts."
405,8," .  On the other hand, restricting the sources of dealer replacement parts may serve to increase the competitive potential of the 
Mercedes-Benz automobile by contributing to its desirability as a high quality product.  Such a finding, if one is to be made, must 
be based on a demonstrated connection between the parts restriction and the maintenance of otherwise unobtainable quality 
(discussed as a possible business justification, infra). "
406,9," .  The court notes the use of a rule of reason standard for an alleged tying arrangement in State of New Jersey v. Lawn King, 84 
N.J. 179, 417 A.2d 1025 (1980). In that criminal prosecution, defendant owned a lawncare franchise consisting of machinery and 
products for use in servicing lawns.  The dealership agreement required dealers to purchase supplies from defendant or from an 
approved source.  The agreement included a detailed procedure to be followed for seeking approval of outside suppliers.  In 
declining to apply a per se standard, the court relied on Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 97 S. Ct. 2549, 
53 L. Ed. 2d 568 (1977) and stressed the need to weigh and pro-competitive and anti-competitive aspects of defendant's 
practices.  The court emphasized that the franchisor's success was largely dependent on the quality of the franchisee's 
performance and that the business involved a novel commercial arrangement with which courts have had little experience.  Also 
noted was the potentially severe consequences of a criminal prosecution.  These factually distinguishable considerations 
undermine defendant's reliance on Lawn King.  While that decision may anticipate a new direction in tying law, this court is 
unwilling to say that the exceptions to established per se tying principles have now become the rule. At the same time, the court is not unconcerned with the potential for abuse, particularly on motion for summary judgment, with a 
mechanical application of a per se standard. Unquestioning extension of per se tying principles to diverse and complex market 
situations runs the risk of injecting legal short-hand into business practices not imbued with the anti-competitive characteristics 
the Sherman Act was designed to prevent. Courts seem to recognize this dilemma.  E. g. Kentucky Fried Chicken v. Diversified Packaging, 549 F.2d 368, 374-75 (5th Cir. 
1977). However, rather than espousing wholesale rejection of a per se standard to tying arrangements, courts often reconcile 
this standard with business reality by finding that two products are not tied, that they are not separate products, or that a 
business justification exists for a tying arrangement. The principles are honored as much in the breach as in the execution and 
as a result courts as well as industries are left without consistent guidance.  See generally Anderson Foreign Motors v. New 
England Toyota Distrib., Inc., 475 F. Supp. 973, 981 (1979); Baker, ""The Supreme Court and the Per Se Tying Rule: Cutting the 
Gordian Knot,"" 66 Va.L.Rev. 1235, 1310-19 (1980). "
407,10," .  In Moore v. Jas. H. Matthews & Co., supra, the court also inquired into whether the seller of the tying product had an 
economic interest in the tied product.  Id. at 1216. Defendant in the present case has a direct economic interest in the allegedly 
tied replacement parts and in many cases benefits from higher-than-average market price for the auto parts."
407,11," .  Initially, plaintiff complained that ""the granting of a Mercedes-Benz franchise is conditioned upon the purchase by dealers of 
replacement parts solely from MBNA."" (Complaint P 13.) In the present motion, plaintiff considers the Mercedes-Benz 
automobile to be the tying product and not the franchise. Considering defendant's own authorities discussed in section II supra, 
the Court accepts the position that the Mercedes-Benz trademark and the Mercedes automobile are a single product.  Thus the 
trademarked automobile may be considered the product tied to the sale of replacement parts. "
408,12," .  In a footnote the court distinguished the packaged sale before it from a requirement to purchase ""an automobile and its tires 
or a left shoe and the right."" Siegel v. Chicken Delight, Inc., 448 F.2d 43, 48 (9th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 955, 92 S. Ct. 
1172, 31 L. Ed. 2d 232 (1972). Such an analogy does not vindicate defendant's position here.  An automobile and its tires or the 
mechanical parts within it, are not in the same relationship as an automobile and its replacement parts.  A new car must have 
tires to be operational; replacement parts by definition are necessary only after a fully operational automobile has aged or 
deteriorated."
408,13," .  Other courts have considered (1) whether other members of the industry sell the products separately, (2) whether versions of 
the alleged single product differ in significant respects, (3) whether the customer is charged separately for the products, and (4) 
whether any components of the alleged single product are sold separately.  Anderson Foreign Motors, Inc. v. New Eng. Toyota 
Distrib., Inc., supra, at 982 (1979) delineating the factors considered in United States v. Jerrold Elecs. Corp., 187 F. Supp. 545 
(E.D.Pa.1960), aff'd per curiam, 365 U.S. 567, 81 S. Ct. 755, 5 L. Ed. 2d 806 (1961). "
409,14," .  It is the goal of every franchisor or seller of a trademarked product to distribute their products to the public.  Following 
defendant's reasoning, MBNA could require its dealers to sell any product it decided to manufacture, whether or not that product 
was related to its trademarked automobiles."
409,15," .  Defendant does interject itself minimally into the business operations of its franchise dealers. The ""Dealer Operations 
Requirements"" section of the Dealer Agreement addresses the issues of size of inventory and working capital, number of 
personnel, location of display signs, etc.  Apparently specifications in these areas are developed by mutual agreement between 
MBNA and each dealer."
409,16," .  While defendant states that the purpose of the dealer's existence is ""to distribute Mercedes-Benz products to the public,"" this 
characterization begs the question of whether the use of Mercedes-Benz products, other than those introduced in the new 
automobile itself, may be required in the Dealer Agreement. "
410,17," .  Although there is evidence that some dealers bought non-Mercedes-Benz parts, the Dealer Agreement has a clause stating 
that failure to enforce the terms of the Agreement will not be considered a waiver of any terms.  Therefore such evidence does 
little to diminish the coercive potential of the Agreement to the extent an express tie-in is demonstrated.  Further, the alleged tie-
in affects only parts mechanically necessary to the operation of the automobile.  Dealers may well purchase other replacement 
parts or accessories from non-Mercedes distributors without diminishing this coercive potential with regard to mechanically 
necessary parts. The court takes judicial notice of the ongoing settlement negotiations in Technical Learning Collective, Inc. v. Daimler-Benz AG, 
 -- - F. Supp.  -- , Civ. No. N-77-1443 (D.Md., preliminary approval of settlement agreement Apr. 9, 1981), a class-action against 
DBAG and MBNA for various antitrust violations.  The proposed Consent Decree includes a provision requiring MBNA to send a 
letter to each of its U. S. dealers advising them that each dealer is not contractually required to purchase parts solely from MBNA provided that the dealer does not represent to its customer, that 
parts purchased from sources other than MBNA were purchased from or approved by MBNA or DBAG or that either MBNA or 
DBAG assumes responsibility for the quality of such parts; such letter may also advise such dealer that MBNA and DBAG will 
not honor any warranty claim and will not assume responsibility or liability for claims arising from the use of parts not sold by 
them. Consent Decree, P VII, at 4.  A hearing to consider final approval of the Settlement Agreement is scheduled for June 19, 1981.  
While the sending of such a letter might defeat plaintiff's claim that the Dealer Agreement serves to tie purchase of replacement 
parts to the Mercedes automobile, see Photovest Corp. v. Fotomat Corp., 606 F.2d 704, 721-22 (7th Cir. 1979), that issue is not 
presently before the court and cannot be allowed to divert this court's inquiry into the existence of a tying arrangement and the 
fashioning of an appropriate remedy."
410,18," .  The following excerpt is taken from the deposition of Heinz Waizenegger, Executive Vice-President of MBNA from 1975-
1979: Q. What is your understanding of that phrase (""necessary to the mechanical operation of such MB passenger cars"")?  What 
does it mean to you? A. I told you before, Mr. Dick, we have 29,000 different parts.  It depends on the model, between 24 and 29,000 different parts in 
one car, and if one is missing there's no operation. Q. So all parts that MB supplies are necessary to the mechanical operation of the car? A. Yes, sure, or some comfort items, of course arm rest or something the car would operate without arm rests, so there's some 
difference, of course. Plaintiff's App. of Dep. Testimony, at 22. According to other defendant deposition answers, the only parts not considered mechanically necessary are such parts as 
chrome molding and accessories (i. e. floor mat, trailer hitch).  Some parts are considered necessary because a car would not 
operate properly without them (i. e. spark plugs) or are secondarily necessary for the proper operation of a larger part (i. e. oil "
411,," filter).  Plaintiff's App. of Dep. Testimony, at 94-95 (Horst W. Stoehr, Gen'l Manager Parts Division since 1975) and 329-30 
(Josef Saje, Manager of Parts-Technical). In In re General Motors Corp., 34 FTC 58 (1941), the FTC drew a distinction between parts mechanically necessary to the 
operation of an automobile and those considered accessories or standard equipment not mechanically necessary.  These latter 
parts included shock absorbers, safety glass, bumpers, and rear-view mirrors. In In re General Motors Corp., FTC Docket No. 9077 (1979) (alleged unfair trade practices in the distribution of new crash parts), 
the definition of crash parts includes bumpers, panels, doors and fenders.  The court accepts that such parts also cannot be 
considered mechanically necessary."
411,19," .  Arguably, if a dealer knew exactly which replacement parts were included in subpart 9C, he or she would be less fettered in 
turning to outside suppliers for unrestricted parts."
411,20," .  The following exchange took place during the deposition of Heinz Waizenegger, MBNA's Vice-President, indicating that 
MBNA interprets the approved source clause strictly: Q. Do you know if there's any way for a dealer to tell when a part has been expressly approved by DBAG or by MBNA? A. The parts bought from us are packaged in Mercedes-Benz boxes with the Mercedes-Benz star and the logo and so on.  This 
would be one way to say this is genuine Mercedes parts. Q. Are any parts that are supplied to dealers by independent distributors parts that are expressly approved by DBAG or by 
MBNA?A. They have their own ways to get such parts, yes.Q. Would you explain what those ways would be?A. I wouldn't know. Q. If a dealer purchases a part from an independent distributor as opposed to MBNA, is there any way he can tell whether that 
part has been expressly approved by DBAG or by MBNA?A. He should know that it has not been approved. Plaintiff's App. of Dep. Testimony, at 21-22. "
412,," Compare with Lawn King, supra, in which a dealer agreement contained an approved source clause as well as a detailed 
procedure for seeking approval for use of outside suppliers."
412,21," .  The evidence suggests moreover that DBAG approval refers only to certain parts distributed by MBNA that have not gone 
through DBAG testing procedures.  It does not appear that this ""approved source"" clause is meant to apply at all to dealers 
purchasing parts from sources other than MBNA.  Defendant makes reference to warranty procedures whereby dealers may 
deal directly with a limited number of parts manufacturers who independently warrant their own parts (e.g. Bosch).  But such 
contact is expressly limited to emergency situations and includes only those manufacturers whose parts DBAG has already 
approved for distribution by MBNA.  (Defendant's Exh. 56)."
412,22," .  Although this circuit has required a showing of ""some modicum of coercion"" as part of this second factor, Moore v. Jas. H. 
Matthews & Co., supra, at 1216, the court agrees with a substantial number of other courts having ruled on the issue that this 
element is properly presumed from a finding of sufficient economic power and the existence of separate products tied together.  
See, e.g., Bogosian v. Gulf Oil Corp., 561 F.2d 434, 449 (3d Cir. 1977) (individual proof of coercion not required if tying claim 
based on express provisions of a uniform contract); In re Data General Corp. Antitrust Litigation, 490 F. Supp. 1089, 1101 n.11 
(N.D.Cal.1980); Anderson Foreign Motors, Inc. v. New Eng. Toyota Distrib., Inc., supra, at 988-89. "
413,23," .  If plaintiff meant to demonstrate that a substantial number of Mercedes-Benz dealers signed the Dealer Agreement 
unwillingly, then defendant would be permitted to demonstrate the dealers' willing acceptance of the replacement part terms as 
rebuttal.  However plaintiff does not attempt to demonstrate economic power by such a showing."
413,24," .  These explanations in some respects overlap the business justifications asserted as a defense since the dealers' 
considerations may in some respects parallel those of the manufacturers. "
414,25," .   ""Whenever there are some buyers who find a seller's product uniquely attractive, and are therefore willing to pay a premium 
above the price of its nearest substitute, the seller has the opportunity to impose a tie to some other good."" Note, The Logic of 
Foreclosure: Tie-In Doctrine after Fortner v. U. S. Steel, 79 Yale L.J. 86, 93-94 (1969). United States Steel Corp. v. Fortner Enterprises, Inc., 429 U.S. 610, 621 n.14, 97 S. Ct. 861, 868 n.14, 51 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1977) 
(Fortner II )."
414,26," .  The outcome of the decision was later reversed but on grounds not relevant to the issue of economic power.  See Krehl v. 
Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream Co., 1979-2 Trade Cas. (CCH) P 62,806 (C.D.Cal.1973). "
415,27," .  Plaintiff has stated to the court that its Complaint does not extend to parts sold or used for warranty repairs (Defendant's Brief 
In Support Of Its Motion for Summary Judgment, at 13)."
415,28," .  Defendant submits the Initial Decision in In re General Motors Corp., FTC Docket No. 9077 (1979) to demonstrate that crash 
parts comprise a large share of a dealer's service and repair parts business.  While it may be true that GM crash part sales in 
1972 exceeded $ 250 million, that does not help the court determine the extent of MBNA's market for mechanically necessary 
replacement parts. "
416,29," .  The reasoning in Susser v. Carvel, Corp., 332 F.2d 505 (2d Cir. 1964), cert. dismissed, 381 U.S. 125, 85 S. Ct. 1364, 14 L. 
Ed. 2d 284 (1965), has been subject to question.  See, e.g., McCarthy, ""Trademark Franchising and Antitrust: The Trouble With 
Tie-Ins,"" 58 Calif.L.Rev. 1085 (1970)."
416,30," .  There is some evidence contrary to even this conclusion however.  In its own Reply Memorandum in support of its Motion for 
Summary Judgment, defendant cites the deposition testimony of a dealer that certain non-Mercedes-Benz parts did not comply 
with Mercedes' specifications. (Testimony of Mr. Laskeris, Deposition App. I, at 41-43, 49, 50 cited in Defendant's Reply Brief, at 
34). "
417,31," .  The following facts are taken from the Declaration of Horst W. Stoehr, General Manager of MBNA Parts Division since July 1, 
1975."
417,32," .  Certain replacement parts already do not receive the benefit of DBAG's second-level inspection. Twenty percent of MBNA 
purchased parts do not come from DBAG but are purchased directly from other auto parts manufacturers who have met DBAG's 
standards for the quality of their parts and inspection procedures.  (Declaration of Horst Stoehr, Plaintiff's App. of Dep. 
Testimony, at 43-44.) Each of these manufacturers warranty their parts directly to the customer. A number of these non-DBAG 
parts are independent units, such as a radio or air-conditioning system, that do not affect the overall operation of the car.  But 
other approved non-DBAG parts are integrated components, i. e., spark plugs or fuel injection and electrical system components 
from Bosch Mfg.  See id. at 44-45."
417,33," .  Illustrative of this concern is a statute of the California Vehicle Code added in 1975: ""Any person who sells and installs new 
parts in passenger cars, in the ordinary course of his business, shall provide the customer with an invoice which identifies by "
418,," brand name, or other comparable designation, the part or parts installed."" Cal.Veh.Code § 12001(a) (West Supp.1980).  While 
such a requirement should minimize the proof problems for a defective product, it has not eliminated them."
418,34," .  Defendant cites Pick Mfg. Co. v. General Motors Corp., 80 F.2d 641 (7th Cir. 1935) as support for this argument.  While that 
court recognized the advanced technology and potentially dangerous consequences of automotive engineering, one of the few 
authorities relied on by that court expressed a similar concern for delicate construction of and customer satisfaction with shoe 
manufacturing machinery.  United States v. United Shoe Mach. Corp., 264 F. 138, 167, aff'd, 258 U.S. 451, 42 S. Ct. 363, 66 L. 
Ed. 708 (1922). Yet such machines hardly present the same potential for harm as does a defective automobile part.  
Additionally, the outcome in United Shoe is likely to be different today.  See, e.g., Data General, supra."
418,35," .  In Susser v. Carvel Corp., supra, the court found that ""(since) the value of a trade-mark depends solely on the public image it 
conveys, its holder must exercise controls to assure himself that the mark is not shown in a derogatory light."" Id. at 519. "
423,*," The Honorable Charles H. Tenney of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by 
designation. "
424,1," The plaintiffs also challenge the District Court's refusal to allow them to recount statements made to them by certain garment 
manufacturers concerning the reasons their customers had given them for preferring to have their orders shipped by the 
defendants. The plaintiffs offered this hearsay testimony to prove that the manufacturers' customers preferred the defendants 
because of their lower rates. Finally, the plaintiffs challenge the Court's admission in connection with the issue of damages of a 
defense exhibit showing that from 1970 to 1975 the volume of small packages carried by at least one of the plaintiffs actually 
increased. "
426,2," Compare Columbia Metal Culvert Co., Inc. v. Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corp., 579 F.2d 20, 33-34 & n.49 (3d Cir.), cert. 
denied, 439 U.S. 876, 99 S. Ct. 214, 58 L. Ed. 2d 190 (1978) (issue of law), and H & B Equipment Co., Inc. v. International 
Harvester Co., 577 F.2d 239, 244-45 (5th Cir. 1978) (same), with Photovest Corp. v. Fotomat Corp., 606 F.2d 704, 726-27 (7th

428,3," In this case, though there was some dispute as to market definition, the jury was given no choice between conflicting claims of 
market share because there were no data from either side concerning the defendants' market share under either side's view of 
the relevant market. "
430,4," Compare Hanson v. Shell Oil Co., 541 F.2d 1352, 1359 (9th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1074, 97 S. Ct. 813, 50 L. Ed. 
2d 792 (1977) (failure to show that defendant's prices were below marginal or average variable cost constituted failure as a 
matter of law to present a prima facie case of predatory pricing), and International Air Industries, Inc. v. American Excelsior Co., 
517 F.2d 714, 724 (5th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 943, 96 S. Ct. 1411, 47 L. Ed. 2d 349 (1976) (same), with Chillicothe 
Sand & Gravel Co. v. Martin Marietta Corp., supra, 615 F.2d at 432-33 (pricing below marginal or average variable cost relevant 
but not essential), and Pacific Engineering & Production Co. v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 551 F.2d 790, 797 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 
434 U.S. 879, 98 S. Ct. 234, 54 L. Ed. 2d 160 (1977) (same)."
430,5," The plaintiffs urge that the use of UPSO's profits to subsidize UPSNY's operations violated § 2 because UPSO had a 
monopoly in its geographic market. We have ruled that the use of monopoly power in one market to gain a competitive 
advantage in another violates § 2, even in the absence of an attempt to monopolize the second market.  Berkey Photo, Inc. v. 
Eastman Kodak Co., supra, 603 F.2d at 275-76. But the plaintiffs failed to present substantial evidence that UPSO had 
monopoly power in its geographic market, or that any of the UPS companies had a monopoly in any market."
430,6," Even though we conclude that the trial evidence was insufficient to frame a jury issue on the monopolization claim, it still would 
have been prudent for the District Judge, having completed the trial, to submit that claim to the jury so that a verdict could be 
obtained, a practice that will frequently avoid the need for a retrial. "
434,1," These percentage figures include defendants' sales of solid fibre, a product which is not the subject of this suit.  Thus they may 
differ slightly from percentage figures used as a basis for settlement negotiations. "
442,2," It should be noted that in the trial of the class case, some evidence was introduced that would lend support to the proposition 
that the low profits in the corrugated industry are the result of the integrated companies' decision to maximize the profitability of 
their paperboard mills, and that the proper index of the ultimate profitability of the corrugated industry is to be found in the overall 
profitability of the mills and corrugated products divisions.  Civ. Tr. Vol. 48 at 182-83, Vol. 50 at 143-148.  The evidence on this 
point was not implausible, but it was certainly not very conclusive.  Whatever may be the truth of this proposition, it had not been 
raised at the time of the final approval of these settlements. "
445,3," Table 2 was corrected by affidavit of David Robertson, May 11, 1979.  These two figures were originally stated to be $ 
185,753,000 and $ 530,724,000, respectively. "
446,4," It should be noted here that this and similar evidence was adduced in the class trial and that the jury found against plaintiffs on 
this issue. "
447,5," In this regard, it should be noted that the jury in the class case found a 5 percent overcharge.  Plaintiffs had asked for a 7.7 
percent finding.  The defendant had declined to submit expert testimony for any overcharge figure.  Had the defendant prepared 
expert testimony of a lesser percentage figure, the jury might well have inclined toward a lower finding on this issue. "
448,6," While the class action trial against Mead Corporation and others commenced after the court approved the settlements and 
such trial is not part of the record herein, the length of that trial confirms the court's view of the protracted nature of this litigation.  
In that trial, with only three defendants initially, the evidence took three and a half months to present.  The appeals and related 
attacks upon any verdict would remain in the court system for years thereafter. "
450,7," Throughout this opinion, statements of defendants' market shares are based on Fibre Box Association data."
450,8," Throughout this opinion, statements of the number of employees considered co-conspirators is taken from the Government's 
Bill of Particulars in the criminal case, unless otherwise noted. "
451,9," In this regard, the court has heard some evidence about St. Regis during the class trial and the jury in that case identified St. 
Regis as a co-conspirator.  Of course, since St. Regis had settled and was not represented in that trial, the evidence specifically 
implicating it was not contested. "
452,10," In this regard, it should be noted that the jury in the class trial found International Paper to be a member of the alleged 
conspiracy. "
453,11," Throughout this opinion, statements of defendants' net working capital and net after-tax income are based upon Memorandum 
of Class Plaintiffs in Support of Their Motion for Preliminary Approval of All Settlements, Exhibit C."
453,12," In this regard, it should be noted that the jury in the class trial found Union Camp not to be a member of the alleged 
conspiracy. As a result, Union Camp may be entitled to collateral estoppel on the issue of its participation in the alleged 
conspiracy if the settlement is now reversed. "
454,13," Counsel for Weyerhaeuser has stated that absent such tactics it would certainly have settled for less.  Weyerhaeuser Co.'s 
Proposed Findings and Conclusions Concerning the Adequacy and Fairness of Its Settlement at 2 n. 1. "
455,14," It is noted that the class jury found it not to be a participant in the alleged conspiracy. This would, of course, raise the same 
collateral estoppel issue as Union Camp's, should this settlement be reversed."
455,15," It is noted that the class jury found it not to be a participant in the alleged conspiracy, possibly raising a collateral estoppel 
defense. "
456,16," In this regard, it is noted although not relied on herein that the class jury found Chesapeake not to be a member of the alleged 
conspiracy, thus presenting some collateral estoppel issues if this settlement is reversed."
456,17," In this regard, it should be noted that the class jury found Longview not to be a member of the alleged conspiracy, raising the 
collateral estoppel issue already mentioned should this settlement be reversed."
456,18," In this regard, it should be noted that the class jury found Willamette, Corco, and Western Kraft not to be members of the 
alleged conspiracy, raising the collateral estoppel issue already mentioned should this settlement be reversed. "
457,19," In this regard, it should be noted that the class jury found Menasha not to be a member of the alleged conspiracy, raising the 
collateral estoppel issue already mentioned should this settlement be reversed. "
458,20, Hoener was found by the class jury to be a member of the alleged conspiracy. 
459,21, The class jury found CCA to have been a member of the alleged conspiracy. 
460,22, The class jury found Weyerhaeuser to have been a member of the alleged conspiracy.

461,24, The class jury found Olinkraft to have been a member of the alleged conspiracy.
461,25, The class jury found Continental to have been a member of the alleged conspiracy. 
462,26, The class jury found St. Joe to have been a member of the alleged conspiracy.
462,27, The class jury found Inland to be a member of the alleged conspiracy. 
463,28, The class jury found Stone to be a member of the alleged conspiracy.

464,31," Large claims (over $ 1 million in purchases) represent less than a third of the total claims filed but account for more than 95% 
of the dollars purchased by claimants.  Report of Arthur Anderson & Co. on Claims Processing, Exhibit 8 at 1. "
465,32," These assumptions have been confirmed by analysis of the claims filed.  The dollar volume of claims based on invoices and 
canceled checks declined over the period (61% in 1975, 51% in 1973, 27% in 1970, 18% in 1967, 6% in 1960, and the dollar 
volume of claims based on estimates rose (38% in 1975, 48% in 1973, 72% in 1970, 82% in 1967, and 93% in 1960).  Report of 
Arthur Andersen & Co., supra , Exhibit 8 at 4.  The number of claims filed also diminished with age (6984 in 1975, 6333 in 1973, 
5028 in 1970, 3918 in 1967, and 2451 in 1960).  Id . at 6.  Finally, only 9.58% of total dollar purchases claimed are 
preliminations purchases derived from invoices or canceled checks.Id . at 8."
465,33," A purchaser with a claim against a culpable seller stands a better chance of success at trial than a purchaser against whom 
there is little or no evidence."
465,34," For example, at the time of settlement approval there was little evidence that the conspiracy affected purchases west of the 
Rockies, so that purchasers in, say, Florida, which the evidence at the criminal trial showed to have a rather high incidence of 
conspiratorial activity, might arguably be entitled to a higher return."
465,35," Arguably purchasers of more complex and expensive die-cut boxes were damaged more than purchasers of regular slotted 
containers, or purchasers of sheets. "
467,*, The date of execution was frequently at a later date than the oral agreement by counsel. 
475,1," .  The penalty for violating the Sherman Act was increased to a felony by Act of December 21, 1974, Pub.L.No. 93-528, § 3; 88 
Stat. 1708."
475,2," .  In determining an appropriate sentence in the circumstances of this case, the court considered two additional factors. First, the 
maximum fine which may be imposed for a corporation's violation of the Sherman Act is $ 1,000,000. See 15 U.S.C. § 1, as 
amended (1974). Second, in their written submission to the court, counsel for Cuisinarts represented to the court that a fine of $ 
250,000 would be among the most severe ever imposed for a criminal violation of the Sherman Act. If the proposed fine of $ 
250,000 were to be compared to all published antitrust felony fines, Cuisinarts argued, it would become apparent that ""a fine of $ 
250,000 would subject Cuisinarts to punishment greater than that imposed on almost 80 per cent of horizontal price fixing 
defendants."" Memorandum of Defendant Cuisinarts, Inc. in Support of Plea Agreement 11 (filed Dec. 19, 1980). If that fine were 
to be compared to defendant's operating revenues, net income, total assets and net worth, Cuisinarts asserted, the fine would 
appear to be even more severe. Id. at 11. The government did not contest these representations by the defendant. "
476,3," .  The eight cases which, on January 16, 1981, were consolidated by order of the JPML are listed below. The dates on which 
those actions were first filed, and the courts from which they were transferred, are indicated in parentheses. Joan Sacarob, et al. v. Cuisinarts, Inc. (D.Conn.

which those actions were first filed, and the courts from which they were transferred, are indicated in parentheses. Agnes Eisenberger v. Cuisinarts, Inc. (S.D.N.Y.

476,5," .  See note 4, supra. "
477,6," .  Although the corporate name of the respondent is Cuisinarts, Inc., the trade name of its food processor omits the final ""s"" 
(""Cuisinart""). The seven cases which include claims for the certification of a nationwide class of Cuisinarts' purchasers include 
the Archer, Blum, Cohn, Eisenberger, Harwood, Logan, and Sacarob actions. See notes 3 and 4, supra."
477,7," .  On January 5, 1981, the state of Connecticut, by its attorney general, filed the first of the motions which are under 
consideration in this proceeding. Subsequently, the attorneys general of fourteen other states filed identical motions, along with, 
in most cases, identical supporting papers. These states, with the dates of their filings indicated in parentheses, include: North 
Carolina (Jan. 12, 1981); Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island (joint motion filed on 
Jan. 12, 1981); Maryland (Jan. 20, 1981); Pennsylvania (Jan. 28, 1981); Colorado (Jan. 30, 1981); Vermont (Jan. 30, 1981); 
Virginia (Feb. 6, 1981); Wisconsin (Feb. 13, 1981); and Texas (Mar. 13, 1981). Because all of the states which appear as 
petitioners in this proceeding rely on the same statutory authority, and seek the same action by the court, the court shall, in this 
opinion, refer to their requests as a single Motion to Inspect and Copy Grand Jury Materials."
477,8," .  See note 7, supra. "
478,9," .  Cuisinarts had first stated this argument in its memorandum in opposition to the motion of the state attorneys general, but it 
had not included an explicit challenge to the jurisdiction of the court in those papers. In particular, Cuisinarts had stated that if 
the court granted the states' motion, it would then seek certification, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b), of an interlocutory appeal. 
Because § 1292(b) applies only to civil actions, any decision issued in connection with the criminal action would not be 
appealable under that provision. For that reason, Cuisinarts argued, the court should decline to hear the motion. Memorandum 
of Cuisinarts, Inc. in Opposition to Motion by Attorneys General for Release of Grand Jury Documents 2-3 (filed Feb. 13, 1981). "
479,10," .  See Scher, Emerging Issues Under the Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (""Emerging Issues""), 77 Colum.L.Rev. 679, 709 
(1977) (""The most troublesome problem related to manageability of consumer class actions has been the difficulty encountered 
in developing an efficient, but constitutionally sound, procedure for assessing and distributing treble damages to millions of class 
members""). "
480,11," .  The parties vigorously disagree in their interpretations of the phrase ""investigative files or other materials."" Petitioners rely on 
United States v. Colonial Chevrolet Corp., 629 F.2d 943, 946-947 (4th Cir. 1980), to argue that Congress intended the term 
""investigative files"" to include grand jury materials and transcripts. See Memorandum in Support of the Motion of the 
Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the States of Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island to 
Inspect and Copy Grand Jury Materials (""Petitioners' Memorandum"") 7-8 (filed Jan. 12, 1981). Respondent Cuisinarts relies on 
Matter of Grand Jury, 469 F. Supp. 666, 671 (M.D.Pa.1978), which states, without additional discussion, ""… we do not read 
""investigative files or other materials' as including grand jury materials …."" See Memorandum of Cuisinarts, Inc. in Opposition to 
Motion by Attorneys General for Release of Grand Jury Documents 16-17 (filed Feb. 13, 1981). The court has concluded that, even if this disputed phrase sweeps as broadly as petitioners assert, the other provisions of 
Section 4F(b) and, in particular, the term ""to the extent permitted by law"" impose on petitioners a burden of showing a 
compelling and particularized need for the grand jury materials. The court has further concluded that, in the circumstances of this 
litigation, petitioners have been unable to meet that burden. Accordingly, it is not necessary for the court to analyze, with 
specificity, the phrase ""investigative files or other materials,"" or to resolve this particular dispute between the parties. Although the court shall not attempt to resolve this dispute, one point must be made concerning the meaning of the phrase 
""investigative files and other materials."" Relying on United States v. Colonial Chevrolet, 629 F.2d 943, 946-947 (4th Cir. 1980), 
petitioners suggest that grand jury documents are part of the Justice Department's ""investigative files"" simply because those 
documents are in the Justice Department's possession. Petitioners' Memorandum 7-8. Petitioners forget, however, that HN7[
] 
a federal grand jury is an arm of the District Court, and thus of the judiciary, and not an agent of the Justice Department or of any 
other executive agency. It is the District Court which impanels, supervises, and discharges the grand jury. See Procter & 
Gamble, supra, 356 U.S. at 684-685, 78 S. Ct. at 987-988 (Whittaker, J., concurring) (""(G)rand jury minutes and transcripts are 
not the property of the Government's attorneys, agents or investigators …. Instead those documents are records of the court""). 
See also State of Illinois v. Widmar, (1980-81) Trade Cases (CCH) P 63,771 (N.D.Ill.1981) (Because grand jury materials are the 
property of the judicial branch, Section 4F(b) ""applies only and exclusively to the investigative files and other materials acquired 
by and belonging to the executive branch, of which the Department of Justice is a member."" Accordingly, ""Section 4F(b) does 
not refer to what is strictly thought of as grand jury materials""). "
481,12," .  As floor manager of Hart-Scott-Rodino on behalf of the Senate Judiciary Committee, see United States v. Colonial Chevrolet, 
supra, 629 F.2d at 947, Senator Abourezk was uniquely qualified to interpret the various provisions of the statute. The remarks 
which he made in the course of floor debate provide insight into the meaning of Section 4F(b), which was proposed by the 
House and described in the House Committee Report which is reprinted in (1976) U.S.Code Cong. & Ad.News at 2586. Senator 
Abourezk's remarks were made in response to the plausible argument by Senator Hruska that Section 4F(b) could turn the 
Department of Justice into a ""massive document distribution center."" See 122 Cong.Rec. 29144 (1976). The contrast between 
Senator Hruska's critique, id., and Senator Abourezk's response, see 122 Cong.Rec. 29160 (1976), suggests that the aims of 
Section 4F(b) are much less sweeping than petitioners assert. (Note that Section 4G of Hart-Scott-Rodino, 15 U.S.C. § 15g, 
permits state governments to retain private attorneys to bring parens patriae actions). MR. HRUSKA: I will point the Senator to two other changes to facilitate large recoveries and private attorney's fees. First, newly added Section 4F(b), which was not part of the Senate bill passed on June 10 (1976,) authorizes state officials 
and retained private attorneys to request ""any investigative files or other materials which are or may be relevant or material 
to the actual or potential cause of action"" available to a State, whenever the Attorney General of the United States has 
brought an antitrust action which may affect the States. For example, in large antitrust cases charging nationwide activities by national corporations, all affected States would be 
notified by the Department of Justice. Under this new provision, State officials and retained private attorneys would be entitled to demand truckloads of 
investigative materials, which conceivably might be relevant not only to an actual but even to a ""potential cause of action."" For example, in the typical big antitrust case, such as the IBM monopoly case, literally millions of documents may be 
relevant or material to an antitrust cause of action. The Justice Department could thus become a massive document 
distribution center for the benefit of State officials and of the enterprising private antitrust attorneys interested in developing 
a parens patriae lawsuit out of the Justice Department's investigative files. MR. ABOUREZK: Also, Senator Hruska has raised objection to Section 4F(b) of the Byrd motion …. (Text of Section 4F(b) 
omitted). This section specifically limits the Attorney General's power to release documents to whatever his powers are under 
existing law. Under existing law, he cannot turn over materials given in response to a grand jury demand or to a civil 
investigative demand. Therefore, the section is limited by existing law to cases where materials were turned over 
voluntarily. This section is in the bill because it was requested by the members of the House conferees (sic) who had met 
on this."
481,122," Cong.Rec. 29144, 29160 (1976). Senator Abourezk provided an authoritative Senate view of the provision proposed by the 
House. The intention of the legislators most closely connected to this provision was not in any sense ""equivocal."" See page 
1020, infra; contra, United States v. B. F. Goodrich Co., 619 F.2d 798, 800 (9th Cir. 1980). "
482,13," .  In the Antitrust Civil Process Act of 1962 (""1962 Act""), 15 U.S.C. §§ 1311-1314, Congress had authorized the Justice 
Department to issue civil investigative demands (""CID's"") as part of its investigations of possible antitrust violations. Pursuant to 
such CID's, Justice Department investigators were permitted to acquire documentary material relating to those investigations. 
The 1962 Act included, however, extensive guidelines for preserving the confidentiality of those materials. See 15 U.S.C. § 1313 
(1962). In 1976, Hart-Scott-Rodino amended the 1962 Act to permit (1) the issuance of CID's to third-parties, as well as to 
persons suspected of antitrust violations, see 15 U.S.C. § 1312(a), as amended (1976), and (2) the submission of written 
interrogatories by, and the taking of oral depositions from, persons to whom CID's have been issued, id. Hart-Scott-Rodino in no way modified the procedures of the 1962 Act for preserving the confidentiality of CID materials. Indeed, 
Hart-Scott-Rodino extended those procedures to protect the kinds of oral and written materials which it was, in other provisions, 
authorizing the Justice Department to collect. Thus under federal antitrust law, as it existed before Hart-Scott- Rodino and as it 
now exists, the Justice Department bears a duty to maintain the confidentiality of CID materials. The Assistant Attorney General 
in charge of the Antitrust Division is required to designate an antitrust investigator to serve as ""custodian of documentary 
material, answers to interrogatories, and transcripts of oral testimony,"" 15 U.S.C. § 1313(a). The custodian is to ""take physical 
possession"" of the CID material, 15 U.S.C. § 1313(c)(1), and while it is ""in the possession of the custodian, no … material … so 
produced shall be available for examination, without the consent of the person who produced such material … and, in the case 
of any product of discovery produced pursuant to an express demand for such material, of the person from whom the discovery 
was obtained, by any individual other than a duly authorized official, employee, or agent of the Department of Justice,"" 15 U.S.C. 
§ 1313(c)(3). The custodian may provide the CID materials to a Justice Department attorney for use ""before any court, grand 
jury, or Federal administrative or regulatory agency in any case or proceeding,"" 15 U.S.C. § 1313(d)(1). ""Upon the completion of 
any such case, grand jury, or proceeding,"" however, ""such attorney shall return to the custodian any such material, answers or 
transcripts so delivered which have not passed into the control of such court, grand jury, or agency, through the introduction 
thereof into the record of such case or proceeding,"" id. (emphasis supplied).  After the completion of any case or proceeding 
arising from the investigation for which the CID material had been produced, or after the passing of a reasonable period of time 
in which no case or proceeding has been commenced, the custodian is required, upon written request of the person who 
produced the material, to return the material to that person. See 15 U.S.C. § 1313(e). There are only two limitations on this 
requirement. First, the Justice Department may make copies of the CID documents. See 15 U.S.C. § 1313(c)(2). Second, the 
custodian may return only that material ""which has not passed into the control of any court, grand jury or agency through the 
introduction thereof into the record of such case or proceeding,"" 15 U.S.C. § 1313(e). An analysis of these provisions, and especially of 15 U.S.C. § 1313(d)-(e), provides a further basis for rejecting petitioners' 
interpretation of Section 4F(b). To begin, it is clear that CID materials that are not put before a grand jury are not subject to 
disclosure requests by state attorneys general. Section 1313(c) so provides. The Justice Department so stated at oral argument. 
Tr. 9. The commentators concur. See Emerging Issues 692 (""The absolute nature of the confidentiality protection afforded under 
(s 1313) should operate to limit the scope of Section 4F(b) …. Although (s 1313(d) (1)) does permit use of CID material in 
connection with court proceedings, this applies only if ""any attorney of the Department of Justice has been designated to appear' 
before the court, and thus does not include a state attorney general engaged in a parens patriae investigation or suit""). This fact, 
alone, suggests that Congress did not intend that grand jury materials be released. In both the 1962 Act and Hart-Scott-Rodino, 
Congress made clear that the investigative materials collected by the Justice Department should remain confidential. Petitioners 
offer no principled basis for believing that grand jury materials should be treated with less of a concern for confidentiality than is 
required for CID's. In the relevant statutory provisions, Congress never indicates any intention of treating grand jury materials 
with a lower degree of confidentiality. Indeed, the fact that Congress did not establish specific guidelines for the secrecy of grand 
jury materials may have resulted from its belief that the pre-existing Rule 6(e), Fed.R.Crim.P., had settled that issue of law 
sufficiently. Thus the legislative scheme which Congress created to protect CID materials from disclosure suggests how 
Congress intended that grand jury materials be preserved. In the present case, however, much of the CID material which had been collected by the Justice Department was also 
introduced before the grand jury. At oral argument, the Justice Department represented that it had acquired no more than 50,000 
documents as a result of its investigation of Cuisinarts. Tr. 7. Of these, approximately 26,000 documents had been produced by "
483,," Cuisinarts pursuant to grand jury subpoenas. Tr. 6-7. At the same time, the Justice Department represented that there was 
""substantial overlap"" between those documents which had been produced pursuant to CID's and those which had been 
produced pursuant to grand jury subpoenas. Tr. 8-9. It would appear that those documents which were first produced pursuant 
to a CID and later presented to the grand jury are subject to the strict confidentiality requirements of 15 U.S.C. § 1313, and thus, 
under § 1313(c), are available to Justice Department personnel only. Because a ""substantial"" number of the grand jury 
documents which the states now seek were, in fact, first produced pursuant to a CID, the states' disclosure request would 
appear to be barred, to that extent, by the terms of 15 U.S.C. § 1313. It might be argued that a CID document loses its protections under § 1313 once it is produced to a grand jury. See, e.g., Tr. 9-15 
(oral argument of attorney for United States). Such an argument would have to be rejected, however, for two reasons. First, 
even if the protections of § 1313 were removed as soon as the material had been produced to the grand jury, the protections of 
Rule 6(e), Fed.R.Crim.P., which are at least as stringent, would attach to those materials at the moment that they first came 
before the grand jury. Second, in both §§ 1313(d) and 1313(e), Congress recognized the well-settled principle that materials 
introduced to the grand jury enter the control, and become part of the record, of the court. See Procter & Gamble, supra, 356 
U.S. at 684-685, 78 S. Ct. at 987-988 (Whittaker, J., concurring). Indeed, in § 1313(d)(1) Congress provided that material which 
has ""passed into the control"" of a grand jury, ""through the introduction thereof into the record"" of a proceeding, may not be 
returned to the Justice Department custodian. In § 1313(e), it provided that such grand jury material may not be returned to the 
person who produced it. Thus in § 1313, Congress appeared to place grand jury material outside the control of the Justice 
Department. If that is the case, there must be a serious question whether the Justice Department would have the power, under 
Section 4F(b), to provide the grand jury materials requested by the states. Cf. State of Illinois v. Widmar, (1980-81) Trade Cases 
(CCH) P 63,771 (N.D.Ill.1981). "
484,14," .  In In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489, 491 (2d Cir. 1973), our Court of Appeals summarized some of the policy considerations which 
underlie this tradition of grand jury secrecy. The tradition rests on a number of interests the interest of the government against disclosure of its investigation of crime 
which may forewarn the intended objects of its inquiry or inhibit future witnesses from speaking freely; the interest of a 
witness against the disclosure of testimony of others which he has had no opportunity to cross-examine or rebut, or of his 
own testimony on matters which may be irrelevant or where he may have been subjected to prosecutorial brow-beating 
without the protection of counsel; the similar interests of other persons who may have been unfavorably mentioned by 
grand jury witnesses or in questions of the prosecutor; protection of witnesses against reprisal; and the interests and 
protection of the grand jurors themselves. "
485,15," .  In United States v. Sobotka, 623 F.2d 764 (2d Cir. 1980), our Court of Appeals drew on Douglas Oil, supra, 441 U.S. at 222-
223, 99 S. Ct. at 1674-1675, to hold that, where grand jury proceedings had been concluded and where the party seeking 
disclosure of the grand jury's documents was a public body, the burden on that party of showing a compelling necessity for the 
documents was reduced.  United States v. Sobotka, supra, 623 F.2d at 767. ""Nonetheless,"" the court stated, ""some necessity 
need be shown by the party seeking disclosure."" Id. In particular, the court held that ""the showing of need must be made ""with 
particularity' so that ""the secrecy of the proceedings (may be) lifted discretely and limitedly.' "" Id. at 768, quoting United States v. 
Procter & Gamble Co., 356 U.S. 677, 682-683, 78 S. Ct. 983, 986, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1077 (1958). It is precisely such a showing of 
particularized need which the petitioners in this proceeding have declined to attempt."
485,16," .  In their memoranda, petitioners specifically contend that they are not required either to particularize their need for grand jury 
materials or to narrow the scope of their request. See e.g., Petitioners' Memorandum 11. At oral argument, petitioners similarly 
refused to particularize their request for the grand jury documents. The following colloquy between the court and counsel for 
petitioners illustrates petitioners' position. THE COURT: Let me ask you whether your argument isn't something like a bootstrap argument; namely, that if the Grand 
Jury received something in evidence, if the Grand Jury had it, it must be relevant to every state's possible claim; isn't that 
really what you are saying? Isn't your claim here really that if the Grand Jury had it, it's relevant, it's got to be relevant; that's why you want it all? MR. KOVACS: I think that absent knowledge about what was produced to the Grand Jury, it's a very difficult question to 
answer. "
486,," Documents might be subpoenaed that, in fact, might not have relationship to an unlawful antitrust violation. For instance, 
financials THE COURT: Hold on a second. So you wouldn't be able to answer the question of relevance, you're saying, until, in effect, you've gotten it all? You can't 
make a judgment about relevance? MR. KOVACS: That's correct. An example would be THE COURT: So, in fact, your argument is that in all cases of this sort, the parens patriae litigants really are entitled to 
everything? MR. KOVACS: That's correct. THE COURT: Without a showing of relevance at the threshold? Inasmuch as MR. KOVACS: I think what we would argue is that there must be a presumption of relevance attached as a result of the fact 
that the subpoena for those documents was issued, so that some attorney, and with supervision by the appropriate 
authorities in the Department of Justice, made a decision that those documents requested and that testimony taken bore 
some relevance to the alleged violation. THE COURT: So that's the argument that I suggested: If the Grand Jury had it, it's relevant? MR. KOVACS: I think correct, yes; that is correct. On the other hand, however, I know in our investigations we might ask for a balance sheet. While that might not be relevant 
to the evidence of the unlawful agreement, it might be relevant to damages. But I think it goes farther out, as far as its 
relevance is concerned. Tr. 44-46."
486,17," .  There is some authority for holding that the policy of grand jury secrecy has a more limited application to subpoenaed 
documents than it does to transcripts of grand jury testimony and proceedings. See, e.g., State of Illinois v. Sarbaugh, 552 F.2d 
768, 772 n.2 (7th Cir. 1977), cert. denied sub nom.  J.L. Simmons Co. v. Illinois, 434 U.S. 889, 98 S. Ct. 262, 54 L. Ed. 2d 174 
(1977), citing United States v. Interstate Dress Carriers, Inc., 280 F.2d 52, 54 (2d Cir. 1960). At oral argument, counsel for both 
the United States and for respondent Cuisinarts argued that the court should give identical treatment to subpoenaed documents 
and to transcripts of proceedings. Tr. 11, 57. (They disagreed, however, on the question of what sort of treatment that should 
be). Similarly, petitioners have never urged that the court adopt a distinction between subpoenaed documents and grand jury 
transcripts. Having considered the views of counsel, and having reviewed the case law concerning grand jury secrecy, the court 
has found no convincing reason to apply different standards, or to accord different treatment, to subpoenaed documents and to 
transcripts of grand jury proceedings in this case. See Matter of Grand Jury, 469 F. Supp. 666, 671 (M.D.Pa.1978). In view of 
the court's denial of petitioners' motion, therefore, the petitioners shall not, at this time, be entitled either to documents 
subpoenaed by the grand jury, or to transcripts of proceedings conducted by the grand jury. "
495,1," See e.g., Javelin Corp. v. Uniroyal, Inc., 546 F.2d 276 (9 Cir. 1977), cert. den.  431 U.S. 938, 97 S.Ct. 2651, 53 L.Ed.2d 256 
(1977) (plaintiff is barred from recovery only when the illegal conspiracy would not have been formed but for plaintiff's 
participation); Bernstein v. Universal Pictures, Inc., 517 F.2d 976, 982 (2 Cir. 1975) (plaintiff may be denied antitrust relief when 
his culpability in the violation is equal to that of defendant); Dreibus v. Wilson, 529 F.2d 170, 174 (9 Cir. 1975) (high degree of "
496,," involvement in the illegal act could constitute a defense); South-East Coal Co. v. Consolidation Coal Co., 434 F.2d 767 (6 Cir. 
1970), cert. den.  402 U.S. 983, 91 S.Ct. 1662, 29 L.Ed.2d 149 (1971), reh. den.  404 U.S. 877, 92 S.Ct. 28, 30 L.Ed.2d 124 
(1971) (plaintiff could not recover if equally responsible with defendants in the formation of the conspiracy); Premier Electrical 
Constr. Co. v. Miller-Davis Co., 422 F.2d 1132, 1138 (7 Cir. 1970), cert. den.  400 U.S. 828, 91 S.Ct. 56, 27 L.Ed.2d 58 (1970) 
(only a plaintiff who bears equal responsibility for creating and establishing an illegal scheme is barred); cf.  Kestenbaum v. 
Falstaff Brewing Corp., 514 F.2d 690 (5 Cir. 1975), cert. den.  440 U.S. 909, 99 S.Ct. 1218, 59 L.Ed.2d 457 (1979) (while no 
bar, plaintiff's participation might reduce damages); Greene v. General Foods Corp., 517 F.2d 635, 646 (5 Cir. 1975), cert. den.  
424 U.S. 942, 96 S.Ct. 1409, 47 L.Ed.2d 348 (1976) (equitable defenses not applicable in antitrust action where ""the plaintiff is 
representative of the small businessman who acquiesces in or is coerced into a program or pattern of conduct violative of the 
antitrust laws because of the disproportionate bargaining power of the corporation from which he obtains most of his stock in 
trade.""). "
497,2," There are many lower federal court decisions which also hold that a plaintiff's unclean hands is not a defense in a federal 
antitrust action.  See, e.g., Pearl Brewing Co. v. Jos. Schlitz Brewing Co., 415 F.Supp. 1122, 1126 (S.D.Tex.1976); Credit 
Bureau Reports, Inc. v. Retail Credit Co., 358 F.Supp. 780, 796 (S.D.Tex.1971), aff'd 476 F.2d 989 (5 Cir. 1973); Purex Corp., 
Ltd. v. General Goods Corp., 318 F.Supp. 322, 323-324 (C.D.Cal.1970). See, also, Health Corp. of America v. New Jersey 
Dental Ass'n, above, 424 F.Supp. at 932-934 (plaintiff's violation of state statutes regulating the practice of dentistry is not a 
defense to defendant's antitrust violations). "
498,3," Ordinarily, the issues of per se illegality and reasonableness under the antitrust laws should not be determined upon stipulated 
facts and on a motion for summary judgment.  It was the parties' decision, however, to try the case in this manner.  Plaintiff has 
not asked that the case be remanded for trial; it merely asks us to reverse the decision of the judge below, and it has not 
responded to defendants' argument that the stipulated facts show no antitrust violation.  Glasofer argued below that (1) 
Osterlund's refusal to deal constituted an unreasonable restraint of trade because Newark was ""compelled to pay a higher price"" 
and (2) the alleged restraint of trade was horizontal in nature since Federal had ""veto power"" over Osterlund's decision regarding 
whether it would continue to deal with Glasofer and thus was per se illegal. "
499,4," The Court of Appeals also concluded that the combined effect of the company-town policy (defendant refused to grant 
franchisees in the cities in which inns owned by it or its subsidiaries were located) and the non-Holiday Inn clause (franchisees 
could not own or operate any hotel, motel or motor inn which was not a Holiday Inn) constituted a horizontal allocation of 
territories between defendant, operating on the retail level as a motel-operator, and defendant's franchisees. Id. at 1253. "

new participating hospitals.  App. 141a.  These included the following: ""The hospital must meet a clearly evident need for health care services in its defined service area. Health care institutions and 
institutional services shall be approved, and/or if required by law, certified as necessary, by the designated planning agency or 
areawide health planning agency respectively; or, when effective, by the designated State Agency as provided for in Public Law 
93-641, the 'National Health Planning and Resources Development Act of 1974.'"" Id., at 146a. Blue Cross added that it retained the final discretion in deciding whether to accept a new hospital, and then included a warning 
to those contemplating new construction: ""Because lack of knowledge by any applicant of this requirement shall not be considered sufficient reason for waiving it, 
community groups contemplating construction of new hospitals are urged to consult with Blue Cross, if they expect to apply for 
participation in the hospital service plan, at some time well in advance of actual construction."" Ibid. "

Sherman Act, and that the allegations of conspiracy were insufficient.  These claims are not before this Court. "
519,7," See generally S. Rep. No. 93-1285, pp. 4-39 (1974) (hereinafter 1974 Senate Report).  In 1972, for example, Congress passed 
§ 1122 of the Social Security Act, 42 U. S. C. § 1320a-1, which authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to enter 
into agreements with willing States, under which a state agency would be designated as the appropriate body for approving 
capital expenditures in the health-care area.  Under § 1122, federal reimbursements under programs including Medicare and 
Medicaid do not include the capital expenses of hospitals that have not received agency approval. In 1976, Missouri chose not to renew its agreement with the Federal Government under § 1122, thus eliminating the previous 
state program for approval of hospital construction.  Brief for Respondents 6, n. 6."

520,10," As the 1974 Senate Report put it: ""The need for strengthened and coordinated planning for personal health services is growing more apparent each day.  In the 
view of the Committee the health care industry does not respond to classic marketplace forces.  The highly technical nature of 
medical services together with the growth of third party reimbursement mechanisms act to attenuate the usual forces influencing 
the behavior of consumers with respect to personal health services. . . . ""Investment in costly health care resources, such as hospital beds, coronary care units or radio-isotope treatment centers is 
frequently made without regard to the existence of similar facilities or equipment already operating in an area.  Investment in 
costly facilities and equipment not only results in capital accumulation, but establishes an ongoing demand for payment to 
support those services. . . . ""A recently published study indicates that by 1975, over 67,000 unneeded hospital beds will be in operation throughout the 
United States. ""Hospital beds, though unused, contribute substantial additional costs to the health care industry."" 1974 Senate Report, at 39."
520,11," The 1974 Senate Report stated: ""Widespread access and distribution problems exist with respect to medical facilities and services.  In many urban areas, 
hospitals, clinics and other medical care institutions and services are crowded into relatively tiny sectors, while large areas go 
poorly served or completely unserved.  Many rural communities are completely without a physician or any other type of health 
care service, while adjacent urban areas are oversupplied."" Ibid."
520,12," The Committee also sought to reduce the threat of domination of HSA decisionmaking by providers with a personal stake in 
the existing health-care system.  1979 Senate Report, at 57-59.  See also Rosenblatt, Health Care Reform and Administrative 
Law: A Structural Approach, 88 Yale L. J. 243, 304-330 (1978) (describing problems of establishing consumer representation in 
HSA's). "
521,13," In a new subsection, 42 U. S. C. § 300k-2 (b)(1) (1976 ed., Supp. IV), Congress made the finding that ""the effect of 
competition on decisions of providers respecting the supply of health services and facilities is diminished,"" causing ""duplication 
and excess supply of certain health services and facilities."" It added that where ""competition appropriately allocates supply 
consistent with health systems plans and State health plans,"" planning agencies should ""give priority . . . to actions which would 
strengthen the effect of competition on the supply of such services."" § 300k-2 (b)(3).  But, for ""health services, such as inpatient 
health services and other institutional health services, for which competition does not or will not appropriately allocate supply,"" 
agencies should ""take actions . . . to allocate the supply of such services."" § 300k-3 (b)(2)."
521,14," Significantly, the MAHSA health systems plan only called on insurers to create incentives to hold down the costs of care in 
existing institutions, and made no mention of a role for insurers in restraining unneeded hospital construction.  The plan calls on 
the ""reimbursement system [to] promote appropriate utilization of hospital services, provide positive incentives for efficient 
institutions, actively encourage utilization of less costly but equal quality alternatives to inpatient care, and develop uniform 
reimbursement programs."" App. 67a.  But it then asserts that ""[capital] investment in institutions [shall] be controlled by an 
appropriate review agency."" Ibid. "
522,15," See n. 7, supra.  If it had done so, this case probably would not have arisen.  The state agency would have conditioned all 
hospital construction on issuance of a ""certificate of need."" See supra, at 385-386.  Parties pursuing hospital construction 
without a certificate of need would now be subject to legal penalties.  42 U. S. C. § 300m-2 (a)(4)(A) (1976 ed., Supp. IV). Missouri subsequently has established a state agency and enacted ""certificate of need"" legislation.  Mo. Rev. Stat. § 197.300 et 
seq. (Supp. 1980)."
522,16," Congress knew how to give an HSA policy greater legal effect.  Under 42 U. S. C. § 300l-2 (e) (1976 ed., Supp. IV), HSA 
approval -- subject to review by the Secretary -- is required for expenditures of funds under certain federal programs."
522,17," As noted supra, at 387-388, in 1979 competition was given a more prominent place in the thinking of Congress. "
523,18," Nevertheless, because Congress has remained convinced that competition does not operate effectively in some parts of the 
health-care industry, e. g., 42 U. S. C. § 300k-2 (b) (1976 ed., Supp. IV), we emphasize that our holding does not foreclose 
future claims of antitrust immunity in other factual contexts.  Although favoring a reversal in this case, the United States as 
amicus curiae asserts that ""there are some activities that must, by implication, be immune from antitrust attack if HSAs and State 
Agencies are to exercise their authorized powers."" Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16, n. 11.  Where, for example, an 
HSA has expressly advocated a form of cost-saving cooperation among providers, it may be that antitrust immunity is 
""necessary to make the [NHPRDA] work."" Silver v. New York Stock Exchange, 373 U.S. 341, 357 (1963). See 124 Cong. Rec. 
34932 (1978) (Rep. Rogers) (""The intent of Congress was that HSA's and providers who voluntarily work with them in carrying 
out the HSA's statutory mandate should not be subject to the antitrust laws. If they were, Public Law 93-641 simply could not be 
implemented"").  Such a case would differ substantially from the present one, where the conduct at issue is not cooperation 
among providers, but an insurer's refusal to deal with a provider that failed to heed the advice of an HSA."
523,19," This holding does not, of course, suggest anything about the merits of the antitrust claim in this case.  These matters remain to 
be litigated on remand, where the court should give attention to the particular economic context in which the alleged conspiracy 
and ""refusal to deal"" took place. "

537,5," Jaymar is an Indiana Corporation with its principal place of business in Michigan City, Indiana."
537,6," Of the nineteen state attorneys general who requested the Commission's investigative files, seventeen intervened in this 
litigation.  The states they represent are as follows: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, "
538,," Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia and 
West Virginia.  See 28 U.S.C. § 2403 (1976).  The two nonintervening states are Illinois and New Jersey."
538,7," See n.2 at 507, and accompanying text."
538,8," In addition to Jaymar's nationwide business as a retail distributor, it licenses its trademarks to foreign manufacturers of men's 
clothing, and sells and licenses its manufacturing and marketing skills subject to confidential disclosure agreements, to such 
foreign businesses."
538,9," Note that the Consent Order was not an admission by Jaymar that it violated any law but merely constituted a settlement 
agreement."
538,10," Jaymar has contended throughout these proceedings that the unamended, rather than the amended version of § 6(f) should 
govern this case.  Jaymar reasons that it submitted its files prior to the effective date of the amended § 6(f), and that the state 
attorneys general also submitted their requests prior to that date.  However, since disclosure by the FTC to state attorneys 
general is to take place after the effective date of § 6(f), as amended, we agree with Judge Sharp that the amended version of § 
6(f) governs in this case.  We therefore find it unnecessary to reach the question of retroactivity.  In any event, even if we were to 
hold that amended § 6(f) does not govern this case, Jaymar's argument would still fail because the scope of disclosure permitted 
by the old law cannot be deemed to be less expansive than that permitted by the new.  As indicated beforehand, one of 
Congress' purposes in amending § 6(f) was to make explicit the previously implicit authority of the FTC to make investigative 
disclosures to state attorneys general.  See Interco, Inc. v. FTC, 478 F. Supp. 103 (D.D.C.1979), appeal dismissed, No. 79-1423 
(D.C.Cir.1980); Martin Marietta Corp. v. FTC, 475 F. Supp. 338 (D.D.C.1979), affirmed as modified, No. 79-1783 (D.C.Cir.1980).  
Also see Fleming v. FTC, No. 80-2328 1980-81 Trade Cas. (CCH) P63,642, (D.D.C. Nov. 24, 1980)."
538,11," In addition to the possible state violations involved in this matter, the state attorneys general contend that Jaymar may be 
liable for damages under the parens patriae provisions of the Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, 15 U.S.C. § 15c (1976). "
539,12," On March 26, 1980, Jaymar submitted a proposal granting limited access to the state attorneys general.  By the 
aforementioned letter dated April 14, 1980, the Commission rejected Jaymar's proposal on the ground that each state attorney 
general desired access to the entire investigative file."
539,13," The district court subsequently extended the injunction to September 8, 1980."
539,14," Note that subsequent to the district court's decision of September 8, 1980, both Jaymar and the state attorneys general 
attempted to settle this case.  However, an impasse was reached.  On October 15, 1980, the state attorneys general motioned 
this court to dissolve the present stay and order disclosure of the materials.  A month later, on November 23, 1980, Jaymar 
motioned this court to dismiss the intervenors from these proceedings.  On December 10, 1980, this court denied both motions."
539,15," On September 11, 1980, the district court granted Jaymar's motion for a stay of the court's order of September 8, 1980, 
pending appeal.  It further provided that the order will continue in effect until ten (10) days after this court's decision."

18(a) of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968, 82 Stat. 823, 23 U.S.C. § 138 (1964 ed., Supp. V). "
540,17," The ""committed to agency discretion"" exception has stimulated extensive debate among scholars.  See Saferstein, 
Nonreviewability: A Functional Analysis of ""Committed to Agency Discretion,"" 82 Harv.L.Rev. 367, 372-73 nn. 28 & 29 (1968)."
540,18," The additional factors that Jaymar contends should be considered by the Commission are: 1) its interest in preserving the 
confidentiality of its business information and 2) the States' need for this information for their respective law enforcement 
purposes.  Jaymar obviously assumes that the state attorneys general will release sensitive documents to the public.  Given the 
fact that Congress specifically prohibited such release under § 21(f) of the Improvements Act, we find Jaymar's concern 
unfounded.  See n.4 supra at 508, and accompanying text. "
541,19," In a similar context, this analysis has recently been utilized by the Supreme Court in Southern Ry. Co. v. Seaboard Allied 
Milling Corp., 442 U.S. 444, 455-56, 99 S. Ct. 2388, 2394-95, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1017 (1979). The court stated: The statute is silent on what factors should guide the Commission's decision; not only is ""(t)he extent of this inquiry … not … 
marked … with certainty,"" cf.  United States v. Louisiana, 290 U.S., at 77, 54 S. Ct. at 32, but also on the face of the statute 
there is simply ""no law to apply"" in determining if the decision is correct.  Cf.  Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, 401 
U.S. 402, 410, 91 S. Ct. 814, 820, 28 L. Ed. 2d 136. Similar circumstances have been emphasized in cases in which we have 
inferred nonreviewability. See Barlow v. Collins, 397 U.S. 159, 166, 90 S. Ct. 832, 837, 25 L. Ed. 2d 192, Schilling v. Rogers,

bank the voting shares of which are sought to be acquired is a State bank, in order to provide for the submission of the views 
and recommendations of the Comptroller of the Currency or the State supervisory authority, as the case may be.  The views and 
recommendations shall be submitted within thirty calendar days of the date on which notice is given, or within ten calendar days 
of such date if the Board advises the Comptroller of the Currency or the State supervisory authority that an emergency exists 
requiring expeditious action.  If the thirty-day notice period applies and if the Comptroller of the Currency or the State supervisory 
authority so notified by the Board disapproves the application in writing within this period, the Board shall forthwith give written 
notice of the fact to the applicant.  Within three days after giving such notice to the applicant, the Board shall notify in writing the 
applicant, and the disapproving authority of the date for commencement of a hearing by it on such application.  Any such hearing 
shall be commenced not less than ten nor more than thirty days after the Board has given written notice to the applicant of the 
action of the disapproving authority.  The length of any such hearing shall be determined by the Board, but it shall afford all 
interested parties a reasonable opportunity to testify at such hearing.  At the conclusion thereof, the Board shall, by order, grant

553,6," The Board's Program Director for Banking Structure made the following public comments in 1974: Upon completion of a draft of an application, much trouble, time, and expense can often be avoided if arrangements are made to 
review the application with Federal Reserve Bank personnel.  Any Reserve Bank will be glad to discuss a draft with you, point 
out instances where misunderstanding may exist, and tell you if there are areas where more information is required.  By all 
means be certain to discuss any unusual aspects of the proposal with the Reserve Bank.  This assistance, let me stress, is "
554,," technical only, and in no way affects the final decision on the case.  Provision of the required information in the correct way can 
only help expedite that decision whether it be yea or nay.  But it can save you, and us, a great deal of expense and time. You may have heard that the System attempts to act on applications within ninety days.  That is true.  But it means within ninety 
days of having before it a complete application.  All too often we have been forced to delay a decision on an application because 
of failure on the part of the applicant to complete all prerequisite actions, or because the application is inadequate in some other 
way.  You may say that the System is responsible for not having told you what to do.  Not so.  While we are here to help, 
completing the application is your responsibility.  After all, the requirements are clearly spelled out in the general instructions of 
the application forms In the final analysis it is the responsibility of the applicant to provide an application complete in all respects, 
including completion of prerequisite steps. In order to process most cases within a ninety-day period, the Board and the Reserve Banks have adopted the policy that where 
substantive information is found lacking in an application, that application will not be accepted by the System.  Rather, it will be 
returned to the applicant for insertion of such material, and then it may be resubmitted.  On some occasions, additional 
information of a less critical nature may be requested without returning the application.  In these cases, (the) applicant is 
requested to submit the additional information simultaneously to the Board and to the Reserve Bank within a specified period of 
time in order that the overall processing time not be extended.  Sometimes, even near the end of the processing period, it is 
necessary to obtain additional information from the applicant.  In these cases, the sooner (the) applicant submits the information, 
the less delay will be encountered before the Board's final decision. Obviously, an application must be legally sufficient or we will not process it unless formal demand to do so is made by the 
applicant.  If so, a favorable decision cannot be expected It is with the second test, that is, the test of informational adequacy, 
that we encounter difficulty.  Here we are saying that what we want is an application containing information necessary for a 
reasonable man to make a judgment as to whether it should be approved or denied.  It is on this point how much information 
does a reasonable man need to make a decision that opinions differ.  Understandably, applicants generally feel that their 
applications, as submitted, contain enough information to indicate clear approval This may indeed be so, but it is not always so 
clear to those who must make the decision, that is, a Federal Reserve Bank acting under delegated authority or the Board.  So 
the wise applicant will assume a large burden of the proof, and make certain that his application supports with fact those public 
benefits contended. Leavitt, What the Fed Likes to See in a Bank Holding Company Application, 91 Banking L. J. 320, 321-25 (1974)."

(1) In the case of applications (vi) By a bank holding company to acquire ownership or control of shares or assets of a bank, or to merge or consolidate with 
any other bank holding company, the applicant shall, prior to filing such application, cause to be published on the same day of each of 2 consecutive weeks a 
notice containing the name of the applicant or applicants, the subject matter of the application, the location at which the applicant 
proposes to engage in business, and an invitation to the public to give written comment upon the application to the appropriate 
Federal Reserve Bank no later than 30 days after the date of publication of the first notice. Such notice shall be published in a 
newspaper of general circulation in (E) the community or communities in which the head offices of the largest subsidiary bank, if 
any, of an applicant and of each bank, shares of which are to be directly or indirectly acquired, are located in the case of 
applications under section 3 of the Bank Holding Company Act. HN14[

respect to applications are handled in a uniform manner."" 43 Fed.Reg. 49974 (1978). The regulations have subsequently been amended by the Board, chiefly to require the use of a standardized form of notice to be 
published in the classified legal notices section of the newspaper, and to require submission of the application to the Reserve 
Bank immediately after the first notice is published.  The amended regulations, which became effective on February 1, 1981, 
provide in pertinent part as follows: Notice of applications.  (1) In the case of applications (vi) By a bank holding company to acquire ownership or control of shares or assets of a bank, or to merge or consolidate with 
any other bank holding company, the applicant shall cause to be published on the same day of each of two consecutive weeks a notice in the form prescribed by 
the Board.  The notice shall be placed in the classified advertising legal notices section of the newspaper, and the first notice "
556,," may appear no more than ninety calendar days prior to acceptance by the Reserve Bank of the application.  The notice must 
provide an opportunity for the public to give written comment on the application to the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank for at 
least thirty days after the date of publication of the first notice. In addition, between publication of the first and second notice, the 
applicant shall submit to the appropriate Reserve Bank for acceptance copies of the application, together with a copy of the 
notice as it appeared in the newspaper. Such notice shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in (E) the 
community or communities in which the head offices of the largest subsidiary bank, if any, or (sic ) an applicant and of each 
bank, shares of which are to be acquired, are located in the case of applications under section 3 of the Bank Holding Company

curtailment of any other procedural rule that might prevent immediate or expeditious action when appropriate.  The new 
regulation, which became effective upon its publication on January 21, 1981, provides as follows: Waiver.  The Board, or the officer or Reserve Bank authorized to approve an application, may waive or modify any procedural 
requirements for that application prescribed or cited in this section and may excuse any failure to comply with them upon a

during the preceding week by the Board or the Reserve Banks pursuant to delegated authority.  Notice of receipt of all section 3 
applications and of section 4(c)(8) applications acted upon by the Board is published in the Federal Register. HN16[
]  12 C.F.R. § 262.3(i)(1) (1980).  The precise meaning of this language is hard to determine, for these two short sentences are in some ways a paradigm of grammatical ambiguity.  The use of the phrase ""received and acted upon "" in the first 
sentence would seem to contemplate the issuance of such an identifying list only after a Board determination to grant or refuse 
an application that it had received.  It is unclear what, if any, connection there may be between the list that is referred to in the 
first sentence and the Federal Register publication that is referred to in the second sentence.  The second sentence could 
logically be read to mean that notice will be published in the Federal Register of the receipt of all applications made under either 
§ 3 or § 4(c)(8), but that such notice will be published only after such applications have been acted upon by the Board.  In this 
appeal, the Board has interpreted the second sentence to mean that notice will be published of the receipt of § 3 applications 
prior to a Board decision thereupon.  This interpretation is consistent with the regulation's predecessor, which more elegantly 
provided as follows: The Board issues each week a list that identifies holding company and merger applications received during the preceding week.  
Notice of receipt of each holding company application is published in the Federal Register. HN17[
]  12 C.F.R. § 262.3(f)(1) (1973). "
557,13," The regulation provides in pertinent part as follows: Submission of comments and requests for hearing.  The Board will consider a comment or request for hearing with respect to an 
application only if it is in writing and is sent to the Secretary of the Board or the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank on or before 
the date prescribed in the Federal Register notice with respect to applications under sections 3 or 4 of the Bank Holding 
Company Act or, in the case of other applications, the date specified in the newspaper notice with respect to such applications, 
or where no such date is prescribed, on or before the 13th day after the date such notice is first published Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, the Board may, in its sole discretion and without notifying the parties, take into consideration the substance of 
comments with respect to an application, (but not requests for hearing) that are not received within the time periods provided 
herein. HN18[
]  12 C.F.R. § 262.3(e) (1980) (second emphasis added).  This language cannot be said to impose a limit on the length of the comment period that may be specified in the Federal Register notice; rather, it merely provides that whatever comment 
period is specified will ordinarily be adhered to by the Board."
557,14," The text of the Federal Register notice provided as follows: Republic of Texas Corporation, Dallas, Texas, has applied for the Board's approval under section 3(a)(3) of the Bank Holding 
Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(3)) to acquire 100 per cent of the voting shares of The Citizens National Bank of Waco, Waco, 
Texas.  The factors that are considered in acting on the application are set forth in section 3(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1842(c)). The application may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governors or at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.  Any person 
wishing to comment on the application should submit views in writing to the Secretary, Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System, Washington, D.C. 20551, to be received not later than June 9, 1980.  Any comment on an application that "
558,," requests a hearing must include a statement of why a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying 
specifically any questions of fact that are in dispute and summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing."

558,17," A chief proponent of the 91-day rule gave the following testimony in the Senate committee hearing: Both the House Banking and Currency Committee and the House recognized that there had been undue delays in processing 
applications under section 4(c)(8) of the act.  To remedy this situation, H.R.6778 places a 90-day time limit on decisions 
regarding functionally related activities under section 4(c)(8) and eliminates the mandatory hearing requirement of that section.  
This 90-day limit is comparable to the 90-day time limit now required on applications under the Savings and Loan Holding 
Company Act (, 12 U.S.C. §§ 1730a(e)(1)(B), 1730a(e)(2) (1976)).  We believe that this time limit should also apply to 
applications to acquire banks pursuant to section 3 of the act.  The same reasons for a time limit apply to applications under both 
sections.  The new Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board has recognized this problem by administratively applying a 90-day 
time limit on all applications.  We applaud this action, but believe this mandate should be written into law. "

many applications, or that an application could be so complicated that the Federal Reserve Board couldn't meet a 90-day limit? Mr. WILKINSON.  There is always that possibility, but the Fed has has (sic ) a very effective, and sometimes we think when we 
are submitting an application, a very acute control on this, in that the application does not get a formal notice of receipt by them 
until it is cleaned up. Therefore, the 90 days doesn't start to run until they have it in clean form.  That helps them a lot. Senator BENNETT.  So, in fact, the Fed could not receive the application until it was ready to hand down the decision.  Is that 
what you are saying? Mr. WILKINSON.  Until it was ready to investigate at the Board level and felt all they had to do was deliberate and not hunt for 
additional facts and send it back. Id. at 961 (emphasis added)."
559,18," The First, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits have adverted to 91-day rules of §§ 3(b) and 4(c), but have not based a decision 
thereupon.  See Memphis Trust Co. v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 584 F.2d 921, 926 (6th Cir. 1978) 
(declining to reach bank holding company's argument that its § 4(c) (8) application had been granted by operation of § 4(c)""s 91-
day rule, because bank holding company had challenged Board's denial of application too late and in the wrong court);

Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 537 F.2d 1146, 1148 (1st Cir. 1976) (because bank had not participated in 
administrative proceedings before the Board on bank holding company's § 3 application to acquire it, bank was not a ""party 
aggrieved"" for purposes of 12 U.S.C. § 1848 (1976), and hence could not argue before court of appeals that bank holding 
company's application had been granted by operation of 91-day rule when bank holding company had not sought review of 
Board's denial of application). Most of the cases that deal directly with the 91-day rules are discussed in Annot., 38 A.L.R. Fed. 919 (1978 & 1980 Supp.)."
559,19," Section 4 of the Act, 12 U.S.C. § 1843 (1976 & Supp. III 1979) generally prohibits bank holding companies from engaging in 
nonbank activities through their subsidiaries unless they obtain approval of the Board to obtain or retain ownership or control of 
such companies.  Section 4(c) of the Act creates an important exception to this general prohibition; it provides in pertinent part 
as follows: The prohibitions in this section shall not apply to (8) shares of any company the activities of which the Board after due notice and opportunity for hearing has determined (by 
order or regulation) to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto In the event of the failure of the Board to act on any application for an order under paragraph (8) of this subsection within the 91-
day period which begins on the date of submission to the Board of the complete record on that application, the application shall

560,20, We amplify upon this holding below in parts III-B and III-C of this opinion.
560,21," We emphasize that we advance no views whatsoever as to whether either an unsolicited submission or a new submission 
made in response to a Board request would retrigger or toll the running of the 91-day period, assuming such submission was 
both necessary and noncumulative.  It may well be that different rules might apply depending on the nature of the submission: 
for example, it could be argued that the 91-day period should be tolled in the case of a Board request, retriggered in the case of 
an unsolicited submission by an applicant, and not affected at all by an untimely, unsolicited submission from some other party.  
We leave to another day the resolution of this complex issue. "
561,22," We do not read Citicorp as holding that the HN21[
] 91-day period always begins to run upon the expiration of the comment 
period, but instead as holding that the 91-day period cannot begin to run before the expiration of the comment period.  In the 
words of one commentator: The expiration date for public comment on an application does not mark the date of submission to the Board of a complete 
record. Often the record is supplemented thereafter by views of a State banking department or other supervisory authority, by 
additional information forwarded by the applicant (whether or not requested by the Board or its staff), by opponents to the 
application, or by a relevant court action. P. Heller, Handbook of Federal Bank Holding Company Law 326 (1976) (footnote omitted).  The Board apparently concurs in 
this view, according to a 1974 opinion letter: The (91-day rule) clearly is keyed to and relates to the date on which a complete record is forwarded to the Board.  On April 9, 
1973, the opportunity for public comment on FG's acquisition of Bank ended.  However, the record upon which the Board would 
base its ultimate judgment was not complete on that date.  It was supplemented by receipt of the written views of the U.S. 
Comptroller of the Currency and again by staff reports and recommendations as required by the Board To conclude that the 91-
day statutory period becomes operative at a date prior to the submission of all essential relevant information, as determined by 
the Board, would be to permit a bank holding company to nullify the prior approval requirements of the Act by its own inaction. Letter dated Feb. 27, 1974, from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to Counsel for Financial General

562,23," The North Lawndale court indicated that the Federal Register notice was published on January 26, 1976.  553 F.2d at 26. The 
court held, however, that the 91-day period had begun running on January 30, 1976, when the Board received the last 
submission from an outside source in response to a Board inquiry.  Id. at 27. Although the court did not indicate the length of the 
comment period set out in the Federal Register notice, it seems likely that it extended beyond January 30, 1976.  The North 
Lawndale court did note, however, that ""no adverse comments ensued"" from the published notice. Id. at 26. Although other 
Seventh Circuit cases mention that notice had been published in the Federal Register, none of them attach particular 
significance to this fact.  See First Lincolnwood, 546 F.2d at 720; Tri-State, 524 F.2d at 564. The Fourth Circuit in NCNB Corp. pointed out that there may be some inconsistency between Citicorp and the Seventh Circuit 
cases, 599 F.2d at 612, but was not compelled to choose between the two lines of cases, since it was able to base its decision

565,30," For example, a Reserve Bank would be guilty of undue delay were it to withhold transmission of an informationally complete,

Of course, insofar as the Reserve Banks can prepare such reports and recommendations during the cleaning up period, no such 
delay need occur."

567,32," United States v. Marine Bancorporation, Inc., 418 U.S. 602, 630, 94 S. Ct. 2856, 2874, 41 L. Ed. 2d 978 (1974). The Marine 
Bancorporation Court, the Mercantile court, and the Board have from time to time referred to this issue as being simply a 
question of market concentration, rather than oligopolistic market performance.  This mode of reference may be convenient, but 
it is also somewhat misleading.  In theory, a market in which there are only two competitors i. e., a market with a two-firm 
concentration ratio of 100% may be fiercely competitive.  By the same token, a market with fifteen competitors, each of whom 
account for an equal portion of the market, may behave oligopolistically. As one district court has noted, (t)here is no automatic, direct relationship between a particular concentration ratio and the competitive performance in any 
particular banking market; concentration ratios based on commercial bank deposits are useful only as a starting point of 
analysis.  From this initial analysis, one must thereafter study actual performance of market participants to determine the 
competitiveness of the market. United States v. First National State Bancorporation, 499 F. Supp. 793, 805 (D.N.J.1980) (footnotes omitted).  Accordingly, for 
purposes of this opinion we will eschew the shorthand description of an oligopolistic market as being simply a ""concentrated"" 
market."
567,33," We recognize that there is a pronounced air of fantasy inherent in any attempt to define ""a market"" for purposes of measuring 
anticompetitive effects of an acquisition. Traditional market share analysis is premised on defining the set of firms who compete 
actively with one another in an attempt to sell goods or services.  That analysis, however, fails totally to take notice of certain 
indisputable economic realities.  If the ""relevant market"" is defined solely by reference to the type of products or services offered 
by, and the geographic location of, a particular set of firms, the defined ""market"" will inevitably exclude certain firms who, for at 
least for some potential customers, are real competitors of the firms included in the defined market. Consider, for example, the choices offered to a small family living in Waco that wishes to accumulate a ""nest egg"" for retirement.  
For such a potential consumer of investment services, to whom security and ease of access may be the most important 
considerations, local commercial banks, savings and loan associations, and credit unions may all be real competitors of one 
another; but commercial banks, savings and loan associations, and credit unions that are located in Dallas or New York may not 
be competing for this family's business.  Therefore, if one defines the relevant product market to include only commercial banks, 
one ignores the fact that the defined product market does not truly represent the competitive choices available to this consumer 
of goods and services, even if the geographic limitation does make sense as to this consumer. By contrast, savings and loan associations and credit unions may not be in legitimate competition for the patronage of a small, 
strictly local business that seeks a short-term loan to cover inventory additions; with respect to this consumer, a market defined 
to comprise only Waco commercial banks may be eminently sensible.  But with respect to the business of a larger consumer e. "
568,," g., a Waco branch of a state-wide, multistate, or multinational corporation it may be that commercial banks in Dallas, New York, 
or even Zurich are real competitors. For this consumer, then, the defined product market would make sense, but the defined 
geographic market would be senseless.  See generally Markovits, Monopolistic Competition, Second Best, and the Antitrust 
Paradox, 77 Mich.L.Rev. 567, 609-13 (1979); Markovits, Predicting the Competitive Impact of Horizontal Mergers in a 
Monopolistically Competitive World: A Non-Market-Oriented Proposal and Critique of the Market Definition-Market Share-Market 
Concentration Approach, 56 Texas L.Rev. 587, 593-603 (1978). For all its flaws, however, market share analysis is firmly entrenched in American antitrust law, and indeed, in bank merger law.  
See note 37 infra.  Alternative modes of analyzing the legality of mergers under § 7 of the Clayton Act, such as those proposed 
by Professor Markovits and others, may have considerable merit, and may not be altogether foreclosed by existing precedent; 
yet we cannot pass upon such alternate theories in the abstract.  The record in the case at bar apparently was developed wholly 
for purposes of traditional market share analysis; accordingly, this is a poor case in which to blaze new trails of antitrust theory, 
and we decline to do so."
568,34," Commercial bank deposits can, at best, measure but one aspect of the competition between commercial banks.  See notes 
32 & 33 supra.  Nonetheless, the use of commercial bank deposit ratios in establishing a prima facie case that a commercial 
banking market is performing oligopolistically has been sanctioned by the Supreme Court in the Marine Bancorporation case."
568,35," Republic argues that the four-firm concentration ratio of 72.4% is of insufficient magnitude to support a prima facie case of 
oligopolistic behavior, citing Marine Bancorporation, 418 U.S. at 631, 94 S. Ct. at 2874 (three-firm ratio of 92.3%); United States 
v. First National State Bancorporation, 499 F. Supp. 793, 804 (D.N.J.1980) (four-firm concentration ratios of 87.7% and 86.4%); 
and United States v. First National Bancorporation, Inc., 329 F. Supp. 1003, 1008 (D.Colo.1971) (three-firm ratio of over 90%), 
aff'd per curiam by an equally divided court, 410 U.S. 577, 93 S. Ct. 1434, 35 L. Ed. 2d 507 (1973). The Mercantile court, 
however, found a four-firm concentration ratio of 73.8% in the Waco market to be sufficient to establish a prima facie case of 
oligopolistic market performance, relying on 5 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law P 1119 (1980) (recommending 65% 
minimum four-firm concentration ratio when the eight largest firms control at least 90% of the market).  We, of course, are not 
free to reconsider or overrule a prior decision of a panel of this court.  E. g., In re Corrugated Container Antitrust Litigation, 647 
F.2d 460, 461 (5th Cir. 1981); Ellis v. Great Southwestern Corp., 646 F.2d 1099, 1109 (5th Cir. 1981); Branch v. Phillips 
Petroleum Co., 638 F.2d 873, 877 (5th Cir. 1981). We do not read Mercantile as carving into stone the recommendations of 
Professors Areeda and Turner on this point; wherever the line is ultimately to be drawn, however, we feel sure that it will not be 
between 73.8% and 72.4%."
568,36," Republic makes the same argument here.  As in Mercantile, however, the evidence shows that the Waco banking market is 
deconcentrating but does not show that it is deconcentrated; neither does it display the ""clear trend to deconcentration"" required 
by the Mercantile court. "
569,37," Of course, numerous Supreme Court opinions in addition to Marine Bancorporation have treated the cluster of products and 
services that commercial banks offer as a unique and distinct line of commerce for Clayton Act purposes.  E. g., United States v. 
Connecticut Nat'l Bank, 418 U.S. 656, 663, 94 S. Ct. 2788, 2793, 41 L. Ed. 2d 1016 (1974); United States v. Phillipsburg Nat'l 
Bank & Trust Co., 399 U.S. 350, 359-60, 90 S. Ct. 2035, 2041-42, 26 L. Ed. 2d 658 (1970); United States v. Philadelphia Nat'l 
Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 355-57, 83 S. Ct. 1715, 1737-38, 10 L. Ed. 2d 915 (1963)."
569,38," Republic also directs us to the Marine Bancorporation Court's recognition that due to the nature of this highly regulated 
industry, ""all banking markets in the country are likely to be concentrated."" 418 U.S. at 632, 94 S. Ct. at 2875 (emphasis in 
original).  The Marine Bancorporation Court also pointed out, however, that ""the same factor that usually renders such markets 
concentrated and theoretical prospects for potential-competition § 7 cases regulatory barriers to new entry will also make it 
difficult to establish that the doctrine invalidates a particular geographic market extenstion merger."" Id. "
570,39," In one sentence, without any further discussion or analysis, the Board also found that ""consummation of (Republic's) proposal 
would also eliminate the present procompetitive effect (Republic) exerts as a result of its position as a perceived potential entrant 
into the market."" Arguably, this constitutes a finding that Republic's proposed acquisition of CNB would violate § 7 of the Clayton 
Act under the ""perceived potential competition"" theory, which was discussed briefly by the Mercantile court, 638 F.2d at 1264, 
but not relied upon by the Board in that case.  The Board's conclusory statement, however, is unquestionably an insufficient 
basis for meaningful judicial review. The perceived potential competition branch of the potential competition doctrine was accepted by the Supreme Court in United 
States v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., 410 U.S. 526, 93 S. Ct. 1096, 35 L. Ed. 2d 475 (1973), but its application to the banking 
industry was sharply qualified by the Supreme Court's later opinion in Marine Bancorporation.  The Marine Bancorporation Court 
recognized that in Falstaff, ""the Court ha(d) interpreted § 7 as encompassing what is commonly known as the ""wings effect' the 
probability that the acquiring firm prompted premerger procompetitive effects within the target market by being perceived by the 
existing firms in that market as likely to enter de novo."" 418 U.S. at 625, 94 S. Ct. at 2871. But the Court emphasized that ""the 
application of the doctrine to commercial banking must take into account the unique federal and state regulatory restraints on 
entry into that line of commerce."" 418 U.S. at 627, 94 S. Ct. at 2872. The perceived potential competition doctrine and the actual potential competition doctrine share some elements.  Neither theory 
can apply to nonoligopolistic markets.  The commercial bank deposit ratios of the Waco market established a prima facie case 
that the Waco banking market is performing oligopolistically, and Republic failed to rebut that prima facie case; see the 
discussion above in part IV-B-1 of this opinion.  This finding, which we have determined is supported by substantial evidence, is 
adequate for both theories.  Similarly, both the perceived potential competition theory and the actual potential competition theory 
require a finding as to other potential entrants who may be ""waiting in the wings."" See Falstaff, 410 U.S. at 534 n.13, 93 S. Ct. at 
1101 n.13; FTC v. Procter & Gamble Co., 386 U.S. 568, 581, 87 S. Ct. 1224, 1231, 18 L. Ed. 2d 303 (1967). For purposes of the 
perceived potential competition theory, the Board's finding on such other potential entrants is inadequate for precisely the same 
reasons expressed above in part IV-B-2 of this opinion. "
571,," In addition to these two elements, the perceived potential competition theory can be applied only if ""the acquiring firm has the 
characteristics, capabilities, and economic incentive to render it a perceived potential de novo entrant, and if the acquiring firm's 
premerger presence on the fringe of the market in fact tempered oligopolistic behavior on the part of existing participants in that 
market."" Marine Bancorporation, 418 U.S. at 624-25, 94 S. Ct. at 2871-72. While the Board's findings are arguably adequate as 
to Republic's ability and incentive to enter the Waco market independently, and are arguably supported by substantial evidence 
on that point, the Board's order fails completely to consider how Republic was perceived by banks in Waco, and more important 
how that perception might have tempered their oligopolistic behavior. Accordingly, the perceived potential competition theory cannot serve as a basis for affirming the Board's order in this case.  As 
with the actual potential competition theory discussed above in text, we will give the Board the opportunity to reconsider and to 
make more thorough findings on the perceived potential competition theory on remand. "

because, for example, plaintiff did not allege injury to competition)."
582,4," The district court's opinion might be read as a dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted -- a 
decision on the merits.  Such a decision, however, would be premature.  Plaintiffs have not yet, for example, had an opportunity 
to show that the provisions of article 17 are unduly injurious to competition and therefore unreasonable restrains of trade under 
sec. 1. See Newburger, Loeb & Co. v. Gross, 563 F.2d 1057, 1082 (2d Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1035, 98 S.Ct. 769, 54

583,5," The full text of section 26 is as follows: Any person, firm, corporation, or association shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief, in any court of the United 
States having jurisdiction over the parties, against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws, including 
sections 13, 14, 18, and 19 of this title, when and under the same conditions and principles as injunctive relief against 
threatened conduct that will cause loss or damage is granted by courts of equity, under the rules governing such proceedings, 
and upon the execution of proper bond against damages for an injunction improvidently granted and a showing that the danger 
of irreparable loss or damage is immediate, a preliminary injunction may issue: Provided, That nothing herein contained shall be 
construed to entitle any person, firm, corporation, or association, except the United States, to bring suit in equity for injunctive 
relief against any common carrier subject to the provisions of the Act to regulate commerce, approved February fourth, eighteen 
hundred and eighty-seven, in respect of any matter subject to the regulation, supervision, or other jurisdiction of the Interstate 
Commerce Commission. "
590,1," The ""derivative"" claim is that, ""by reason of the said acts alleged and committed by the defendants against her husband, as set 
forth therein, and the false statements made by them concerning him, and the effects thereof upon her husband, she has 
suffered, and will suffer, embarrassment, humiliation and ridicule, great mental anguish and distress; that her companionship, 
comfort and happiness with him and in their living together and in their society, have been, and will be, impaired, and she has 
been, and will be, deprived thereof, as the natural and proximate result of the said acts of the defendants against her husband; 
and that such embarrassment and deprivation of the companionship and society of and with her husband and the effect upon 
her mental feelings will long continue, all to her great injury, suffering and damage."" Amended Complaint, Count VIII. Since the 
Owens concede that this count must rise or fall with the antitrust claim, we have no occasion to consider whether, even if we 
were to reverse the dismissal of Counts I and II, the quoted allegations state a claim for relief under Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 
15 U.S.C. § 15 (anyone injured ""in his business or property … may sue therefor ….""). "
591,2," Aetna has moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the notice of appeal was untimely filed. This motion must be 
denied. Aetna's claim of untimeliness hinges on its contention that the July 25, 1979 order granting summary judgment to Aetna 
was final and thus appealable at that time. However, a cross-claim by Aetna against the New Jersey Medical Society for 
contribution or indemnity remained outstanding until August 13, 1979. Thus, under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b), the July 25 order was a 
judgment as to ""fewer than all of the claims or parties,"" and, absent certification, was not appealable until August 13, 1979 when 
Judge Fisher filed an additional order dismissing the action after noting that the outstanding cross-claim had been withdrawn. 
We recognize that as a practical matter Aetna's pending cross-claim for contribution/indemnity became groundless once Aetna's 
motion for summary judgment was granted. However, to read ""practicalities"" into the already plain language of Rule 54(b) would 
only foster uncertainty in an area of the law that must remain clear. In Knox v. United States Lines Co. v. T. Hogan Corp., 294 
F.2d 354 (3d Cir. 1961), we considered whether an outstanding motion for a new trial by defendant for indemnity against a third 
party defendant, filed as a protective measure in the event the court granted plaintiff's motion for a new trial in the principal 
action, deprived us of appellate jurisdiction when the denial of plaintiff's motion for a new trial was appealed. Despite our 
realization that once judgment was entered for defendant the third-party claim for indemnity was groundless, we held that the 
outstanding motion rendered the judgment on plaintiff's motion unappealable and dismissed the appeal. Although in Knox the 
order was referred to as nonfinal, a more precise description of its status is final but not appealable. See Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. 
General Electric Co., 446 U.S. 1, 7-8, 100 S. Ct. 1460, 1464-1465, 64 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1980). In any event, Owens was not remiss in 
waiting until all the pending claims were resolved before filing the notice of appeal."
591,3," All defendants except the Aetna Defendants have been dismissed on the basis of a settlement with Owens the details of which 
do not appear of record. "
593,4," Until recently that was the course followed in New Jersey with respect to automobile liability insurance. See N.J.A.C. 11:3-1.6. 
Risks were classified, however, and disparities in rates were permitted based on such factors as age, sex, and place of 
residence. Recently the Commissioner adopted regulations eliminating those rate disparities, thus maximizing the universe of 
insureds. That action is challenged in a pending lawsuit brought by the Insurance Service Office, a rating bureau, and five 
independent insurance companies. See The Newark Star Ledger, May 27, 1981, § 1, at 1, col. 4-6. "
595,5," See, e.g., Group Life & Health Insurance Co. v. Royal Drug Co., 440 U.S. 205, 231, 99 S. Ct. 1067, 1083, 59 L. Ed. 2d 261 
(1979); Consolidated Express Inc. v. New York Shipping Association, 602 F.2d 494, 513 n.17 (3d Cir. 1979). "
596,6," Agreements regarding agents' commissions are not at issue in this case. Cf.  Group Life & Health Ins. Co. v. Royal Drug Co., 
440 U.S. 205, 224 n.32, 99 S. Ct. 1067, 1080 n.32, 59 L. Ed. 2d 261 (1979). "
599,7," The letter reads: Several years ago, an Aetna team was formed to study the Professional Liability situation and it was the conclusion and 
recommendation of this team that the only way to profitably approach Professional Liability business would be through the strong 
endorsement of a state medical society and the commitment of that medical society to a Loss Control & Education Program. Aetna is experimenting with the state medical society endorsement approach in eight states and although we are not prepared at 
this time to say that this is the answer, we are encouraged by the results. Many state medical societies have endorsed or sponsored other insurance carriers for Professional Liability insurance. Since we 
will not be writing this coverage, and if you have no other market, you are aware that the doctors can place their coverage 
through the society's sponsored carrier. This would be no different than coverages some insureds of yours have which are now 
placed through specialty markets but you are still able to retain the rest of the account. (JA 31). "
601,8," Owens also finds support for his market division claim in the deposition testimony of Bruce Mahon, subpoenaed by 
defendants. Mahon gathered from conversations with Hansen, the Vice President of Aetna, that Aetna and other carriers had 
decided that the only way malpractice insurance could survive was for one carrier to be sponsored by the Medical Society, and they would take that and go out and somebody else in another State 
take another State. They could not compete and survive in the market. (JA 223-24). Mahon's observation is based, however, on vague, equivocal recollections of hearsay statements, which, by 
themselves, cannot justify putting these parties to the expense of a full-blown trial. At best, the deposition suggests only that 
certain unidentified major insurance companies were concerned about the malpractice problem and that they together, or Aetna 
alone, had discussed it with the New Jersey Commissioner of Insurance: Q Was there any statement by Mr. Hansen at the meeting that you attended in Hartford, Mr. Mahon, concerning when a meeting 
or discussion had taken place between him on the one hand and representatives of other insurance companies on the other 
hand concerning A If there were, I don't remember. Q What did he say, if anything, about the identity of the other insurance companies? A Well, he did mention them, but that was of little interest to me at the time. All I can remember is they liked four or five top 
malpractice writers because at that time there were not many people writing malpractice. Q Did he indicate there were any discussions with the Commissioner of Insurance? A He said they were discussions right at that time with the Commissioner of Insurance of New Jersey malpractice problems and 
about rates and prices, yes. Q And the fact that only one could survive? A With the Commissioner, you mean? Q Yes. A I don't know. That I don't remember. All I know is that they all had problems, and as an industry they felt the solution was 
either no business or you had to be exclusive in the market. (JA 226-27). Such testimony does not, alone, support an allegation that Aetna and Chubb engaged in a secret, naked 
agreement to divide markets, and, if anything, suggests that their response to the malpractice crisis proceeded through 
regulatory channels. "
602,9," A subsidiary aspect of Owens' boycott claim is that Aetna and the Britton Agency conspired to print an article in the New 
Jersey Medical Society's newsletter disparaging Owens' attempts to form a competing physicians group, the A.P.E.D., through 
which to provide an alternative insurance plan. The article was allegedly for the purpose, and had the effect, of deterring Medical 
Society members from doing business with Owens. Appellant's Brief at 28. The record evidence relied upon fails, however, to 
link these publications to Aetna. The only meetings between Britton Agency and Aetna disclosed on the record were for 
unrelated, legitimate purposes. (JA 440)."

708-709, 3 L. Ed. 2d 741 (1959). On the other hand, HN20[

there is no purpose to create a monopoly, nor any unreasonable restraint of trade.  Packard Motor Car Co. v. Webster Motor Car 
Co., 100 U.S. App. D.C. 161, 243 F.2d 418 (D.C.Cir.1957). If there is, an exclusive agency arguably might offend federal 
antitrust law in the absence of evidence that it had the consent of state regulators. "

Carroll, Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There 124, reprinted in Journeys in Wonderland (Derrydale 1979). 
(emphasis in original). "
604,2," Several courts of appeals have been careful to note that they will refrain from affirming the grant of summary judgment on a 
ground not relied upon by the district court unless the non-moving party has had fair opportunity to contest that ground before 
the appellate court.  E. g., Charbonnages DeFrance v. Smith, 597 F.2d 406, 416 & n.9 (4th Cir. 1979); Paskaly v. Seale, 506 
F.2d 1209, 1211 n.4 (9th Cir. 1974). See also Yale v. National Indemnity Co., 602 F.2d 642, 650 n.18 (4th Cir. 1979); Lee Moore 
Oil Co. v. Union Oil Co., 599 F.2d 1299, 1307 (4th Cir. 1979). "
605,3," The Table of Contents of Aetna's Memorandum in the District Court serves to summarize its claim. The relevant excerpt is as 
follows:IV. PLAINTIFF'S CLAIM IN COUNT ONE OF AN AGREEMENT TO DIVIDE MARKETS FOR INSURANCE CANNOT BE 
MAINTAINED AS A MATTER OF LAW A. Plaintiff's Claim of division of Markets is Barred by the McCarran-Ferguson Act"
605,1," . The challenged conduct involves ""the business of insurance"""
605,2, . The challenged conduct is regulated by the State of New Jersey
605,3," . Aetna's alleged action is not a ""boycott"" and therefore does not come within the exception to the McCarran-Ferguson 
exemption B. Plaintiff Lacks Standing to Bring an Antitrust Claim on Allegations of Market Division"
605,1," . Plaintiff is not within the ""target area"" of an agreement to divide markets"
605,2," . The incidental injury to plaintiff did not occur ""by reason of"" that which makes the alleged conduct (a division of markets) 
unlawful"
605,3, . The circumstances of plaintiff's business establish that any injury to him was remote and indirect.
605,4," Among the materials supporting Owens' claim of a conspiracy to divide the markets is the deposition testimony of Bruce 
Mahon, President of the McCay Corporation. Mahon testified regarding a meeting between himself and several Aetna 
representatives, including Robert Hanson, the Vice President of Aetna: Q Was any mention made with respect to any other insurance carriers at that meeting? A Yes, it all got into a long discussion concerning malpractice and Bob Hanson said that really the only way there is no solution 
they could see to our problem because the only solution in malpractice would be to have the insurance companies for instance, 
when you have the State Medical Society, if they would insure them as a group, that is what one company like what's-its-name 
does in Jersey that handles the malpractice now. Q Yes? A I have a blank on it, but Aetna would say, take Hartford or they would take Texas and somebody would take another State, so 
that is the only way they could survive in a malpractice business by strictly having one carrier in each State. Q Did Mr. Hanson or Mr. Shipps or anyone else present at that meeting state that they had ever met with any other insurance 
company in order to discuss the New Jersey malpractice market? A Yes, they had met to discuss New Jersey, and I forget, a couple of other States that were having severe problems, too. Q Who said that? "
606,," A Mr. Hanson. Q Did he say who he met with? A I am trying to think, and I will think in a minute of the company that handles New Jersey's Medical Association. Maybe you can 
help me with the name. Q Chubb & Son? A Correct, Chubb & Son. Q What did he say with respect to Chubb? A The answer would be Chubb would handle New Jersey because they already have the Medical Society as a group. Q Did he say there had been meetings between Aetna and Chubb with respect to that? A They had meetings with respect to malpractice. Q Chubb and Aetna, representatives of Chubb and Aetna? A Yes, and other major malpractice carriers. Q Do you recall if Mr. Hanson made any statements to the effect that a number of insurance companies had decided to ""whack 
up"" the market? A I think they had decided I don't know if I use those same words, but I think they decided that the only way you can do it is for 
one carrier to be sponsored by the Medical Society, and they would take that and go out and somebody else in another State 
take another State. They could not compete and survive in the market. (JA 221-224). In addition, the record contains an affidavit of Eugene J. Cudworth, a former employee of ""The Hartford"" group of 
insurance companies, which states that: principal insurers of physicians malpractice had decided and planned that the most profitable way of underwriting that line was to 
maximize state medical society group-sponsored business on a state-by-state basis. One designated carrier would provide the 
protection in a designated state such as Aetna in Connecticut or Chubb in New Jersey, etc. (emphasis added). (JA 61) Summary judgment is appropriate only when, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, the 
court can conclude that ""it is quite clear what the truth is, that no genuine issue remains for trial."" Poller v. Columbia 
Broadcasting System, Inc., 368 U.S. 464, 472-73, 82 S. Ct. 486, 490-491, 7 L. Ed. 2d 458 (1962); Sartor v. Arkansas Natural 
Gas Corp., 321 U.S. 620, 627, 64 S. Ct. 724, 728, 88 L. Ed. 967 (1944). The courts have been particularly cautious in granting 
summary judgment in antitrust cases, such as the instant one, where ""motive or intent play leading roles"" and ""proof is largely in 
the hands of the alleged conspirators."" Poller, supra, 368 U.S. at 473, 82 S. Ct. at 491. See Larry V. Muko, Inc. v. Southwestern 
Pennsylvania Building and Construction Trades Council, 609 F.2d 1368 (3d Cir. 1979) (en banc). When the record in its present 
state is tested against this strict standard, it cannot be said that there is not a genuine dispute as to whether Aetna and Chubb 
entered into a conspiracy to divide markets. "
608,5," It has been suggested that Congress may have overreacted to the South-Eastern Underwriters decision because a business' 
engagement in interstate commerce does not cripple the states' basic ability to tax and regulate. See Sullivan & Wiley, Recent 
Antitrust Developments: Defining the Scope of Exemptions, Expanding Coverage, and Refining the Rule of Reason, 27 U.C.L.A. 
L.Rev. 265, 270-72 (1979)."
608,6," See generally, Carlson, The Insurance Exemption from the Antitrust Laws, 57 Texas L.Rev. 1127, 1128-39 (1979)."
608,7," The dissent relied on the same legislative history to conclude that Congress deliberately chose to phrase the exemption 
broadly.  Royal Drug, 440 U.S. at 234-35, 99 S. Ct. at 1084-1085. (Brennan J., dissenting). The major thrust of the dissent was 
its disagreement with the majority's holding that no provider agreement can be considered part of the ""business of insurance."" 
The dissent would have held that ""some kind of provider agreement becomes a necessity if a service-benefits insurer is to meet 
its obligations to the insureds,"" id. at 246, 99 S. Ct. at 1090 (emphasis in original), and that the close nexus between the 
Pharmacy Agreements and both the rates and fiscal reliability of Blue Shield's plan warranted their inclusion within the ""business 
of insurance."" Id. at 250, 99 S. Ct. at 1092. As will be developed in the text, this difference between the majority and dissent is 
not relevant to the legal issue in this case. "
609,8," The other component of the industry writes life and health insurance. See generally U.S. Department of Justice, The Pricing 
and Marketing of Insurance (1977) (hereafter Dept. of Justice Study); National Commission for the Review of the Antitrust Laws 
and Procedures, Report to the President and the Attorney General 225-251 (1979) (hereafter Report to the President ). "
610,9," The information and risk problems faced by life and health insurance companies are apparently less severe than those of the 
property-liability companies. As a result, life-health insurers have generally not engaged in extensive cooperative activities, such 
as rating bureaus, but there is cooperation with respect to the formation of mortality tables. Report to the President, supra, at 
228; Dept. of Justice Study, supra, at 277."
610,10," Usually the syndicate issues a single policy on a risk in the name of all the members of the pool, with each member sharing in 
the premiums and losses on a predetermined basis. Liability of the participants may be either several or joint and several. Dept. 
of Justice Study, supra, at 210-213. Pooling or joint underwriting associations can also result from state legislation, intended to 
remedy perceived problems in either the availability or price of certain types of insurance. Illustrative are assigned risk plans 
under which insurers selling auto insurance in the state have been compelled to provide automobile insurance for high risk 
drivers unable to obtain insurance in the voluntary market. Hanson, supra, at 805. More recently, as a result of the medical 
malpractice insurance crises many states required all insurers writing liability insurance in the state to be a member of a joint 
underwriting association which would write malpractice insurance in the event it was no longer available on a voluntary basis. Id. 
at 805-06. Dept. of Justice Study, supra, at 210."
610,11," The primary insurer (reinsured) may share the risk on a pro rata or ""excess of loss"" basis. Under the pro rata method, the 
reinsurer agrees to accept a fixed percentage of the gross writings of the reinsured. Under the ""excess of loss"" basis the 
reinsurer agrees to indemnify the reinsured for any losses in excess of some specified amount. A reinsurance arrangement 
differs from a placement in that in a placement there are separate contracts between the insured and insurer, while in a "
611,," reinsurance arrangement the contract is between the primary insurer and the reinsurer. Dept. of Justice Study, supra, at 205-
209."
611,12," Sullivan and Wiley suggest that the need for price-fixing through rating bureaus may be overrated, and point to the action of 
sixteen states which ""have replaced the older, cartel-protecting regulatory regimes with so-called ""open competition' laws that 
prohibit industry agreements to enforce bureau rates and give individual companies freedom to set their own prices."" Sullivan & 
Wiley, supra, 27 U.C.L.A.L.Rev. at 272."
611,13," See note 7 supra. Justice Brennan, dissenting in Royal Drug, contended that the ""business of insurance"" must be interpreted 
to connote not only risk underwriting but also contracts closely related thereto, which would include ""agreements (which) 
themselves perform an important insurance function."" 440 U.S. at 251, 99 S. Ct. at 1093. The majority appeared to have rejected 
this functional approach when it stated that ""it does not follow that because an agreement is necessary to provide insurance, it is 
also the ""business of insurance.' "" Id. at 213-14 n.9, 99 S. Ct. at 1074 n.9. "
612,14," The NAIC proposal provided: On and after July 1, 1948, the said Sherman Act shall not apply (1) to any agreement or concerted or cooperative action which 
prescribes the use of rates for insurance, insurance policy or bond forms or underwriting rules or plans if such rates, forms, 
rules, or plans are required, by the law of the State in which they are to be used, either to be approved by the supervisory official 
or agency of such State having authority with respect thereto, or to be filed subject to disapproval by such official or agency; (2) 
to the use of any such rates, forms, rules, or plans which have been so approved or filed; (3) to any cooperative or joint service, 
adjustment, investigation, or inspection agreement relating to insurance, or to acts under such agreements; (4) to any agreement

627,8," .  The doctrine of passing-on refers to the process whereby a member of the distributive chain who has been overcharged (or 
even undercharged) adjusts its prices to reflect that overcharge (or undercharge).  See In Re Beef Industry Antitrust Litigation,

629,11," .  See Beane, Passing-on Revived: An Antitrust Dilemma, 32 Baylor L.Rev. 347, 353 (1980). This analysis assumes the 
unlikely fact that the indirect purchaser would be able to prove that the entire overcharge was passed on to it by the retailer-
middleman."
629,12," .  Mr. Justice Brennan in his dissent argued that the need for symmetry was superficial at best, as the ""interests at stake"" in 
offensive and defensive passing-on situations are in fact quite different.  Offensive passing-on promotes compensation; 
defensive promotes escape from liability.  A recent district court decision has expressed some agreement with the Brennan 
rationale.  Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 486 F. Supp. 115, 118 fn.1 (D.Minn.1980). "
630,13," .  The commentators have suggested that passed-on overcharges could be calculated through use of the economic analysis 
commonly applies to excise taxes.  Posner, Economic Analysis of Law, 509-514 (1977); Schaefer, Passing-On Theory in 
Antitrust Treble Damage Actions: An Economic and Legal Analysis, 16 Wm. & Mary L.Rev. 883, 887-97 (1975). However, it has 
been suggested that ""it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine with reasonable certainty the facts needed to apply this 
analysis."" Note, Scaling The Illinois Brick Wall, supra, at 312.  Further, the Supreme Court in Illinois Brick expressly rejected the 
use of economic models to calculate passed-on damages."
630,14," .  This Court further believes it highly unlikely that the Illinois Brick Court would have attempted to list in the text of the Opinion 
each and every circumstance where an exception to the rule would be warranted.  Such a listing, in no way compelled by the 
Illinois Brick facts, would have been an inefficient exercise of judicial effort and, of course, dicta.  Rather, this Court believes that 
the Supreme Court in Illinois Brick listed exceptions as a guide to the lower courts in determining the types of circumstances 
where application of the rule would not be required. "

bite the bullet and label the instant distributor/dealer conspiracy a vertical one.  For purposes of this Opinion, the Court will 
identify plaintiffs' proposed exception as the ""co-conspirator"" rather than the ""vertical"" exception, in that the correct definition of 
the alleged conspiracy has not been fully briefed by the parties.  However, it is clear that in order to recover under this exception, 
the plaintiffs must prove the existence of a voluntary conspiracy between actors on both levels of the distributive chain. See 
infra. "
633,19," .  While the Columbia Nitrogen court did express the view that the five Perma Life Justices discussing the general applicability 
of the in pari delicto defense suggested that the doctrine apply in antitrust cases ""when parties of substantially equal economic 
strength "" participate in a conspiracy, that conclusion does not appear to have limited the Fourth Circuit's rule quoted above.  
Further, the Perma Life Opinions do not, to this Court, appear to mandate such a limitation.  See Abraham Construction Corp.,

tougher than they had been since 1911 and not wait for a showing of power aggressively used, or even for a showing that 
structural change would inevitably do injury to the competitive process.  It wanted the courts to act at the edge of harm in order 
to choke off those mergers likely alone or as part of a merger movement to cause irreversible injury to the competitive process. L. Sullivan, Antitrust § 199, at 592-93 (1977). "

665,1," .  Defendants Aetna and California Casualty did not use drive-in claim centers during 1971-75, the period of time covered by this 
lawsuit."
665,2, .  This practice was apparently engaged in by all defendants to this action. 
666,3," .  Defendant Liberty Mutual has a policy of not negotiating with shops. Moreover, the declaration testimony of plaintiffs Chavez 
and Hebert revealed that the defendants who did negotiate did so with varying degrees of flexibility."
666,4, .  The affidavits submitted by defendants CSAA and Travelers reveal that they do not maintain a list of shops.
666,5," .  The affidavits submitted by the parties revealed that GEICO and Aetna did not develop surveys but instead prepare estimates 
solely on the basis of the adjuster's knowledge of the market. Moreover, the evidence disclosed the defendants CSAA, California 
Casualty, Aetna and Travelers generally wrote estimates at the repairing shop's rates. CSAA, for example, apparently often 
estimated only the hours required to perform a particular repair and let the shop fill in its hourly rate. "
667,6," .  California Casualty, however, submitted no evidence from which this court could conclude, beyond a doubt, that it has no 
substantial impact upon interstate commerce. Thus, even though California Casualty appears to be a California corporation, we 
decline to grant summary judgment on the jurisdictional issue. "
668,7," .  Also potentially dispositive of this lawsuit before reaching the actual substance of plaintiffs' claims is the ""business of 
insurance"" exception of the McCarran-Ferguson Act. The relevant portion of that act reads: (After) June 30, 1948, … the Sherman Act, and … the Clayton Act, and … the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, 
shall be applicable to the business of insurance to the extent that such business is not regulated by State law. (emphasis 
added). Further, section 1013(b) provides that ""(n)othing contained in this chapter shall render the said Sherman Act inapplicable to any 
agreement to boycott, coerce, or intimidate, or act of boycott, coercion or intimidation."" In the September 1976 Order, we held that all criteria had been met and that the challenged activities were therefore exempt 
from antitrust scrutiny. We stated: We find that the activities of which plaintiffs complain are the business of insurance and are regulated by state law and thus are 
exempt from the federal antitrust laws under the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1011-1014 (string cite omitted). 
Furthermore, defendants' alleged practices do not fall within the McCarran Act exception, § 1013(b), regarding boycotting, 
coercion, or intimidation. This exception has been consistently construed narrowly so as not to encompass defendants' alleged 
activities. (string cites omitted.) It was this portion of the opinion which the Ninth Circuit addressed when it remanded the case in light of two intervening 
Supreme Court decisions. The Ninth Circuit believed that Royal Drug, supra, and St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co., supra, 
appeared ""to have a direct impact upon important issues in this case relating to whether agreements between an insurer and a 
service provider come within the ""business of insurance' under the McCarran-Ferguson Act.  15 U.S.C. §§ 1011-1014."" In Royal Drug, the narrow issue before the Supreme Court was whether the provider agreements between a single insurance 
company, Blue Shield, and certain pharmacies constituted the business of insurance. In concluding that Pharmacy provider 
agreements were not the business of insurance, the court reasoned that the primary elements of insurance contracts are the 
spreading and underwriting of the policyholder's risk. ""The Pharmacy agreements,"" the Court stated, ""do not involve any 
underwriting of risk, but are merely arrangements for the purchase of goods and services."" 440 U.S. at 214, 99 S. Ct. at 1075. Another line of reasoning in Royal Drug stemmed from the legislative intent underlying the McCarran-Ferguson Act. After 
examining numerous statements of legislators, the Court found the primary concern of both representatives of the insurance 
industry and Congress to be ""that cooperative ratemaking efforts be exempt from antitrust laws."" 440 U.S. at 221, 99 S. Ct. at 
1078 (emphasis added.) In defining the legislative intent, the Court relied heavily on a report of the National Association of 
Insurance Commissions. This report concluded: For these and other reasons this subcommittee believes it would be a mistake to permit or require the unrestricted competition 
contemplated by the antitrust laws to apply to the insurance business. To prohibit combined efforts for statistical and rate-making 
purposes would be a backward step in the development of a progressive business…. Congress itself recently recognized the 
necessity for concert of action in the collection of statistical data and rate making…. N.A.I.C. report, quoted at 440 U.S. 221-22, 99 S. Ct. at 1078 (emphasis in Supreme Court opinion.) Thus, the Court held that the inter-industry Pharmacy Agreements, which in no way constituted rate-making agreements, were 
not intended by Congress to bask in the McCarran-Ferguson Act exemption. And, indeed, it appears to be this crucial distinction 
between intra-industry cooperative efforts on one hand and inter-industry agreements on the other that has led the two district 
courts that have considered the issue since Royal Drug to conclude that such horizontal agreements are exempt. In Quality Auto Body, for example, the court reasoned: "
669,," The Supreme Court (in Royal Drug ) noted that a primary concern of Congress in passing this legislation ""was that cooperative 
ratemaking efforts be exempt from the antitrust law."" 440 U.S. at 221, 99 S. Ct. at 1078. Thus, at least some agreements that 
would otherwise be condemned as price fixing were intended to be immune when engaged in by insurance companies. 
Agreements concerning the level of benefits would appear to fall into the same category as agreements setting rates."
669,1980," -2 Trade Cases P 63,507 at p. 76,696-97, n.4. See also Proctor v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., 1980-2 Trade 
Cases P 63,591 at 77,138 (D.D.C.1980) (concluding that the United States Supreme Court's remand of the case in light of Royal 
Drug did not disturb the ""core"" ruling of the Circuit Court that the alleged horizontal agreements were exempt under the 
provisions of the McCarran-Ferguson Act.) Such reasoning is sound. As the Supreme Court stressed in Royal Drug, Congress, in enacting McCarran-Ferguson, recognized 
the necessity for concerted rate-making efforts if insurance companies were to underwrite risks in a meaningful and responsible 
manner. The formula for the payment of insurance claims directly bears on rate making, since it determines how much risk is 
involved and how much risk will be assumed by the insurer. Thus, functionally, the intra-industry agreements here, which are 
inextricably intertwined with the premium to be charged, so closely resemble actual rate-making agreements that identical 
treatment under the McCarran-Ferguson Act is called for. This court therefore joins in the conclusions reached by the courts in Quality Auto Body and Proctor II that HN4[
] horizontal 
agreements among insurance companies setting the level of benefits to be paid under insurance contracts fall within the 
protective ambit of the McCarran-Ferguson Act."
669,8," .  As stated above, plaintiffs do not contend that the provider agreements, standing alone, violate the Sherman Act. This was the 
principal contention addressed by this court in Sausalito Pharmacy v. Blue Shield, C-78-2196 RFP (March 16, 1980), in which 
we concluded that the express provider agreements between the insurance companies and the pharmacies did not, as a matter 
of law, violate the antitrust laws."
669,9," .  We do note, however, that, at least for several defendants even an extremely formal arrangement seems to be lacking. 
Because we find no antitrust violation, however, for purposes of this motion, we will follow the tack taken by the court in Quality 
Auto Body, supra, and assume that such informal agreement do exist. It is undisputed, however, that there are no express or 
formalized arrangement as in Royal Drug. "
671,10," .  Liberty Mutual is no longer a defendant in this action as it has reached a settlement agreement with plaintiffs. We included 
this evidence anyway to examine the extent to which it might have implicated other defendants in some price-fixing scheme. "
673,11," .  Plaintiffs argued at oral argument that defendants have also agreed to fix the overall price of autobody repairs. Some 
defendants, plaintiffs charge, will pay a higher hourly rate and allow for fewer hours to perform the repair; other defendants, 
plaintiffs say, accord greater time but pay a lesser hourly rate. Plaintiffs, however, at no time, introduced any evidence that the 
overall price was at all the same. Indeed, they introduced no evidence at all regarding the overall price for repairs. They relied 
simply on the fact that, at all times, the price each defendant would pay was less than the plaintiffs would charge. This does not 
state an antitrust violation; the antitrust laws protect competition, not competitors.  Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-o-Mat, Inc., 
429 U.S. 477, 488, 97 S. Ct. 690, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977)."
673,12," .  Plaintiffs point to the declaration of plaintiff Frank Phillips who states that he was a ""captive"" shop and that, during that time, 
his repair work was less than competent. Whatever this might say about Mr. Phillips, it hardly establishes that during 1971-1975, 
any of the defendants' ""captive"" shops did shoddy repair work because of the low rates the insurance companies were willing to 
pay. "
679,1," .  HN1[

franchise with us was in Muenster, and that was the only place they were allowing us to be at that time. (R. vol. 2 at 93)"
680,5," .  Heffley explained his refusal to agree to fix a minimum price as follows: I said, well, no…. I never did give a retail price suggested retail price I would set, and that wasn't because of Muenster Butane or 
anyone else.  It was simply because the competition in town was always so keen from other manufacturers. It's a very 
competitive business and always has been. (R. vol. 3 at 518) Richard Bittner, Vice-President and General Manager of Stewart, also testified that residents of Gainesville could purchase 
television sets of similar ""type, grade, quality, price, and performance"" to those of Zenith in the years 1972-1979 (R. vol. 2 at 65, 
emphasis added).  Although not explicitly stated, the clear import of Bittner's testimony was that consumers in Gainesville were 
free to substitute one brand of television for another and that interbrand competition was strong. Finally, James Myrick, Muenster Butane's manager at their Gainesville store, admitted that there were ""many others in the 
marketplace selling other than (him)self and Mr. Heffley."" (R. vol. 2 at 279)"

like the one here -- did not contain specific allegations regarding either the identity of defendant's purported co-conspirator(s) or 
the nature of the purported concerted actions.  There, as here, defendant published a directory of individuals and firms engaged 
in a particular trade or profession (in the Zicos case defendant's directory listed dealers of dried fruits, nuts, candies, and gift 
baskets).  There, as here, plaintiff claimed that no other, equivalent directory existed and that consequently defendant was a 
monopolist. The Zicos complaint contained the same conclusory language as the instant complaint regarding the alleged concerted action, 
merely asserting that defendant was ""acting in concert with other…."" For that reason, the Zicos court dismissed the action.  Its 
holding is fully applicable to the instant case as well: Where the complaint alleges in conclusory and generalized form unlawful combination as the gravamen of such a cause of 
action, it is deemed insufficient if unsupported by necessary allegations of particular facts.  Here the allegation as to defendant 
publisher acting in concert with unnamed persons with purported intent to restrain the competition of plaintiff… is obviously not 
'sufficiently particular….' [citations omitted]. However, the Zicos court also noted that the plaintiff had failed to establish a refusal to deal by defendant, a distinction perhaps 
relevant to its refusal to permit repleading. "
692,4," Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.  § 1, provides: Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several 
states, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal…. Section 2, 15 U.S.C.  § 2, provides: Every person who shall monopolize or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to 
monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several states, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a 
misdemeanor. "
694,5," Professor Maroney, in his study Antitrust in the ""Empire State,"" supra, is in accord.  19 Syrac. L.R. 841-51.  Indeed, he draws, 
inter alia, the following conclusion from his review of the cases: New York law also gives improper scope to the right of a monopoly to refuse to deal.  The broad statement in the Locker case 
does not, however, conflict with the statute as it now stands.  ""Basic to a violation of the Donnelly Act is proof of an unlawful 
agreement,"" which was lacking in that case.  Thus legislation, similar to Section 2 of the Sherman Act, is necessary to broaden 
the reach of the Donnelly Act so that monopolization by a single firm can be prevented.  [footnote committed] Id., at 862. "

cases.  Regulation of the legal profession, to be sure, is largely the province of the states and the District of Columbia, but the 
federal courts nevertheless have a responsibility to listen when a litigant charges constitutional or federal statutory violations.  As 
the Supreme Court has observed, (w)hen a State exercises power wholly within the domain of state interest, it is insulated from federal judicial review.  But such 
insulation is not carried over when state power is used as an instrument for circumventing a federally protected right. Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 566, 84 S. Ct. 1362, 1384, 12 L. Ed. 2d 506, 530 (1964) (footnote omitted), quoting Gomillion

of the Supreme Court of Arizona that its ban on lawyer advertising did not violate federal antitrust law should not be mistaken 
as a recognition of state-court jurisdiction to entertain federal antitrust suits.  The Bates plaintiffs raised an antitrust argument 
before the Arizona high court as a defense in a proceeding to enforce a disciplinary rule, and that court dealt with the argument 
for what it was a defensive challenge to the validity of the rule, not an original antitrust action.  See Matter of Bates, 113 Ariz.

707,61," The District Court dismissed Feldman's federal antitrust claim on a different ground that it had been resolved by the District of 
Columbia Court of Appeals and thus could be reviewed only by the Supreme Court.  See Feldman Order, supra note 55, at 4, F. 
App. 50.  We believe this rationale to be erroneous, both because there was no adjudication on the merits of that claim by the 
Court of Appeals, see Part III infra, and because the District Court has exclusive original jurisdiction over federal antitrust 
actions.  See note 60 supra.  We affirm the dismissal on the basis of the analysis set forth in text.  See note 201 supra. We note further that although Feldman directed his complaint against the Committee on Admissions and its secretary as well as 
against the Court of Appeals and its members, see note 3 supra, in the antitrust context we perceive no basis for a claim against 
the Committee.  The challenged rule was promulgated by the Court of Appeals, and the Court of Appeals has the ultimate 
responsibility for its enforcement.  The Committee's functions are limited; it acts primarily in an adversary capacity.  See note 41 
supra and note 193 infra.  Consequently our discussion in this part addresses only the potential liability of the Court of Appeals."

here and across the Nation owe their existence and authority to Congress.  From the viewpoint of government in the District, 
tribunals possessing jurisdiction over nonfederal matters was as much a sheer necessity as tribunals handling federal judicial 
business.  Congress deliberately chose to establish the two systems of courts in the District, Palmore v. United States, supra 
note 101, 411 U.S. at 406-407, 93 S. Ct. at 1681, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 357, and each discharges in its own sphere the essential

Act, which originally was phrased to outlaw injunctions ""to stay proceedings in any court of a state."" Act of Mar. 2, 1793, ch. 22, 
§ 5, 1 Stat. 335.  In Prentis' era, the Act provided: The writ of injunction shall not be granted by any court of the United States to stay proceedings in court of a State, except in 
cases where such injunction may be authorized by any law relating to proceedings in bankruptcy. Rev.Stat. § 720 (1874).  In current text, the Act specifies: A court of the United States may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a State court except as expressly authorized by 
Act of Congress, or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments."

was to the Supreme Court.  For a half-century it has been settled that the Court cannot engage in the decision of questions of an "
716,," administrative character, but only of those in such form that the judicial power is capable of acting upon them.  Keller v. Potomac

718,154," Contrary to arguments made to us, the Supreme Court has never held that any and all types of state-court action regarding

Ex parte Garland, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 333, 18 L. Ed. 366 (1867), for that proposition is misplaced.  Although the Garland Court 
described the admission of attorneys to the bar as an exercise of judicial power, it was not called upon, as we are on these 
appeals, to ascertain the proper forum for review of such decisions.  When faced with the necessity of determining whether 
particular action is judicial, and hence immune from reexamination by lower federal district courts, the Supreme Court has

719,166," As appellants have aptly observed, the procedures followed in the Court of Appeals seem, to say the least, unorthodox for 
any matter really considered by a court under the auspices of its judicial authority.  No docket entry was made; there apparently 
was no opportunity for submission of evidence; no formal hearing was held; no record was compiled; and there were no 
opposing parties in the classic sense.  Brief for Appellant Hickey at 20-24, 35; Brief for Appellant Feldman at 48.  Even more 
surprising, given appellees' insistent characterization of the proceedings as judicial, the court itself initiated an ex parte contact 
with ABA in an effort to assess the validity of the antitrust allegations raised by Feldman.  See Letter, Alexander L. Stevas, Clerk, 
District of Columbia Court of Appeals, to Frederick R. Franklin, Staff Director, Section on Legal Education and Admissions to the 
Bar, American Bar Association, April 26, 1978, H.App. 105. While certain, though, that distinctions may be drawn between these cases and Summers, we are advertent to the admonition 
that the mere form of the proceeding is not of controlling significance.  See text supra at note 162.  The fact that the court 
deviated from customary judicial procedure has obvious bearing on the question whether appellants' waiver proceedings were 
truly judicial, but standing alone it did not render them nonjudicial. ""(T)he circumstances of the refusal"" also are relevant, In re 
Summers, supra note 134, 325 U.S. at 566, 65 S. Ct. at 1310-1311, 89 L. Ed. at 1800; see Brooks v. Laws, supra note 4, 92 
U.S.App.D.C. at 376, 208 F.2d at 27, but they do not necessarily convert the proceeding from judicial to nonjudicial, as Summers 
itself illustrates.  The crucial question remains, as Prentis instructs, whether the final act was judicial in nature.  See text supra at

171, the applicant for waiver never argued the question of the validity of (the rule) before the (highest court of the jurisdiction).  He was asking for ministerial 
action, not judicial determination.  The denial of his petition was made by the court acting in an administrative capacity.  See Law

721,182," See text supra at note 45.  While, in an effort toward simplicity, we discuss the cases of both Feldman and Hickey in terms of 
their requests for permission to sit for the District of Columbia bar examination, it should be recalled that Feldman's petition to 
the Court of Appeals sought waiver of the educational requirements for purposes of reciprocity admission as well.  See text 
supra at notes 40-53.  Subsection (c) of Rule 46 I at that time provided for admission of members of state bars without the five-
year practice requirement that is not ordinarily mandatory.  Compare D.C.App.R. 46 I(c) (1975) with D.C.App.R. 46 I(c) (1978).  
We view both branches of Feldman's petition in the same light, and the considerations we elaborate are equally applicable to 
each.  As with respect to the bar examination prerequisite, the pivotal factors are first that Feldman avowed no claim of right or 
entitlement to bar admission under the reciprocity provision, and second that, acknowledging the rule's applicability to him, he 
sought waiver of the educational requirement rather than an adjudication of his admissibility to the bar.  While ordinarily bar 
admission ventures result in judicial proceedings, see note 200 infra, and while the end result of Feldman's waiver request if 
successful would have been reciprocity admission, his petition, fairly read, was a supplication for a discretionary dispensation 
rather than a legal demand for admission."
721,183," The letter plainly identified its objective: As we understand it, … the Committee on Admissions has advised Mr. Feldman that Rule 46I bars him from even taking the 
D.C. bar examination because he is not a graduate of an A.B.A. accredited law school…. Under Section 11-2501 of the District 
of Columbia Code, the Court has plenary power to regulate the licensing of attorneys in the District.  This power plainly includes 
the discretion to waive the requirements of Rule 46 in a deserving case.  Clearly, Mr. Feldman's unusually high qualifications for 
admission provide an ideal occasion for the exercise of such discretion. Letter, Robert M. Sussman to Hon. Theodore R. Newman, Jr., supra note 44, at 3, F.App. 25.  See Feldman Petition, supra

made plain that at least in the abstention context, when a litigant goes into a state court for an authoritative ruling on the 
applicability of a state regulation in his case, he is not barred from thereafter raising his constitutional objections in a federal

722,193," Both cases at bar differ materially from Summers in this respect.  While the Illinois bar committee, like its counterpart in the 
District of Columbia, served the court in an advisory capacity, In re Summers, supra note 134, 325 U.S. at 567-568, 65 S. Ct. at 
1311-1312, 89 L. Ed. at 1801, the former had independent authority that the latter lacked.  The Illinois committee was 
empowered to deny certificates of fitness, and in fact it denied one to Summers on grounds he challenged as unconstitutional.  
Id. at 569 n.10, 65 S. Ct. at 1312 n.10, 89 L. Ed. at 1801-1802 n.10. The proceeding in the Illinois high court was thus a review 
of the committee's action resulting in a decision on the merits.  Id. at 567-568, 65 S. Ct. at 1311-1312, 89 L. Ed. at 1801. The 
District of Columbia Committee, on the other hand, had no authority to act on appellants' requests save by recommendation to 
the Court of Appeals, and it did not purport to do otherwise; rather, the action complained of was in each instance the court's 
own.  Thus, in these cases, unlike Summers, we do not have a situation wherein ""relief is … sought in a (nonfederal) court 
against the action of a committee, appointed to advise the court."" Id."

723,198," Id.  We note that in each of the major bar admission cases in which the Supreme Court has discussed its jurisdiction, the 
constitutional issues considered had been raised and argued below.  In re Summers, supra note 134, came to the Court only 
after the petitioner had sought to have the Illinois Supreme Court overturn the decision of a committee of the state bar on 
constitutional grounds.  Similarly, in Konigsberg v. State Bar of California, 353 U.S. 252, 77 S. Ct. 722, 1 L. Ed. 2d 810 (1957), 
the Court expressly noted that it was granting certiorari because the petitioner had repeatedly asserted his constitutional claims 
throughout his hearings before the state's committee of bar examiners and had stated them again in his petition for review 
before the California Supreme Court.  See also In re Griffiths, 413 U.S. 717, 718, 93 S. Ct. 2851, 2853, 37 L. Ed. 2d 910, 913

(noting that three-judge district court was properly convened to hear constitutional challenge to state bar-admission requirement, 
and pointing out, without stating its opinion on the matter, that three-judge court held that ""the courts and the justices were acting 
in an administrative capacity""); Baird v. State Bar of Arizona, 401 U.S. 1, 5, 91 S. Ct. 702, 705, 27 L. Ed. 2d 639, 646 (1971)

228-229 (constitutional questions were briefed and argued before state court).  Other cases dealing with bar admission have not 
made clear whether the constitutional issues were argued in the state court, but they also have not discussed the jurisdictional 
questions at all."
723,199," To the extent relevant here, the doctrine of judicial immunity from suit for damages buttresses our holding.  In that context, 
the Court recently declared that ""the factors determining whether an act by a judge is a ""judicial' one relate to the nature of the 
act itself … and to the expectations of the parties, i. e., whether they dealt with the judge in his judicial capacity."" Stump v. 
Sparkman, 435 U.S. 349, 362, 98 S. Ct. 1099, 1107, 55 L. Ed. 2d 331, 342 (1978). We have held that appellants did not seek or 
subject themselves to judicial action by the Court of Appeals, and their expectations of purely nonjudicial rulings by the court 
militate in favor of federal jurisdiction of their lawsuits."
723,200," The decisions upon which appellees chiefly rely are readily distinguishable.  Cases precipitated by disciplinary proceedings 
against lawyers, e.g., Grossgold v. Supreme Court of Illinois, 557 F.2d 122 (7th Cir. 1977); Jones v. Hulse, 391 F.2d 198 (8th 
Cir.), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 889, 89 S. Ct. 206, 21 L. Ed. 2d 167 (1968), are inapposite because the proceedings challenged 
therein culminated in adjudications on the right to engage in law practice.  Randall v. Brigham, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 523, 535, 19 L.

U.S.App.D.C. 418, 421, 543 F.2d 903, 906 (1976). We detect no element of judiciality in the disposition of appellants' entreaties 
for dispensation of Rule 46 I(b), not on legal grounds but wholly as a matter of administrative grace. Nor does Doe v. Pringle, 550 F.2d 596 (10th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 916, 97 S. Ct. 2179, 53 L. Ed. 2d 227 (1977) aid 
the position espoused by appellees.  Doe twice sought and obtained rulings albeit adverse by the Supreme Court of Colorado on 
his application for admission to the bar, id. at 596-597, and thereafter initiated litigation that was, ""in essence, an attempt by Doe 
to seek review in inferior federal courts of the entire state proceedings, including the order of the Colorado Supreme Court 
refusing to grant his second application for admission."" Id. at 599 (emphasis in original).  We are in full agreement with the 
observation that ""(t)he action of the Colorado court was judicial rather than administrative,"" id. at 604 (Breitenstein, J., concurring 
in result), a characterization the Court of Appeals' action in the present cases does not fit.  Moreover, neither Feldman nor 
Hickey now seek review of the waiver proceedings in the Court of Appeals, or the court's decision on waiver.  See note 24 supra.  
Instead, each challenges on antitrust and constitutional grounds the administration of Rule 64 I(b) and the validity of the rule 
itself.  These cases thus differ from Brown v. Board of Bar Examiners of the State of Nevada, 623 F.2d 605 (9th Cir. 1980), 
which held the district court to be without jurisdiction to entertain a challenge to a state court's decision not to waive a rule similar 
to the rule at issue in the instant case.  Although acknowledging that ""federal district courts may assert jurisdiction … to ensure 
that generally applicable rules or procedures do not impinge on constitutionally protected rights,"" id. at 609, the Ninth Circuit 
ruled that there is no jurisdiction to hear a lawsuit based on the theory that the state court had arbitrarily and capriciously refused 
to waive the rule.  Id. at 609-610. We do not reach that question in this case."

731,1," The complaint itself is somewhat ambiguous as to whether Skil was was to function merely as the distributor or also as the 
manufacturer of the new product line.  At oral argument, however, the parties agreed that the saws were being manufactured by 
Beaird-Poulan. "
732,2," Moreover, plaintiff would be hard put to argue to the contrary.  Voluntary partial divestiture has long been recognized as a 
means of curing the potential Section 7 problems raised by a particular merger. E.g., F.T.C. v. Atlantic Richfield Co ., 549 F. 2d 
289, 299 (4th Cir. 1977). "
733,3," The court does not mean by this line of reasoning to endorse the so called ""efficiency defense."" While some commendators 
have advocated various forms of a merger test that would involve an explicit weighing of the risk and costs of market 
concentration against the possible economies resulting from a particular combination, see e.g., Areeda & Turner, 4 Antitrust 
Law PP939-944, 962; Williamson, Economies as an Antitrust Defense , 125 U. Pa. L. Rev. 699 (1977), the Supreme Court has 
rejected this mode of analysis.  Philadelphia National Bank, supra , 374 U.S. at 371; FTC v. Procter & Gamble Co ., 386 U.S. 
568, 580 (1967). Here, the question is not one of the net benefit or burden imposed on society by the merger. Rather, the 
question is whether this merger is of the sort that the Supreme Court has deemed to be so likely to result in diseconomies as to 
preclude the need for intricate economic analysis.  Put another way there are certain attributes of horizontal mergers which, in 
the eyes of the Supreme Court, make such mergers inherently suspect.  The issue addressed by this opinion is whether or not 
this merger shares to any significant degree in those suspicious attributes. "
734,4," Moreover, the court wishes to mephasize that this is the only reading of the complaint, as currently drafted, that does state 
such a claim.  If the sale of assets to National was not a sham, then, for the reasons already given, the integration of Emerson 
and Skil cannot be viewed as an unlawful horizontal merger. Neither can it be viewed as unlawful if the merger is characterized 
in other terms.  Arguably, the acquisition of Skil might be treated as either a vertical acquisition or as a product extension 
merger, but neither of these characterization of the pleadings would support a claim of illegality. The touchstone for analysis of vertical mergers is the extent to which competitioners will be foreclosed from dealing with the 
newly integrated businesses.  Brown Shoe Co. v. United States , 370 U.S. 294, 322-324 (1962). While there are additional 
considerations that are normally reviewed in vertical merger cases, all of them are meant to be subsidiary to the ultimate 
question of foreclosure.  370 U.S. at 324, 328-329. The vertical aspect of this merger becomes perceptible if one thinks of 
Emerson as having acquired a new marketing arm for its chain saw business by merging with Skil.  This integration, however, 
entails no foreclosure of competition.  Skil has never marketed chain saws for anybody but itself and, now, Emerson.  Hence, 
none of Emerson's competitors are being foreclosed from access to any pre-existing marketing outlet.  At the same time there is 
nothing in this record to indicate that Emerson's sales through Skil will restrict its ability to supply other chain saw distributors.  
Hence, none of the firms in competition with Skil in the business of selling chain saws will be foreclosed from dealing with 
Emerson.  Thus, the vertical aspects of this transaction do not implicate any policies of the antitrust laws. The same is true if this case is dealt with as a product extension merger. In a product extension merger the acquiring company 
purchases a business in a related, though not directly competitive line of business.  Such mergers have been deemed 
anticompetitive where the acquiring firm had been a potential competitor ""on the edge"" of the market in which the acquired firm 
participates.  E.g., FTC v. Procter & Gamble Co ., 386 U.S. 568, 580-581 (1967), U.S. v. Penn-Olin Chemical Co ., 378 U.S. 158 
(1964). They have also been deemed anticompetitive where the resources of the acquiring company have so outstripped those 
of the firms already competing in the line of commerce as to inhibit their competitive aggressiveness or raise barriers to entry.  
E.g., FTC v. Procter & Gamble, supra , 386 U.S. at 578-579; Purex v. Procter & Gamble Co ., 596 F. 2d 881, 885 (9th Cir. 1979). 
Here, of course, Emerson was already a competitor both in the business of manufacturing chain saws and in the business of 
distributing them.  Consequently, its acquisition of Skil's marketing capacity cannot be said to change the competitive structure of 
the chain saw industry in any of these ways. "
736,5," Plaintiff primarily contests this view of the negotiations by contending that paragraph 6 would be meaningless if it is not a 
noncomplete agreement.  On its face, however, the paragraph merely includes a promise not to manufacture or sell the chain "
737,," saws listed in an exhibit to the contract.  These are simply the chain saws that Skil had been manufacturing and selling before 
the asset sale. Moreover, it was the blueprints, dies, and other materials necessary for the manufacture of these particular saws 
that were sold to National under the other provisions of the contract.  Thus, it would be perfectly reasonable to read paragraph 6 
as being exactly what it purports to be, namely, a promise that Skil would not manufacture the specific product it had sold to 
National. "

745,2," ""Schwinn's principal methods of selling its bicycles are as follows: (1) sales to distributors, primarily cycle distributors, B. F. 
Goodrich and hardware jobbers; (2) sales to retailers by means of consignment or agency arrangements with distributors; and 
(3) sales to retailers under the so-called Schwinn Plan which involves direct shipment by Schwinn to the retailer with Schwinn

746,3," First Mississippi's trades for delivery convenience have not been included in these calculations for determining what 
percentage of urea sold by First Mississippi had been purchased by First Mississippi.  Such trades, so long as it cannot be 
disputed that they are merely for delivery convenience of the manufacturers involved, should not be considered in determining 
whether a manufacturer is engaging in the business of trading in the commodity."
746,4," This warning does not imply that the Supreme Court is backing off from established per se rules.  See Catalano, Inc. v. Target 
Sales, Inc., 446 U.S. 643, 100 S. Ct. 1925, 64 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1980). "
747,5," Thus, vertical market-distributing agreements must truly be imposed by a supplier, in fact.  Market-distributing agreements 
which are initiated by distributors are horizontal, even if the supplier is nominally a party to the contract.  United States v. Sealy, 
Inc., supra."
747,6," For this reason, this Court's pre-Sylvania holding in Hobart Brothers Co. v. Malcolm T. Gilliland, Inc., 471 F.2d 894 (5th Cir. 
1973), may remain unchanged by Sylvania.  The market-distributing agreement imposed in Hobart was imposed by one 
manufacturer against a competing manufacturer. "
749,7," Abadir has also argued that there was a market-dividing agreement between First Mississippi and Transamonia, a trader like 
Abadir.  Because Transamonia stood in the same position as Abadir, Transamonia's agreement is subject to the same rule of 
reason test as Abadir's agreement. It is not necessary to address the issue of whether the international nature of the market division would render this a rule of 
reason case if it were otherwise a horizontal per se case.  Nothing in this opinion should be read as addressing that issue. "

776,1," GAF's original complaint was filed on April 30, 1973.  As the lawsuit progressed, GAF modified and supplemented its claims 
against Kodak.  Pursuant to Orders dated April 22, 1981, May 5, 1981, and June 17, 1981, GAF filed an amended and 
supplemental complaint on June 18, 1981, which sets forth with reasonable specificity all the claims being pursued by GAF. "
777,2," The issue preclusion doctrine of collateral estoppel is related to, but distinct from, the doctrine of res judicata.  As the Supreme 
Court succinctly explained in Montana v. United States, 440 U.S. 147, 153, 99 S. Ct. 970, 973, 59 L. Ed. 2d 210 (1979): ""Under res judicata, a final judgment on the merits bars further claims by parties or their privies based on the same cause of 
action.  Under collateral estoppel, once an issue is actually and necessarily determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, that 
determination is conclusive in subsequent suits based on a different cause of action involving a party to the prior litigation."" 
(Citations omitted). With regard to the distinction between offensive and defensive use of collateral estoppel, the Supreme Court has stated: HN1[
] ""(O)ffensive use of collateral estoppel occurs when the plaintiff seeks to foreclose the defendant from litigating an issue 
the defendant has previously litigated unsuccessfully in an action with another party.  Defensive use occurs when a defendant 
seeks to prevent a plaintiff from asserting a claim the plaintiff has previously litigated and lost against another defendant.""

777,3," In opposition to GAF's motion, Kodak submitted a memorandum of law in opposition and a sur-reply brief.  Because no 
provision in the briefing schedule was made for sur-reply briefs, the Court adopted Magistrate Gershon's recommendation that 
the sur-reply brief not be considered."
777,4," After filing its notice of motion, GAF withdrew its § 2 claims with regard to the conventional amateur camera market and the 
color paper market.  Nevertheless, GAF did not withdraw its collateral estoppel motion as it relates to either of those markets.  In 
addition, although GAF no longer seeks damages with respect to the conventional amateur camera or color paper markets, a 
determination of the parameters of those markets and Kodak's possession of market power therein might (subject to later 
rulings) be utilized at trial by GAF in support of its monopolization claims in other markets.  Accordingly, the Court will rule on the 
collateral estoppel motion as it relates to all the markets raised in GAF's moving papers."
777,5," The precise facts which GAF seeks to preclude Kodak from litigating or denying are set forth in GAF's ""Statement Under Rule 
9(g),"" filed contemporaneously with its motion. "
778,6," In light of the Supreme Court's recent discussion and ruling in Parklane Hosiery, 439 U.S. 322, 333-337, 99 S. Ct. 645, 652-
654, 58 L. Ed. 2d 552, there is little question that the amendment to § 5(a) would withstand a constitutional challenge on 
Seventh Amendment grounds. "
780,7," Kodak contends that because Judge Frankel entered judgment n.o.v. in Kodak's favor on the color paper claim, there is no 
judgment on which a finding of monopoly power could be implied.  This argument is unpersuasive in light of the Second Circuit's 
express statement that ""there will be no need to retry the issue of market power (in the color paper market)."" 603 F.2d at 299. "
783,8," Contrary to Kodak's contention, the Second Circuit's affirmance of the jury's finding of § 1 liability from the magicube and 
flipflash conspiracies and the Circuit's mandate were not ""avowedly tentative."" As previously discussed, supra at 1212-1213, 
HN12[

786,9," In Malamud v. Sinclair Oil Corp., 521 F.2d 1142 (6th Cir. 1975), the Sixth Circuit adopted the ""zone of interests"" standing test,

150, 90 S. Ct. 827, 25 L. Ed. 2d 184 (1970). See also Chrysler Corp. v. Fedders Corp., 643 F.2d 1229 (6th Cir. 1981), cert. pet. 
filed, 50 U.S.L.W. 3005 (July 2, 1981).  The Ninth Circuit, at least in dicta, has looked with approval upon the ""zone of interests"" 
approach and appears to be moving toward a standard broader than foreseeability.  California State Council of Carpenters v. 
Associated General Contractors of California, Inc., 648 F.2d 527, n.18 (9th Cir. 1980). The Third Circuit has apparently disposed 
of the target area test, at least in name, in favor of a ""balancing test comprised of many constant and variable factors."" Bravman 
v. Bassett Furniture Industries, 552 F.2d 90, 99 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 823, 98 S. Ct. 69, 54 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1977). In 
addition, the Court notes that the commentators in this area, while offering different approaches to the standing question, are 
generally in agreement that the law is in a state of flux and confusion.  See Tyler, Private Antitrust Litigation: The Problem of 
Standing, 49 U. Colorado L.Rev. 269 (1978); Berger and Bernstein, An Analytic Framework for Antitrust Standing, 86 Yale L.J. 
809 (1977); Sherman, Antitrust Standing: From Loeb to Malamud, 51 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 374 (1976); Letter and Reply, 51

Procedural Innovations in Antitrust Suits, 71 Colum.L.Rev. 1 (1971). "
788,10," This conclusion is supported by the documents appended to GAF's papers in opposition which indicate that Kodak considered 
GAF a direct competitor on the manufacturing level and that both Sylvania and GE viewed GAF as an original equipment 
manufacturer. By referring to these documents, however, the Court is not adopting nor endorsing the dicta of Schwimmer, 637 
F.2d at n.15, which stated that ""evidence of a seller's specific intent to restrain trade among indirect purchasers necessarily 
confers standing on those remote customers."" Given the ruling that GAF has standing to assert its Section 1 camera claims on 
the grounds discussed supra at 1221-1222, the Court declines to express an opinion regarding GAF's contention that Kodak 
""deliberately"" sought to injure it and that this ""necessarily"" confers standing. "
789,11," Kodak's claim that GAF's alleged injury is not antitrust injury, founded on Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 
U.S. 477, 489, 97 S. Ct. 690, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977), is unpersuasive.  Contrary to Kodak's contention (Reply Memorandum at 
18), GAF's possible recovery would be predicated on an alleged antitrust law violation the withholding of information about new 
products resulting in GAF's inability to produce (i.e., design and order to be manufactured) the new cameras. See generally J. 
Truett Payne Co., Inc. v. Chrysler Motors Corp.,  -- - U.S.  -- , 451 U.S. 557, 101 S. Ct. 1923, 68 L. Ed. 2d 442 (1981)."
789,12," The Court notes that under the broader foreseeability test a test which GAF argues was adopted by the Second Circuit in 
Schwimmer GAF would have standing to assert its claim.  There is little question that GAF's sale of cameras was ""in the area 
which (Kodak) could reasonably (have) foreseen would be affected by the conspiracy"" and that GAF was ""within that area of the 
economy which (was) endangered by a breakdown of competitive conditions in the (camera) industry."" Twentieth Century Fox 
Film Corp. v. Goldwyn, 328 F.2d 190, 220 (9th Cir.) cert. denied, 379 U.S. 880, 85 S. Ct. 143, 13 L. Ed. 2d 87 (1964)."
789,13," Although millions of amateur photographers are probably familiar with the basic photographic process and film characteristics, 
a brief description of photographic film is set forth in order to assist in understanding the claims presented herein. While films may be distinguished on the basis of a wide variety of factors, the key variables for purposes of this case are (1) a 
film's format or size of exposed image; (2) its speed; (3) its graininess; (4) whether it is positive or reversal; (5) whether it is color 
or black and white; and (6) the process necessary to develop it. Format refers to the size of the film area which is exposed to light.  Still film is available in a wide variety of formats, including 
110 (used in the so-called ""pocket"" cameras introduced by Kodak in 1972), 126 film, and 135 or 35 millimeter film. Film ""speed"" refers to an emulsion's sensitivity to light and is designated by the ASA number.  Generally, a film with a higher 
ASA number (i.e., a ""faster"" film) is more sensitive to light than a film with a lower ASA number. The ""grain"" of a film refers generally to the emulsion's capacity to produce a clean and sharp image.  A film's emulsion is 
comprised of tiny light-sensitive grains, which, when greatly enlarged, give a negative, a positive, or a photograph a speckled, 
pebbly appearance.  In short, a finer grain film may be subject to greater enlargements or magnifications without an 
unacceptable loss in clarity. When exposed and processed, negative film yields a ""negative"" which must be projected (and usually enlarged) onto light 
sensitive paper which, when processed, produces a photographic print.  On the other hand, reversal film, when exposed and 
processed, yields a positive transparency which is generally projected on a screen.  Slide films and movie films are reversal 
films. Of course, films are available which produce either color or black and white finished products. Finally, films vary in the processes needed to develop them.  The broadest distinction can be drawn between those films that 
must be developed in a laboratory and those that are developed immediately after the film is exposed (i.e., ""instant"" films). "
790,," Within the category of laboratory-processed films, the technical processes for developing films vary on the basis of many factors.  
Films may only be developed in processes compatible with the film's characteristics."
790,14," GAF also alleges that at the time of the introduction of Kodacolor II and the C-41 process, Kodak allegedly began to offer bulk 
processing services for Kodak's C-22 compatible film to independent photofinishers in order to encourage photofinishers to 
cease processing the C-22 films of GAF and other competitors. Further, GAF alleges that Kodak refused to process or make prints from films of competitors. Also, Kodak allegedly ""rushed"" 
Kodacolor II film in the 110 format to market in March 1972, despite the existence of several serious defects, in order to coerce "
791,," photofinishers to convert to the C-41 process before film manufacturing competitors had gained a sufficient foothold in the C-22 
compatible film market to forestall the change."
791,15," In order to avoid excessive softening of the film and to prevent melting of the gelatine in the film during high temperature 
processing, film must be hardened.  The film may either be hardened during the initial steps of the processing cycle through the 
use of certain hardeners in the processing solutions or be hardened during the manufacturing process by adding hardener to the 
film. The latter approach, known as ""forehardening"", is utilized by Kodak in its Kodacolor II film. Affidavit of Herbert L. Rees, 
sworn to July 31, 1980, at P 12."
791,16," GAF also alleges that Kodak abandoned research on and suppressed significant improvements in Kodacolor X film and the 
C-22 process and concentrated on shifting to a new higher temperature process and compatible film, because such 
improvements would inhibit photofinishers from converting to the C-41 process. "
793,17," Berkey emphasized that HN25[
] monopoly power must be ""wielded "" in order for liability to attach; mere advantages inuring to the monopolist by virtue of its structure as an integrated firm may not ordinarily be the basis of § 2 liability."
793,18," See California Computer Products, Inc. v. IBM Corp., 613 F.2d 727, 744 (9th Cir. 1979); ILC Peripherals Leasing Corp. v. IBM 
Corp., 458 F. Supp. 423, 438-39 (N.D.Cal.1978), aff'd, Memorex Corp. v. IBM Corp., 636 F.2d 1188 (9th Cir. 1980), cert. denied,

481 F. Supp. 965, 1003 (N.D.Cal.1979), appeal docketed No. 80-4048 (9th Cir. 1980). "
794,19," Under the principles discussed supra at 1227-1228, Kodak's design conduct (i. e., the design of Kodacolor II and the C-41 
process) would only be subject to scrutiny in the event that the jury were to find that Kodak engaged in coercive conduct or 
misused its monopoly power. In the event that design conduct became an issue, genuine issues of material fact exist as to the 
reasonableness of Kodak's design of Kodacolor II and the C-41 process.  In the face of Kodak's proffered evidence which 
purportedly shows that the new Kodak products represented an improvement over old products and were thus reasonably 
designed, GAF has submitted affidavits and documents raising genuine issues of material fact as to the reasonableness of 
Kodak's designs."
794,20," Relying on Brunswick, 429 U.S. 477, 97 S. Ct. 690, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701, Kodak also argues that GAF's claims should be 
summarily dismissed because GAF has suffered no ""antitrust injury"" as a result of Kodak's introduction of new products.  GAF 
contends that Kodak used its monopoly power to maintain and extend its film market by eliminating competition from C-22 films. 
This alleged reduction in competition appears to be conduct which causes ""antitrust injury."" If it prevails on its liability case, GAF 
will be in a position to offer evidence to prove it suffered ""antitrust injury"" as a result of Kodak's conduct.  Thus, defendant's 
summary judgment motion based upon Brunswick must be denied. "
795,21," A coupler-in-developer film refers to a film in which the color-forming couplers become part of the film only during processing. 
Other types of reversal films, such as Ektachrome, are ""incorporated coupler"" films, in which the color-forming coupler becomes 
a part of the film during manufacturing.  Kodak concedes that the developing process for an incorporated coupler film requires 
fewer processing steps than for a coupler-in-developer film. See Affidavit of John J. Welsh at P 7.  In addition, due to inherent 
limitations in the underlying technology, acceptable quality high speed coupler-in-developer films have never been 
manufactured.  See id.; Affidavit of Alexander Altavilla at P 9. "
796,22," Kodak's alleged suppression of a ME-4 Ektachrome film, to the extent that it might be considered ""coercive"", is discussed 
infra at 1231-1233."
796,23," Although Kodak introduced in 1974 new Kodachrome movie films and a new process for developing Kodachrome films, see 
Rees Affidavit, sworn to July 31, 1980, at PP 68-72, GAF asserts no allegations with respect to the introduction of those films or 
process. "
797,24," The Court is also troubled insofar as GAF's theory is founded on the premise that a monopolist has a duty to lead the field in 
new product introduction.  GAF alleges that the ME-4 process ""utilized less expensive, simpler processing equipment than the 
Kodachrome process, was easier to control and permitted the design of high speed ""available' or ""existing' light movies."" 
Amended Complaint at P 46.  Despite all the purported advantages of the ME-4 process, GAF did not manufacture or market a 
ME-4 compatible film or a process similar to ME-4.  Essentially, GAF claims that Kodak failed to fill a void in the amateur movie 
film market, and GAF could not take advantage of that void because of the unavailability of the ME-4 process on a widespread 
basis.  However, if GAF was prepared, as it contends, to introduce ME-4 processable films, especially an available light film, it 
could have seized the opportunity to fill the perceived void in the amateur movie film market.  Had it marketed a quality available 
light amateur movie film and concomitant process prior to the introduction of Kodak's Ektachrome 160 in 1971, GAF might have 
captured a significant share of the amateur movie market.  Instead, it appears that GAF wished to follow Kodak's lead, so long 
as Kodak manufactured films that could be readily duplicated.  The protections and goals of § 2 should not be perverted so as to 
allow GAF to benefit from its failure to compete.  See Buffalo Courier-Express, Inc. v. Buffalo Evening News, Inc., 601 F.2d 48 
(2d Cir. 1979). "
799,25," Paragraphs 9(d) and 9(e) of GAF's Responses to Interrogatory 2(f) charged that Kodak engaged in: ""Illegal patent practices and policies in connection with patents obtained by (Kodak) for photosensitive products, processes, and 
compounds, including: ""(d) filing patent applications in the United States Patent and Trademark Office for alleged inventions which are the same as or 
trivial variances of the alleged inventions described or claimed in United States patents previously issued to Eastman, and 
prosecuting such applications and permitting patents for such applications to be issued to it, in order to reestablish or with the 
effect of reestablishing expired and expiring patents thereby to extend unlawfully the statutory 17-year right of exclusion granted 
by said previously issued patents; (e) filing patent applications in the United States Patent and Trademark Office for alleged 
inventions which are the same as or trivial variances of the alleged inventions described or claimed in United States patents 
previously issued to Eastman, and prosecuting such applications and permitting patents for such applications to be issued to it, 
in order to create or with the effect of creating an illusion in the public mind that such prior art subject matter is within the 
legitimate scope of such patents, or to increase or with the effect of increasing the expense to competitors of Eastman, including 
GAF, and to the public in general of determining the legitimate scope of such patents."" "
800,26," The allegations of paragraph 61(v) of the amended complaint should not be confused with GAF's purported ""patent blocking"" 
claim which, by parroting the language of the district court opinion in SCM Corp. v. Xerox Corp., 463 F. Supp. 983, 1007 
(D.Conn.1978), quoted at n.27 infra, alleged that Kodak accumulated a vast number of patents for the purpose of blocking 
competition.  In an Order dated June 17, 1981, this Court ruled that GAF's ""patent blocking"" claim could not be pursued in this 
action.  The three alleged purposes for which Kodak procured numerous allegedly trivial patents are separate and distinct from 
the blocking purpose that this Court previously found to be outside this lawsuit.  See Order dated June 17, 1981 at 3-10."
800,27," In applying Walker Process to GAF's § 112 claims and its ""trivial patents"" claims herein, the Court does not wish to imply that 
Walker Process prescribes the exclusive means by which patent related conduct may violate the antitrust laws.  The Second 
Circuit's opinion in SCM Corp. v. Xerox Corp., 645 F.2d at 1205, makes clear that ""patent acquisitions are not immune from the 
antitrust laws."" Further, the district court in SCM Corp. v. Xerox Corp., 463 F. Supp. 983, 1007 (D.Conn.1978), remanded, 599 
F.2d 32 (2d Cir.), on remand, 474 F. Supp. 589 (D.Conn.1979), affirmed and remanded, 645 F.2d 1195 (2d Cir. 1981), held that: ""(Once) a company had acquired monopoly power, it could not thereafter acquire lawful patent power if it obtained new patents 
on its own inventions primarily for the purpose of blocking the development and marketing of competitive products rather than 
primarily to protect its own products from being imitated or blocked by others."" As noted, supra at n.26, this Court has previously ruled that GAF's purported ""patent blocking"" claim was not pleaded or 
otherwise asserted in an early stage of the patent-related discovery and, thus, may not be pursued in this action. "
802,28," In paragraph 61(i) and (ii) of its amended complaint, GAF alleges that Kodak ""engaged in trade secret and patent practices 
designed to hinder GAF and others from making and marketing compatible color films"" and ""maintained its monopoly by 
protecting, in the field of color film, the technology necessary to manufacture compatible products with both trade secrets and 
patents."" Apparently because Kodak's partial summary judgment motion was filed prior to the Court's Orders dated April 22, May 
5, and June 17, 1981 which directed GAF to file an amended complaint setting forth its claims, Kodak did not specifically 
address the broad allegations of paragraph 61(i) and (ii) in its moving papers.  Therefore, summary judgment would be 
inappropriate at this time. "

820,1," The description that follows only highlights the evidence presented at trial.  We do not pretend to provide a full account of a trial 
that generated nearly thirty volumes of transcribed testimony."
820,2," Inglis introduced a memorandum written by the manager of Continental's Sacramento bakery in early 1974, which stated the 
manager's expectation that Inglis would not remain in business for more than one year.  Inglis introduced no direct evidence that 
this prediction actually affected Continental's pricing decisions. "
821,3," It is undisputed that some price increases were allowed during the price control years and that Continental took advantage of 
the allowances to increase the price of Wonder bread. The parties, however, offered different reasons for Continental's failure to 
increase the price of private label bread when the opportunities were available. "

823,6," What juries (and many judges) do not understand is that the availability of evidence of improper intent is often a function of luck 
and of the defendant's legal sophistication, not of the underlying reality.  A firm of executives sensitized to antitrust problems will 
not leave any documentary trail of improper intent; one whose executives lack this sensitivity will often create rich evidence of 
such intent simply by the clumsy choice of words to describe innocent behavior.  Especially misleading here is the inveterate 
tendency of sales executives to brag to their superiors about their competitive prowess, often using metaphors of coercion that 
are compelling evidence of predatory intent to the naive.  Any doctrine that relies upon proof of intent is going to be applied 
erratically at best. R. Posner, Antitrust Law -- An Economic Perspective 189-90 (1976)."
823,7," ""HN8[
] The mere intention of [defendant] to exclude competition… is insufficient to establish specific intent to monopolize by 
some illegal means….To conclude otherwise would contravene the very essence of a competitive marketplace which is to 
prevail against all competitors."" Blair Foods, supra, 610 F.2d at 670 (citation omitted).  Accord, Buffalo Courier Express, Inc. v. 
Buffalo Evening News, Inc ., 601 F.2d 48, 54 (2d Cir. 1979); Hayes v. Solomon, 597 F.2d 958, 977 (5th Cir. 1979), cert. denied,

824,8," The requirement of dangerous probability of success originated in Justice Holmes' opinion in Swift : Where acts are not sufficient in themselves to produce a result which the law seeks to prevent, -- for instance, the monopoly, -- 
but require further acts in addition to the forces of nature to bring that result to pass, an intent to bring it to pass is necessary in 
order to produce a dangerous probability that it will happen….  But when that intent and the consequent dangerous probability 
exist, this statute, like many others, and like the common law in some cases, directs itself against that dangerous probability as 
well as against the completed result. Swift & Co., supra, 196 U.S. at 396, 25 S.Ct. at 279. A careful reading of this language supports the rule of this circuit that 
dangerous probability of success may be inferred from proof of specific intent. Justice Holmes does not refer to dangerous 
probability as an independent element, but rather as the consequence of an intent to monopolize, or perhaps as ""the rationale 
which underlies the legal requirement that there be a specific intent to monopolize before an attempt is found."" L. Sullivan, 
Handbook of the Law of Antitrust § 51, at 137 (1977) (emphasis in original)."
824,9," Since Lessig we have reiterated that although proof of defendant's market power may be relevant both in establishing the 
probability of success and in determining whether the defendant intended to control prices or exclude competition, it is not 
essential in establishing those claims.E.g., Hunt-Wesson, supra, 627 F.2d at 926 & n.3; CalComp, supra, 613 F.2d at 737; Blair 
Foods, supra, 610 F.2d at 669-70."

Agricultural Export Ass'n v. Sunkist Growers, Inc ., 526 F.2d 1196, 1205 (9th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 959, 96 S.Ct.

1972). As our earlier discussion indicates, this sort of conduct must fall into one of two categories: either (1) conduct forming the 
basis for a substantial claim of restraint of trade, or (2) conduct that is clearly threatening to competition or clearly exclusionary.  
Proof of market power in the defendant may be relevant in establishing the requisite unreasonable conduct, but it is not 
essential.  Such proof may also be relevant, as some cases seem to establish, because it may serve as sufficient direct proof of 
dangerous probability of success.See CalComp, supra, 613 F.2d at 737; Sherman, supra, 601 F.2d at 453 n. 47; Janich Bros, 
supra, 570 F.2d at 853; Hallmark, supra, 489 F.2d at 12. See note 15 infra . "

Management Co ., 553 F.2d 620, 627 (9th Cir. 1977)."
825,13," Two commentators recently proposed a means of selecting rules directed against predatory conduct on a basis similar to this 
one.  Jaskow & Klevorick, A Framework for Analyzing Predatory Pricing Policy, 89 Yale L.J. 213 (1979)."
825,14," As we already have noted, this description of conduct draws upon standards developed in the context of section 1 of the 
Sherman Act. However, section 2 of the Act encompasses a broader range of conduct.  For example, unlike section 1, section 2 
is not limited to concerted or contractual activity.  CalComp, supra, 613 F.2d at 737; Moore v. Jas. H. Matthews & Co ., 473 F.2d 
328, 332 (9th Cir. 1972). Actions taken by a single firm which attempts to monopolize may have no obvious counterparts in the 
case law of section 1.  However, by drawing upon section 1 we have given general direction to the construction of section 2.  
Thus, we have held that the ""reasonableness"" standard of section 1 is to control the analysis of most conduct from which 
specific intent to monopolize may be inferred. CalComp, supra, 613 F.2d at 737. The remainder of this section elaborates on that 
concept."
825,15," As our earlier discussion of the first two elements of the attempt claim recognizes, several cases have also suggested that 
HN12[
] the type of conduct sufficient to establish attempted monopolization may vary with the market power of the defendant.  
E.g., Hunt-Wesson, supra, 627 F.2d at 925; CalComp, supra, 613 F.2d at 737 & n.11; Purex Corp. v. Procter & Gamble Co ., 
596 F.2d 881, 890 (9th Cir. 1979); Janich Bros., supra, 570 F.2d at 854 n.4. This general proposition may prove accurate in 
particular cases, but we do not read our decisions as establishing any necessary or specific connection between a defendant's 
market power and the type of conduct a plaintiff must prove in support of its attempt claim.  A plaintiff may show that proof of 
market power is relevant to an accurate understanding of a particular defendant's conduct, but the general standards for conduct 
that we discuss in the text must be the ultimate touchstone.  We note that the present case is not one in which it is necessary to 
specify the connection between market power and conduct."
825,16," We have frequently referred to such activity as conduct ""without legitimate business purpose."" Janich Bros., supra, 570 F.2d at 
853; Greyhound Computer Corp. v. IBM Corp ., 559 F.2d 488, 505 (9th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1040, 98 S.Ct. 782, 54 "

12."
826,17," This judgment was based largely on the fact that Inglis' expert did not make an independent analysis of Continental's costs to 
determine which were variable and which were fixed.  461 F.Supp. at 419. Instead, Inglis' counsel provided the expert with a list 
of those costs he was to consider variable, based on a similar list which appeared in Janich Bros., Inc. v. American Distilling Co., 
supra . The district court obviously was not convinced that these costs were actually variable in Continental's case.  See 461 
F.Supp. at 418. This same conviction appears to have been the basis for the court's decision o grant JNOV.  If the Janich 
categories were to control, then the resulting calculation of average variable cost, in the court's opinion, would ""distort"" the actual 
conditions confronting Continental in the sense that Continental was able to ""maximize profits"" at a nonpredatory price that was 
nonetheless below average variable cost.  The court therefore concluded that without proof of prices below marginal cost, Inglis 
could not prove that Continental's prices were predatory. See id . at 418-19 & n.7."
826,18," Narrow objective standards for establishing predatory pricing pose special risks consisting of the possibility that either some 
competitive behavior will be condemned or that some predatory activity will be condoned.  It may be argued that reduction of this 
latter risk can be achieved by reliance on direct evidence of predatory intent.  As already explained, however, reliance on 
evidence of intent when objective evidence of conduct is either ambiguous or nonexistent embodies its own risks.  Accord, In re 
E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co ., FTC Docket No. 9108 (Oct. 20, 1980), reprinted in Antitrust & Trade Reg. Rep. No. 987, at F-5 
(Oct. 30, 1980) (""[I]ntent is a barren issue without consideration of the means contemplated for acquiring monopoly power.  It is 
simply unrealistic to divorce conduct from intent."") The proper way to minimize all risks is to eschew dogmatic adherence to a 
particular, rigid test and to fashion broad and flexible objective standards concerned with accurately evaluating the purposes of 
business behavior."
826,19," This standard has received approval in the academic community, although more specific economic tests remain a matter of 
dispute.  See, e.g ., R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox: A Policy at War with Itself 144 (1978); L. Sullivan, supra note 8, § 43, at 108, "
827,113," ; Areeda & Turner, Predatory Pricing and Related Practices Under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 88 Harv.L.Rev. 697, 698 
(1975); Joskow & Klevorick, supra note 13, at 220 & n.22."
827,20," Most commentators who have attempted to develop economic tests of predatory pricing have assumed that the goal of these 
tests should be the efficient allocation of society's resources, or, in the language of welfare economics, the improvement of 
allocative efficiency.  See, e.g ., Areeda & Turner, supra note 19, at 712; Areeda & Turner, Williamson on Predatory Pricing, 87

Williamson, Predatory Pricing: A Strategic and Welfare Analysis, 87 Yale L.J. 284, 289 (1977)."
827,21," Areeda and Turner make an exception for the case in which marginal cost exceeds average total cost. In this exceptional case 
the price ""floor"" is average total cost.  Areeda & Turner, supra, note 19, at 713."
827,22," They argue that even when the two cost measures diverage, average variable cost is the proper test for predatory pricing. 
Their justifications for this position seem contradictory to the resource allocation policies that they rely upon in support of the 
marginal cost test.  For example, although Areeda and Turner may be correct that pricing below average variable cost should be 
condemned because such a price rarely will be loss-minimizing, see id . at 717, on their view marginal cost pricing would still 
seem to be justifiable because it promotes proper resource allocation."

827,25," For example, Areeda and Turner now favor a categorical determination of variable costs, in which the authors label as 
""variable"" cost items that they admit are ""to varying degrees… really 'fixed.'"" 3 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law P715c, at 
173-74, 176 (1978). "
828,26," In Pierce Packing Co. v. John morrell & Co ., 633 F.2d 1362 (9th Cir. 1980), the appellant argued that the district court erred in 
failing to instruct the jury on this method of establishing predation.  The appellant, however, had failed to raise the objection at 
trial and the sole issue was whether the question could nevertheless be raised on appeal.  Applying the standard of Robinson v. 
Heilman, 563 F.2d 1304, 1307 (9th Cir. 1977), we held that it could not.  As was necessary to this result, we found that ""[t]he 
barrier to entry exception was certainly not foreclosed by a solid wall of circuit authority prior to the time the jury retired."" 633 
F.2d at 1366-67. We believe the question is still an open one."
828,27," In Pierce Packing Co. v. John Morrell & Co., supra, the appellant argued that the Areeda-Turner test was not the exclusive 
method of proving predatory pricing, and offered two alternative tests.  Pierce Packing, however, did not reach the merits of that 
argument because the appellant's failure to object at trial precluded it from raising the issue on appeal.  See 633 F.2d at 1366-
67. The issue of predatory pricing also was raised in another recent case, Murphy Tugboat Co. v. Crowley, slip op. p. 2044, 658 
F.2d 1256, No. 79-4266 (9th Cir. May 11, 1981).  Both plaintiff and defendant were tugboat companies in the business of 
assisting ships to dock and undock in Sans Franciscod Bay. Many of defendant's tugboat masters also were licensed inland 
pilots.  They provided piloting services, for a separate fee, to defendant's customers in conjunction with ship assisting services.  
The fee charged for this service was established by agreement between defendant and an association of defendant's 
employees.  The fees thus charged generally were lower than fees charged by independent pilots, who were used by plaintiff's 
customers. Plaintiff alleged that the agreement establishing piloting fees was an unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of 
Sherman § 1, and won a jury verdict to that effect.  The district court granted JNOV in defendant's favor.  We affirmed. "
829,," Because plaintiff was not in the business of providing piloting services, we determined that the fee agreement could be judged 
only as a means employed by defendant to reduce the overall price of a package of services consisting of piloting and ship 
assisting.  The evidence indicated that defendant's package cost was twice as high as the average package cost of using 
plaintiff plus a more expensive independent pilot.  Plaintiff argued, however, that but for the agreement this package price would 
have been higher still, enabling plaintiff to earn higher revenues on its own ship assisting services.Nevertheless, we held that the 
agreement could be considered an unreasonable restraint of trade only if it was ""in furtherance of a scheme of predatory 
pricing."" Slip op. at 2047, 659 F.2d at 1259. We concluded that JNOV was warranted because plaintiff had failed even to allege 
that defendant's package price was below marginal cost.  Id .  Indeed, the district court noted that defendant's prices ""exceeded 
average variable costs, exceeded the prices charged by plaintiff, and generally even produced a net profit."" Murphy Tugboat Co. 
v. Shipowners & Merchants Towboat Co ., 467 F.Supp. 841, 861 n.16 (N.D.Cal.1979). We do not consider our decision today to be inconsistent with Murphy Tugboat .  There is no indication that the issue squarely 
presented to us -- whether a case of predatory pricing can ever be established without proof of pricing below marginal or 
average variable cost -- was presented to or considered in Murphy Tugboat .  We decline to read that case as deciding the issue 
sub silentio .  Our preceding discussion has also demonstrated that the decisions on which Murphy Tugboat relied without 
elaboration -- Pierce Packing, CalComp, Janich Bros ., and Hanson -- left the question an open one.  Finally, for all that appears, 
plaintiff in Murphy Tugboat alleged nothing more than the act that the agreement between defendant and its employees left 
defendant's prices lower than they otherwise would have been.  The holding that such an allegation cannot establish an 
unreasonable restraint of trade for purposes of section 1 of the Sherman Act certainly does not foreclose the inquiry which we 
have undertaken here."
829,28," See Markovits, supra note 21, at 578, 594; Markovits, Some Preliminary Notes on the Antitrust Laws' Economic Tests of 
Legality, 27 Stan.L.Rev. 841 (1975)."
829,29," We emphasize that this test is not meant to condemn all pricing that is not profit-maximizing in the short run.  Pricing of this 
sort may be legitimate, competitive behavior under certain circumstances.  See, e.g ., Areeda & Turner, supra note 19, at 
704.Pricing is predatory if its benefits depend on its anticipated tendency to eliminate competition.  pricing that is not profit-
maximizing in the short run may be predatory, but it may also be justifiable without regard to its effect on competition.  In other 
words, pricing may legitimately be justified on long-term considerations, as long as those do not include the anticipation of 
enhanced market power as a result of predation."
829,30," Average total cost reflects that portion of the firm's total costs -- both fixed and variabe -- attributable on an average basis to 
each unit of output. When the price of each unit equals or exceeds average total cost, the seller is recovering the total cost of 
production and is earning at least a ""normal"" rate of return on invested capital. We emphasize that this case does not concern the possibility of proving predatory conduct when a defendant's prices equal or 
exceed average total cost -- that is, when they are ""profitable"" in the economist's sense of the term.  We express no opinion on 
the permissibility of such a claim. "
830,31," Such conditions exist when the firm is producing below the level of output at which average total cost is minimized.See Areeda 
& Turner, supra note 19, at 710 & n.32."
830,32," Continuing production may be a rational loss-minimizing strategy even in this case if the firm has reason to believe ""that the 
excess capacity is temporary and that the start-up costs incurred in the future when full-scale production resumes will be much 
greater if the firm ceases production now than if it stays in business even though not covering its variable costs."" Jaskow & 
Klevorick, supra note 13, at 251 n.77.  Of course, we express no view about the frequency with which this case occurs, nor do 
we foreclose the possibility of other legitimate justifications for a price below average variable cost.  We hold only that HN20[
] 
the presumption of illegality created by proof of pricing below average variable cost is rebuttable."
830,35," Before the new pricing policy could get Hanson to the jury as a possible attempt to monopolize, Hanson had to establish that 
the new policy represented ""predatory pricing"" designed to drive competitors out of the market and establish monopoly benefits 
for Shell.  This he has made no attempt to do. "
831,," …  [F]or all that appears Shell's new pricing policies were nothing more than an attempt to gain a larger share of the market 
because of its stronger competitive position. Hanson, supra, 541 F.2d at 1358.Similarly, the Janich court found, inter alia, that the plaintiff had failed to introduce any 
evidence of actual sales below cost or evidence that the defendant's prices were not legitimate responses to competition.  See 
570 F.2d at 857. We also note, for reasons previously mentioned, that neither Pierce Packing Co. v. John Morrell & Co ., 633 F.2d 1362 (9th Cir. 
1980), nor Murphy Tugboat Co. v. Crowley, slip op. p. 2044, 658 F.2d 1256, No. 79-4266 (9th Cir. May 11, 1981), forecloses 
the result we reach today.  See note 27 supra ."
831,36," The CalComp opinion emphasized that the plaintiff had failed ""to introduce any evidence to controvert IBM's substantial proof 
that its price cuts were highly profitable."" 613 F.2d at 743."
831,37," The fact that a price is just sufficient to recover the cost of producing the marginal unit of output says nothing about whether 
that price, if charged across the board to all customers, will generate revenues sufficient to recover total costs or even out-of-
pocket costs over the range of actual output.Only a comparison of price to average variable or average total cost can yield that 
answer.  An excess capacity situation may justify average-variable-cost pricing, but it is unrealistic to say, even in that situation, 
that no price above marginal cost can be predatory."
831,38," Areeda and Turner advocate the arbitrary assignment of all costs to the variable cost category with the exception of capital 
costs, property and other taxes unaffected by output, and depreciation of plant.  3 P. Areeda & D.  Turner, supra note 25, P715c, 
at 173-74.  The authors admit that this allocation includes ""several elements that to varying degrees are really 'fixed,'"" id . at 176, 
but defend it on the basis of administrative convenience and the otherwise relative permissiveness of their marginal cost rule, id . 
at 172-74. "
832,39," The principal dispute in the trial court was whether expenses such as truck rental and wages for workers and drivers 
committed to the production and distribution of private label bread should be considered variable. Such costs were among those 
typically considered variable in Janich .  Continental argued, however, that increased production of private label bread merely 
filled excess oven time and truck space already available and that the only cost items that properly could be considered variable 
were ingredients.  Wrappers, fuel, and salesmen's commissions.  If these costs were the only ones that actually increased as a 
result of the price reduction, and if the prices were sufficient to recover them, then there is less reason to infer predation than 
Inglis maintains.Of course, as we discuss later it may be that Continental avoided other commercially reasonable means of 
minimizing losses that would have been more effective, and this fact would strengthen the inference of predation.  However, we 
intimate no view on the accuracy of these assertions.  They are proper subjects for investigation on remand."
832,40," The defendant must be allowed, however, to rebut this inference by proving nonpredatory reasons for the price alleged to be 
predatory."
832,41," Of course, average variable cost is not to be calculated by aggregating all cost items demonstrated to be variable under a 
range of plausible alternatives.  By so aggregating all alternatives it would be possible to characterize all of the firm's costs as 
variable. Instead, the determination of which items of costs are to be considered variable must be accomplished by examining 
each alternative, one at a time, assuming that more than one reasonable loss-minimizing alternative existed. "
833,42," In that decision we rejected a ""contention that Janich adopted a rigid definition of those costs which may be considered in 
ascertaining fixed costs,"" and upheld the trial court's instruction that the determination of fixed costs was a question of fact for 
the jury.  633 F.2d at 1365."
833,43," Of course, Inglis was not required to prove by direct evidence that Continental did adopt the McKinsey suggestions.  But that 
fact cannot be inferred merely from evidence of prices below average total cost, and, in any case, illegal intent still would not be 
established without further proof that the prices were without legitimate business justification. We decline to rule on the admissibility either of the McKinsey report, as Continental has urged, or on notes of ITT-Continental 
discussions prepared by Mr. Daniel of McKinsey, as Inglis appears to urge.  Our discussion should not be construed as 
intimating any view on admissibility of either set of materials.  Moreover, our evaluation of the evidence of predatory conduct is 
without consideration of the Daniel notes, which were excluded by the trial judge. "
834,44," 15 U.S.C.  § 13(a) (1976).  Section 2(a) provides, in relevant part: HN26[
] It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, either directly or indirectly, 
to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality, where either or any of the 
purchases involved in such discrimination are in commerce,… and where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially 
to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any 
person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them…."
834,45," The district court found, however, that these interstate differences in price were short-lived, involved de minimis amounts of 
sales, and thus could not have established the effect on competition required by § 2(a)."
834,46," Continental does not dispute on appeal that its advertised and private label products were ""commodities of like grade and 
quality,"" as required by § 2(a).  We express no view on that subject."

835,48," Section 2(a) also proscribes price discrimination with the requisite adverse effect on secondary-line competition (between 
customers of the price discriminator) and tertiary-line competition (between customers of the price discriminator's customers).In 
addition, the Supreme Court has identified a fourth level of competition within the ambit of § 2(a): competition between 
customers of customers of the ""favored"" purchaser.  See Perkins v. Standard Oil Co ., 395 U.S. 642, 89 S.Ct. 1871, 23 L.Ed.2d

835,50," In Utah Pie, a primary-line § 2(a) case, the Supreme Court stated that ""a jury would be free to ascertain a seller's intent from 
surrounding economic circumstances, which would include persistent unprofitable sales below cost and drastic price cuts 
themselves discriminatory."" 386 U.S. at 696 n.12, 87 S.Ct. at 1332 n.12.Inglis has relied strongly on this language in arguing that 
proof of Continental's pricing below average total cost is sufficient to sustain the jury's verdict.  While we agree that in certain 
circumstances such proof will support the inference of predatory intent, we do not view Utah Pie as dispositive.Although the 
Court later referred to the defendant's prices as less than its ""direct cost plus an allocation for overhead,"" id . at 698, 87 S.Ct. at 
1333, there is no indication that the Court meant to establish average total cost as the immutable dividing line in all Robinson-
Patman Act cases.  Indeed, in a case concerning § 3 of the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C.  § 13a (1976), which directly 
proscribes ""unreasonably low prices,"" the Court held that not every sale below cost is illegal.  ""Such sales are not condemned 
when made in furtherance of a legitimate commercial objective, such as the liquidation of excess obsolete or perishable 
merchandise, or the need to meet a lawful, equally low price of a competitor….  Sales below cost in these instances would be 
neither 'unreasonably low' now made with predatory intent."" United States v. National Dairy Products Corp ., 372 U.S. 29, 36-37,

838,56," The district court agreed with Continental that its Nevada sales were de minimis, when compared to continental's total sales 
from its northern California bakeries. 461 F.Supp. at 420. The court's holding, however, was in the context of an analysis that 
segmented the market and then found the Nevada sales to be too insignificant to substantiate the claimed adverse effect on 
competition required by § 2(a).Examining those sales alone, we agree with the district court.  However, in determining whether 
Continental's price discrimination had the required effect on competition, all of the discriminatory sales, both in Nevada and 
California, must be examined.  The effect on competition of the price discrimination of either Nevada or California sales alone is 
a different question from the issue of jurisdiction.  Although some courts have applied a de minimis principle to the jurisdictional 
aspect of § 2(a), see Food Basket, Inc. v. Albertson's, Inc ., 383 F.2d 785, 788 (10th Cir. 1967); Zoslow v. Columbia 
Broadcasting System, Inc ., 1977-2 Trade Cas. P61,756, at 73,126 (N.D.Cal.1976); Baldwin Hills Building Material Co. v. 
Fibreboard Paper Products Corp ., 283 F.Supp. 202, 204-05 (C.D.Cal.1968), they have done so when the interstate sales were 
merely inadvertent or incidental to defendant's basically intrastate business.  However, when the defendant is an interstate 
corporation engaged in a multistate marketing operation, interstate sales made in the course of that operation and involving the 
same products and price differentials as are found in defendant's intrastate transactions, are sufficient to establish jurisdiction, 
even when those sales are insignificant in relation to the total sales under examination. "
840,57," Each buyer who represented to Continental that he had received a competitive offer was required to so state in writing or in 
the presence of witnesses.  A form was then completed which required the signatures not only of the route salesman who had 
received notice of the competitive offer from the purchaser, but of the general manager of the bakery serving that customer, the 
regional vice-president, the regional comptroller, the divisional vice-president, and a member of Continental's legal department.  
Only then would Continental extend a price discount on its advertised bread to the buyer.  This procedure was employed 
regardless of the size of the discount or the size of the purchase to which the discount applied.  Moreover, the discount was 
limited to the customer whose report of a competitive offer had been verified."
840,58," The record indicates that Continental did verify that certain of its accounts had received offers of price discounts from 
competitors. This was accomplished through personal conversations between Continental's regional vicepresident and buyers 
from its private label accounts.  Continental maintains that it was unnecessary to use the formal verification procedures normally 
used for advertised label price discounts.  In the case of private label discounts, fewer accounts were involved and 
communications between Continental and the chain stores involved persons in higher levels of the managerial hierarchy in both 
organizations than normally occurred in the case of advertised label discounts.  Continental apparently believed that these 
conversations provided a more reliable basis for verifying that competitive offers had occurred, and thus that formal 
documentation was unnecessary.  Nevertheless, once Continental had verified that some of its accounts had received 
competitive offers, it extended equally low offers not only to those accounts, but to other existing and potential customers without 
verifying that they too had actually received competitive offers. "
841,59," Other grocery stores and bakeries apparently learned of the 18-cent offer from copies of Campbell-Taggart's letter to 
Albertson's confirming the offer.  The record does not indicate how the letter became public or how it was circulated."
841,60," Because the district court applied a one-year statute of limitations, an action the parties do not dispute, the state law claim 
applied to only two periods, one dating from Inglis' filing of its original and first amended complaint, and the other from the filing 
of its supplemental complaint.  As we discuss infra, the gap between the two periods was the result of the district court's refusal 
to allow the supplemental complaint to ""relate back"" to the date of the first amended complaint. "
842,61," Section 17026 provides,in relevant part: ""HN41[
] 'Cost' as applied to production includes the cost of raw materials, labor and all overhead expenses of the producer."" Section 17029 defines ""overhead expense"" as HN42[
] all costs of doing business incurred in the conduct of the business and shall include without limitation the following 
items of expense: labor (including salaries of executives and officers), rent, interest on borrowed capital, depreciation, selling 
cost, maintenance of equipment, delivery costs, credit losses, all type of licenses, taxes, insurance and advertising. In addition, § 17073 provides, in relevant part: HN43[
] Proof of average overall cost of doing business for any particular inventory period when added to the cost of 
production of each article or product, as to a producer,… is presumptive evidence of cost of each article or product involved in 
any action brought under this chapter."
842,62," As the Supreme Court has recently reaffirmed, even if Congress has not completely foreclosed state legislation in a particular 
area, HN44[
] a state statute is void to the extent that it actually conflicts with a valid federal statute.A conflict will be found ""where 
compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility…,"" Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 
373 U.S. 132, 142-143 [83 S.Ct. 1210, 1217, 10 L.Ed.2d 248] (1963), or where the state ""law stands as an obstacle to the 
accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress."" Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 67, 61 S.Ct.

Rath Packing Co., 430 U.S. 519, 526, 97 S.Ct. 1305, 1310, 51 L.Ed.2d 604 (1977). However, federal courts are ""generally 
reluctant to infer preemption"" and must scrupulously avoid ""'seeking out conflicts between state and federal regulation where 
none clearly exists.'"" Exxon Corp. v. Governor of Maryland, 437 U.S. 117, 130, 132, 98 S.Ct. 2207, 2216, 2217, 57 L.Ed.2d 91 
(1978) (quoting Huron Portland Cement Co. v. Detroit, 362 U.S. 440, 446, 80 S.Ct. 813, 817, 4 L.Ed.2d 852 (1960)). "
843,63," Section 17071 provides: HN48[
] In all actions brought under this chapter proof of one or more acts of selling or giving away any article or product 
below cost or at discriminatory prices, together with proof of the injurious effect of such acts, is presumptive evidence of the 
purpose or intent to injure competitors or destroy competition. Although the statute does not define ""injurious effect,"" evidence of which is necessary to raise the presumption, the California 
courts have interpreted it to mean ""injury to a competitor or destruction of competition,"" consistent with the language of § 17043.  
People v. Pay Less Drug Stores, 25 Cal.2d 108, 113, 153 P.2d 9, 12 (1944)."
843,64," The inference of preemption is especially inappropriate because the basic purposes of the state and federal statutes are 
similar. See Exxon Corp. v. Governor of Maryland, supra, 437 U.S. at 132-33, 98 S.Ct. at 2217. The California statute was 
designed to ""safeguard the public against the creation or perpetuation of monopolies and to foster and encourage competition."" 
Cal.Bus. & Prof.Code § 17001 (West 1964) (statement of legislative purpose); Harris v. Capitol Records Distributing Corp ., 64 
Cal.2d 454, 461, 413 P.2d 139, 144, 50 Cal.Rptr. 539, 544 (1969). The purposes of the Sherman Act hardly could be stated 
more succinctly.  Even if, as Continental Contends, California's means of pursuing this end has a dampening effect on price 
competition, this does not warrant preemption.  ""For if an adverse effect on competition were, in and of itself, enough to render a 
state statute invalid, the States' power to engage in economic regulation would be effectively destroyed."" Exxon Corp. v. 
Governor of Maryland, supra, 437 U.S. at 133, 98 S.Ct. at 2217; New Motor Vehicle Board v. Orrin W. Fox Co ., 439 U.S. 96, 
110-11, 99 S.Ct. 403, 412, 58 L.Ed.2d 361 (1978). Murphy Tugboat Co. v. Crowley, 454 F.Supp. 847 (N.D.Cal.1978), does not persuade us to reach a different result.  That case 
concerned solely the permissibility of a particular measure of damages; the court assumed the existence of liability.  Id . at 850. 
One of the questions was whether plaintiff could recover lost revenues caused by defendant's assumed failure to raise its prices 
above fully allocated costs, as required by § 17043 of the California Unfair Practices Act. The district court held that this measure 
of damages ""would tend to inhibit and penalize the legitimate price competition sought by the Sherman Act to such an extent that 
it cannot be permitted."" Id . at 858. The court was careful to note that its decision should not be taken as a ruling on the validity 
of the California statute, which is the only question we have considered. "
844,65," Section 17050 provides, in relevant part: HN49[
] The prohibitions of this chapter against locality discriminations, sales below cost, and loss leaders do not apply to any 
sale made: (d) In an endeavor made in good faith to meet the legal prices of a competitor selling the same article or product, in the same 
locality or trade area and in the ordinary channels of trade. (e) In an endeavor made in good faith by a manufacturer, selling an article or product of his own manufacture, in a transaction 
and sale to a wholesaler or retailer for resale to meet the legal prices of a competitor selling the same or a similar or comparable 
article or product, in the same locality or trade area and in the ordinary channels of trade. To the extent that the California ""meeting-competition"" defense differs from § 2(b) of the Robinson-Patman Act, those 
differences do not alter our conclusion in this case."
844,66," Continental also argues that JNOV was justified because Inglis allegedly failed to prove that Continental's prices were 
intended to ""injur[e] competitors or destroy[] competition."" Although such proof is necessary to plaintiff's prima facie case under § 
17043, we do not find that Inglis' proof was so insufficient that JNOV was warranted, especially in light of § 17071, which 
establishes a presumption of illegal intent once plaintiff has introduced both evidence of prices below fully allocated cost and 
proof of economic injury. "
845,67," Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides, in part: HN52[
] Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint or trade or commerce among 
the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. "
846,68," The court declined to grant summary judgment on the alleged horizontal conspiracy between the named defendant baking 
companies.  However, Inglis withdrew this claim during the trial."
846,69," In reaching this conclusion we have adhered to the rule that HN53[
] ""[s]ummary judgment is properly awarded when there is 
no genuine issue of material fact or where, viewing the evidence and the inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable 
to the party opposing the motion, the moving party clearly is entitled to prevail as a matter of law."" Vaughn v. Teledyne, Inc ., 628 
F.2d 1214, 1218 (1980). We note that Inglis does not contend that the grant of summary judgment resulted in the exclusion of 
any evidence that reasonably would have been introduced had the court allowed it to present its conspiracy claims to the jury.  
Nor is there any contention that presentation of the conspiracy claims would have added to the damage claim; all of Inglis' claims 
relied on the same conduct by Continental. Finally, neither ITT nor McKinsey were named as parties defendant. "
847,70," The district court could have considered Inglis' allegations as a motion to amend the proceedings to add an additional 
conspiracy claim pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a).  See Sherman v. Hallbauer, 455 F.2d 1236, 1242 (5th Cir. 1972). Amendments 
for the purpose of adding new claims are clearly permitted by Rule 15 and may be introduced and considered during the 
pendency of a motion for summary judgment.  6 Moore's Federal Practice P56.10 (2d ed. 1976).  ""Indeed at times it will be 
feasible to treat the pleading as though it were amended to conform to the facts set forth in the affidavits."" Id . at 56-171. HN54[
] Motions to amend the pleadings ""out of time"" are addressed to the discretion of the court, but ""leave shall be freely given when justice so requires."" Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a).  See Jacobson v. Rose, 592 F.2d 515, 519 (9th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 442 
U.S. 930, 99 S.Ct. 2861, 61 L.Ed.2d 298 (1979). Although several factors may be relevant in determining whether leave to 
amend should be granted, see Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962), the most important is 
whether amendment would result in undue prejudice to the opposing party, Howey v. United States, 481 F.2d 1187, 1190 (9th 
Cir. 1973). In this case Continental would not have been severely prejudiced by the addition of a conspiracy claim involving ITT 
and McKinsey.  Although the claim was raised on the eve of trial, delay in proposing amendment, without a showing of prejudice, 
is normally insufficient to justify denial of leave to amend.  Howey v. United States, supra, 481 F.2d at 1190-91; 6 C. Wright & A. 
Miller, supra, § 1488, at 438-39.  As previously noted, Continental had received notice of Inglis' claims one year before the trial 
commenced.And, as we explain in the text, we are convinced that Continental was not seriously prejudiced by consideration of 
the ""vertical"" conspiracy claim. "
849,71," Our holding should not be interpreted to mean that McKinsey's report was inadmissible as evidence of Continental's intent for 
purposes of Inglis' attempt to monopolize claim.  We express no views on that subject."
849,72," The district court decided that, in applying the statute of limitations to the supplemental complaint, Inglis' motion for leave to file 
would be the action tolling the statute, rather than the actual filing of the complaint after leave had been granted.  This ruling is 
not argued on appeal."
849,73," HN58[
] Federal antitrust claims are governed by a four-year statute of limitations.  15 U.S.C.  § 15b (1976). The damage period established by the filing of the original complaint, as amended, was October 1, 1967, through February 1, 1972.  The 
district court applied the same four-year limitation period to the claims alleged in the supplemental complaint.  This period began 
on February 7, 1973 (four years prior to the date on which Inglis moved for leave to file the supplemental complaint) and 
continued until April 6, 1976 (the date on which Inglis discontinued its bakery operations).  Thus, the gap between the two 
damage periods extended from February 2, 1972, through February 6, 1973. The parties agreed that the pendent state claims were governed by a one-year statute of limitations.  Thus the damage period 
tolled by the filing of the original and amended complaints was October 1, 1970, through February 1, 1972.The damage period 
tolled by the filing of the supplemental complaint began on February 7, 1976, and, again, extended until April 6, 1976, the date 
on which Inglis ceased operations.  This produced a four-year gap in the damage period for state claims consisting of the period 
February 2, 1972, through February 6, 1976. "
850,74," Professors Wright and Miller have explained that HN62[
] if the original pleading gave defendant notice that the conduct, transaction, or occurrence is of a continuing nature, he 
should be prepared to defend against all claims arising out of it, whether they arose before or after the original complaint was 
filed.  There is little basis to distinguish an amended and a supplemental pleading for purposes of relation back if defendant had 
notice of the subject matter of the dispute and was not prejudiced in preparing his defense.  Under these circumstances, the 
policy against stale claims becomes subsidiary to the policy expressed throughout the rules in favor of allowing a party to set 
forth all his grievances against another party in one action and resolving them on their merits."

852,1," Probability of success is admittedly not an ""essential"" element of an attempt-to-monopolize claim in this Circuit, since the 
probability may be inferred from proof of intent.  California Computer Prods. v. IBM, 613 F.2d 727, 737 (9th Cir. 1979); Lessig v.

that authorized the placement of broad anticompetitive restraints on the learned professions.  See, e.g., Head v. New Mexico

the presumptive unconstitutionality of advertising bans became apparent.  Virginia Pharmacy Bd. v. Virginia Consumer Council,

860,5," In explaining why Federal did not qualify to be a preceptor of pharmacist interns, the Iowa Board did not mention membership 
in any association.  There was evidence, however, that a pharmacy that scored below 85 on the state's annual Inspection and 
Rating Report could not be a preceptor, that the Report's forms deducted 10-15 points if the pharmacy belonged to neither the 
Iowa Association nor the American Pharmaceutical Association, and that Federal's scores were within 10 of the required 85.  Tr.

Resort to a malicious prosecution analogy is unavailing for Federal here, since there was no showing that any of the various 
proceedings American helped to institute against Federal were ""clearly unreasonable."" See id. at 728-29. Moreover, to succeed 
in an action for malicious prosecution the plaintiff must show that the earlier action against it failed.  Yet the proceedings of which 
Federal complains most vigorously are those that resulted in governmental action adverse to it.  Nor can Federal rely upon 
analogies to the tort of abuse of process.  Although that tort lies even for meritorious litigation, it lies only if the purpose of the 
defendant's litigation is collateral to and not the subject of his complaint.  Id. at 732. Here, American's avowed purpose in all 
relevant governmental proceedings was to stifle drug advertising or mail order pharmacy. Its anticompetitive purpose was not 
collateral to its invocation of governmental process but rather was inherent in it."

] The focus in a Noerr inquiry is on the conduct of the petitioners because the aim of the Noerr doctrine is to 
encourage legitimate exercises of the right to petition. The distinct but related goal of encouraging public-spirited official 
decisionmaking is served by the doctrine of official immunity, which in varying extents protects government officers from 
individual liability for their official acts.  It is with respect to official immunity (an issue not involved here inasmuch as no public 
official is a defendant) that there is a well-established distinction between ""legislative"" and ""administrative"" functions.  See e.g., 
Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 247, 94 S. Ct. 1683, 1691, 40 L. Ed. 2d 90 (1974) (while immunity for judges and legislator is

force that the district court erred in classifying the anti-mail order pharmacy campaign as a ""group boycott"" constituting a per se

not be determined, whether under a per se or a ""rule of reason"" analysis, given the lack of any demonstrated injury resulting 
from that conduct. "

threshold which must be crossed to put the question at issue.  If there is sufficient evidence to suggest that price discrimination 
may exist, then the ""prima facie case' is established.  The utility is then required to prove the absence of price discrimination.

it, could not pay the expenses of ""rolling"" the ""sheet"" and make a living profit out of the price at which ""Alcoa"" itself sold ""sheet."" 
To establish this the plaintiff asks us to take ""Alcoa's"" costs of ""rolling"" as a fair measure of its competitors' costs, and to assume 
that they had to meet ""Alcoa's"" price for all grades of ""sheet,"" and could not buy ingot elsewhere. "
879,," We note that Alcoa's own costs of rolling were used as a fair measure of its competitor's costs.  Here, competitor's costs were 
offered as a fair measure of CIPSCO's costs.  Although it may be, as Cities asserts, that its retail costs were lower than 
CIPSCO's, there was inadequate evidence in the record to prove that assumption.  Petitioners draw our attention to J.A. 136-39.  
Although the evidence there correctly indicated that if CIPSCO owned each of the Cities' distribution systems it would pay higher 
taxes, J.A. 136-38, the hypothetical itself merely assumed that CIPSCO would incur the same costs that Cities incurred."

return would probably be more accurate than a sample.  However, we do not find, as apparently the ALJ and FERC did not, that 
the sample indicated that there was need to conduct a full comparison of wholesale and retail rates of return.  Had the Staff 
study indicated otherwise, we assume that either a more exhaustive cost of service study would have been run or possibly a 
transfer price test would have been conducted."

] Under the price transfer test the vertically integrated company's costs of retail operations must be added to the 
product purchased at its wholesale rates to determine profitability, so the usefulness of that test depends upon an accurate 
identification of retail costs.  If the company fails to realize a profit under this test, indications are that retail costs have been 
improperly transferred to the wholesale operations, (or, less likely, retail operations are inefficient).  Under the methodology of 
the Staff study, wholesale and retail revenues over their respective incurred costs are compared.  This method of analysis also 
depends upon a proper identification of wholesale and retail costs.  If after wholesale and retail costs are fully allocated the 
company's wholesale profit margin is significantly greater than its retail profit margin, indications are that a price discrimination is 
occurring.  Both methods of analysis are acceptable methods of establishing a price squeeze case.  See J.A. at 625.  Although 
the results of a cost of service study are phrased in terms of a profit differential, see Memorandum By The Cities of Bethany, Et 
Al.  In Response To The ""Memorandum Amicus Curiae"" Filed By The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice at 4, like the 
price squeeze test, the cost of service study also seeks to determine whether the vertically integrated company maintains 
artificially high wholesale prices in order to squeeze out its retail competition.  If, after costs are fully allocated, it appears that the 
wholesale rate of return of a vertically integrated company is reasonable and, in fact, lower than retail rate of return, it would 
appear that wholesale customers are not being price squeezed-indeed, the higher the retail rate of return vis-a-vis the wholesale 
rate of return, the greater the wholesale customer's discount."

883,20," At oral argument, counsel for the Cities contended that the contract discrimination issue in this case differs from that in 
Rantoul because, unlike that case, there is no evidence here that the petitioners were offered and rejected the now favorable 
contract terms.  In this case, each city (with the exception of Carmi, Roodhouse and Bushnell, which began purchasing power 
from CIPSCO after it had ceased offering long-term contracts to customers, see J.A. 150-06 (cross-examination of Carl Wall, 
CIPSCO vice-president)) had had a contract similar to those still governing the sale of power to the cities of Marshall and 
Metropolis.  Because they had entered into the fixed rate, fixed term contracts at a date earlier than had Marshall and 
Metropolis, their contracts expired at an earlier date.  See J.A. 79 (cross-examination of Bruce Barnes, Jr., Cities' witness); J.A. 
105-06 (cross-examination of Carl Wall).  We view this factual dissimilarity as a distinction without a (legal) difference.  
Petitioners have still failed to demonstrate more than that a rate differential stemming ""from the fact that a public utility is free to 
file for unilateral rate increases with respect to some of its customers while the rate it charges to the remainder are frozen under 
the Mobile-Sierra doctrine"" exists; as we have made clear in previous cases, more is necessary to establish a violation of section 
205(b) of the Federal Power Act.  See Boroughs of Chambersburg v. FERC, 188 U.S. App. D.C. 310, 580 F.2d 573, 578 
(D.C.Cir.1978). The Cities agreed at oral argument that their tax normalization and demand allocation arguments were identical in all essential 
respects to those made in Rantoul.  Our review of the record reveals that petitioners in this action, like the petitioner in Rantoul, 
lack a substantial evidentiary basis for contending that the demand allocation method used failed to credit petitioners' for their 
generating capacity.  We likewise find without merit their argument that the Commission could not order rates collected subject 
to refund pending the outcome of a highly disputed rulemaking proceeding.  The Commission clearly has the discretion to adopt 
interim procedures which, if found inappropriate for any reason, will be remedied on a retroactive basis."
883,21," Petitioners claim they are unable to compete with CIPSCO's 9 and 9-B rates.  Retail rate 9 applies to sales to large light and 
power customers, primarily industrials.  To qualify for rate 9-B, customers must guarantee ""load,"" that is, a fairly constant 
demand, as well as high demand.  See J.A. 60 (additional testimony of Carl Wall)."
883,22," Petitioners in fact ask for a variety of remedies, which often conflict with one another, in their initial and reply briefs.  See Initial 
Brief of the Petitioners at 31 (asking for wholesale rate set at 1977 retail rate); id. at 35 (asking for rate calculated on 7.07% 
return); id. at 37 (asking for rate low enough to allow petitioners to compete for 9 and 9-B customers); Reply Brief for the 
Petitioners at 11 (wholesale rate should be 1977 retail rate ""adjusted for any cost savings and applicable tax law"").  We have 
taken the liberty of rephrasing their argument to correspond with the price squeeze remedy accepted by the Court in FPC v.

manufacturing of ""sheet."" Alcoa had a monopoly over the production of ingot which is used to manufacture sheet, but had 
competitors for its manufacturing function.  In applying the transfer price analysis the court assumed that the cost of 
manufacturing the sheet was the same for Alcoa and its competitors and found that since the competitor's total costs were 
greater than Alcoa's, Alcoa was charging more than a fair price of the ingot. Opinion No. 62, Southern California Edison Co. Opinion and Order on Rate Increases, FERC Docket No. ER76-205, Aug. 22,

887,47," Petitioners now challenge the accuracy of the study's allocation of costs of service between retail and wholesale customers. 
However, the majority of their challenges stem from their dissatisfaction with the way FERC has defined the cost of wholesale 
service in this proceeding, a definition which we uphold in its entirety in this appeal.  In addition, petitioners claim that the ratio of 
wholesale to retail costs may have changed in the two years since this study was conducted.  However, the Cities have not 
indicated any reason aside from the passage of time why such ratios might have changed, see Initial Decision at 68, J.A. 414; in 
the absence of such evidence, we will not hold that the utilization of a two year old study for these purposes is per se 
unreasonable.  Two years is not so long a time that substantial changes can be presumed to have taken place.  Finally, 
petitioners allege that neither the ALJ nor the Staff examined the methodology of the study.  This assertion is belied by the 
record.  See Initial Decision at 68, J.A. 414; J.A. 13 (testimony of David Hedberg); J.A. 129-131 (cross-examination of James 
Bachman); Exhibit 9, J.A. 200-201 (Display A) (letter to Carl Wall from Arthur Anderson & Co. re cost of service study).  In view

an exhaustive comparison would probably be more accurate than a survey, however, the survey indicated that there was no 
need to conduct a full comparison of wholesale and retail rates of return.  Had the Staff study indicated otherwise, we assume 
that either a more exhaustive cost of service study would have been run or possibly a transfer price test would have been 
conducted."

888,53," HN14[
]  Under the price transfer test the vertically integrated company's costs of retail operations must be added to the 
product purchased at its wholesale rates to determine profitability, so the usefulness of that test depends upon an accurate 
identification of retail costs.  If the company fails to realize a profit under this test, indications are that retail costs have been 
improperly transferred to the wholesale operations (or, less likely, retail operations are inefficient).  Under the methodology of the 
Staff study, wholesale and retail revenues over their respective incurred costs are compared.  This method of analysis also 
depends upon a proper identification of wholesale and retail costs.  If, after wholesale and retail costs are fully allocated, the 
company's wholesale profit margin is significantly greater than its retail profit margin, indications are that a price discrimination is 
occuring.  Both methods of analysis are acceptable methods of establishing a price squeeze case.  See J.A. at 625.  Although 
the results of a cost of service study are phrased in terms of a profit differential, see Memorandum By The Cities of Bethany, Et 
Al.  In Response To The ""Memorandum Amicus Curiae"" Filed By The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice at 4, like the 
price squeeze test, the cost of service study also seeks to determine whether the vertically integrated company maintains 
artificially high wholesale prices in order to squeeze out its retail competition.  If, after costs are fully allocated, it appears that the 
wholesale rate of return of a vertically integrated company is reasonable and, in fact, lower than retail rate of return, it would 
appear that wholesale customers are not being price squeezed-indeed, the higher the retail rate of return vis-a-vis the wholesale 
rate of return, the greater the wholesale customer's discount."

888,56," See United States v. Alcoa, 148 F.2d at 437: The plaintiff's theory is that ""Alcoa"" consistently sold ingot at so high a price that the ""sheet rollers,"" who were forced to buy from 
it, could not pay the expenses of ""rolling"" the ""sheet"" and making a living profit out of the price at which ""Alcoa"" itself sold 
""sheet."" To establish this the plaintiff asks us to take ""Alcoa's"" costs of ""rolling"" as a fair measure of its competitors' costs, and to 
assume that they had to meet ""Alcoa's"" price for all grades of ""sheet,"" and could not buy ingot elsewhere. We note that Alcoa's own costs of rolling were used as a fair measure of its competitor's costs.  Here, competitor's costs were 
offered as a fair measure of CIPSCO's costs.  Although it may be, as Cities asserts, that its retail costs were lower than 
CIPSCO's, there was inadequate evidence in the record to prove that assumption.  Petitioners draw our attention to J.A. 136-39. "

Principles in Public Utility Industries 17, 33-34 (W. Sichel & T. Gies, eds. 1981)."
890,63," For instance, in times of increasing demand, a utility would have to open new plants each year to maintain a constant reserve 
capacity.  As pointed out by the Commission in another proceeding involving a similar question, it may be cheaper in the long 
run to take advantage of economies of scale by building larger plants at more infrequent intervals, thus resulting in excess 
capacity at portions of the building cycle.  See Opinion No. 63, supra note 50, J.A. 632-34; see also Initial Decision at 29, J.A. 
375."
890,64," The magnitude of the mismatch is not so great that we can conclude that CIPSCO's management was per se incompetent, or 
even that CIPSCO committed a gross error in judgment.  Moreover, it is unclear to what extent the mismatch will burden the 
ratepayers with extra costs.  The ALJ points out that CIPSCO is expected to sell most of its excess capacity to other utilities, and 
the revenues ""would necessarily redound to the benefit of ratepayers."" See Initial Decision at 31, J.A. 377.  One point troubles 
us, however. Because FERC sets rates in advance, if CIPSCO was expected to sell its excess generating capacity during the 
1978 calendar year, the expected revenues should have redounded to the ratepayers' benefit-that is, they should have been 
factored into the rates accepted by the Commission.  The ALJ's use of the future tense to describe the crediting of these 
revenues may have been a mere ""slip of the pen."" However, on remand, the Commission should check to ensure that any 
expected sale revenues were in fact credited against the sums to be raised from the ratepayers."
890,65," We note, however, that some state utility commissions as well as commentators have advanced a form of normalization, not 
unlike that which petitioners press here, as a more equitable way of sharing the risks of overforecasting utility demand.  This 
alternative involves charging maintenance and depreciation expenses on the excess capacity as above-the-line operating 
expenses to be paid by the ratepayers over a period of years until the capital investment has been repaid.  Because the excess 
capacity is not included in the rate base, however, shareholders do not receive any return on their investment.  See Trebing, 
supra note 77.  It may be that different rate treatments of excess capacity are not only justified, but necessary, to attain a ""just 
and reasonable"" price in other circumstances."

897,20," At oral argument, counsel for the Cities contended that the contract discrimination issue in this case differs from that in 
Rantoul because, unlike that case, there is no evidence here that the petitioners were offered and rejected the now favorable 
contract terms.  In this case, each city (with the exception of Carmi, Roodhouse and Bushnell, which began purchasing power 
from CIPSCO after it had ceased offering long-term contracts to customers, see J.A. 105-06 (cross-examination of Carl Wall, 
CIPSCO vice-president)) had had a contract similar to those still governing the sale of power to the cities of Marshall and 
Metropolis.  Because they had entered into the fixed rate, fixed term contracts at a date earlier than had Marshall and 
Metropolis, their contracts expired at an earlier date.  See J.A. 79 (cross-examination of Bruce Barnes, Jr., Cities' witness); J.A. 
105-06 (cross-examination of Carl Wall).  We view this factual dissimilarity as a distinction without a (legal) difference. "

respects to those made in Rantoul .  Our review of the record reveals that petitioners in this action, like the petitioner in Rantoul , 
lack a substantial evidentiary basis for contending that the demand allocation method used failed to credit petitioners' for their 
generating capacity.  We likewise find without merit their argument that the Commission could not order rates collected subject

interim procedures which, if found inappropriate for any reason, will be remedied on a retroactive basis."
898,21," Petitioners claim they are unable to compete with CIPSCO's 9 and 9-B rates.  Retail rate 9 applies to sales to large light and 
power customers, primarily industrials.To qualify for rate 9-B, customers must guarantee ""load,"" that is, a fairly constant demand, 
as well as high demand.  See J.A. 60 (additional testimony of Carl Wall)."
898,22," Petitioners in fact ask for a variety of remedies, which often conflict with one another, in their initial and reply briefs.See Initial 
Brief of the Petitioners at 31 (asking for wholesale rate set at 1977 retall rate); id . at 35 (asking for rate calculated on 7.07 %

Petitioners at 11 (wholesale rate should be 1977 retail rate ""adjusted for any cost savings and applicable tax law"").  We have 
taken the liberty of rephrasing their argument to correspond with the price squeeze remedy accepted by the Court in FPC v. 
Conway Corp., 426 U.S. 271, 278-79 (1976)."
898,23," 148 F.2d 416 (2d Cir. 1945). The Commission summarized Alcoa's mandate as follows: In Alcoa , the court found that the company was engaged in two distinct activities: The production of ""ingot"" and the 
manufacturing of ""sheet."" Alcoa had a monopoly over the production of ingot which is used to manufacture sheet, but had 
competitors for its manufacturing function.  In applying the transfer price analysis the court assumed that the cost of 
manufacturing the sheet was the same for Aloca and its competitors and found that since the competitor's total costs were 
greater than Alcoa's, Alcoa was charging more than a fair price of the ingot. "

investigations, thus retroactively reducing rates, see Note, The Applicability of Antitrust Laws to Price Squeezes in the Electric 
Utility Industry , 54 St. John's L. Rev. 103, 109-10 (1979); see also Brief for Intervenor CIPSCO at 37 (detailing procedure of 
Illinois Commerce Commission), a utility may be unsure of what rates are in effect at any given time until long after the fact.  
Ruling that they must wait out this lag time before proposing new increases, in this era of rising fuel costs and inflation, would be 
truly unreasonable."
900,34," In Cities of Batavia v. FPC, 548 F.2d 1056 (D.C. Cir. 1977), this court considered and remanded to the Commission for 
reconsideration a price squeeze complaint arising from a ten-month period in which wholesale prices exceeded comparable 
retail rates.  Obviously, the longer an objectionable price differential exists, the more likely it is that anticompetitive affects will 
result and the more unwilling we will be to gloss over the fact that such a differential existed by relying on ""annualized"" rate 
tables."

902,47," Petitioners now challenge the accuracy of the study's allocation of costs of service between retail and wholesale customers. 
However, the majority of their challenges stem from their dissatisfaction with the way FERC has defined the cost of wholesale 
service in this proceeding, a definition which we uphold in its entirety in this appeal. In addition, petitioners claim that the ratio of 
wholesale to retail costs may have changed in the two years since this study was conducted.  However, the Cities have not 
indicated any reason aside from the passage of time why such ratios might have changed, see Initial Decision at 68, J.A. 414; in 
the absence of such evidence, we will not hold that the utilization of a two year old study for these purposes is per se 
unreasonable.  Two years is not so long a time that substantial changes can be presumed to have taken place.  Finally, 
petitioners allege that neither the ALJ nor the Staff examined the methodology of the study.  This assertion is belied by the 
record.  See Initial Decision at 688 J.A. 414; J.A. 13 (testimony of David Hedberg); J.A. 129-131 (cross-examination of James 
Bachman); Exhibit 9, J.A. 200-201 (Display A) (letter to Carl Wall from Arthur Anderson & Co. re cost of service study).  In view 
of the total lack of evidence that extrapolation from this study would lead to distorted results, we accept the Commission's 
decision to utilize it as a reasonable exercise of its discretion."

904,67," See id .  (""The Commission must arrive at a rate level deemed by it to be just and reasonable …"") (emphasis supplied).  
Indeed, it is unclear that the Commission has the statutory authority to reduce a utility's return any further.  See 16 U.S.C.  § 
824e(a) (""the Commission shall determine the just and reasonable rate… and shall fix the same by order"")."
904,68," See Initial Decision at 68-70, J.A. 414-16."
904,69," We express no opinion on the question of whether evidence exists on the record to support a finding that the wholesale rate of 
return is at the lower end of the range of reasonableness. The argument was not made to the court."
904,70," No one contested the fact that the challenged rate in Conway , standing alone, was just and reasonable.  The question 
presented by the case was whether the effect of that rate, given rates already in operation, would be anticompetitive, and 
therefore if the rate could be rendered unjust and unreasonable by its context. See FPC v. Conway Corp., supra , 426 U.S. at 
278-79. In fact, the FPC itself recognized that the regulatory context within which a rate was enacted could have an impact on its 
""just and reasonable"" nature.  See In re Otter Tail Power Co., 2 F.P.C. 134, 149 (1940): It occurs to us that one rate in its relation to another rate may be discriminatory, although each rate per se , if considered 
independently, might fall within the zone of reasonableness. There is considerable latitude within the zone of reasonableness 
insofar as the level of a particular rate is concerned.  The relationship of rates within such a zone, however, may result in an 
undue advantage in favor of one rate and be discriminatory insofar as another rate is concerned.  When such a situation exists, 
the discrimination found to exist must be removed. "
905,71," The Commission's error, never as far as we can tell completely rectified in any of the cases before it in which this issue was 
presented, was to confuse discriminatory impact with differential rates of return.  The Commission concludes time after time that 
a price squeeze cannot exist if a price differential with a discriminatory impact is ""cost justified,"" that is, results in a ""reasonable"" 
(defined as the same as or less than the rate gleaned from retail sales) rate of return. However, the whole point of Conway was 
that HN6[
] ""just and reasonable rates"" -- ""cost justified"" rates -- may have undesirable and even unacceptable anticompetitive 
effects.  In such cases, the Commission must at least consider reducing the rate of return to the ""lower end of the range of 
reasonableness."" The fact that a utility does not earn a higher rate of return from its wholesale than it retail customers is 
irrelevant to the question of whether a particular rate has anticompetitive effects (although if it earns a higher return it may be 
prima facie evidence of a price squeeze according to the Commission's analysis, see note 55 supra ).  It is only relevant insofar 
as it is indicative of the existence of an affirmative defense."
905,72," For instance, if FERC concluded that the only reason a competitor could not compete for retail customers given FERC's 
preferred wholesale rate was because the competitor was mismanaged or paid its executives excessive salaries, FERC might 
determine that leaving the proposed wholesale rates intact, despite their immediate impact on the competitor, would in the long 
run be better for competition.  Similarly, if an anticompetitive effect grows out of FERC's determination that costs (such as costs 
associated with construction) excluded from the rate base by the state regulatory commission which set the retail rate should be 
included in the rate base for wholesale sales as a matter of federal public policy, FERC retains the discretion to weigh the 
competing federal policies of encouraging competition and encouraging construction, and reach any balance supported by 
substantial evidence.  There is, after all, no inherent reason that FERC must be bound by all of the policy and factual 
determinations of whatever state regulatory agency establishes the retail rate. HN7[
] As a general rule, retail rates are 
determined by wholesale ones, not vice versa .  Nonetheless, Conway makes clear that the preservation of competition in the 
electric utility field is also a federal priority, and any decision that interferes with the furtherance of that goal must be justified. See generally Meeks, Concentration in the Electric Power Industry: The Impact of Antitrust Policy , 72 Colum. L. Rev. 64, 76-81 
(1972) (listing reasons to encourage competition in electric power industry)."
905,73," This court has stressed the need for adequate documentation of agency decisions on many occasions.  See, e.g ., Las Cruces 
TV Cable v. FCC, No. 77-1915 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 23, 1981), slip op. at 22; Public Serv. Comm. v. FERC, 642 F.2d 1335, 1345

Bruce Barnes, Jr.).  CIPSCO's average reserve capacity for the previous ten years had been 10.61%, id ., below the 
Commission's recommended norm of 15-20%.  See Initial Decision at 28, J.A. 375. "

J.A. 376.  See generally Trebing, Equity, Efficiency, and the Viability of Public Utility Regulation , in Application of Economic 
Principles in Public Utility Industries 17, 33-34 (W. Sichel & T. Gies, eds. 1981)."
906,78," For instance, in times of increasing demand, a utility would have to open new plants each year to maintain a constant reserve 
capacity.  As pointed out by the Commission in another proceeding involving a similar question, it may be cheaper in the long 
run to take advantage of economies of scale by building larger plants at more infrequent intervals, thus resulting in excess 
capacity at portions of the building cycle.  See Opinion No. 63, supra note 50, J.A. 632-34; see also Initial Decision at 29, J.A. 
375."
906,79," The magnitude of the mismatch is not so great that we can conclude that CIPSCO's management was per se incompetent, or 
even that CIPSCO committed a gross error in judgment.  Moreover, it is unclear to what extent the mismatch will burden the 
ratepayers with extra costs.  The ALJ points out that CIPSCO is expected to sell most of its excess capacity to other utilities, and 
the revenues ""would necessarily redound to the benefit of ratepayers."" See Initial Decision at 31, J.A. 377. One point troubles 
us, however.  Because FERC sets rates in advance, if CIPSCO was expected to sell its excess generating capacity during the 
1978 calendar year, the expected revenues should have redounded to the ratepayers' benefit -- that is, they should have been 
factored into the rates accepted by the Commission.  The ALJ's use of the future tense to describe the crediting of these 
revenues may have been a mere ""slip of the pen."" However, on remand, the Commission should check to ensure that any 
expected sale revenues were in fact credited against the sums to be raised from the ratepayers."
906,80," We note, however, that some state utility commissions as well as commentators have advanced a form of normalization, not 
unlike that which petitioners press here, as a more equitable way of sharing the risks of overforecasting utility demand.  This 
alternative involves charging maintenance and depreciation expenses on the excess capacity as above-the-line operating 
expenses to be paid by the ratepayers over a period of years until the capital investment has been repaid.  Because the excess 
capacity is not included in the rate base, however, shareholders do not receive any return on their investment.  See Trebing, 
supra note 77.  It may be that different rate treatments of excess capacity are not only justified, but necessary, to attain a ""just 
and reasonable"" price in other circumstances."

reviewable because ""the Commission simply did not consider all the relevant factors in a way which would allow this Court to 
determine that the agency has actually exercised its discretion."" Reply Brief for the Petitioners at 23. However, the record lends 
no support to this contention; FERC clearly considered all the relevant factors listed by petitioners when exercising its discretion

912,1," .  Moitie I and Moitie II, had they remained before the Supreme Court, would have posed a slightly different question with one 
added ingredient, but with the same result.  Moitie I, like the first suits by Drs. Marrese and Treister against Academy, was 
brought in the state court.  But it was removed to the federal court, in part on the basis of federal question jurisdiction.  At that 
point the federal court had plenary jurisdiction to hear and consider all integrally related claims Moitie had asserted or could have 
asserted against Federated and its co-defendants, just as was the case with Brown I, which had been initiated in the federal 
court at the outset.  Accordingly the principles discussed in the text of this opinion would apply with full force. "
913,1," .  At the time of the First Res Judicata Opinion Judge Merhige had decided Nash at the District Court level.  This Court 
distinguished that case on the basis of a critical difference discussed later in this opinion, declining to follow the Nash analysis in 
the circumstances of this case.  496 F. Supp. at 239. In the interim since the First Res Judicata Opinion the Court of Appeals for 
the Fourth Circuit has affirmed Judge Merhige.  As discussed in this opinion, the Court of Appeals' opinion really underscores 
the same critical difference between the two cases. "
914,2, .  Plaintiffs' claim here is of such a conspiracy and would not give a right to treble damages under the Illinois statute.
914,3," .  Academy's defenses, whether or not ultimately successful, are staunchly asserted and at least substantively colorable.  
Academy can hardly be heard to argue that plaintiffs would have had a clear right to treble damages under Illinois law because 
Academy's antitrust violations were plainly willful and would have mandated the exercise of discretion to increase the award to 
the full limit permitted by law."

approach, even in situations involving ""purely political acts."" Id. 715, 96 S. Ct. at 1871. "
922,6," .  Another ""prong"" of the American Banana holding, that the Sherman Act does not apply to extraterritorial acts, has been 
effectively repudiated.  See Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 704, 82 S. Ct. 1404, 1413, 8 L. 
Ed. 2d 777 (1962)."
922,7, .  Justice Frankfurter was not participating.
922,8," .   United States v. Sisal Sales Corp., 274 U.S. 268, 47 S. Ct. 592, 71 L. Ed. 1042 (1927), referred to in the quoted passage from 
Continental Ore, read American Banana narrowly, concluding that deliberate acts done here and elsewhere that bring about 
""forbidden results within the United States,"" 274 U.S. at 276, 47 S. Ct. at 593, are within the jurisdiction of our courts, even 
though the actors procured and were aided by discriminatory legislation of a foreign sovereign. 370 U.S. at 705-06, 96 S. Ct. at 
1866-67. The case is properly understood as one directly addressing only the issue of antitrust jurisdiction, not the Act of State 
Doctrine.  Indirectly, however, the reasoning evidences a deference to antitrust enforcement interests. Addressing the effect of these, one commentator has observed: ""The plain impact of Sisal Sales and Continental Ore is that the 
act of state doctrine does not bar judicial review of conspiracies to affect United States commerce when one of the weapons 
chosen by the conspirators is the act of a foreign state."" Antitrust Conspiracies, supra at 515. "
923,9," .  One thoughtful commentary has identified the two major competing interests and summarized certain considerations 
regarding them in this way: The first is an interest in the effective enforcement of American antitrust policies, which not only protect American interests, but 
also, in part, fulfill the United States' regulatory responsibility to prevent multinational corporations from engaging in economic 
misconduct damaging to foreign interests.  The second interest is the policy of judicial non-interference in the conduct of foreign 
relations by the executive and legislative branches.  When United States courts hear cases involving the activity of a foreign 
sovereign, there is a risk that the sovereign will be offended.  This risk is particularly high when American antitrust laws are 
involved, since the decision to regulate anticompetitive behavior reflects an ideological preference for a free market economy. Note, Sherman Act Jurisdiction and the Acts of Foreign Sovereigns, 77 Colum.L.Rev. 1247, 1247 (1977) (footnotes omitted) 
(hereinafter cited as Sherman Act Jurisdiction).  See also 12 Law & Pol'y Int'l Bus. 503, 518-20 (1980)."
923,10," .  As expressed by the court, ""(Antitrust) liability cannot be attributed to the defendants unless Hunt can prove that but for their 
combination or conspiracy Libya would not have moved against it."" 550 F.2d at 76."
923,11," .  The Hunt court said Sisal Sales in no way undermined the American Banana holding even though in both cases the 
defendants had been aided by state acts, and in Sisal the case was allowed to proceed to adjudication.  In part, at least, the 
conclusion rested on the perception that the action involved in Sisal was of ""less moment"" than the expropriation in American 
Banana.  Id. 75. No mention is made of the fact that in Sisal the Court had focused on the effects of the conspiracy to distinguish 
American Banana.  See Antitrust Conspiracies, supra, at 523. As for Continental Ore, the Second Circuit simply dispensed with the case by observing that ""no act of the sovereign was 
involved in Continental Ore."" Id. 75; see Antitrust Conspiracies, supra, at 523-24. "
924,12," .  Using these observations, the court distinguished an earlier case arising in the Ninth Circuit, Occidental Petroleum Corp. v. 
Buttes Gas & Oil Co., 331 F. Supp. 92 (C.D.Cal.1971), aff'd per curiam, 461 F.2d 1261 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 950, 93 
S. Ct. 272, 34 L. Ed. 2d 221 (1972). Occidental Petroleum may have been broad enough to resolve the Timberlane action and, 
in fact, was relied on extensively in Hunt.  550 F.2d at 75-76. In light of these developments, Occidental should be read narrowly 
with close attention to its particular facts.  See Antitrust Conspiracies, supra, at 515-17. "
925,13," .  ""There are no special political factors which outbalance this country's legitimate interest in regulating anticompetitive activity

925,14," .  In part, the need to await further factual development was required by the fact that some twenty-six nations were involved in 
the issues being litigated.  Mannington Mills, 595 F.2d at 1298."
925,15," .  As listed by the Third Circuit, the factors are:"
925,1, . Degree of conflict with foreign law or policy;
925,2, . Nationality of the parties; 
926,3, . Relative importance of the alleged violation of conduct here compared to that abroad;
926,4, . Availability of a remedy abroad and the pendency of litigation there;
926,5, . Existence of intent to harm or affect American commerce and its foreseeability;
926,6, . Possible effect upon foreign relations if the court exercises jurisdiction and grants relief;
926,7," . If relief is granted, whether a party will be placed in the position of being forced to perform an act illegal in either country or be 
under conflicting requirements by both countries;"
926,8, . Whether the court can make its order effective;
926,9, . Whether an order for relief would be acceptable in this country if made by the foreign nation under similar circumstances;
926,10, . Whether a treaty with the affected nations has addressed the issue.
926,595, F.2d at 1297-98.
926,16," .  The following has been said of considerations of validity in the circumstances of an antitrust case: Antitrust cases raise the issue of the validity of a foreign act of state indirectly, if at all.  The court's primary concern is with the 
motivation behind the sovereign act and not its legality.  On the other hand, expropriation cases such as Sabbatino touch on the 
validity of the act of state directly, since the parties' claims will turn precisely on the question of whether the expropriation was 
legal.  In expropriation cases, where the issue of validity is the major point of contention, the danger of insult to the foreign nation 
is greater, and the potential for embarrassment to the executive branch is correspondingly higher. Antitrust Conspiracies, supra, at 517-18.  But see Hunt v. Mobil Oil Corp., 550 F.2d 68 (2d Cir. 1977)."

926,18," .  These conclusions are more fully developed in Part I.C., infra. "
927,19," .  A similar flexible approach would be undertaken if the political question analysis advocated by the dissenters in First National 
City Bank, 406 U.S. at 787-88, 92 S. Ct. at 1822-23 (Brennan, J., dissenting), were followed.  In Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 82 
S. Ct. 691, 7 L. Ed. 2d 663 (1962), the Court, speaking of questions touching the field of foreign relations, observed: Our cases in this field seem invariably to show a discriminating analysis of the particular question posed, in terms of the history 
of its management by the political branches, of its susceptibility to judicial handling in the light of its nature and posture in the 
specific case, and of the possible consequences of judicial action. Id. 211-12, 82 S. Ct. at 706-07. Then, addressing the circumstances in which a political question making a matter nonjusticiable 
will be found, the Court inquired whether there is a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or a lack of judicially 
discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of 
a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion; or the impossibility of a court's undertaking independent resolution without expressing 
lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government; or an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political 
decision already made; or the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one 
question. Id. 217, 82 S. Ct. at 710. "
928,20," .  The committee is not alone in considering Dunhill to have established the commercial exception to the Act of State Doctrine.  
In dicta the Second Circuit discussed Dunhill ""s ""majority opinion"" as establishing an exception only for ""purely commercial 
act(s)."" Hunt v. Mobil Oil Corp., 550 F.2d 68, 72-73 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 984, 98 S. Ct. 608, 54 L. Ed. 2d 477 (1977). 
See also Behring International, Inc. v. Imperial Iranian Air Force, 475 F. Supp. 396, 401 (D.N.J.1979)."
928,21," .  It would seem an undue imposition of free market economy ideals on nations that might well have contrary economic 
priorities.  See note 9, supra. "
929,22," .  The State Department, an arm of the Executive branch, also has consistently favored restrictive application of the Act of State 
Doctrine and of foreign sovereign immunity rules.  E.g., House Report at 6619 n.1."
929,23," .  Defendant would interpret the FSIA as limited to simple contract and tort actions and, therefore, as having no effect on the 
instant case.  However, especially in the area of contract disputes, inquiry into the intent and motivation of parties to transactions 
is common.  It is unavailing, therefore, to suggest that asking foreign sovereigns about such matters in the context of the instant 
case would touch sensitive foreign policy nerves.  Similarly, Defendant cannot persuasively assert that allowing the inquiry, were 
this an FSIA case, would be to elevate purpose of the sovereign act over its nature in violation of that provision of the FSIA 
which directs attention to the nature of an act in determining if it is commercial within the meaning of the FSIA.  28 U.S.C. § 
1603(d).  A procurement decision which is commercial for purposes of a contract action stemming from it is no different where it 
is subject to scrutiny because a third party suggests that the purchase was influenced by the seller in ways violative of United 
States antitrust laws. Finally, there is no reason to believe that the FSIA is limited in applicability only to ordinary tort or contract 
claims.  Indeed, the legislative history would suggest otherwise, see text following note 21, supra, and at least one court has 
applied the FSIA against a foreign sovereign entity in an antitrust action.  Outboard Marine Corp. v. Pezetel, 461 F. Supp. 384, 
395 (D.Del.1978). "
930,24," .  Kickbacks, even if they occurred as alleged, are not the sort of economic activity that would require judicial review of the 
sovereign's preference for a given economic system."
930,25," .  Though the general analysis here adopted would suggest that each of the sales could be investigated in connection with this 
litigation, the possibility remains that specific considerations as to one or more of the sovereigns might be raised to counter 
application as to that sovereign of the general ruling embodied in this opinion. "
931,26," .  Defendant argues that the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-1 to 78dd-2, punishes offers or promises to 
bribe, thereby avoiding inquiry into whether the bribes were taken or whether they influenced decisions.  From this it is asserted 
that Congress, consistent with the Act of State Doctrine, circumvented any embarrassing inquiry into the foreign sovereign acts.  
However, since the Act imposes criminal sanctions for bribery ""for the purposes of"" improper influence or inducement, it is 
inconceivable that a trial would proceed without some inquiry into whether the alleged improper activity could have had the 
intended effect, an examination that will call into question the operations of the foreign entity to which the bribe was allegedly 
directed.  The standards of proof in a criminal action, particularly with respect to intent, would seem to require no less.  Thus, in 
spirit and in practice, the Act supports the notion that act of state concerns are subjugated to interests in stemming foreign 
corrupt practices."
931,27," .  One factor that may have influenced the court in General Aircraft was the inclusion in the complaint of allegations that the CIA 
was involved in the conspiracy to effect the procurement decisions of the foreign sovereigns. Id. 6. If this factor had been 
affirmatively considered in an explicit balancing process, as well as it should have been to account for separation of powers 
concerns, the decision of the court would be more understandable and the case would be plainly distinct from that at bar."
931,28," .  See note 12, supra."
931,29," .  In a separate portion of the opinion, the court found it to be an indispensible party that should have been named.  Id. 1116-
19. "
932,30," .  In a footnote, the court suggested this distinction of Timberlane: "" Timberlane (supra) involved a judicial determination of a 
mortgage dispute.  Here we are concerned with one of the most vital concerns of a sovereign-its military arsenal and the 
decision affecting it."" 489 F. Supp. at 1121 n.13. "
933,1," Since both parties have submitted matters outside of the pleadings for the court's consideration on this motion, it will be treated 
as a motion for summary judgment in accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c). "
936,2," During the preliminary injunction hearing the court drew to the attention of plaintiff's counsel the 60 day notice provision for 
termination of a franchise under the New Jersey Franchise Practices Act, N.J.S.A. 56:10-1 et seq.  In light of the apparent 
applicability of the state act, the court extended to plaintiff the opportunity to amend his complaint to assert a violation of this act.  
Plaintiff declined the opportunity, believing that ""the antitrust laws supersede the state regulation."" PI Tr. 25-9.  Reference to the 
transcript of the preliminary injunction hearing is by ""PI Tr."". "
941,3," Further support for this holding is found in FTC v. Sinclair Refining Co., 261 U.S. 463, 43 S. Ct. 450, 67 L. Ed. 746 (1922). In 
Sinclair, the Court held that the practice, upon the part of the defendant, of leasing underground tanks with pumps to retail 
dealers at nominal rentals and upon the condition that the equipment shall be used only with gasoline supplied by the lessor, 
was not violative of the Clayton Act. Id. at 473, 43 S. Ct. at 453. Furthermore, the Court stated ""(t)he lessee is free to buy 
wherever he chooses; he may freely accept and use as many pumps as he wishes and may discontinue any or all of them.  He 
may carry on business as his judgment dictates and his means permit, save only that he cannot use the lessor's equipment for 
dispensing another's brand."" Id. at 474, 43 S. Ct. at 453 (emphasis added). "
946,1, Kartell is joined by three other Massachusetts physicians as parties plaintiff.
946,2," The second named defendant is Blue Cross of Massachusetts, Inc.  The Commissioner of Insurance has intervened as a party 
defendant. "
949,3," In this regard, we note that courts disagree on the question whether referral from a Federal court to a State agency under the 
primary jurisdiction doctrine is ever appropriate in State action analysis.  Contrast Litton Sys., Inc. v. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., 
539 F.2d 418, 421 (5th Cir. 1976), with Industrial Communications Sys., Inc. v. Pacific Tel. & Tel. Co., 505 F.2d 152 (9th Cir. 
1974). See Note, Parker v. Brown Revisited: The State Action Doctrine Under Goldfarb, Cantor, and Bates, 77 Colum. L. Rev. 
898, 925-928 (1977). "
951,4, The parties offer no estimate of the percentage increase in service benefits at the time this method was instituted.
951,5," The 1977 amended schedule of benefits was later challenged in a proceeding instituted by several physicians and the 
Massachusetts Medical Society.  The suit was ultimately dismissed on the ground that the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust their 
administrative remedies.  See Nelson v. Blue Shield of Mass., Inc., 377 Mass. 746 (1979). "
955,6," The relevant paragraph of G. L. c. 32A, § 4, as amended through St. 1979, c. 268, § 2, is as follows: ""For the purposes of this 
chapter, any savings bank authorized to engage in the insurance business in accordance with chapter one hundred and 
seventy-eight and any nonprofit hospital service corporation or nonprofit medical corporation organized under chapter one 
hundred and seventy-six A or one hundred and seventy-six B shall be and is hereby authorized to enter into a reinsurance 
agreement as herein provided in the same manner as any other insurance company."" "
959,1," In Jack Kahn Music, the Court held that where damages are provable, the injury will not be irreparable. The claim in Jack Kahn 
Music was for the loss of an allegedly profitable business of selling Baldwin pianos. "
960,2," There have been allegations to the effect that the Plant Variety Protection Office does not concern itself with geneology.  (See 
transcript of June 29, 1981 hearing at page 27.) If this is true, the Court believes that the requirement of exhaustion would 
approach an exercise in futility. "

968,1," .  Harry B. Stoner, who initiated this lawsuit in 1965, died on March 28, 1976. His wife, Ann Stoner, as personal representative, 
was substituted as party plaintiff. "
969,2," .  The plaintiffs argue that Vendo's purpose was not limited to a desire to expand its product line, but also included the intent to 
eliminate Stoner as a competitor. This contention will be discussed separately hereinafter."
969,3," .  The assets purchased excluded the land and property comprising the Stoner Manufacturing plant which were, instead, the 
subjects of a lease and option to purchase which Vendo exercised in 1961. Vendo was to pay Stoner (1) all profits in excess of $ 
250,000 realized from the use of the assets purchased annually for a period of ten years or until Vendo exercised its option to 
buy the plant, and (2) for a period of ten years, 25% of the income derived from foreign production of the acquired machines. 
This last provision was subsequently modified by a 1962 compromise agreement between the parties which is not relevant to the 
issues in this case. "
970,4," .  The district court documents only four instances in which Vendo sought Stoner's assistance, although Vendo contends that 
""Stoner's advice was sought on many occasions…."" "
971,5," .  Although Vendo had attempted in 1959 to design a machine similar to the subsequently developed Lektro-Vend machine, its 
designs had proved impractical and Vendo discarded the project."
971,6," .  The district court's finding that ""Stoner disclosed to Vendo that he had been loaning money to the Phillips, (sic) which loans 
had been paid back by Stoner's sister-in-law"" might seem to imply that, at that time, Stoner revealed to Vendo the identity of the 
source of funds responsible for the repayment of his loan. But see the Illinois Supreme Court's finding that ""Stoner did not 
disclose that this other person was his sister-in-law. This conversation marked the first occasion on which Stoner disclosed any 
involvement with Lektro-Vend, and the disclosure was far from complete."" Vendo Co. v. Stoner, 58 Ill.2d 289, 300, 321 N.E.2d 1, 
7 (1974), cert. denied, 420 U.S. 975, 95 S. Ct. 1398, 43 L. Ed. 2d 655 (1975). The district court noted that ""(i)t appears, 
however, that Vendo had heard rumors of Stoner's involvement with Lektro-Vend as early as the 1962 trade show."" "
972,7," .  On October 21, 1965, the plaintiffs herein filed the instant suit against Vendo which laid dormant, pending resolution of the 
state court claims, until 1975. "
973,8," .  The cases in this circuit, as in others, are not in total harmony on what standard of review is appropriate in a ""paper case."" 
Although some cases purport to abandon the clearly erroneous standard where the evidence is essentially documentary, see, e. 
g., John R. Thompson Co. v. United States, 477 F.2d 164, 167 (7th Cir. 1973); Deep Welding, Inc. v. Sciaky Brothers, Inc., 417 
F.2d 1227, 1229 (7th Cir. 1969), most of the cases which have discussed the issue have simply utilized a somewhat less 
exacting application of the clearly erroneous standard. See, e. g., Oscar Gruss & Son v. First State Bank of Eldorado, 582 F.2d 
424, 431 (7th Cir. 1978); Flowers v. Crouch-Walker Corp., 552 F.2d 1277, 1284 (7th Cir. 1977); Mercantile National Bank of 
Chicago v. Howmet Corp., 524 F.2d 1031, 1034 n. 3 (7th Cir. 1975). "
974,9," .  The district court found, in part, that ""Mr. Kamien did not know the market shares of other vending machine manufacturers and 
admitted having made no effort to determine them…. Not only are his opinions as to Vendo's dominance and monopoly power 
based on inadequate knowledge of the industry, but they are also based on theories that have no support in the antitrust laws."" "
975,10," .  In like manner, the plaintiffs seek to rely upon purported ""findings"" of the Supreme Court. They emphasize that ""the Supreme 
Court, … while holding that an injunction could not legally issue, said that nothing in its opinion precluded the plaintiffs' ""ability to 
sue for treble damages resulting from the vexatious prosecution of that state court litigation.' "" (Emphasis in plaintiffs' brief.) The 
Supreme Court, however, was not addressing the merits of this case in that statement, nor did it make a finding that the state 
court litigation in this case was vexatious. Rather, the Court's statement was made in the context of its distinction between a 
federal court's power to enjoin future versus ongoing state proceedings. The Court noted that prior Supreme Court cases 
recognized that repetitious sham state litigation could constitute an antitrust violation, and in that event, a federal court could 
enjoin such future state court litigation. But the court declined to read the Anti-Injunction Act so broadly as to allow a federal 
court to enjoin a pending state lawsuit suspected to be vexatious. The Court noted that ""(a)ny ""disadvantage' to which the 
federal plaintiff is put in the initial proceeding is diminished by his ability to set up the federal antitrust claim as an affirmative 
defense, … and his ability to sue for treble damages resulting from the vexatious prosecution of that state-court litigation."" 433 
U.S. at 636 n. 6, 97 S. Ct. 2881, 2890 n. 6, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1009."
975,11," .  The per se analysis is, in reality, a truncated rule of reason analysis applicable to those restraints ""which because of their 
pernicious effect on competition and lack of any redeeming virtue are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and therefore 
illegal without elaborate inquiry as to the precise harm they have caused or the business excuse for their use."" Northern Pacific 
Railway Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5, 78 S. Ct. 514, 518, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1958). See Havoco of America, Ltd. v. Shell Oil 
Co., 626 F.2d 549, 555 (7th Cir. 1980) (A per se exception does not require an analysis of anticompetitive effects, not because 
""anticompetitive effects need not exist to establish the elements of a per se offense, but rather from the fact that the type of 
conduct complained of in a per se action is so destructive of free competition that deleterious effects will be conclusively 
presumed,"" such as with group boycotts, market allocation, and certain types of tying arrangements.)."
975,12," .  Even at common law, (i)t must have been obvious … that the flat ban against such restraints of trade covered more than the rationale of the (early 
common law per se rule against covenants not to compete) required. The rule might prevent desirable transfers of property. The 
most valuable asset of a business might be the good will of the public toward its owner. Should he wish to sell the business the 
owner could not get a price reflecting the asset of good will or the true going concern value of his business unless he could 
promise the purchaser not to return to compete with the business sold. "
976,," Bork, Ancillary Restraints & the Sherman Act, 15 ABA Section of Antitrust Law Proceedings, 211, 213 (1959) (footnote 
omitted). "
977,13," .  The plaintiffs primarily complain that the covenants were overbroad because they were tailored to protect the area in which 
Vendo, not Stoner Manufacturing, operated. We note that both parties operated throughout the United States, and Vendo, at 
least, operated in many foreign countries. In Harrison v. Glucose Sugar Refining Co., 116 F. 304, 308 (7th Cir. 1902) (upholding 
the reasonableness of an employment contract prohibiting competition within 1,500 miles of the employer's place of business), 
this court tested geographical reasonableness in terms of ""the area in which the covenantee (i. e. Vendo) prosecutes his 
business."" (Emphasis added.) See also United States v. Addyston Pipe & Steel Co., 85 F. 271, 283 (6th Cir. 1898), aff'd as 
modified, 175 U.S. 211, 20 S. Ct. 96, 44 L. Ed. 136 (1899) (""More recently, the limitation that the restraint could not be general or 
unlimited as to space has been modified in some cases holding that if the protection necessary to the covenantee requires a 
covenant unrestricted as to space, it will be upheld as valid.""). The plaintiffs' attempt to distinguish Harrison as an employment 
case is disingenuous since both employment and acquisition covenants are at issue here. Moreover, the plaintiffs vigorously argue, in general, that the court should not look to subsequent events (e. g., where and when 
the covenants were actually enforced) but should instead restrict its inquiry to the language of the covenants as originally 
drafted. They inconsistently argue, however, that Stoner was not subsequently entrusted with any confidential information or 
duties during his employment and, therefore, the employment covenant was invalid because it protected no valid employment 
interests. Because we have found that the acquisition transaction was motivated by a legitimate purpose, and that Stoner's 
employment was not a mere sham as the plaintiffs contend, we could not say that the parties originally drafted the covenant 
expecting that Stoner would not acquire any confidential information in his employment with Vendo. "

979,15," .  The plaintiffs misconceive the nature of the burden of proving adverse market impact under § 1 when they allege that ""Vendo 
(failed to) make even a feeble attempt to explain how competition was not impacted here."" It is the plaintiffs' burden to prove the 
adverse effect on competition.  Cowley v. Braden Industries, Inc., 613 F.2d 751, 755 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 965, 100 
S. Ct. 2942, 64 L. Ed. 2d 824 (1980)."
979,16," .  Neither party disputes the district court's finding that the relevant market in this case consists of all coin-operated vending 
machines for the sale of food, beverages, and cigarettes in the United States. "
980,17," .  While the court in Kearney & Trecker commented that the defendant's 33% market share was ""impressive,"" market share 
was not the only indicator of market power in that case. In Kearney & Trecker, the defendant's market power was enhanced by 
possession of a strategic patent with wide coverage nearly corresponding to the relevant market. See Handler & Steuer, 
Attempts to Monopolize & No-Fault Monopolization, 129 U. of Pa.L.Rev. 125, 164-65 (1980). "
982,18," .  Similarly, proof of Vendo's alleged ""policy"" of executing and enforcing noncompetition covenants in other employment and 
acquisition contexts was insufficient to establish that these activities were predatory."
982,19," .  The following remarks are illustrative: ""Vendo has had restrictive provisions for years in anything it can get them into…;"" ""I 
have always felt that one of the major advantages of the Stoner acquisition contract, from our standpoint, was the fact that it 
guaranteed that your (Harry Stoner's) design genius would never be coupled with our money to put a new and most formidable 
competitor into the business against Vendo;"" and ""Well, I am sure he (Stoner) thoroughly understood that he was not to compete 
with The Vendo Company…. (W)e just didn't want him to compete with us, … I mean he wasn't to compete anywhere, in the 
whole world, anywhere, he wasn't to compete."" The plaintiffs also rely upon the following colloquy: Q: And from the standpoint of Vendo, then, the employment contract was just a means of getting a noncompetition covenant. 
That was its principal purpose, wasn't it? A: One of the main justifications for it. But the appellants delete the very next question which amplifies the above response: Q: And it was used to put him on the shelf so to speak? A: Well, I don't think that was ever part of the consideration. "
983,20," .  This case is unlike Greyhound Computer Corp. v. International Business Machines Corp., 559 F.2d 488, 505 (9th Cir. 1977), 
cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1040, 98 S. Ct. 782, 54 L. Ed. 2d 790 (1978), in which the court ruled that a jury could infer specific intent 
to monopolize from expressions of concern by IBM officials about growing competition and the use of ""prima facie … 
anticompetitive activities that impaired competition without a legitimate business purpose."" In the case at bar, the plaintiffs have 
failed to prove that Vendo's acts were predatory and not predominantly motivated by legitimate business purposes."
983,21," .  Vendo contends that the companies were not actual competitors prior to the acquisition. The court never explicitly held that 
the acquisition was most properly analyzed as a horizontal merger because it found that the plaintiffs' § 7 claim failed even if the 
merger was truly horizontal. If Stoner Manufacturing and Vendo were not true competitors, the acquisition would more properly be analyzed as a product 
extension merger to assess the anticompetitive effects of Vendo's entry into the candy vending machine manufacturing market. 
The plaintiffs do not appeal the district court's rejection of their claim under the more stringent standards applicable to this type of 
merger as set forth in United States v. Marine Bancorporation, 418 U.S. 602, 94 S. Ct. 2856, 41 L. Ed. 2d 978 (1974) 
(geographic market extension). Instead, the plaintiffs merely insist that the merger ""must be analyzed as a ""horizontal merger' 
between competitors."" "
986,22," .  This result is fortified by our recent decision in Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corp. v. FTC, 652 F.2d 1324 (7th Cir. 1981), 
wherein this court ruled that while unrebutted statistical evidence can alone establish a § 7 violation under General Dynamics, 
nonstatistical evidence undermining the probative value of the statistics can rebut the prima facie case. At 1341. While the court 
specifically rejected the argument that financial weakness of the acquired firm can alone justify a merger, it did recognize that 
""the financial weakness of the acquired firm … may be a relevant factor in some cases."" Id."
986,23," .  Because of the disposition of this claim in favor of the defendant, we need not address other alternative arguments advanced 
by Vendo. "
988,1," .  The Robinson-Patman Act, ch. 592, 49 Stat. 1526 (1936), amended certain provisions of the Clayton Act, ch. 323, 38 Stat. 
730 (1914).  The amended product is codified at 15 U.S.C. § 13, the pertinent provisions of subsection (a) are as follows: (a) It shall be unlawful for any persons engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, either directly or indirectly, to 
discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality, where either or any of the purchases 
involved in such discrimination are in commerce, where such commodities are sold for use, consumption or resale within the 
United States …, and where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a 
monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any person who either grants or knowingly 
receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them…."
988,2, .   15 U.S.C. § 13(a). 
989,3," .  This is illustrated in testimony before the House Judiciary Committee by H. B. Teegarden, the author of the Robinson-Patman 
Act.  Part of the questioning is especially enlightening: MR. LLOYD.  Would this bill, in your judgment, prevent the granting of discounts to the United States Government? MR. TEEGARDEN.  Not unless the present Clayton Act does so.  So far as that problem is concerned, it is no different from that 
which exists under the present Clayton Act. MR. LLOYD.  For instance, the Government gets huge discounts. Take that electric fan, for instance.  You go to the ordinary 
store and the list price is $ 35.  The Procurement Division procures them delivered, one at a time, for $ 13.18.  Now, would that 
discount be barred by this bill? MR. TEEGARDEN.  I do not see why it should, unless a discount contrary to the present bill would be barred that is, the present 
law would be barred by that bill. Aside from that, my answer would be this: The Federal Government is not in competition with other buyers from these concerns.  
Therefore a discrimination it is so applied universally in interstate commerce law, in the railroad law to have a discrimination, 
there must be a relative position between the parties to the discrimination which constitutes an injury to one as against the other.  
I think the answer is to be found in that. In other words, if seller A makes a price to a retailer in New York and a different price to a retailer in San Francisco, all other 
things aside, no case of discrimination could be predicated there, because the two are not in the same sphere at all. The Federal Government is saved by the same distinction, not of location but of function.  They are not in competition with 
anyone else who would buy.  (Emphasis added.) Brief of Appellees Abbott Laboratories, et al., at 66, quoting Hearings Before the House Committee on the Judiciary on Bills to 
Amend the Clayton Act, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., 208-09 (hereinafter cited as Hearings )."
989,4," .  Indeed, the author of the Robinson-Patman Act expressly advised members of the House Committee that anti-competitive 
purchasing and resale by municipal hospitals would be covered by the Act.  When pressed to explain how far state and local 
government liability would extend under the Act, Teegarden offered the only testimony to be found in the consideration of the Act 
that is directly relevant to the question we decide: MR. HANCOCK.  It would eliminate competitive bidding all along the line, would it not, in classes of goods that would be covered 
by this bill? MR. TEEGARDEN.  You mean competitive bidding on Government orders?MR. HANCOCK.  Government, State, city, 
municipality.MR. TEEGARDEN.  No; I think not.MR. MICHENER.  If it did do it, you would not want it, would you? MR. TEEGARDEN.  No; I would not want it.  It certainly does not eliminate competitive bidding anywhere else, and I do not see 
how it would with the Government. MR. HANCOCK.  You would have to bid to the city, county, exactly the same as anybody else; same quantity, same price, same 
quality?MR. TEEGARDEN.  No. MR. HANCOCK.  Would they or could they sell to a city hospital any cheaper than they would to a privately-owned hospital, 
under this bill? MR. TEEGARDEN.  I would have to answer it this way.  In the final analysis, it would depend upon numerous questions of fact in 
a particular case.  If the two hospitals are in competition with each other, I should say then that the fact that one is operated by 
the city does not save it from the bill.  If they are not in competition with each other, then they are in a different sphere. The facts of the situation are not present upon which to predicate a discrimination, in the nature of the case.  I do not see that 
that question becomes any different under this bill from what it is under the present section 2 of the Clayton Act, for that bill also "
990,," prohibits discrimination generally in the same terms that this does.  But it differs in the breadth of the exceptions.  That is the 
only difference between the two bills. Brief of Appellees Abbott Laboratories, et al., quoting Hearings, supra note 3, at 209 (emphases added). This exchange is all the more noteworthy for the majority's complete failure to rationalize its conclusion with today's decision.  
The opinion of the lower court, upon which the majority relies, does not distinguish this discussion.  From the testimony just 
quoted, the conclusion is inescapable that the Act's author believed that hospital retail competition by state instrumentalities 
would be subject to the anti-price discrimination provisions of the Robinson-Patman Act. The lower court's reliance on only part of Teegarden's testimony, and its apparent ignorance of the testimony just quoted, is 
therefore puzzling.  Counsel for the appellant association informed us at oral argument, however, that this discussion with Rep. 
Hancock, which so clearly bears on the issue before us, was not cited to the lower court by appellees and was not known to the 
appellant at the time of hearing before the lower court, and indeed the lower court concluded that ""no contrary expression of 
opinion during the legislative history of the Act has been cited to the court."" Id.  I note only that this might explain the lower 
court's failure to discuss this very important testimony.  The majority's failure to correct this omission in their opinion's discussion 
of the legislative history, however, is to me a complete mystery."
990,5," .  The federal government is exempted from liability for anticompetitive retail activities on the principle of sovereign immunity. 
Teegarden commented in a letter to the Committee that the Clayton Act, as it was proposed to be amended by the Robinson-
Patman bill, does not include the United States within § 13's use of the word ""purchaser."" That being the case, well-established 
principles of sovereign immunity would narrowly limit the sovereign's exposure to suit, precluding it altogether in the event of 
ambiguity.  Teegarden's letter read in part:"
990,2," . Would the bill prevent competitive bidding on government purchases below trade price levels? This question was raised by a member of the committee at the hearing.  The answer is found in the principle of statutory 
construction that a statute will not be construed to limit or restrict in any way the rights, prerogatives, or privileges of the 
sovereign unless it so expressly provides a principle inherited by American jurisprudence from the common law.  ( Dollar 
Savings Bank v. United States (1874), 86 U.S. (19 Wall.) 227, 22 L. Ed. 80; United States v. Herron (1874), 87 U.S. (20 Wall.) 
251, 22 L. Ed. 275; Magdalen College case, 11 Coke 74; King v. Allen, 15 East 333; Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, 6th 
Ed. (Eng.), p. 244-251). Brief of Appellees Abbott Laboratories, et al., at 28 quoting Hearings, supra note 3, at 250. Never to my knowledge, however, has it been understood to be a principle of sovereign immunity that one sovereign may avail 
itself of the immunity from suit of another, especially when the latter is exercising a power delegated to it by the former.  This 
rationale is therefore of no relevance to state activities otherwise prohibited by the Robinson-Patman Act."
990,6," .  The Nonprofit Institutions Act, ch. 283, 52 Stat. 446 (1938), is codified at 15 U.S.C. § 13c and provides as follows: Nothing in section 13 … of this title (15), shall apply to purchases of their supplies for their own use by schools, colleges, 
universities, public libraries, churches, hospitals, and charitable institutions not operated for profit. "

991,8," .   Id., 425 U.S. at 12, 96 S. Ct. at 1313."
991,9," .  The majority seeks to distinguish the language in City of Lafayette, on the ground that the case was decided on the basis of 
the Sherman Act and not upon the Robinson-Patman Act.  The argument runs that Congress used its powers under the 
Commerce Clause to the constitutional maximum in enacting the Sherman Act, while it did not use its powers to the full extent in 
the Clayton/Robinson-Patman Act.  This argument is spurious.  A comparison of the language used in the two statutes 
demonstrates that the only significant difference between them is the extent to which the activities complained of must affect 
interstate commerce. See generally Gulf Oil Corp. v. Copp Paving Co., Inc., 419 U.S. 186, 95 S. Ct. 392, 42 L. Ed. 2d 378 
(1974). There is no difference in terms of the scope of who or what activities are regulated.  Cf.  City of Lafayette, 435 U.S. at 
396, 98 S. Ct. at 1127-8 (comparing the scope of § 8 of the Sherman Act and § 4 of the Clayton Act).  Thus, there is no basis for 
regarding the holding of City of Lafayette as anything less than compelling here."
991,10," .  The only policy argument advanced in support of today's result is the state's paramount interest in procuring the things it 
needs in order to do what it wants at the lowest cost.  That policy is undisturbed by § 13's focus on the relative advantages of 
competing retailers.  If my reasoning had been adopted in this case, this interest would not be threatened."
991,11," .  The Supreme Court has only recently reminded us of the limits of the Usery doctrine. In order to succeed, a claim that congressional commerce power legislation is invalid under the reasoning of National League of 
Cities must satisfy each of three requirements.  First, there must be a showing that the challenged statute regulates the ""States 
as States.""… Second, the federal regulations must address matters that are indisputably ""attributes of state sovereignty.""… And 
third, it must be apparent that the States' compliance with federal law would directly impair their ability ""to structure integral 
operations in areas of traditional functions."" Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining and Regulation Assn., Inc., 452 U.S. 264, 101 S. Ct. 2352, 2366, 69 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1981) 
(sustaining constitutionality of Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977). Needless to say these requirements can hardly be considered satisfied in the instant case. "
992,1," .  One of the defendant manufacturers has moved for summary judgment on the alternative basis that it made no sales to the 
plaintiff's assignors and members.  This issue is discussed in Part IV, infra. "
993,2," .  Attached to defendant's brief is a copy of one of the assignments, which appears to be sufficient as an assignment for 
collection.  Legal consideration for the assignments may well be provided by virtue of the fact that the various assignors are 
entitled thereunder to a pro rata distribution of recoveries in the action."
993,3," .  It is not clear whether The Cooper Green Hospital also asserts immunity under the Eleventh Amendment.  What is clear is that 
it is entitled to such immunity neither for the period when it was operated by the county commissioners under the name Mercy 
Hospital nor for the period it has been operated under the provisions of Alabama Code (1975), §§ 22-21-70 et seq. "
994,4," .  It is unclear whether plaintiff would consider the nonremunerative distribution by a governmental agency as being ""for its own 
use"" under 15 U.S.C. § 13c, or as being outside the ""commerce"" and ""competition"" standards of 15 U.S.C. § 13, or as meeting 
some implied exemption in the law."
994,5," .  See Alabama Code (1975), §§ 41-16-20, 41-16-21.  Applicability of similar restrictions to counties and county hospitals under 
Article 3 of Chapter 16 of Title 41 of the Alabama Code (1975) is less clear.  Cf. Alabama Code (1975) § 22-21-190 (bid laws 
made applicable to some county hospitals).  It may be argued that the state policy is not to require that lower prices be given to 
governmental purchasers than to private purchasers, but only that the governmental purchaser buy at the lowest price offered; 
and this is certainly so.  It is, however, perhaps of significance that the state bid laws contain exceptions for sales made in 
violation of the Sherman Anti-trust Law but not for those contrary to Robinson-Patman.  See Alabama Code (1975), §§ 41-16-25, 
41-16-55."
994,6," .  See 435 U.S. at 397, n. 14, 98 S. Ct. at 1128 (treating 15 U.S.C. § 13c as creating an exemption for certain municipal service 
operations); 435 U.S. at 402, n. 19, 98 S. Ct. at 1131 (viewing the Elkins Act, from which a governmental exemption had earlier 
been rejected, as similar to Robinson-Patman)."
994,7," .  The referenced decisions, Union Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 313 U.S. 450, 61 S. Ct. 1064, 85 L. Ed. 1453 (1941), and 
California v. United States, 320 U.S. 577, 64 S. Ct. 352, 88 L. Ed. 322 (1944), may perhaps themselves be distinguished 
because the federal legislation involved, the Elkins Act and the Shipping Act of 1916, respectively, related to the very 
instrumentalities and facilities of commerce and transportation.  A third cited case, Ohio v. Helvering, 292 U.S. 605, 54 S. Ct. 
720, 78 L. Ed. 1467 (1934), involved a state activity (distribution of alcoholic beverages) clearly falling outside the parameters of 
traditional governmental functions. "
995,8," .  But for his reliance on principles of statutory construction, Mr. Teegarden's statements could be understood as premised upon 
the fact that governmental purchases would not typically have a potential effect upon competition."
995,9," .  Contrary conclusions were reached in 1937 by the Attorney General of California and in 1949 by the Attorney General of 
Georgia, the latter however considering only the question of whether there could be proscribed discrimination in sales by a state 
factory. "
996,10," .  The court does not here base its decision upon the ""state action"" doctrine as explicated in Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 63 
S. Ct. 307, 87 L. Ed. 315 (1943); Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 95 S. Ct. 2004, 44 L. Ed. 2d 572 (1975); and "
997,," Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., 435 U.S. 389, 98 S. Ct. 1123, 55 L. Ed. 2d 364 (1978). That doctrine appears to be 
limited to situations involving a ""state policy to displace competition with regulation or monopoly public service."" 435 U.S. at 413, 
98 S. Ct. at 1136. The rationale, however, of those decisions may well support the result here reached, where a state has 
declared its desire that governmental purchases be on the basis of the lowest prices available.  Whether some expansion of the 
Parker principle might be allowed with respect to the state policy here involved need not be answered at this time; for, as 
indicated, the court has concluded as a matter of statutory construction that governmental purchases are outside the reach of 
the Robinson-Patman Act. "
1011,1," The thorax is the area of the body between the neck and the respiratory diaphragm, encased by the ribs. Thoracic surgery 
includes pulmonary, esophageal, mediastinal and open heart surgery. Cardiovascular surgery is surgery performed on the heart 
or on any of the blood vessels throughout the body. Thus, open heart surgery is included within the terms ""thoracic,"" 
""cardiothoracic,"" or ""cardiovascular"" surgery."
1011,2," Dr. Robinson had believed that he would be able to continue working with Dr. Giacobine on a month-to-month basis until he 
could establish his own practice. Shortly before the employment agreement expired in December, 1974, however, Dr. Giacobine 
informed Dr. Robinson that no month-to-month agreement would be executed unless Dr. Robinson agreed not to practice in 
Pittsburgh after their association ceased. Dr. Robinson refused to accept this condition. Subsequently, Dr. Robinson initiated a 
lawsuit for breach of contract against Dr. Giacobine in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. That 
litigation ultimately was resolved in Dr. Giacobine's favor. "
1012,3," Organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as a private, nonprofit hospital corporation, Allegheny 
General has served the community since 1882. During the pendency of this litigation, Allegheny General Hospital underwent a 
corporate reorganization. The health care provider known as Allegheny General Hospital is now a subsidiary of the Allegheny 
Health, Education and Research Corporation. The latter corporation also owns another subsidiary known as the Allegheny-
Singer Research Corporation."
1012,4," Regional referral hospitals usually are fully integrated health care providers with facilities for primary, secondary and tertiary 
level care. Primary care involves the monitoring of a person's basic state of health and the diagnosis and treatment of common, 
relatively minor illnesses. Secondary care involves the treatment of more serious illnesses or injuries, such as routine surgery or 
the repair of fractures, that may require extended hospitalization but do not present the physician with any complex problems. 
Tertiary care involves the treatment of complex medical problems with intensive care and sophisticated equipment. An open 
heart operation is an example of tertiary care. "
1014,5," Dr. Magovern's curriculum vitae contains a three page bibliography; all of the articles mentioned were written prior to 1968. 
The doctor participated in the development of the Magovern-Cromie sutureless heart valve, and he has conducted other 
research involving prosthetic heart valves, heart transplantation and the concept of the artificial heart. Dr. Magovern headed a 
team that performed the second lung transplant operation in the world."
1014,6," Dr. John Mitchell performs only non-open heart, thoracic procedures. Dr. Michael Gerber was very active at Allegheny General 
in 1973 and 1974, with eighty and one hundred-ten admissions respectively, but his volume declined sharply thereafter, with no 
admissions in 1977 and five admissions in 1978. This decline followed a disagreement with Dr. Magovern over the emergency 
nature of a particular operation. Dr. Gerber now concentrates his practice at Shadyside Hospital. In November, 1978, Dr. Pablo 
Hong-Barco, an associate of Dr. Gerber, obtained staff privileges, but he has done very little work at Allegheny General. Dr. 
Kenneth Barron, a former associate of Dr. Gerber, obtained staff privileges during 1979, but he concentrates his practice 
elsewhere. Dr. John McCabe, a sole practitioner, recently received staff privileges, but he has yet to admit any patients. "

1016,15, U.S.C. § 26 (1976).
1016,10," We know of no case challenging a denial of hospital staff privileges that has gone to trial on an antitrust theory. Cf. Borsody, 
The Antitrust Laws and the Health Industry, 12 Akron L.Rev. 417, 449-50 (1979) (most prior cases in federal court involving 
denial of staff privileges were brought on due process or civil rights theories)."
1016,11, A cardiologist is an internist who specializes in the diagnosis and the non-surgical treatment of heart disease. 
1017,12," By stipulation during the trial, counsel agreed that when they referred to ""open heart surgery,"" the reference was to a surgical 
procedure during which the patient was attached to a cardiopulmonary by-pass machine. "
1018,13," A coronary artery by-pass is performed when a patient is suffering from a narrowing or occlusion of the vessels leading from 
the heart. The occluded area is by-passed with a vessel graft, usually a portion of the saphenous vein that the junior surgeon or 
resident has removed from the patient's leg. "
1019,14," Although hospitals properly can be classified into three groups for purposes of discussion, we recognize that hospitals 
actually fall along a spectrum that reflects differences in size, composition of staff, range of medical services, educational 
programs and involvement in research."
1019,15," The hospital probably would have a few specialized personnel under contract, such as an anesthesiologist and a pathologist. "
1022,16," Mr. Kenneth Hewitt, a long-time member of Allegheny General's Board of Trustees, served as chairman of the committee that 
oversaw the reorganization of Allegheny General in the wake of the report presented by Cresap, McCormick and Paget. He 
testified at trial that the directors of the clinical departments are supposed to run their departments as executive heads. They are supposed to take charge, plan and oversee the educational 
programs that their department conducts. They are supposed to be sure that they are adequately staffed with competent 
doctors, and … to run their department … at the highest level of patient care possible. In other words, they have full 
responsibility and accountability for what went on in their department. Tr. 4606. Article VI, § 2 of the 1971 edition of the Medical Staff Bylaws reads in part that ""(a) Director of a Department is expected to 
develop and maintain a strong well-balanced Department and Staff complement, compatible with the goals and resources of the 
Hospital…."" Jt. Exh. 88."
1022,17," Prior to 1968, the doctors in each department elected one of their colleagues to fill the position of director. The Board of 
Trustees changed this practice, however, giving itself the power of appointment. Through the Board's action, the hospital 
acquired the ability to recruit directors from outside the existing staff and to ensure that the directors' loyalty would lie primarily 
with the hospital. "
1023,18," Events at other Pittsburgh hospitals have shown that Dr. Magovern cannot take his responsibility lightly. Within the last six 
years, LCGME has withdrawn accreditation for the residency programs in thoracic surgery at St. Francis and Shadyside 
Hospitals. Questions have been raised about the effect on competition caused by the involvement of LCGME in the accreditation of 
medical education programs. See Kissam, Applying Antitrust Law to Medical Credentialing, 7 Am.J.L. & Med. 1, 2 n.2, 26-27 
(1981). "
1024,19," Dr. Robinson had left Dr. Giacobine's service in December, 1974. "
1027,20," Dr. Magovern was mistaken when he stated that the University of Pittsburgh had refused to appoint Dr. Robinson to its faculty. 
Dr. Robinson had expressed his interest in obtaining a faculty appointment to Dr. Bahnson, and felt discouraged, but he never 
formally applied for such an appointment and never was rejected."
1027,21," The committee was composed of Drs. John Feist, radiology, Richard Deitrick, gynecology, Don Fisher, cardiology, David 
Hayeslip, pathology, Gerald Pifer, orthopedic surgery, and Arthur Murphy, general surgery. "
1028,22," Dr. Feist supplemented the inquiries that Mr. Grapski had made by mailing requests for information to Drs. Stanley Crawford, 
Michael DeBakey, Howard Baron and James Giacobine on January 16, 1976. "
1029,23," Dr. Magovern and Dr. Feist are personal friends who sometimes socialize together and who often confer on professional 
matters. "
1030,24," Dr. Robinson later testified that Dr. DeCapua initiated the confrontation and threw the first punch. Neither of the combatants 
filed charges and St. Francis did not take any disciplinary action."
1030,25," Counsel for the plaintiff has characterized the final sentence in Dr. Magovern's letter as a threat to terminate the thoracic 
surgery residency program if Allegheny General granted staff privileges to Dr. Robinson. We disagree with this characterization. 
Reading this sentence in context and keeping in mind the department director's role in achieving Allegheny General's 
institutional objectives, we believe that Dr. Magovern simply was advising Allegheny General that the appointment to the staff of 
surgeons who are not qualified to teach could jeopardize the accreditation of the residency program. Dr. Fisher, who was a 
member of the credentials committee, testified that he did not read the final sentence as a threat. Tr. 6046-47."
1030,26, Dr. Hayeslip did not attend the meeting. 
1031,27," Dr. Robinson has admitted that he was disappointed with the contents of Dr. Cooley's letter. AGH Exh. 1, at 234."
1031,28," Dr. Robinson's curriculum vitae also listed staff appointments at Pittsburgh, South Side and St. John's Hospitals."
1031,29," Dr. Feist testified that all members of the credentials committee felt that the submission of an application for staff privileges 
through an attorney under threat of legal retaliation ""was a very unusual and unseemly method of trying to obtain staff 
appointments."" Tr. 4124-25. "
1032,30," The voting members in attendance were Drs. Arthur Murphy, Frank Begg, M. Remsen Behrer, George Brodmerkel, Robert 
Hartsock, Claude Joyner, Laibe Kessler, Gerald Pifer and Mr. Grapski. Jt. Exh. 4. "
1036,31," Mr. Hewitt had known Dr. Robinson's parents in Washington, D. C. while Mr. Hewitt was serving in the United States Navy. At 
that time, John Robinson was a young boy. After Dr. Robinson moved to Pittsburgh to join Dr. Giacobine's service, he and his 
wife had dinner twice with Mr. and Mrs. Hewitt. During one of those dinners, Mr. Hewitt suggested to Dr. Robinson that he 
consider applying for staff privileges at Allegheny General. Based on this background, we assume that Mr. Hewitt was 
particularly conscientious in his examination of the matter."
1036,32," In the United States in 1979, open heart surgery consumed between $ 120,000,000 and $ 130,000,000 worth of products that 
were either implanted in the patients or disposed of after use in the operating room. Single-use products include oxygenators, 
tubing, filters, priming solutions (for the heart/lung machine), sutures, catheters and artificial valves. "
1041,33," The decision by some current open heart candidates from Western Pennsylvania to have their operations performed at 
hospitals with national reputations, such as the Texas Heart Institute, does not undermine our conclusion and does not support 
the existence of a national market. There always are a certain number of persons who feel more comfortable at a hospital that 
has a national reputation even though they could obtain comparable care closer to home. As Dr. Robinson stated, ""cardiac 
surgery … is a high risk surgery. People are very emotional about it …. They want reassurance, and so they want to go to an 
established man with a well-known reputation …."" Tr. 841. Also, there always are a certain number of referring physicians who 
personally know or who have acquired great professional respect for a surgeon at one of the national heart institutes, and 
therefore, they refer their patients to these out-of-state surgeons and hospitals. We believe that the percentage of open heart 
candidates who travel to the nationally known hospitals would remain relatively constant over time and would not respond to 
changes that occur within the Pittsburgh-based market. "
1042,34," Medical teams that perform complex and delicate procedures, such as open heart surgery, must perform a minimum number 
of procedures a week in order to maintain their proficiency. A community hospital could not generate the necessary volume of 
cases. "
1043,35," The area over which the suppliers realistically could provide the product has little meaning in the present case because the 
operating rooms cannot travel to the open heart patients. "
1044,36," This clustering of suppliers results from the financial reality that hospitals providing tertiary care must draw patients from an 
extensive population base in order to achieve optimal use of personnel and equipment. The City of Pittsburgh is the urban hub 
for the population living in extreme Eastern Ohio, Northern West Virginia and Southwestern Pennsylvania. By locating in 
Pittsburgh, the tertiary care facility maximizes its availability to the population base."
1044,37," Residents of many of these sixteen counties also could view the Cleveland Clinic as a realistic alternative to Allegheny 
General. Ninety-one residents of Southwestern Pennsylvania underwent open heart surgery at the Cleveland Clinic in 1976, 
while one hundred and three residents from this area underwent open heart surgery at West Penn Hospital. AGH Exh. 167a. 
Thus, the Cleveland Clinic already has a competitive presence in the core of the Pittsburgh hospitals' service area, and we 
would expect this presence to increase if the quality of care offered by one or more of the Pittsburgh hospitals was to decline. "
1045,38," The statistics given in the text for Allegheny General's share of the market actually overstate that share for two reasons. First, 
they do not reflect those open heart candidates from the relevant geographic market who underwent surgery at the Cleveland 
Clinic or at one of the other national open heart centers. Second, they include all patients who underwent open heart surgery at 
the six Pittsburgh hospitals rather than being limited to patients from the sixteen-county relevant market. In 1976, the six 
hospitals obtained 89% of their patients from the sixteen-county area; Allegheny General drew a higher percentage of its open 
heart patients from areas beyond the sixteen counties than did the other hospitals. Thus, the statistics presented in the text do 
not precisely reflect Allegheny General's share of the relevant geographic market. Nevertheless, the discrepancy is not important 
for our purposes because the statistics overstate that market share. "
1048,39," After a young surgeon achieves some recognition in the local medical community, he also may receive referrals from older 
physicians who have become dissatisfied with the surgeon whom they had been recommending."
1048,40," The figures for northern Allegheny County are based on an area designated by the Health Systems Agency rather than by the 
Allegheny County Health Department or by Allegheny General. Therefore, they may not precisely reflect Dr. Robinson's success 
in the area that he has proposed as the relevant geographic submarket. Nevertheless, the figures show that Dr. Robinson has 
not been precluded from competing against CTSA even in Allegheny General's ""backyard."" "
1049,41," The evidence in this case has focused on CTSA's large market share in Beaver County and northwestern Allegheny County. 
Competing surgical groups undoubtedly have similar dominant positions, however, in other sections of the relevant geographic 
market. For example, we quoted earlier from Dr. Robinson's testimony about the strong position that Dr. Giacobine has 
developed in the McKeesport area. Nevertheless, the existence of such referral patterns must not be permitted to obscure the 
crucial fact that referring physicians throughout the relevant geographic market are free to recommend any of the surgeons who 
operate at the six Pittsburgh open heart hospitals, and, as will be discussed, Dr. Robinson is on the staffs of three of those 
hospitals. "
1051,42," The fact that Dr. Magovern reiterated his objections to the Robinson application in conversations with Dr. Feist and Mr. 
Grapski, and that the latter two gentlemen ultimately voted against the application, does not establish a conspiracy if they made 
their decisions independently and in good faith. See Edward J. Sweeney & Sons, Inc. v. Texaco, Inc., 637 F.2d 105, 110-11 (3d 
Cir. 1980)."
1051,43," Mr. Sanders did not testify at trial. We found most of the testimony given by Mr. Grapski, Dr. Feist and Dr. Magovern to be 
credible. "
1053,44," Dr. Magovern, one of the two representatives on the executive committee, did not participate in the discussion or the vote on 
the Robinson application at either meeting of the executive committee, thus further weakening the effectiveness of the alleged 
conspiracy. "
1056,45," Drs. Gerber and Madoff had brought Dr. Pablo Hong-Barco into their association in July, 1976. Dr. Hong-Barco, a thoracic 
surgeon, performed most of his work at Shadyside. "
1057,46," The incident involving Dr. Gerber apparently was not the only time that Dr. Magovern has been abrasive in his relations with 
others. When asked by counsel to describe Dr. Magovern's demeanor, Dr. Howard Pfupajena, a former resident in thoracic 
surgery at Allegheny General, gave the following testimony: One, he is very tempermental; two, he is awfully difficult to get along with in the operating room; three, he is very demanding and 
domineering in the operating room; and, four, he frequently yelled and raised his voice. Tr. 2094. In fairness to Dr. Magovern, we must note that when Dr. Pfupajena gave this testimony, he had a lawsuit pending against 
Allegheny General and Dr. Magovern challenging the denial of his application for staff privileges. Dr. Pfupajena subsequently 
moved for voluntary dismissal of his lawsuit, and this Court granted the motion."
1057,47," We note that Dr. Robinson's reported earned income increased from $ 153,000 in 1976 to $ 245,000 in 1978. "
1058,48," Neither Mr. Grapski nor Dr. Feist had requested that Dr. Hallman supply a letter of recommendation. Therefore, the members 
of the credentials committee, other than Dr. Feist, would not have drawn a negative inference from the fact that Allegheny 
General had not received a letter from him. Dr. Hallman did submit a letter on behalf of Dr. Robinson on May 5, 1976, which was 
two months after the credentials committee made its decision. "
1059,49," These two disturbing pieces of evidence also would be consistent with a finding that Dr. Magovern and Mr. Sanders had the 
specific intent to exclude Dr. Robinson from the Allegheny General medical staff for noneconomic reasons."
1059,50, We will discuss the validity of these substantive reasons later in this opinion. See section VII(C)(5)(d) infra. 
1060,51," We are omitting from this statement, of course, the four members of these committees who the plaintiff alleges were the 
principal conspirators. "
1066,52," Dr. McCabe had been professionally associated with Dr. Ronald Pellegrini at Mercy Hospital for a two-year period spanning 
the years 1975 to 1977. This is the same Dr. Pellegrini who had written a letter to Allegheny General in which he criticized Dr. 
Barron. "
1067,53," In the cases of Dr. McCabe and Dr. Barron, we also must recognize the possibility that the pendency of Dr. Robinson's 
lawsuit made the various committees and the Board of Trustees hesitant to reject relatively strong, but flawed, applications. "
1070,54," We examine the allegation that Allegheny General did not provide notice of its criteria only in the context of Dr. Robinson's 
section 1 claim, and not as a component of his due process claim. The late Judge Daniel Snyder entered summary judgment in 
favor of the defendants on Count II of Dr. Robinson's complaint, which alleges a denial of due process and equal protection in 
violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and section 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 
42 U.S.C. § 1983 (1976 & Supp. III 1979). Judge Snyder based his ruling on the absence of the necessary state action element.  
Robinson v. Magovern, 456 F. Supp. 1000, 1007-08 (W.D.Pa.1978). The alleged failure of Allegheny General to inform 
applicants of the criteria that the hospital uses when evaluating applications could have antitrust implications because it could 
have the effect of favoring applicants with whom Allegheny General already is familiar or who have access to inside information 
about the application process, such as Allegheny General residents or surgeons whom Dr. Magovern has recruited for CTSA. "
1072,55," Our statement assumes that the absent surgeon is a sole practitioner or, if he is a member of a professional group, that none 
of his associates is available to cover for him."
1072,56," When asked at trial whether it was important for a cardiothoracic surgeon to have an even disposition, Dr. Magovern gave the 
following testimony: We are all using the same facilities …, and one has got to realize that in medicine the patients are ill; they are not themselves; 
their families are concerned; and the doctor is frequently confronted with situations in which nobody is acting like they are at a 
cocktail party or being particularly affable. The situation in medicine is getting particularly involved in terms of it bringing interdisciplinary dimensions …. You take an open-
heart case, for instance. You have anesthesia; you have profusionists; you have circulating nurses; operating nurses; surgeons. 
You maybe have 12 people in one room. And in addition to that you are calling upon the services of numerous laboratories. It is 
just a very complicated situation now in medicine, particularly in surgery, and people have got to The day of prima donna 
throwing instruments and so forth is just not there anymore. We have to learn to cooperate with people. So this is an important 
thing that we look for in evaluating people for the staff. "
1073,, Tr. 4965.
1073,57," Even cardiologists who practice solely at Allegheny General can refer cases to surgeons who do not have staff privileges at 
the hospital. Dr. Don Fisher, the Director of the Cardiac Laboratory at Allegheny General, testified that he will refer a patient to a 
surgeon who does not have staff privileges at Allegheny General when he believes that the non-Allegheny General surgeon is 
better qualified to treat the condition of that particular patient. Tr. 5997-98, 6068. "
1077,58," Drs. Liebler and McCabe had superb qualifications in both the clinical aspects and the academic aspects of cardiothoracic 
surgery. Drs. Park and Hong-Barco had the potential to substantially strengthen Allegheny General in the area of patient care. 
Drs. Burkholder and Barron had the potential to become major contributors to the education of the thoracic surgery residents. "
1078,59," The plaintiff emphasized at trial that Allegheny General granted staff privileges to Dr. Burkholder at approximately the same 
time that it denied him staff privileges. Dr. Robinson asks how the hospital can add a cardiothoracic surgeon to the staff at the 
same time that it gives a shortage of operating room time as one of the reasons for rejecting another surgeon's application. We 
believe that the answer lies in a combination of two considerations. First, the shortage of operating room time was a short term problem. As the junior member of an established group, Dr. 
Burkholder would not be expected to attract additional cases to Allegheny General during his first few years. Instead, he would 
be expected to reduce the burden on the senior members by handling some of the cases that they attracted to the hospital. 
Thus, the addition of Dr. Burkholder to the staff was not expected to materially change the total number of procedures that CTSA 
would perform at Allegheny General. Dr. Robinson, on the other hand, would have been more likely to bring cases to Allegheny 
General that otherwise would have been performed at another hospital. Second, Allegheny General did not view the shortage of operating room time as a determinative factor. The hospital was willing 
to accommodate an additional surgeon who had much to offer in return, but it was not willing to give scarce operating room time 
to a surgeon who would not contribute toward the attainment of Allegheny General's institutional objectives. "

of the record, a merits panel may determine, as in this case, that the district court's order, although it resolves novel or difficult 
issues, reflects no reversible legal error or abuse of discretion."

1092,12," .  Menasha's shareholders were apprised of the FTC's pending challenges when they voted to approve the merger. Our 
attention has not been directed to any divergence of interest between the privately held family corporation and its shareholders. 
Menasha stressed in the district court the interests of its shareholders in accomplishing the merger, thereby acquiring 
Weyerhaeuser shares in exchange for Menasha shares.  Correspondingly, on appeal, Menasha pressed the interests of the 
shareholders in retaining the Weyerhaeuser stock.  In light of the apparent coincidence of interest between Menasha and its 
shareholders, we are unpersuaded by Menasha's argument that, at this juncture, the shareholders should rank as indispensable 
parties whose absence requires dismissal of the appeal. "
1093,13," .  By affidavit, other North Bend area civic leaders indicated that they believed Weyerhaeuser had the incentive and ability to 
build the new mill. Affidavit of Jack L. Beebe (Coos County Commissioner) at 3, J.A. 1512 (Weyerhaeuser likely to keep a new 
mill open; it kept mills open when others shut down during recession); Affidavit of Norman Douglas Mills (vice president and

Paul H. Vishny, general counsel to the Association of Independent Corrugated Converters, agreed that the availability of 
linerboard is of even more concern to independent box manufacturers than the availability of corrugating medium. He believed 
that Weyerhaeuser's construction of a new linerboard mill would be especially beneficial since he understood that Weyerhaeuser 
already was a net seller of linerboard. J.A. 405.  John H. Waechter, a Weyerhaeuser vice president, confirmed that linerboard 
produced at the new mill would feed the open market rather than Weyerhaeuser's own box plants. J.A. 339."
1094,16," .  Weyerhaeuser vice president John H. Waechter testified that both the domestic and foreign markets for linerboard were 
viable, J.A. 339, and that Weyerhaeuser has an extensive international marketing effort.  J.A. 361 (testimony on cross-
examination).  And Thomas Williscroft, general manager of the North Bend medium mill, testified that the nearby mill site is a 
particularly attractive one since it adjoins an oceangoing deep water channel and has export possibilities.  J.A. 184-85 
(testimony on cross-examination).  See also Affidavit of Norman Douglas Mills (vice president and manager of local bank) at 2,

""construct compatible deep-water moorage for cargo-carrying freighters"")."
1094,17," .  The Commission argues that the beneficial effects flowing from construction of a linerboard mill at North Bend could have 
been achieved without Weyerhaeuser's acquisition of the North Bend medium mill-Menasha could have sold Weyerhaeuser only 
the undeveloped mill site or Menasha could have developed the site itself.  The FTC concedes, however, that Weyerhaeuser's 
initial interest was sparked by the vacant mill site (FTC's Proposed Findings 90 n.2, 98 n.1, J.A. 863, 867), and the district judge 
heard testimony that Menasha would neither sell the site without the other assets nor develop the site on its own.  J.A. 263, 284 
(testimony of Richard Johnson, chairman of Menasha's board of directors); J.A. 297-98 (cross-examination of Johnson); J.A. 175 
(testimony of Thomas Williscroft, general manager of North Bend mill)."
1094,18," .  We reject the FTC's argument that, because the district judge refused to credit Weyerhaeuser's claims that it would expand 
production at the North Bend corrugating medium mill in a procompetitive way, 1981-1 Trade Cas. P 63,974, at 76,046, he acted 
capriciously in finding that Weyerhaeuser intended to build a new linerboard mill. The testimony regarding the two expansions 
differed.  In particular, there was evidence that Menasha had recently made numerous improvements at the North Bend medium 
mill. J.A. 181-82 (cross-examination of Thomas Williscroft, general manager of the North Bend medium mill).  The district judge 
might have concluded either that additional improvements to the mill were not indicated or that, if improvements were necessary, 
Menasha, if it stayed in the paperboard products business on the West Coast, would make them.  But see J.A. 261 (testimony of 
Richard Johnson, chairman of Menasha's board of directors, that Menasha would not further improve the mill).  By contrast, the 
FTC itself urged the judge to note that ""Weyerhaeuser's interest in the (undeveloped) mill site pre-date(d) its interest in the North 
Bend (medium) mill."" The Commission further pointed to the scarcity of such sites. FTC's Proposed Findings 98 n.1, J.A. 867.  In "
1095,," his zeal to recast the undeveloped mill site as an afterthought to make weight, our dissenting colleague turns a blind eye to 
these Commission-acknowledged factors.  See Dissent at  -- ,  -- ,  -- ."

] In the absence of any preliminary restraint, the prospect of ultimate divestiture may not prevent permanent 
anticompetitive harm.  An acquisition, if initially unchecked, may be attended by the transfer of confidential information or the 
scrambling of management, books, and assets.  See FTC v. Dean Foods Co., 384 U.S. 597, 606-07 n.5, 86 S. Ct. 1738, 1744

court or the Commission that divestiture of the unlawfully acquired assets would be unduly burdensome because those assets 
had become inextricably intertwined with the defendant's operations.  In at least three cases this argument succeeded and the 
defendants were allowed to keep their illegally acquired assets.  Pfunder, Plaine & Whittemore, Compliance with Divestiture

1101,43," .  Whether the district court's presentation of its findings is protracted or terse, see Dissent note 26, our task is to determine 
whether those findings are adequately supported in the record.  Earlier in this opinion, we explained our conclusion, based on 
our review of the record, that the findings in point may not be dismissed as clearly erroneous.  See pp.  --  -  --  supra. "

medium mill. See, e.g., J.A. 119-22, 124-25 (testimony of John Presson, Weyerhaeuser containerboard logistics manager); J.A. 
153-54 (testimony of Cornelius Roosevelt Duffie, Willamette Industries chairman of the board); J.A. 176 (testimony of Thomas 
Williscroft, general manager of North Bend mill).  But see J.A. 495-96 (cross-examination of FTC's expert witness, Walter J. 
Mead) (medium production may be restricted by shutting down a mill or a production line)."
1102,46," .  Shortcomings in the order, including those our dissenting colleague notes, appear susceptible to cure without extraordinary 
effort on the part of the district court and the FTC.  Nor do we believe the district court lacks means to check blatant 
circumvention should Weyerhaeuser attempt it.  In such an event, a divestiture order need not await termination of the 
administrative proceedings. En passant, we note that the Menasha enterprise is not a ""ghost"" but remains alive and well.  Cf. Dissent note 8.  Menasha 
sought the merger to tighten, not to abandon, its operations. In addition to insisting that a 13(b) restraint must be an all or nothing proposition, and attempting to reduce to insignificance the 
undeveloped mill site that first sparked Weyerhaeuser's interest in a transaction with Menasha, the dissenting opinion sounds 
and replays a third theme: the incompetence of courts to administer effectively a short-term hold separate order.  We fully agree 
that such orders should not be routine.  Section 7 of the Clayton Act HN16[
] is preventive in nature.  Rather than relying 
dominantly on the government or the courts to punish individual wrongdoers, Section 7's thrust is to promote the maintenance of 
vigorous competition as the prime deterrent to anticompetitive acts such as artificial reductions in output.  Cf.  15 U.S.C. § 1 
(prohibiting conspiracies in restraint of trade); id. § 45(a) (prohibiting unfair methods of competition).  Accordingly, hold separate 
orders should be entered only upon close analysis of the particular case, using the three-pronged test we have stated.  
However, we are less fearful than our dissenting colleague that the district court administering a hold separate order is destined 
to wander ""lost in a labyrinth."" See Dissent at 1093.  We emphasize that the court below imposed a hold separate order with 
respect to an independent, self-sufficient, economically attractive entity, producing a fungible product.  In light of far more 
complex orders district courts actively supervise when called upon by the law to exercise ""independent judgment"" in shaping 
equitable relief, see, e.g., Chayes, The Role of the Judge in Public Law Litigation, 89 Harv.L.Rev. 1281 (1976), we do not share "
1103,," the dissenting opinion's view that courts are so ill-equipped to grapple with a business venture that they must steer clear of a 
hold separate order even when such a restraint would guard against anticompetitive harm, preserve the viability of divestiture, 
and secure benefits to the public and private parties that a full stop order would jeopardize."
1103,47, .  This fact is undisputed.  See Brief of Appellant at 6.
1103,48," .  See, e.g., Internal Revenue Service Application of Menasha Corp. and its Shareholders and Weybuy, Inc. for Rulings (FTC 
Exhibit 51), at 18-19, J.A. 1244-45 (describing independence of West Coast operations and explaining why each of those 
assets, including the North Bend medium mill, are separately managed); J.A. 168 (testimony of Thomas Williscroft, general 
manager of North Bend mill) (he has entire authority for medium mill except for distribution).  The FTC's own expert witness 
testified that if the parties ""rigorously followed"" a hold separate order, separating the North Bend medium mill from 
Weyerhaeuser would be ""no great problem."" J.A. 657 (testimony of Walter J. Mead in response to court inquiry)."

in acquiring Menasha's assets.  See J.A. 271-73, 277 (testimony of Richard Johnson, chairman of Menasha's board of 
directors).  Any of these companies might be interested in buying the North Bend medium mill from Weyerhaeuser. The availability of potential purchasers of the North Bend mill does not mean that Menasha could have readily sold its assets to 
one of these companies rather than to Weyerhaeuser.  Menasha sought to negotiate the sale of its assets in utmost 
confidentiality and to dispose of all its West Coast paperboard product facilities.  See, e.g., J.A. 287 (cross-examination of 
Richard Johnson); J.A. 328 (testimony of John H. Waechter, Weyerhaeuser vice president).  These conditions might have been 
considerably more difficult to satisfy than an openly advertised sale of the medium mill alone. "

entrant into corrugating medium market-company produces 600 tons per day of medium, but owns no timberlands or corrugated 
container plants), J.A. 1459-60. A further divestiture device is a spin-off to some of the acquiring company's own shareholders. Where the divesting company is 
owned by a large number of shareholders, and control is not concentrated in a few hands, a spin-off can be effective in creating 
an independent company owned by the same shareholders as the divesting company on a pro rata basis.  See Pfunder, Plaine 
& Whittemore, supra note 31, at 50-54 n.38."
1104,52," .  We noted earlier the FTC's assertion that ""(the) hold-separate ""remedy' substituted by the district court has been found 
inappropriate in every known horizontal merger case in which the plaintiff sought a preliminary injunction and demonstrated the 
necessary likelihood of success and interim competitive harm."" Brief of Appellant at 54 (emphasis in original).  Generally, 
however, the authorities in point do not reject the hold separate order categorically.  Rather, decisions turn on the particular 
circumstances presented.  The test we have outlined should secure merger-blocking preliminary injunctions when a lesser 
restraint would be inadequate or unmanageable without shrinking the court's obligation to exercise independent judgment in 
selecting and tailoring the remedy to fit the case at hand."
1104,53," .  By separate order entered today, we have directed that, effective ten days from this date, the motions panel's order shall be

 -- .  I do not understand why Congress would have bothered to specify both of those, but not hold-separate orders, if the 
majority is correct in its assumption that Congress intended that any form of preliminary restraint could be granted.  Instead, it 
seems logical to assume that the two forms of relief specified in the statute are included because both prevent mergers likely to 
be illegal, while hold-separate orders were not included because they do not achieve that result.  The acknowledged history of 
hold-separate orders at the time section 13(b) was passed makes the absence of such a remedy from the statute more 
compelling.  I cannot understand how a court can insinuate ""several hundred years of history"" into a legislative product that 
neither by its terms nor its history allows such flexibility.  See id."
1105,6," .  It is unclear whether the majority would uphold even a hold-separate order under 13(b) when the FTC's proof of a likelihood of 
success on the merits is weak, particularly since, in its view, a hold-separate order suffices when the FTC makes a strong 
showing of a likelihood of success on the merits."

Menasha's ghost report to the court within ten days of entry of this order concerning what, if any, additional management and sales personnel are 
needed to operate the North Bend Mill as an independent competitor in the West Coast corrugating medium market, and within 
thirty days of the entry of this order, recruit such personnel, if any, as may be necessary to fill those positions(?) Joint Appendix (J.A.) 1035B.  The district court also ordered Weybuy, which cases to exist with the consummation of the merger, 
to report plans for expansion within sixty days.  J.A. 1035C.  These ghosts may haunt the district court, but they are unlikely to 
file reports, recruit personnel, or plan expansions. The hold-separate order creates problems for humans as well.  What will former Menasha employees do with their Menasha 
stock, which becomes Weyerhaeuser stock lawfully owned but which, under the hold-separate order, they may not own?  See

receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them: Provided, That nothing herein contained shall 
prevent differentials which make only due allowance for differences in the cost of manufacture, sale, or delivery resulting from 
the differing methods of quantities in which such commodities are to such purchasers sold or delivered: Provided, however, That 
the Federal Trade Commission may, after due investigation and hearing to all interested parties, fix and establish quantity limits, "
1120,," and revise the same as it finds necessary, as to particular commodities or classes of commodities, where it finds that available 
purchasers in greater quantities are so few as to render differentials on account thereof unjustly discriminatory or promotive of 
monopoly in any line of commerce; and the foregoing shall then not be construed to permit differentials based on differences in 
quantities greater than those so fixed and established: And provided further, That nothing herein contained shall prevent persons 
engaged in selling goods, wares, or merchandise in commerce from selecting their own customers in bona fide transactions and 
not in restraint of trade: And provided further, That nothing herein contained shall prevent price changes from time to time where 
in response to changing conditions affecting the market for or the marketability of the goods concerned, such as but not limited 
to actual or imminent deterioration of perishable goods, obsolescence of seasonal goods, distress sales under court process, or 
sales in good faith in discontinuance of business in the goods concerned. Burden of rebutting prima-facie case of discrimination (b) Upon proof being made, at any hearing on a complaint under this section, that there has been discrimination in price or 
services or facilities furnished, the burden of rebutting the prima-facie case thus made by showing justification shall be upon the 
person charged with a violation of this section, and unless justification shall be affirmatively shown, the Commission is 
authorized to issue an order terminating the discrimination: Provided, however, That nothing herein contained shall prevent a 
seller rebutting the prima-facie case thus made by showing that his lower price or the furnishing of services or facilities to any 
purchaser or purchasers was made in good faith to meet an equally low price of a competitor, or the services or facilities 
furnished by a competitor."
1120,7," Section 2(b), see note 5 supra, does state that once price discrimination has been shown, the burden of rebutting the prima 
facie case lies with the defendant. Yet the term ""price discrimination"" in § 2(a) should not be considered synonymous with the 
term ""price discrimination"" in § 2(b). Otherwise a mere price differential would establish a prima facie case, a result clearly at 
odds with the construction of § 2(a). See FTC v. Anheuser-Busch Inc., 363 U.S. 536, 542-43, 80 S. Ct. 1267, 1270-1271, 4 L. 
Ed. 2d 1385 (1960) (competitive harm is an element of a statutory violation). "
1121,8," Section 2 of the Clayton Act was of course later amended by the Robinson-Patman Act in 1936. The Robinson-Patman 
amendments, however, were principally concerned with secondary line competition. For a primary line case involving the issues 
presented to us here, the relevant legislative history is that of the Clayton Act."
1121,9," It could be maintained that the jury's findings of liability or the Robinson-Patman claim was inconsistent with its finding of no 
liability on the § 2 Sherman Act claim. In Janich Bros., Inc. v. American Distilling Co., 570 F.2d 848, 855 (9th Cir. 1977), cert. 
denied, 439 U.S. 829, 99 S. Ct. 103, 58 L. Ed. 2d 122 (1978), the court stated that for price differentials threatening primary line 
competition, § 2(a) of the Clayton Act as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, has the same substantive content as § 2 of the 
Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2 (1976). The court consequently held that any error of the district court in directing a verdict for the 
defendant on the § 2 Sherman Act claim was harmless, because the jury had found for the defendant on the Robinson-Patman 
claims. See also, Areeda and Turner, 88 Harv.L.Rev. at 727. This view is not unanimous. It has been suggested that a § 2 "
1122,," Sherman Act monopolization claim differs from a § 2(a) Robinson-Patman claim, since § 2 of the Sherman Act requires a 
dangerous probability of success and a specific intent to control prices or destroy competition. See generally ABA Antitrust 
Section, Monograph No. 4, The Robinson-Patman Act: Policy and Law, Vol. I (1980). Since plaintiffs do not contend on appeal 
that the verdicts were inconsistent, and since our resolution of this case does not require us to meet this issue, we do not resolve 
whether Sherman Act liability is identical to Robinson-Patman liability for price differentials threatening primary line competition."
1122,10," Of course, if Ferro made its prices public, there is a likelihood that Ferro would have been obliged to offer the lower prices to 
its other customers."
1122,11," HN8[
] ""Average cost is the sum of fixed cost and total variable cost divided by output."" Areeda and Turner, Predatory Pricing and Related Practices Under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 88 Harv.L.Rev. 697, 700 (1975). Fixed costs are those which 
do not vary with changes in output, and variable costs are costs which do vary with changes in output. Id. Variable costs typically 
include such items as materials, fuel, labor directly used to produce the product, repair and maintenance, etc. Average variable 
cost is the sum of all variable costs divided by output and is by definition lower than average cost. "
1123,12," HN9[
] Marginal cost is the increment to total cost that results from producing an additional increment of output. It is a 
function solely of variable costs, since fixed costs, by definition, are costs unaffected by changes in output. Marginal cost usually 
decreases over low levels of output and increases as production approaches plant capacity. Id. Areeda and Turner conclude that a price above reasonably anticipated short-run marginal cost is non-predatory.  Id. at 733; III P. 
Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law, § 711d at 153 (1978). Areeda and Turner deem pricing above marginal cost to be non-
predatory because ""if a monopolist produces to a point where price equals marginal cost, only less efficient firms will suffer 
larger losses per unit of input…"" Areeda & Turner, 88 Harv.L.Rev. at 711. Marginal cost pricing also maximizes social welfare by 
avoiding the ""wasteful idling of current productive resources."" Areeda and Turner, Williamson on Predatory Pricing, 87 Yale L.J. 
1337, 1339 (1978). See also Northeastern Telephone Co. v. American Telephone and Telegraph Co., 651 F.2d 76, at 87-88 (2d 
Cir. 1981); Chillicothe Sand & Gravel Co. v. Martin Marietta Corp., 615 F.2d 427, 431 (7th Cir. 1980). Where there is perfect 
competition a firm maximizes profits by continuing production until marginal cost equals the market price. Areeda and Turner, 88 
Harv.L.Rev. at 702. For a monopolist, however, an increase in output will reduce the market price and thus, ""the incremental 
(marginal) revenue to the monopolist from selling an additional unit is the lower price received for that unit, minus the revenue 
lost for selling all other units at the lower price."" Id. at 703. A monopolist maximizes profit when marginal revenue equals 
marginal cost.  Id. at 703, n.19. Areeda and Turner use average variable cost as a substitute for marginal cost because average variable cost is easier to 
ascertain. When average variable cost is constant, it is equal to marginal cost, when average variable cost is declining, it is 
greater than marginal cost, and when average variable cost is increasing, it is less than the marginal cost.  Id. at 718. Areeda 
and Turner would have a court presume that a price at or above average variable cost is lawful. P. Areeda and D. Turner, 
Antitrust Law, § 711d at 154 (1978). "
1124,13," As noted earlier, see note 8 supra, the 1936 Robinson-Patman amendments were almost entirely concerned with the effects 
of price discrimination at the secondary level."
1124,54," Selective price-cutting might, however, be more likely to occur than general price-cuts, since the monopolist's losses on 
selective reductions would be smaller."
1124,14," The predator must have the capacity to meet the new demand. Areeda & Turner, 88 Harv.L.Rev. at 718. "
1125,15," Williamson, Predatory Pricing: A Strategic and Welfare Analysis, 87 Yale L.J. 284 (1977)."
1125,16," Williamson asserts that prices must be remunerative, foreseeing that if over the long run, a firm keeps its price of a product 
below average cost, it will not recover all its expenses.  Id. at 321-22. This, of course, need not be the result in selective price 
discrimination. There, even though below-average cost sales to a select number of customers may result in ""losses"" on those 
sales, the above-average cost sales made during the same relative period can result in a full recovery of costs. Williamson also employs an average cost test because of the hypothetical situation where firms in the same industry have 
different technologies. One capital intensive firm may have high fixed costs, and low variable costs, while its competitors may 
have low fixed costs and high variable costs. The capital intensive firm may not be more efficient than its competitors, but may 
engage in predatory pricing (and drive out its competitors) by pricing above its average variable cost but below the average 
variable cost of its competitors. Id. at 321. See also R. Posner, Antitrust Law 191-93 (1976). We fail to understand how this 
justification applies when firms share the same technology, such as in this case. "
1126,17," No evidence exists that Ferro's pricing tended to create a monopoly. Indeed the jury decided otherwise by finding for Ferro on 
the § 2 Sherman Act claim. "
1127,18," We also note that at the time the jury handed down its verdict, De Long had not been decided. "
1130,1," Marginal cost is the cost of manufacturing ""the last unit."" Variable costs are costs that vary with changes in output, as 
distinguished from ""fixed costs,"" which remain constant despite changes in output. The use of variable cost as a substitute for 
marginal cost is not an issue in this case. "
1131,1," Actually the grounds advanced in support of the motion refined Ferro's position somewhat. They included: (a) The proofs, taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, O. Hommel Company, establish as a matter of law, that 
defendant, in pricing its product above its average variable cost to produce such product, did not injure, lessen or adversely 
affect competition within the frit industry or otherwise violate any of the standards set down by the Robinson-Patman 
Amendment to the Clayton Act. (b) Based upon the proofs adduced at trial, taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the jury could not reasonably 
conclude that defendant sold either porcelain enamel or pottery frit in the relevant market between 1973 and 1977 at a price 
below its average variable cost to produce. (I A, 163-64). (Emphasis supplied). Thus it sought a ruling that in all circumstances sales at prices above average direct manufacturing costs, excluding other 
variable costs, were in a primary line Robinson-Patman case as a matter of law permissible. As noted in the text, there was 
evidence from which the jury could infer that some variable costs were excluded from Ferro's calculation of its average variable 
cost to produce."
1131,2," Arguably the contention about Hommel's steady market share was advanced at least cryptically in the motion for a directed 
verdict (III A, 517). The contention was not made to or discussed by the trial court in the post-trial proceeding. (I A, 195-210). "
1134,3," Ferro's attorney argued: On the Robinson-Patman Act, we have two bases for our motion. One, that in a like competition case, there is the same 
requisite for showing damage to competition. All, again, that has been shown is that Hommel might have gotten sales. That is 
the best that was testified to. Nobody their market share was the same; nobody was excluded from the market. Easy entry into 
the market is all established at this juncture by the evidence. (III A, 517)."
1134,4," But cf.  Cone v. West Virginia Pulp & Paper Co., 330 U.S. 212, 67 S. Ct. 752, 91 L. Ed. 849 (1947); Globe Liquor Co. v. San

1135,5," The court charged: (I) instruct you that only lost net profits, before taxes, may constitute an item of actual damages in antitrust cases. Net profit 
before tax is the total revenue received from sales minus the cost of the goods sold, including labor and material costs, and 
minus operating expenses and overhead. (III A, 939). "
1138,1," .  Strax purports to sue ""(on) behalf of himself and all others similarly situated (i. e., persons who liquidated their net short 
positions in silver futures contracts traded in the United States, between August 17, 1979 and March 26, 1980, inclusive)."" 
Complaint P 1.  A sharply contested motion for class certification is pending. "
1139,2," .  Strax has by letter withdrawn his fifth claim which is brought under the Texas antitrust laws, Tex.Bus. & Com.Code Ann. c. 15, 
his seventh claim for ""violation of the common law"" (Complaint P 50) including common law manipulation, monopoly and 
restraint of trade, and his tenth claim for fraud.  Letter of Christopher Lovell, dated January 15, 1981.  During oral argument on 
the motions to dismiss, counsel for Strax also withdrew any claims under Rule 31.03 of the CFTC, 17 C.F.R. 31.03, under the 
rules and regulations of Comex and the CBOT, under §§ 4a and 4b of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. §§ 6a, 6b, and any claims for aiding 
and abetting relating to those withdrawn claims.  Strax also limited his claims under § 9(b) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. § 13(b), to 
claims under the first and second subclauses of that section.  See letter of Florence Ann Davis, counsel for Bache, dated July 
27, 1981.  Strax has not agreed to withdraw his claims with prejudice, and defendants request that the court decide their motions 
to dismiss the withdrawn claims with prejudice.  However, since the claims have been withdrawn, the motions to dismiss them 
are moot."
1139,3," .  Two other motions to dismiss, one by Conti and one by the exchanges, were filed before the Second Circuit's decision in Leist 
v. Simplot, 638 F.2d 283 (2d Cir. 1980), which held that the CEA created a private right of action. To the extent these motions 
are based on the argument that there is no private right of action under the CEA, they are denied based on Leist.  To the extent 
they are based on other grounds, those grounds are also the basis of the motions listed in the text above, and are disposed of in 
the same way as indicated below."

1142,9," .  Defendants argue that they cannot be liable under the antitrust laws for actions compelled by the CEA or by the regulations 
promulgated pursuant to the CEA.  Specifically, they contend that they cannot be liable for allegedly allowing the Hunts to 
""pyramid"" their silver holdings (Complaint P 31(gg)) because they were required by the CEA to ""treat a customer's trading profits 
as the property of that customer"" under 17 C.F.R. § 1.2 (1980).  Paragraph 31(gg) of the complaint alleges that the defendants 
facilitated the conspiracy to corner the silver market and to manipulate the price of silver in various ways.  It does not follow from 
the directive to treat the customer's profits as the customer's property that one is compelled to facilitate a conspiracy such as 
that alleged here."

1143,13," .  It is true that Strax does not claim to have traded on the CBOT.  However, he alleges that the Comex and the CBOT are in 
effect one market, and that price manipulation on one directly affects the price on the other.  Complaint P 28.  Nevertheless, the 
failure to state in the complaint that he traded on the Comex renders the complaint defective as to the CBOT as well.  The 
complaint against the CBOT will also be dismissed if the amended complaint to be filed within twenty days does not include 
appropriate allegations as to CBOT. "
1144,14," .  Comex and the CBOT move alternatively pursuant to Rules 12(f) and 12(e), Fed.R.Civ.P., to strike the exhibits to the 
complaint and for a more definite statement.  The exhibits to the complaint include a transcript of the proceedings before the 
Commerce Consumer and Monetary Affairs Subcommittee of the House Government Operations Committee, newspaper and 
magazine articles, and a schedule 13D filed by the Bache Group.  Defendants do not specify which of these exhibits they believe 
is ""redundant, immaterial, impertinent or scandalous."" nor point to any specific material in them which they contend should be 
stricken, but merely quote the rule.  We have reviewed the material and while its probative value is questionable, it nevertheless 
is not improper.  The motion to strike is therefore denied. The motion for a more definite statement is based on Strax's failure to specify in his complaint which sections of the statute and 
the CFTC regulations he claims to have been violated.  However, at oral argument he has now made clear on which sections he 
relies, see note 2 supra.  However, this is not a substitute for stating in the complaint precisely what Strax's claims are.  
Accordingly, the motion will be granted in twenty days unless Strax files an amended complaint stating under which sections of 
the CEA his claims are brought. "
1145,," The exchange defendants also seek a more definite statement as to what alleged conduct was actionable and how Strax was 
damaged by it.  The complaint alleges that the contract markets failed to act to prevent the alleged conspiracy to manipulate 
silver prices, which caused the price of silver to soar and then to plummet.  The complaint further alleges that Strax liquidated a 
net short position in silver contracts at the time the silver prices were high.  Thus, the complaint sufficiently alleges how Strax 
was injured by the actions of the exchange defendants."
1145,15," .  The motion to dismiss the claims under 7 U.S.C. §§ 6b, 6a, and Rule 31.02, 17 C.F.R. § 31.03, and for common law joint tort 
and fraud are moot as a result of Strax's withdrawal of those claims.  See note 2 supra."
1145,16," .  It should be noted that the history of section 13c(a) differs from sections 6a, 6b, 7(d), 7a(8) and 13(b) which Leist held to have 
impliedly created private judicial causes of action.  The Leist majority relied on the proposition that prior to the enactment of the 
1974 amendments to the CEA it had been well-established that private causes of action were available under the statute, and 
Congress did not take the opportunity to amend the statute in this respect.  Neither prior to 1974 nor after has any court held that 
section 13c(a) opened the door of the federal courthouse to private litigants.  Accordingly Congress cannot be said to have 
ratified the concept of a private right existing under section 13c(a). "
1146,17," .  ""It shall be a felony punishable by a fine of not more than $ 500,000 or imprisonment for not more than five years, or both,

Court found such an approach to be improper.  The Court of Appeals had ruled separately with regard to the five episodes which 
comprised the case, each of them containing evidence concerning damage to plaintiff by one of the defendants.  Justice White, 
speaking for the Court, found it apparent that the Court of Appeals approached Continental's claims as if they were five completely separate and unrelated lawsuits.  We 
think this was improper.  In cases such as this, plaintiffs should be given the full benefit of their proof without tightly 
compartmentalizing the various factual components and wiping the slate clean after scrutiny of each.  370 U.S. at 698-99. See also Schine Chain Theatres v. United States, 334 U.S. 110, 119, 68 S. Ct. 947, 952, 92 L. Ed. 1245 (1948). "

] A product market may contain relevant submarkets. See, e.g., Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, supra; Reynolds Metals Co. v. FTC, 114 U.S. App. D.C. 2, 309 F.2d 223, 227 (D.C.Cir.1962)."
1158,21, Long Lines is the department of AT&T that provides intercity telecommunications services. 
1159,22," There is no contest concerning the formulation of the local services market and little dispute on that of the intercity services 
market."
1159,23," That issue does not relate exclusively to procurement, however, and the market problems discussed in Part X also touch 
upon the terminal equipment interconnection claims."
1159,24," They also contend that the existence of maximum rate-of-return regulation at both the federal and state levels precludes as a 
matter of law a finding that they possess monopoly power, but this point is clearly without merit.  The government offered 
abundant evidence to support its contentions that the regulatory process does not succeed, in fact, in ensuring that defendants 
will not transfer excess profits to Western Electric (by including excessively priced equipment purchased by the Operating 
Companies in their rate base), or in preventing defendants from cross-subsidizing underpriced services with revenues from 
overpriced areas.  It remains to be seen whether this evidence will ultimately be refuted; but the Court will not assume refutation 
as a matter of law.  See 3 Areeda & Turner, Antitrust Law, P 726e, pp. 217-20 (1978)."
1159,25," As defendants see it, the relevant markets may be defined only by reference to the regulatory framework and that, by failing 
to do so, the government's calculations inaccurately measure their market power."
1159,26, The situation is analogized to an examination of market share of the holder of a patent one day after the patent has expired.
1159,27," Even conceptually, however, the argument suffers from the defect that it must necessarily ignore the fact that Western Union 
provided intercity services well before the FCC opened the market to wider entry.  This, of course, weakens any claim of a 
competitive market vacuum prior to the relevant regulatory decisions."

1160,31," Size is typically described as an ""earmark of monopoly power,"" United States v. Griffith, supra, 334 U.S. at 107 n. 10, 68 S. 
Ct. at 941, and although this may be true, size does not alone establish market power.  It is, on the one hand, redundant with 
market share data, and, on the other, in the absence of significant barriers to entry, it is undeterminative on the existence of 
market power.  With regard to the problems occasioned by inferring power from conduct, see 2 Areeda & Turner, supra, P 515, 
at pp. 344-45."
1160,32," At present, at least, the FCC is not authorizing interconnection restrictions, and thus Communications Act regulation could not 
be an antitrust defense in relation to such barriers."
1160,33," Since 1960, the Bell Operating Companies have provided local exchange service for over 80 percent of all telephones in the 
United States, and they have collected 85 percent of all local service revenues.  Most of the largest metropolitan areas are 
served at least in part by one of the Operating Companies."
1160,34," See generally United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, 148 F.2d 416 (2d Cir. 1945); United States v. E. I. du Pont de

1704; United States v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 110 F. Supp. 295, 340-44 (D.Mass.1953)."
1160,35," Defendants may discharge that obligation, if they should so choose, by proving, for example, that the government's market 
share data are obsolete or inaccurate and that more recent and more precise calculations show defendants' shares of the 
relevant markets to have dropped significantly to low levels and that forecasts predict that they will continue to fall.  Such proof 
would contradict the existence of significant barriers to entry, for a reduction in Bell's share would imply that barriers no longer 
furnish monopoly power. In any event, defendants must offer such evidence as part of their own case, and neither one 
government witness's reference to ""explosive competition"" nor one competitor's comment that he has as much business as he 
can handle suffices to overcome the government's substantial overall evidence to the contrary."
1160,36," Some of the ""conduct"" evidence also relates to the element of willfulness, i. e., intent."
1160,37," This tariff stated in part that No equipment, apparatus, circuit or device not furnished by the telephone company shall be attached to or connected with the 
facilities furnished by the telephone company, whether physically, by induction or otherwise. "

1161,39," That is, a residential user of telephone service who might wish to purchase his own telephone apparatus from a non-Bell 
source, or a business customer who desired to attach and use more sophisticated non-Bell equipment, such as switchboards or 
repertory dialers."

1161,41," There was evidence that such equipment never caused any actual harm to the network (see episodes 50, 52, 54, 56, 60), that 
from an engineering standpoint, the PCAs were not necessary to protect the network from harm (see episodes 44, 54, 55A), and 
that pieces of identical equipment, when purchased by Western Electric from the general trade and installed by Bell Operating 
Companies, were not subject to the PCA requirement (see episodes 46, 50, 55A, and 60).  (References herein to episodes as 
supporting various statements are meant to include both the actual stipulations contained in the stipulation packages and the

1161,43," When PCAs were unavailable, the particular non-Bell equipment could not be installed at all consistently with the Bell tariffs 
(episodes 44, 45, 54, and 56); when they were delayed, equipment manufacturers were unable to meet their installation 
schedules (see episodes 44, 45, 50, 52, and 54); when they were incompatible, the non-Bell manufacturer had to redesign his 
own equipment (see episodes 52, 54 and 55A)."

1162,45, Episode 42.
1162,46," Defendants have suggested, by way of cross-examination, that the certification option would have had its own drawbacks 
(especially delay), but concrete and sufficient proof, particularly regarding the magnitude of these drawbacks, has yet to be 
adduced."
1162,47," Defendants have argued that they were obligated by law to enforce their filed and effective tariffs, but these tariffs were their 
own creation, and they could have cancelled them at any time.  See 47 C.F.R. § 61.57."
1162,48," Plaintiff's Exhibits 1075, 1076, 1090, 1105, 2055, and 2064."
1162,49," According to the government's evidence, the technical standards upon which a certification program could have been based 
were available as early as 1968, and defendants' own engineers had developed proposals to implement such a program by 
1971.  See testimony of Vladislav Bevc, and Plaintiff's Exhibits 1073 and 1084."

1162,52," Plaintiff's Exhibits 1069, 1086, 1097, and 1104.  The evidence also indicated that the PCAs were not designed to protect 
against all of the recognized harms to the network, that they were overly restrictive, that the functions they performed were often 
redundant, and that they served to degrade rather than to enhance telephone service.  See testimony of Vladislav Bevc, and 
Plaintiff's Exhibits 1477, 1973, and 1969."
1162,53, Docket No. 19528.
1162,54," Plaintiff's Exhibits 1103, 1106, 2024, 2034, 2037, 2039, 2040, 2082, 2093, and 2097.  Much of the evidence in this regard 
relates to AT&T's internal planning.  However, the government also sought to prove that when the FCC finally did adopt a 
registration program in 1975 (see 56 F.C.C.2d 593) defendants, after having consistently opposed this concept on the ground 
that the network would be insufficiently protected, filed extensive recommendations for the relaxation of the technical standards 
which they themselves had originally proposed to the FCC.  This change in policy was allegedly stimulated by the circumstance 
that the standards would be imposed upon Bell as well as non-Bell equipment.  See stipulation paragraphs 736-745 in episode "
1163,42," ; Plaintiff's Exhibits 1287, 2086, 2088, 2089.  However, since this proof directly concerns the positions taken by defendants 
before the FCC, the Court may not rely upon it as a basis for antitrust liability.  See Part VII, infra."
1163,55," For example, the credibility of both John Van Doorne (episode 54) and Vladislav Bevc (episode 42) as expert witnesses was 
undermined to some extent by defendants' questioning, and the cross-examination of Neil Buglewicz (episode 45) and Robert 
Feiner (episode 54) raised doubts as to the quality of the products they sold.  On the other hand, the testimony in support of 
some of the episodes was quite convincing: see episodes 44 (Ronny Harlow); 46 (James Owen); 50 (Lowell Hoxie); 52 (Pier 
Abetti); 60 (Robin Moseley)."
1163,56," See, e.g., testimony of Ronny Harlow; testimony of Francis Collins.  These witnesses also conceded that reasonable means 
may be employed to ensure that such interconnection will not cause physical injury or other adverse effects."

1163,60," The term ""harm"" includes several disparate conditions, from the immediate and potentially drastic consequences of excess 
voltage to barely audible noise on the telephone line."
1163,61," In this respect, defendants relied to some considerable degree upon the report of a panel of the National Academy of 
Science.  That report is not yet in evidence for its truth, and its reliability has not yet been explored."
1163,62," Foreign, agricultural, and other non-Bell-controlled equipment has always been attached to the network, apparently without 
causing substantial harm.  The burden is on defendants to demonstrate that their ""pollution"" theory of incremental harms is valid. "
1164,63," On AT&T's good faith, see, for example, Plaintiff's Exhibit 2064; on the business ability issue, see, e.g., testimony of Lowell 
Hoxie."
1164,64," Additionally, the success of some general trade products for which there was no Western counterpart (e.g., call restricters, 
episode 54) would have directly decreased AT&T revenues from intercity services."
1164,65," See note 17, supra.  The local monopoly is a lawful one. "
1165,66, The meaning of that standard for purposes of this case is discussed in Part VI infra.
1165,67," As to the issue of whether the antitrust laws or some other statutory scheme governs defendants' conduct in this case, see 
Part V, infra."
1165,68," Evidence was introduced in conjunction with the following episodes: 10 (Early Video); 11 (New Demand-Above 890); 13

1165,69," Their practices in this regard may, depending upon the circumstances, be regarded as unlawful leveraging, tying 
arrangements, or refusals to deal.  See Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States, supra; Gamco Inc. v. Providence Fruit & Produce, 
supra, 194 F.2d at 488; Lorain Journal Co. v. United States, 342 U.S. 143, 154-55, 72 S. Ct. 181, 186-87, 96 L. Ed. 162 (1951); 
Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5-6, 78 S. Ct. 514, 518, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1958); United States v. United 
Shoe Machinery Co., supra."
1165,70," Defendants argue that many of the allegations relating to these early intercity services claims are barred by the 1956 consent 
decree in United States v. Western Electric Co., 1956 Trade Cas. P 68,246 (D.N.J.1956) because the conduct at issue preceded 
the date of entry of the consent judgment.  A consent judgment, like any other judgment, is res judicata ( Aluminum Company of 
America v. United States, 302 U.S. 230, 58 S. Ct. 178, 82 L. Ed. 219 (1937)), that is, it binds the parties to the suit ""not only as to 
every matter which was offered and received to sustain or defeat the claim or demand, but as to any other matter which might 
have been offered for that purpose."" Cromwell v. County of Sac, 94 U.S. 351, 352, 24 L. Ed. 195 (1876); Commissioner v. 
Sunnen, 333 U.S. 591, 597, 68 S. Ct. 715, 719, 92 L. Ed. 898 (1948). The issue here is whether the instant action is sufficiently 
similar to the earlier case so as to trigger the application of the res judicata doctrine. The 1949 complaint leading to the 1956 consent judgment did not charge that AT&T's dominance of telephone service violated 
the antitrust laws, but it only charged violations in the manufacture and sale of telephone equipment, and it sought the divestiture 
of Western Electric.  The claims relating to intercity services in the instant suit have no counterpart in the earlier proceeding, and 
the relief sought with respect to these claims (i. e., the divestiture of the Operating Companies) differs substantially from the 
relief sought by the government in 1949.  Accordingly, the Court concludes that the services claims are sufficiently dissimilar 
from the claims advanced in the 1949 suit as to render the doctrine of res judicata inapplicable to the pre-1956 conduct alleged 
herein."
1165,71," Prior to that time, when telecommunications depended wholly on cable, competition was, as a practical matter, not feasible. "
1166,72," The evidence introduced in support of these charges consists primarily of the stipulation paragraphs from episodes 10, 11 
and 13 and materials from FCC proceedings in Dockets 8963, 9539, 11164, 11883, and 12940 (see Plaintiff's Exhibits 28, 29, 
and 47).  By and large, the inferences of anticompetitive intent and conduct which the government asks the Court to draw from 
these materials involve the reasons behind various positions taken by defendants before the FCC in these dockets.  As such, 
they may not serve as a basis of antitrust liability (see Part VII, infra ).  However, to the extent that the events portrayed in these 
episodes provide a historical context for AT&T's conduct in subsequent years, the Court will consider them for this limited 
purpose.  It should also be noted that the government's evidence in regard to these episodes was not particularly strong."
1166,73," CCSA service is used by large customers with extensive communications needs in multiple locations.  It is essentially a 
smaller version of the public switched network, but it is dedicated to the use of a particular customer. Episode 1, stipulation 
paragraph 73; episode 17, stipulation paragraph A-10."
1166,74, See episode 17; testimony of Bernard Overeynder.
1166,75," This resulted in MCI's inability to serve Scientific Timesharing (STS), which wanted service from St. Louis to Bethesda, 
Maryland.  At the time in question, MCI was equipped to provide service only from St. Louis to Chicago.  In order that STS might 
be served on the remainder of the route from Chicago to Bethesda, a request was made to AT&T to allow interconnection with 
its circuits in Chicago.  However, since STS had no premises in that city, AT&T refused to allow MCI circuits to interconnect with 
AT&T circuits at that point.  As a consequence, if STS wanted service between St. Louis and Bethesda, it had to purchase 
service from AT&T not only between Chicago and Bethesda but also between St. Louis and Chicago (thus eliminating MCI 
altogether).  See episode 24A; testimony of Laurence Harris."
1166,76," The actions of AT&T with regard to the customer premises provision do not concern interconnection with Bell provided local 
distribution facilities but with AT&T intercity facilities.  The government argues these actions to be illegal not under the essential 
facilities doctrine (see pp. 21-22, supra ), but as the equivalent of unlawful tying arrangements-that is, that AT&T ""tied"" provision 
of the services for which it held a monopoly (i. e., service on routes for which competition had not developed) to purchase of 
AT&T service along routes which competitors did indeed serve.  See Northern Pacific Ry. v. United States, supra, 356 U.S. at 5-
6, 72 S. Ct. at 186-87; Berkey Photo Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 603 F.2d 263, 275-76 (2d Cir. 1979)."
1166,77," FX service ""permits a customer to make or receive local calls through a distant switching center by effectively providing a long 
extension cord in the form of a dedicated line between the customer's location and a telephone company switching system in the 
distant location (the ""foreign exchange')."" Episode 1, stipulation paragraph 72. "
1167,78," AT&T was ordered to provide these connections to the specialized common carriers on April 23, 1974 ( Bell System Tariff 
Offerings, 46 F.C.C.2d 413). In May of that year, a Bell tariff was filed excluding the domestic satellite carriers from these 
connections on the ground that there were technical obstacles.  The FCC ordered AT&T to interconnect with the FX and CCSA 
service offered by the domestic satellite carriers on September 12, 1974 (48 F.C.C.2d 676)."
1167,79," With regard to the specialized common carriers, see testimony of William McGowan; Laurence Harris; with regard to the 
domestic satellite carriers, see testimony of Nathaniel Fthenakis, Allen Schwamberger, and Walter Pioli.  AT& T's own Long 
Lines Intercity Services Handbook lists FX and CCSA under private line services.  See Plaintiff's Exhibit 1745. The government argues that, whether or not the Specialized Common Carriers decision authorized the provision of FX and 
CCSA service under the Communications Act, AT&T was still obligated to provide interconnection for such services under the 
essential facilities doctrine of the antitrust laws. See pp. 1352-1353, supra.  Much of the evidence presented by the government, 
however, dwelled on the question of whether the FCC decision did authorize such services, whether AT&T believed this to be 
the case, and whether AT&T therefore should have understood itself to be obligated to provide interconnection for these 
services. Defendants have strenuously argued-and attempted to establish through cross examination-that it was unreasonable for anyone 
to believe that these services were authorized prior to 1974.  However, on that issue, too, the government has to this point 
clearly carried its burden of proof."
1167,80," See testimony of Eugene Cacciamani.  Bell claimed that FX and CCSA interconnection with the satellite carriers was 
technically infeasible due to a ""double hop"" problem that would reduce the quality of the transmission by causing delays and 
echoes.  According to the evidence presented thus far, the possibility of a double hop problem actually occurring is remote."
1167,81," The government's evidence tended to show that, for example, AT&T charged higher prices for local distribution facilities to 
MCI than to Western Union.  See, e.g., Plaintiff's Exhibits 1455, 1526; testimony of Laurence Harris, William McGowan."
1167,82," This prevented the non-Bell carriers, such as MCI, American Satellite Corp., and RCA Globcom, from serving any customer 
who happened to be located outside these narrowly-drawn areas.  See testimony of William McGowan, Laurence Harris, John 
Jackson, Allen Schwamberger."
1167,83," The draft contract offered to the domestic satellite carriers for the provision of local distribution facilities (Plaintiff's Exhibit 425) 
made available to these carriers voice grade facilities only; carriers such as American Satellite Corp. and RCA Globcom had 
intended to offer not only voice service, but also video and data transmission by satellite, and the contract restriction prevented 
them from doing so.  In addition, AT&T undertook in this contract to provide local facilities ""to the extent in its judgment such 
facilities are available over and above its operating needs"" (emphasis added).  Plaintiff's Exhibit 425, p. 4.  Witnesses testified as 
to their apprehension that this provision left AT&T with excessive discretion to deny them the use of local facilities at any time.  
See testimony of John Jackson, Walter Pioli, Allen Schwamberger."
1167,84," For example, after two years of negotiation between AT&T and General Electric with regard to GE's proposal to replace part 
of its AT&T-leased CCSA system with one of its own, the negotiators finally reached a compromise on the technical and 
operational problems AT&T found with the proposal; much to GE's surprise, however, AT&T management repudiated the "
1168,," compromise and returned to the position initially held by AT&T before negotiations had begun.  See generally episode 17; 
testimony of Bernard Overeynder. Similarly, the history of contract negotiations between AT&T and MCI in connection with the provision of local distribution 
facilities during 1972 and 1973 demonstrate a pattern of delays and shifts in position by AT&T, culminating in AT&T's 
discontinuation of negotiation late in 1973 and its decision instead to file tariffs at the state level for the provision of local 
facilities.  This decision appears to have been taken with the expectation that it would force MCI to litigate the lawfulness of the 
tariffs before some twenty state regulatory agencies.  See generally episode 22; testimony of Laurence Harris. Evidence was also presented demonstrating AT&T's lack of cooperation and vacillation during negotiations for the provision of 
local distribution facilities with the domestic satellite carriers (see generally episode 32; testimony of John Jackson, Allen 
Schwamberger), and during the ENFIA II negotiations in 1979-80 on the type of interconnections available for long-distance 
metered service (see testimony of Bert Roberts, Edgar Kushan)."
1168,85," See episodes 35/36, 37, 39; testimony of Edvin Farinholt and Ralph Johnson."
1168,86," Testimony of Bert Roberts.  Much of the government's evidence with regard to AT&T's initial opposition to MCI's Execunet 
tariff involves the position taken by AT&T before the FCC and, later, before the U.S. Court of Appeals for this Circuit.  See, e.g., 
Plaintiff's Exhibits 2244.  These activities cannot serve as a basis for antitrust liability and will not be so considered by the Court.  
See Part VII, infra.  The Court makes reference to AT&T's opposition here only by way of background.  See note 72, supra."
1168,87," MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. FCC, 188 U.S. App. D.C. 327, 580 F.2d 590, 597 (D.C.Cir.1978) (Execunet II ); see also 
MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. FCC, 182 U.S. App. D.C. 367, 561 F.2d 365 (D.C.Cir.1977) (Execunet I )."
1168,88," Testimony of Bert Roberts; see testimony of Edgar Kushan, (with regard to ENFIA rates imposed upon Southern Pacific's 
Sprint Service)."
1168,89, Testimony of Bert Roberts.
1168,90," Among other things, the non-Bell carriers are precluded from serving customers with rotary dial telephones; a customer must 
dial twenty-three digits in order to complete a call (whereas Long Lines customers need dial only ten or eleven digits); 
transmission quality is inferior to that offered by Long Lines; and answer supervision is unavailable.  See testimony of Bert 
Roberts, Edgar Kushan, Gus Grant. "
1169,91," See testimony of William McGowan, Gus Grant, George Vasilakos.  There was testimony to the effect that as long as Long 
Lines and the Operating Companies remained part of the same integrated structure, meaningful competition in the intercity 
service area between Long Lines and the non-Bell carriers was unlikely due to the strong loyalties to the Bell System within the 
Operating Companies.  See, e.g., testimony of Gus Grant.  Defendants argue that there is no policy encouraging non-
cooperation on the part of the Operating Companies, and that the government has singled out unrepresentative instances where 
problems arose, and they will, of course, be permitted to prove in their own case that Bell policies counsel cooperation and that 
the instances cited by the government are atypical."
1169,92, Beyond those that may be inferred from the answers of witnesses to cross-examination.
1169,93," This might include, among other things, proof to support defendants' claims that the Specialized Common Carriers decision of 
the FCC was so unclear that they did not know that they were required to provide FX and CCSA interconnections to the carriers; 
that their guidelines for local distribution areas were not unreasonable; and that certain of their competitors (such as GE and 
MCI) had primary objectives other than the securing of the interconnections and services requested from Bell."
1169,94," Section 201(a) of the Communications Act HN12[
] provides that It shall be the duty of every common carrier engaged in interstate or foreign communication by wire or radio to furnish such 
communication service upon reasonable request therefor; and, in accordance with the orders of the Commission, in cases where 
the Commission, after opportunity for hearing, finds such action necessary or desirable in the public interest, to establish 
physical connections with other carriers, to establish through routes and charges applicable thereto and the divisions of such 
charges, and to establish and provide facilities and regulations for operating such through routes. 47 U.S.C. § 201(a)."
1169,95, Defendants note that they have provided interconnection whenever ordered to do so by the Commission or the courts. 
1170,96," One method used by AT&T to guard against creamskimming was the ""customer premises"" restriction (see p. 23, supra ) by 
which AT&T attempted to prevent competitors from ""piecing out"" those sections of a particular telephone route for which service 
was technically easy and inexpensive to provide, while leaving Bell with the burden of providing service on the technically 
complicated and expensive portions of that route."
1170,97," According to defendants, if they did not average rates, but instead priced both high and low density routes according to costs, 
their local services prices would increase substantially, thus harming the majority of telecommunications consumers and the 
public interest. Such deaveraging, according to defendants, would also permit them to drive other intercity carriers from the 
market due to defendants' alleged economies of scale."
1170,98," In support, defendants cite the Above 890 decision of the FCC where the Commission rejected AT&T's creamskimming 
argument on the ground that the restrictions on interconnection in the Bell tariffs would prevent any expansion of private 
microwave systems that might result in creamskimming.  See episode 11, stipulation paragraph 43.  More recently, however, the 
FCC has explicitly rejected AT&T's creamskimming argument.  See the FCC's decision in the MCI case (episode 21, stipulation 
paragraph 42); and the Specialized Common Carriers proceeding (episode 22, stipulation paragraph 17)."
1170,99," HN13[
] ""Under the Sherman Act rule of reason … there is simply no such thing as ""reasonably' anticompetitive conduct …  
AT&T's argument is tantamount to an invitation to the Court to create a new rule of reason based not on the competitive effects 
of the conduct but rather on whether AT&T's conduct was reasonably believed to further its own ""reasonable' corporate goals."" 
(Plaintiff's Memorandum, p. 63)."
1170,100," In that view, since the FCC has traditionally left the establishment of terms, conditions, and prices for interconnection to 
voluntary negotiation among the carriers, and since the FCC regards the Communications Act in the circumstances of this case 
as ""neutral"" ( FCC Memorandum as Amicus Curiae, 62 F.C.C.2d 1102, 1112-13 (1977)), the antitrust laws apply unimpaired.  It 
presumably follows that, unless defendants are able to demonstrate that they were precluded by the FCC (acting under 
Communications Act standards) from interconnecting, they had an obligation to interconnect if failure to do so was 
anticompetitive under the Sherman Act."
1170,101," The government's theory also brings to the surface some practical problems.  For example, the ""continuing obligation"" 
approach advocated by the government makes it difficult to pinpoint exactly when AT&T's failure to interconnect first gave rise to 
antitrust liability.  Was it when the first requests for interconnection were made by the non-Bell carriers? When the FCC first "
1171,," authorized the carriers to offer a particular service?  When the FCC first ordered interconnection to take place?  When the Court 
of Appeals issued the Execunet II decision?  It is not possible to ascertain from the government's submissions which of these 
alternatives it espouses."
1171,102," The case law does not squarely support the theory advanced by either side.  The only decisions cited dealing with the 
implications of a refusal to interconnect are Mid-Texas Communications, supra and Execunet I and Execunet II, supra. In Mid-
Texas, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit stated that a refusal to interconnect may be protected from antitrust scrutiny if 
Bell believed that the interconnection would be adverse to the public interest, and if its assessment of the public interest was 
correct.  See 615 F.2d at 1388. This decision appears to place initial responsibility for determining the public interest 
consequences of an interconnection request on AT&T pending final ruling by the FCC.  Yet the two Execunet decisions of the 
Court of Appeals for this Circuit, taken together, appear to provide that non-Bell carriers have the right to implement new 
services (and that AT&T has the obligation to provide the interconnections necessary for such implementation) unless and until 
the FCC determines the services to be unauthorized as not in the public interest. See Execunet II, supra, 580 F.2d at 593-98; 
Execunet I, supra, 561 F.2d at 380. Under these decisions, AT&T must interconnect until the FCC determines what is in the 
public interest, rather than relying on an initial public interest determination of its own. It should be noted, however, that the Execunet decisions do not address the Bell System's responsibilities under the antitrust 
laws; while the Mid-Texas case does state that a decision not to interconnect is subject to antitrust scrutiny if the purpose is 
anticompetitive in that ""an antitrust court has an important role in preventing misuse of the public interest standard."" 615 F.2d at 
1380. "

with regard to the interconnections they receive.  Tr. 13063-64."

35/36 (Datran).  As for those episodes noted in a footnote in defendants' motion to dismiss (episodes 20, 32, 33, 40), neither 
party has made specific arguments as to the application of the doctrine to any contentions.  Indeed, it appears that there are few, 
if any, subjects in those episodes that could conceivably raise Noerr-Pennington considerations.  Unless defendants identify with 
particularity those contentions as to which they claim that a Noerr-Pennington defense exists within the guidelines supplied by 
this opinion, the Court will not further consider this issue with respect to these transactions.  See also, note 117, infra. "
1173,106," See also United Mine Workers v. Pennington, supra, 381 U.S. at 669-70, 85 S. Ct. at 1592-93. "

1174,108," However, a distinction may be made on the basis of the type of governmental body involved (legislative or administrative) 
and the function it exercises (rule-making or adjudicative) when the issue is whether a deliberate misrepresentation is protected, 
and those factors may also ""shed light on whether the (parties being charged) were engaged in ""political activity ….' "" ( -- - F.2d 
at p.  -- )."
1174,109," Additionally, anticompetitive intent must be shown."
1174,110," Defendants may have tangentially raised the Noerr-Pennington defense also with respect to matters which are conceptually 
wholly outside the scope of the doctrine.  The Court's ruling herein therefore does not apply to AT&T's failure to propose a 
certification program for customer-provided equipment, for such conduct cannot conceivably be construed as petitioning for 
governmental action.  (Of course, evidence of AT&T's position before the FCC in its certification docket no. 19528 does fall 
within the doctrine.  See note 54, supra.) Likewise, the government is not precluded from using AT&T's participation in various 
regulatory proceedings to show that defendants were aware of the facts they stated in such proceedings, any inconsistency with 
positions taken elsewhere, the possible lack of a basis for positions taken elsewhere (e.g., in negotiations with competitors), or 
the conduct of defendants following or in response to agency or court decisions."
1174,111, Episode 21.
1174,112," The FCC noted that AT&T's statements in support of the need for this tariff were ""inconsistent with"" and ""would substantially 
undermine"" AT& T's arguments in the MCI proceeding.  Microwave Communications, Inc. (Docket No. 16509), 18 F.C.C.2d 953, 
962 (1969). "
1175,113, Episode 10.
1175,114," In a similar vein, the government points to evidence that AT&T raised technical problems in defense of its video 
interconnection tariff no. 216 (episode 10) but that the FCC ultimately found that such problems were not insurmountable; and to 
evidence with respect to another transaction indicating that AT&T's technical objections to interconnection with private 
microwave applications were not well taken (episode 11).  The government seems also to complain of defendants' efforts to 
seek to delay implementation of the Execunet I decision, supra, through petitions for rehearing in the Court of Appeals and 
certiorari in the Supreme Court."
1175,115," Defendants will, of course, have an opportunity to refute that evidence."
1175,116," AT&T documents note in this regard a course ""which has proved popular with some commissioners, of raising a number of 
public interest questions which should be answered before the FCC determines its policy"" and that AT&T officials were puzzled 
as to what grounds they might be able to find on which to oppose Datran's application.  In an effort to avert speedy approval of 
the Datran petition AT&T argued both that there was no market for Datran's services and that AT&T was prepared to meet that 
market; yet, in fact, AT&T had no facilities with which to meet the market demands at that time.  The FCC ultimately determined 
that there was a need for the service Datran proposed to provide, but Datran, financially weakened by the delay as well as by 
other factors, was forced to declare bankruptcy.  See p. 1356, supra."
1175,117," Defendants may submit to the Court within fifteen days hereof a list of those government contentions which they consider to 
be encompassed within the ruling in this part of the opinion, and the government will have fifteen days to respond.  Upon the "
1176,," Court's ruling thereon, the relevant contentions will be stricken and defendants will not be required to introduce evidence to 
controvert them."
1176,118," The evidence adduced on intercity pricing concerns various AT&T private line tariffs, as follows: One of the earliest tariffs in issue is a 1948 tariff for video transmissions.  The rates charged to the television networks were set 
without a detailed analysis of cost, and they remained unchanged until 1969 when there were readjustments both in the monthly 
rates and the occasional rates.  In 1972, after AT&T had lost substantial revenues to its competitors because of the higher 
monthly rates, it filed another tariff that reduced monthly rates below the original 1948 rates. The Multiple Channel Tariff, which became effective in 1956, offered discounted rates to telecommunications users for multiple 
channels between given points.  After investigation by the FCC, the tariff was declared unlawful, and it was cancelled in 1963. The Telpak tariff was implemented in 1961, at the same time that private microwave systems began developing after the FCC's 
Above 890 decision.  Telpak, too, provided discounted rates for customers using multiple channels.  According to the 
government, the Telpak rates were based not on cost but on what AT&T believed to be the cost of building and operating a 
private microwave system.  Although theoretically the tariff was designed to provide customers with multiple circuits between two 
given points, in reality such customers did not have to route even one private line circuit between those two endpoints.  Telpak 
was thus entirely a ""paper"" network which allowed the Telpak customers to lower the costs of their private line needs.  Moreover, 
because the incremental cost of additional circuits was minimal, customers had substantial incentives to satisfy all of their private 
line requirements through AT&T.  The tariff expired by its own terms in May, 1981, after the Court of Appeals for this Circuit 
refused to review the objections raised by Telpak users who opposed the tariff's termination. In 1969, while Telpak was the subject of an FCC inquiry, AT&T filed the Series 11,000 experimental tariff which permitted 
customers to lease specific networks within a seven-state area.  The tariff was eliminated in 1972 after AT&T permitted the 
three-year experimental period to expire. Another tariff in issue is AT&T's digital data service (DDS).  In 1969, Datran applied to the FCC to develop a digital 
communications network through the use of a microwave system.  In response to this competitive threat, AT&T began 
developing its own digital data transmission service (see p. 27, supra ).  The DDS tariff rates were 40 percent below those 
proposed by Datran. In 1974, the FCC approved AT&T's Hi/Lo tariff which replaced the nationwide averaged private line rates with a two-level rate 
structure.  Under Hi/Lo, rates were lowered in areas with high density use and raised in areas with low density use.  According to 
the government, Hi/Lo was a preemptive rate cut, to be put in place before the specialized carriers became entrenched, and it 
was not based on reliable cost studies.  In 1976, the FCC declared the Hi/Lo tariff unlawful.  As a result, AT&T filed the Multi-
Schedule Private Line Tariff (MPL), but the FCC ultimately found that tariff, too, to be unlawful."
1176,119," This opportunity to subsidize competitive services with revenues from monopoly profits in the markets in which competition 
was foreclosed was and is particularly tempting, it is said, because defendants are regulated primarily with respect to their 
overall rate of return (as distinguished from regulation of the individual return for each of the services they provide). "
1177,120," The government does not allege that defendants' pricing practices constitute unlawful conduct, but only that they reveal 
anticompetitive intent.  See Pretrial Brief, at pp. 60, 64, 66-67."
1177,121," No such study was filed, for example, in conjunction with the Multiple Channel Tariff. In the case of the video transmission 
tariff, AT&T did not prepare a detailed cost study until after the video rates had been chosen."
1177,122," The defects cited by the government as evidence of understatements of costs included the following items: overstatement of 
potential revenue losses to competitors; failure to consider Bell operating company plant; ignoring of higher cost plant; use of 
hypothetical mix of plant; use of capacity cost concept; unrelated depreciation estimates; allocation of joint costs among service 
classifications; residual averaging cost allocation; shifting direct costs to common cost categories; use of obsolete historical data; 
use of unrealistic forecasts; and relationship between design of rates and costs.  See testimony of William Melody. One example of the overstatement of costs is found in the DDS tariff. Datran attempted to lease high capacity data channel from 
AT&T after the latter had undercut Datran's proposed rates for low speed digital data service.  The rates filed by AT&T for these 
high capacity channels (which Datran could lease only from AT&T) reflected not only the actual costs of these channels but also 
an additional amount that served as a contribution (presumably to common costs).  Moreover, the contribution amount tended to 
be higher for the facilities that Datran intended to lease.  The result was that the rates were so high that it was economically 
impractical for any specialized common carrier, including Datran, to use the channels to create its own data transmission 
systems."
1177,123," The cost methodology used by AT&T for the Hi/Lo tariff depended upon an accurate assessment of the response of the 
marketplace.  Although AT&T admitted that a study of market behavior involving customer and account manager surveys was 
necessary to produce reliable cost data, the market information submitted by AT&T included neither customer surveys nor 
account manager involvement."
1177,124," When pricing Series 11,000, AT&T set rates at twenty percent above its estimated costs, but the revenue gained from that 
tariff did not offset the revenues lost from other Bell services when customers shifted to Series 11,000. "
1178,125," For example, the FCC found that the rate reductions for the Multiple Channel Tariff were not adequately cost-justified, and 
the cost data for the DDS and Hi/Lo tariffs were likewise questioned by the FCC.  After the Hi/Lo tariff was found unlawful, AT&T 
filed the MPL tariff, again there was criticism of the cost analysis, and again the FCC found the tariff to be unlawful."
1178,126," There is evidence, for example, that when AT&T filed the 1972 video transmission tariff which lowered monthly rates below 
those charged in the original 1948 tariff, its own estimates predicted that there would be even greater losses during the first two 
years the new rates would be in use and that the anticipated profits in the third year would recover only twenty-five percent of 
these earlier losses.  Other AT&T cost data and internal cost studies indicated that certain rates in the Telpak tariff would not 
recover costs.  With regard to the Hi/Lo tariff, AT&T's own consultants and officials questioned the validity of the cost and rate 
assessments for the various routes."
1178,127," The government has deliberately chosen not to rely upon predatory pricing in the traditional sense (such as pricing below 
cost, however defined) and any evidence which would support such an approach will be stricken.  However, evidence that 
defendants believed that they were pricing below cost is admissible on the issue of their anticompetitive intent."
1178,128," See, e.g., the rate chosen for the 1969 increase in the Telpak tariff. This contention is equivalent to a claim that an 
unregulated firm failed to choose the price that maximized profits."
1178,129," According to the government, Bell allocated an unrealistically low proportion of revenues from its competitive services to the 
common costs and that, were the proper figure used, the competitive services might well sustain a loss at the selected price."
1178,130," Since the government is charging pricing without regard to cost rather than predatory pricing below cost, defendants do not 
have the onerous burden of demonstrating that their individual prices exceeded their individual costs; they must merely 
demonstrate that an anticompetitive purpose cannot be inferred from their pricing policies.  They may do this, e.g., by showing 
that these policies appropriately and reasonably took costs into account. "
1179,131," In a case finally brought to trial seven years after the filing of the complaint, it would be unwise not to spend the time in trial 
necessary for the defendants ""to offer substantial additional testimony and documentary evidence demonstrating in detail, for 
each of the intercity studies attacked, the reasonableness of their studies and of the rates which were based upon these 
studies."" See Defendants Memorandum at p. 472."
1179,132," See, e.g., Northeastern Tel. Co. v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., supra; California Computer Products, Inc. v. IBM Corp., supra, 613 
F.2d at 742-43; Hanson v. Shell Oil Co., 541 F.2d 1352, 1358-59 (9th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1074, 97 S. Ct. 813, 50

Corp., 615 F.2d 427, 432 (7th Cir. 1980)."
1179,133," The only case cited by defendants that could be read as holding that pricing below marginal cost is the sole means for 
establishing a prima facie case of predatory pricing, Hanson v. Shell Oil Co., supra, has been interpreted otherwise by the Court 
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  See Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Society, 643 F.2d 553, 559 n. 6 (9th Cir. 1980). As 
that court succinctly observed, in a passage in California Computer Products v. IBM, supra, 613 F.2d at 743, immediately 
following that cited by defendants: And we do not foreclose the possibility that a monopolist who reduces price to some point above marginal or average variable 
costs might still be held to have engaged in a predatory act because of other aspects of its conduct. "
1180,134," Defendants have cited Northeastern Tel. Co. v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., supra, in which the Court of Appeals for the Second 
Circuit adopted a marginal cost test to evaluate claims of cross-subsidization in the telecommunications field similar to some of 
those advanced here.  But that decision is not controlling, if only because the court there did not hold that no evidence short of 
that showing that price was below marginal cost was capable of establishing a pricing violation.  The plaintiff in Northeastern, 
unlike the government in this case, was attempting to convince the court to apply a fully distributed cost test to the pricing 
dispute, and the Court of Appeals in essence simply selected the marginal cost standard over the fully distributed cost rule.  
Here, on the other hand, the Court is confronted with the pricing-without-regard-to-cost theory and evidence adduced based on 
that theory, and it must make its decision on that basis.  See also Chillicothe Sand & Gravel Co. v. Martin Marietta Corp., supra, 
615 F.2d at 432. In any event, see Faulhaber, Cross-Subsidization: Pricing in Public Enterprises, 65 Am.Econ.Rev. 966, 969-70 
(1975); In re IBM Peripheral EDP Devices, 481 F. Supp. 965, 994-95 (N.D.Cal.1979)."
1180,135," See Joskow & Klevorick, supra at 261.  That burden might appropriately be placed upon defendants in this context because 
(1) the Bell System probably sustains a higher proportion of common costs than any other business entity and the proper 
allocation of such costs may be more intractable than any other firm's, (2) the Bell System's costs appear to have proved 
impervious to ascertainment and hence to analysis by outsiders including the FCC, and (3) Bell possesses the rare opportunity 
to exploit these factors because of the regulatory scheme and the coexistence of competitive and entry-restricted services.  
HN23[
] Where those unusual-possibly unique-circumstances prevail, it may not be unreasonable to require the party being 
accused of anticompetitive pricing to produce evidence which demonstrates that its pricing practices were not designed either to 
drive out its competitors (in areas where there was competition) or to prevent or discourage entry (in areas where such entry 
was legally feasible)."
1180,136," The government, of course, would still have the burden of establishing such conduct-and hence a Sherman Act violation-with 
other, independent evidence. "
1181,137," A principal purpose of the antitrust laws is to promote price competition.  Any rule which restricts anyone (including a 
monopolist) from engaging in vigorous competition would deter the very action that is intended to be encouraged (see Berkey 
Photo v. Eastman Kodak Co., supra, 603 F.2d at 273; Schine Chain Theaters v. United States, supra, 334 U.S. at 120, 68 S. Ct. 
at 953). For that reason, the HN24[
] courts must exercise great care in differentiating between legitimate price competition 
and predatory pricing. See Janich Brothers, Inc. v. American Distilling Co., supra, 570 F.2d at 856."

general trade, for they added another, confusing layer to the authorization process.  See episodes 63, 65, and 78.  There is 
evidence that the establishment of the BSPPD was merely a cosmetic change in implementation of the long-term goal of 
maximizing the amount of products manufactured within the Bell structure.  See Plaintiff's Exhibits 1351, 3128, and 3130;

model was marketable.  See episode 78 (concerning the experiences of ITT and the New York Telephone Co. with regard to the 
installation of digital channel banks in the World Trade Center)."
1182,148," See episodes 64, 72, and 75.  Bell also preannounced the Western versions of general trade product long before they were

1182,153," Largely because of this centralized counseling function, the Operating Companies have never had to develop their own

1183,154," Although the government's evidence with respect to certain of the procurement episodes was persuasive (see especially 
episodes 57, 61, 64, and 78), that introduced in connection with others, while sufficient for the purpose of surviving the present 
motion, was not particularly convincing (see, e.g., episodes 59, 67, 75, 76, and 79).  In addition, there was vigorous cross 
examination which tended to introduce a significant number of facts of affirmative value to defendants.  See, e.g., testimony of 
Thomas Leming on episodes 75 and 79."
1183,155," On procurement, as on interconnection of terminal equipment (see Part III-D) defendants also argue that the incidents 
proffered by the government are too few to sustain liability.  But here, as there, the government is not required to produce 
evidence covering the gamut of defendants' extensive activities (although it should be noted that the government's evidence 
appears to cover a relatively small spectrum of Bell's total procurement, both qualitatively and quantitatively)."
1183,156," The additional expense is said to exceed that for which the efficiencies of vertical integration (e.g., assured sources of 
supply) would compensate. "
1184,157," See testimony of Frederick Warren-Boulton; Plaintiff's Exhibits 4916, 4917; testimony of Bruce Owen.  It can be inferred from 
the testimony that purchasing decisions of this type have taken place.  The government's evidence contained examples of 
independent business or engineering judgments by the Operating Companies to buy from the general trade because of lower 
cost, better quality, or desirable features.  Presumably in these cases the Operating Companies considered that the advantages 
of the general trade products (or the inadequacies of the Western offerings) outweighed the efficiencies to be gained from 
vertical integration.  But they were, nonetheless, persuaded to change their minds and to purchase from Western instead-even if 
that meant waiting for an as yet non-existent Western product to come on the market.  See episodes 55C, 64 and 78."

1185,159," The court went on to state that it was unclear on the record whether or not Kodak had leveraged its monopoly power in the 
film market to gain an advantage in the competitive photofinishing market."
1185,160," Irrespective of whether the direct interconnection is with Bell facilities or with an independent operating company which 
eventually connects to the Bell network."

1185,162," See also, Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, supra; United States v. Grinnell Corp., supra. "
1186,163," 384 U.S. at 572, 86 S. Ct. at 1704. From these grounds, it may be inferred that the court relied heavily upon the degree of 
cross-elasticity of supply in the industry.  HN30[
] Supply cross-elasticity, no less than demand cross-elasticity, is an important 
factor in the definition of economic markets.  If, for example, a manufacturer of women's dresses were charged with 
monopolization, it would not be productive to define separate markets for size six, size eight, size ten, size twelve, and size 
fourteen dresses.  Instead, all of them could be aggregated in a single market (even though none of these is substitutable in use 
for another) because all are close producer substitutes, that is, they exhibit high supply cross-elasticity."
1186,164," Among other decisions which have permitted the clustering of submarkets for analysis of market power are United States v. 
Phillipsburg National Bank and Trust Co., 399 U.S. 350, 90 S. Ct. 2035, 26 L. Ed. 2d 658 (1970) (commercial banking includes 
the services denoted by that term); Hartford-Empire Co. v. United States, 323 U.S. 386, 398, 65 S. Ct. 373, 380, 89 L. Ed. 322 
(1945) (automobile glass manufacturing machines); United States v. Hughes Tool Co., 415 F. Supp. 637 (C.D.Cal.1976) 
(products used in handling of pipe and drilling and production of oil wells); United States v. International Harvester Co., 214 F. 
987 (D.Minn.1914), aff'd, 274 U.S. 693, 47 S. Ct. 748, 71 L. Ed. 1302 (1927) (agricultural implements)."
1186,165," The government reads United States v. General Electric, 82 F. Supp. 753, 817 (D.N.J.1949), to the contrary too broadly.  
HN31[
] If aggregation reveals ""an important relationship between the defendants' course of conduct and their overall 
monopoly power,"" it is indeed a useful and, hence, appropriate methodology.  If, however, aggregation obscures, rather than 
reveals, it cannot be justified."
1186,166," Furthermore, it is not clear that aggregation would have the necessary effect of prejudicing defendants at all.  When there is 
no substantial disparity in market shares, there is no direct effect.  When such a disparity exists, aggregation results in an 
averaging of market share figures which, because it necessarily reduces very high shares, would normally be considered 
favorable to defendants.  See 2 Areeda & Turner, supra, PP 532b, 532c, at p. 403. "
1187,167," As stated by one government witness, use of an aggregate equipment market is desirable where there is ""a series of 
markets for individual pieces of equipment where the firms involved are the same, where the behavior involved is the same, 
where the structural sources of that behavior and the relevant structural relief are the same across all those markets."" Testimony 
of Bruce Owen, Tr. 10922."
1187,168," Defendants have also objected that the government failed to prove market power in several subsubmarkets.  However, the 
government has indicated, at least since its November 11, 1980 report on market contentions, that it relied upon its description 
of the equipment submarkets only ""to establish the identity of the products included within"" the aggregate equipment market.  
Thus, its current claim (Memorandum at p. 15 n. *) that it identified the ten subsubmarkets only ""(to) facilitate definition of the 
boundaries of (the aggregate) market,"" has clear antecedents and renders defendants' point inapposite.  This does not mean, as 
the Court points out supra, that defendants are not free to attempt to prove in their case that the individual product markets are 
the appropriate markets for antitrust analysis."
1187,169," The evidence indicates that defendants' share in the aggregate equipment market in the years 1973-79 ranged from a low of 
61.3 percent in 1975 to a high of 66.2 percent in 1973 to 65.1 percent in 1979.  Defendants' market share in the terminal 
equipment (or customer premise systems) submarket ranged from a low of 44.0 percent in 1973 to a high of 58.2 percent in 
1977 to 54.8 percent in 1979.  Ten subsubmarkets were identified, as follows: central office switching systems, large PBX 
equipment, key systems, single line telephone sets, terrestrial microwave systems, carrier equipment, coaxial cable, data 
modems, ancillary central office switching equipment, and miscellaneous terminal equipment."
1187,170," The government has demonstrated the existence of barriers to entry such as control over essential facilities, entrenched 
brand preferences, differential risk, capital requirements, the regulatory process, and access to technical information.  See p. 12, 
supra."
1187,171," Defendants have pointed out a number of alleged deficiencies in the methodology used by the government's expert witness 
to quantify defendants' aggregate market share, and some of these criticisms appear to be well taken.  However, it is easier to 
identify flaws in someone else's analysis of market share than it is to perform analysis that will withstand scrutiny in fact.  Cf. 
Finkelstein, Regression Models in Administrative Proceedings, 86 Harv.L.Rev. 1442, 1446 (1973). The Court intends to avail 
itself also of the analysis of defendants' experts and, on that basis, assess the relative merit of the two market quantification 
methodologies. "
1188,172," Thus, in its formulation of a separate Bell market, the government may have confused the cross-elasticity of demand criterion 
of market definition (which is meant to describe a ""natural barrier"" between two groups of products independently of action by 
the alleged monopolist) (see International Tel. & Tel. Co. v. General Tel. & Elec. Corp., supra, 518 F.2d at 931, 933)) with 
insulation from competition resulting from conduct by that monopolist."
1188,173," If that theory were carried to it logical extreme, the government would not even have to allege a Bell market, but it could 
simply list all Western Electric products which, in its view, the Operating Companies purchased for biased reasons.  If the claims 
of bias with regard to these products could be proved, then each of them would have to be regarded as insulated from 
competition from general trade products (which, by definition, are not substitutable in use). "
1189,174," In International Tel. & Tel. Co. v. General Tel. & Elec. Corp., supra, 449 F. Supp. at 1177-1183, the court exhaustively 
canvassed the relevant indicators of substantial market foreclosure (albeit under a charge of violation of section 1 of the 
Sherman Act).  Based upon these criteria, and upon the market shares that other courts had held to have constituted substantial 
foreclosure, it concluded that a share of 7.4 percent of the market represented an unreasonable restraint of trade.  See also, 
United States v. Standard Oil Co., 253 F. Supp. 196 (D.N.J.1966); United States v. Brown Shoe Company, supra; United States 
v. Kennecott Copper Corp., 231 F. Supp. 95 (S.D.N.Y.1964), in all of which relatively small shares were held to violate the 
antitrust laws. In the instant case, defendants' share of the relevant market, Bell or aggregate, far exceeds shares that have 
been held to violate the antitrust laws. However, the relevant measure of defendants' leveraging is its share of the aggregate 
equipment market, not its share of sales to its own subsidiaries.  For example, one may imagine a situation in which a company 
such as defendants' refused to ship its manufactured products in other than internally made boxes, even though outside box 
manufacturers were more efficient.  Such a company would have a one hundred percent share of its own market for boxes, but it 
would enjoy virtually a zero percent share of the overall box market.  Surely, the zero percent figure is more probative of the 
extent to which the firm foreclosed competition than the one hundred percent statistic. "
1190,175," For the spreading of expenses over products arbitrarily, the witness identified the treatment of warranty and merchandising 
expenses for the 400D line card.  For the composition of product lines, he offered the Dimension PBX in relation to the entire 
customer premises product line.  On the issue of pricing from cost estimates, instead of waiting for standard costs, the witness 
suggested the 5A community dialing office.  In the category of abandonment of conventional mark-up factors, he mentioned both 
the 770A PBX and the 5A community dialing office.  Finally, as affected by the license contract arrangement, Dr. Kahn identified 
PBX's, although virtually no evidence was presented supporting the government's claim that the license contract improperly 
allocated costs for any products. "
1200,1," The first session of the evidentiary hearings covered the period from June 29, 1979, to July 18, 1979.  At the conclusion 
thereof, and following submission of the defendants' motions, on March 14, 1980, the court determined that fairness requires 
that no disposition be made of the defendants' motions for the drastic sanctions sought until a full evidentiary hearing on the 
merits of the motions, with opportunity to respond, had been accorded plaintiff.  Accordingly, the court ordered a second session 
of evidentiary hearings that covered the periods of May 28, 1980, to June 20, 1980, and September 2, 1980, to September 4, 
1980. "
1201,2," The court frequently noted in these proceedings that its power to resolve factual disputes that would otherwise be reserved for 
the jury is limited.  When the plaintiff first challenged the court's authority, the following comments were made: ""If there is no question that a fraud has been perpetrated on the court, the court is under no obligation to go through a jury trial."" ""If… the question of rebating and falsity of your assertions turns out to be a proper issue of fact for the jury, then I am not likely to 
grant a dismissal. ""If, on the other hand, it becomes so eminently clear that perjury was, in fact, committed, if it becomes eminently clear that there 
was a genuine obstruction of discovery for he purposes of defeating discovery, then I have a clear case to consider sanctions, 
and I think you're just ahead of time, you're way ahead of me, that is all."" Hearing of January 2, 1979, at pages 32 and 33. At the outset of the hearing of July 2, 1979, the court similarly noted: ""The purpose of this hearing, in a few words, is to determine whether or not there was a fraud upon the court.  If the fraud upon 
the court is based upon whether or not, by way of illustration, perjury was committed, if the court is satisfied that perjury was 
committed, the court can make that finding.  If it's arguable as to whether perjury has or has not been committed, that becomes a 
matter ultimately for the jury in the trial.  The motion to dismiss would be denied.  It's a question of my being satisfied. ""* * * The big question for the court is to hear the evidence and determine whether it can draw the inference that in truth and fact 
some fraud was committed.  If I cannot, if the facts are arguable, if there's a genuine dispute that the court -- from which the 
court cannot properly draw that inference or it's arguable, then it will go to the jury.  There's no question about that."" ""If two reasonable inferences can be drawn from it, I'll give it to the jury, if they're reasonable."" ""If there's only one inference that can be drawn, then I'll draw the one inference, whatever it happens to be"" Hearing of July 2, 1979, at pages 69-71. "
1203,3," The testimony of John I. Alioto is not determinative of defendants' motion for sanctions against PFEL.  John I. Alioto did not 
deny that rebates were paid before October 15, 1976; he merely denied that he himself authorized any such rebating. Alioto's 
admission that he was told by Modica before December 9, 1976, that Modica had authorized Nippon Maritime's payment of 
rebates makes clear that PFEL's rebating began before December 9, 1976, and supports the testimony of Tarantino, Elliott, and 
others that it began before October 15, 1976."
1203,4, Cople's testimony is supported by the following facts: 
1204,," ""(1) Alito told Cople on March 8, 1976, that his chief financial officer was in Japan and that he would check out Cople's 
accusation and get back to him.  Hitt did travel to Japan on March 17, 1976, to visit Nippon Maritime. ""(2) On April 15, 1976, Modica talked to Cople's secretary and asked Cople to call back ""Re 'Confidential' matter you sent them."" 
Cople's secretary made a memorandum of the call. ""(3) Porter A. Smith testified that Alioto told him that he had received a letter from Cople stating that PFEL was making some 
special arrangements on cotton, and that he had turned the file over to Modica. ""(4) In Alioto's deposition on November 29, 1976, he testified that Cople had sent him a letter saying that PFEL was rebating."" "
1205,5," Elliott and Modica left PFEL on October 31, 1977.  However, both Elliott and Modica took part in preparing PFEL's discovery 
responses.  Moreover, PFEL had an obligation to obtain relevant information from its former officers as well as from its present 
officers.  See, e.g., General Dynamics Corp. v. Selb Mfg. Co ., 481 F. 2d 1204, 1210 (8th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1162 
(1974). "
1207,6," It is true that after Ms. Genovese received a copy of the transcript of the court's clarification order of July 10, 1978, she strongly 
urged each of the agents visited to comply with the order of the court. "
1208,7," For further illustration, see Link v. Wabash Railroad Co ., 370 U.S. 626 (1962); Dellums v. Powell , 566 F. 2d 23 (D.C. Cir. 
1977); Denton v. Mr. Swiss of Missouri, Inc ., 564 F. 2d 236 (8th Cir. 1977); Emerick v. Fenick Ind. Inc ., 539 F. 2d 1379 (5th Cir. 
1976); von Brimer v. Whirlpool Corp ., 536 F. 2d 838 (9th Cir. 1976); Van Bronkhorst v. Safeco Corp ., 529 F. 2d 943 (9th Cir.

(2d Cir. 1964), cert. dismissed, 380 U.S. 248 (1965); Independent Investors Protective League v. Teleprompter Corp ., 88 F.R.D. 
512 (S.D.N.Y. 1979); United States v. Moss-American, Inc ., 78 F.R.D. 214 (E.D. Wis. 1978)."
1208,8," PFEL argues that Evanson v. Union Oil Co ., 85 F.R.D. 274 (D. Minn. 1979), appeal dismissed and petition for mandamus and 
prohibition denied, 619 F. 2d 72 (Emer. App. 1980), supports the use of a preclusion order rather than dismissal as a sanction in 
this case.  In Evanson , the District Court after finding that the defendant had given false and evasive answers to interrogatories, 
entered an order declaring that the defendant had knowingly violated the applicable price regulation, and directed the defendant 
to pay plaintiffs' attorney's fees and expenses of investigation in the amount of $ 60,691.09.  The defendants argued that its 
answers were correct based on its own interpretation of the interrogatories, and the District Court did not flnd that the defendant "
1209,," had engaged in deliberate falsehood, though it characterized the defendant's conduct as ""recalcitrant"" and ""irresponsible"" and 
observed that ""[g]iving a false answer is itself sufficient evidence of bad faith."" The findings of the District Court in Evanson fall 
far short of the deliberate and continued deception engaged in by PFEL as shown by the record in this case."
1209,9," For example, the bank records of the Container Control account were still in existence when the court ordered PFEL to produce 
them in December, 1977, February, 1978, and July, 1978; Japanese law requires that banks maintain a full set of records for 
each bank account for a minimum of three years. "
1210,10," It is well established that HN10[
] the belated production of documents does not enable the party that failed to produce them 
to avoid sanctions for their willful nonproduction.  See, e.g., United States v. Sumitomo Marine & Fire Insurance Co ., 617 F. 
2d 1368 (9th Cir. 1980); Cine Forty-Second Street Theatre Corp. v. Allied Artists Pictures Corp ., 602 F. 2d 1062 (2d Cir. 1979); 
G-K Properties v. Redevelopment Agency, supra ."
1210,11," PFEL even attempts to turn this fact to its advantage, arguing that no sanctions are appropriate because the trustee is no 
longer able to produce the records at issue.  This argument isses two points fundamental to a just resolution of defendants' 
motion for sanctions. First, the record establishes that PFEL had the power to produce rebating documents and information, both before and after it 
filed its petition under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act, but willfully disobeyed the court's orders to do so. Second, it amounts to an admission that the injury to the defendants is now irreparable.  Unless the sanction of dismissal is 
granted, defendants would be copelled to proceed with this action deprived of any concrete information as to the amounts, 
recipients, and full scope and duration of PFEL's rebating. This incurable prejudice would affect not only the affirmative defenses 
and counterclaim, but also their ability to rebut PFEL's underlying antitrust claims.  To accept PFEL's current position would be 
to grant the bankruptcy estate of PFEL an unfair and potentially decisive advantage arising from PFEL's willful failure, both 
before and after the filing of its petition in bankruptcy, to obey the orders of this court."
1210,12," It is true that in the early stages of the proceedings the court, when it ordered the production of the Davis, Polk and Wardwell 
audit report, which disclosed the nature and extent of Sea-Land's rebating activities, commented to the effect that Sea-Land was 
thus giving plaintiff its case ""on a silver platter."" This comment was subsequently qualified when the court on June 2, 1978, 
denied the defendant's motion to dismiss plaintiff's rebating claims under the Sherman Act.  The court commented that 
""[p]laintiffs are entitled to attempt to show (1) that such practices constitute an unreasonable restraint of trade in the shipping 
industry and (2) that, in conjunction with plaintiffs' other allegations, they may constitute a predatory practice in connection with 
an attempt to monopolize."" "
1211,13," On March 10, 1978, defendants moved for an order striking the rebating allegations of plaintiff's complaint.  They argued that 
where, as in the case of Sea-Land, rebates do not prevent the defendant from operating at a proflt, the payment of rebates does 
not violate either Section 1 or Section 2 of the Sherman Act.  See, e.g., California Computer Products, Inc. v. IBM , 613 F. 2d 
727, 742-43 (9th Cir. 1979); Janich Bros., Inc. v. American Distilling Co ., 570 F. 2d 848, 857-59 (9th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 
439 U.S. 829 (1978); Hanson v. Shell Oil Co ., 541 F. 2d 1352, (1977); Calnetics Corp. v. Volkswagen of America, Inc . 532 F. 
2d 674, 687 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 940 (1976). By an order dated June 2, 1978, the court, for the reasons stated in 
footnote 12, supra , denied defendants' motion. "
1212,14," All references to the Bankruptcy Act herein are to the Act as it stood prior to the enactment of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 
1978, P.L. 95-598.  HN15[
] Since PFEL's bankruptcy proceeding commenced before the effective date of the 1978 Act, it is 
governed by the prior act.  See P.L. 95-598, § 403(a), 92 Stat. 2683 (1978)."
1212,15," See, e.g., 4A Collier on Bankruptcy P70.04, at 55-60 (14 ed. 1978): 3 Remington on Bankruptcy § 1412, at 324-25 (1957 rev.); 
see also, e.g., Bank of Marin v. England , 385 U.S. 99, 101 (1966); Zartman v. First Nat'l Bank , 216 U.S. 134, 138 (1910); York 
Mfg. Co. v. Cassell , 201 U.S. 344, 352 (1906); Matter of Paderewski , 564 F. 2d 1353, 1356 (9th Cir. 1977); Miller v. New York 
Produce Exchange , 550 F. 2d 762, 767-68 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 823 (1977); Matter of Telemart Enterprises, Inc ., 
524 F. 2d 761, 763 (9th Cir. 1975), cert. denied sub nom.  Holzman v. Alfred M. Lewis, Inc ., 424 U.S. 969 (1976). "
1213,16," The cases cited by PFEL deal with preferential transfers, fraudulent conveyances, and the allowance of penalties in 
bankruptcy which are the subject of specific provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.  §§ 93(j), 107(d), 110(c) and (e).  They 
have no application to the instant case."
1213,17," PFEL argues that Jerman and Goggin are inapposite and apply only to contract claims against the government.  This 
argument misses the point.  Jerman and Goggin establish that a claim asserted by a bankruptcy estate may be dismissed 
because of prior fraud of the bankrupt in prosecuting the claim.  This principle applies to the present case."
1213,18," PFEL first suggests that the trustee in bankruptcy is bound only by affirmative defenses which are good against the bankrupt. 
The law is clear, however, that HN18[
] the trustee stands in the shoes of the bankrupt in all respects, not merely with respect 
to affirmative defenses.  Second, PFEL cites two cases in which the bankruptcy trustee asserted the rights of lien creditors, but 
PFEL has no such rights to assert here.  Third, PFEL argues that the trustee would not be liable for taxable costs for the period 
preceding his formal intervention.  Whether or not this argument is valid as to the assessment of taxable costs against the 
trustee, it furnishes no support for the trustee's attempt to prosecute affirmatively against the defendants an action which was 
subject to dismissal in the hands of PFEL itself. "
1214,19," PFEL argues that the effectiveness of the Bankruptcy Court's order authorizing the retention of the Alioto firm terminated when 
Benedict was named as the receiver of PFEL.  In support of this argument, PFEL cites Newport v. Sampsell , 233 F. 2d 944 (9th 
Cir.), cert. denied, 352 U.S. 942 (1956), and Local Joint Executive Board, AFL-CIO v. Hotel Circle, Inc ., 613 F. 2d 210 (9th Cir. 
1980). Neither of these cases lends any support to PFEL's argument.  In the Hotel Circle case there was no Bankruptcy Court 
authorization to enter into the modified collective bargaining agreement involved, and in the Newport case the Bankruptcy 
Court's authorization was held to have terminated when the Chapter XI proceeding ended.  In the present case, PFEL's tenure 
as debtor in possession and Benedict's terms as receiver were both part of a single Chapter XI proceeding.  See, e.g., Nicholas 
v. United States , 384 U.S. 678, 685-86 (1966). Accordingly, HN19[
] the Bankruptcy Court's order authorizing the retention of 
the Alioto firm continued to be effective during Benedict's term as receiver."
1214,20," See, e.g., Nicholas v. United States, supra , at 678, 693 n. 27; In re Imperial ""400"" Nat'l, Inc ., 391 F. 2d 163, 171-72 (3d Cir. 
1968); In re Wil-Low Cafeterias, Inc ., 111 F. 2d 83, 85-86 (2d Cir. 1940); Feldman v. Trans-East Air, Inc ., 366 F. Supp. 66, 69-
70 (E.D.N.Y. 1973), aff'd, 497 F. 2d 352, 355 (2d Cir. 1974)."
1214,21," The cases cited by PFEL do not deal with the binding effect of authorized acts during the Chapter XI period.  Instead, they 
deal with the effect to be given Chapter XI orders after the Chapter XI period; the tolling of the statute of limitations under 
Section 378 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.  § 778, and the priority to be accorded Chapter XI tax claims and administrative 
expenses in the subsequent straight bankruptcy proceeding. "
1215,22," ""[B]ut with the new trustee, we had arranged that basically what would happen, we would continue to prosecute the case, or 
cases, and that they would pay the costs, and that at the end, if -- if there was a -- if we should secure any money for the -- for 
PFEL, that then the Bankruptcy Court, as it did in the past, would simply determine what a reasonable amount would be.  So it 
was not a -- you know, agreements on specific amounts. ""Then when -- then Mr. Benedict wanted me to sign one of the formal documents on that, and immediately prior to that time, Mr. 
Wyle came on, and so Mr. Benedict said to let him do it, so when Mr. Wyle came on -- this is before the evidentiary hearing -- so 
when Mr. Wyle came on, we had the same kinds of discussions, and our position was that we should let the court -- which I 
understood the law to be, that the court, even if you made an agreement, the court would pay -- I mean, the court would 
determine any amount."" ""Anyway, we were told to, you know, continue the case, which we did do."" Hearing of September 4, 1980, at pages 4527-29. "
1216,23," This portion of the Goggin I opinion was cited in Chemical Bank New York Trust Co. v. Steamship Westhampton , 268 F. 
Supp. 169, 175 (D. Md. 1967), a case upon which PFEL relies heavily in support of its argument that the sanction of dismissal 
constitutes an unallowable penalty.  Like the portion of the Goggin I opinion which it cited, Chemical Bank involved a claim by 
the government against the bankrupt estate, not the dismissal of a claim asserted by the estate.  Chemical Bank therefore has 
no application to the dismissal of PFEL's claim against the defendants."
1216,24," Upon the trustee's petition for rehearing, the Court of Claims withdrew its earlier opinion in Goggin I and rendered another 
opinion, which relied upon a ground other than Section 57j of the Bankruptcy Act to invalidate the monetary penalties sought by 
the government, but which reaffirmed the holding that the trustee's contract claim had been forfeited by the prior fraud of the 
bankrupt. Goggin I, supra ."
1216,25," See, e.g., National Union of Marine Cooks and Stewards v. Arnold , 348 U.S. 37, 42 n. 5 (1954); United States v. Sumitomo 
Marine & Fire Insurance Co., supra , at 1369 (quoting Cine Forty-Second Street Theatre Corp. v. Allied Artists Pictures Corp., 
supra , at 1066); G-K Properties v. Redevelopment Agency, supra , at 648."
1216,26," The fallacy of PFEL's argument that the sanction of dismissal is a penalty inconsistent with the Bankruptcy Act is further 
evidenced by HN29[
] Bankruptcy Rule 737, which makes Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure applicable to adversary proceedings in bankruptcy.  Under Bankruptcy Rule 737, the Bankruptcy Court has the explicit power to impose 
sanctions, including dismissal, against the trustee in bankruptcy. "
1218,27," The memorandum which was read by Benedict and returned to Appel the next day recited in part: ""The Japanese agent file search disclosed extensive records of dummy invoices to PFEL's agent, Nippon Maritime Company, 
Ltd., from 'Container Control Co., Ltd.,' an apparently nonexistent corporation performing 'stowcon' services which were actually 
performed in San Francisco.  After attempting to deny it, Nippon Maritime admitted that this was an off-book PFEL fund."""
1218,28," Far from waiving the attorney-client privilege, Benedict took action in January, 1979, to finance Hitt's attempt to intervene in 
this action in opposition to the court's attorney-client order of December 22, 1978. "
1219,29," By contrast, Wyle made repeated requests for a written report on PFEL's claim against Sea-Land.  When he called a meeting 
to discuss this case on August 17, 1979, Wyle emphasized that he was ""not interested in reviewing the procedural problems that 
have occurred so far"" (emphasis in original exhibit)."
1219,30," The defendants' pretrial memorandum states at the outset: ""Two fundamental grounds for the defendants' motion to dismiss are as follows: ""(1) From the outset of these actions, plaintiffs PFEL and States have knowingly sought to deceive the court and the defendants 
concerning the payment of rebates by plaintiffs and their agents.  This deliberate deception constitutes fraud upon the court and 
obstruction of justice which calls for the sanction of dismissal of plaintiffs' complaints, both to vindicate the authority of the court 
and to deter others from similar attempts to abuse the discovery process. ""(2) Despite repeated orders of the court, plaintiffs have failed to produce documents in their possession and that of their agents 
specifying the recipients and dollar amounts of rebates paid by plaintiffs and their agents and other rebating documents. "
1220,," Plaintiffs' failure to obey the discovery orders of the court renders impossible a fair trial on the issue of rebating, and further calls 
for the dismissal of plaintiffs' complaints."" Among the fifty-odd facts specifically recited in the memorandum in support of the motion and illustrative thereof, were the 
following four: ""(1) In or before November 1975 a dummy bank account in the name of a flctitious company.  Container Control Co., Ltd., which 
was actually an off-book PFEL fund, was established through Nippon Maritime in Japan.  This account was established by PFEL 
and was used to pay rebates to Japanese trading companies with respect to cotton shipments.  The account was supplied with 
funds through charges paid by PFEL to Nippon Maritime for non-existent 'stowcon' services supposedly rendered by Container 
Control Co., Ltd.  Initially, PFEL's payments into the 'stowcon' fund were made at the rate of $ 50.00 per barge and $ 10.00 per 
container going through Japan (Exs. 10a, 11a). ""(2) [In the] first quarter of 1976 G.M. Cople of Sea-Land sent partial copies of reports of PFEL's cotton rebating to John I. Alioto, 
President of PFEL (Ex. 29).  John I. Alioto did not respond to Mr. Cople.  Joseph A. Modica, Senior Vice President-Freight 
Operations of PFEL, telephoned Mr. Cople, accused Sea-Land of paying rebates, and told Mr. Cople not to send such reports to 
John I. Alioto in the future. ""(3) May 1976 PFEL doubled its payments into the 'stowcon' fund, from $ 50.00 to $ 100.00 per barge and from $ 10.00 to $ 
20.00 per container (Ex. 10ee).  Joseph A. Modica, Senior Vice President-Freight Operations of PFEL, directed T. c. e/lliott, Vice 
President-Freight Operations of PFEL, to notify Nippon Maritime that PFEL was doubling its payments into the 'stowcon' fund. ""(4) Some time prior to October 15, 1976, according to Salvatore P. Tarantino, formerly Executive Vice President of PFEL, the 
question of whether PFEL should stop paying rebates on cotton was discussed before as well as after the filing of the action 
against Sea-Land."""
1220,31," In its post-hearing reply memorandum PFEL finally admitted that Benedict and Wyle may have suspected or even believed 
that rebates were paid on behalf of PFEL before Ocotber 15, 1976, and that in all likelihood these rebates were financed by 
PFEL funds, and that someone within PFEL must have known of and participated in the rebate program.  PFEL further admits 
that ""[t]here is no question that rebates were paid during the pre-October, 1976 period."" PFEL argues, however, that the 
trustees' notice of PFEL rebating is irrelevant because, PFEL says, the issue before the court is not whether PFEL rebated 
before October 15, 1976, but which individuals authorized such rebates and have testified falsely about them. This argument simply ignores or misstates the record.  Whether rebates were paid on behalf of PFEL before October 15, 1976, 
and whether rebates were authorized and funded by PFEL, have been key issues in this case during the entire pendency of 
defendants' motion for sanctions.  Until May 22, 1980, when PFEL served and filed its amended pledings and interrogatory "
1221,," responses, PFEL's position on these key issues was one of unyielding denial.  All this was well known to Benedict and Wyle, yet 
either of them could have forced the correction of these denials, but chose not to do so."
1221,32," PFEL states that even in the light of hindsight, it is difficult to outline any course of action the trustee could have pursued which 
would have aided the court in its deliberations.  In fact, however, the trustee could have immediately retained new counsel with a 
mandate to find out the true facts and disclose them to the court.  Less than two months after the trustee retained Broad, 
Khourie & Schulz, that firm filed amended replies to Sea-Land's counterclaim and an amended response to defendants' 
interrogatory No. 4.Those amendments are sufficient to demonstrate the falsity of PFEL's prior responses.  They were based 
solely upon counsel's analysis of the record in this case.  This analysis could have been performed at any time after the close of 
the first session of the evidentiary hearing in July, 1979, and before that time a very similar analysis could have been performed 
of a few key exhibits and the depositions which were the basis for defendants' direct case in July, 1979."
1221,33," PFEL argues with insistent repetition that the sanction of dismissal may not be imposed upon the estate of PFEL because the 
trustees and their counsel were innocent of wrong-doing.  To the extent this argument is based upon the assumption that the 
estate is not bound by the actions of PFEL and its counsel as a matter of substantive law, the court has just shown that it is 
without foundation; the estate is bound by the prior actions of PFEL both as a matter of bankruptcy law and under Rule 25(c) of 
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. To the extent PFEL argues that the sanction of dismissal may not be imposed against an 
estate in bankruptcy (or a corporation) for falsehood in discovery unless the trustee in bankruptcy (or the corporation's chief 
executive officer) was personally aware of the falsehood, it is inconsistent with the decisions of the courts.  Were PFEL correct, it 
would be virtually impossible ever to obtain sanctions against a corporation, because the corporation could always avoid the 
imposition of sanctions simply by making sure that its nominal head was kept in ignorance of the conduct calling for sanctions.  
This, of course, is not the law.  Rather, HN33[
] the sanction of dismissal may be imposed upon a corporation when any 
responsible employee of the corporation -- such as Elliott or Tarantino -- has the guilty knowledge that establishes willfulness on 
behalf of the corporation. "

1255,*," District Judge of the Middle District of Florida, sitting by designation. "
1257,1," In our automobile-oriented society the vast majority of persons depend upon gasoline-powered vehicles not only to travel but 
also to engage in their livelihoods, which, in our complex and interrelated economic system, usually affect interstate commerce. 
Hence, a persuasive argument can be made that an agreement restraining the trade of gasoline must necessarily affect 
interstate commerce. However, because the Government presented evidence showing a nexus between the interstate travel of 
persons and the conspirator gasoline stations, we do not address the merits of the above argument."
1257,2," Because we find that the evidence supports the finding that the conspiracy substantially affected interstate commerce, we 
have no need to address the issue whether the restraint occurred in the flow of commerce. "
1258,3," Part of appellants' confusion is due to their consistent characterization of their conduct as being an exchange of prices. As we 
explained earlier, at trial the Government presented evidence of price fixing and the jury chose to credit this evidence. "
1259,4," Certain types of restraints, such as price fixing or some types of market division, are in and of themselves unreasonable 
restraints on trade; these restraints are referred to as per se violations of the antitrust statutes. See, e. g., United States v. Topco 
Associates, 405 U.S. 596, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515 (1972) (market division); Northern Pacific Railway v. United States, 
356 U.S. 1, 78 S. Ct. 514, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1958) (tying arrangement); Fashion Originators' Guild of America v. Federal Trade 
Comm'n, 312 U.S. 457, 61 S. Ct. 703, 85 L. Ed. 949 (1941) (collective refusal to deal); United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 
310 U.S. 150, 60 S. Ct. 811, 84 L. Ed. 1129 (1940) (price fixing). The rationale underlying the concept of per se violations was 
explained in Northern Pacific Railway v. United States, supra, 356 U.S. at 5, 78 S. Ct. at 518. HN5[
] (T)here are certain agreements or practices which because of their pernicious effect on competition and lack of any 
redeeming virtue are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and therefore illegal without elaborate inquiry as to the precise 
harm they have caused or the business excuse for their use. This principle of per se unreasonableness not only makes the type 
of restraints which are proscribed by the Sherman Act more certain to the benefit of everyone concerned, but it also avoids the 
necessity for an incredibly complicated and prolonged economic investigation into the entire history of the industry involved, as 
well as related industries, in an effort to determine at large whether a particular restraint has been unreasonable an inquiry so 
often wholly fruitless when undertaken. Among the practices which the courts have heretofore deemed to be unlawful in and of 
themselves are price fixing, United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 210, (60 S. Ct. 811, 838, 84 L. Ed. 1129); 
division of markets, United States v. Addyston Pipe & Steel Co., (6th Cir.,) 85 F. 271, aff'd, 175 U.S. 211, (20 S. Ct. 96, 44 L. Ed. 
136); group boycotts, Fashion Originators' Guild v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 312 U.S. 457, (468, 61 S. Ct. 703, 708, 85 L. Ed. 
949); and tying arrangements, International Salt Co. v. United States, 332 U.S. 392, (68 S. Ct. 12, 92 L. Ed. 20)."
1259,5," The instant case differs from Gypsum in an additional way. In the instant case, direct evidence of price fixing was presented; in 
Gypsum the Government relied on circumstantial evidence, in the form of price verifications, to prove price fixing. This 
distinction, however, does not affect the outcome of this case. Convictions in this case would be valid even if they rested solely 
on circumstantial evidence so long as the jury was required, as here, to find that defendants knowingly engaged in a conspiracy 
to fix prices. If the jury finds the requisite intent, it matters not that the finding rests on circumstantial evidence. See, e. g., 
Holland v. United States, 348 U.S. 121, 140, 75 S. Ct. 127, 137, 99 L. Ed. 150 (1954) (circumstantial evidence is intrinsically no 
different from testimonial evidence)."
1259,6," ""HN7[
] Resort to the per se rule is justified only when the presence of exclusionary or coercive conduct warrants the view 
that the arrangement in question is a ""naked restraint of trade.' "" E. A. McQuade Tours, Inc. v. Consolidated Air Tour Manual 
Comm., 467 F.2d 178, 187 (5th Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1109, 93 S. Ct. 912, 34 L. Ed. 2d 690 (1973); see Almeda 
Mall, Inc. v. Houston Lighting & Power Co., 615 F.2d 343 (5th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 870, 101 S. Ct. 208, 66 L. Ed. 
2d 90. We find no unusual facts in this case to warrant a conclusion that the price fixing activity engaged in by appellants was 
anything other than a ""naked restraint of trade."" "
1260,7," Appellants liken the instant case to cases concerning presumptions. See Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U.S. 510, 99 S. Ct. 2450, 
61 L. Ed. 2d 39 (1979); Tyler v. Phelps, 622 F.2d 172 (5th Cir. 1980). Conclusive presumptions are conclusions that the law 
requires the jury to make under certain circumstances; permissive presumptions are conclusions that the law allows the jury to 
make under certain circumstances. An instruction that a defendant on trial for deliberate homicide must have intended the 
consequences of his or her voluntary actions is a conclusive presumption. This instruction would effectively eliminate intent as 
an element of the offense, e. g., Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 72 S. Ct. 240, 96 L. Ed. 288 (1952), and is thus 
impermissible.  Sandstrom v. Montana, supra, 442 U.S. 510, 99 S. Ct. 2450, 61 L. Ed. 2d 39. On the other hand, an instruction 
that a jury may infer illegal possession of a firearm by persons in an automobile from evidence of the presence of a firearm in the 
automobile is a permissive presumption. Because there is a rational connection between the presence of the firearm and the 
occupant's possession of the firearm and because the jury is free to reject the presumption, such an instruction is permissible.  
Ulster County Court v. Allen, 442 U.S. 140, 99 S. Ct. 2213, 60 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1979). Neither a conclusive nor a permissive presumption is at issue here. As explained above, in this case we equate a finding of 
intent to fix prices with an intent to unreasonably restrain trade. Nevertheless, appellants phrase the issue in terms of 
presumptions, arguing that the district court mandated a presumption of intent to restrain trade from a finding that appellants 
fixed prices. Phrasing the issue in terms of a mandatory presumption does not alter our result, however, for the Supreme Court 
has indicated that mandatory presumptions are not always impermissible. To base a conviction on a mandatory presumption, 
""the fact proved (must be) sufficient to support the inference of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt."" Ulster County Court v. Allen, 
supra, 442 U.S. at 167, 99 S. Ct. at 2230. Clearly, evidence of intentional price fixing is sufficient to support the inference of 
intentional unreasonable restraint beyond a reasonable doubt; indeed, we think the fact proved conclusively establishes the 
""inference"" of guilt. "
1264,1," Careful review of plaintiffs' complaint and materials offered in opposition to the motion for summary judgment makes it appear 
that three conspiracies have been alleged, although it is difficult to differentiate between them."
1264,2," Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides in relevant part: Every contract, combination in form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several 
States or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal…  15 U.S.C.  § 1. "
1265,3," The Capper-Volstead Act provides in relevant part: dairymen… may act together in associations, corporate or otherwise, with or without capital stock, in collectively… preparing for 
market, handling, and marketing in interstate commerce… [their] products… [S]uch associations and their members may make 
the necessary contracts and agreements to effect such purposes…"
1265,7," U.S.C.  § 291. The Clayton Act provides in relevant part: nothing contained in the antitrust laws shall be construed to forbid the operation of… agricultural organizations… or to forbid or 
restrain individual members from carrying out the legitimate object thereof…"
1265,15, U.S.C.  § 17.
1265,4," Plaintiffs base this argument on the line of cases recognizing an exception to the general rule that an actionable conspiracy 
cannot be created by an agreement between a corporation and its officers, agents, or employees. "
1266,5," The complaint also alleges damages in the form of lost profits as a result of being foreclosed from freely competing for milk 
hauling customers. However, in their submissions to the court in opposition to the motion for summary judgment, plaintiffs 
mention only injury in the form of ""elimination of petitioner as a milkhauler."" Plaintiffs' answer to defendants' interrogatory 25 
states that the damages as a result of defendants' conspiracy were ""lost value of plaintiffs' business."" A party may not rest on 
mere allegations in his pleadings to resist a motion for summary judgment. Burst v. Adolph Coors Co., 650 F.2d 930, 932 (8th 
Cir. 1981)."
1266,6," The court notes the pretrial dismissal of all federal claims, the relatively small amount of judicial effort invested in the state

(1975)."
1276,6," .  Our holding that plaintiff's directed verdict motion was properly denied necessarily disposes, as well, of its argument that the 
district court erred in failing to order a new trial because the verdict is contrary to the weight of the evidence.  HN11[
] When a 
jury has reached its determination, the district court can disturb the result and order a new trial on insufficiency of the evidence 
grounds only if a ""miscarriage of justice"" has occurred.  See Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. v. Aalco Wrecking Co., Inc., 466 F.2d 179, "
1277,187," (8th Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 410 U.S. 930, 93 S. Ct. 1371, 35 L. Ed. 2d 592 (1973). Where, as here, the evidence is such 
that reasonable persons could differ as to the result, the jury's choice of one possible verdict over the other cannot be 
considered a miscarriage of justice."
1277,7," .  Monsanto developed artificial turf in response to a request by the Ford Foundation.  The Foundation's aim was to provide 
urban children with appropriate playing surfaces. This concern arose after a Department of Defense study concluded that urban 
children had less stamina and less energy because their ""play"" was inhibited by the constraints of romping on a concrete 
playground."
1277,8," .  We need not, therefore, reach the question of whether Monsanto's evidence rebutted the presumption of monopoly power 
raised by its large market share (approximately 75-80%).  See United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 571, 86 S. Ct. 
1698, 1704, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778 (1966)."
1277,9," .  Many states, including Missouri, require contracts to contain an ""or equal"" clause allowing products to bid even though they do 
not meet bid specifications. Paschal testified, for example, that SuperTurf won two artificial turf bids, the ""Mesquite"" and 
""Garland"" projects, despite the fact that the bid documents specified ""AstroTurf"" by name. "
1278,10," .  See pp. 1285 thru 1287, infra."
1278,11," .  SuperTurf introduced evidence that the artificial turf specifications adopted by the architect for the stadium at Central Missouri 
State were proprietary specifications written around Monsanto's product.  The architect testified, however, that at the time he 
prepared the specifications, he had not even heard of SuperTurf.  After the architect was contacted by a SuperTurf salesman, he 
added an addendum to the specifications which stated that SuperTurf may be considered as an ""equal product."""
1278,12," .  HN16[
] Variable costs are those costs which fluctuate with a firm's output, including such items as materials, fuel, 
maintenance, licensing fees and depreciation occasioned by use.  Average variable cost is the sum of all variable costs divided 
by output.  Marginal costs are ""the increment to total cost that results from producing an additional increment of output."" 3 P. 
Arreda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law P 712, at 155.  Marginal costs are more relevant for antitrust purposes but are more difficult 
to ascertain because they cannot be determined from traditional accounting method.  The courts often rely, therefore, on 
average variable cost figures to evaluate challenged pricing practices.  See Northeastern Tel. Co. v. AT&T Co., 651 F.2d 76, 88 
(2d Cir. 1981); California Computer Products v. IBM, 613 F.2d 727, 742-743 n.27 (9th Cir. 1979)."
1278,13," .  HN17[
] ""Fully-allocated costs"" are the sum of variable costs and ""fixed costs."" Fixed costs generally include, inter alia, 
management expenses, interest on bonded debt, irreducible overhead and depreciation occasioned by obsolescence.  See 
Northeastern Tel. Co. v. AT&T Co., supra, 651 F.2d at 86. "
1280,14," .  The Court in Berkey Photo, Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 603 F.2d 263 (2d Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1093, 100 S. Ct. 
1061, 62 L. Ed. 2d 783 (1980), although not faced with the precise issue here, expressed its preference for special verdicts or 
interrogatories to the jury in large and complex antitrust cases.  ""In that way the right to a jury trial of all factual issues is 
preserved while the probability of a laborious and expensive retrial is reduced."" Id. at 279 (footnote omitted). "
1281,15," .  The defendant has not contended at trial or on appeal that another state's laws would be more appropriately applied to the 
plaintiff's claim and, in fact, relied on Missouri case law in its brief regarding the plaintiff's state law claims. "
1283,16," .  SuperTurf further charges that the district court failed to properly instruct the jury in two additional respects.  Neither of these 
alleged errors are significant. First, SuperTurf argues that the trial court erred by instructing the jury that any antitrust damages awarded to SuperTurf would 
be trebled.  The court further instructed the jury that they were to assess damages based upon the actual loss incurred, if any. The courts are in conflict as to whether such an instruction is proper.  Compare Semke v. Enid Auto. Dealers Ass'n, 456 F.2d 
1361, 1370 (10th Cir. 1972); Pollock & Riley, Inc. v. Pearl Brewing Co., 498 F.2d 1240, 1242-1243 (5th Cir. 1974); with 
Bordonaro Bros. Theatres, Inc. v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 203 F.2d 676, 678 (2d Cir. 1953). We have found no case from this 
Circuit reaching that issue, and need not resolve it here.  We note that even if the instruction was erroneous, SuperTurf was not 
substantially prejudiced by its use in light of the jury verdict absolving Monsanto of antitrust liability.  See Sulmeyer v. Coca Cola 
Co., 515 F.2d 835, 852 (5th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 934, 96 S. Ct. 1148, 47 L. Ed. 2d 341 (1976); Semke v. Enid 
Auto. Dealers Ass'n, supra, 456 F.2d at 1370. Second, SuperTurf complains that the trial court failed to define ""preponderance of the evidence"" in its jury charge.  On this 
record, we conclude that this error was harmless. SuperTurf also presses for a new trial based on an evidentiary ruling of the district court.  At trial, SuperTurf attempted to 
introduce a memorandum from Patrick Arnall, an in-house attorney for Monsanto, to various members of the AstroTurf staff.  
Monsanto successfully objected on the basis that the communication was protected by the attorney-client privilege.  We have 
examined the memorandum and conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by excluding it at trial. "

1306,1," In a related action, Municipalities of Groton v. Federal Energy Regulatory Comm'n, 190 U.S. App. D.C. 399, 587 F.2d 1296 
(D.C.Cir.1978), petitions for review of FERC orders relating to the New England Power Pool (NEPOOL) were brought by nine 
municipalities of Connecticut and Massachusetts, as well as by the NEPOOL executive committee.  The court upheld the 
FERC's determination that the NEPOOL agreement, which effects a comprehensive interconnection and coordination among 
numerous New England utilities, was proper except for sections 9.4(d) and 9.5 thereof, which were discriminatory.  The FERC 
had ordered that section 9.4(d) be modified and that section 9.5 be eliminated.  Some of the antitrust claims made by the 
municipalities here relate to the NEPOOL agreement. "
1311,2," Although CL&P disclaims reliance on the doctrine of immunity under the antitrust laws for state action set forth in Parker v. 
Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 63 S. Ct. 307, 87 L. Ed. 315 (1943), the district court, 497 F. Supp. at 1050-51 n.11, did to some extent 
rely upon Gas Light Co. of Columbus v. Georgia Power Co., 440 F.2d 1135 (5th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1062, 92 S. 
Ct. 732, 30 L. Ed. 2d 750 (1972), which in turn relied on Parker v. Brown. "
1312,3," In determining the power purchaser's system and billing demands on which the R-1 rates were partially based, the demands 
were calculated for any given month at the maximum clock hours kilowatt demand (a) experienced by the buyer in meeting its 
system requirements from all sources available to the buyer in the 12-month period ending on the last day of the current month 
(system demand), or (b) supplied by CL&P to the buyer in such period (billing demand).  In the FPC proceedings the 
municipalities protested to the ALJ that they would be unable to purchase power economically from other sources or to add to 
their own generating facilities, and further that in establishing the system demand the 12-month period was inappropriate 
because a different rate was in effect in which the level of service was higher than it would be under the proposed rates.  The 
ALJ held that the ratchet provision should be eliminated but permitted CL&P to ""file a new provision to provide for potential 
outages of generating units owned and dispatched by the generating municipalities…."" Connecticut Light & Power Co., Dkt. No. 
E-7743 at 17 (FPC July 29, 1974).  The Commission noted the additional argument of the municipalities that because billing 
demand included self-generation, the ratchet would cause that to be included in the billing demand calculations, as would be the 
case under a system-demand basis.  The FPC also noted that while the ratchet was based on the highest single demand of a 
resale customer during a 12-month period, power supply costs were related to actual monthly demands of a resale customer. 
Connecticut Light & Power, Dkt. No. E-7743 at 11 (FPC Apr. 28, 1976).  As noted in the text, however, on rehearing the 
Commission permitted a modified demand ratchet, which the municipalities had in fact proposed. "
1314,4," Paragraph four provides: The Power Company shall supply the City, hereunder, its requirements as they may be from time to time.  If the City requires a 
capacity increase at any one time in excess of 2,500 kilowatts, written application shall be made to the Power Company for the 
amount of increased capacity required, and the Power Company shall have a reasonable length of time to obtain and install all 
necessary equipment and it shall not be held liable for any reasonable delay in obtaining such necessary equipment or in 
supplying such increased capacity. "
1325,1," .  On 27 February 1979, Mrs. Frances Vanderleeuw was dismissed as party plaintiff with prejudice as to her claim, but without 
prejudice as to other parties plaintiff."
1325,2," .  To date, the claims against three defendants have been dismissed. They included the claims against: Residential Commercial 
Mortgage Corp. (21 February 1979); Virginia Federal Mortgage Corp. (9 April 1979); Fidelity American Mortgage Co. (12 April 
1979)."
1325,3," .  None of the thirty six defendants answering class interrogatories pays interest on the periodic payments they require but one 
denies receiving prepayments at all. Twenty-eight of these defendants require prepayments as a condition to the loan, while five 
others strongly recommend it. Twenty-four defendants have maintained escrow accounts since prior to 1960, some having 
always used the escrow account method, others adopting the practice in the 1930's and 1950's. Three defendants deny 
maintaining escrow accounts for alleged purposes. Nine defendants stated they had converted to the escrow account method 
between 1960 and 1975. In some cases, defendants are required to maintain an escrow account system. "
1327,4," .  Although in Dolgow v. Anderson, 43 F.R.D. 472 (E.D.N.Y.1968) the court suggested that a court might properly require an 
offer of proof as to the substantial likelihood of success on the merits, as a precondition to proceeding with notice and other 
aspects of the class certification process, the procedure was disapproved by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and most other 
courts addressing the issue. See Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 479 F.2d 1005, 1016 (2d Cir. 1972), approved in this respect and 
vacated on other grounds Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 177-78, 94 S. Ct. 2140, 2152-53, 40 L. Ed. 2d 732. See 
generally 3B Moore's Federal Practice P 23.45(3) (2d Ed. 1980). "
1328,5," .  The necessary alignment suggested by the court in Sommers v. Abraham Lincoln Federal Savings & Loan Assoc., supra, was 
that: HN10[
] ""While defendants' claims need not be identical with the class member's, they must be similar enough to permit 
the court to conclude that the claims of the absent members will be fully presented."" Id., at 587."
1328,6," .  In La Mar, the court confused the issues by assuming that the standing requirement had been satisfied and proceeding on to 
address the issue of class certification. Although courts will usually come to the same conclusion through a typicality or standing "
1329,," analysis where the representative is somehow deficient as to standing, it is generally considered to be improper to address what 
are in fact standing issues during a consideration of class certification. See generally 4 H. Newberg, supra, at §§ 7516, 7518."
1329,7," .  Defendants do not raise the issue that concerned the court in Sommers v. Abraham Lincoln Fed. S. & L. Assoc., supra, where 
the court determined that the distinction between conventional mortgages and government financed mortgages were such that 
plaintiffs could not represent class as a whole but, that two subclasses would have to be created.  Id. at 589. "
1330,8," .  Coextensiveness is an issue which may be more properly considered under the issues of typicality, standing or common 
questions than under 23(a)(4). 4 H. Newberg, supra, at § 7518b. To the extent that coextensiveness is considered under 
23(a)(4) it should not be interpreted to mean that the claims be factually identical. See Minnesota v. United States Steel Corp., 
supra; 4 H. Newberg, supra, at § 7518b."
1330,9," .  Not every potential disagreement between members of the class will proscribe the use of a class suit; rather, HN16[
] the 
disagreement must be fundamental and go to the heart of the litigation. 4 H. Newberg, supra, at § 7518c. Standing, just as it is 
improper to consider under typicality, is also an improper consideration at this stage. To the extent that La Mar might apply, the 
present case comes within its exception."
1330,10," .  But see Sommers v. Abraham Lincoln Fed. S. & L., supra (finding that holders of conventionally financed mortgages versus 
government financed mortgages must be separated into two subclasses. "
1331,11," .  See also Windham v. American Brands, Inc., supra, at 71 (expressing trepidation about the use of bifurcated trials) As 
Windham indicates, certain types of class actions do not lend themselves to severability, and the court must decide when the 
issues of liability depend too strongly on the existence of damage, or where other issues are too intertwined to permit 
severability. See generally 3B Moore's Federal Practice, supra, P 23.45(2). "
1332,12," .  Although for purposes of this memorandum the court has segregated the analysis of each element in Rule 23, courts 
regularly merge one or more of these elements in their consideration. This is particularly true with regard to the predominance 
and superiority issues which are often addressed commonly when discussing the manageability of a particular suit. See e.g. 
Windham v. American Brands, Inc., supra. "
1335,13," .  That some plaintiffs would find themselves possibly in more than one subclass, unlikely in this case, would not preclude class 
certification as each plaintiff could be represented in each class or elect to be excluded from any given class. See Pruitt v. Allied 
Chemical Corp., supra, at 113; Schmidt v. Interstate Federal Savings and Loan Assoc., 74 F.R.D. 423 (D.D.C.1977). "
1336,14," .  Although this procedure was specifically approved by the Third Circuit in Bogosian v. Gulf Oil Corp., 561 F.2d 434 (3d Cir. 
1977) cert. denied 434 U.S. 1086, 98 S. Ct. 1280, 55 L. Ed. 2d 791 (1978), the Fourth Circuit rejected that court's approval of 
the Fourth Circuit's panel opinion.  565 F.2d 59, 71. "
1337,15," .  Plaintiffs suggest that an interest factor might be applied to the amount that they deposited in the escrow accounts. The 
proper interest level might be determined either by an analysis of the bank's returns on its investment or by simply paying a 
savings account or other rate of interest on the escrow accounts. Furthermore, in developing the formula, a procedure could be 
added to include any setoffs and counterclaims that a defendant might have against a particular plaintiff. Presumably, all this 
information is within or could be determined through the bank's computer."
1337,16," .  Indeed, it is the view of the Court, at least at this stage, that the issues presented, if they are subject to governmental 
interference at all, are more properly subject to legislative rather than judicial oversight. "
1338,17," .  Factors (B) and (C) have little bearing on the present action. Factor (A) supports the use of the class action device in this 
case as not one of the plaintiffs has come forward to express an interest or willingness to pursue the suit individually."
1338,18," .  Such an analysis comports with the idea that HN28[
] none of the four suggested factors should be determinative of the 
grant or denial of class status as they are simply pertinent details to be checked; their presence or absence reflecting on the 
advisability of allowing a class suit to go forward. 3B Moore's Federal Practice, supra P 23.45(4.-1). "
1339,19," .  The Court has considered defendants' motion of 8 October 1981, to delay certification of the class pending a ruling on 
defendants' motion for summary judgment, but sees no benefit either to defendants or plaintiffs in further delaying its ruling. Defendants argue that delaying class certification might avoid the expense and burden of notice. The fact is that the expenses 
defendants foresee would probably be incurred eventually whether or not the present putative class is certified. See Shelton v. 
Pargo, Inc., 582 F.2d 1298 (4th Cir. 1978). The Court is mindful of the potential negative ramifications that notice might have on 
the good will and reputation of the various defendants, regardless of the outcome of the case. The Court will endeavor to 
minimize this effect through the notice process. The Court does not believe, however, that a delay or denial of class certification would lead to the conservation of judicial time 
and resources contemplated by defendants, for the reasons previously stated. While the Court does not act as a robot in the 
application of Rule 23(c), when the Court determines that substantial reasons to delay further are lacking, it must comply with 
the dictates of the Rule. "
1344,4," .  The bar of the statute, if it is clearly evident on the face of the complaint, may properly be raised on a motion to dismiss.  
Steiner v. 20th Century-Fox Film Corp., 232 F.2d 190, 197 (9th Cir. 1956). "
1345,1," .  I recognize that another judge of this district has concluded that Mulvey's vitality has not been vitiated by Brunswick and is still 
controlling.  Laughlin v. Wells, 446 F. Supp. 48 (C.D.Cal.1978)."
1345,2," .  The Beef Indus. holding is particularly instructive, because both the Fifth and Ninth Circuits apply the same ""target area"" 
approach to determine standing in antitrust cases.  In re Coordinated Pretrial Proceedings in Petroleum Products Antitrust 
Litigation, 497 F. Supp. 218 (C.D.Cal.1980)."
1345,3," .  No conspiracy is alleged in this claim, other than the incorporation by reference of the alleged block-booking conspiracy. The 
only contract alleged is the one between NBC and Xanadu.  The second claim, therefore, fails to state a claim under § 1 of the 
Sherman Act because it does not allege an operative contract, combination or conspiracy. "
1346,5," .  The holding in Twin City was, in turn, based on a footnote in Hanover Shoe Inc. v. United Shoe Mach., 392 U.S. 481, 502 
n.15, 88 S. Ct. 2224, 2236 n.15, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1231 (1968), which stated that defendant's action in collecting rent on a lease that 
violated the antitrust law constituted a continuing antitrust violation, even though the lease had been executed outside the 
limitation period.  See also Imperial Point Colonnades Condominium, Inc. v. Mangurian, 549 F.2d 1029 (5th Cir.), cert. denied 
sub nom. Mangurian v. Thompson, 434 U.S. 859, 98 S. Ct. 185, 54 L. Ed. 2d 132 (1977); Baker v. F & F Inv., 420 F.2d 1191 (7th 
Cir.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 821, 91 S. Ct. 40, 27 L. Ed. 2d 49 (1970). "
1347,6," .  Plaintiffs' standing to pursue this claim also appears to be highly doubtful.  Since plaintiffs seem to be claiming that their own 
syndicator, NTA, was one of the conspirators in the attempted monopolization scheme, plaintiffs would appear to be the 
beneficiaries and not the victims of the attempt, i. e., the injury, if any, suffered by plaintiffs from NTA's attempt to monopolize 
was not an antitrust injury.  See Part I, ante. "
1364,1," On February 23, 1979, during trial, defendant Adelman filed a motion to dismiss.  Subsequent to trial, on December 21, 1979, 
defendant filed his memorandum in support of this motion to dismiss. At this time, this court denies that motion. The basis for defendant's motion is as follows.  On February 26, 1976, after the commencement of Case No. 74 C 2814, Mr. 
Adelman filed a petition for an arrangement under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act.  The claims of plaintiffs in this case were 
listed by Adelman in the Schedules filed with the Bankruptcy Court and plaintiffs received notice of the proceedings. However, at no time during the bankruptcy proceedings did plaintiffs file a proof of their claim or an objection to a discharge of 
their claim. On July 14, 1976, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the plan of arrangement in the Bankruptcy Court.  Relying 
on the confirmation order, Adelman contends that plaintiffs are barred from pursuing this action.  This court disagrees. "
1365,, The confirmation order of the Bankruptcy Court reads in pertinent part:
1365,1," .  The debtors are released from all their dischargeable debts and, the Plan providing for an extension, dischargeable debts 
shall include all unsecured debts, demands or claims of whatever character, whether provable as debts under Section 63 of the 
Bankruptcy Act and whether liquidated or unliquidated, fixed or contingent."
1365,2," .  Any judgment heretofore or hereafter obtained in any court other than this court is null and void as a determination of the 
liability of the debtors with respect to any of the following: (a) Debts not excepted from the discharge under Section 17a and b of the Act; (b) Debts discharged under Section 17c(2) of said Act; and, (c) Debts determined to be discharged under Section 17c(3) of said Act."
1365,3," .  All creditors whose debts are discharged are enjoined from instituting or continuing any action or employing any process to 
collect such debts. Defendant Adelman contends that the present claim is among those discharged and, therefore, pursuant to paragraph three 
above, plaintiffs ""are enjoined from… continuing any action…."" Defendant, Adelman, relies on Section 72(a) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.  § 35(a) which provides that the debtor is released 
and discharging from all debts except those specifically enumerated within subsection (a).  (Emphasis added). However, what defendant fails to note, and what is of primary importance in the instant case, is that § 17(a) states that a 
bankrupt-debtor is released or discharged from all of his provable debts. Section 63, 11 U.S.C.  § 103 provides which debts of the bankrupt may be proved and allowed and includes in relevant part: (1) 
fixed liabilities, as evidenced by a judgment or an instrument in writing; (2) costs taxable against the bankrupt; (3) a claim for 
taxable costs; (4) an open account, or a contract express or implied; (5) provable debts reduced to judgments; (6) an award of 
an industrial accident commission; (7) the right to recover damages in any action for negligence; (8) contingent debts and 
contractual liabilities; (9) claims for anticipating breach of contracts. Plaintiffs' claims here, which defendant Adelman seeks to have this court declare to be dischargeable, clearly do not fall within 
any of the eight categories of debts which could have been proved in defendant's bankruptcy proceeding.  Consequently, 
defendant cannot now claim that plaintiffs' failure to file a notice of claim under § 35(c)(2) as to the nondischargeability of their 
claim resulted in the dischargeability of plaintiffs' claim.  Defendants contention begs the point, which is that one can file a claim 
only as to provable debts.  A pending lawsuit, for which no judgment was rendered or renderable on July 16, 1976, the date on 
which Adelman's plan was confirmed, was not among the debts provable under the old Bankruptcy Act and, therefore, could not 
be subject to a discharge under the plan. Accordingly, it is ordered that defendant, Adelman's, motion to dismiss be and the same is hereby denied. Also, this court reserved ruling at trial on the following exhibits: Plaintiffs' Exhibits PX 97A PX 99 PX 387 PX 388 PX 425 Defendants' Exhibits DX 37 DX 85 DX 218 At this time, this court rules that these exhibits be excluded. "
1366,," Additionally, at this time, the court notes that defendants' objections at trial, to the hearsay nature of the testimony of alleged co-
conpirators, be and the same are hereby denied; the objections to co-conspirators testimony which related to statements not 
made in furtherance of the conspiracy be and the same are hereby granted."
1366,2," On October 18, 1978, this court granted plaintiffs' motion to consolidate cause No. 74 C 2814 with cause No. 78 C 3621.  The 
complaint in 78 C 3621 named as defendants, Albert Adelman, the NBA, Madison Square Garden, Inc., California Sports, Inc, 
Capital Bullets, Inc., Atlanta Hawks Basketball, CPSC, and Phoenix Professional Basketball. On January 23, 1979, this court 
ordered that the complaint in 78 C 3621, pursuant to stipulation, be dismissed without Square Garden, Inc., California Sports, 
Inc., Association, Madison Square Garden, Inc., California Sports, Inc., Missouri Valley Professional Sports, Texas Sports 
Investment, Inc., Atlanta Hawks Basketball, Inc., Phoenix Professeional Basketball, and Capital Bullets, Inc.  Defendants 
Adelman and CPSC remained. The court ordered further that, pursuant to stipulation by the parties, the amended complaint filed in case No. 74 C 2814 be 
dismissed against defendants, Abe Pollin, California Sports, Inc., and Madison Square Garden Center, Inc. On January 25, 1979, 74 C 2814 and 78 C 3621 were consolidated for all purposes. "
1367,3, Any finding of fact which may be more properly termed a conclusion of law shall be deemed a conclusion of law. 
1368,4," Edward Ginsberg and George Steinbrenner are not defendants here but are defendants in a companion case brought by 
plaintiffs in Cleveland, Ohio. "
1370,5," It is not clear, specifically, when or how Fishman became aware of the fact that the Bulls might be for sale.  Defendants 
suggest that Dick Klein, unable to find interested buyers in the Chicago area, contacted Fishman, a personal friend, in early 
1971 to advise him that the team was for sale."
1370,6," Fishman discussed his arena preferences at length on January 19, 1972, both at a Standard Club luncheon meeting and at a 
morning meeting held on that date among Adelman, Steinbrenner, Ginsberg, Fishman, and Fishman's attorneys to discuss more 
specific matters relating to the acquisition. The discussion on arena sites and leases that morning reflected a deep disagreement 
of business judgments between Ginsberg and Steinbrenner on the one hand and Fishman on the other.  Ginsberg and 
Steinbrenner told Fishman that as long a term lease at the Chicago Stadium as possible was necessary in their business 
judgments for the them to proceed with the purchase of the franchise. They suggested a 10-year lease. Fishman disagreed 
because of his feeling that since pay television was going to provide an alternate source of revenue that would exceed revenue 
derived from ticket sales, an alternate arena site such as the Amphitheatre was just as good as the Chicago Stadium. Ginsberg 
and Steinbrenner disagreed. "
1371,," At the luncheon, Fishman's demand for an employment contract and a finder's fee of a free 10% equity interest was discussed.  
Also discussed at length were Fishman's theories as to how to vigorously promote the Bulls and increase their revenues. Fishman also reiterated his opinion at the luncheon meeting that the Chicago Stadium was not the right place for the Bulls to 
play.  He indicated that the group should not enter a long-term lease there, but rather should keep its options open because they 
would have other avenues open to them.  Fishman also made it clear at this meeting that he was not concerned about where the 
Bulls would play, indicating that because of the great potential revenue from pay television, it made no difference if the Bulls 
played in a high school gymnasium. "
1375,7," (1) POLLIN Deposition. Q What it all boiled down to, then, in the final analysis, was that the NBA board of governors as a group elected to take the 
position that the only place to play in Chicago was the Chicago Stadium, is that correct? "
1376,," MR. JOSLIN: I object to the form.  That is not correct.  There was no other place presented to us.  The place that was presented 
to us, Chicago Amphitheater, was not approved because it was not acceptable. Deposition p. 55. (2) KLUTZNICK A Well, I think that's the only meeting that I can recall ever having attended with Mr. Fishman, and when that meeting was over, I 
was leaving the country, as I recall.  I am always leaving or coming, in any event.  And I said to Lester Crown, ""Look, if you are 
going in, then you can count me in.  But you better be sure you know what you are doing.  I don't like the discussion of the 
stadiums."" And I said so to Mr. Fishman, as a matter of fact.  There were some discussions, and I said, ""I don't think that's a 
viable idea and doesn't make sense, and, as far as I am concerned, I don't think he knows the Chicago market, and you can't 
build a stadium, make it work, on that basis."" And at that time the impression I had was that he was the leader of the group that 
came in.  Well, what his role was subsequently to be, if there was an organization, I had not participated in, and had no 
knowledge.  I would have guessed that he knew more about basketball than the others that were there, because they didn't 
know very much, and I didn't know anything.  I don't know too much today. Q Were you asked that question and did you make that answer? A I would think so. Q All right, sir.  What was the ""basis"" that you referred to when you said you can't built a stadium, make it work, on that basis? A Well, he was talking about building a stadium as a private venture, and I think subsequent events have developed that unless 
you get some public participation and payment, that it isn't viable.  My guess would be, from what I learned subsequently, it 
would take a couple hundred nights of commitment to make almost any stadium pay on the basis of then building costs, leave 
alone today's.  It just don't make sense bu siness-wise to me. TR. 807-808. (3) GINSBERG Q Did you have any idea or position yourself, did you have any feelings about building an arena? A Well, I have had enough experience that in my opinion, it would be silly to go out and build an arena and invest that kind of 
money and get involved in building arenas when there was an adequate place to play at this time. Q Would you discuss for us just very briefly your experience, Mr. Ginsberg, in this general area? A Well, a great deal of y practice is involved in representing large developers and real estate people and doing a lot of financing, 
and I know the headaches and the problems and arenas are very, very costly and uneconomical to operate, and they're not the 
greatest investments in the world.  And I certainly didn't want to get involved in being in the arena business. TR. 4721. (4) ROTHENBERG Q Did you discuss your preference for the Crown group with any other NBA Governors during this time period? A Again, I can't specifically recall any conversation.My views were clearly known by that time, and I'm sure I lobbied people 
during that period of time, but I don't really remember a conversation specifically. Q Did you attend the July, 1972 NBA meeting? A Yes. Q Do you recall when and where that was held? A Second floor of the Essex House, and I don't remember the date. Q The Essex House is in what city? A New York City.  I'm sorry. Q Was there a discussion at the meeting concerning the proposed transfer of the Bulls to the Fishman group? A Yes. "
1377,," Q And can you recall who said what on what subjects at that meeting? A It was pretty similar to the Greenbrier, except that the new twist was that at that time the Fishman group was proposing to put 
the team in the Chicago Amphitheatre, and there was, as I recall, some handout showing some artist's drawing, if I recall 
correctly, on what the Amphitheatre would look like after some improvements were going to be made in it. Q Do you recall if any presentation was made concerning the Amphitheatre? A Yes, I do recall. Q Do you recall who made that presentation? A If I remember correctly, Mr. Fishman did, but certainly Mr. Rich was there.  I don't remember if he invited Mr. Fishman or not, 
but it was one or the other or both. Q Do you recall what was said on the subject of the Amphitheatre at that meeting by either Mr. Fishman or Mr. Rich? A That it was, in their opinion, their first choice, that it wasn't because of the unavaiability of the Chicago Stadium, but that they 
really felt it was preferable, that with the improvements that were being made, it would be a nice place and would do just fine, 
and they were -- somehow I can't remember the figure -- I think it was $ 250,000 of improvements that supposedly were going to 
be made to the Amphitheatre that would refurbish some things, concession stands, looker rooms - I don't remember exactly. Q Between the time of the vote on the Boston transfer at that meeting and the time that the Governors voted on the Chicago 
transfer, did you have a conversation with Mr. Rich and Mr. Fishman? A It's quite possible. Q Did you say to Mr. Rich or Mr. Fishman, ""We had to vote yes on the Boston franchise in order to vote no on your franchise""? A That's quite impossible, because we voted no on the Boston franchise. Q Do you recall what the vote was on the proposed transfer of the Bulls franchise at that meeting? A I'm -- I'm recalling ten to seven in favor, but, again, shy of the three-quarter vote. Q And how did you vote? A No. Q Why did you vote no? A Same reasons as at the Greenbrier.  I didn't think anything had changed.  As I understood it, the Crown group was still willing 
to meet Mr. Rich's price, and then after that, financial and character qualities of the proponents, sports experience, and arena 
availability, and commitments all favored the Crown group. TR. 5143-5145. (5) RICH Direct. Q Mr. Rich, you attended and were present at the NBA meeting on July 11, 197 , wherein the proposed transfer of your 
franchise to Illinois Basketball, Inc. was discussed, is that right? A That is correct. Q Now, what do you recall was said at that meeting, and by whom, if you will? A I recall that the meeting opened -- let me just talk about what our presentation was -- that our presentation opened with Marv -- 
and I don't recall whether there was somebody else there with him or not, and I don't recall whether he had the opportunity to go 
through his whole presentation or not -- but, there was more discussion at that meeting than there had been at the Greenbrier 
meeting.  At the Greenbrier meeting my impression was that the League didn't want to talk about it, they wanted to get it over 
with as quickly as possible and to have it come to a vote as quickly as possible.  At this meeting I sensed there was some feeling 
that they had to talk about it more.  Specifically what kind of presentation Marvin made, I do not recall. Q Do you recall what anyone else at the meeting said? A Once again, Ned Irish -- my recollection is Ned Irish was the main spokeman against this transfer.  Other people had some 
things to say, but I don't recall what it was. "
1378,," Q Do you recall if anything was said by anyone with respect to the Chicago Stadium? A Yes. Q What do you recall was said about that subject? A That that was a much more desirable facility. Q Do you recall who said that? A No, I don't recall who said it. Q Was anything said to the NBA members by you or -- MR. HANLEY: Excuse me, I will move to strike that last answer, your Honor.  There is insufficient foundation for that statement. THE COURT: Well, he said that someone at the meeting -- as I understand, a member of the Board of Governors -- made some 
statement to that effect. BY THE WITNESS: A Some one or more members of the Board of Governors.  Ned Irish is one that I do remember specifically, and I referred -- but 
others -- other than Ned Irish, which others made some statements, I can't specifically recall, but there were other statements 
made about the desirability of the Stadium. THE COURT: Overruled. BY MR. SPERLING: Q Was anything said to thre NBA Board meeting at that time by you or by anyone else on behalf of Mr. Fishman as to what 
efforts if any had been made to secure a lease at the Chicago Stadium? A Yes. Q And what do you recall was said, and who said it? A I said it, and I said that we had made an effort to secure a lease at the Stadium for Mr. Fishman, but Mr. Wirtz had decided 
that he would not make that available. Q Mr. Rich, do you recall what the results of the NBA meeting was with respect to your proposed transfer? A It was turned down. Q And can you testify as to what posture your group was in at the time that the proposed transfer to Illinois Basketball, Inc. was 
rejected vis a vis the sale of the Chicago Bulls? A When you say our group, do you mean our owners? Q Right. A Are you talking about at the time that we were in New York or on the return? Q Wall, my question is what if any other deal, acceptable deal, did you have at that time with respect to the sale of the Chicago 
Bulls? A Now, this is at the time that were are in New York? Q The time after you were rejected by the NBA Board. A At this point we did not have any other acceptable offer for sale, and it began to occur to us -- and this would have been in 
conversation with Marv Fishman and Jack Guthman -- and I don't recall whether Jack Guthman was there or not, or whether it 
was Alan Olschwang -- that if we, the Bulls, want to move -- MR. HANLEY: Excuse me.  I will have to object to this conversation as hearsay, your Honor. MR. SPERLING: Your Honor, I would ask that the witness be permitted to finish his answer, and then if there's a problem, there 
be a motion to strike, but I do object to the constant interruption of the witness while he is in the middle of an answer. "
1379,," MR. HANELY: The witness is starting to go into a conversation, your Honor.  There has been no foundation.  It is clearly 
hearsay.And the conversation between him and his lawyer -- between him and Olschwang and/or Guthman, I don't know how 
else to protect the record than to object when hearsay conversations are -- THE COURT: Sustained. BY MR. SPERLING: Q Mr. Rich, what was your -- strike that.  What did you do next with respect to the sale of the Chicago Bulls, if anything, after the 
NBA July 11th meeting? A It began to occur to me, after I had talked with the people who were working for me, that one of the alternatives that we had 
was we ourselves to move to the Amphitheater, and to take a lease at the Amphitheater, and to play in the Amphitheater.  The 
other alterative that we had was to see if the Adelman-Crown group were still interested in buying the franchise. Q You say one of the things that occurred to you was to look into the Amphitheatre.  What caused you to come to that 
conclusion? A Well, there were - there were two reasons: One, Arthur Wirtz might not want to talk to us after our not having submitted the 
Crown-Ginsberg lease to -- proposal for sale, to the League; and it also occurred to me that maybe one way we could effect the 
transfer to Marv Fishman would be for us, as a group, to ourselves move to the Amphitheatre.  We would then have a lease at 
the Amphitheatre, and after we were at the Amphitheatre, we could then go to the -- with this proposal for sale -- on the absis 
that we were already playing in the Amphitheatre.  I felt, after again talking with the people who worked for me, the lawyers and 
my other people in the officer, that our position with the League might be very strong in that sense. Q Did your group make a decision as to which half to pursue? A Yes. Q And what did you decide to do? A We decided to pursue a possible sale to the Crown-Wirtz group. TR. 2930-2935/ (6) AXELSON (Deposition). Q But the Kansas City team wasn't going to directly benefit from an increased thousand in attendance at a Chicago Bulls game, 
was it? A I think the Kansas City club benefits directly from the appearance of a team in the second market in the county, in our 
television contracts, in our publicity, in many other ways. Q Will you explain that statement further, please.What do you mean by the second market? A It is the second television market and is a very important part of our negotiations with national television networks which result 
in a big proportion of our income. Q You are referring to Chicago now, are you not? A Uh huh. Q And that, I gather, in your opinion is an important aspect of any NBA basketball franchise? A I don't understand your question. Q Well, the size of the market, I gather, is important? A Very important, yes.  By example, would a motion be made to move the Boston franchise to a lesser market I doubt that it 
would pass our Board of Governors. Q Uh huh. A The same would apply to Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Philly. Q What else did you say to the Board of Governors meeting? "
1380,," A I made one other statement that is reflected in my notes.  I said that the ABA would be able to book the Stadium. Our attorney 
cites anti-trust implications. Q What does that mean? A I meant that should either franchise -- should our NBA franchise play in another building besides the Chicago Staidum I doubt 
-- I doubt it, and that was based on my opinion as a building manager and on advice of our counsel -- I doubt it that the owner of 
the Chicago Stadium could refuse to rent the building to the ABA, which, in our opinion at the time, was trying to establish a 
franchise in Chicago in competition with our present one.  That was a consideration in our vote. Q And did you make that statement to the Board? A I did make that statement. Q Did you say anything else? A Not that my notes show or that I recall. Q Why did you make such a statement to the Board? A In the -- Q By such a statement I mean what appears to be, and correct me if I am wrong, a prepared statement where you wrote down 
notes and stood up and made a prepared statement. A It was prepared at the meeting and as the meeting went on, yes.  I wrote it down in advance of my making the statement to 
make sure that I -- I always do --to make sure that what I was saying made some sense, at least to me, and it was made in the 
context of discussion of the situation. Q Well, was there a purpose -- let me make that -- was your purpose to induce other NBA members to vote against this 
proposed transfer to the Fishman group? A It was made in the normal area of discussion of a problem, as we do within the League, within the Board of Governors 
meetings, to explain the Kansas City position. Q And your position was what? A What I just said, those five points. Q But I mean the bottom line was that the transfer to the Fishman group should not be approved, is that right? A That the -- as it was presented with play in the International Amphitheater not be approved, that is right. Q Did you deem the Chicago Stadium to be a more desirable facility for professional basketball than the Amphitheater? A Yes. Q Can you state relatively how much more, slightly more desirable, much more desirable, how would you -- how would you rate 
the desirability of the two facilities? A Well, one is at 4300 South Halsted and the other is at 1800 West Madison.  I call that a draw.  The size is roughly 20,000 to 
9,000.  Certainly acceptability in the community over the years, with great [sic] highly in favor of the Chicago Stadium. TR. 2361-2364. (7) PUTNAM (Deposition). BY MR. CLACK: Q While you were at White Sulphur Springs did you have occasion to meet Mr. James Cook, the apparent president of the 
Chicago Professional Sports Corporation? A Yes, I did. Q Who introduced you to Mr. Cook, if you recall? A I don't recall.  I think Mr. Cook introduced himself, made a point of meeting the Governors of the NBA. Q And do you recall any discussions you had with Mr. Cook at that time? "
1381,," A Mr. Cook indicated their interest in making an offer to buy the Bulls and discussed the makeup of their group. Q Did he make any statement with reference to having a lease on the Chicago Stadium other than indicated in the telegram? A No. Q Did you participate in the discussions and the vote at White Sulphur Springs in June of 1972 on the application of Illinois 
Basketball, Inc. for transfer of the franchise to that organization? A Yes, I did. Q And did you vote for or against that application? A Against. Q And would you mind telling us why you voted against it? A I felt quite strongly that the Amphitheater was not suitable for the NBA to move back to.  I had reaffirmed with discussions with 
my general manager Richie Guerin, who had been a player and coach in the NBA for a number of years, who felt it was not 
major league facility, felt very strongly. Q Were you aware of any facility in Chicago that you considered a suitable place for the Bulls to play other than the Chicago 
Stadium? A No. Q Prior to the discussion and the vote that was taken on the application of Illinois Basketball, Inc. for the purchase of the 
Chicago Bulls franchise had the NBA Board of Governors been advised by the Financial Committee of the NBA Board of 
Governors as to whether or not it considered Illinois Baketball, Inc. a financially qualified group? A There was a report given by, I believe it was Simon Jardine, who was one of the commissioner's deputies who had 
investigated the ownership from a league standpoint and felt that they recommended that they qualify. TR. 411-412. (8) PATTERSON (Deposition). Q Do you recall ever considering the relative merits of the Fishman group and any other group with respect to proposed 
ownership of the Chicago Bulls? A Yes. Q What do you recall about the relative merits? A The other group came to be -- came to surface as a group, I believe, associated with Arthur Wirtz. Do I have a question now? Q Do you recall weighing the relative merits of the two groups? A I recall weighing the relative merits of the two groups and the opinion swung towards the Wirtz group, as it related to a place 
available to play the NBA basketball games. Q What other relative consideration, what other considerations did you weigh? A That is the only thing that stands out in my mind as to that. Q Did you consider in your mind which group was most closely associated with the city in which the franchise would be located? A Well, the answer is no. TR. 2212. (9) NED IRISH (Deposition). Q Prior to the time that you exercised your vote? A That's right. Q And you exercised your vote in the negative, correct? "
1382,," A Well, I did, yes. Q After giving it due considerastion, correct? A Yes. Q And why did you exercise it in the negative? A Because I was -- we were informed that they were going to play at an amphitheater. Q Who was going to play at the Amphitheater? A That the franchise was going to play its games at the Amphitheater. Q And that was the basis of your decision? A Correct. Q Is that correct? A Yes. Q Any other reason? A No, that's the reasons. Q No other reason? A Didn't have to be any other reasons. Q That was a significant reason in and of itself? A In and of itself it was. Q And we're talking about the meeting at the Greenbrier in June of 1972? A I'm not sure that -- yes, that was my reason. Q O.K., and it had nothing to do with any other consideration you may or may not have given to this situation? A That's correct. Q Correct? A Correct. Q Now, your testimony is that the only information you received about the Arthur Wirtz group, if I may so characterize it, was this 
telegram, correct? A Yes. Q There was no other source of information concerning the application by the Rich group to transfer its franchise? MR. SPERLING: I withdrew that question.  It was restated, your Honor, at the bottom of the page: Q What other information were you given concerning the application by the Rich group to transfer its franchise? A I don't recall what it was any other information.  I don't recall what the whole procedure was at all.  My recollection of it is that 
there was no action taken at that meeting.  MR. SPERLING: Skipping to line 13: Q O.K.  You do recall that at that meeting you voted against the transfer because it was your information that the Fishman group 
was going to play at the Amphitheater, and that was the only reason? A That's correct. Q Where did you get that information? A As far as I know, that was the information they gave. Q Who gave? A The Fishman -- the Little or Fishman; whoever made the -- "
1383,," Q Rich, you mean, not little? A Rich. Q Rich made a presentation at that meeting? A Yes. Q And based on that presentation it was your information that Mr. Fishman was going to play at the Amphitheater; and only from 
the presentation, as far as you know; and that was the sufficient reason you needed to vote against Mr. Fishman? A Well, I don't know.  That was enough reason for me, which I had independently of Mr. -- I'm not sure whether at that meeting 
he gave a big presentation with an architect's drawings and stuff of what the improvements they were going to make in the 
Amphitheater and so forth or not.  I don't know whether that was that meeting or subsequent. Q Prior to any time that you exercised your vote on this issue, you were given information that Mr. Fishman and his group, which 
I have characterized as Illinois Basketball, Inc. -- A Yes, right. Q -- were going to play at the Amphitheater? A As far as I know, that's the reason, yes. Q Not the Chicago Stadium? A That's correct. Q Is it your testimony, then, that if Mr. Fishman were going to play at the Chicago Stadium, that you would have voted for 
approval? A He didn't say that.  They didn't say that, though; so I don't know what I would have done. Q But if they had said that, would you have had any reason to vote against Mr. Fishman? A No.  I would have had no reason to vote against him. Q You would have voted for approval, as far as you know? A I would think so. Q There is a finance committee of the NBA? A That's correct. Q And as far as you know, did they perform that function? A I don't know if they did. Q As far as you know, did they perform it? A I can't recollect that they reported on it. Q Do you know that they didn't report? A I don't know.  I can't recollect their participating in the discussion at all. Q Well, that didn't enter into your decision at all, did it, the issues of finances?  It had nothing to do with your decision, correct? A No, but I think if I'd had any other reason, if I'd -- I don't know that they did or they didn't. Q It didn't enter in your decision, though? A No, it didn't.  The site was enough. Q What site would have been acceptable in the Chicago area? A The site where the team was currently playing. Q What site is that? A I thought it was playing at the Chicago Stadium. "
1384,," Q And any other site in the Chicago area? A Well, I don't know whether they did or not; but I know they were playing most of their major games there. Q Was there any other site that you would have deemed acceptable in the Chicago area other than the Chicago Stadium? A No.  They played some games in Loyola, I think.  I don't know which - Loyola -- is that the name of the school out there? Q There is a Loyola. A I think they played at colleges.  I think anything would have been better than the Amphitheater. Q Well, it's your testimony, is it not, that only the Chicago Stadium was sufficient? A No, it isn't. Q It isn't? A What was the question? Q My question is, what other facility in Chicago would have been acceptable to you? A Well, I don't know.  There wasn't any other site. I don't know. Q Do you know of any other facility in Chicago? A Well, I was just thinking.  As you said that, I was thinking of places it might be, but I know that Loyola has had some games in 
it. Q Would that have been an acceptable site to you? A It would have been better than the Amphitheater, yes. Q Would it have been an acceptable site to you? A Not on a personal basis, no. Q And the Amphitheater wouldn't have been an acceptable site on a personal basis? A That would have been an unacceptable place for any game. Q Is there any other facility you can think of in this Chicago area that would have been an acceptable site, on a personal basis? A I would think any college, at Northwestern.  Well, Northwestern is a little small, too, but I don't --I don't -- I'm not very familiar 
with other sites. I do know that the Amphitheater was very unsatisfactory.  We had experience there. Q The NBA had played there? A That's correct. Q And the Knickerbockers had certainly played there? A Yes, they had. Q And you deemed that unsatisfactory? A Very. Q You know of no facility in Chicago other than the Chicago Stadium that you would have approved, is that correct? A I don't know of any, no; there may be some. Q But you don't know of any? A I don't know of any. "
1385,8," Testimony of Rich: Q Getting back to the first conversation you had with Mr. Pollin, what do you recall that he did say to you? A I recall that he said to me, ""What can we do to have you consider the Wirtz group over the Fishman group.?"" Q And what did you respond to him? A Have him sign the contract that we have submitted to them. Q All right now, you had a second conversation with him? A That's right. Q When did that occur? A That would have occurred after the submission to the Greenbrier -- after the Greenbrier meeting. Q And did Mr. Pollin call you on that occasion, or did you call him? A He called me. Q All right, and what was said by Mr. Pollin during that conversation? A Is there anything we can do to get you to set aside the Fishman offer and accept the Wirtz offer? Q And what did you say to him? A That it was too late, they had had ample opportunity and they just hadn't gotten to it. Q You testified that during the same period of time you received a call from Mr. Irish. A That's correct. Q Do you recall what Mr. Irish said to you? A Mr. Irish's call -- I recall that Mr. Irish said to me, ""Look, you should take the Wirtz offer and not the Fishman offer."" Q And what did you say to Mr. Irish at that time, if anything? A That that was just not possible. Tr. 2853-2854. "
1386,9," The following evidence submitted at trial best describes defendants' intentions. Letter from Wirtz to Crown dated November 8, 1972. P.Ex. 127: …  I believe my son, Bill, and I had a great deal to do with lining up the votes to make our deal possible, and this was on the 
second go-around after the first go-around had failed.  This should indicate we are not exactly amateurs in this field. Testimony of Lester Crown: Q Well, was a part of the purpose of your telegram not only to let them [the NBA] know that you had made an offer at that date 
and that you hoped they would reject the Fishman offer because of your offer, but also to let them know that in the event they did 
you would then go on through and purchase the team, if you could, with Mr. Rich? A Absolutely. "
1387,," Tr. 1029, 1032-34, 1090-91."
1387,10," Letter from A. Writz to Rich dated June 27, 1972.  (P.Ex. 72). Testimony of Arthur Wirtz: Q In your letter of June 27th, Mr. Wirtz, which has been marked for identification as Exhibit 72, in telling Mr. Rich and the League 
that you can get a very strong financially responsible group to buy your franchise and players and also a group that would be 
acceptable to us and the League, you were continuing in your efforts to further the interest of the Crown-Wirtz group, were you 
not? A That is correct. Q You were also at the same time, as indicated by the letterhead on which you sent this, and your discussion on what is in the 
interest of the Chicago Stadium, acting on behalf of the Chicago Stadium Corporation, were you not? A Yes. TR. 1218. Letter from Lester Crown to Arthur Wirtz dated November 14, 1972 (P.Ex. 128): …  You replied most graciously that there were many things more important than hard business decisions and that completely 
on your own, you had no intention of entering into an arrangement on the Chicago Stadium with the Chicago Bulls for any group 
other than ours… "

1396,13," For background of this case, see prior opinion at 131 F.Supp. 596 (S.D. N.Y. 1956). "
1398,14," What equitable relief, if any, that may be appropriate here is more properly the subject of the damages hearing which has not 
yet been held. "
1402,15," FN 20 of the Court's opinion is noteworthy.  That footnote provides: United States v. Columbia Steel Co., 334 U.S. 495, 520, 68 S.Ct. 1107, 1120, 92 L.Ed. 1533 (1948). Defendants' citation of 
American Football League v. National Football League, 323 F.2d 124 (4th Cir. 1963), is inapposite.  That case concerned the 
""competition between the leagues for franchise locations;"" since each league was considering expansion to a host of desirable 
sites, the court properly held that the market, geographically, was ""at least as broad as the United states, including Hawaii and 
portions of Canada."" 323 F.2d at 130. This case, by contrast, concerns the potential competition between two teams for 
customers in one location.  Unlike the NFL, the Redskins as ""sellers"" do not operate nationally; unlike the AFL, Hecht is not 
trying to expand nationally.  He sought merely to compete with the Redskins on their home turf."
1402,16," Likewise, FN 21 of the Court's opinion is relevant here: "
1403,," These customers would include potential season ticket holders and occasional ticket buyers, and, to a lesser extent, purchasers 
of local radio and pre-season television broadcasting rights.  Most of a professional football team's broadcasting revenue, of 
course, derives from the national television contract, which is negotiated by the league. As testimony at trial indicated, however, 
individual teams have very little control over the revenue they derive from this contract, and thus the most important factor in 
considering location of a franchise is the potential ""gate"" in the home city.  Tr. (4 Apr. 1975) at 31.  For this reason, national 
television audiences and national television contract revenues should be ignored in ascertaining the relevant market here.  Cf.  
United States v. Philadelphia Nat'l. Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 361, 83 S.Ct. 1715, 1740, 10 L.Ed.2d 915 (1963) (holding relevant 
market to be metropolitan area of Philadelphia, Pa.): [In ascertaining the relevant geographic market,] a workable compromise must be found: some fair intermediate delineation 
which avoids the indefensible extremes of drawing the market either so expansively as to make the effect of the merger upon 
competition seem insignificant, because only the very largest… Customers are taken into account in defining the market, or so 
narrowly as to place appellees in difference markets, because only the smallest customers are considered.  See generally P. 
Areeda, Antitrust Analysis P231 (2d ed. 1974)."
1403,17," With respect to the legality of this ""natural monopoly"" and the local market, the court in AFL v. NFL stated: ""When one has 
acquired a natural monopoly by means which are neither exclusionary, unfair, nor predatory, he is not disempowered to defend 
his position fairly."" "
1408,18," The above-quoted passage also puts to rest defendants' contention that the NBA had contractually given itself absolute 
discretion to deny approval to proposed franchise transfers and, therefore, could not violate the Sherman Act by conspiring with 
CPSC to deny approval to the proposed IBI transfer.  Tr. 4628, 4630.  See also, A.P. v. U.S., 326 U.S. 1, 15 (1945). "
1409,19," The Seventh Circuit, in Sargent-Welch, supra, 567 F.2d at 712 fn.21 noted that: The 1955 Report of the Attorney General's Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws states: "
1410,," The Alcoa case is not to be interpreted as penalizing enterprise; instead it declares illegal monopoly maintained by policies 
intended to discourage, impede or even prevent the rise of new competitors. (Footnote omitted).  Att'y. Gen. Rep. 60 (1955)."
1410,1," Von Kalinowski expresses the opinion that ""careful analysis… of [the Alcoa] holding indicates that monopoly power will be 
condemned by the courts only when such power is maintained by policies intended to limit or prevent the entry of new 
competitors, or to exclude present competitors. 1 Von Kalinowski § 8.02[4], p.8-62 n.146.  Cf. also U.S. v. Griffith, 334 U.S. at 
107; U.S. v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 570-571 (1966); Telex Corp. v. International Business Machines Corp., 510 F.2d 894, 
927-928 (10th Cir.) cert. denied, 423 U.S. 802 (1975)."
1410,20," See also, City of Mishawaka, supra, 465 F.Supp. 1320, aff'd in part, reversed in part, 616 F.2d 976, where Judge Sharp in City 
of Mishawaka relied in part on the District Court opinion of Judge Marvin Frankel in Berkey Photo, Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 
603 F.2d 263 (2d Cir. 1979), which was affirmed in pertinent part by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.  Judge Sharp stated: Judge Frankel regarded the judicial decisions proscribing tieins as per se violations of the antitrust laws to be 'cognate authority' 
for the resolution of charges that defendant Kodak had used the leverage it enjoyed from its monopoly position in one market to 
gain competitive advantage in another.  Concluding that Kodak's use of its market position in the second market was not 
'economically inevitable'… and was 'plainly avoidable' the Court in Berkey found these practices to be in violation of Section 2."
1410,1979," -1 Trade Cas. at 76,638. Accord, Poster Exchange, Inc. v. National Screen Service Corp., 431 F.2d 334, 339 (5th Cir. 
1970). There, a defendant with market power in a manufacturing market refused to sell to a distributor against whom it competed 
in the distribution market: Such conduct has long been held to violate § 2.  This is just the type of evil that the prohibitions on typing and other such per se 
violations are aimed at.  As Mr. Justice Clark said in Times Picayune Publ. Co. v. U.S., 1953, 345 U.S. 594, 611… the essence 
of illegality is the wielding of monopolistic leverage; a seller exploits his dominant position in one market to expand his empire 
into the next… and this conduct cannot be defended on the ground that it was only the exercise of legitimate business judgment. "
1411,21," We note, for clarification purposes, that defendants' also contend that there was no refusal to negotiate a lease as plaintiffs 
allege. "
1414,22," The Court here cited A.D. Neale, The Antitrust Laws of the U.S.A., Cambridge University Press, at 67 (2d Ed. 1970).  This 
authority is also prominently cited in the Hecht opinion.  See, notes 36, 41.  Professor Neale in pertinent part, states: Despite the fact that the Times-Picayune case was lost by the Government, the lesson of the ""bottleneck"" cases in general is 
clear enough.  They establish that if you have dominant power in the market, no matter how innocently and inescapably you 
came by it, you are obliged under antitrust to take the greatest care not to ""throw it about""…  If your monopoly consists of some 
physical facility like a rail or bus terminus or a market building, you must even take your new rival in and share the facility with 
him without discrimination, unless it is clear that he is physicially able to obtain or construct equivalent facilities for himself.  As in 
the Associated Press case, the facility in question does not have to be indispensable for its denial to a rival to constitute a 
misuse of monopoly power. It is enough that the denial imposes a real competitive handicap on him.  The only way to defend 
business activity which is prima facie exclusionary is, as in the case of Times-Picayune unit plan, to show that it is on its merits a 
reasonable and normal response to conditions and also that it has neither the effect nor the purpose of driving out or seriously 
impeding a competitor. Id. at p. 131. Emphasis added. "
1415,23," The fact that Arthur Wirtz acted on behalf of both the Chicago Stadium Corporation and CPSC does not prevent a conspiracy 
from arising.  Integrated or affiliated corporations can be held to have conspired.  U.S. v. General Motors Corp., 26 F.Supp. 353 
(N.D. Ind. 1939). Even a complete overlap in ownership, as where a wholly owned subsidiary is alleged to have conspired with 
its parent, does not preclude a finding of conspiracy. Kiefer-Steward Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 340 U.S. 211 
(1951); U.S. v. General Motors Corp., 121 F.2d 376 (7th Cir. 1941), cert. denied, 314 U.S. 618 (1941). This is particularly true 
where the conspirators seek to injure or coerce third parties.  U.S. v. Standard Oil Co., 316 F.2d 884 (7th Cir. 1963); Report of 
Att'y Generals National Committee to Study Antitrust Laws, (1955) at 34.  Further it has been specifically held that one can 
conspire with a corporation in which he owns stock, Rogers v. American Can Co., 187 F.Supp. 532 (D.N.J. 1960) aff'd., 305 F.2d 
297 (3rd Cir. 1962); or for whom he is an officer, director or agent, if he has independent business reasons for so doing, Poller v. 
Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 368 U.S. 464 (1962); Greenville Pub. Co. v. Daily Reflector, Inc., 496 F.2d 391 (4th Cir. 
1974); Albrecht v. The Herald Co., 390 U.S. 145, 149-150 (1968). "
1416,24," HN47[
] An attempt to monopolize under § 2 requires proof of 1) a specific intent to obtain a monopoly by exclusionary means; 2) some act done in furtherance of that intent; and 3) a dangerous probability that monopolization will actually result.  
Walker Process Equipment, Inc. v. Food Mach. and Chemical Corp., 382 U.S. 172 (1965); Lorain Journal Co. v. U.S., 342 U.S. 
143 (1951). The offense of conspiracy to monopolize under § 2 requires proof of 1) concerted action deliberately entered into 
with the specific intent of excluding competitor from the market; and 2) the commission of at least one overt act in furtherance of 
the conspiracy. Lorain Journal v. U.S., supra; U.S. v. Griffith, 334 U.S. 100 (1948); U.S. v. Yellow Cab Co., 332 U.S. 218 (1947)."
1416,25," HN48[
] Concerted refusals to deal or group boycotts are per se violations of § 1 and require no proof of effect on competition. "
1418,26," This fact alone is sufficient to create illegality, for as the Supreme Court has stated with reference to § 2 it is ""unreasonable per 
se to foreclose competitors from any substantial share of the market."" U.S. v. Griffith, 334 U.S. 100, 107 (1948); International 
Sale Co. v. U.S.., 332 U.S. 392, 396 (1947). "
1421,27," Since the parties to this lawsuit were competing for a monopoly asset, any conspiracy entered into which violates § 1 would 
also be a conspiracy to monopolize, and attempt to monopolize under § 2.  If the conspiracy is successful, monopolization under 
§ 2 is also made out. "
1423,28," The A.P. case does not state in so many words that a per se test was applied, but that conclusion is mandated by the fact that 
no rule of reason analysis was undertaken.  Further, the case has been routinely cited as exemplifying the ""per se"" rule.  See 
e.g., U.S. v. Columbia Steel Co., 334 U.S. 495, 522-523 (1948); Times-Picayune Publishing Co. v. U.S., 345 U.S. 594, 625 
(1953); Report of Att'y General's National Committee to Study Antitrust Laws (1955), 133, 134; Blalock v. Ladies Professional 
Golf Ass'n., 359 F.Supp. 1260 (N.D. Ga. 1973). "
1431,29," Interestingly, in Bailey, unlike in the instant case, Continental was far more closely connected to the underlying contractual 
relationship.  Continental had served as trustee for the Black estate which was the party to the contract between plaintiff and the 
Black COmpany. "
1433,30," As Joe Cook admitted, the Crown-Wirtz group attempted to induce the Rich group to breach their contract with IBI, after its 
execution.  For example, with respect to the Crown-Wirtz group's telegram of July 6th to the Rich group, purportedly ""reinstating"" 
their prior offer to purchase the Bulls, Cook testified: Q.  Well, you are back down to the competition for the --with Mr. Fishman -- in respect to again trying to get the sellers to change 
their mind, aren't you?  A.  Yes.I don't see anything wrong with that sir. Q.  Even though the sellers have already come to an agreement and signed a contract with the buyer? A.  That's up to them.  They can -- at least you can make the offer.I think it is up to them to decide whetehr they want to many 
any change with Mr. Fishman. TR. 372.  Arthur Wirtz also attempted to induce the Rich group to break its contract with IBI, and sell to the Crown-Wirtz group.  
He pursued these efforts in personal meetings with Elmer Rich on June 21st and June 29th, 1972, and by letters of June 27th 
and July 10th.  Having failed in its efforts to directly cause the Rich group to breach its contract with IBI, the Crown-Wirtz group 
accomplished the same purpose indirectly by making performance impossible. "
1434,31," As an aside, this court notes that defendants' inconsistent positions regarding their conduct at the NBA level is characteristic of 
their lack of credibility throughout these proceedings.  As noted, defendants' asserted at trial their position that their 
communications with members of the NBA was privileged. Prior to trial, however, defendants' had denied any intent or effort to cause the NBA not to approve the transfer to IBI.  Rather, 
during the discovery stages and deposition of this litigation, defendants' maintained the position that their sole purpose of 
communicating with the NBA was to ""make the facts known."" Lester Crown's deposition testimony baldly contradicts his trial testimony.  During his deposition, Crown testified that the reason 
the June 12 telegram was sent to the NBA was: A.  To make the facts obviously know to them.  Q.  Well, what did you hope to 
accomplish by that?  A.  To make the facts known to them. Q.  And what was the motivation of your group in making those facts known to the NBA Board of Governors, when they dodn't 
have anything relating to your group on the agenda, or before them for consideration at all? A.  To make the facts known to 
them. Q.  Isn't it a fact, Mr. Crown, that the purpose of that [telegram] was to have them consider in a negative form the application of 
Illinois Basketball, Inc. [plaintiff]…? A.  We wished to make these facts known to them. "
1435,," Crown Dep. pp. 53-54.  In contrast. Crown openly admitted at trial that the purpose of sending the telegram was ""absolutely"" to 
cause the NBA to reject the Fishman offer.  TR. 1029, 1032-34, 1090-91 and this Court's FN. 9. Similarly, Joe Cook's deposition testimony barely resembled his statements at trial.  In his deposition, Cook steadfastly 
maintained that: … I under no circumstances was going to interject myself upon the considerations of the Board of Governors.  I didn't do it.I 
didn't by innuendo or any other way try to influence anyone there. Cook Dep. p.41. However, at trial Cook testified: Q.  I would like to ask you whether or not it was a soft sell or a hard sell, the intent and purpose of your being there and talking to 
them was the same?  A.  Precisely. Q.  And you were trying to secure a rejection of the approval of the Fishman group contract, weren't you?  A.  Uh-huh. In this court's opinion, it is astoundingly unbelievable that these very defendants, who prided themselves on being tough and 
competent businessmen (See, e.g., P. Ex. 127 and this court's FN. 9), had difficulty remembering the events surrounding their 
alleged competition aimed at obtaining the Bull's franchise. Various defendants denied or could not recall during their depositions, the very conduct they attempted to characterize at trial as 
efforts to compete.  During his deposition, William Wirtz didn't recall any of his communications concerning the transfer of the 
Bulls with Bill Putnam, Jack Kent Cooke, or Abe Pollin.  Arthur Writz couldn't recall his communication concerning the transfer of 
the Bulls with Jack Kent Cooke, Ray Patterson, or any other NBA member.  In fact, when asked to explain the statement in his 
letter of November 8, 1972, to Lester Crown, reminding Crown that he and his son Bill were responsible for ""lining up the [NBA] 
votes"", Arthur Wirtz did not recall anything his son Bill had done, and merely recalled that he sent copies of two letters to Walter 
Kennedy and Abe Pollin, as indicated on documents produced from his files.  At trial, defendants' story was different - after 
plaintiff had garnered all the evidence.  The new ""theme"" was previewed in their counsel's opening statements.  ""Our group 
certainly called friends on the Board of Governors…"" Tr. 69. ""… certainly friends of Mr. Wirtz and Mr. Crown attempted to 
persuade the governors to vote against Fishman and to hold out for the Crown-Klutznick group…"" The import of these 
statements appears clear: When defendants could no longer ignore the proof of their conduct; they attempted to structure some 
""justification"" for it. "
1436,32, Any conclusion of law which may be more properly termed a finding of fact shall be deemed a finding of fact. 
1442,1," .  Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corporation and Digidyne Corporation are the only plaintiffs who actually proceeded to trial. A total of eleven separate actions were brought before the Court in the course of this litigation. Three of these actions were 
originally filed in this District: Fairchild Camera & Instrument Corp. v. Data General Corp., No. C-78-2418 WHO; SCI Systems v. 
Data General Corp., No. C-78-2417 WHO; Digidyne Corp. v. Data General Corp., No. C-78-1261 WHO. During 1979 and 1980, 
the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred an additional eight actions for consolidated or coordinated pretrial 
proceedings: Bytronix v. Data General Corp., No. C-79-1101 WHO; Data General Corp. v. Ampex, No. C-79-1102 WHO; Data 
General Corp. v. Ampex, No. C-79-1103 WHO; Data Compass v. Data General Corp., No. C-79-1345 WHO; Ampex v. Data

Ampex, No. C-79-3443 WHO; Keronix v. Data General Corp., No. C-80-1217 WHO. The Court has requested the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to issue an order to show cause why Data General Corp. v. 
Data National Corp. should not be remanded to the District of Massachusetts, in accordance with the procedure set forth in A. H. 
Robins Co., ""Dalkon Shield"" IUD Products Liability Litigation, 453 F. Supp. 108 (Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation 1978). 
The remaining actions were settled prior to the commencement of the jury trial."
1442,2," .  The Court bifurcated the trial and ordered the issue of liability to be tried first, with the trial on damages to follow soon 
thereafter. The scope of the liability trial was confined to the question of whether Data General possessed sufficient economic 
power in the market for the tying product appreciably to restrain trade in the market for the tied product. The Court excluded from the present trial Data General's counterclaims, alleging that plaintiffs had misappropriated its trade 
secrets and proprietary information in the development of their NOVA emulators, and plaintiffs' claim that Data General has "
1443,," instituted ""sham"" litigation regarding its trade secrets, reserving these claims for trial following the trial of the antitrust issue. See 
the Court's Order of July 9, 1980, and the Court's decision on cross-motions for summary judgment, In re Data General Antitrust 
Litigation, 490 F. Supp. 1089 (N.D.Cal.1980)."
1443,3," .  The jury rendered its verdict on June 9, 1981. On June 18, 1981, defendant filed its motion for JNOV, or in the alternative, for 
reconsideration of the Court's grant of partial summary judgment and for a new trial, or in the alternative, for certification for 
interlocutory appeal. On July 10, 1981, plaintiffs applied for an injunction. On August 21, 1981, the Court denied defendant's motion for reconsideration of its decision granting partial summary judgment 
and for a new trial, denied defendant's motion for certification for interlocutory appeal, and took defendant's motion for JNOV and 
plaintiffs' application for injunction under submission. On September 2, 1981, the Court vacated the trial date for the damages 
phase, originally set for October 5, 1981. On September 25, 1981, plaintiffs moved for an early setting of the damage trial."

arrangements create an unreasonable restraint of trade under the ""rule of reason"" analysis. See In re Data General Antitrust 
Litigation, supra n.2, 490 F. Supp. at 1101."

if the verdict is contrary to the clear weight of the evidence or results in a miscarriage of justice.  Murphy Tugboat v. Crowley,

Cir. 1981). "
1462,1," .  The defendants' first motion to dismiss was denied by this court on January 22, 1981."
1462,2," .  Schiessle filed a first amended complaint on August 15, 1979. "
1464,3," .  HN3[
] The court construes the motion to abstain as a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b). "
1465,4," .  The district court dismissed the action as to the Village of Rosemont on the ground that a municipality is not a ""person"" for the 
purpose of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (1975). The Ahrensfeld case was decided prior to Monell v. Department of Social Services, 436 
U.S. 658, 98 S. Ct. 2018, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611 (1978). "
1466,5," .  The only significant difference between the present case and Ahrensfeld is that the complaint in this case was filed prior to the 
now-pending state court condemnation proceeding. HN6[
] While a subsequent state proceeding cannot act as a bar to the 
prior-sought federal relief, the subsequent filing of the condemnation suit does not affect a federal court's ability and 
responsibility to abstain. See generally Ahrensfeld v. Stephens, 528 F.2d 193, 199 n.9 (7th Cir. 1975). The only other concern in 
the present case is whether the case was ripe for adjudication if the basis of the complaint was the threatened condemnation 
proceeding, not the actual institution of such a proceeding.  Since the condemnation proceeding was instituted after the filing of 
this suit but prior to any ruling by this court, the court concludes that the case is properly before the court for the application of 
the Pullman and Younger abstention doctrines."
1466,6," .  HN7[
] Under the Pullman abstention doctrine, a federal court should retain the case pending a resolution of the state court 
proceedings.  Railroad Commission v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496, 501-02, 61 S. Ct. 643, 645-46, 85 L. Ed. 971 (1941). Under 
Burford and Younger abstention, however, most courts dismiss the federal case.  See C. Wright & A. Miller, 17 Federal Practice 
and Procedure: Civil § 4243 (1978).  This court will follow the procedure of the Ahrensfeld court and dismiss counts III through XI 
of the amended complaint."
1466,7," .  The Parker Court did not actually announce a rule of antitrust exemption or immunity, but rather determined that HN10[
] the 
federal antitrust laws do not apply to certain state-maintained activities.  Nevertheless, the courts use the short-hand references 
of state action or antitrust immunity. Kurek v. Pleasure Driveway & Park District, 557 F.2d 580, 587 n.5 (7th Cir. 1977). "
1467,8," .  In Goldfarb, the Virginia legislature had granted to the Virginia Supreme Court the power to regulate the practice of law.  Id. at 
776, 95 S. Ct. at 2007. The Virginia State Bar acted as an administrative agency of the Virginia Supreme Court.  Id.  In addition, 
no Virginia statute referred to lawyers' fees, nor had the Virginia Supreme Court taken any action requiring the use of minimum 
fee schedules.  Id."
1467,9," .  The Court's decision in Cantor, while analogous to allegedly anticompetitive actions by a state or local government entity, 
concerned the extent to which anticompetitive activity by purely private parties is exempt from liability under the federal antitrust 
laws. City of Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., 435 U.S. 389, 410-11 n.40, 98 S. Ct. 1123, 1135-36, 55 L. Ed. 2d 364 
(1978). "
1468,10," .  Justice Brennan delivered the opinion of the Court in which Chief Justice Burger and Justices Marshall, Powell, and Stevens 
joined.  Id. at 391-408, 98 S. Ct. at 1125-34. Justice Brennan also delivered an opinion in which Justices Marshall, Powell, and 
Stevens joined.  Id. at 408-17, 98 S. Ct. at 1134-39 (opinion of Brennan, J.).  Justice Marshall also filed a concurring opinion.  Id. 
at 417-18, 98 S. Ct. at 1138-39 (Marshall, J., concurring).  Chief Justice Burger filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring 
in the judgment.  Id. at 418-26, 98 S. Ct. at 1139-44 (Burger, C.J., concurring).  Justice Stewart filed a dissenting opinion in 
which Justices White and Rehnquist joined and in which Justice Blackmun joined in all but one portion.  Id. at 426-41, 98 S. Ct. 
at 1143-51 (Stewart, J., dissenting).  Justice Blackmun then filed a separate dissenting opinion.  Id. at 441-43, 98 S. Ct. at 1151-
52 (Blackmun, J., dissenting). "
1469,11," .  In the following cases, the courts have applied the state action exemption to allegedly anticompetitive actions by 
municipalities and other local government entities: Community Communications Co. v. City of Boulder, 630 F.2d 704, 708 (10th 
Cir. 1980), cert. granted, 450 U.S. 1039, 101 S. Ct. 1756, 68 L. Ed. 2d 236 (1981) (state action exemption applies to city 
ordinance placing a three-month moratorium on plaintiff's cable television company from further solicitation of business), but see 
630 F.2d at 709 (Markey, C.J., dissenting); Princeton Community Phone Book, Inc. v. Bate, 582 F.2d 706, 720 (3d Cir. 1978),

employees mandates that the state action exemption apply to the joint activities of the insurance companies)."
1469,12," .  In the following cases, the courts refused to apply the state action exemption to allegedly anticompetitive actions by 
municipalities and other local government entities: Guthrie v. Genesee County, 494 F. Supp. 950, 956 (W.D.N.Y.1980) (state 
action exemption inapplicable to action against county for allegedly anticompetitive conduct in eliminating competition at county 
airport since state statute empowering county to operate airport does not contemplate or require county to displace competition); 
Pinehurst Airlines, Inc. v. Resort Air Services, Inc., 476 F. Supp. 543, 551 (M.D.N.C.1979) (state action exemption inapplicable 
to antitrust suit against county board for allegedly anticompetitive action in operation of airport); Mason City Center Associates v. 
City of Mason City, 468 F. Supp. 737, 743 (N.D.Iowa 1979) (state action exemption inapplicable to allegedly anticompetitive

that city prevent any other shopping center from being constructed); Woolen v. Surtran Taxicabs, Inc., 461 F. Supp. 1025, 1033 
(N.D.Tex.1978) (state action exemption inapplicable to cities' ordinances establishing sole transportation company for ground 
transportation at airport since state statutes authorizing municipalities to establish and operate airports do not contemplate the 
implementation of anticompetitive activities by municipalities in the operation of airports); Cedar-Riverside Associates, Inc. v. 
United States, 459 F. Supp. 1290, 1297-98 (D.Minn.1978), aff'd on other grounds, 606 F.2d 254 (8th Cir. 1979) (state action

(S.D.N.Y.1978) (state maritime authority's action in eliminating competition in shipping not mandated by the state nor pursuant to 
government policy to displace competition and thus state action exemption inapplicable)."
1470,13," .  The Noerr-Pennington doctrine provides antitrust immunity for individuals who make a genuine effort to influence legislation 
and public officials even though the individuals intend to eliminate competition by so doing.  The doctrine is inapplicable under 
the facts of the present case.  See Kurek v. Pleasure Driveway & Park District, 557 F.2d 580, 592-94 (7th Cir. 1977)."
1470,14," .  In so doing, the Kurek court noted that ""of course, we intimate no views whatsoever on the likelihood that plaintiffs will be able 
to prove the allegations of the complaint."" Id. at 586. "
1471,15," .  Kurek was decided prior to City of Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., 435 U.S. 389, 98 S. Ct. 1123, 55 L. Ed. 2d 364 
(1978)."
1471,16," .  As noted by the Seventh Circuit, the United States Supreme Court had granted certiorari in City of Lafayette at the time of the 
Kurek decision."
1471,17," .  Since the parties in Kurek did not present any argument regarding individual antitrust immunity, the Kurek court declined to 
decide this issue.  Id. "
1472,18," .  Similarly, in Whitworth v. Perkins, 559 F.2d 378 (5th Cir. 1977), the plaintiff, owner of a food market, filed suit against a 
municipality, the individual aldermen of the municipality, and three private Texas corporations.  Id. at 379. The plaintiff alleged 
that the defendants enacted a zoning ordinance for the precise purpose of excluding him from the sale of liquor on his property.  
Id.  The district court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment based upon the state action exemption. See id. at 
380. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed.  Id. at 379. In so doing, the court remanded the case to 
the district court for the same analysis that the Fifth Circuit had set forth in City of Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., 532 
F.2d 431, 434 (5th Cir. 1976), which was subsequently affirmed by the United States Supreme Court.  The Fifth Circuit 
concluded that, based upon the pleadings in Whitworth and the law regarding the state action exemption, the court could not 
conclude that, ""at this early stage of the proceedings"", the plaintiff could prove no set of facts in support of his claim for relief.  
559 F.2d at 382, quoting Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S. Ct. 99, 101-102, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957). "
1473,19," .  The defendants also contend that the individual members of the village board are entitled to legislative immunity under 42 
U.S.C. § 1983 (1978). Since the court abstains as to the section 1983 portion of the complaint, the court will not address this 
issue."
1473,20," .  In that counts I and II of the amended complaint do not involve allegedly unconstitutional state action with unsettled questions 
of state law, the court concludes that Pullman abstention would be inappropriate in this case.  Moreover, jurisdiction of federal 
antitrust suits is exclusively in the federal courts.  See 15 U.S.C. §§ 15, 26 (1978); 28 U.S.C. § 1337 (1978)."
1473,21," .  The court reserves on the pending motion to disqualify counsel and the Swansons' motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal 
Rule of Civil Procedure 11. "
1476,*," Honorable M. Joseph Blumenfeld, United States District Judge for the District of Connecticut, sitting by designation."
1476,1," Synergistics, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Copy-Data, was exclusively responsible for wholesale distribution of Toshiba 
copying equipment.  For simplicity, we omit references to Synergistics, referring to the plaintiffs collectively as ""Copy-Data."""
1476,2," The rendition of facts which follows is gleaned from the trial court's findings of fact and conclusions of law.  Because we 
reverse the trial court's judgment on another ground, we express no opinion on TAI's challenges to these findings of fact. "
1477,3," Shortly after this announcement Copy-Data received a letter from Toshiba cautioning Copy-Data not to undertake any great 
expense in training dealers. This letter was drafted originally by a TAI marketing manager but was changed by his superior in a 
manner that the district court found to evidence TAI's intent to restrict Copy-Data's sales to New Jersey.  The relevant portions of 
the original and final drafts are set out below: Original: We would again like to caution you not to enter into any great deal of expense in training dealers on the BD-702.  This is 
especially important in any area outside of the state of New Jersey. Final: We would again like to caution you not to enter into any expenses in training dealers on the BD-702 in the expectation of 
receiving any reimbursement from Toshiba for this training. Because TAI had never reimbursed Copy-Data for expenses of dealer training, the district court found that the alteration of the 
letter was effected to remove the ""antitrust implications"" from the original draft. "
1479,4," HN5[
] Interbrand competition is competition among sellers of various brands of the same generic product-in this case 
copiers. Intrabrand competition is competition among purveyors of the product of a particular manufacturer. See Sylvania, 433 
U.S. at 52 n. 19, 97 S. Ct. at 2558 n. 19. "
1480,5," We need not speculate as to the precise goals of TAI's restrictions on Copy-Data.  Had Copy-Data pursued a rule of reason 
theory, an inquiry into the goals and the effects of the restrictions on both intrabrand and interbrand competition would have 
been appropriate.  See National Soc'y of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 692, 98 S. Ct. 1355, 1365, 55 
L. Ed. 2d 637 (1978); Eiberger v. Sony Corp. of America, 622 F.2d 1068, 1076 (2d Cir. 1980). However, in determining that the 
per se rule does not apply, we need only recognize that the restrictions had sufficient potential to enhance competition, and 
hence should not be ""conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and therefore illegal without elaborate inquiry as to the precise 
harm they have caused or the business excuse for their use(,)"" Northern Pac. Ry. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5, 78 S. Ct. 
514, 518, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1958). See Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 57-59, 97 S. Ct. 2549, 2561-62, 
53 L. Ed. 2d 568 (1977). "
1491,1," Mr. Armstrong relies on cases from other jurisdictions to support his argument.  They are distinguishable: (a) Barrett-Walls, Inc. v. T.V. Venture, Inc., 242 Ga. 816, 251 S.E.2d 558 (1979); T.E. McCutcheon Enterprises, Inc. v. 
Snelling & Snelling, Inc., 232 Ga. 609, 212 S.E.2d 319 (1974); Richard P. Rita Personnel Servs. Int'l, Inc. v. Kot, 229 Ga. 314, 
191 S.E.2d 79 (1972); Ellison v. Labor Pool of America, Inc., 228 Ga. 147, 184 S.E.2d 572 (1971); and Cheese Shop Int'l, Inc. v. 
Wirth, 304 F. Supp. 861 (N.D. Ga. 1969), are all cases applying Georgia law.  Georgia follows the minority rule regarding 
restrictive covenants -- if the covenant is overly broad as to time and area, it is null and void and will not be enforced. (b) Central Specialties Co. v. Schaefer, 318 F. Supp. 855 (N.D. Ill. 1970); Insurance Center, Inc. v. Taylor, 94 Idaho 896, 499 
P.2d 1252 (1972); H & R Block, Inc. v. Lovelace, 208 Kan. 538, 493 P.2d 205, 50 A.L.R.3d 730 (1972); and Pancake Realty Co. 
v. Harber, 137 W. Va. 605, 73 S.E.2d 438 (1952), are all distinguishable on the ground the restrictive covenants in those cases 
contained no geographical limitation. "
1492,2," Most TTI franchises in evidence in this case provide that TTI promises not to establish or cause to be franchised another Taco 
Time restaurant within a certain distance of another franchise. We characterize this area as a ""buffer zone"" or an ""exclusively-
protected area."""
1492,3, We do not decide the enforceability of the covenant in a state or country that has declared noncompetitive provisions void.
1492,4," We note that Mr. Armstrong does not argue damages are adequate and, therefore, TTI should be denied injunctive relief. As 
pointed out by TTI, decisions from other states addressing this question hold damages are inadequate as a matter of law and 
injunctive relief follows as a matter of course.  Miller v. Kendall, 541 P.2d 126, 127 (Colo. Ct. App. 1975); Hartwell's Office World, 
Inc. v. Systex Corp., 598 S.W.2d 636, 639 (Tex. Civ. App. 1980); John G. Bryant Co. v. Sling Testing & Repair, Inc., 471 Pa. 1, 
369 A.2d 1164, 1167 (1977); Schultz v. Ingram, 38 N.C. App. 422, 248 S.E.2d 345 (1978). But see Shakey's Inc. v. Martin, 91 
Idaho 758, 430 P.2d 504, 509 (1967). "
1494,5," Since we reverse on this issue, we need not reach Mr. Armstrong's contention the restriction is an unreasonable restraint on 
alienation. "
1495,*," FORMER FIFTH CIRCUIT CASE, SECTION 9(1) OF PUBLIC LAW 96-452 OCTOBER 14, 1980. "
1498,1," In this case, a judgment of dismissal had been entered at the time of the offered amendment.  Granting the plaintiff's motion, 
therefore, would require the trial court to vacate the judgment.  On the day of the judgment, the plaintiff properly moved the court 
to do so.  See Fed.R.Civ.Pro. 59(e).  Where judgment has been entered on the pleadings, a holding that the trial court should 
have permitted amendment necessarily implies that judgment on the pleadings was inappropriate and that therefore the motion 
to vacate should have been granted.  Thus the disposition of the plaintiff's motion to vacate under rule 59(e) should be governed 
by the same considerations controlling the exercise of discretion under rule 15(a).  Consequently, our discussion of the motion 
under rule 15(a) applies equally to the motion under rule 59(e).  See generally Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 83 S. Ct. 227, 9 L. 
Ed. 2d 222 (1962); 6 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1489 (1971). "
1499,2," At some point, of course, the delay may be so long that the burden of persuasion shifts to the movant. See Gregory v. Mitchell, 
5 Cir. 1981, 634 F.2d 199, 203. Such a shift becomes appropriate, though, only if the delay imposes on the court, requiring it, for 
instance, to try the case on various theories seriatim, or if the delay presents the possibility of serious prejudice to the opponent.  
That is not the case here, as our discussion of prejudice and litigation considerations will show. A shift in the burden is more likely to occur if the trial court has disposed of the case on the merits, as in the case of summary 
judgment or judgment after a full trial.  Then, the concerns of finality in litigation become more compelling, and the litigant has 
had the benefit of a day in court, in some fashion, on the merits of his claim.  See, e. g., id.; Freeman v. Continental Gin, 5 Cir. 
1967, 381 F.2d 459, 469-70; cf.  Griggs v. Hinds Junior College, 5 Cir. 1977, 563 F.2d 179 (per curiam) (granting leave to 
amend is especially appropriate when trial court has dismissed the complaint for failure to state a cause of action).  
Nevertheless, there is no blanket rule that denial of leave to amend after summary judgment is always appropriate.  E. g., 
Sherman v. Hallbauer, 5 Cir. 1972, 455 F.2d 1236. "
1500,3," If there is a res judicata bar, then denial of the motion would result in substantial prejudice to Dussouy.  That prejudice would 
provide a strong basis for granting the motion even if there were countervailing considerations.  When, as here, there are no 
strong countervailing considerations, the potential prejudice would compel us to grant leave to amend. Bamm v. GAF, 5 Cir. 
1981, 651 F.2d 389, 392; Lone Star Motor Import v. Citroen Cars, 5 Cir. 1961, 288 F.2d 69, 76."
1500,4," We do not understand the plaintiff to request leave to amend his complaint to add Gulf Coast's lawyers as parties.  Instead, he 
alleges a conspiracy but sues only one conspirator, which he is free to do.  See 16 Am.Jur.2d, Conspiracy § 66 (1979).  The 
addition of parties would raise questions under rule 15(c), Fed.R.Civ.Pro., as to whether the amendment related back in time to 
the date of the original complaint for purposes of the application of the prescription provisions to the new parties.  We need not, 
nor do we, express any opinion on those questions. "
1501,5," The trial judge considered and granted the motion to dismiss on the day of the pretrial conference.  As a result, no pre-trial 
order was entered in this case, and we need not consider whether, had the trial judge adopted the proposed pre-trial order, 
tortious interference would have remained an issue. "
1502,6," The only case, a very old one, that appeared to recognize a right to interfere maliciously, Orr v. Home Mutual Insurance 
Company, 12 La.Ann. 255 (La. 1857), actually involved the protection of a legitimate interest of the actors, and the opinion has 
been criticized by the Louisiana Supreme Court as ""too broad"".  McGee v. Collins, 156 La. 291, 100 So. 430, 435 (1924). Joslyn v. Manship, 238 So.2d 20 (La.App.1970), writ refused, 256 La. 883, 239 So.2d 541 (1970), does not change our 
conclusions.  There, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants capriciously refused either to recognize them as advertising agents 
or to deal with them.  As a result, a client, who had purchased television time from the defendants through the plaintiffs, ceased 
dealing with the plaintiffs and dealt directly with the defendants.  The court refused to allow recovery on a theory of tortious 
interference with business, stating that there is an absolute right to refuse to deal, even if the motivation is malicious. For several 
reasons, though, we do not think that this case supports Gulf Coast's position.  First, the court in Joslyn proceeded to allow 
recovery on an unjust enrichment theory.  Had it been faced with the prospect of no recovery at all for the plaintiffs, it might have 
held differently on the claim of tortious interference. Second, the court apparently agreed with the principle that there can be 
liability for maliciously influencing third parties but did not perceive the situation as one implicating the problem of influencing 
third parties, for, after recognizing that there is an absolute right maliciously to refuse to deal, the court stated ""one can not 
always, from such motives, influence another person to do the same without incurring legal liability"".  Id. at 24. Finally, even if 
Joslyn did recognize an absolute right maliciously to influence third parties not to deal with another, we would be hesitant to 
recognize the decision of a lower court that the Louisiana Supreme Court refused to consider and that did not explicitly reject 
past Louisiana Supreme Court decisions as superseding those earlier decisions, particularly when those earlier decisions are in 
accord with the majority view, see Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 766B, 767 (1979)."
1502,7," Although Lewis did distinguish the earlier case of Webb v. Drake, 52 La.Ann. 290, 26 So. 791 (1899), because of the absence 
of a conspiracy in Lewis, 46 So. at 686, we do not perceive a requirement of a conspiracy. Lewis also distinguished Webb on the 
ground that the defendant in Webb was not in legitimate competition with the plaintiff, unlike the Lewis situation.  Id. at 687. Also, 
Lewis recognized the Graham case as good authority, see id. at 686-87, and the court there allowed recovery without any 
allegation of conspiracy."
1502,8," The relevant statutory language is provided by La.Rev.Stat.Ann. §§ 51:122, 123, and 137: s 122. Contracts, combinations and conspiracies in restraint of trade illegal; penalty Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce in this state is

1507,1," United States v. Mercedes-Benz of North America, Inc ., No. 79-2144-MHP (N.D. Cal., May 29, 1981) (order denying cross-
motions for summary judgment). "
1508,2," Inasmuch as the Court has determined that collateral estoppel does not apply because of the absence of a final order, it does 
not deem it necessary to address the issue of the application of offensive collateral estoppel in antitrust actions. "
1509,3," In Columbia Nitrogen Corp. v. Royster Co ., 451 F. 2d 3, 15-16 (1971), the Fourth Circuit, citing Perma Life, supra , concluded 
that a party who voluntarily formulates and equally participates in a non-coercive agreement restraining trade cannot maintain a 
Section 1, Sherman Act action against its trading partner.  In Lanier Business Products v. Graymar , 355 F. Supp. 525 (D. Md. 
1973), the district court, in interpreting Perma Life , read the decision as restricting application of the in pari delicto defense to 
the issue of damages.  That is to say, although the defense could not be used by a defendant to absolve his legal liability, the 
defendant could raise the defense in connection with plaintiff's damage claim in order to preclude the plaintiff from recovering 
such amounts as are attributable to his own wrongful conduct. "
1516,*," The Honorable Charles H. Tenney of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by 
designation."
1516,1," Our affirmance of the preliminary injunction on antitrust grounds means that the tender offer can be renewed only if LTV 
prevails upon a trial on the merits.  In that event, it seems reasonable to predict that the Offer to Purchase will be revised, 
diminishing if not eliminating the likelihood of Williams Act challenges of the sort preliminarily upheld by Judge Mishler. "
1519,2," Judge Mishler accepted Grumman's $ 98 million 1981 share and $ 480 million 1984 share of the combined major subassembly 
and nacelle markets from the affidavit of Randolph J. Sablich, director of subcontract business operations for Grumman's 
aerospace subsidiary.  That affidavit attributed $ 35 million of the 1981 total and $ 182 million of the 1984 total to major 
subassemblies. Judge Mishler accepted the total market estimates of $ 1 billion for 1981 and $ 1.5 billion for 1984 from the 
affidavit of R. Dixon Speas, president of Aviation Consulting, Inc.  That affidavit appears to reach those figures by estimating the 
major subassembly market to be $ 700 million in 1981 and $ 1 billion in 1984, and the nacelle market to be $ 300 million in 1981 
and $ 500 million in 1984."
1519,3, The 21% share may be slightly overstated by whatever extent the $ 214 million of sales may include sales of nacelles. 
1521,4," In this respect the inquiry as to injury in a suit under § 16 is not as narrowly focused as in a suit for damages under § 4, 15 
U.S.C. § 15 (1976), where concerns about avoiding multiple recoveries and windfalls to remote parties have resulted in strict 
standing rules to implement § 4's limitation of recovery to any person injured in his business or property.  See II P. Areeda & D. 
Turner, Antitrust Law P 328 (1978).  ""Section HN9[
] 16 should be construed and applied with this purpose (enforcing the 
antitrust laws) in mind, and with the knowledge that the remedy it affords, like other equitable remedies, is flexible and capable of 
nice ""adjustment and reconciliation between the public interest and private needs as well as between competing private claims.' 
Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U.S. 321, 329-330, 64 S. Ct. 587, 591-592, 88 L. Ed. 754 (1944). Its availability should be ""conditioned 
by the necessities of the public interest which Congress has sought to protect."" Id., at 330, 64 S. Ct. at 592. Zenith Radio Corp. 
v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U.S. 100, 131, 89 S. Ct. 1562, 1580, 23 L. Ed. 2d 129 (1969). "
1532,1," .  The writs of mandamus and prohibition are both extraordinary remedies which have traditionally been used in federal courts to 
confine inferior courts to the lawful exercise of their jurisdiction or to compel them to exercise their authority when it is their duty 
to do so.  In re Halkin, 194 U.S. App. D.C. 257, 598 F.2d 176, 179 (D.C.Cir.1979). They differ primarily in their focus.  While 
mandamus is positive in the sense that it is used to compel certain actions, prohibition is negative in that it is used to prevent 
such actions.  In many cases, such as this one, the relief sought by the petitioner may be stated either positively or negatively 
and, thus, either writ may be used.  Despite this fact, we shall for convenience hereinafter refer to the instant petition as one for 
mandamus alone."
1532,2," .  At the time Dr. Tambone's requests to produce were served on the Hospital, the pertinent provisions of the Illinois Medical 
Studies Act read as follows: HN2[
] s 1. All information, interviews, reports, statements, memoranda or other data of the Illinois Department of Public 
Health, Illinois State Medical Society, allied medical societies, physician-owned inter-insurance exchanges and their agents, or 
committees of accredited hospitals or their medical staffs, including Patient Care Audit Committees, Medical Care Evaluation 
Committees, Utilization Review Committees, Credential Committees and Executive Committees, but not the original medical 
records pertaining to the patient, used in the course of internal quality control or of medical study for the purpose of reducing 
morbidity or mortality, or for improving patient care, shall be strictly confidential and shall be used only for medical research, the 
evaluation and improvement of quality care, or granting, limiting or revoking staff privileges, except in any hospital proceeding to 
decide upon a physician's staff privileges, or in any judicial review thereof, the claim of confidentiality shall not be invoked to 
deny such physician access to or use of data upon which such a decision was based. "
1533,," s 2. Such information, records, reports, statements, notes, memoranda, or other data shall not be admissible as evidence in any 
action of any kind in any court or before any tribunal, board, agency or person. s 5. The disclosure of any information, records, reports, statements, notes, memoranda or other data obtained in any such 
medical study except that necessary for the purpose of the specific study is unlawful, and any person convicted of violating any 
of the provisions of this Act is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor."
1533,3," .  Although the complaint states a pendent state claim to which the information sought would also be relevant, this fact does not 
require a different result.  As the court stated in Perrignon v. Bergen Brunswig Corp., 77 F.R.D. 455 (N.D.Cal.1978), it would be 
meaningless to hold the communication privileged for one set of claims and not the other.  See also Robinson v. Magovern, 83 
F.R.D. 79, 84 (W.D.Pa.1979), in which the court held under facts almost identical to those present here, that HN6[
] federal law 
controlled on the question of privilege in a federal antitrust action, notwithstanding the presence of a pendent state claim. "
1535,4," .  Of course, it is not enough for Dr. Tambone to show that he was discriminated against.  To prove his Sherman Act claim he 
must also demonstrate that this discriminatory denial of staff privileges was in furtherance of the defendants' unlawful conspiracy 
to restrain trade."
1535,5," .  As Judge Shadur points out in his response to the Hospital's petition, the plaintiff's ""failure to adduce such evidence of 
discriminatory exclusionary treatment was held fatal to a Sherman Act claim"" in Deesen v. PGA, 358 F.2d 165 (9th Cir. 1966). 
(Response, p. 4.)"
1535,6," .  While not dispositive, it should also be noted that the cost of disclosure to the policy behind the Medical Studies Act is not 
substantial under the facts of this case.  Judge Shadur has indicated that the limited disclosure required for discovery will be 
made under a protective order which he has invited the Hospital to draft.  Such an order could provide for an in camera review of 
the requested material by the trial court to determine if it is relevant to Dr. Tambone's claim.  In Kerr v. United States District 
Court, 426 U.S. 394, 405, 96 S. Ct. 2119, 2125, 48 L. Ed. 2d 725 (1976), the Supreme Court stated in denying a petition for 
mandamus under similar circumstances that this procedure is a relatively costless and eminently worthwhile method to insure that the balance between the petitioners' claims of irrelevance 
and privilege and plaintiffs' asserted need for the documents is correctly struck.  Indeed, this court has long held the view that in "
1536,," camera review is a highly appropriate and useful means of dealing with claims of governmental privilege.  E. g., United States v. 
Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 706, 94 S. Ct. 3090, 3106, 41 L. Ed. 2d 1039 (1974); United States v. Reynolds, 345 U.S. 1, 73 S. Ct. 528, 
97 L. Ed. 727 (1953). "
1544,1," .  The New York apple defendants are Altamont Farms, Inc., William Paladino, Sr., Merritt Hart, S & A Chaisson & Sons, Inc., 
Leland J. Behnke, Elizaville Fruit & Freezer, Inc., Charles Ferrone, A. Goode & Son, Adriane F. Goode, Michael Nadone, 
Stanely Orchards, Inc., Stanley Cohn, Lester Cohn, Mid-Hudson Growers Co-Op, Inc., Charles Andola, Valley Growers Co-Op, 
Inc., Ashton Hart, Patrick Russo, Joseph Russo, and the Farm Labor Executive Committee."
1544,2," .  The Florida sugar defendants are the Florida Fruit & Vegetable Association, George Sorn, the Florida Sugar Producers 
Association, and Earl Morrison. "
1545,3," .  According to 8 U.S.C. § 1184(c), ""(t)he question of importing any alien as a nonimmigrant under section 1101(a)(15)(H) or (L) 
of this title in any specific case or specific cases shall be determined by the Attorney General, after consultation with appropriate 
agencies of the Government, upon petition of the importing employer…."" The Attorney General has delegated authority in this 
area to the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization, who has in turn delegated responsibility to the Secretary of Labor.  
8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h) (3). "
1546,4," .  Plaintiffs advance claims under § 1 and § 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1, 2, and § 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15. 
Plaintiffs' § 1 claim alone states a claim upon which relief can be granted.  Plaintiffs' claim that defendants conspired to 
monopolize the New York apple harvest job market in violation of § 2 of the Sherman Act is insufficient since plaintiffs have 
failed to allege that the New York apple defendants possess monopoly power in any relevant market.  Monopoly power means 
power to control prices or exclude competition in a relevant market.  To prevail on their § 2 claim, plaintiffs must show that the 
New York apple defendants wilfully acquired or maintained monopoly power in the relevant market.  United States v. Grinnell 
Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 570-71, 86 S. Ct. 1698, 1703-04, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778 (1966); Broadway Delivery Corp. v. United Parcel Serv., 
651 F.2d 122, 126-27 (2d Cir. 1981). Plaintiffs have not alleged what proportion of any relevant employer market is controlled by 
the New York apple defendants, or how defendants have either excluded competitors or controlled the job offers of other 
employers.  The § 2 claim must therefore be dismissed.  Plaintiffs' ""claim"" under § 4 of the Clayton Act is also deficient since that 
section merely authorizes recovery of treble damages for violations of other provisions of the antitrust laws and cannot serve 
independently as the basis of a claim for relief.  The following discussion will explore the adequacy of plaintiffs' claim under § 1."
1546,5, .  The legislative history is silent on the subject of antitrust immunity and therefore of no help to defendants. 
1547,6," .  Plaintiffs allege that the piece rates were below market rates, Compl. P 93, and that the New York apple defendants' 
insistence upon the piece rate instead of an hourly rate rendered the adverse effect rate meaningless.  Compl. P 94.  The 
regulations promulgated under the Wagner-Peyser Act, however, recognize that employers may pay workers at piece rates 
rather than hourly rates and specifically provide that the piece rates must be equivalent to the hourly or adverse effect rates.  20 
C.F.R. § 655.202(b)(9)(ii).  Plaintiffs never allege that the piece rates paid by the New York apple defendants were below the 
adverse effect rates; rather, plaintiffs merely allege that the piece rates were below market rates and that defendants' insistence 
upon piece rates rendered the adverse effect rate meaningless."
1547,7," .  Although the finding of immunity disposes of the matter, the court notes an additional flaw in plaintiffs' claim with respect to 
wages. Plaintiffs contend that since the regulations promulgated under the Wagner-Peyser Act merely set minima, see Flecha v. 
Quiros, 567 F.2d 1154, 1156 (1st Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 436 U.S. 945, 98 S. Ct. 2846, 56 L. Ed. 2d 786 (1978), a conspiracy 
to offer domestic workers only those statutory minima may be an unlawful conspiracy in restraint of trade.  The adverse effect 
rate, however, is intended to reflect the market rate for the services of similarly employed domestic workers unless the use or 
nonuse of foreign workers has depressed the prevailing rate.  Plaintiffs therefore advance the novel claim that the New York 
apple defendants have restrained trade by conspiring to offer plaintiffs the market rate for their services.  The adverse effect 
rate, moreover, is designed to reflect the prevailing rate only for the domestic labor market and to exclude the effect of the 
foreign labor market.  By offering the statutory minimum, the New York apple defendants have therefore offered more than the 
actual market rate for the services of domestic and foreign migrant farm workers. "
1548,8," .  The original complaint in this action has been once amended.  References in this opinion to the complaint refer to the 
amended complaint (formally designated by plaintiffs as the ""First Amended Complaint""). "
1549,9," .  Plaintiffs' brief in opposition to defendants' motion to dismiss sets forth two arguments against dismissal.  First, plaintiffs argue 
that there is a § 1981 cause of action for discrimination against citizens.  The cases cited by plaintiffs, however, see, e.g., 
Takahashi v. Fish & Game Comm., 334 U.S. 410, 419-20, 68 S. Ct. 1138, 1142-43, 92 L. Ed. 1478 (1948); Guerra v. 
Manchester Terminal Corp., 498 F.2d 641, 653-54 (5th Cir. 1974); Spiess v. C. Itoh & Co. (America), 408 F. Supp. 916 
(S.D.Tex.1976), establish merely that aliens are protected by discrimination unlawful under § 1981 and not that § 1981 permits a 
cause of action for discrimination on the basis of alienage.  Second, plaintiffs assert that they are Puerto Ricans and blacks and 
therefore may maintain an action under § 1981.  As stated in the text, however, the basis of the discrimination alleged in the 
complaint is citizenship, not race, and the plaintiff class is not limited to Puerto Ricans and blacks.  Moreover, where the 
allegedly preferred group is black Jamaicans, assertions of racial discrimination against a class of Puerto Rican and black 
domestic workers are suspect. "
1551,10," .  The nine plaintiffs are Marvin Jenkins, Leroy Johnson, Walter Myles, Theodore Young, James Luellen, John McDonald, 
Lovette Belcher, Clarence Calloway, and Angin McNatt."
1551,11," .  Defendants in those actions included New York apple defendants S & A Chaisson & Sons, Inc., Valley Growers Co-op, Inc., 
Ashton Hart, Michael Nardone, Mid-Hudson Growers Co-op, Inc., Charles Andola and Stanley Orchards, Inc."
1551,12," .  The 17 plaintiffs are Juan Valderrama Rios, Pablo Cepeda Quinones, Juan Nunez Aquino, Roberto Santiago Gomez, 
Federico Albert Colon, Felix Davila Fuentes, Ricardo Navarro Rivera, Silvia Esther Resto Jaime, Angel Luis Gracia Resto, 
Daniel Figueroa Ramos, Jose Daniel Figueroa Sandoval, Monserrate Rivera, Edwin Amezquita Rivera, Justo Medina Velez, 
Gilberto Medina Miranda, Jesusa Vazquez and Armando Robles Vazques. "
1553,13," .  Annually during the years in question, at least 1,000 Jamaican workers recruited by the Florida sugar defendants worked in 
the New York apple harvest under the standard employment contracts negotiated in part by the Florida sugar defendants.  See 
note 14 infra."
1553,14," .  Plaintiffs claim that there are 2,000 Jamaican workers employed in the annual New York apple harvest labor force.  The 
numbers set forth in the text are taken from the affidavits of Florida sugar defendants Sorn and Morrison.  The court makes no 
finding at this stage of the proceedings whether 1,000 or 2,000 Jamaicans were annually employed in the New York apple 
harvest during the years in question."
1553,15," .  Plaintiffs simultaneously allege that foreign workers have been afforded preferential treatment during the apple harvests, 
Compl. PP 100, 101, 104, and that plaintiffs have been adversely affected by the oppressive conditions imposed upon those 
foreign workers certified for employment.  Compl. PP 105, 121, 122. "
1554,16," .  Where antitrust and constitutional violations are alleged, defendants' acts are properly analyzed as tortious acts for the 
purpose of assessing personal jurisdiction.  Clark v. United States, 481 F. Supp. 1086, 1097 n.12 (S.D.N.Y.1979), appeal 
dismissed, 624 F.2d 3 (2d Cir. 1980) (constitutional claims); McCrory Corp. v. Cloth World, Inc., 378 F. Supp. 322, 324-25 
(S.D.N.Y.1974) (antitrust claims)."
1554,17," .  The Florida sugar defendants cannot be sued in New York under a co-conspirator theory as agents or principals of the New 
York apple defendants who committed alleged tortious acts within the state.  Although plaintiffs' allegations of conspiracy may be 
sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim for relief, the allegations alone are insufficient to establish a 
conspiracy for jurisdictional purposes.  Lehigh Valley Indus., Inc. v. Birenbaum, 527 F.2d 87, 93-94 (2d Cir. 1975); Clark v. 
United States, supra, 481 F. Supp. at 1096-97. "
1555,18," .  In light of the court's findings that New York consequences were foreseeable and that the Florida sugar defendants derived 
substantial revenue from international commerce, the court is also satisfied that the exercise of jurisdiction will not offend "" 
""traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.' "" International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316, 66 S. Ct. 154, 
158, 90 L. Ed. 95 (1945), quoting Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U.S. 457, 463, 61 S. Ct. 339, 342, 85 L. Ed. 278 (1940); see World-
Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 297, 100 S. Ct. 559, 567, 62 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1980)."
1555,19," .  Section 1391(b) applies to antitrust actions, Iranian Shipping Lines, S.A. v. Moraites, 377 F. Supp. 644, 647 (S.D.N.Y.1974) 
(Gurfein, D.J.), as well as to civil rights actions.  Jimenez v. Pierce, 315 F. Supp. 365, 365-66 (S.D.N.Y.1970)."
1555,20, .  See note 15 supra. 
1557,21, .  See notes 16-18 & accompanying text supra. 
1558,22," .  Although unnecessary in view of the court's finding of foreign sovereign immunity as to BWICLO and as to Edwards acting in 
his official capacity, the court briefly considers the two defendants' additional arguments for dismissal of plaintiffs' claims against 
them. First, the act of state doctrine is inapplicable to BWICLO's alleged conduct in connection with this lawsuit.  Although BWICLO's 
acts were not commercial in character, neither were they pursuant to a particular, formal edict or resolution and ""(in) order to 
trigger application of the act of state doctrine, the government act concerned must be a public one such as a legislative 
enactment, regulatory decree, or executive use of the police powers."" Dominicus Americana Bohio v. Gulf & Western Indus., 
Inc., 473 F. Supp. 680, 689 (S.D.N.Y.1979); cf.  Empresa Cubana Exportadora, Inc. v. Lamborn & Co., 652 F.2d 231, 237 (2d 
Cir. 1981) (""The seizure of (the) offices and accounts was a classic act of state.  It was carried out pursuant to a formal 
resolution issued by the Ministry of Labor, who was acting on behalf of the undisputedly sovereign Cuban government.""). Second, the defendants' motions to dismiss plaintiffs' antitrust and civil rights claims for failure to state claims for relief is also 
granted to the same extent as were the motions of the other defendants on identical grounds.  Third, as to plaintiffs' remaining 
claims, beyond the question of foreign sovereign immunity, plaintiffs' antitrust claims against BWICLO and Edwards must be "
1559,," dismissed since foreign states are not ""persons"" subject to Sherman Act liability, Hunt v. Mobil Oil Corp., 550 F.2d 68, 78 n.14 
(2d Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 984, 98 S. Ct. 608, 54 L. Ed. 2d 477 (1977); International Ass'n of Machinists v. OPEC, supra, 
477 F. Supp. at 570-72; cf.  Pfizer, Inc. v. Government of India, 434 U.S. 308, 98 S. Ct. 584, 54 L. Ed. 2d 563 (1978) (foreign 
sovereign may be a plaintiff in an antitrust action), and plaintiffs' surviving civil rights claim must also be dismissed since there is 
no reason to distinguish foreign states from either the United States or individual states, neither of which are ""persons"" liable 
under the civil rights laws.  See Quern v. Jordan, 440 U.S. 332, 99 S. Ct. 1139, 59 L. Ed. 2d 358 (1979) (states not ""persons"" 
under § 1983); Thompson v. State of New York, 487 F. Supp. 212, 228 (N.D.N.Y.1979) (states not ""persons"" under § 1985(3)); 
Morpurgo v. Board of Higher Educ., 423 F. Supp. 704, 714 (S.D.N.Y.1976) (United States not a ""person"" under civil rights laws); 
see also District of Columbia v. Carter, 409 U.S. 418, 429-30, 93 S. Ct. 602, 608-09, 34 L. Ed. 2d 613 (1973); Dellums v. Powell, 
184 U.S. App. D.C. 324, 566 F.2d 216, 224 (D.C.Cir.1977), cert. denied, 438 U.S. 916, 98 S. Ct. 3146, 57 L. Ed. 2d 1161, 98 S. 
Ct. 3147 (1978) (District of Columbia not a ""person"" under § 1983)."
1559,23," .  In their memorandum in opposition to Orr's motion to dismiss, plaintiffs assert that they are also claiming that Orr violated his 
duty to insure that migrant workers from Florida were afforded proper treatment during the New York apple harvest. The 
complaint, however, states no such claim against defendant Orr, and even if it did the claim would fail since the labor-supply 
state has no duty to monitor or improve employment conditions in the destination or demand state.  Vazquez v. Ferre, 404 F. 
Supp. 815, 821 (D.N.J.1975). "
1571,*," Honorable Harry E. Claiborne, Chief Judge, United States District Judge for the District of Nevada, sitting by designation."
1571,1," Many courts have addressed the question; the Second, Third, Fifth, and Eighth Circuits have refused to accord immunity under 
similar circumstances. See Northeastern Tel. Co. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 651 F.2d 76 (2d Cir. 1981); Sound, Inc. v. 
American Tel. & Tel. Co., 631 F.2d 1324 (8th Cir. 1980); Essential Communications Sys., Inc. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 610 "
1572,," F.2d 1114 (3d Cir. 1979); Litton Sys., Inc. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 487 F. Supp. 942 (S.D.N.Y. 1980); Monitor Business 
Machs., Inc. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 1978-1 Trade Cas. (CCH) P62,030 (C.D. Cal. 1978); Jarvis, Inc. v. American Tel. & Tel. 
Co., 481 F. Supp. 120 (D.D.C. 1978); Interconnect Planning v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 465 F. Supp. 811 (S.D.N.Y. 1978); 
Macom Prods. Corp. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 359 F. Supp. 973 (C.D. Cal. 1973). In addition, the District Court for the District 
of Columbia has twice found no blanket immunity in a civil suit by the United States Government that concerned in part terminal 
equipment.  United States v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 461 F. Supp. 1314 (D.D.C. 1978); United States v. American Tel. & Tel. 
Co., 427 F. Supp. 57 (D.D.C. 1976). Several courts have addressed the analogous problem in the areas of private longlines 
communications and interconnection with local telephone companies, generally finding no implied immunity. See, e.g., Mid-
Texas Communications Sys., Inc. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 615 F.2d 1372 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 912, 101 S. Ct. 
286, 66 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1980); MCI Communications Corp. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 462 F. Supp. 1072 (N.D. Ill. 1978). One 
court of appeals has addressed the immunity issue in the fairly specialized field of radio/telephone paging systems, and found 
such immunity on the basis of the state action exemption. Mobilfone v. Commonwealth Tel. Co., 571 F.2d 141 (3rd Cir. 1978). 
The general problem has attracted some attention in the literature. See Note, The Application of Antitrust Law to 
Telecommunications, 69 Calif. L. Rev. 497 (1981); Note, Antitrust and Regulated Industries: A Critique and Proposal for Reform 
of the Implied Immunity Doctrine, 57 Tex. L. Rev. 751 (1979); Note, AT&T and the Antitrust Laws: A Strict Test for Implied 
Immunity, 85 Yale L.J. 254 (1975)."
1572,2," In view of the actions taken by the FCC and the CPUC, DASA's request for equitable relief is moot."
1572,3," Specifically, the complaint alleges, without limitation, the following acts on the part of the defendants:"
1572,1," . The knowing filing of anticompetitive and unlawful tariffs prohibiting any interconnection of non-telephone company 
equipment;"
1572,2," . Replacement of those tariffs, following a determination of their illegality, with new, purposefully anticompetitive tariffs 
requiring (a) the installation of unnecessary protective couplers actually designed to prevent the Divert-A-Call from working

interconnection in order to prolong their unfair competitive advantage. These acts, DASA contends, harmed competition, telephone users, and itself."
1573,4," In the event that the defendants and co-conspirators did not have monopoly power in the relevant market, DASA claims that (1) 
there was a dangerous possibility that a monopoly would be established; (2) the defendants and co-conspirators specifically 
intended to create such a monopoly; (3) the previously detailed acts were in furtherance of an attempt and conspiracy to 
monopolize; and (4) that attempt should be enjoined and damages should be awarded to DASA. Finally, DASA charges the 
defendants and co-conspirators with wrongful interference with DASA's contractual relations with its customers."
1573,5," The complaint does not detail misconduct by Western Electric and Bell Telephone Laboratories, the manufacturing and 
research arms of AT&T. The complaint, in that it alleges an overly protective tariff and delay and error in the design of protective 
couplers, however, implies misconduct by the AT&T subsidiaries."
1573,6," Phonetele charges that AT&T and the operating companies have misinterpreted the tariffs so as to apply to the Phonemaster 
while knowing that the Phonemaster is not covered by the tariffs, or, even if the Phonemaster is covered, knowing that the 
Phonemaster requires nothing more for connection than a simple terminal block. Phonetele, although objecting to the poor 
quality of the PCA made available in California and to the fees associated with that coupler, also complains of AT&T's delay in 
making a similar protective coupler available in other parts of the United States. When a similar coupler finally was made 
available outside of California, Phonetele charges that it was three and one-half times as expensive as the already too 
expensive California coupling arrangement. Phonetele claims that the imposition of protective coupling arrangements has 
caused unnecessary design and installation problems and attendant delays and has caused either Phonetele or Phonetele's 
customers to bear unnecessary costs. In sum, Phonetele claims that AT&T and the operating companies have used their monopoly position to ensure that their own 
customers shall use only telephone company equipment."

connection with intrastate communication service by wire or radio of any carrier . . . ."" 47 U.S.C. § 152(b) (1976). That section

not controlling it or controlled by it. Id."
1575,14," In the present case, for example, the CPUC regulates General. Yet because terminal equipment generally has the potential to 
be used in interstate telephone connections, any restriction on its connection contained in the tariffs filed by AT&T would also 
apply to terminal equipment of intrastate carriers. See Telerent Leasing Corp., 45 F.C.C.2d 204, 216 n.21 (1974). Until recently, 
however, there appeared to be no reason why a state could not apply more restrictive regulations for the interconnection of 
customer-provided terminal equipment."
1575,15," In 1956 AT&T's blanket prohibition against connecting any equipment was struck down as a violation of the FCA. Hush-A-
Phone Corp. v. United States, 238 F.2d 266, 99 U.S. App. D.C. 190 (D.C. Cir. 1956), after remand, 22 F.C.C. 112 (1957). The 
""Hush-A-Phone"" was a cup-shaped device which attached to the mouthpiece of the handset to provide privacy for the speaker 
and quiet for others near the phone. There was no electrical connection between the telephone and the Hush-a-Phone. AT&T 
responded to this decision by filing a tariff which prohibited all ""direct electrical connection"" and interconnection by any means of 
customer-provided equipment. See Carterfone, 13 F.C.C.2d at 437-38."
1575,16," Many state public utilities commissions apparently felt that the telephone company must maintain end-to-end responsibility to 
preserve the integrity and reliability of the telephone network. For example, when some telephone companies permitted users to 
provide their own equipment, some state regulatory agencies ordered the carriers to purchase that equipment from the 
customers, thus highlighting the carrier's responsibility for maintaining the system. See, e.g., Bluffs & Winchester Tel. Co., 
P.U.R. 1915 A. 928 (Ill. Pub. Util. Comm'n 1915); Franksville Tel. Co., P.U.R. 1917 A. 270 (Wis. R.R. Comm'n 1916); Littlepage

1576,17," The plaintiff in that action manufactured a device known as the ""Carterfone."" The Carterfone connected acoustically and 
inductively (as opposed to electrically) to the telephone and permitted the caller to connect his telephone to a two-way radio.  
Carter, 365 F.2d at 490."
1576,18," See note 38/, infra."
1576,19," ""Network control signals"" are electronic impulses which activate connections between telephone centers, control switches, and 
start and stop the equipment used for billing. Devices that generate or activate network control signals are a category of terminal 
equipment known as ""network control signaling units"" (NCSUs). According to the defendants, plaintiffs' devices are network 
control signaling units and have the potential to disrupt system operations and message accounting if not properly 
manufactured, installed and maintained. See also notes 20/ & 38/, infra (discussing legal significance of NCSU/non-NCSU 
distinction."
1576,20," We must emphasize that our interpretation of this statement by the Commission supports our holding. The post-Carterfone 
tariff was not ""in conflict"" with Carterfone in the sense that Carterfone did not deal specifically with customer replacement of 
terminal equipment, and the Commission had not been, in 1968, in a position to say whether the suggested possibility of greater 
danger from NCSUs was so substantial or unpredictable as to permit a blanket prohibition by AT&T. See notes 21/, 38/, & 43/, 
infra (discussing Carterfone and subsequent interpretations of decision)."
1576,21,"  In our opinion, these and other matters warrant further consideration by the Commission before it determines whether and 
what further action, if any, may be required. We believe that we will be in a better position to make these determinations 
after we have had a reasonable opportunity to closely observe the effects of the substantial changes now being effectuated 
by the telephone companies in their interconnection tariffs, the extent to which such changes satisfy reasonable "
1577,," requirements of their subscribers for . . . communication services or facilities, and the implementation by the telephone 
companies of their representations that they are actively engaged in devising equipment and operating procedures to meet 
the expressed needs of customers for flexible access to the switched network. Thus, we will permit the tariff revisions to 
become effective as scheduled with the understanding that in doing so we are not giving any specific approval to the 
revised tariffs. AT&T ""Foreign Attachment"" Tariff Revisions, 15 F.C.C.2d at 610 (emphasis added). The Commission took this stance because it was then ""in no position to determine the extent to which"" interconnection of 
customer-provided equipment could properly be permitted ""consistent with efficient and economic telephone service."" Id. See 
also AT&T ""Foreign Attachment"" Tariff Revisions, 18 F.C.C.2d 871, 873 (1969) (denying petitions for reconsideration); Western 
States Tel. Co., 19 F.C.C.2d 1068, 1072-73 (1969). It, did however, indicate that AT&T could consider the safety of the 
telephone network in formulating the new tariff. Carterfone, 14 F.C.C.2d at 572-573 (denying petitions for reconsideration)."
1577,22," The FCC commissioned a study by the National Academy of Sciences and gathered information from other sources. In June, 
1972, the FCC began formal proceedings to determine whether the post-Carterfone tariffs should be revised. Many users, 
equipment suppliers, and carriers participated in the hearings. The agency created a federal-state joint board to investigate 
interconnection practices. At about the same time, many state utilities commissions undertook independent investigations of the 
same issues. The potential for conflicting regulatory schemes led the FCC in 1974 to assert ""paramount"" or ""primary"" jurisdiction 
over the terms and conditions governing the interconnection of all equipment used in interstate communications.  Telerent 
Leasing Corp., 45 F.C.C.2d 204 (1974), aff'd sub nom. North Carolina Util. Comm'n v. FCC, 537 F.2d 787 (4th Cir.), cert. denied,

purchase and supply the device itself."
1577,25," DASA's predecessor in interest, Com-U-Trol, filed an action before the CPUC in February, 1972, to compel General 
Telephone to allow interconnection of the Divert-A-Call. Although the CPUC ordered that General ""shall permit the direct 
electrical connection of Divert-A-Calls to the telephone network subject to the condition that complainant shall provide 
reasonable assurances that quality control, installation, and repair procedures . . . necessary for the preservation of network 
integrity and safety will be uniformly followed,"" Interim Decision No. 80972, Com-U-Trol and General were unable to come to

1578,30," See Notes, supra note 1/. "
1579,31," For example, the immunity analysis in securities cases, and the deference of the Court to any administrative action or conduct 
claimed to be ""necessary to make the securities laws work,"" must be understood with reference to the grave historical crises 
caused by the absence of regulation in those industries. The Court has been exceptionally reluctant to allow via the antitrust 
laws any tampering with the regulatory framework that might threaten the recurrence of similar harm to investors. See NASD, 
422 U.S. at 705-11; Gordon, 422 U.S. at 681-82; Jacobi v. Bache & Co., 520 F.2d 1231, 1234 (2d Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 423 
U.S. 1053, 96 S. Ct. 784, 46 L. Ed. 2d 642 (1976). In contrast, potential harms to the public by accomodating regulation to the 
policy of the antitrust laws in other industries, such as the telephone interconnection industry, has not been well demonstrated. 
See TAN 32/-33/, pp. 11-12, & note 33/, infra."
1579,32," The plaintiffs in Gordon challenged primarily the practice of the securities exchanges and their members of using fixed rates of 
commission for certain kinds of sales.  422 U.S. at 661. The Court held that the challenged practices of the exchanges and their 
members were immune from antitrust attack. Gordon does not hold that whenever a federal agency has the authority to approve 
or prohibit conduct by a regulated entity and is engaged in detailed study of particular conduct, that conduct which occurs during 
the period of agency study may not be the basis for an antitrust action. Such a situation, without more, does not establish a plain 
repugnancy between the regulatory scheme and the antitrust laws. Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States, 410 U.S. 366, 93 S. 
Ct. 1022, 35 L. Ed. 2d 359 (1973), is precisely contrary and controlling on this issue. See also note 31/, supra (special 
characteristics of self-regulating securities industry); TAN 32/-33/, pp. 11-12, & note 33/, infra (same). It is critical here that the pre-Carterfone version of Tariff 263 was initiated by the carrier and not the FCC. If the original practice 
being studied by the agency was not undertaken by the regulated entity to comply with a directive of the agency, and there is no 
evidence that Congress was either aware of the particular anticompetitive practice or gave the agency specific power to 
authorize it, we fail to see the relevance of agency study to immunity for anticompetitive injury suffered during the period of 
agency review. See also note 38/ infra (discussing significance of Carterfone.)"
1579,33," See Silver v. New York Stock Exch., 373 U.S. 341, 349-57, 83 S. Ct. 1246, 10 L. Ed. 2d 389 (1963); Gordon, 422 U.S. at 660-
82; NASD, 422 U.S. at 720-30. Justice Stewart concisely described this unusual facet of the securities industry: The purpose of the self-regulation provisions of the Securities Exchange Act was to delegate governmental power to 
working institutions which would undertake, at their own initiative, to enforce compliance with ethical as well as legal "
1580,," standards in a complex and changing industry. This self-initiating process of regulation can work effectively only if the 
process itself is allowed to operate free from a constant threat of antitrust penalties. Silver, 373 U.S. at 371 (Stewart, J., dissenting). See also Note, supra note 1, 69 Calif. L. Rev. at 513-14."
1580,34," The Court held the vertical restraints immune because of section 22(f) of the Investment Company Act, 15 U.S.C. § 80a-22(f) 
(1976), which prohibited restrictions on the transfer of mutual fund shares except as specified in the registration statement, but in 
any event not ""in contravention of such rules and regulations as the [SEC] may prescribe"" in the public interest. At the time the 
lawsuit was begun, the SEC had never exercised its authority under this section to promulgate rules governing transfer of mutual 
funds shares, although during the lawsuit the SEC indicated it planned to exercise its regulatory authority.  422 U.S. at 718-19 
n.31. The Court reasoned: The agreements challenged in counts II-VIII are among the kinds of restrictions Congress contemplated when it enacted 
that section. And this conclusion necessarily leads to a determination that they are immune from liability under the Sherman 
Act, for we see no way to reconcile the Commission's power to authorize these restrictions with the competing mandate of 
the antitrust laws."
1580,422, U.S. at 721-22.
1580,35," The Court noted that the theory of the Government's section 1 charge in count 1 of the complaint was imprecise and obscure.  
422 U.S. at 730-31. Originally the complaint seemed to attack the establishment and maintenance of the rules and the rules 
themselves, id. at 730-31 n.42; later the focus shifted to the way the defendants enforced and interpreted the rules. In any event, 
the practices attacked were a logical corollary to some degree of a system of rules designed to prevent a secondary market, and "
1581,," this ultimate goal the Court found clearly sanctioned by the Congress. There is in the case before us no analogous sanction for 
clearly anticompetitive behavior or for practices in aid of thereof. The activities in NASD were not required or specifically authorized by any particular securities statute, but rather by an 
integrated scheme of self regulation overseen by the SEC. The issue presented was thus ""whether the SEC's exercise of 
regulatory authority under [the Investment Company Act] and the Maloney Act is sufficiently pervasive to confer an implied 
immunity."" Id. at 730. The Court noted that under the Maloney Act the SEC must disapprove an Association rule or change in a 
rule unless it is consistent with the regulatory policies of the Act, id. at 732, and that the SEC is authorized to require changes in 
the Association rules. For 35 years the SEC had, in the Court's view, approved the vertical restraints challenged in counts II-VIII. 
The SEC's authority to regulate the defendants' interpretation and application of these restrictive rules was just as broad as its 
authority over the initial promulgation of the rules. The Court reasoned: ""We can see no meaningful distinction between the 
Association's rules and the manner in which it construes and implements them. Each is equally a subject of SEC oversight."" Id. 
at 733. The Court noted that Association rules were subject to careful scrutiny by the SEC, id. at 734, and concluded that 
antitrust immunity was necessary to make the regulatory scheme function."
1581,36," See Hush-A-Phone, 22 F.C.C. 112 (1957) (after remand). See also TAN 38, p. 16, & note 38, infra. "
1582,37," In Cantor, decided after NASD, the Court reaffirmed that it ""has consistently refused to find that regulation gave rise to an 
implied exemption without first determining that the exemption was necessary in order to make the regulatory Act work, 'and 
even then only to the minimum extent necessary.'"" Cantor, 428 U.S. at 597 (footnote omitted) (quoting Silver v. New York Stock 
Exch., 373 U.S. 341, 357, 83 S. Ct. 1246, 10 L. Ed. 2d 389 (1963))."
1582,38," See note 32 supra. As early as 1956, the justification for restricting foreign attachments had been authoritatively construed to 
be limited to instances of impairment of the telephone system. See Hush-A-Phone Corp. v. United States, 238 F.2d 266, 268-69, 
99 U.S. App. D.C. 190 (D.C. Cir. 1956), after remand, 22 F.C.C. 112 (1957). This point was reasserted in 1968 in emphatic 
terms, in the FCC's Carterfone decision which preceded the filing of the tariffs at issue here. The Commission there held that 
HN17[
] a tariff was intrinsically unreasonable if it restricted interconnection for reasons other than actual impairment of the 
system or its utility to users. The following language is representative of the Commission's directive that carriers be as narrowly 
specific in preventing interconnection and as open to customer choice and thereby the competition of foreign attachments as 
possible: Our conclusion here is that a customer desiring to use an interconnecting device to improve the utility to him of both the 
telephone system and a private radio system should be able to do so, so long as the interconnection does not adversely 
affect the telephone company's operations or the telephone system's utility for others. A tariff which prevents this is 
unreasonable; it is also unduly discriminatory when, as here, the telephone company's own interconnecting equipment is 
approved for use. The vice of the present tariff, here as in Hush-A-Phone, is that it prohibits the use of harmless as well as 
harmful devices. . . . . There has been no adequate showing that nonharmful interconnection must be prohibited in order to permit the telephone 
company to carry out its system responsibilities. . . . We are not holding that the telephone companies may not prevent the 
use of devices which actually cause harm, or that they may not set up reasonable standards to be met by interconnection 
devices. . . . The telephone companies would remain free to make improvements to the telephone system and could reflect any such 
improvements in reasonable revised standards for nontelephone company provided devices used in connection with the 
system. Manufacturers and sellers of such devices would then have the responsibility of offering for sale or use only such 
equipment as would be in compliance with such revised standards. . . . That the telephone companies may not have known prior to the proceedings herein that the Carterfone was in fact 
harmless is irrelevant, since they barred its use without regard to its effect upon the telephone system. Furthermore, the 
tariff was the carrier's own. It was not prescribed by the Commission. . . . Where the carrier itself initiates the rate or 
practice its lawfulness remains open, not only to a prospective finding but also to a retroactive one. Carterfone, 13 F.C.C.2d at 424-25 (emphasis added). One further point must be added. We do not accept as significant any argument that the equipment at issue in Carterfone was 
not network control signalling equipment, whereas at least some of the equipment at issue here might be characterized as such. 
The rule we read in Carterfone is that the carriers were put on notice that tariffs might reasonably prohibit only those foreign 
attachments that posed a significant actual danger to the system. While a tariff might reasonably treat the connection of foreign 
network signalling equipment differently from the connection of other equipment that was not, this would be simply derivative of 
the actual danger criterion, in that the former type of equipment alone might pose such a danger. We find no significance to the 
distinction apart from this criterion, however. The Commission, as well as this court, has clearly and repeatedly held that while the precise holding of Carterfone did not 
decide the issue of customer replacement of NCSU equipment, the broad and binding principle of Carterfone, and Hush-A- "
1583,," Phone before it, applied to all telephone equipment. As we said in International Tel. & Tel. Corp. v. General Tel. & Elecs. Corp, 
518 F.2d 913, 933 (9th Cir. 1975): Carterfone declared void those tariffs filed with the FCC and state regulatory commissions by all domestic telephone 
operating companies prohibiting the interconnection of subscriber-owned equipment with the carrier's telephone system. As 
a result of the Carterfone decision, all telephone subscribers are now free, in theory, to buy their own telephone equipment 
from suppliers of their choice. But telephone operating companies have succeeded in minimizing the impact of Carterfone 
through tariffs requiring telephone companies to supply and install interface devices. (Footnote and citation omitted). We are bound by our previous interpretation of Carterfone. See also First Report, 56 F.C.C.2d at 
594-96 (""our Carterfone decision was not limited to the Carterfone device per se, but was rather a broad general policy. [. . .] 
This broad Carterfone policy applied equally to devices which had direct electrical connections.); American Telephone and 
Telegraph Co.'s Proposed Tariff Revisions in Tariff No. 263 Exempting Mebane Home Telephone Co., 53 F.C.C.2d 473, 476-78 
(1975) [Mebane Home Telephone Co.]: The foregoing adequately demonstrates the broad principle underlying Hush-A-Phone and Carterfone, namely, the 
subscriber's right to make beneficial use of an interconnected device without causing harm to the telephone company's 
operations. We see no reason why this broad principle should not extend to interconnected devices such as PBX's and key 
systems which may replace telephone system equipment. [. . .] The determining factor should be whether there is harm to 
the telephone network, irrespective of whether the particular interconnection device is one of the nature involved in 
Carterfone or a PBX system or key system. To make a distinction based solely on whether there is a substitution of 
telephone company equipment, would be an arbitrary and unreasonable infringement of the subscriber's right in the 
absence of technical harm or other public detriment. This point was made recently by an FCC hearing examiner: The defendant[s'] attempt to limit the broad general policy expressed in Hush-a-Phone and Carterfone to exclude devices 
with direct electrical connections must be rejected. There is simply no justification for such a construction. The important 
and critical factor is whether the device is harmful or harmless, irrespective of whether a direct electrical connection may be 
involved. More specifically, there was no justification for tariffs which precluded the connection of devices by direct electrical 
connections which were harmless to the system. Western States Tel. Co., FCC Docket 16883, slip op. at 58 (Initial Decision of ALJ, released April 10, 1981). See also note 20, supra. "
1584,39," See note 38, supra."
1584,40," As one student commentator has noted, ""One goal implicit in implied immunity analysis is to avoid unfairly subjecting the 
antitrust defendant to contradictory legal standards, penalizing through the antitrust laws conduct that the regulator in some 
sense ordered."" Note, Antitrust and Regulated Industries: A Critique and Proposal for Reform of the Implied Immunity Doctrine, 
57 Tex. L. Rev. 751, 824 (1979)"
1584,41," Both the antitrust laws and the FCA permit the FCC and the courts to prescribe conduct, through hearings and injunctive relief, 
respectively, and both laws provide for damages remedies. If a utility adopts a course of conduct seeking to comply with the 
standards of the FCA, AT&T argues it is more likely to be held liable for treble damages under the antitrust laws; but if the utility 
adopts Sherman Act standards as its directive and files tariffs designed to maximize competition, AT&T suggests it may be 
faulted for not heeding the public interest standards of the FCA. We indicate below, however, that these concerns may be 
assuaged without our finding implied immunity. See TAN 57-67, pp. 22-30, infra."
1584,42," The issue of agency approval of the post-Carterfone tariffs relates not so much to the policy of deference to a regulatory 
agency as it does to the fairness to the regulated entity. Since the district court decisions in DASA and Phonetele occurred after 
the FCC had declared the post-Carterfone tariffs unlawful, subsequently permitting an antitrust action for damages does not 
conflict with an agency policy. Cf. Note, supra note 40, 57 Tex. L. Rev. at 819-20 (retroactivity of First Report bears on issue of 
fairness, not on issue of conflict giving rise to immunity). "
1585,43," The majority of courts addressing the issue have concluded that the FCC did not approve the post-Carterfone tariffs for 
purposes of determining antitrust immunity. The district court in Essential may be interpreted to hold an opposite conclusion. See 
446 F. Supp. at 1102, rev'd, 610 F.2d 1114 (3d Cir. 1979). The court concluded that ""the tariffs were sanctioned as an interim 
means of protecting the network while the agency developed the necessary data to formulate its registration program."" 446 F. 
Supp. at 1102. Although the court's factual description of the agency's action may be correct, we cannot agree with its legal conclusions. We 
have explained our interpretation of the Commission's action on the post-Carterfone tariffs above. See notes 20 & 38, supra. 
Even if the FCC's positions during the 1968-1975 period was ambiguous in some respects, however, see, e.g., AT&T ""Foreign 
Attachment"" Tariff Revisions, 18 F.C.C.2d at 872 (on reconsideration), the FCC cannot reasonably be interpreted as having 
adopted the post-Carterfone tariffs as agency policy for purposes of determining antitrust immunity. See also Northeastern, 477 
F. Supp. at 259-60. In any event, the district court in Essential was reversed.  Essential Communications Sys., Inc. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 610 
F.2d 1114 (3d Cir. 1979)."
1585,44," In a related lawsuit, the FCC has indicated that conduct which it has prescribed or explicitly approved should be entitled to 
antitrust immunity, but there should be no ""blanket immunity"" for all conduct embodied in tariffs filed with the FCC and permitted 
to go into effect. Memorandum of FCC as Amicus Curiae, reprinted in 62 F.C.C.2d 1103 (1975). See United States v. American 
Tel. & Tel. Co., 427 F. Supp. 57, 59 (D.D.C. 1976)."
1585,45," By contrast, if a plaintiff sued AT&T under the Sherman Act for damages or injunctive relief based on AT&T's implementing the 
registration program on file with the FCC, such a suit probably would conflict with a considered policy adopted by the FCC. To 
allow the antitrust action to frustrate the goals of the FCA as defined by the FCC in the registration program would, in the 
agency's view, involve a plain repugnancy and require antitrust immunity. Cf.  Mt. Hood Stages, Inc. v. Greyhound Corp., 555 
F.2d 687, 692-93 (9th Cir. 1977) (in context of state regulation), cert. denied in part, 434 U.S. 1008, 98 S. Ct. 716, 54 L. Ed. 2d 
750, vacated on other grounds, 437 U.S. 322, 98 S. Ct. 2370, 57 L. Ed. 2d 239 (1978); Note, supra note 40, 57 Tex. L. Rev. at 
793."
1585,46," The Third Circuit in Essential Communications Sys., Inc. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 610 F.2d 1114 (3d Cir. 1979), held in a 
similar case that immunity was inappropriate because the plaintiff was a competitor and not a customer of AT&T. The court 
concluded that the FCA was intended to protect customers of carriers against discriminatory rates and charges but was not 
designed to regulate the conduct of carriers vis-a-vis competitors. We have some doubt regarding the court's interpretation of the 
Act's history. Competitors of AT&T have initiated and participated in numerous proceedings before the FCC. See, e.g., "
1586,," Comtronics, Inc., 57 F.C.C.2d 1202 (1976); Computoll Corp., 56 F.C.C.2d 35 (1975); American Tel. & Tel. Co., 56 F.C.C.2d 14 
(1975); United Tel. Co. of the Carolinas, 52 F.C.C.2d 717 (1975); CPI Microwave, Inc., 52 F.C.C.2d 173 (1975). In a similar vein, several courts, on somewhat different rationales and with varying degrees of analysis, have indicated their 
doubt concerning the availability or effectiveness of the damages remedy when a competitor sues a regulated entity for violation 
of the FCA. See, e.g., Mid-Texas, 615 F.2d at 1380 (""The FCC [is not] empowered to award damages in favor of [an] injured 
competitor"" for violation of FCA); Nader v. FCC, 520 F.2d 182, 206, 172 U.S. App. D.C. 1 (D.C. Cir. 1975) (remedial system 
incomplete; no damages remedy for competitors) (dicta) (by implication); Litton Sys., Inc. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 487 F. 
Supp. 942 (S.D.N.Y. 1980) (damages remedy more useful in theory than practice); MCI Communications Corp. v. AT&T, 462 F. 
Supp. 1072, 1088 (N.D. Ill. 1978) (no damages remedy under FCA for injury suffered by competitor) (dicta); United States v. 
American Tel. & Tel. Co., 461 F. Supp. 1314, 1328 n.43 (D.D.C. 1978); Essential, 446 F. Supp. at 1100-1102 (FCC's First 
Report not retroactive);. But see Phonetele, 435 F. Supp. at 213. Perhaps an authoritative answer to this question is on the horizon. A hearing examiner has awarded damages to a competitor of 
AT&T for conduct similar to that alleged here. Western States Tel. Co., FCC Docket No. 16883 (Initial Decision of ALJ, released 
April 13, 1981). It remains to be seen whether the Commission and the courts sustain the award. Even if we were to accept that competitors had recourse to a remedial scheme under the FCA, and even were we further to 
accept that there might be different substantive standards, this would fall far short of a showing that the two remedies would be 
inconsistent. The law is full of instances of conduct that might give rise to two different types of liability, claims, or causes of 
action, and the difference is not thought synonymous with inconsistency. As even the predicates of this argument are dubious, 
we will not speculate at length about theoretical conflicts in a remedial vacuum. There are two reasons for this. First, the Initial Decision in Western States Telephone indicates that the standard for any liability 
would not be inconsistent with straight antitrust analysis, though of course the damages are not trebled. Id. at 62-70. Second, the 
freedom of a party injured by anticompetitive conduct to elect between an administrative FCA remedy and a judicial cause of 
action under the Clayton Act is quite acceptable; the latter need not derogate or interfere with the former: Petitioner's failure to seek Shipping Act reparations does not affect its rights under the antitrust laws. The rights which 
petitioner claims under the antitrust laws are entirely collateral to those which petitioner might have sought under the 
Shipping Act. This does not suggest that petitioner might have sought recovery under both, but petitioner did have its 
choice. Carnation Co. v. Pacific Westbound Conference, 383 U.S. 213, 224, 86 S. Ct. 781, 15 L. Ed. 2d 709 (1966)."
1586,47," We do note that under some interpretations of the rule of reason, the absence of a damages remedy under the FCA weighs 
against finding an implied antitrust immunity and gives the antitrust court a role in enforcing the public interest standards of the 
Act. See Mid-Texas, 615 F.2d at 1380."
1586,48," A contrary interpretation might lead to the conclusion that any explicit damages remedy within a regulatory act, whether or not 
focused solely on antitrust violations, would give rise to antitrust immunity. We refuse, however, to rely so heavily on such a thin 
reed especially in light of Supreme Court precedents and the Court's repeated admonitions that repeal of the antitrust laws is not 
to be lightly inferred. See, e.g., Carnation, 383 U.S. at 224 (petitioner had option of seeking recovery under either Shipping Act 
or antitrust laws). It is unlikely that a plaintiff could recover damages under both statutes, see id., so there is no danger of 
multiple liability."
1586,49," Cf, Cantor, 428 U.S. at 594 (""nothing unjust in a conclusion that . . . [defendant's] participation in the decision is sufficiently 
significant to require that its conduct implementing the decision . . . conform to applicable federal law""); Northeastern, 477 F. "
1587,," Supp. at 263 (defendant initiated challenged practice ""not at the command of the state, but after exercising its own business 
judgment""); United States v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 461 F. Supp. 1314, 1327-28 (D.D.C. 1978): ""The allegations of the complaint describe conduct that quite obviously was not stimulated by regulatory supervision or 
coercion; it is of a character that reflects defendants' business judgment that its profits might be maximized if potential 
customers were discouraged from entering the various markets AT&T controls."""
1587,50," Phonotele's complaint pleaded several matters ancillary to the tariff: It was alleged that AT&T delayed the availability of 
connecting arrangements for consumers outside California for over three years and charged consumers outside California over 
three times the monthly service charge for the same service within California without justification. Finally, Phonetele alleged that 
AT&T deliberately misinterpreted its own tariffs when it required a PCA for the Phonemaster. According to Phonetele, tariff 263 
did not cover the Phonemaster. See TAN 5-6, p. 3, and notes 5 & 6, supra. Regarding immunity for the ancillary conduct, the FCC may have primary jurisdiction to hear complaints concerning alleged 
misinterpretation or bad faith implementation of filed tariffs, but we have already concluded that this fact alone does not require 
implied antitrust immunity."
1587,51," This changed after Telerent. See TAN 13-14, pp. 5-6, & notes 13, 14, 22, supra. Even after 1974, state commissions still 
retained authority to regulate the rates charged in connection with customer-provided equipment, and one of the antitrust 
allegations is that General charged excessive prices, reflected in filed tariffs, in an effort to monopolize the relevant markets."
1587,52," In this vein, the Court has already held that antitrust immunity should not be conferred when a state agency passively accepts 
a public utility's tariff. See Midcal, 445 U.S. at 104. Cf.  Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., 428 U.S. 579, 96 S. Ct. 3110, 49 L. Ed. 2d 
1141 (1976) (implied state action). As the Court explained in Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 791, 95 S. Ct. 2004, 
44 L. Ed. 2d 572 (1975), ""it is not enough that . . . anticompetitive conduct is 'prompted' by state action; rather, anticompetitive 
activities must be compelled by direction of the State acting as a sovereign."" "
1588,53," Cf.  Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, 433 U.S. 350, 97 S. Ct. 2691, 53 L. Ed. 2d 810 (1977) (state action exemption); Goldfarb v. 
Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 95 S. Ct. 2004, 44 L. Ed. 2d 572 (1975) (same). This is especially the case where the entity 
claiming the benefit of the state action exemption is not a public corporation, such as a municipally owned utility, but is a private 
enterprise subject to state regulation. See City of Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., 435 U.S. 389, 98 S. Ct. 1123, 55 L. 
Ed. 2d 364 (1978)."
1588,54," Other courts which have refused to imply antitrust immunity under the FCA for the activities of AT&T have also held those 
activities, and parallel measures taken before state utilities commissions, unprotected by the Parker doctrine. See, e.g., Mid-
Texas, 615 F.2d at 1380-81; Essential, 610 F.2d at 1125; Litton Systems, 487 F. Supp. at 955-57."
1588,55," But see Jeffrey v. Southwestern Bell, 518 F.2d 1129, 1133 (5th Cir. 1975) (rate approval by city council held sufficiently 
""sovereign""). Whatever degree of state sanction beyond mere authorization or approval is required by the Supreme Court's 
cases, cf.  Cantor, 428 U.S. at 592-93 (state action exemption); Goldfarb, 421 U.S. at 790 (same), the CPUC did not adopt or 
embrace the PCA requirement as state policy beyond the mere fact of permitting General to file the tariff containing the PCA 
requirement. Thus, the first requirement of Midcal is not met in this case. We do recognize a possible distinction between this case and Cantor, in that the CPUC's concern over the safety of the 
telephone network and its corresponding power to regulate the conditions of interconnection, as well as its concern with rates 
charged in connection with customer-provided equipment, are at the core of its regulatory concerns, see I P. Areeda & D. 
Turner, Antitrust Law P 214b4 (1978), whereas provision of light bulbs in Cantor did not relate to the central purpose of the 
regulatory agency. We do not mean to suggest that Parker immunity never applies to tariffs initiated by the regulated entity. See 
I P. Areeda & D. Turner, supra, at PP 212-215. The CPUC did not, however, express its concern or exercise its power in such a 
way as to provide immunity for General's conduct. Professors Areeda and Turner have concluded, albeit ""reluctantly,"" that where there is adequate supervision and clear state 
intent, regulation of foreign attachments to the telephone system by state utilities commissions probably should be immune from 
antitrust attack. See id. PP 214b4 & 215b2, at 86-87, 96. This conclusion would appear to apply equally to regulation by state 
commissions and also federal commissions such as the FCC. We agree with Professors Areeda and Turner on this issue, but 
we do not think that our holding will ""render inoperable the regulatory programs of most states."" Id. P 215b2, at 96. We hold only 
that neither the FCC nor the CPUC intended to adopt the content of the post-Carterfone tariffs as federal or state policy, 
respectively, when they permitted the tariffs to go into effect."
1588,56," It is possible, however, that General may be entitled to antitrust immunity on another ground. Supreme Court and lower court 
decisions indicate that a defendant's freedom of choice in taking the allegedly anticompetitive action is an important factor in 
determining whether implied regulatory immunity or immunity under the state action exemption is appropriate. Cf.  Cantor, 428 
U.S. at 592-93 (state action question), Goldfarb, 421 U.S. at 790. As we noted earlier in this opinion, when the facilities of an 
intrastate telephone company are used for interstate communications, they are subject to the tariffs filed by AT&T. To the extent 
General's decision to require a protective connecting arrangement was dictated by AT&T's tariff revisions filed with the FCC, its 
own PCA tariff may have been a justified, if not a coerced, compliance with the requirements of the federal and state regulatory "
1589,," schemes. See TAN 13-14, pp. 5-6 & note 14, supra (relation between federal and state regulatory schemes); TAN 57-67, pp. 22-
30, infra (dictates of regulatory scheme under which defendant operates may be used to establish a factual defense in particular 
cases)."
1589,57," International Tel. & Tel. Co. v. General Tel. & Elecs. Corp., 518 F.2d 913, 935-36 (9th Cir. 1975) (footnote omitted). See also 
Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States, 410 U.S. 366, 381-82, 93 S. Ct. 1022, 35 L. Ed. 2d 359 (1973): We do not suggest, however, that the District Court, concluding that Otter Tail violated the antitrust laws, should be 
impervious to Otter Tail's assertion that compulsory interconnection or wheeling will erode its integrated system and 
threaten its capacity to serve adequately the public. . . .Since the District Court has made future connections subject to 
Commission approval and in any event has retained jurisdiction to enable the parties to apply for ""necessary or appropriate"" 
relief and presumably will give effect to the policies embodied in the Federal Power Act, we cannot say under these 
circumstances that it has abused its discretion."""
1589,58," The defendants might, for example, attempt to demonstrate why methods of protecting the system which did not depend on 
particularized knowledge about the technical specifications of all types of equipment that might be interconnected, would have 
been either inadequate or not reasonably foreseeable. One such method is suggested by the FCC-proposed tariff in 1975, 
namely the requirement that those desiring to connect foreign equipment first notify the telephone company with the provision 
that the telephone company could temporarily discontinue service to any customer whose equipment was causing actual harm 
to the telephone network. See First Report, 56 F.C.C.2d at 611-12."
1589,59," Counsel for General assert that in Carterfone ""the FCC ordered the telephone companies to submit new tariffs [to protect the 
telephone system]"" (emphasis added). The words of the Commission are at no point in the decision ambiguous as to this issue 
and simply will not bear this interpretation: In view of the unlawfulness of the tariff there would be no point in merely declaring it invalid as applied to the Carterfone 
and permitting it to continue in operation as to other interconnection devices. This would also put a clearly improper burden 
upon the manufacturers and users of other devices. The appropriate remedy is to strike the tariffs and permit the carriers, if 
they so desire, to propose new tariff provisions in accordance with this opinion. We make no rulings as to damages since 
that relief has not been requested. As noted above, the carriers may submit new tariffs which will protect the telephone 
system against harmful devices, and may specify technical standards if they wish. "
1590,," Carterfone, 13 F.C.C.2d at 425-26 (footnote omitted) (emphasis added). The Carterfone decision offered AT&T a choice between action and inaction. In our view, section 203 of the FCA does not 
require a carrier to file a tariff describing an omission to act. Even if such a statutory requirement had existed, the mere 
compulsion to file a descriptive tariff would not in any way have justified the filing of a restrictive tariff. The defendants do not 
argue that they were compelled to resist interconnection by the possibility of liability for any damage caused by uncontrolled 
interconnection. See TAN 64-65, pp. 27-28, & note 64, infra (discussing Mid-Texas)."
1590,60," This court in Moore rejected a claim for immunity based on state regulation, but it is not clear from the Moore opinion precisely 
what argument the panel rejected. The briefs in that case reveal that the defendants-appellees argued only that an Oregon 
statute which authorized, but did not require, cemeteries to promulgate rules in very general terms could be interpreted to cover 
the challenged tying practices. Moore is distinguishable on this point because the defendants-appellees in that case offered a 
conjectural and wholly state law ground as a justification. Here we are dealing with a state regulation that is in many ways an 
appendage of the dominant federal regulatory program. We are also not permitting conclusory assertions of conjectural 
regulatory justification, as in Moore, but are only allowing an opportunity to prove a narrowly defined type of regulatory necessity 
as a concrete matter of fact. Finally, we think dictum in the Cantor opinion, on which the Moore panel relied heavily, strongly supports our view. After 
acknowledging the severe penalty of the treble-damages provision of the antitrust laws, the Court stated: The concern about treble-damage liability has arguable relevance to this case in two ways. If the hazard of violating the 
antitrust laws were enhanced by the fact of regulation, or if a regulated company had engaged in anticompetitive conduct in 
reliance on a justified understanding that such conduct was immune from the antitrust laws, a concern with the punitive 
aspects of the treble-damage remedy would be appropriate. But neither of those circumstances is present in this case."
1590,428," U.S. at 599. Thus, were the Court to encounter a case presenting a justifiable reliance on the perceived dictates of a state 
or federal regulatory scheme, some measure of relief from the antitrust laws would probably result. We have decided that such 
relief should be incorporated into the standard of antitrust liability. "
1591,61," See, e.g., Travelers Ins. Co. v. Blue Cross of W. Pa., 361 F. Supp. 774, 780 (W.D. Pa. 1972), aff'd, 481 F.2d 80 (3d Cir.), cert. 
denied, 414 U.S. 1093, 94 S. Ct. 724, 38 L. Ed. 2d 550 (1973). Cf.  International Rys. of Cent. America v. United Brands Co.,

97 S. Ct. 101, 50 L. Ed. 2d 100 (1976)."
1591,62," The Court found the requirement completely unjustifiable and struck it as violative of the Sherman Act mainly due to the lack of 
procedural safeguards accompanying the deprivation of the private wire service.  373 U.S. at 361. "
1592,," Similarly, in United States v. Marine Bancorporation, Inc., 418 U.S. 602, 94 S. Ct. 2856, 41 L. Ed. 2d 978 (1974), the 
government challenged under section 7 of the Clayton Act a merger between two banks based on the potential competition 
doctrine. Noting the ""extensive federal and state regulatory barriers to entry into commercial banking,"" the Court specifically held 
that ""the application of the [potential competition] doctrine to commercial banking must take into account the unique federal and 
state regulatory restraints on entry into that line of commerce."" Id. at 627-28 (footnote omitted)."
1592,63," The Jacobi case dealt with self-regulation by the New York Stock Exchange, under the Securities Exchange Act. We are 
aware that the Jacobi panel relied on Silver, and placed on the plaintiff the burden of showing that the challenged conduct of the 
regulated entity was neither ""germane"" to the purposes of the Securities Exchange Act nor consistent with reason. See 520 F.2d 
at 1239. The Silver Court, however, did not go so far as to detail what standard of proof might be applied to a proferred 
regulatory defense and where the burden of proof might lie. See 373 U.S. at 366. While the Silver Court located its action under the ""aegis of the rule of reason,"" id. at 360, it also spoke of a regulatory 
justification ""in answer to the assertion of an antitrust claim,"" id. at 361, and of the ""interposing"" of such a justification, id. at 366. 
Thus, although we agree with the Second Circuit's choice of a standard of reasonableness, we read Silver to imply that the 
burden of maintaining a regulatory justification lies on the defendant. We think this allocation of the burden (1) minimizes the 
distortion of the elements of substantive antitrust violations that would result were we to attempt to apply a ""rule of reason"" 
analysis beyond the scope of section 1 and (2) places the burden of production on the party with the best access to evidence 
and expertise. Accordingly, our allocation is consistent with our desire to avoid undue interference with plaintiffs' exercise of their 
right to seek the protection of the ""fundamental national economic policy"" represented by the antitrust laws, see National 
Gerimedical Hospital v. Blue Cross, 452 U.S. 378, 101 S. Ct. 2415, 69 L. Ed. 2d 89, 49 U.S.L.W. 4672, 4676 (U.S. June 15, 
1981), (quoting Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States, 410 U.S. 366, 374, 93 S. Ct. 1022, 35 L. Ed. 2d 359 (1973)), while 
accommodating fairness by permitting regulated entities ""breathing space"" between the dictates of the regulatory regime and the 
antitrust laws. See Silver, 373 U.S. at 360. The Initial Decision in Western States Telephone makes a similar point: Contrary to the arguments of the telephone company defendants, the burden of establishing that the Western States 
telephones were harmful to the telephone system was on the defendants. In this connection, the Commission made clear in 
Docket 19528 First Report and Order, 56 F.C.C.2d 593, 596 that the Carterfone decision ""placed the burden of proof 
squarely upon the carriers - not the users or this Commission - to demonstrate that a particular unit or class of customer-
provided equipment would cause either technical or economic harm to the telephone network. . . ."" Thus, while the 
designation order in this case placed the burden of proof on the question of damages on Western States, the order placed 
the question of harm from interconnected equipment on the carrier. (See 62 F.C.C.2d 1070, 1071 (1977)). Hence, 
defendants' arguments to the contrary are rejected. It appears clear that the defendants were in the best position to 
establish either the presence or absence of harm arising from the Western States telephones. They had access to the 
information pertinent to a resolution of such question.  Resale and Shared Use of Common Carrier Services and Facilities,

1592,64," Other courts have reached similar conclusions. Although the Fifth Circuit found some sort of duty to resist interconnection by 
other carriers if perceived not to be in the public interest, this was not based on any extensive analysis of authority, and is in any 
event of only tenuous relevance here as the court was interpreting a subsection of the FCA fundamentally different from that "
1593,," before us; interconnection of carriers is massive compared to that of most individual subscribers, and both the effects on the 
network and the carriers' regulatory duties may be substantially different from those involved in this appeal. See Mid-Texas, 615 
F.2d at 1380-81. Cf. TAN 58-59, pp. 23, & note 59, supra (no duty to file post-Carterfone tariff imposed by Carterfone decision)"
1593,65," The Eighth Circuit, in Sound, Inc. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 631 F.2d 1324 (8th Cir. 1980), implicitly adopted a similar view 
when it denied a telephone company antitrust immunity and designated for fact-finding at trial the question whether the company 
adopted a PCA requirement because it did not know how otherwise to protect the integrity of its own equipment. See id. at 1330 
n.7. The Second Circuit has made a jury question of the propriety of the design of a PCA in an antitrust case challenging the 
design of the PCA, but not the filing of the underlying tariff. See Northeastern Tel. Co. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 651 F.2d 76 
(2d Cir. 1981)."
1593,66," In GT&E, implied immunity was not at issue, and GT&E did not even attempt to demonstrate that the dictates of the regulatory 
scheme imposed on it an obligation, either actual or perceived, to acquire the telephone companies. Rather, the sole claim was 
grounded in the advantages gained through vertical integration, an issue irrelevant even ""in the absence of any regulation 
whatsoever."" GT&E, 518 F.2d at 935. Since nothing unique or peculiar to the regulatory system caused, either directly or 
tangentially, the defendant's conduct, there was no reason to skew the doctrinal scheme of the antitrust laws."
1593,67," The Supreme Court apparently has taken a similar view in National Gerimedical Hospital v. Blue Cross, 452 U.S. 378, 101 S. 
Ct. 2415, 69 L. Ed. 2d 89, 49 U.S.L.W. 4672 (U.S. June 15, 1981), where, after refusing to accord Blue Cross implied antitrust 
immunity on the basis of its claim to have been acting to further the purposes of the National Health Planning and Resources 
Development Act of 1974, 42 U.S.C. § 3001, the Court noted that litigation on the merits should give attention to the ""particular 
economic context"" in which the alleged antitrust misconduct occurred. See National Gerimedical, 49 U.S.L.W. at 4676 n.19. "
1597,1," At oral argument we requested supplemental briefs on the issue of whether the activities of Appellees were immune from 
antitrust litigation due to state regulation under the doctrine of Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 63 S. Ct. 307, 87 L. Ed. 315 
(1943) and its progeny. Upon reconsideration, this case is inappropriate for a consideration of that issue. First of all, it was not 
raised to either Court below. Secondly, the F.C.C. in its Telerent decision effectively preempted the states from regulating the 
area of the interconnection industry; to the extent that the states regulate at all, at least with respect to the California P.U.C., it is 
in a manner perfectly consistent with the F.C.C. registration program of 47 C.F.R. §§ 68.100 et. seq. See Phonetele, Inc. v. 
American Telephone & Telegraph, 435 F. Supp. at 213, n. 12. "
1598,2, For the sake of brevity discussion of the alleged vertical conspiracy and Counts II-VIII of that complaint is omitted here. 
1609,1," Although the superior court declared A.R.S. § 5-108(A)(1)(i), as amended in 1972, unconstitutional, Downs stated that its 
appeal did not involve the constitutionality of that section.  We have, therefore, not considered the constitutionality of that 
section. "
1613,2," C. The commission shall not issue an original permit to conduct a horse racing, harness racing or dog racing meeting at any 
place, enclosure or track not used for racing purposes pursuant to permits actually issued as authorized by law prior to February 
1, 1971, unless before the beginning of construction or preparation of the place, enclosure or track the commission determines 
that:"
1613,1," . The conducting of horse, harness or dog racing meetings at such place will serve the public interest, convenience or 
necessity,"
1613,2," . The plan of racing is economically feasible,"
1613,3," . The issuance of a permit is in the best interest of racing and the state of Arizona generally, and"
1613,4," . Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to permit any place, enclosure or track used for horse, harness or dog racing on 
or before February 1, 1971, to be used for any other type of animal racing, except that in counties with a population of less than 
seven hundred thousand as shown by the last United States census, a place, enclosure or track used for one type of animal 
racing may be used for any other type of animal racing. In considering an application for a permit under this section, the 
commission shall give consideration to the number and location of existing tracks, the number of permits already granted and "
1614,," the economic effect the granting of a new permit may have on existing tracks and permittees and the revenues of the state of 
Arizona. D. If the owner or lessee of any place, enclosure or track used for racing purposes pursuant to permits issued as authorized by 
law on or before February 1, 1971, is obligated for any reason to abandon the use of the place, enclosure or track, he may 
transfer the use and rights to use the premises for racing purposes to any other location in the same county. "
1615,3," It is significant that the antitrust claim here is based on the Arizona Antitrust Act (A.R.S. § 44-1402) rather than the Federal 
Sherman Antitrust Act (15 U.S.C. § 1). Therefore, the conflicting statutes in this case (A.R.S. §§ 5-110, 44-1402), both of which 
were passed by our Legislature, are competing on an equal footing and common rules of statutory construction are dispositive of 
this challenge. "

1634,1," A monument is a stone memorial or tombstone consisting of two parts, the base and the die which is set upright upon the 
base.  A marker, on the other hand, is a smaller flat memorial that is frequently made of bronze, copper or some other metal. "
1635,2," 15 U.S.C. § 1 provides in pertinent part: HN2[
] Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among 
the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal …."
1635,3," HN3[
] A trade association is an organization of producers or distributors of a commodity or service upon a mutual basis for 
the purpose of promoting the business of their branch of industry and improving their service to the public through the 
compilation and distribution of information, the establishment of trade standards and the cooperative handling of problems 
common to the production or distribution of the commodity or service with which they are concerned. S. Kirsh, Trade Associations, The Legal Aspects 13 (1928) (citation omitted)."
1635,4," HN5[
] Conspiracies or group boycotts that by agreement or otherwise result in price fixing are per se violations of § 1 of the Sherman Act. United States v. Topco Assocs., 405 U.S. 596, 606-09, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 1133-34, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515 (1972). The 
mere exchange of price data and other information among competitors, however, is not per se illegal; indeed, such practices can 
in certain circumstances increase economic efficiency and render markets more, rather than less, competitive. United States v. 
United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422, 441 n.16, 98 S. Ct. 2864, 2875 n.16, 57 L. Ed. 2d 854 (1978). Appellant appears to 
have asked this court to find a per se price fixing violation of § 1.  We decline its invitation to do so and choose to analyze 
appellees' exclusive installation policy under the rule of reason. See Montague, ""Per Se Illegality"" & the Rule of Reason, in 12 
ABA Antitrust Section 69-104 (1958). "
1637,5," Appellees' affirmative defense confirms rather than refutes the anticompetitive purpose and effect of the rule.  Appellees argue 
that the restraint is justified because of their perpetual duty to maintain the appearance of their cemeteries. As the discussion 
below reveals, no cases have been found that accept such an argument.  Infra at pp. 1144-1145.  Appellees have not provided 
ample documentation for their assertion that the individual owner of the cemetery is the only concern that can prepare 
foundations or install or service grave monuments or markers in such a way that does not destroy the beautiful appearance and 
tranquil atmosphere of a cemetery's grounds. "

practice of providing homebuilders with inexpensive underground service installations on condition that builders erect a primarily 
electricity-served home was not an unlawful tie because of the lack of two separate markets). "
1643,8," In many industries, including cable television, common carrier and condominium industries, owners or licensees retain the 
obligation to serve all classes of customers with technical integrity and quality service.  The cable television operator must give a 
commitment to provide the community with quality service throughout the life of the franchise.  The telephone industry must 
maintain the integrity of their system, but the FCC has continued to gradually liberalize tariffs on customer installed equipment.

Telecommunications, in Communications for Tomorrow 127, 133 (G. Robinson ed. 1978).  Thus, the continued obligation to 
maintain does not, without more, present an ample justification for the existence of a predicate tying arrangement. "
1656,*," Of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, sitting by designation pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 292(a). Opinion for the Court filed by District Judge OBERDORFER."
1656,1," The original complaint named four defendants, Dr. Karl Ziegler (the patentee), and three licensees. The licensee defendants 
entered consent judgments before trial but after the district court denied defendants' motion for summary judgment.  J.A. at 67.  
During the pendency of the litigation, Dr. Ziegler died.  His successor in interest, S.K., is the appellant here. "
1657,2," There was no restriction on the price or other terms under which Ethyl could sell ATAs, nor any restriction on Ethyl's use and 
sale of ATAs manufactured by some other process."
1657,3," The consent decrees, entered December 8, 1977, enjoined these defendants from enforcing or entering into any agreements 
that restricted any licensee's use of any process to produce aluminum alkyls or prevented any person authorized to use those 
patented processes from selling the products of those processes.  It also provided for compulsory licensing, at reasonable and 
nondiscriminatory rates and conditions, of all applicants for licenses to practice any patented invention owned by these 
defendants relating to aluminum alkyls, and for royalty-free licensing of patents on the manufacture of ATAs.  Defendants agreed "
1658,," further that if any motion were filed with respect to the judgment in Ethyl Corp. v. Hercules Powder Co., 232 F. Supp. 453 
(D.Del.1964), they would not oppose intervention by the United States nor would they oppose a modification of that judgment to 
permit sale of unpatented ATAs.  In order to secure compliance with the provisions of the consent decree, each defendant 
agreed to provide the United States with access to books, ledgers, etc. and the district court retained jurisdiction to enforce or 
modify the judgment."
1658,4," The conclusions of law entered by the district court are, in full, as follows:"
1658,1," . The Ziegler-Hercules Agreement to give Hercules the exclusive license for the sale in the United States of ATAs made 
pursuant to the Ziegler processes and to limit all other licensees to production of ATAs for captive use only was entered into by 
each of them with the purpose of restraining and controlling the sale of ATAs in the United States and with the specific intent of 
conferring upon Hercules (and subsequently the joint venture formed by Hercules and Stauffer) a monopoly over the sale of 
ATAs in the United States and is a violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2."
1658,2," . Numerous uses had been and were being developed for ATAs and the clear economic superiority of Ziegler's processes on 
which he had, or was attaining patents, caused a considerable number of American companies to seek licenses under Ziegler's 
processes.  The grant to Hercules of the exclusive license to sell in the United States, until the expiration of his last patent, was 
not reasonably necessary to any legitimate primary business purpose of Ziegler and Hercules and unreasonably affected 
competition and was imposed by a party with monopoly power for the purpose of restraining trade in the sale of ATAs in the 
United States and conferring upon Hercules (and subsequently upon Texas Alkyls) a monopoly in the sale of ATAs in the United 
States and is a violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1."
1658,3," . Ziegler and Hercules, (and subsequently Stauffer and Texas Alkyls) employed the economic leverage of the patents covering 
Ziegler's ATA manufacturing processes to restrain and prevent trade in the sale in the United States of unpatented ATAs and in 
so doing committed a per se violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1. J.A. at 127-28."
1658,5," In Q-Tips, Inc. v. Johnson & Johnson, Q-Tips held patents for a machine that made unpatented swabs with cotton either at one 
or both ends of the swab.  It licensed use of the machines to others but limited licensees either to production of swabs with only 
one cotton tip or limited the number of swabs that could be produced with cotton at both ends.  The district court found that Q-
Tips had not ""(overstepped) the monopoly to which it (was) entitled under the patent laws, into the areas interdicted by the "
1659,," antitrust statutes,"" by including quantity restrictions in its licenses. 109 F. Supp. at 661. The court of appeals affirmed.  207 F.2d 
509."

1659,7," Litigation of such cases increased markedly in 1970 when the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice reinstated its 
Patent Section and filed several civil actions, including the present case, challenging the validity of various licensing practices.

(collecting cases and statements of Justice Department officials expressing ""the view that the days of benign neglect toward 
restrictions of competition by patentees should be numbered"").  During this period the Division also filed, among others, United 
States v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 471 F. Supp. 532 (N.D.Cal.1978), aff'd 648 F.2d 642 (9th Cir. 1981) (see p. 1123, infra );

all competition.  To say that CIBA ""restrained competition"" by not licensing Abbott in as unlimited a fashion as possible is to 
impose a duty on the patentee that simply is not justifiable.  The restraint on competition inheres in the patent monopoly itself."
