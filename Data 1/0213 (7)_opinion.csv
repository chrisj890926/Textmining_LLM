1265,Counsel,"Counsel: James B. Ayers for appellants.  [****6]  I. This action is barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel 
despite the dismissal of plaintiffs' prior complaint by the Public Service Commission without a full evidentiary 
hearing.  ( United States v Utah Constr. Co., 384 U.S. 394; Matter of Evans v Monaghan, 306 NY 312; Osterhoudt v 
Rigney, 98 NY 222; People ex rel. McCabe v Matthies, 179 NY 242; Matter of New York Tel.  Co. v Public Serv. 
Comm. of State of N. Y., 56 AD2d 415; Matter of Tri-City Tel. Co. v Kahn, 49 AD2d 126, 38 NY2d 708.) II. This 
action is also barred by the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.  ( Far East Conference v United States, 342 U.S. 570; 
Hewitt v New York, New Haven & Hartford R. R. Co., 284 NY 117; Van Dussen-Storto Motor Inn v Rochester Tel. 
Corp., 42 AD2d 400, 34 NY2d 904; State of New York v New York Movers Tariff Bur., 48 Misc 2d 225; United

Micucci, 49 NY2d 594.) III. The Public Service Commission has exclusive original jurisdiction over public utility 
rates.  ( Van Dussen-Storto Motor Inn v Rochester Tel. Corp., 42 AD2d 400, 34 NY2d [****7]  904; People ex rel. 
Public Serv. Comm. of State of N. Y. v New York Tel. Co., 262 App Div 440, 287 NY 803.) IV. Plaintiffs have failed 
to join New York Telephone and the PSC as necessary parties to this action.
Keith J. Roland for respondents.  I. This antitrust action is not barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel.  ( Cantor 
v Detroit Edison Co., 428 U.S. 579; United States v American Tel. & Tel. Co., 427 F Supp 57, 429 U.S. 1071, 434

American Tel. & Tel. Co., 610 F2d 1114; Interconnect Planning Corp. v American Tel. & Tel. Co., 465 F Supp 811.) 
II. The Supreme Court possesses sufficient competence to review the issues in this case.  III. The PSC does not 
have exclusive original jurisdiction over the issues in this case.  ( Van Dussen-Storto Motor Inn v Rochester Tel. 
Co., 42 AD2d 400, 34 NY2d 904; [****8]  People ex rel. Public Serv. Comm. of State of N. Y. v New York Tel. Co.,

Tele/Resources v Public Serv. Comm. of State of N.  Y., 58 AD2d 406.) IV. Neither the PSC nor New York 
Telephone Company is a necessary party to this action.  ( Blue Grass Partners v Bruns, Nordeman, Rea & Co., 75 
AD2d 791.) V. Federal antitrust precedent should be followed by this court.  ( Manhattan Stor. & Warehouse Co. v 
Movers & Warehousemen's Assn. of Greater N. Y., 262 App Div 332, 289 NY 82; Hsing Chow v Union Cent. Life 
Ins. Co., 457 F Supp 1303.)
Robert Abrams, Attorney-General (Robert T. Perry, Shirley Adelson Siegel and Lloyd Constantine of counsel), 
amicus curiae.  I. PSC dismissal of a complaint alleging improper anticompetitive activity, without a thorough 
investigation or some hearing affording the complainant a fair opportunity to demonstrate his claim, does not bar, 
under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, an action under the Donnelly Act alleging similar improper anticompetitive 
activity.  (United States v Utah Constr.  Co., 384 U.S. 394; [****9]  Matter of Evans v Monaghan, 306 NY 312; 
Matter of Venes v Community School Bd. of Dist. 26, 43 NY2d 520; Hewitt v New York, New Haven & Hartford R.

McBride Transp., 56 Misc 2d 90; Tipler v Du Pont de Nemours & Co., 443 F2d 125; Lane Constr. Corp. v Winona 
Constr. Co., 49 AD2d 142; Sierra Club v Alexander, 484 F Supp 455, 633 F2d 206.) II. A court in an action under 
the Donnelly Act should not invoke the doctrine of primary jurisdiction and refer the entire action to the PSC before 
the issues have been crystallized through pretrial discovery.  (United States v Western Pacific R. R.  Co., 352 U.S. 
59; Nader v Allegheny Airlines, 426 U.S. 290; Carnation Co. v Pacific Conference, 383 U.S. 213; United States v

Hartford R. R. Co., 284 NY 117.) III. The PSC does not have exclusive original jurisdiction in an action under the 
Donnelly Act where plaintiffs have alleged that a competitor's rates in tariffs filed with the PSC are predatory.  ( Van 
Dussen-Storto Motor Inn v Rochester Tel. Corp., 42 AD2d 400, 34 NY2d 904; People ex rel. Public Serv. Comm. of
