                  Mehlman and Richard G. Liskov of counsel), for appellant in the first above-entitled matter.  I. The court below
                  incorrectly held that Alcoholic Beverage Control Law § 101-bb is in conflict with the Sherman Antitrust Act § 1.  (
                  Matter of Admiral Wine & Liq. Co. v State Liq. Auth., 61 NY2d 858; United States v Colgate & Co., 250 U.S. 300;
                  House of Materials v Simplicity Pattern Co., 298 F2d 867; Carbon Steel Prods. Corp. v Wood Steel Co., 289 F Supp
                  584; Fisher Foods v Ohio Dept. of Liq. Control, 555 F Supp 641; Rice v Williams Co., 458 U.S. 654; Serlin Wine &
                  Spirit Merchants v Healy, 512 F Supp 936, affd sub nom. Morgan v Division of Liq.  Control, 664 F2d 353; Seagram
                  & Sons v Hostetter, 384 U.S. 35; Matter of Mezzetti Assoc. v State Liq. Auth., 51 NY2d 761.) II. Even if
                  Alcoholic [****9]  Beverage Control Law § 101-bb mandated antitrust activity the statute is nevertheless exempt
                  from challenge under the ""State action"" doctrine.  ( Parker v Brown, 317 U.S. 341; California Liq. Dealers v Midcal
                  Aluminum, 445 U.S. 97; Morgan v Division of Liq. Control, 664 F2d 353.) III. The court below incorrectly held that
                  Alcoholic Beverage Control Law § 101-bb is not otherwise protected under the 21st Amendment.  ( Seagram &
                  Sons v Hostetter, 384 U.S. 35; California Liq. Dealers v Midcal Aluminum, 445 U.S. 97.) IV. Substantial evidence in
                  64 N.Y.2d 504, *504; 479 N.E.2d 779, **779; 490 N.Y.S.2d 143, ***143; 1985 N.Y. LEXIS 14233, ****5
                  
                  
                  the record supports the administrative finding that petitioner violated Alcoholic Beverage Control Law § 63 (4) and §
                  101-bb.  (300 Gramatan Ave. Assoc.  v State Div. of Human Rights, 45 NY2d 176; Matter of Avon Bar & Grill v
                  O'Connell, 301 NY 150; Matter of Levine v Whalen, 39 NY2d 510; People ex rel. Nauss v Graves, 283 NY 383;
                  Matter of Howard v Wyman, 28 NY2d 434.)
                  Seymour Howard for respondent in the first above-entitled matter.  I.  The statutory minimum resale pricing scheme
                  constitutes price fixing by a private party without any real participation, supervision or review by the State and
                  thus [****10]  violates the provisions of the Sherman Antitrust Act and the United States Constitution.  ( California
                  Liq. Dealers v Midcal Aluminum, 445 U.S. 97; Schwegmann Bros. v Calvert Corp., 341 U.S.  384; Rice v Williams
                  Co., 458 U.S. 654.) II. The court below correctly held that the 21st Amendment does not shield the statutory
                  minimum retail pricing scheme of liquors in New York.  ( Seagram & Sons v Hostetter, 16 NY2d 47, 384 U.S. 35,
                  967; Matter of Mezzetti Assoc. v State Liq.  Auth., 51 NY2d 761.) III. The court below was correct in concluding that
                  respondent did not engage in another business.
                  Victor Feingold for Wine, Liquor & Distillery Workers Union Local 1, AFL-CIO and others, amici curiae in the first
                  above-entitled matter.  I. Section 101-bb (2) does not violate the Sherman Act since it is a permissible exercise
                  under the State action rule.  ( Battipaglia v New York State Liq. Auth., 745 F2d 166; Seagram & Sons v Hostetter,
                  384 U.S. 35; Morgan v Division of Liq. Control, 664 F2d 353; Fisher Foods v Ohio Dept. of Liq. Control, 555 F Supp
                  641.) II. Section 101-bb does not conflict with this court's ruling in Mezzetti II nor with the  [****11]  Midcal decision
                  of the United States Supreme Court.  ( Morgan v Division of Liq. Control, 664 F2d 353; House of Spirits v Doyle, 72
                  Misc 2d 1036, 43 AD2d 880, 36 NY2d 815.) III. The minimum consumer's resale price set by section 101-bb is
                  solely State action and therefore exempt from the Sherman Act under the Parker doctrine.  ( Matter of Admiral Wine
                  & Liq. Co. v State Liq. Auth., 61 NY2d 858.) IV. Balancing the State's demonstrated interest articulated in section
                  101-bb outweighs the Federal interest in the Sherman Act.
                  Martin P. Mehler for Metropolitan Package Store Association, Inc., and others, amici curiae in the first above-
                  entitled matter.  I.  Alcoholic Beverage Control Law § 101-bb in no way violates the Sherman Antitrust Act.  ( Matter
                  of Admiral Wine & Liq. Co. v State Liq. Auth., 61 NY2d 858; Battipaglia v New York State Liq. Auth., 745 F2d 166;
                  Rice v Williams Co., 458 U.S. 654; Matter of Mezzetti Assoc. v State Liq. Auth., 51 NY2d 761; California Liq.
                  Dealers v Midcal Aluminum, 445 U.S. 97.) II. Section 101-bb is immune from a violation of the Sherman Act under
                  the doctrine of State action as it was decided under Parker  [****12]   v Brown.  ( Parker v Brown, 317 U.S. 341;
                  Serlin Wine & Spirit Merchants v Healy, 512 F Supp 936, aff sub nom.  Morgan v Division of Liq. Control, 664 F2d
                  353.) III. The purposes of Alcoholic Beverage Control Law § 101-bb when balanced against the antitrust challenge
                  clearly weigh in favor of the State statute and as such are protected by the 21st Amendment.  ( California v LaRue,
                  409 U.S. 109; House of Spirits v Doyle, 72 Misc 2d 1036, 43 AD2d 880, 36 NY2d 815.)
                  Lawrence Kill, Steven M. Pesner, Daniel N. Sang, Scott B. Schreiber, Lee H. Karlin, Michael Whiteman and
                  Anthony A. Dean for Peerless Importers, Inc., and others, amici curiae in the first above-entitled matter.  I. Section
                  101-bb does not conflict with the Sherman Act because it does not operate through private agreements or
                  conspiracies.  ( Morgan v Division of Liq. Control, 664 F2d 353; Rice v Williams Co., 458 U.S. 654; Seagram &
                  Sons v Hostetter, 384 U.S. 35; New Motor Vehicle Bd. v Fox Co., 439 U.S. 96; Exxon Corp. v Governor of Md., 437
                  U.S.  117; Copperweld Corp. v Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S.   , 104 S Ct 2731; Fisher Foods v Ohio Dept. of
                  Liq. Control [****13]  , 555 F Supp 641; Matter of Admiral Wine & Liq. Co. v State Liq. Auth., 61 NY2d 858; Enrico's,
                  Inc. v Rice, 551 F Supp 511, 730 F2d 1250; Schnapps Shop v Wright & Co., 377 F Supp 570.) II. The restraints that
                  section 101-bb directly imposes are State action within the meaning of Parker and therefore exempt from antitrust
                  challenge.  ( Bates v State Bar of Ariz., 433 U.S. 350; Morgan v Division of Liq. Control, 664 F2d 353; Fisher Foods
                  v Ohio Dept. of Liq. Control, 555 F Supp 641; Goldfarb v Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773; California Liq. Dealers v
                  Midcal Aluminum, 445 U.S. 97; Battipaglia v New York State Liq. Auth., 745 F2d 166.) III. The 21st Amendment
                  confers an added presumption of legality to section 101-bb.  ( Battipaglia v New York State Liq. Auth., 745 F2d 166;
                  64 N.Y.2d 504, *504; 479 N.E.2d 779, **779; 490 N.Y.S.2d 143, ***143; 1985 N.Y. LEXIS 14233, ****9

                  Robert S. Hammer of counsel), for appellants in the second above-entitled matter.  I, II and III are the same as the
                  first above-entitled matter.  IV. Bulletin No. 471 has no impact on the validity of Alcoholic Beverage Control Law §
                  101-bb (2) and is otherwise in conformity with the Sherman Act and relevant provisions of the Alcoholic Beverage
                  Control Law.  ( Ahern v South Buffalo Ry. Co., 303 NY 545, affd sub nom.  South Buffalo Ry. Co. v Ahern, 344 U.S.

                  Seymour Howard for respondent in the second above-entitled matter.  I and II are the same as the first above-
                  entitled matter.  III. Where the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law prohibits wholesalers from offering quantity
                  discounts of more than 2% on [****15]  purchases of liquor by retailers, the Liquor Authority does not have the right
                  or power to permit wholesalers to circumvent that prohibition.  ( Matter of Picone v Commissioner of Licenses, 241
