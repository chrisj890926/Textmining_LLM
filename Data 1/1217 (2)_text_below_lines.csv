20,1," Section 6-4-105, 2 C.R.S. (1973), expressly authorizes injunctive proceedings to restrain or prevent violations of the provisions 
of ยง 6-4-101, 2 C.R.S. (1984 Supp.). In its prayer for relief, the State requested the following injunctive relief:"
20,3," . That the court enjoin and restrain [the Board], certain of its members and other co-conspirators from, in any manner, 
directly or indirectly, continuing, maintaining, or renewing the alleged combination and conspiracy or from engaging in any 
other combination, conspiracy, contract, agreement, understanding or concert of action having a similar purpose or effect, 
and from adopting or following any practice, plan, program or device having a similar purpose or effect . . . ."
20,5," . That the court enjoin and restrain [the Board] and its members from adopting, maintaining or enforcing any by-law, rule, 
regulation, code of ethics, or any other provision which requires that a licensed real estate broker or salesperson become a 
[Board] member before obtaining access to the MLS and the MLS Catalog."
20,6," . That the court order and direct [the Board] to admit to membership and to allow participation in the MLS to any licensed 
real estate broker or salesperson who pays a pro rata share of the fees necessary to maintain the MLS."
20,7, . That the court order such other relief as it may deem just and proper.
20,2," The district court's order is reported unofficially as State ex rel. MacFarlane v. Colorado Springs Board of Realtors, Inc., 1980-
81 Trade Cases (CCH) Para. 63,653 (Colo. Dist. Ct. 1980)."
20,3," From licensee information provided by the Colorado Real Estate Commission, the Board prepared the following statistics which 
were admitted into evidence: Total number of Licensees"
20,4," ,462 Number of Brokers"
20,752,  Number of Salesmen
20,3," ,710 Also, the Board's membership roster yielded the following evidence: Total Members "
21,1," ,799 Class A Principals [brokers]"
21,334,  Class B [sales agents]
21,1," ,465 Reported Licensees & Applicants Associated with Class A REALTORS"
21,695,"  (Non-Members) At trial, the executive vice president of the Board testified that these totals represented active Board members. It is unclear 
whether the 4,462 licensees included only those active in the real estate trade. Nor was evidence presented on the proportion of 
Board members and their associates that belong to and utilize the MLS."
21,4," In 1978, Class A members of the Board paid a $500 initiation fee and annual dues of $155. Class B members paid a $30 
initiation fee and yearly dues of $72.50. If these members were associated with an MLS member, they also paid $4.00 per 
month to the MLS. Identical yearly and monthly charges -- $72.50 and $4.00 respectively -- were assessed against MLS 
members for each non-member associated with them. Proceeds from the MLS listing fees, catalog sales and membership dues are apportioned between the Board and the MLS. For 
example, each listing submitted to the MLS costs $4.50, $2.50 of which goes to the MLS and the remaining $2.00 to the Board. 
Weekly listings catalogs sell for $ 2.80 each, of which $.08 is retained by the Board. "
22,5," In order to have property listed in the MLS catalogs, the owner must agree to an exclusive right to sell contract. Under such a 
contract, as the name implies, the listing broker reserves the exclusive right to sell the property, but other MLS members, acting 
as the listing broker's subagents, may procure the buyer in exchange for a percentage of the commission. An owner may, of 
course, market his home by himself or list his property with only one broker. The latter arrangement, known as an ""Office 
Exclusive,"" will not be published or distributed by the MLS, but MLS members must report such listings to the service. In addition 
to single-family homes and buildings with four or fewer living units, a member may list other residential property, including 
buildings of more than four living units, property of more than ten acres, farms and ranches."
22,6," The trial court's statistical findings are based upon figures compiled by the County Assessor and the State's expert witness. 
The Board assails the reliability of the statistics. It points out that the Assessor's totals reflected only transactions recorded by 
deed and omitted sales evidenced by executory contracts or installment land contracts. Furthermore, the Assessor admitted that 
his office's practice of tabulating only the most recent transaction for any single piece of property would under-count the sales of 
property that had changed hands more than once in the two-year statistical period he reported. The Assessor agreed that 
several hundred such sales could have been untallied. With respect to the totals of MLS property sales compiled by the State's expert witness, the Board notes that they were based on 
information reported by MLS members in the Sold Properties Catalogs with no verification that all MLS members reported their 
figures. Thus, the actual share of MLS-listed sales to total residential sales could be inaccurate. In this regard, we note that the 
trial court's order misreported some of the percentages reflecting this ratio as the ratio of ""co-op sales"" to total residential sales. Such errors do not necessarily invalidate the use of this statistical evidence by the trial court. The trial court could have assumed 
that the unrecorded transactions, representing only a small fraction of the total, would conform, in percentage terms, with the 
recorded ones. Moreover, even adjusting the figures in excess of the maximum error admitted by the Assessor -- i.e., adding 
1,000 to the total transaction figures -- the ratio of MLS-listed residential property sales to all county residential transactions 
remains high: 55.5% (instead of 61%) for 1979 and 68% (instead of 74.7%) for 1978. And, the ratio of ""co-op sales"" to total 
county residential sales falls just slightly: 33% (instead of 36%) for 1977 and 41.3% (instead of 46%) for 1978. The under-
reporting of MLS sales, on the other hand, could only strengthen the State's case because any increase would raise the ratio of 
MLS sales and co-op sales vis-a-vis all residential sales. The statistical evidence fully supports the basic findings of the trial 
court that most residential real estate sold in El Paso County was sold by Board members with access to the MLS and that 
residential sales comprised a major portion of all real estate transactions. "

listing services. See United States v. Realty Multi List, Inc., 629 F.2d 1351 (5th Cir. 1980); Murphy v. Alpha Realty, Inc., 1978-2

24,8," This section has not been amended since its original enactment. However, it has been reprinted in the C.R.S. Supplement to 
correct a typographical or printing error made in the preparation of C.R.S. 1973, wherein the words ""or every combination, 
conspiracy, trust, pool, agreement, or contract"" were missing from the text. "
33,1," Although plaintiffs' brief refers to Tri-Cities in the plural, many of the prior administrative and judicial opinions use the name Tri-
City. We refer to plaintiff as Tri-Cities except where the singular form is necessary to remain consistent with prior decisions."
33,2," Capital first filed a complaint with the PSC in late 1968, alleging that the tariff filed by N.Y. Tel. contained a charge against the 
mobile companies. Capital believed that it was being charged for costs for which its subscribers should have been billed directly.  
In re Capital Mobile Radio Service, Inc., 80 Pub. Util. Rep. 3d (PUR) 445, 449 (Aug. 20, 1969). The PSC disagreed, finding that 
the fees were charged against the subscribers rather than against the carrier. The PSC also refused to grant Capital's request 
that it be allowed to bill N.Y. Tel. for calls originating from landline companies and received at mobile units.  Id. at 452-53. Tri-Cities filed a complaint with the FCC in 1969 requesting that N.Y. Tel. be required to interconnect with it on the same terms 
as it did with Tri-Cities' competitors. In re Petition of Tri-City Telephone Company, FCC No. 18741 (Recommended decision 
Nov. 17, 1972), J. App. at 285. The FCC denied the complaint, finding that Tri-Cities' operation at the time did not merit the 
establishment of a central office like those of its competitors. J. App. at 296. The FCC also rejected Tri-Cities' request that N.Y. 
Tel. divide revenues with it on the same basis as with Pattersonville Telephone Co., a landline company. The FCC noted that the 
costs of a landline company's mobile operations are not considered when revenue divisions are calculated, so that the 
calculations are not comparable. J. App. at 297. "
34,," Capital filed another complaint with the PSC in 1970, requesting that its arrangements with N.Y. Tel. be revised. Hearings were 
held for six days between 1970 and 1972. The PSC found that the evidence did not support Capital's claims of discrimination 
and anticompetitive action. Pub. Serv. Comm'n Op. No. 73-8 (Mar. 12, 1973), J. App. at 212, 229. The PSC ordered N.Y. Tel. to 
continue to offer direct dial interconnection services to RCCs, but ordered Capital to pay for the services it had received. Stating 
that the relationship between RCCs and N.Y. Tel. was different than that between landline companies and the telephone 
company, the PSC found that the record disclosed no evidence of discrimination by N.Y. Tel. Id. at 231-32. Pursuant to a recommendation by the PSC in the 1973 action, Tri-Cities filed a petition for a certificate of public convenience and 
necessity. The PSC granted the certificate but rejected the toll revenue division plan offered by Tri-Cities because the marine 
service provided by Tri-Cities was not similar enough to landline service to allow toll division based on the standard formula. 
Pub. Serv. Comm'n Op. No. 74-21 (July 1, 1974), J. App. at 266-67. Next, Tri-Cities filed suit in the Appellate Division of the state supreme court requesting that the Commission's decision 
concerning the interconnection agreement be reversed.  Tri-City Telephone Co. v. Alfred E. Kahn, 49 A.D.2d 126, 373 N.Y.S.2d 
655 (1975). Noting that the applicable standard of review was a limited one, the court upheld the PSC's decision.  Id. at 129. In May 1978 Capital and Bakal again filed complaints with the PSC. J. App. at 329. These complaints contained allegations of 
""illegal, preferential and anticompetitive conduct"" by N.Y. Tel. favoring plaintiffs' competitor, Pattersonville. Id. In a memo the 
Communications Division informed the PSC that the complaints were without merit. J. App. at 333. The Communications 
Division believed that the comparison between Bakal's services and those of Pattersonville was not appropriate and that 
Bakal/Capital were not being treated differently from any other RCC. Id. at 334, 336. Less than a year later, Capital, Bakal and Tri-Cities filed complaints with the FCC. These complaints were substantially similar to 
the 1978 PSC complaints. J. App. at 325-28. In April 1979 these complaints were dismissed. J. App. at 337. In February 1980, Capital, Bakal and Tri-Cities unsuccessfully petitioned this Court for an evidentiary hearing in a motion which 
essentially repeated the allegations of the prior administrative complaints. J. App. at 314. A similar complaint and request for 
hearing was filed with the FCC in May 1980. In May 1982 the FCC responded. Capital Telephone Co., Inc. v. New York 
Telephone Co., File No. E-80-17 (May 14, 1982). J. App. at 377. The FCC dismissed the complaint as to all allegations except 
those concerning discrimination in the use of direct distance dialing (DDD). As to those charges, the PSC ordered that access to 
the DDD network be provided to Capital at the same cost as to N.Y. Tel.'s own mobile service. J. App. at 382. "
36,3," The plaintiffs argued strenuously that an additional ""compulsion"" requirement applies, thereby making it necessary to find that 
the specific acts in question were compelled by the State of New York. The Fifth Circuit has embraced this requirement. See 
United States v. Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conf., Inc., 702 F.2d 532 (5th Cir., Unit B. 1983) (en banc), cert. granted, 467 
U.S. 1240, 82 L. Ed. 2d 818, 104 S. Ct. 3508, 52 U.S.L.W. 3891 (1984). In the Supreme Court's latest consideration of state action immunity, the Court's language indicates that no compulsion 
requirement should be read into the standard.  Hoover v. Ronwin, 466 U.S. 558, 80 L. Ed. 2d 590, 104 S. Ct. 1989, 52 U.S.L.W. 
4535, 4538 (1984). "
37,," Closer analysis is required when the activity at issue is not directly that of the legislature or supreme court, but is carried out 
by others pursuant to state authorization. . . . In such cases, it becomes important to ensure that the anticompetitive 
conduct of the State's representative was contemplated by the State. . . . If the replacing of entirely free competition with 
some form of regulation or restraint was not authorized or approved by the State then the rationale of Parker is inapposite. Id. at 4538 (footnote omitted; emphasis added). This language suggests that the Court does not intend that compulsion be 
required. The Sixth and Ninth Circuits apparently agree. See Hybud Equipment Corp. v. City of Akron, 742 F.2d 949 (6th Cir. 
1984) (applying two part Midcal test; no compulsion requirement included); United States v. Title Ins. Rating Bureau of Ariz., 
Inc., 700 F.2d 1247, 1252-53 (9th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 467 U.S. 1240, 82 L. Ed. 2d 819, 104 S. Ct. 3509, 52 U.S.L.W. 3891 
(1984) (same). This view is endorsed by antitrust scholars. See Areeda, Antitrust Immunity for ""State Action"" After Lafayette, 95 
Harv. L. Rev. 435, 438 (1981) (""Compulsion, however, should not be read as an independent requirement for state action 
immunity; rather, its presence or absence should serve only as strong evidence about state intent.""); Handler, Antitrust-1978, 78 
Colum. L. Rev. 1363, 1384 (1978) (courts' use of compulsion as a requirement is ""overreaction""); Morgan, Antitrust and State 
Regulation: Standards of Immunity After Midcal, 35 Ark. L. Rev. 453, 467-68 (1981) (compulsion was not included in the Court's 
statement of the standards but ""it is likely to remain as a factor, presumably under the first standard""). Contrary to appellants' assertion, this Circuit has never expressly adopted the compulsion requirement. See Litton Systems, Inc. 
v. AT & T, 487 F. Supp. 942 (S.D.N.Y. 1980), aff'd on other grounds, 700 F.2d 785 (2d Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 1073, 
79 L. Ed. 2d 220, 104 S. Ct. 984, 52 U.S.L.W. 3534 (1984) (district court discussed compulsion, but based decision on 
alternative grounds as well; this Court never reached issue); New York State Electric & Gas Corp. v. F.E.R.C., 638 F.2d 388 (2d 
Cir. 1980), cert. denied sub nom.  Village of Penn Yan v. New York State Electric & Gas Corp., 454 U.S. 821, 70 L. Ed. 2d 
93, 102 S. Ct. 105 (1981) (applying Midcal test, Court finds insufficient evidence of state policy; in dictum refers to Goldfarb's 
compulsion requirement as evidence of level of involvement which would be necessary). In fact, our most recent consideration of 
the question adheres to the two part test. See Battipaglia v. New York State Liquor Auth., 745 F.2d 166 (2d Cir. Sept. 21, 1984) 
(evaluating state action immunity as alternative holding of district court, but declining to rule on it; citing two part Midcal test as 
applicable standard). In line with our past decisions, our analysis proceeds according to the two part Midcal standard."
37,4," There is no question that this regulatory scheme applies to RCCs such as appellants herein. New York's courts have held that 
the regulation of RCCs is within the jurisdiction of the PSC. See Application of Radio Common Carriers of New York, Inc. v. 
Public Serv. Comm'n, 79 Misc. 2d 600, 360 N.Y.S.2d 552 (Special Term, 1974), aff'd, 48 A.D.2d 756, 368 N.Y.S.2d 341 (1975); 
In re Digital Paging Systems, Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 46 A.D.2d 92, 360 N.Y.S.2d 931 (1974). "
40,5," The PSC also has authority to inspect ""property, equipment, buildings, plants, factories, offices, apparatus, machines, devices 
and lines,"" ยง 94.2, and to develop accounting systems, ยง 95.2. In addition, the PSC must provide for management and 
operations audits at least once every five years, ยง 96.6, and may order repairs and improvements in equipment or facilities, ยง 98; 
approve the lease, assignment or sale of a franchise, ยง 99.2; and allow telephone corporations to acquire or purchase stock in 
other similar entities, ยง 101."
40,6," The dissent misinterprets our analysis to hold that regulations that satisfy the second prong of the Midcal test must necessarily 
satisfy the first. Our analysis of the ""state policy"" prong incorporates evidence of legislative intent found in both the scheme itself 
and in recent legislative activity. Where the regulatory scheme demonstrates that the state actively supervises the telephone industry, we need not look to wholly 
different sources to find support for first prong analysis. Where no clear expression of state policy exists, we may look to the 
breadth of the regulatory scheme, as a demonstration of the legislature's delegation of authority, in conducting our first prong "
41,," Midcal analysis.  Hybud Equipment Corp. v. City of Akron, 742 F.2d 949, 960 (6th Cir. 1984) (""a legislative intent to displace 
competition may be inferred from the legislature's delegation of authority""). Our use of this particular regulatory scheme in 
evaluating both prongs of the Midcal test in no way suggests that satisfaction of one prong requires satisfaction of the other. The dissent also fails to credit our use of other evidence to support our finding, specifically, the legislature's recent action 
concerning the telegraph industry. While regulation alone is not enough to provide exemption from the antitrust laws, here there 
is more than mere regulation. "
42,7," We note that New York's courts have interpreted the application of state antitrust laws to the Public Service Law differently. See 
Capital Telephone Co. v. Pattersonville Telephone Co., 56 N.Y.2d 11, 18, 451 N.Y.S.2d 11, 14, 436 N.E.2d 461 (1982). 
Although proper application of the state action immunity doctrine should include consideration of state judicial decisions, we 
believe that a federal court may reexamine the issue precisely because the doctrine is based on the principles of federalism. We disagree with the dissent in its belief that Pattersonville mandates a different result. We read that case to hold only that a 
""not illegal"" ruling by the PSC does not collaterally estop the plaintiff from filing suit under the state antitrust laws. See Columbia 
Gas v. New York State Electric and Gas Corp., 28 N.Y.2d 117, 128-29, 320 N.Y.S.2d 57, 66, 268 N.E.2d 790 (1971) (holding 
that failure to assert per se antitrust violation does not prevent fact-based, rule of reason analysis of antitrust allegations). We do 
not agree that the Pattersonville Court's decision in this limited context provides incontrovertible evidence of an affirmative state 
policy. In the absence of a clear statement of legislative intent, we cannot view this decision as more powerful than the recent 
legislative action deregulating the telegraph industry, but retaining regulatory authority over the telephone industry. The 
legislature has not taken advantage of the opportunity to repeal the application of L. 1981, c. 414, ยง 2; nor has it expanded the 
1981 act to include the telephone industry. New York's legislature of course remains free to bring the actions of the state 
telephone industry within the scope of federal antitrust laws. "
43,1," There may be limits other than those expressed in Midcal on a state's ability to impose a regime of economic regulation that 
conflicts with the principle of free competition mandated by the Sherman Act. For example, Judge Greene, in United States v. 
American Tel. & Tel. Co., 552 F. Supp. 131, 157-58 (D. D.C. 1982), aff'd, 460 U.S. 1001, 103 S. Ct. 1240, 75 L. Ed. 2d 472 
(1983), suggested that state action immunity may be unavailable where the industry involved is by its nature ""technologically and 
economically, a national network with interdependent components"" -- such as the telephone industry. "
45,2," As a general proposition, the interpretation of a state's law by the highest court of that state is conclusive.  Scripto, Inc. v. 
Carson, 362 U.S. 207, 211, 4 L. Ed. 2d 660, 80 S. Ct. 619 (1960); General Trading Co. v. State Tax Commission, 322 U.S. 335, 
337, 88 L. Ed. 1309, 64 S. Ct. 1028 (1944); Sutter Butte Canal Co. v. Railroad Commission, 279 U.S. 125, 139, 73 L. Ed. 637, 
49 S. Ct. 325 (1929). This rule, of course, is inapplicable when acceptance of such an interpretation would thwart vindication of a 
constitutional right, Indiana ex rel. Anderson v. Brand, 303 U.S. 95, 100, 82 L. Ed. 685, 58 S. Ct. 443 (1938), but such a situation 
is not present here. "
53,*," Hon. William J. Campbell of the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by designation. "
64,1," The American defendants are Pan American World Airways, Inc., (Pan Am), Trans World Airlines, Inc. (TWA), McDonnell 
Douglas Corporation (McDonnell Douglas), and McDonnell Douglas Finance Corporation (McDonnell Finance). The initial 
foreign defendants were British Airways, Deutsche Lufthansa Aktiengesellschaft (Lufthansa), Swiss Air Transport Company 
Limited (Swissair), and British Caledonian. "
65,2, The action also sought a declaration of non-liability to Laker.
65,3," An earlier declaratory judgment action had been filed against Laker in the same court by Midland Bank PLC. Midland brought 
the action in anticipation of being named a defendant in the proceedings before this Court, and it sought a declaration that it was 
not party to any unlawful combination and was not liable in connection with the events which led to the collapse of Laker. 
Midland sought and obtained an ex parte interim injunction which restrained Laker inter alia from ""instituting or continuing legal 
proceedings against [Midland] whether in the United States (whether as defendant to the Civil Action now proceeding in the 
United States District Court for the District of Columbia between Laker Airways as plaintiff and Pan-American World Airways Inc. 
and others as defendants, or otherwise) or elsewhere, other than in the Courts of England for relief or otherwise in any way in 
connection with any alleged unlawful combination or conspiracy . . ."" On February 4, 1983, this injunction was continued pending 
trial in Midland's case. According to Laker's briefs, this injunction is still in effect to this day, and a hearing on Laker's request to 
have it lifted will not be held until May 15, 1985."
65,4," Mr. Justice Parker of the High Court, who originally issued the injunctions, vacated them after a hearing, on March 29, 1983, 
but one day later they were reinstated pending appeal by order of the Master of Rolls."
65,5," The injunctions against Laker with respect to Lufthansa and Swissair expired on October 21, 1983, but these two airlines 
continue to seek permanent injunctions and declaratory relief in their British actions.  Laker is still enjoined by the British courts 
from seeking any order in the action in this Court which would prevent Lufthansa and Swissair from proceeding with their British 
suit. Laker Response Brief at 2-3."
65,6," The injunction against UTA and SAS prohibited action ""before a foreign court or any other foreign government authority."" "
66,7," Defendants do not contest the Court's power to issue the injunction if the ""or otherwise"" language is deleted."
66,8," The British airlines engaged in this effort notwithstanding the fact that both they and Laker have long conducted business in this 
country, and that they continue to do business here on a significant scale, enjoying the protection of American law and the 
American courts for their business enterprises which include landing rights, ticket offices, and advertising campaigns addressed 
to millions of Americans."
66,9," The proper procedure for determining whether a court has the authority to hear a particular case is, of course, a challenge to 
jurisdiction filed in that court followed, if necessary, by appeals to higher tribunals. United States v. United Mine Workers, 330 
U.S. 258, 291, 67 S. Ct. 677, 694, 91 L. Ed. 884 (1947); Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 12(b); Wright, Law of Federal 
Courts ยง 16 (1976). Furthermore, as the Court of Appeals has noted, ""a defendant's claims that foreign law forbids a foreign 
national from prosecuting a United States antitrust action should be made initially in the United States District Court free from the 
coercive threat of a possible antisuit injunction."" Laker Airways v. Sabena, supra, 731 F.2d at 939 n.110."
66,10," Laker Airways v. Pan American Airways, 577 F. Supp. 348, 354-55 (D.D.C.1983). To end this paralysis, the Court ultimately 
appointed an amicus curiae to advise on the steps that might be taken to proceed with the lawsuit in the face of Laker's 
disability. The report of amicus curiae was filed February 28, 1984. In view of the action of the House of Lords, it has not been 
necessary to consider further that report and its recommendations. "
67,11," The English Secretary of State issued orders and directives under the Protection of Trading Interests Act to prevent disclosure

Ed. 2d 513 (1972). The antisuit injunction precedents also dispose of defendants' contention that, whatever may otherwise be appropriate, a court 
may not interfere with free speech by a prior restraint. An antisuit injunction is, of course, precisely that. See also Sheppard v. 
Maxwell, supra, where the Supreme Court stated that ""the trial court might well have proscribed extrajudicial statements by any 
lawyer, party, witness, or court official which divulged prejudicial matters . . .; any statements made . . . to officials; the identity of 
prospective witnesses or their possible testimony; any belief in guilt or innocence; or like statements concerning the merits of the

71,39," There is no case authority directly on point -- a circumstance which defendants make much of. The reason no such authority 
exists is simple: until now no one appears to have embarked upon so bold and unusual a scheme to vitiate existing jurisdiction. "
72,40," Indeed, it may be expected that, in such a situation, the United States courts, like the House of Lords, would set parochial 
concerns aside and act in accordance with legal principle."
72,41," Similarly, at the domestic level, an individual litigant in, say, the Commonwealth of Virginia would obviously not be acting 
improperly if he sought to have a lower court decision overturned by the legislature or the highest court of that state. However, 
such a litigant could be prohibited by court order from seeking to achieve that result by application to the legislative body or the 
courts of the State of Maryland."

interfering with a plaintiff's right of access to the court ( California Motor Transport v. Trucking Unlimited, supra, Cruz v. Beto, 
supra), and attempts to interfere would be subject to review by the Judiciary. No such safeguards attach to successful lobbying

4(2)-(3)) or to punish by contempt publications, which create a ""substantial risk that the course of justice in the proceedings in 
question will be seriously impeded or prejudiced"" (S. 2(2)). This law applies to ""any speech, writing, broadcast or other

Defamation Act of 1952, id. at 34."
73,47," British Caledonian's claim that an injunction here would violate the non-intervention principles of the Helsinki Accords 
illustrates the recklessness of defendants' arguments. The non-intervention principles enshrined in these Accords specifically 
refer to armed intervention; military, political, or economic coercion against another state; and assistance to terrorist or 
subversive activities directed towards the violent overthrow of the regime of a participating state. Article VI. It is difficult to fathom 
on what basis a party might equate any of those proscribed activities with this Court's attempt to maintain its jurisdiction to 
enforce valid, domestic law with respect to parties properly before the Court. And it is particularly ironic that such an argument is 
made by a party that has successfully used foreign court intervention to prevent normal judicial processes from operating for a 
period of some eighteen months."

legitimate jurisdiction and laws against interference by foreign governmental action."

74,54," In this regard, the Court regrets to note, however, that Laker is still subject to various injunctions in Britain (see e.g., notes 3 
and 5, supra), and that Laker is also seriously restricted in its ability to engage in discovery with respect to this lawsuit as a 
consequence both of acts of the British government and of those of various other governments which control some of the other "
75,," defendant airlines. Nevertheless, whatever others may do, this Court will continue to be scrupulous in proceeding in accordance 
with internationally-recognized principles of comity."
75,55," One of the factors a United States court may consider in determining whether comity should operate with respect to another 
nation is whether that nation operates under civilized standards, and whether that nation behaves in a reciprocal fashion towards 
the United States.  Hilton v. Guyot, 159 U.S. 113, 16 S. Ct. 139, 40 L. Ed. 95 (1895)."
75,56," Criminal legislation is the only type of action by the British government defendants have mentioned in these proceedings. The 
principles which here apply would, however, be equally applicable if the interference took the form of civil laws or penalties or 
administrative regulation."
75,57," The extension of comity in these circumstances is buttressed by the presence here of two other Mannington Mills factors: (1) 
the foreseeability of the harm to United States interests and (2) the effectiveness of an order by this Court in these peculiar 
circumstances. As stated above, principles of comity, which apply in Great Britain as they do here, may be expected to restrain British executive 
and legislative bodies from taking steps to interfere with properly-constituted proceedings in United States courts. Although the 
British government has some pecuniary interest in the outcome of this case, it may be regarded as unlikely that commercial 
considerations would lead Britain to ignore considerations of comity and to interfere with what is now the clearly-established 
jurisdiction of this Court. Thus, harm to United States interests from action in Great Britain is less likely, i.e., less foreseeable. As for the element of effectiveness, it would obviously be difficult for this Court to police contacts between these defendants and 
the British government or to determine who originated those contacts. By contrast, the Court could easily determine whether a 
defendant filed a lawsuit in the British courts, since such a filing would be an open, discrete act."
75,58," This course is also appropriate because it does not leave the Court without a remedy if, contrary to all expectations, the British 
legislative or executive authorities, with or without urging from these defendants, take action or threaten to take action inimical to 
the Court's jurisdiction. Such a remedy could take the form of the appointment of others (e.g., a receiver, a committee of 
creditors) to carry on the lawsuit in Laker's place, or it might consist of the imposition of sanctions against the defendants, 
including, if necessary, a default. See Laker Airways v. Sabena, supra, 731 F.2d at 941 n. 118; Societe Internationale v. Rogers, 
357 U.S. 197, 78 S. Ct. 1087, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1255 (1958); United States v. Vetco, 691 F.2d 1281 (9th Cir.1981). See also Report of

83,2," At the hearing on the plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction, the parties entered an agreed order continuing the effect of 
said order through December 22, 1984."
83,3," Billy Joe Smith also signed as a partner in what was at that time Gilchrist-Smith Tractor Company. Soon after the execution of 
this agreement, however, Smith withdrew from the business and the company assumed the name, Gilchrist Machinery 
Company, Inc."
83,4, That the advertising program was voluntary is shown by the fact that Gilchrist chose not to participate in 1982. 
84,5," The court attaches no significance to the fact that the memos were originally written in Japanese, the native language of Endo 
and the KAC president."
84,6," The letter stated: We calculate that Gilchrist Machinery is getting a tractor market share combined in both territories of approximately 4.1% 
for 1982. In our studies of the placements, we found that your Jackson store had approximately 6.7% of the market and 
your Princeton store had only 1.57% of the bulldozer market for 1982. Our company feels that each operation should have 
a minimum of 10% of the available market in its local trade area."
84,7," Basing the statistics on sales of new machinery (""first in the dirt"") gives a more accurate representation of each manufacturer's 
market share. The market share data submitted by Gilchrist Machinery evidently included other transactions, hence the 
difference in percentages. "
85,8," By 1982, KAC reports show that the cancellation of Gilchrist Machinery was being considered. The company had also 
considered terminating the franchise of H & E. H & E was removed from the cancellation list after successful efforts to improve 
its market performance. Therefore, the court concludes that the listing of Gilchrist Machinery as a prospect for cancellation was 
not conclusive."
85,9," The letter stated: For 1982 Gilchrist Machinery obtained approximately 4.1% market share for Mississippi and North Louisiana combined. 
Through June of 1983 Gilchrist Machinery has been able to raise this figure to only 5%. In our calculation of 1982 figures, 
we showed that your Jackson store had approximately 6.7% of the market and your Louisiana store had approximately 
1.57% of the market. Through June of this year we calculate your Jackson store to have approximately 7.5% of the market 
and your Louisiana store has approximately 2.1% of the available market."
85,10," At the hearing, Gilchrist did not specify the inaccuracies in the report."
85,11," This suit was filed in February 1984, and the parties have been in the discovery process since that time. They have 
represented to the court that discovery should be completed in February of 1985. Therefore, the plaintiff has access to more 
evidence than a party would in a hearing for preliminary injunction, which is generally held soon after the suit is filed and prior to 
any discovery. "
86,12," Monsanto dealt with a vertical price fixing restraint. Viewed narrowly, the test set out by the Court is limited to that context. The 
Court's rationale was based in part on the need of manufacturers to communicate freely with dealers and to investigate 
complaints without fear of antitrust liability. The same reasoning applies to the KAC restraint which this court determines to be 
non price-related. It is arguable that a less demanding test is applicable when review is governed by the rule of reason rather 
than the per se rule as was the case in Monsanto. In any event, this court cannot find, on the basis of the evidence presented by 
the plaintiffs, that the termination of Gilchrist Machinery was the result of concerted action between KAC and other distributors."
86,13," In 1982, an area sales representative became aware that Gilchrist Machinery and another distributor were bidding on a project 
in the other dealer's territory. The representative's weekly report stated that he took a ""low profile"" regarding the transaction. 
Although KAC may not have been pleased with sales outside a distributor's territory, it appears that such were not grounds for 
termination."
86,14," The claims of threats are not supported by employees of Gilchrist Machinery or by depositions or interoffice memoranda of 
KAC employees."
86,15, The plaintiff does not dispute KAC's evidence regarding Gilchrist Machinery's financial status. 
87,16, KAC admits that it discourages extraterritorial sales but denies it has a policy absolutely prohibiting them.

] Horizontal agreements are among competitors at 
the same level of distribution.  Transource International, Inc. v. Trinity Industries, Inc., 725 F.2d 274, 279 (5th Cir. 1984). 
Although the plaintiff alleges that its competitors are part of the conspiracy, vertical restriction analysis is applicable. ""HN8[
] 
Conspiracies between a manufacturer and its distributors are only treated as horizontal . . . when the source of the conspiracy is 
a combination of the distributors."" H & B Equipment Co. v. International Harvester Co., 577 F.2d 239, 245 (5th Cir. 1978)."

514 (1958)."
87,19," KAC's proof supports its contention that the credit restrictions and discounts were unrelated to Gilchrist Machinery's sales 
outside its territory. Gilchrist Machinery's poor credit record and its own admission of undercapitalization point to the conclusion 
that the restrictions were necessary to protect KAC's position and were not imposed in futherance of any anticompetitive 
conspiracy. "
88,20," ""HN11[
] Interbrand competition is the competition among manufacturers of the same generic product . . . and is the primary 
concern of antitrust law. . . . In contrast, intrabrand competition is the competition between distributors - wholesale or retail - of

88,21," ""This agreement and all of its terms and conditions shall be governed, construed, and enforced in accordance with the laws of 
the State of California."""
88,22, The plaintiff also argues that the agreement violates the Act in not providing the franchisee with an opportunity to cure. 
90,23," The court notes that Gilchrist Machinery has made several attempts since 1980 to sell its business. Furthermore, after receipt 
of the termination letter, Gilchrist wrote KAC regarding the sale of its facilities to the replacement dealer. The majority of machines sold by Gilchrist Machinery since January 1984, have been from the company's rental fleet. Therefore, 
termination of the franchise will not impair these continued sales."
90,24," The alleged decrease, according to the plaintiff, would in part be caused by the termination of Gilchrist Machinery as the 
distributor for other manufacturers of heavy equipment. The evidence does not show that Gilchrist Machinery would indeed be 
cancelled as a result of its termination by KAC. "
91,25," The plaintiff also alleges that it will lose the reputation and goodwill established during the term of its franchise. Goodwill and 
reputation are based on a dealer's ability to delivery reliable and courteous service. Consequently, Gilchrist Machinery should be 
able to uphold its reputation even if the franchise is terminated since the court determines that the company will not be forced 
out of business by the termination."
91,26," The defendant contends that the court would be called on during the course of a preliminary injunction to mediate differences 
between the parties. The plaintiff points out that this has not been necessary during the past eight months when the agreed 
order has been in effect. KAC has stated, however, that it will discontinue the special treatment given to Gilchrist Machinery 
during the term of the agreed order. Because of this, the court would anticipate requests for court intervention from both parties 
should the preliminary injunction issue. While this is not a controlling factor in its decision, the court notes that it is not competent 
to operate a heavy equipment franchise. "

114,1," The base rent ceiling is the rent as of May 31, 1980.  Regarding rental units for which there was no periodic rent in effect on 
that date, or during the six months preceding that date, the base rent ceiling is a ""good faith estimate"" of the median rent in effect 
for comparable units in the City of Berkeley on May 31, 1980. "
115,2," While the case was pending on appeal the Berkeley electorate enacted the ""Tenants' Rights Amendments Act of 1982,"" 
revising certain sections of the ordinance, including two sections relevant to our inquiry in this case: section 11, quoted post at 
pages 687-689, footnote 44, and section 14, quoted post at page 693, footnote 54.  Although the amendment was not before the 
trial court at the time it held the ordinance facially constitutional, any issues that may arise as a result of the amendments are 
questions of law and thus may be properly resolved by this court in determining facial validity.  Therefore we will review the 
regulation as amended."
115,3," HN4[
] It is well settled that a court will consider on appeal a new point of law decided while the appeal is pending.  ( Claremont Imp. Club v. Buckingham (1948) 89 Cal.App.2d 32, 33 [200 P.2d 47].) Although prior to Boulder there existed a 
plausible basis for alleging a municipal regulation to be in conflict with antitrust laws pursuant to City of Lafayette v. Louisiana 
Power & Light Co. (1978) 435 U.S. 389 [55 L.Ed.2d 364, 98 S.Ct. 1123] (discussed post, pp. 658-659), that case involved 
proprietary, rather than regulatory conduct, and hence such a claim could not reasonably have been expected to survive 
demurrer.  In a real sense, therefore, the spectre of antitrust scrutiny of municipal regulatory conduct first arose in Boulder. HN5[
] It is also established that on appeal from judgments granting or denying an injunction, the court applies the law that is 
current at the time of the decision.  ( Cal-Dak Co. v. Sav-On Drugs, Inc. (1953) 40 Cal.2d 492, 496-497 [254 P.2d 497]

673 [177 Cal.Rptr. 690].) Further, we have held that parties may advance new theories on appeal when the issue posed is 
purely a question of law based on undisputed facts, and involves important questions of public policy.  ( Frink v. Prod (1982) 31 
Cal.3d 166, 170 [181 Cal.Rptr. 893, 643 P.2d 476] (plurality decision); Carman v. Alvord (1982) 31 Cal.3d 318, 324 [182 
Cal.Rptr. 506, 644 P.2d 192]; UFITEC, S.A. v. Carter (1977) 20 Cal.3d 238, 249, fn. 2 [142 Cal.Rtpr. 279, 571 P.2d 990]; Wong 
v. Di Grazia (1963) 60 Cal.2d 525, 532, fn. 9 [35 Cal.Rptr. 241, 386 P.2d 817]; Tyre v. Aetna Life Ins. Co. (1960) 54 Cal.2d 399, 
405 [6 Cal.Rptr. 13, 353 P.2d 725]; Burdette v. Rollefson Construction Co. (1959) 52 Cal.2d 720, 725-726 [344 P.2d 307].) In Di 
Grazia, supra, we rejected defendants' contention that because an issue regarding the rule against perpetuities had not been 
raised at trial, it would be improper for this court to address the question on appeal.  Justice Tobriner, writing for the court, 
suggested that defendants' contention was meritless, and that ""in any event, the issue as to the rule against perpetuities [is of] 
considerable public interest; it has been fully argued before this court; we, accordingly, dispose of the issue on its merits."" (60 
Cal.2d 525, 532, fn. 9.) We believe that the validity of municipal rent controls under antitrust law raises extremely significant 
issues of public policy and public interest.  (See, e.g., Goodrich, The Limits of Municipal Power (Mar. 1984) 4 Cal.Law. 26; 
Spiegel, Local Governments and the Terror of Antitrust (1983) 69 A.B.A.J. 163.) "
116,4," We are aware that some decisions broadly declare that ""state courts have no jurisdiction to construe or enforce the federal 
antitrust laws."" ( Classen v. Weller (1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 27, 34, fn. 2 [192 Cal.Rptr. 914] [concession by counsel]; Union Oil v. 
Chandler (1970) 4 Cal.App.3d 716, 726 [84 Cal.Rptr. 756].) Plaintiffs in this case, however, do not seek a private remedy against 
defendants; instead, they seek to enjoin enforcement of a local regulation alleged to be facially unconstitutional under the 
supremacy clause.  It is clear that state courts may both construe and ""enforce"" the federal antitrust statutes for the purpose of 
ruling on such facial attacks.  ( Rice v. Norman Williams Co. (1982) 458 U.S. 654, 658, fn. 4 [73 L.Ed.2d 1042, 1049, 102 S.Ct. 
3294] revg. on other grounds Norman Williams Co. v. Rice (1980) 108 Cal.App.3d 348, 354, fn. 2 [166 Cal.Rptr. 563].) We do 
not construe Classen or Union Oil to suggest that state courts lack jurisdiction to review facial attacks premised on alleged 
conflict with federal antitrust laws. "
117,5," In Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar (1975) 421 U.S. 773 [44 L.Ed.2d 572, 95 S.Ct. 2004], the court held minimum fee schedules 
for lawyers enforced by the state bar subject to scrutiny under the Act.  The state bar's status as an agent of the state supreme 
court did not make its fee schedule ""state action"" because such anticompetitive conduct was not ""compelled by direction of the 
State acting as a sovereign."" ( Id. at p. 791 [44 L.Ed.2d at p. 587].) The court again denied protection from antitrust scrutiny in 
Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co. (1976) 428 U.S. 579 [49 L.Ed.2d 1141, 96 S.Ct. 3110]. In that case the state public utility 
commission approved an anticompetitive tariff requiring the defendant to provide its customers ""free"" light bulbs.  Rejecting the 
utility's argument that commission approval ""compelled"" it to operate the light bulb distribution program despite its 
anticompetitive effects, the court held that mere approval was insufficient to invoke state action protection because it signified 
only state neutrality toward the conduct in question.  ( Id. at p. 585 [49 L.Ed.2d at pp. 1146-1147].) In the following year, the court recognized state action protection in Bates v. State Bar of Arizona (1977) 433 U.S. 350 [53 
L.Ed.2d 810, 97 S.Ct. 2691]. In Bates the state supreme court, acting as the state's ultimate authority over the practice of law, 
promulgated American Bar Association-sponsored disciplinary rules banning lawyer advertising.  The United States Supreme 
Court held that ""[although] the State Bar plays a part in the enforcement of the rules, its role is completely defined by the court; 
the [State Bar] acts as the agent of the court under its continuous supervision."" ( Id. at p. 361 [53 L.Ed.2d at p. 822].) The court 
concluded that the state's anticompetitive policy was ""clearly and affirmatively expressed"" ( id. at p. 362 [53 L.Ed.2d at p. 822]), 
and that the state bar's conduct was sufficiently compelled by the state to warrant protection from antitrust scrutiny.  ( Id. at p. 
363 [53 L.Ed.2d at pp. 822-823].) In New Motor Veh. Bd. of Cal. v. Orrin W. Fox, Co. (1978) 439 U.S. 96 [58 L.Ed.2d 361, 99 S.Ct. 403], and California Retail 
Liquor Dealers Ass'n v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc. (1980) 445 U.S. 97 [63 L.Ed.2d 233, 100 S.Ct. 937], the court again addressed 
the state action exemption as it applies to private business enterprises.  In Orrin Fox the court held that a state-imposed scheme 
that restricted intrabrand competition in the sale of new automobiles was exempt from scrutiny under the antitrust laws because 
the program operated under ""clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed"" legislative guidelines.  (439 U.S. at p. 109 [58 
L.Ed.2d at p. 376].) In Midcal, on the other hand, the court held that a state-imposed maximum resale price maintenance 
system, affecting all wine producers and wholesalers in this state, was not exempt from antitrust laws. Although the scheme was 
""'clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy,'"" it was not ""'actively supervised' by the State itself."" (445 U.S. at 
p. 105 [63 L.Ed.2d at p. 243], quoting Lafayette, supra, 435 U.S. 389, 410 [55 L.Ed.2d 364, 381] (plur. opn.).) Most recently, in Hoover v. Ronwin (1984) 466 U.S. 558 [80 L.Ed.2d 590, 104 S.Ct. 1989], the court, on a four-to-three vote, 
found Arizona state bar examiners exempt from antitrust scrutiny.  The majority held the examiners' actions constituted action of 
the sovereign itself, and hence exempt from antitrust scrutiny under Parker (id. at p. -- [80 L.Ed.2d at p. 599, 104 S.Ct. at p. 
1995]). Therefore, the majority found it unnecessary to consider whether the alleged anticompetitive policy was ""clearly 
articulated"" or ""actively supervised."" ( Id. at p. -- [80 L.Ed.2d at pp. 599-600, 104 S.Ct. at pp. 1995-1996].) "
118,6," Four justices dissenting, led by Justice Stewart, maintained that exemption applied because ""petitioners are governmental 
bodies, not private persons, and their actions are '[acts] of government' which Parker v. Brown held are not subject to the 
Sherman Act."" (435 U.S. at p. 426 [55 L.Ed.2d at p. 391].)"
118,7," Plaintiff was assignee of a 20-year, revocable, nonexclusive permit to conduct a cable television business within the city limits.  
(455 U.S. at p. 44 [70 L.Ed.2d at p. 814].) "
119,8," Justice Rehnquist, writing for the dissent in Boulder, correctly noted that the Parker court cast its decision in the language of 
preemption.  ( Parker, supra, 317 U.S. 341, 351 [87 L.Ed. 315, 326].) Parker, which was a suit to enjoin enforcement of a state 
statute, has been characterized by Boulder and Lafayette, however, as establishing a state action exemption from antitrust laws. 
(455 U.S. 40, 43 [70 L.Ed.2d 810, 814]; 435 U.S. 389, 394 [55 L.Ed.2d 364, 371].) Unlike Parker, both of these latter cases were 
private antitrust suits for damages, not invalidation of a regulation. In the court's most recent case in this area, Rice v. Norman 
Williams Co. (1982) supra, 458 U.S. 654, the plaintiffs sought to enjoin enforcement of one of this state's liquor statutes.  
Consistently with Parker, the court framed its analysis in terms of preemption.  In view of these cases, we agree with plaintiffs 
and amici that the question in the present appeal is whether defendants' regulation conflicts with, and hence is preempted by, 
the Sherman Act. "
120,9," In this regard, we must also reject defendants' attempt to distinguish Boulder on the ground that the city in that case stood to 
acquire revenues from its franchise awards.  Again, it must be noted that the challenged activity in Boulder concerned not 
collection of franchise fees, but merely the city's imposition, under its regulatory powers, of a three-month moratorium on 
expansion of petitioner's franchise.  Nowhere in the court's majority, concurring, or dissenting opinions is it even suggested that 
resolution of the case rested on defendants' ""revenue generating"" theory.  If in fact the United States Supreme Court had found 
the city's apparent interest in collecting fees for its franchise awards to be determinative, we believe that court would have said 
so somewhere in its opinion."
120,10," Plaintiffs and amici argue that a local enactment is preempted by federal law not only when its operation would bring it 
expressly within the federal statute, but also whenever its operation would frustrate the broad objectives that underlie federal 
legislation.  (See Hines v. Davidowitz (1941) 312 U.S. 52, 67 [85 L.Ed. 581, 586-587, 61 S.Ct. 399] (the test of preemption is 
whether the state law stands ""as an obstacle to the accomplishment . . . of the full purposes and objectives of Congress"").) See 
generally, Posner, The Proper Relationship Between State Regulation and the Federal Antitrust Laws (1974) 49 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 
693, 698-703 (suggesting that the federal policy of free and open competition can be applied to prevent the operation of state 
law that clearly transgresses the ""spirit of the Sherman Act,"" ""even if the conflict is not within the express language of the federal 
statute"").  We are not convinced that such a broad view is warranted or that the United States Supreme Court has embraced it.  
Indeed, the court has recently indicated that it will not follow plaintiffs' approach: the court stated that ""[a] state statute is not pre-
empted by the federal antitrust laws simply because the state scheme might have an anticompetitive effect"" ( Rice v. Norman 
Williams Co., supra, 458 U.S. 654, 659 [73 L.Ed.2d 1042, 1049]) and suggested that it will invalidate state legislation in the 
abstract ""only if it mandates . . .  a violation of the antitrust laws in all cases . . . ."" ( Id. at p. 661 [73 L.Ed.2d at p. 1051], italics 
added.) Because it is necessary to prove the requisite concerted action and interstate commerce elements in order to prove a 
violation of section 1, the court's statement must reasonably be construed to require proof of those elements even in a facial 
attack such as this."
120,11," It is therefore unnecessary to discuss either the ""intraenterprise"" or the Noerr/Pennington issues raised in the briefs. "

123,14," The court has at times declined to treat as illegal per se, conduct seemingly within Socony's broad price-fixing definition.  (E.g., 
Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting Sys., Inc. (1979) 441 U.S. 1, 20 [60 L.Ed.2d 1, 16, 99 S.Ct. 1551] [blanket 
licenses not illegal per se even though music associations ""fixed"" license prices, because such licenses created a market 
efficiency, i.e., a product different from individually licensed compositions].) It has been suggested that ""'price fixing' is no more 
than a label given to arrangements that have been found unlawful per se."" (Easterbrook, Maximum Price Fixing (1981) 48

123,17," Plaintiffs assert that the ordinance creates a coercive vertical combination between the Board and individual landlords and 
furthermore that it creates a horizontal combination among all covered landlords. "
124,18," Maricopa, supra, 457 U.S. at pages 343-354 [73 L.Ed.2d at pages 57-65]. "
125,19," Likewise, it has long been recognized that courts are poorly suited to judge the reasonableness of prices set by businesses.  ( 
United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Ass'n (1897) 166 U.S. 290, 331-332 [41 L.Ed. 1007, 1024-1025, 17 S.Ct. 540].)"
125,20," Surely, the ordinance at issue here is not a naked restraint of trade with no purpose except stifling of competition.  (See Note, 
Crawling Out From Under Boulder (1984) 34 Case Western Res. L.Rev. 303, 332-333.) In this regard, the dissent recognizes 
that per se rules are inapplicable if the challenged restraint has ""any redeeming virtue"" (post, p. 715; Continental T. V., Inc. v. 
GTE Sylvania Inc. (1977) 433 U.S. 36, 50 [53 L.Ed.2d 568, 580, 97 S.Ct. 2549], quoting Northern Pacific, supra, 356 U.S. at p. 5 
[2 L.Ed.2d at p. 549]), but proceeds to ignore this established test, in favor of its own subjective inquiry into whether the 
ordinance's anticompetitive effects ""override"" its redeeming virtue.  This unprecedented modification of Northern Pacific-Sylvania 
renders the dissent's analysis internally contradictory: at the same time the dissent recognizes the impropriety of balancing local 
policy against antitrust policy (post, p. 717), it plunges head-on to do just that by balancing a local policy's redeeming virtue 
against its anticompetitive effects.  (Post, p. 718.) Thus -- through the thinly veiled guise of its revised standard of review -- the 
dissent would engage in the same Lochner-type analysis that it purports to disclaim, in order to accomplish the desired result: "
126,," judicial veto of local economic regulation deemed to be unwise.  (Indeed, one need look no further than the titles of the dissent's 
authorities to see that this is the ultimate objective.) Furthermore, even if the dissent might somehow be read to avoid such balancing, its analysis would be plainly circular.  In order 
to determine that the per se rule of illegality of price fixing -- itself a presumption -- applies here, the dissent would apparently 
create a foundational presumption that municipal price fixing lacks ""any redeeming virtue""; in other words, according to the 
dissent, municipal price fixing is per se illegal because it is per se meritless.  This effectively guts the Northern Pacific-Sylvania 
holdings that presence of ""redeeming virtue"" renders per se analysis inapplicable.  Finally, the dissent's suggestion that failure to 
apply a per se rule would somehow violate federal policy is curious at best.  The Sherman Act says nothing of per se rules.  The 
per se rule is a procedural device created by the federal courts largely for their administrative convenience; it is not a substantive 
rule of law.  ( Northern Pacific, supra, 356 U.S. at p. 5 [2 L.Ed.2d at p. 549]; Maricopa, supra, 457 U.S. at p. 344 [73 L.Ed.2d at 
p. 58].) A state court violates no federal policy by declining to extend per se analysis to an unprecedented attack on municipal 
regulation."
126,21," A third possible justification for application of per se rules, closely related to the ease of administration justification, relates to 
predictability.  This justification, in turn, assumes clearly defined judicial pronouncements on prohibited and permissible conduct 
-- an assumption that has no basis with respect to the novel question of potential federal antitrust conflict with a municipality's 
exercise of its police powers. For yet another reason, the per se rule is not applicable in this case.  The per se rule is itself dependent on the applicability of 
the rule of reason. (E.g., Note, Antitrust Standing, Antitrust Inquiry, and the Per Se Standard (1984) 93 Yale L.J. 1309, 1311.) As 
noted above, the per se rule reflects an irrebuttable presumption that, if the court were to subject the conduct in question to a 
full-blown inquiry, a violation would be found under the traditional rule of reason.  If, as we conclude below, the traditional rule of 
reason must be modified or rejected in order to accommodate municipal defendants, it follows that traditional per se analysis 
cannot be applied to those defendants.  (Home Rule, supra, 49 Brooklyn L.Rev. at pp. 294-296.) "

127,25," For the same reason we decline to analyze municipal conduct under a so-called ""municipal rule of reason."" (See, e.g., James, 
supra, 6 U.Ark. Little Rock L.J. at pp. 291-296 [proposing such an approach]; Comment, supra, 35 Baylor L.Rev. at pp. 816-818 
[same].) Whereas the rule of reason as presently formulated focuses solely on the policy of promoting competition ( Professional "
128,," Engineers, supra), recognition of a municipal public policy ""defense"" within the framework of the rule of reason would drastically 
alter the nature of a court's rule of reason inquiry: a court would apparently be called on to balance the ""amount"" of 
anticompetitive restraint against a municipality's interest in effectuating a desired local purpose.  If the rule of reason were so 
modified, it would be no more than a means for judges to impose their own policy judgments on municipal actions.  (See 
Boulder, supra, 455 U.S. at pp. 67-68 [70 L.Ed.2d at pp. 829-830], Rehnquist, J., dis.; Civiletti, The Fallout from Community 
Communications Co. v. City of Boulder: Prospects for a Legislative Solution (1983) 32 Cath.U.L.Rev. 379, 386-387; Comment, 
Alternative Approaches to Municipal Antitrust Liability (1982) 11 Fordham Urban L.J. 51, 81-82; cf. Marticorena, supra, 9 
Western St.U.L.Rev. at pp. 166-167.) We therefore reject a modified rule of reason; instead, we adopt a test that prevents 
judicial second-guessing of local decisions to accomplish proper local purposes.  (See post, pp. 675-676, fn. 28.)"
128,26," Certainly, official misconduct or conflict of interest should not be immune from condemnation under the antitrust laws. See 
Note, supra, 79 Colum.L.Rev. at page 538; compare, Cirace, supra, 61 Tex.L.Rev. at page 498 (arguing that municipalities 
should be exempt from antitrust scrutiny if (a) displacement of competition is no broader than the scope of the substantial market 
failure, imperfection, or instability at which it is directed, and (b) implementation involves no official misconduct, discrimination, or 
conflict of interest). "
129,27," This formulation would not rest determination of permissible anticompetitive municipal conduct on findings that the local 
government engaged in ""traditional,"" or ""integral"" functions, nor would an ordinance's validity turn on the distinction between 
""governmental"" as opposed to ""proprietary"" activities.  Framing permissible conduct in terms of a municipality's exercise of its 
legitimate police powers, on the other hand, encompasses all local actions rationally related to promotion of local health, safety 
and welfare.  (Home Rule, supra, 49 Brooklyn L.Rev. at p. 294, fn. 191.)"
129,28," We recognize that this standard calls on courts to make difficult determinations as to whether proposed alternative means of 
accomplishing a legitimate local purpose would do so (1) as effectively as the challenged means and (2) through means that 
intrude less on the policies of the federal antitrust laws. Regardless of the difficulty of these determinations, however, this 
standard is preferable to a so-called ""municipal rule of reason,"" because it would not require a court to balance competing -- and 
often incommensurable -- policies.  (See ante, pp. 673-674, fn. 25.) Instead, the standard we embrace today prevents judicial 
second-guessing of legitimate local purposes.  However, HN26[
] although a court may not invalidate local legislation by 
balancing the propriety of (or need for) a legitimate local purpose against federal antitrust policies, a court may invalidate a 
municipality's means of achieving a local policy if the local goal is sought to be advanced through discriminatory or irrational 
means, or if it could be achieved as effectively by means that can be demonstrated to likely intrude less on federal antitrust 
policies."
129,29," This subdivision was amended in 1982 to limit the exemption to rental property divided into two units.  See ante, page 654, 
footnote 2. "
130,30," Although plaintiffs argue that any landlords so disposed would already have taken such measures because rental property of 
four or fewer units was already exempt from rent control by the terms of a prior ordinance (the Temporary Rent Stabilization 
Ordinance, passed by the Berkeley City Council eff. Dec. 30, 1979), this response ignores the fact that the ordinance now in 
question is far more comprehensive than its recent predecessor. "
131,31," As a preliminary matter, we reject plaintiffs' procedural claim that it was improper for the court to grant judgment on the 
pleadings because this denied them the opportunity to present evidence as to their claims of confiscation, denial of equal 
protection, and unlawful restraint on alienation.  On a defense motion for judgment on the pleadings, all facts alleged in the 
complaint are deemed admitted.  ( Sullivan v. County of Los Angeles (1974) 12 Cal.3d 710, 714, fn. 3 [117 Cal.Rptr. 241, 527 
P.2d 865]; Colberg, Inc. v. State of California ex rel.  Dept. Pub. Wks. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 408, 411-412 [62 Cal.Rptr. 401].) There 
was no need for plaintiffs to present any evidence.  Further, although they claim that judgment on the pleadings denied them a 
declaration as to facial invalidity, the judgment expressly declared the ordinance ""valid on its face."" HN30[
] It is well 
established that a motion for judgment on the pleadings ""may be used in an action for declaratory relief to obtain a declaratory 
judgment on the merits in favor of the defendant rather than a dismissal of the plaintiff's suit."" (4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 
1971) Proceedings Without Trial, ยง 161, p. 2817, italics in original.) Finally, although plaintiffs claim they should have been 
granted leave to amend their complaint, any amendment to make further factual allegations would only be applicable to the claim 
that the ordinance was invalid as applied.  They were granted leave to amend as to this claim, but later dismissed the amended 
complaint."
131,32," In reality, defendants' ordinance employs two administrative standards for setting maximum rents. As discussed post at pages 
687-689, section 11 provides for annual rent adjustment, but precludes the Board from granting such citywide rent adjustment 
except to offset certain increases in general costs.  This is, in essence, a variation on the so-called ""maintenance of net 
operating income,"" or ""cost passthrough"" approach.  (See Baar, supra, 35 Rutgers L.Rev. at pp. 809-816.) Section 12, 
subdivision (c), on the other hand, provides for individual rent increases based on ""all relevant factors, including (but not limited 
to): . . . . (8) the landlord's rate of return on investment,"" as well as the landlord's costs. "
132,33," Whereas the return on investment standard determines ""just and reasonable return"" by focusing on the landlord's investment, 
the return on value standard determines fair return by focusing on the market value of the landlord's property.  The fair return on 
market value standard advocated by plaintiffs and amici was used by the United States Supreme Court in an early railroad rate 
case, Smyth v. Ames (1898) 169 U.S. 466 [42 L.Ed. 819, 18 S.Ct. 418], decree mod., 171 U.S. 361 [43 L.Ed. 197, 18 S.Ct. 888], 
in which the court held that railroads were entitled to rates sufficient, after deducting reasonable operating expenses, to produce 
a fair return on the fair market value of their assets.  (169 U.S. at p. 547 [42 L.Ed. at p. 849].) The Supreme Court later changed 
its position, and approved use of an approach designed to ensure a fair return on investment.  ( Hope Gas, supra, 320 U.S. at 
pp. 599-605 [88 L.Ed. at pp. 343-346]; see Siegel, Understanding the Lochner Era: Lessons From the Controversy Over 
Railroad and Utility Rate Regulation (1984) 70 Va.L.Rev. 187, 215-259.) Rejecting the idea that rates set by the Federal Power 
Commission must be based on the present ""fair value"" of property, the Hope Gas court observed: ""[the] heart of the matter is 
that rates cannot be made to depend upon 'fair value' when the value of the going enterprise depends on earnings under 
whatever rates may be anticipated."" (Id. at p. 601 [88 L.Ed. at p. 344].) Implicit in this statement is the suggestion that a return on 
fair value standard is circular and unworkable.  ""Value"" is the current worth of future benefits that may be derived from an 
investment.  The ""value"" of a utility company, for example, depends in part on the rates that the utility company may charge for 
its product.  Thus, to set rates by reference to the company's ""value"" is a circular process.  (Siegel, supra, 70 Va.L.Rev. at p. 246 
& fn. 253.) The same circularity problem exists when fair market value concepts are applied in the rent control context.  (See Helmsley v. 
Borough of Fort Lee (1978) 78 N.J. 200 [394 A.2d 65, 71-72]; Baar, supra, 35 Rutgers L.Rev. at pp. 798-803; Reasonable 
Return Doctrine, supra, 33 Rutgers L.Rev.) ""Value is an expression of a building's potential capacity to generate rental income 
and incidental or intangible benefits of ownership during its useful life."" (Fair Return, supra, 12 Rutgers L.J. at p. 640.) The 
current ""value"" of a rental property thus depends in large part on the amount of rental income the property is expected to 
generate.  As in the utility rate cases, the process of using value to determine what rental income shall be permitted becomes 
circular.  (Accord, Cotati Alliance, supra, 148 Cal.App.3d 280, 287-289; Palos Verdes Estates, supra, 142 Cal.App.3d 362, 370-
371.) The Cotati Alliance court thus rejected a landlord's claim that a return on value standard is mandated for an ordinance to 
be facially constitutional: ""The fatal flaw in the return on value standard is that income property most commonly is valued through 
capitalization of its income.  Thus, the process of making individual rent adjustments on the basis of a return on value standard 
is meaningless because it is inevitably circular: value is determined by rental income, the amount of which is in turn set 
according to value.  Use of a return on value standard would thoroughly undermine rent control, since the use of uncontrolled 
income potential to determine value would result in the same rents as those which would be charged in the absence of 
regulation. Value (and hence rents) would increase in a never-ending spiral."" (148 Cal.App.3d at p. 287; accord, Helmsley, 
supra, 394 A.2d at pp. 71-72; Niles v. Boston Rent Control Administrator (1978) 6 Mass.App. 135 [374 N.E.2d 296, 300-303].)"
132,34," Amicus for plaintiffs suggests adoption of the ""public utility investment standard,"" which, it is urged, would result in a base rent 
commensurate with the value of the regulated property at the time rent controls were imposed.  (Cf.  Southern Cal. Gas Co. v. 
Public Utilities Com. (1979) 23 Cal.3d 470, 474 [153 Cal.Rptr. 10, 591 P.2d 34].) Aside from the questionable propriety of 
applying public utility law to the very different area of local regulation of private economic transactions, it has been observed that "
133,," ""if there was a housing shortage which caused rents to be artificially high, use of prerent control value as the measure [for 
calculating fair return] will perpetuate artificially inflated rents. Rent control utilizing this standard is no rent control at all."" ( Cotati 
Alliance, supra, 148 Cal.App.3d 280, 287.)"
133,35," As is apparently conceded by both parties, it would be premature and problematic for us to attempt to articulate, in the context 
of this facial attack, the constitutional test against which specific applications of various administrative standards are to be 
judged.  We will face that question when we review a challenge to rent control as applied to particular plaintiffs.  It is sufficient in 
this case to measure defendants' fair return on investment standard against the general proposition that an administrative 
standard must be such that it will permit those who administer it to avoid confiscatory results. On a similar point, we also wish to dispel suggestions based on dictum in Birkenfeld that we have previously established, as a 
constitutional test, a requirement that rent controls must provide landlords a ""just and reasonable return on their property."" (17 
Cal.3d at p. 165.) This statement was made in the context of a broader discussion of the legitimate exercise of local police 
power, and was most certainly not intended to articulate a constitutional standard.  Birkenfeld's reference to the term ""property"" 
should therefore be viewed with caution; it would be inappropriate to suggest that the Birkenfeld statement can be used to 
predict the specific constitutional standard that we will articulate when we review a challenge to rent control as applied."
133,36," Plaintiffs demonstrate this point by the following hypothetical: In May of 1980, a landlord's gross rental income is $ 10,000; his 
operating expenses total $ 9,000, as follows: mortgage payment of $ 6,000; property taxes of $ 1,000; utility bills of $ 2,000.  
Thus his net return (profit) is $ 1,000.  In May of 1982 his expenses remain the same except that utility costs increase by $ 500 
to $ 1,500, thereby reducing his net return to $ 500.  Under these circumstances the section 11 annual general adjustment 
mechanism allows the Board to provide for a 5 percent increase in rent, to $ 10,500, so that the landlord's profit amount would 
be the same number of dollars ($ 1,000) as it was two years earlier.  However, no relief is or can be provided under section 11 
for the erosionary effect of two years of inflation on the $ 1,000 base income, the purchasing power of which has been 
diminished."
133,37," The ""effect of inflation"" issue was apparently raised for the first time at oral argument in the Court of Appeal.  On July 21, 1983, 
the appellate court vacated submission of the case in order to receive defendants' written concession of July 5, 1983, that the 
term ""fair return on investment"" in section 12, subdivisions (c) and (i), may reasonably be interpreted to permit the Board to 
consider and allow for any decrease in the purchasing power of the landlord's return caused by inflation.  Both the court's order 
and defendants' letter, as well as plaintiffs' response thereto, are part of the record before us on appeal.  The issue has been 
briefed and responses have been filed."
133,38," Plaintiffs' point can best be explained by a hypothetical example.  Assuming that the Board were to fix a ""fair return on 
investment"" at 10 percent for all landlords, the following might occur: Recent investor A has invested $ 70,000 since 1979, and 
he earned a profit of $ 6,000 in 1980.  In 1984 he petitions the Board under section 12 for an increase in his return on "
134,," investment.  Under its 10 percent return on investment standard, the Board may grant A an increase of $ 1,000, so that his 1984 
amount of profit is $ 7,000.  Additional contributions to capital could, of course, also yield a 10 percent return. In contrast, long-term investor B has invested $ 40,000 since 1950, and he, too, earned a profit of $ 6,000 in 1980.  However, 
when in 1984 he petitions the Board under section 12 for an increase in his return on investment, he will be turned down if the 
Board mechanically multiplies his $ 40,000 investment by a 10 percent return.  Hence, B would be limited to his frozen May 1980 
amount of return -- $ 6,000.  Only if (as plaintiffs suggest is mandatory) the Board takes into account the effect of inflation on his 
investment, and ""adjusts"" his investment figure accordingly, or if (as ยง 12, subd. (c)(8), seems to allow (see post, p. 683, fn. 39)) 
the Board assigns him a higher rate of return, may he secure an increase in the amount of profit he received in 1980."
134,39," For example, nothing in the ordinance precludes the Board from adjusting the rate (percentage) of return on investment in 
order to increase a landlord's amount of profit.  Indeed, the ordinance seems to contemplate ad hoc adjustment of individual 
landlord's rates of return in order to reach this result: section 12, subdivision (c)(8), provides that in making individual 
adjustments the Board shall consider ""[the] landlord's rate of return on investment."" (Italics added.) See section 12, subdivision 
(c), set out post, page 689, footnote 46."
134,40," Nothing in the ordinance requires the Board to fix a landlord's return based only on his ""actual"" investment.  Further, although 
section 12, subdivision (c), contains a list of ""relevant factors"" to be considered by the Board in determining the appropriate "
135,," amount of a landlord's rents, these factors are expressly nonexclusive.  And perhaps most significant, subsection (8) of 
subdivision (c), permits the Board to consider ""all relevant factors"" in determining the ""landlord's rate of return on investment."" 
See section 12, subdivision (c), set out post at page 689, footnote 46. We read Cotati Alliance to be consistent with our determination today.  That case merely suggests that a rent board ""may"" 
consider the effect of inflation if doing so is necessary to assure a landlord a fair return, and hence avoid a confiscatory result, in 
a specific case.  (148 Cal.App.3d at p. 289.)"
135,41," See section 12, subdivisions (d) and (e), set out post, page 692, footnote 53."
135,42," The court further noted: ""[landlords] also argue that the ordinance unfairly denies long-time landlords any appreciation from the 
time of acquisition to the date when rents were first controlled, but the ordinance did not reduce rents when it was enacted, and 
thus, did not affect preordinance appreciation."" ( Id. at pp. 290-291 (italics in original).) "
136,43," To the extent it is contrary to this determination, Gregory v. City of San Juan Capistrano (1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 72, 85-86 [191 
Cal.Rptr. 47] is disapproved. "
137,44," Section 11, as amended in 1982 (see ante, p. 654, fn. 2), provides in full (deletions are stricken with a horizontal line; additions 
are in italics): ""a. Once each year, the Board shall consider setting and adjusting the rent ceiling for all rental units covered by this Ordinance in 
general and/or particular categories of rental units covered by this Ordinance deemed appropriate by the Board.  The Board 
shall hold at least two public hearings prior to making any annual general adjustment of the rent ceilings. The Board shall publish 
and publicize notices of the date, time, and place of the public hearings at least thirty (30) days prior to the hearing date.  The 
two required public hearings shall be conducted and the annual general adjustment shall be set between September 1 and 
October 31, of each year.  The annual adjustment shall become effective the following January 1. ""b. In making annual general adjustments of the rent ceiling, the Board shall: ""(1) Adjust the rent ceiling upward by granting those landlords who pay for utilities a utility adjustment for increases in the City of 
Berkeley for utilities. ""(2) Adjust the rent ceiling upward by granting landlords a property tax, maintenance and operating expense increase adjustment 
(exclusive of utilities) for increases in the City of Berkeley for property taxes and maintenance and operating expenses. ""(3) Adjust the rent ceiling downward by requiring landlords to decrease rents for any decreases in the City of Berkeley for 
property taxes. ""(4) Adjust the rent ceiling downward by requiring landlords who pay for utilities to decrease rents for any decreases in the City 
of Berkeley for utilities. ""In adjusting rents ceilings under this subsection, the Board shall adopt a formula or formulas of general application.  This 
formula will be based upon the annual rent registration forms, surveys, information and testimonies presented at public hearings, 
and other available data indicating increases or decreases in the expenses relating to the rental housing market in the City of 
Berkeley set forth in this subsection.  For maintenance and operating expense adjustments, the Board may also use survey data 
from surrounding communities where appropriate.  The Board shall make no more than one annual adjustment of rent ceilings 
per rental units per year. ""Adoption of a formula greater than forty-five percent (45%) of the increase in the Consumer Price Index for the twelve months 
ending the previous June 30 shall require the affirmative vote of six (6) Commissioners, other provisions notwithstanding.  
Adoption of such a formula shall be a specific and special exception to the requirement of only five (5) affirmative votes to make 
a decision.  For the purposes of this subsection, the Consumer Price Index shall mean the Consumer Price Index for all urban 
consumers in San Francisco -- Oakland, all items (1967 equals 100), as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. 
Department of Labor, as it pertains to the City of Berkeley. ""c. An upward general adjustment in rent ceilings does not automatically provide for a rent increase.  Allowable rent increases 
pursuant to a general upward adjustment shall become effective only after the landlord gives the tenant at least a thirty (30) days 
written notice of such rent increase and the notice period expires. ""d. If the Board makes a downward general adjustment in the rent ceilings, landlords of rental units to which this adjustment 
applies shall give tenants of such rental units written notice of the rent decrease to which they are entitled.  Such rent decreases 
shall take effect not later than thirty (30) days after the effective date set by the Board for the downward general adjustment. ""e. If the maximum allowable rent specified under this Ordinance for a rental unit is greater than the rent specified for such unit in 
the rental agreement, the lower rent specified in the rental agreement shall be the maximum allowable rent until the rental 
agreement expires.  If the maximum allowable rent specified under this Ordinance for a rental unit is less than the rent specified 
for such unit in the rental agreement, the lower rent specified under this Ordinance shall be the maximum allowable rent. ""f. No rent increase pursuant to an upward general adjustment of a rent ceiling shall be effective if the landlord: "
138,," ""(1) Has continued to fail to comply, after order of the Board, with any provisions of this Ordinance and/or orders or regulations 
issued thereunder, or ""(2) Has failed to bring the rental unit into compliance with the implied warranty of habitability, or ""(3) Has failed to make repairs as ordered by the Housing Inspection Services of the City of Berkeley, or ""(4) Has failed to completely register by September 1, except as provided in Subsection 11.g. below. ""g. The amount of an upward general adjustment for which a landlord shall be eligible shall decrease by ten (10) percent per 
month for each month beyond December 1 for which the landlord fails to register. ""h. A landlord who is ineligible to raise rents under an upward general adjustment for an entire calendar year shall not be eligible 
to raise rents under that particular general adjustment in future years."""
138,45," We are informed by amicus that general adjustments under section 11 in the past four years have been as follows: 1981, 5 
percent (6.21 if the landlord provided space heating); 1982, 9 percent; 1983, 5 percent; 1984, no increase (apparently because 
of the low inflation rate for 1983).  See Baar, supra, 35 Rutgers L.Rev. at pages 779-780."
138,46," Section 12, subdivision c, provides in full: ""In making individual adjustments of the rent ceiling, the Board or the hearing 
examiner shall consider the purposes of this Ordinance and shall specifically consider all relevant factors, including (but not 
limited to): ""(1) Increases or decreases in property taxes; ""(2) Unavoidable increases or any decreases in maintenance and operating expenses; ""(3) The cost of planned or completed capital improvements to the rental unit (as distinguished from ordinary repair, replacement 
and maintenance) where such capital improvements are necessary to bring the property into compliance or maintain compliance 
with applicable local code requirements affecting health and safety, and where such capital improvement costs are properly 
amortized over the life of the improvement; ""(4) Increases or decreases in the number of tenants occupying the rental unit, living space, furniture, furnishings, equipment, or 
other housing services provided, or occupancy rules; ""(5) Substantial deterioration of the controlled rental unit other than as a result of normal wear and tear; ""(6) Failure on the part of the landlord to provide adequate housing services, or to comply substantially with applicable state 
rental housing laws, local housing, health and safety codes, or the rental agreement; ""(7) The pattern of recent rent increases or decreases; ""(8) The landlord's rate of return on investment.  In determining such return, all relevant factors, including but not limited to the 
following shall be considered: the landlord's actual cash down payment, method of financing the property, and any federal or 
state tax benefits accruing to landlord as a result of ownership of the property; ""(9) Whether or not the property was acquired or is held as a long-term or short-term investment; and ""(10) Whether or not the landlord has received rent in violation of the terms of this Ordinance or has otherwise failed to comply 
with the Ordinance. ""It is the intent of this Ordinance that individual upward adjustments in the rent ceilings on units be made only when the landlord 
demonstrates that such adjustments are necessary to provide the landlord with a fair return on investment."" "
139,47," Section 12, subdivision a provides in full: ""Petitions.  Upon receipt of a petition by a landlord and/or tenant, the rent ceiling of 
individual controlled rental units may be adjusted upward or downward in accordance with the procedures set forth elsewhere in 
this Section.  The petition shall be on the form provided by the Board.  The Board may set a reasonable per unit fee based upon 
the expenses of processing the petition to be paid by the petitioner at the time of filing.  No petition shall be filed before 
September 1, 1980.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, the Board or hearing examiner may refuse to hold a 
hearing and/or grant an individual rent ceiling adjustment for a rental unit if an individual hearing has been held and decision 
made with regard to the rent ceiling for such unit within the previous six months."""
139,48," Section 12, subdivision b(9) provides in full: ""Consolidation.  All landlord petitions pertaining to tenants in the same building 
shall be consolidated for hearing, and all petitions filed by tenants occupying the same building shall be consolidated for hearing 
unless there is a showing of good cause not to consolidate such petitions."""
139,49," Section 12, subdivision b(1) provides in full: ""Hearing Examiner.  A hearing examiner appointed by the Board shall conduct a 
hearing to act upon the petition for individual adjustments of rent ceilings and shall have the power to administer oaths and 
affirmations."""
139,50," Section 12, subdivision b(11) provides in full: ""Finality of Decision.  The decision of the hearing examiner shall be the final 
decision of the Board in the event of no appeal to the Board.  The decision of the hearing examiner shall not be stayed pending 
appeal; however, in the event that the Board or panel reverses or modifies the decision of the hearing examiner, the Board shall 
order the appropriate party to make retroactive payments to restore the parties to the position they would have occupied had the 
hearing examiner's decision been the same as that of the Board's."""
139,51," Section 12, subdivision b(12) provides in full: ""Time for Decision.  The rules and regulations adopted by the Board shall 
provide for final Board action on any individual rent adjustment petition within one hundred and twenty (120) days following the 
date of filing of the individual rent ceiling adjustment petition, unless the conduct of the petitioner or other good cause is 
responsible for the delay."" As defendants point out, it is clear that the 120-day rule also applies to petition determinations that 
are appealed to the Board."
139,52," Like the 105-day provision that we recently reviewed in Carson, we do not believe that the time allowed for review under 
section 12 is excessive.  Within the 120-day time limit, ""the Board must (1) review all information provided by the applicants, 
including complex financial and tax data, (2) review comments received from tenants, and (3) hold a hearing at which the 
interested parties are permitted to testify.  [para. ] Careful review of the information provided to the Board is important.  The 
financial and tax data submitted by the applicant reveals whether the owner's profits have increased or decreased, whether the 
property taxes or operating costs associated with the [property] have increased or decreased, and whether any capital 
improvements have been made.  Review of the information supplied by the tenants helps the Board determine whether there 
has been any increase or decrease in the services provided by the [landlord]."" (35 Cal.3d at pp. 193-194.) "
140,," We stress that only the facial validity of the ordinance is currently before the court.  Whether individual landlords might prove a 
denial of due process because of delays exceeding the 120-day time limit is a question of great concern, but it is not before us at 
this time."
140,53," These subdivisions provide in full: ""d. No individual upward adjustment of a rent ceiling shall be authorized by the Board by 
reason of increased interest or other expenses resulting from the landlord's refinancing the rental unit if, at the time the landlord 
refinanced, the landlord could reasonably have foreseen that such increased expenses could not be covered by the rent 
schedule then in existence, except where such refinancing is necessary for the landlord to make capital improvements which 
meet the criteria set forth in Section 12.c.(3).  This paragraph shall only apply to that portion of the increased expenses resulting 
from the refinancing that were reasonably foreseeable at the time of the refinancing of the rental unit and shall only apply to 
rental units refinanced after the date of adoption of this Ordinance. [para. ] e. Except for cases of individual hardship as set forth 
in Subsection 12.i.  of this Ordinance, no individual upward adjustment of a rent ceiling shall be authorized by the Board because 
of the landlord's increased interest or other expenses resulting from the sale of the property, if at the time the landlord acquired 
the property, the landlord could have reasonably foreseen that such increased expenses would not be covered by the rent 
schedule then in effect.  This Subsection (12.e.) shall only apply to rental units acquired after the date of adoption of this 
Ordinance."" "
141,54," As amended in 1982 (see ante, p. 654, fn. 2), the section provides (deletions are stricken with a horizontal line; additions are 
in italics): ""No landlord may threaten to bring, or bring, an action to recover possession, cause the tenant to quit the unit 
involuntarily, serve any notice to quit or notice of termination of tenancy, decrease any services or increase the rent where the 
landlord's intent is retaliation against the tenant for the tenant's assertion or exercise of rights under this Ordinance. Such 
retaliation shall be a defense to an action to recover possession, or it may serve as the basis for an affirmative action by the 
tenant for actual and punitive damages and injunctive relief.  In an action by or against a tenant, evidence of the assertion or 
exercise by the tenant of rights under this Ordinance within six months prior to the alleged act of retaliation shall create a 
presumption that the landlord's act was retaliatory.  'Presumption' means that the Court must find the existence of the fact 
presumed unless and until its nonexistence is proven by a preponderance of the evidence.  A tenant may assert retaliation 
affirmatively or as a defense to the landlord's action without the aid of the presumption regardless of the period of time which has 
elapsed between the tenant's assertion or exercise of rights under this Ordinance and the alleged act of retaliation."" "
144,55," This section provides in full: ""a. For Violation of Rent Ceilings or Failure to Register.  If a landlord fails to register in accordance 
with Section 8 of this Ordinance, or if a landlord demands, accepts, receives or retains any payment in excess of the maximum 
allowable rent permitted by this Ordinance, a tenant may take any or all of the following actions until compliance is achieved: ""(1) A tenant may petition the Board for appropriate relief.  If the Board, after the landlord has proper notice and after a hearing, 
determines that a landlord has wilfully and knowingly failed to register a rental unit covered by this Ordinance or violated the 
provisions of Sections 10, 11 and 12 of this Ordinance, the Board may authorize the tenant of such rental unit to withhold all or a 
portion of the rent for the unit until such time as the rental unit is brought into compliance with this Ordinance. After a rental unit 
is brought into compliance, the Board shall determine what portion, if any, of the withheld rent is owed to the landlord for the 
period in which the rental unit was not in compliance.  Whether or not the Board allows such withholding, no landlord who has 
failed to comply with the Ordinance shall at any time increase rents for a rental unit until such unit is brought into compliance. ""(2) A tenant may withhold up to the full amount of his or her periodic rent which is charged or demanded by the landlord under 
the provisions of this Ordinance. In any action to recover possession based on nonpayment of rent, possession shall not be 
granted where the tenant has withheld rent in good faith under this Section. "
145,," ""(3) A tenant may seek injunctive relief on behalf of herself or himself to restrain the landlord from demanding or receiving any 
rent on the unit until the landlord has complied with the terms of this Ordinance. ""(4) A tenant may file a damage suit against the landlord for actual damages when the landlord receives or retains any rent in 
excess of the maximum rent allowed under this Ordinance. Upon further proof of a bad faith claim by the landlord or the 
landlord's retention of rent in excess of the maximum rent allowed by this Ordinance, the tenant shall receive a judgment of up to 
seven hundred and fifty dollars ($ 750.00) in addition to any actual damages. ""b. For Violation of Eviction Proceedings.  If it is shown in the appropriate court that the event which the landlord claims as 
grounds to recover possession under Subsection 13.a.(7), Subsection 13.a.(8), Subsection 13.a.(9), or Subsection 13.a.(10) is 
not initiated within two months after the tenant vacates the unit, or it is shown the landlord's claim was false or in bad faith, the 
tenant shall be entitled to regain possession and to actual damages.  If the landlord's conduct was willful, the tenant shall be 
entitled to damages in an amount of $ 750 or three times the actual damages sustained, whichever is greater. ""c. The City Attorney may bring an action for injunctive relief on behalf of the City or on behalf of tenants seeking compliance by 
landlords with this Ordinance. ""d. The Board may seek injunctive relief to restrain or enjoin any violation of this Ordinance or of the rules, regulations, orders 
and decisions of the Board. ""e. If a tenant fails to bring a civil or administrative action within one hundred and twenty (120) days from the date of the first 
occurrence of a violation of this Ordinance, the Board may either settle the claim arising from the violation or bring such action.  
Thereafter, the tenant on whose behalf the Board acted may not bring an action against the landlord in regard to the same 
violation for which the Board has made a settlement or brought an action.  In the event the Board settles the claim it shall be 
entitled to retain from any payments made by the landlord, the costs it incurred in settlement, and the tenant aggrieved by the 
violation shall be entitled to the remainder."""
145,56," This section provides, inter alia, that by a specified date landlords must file a rent registration form showing rents in effect on 
certain prior dates for each rental unit covered by the ordinance."
145,57," Defendants point out that although the subsection (2) remedy might be more effective, the subsection (1) remedy is available 
for those tenants who would hesitate to take such action without prior approval of an official agency. "
146,58," That subdivision provides in part: ""The Board shall finance its reasonable and necessary expenses for its operation without the 
use of General Fund monies of the City of Berkeley except as stated in this subsection, by charging landlords an annual 
registration fee of twelve dollars ($ 12.00) per unit, per year in the first year of operation.  After the first year, upon request by the 
Board the City Council may make reasonable annual adjustments in the fee.  The Board is also empowered to request and 
receive funding when and if necessary, from any available source, except the City of Berkeley's General Fund, for its reasonable 
and necessary expenses, including but not limited to salaries and all other operating expenses."""
146,59," The annual registration fee for the first year of operation was $ 12 per unit.  The city council, on request of the Board, may 
make reasonable annual adjustments in the fee.  (Ibid.; see Baar, supra, 35 Rutgers L.Rev. at p. 763, table 5.1 [comparing 
funding provisions of various rent control ordinances].)"
146,60," See ante, pages 687-689, footnote 44."
146,61," That subdivision and subsection provide: ""f. No upward adjustment of an individual rent ceiling shall be authorized by the 
Board under this Section if the landlord: ""(1) Has continued to fail to comply, after order of the Board, with any provisions of this Ordinance and/or orders or regulations

147,62," Indeed, the record contains the following regulation adopted by the Board on September 24, 1980: ""The remedy of rent 
withholding provided to tenants under 15(a)(1) and 15(a)(2) shall not be construed to relieve the tenant of the obligation to pay

150,67," See Sato, ""Municipal Affairs"" in California (1972) 60 Cal.L.Rev. 1055, 1073, footnote 68 (Galvan's preemption analysis relies 
on that part of Hubbard relating to municipal affairs). "
152,1," None of the cases cited by the majority involved an attempt by an amicus curiae to raise a new issue on appeal, nor does it 
appear that the new issues were first raised after a hearing had been granted.  ( Frink v. Prod (1982) 31 Cal.3d 166, 170 [181 
Cal.Rptr. 893, 643 P.2d 476]; Carman v. Alvord (1982) 31 Cal.3d 318, 323 [182 Cal.Rptr. 506, 644 P.2d 192]; UFITEC, S.A. v. 
Carter (1977) 20 Cal.3d 238, 249, fn. 2 [142 Cal.Rptr. 279, 571 P.2d 990]; Wong v. Di Grazia (1963) 60 Cal.2d 525, 532, fn. 9, 
535-541 [35 Cal.Rptr. 241, 386 P.2d 817]; Tyre v. Aetna Life Ins. Co. (1960) 54 Cal.2d 399, 405 [6 Cal.Rptr. 13, 353 P.2d 725]; 
Burdette v. Rollefson Construction Co. (1959) 52 Cal.2d 720, 725-726 [344 P.2d 307].) In Carman v. Alvord, supra, 31 Cal.3d 318, several amici joined the parties in urging this court to resolve an issue first raised on 
appeal.  ( Id., at p. 324.) However, the issue had been raised by the defendant city in its responsive brief in the Court of Appeal.  
( Id., at p. 323.) This court concluded that the issue was properly before it under an exception to the rule that ""on appeal a litigant 
may not argue theories for the first time []."" ( Id., at p. 324, italics added.) "
153,2," Several exceptions have been recognized, none of which is applicable in the setting of the present case.  (See E. L. White, Inc. 
v. City of Huntington Beach, supra, 21 Cal.3d at p. 511 [issue raised by amicus curiae considered because, on appeal from a 
judgment of dismissal following the sustaining of a general demurrer without leave to amend, court was required to affirm 
judgment if correct on any theory; appeal also presented a question of jurisdictional dimension]; cf.  People v. Coleman (1942) 
53 Cal.App.2d 18, 32 [127 P.2d 309] [""ignoring"" general rule to permit amicus curiae to raise new objection to jury instructions in 
criminal appeal].) Another exception is presented by an automatic appeal from a judgment imposing a penalty of death.  In an automatic appeal, 
this court has a statutory duty to examine the complete record to determine whether the defendant was given a fair trial.  ( 
People v. Stanworth (1969) 71 Cal.2d 820, 833 [80 Cal.Rptr. 49, 457 P.2d 889]; Pen. Code, ยง 1239, subd. (b).) Accordingly, an 
amicus will be permitted to raise a new issue bearing on that question.  ( People v. Easley (1983) 34 Cal.3d 858, 863-864 [196 
Cal.Rptr. 309, 671 P.2d 813] [rehearing granted to consider issues raised by amicus curiae after initial decision filed but before 
the opinion became final].)"
153,3," In this respect, the problem presented here differs from the one confronting the Court of Appeal in Younger.  With certain 
exceptions, this court has discretion as to which cases it will hear.  The Courts of Appeal, again with minor exceptions, must rule 
on all duly filed appeals from final judgments and appealable orders.  (See Cal. Const., art.  VI, ยงยง 11, 12; Cal. Rules of Court, 
rules 28, 29; Code Civ. Proc., ยง 901 et seq.; 6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Appeal, ยง 30, p. 4045.) Hence, this court has 
an additional basis for insisting upon timely notification of the issues posed by an appeal."
153,4," On May 6, 1985, this particular problem will be lessened considerably when a recently approved amendment to the California 
Constitution takes effect.  (Cal. Const., art. VI, ยง 12, as adopted Nov. 6, 1984.) The amendment will permit this court, inter alia, 
to review only those issues which it considers most important in a case and leave intact the lower court's decision on all other "
154,," issues.  (See Legislative Analyst's Analysis, Ballot Pamp., Proposed Amend. to Cal. Const., Supreme Court: Transfer of Causes 
and Review of Decisions, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 1984) p. 28.)"
154,5," The burden of satisfying the requirements for timely presentation of issues should be added to that of overcoming the well 
established general rule which bars amici from raising new issues on appeal.  (See ante, at p. 711.) "
157,1," Plaintiffs herein seek a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief to enjoin operation of the ordinance. Although the issue of 
available remedies in a federal court action was left open in Boulder, supra, 457 U.S. at page 56, footnote 20 [70 L.Ed.2d at p. 
822], I assume that relief in state court cases such as this is limited to declaratory and injunctive relief and would preclude 
recovery of damages.  (See Rice v. Norman Williams Co., supra, 458 U.S. at p. 658, fn. 4 [73 L.Ed.2d at p. 1049].)"
157,2," Application of the antitrust laws requires factual and legal determinations regarding the existence of ""concerted activity"" and a 
substantial effect upon interstate commerce.  Although my view of the record suggests that both elements exist here, I would not 
object to a remand limited to these issues. "
162,1," Timberlane's argument mistakenly assumes that before the jurisdictional issue can be resolved, the district court must 
adjudicate the merits of its claim. Once a motion to dismiss is treated as one asking for summary judgment, it cannot be granted 
as long as genuine issues of material fact remain in dispute. In most cases this requires a complete trial to establish the facts on 
which the resolution of the merits of the case depends. This approach, however, would defeat the underlying purpose of 
Timberlane I's ""rule of reason"" analysis. By reaching the merits, federal courts would violate the principles of international comity 
embodied in the third part of Timberlane I's analysis. The test for jurisdiction would become a test of the merit of the allegations 
rather than the more flexible approach contemplated in Timberlane I. We do not believe that all cases deciding the question of 
extraterritorial jurisdiction should be decided under Rule 12(b) (1). But neither should district courts always reach the merits 
under Rule 56. The district court's articulation of a middle ground in this case is sound. One feature of this approach should be 
that the third part of the tripartite test should ordinarily be viewed as not involving the merits of the antitrust dispute. Timberlane also argues that the district court failed to compel discovery concerning nonparties and impermissibly cut off all 
discovery efforts before completion. In light of our deferential standard of review of discovery orders, see Rae v. Union Bank, "
163,725," F.2d 478, 481 (9th Cir. 1984), and the district court's acceptance of proffered statements of proof, see Timberlane II, 574 F. 
Supp. at 1461, the district court's rulings regarding discovery are affirmed."
163,2,"  ""We have applied a rigorous standard of proof to defendants' claims of plaintiffs' deficiencies of evidence on the Timberlane 
I tripartite test, and conclude that, on the issues material to that determination, there is neither material issue of fact to be 
culled from the submissions, nor is there inference or reference to such evidence favorable to plaintiffs which, even taken in 
the most favorable light to defeat dismissal, could support such a result."" Timberlane II, 574 F. Supp. at 1462 n. 24. "
164,3," The district court grouped Timberlane I's seven factors into three categories. Because this categorization does not sufficiently 
clarify the application of the seven factor analysis, we believe that district courts should continue to use the factors listed in 
Timberlane I. "
169,1," The group system of operation of Farmers Insurance Group is not uncommon in the insurance industry.  Farmers Insurance 
Group and other groups, such as Allstate and State Farm, constitute a substantial portion of the American insurance industry."
169,2," Defendant Farmers Insurance Exchange writes auto insurance; defendant Mid-Century Insurance Co. writes preferred risk 
automobile insurance; defendant Fire Insurance Exchange insures residences against fire and loss; defendant Truck Insurance 
Exchange insures against certain commercial losses; and defendant Farmers New World Life Insurance Co. writes life 
insurance. "
170,3," In supervising the marketing of these insurance products, Farmers Group, Inc.'s hierarchy includes a Regional Sales Manager, 
a Regional Agency Manager, and five Division Agency Managers.  The Regional Sales Manager heads the sales branch and 
reports to the Regional Manager.  The Regional Agency Manager (who is below the Regional Sales Manager) is in charge of 
Farmers Group, Inc.'s agents (who sell the policies of the affiliated companies to customers) and has overall responsibility for the 
recruitment and training of sales agents.  Below the Regional Agency Managers are the five Division Agency Managers, who 
supervise the District Managers of the sales force."
170,4," The District Managers' specific responsibilities for Farmers Group, Inc. include locating persons interested in becoming 
insurance agents, assisting them to obtain approval from the Farmers Group, Inc. regional office, and (if the agents are 
approved) training, supervising, and motivating them.  The actual approval of the agents is a function of the regional sales staff. 
In addition, the Regional Agency Manager and a Division Agency Manager are responsible for establishing new agency districts, 
splitting and combining old districts, training District Managers, assisting them in their duties, and reviewing the results obtained 
by District Managers."
170,5," The pertinent portions of Farmers Group, Inc. policy provided as follows: ""D.  Transfer of Employees Between Departments or Offices b.  As Agent -- Salaried personnel may be considered for appointment as an Agent subject to approval of the Regional 
Manager or Functional Officer and the Vice President -- Field Operations under the following conditions: (1) Conditions set forth on page 13, Section II of the Personnel Policy and Procedure Manual must be met. (2) Regional Staff members, members of the Regional Sales Manager's Staff, Division Agency Managers, Commercial 
and Life Sales Representatives, and Sales Trainees are not eligible for appointment as an Agent within their own 
Region or any other Region they have worked in during the past three years."
170,*," * * * * * Note: These rules were established to avoid any possible implication of manipulation or favoritism.  Rarely will an exception 
be made. In such rare instances, the Regional Manager will submit a well-documented recommendation to the Vice President -- 
Field Operations for final approval. c.  In Any Other Employee or Non-Employee Capacity Our policy towards employees who leave us to become Office Managers, Training Specialists, etc., for District 
Managers parallels the guidelines set forth under appointment as an Agent. In addition to the conditions under Agency appointment, employees seeking such positions should be advised that the 
Company does not consider these positions to be stepping stones to District Manager appointments. Our policy has 
generally been to appoint District Managers from amongst our more successful agents.  Therefore, an employee must 
first become a successful agent before he will be considered for appointment to District Manager."" Thus, under this policy, Plueckhahn, as a member of the Regional Sales Manager's Staff, was not eligible to go to work for a 
District Manager in the Texas Region for three years. "
171,6," The record is not entirely clear as to how much the withdrawn request influenced Pool in his decisionmaking.  Some evidence 
in the record indicates that Pool's primary motivation was to maintain his good relations with the Farmers Insurance Group 
system and that he therefore acquiesced in the earlier request even though it had been formally withdrawn. Other evidence 
indicates that Plueckhahn's decision was based on information that he had received in the interim that Plueckhahn's family 
problems would unduly interfere with his job performance. The district court made no specific finding of fact on this issue, and, 
as we explain below, see infra slip op. at 1473-1475 at    , the judgment of the district court must be affirmed, even assuming 
that Pool acquiesced to the Farmers Group, Inc. request and formed a conspiracy with the defendant companies."
171,7," Defendants argue vigorously that no section 1 violation could occur since the defendant companies constituted a common 
enterprise incapable of conspiring with itself.  See Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 104 S. Ct. 
2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1984). The instant case presents a different question from Copperweld since the instant case does not 
involve a parent and its wholly-owned subsidiary.  See id. at 2740. Nor does the instant case involve a situation of identity of 
ownership of the defendants as did a recent case by this Court, Century Oil Tool, Inc. v. Production Specialties, Inc., 737 F.2d 
1316 (5th Cir.1984). Thus Copperweld is not directly on point.  However, as we note below, its analysis of unity of purpose is 
useful in determining whether the district court erred in applying a rule of reason analysis to the alleged restraint. "
172,8," Plueckhahn's argument is also foreclosed by the holding in Blackburn. There, this Court held that the horizontal component 
was missing since the alleged target did not compete with the alleged conspirators.  The situation here is identical; plaintiff 
Plueckhahn, the target of the alleged boycott, did not compete with the defendant companies or Pool. "
173,9," Plueckhahn attempts to beg the question of market definition and market share by stating that the relevant market ""is the 
market for the labor services of those employed by the Farmers Group."" Plaintiff-Appellant's Brief at 8.  Plueckhahn offers no 
support for this market definition.  Even taking a charitable view toward Plueckhahn's position, the narrowest market would be 
that for the labor services of insurance employees. "
175,1," For a full description of this industry, see Cass Student Adv., Inc. v. National Ed. Adv. Serv., Inc. (Cass v. NEAS), 374 F. Supp. 
796, 797-98 (N.D. Ill. 1974). "
177,2," AP quotes Cass's complaint filed against NEAS in 1973, alleging that even one exclusive jeopardizes placing ads in an entire 
category of papers. These statements are admissible evidence but not conclusive admissions. 4 Wigmore, Evidence ยง 1066; cf.  
Christensen v. Trotter, 171 F.2d 66, 68 (9th Cir. 1948). Nor is the doctrine of judicial estoppel applicable. 4 Wigmore at ยง 1066."
177,3," The trial court found that Cass had market power because it placed over 80% of the national advertising. Typically, market 
power is calculated on share of revenues. See, e.g., Greyhound Computer, Inc. v. International Business Machines Corp., 559 
F.2d 488, 496-97 (9th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1040, 54 L. Ed. 2d 790, 98 S. Ct. 782 (1978). That is the appropriate 
measure of power in this market. "
184,1," In a 1978 case, this court held that HN2[
] municipal contracts for the collection and hauling of garbage and other waste are 
subject to the competitive bidding procedure set out in SDCL ch. 5-18.  Northern Hills Sanitation v. Board of Com'rs., 272 
N.W.2d 835 (S.D. 1978). "
188,2, Although Stienfeld was Bruce Steckelberg's father-in-law. 
189,3," A reading of appellee's brief leaves the impression that this billing practice continued indefinitely. Byre's counsel faults City for 
continuing billing beyond February 15, 1978, when Byre's initiated ordinance was passed by City Council. SDCL 2-1-12 clearly 
states that an initiated ordinance does not become effective until the day after the official canvass of the votes on the measure. "
194,*," The City's expert was Dr. Ralph Brown; this expert crumbled under cross-examination before the jury for he testified not as an 
expert in the garbage business but rather as a consumer of garbage. Chamberlain produced no expert or City employee 
providing cost figures for running its own municipal garbage service. "
197,1," Section 1962 reads in pertinent part: (c) It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with an enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which 
affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's 
affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt. (d) It shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any of the provisions of subsections (a), (b) or (c) of this section. Section 1961 reads in pertinent part: (1) ""racketeering activity"" means (A) any act or threat involving murder, kidnapping, gambling, arson, robbery, bribery, 
extortion, or dealing in narcotic or other dangerous drugs, which is chargeable under State law and punishable by 
imprisonment for more than one year; (B) any act which is indictable under any of the following provisions of title 18, United 
States Code: Section 201 (relating to bribery); section 224 (relating to sports bribery), sections 471, 472 and 473 (relating to 
counterfeiting), section 659 (relating to theft from interstate shipment) if the act indictable under section 659 is felonious, 
section 664 (relating to embezzlement from pension and welfare funds), sections 891-894 (relating to extortionate credit 
transactions), section 1084 (relating to the transmission of gambling information), section 1341 (relating to mail fraud), 
section 1343 (relating to wire fraud), section 1503 (relating to obstruction of justice), section 1510 (relating to obstruction of 
criminal investigations), section 1511 (relating to the obstruction of State or local law enforcement), section 1951 (relating to "
198,," interference with commerce, robbery, or extortion), section 1952 (relating to racketeering), section 1953 (relating to 
interstate transportation of wagering paraphernalia), section 1954 (relating to unlawful welfare fund payments), section 
1955 (relating to the prohibition of illegal gambling businesses), section 2314 and 2315 (relating to interstate transportation 
of stolen property), sections 2341-2346 (relating to trafficking in contraband cigarettes), section 2421-24 (relating to white 
slave traffic), (C) any act which is indictable under title 29, United States Code, section 196 (dealing with restrictions of 
payments and loans to labor organizations) or section 501(c) (relating to embezzlement from union funds), or (D) any 
offense involving fraud connected with a case under title 11, fraud in the sale of securities, or the felonious manufacture, 
importation, receiving, concealment, buying, selling, or otherwise dealing in narcotic or other dangerous drugs, punishable 
under any law of the United States. . . . (4) ""enterprise"" includes any individual partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of 
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity; (5) ""pattern of racketeering activity"" requires at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the 
effective date of this chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years (excluding any period of imprisonment) after 
the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity; . . . . Section 1964 reads in pertinent part: (c) any person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in 
any appropriate United States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit, 
including a reasonable attorney's fee. "
201,2," Of course, plaintiff does not allege that each and every one of the defendants personally performed the physical acts of 
submitting fraudulent claims through the mails and receiving checks issued on the basis of such claims through the mails. In United States v. Ruggiero, 726 F.2d 913 (2d Cir.1984), the court stated that ""for the government to convict on a RICO 
conspiracy it must prove that defendant himself at least agreed to commit two or more predicate crimes."" Id. at 921. However, 
the court also stated that the act of conspiring to commit a predicate act may itself be a predicate act in certain cases.  Id. at 
918-19. Specifically, the court explained, the act of conspiring to commit any substantive offense enumerated in 18 U.S.C. ยง 
1961(1)(A) would constitute an ""act or threat involving"" such offense, and would (if chargeable under state law and punishable 
by imprisonment for more than one year) itself constitute a predicate act under ยง 1961(1)(A).  Similarly, the court explained, the 
act of conspiring to commit any substantive offense enumerated in ยง 1961(1)(D) would constitute an ""offense involving"" such 
offense, and would itself constitute a predicate act under ยง 1961(1)(D). By contrast, the court explained, the act of conspiring to 
commit a crime indictable under any of the U.S. Code sections enumerated in ยง 1961(1)(B) and ยง 1961(1)(C) would not 
constitute an ""act which is indictable under"" such enumerated sections (although such act would be indictable under the 
conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. ยง 371), and would not itself constitute a predicate act under ยง 1961(1)(B) or ยง 1961(1)(C). The 
court thus implied that a participant in a criminal enterprise may under some circumstances be convicted under ยง 1962(c) or ยง 
1962(d) even if he did not agree to personally perform any substantive offense. Applying the above reasoning, it is clear that conspiracy to commit mail fraud is not itself indictable under 18 U.S.C. ยง 1341 (the 
mail fraud statute), and so is not itself a predicate act under ยง 1961(1)(B).  However, aiding and abetting mail fraud would, 
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. ยง 2, be indictable under 18 U.S.C. ยง 1341, and hence would be a predicate act under ยง 1961(1)(B). For reasons which will become clear, it is unnecessary for us to determine whether plaintiff's allegations concerning the conduct 
of any given defendant involved in the instant motions would, if true, make out a violation of ยง 1962(c) or ยง 1962(d) by such 
defendant. We would note in passing that RICO, as interpreted by case law, appears extremely complex. First to commit certain types of 
racketeering activity may itself constitute ""racketeering activity"" under ยง 1961(1)(A) and ยง 1961(1)(D). Second, participation in a 
criminal enterprise (i.e. a conspiracy) affecting commerce, where the participant engages in or agrees to engage in a pattern of 
racketeering activity, is a violation of ยง 1962(c). Third, a conspiracy to violate ยง 1962(c) is itself a violation of ยง 1962(d). "
205,*," Honorable Max Rosenn, Senior Circuit Judge, United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, sitting by designation. "
208,1," Triple M's reliance on United States v. Klearflax Linen Looms Inc., 63 F. Supp. 32 (D. Minn. 1945), is misplaced. That case 
involved a requirements contract rather than merely an agreement to furnish materials for a single job, and was explicitly so 
distinguished by this Court in H.E. Fletcher Co. v. Rock of Ages Corp., supra, 326 F.2d at 17."
208,2," Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 15 (1982), provides in pertinent part that, ""any person who shall be injured in his 
business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue . . . and should recover threefold the 
damages by him sustained."" "
209,3," Nor does any support exist for Triple M's assertion that Assistant Commissioner Bridges denied its substitution request as part 
of some commitment to Tremco or to Triple M's competitors. Bridges's justification -- allowing substitution would be unfair to 
those contractors that had relied on the specifications -- remains uncontroverted. Indeed, we will never know whether 
substitution would have been permitted, for Triple M failed to follow the procedures to which it had promised to adhere."
209,4," Because we hold that summary judgment was properly granted substantially for the reasons stated by the district court, we 
decline to address whether Triple M's action should have been dismissed pursuant to the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. We note 
only that this Court has yet to decide whether the antitrust laws are applicable to anticompetitive activity directed at government 
agencies acting in a proprietary capacity. See Litton Systems, Inc. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 700 F.2d 785, 805 n. 28 (2d Cir. 
1983). "
228,1," For a discussion of the policy factors mentioned by the Supreme Court, see Ostrofe v. H.S. Crocker Co., Inc., 740 F.2d 739 
(9th Cir. 1984); Industrial Inv. Development Corp. v. Mitsui & Co., Ltd., 704 F.2d 785, 786 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 961, 
78 L. Ed. 2d 337, 104 S. Ct. 393-94 (1983); Antitrust Standing After Associated General Contractors: The Issue of Employee 
Retaliatory Discharge, 63 Boston U.L. Rev. 983 (1983)."
228,2," HN6[
] An equitable action to enjoin the activity can be brought under section 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 26 (1982), which has standing requirements less stringent than those under section 4 of the Clayton Act. Equitable relief is available under 
section 16 of the Clayton Act to those with ""threatened loss or damage"" without the limitation that the injury be to ""business or 
property,"" as required by section 4. 2 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law ยง 335e (1978). Furthermore, there are no complex 
issues of damages or speculative or duplicative recovery problems. ""Standing to enjoin an antitrust violation is and should be 
more readily accorded than standing for treble damage purposes."" Id. We need not decide whether the plaintiffs in this action 
would have had standing under section 16, because no such relief was sought. "
231,3," See Hecht v. Pro-Football, Inc., 187 U.S. App. D.C. 73, 570 F.2d 982, 994 (D.C. Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 436 U.S. 956, 57 L. 
Ed. 2d 1121, 98 S. Ct. 3069 (1978), wherein the court stated: Indicia of preparedness must include adequate background and experience in the new field, sufficient financial capability to 
enter it, and the taking of actual and substantial affirmative steps toward entry, ""such as the consummation of relevant 
contracts and procurement of necessary facilities and equipment."" (Footnotes omitted.) "
238,1," There is no issue before us involving discrimination against or differences between medical doctors and doctors of osteopathy.  
The Florida legislature has not treated the two types of doctors differently under the foregoing statute which establishes public 
policy regarding admissions to hospital staffs. The parties have, in effect, treated the two as competitive parts of one ""product 
market"" in the antitrust sense.  We will, therefore, for present purposes not distinguish between them.  When this opinion refers 
to physicians and physicians' ethics, those terms apply to both professions interchangeably. We deal simply with the rejection of 
a doctor's application for admission to a hospital staff and express no views whatsoever as to any similarities or differences 
between the two professions. Under these circumstances the antitrust ramifications involved would be no different concerning 
the admission of either type of physician to a hospital principally staffed with either type of physician. "
241,2," ""As a matter of antitrust law, petitioners [the hospital] may give their anesthesiology business to [a particular doctor] because 
he is the best doctor available, because he is willing to work long hours, or because he is the son-in-law of the hospital 
administrator without violating the per se rule against tying."" Jefferson Parish,    U.S.    n. 511, 104 S. Ct. at 1565 n. 41, 80 L. Ed. 
2d at     n. 51. "
245,3," We have principally addressed in this opinion what in our view constitutes a defense to antitrust charges in this type of case.  
The other side of the coin would be what conduct in other cases of this type could justify the imposition of antitrust liability under 
section 542.18?  The short answer is that, under our approach, anticompetitive purpose plus anticompetitive effect in the 
relevant market could constitute an antitrust violation. In that regard two other questions which we need not address in any detail 
in this case could conceivably exist from the use of this type of purpose-based approach.  First, of what nature must be the 
anticompetitive effect in a particular market which, coupled with anticompetitive purpose, could result in antitrust liability?  The 
law review article endorses the view that there should be no antitrust liability without anticompetitive purpose and substantial 
market power by the hospital.  Kissam, supra, at 659.  We believe that dominant anticompetitive purpose and the kind of 
unreasonable anticompetitive effect sufficient to impose liability in this kind of case under traditional commercial antitrust 
principles could bring about liability.  Second, could an invalid, but good faith, purpose (like that which existed here under the 
trial court's findings relative to one purpose being that the hospital's urology needs were already fulfilled) be enough to shield a 
hospital from antitrust liability in this type of case even when serious anticompetitive effects exist?  We are inclined to the view 
that even in those circumstances (which do not exist here) professional decision-making relative to the quality or efficiency of 
health care should not be subject to antitrust constraints and, therefore, impeded. "
246,4," The term ""market"" in the antitrust field may have different meanings and ramifications in different situations.  See American Bar 
Ass'n, Section of Antitrust Law, Antitrust Law Developments 48-52 (1975); Antitrust Adviser ยงยง 3.24, 3.25, 3.26 (C. Hills 2d 
ed. 1978).  To refer to the potentially multifaceted market aspects of the case at hand, it seems unnecessary to do more than to 
provide the foregoing citations to Pontius and Jefferson Parish.  Jefferson Parish involved a purported tying arrangement 
resulting in the exclusion of a physician from a hospital medical staff. A necessary element of an unlawful tying arrangement 
under traditional antitrust concepts (which the Supreme Court found to have been not proved to exist in that case) is a not 
insubstantial effect upon competition.  See Hyde v. Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2, 686 F.2d 286, 289 (5th Cir. 1982). 
The Supreme Court's conclusions in that regard which we have cited in the text of this opinion are relevant to the same type of 
issue in this case.  Portions of Jefferson Parish might be interpreted to reflect an implied disinclination to impose antitrust liability 
in this context. "
252,1," The defendants are: Prince George's County, Maryland (hereinafter ""the County""); the County Council, sitting as the District 
Council for zoning purposes (hereinafter ""the Council""); Council Members McDonough, Amonett, Cosula, Glendening, Koonce, 
Lombardi, Mills and Wilson (hereinafter ""Council Members""); Zoning Hearing Examiner Cramp (""the Examiner""); the Maryland-
National Capital Park and Planning Commission (""the Commission""); the Greater Washington/Maryland Service Station 
Association (""the Association""); and Victor Rasheed (""Rasheed""), the Association's former Executive Director. The plaintiff is 
Racetrac Petroleum, Inc. (""Racetrac""). To facilitate discussion, the Court uses the following labels to identify the various defendant groups who share similar legal 
positions: the ""Individual County Defendants"" (the Council members and the Examiner); the ""Non-Individual County Defendants"" 
(the County and the Council); the ""County Defendants"" (includes both individual and non-individual county defendants); and the 
""Association Defendants"" (the Association and Rasheed). The Court does not include the Commission when it refers to the 
County defendants and in this respect departs from the terminology used by the plaintiff in its motions and memoranda. 
Occasionally, the Court uses the phrase ""Governmental Defendants"" to indicate both the County Defendants and the 
Commission. "
253,2, The District Council is the County Council sitting for the purpose of zoning decisions.
253,3," Although plaintiff now objects to the criterion of ""need"" for a special exception in the C-S-C zone, a criterion mandated by the 
County's zoning ordinance, plaintiff never questioned the legality or wisdom of that criterion in the course of the zoning 
proceedings on its application. The Commission's Technical Staff Report indicates that the plaintiff, prior to any involvement in 
the case by the Association Defendants, submitted to the staff in support of its application an analysis of plaintiff's proposed use 
""in proximity to competitive facilities"" based on information concerning the relation of the area's population to the ""current level of 
gasoline station service afforded."" "
254,4," The document at issue in this case is the Amended Complaint filed May 21, 1984 (Paper No. 41). Plaintiff's request for leave to 
file a second amended complaint was denied by the Court on July 6, 1984. "
255,5," What the Court denominates as Count Eight is actually titled ""Count VII"" in plaintiff's complaint. Through apparent inadvertence, 
plaintiff titled two consecutive counts as ""Count VII"" and the following count as ""Count IX."" "
256,6," Plaintiff has attempted to effect an unusual retreat from this position by suggesting, in an unsolicited post-argument 
memorandum, that only if the Court decides the issue in plaintiff's favor are there no disputes of fact material to the Noerr-
Pennington question. ""Absent adoption of Racetrac's view,"" argues the plaintiff, ""the issue of whether the . . . doctrine protects 
defendants' conduct should be determined by the jury."" Plaintiff's Memorandum of November 9, 1984, at 9-10 n. 1. "
257,7," The ""Governmental Defendants"" raising the state-action defense are the County Defendants and the Commission. "
258,8," Of course, even if the Edmisten Court had relied upon City of Boulder, it would be of no benefit to the plaintiff inasmuch as the 
Court in City of Boulder expressly declined to decide the validity of the proposition which plaintiff now presses upon this Court.  
City of Boulder, 455 U.S. at 51-52 n. 14."
258,9," See, e.g., Corey v. Look, 641 F.2d 32, 37 (1st Cir. 1981); Affiliated Capital Corp. v. City of Houston, 519 F. Supp. 991, 1027-9 
(S.D.  Tex. 1981), reversed on other grounds 700 F.2d 226 (5th Cir. 1983) (panel opinion) 735 F.2d 1555 (5th Cir. 1984) (en 
banc). In Corey, the governmental defendant operated a parking authority in competition with the plaintiff and was allegedly attempting 
to monopolize the parking lot market. The challenged activity did not involve the exercise of a traditional regulatory function by 
local government. In City of Houston, the trial court denied the city's motion for summary judgment based on state-action 
immunity but entered judgment n.o.v. in favor of the defendants on other grounds.  519 F. Supp. 991. The plaintiff voluntarily 
dismissed its claim against the city defendant prior to appeal, 735 F.2d 1557, so neither appellate opinion in that case addresses 
the city's asserted state-action immunity. "

S. Ct. 2387, 81 L. Ed. 2d 345, 52 U.S.L.W. 3844 (1984)."
259,11," The Court realizes that its holding today is inconsistent with the language used in its Memorandum and Order rejecting similar 
contentions made by defendants in support of their motions to dismiss. See Memorandum and Order of May 21, 1984, at 3-4. 
Having had the opportunity for a fuller consideration of these contentions upon motions for summary judgment, as well as the 
benefit of recent decisions by the Eighth and Ninth Circuits, the Court disaffirms its earlier language to the extent that it is 
inconsistent with the holding herein."
259,12," The Court's holding, like the decision in Parker v. Brown, supra, is rendered as a matter of statutory construction, i.e., an effort 
to determine Congressional purpose regarding the reach of the Sherman Act in light of our federal system. See Parker v. Brown, 
supra, 317 U.S. at 351. Defendants have not suggested, and the Court does not decide, whether the result is required by the 
Tenth Amendment. While the Court holds that the governmental defendants need not meet the Midcal state supervision requirement, it also holds 
below, alternatively, that defendants have sufficiently demonstrated active state supervision of their actions in the instant case. "
260,13," Several of the Circuit Courts of Appeal have adopted tests to determine whether a political subdivision was acting pursuant to 
a clearly articulated state policy to displace competition. See, e.g., Sioux City, supra, 736 F.2d 1207, 1211 (8th Cir. 1974) (state 
legislature must have first, authorized activity, and second, intended to displace competition; state policy to displace competition 
can be inferred if challenged restraint is a ""necessary or reasonable consequence"" of engaging in the authorized activity); Town 
of Hallie v. City of Eau Claire, 700 F.2d 376, 381 (7th Cir. 1983), cert. granted, 467 U.S. 1240, 104 S. Ct. 3508, 82 L. Ed. 2d 818 
(1984) (state policy can be inferred if anticompetitive effect a ""reasonable or foreseeable consequence"" of engaging in the 
authorized activity); Springs Ambulance Service, Inc. v. City of Rancho Mirage, 745 F.2d 1270, 47 Antitrust & Trade Regulation 
Report 858 (9th Cir. 1984) (subdivision must demonstrate not only the existence of a state policy to displace competition, but 
also that state contemplated kinds of actions alleged to be anticompetitive; policy to displace exists if restraint a necessary or 
reasonable consequence of engaging authorized activity). This Court finds it unnecessary to adopt or reject any of these particular formulations. "
261,14," Both plaintiff and defendants have made much of an additional section, added to the Maryland statute in 1983 after the events 
which are the subject of this action, which provides: (a) It has been and shall continue to be the policy of this State that the orderly development and use of land and structures 
requires comprehensive regulation through implementation of planning and zoning controls. (b) It has been and shall continue to be the policy of this State that planning and zoning controls shall be implemented by 
local government. (c) To achieve the public purposes of this regulatory scheme, the General Assembly recognizes that local government 
action will displace or limit economic competition by owners and users of property. (d) It is the policy of the General Assembly and of this State that competition and enterprise shall be so displaced or limited 
for the attainment of the purposes of the State policy for implementing planning and zoning controls as set forth in this 
article and elsewhere in the public local and public general law. . . . Md. Code Ann. art. 28 ยง 7-108.1. Defendants contend that the statutory language (""It has been and shall continue to be the policy of this State . . ."") is dispositive 
of plaintiff's contention that no clearly articulated policy to displace competition existed at the time of the actions now challenged 
in this suit. The Court is unpersuaded that the ""clear articulation"" requirement for state-action immunity can be established 
simpliciter by a post-facto legislative pronouncement. Plaintiff argues that the announcement in 1983 of an express policy to displace competition by zoning regulation conclusively 
demonstrates that no such policy existed at the time of its application for a special exception. Plaintiff apparently seeks to rely for 
this conclusion on the proposition that statutory language will not ordinarily be given a redundant or superfluous interpretation 
when construed by the courts.  While this proposition is true as a general matter, its use is as a tool for a Court to glean a 
legislature's intent in using specific language.  Absent a contrary intention, a court properly should presume that a legislative 
pronouncement was not intended to merely repeat earlier declarations of policy. But such a presumption has no place in cases 
such as the present one where the statutory language (""It has been and shall continue to be the policy . . ."") clearly indicates that 
the legislature intended to be redundant, i.e., that it intended to restate what it believed was already implied by existing statutes. 
Accordingly, plaintiff's reliance on the 1983 provision must fail. Because the Court is unpersuaded by the argument of either side concerning the relevance of ยง 7-108.1, it accords no weight to 
the passage of this section in deciding the issue of whether the Commission and County Defendants acted pursuant to a clearly 
articulated and affirmatively expressed state policy to displace competition with zoning regulation. "
262,15," Under plaintiff's analysis, a county is authorized by the state to prohibit the opening of new filling stations in a given area 
because of its determination that no new facilities are needed in light of existing ones. But a county may not, argues the plaintiff, 
pass an ordinance which prohibits the opening of new filling stations in a given zone subject to an applicant's right to 
demonstrate that existing facilities do not meet the public need in the particular area surrounding the proposed site. As the Court discusses infra, there is no support in Maryland's delegation of zoning authority for such a distinction. Nor can the 
Court discover the logic of why such a distinction might be made."
262,16," The Court does not mean to suggest that a federal court deciding the applicability of state-action immunity to antitrust liability 
may defer to state courts on the ultimate issue of whether the state has a clearly articulated state policy so as to trigger Parker 
immunity, for that question is clearly one of federal law. The Court does find it useful to look to the decisions of the state courts 
for an understanding of the regulatory system which is attacked as violative of federal law. The state-court decisions relied on "
263,," herein demonstrate, for example, that plaintiff's contention, that state law makes a relevant distinction between planning and 
piecemeal zoning, is unfounded. State decisions may also, as noted above, provide pronouncements of state policy to which this 
Court may then apply the Parker analysis to determine, as a matter of federal law, whether the clear articulation test has been 
met. Finally, state-court decisions reviewing local regulatory decisions may furnish evidence from which the federal court may 
conclude, again as a matter of federal law, that the state, through its courts, actively supervises the local regulation."
263,17," With regard to the defendant Commission, the asserted requirement of active state supervision is met regardless of the 
availability of judicial review in the state courts inasmuch as the Commission is itself an agency of the State. See O & B, Inc. v. 
Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, 279 Md. 459, 369 A.2d 553 (1977); Prince George's County v. 
Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, 269 Md. 202, 306 A.2d 223 (1973); Md. Code Ann. Art. 28 ยง 1-101. It is interesting to note that the plaintiff, who argues in this Court that active state supervision of anticompetitive local zoning 
decisions is necessary to avoid federal antitrust liability, eschewed such state supervision in the proceedings about which it now 
complains. Following the District Council's final denial of plaintiff's special exception application, plaintiff filed an appeal of right in 
the state courts which it voluntarily dismissed prior to bringing the present federal action. "
264,18," Compare MCI v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 708 F.2d 1081, 1159-60 (7th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 891, 
104 S. Ct. 234, 78 L. Ed. 2d 226 (defendant's FCC filings protected by Noerr-Pennington but other activities not aimed at 
influencing governmental action not protected) with Scott v. City of Sioux City, Trade Cas. (CCH) ยง 65,203 (N.D. Iowa 1982) 
(where legitimate lobbying is combined with illegal actions, the Noerr-Pennington exemption has no application). "
265,19," Of course, the converse is also true. That some of a defendant's conduct is protected by Noerr-Pennington immunity does not 
preclude defendant's liability for unprotected acts. MCI, footnote 15 supra. And protected acts may sometimes be used as 
evidence to show the unlawful purpose with which a defendant engaged in unprotected acts. Id.; Webb v. Utah Tour Brokers 
Assn., 568 F.2d 670, 674 (10th Cir. 1977)."
265,20," See Memorandum and Order of May 21, 1984, at 5; Memorandum and Order of May 1, 1984, at 3. "
266,21," Plaintiff filed its special exception application in November of 1981. The Commission's technical staff report recommended 
denial of the application prior to any involvement in the case by the Association Defendants. Plaintiff was afforded a two-day 
hearing before the hearing examiner at which plaintiff's application was opposed by a variety of local groups and individuals, 
including the Association Defendants. Racetrac was also given a hearing before the Planning Board of the Commission at which 
hearing the Association Defendants did not appear. Finally, Racetrac appealed the denial of its application to the County Council 
sitting as the District Council."
266,22," At no stage of the zoning process did plaintiff challenge the propriety of the zoning ordinance under which its application was 
considered. Nor did plaintiff ever complain of any impediments to a full presentation of its views before each body considering its 
request."
266,23," Upon inquiry from the Court at oral argument, counsel for the plaintiff offered no explanation as to why plaintiff did not pursue 
its appeal in state court of the decision denying its special exception application."
266,24," Plaintiff argues that opposition of the Association Defendants to a number of special exception applications constitutes the 
bringing of repetitive and baseless claims with the purpose and effect of discouraging competitors from invoking governmental 
process. The Court rejects this contention for a number of reasons. First, there is no evidence that defendants' opposition was 
either automatic or baseless. Second, the record indicates that the intent of the Association was to defeat applications, a 
protected activity. Third, the opposition of defendants imposed no additional burdens on applicants. Fourth, there is no evidence 
that any potential applicants were discouraged from invoking the zoning processes. As discussed above, it is clear that plaintiff 
was never hindered or dissuaded from bringing and pressing its application. Thus, even if plaintiff's claim of baseless and 
reflexive opposition was supported by facts, which it is not, the injuries which it asserts have no relation to that claim. "

District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the

268,29," Plaintiff suggested in an earlier memo that its ยง 1983 action was predicated upon the denial of ""the right or privilege to 
compete as guaranteed by the federal antitrust laws."" Plaintiff's Opposition to County Defendants' Motion for Summary 
Judgment at 16. This contention is at variance with plaintiff's complaint and was apparently abandoned by plaintiff at oral 
argument. In any event, the Court does not believe that violation of the antitrust laws may be the basis for a ยง 1983 action under 
the holding in Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 65 L. Ed. 2d 555, 100 S. Ct. 2502 (1980) (violation of Social Security Act may be 
basis for ยง 1983 liability), that some federal statutes may provide rights which may be redressed by ยง 1983. The Sherman Act is 
more akin to the pollution control and marine protection acts reviewed by the Court after Thiboutot in Middlesex County 
Sewerage v. Sea Clammers, 453 U.S. 1, 69 L. Ed. 2d 435, 101 S. Ct. 2615 (1981). In Middlesex, the Court held that the 
existence of express and comprehensive remedies in those acts demonstrates that Congress intended to preclude or supplant 
any remedy otherwise available under ยง 1983.  Id. 453 U.S. at 20-21 See also Hymes v. Harnett County Board of Education, 664 
F.2d 410, 412 (4th Cir. 1981); Day v. Wayne County Board of Auditors, 749 F.2d 1199 (6th Cir. 1984); Chesapeake Bay 
Foundation v. Virginia State Water Control Board, 501 F. Supp. 821 (E.D. Va. 1980)."
268,30," The ordinance which plaintiff now challenges was in effect prior to the time plaintiff acquired any interest in the subject 
property and prior to plaintiff's special exception application. The case is thus readily distinguishable from Scott v. Greenville 
County, 716 F.2d 1409, 1418-19 (4th Cir. 1983), where plaintiff was entitled to a building permit under then-existing state law, 
which permit was later denied after unlawful intervention by the county council. "

sufficient due process). "
270,32," Plaintiff argues that the Boulder decision represented ""clearly established law"" of ""tremendous significance"" which defendants 
should have known was applicable to their conduct in deciding plaintiff's special exception application. Plaintiff does not explain 
its failure to argue, or even suggest, at any stage during the zoning proceedings that the Boulder decision was relevant to the 
decision before the County Defendants."
270,33," It is clear that to the extent that plaintiff would allege liability based on the enactment of the zoning ordinance's need criterion, 
the Individual County Defendants are absolutely immune. Bruce v. Riddle, 631 F.2d 272 (4th Cir. 1980)."
270,34," The Court does not decide as a matter of law whether plaintiff can establish a conspiracy among the Association Defendants 
and Association members. Similarly, the Court does not decide whether any conspiracy may have existed among the 
Governmental Defendants. "
271,35," Even if the plaintiff had successfully asserted another basis for the exercise of federal subject-matter jurisdiction, the Court 
might well decline to exercise such jurisdiction over state-law issues involving in a complex local regulatory system. See

291,1," At oral argument, we were informed that the Puerto Rican assets of Gulf and Chevron have recently been merged. "
292,2," Because the plaintiff in this action is within the ""core"" of possible plaintiffs under ยง 16, we have no need to examine the outer 
limits of standing under this section, and this discussion should not be interpreted as adumbrating requirements that must be 
met by all ยง 16 plaintiffs. "
294,3," We must also note that the defendants were not alone in disregarding the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Our review of the 
record reveals that Caribe, too, was far from scrupulous in following the Rules. The cavalier attitude of the parties towards the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the court's orders cannot be condoned. "
295,4," We note that, even if the defendants' late-filed affidavits are factored into the Rule 56 equation, the calculus remains 
unchanged; genuine issues of material fact nonetheless appear distinctly and in some abundance."
295,5," One of the few facts about which the parties did not disagree was the relevant geographic market -- the island of Puerto Rico. 
Some disagreement may exist, however, on the existence of relevant geographic submarkets. "

298,7," At the time his bill was called for discussion on the floor of the Senate, Senator Sherman identified the impetus of the legislation 
later to be known as the Sherman Act: The popular mind is agitated with problems that may disturb social order, and among them all none is more threatening 
than the inequality of condition, of wealth, and opportunity that has grown within a single generation out of the concentration 
of capital into vast combinations to control production and trade and to break down competition. These combinations 
already defy or control powerful transportation corporations and reach State authorities. They reach out their Briarean arms 
to every part of our country. They are imported from abroad. Congress alone can deal with them, and if we are unwilling or 
unable there will soon be a trust for every production and a master to fix the price for every necessity of life."

25 (1984) (""Antitrust reflected the deep-rooted and persistent American fear that concentrated private power could undermine 
democratic government"")."
298,8," Senator Sherman explained: ""The first section, being a remedial statute, would be construed liberally, with a view to promote its 
object. It defines a civil remedy, and the courts will construe it liberally. . . ."" 21 Cong. Rec. 2456 (daily ed. March 21, 1890). "
299,9," The Supreme Court has noted a number of ""instances in which Congress has regulated and restricted the power of the federal 
courts to grant injunctions."" Yakus v. United States, 321 U.S. 414, 442 n.8, 88 L. Ed. 834, 64 S. Ct. 660 (1944). See, e.g., "

300,10," At the time the Clayton Act was passed, a split in authority existed among the circuits regarding the availability of injunctive 
relief to a private party suing under the Sherman Act. Although the Sherman Act expressly conferred the power to initiate 
""proceedings in equity"" for injunctive or other equitable relief only upon the government, the Sixth Circuit affirmed a case where 
the district court had granted a preliminary injunction to a private party pursuant to its inherent powers of equity. Through the 
injunction, the court had forbidden an acquiring corporation to vote the stock of its new acquisition, and then, after trial, had 
dissolved the injunction and dismissed the bill. See Bigelow v. Calumet & Hecla Mining Co., 155 F. 869 (W.D. Mich. 1907), aff'd, 
167 F. 704 (6th Cir. 1909). The Second Circuit, however, held that injunctions were not available to private parties under the 
Sherman Act. See Greater New York Film Rental Co. v. Biograph Co., 203 F. 39 (2d Cir. 1913) (by implication). These cases, 
and the question whether inherent powers of equity were withdrawn from the courts under the Sherman Act, were discussed in 
the committee hearings. See Senate Hearings at 629-31 (issue and cases); House Hearings at 485-87 (case), 963-64 (issue but 
not cases). In view of these discussions, it is noteworthy that no exclusion of inherent powers of equity, or of certain kinds of 
injunctive relief, was included in the Clayton Act. "
301,11," The evolution of judicial powers of equity was a subject before congressional committee hearings on the Clayton Act and its 
unsuccessful precursors. See, e.g., Senate Hearings at 1091-95 (witness Samuel Gompers); 1130-1163. "
302,12," See e.g., 51 Cong. Rec. 9090 (daily ed. May 22, 1914) (remarks of Rep. Mitchell); at 9169 (daily ed. May 23, 1914) (remarks 
of Rep. Nelson); at 16326 (daily ed. Oct. 8, 1914) (remarks of Rep. Nelson); H.R. No. 627, 63d Cong., 2d Sess. 648, 652, 689-
90 (remarks of witness Louis Brandeis); at 666 (Rep. Nelson) (1914) (hereinafter House Hearings)."
302,13," See, e.g., the discussions identified in note 10 supra; House Hearings at 263 (Rep. Floyd); at 273 (Rep. Nelson); 331 (Rep. 
McCoy); 51 Cong. Rec. at 15821-23 (Sept. 28, 1914) (Sen. Reed); at 15864 (Sept. 29, 1914) (Sen. Reed); at 15864-5 (Sept. 29, 
1914) (Sen. Overman)."
302,14," As Arthur Corbin observed, a ""word appearing suddenly, in empty space and with no history, would express nothing at all. To 
be expressive of any meaning, all words must have a context and a history. . . ."" 3 Corbin, Contracts 90 (1960)."
302,15," Injunctive relief had regularly been sought and awarded to private plaintiffs under state antitrust laws and in common law suits 
alleging restraint of trade and price fixing. See, e.g., Gibbs v. Consolidated Gas, 130 U.S. 396, 32 L. Ed. 979, 9 S. Ct. 553 
(1889) (price fixing agreement). "
303,16," During the House hearings, a famous antitrust lawyer of the day, Louis Brandeis, suggested remolding the power to order a 
""partition."" Brandeis stated his belief that the courts already had this power -- the power to order the division and sale of assets -- 
but that it was doubted by some members of the judiciary, as evidenced by the American Tobacco opinion on remand, see 191 
F. 371 (S.D.N.Y. 1911), and was not utilized as broadly as it should. Brandeis proposed that Congress ""educate"" the courts and 
facilitate achievement of the antitrust goals by passing statutes specifically authorizing the use of this and other equitable powers 
in the antitrust context. See House Hearings at 652."
303,17," Other traditional equitable tools, specifically the injunctive power, were refashioned for the purpose of quelling labor strikes 
and boycotts. See generally F. Frankfurter & N. Greene, The Labor Injunction (1930). "
304,18," Evidently this perspective was shared by some officials in the Justice Department. See 51 Cong. Rec. 15864 (daily ed. Sept. 
29, 1914) (""The fundamental weakness in the enforcement of the antitrust act in previous administrations was the failure to insist 
upon a real dissolution of monopolies and combinations which the courts had adjudged unlawful"") (excerpt from Justice Dept. 
letter quoted by Sen. Reed)."
304,19," It appears that over the years the legal meaning of the concepts ""dissolution"" and ""divestiture"" has become somewhat more 
settled than in 1914, so much so that the Supreme Court has recently pronounced them to be to a ""large degree 
interchangeable."" United States v. du Pont & Co., 366 U.S. 316, at 330 n.11, 6 L. Ed. 2d 318, 81 S. Ct. 1243 (1961). In 
reviewing the Court's cases, we found that the term ""dissolution"" tended to be used when ordering a remedy for violations of ยง 1 
and ยง 2 of the Sherman Act, but not for Clayton Act ยง 7 violations. See, e.g., United States v. Reading Co., 253 U.S. 26, 64 L. 
Ed. 760, 40 S. Ct. 425 (1920) (dissolution); United States v. Lehigh Valley R.R., 254 U.S. 255, 65 L. Ed. 253, 41 S. Ct. 104 
(1920) (same); United States v. Southern Pacific Co., 259 U.S. 214, 66 L. Ed. 907, 42 S. Ct. 496 (1922) (same). This was 
especially true for the older cases. ""Divestitute"" of some assets or interests was frequently ordered as a part of the remedy of 
dissolution, see, e.g., United States v. Crescent Amusement Co., 323 U.S. 173, 189, 89 L. Ed. 160, 65 S. Ct. 254 (1944) 
(Sherman Act ยงยง 1, 2); Schine Chain Theatres v. United States, 334 U.S. 110, 92 L. Ed. 1245, 68 S. Ct. 947 (1948) (same); 
International Boxing Club of New York v. United States, 358 U.S. 242, 3 L. Ed. 2d 270, 79 S. Ct. 245 (1959) (same). These last 
three cases clarify that a distinction between the two terms was felt at one time. In Schine Theatres, the Court stated: ""The plan 
does not provide for the dissolution of the Schine circuit through the separation of the several affiliated corporations as was done 
in [Crescent Amusement]. It keeps the circuit intact in that sense but requires Schine to sell certain theatres. . . . Schine is to be 
divested of more than 50 of its theatres."" 334 U.S. at 126-27. And again, our view that a ""dissolution"" tends to be ordered where 
monopolies and restraints of trade are found, and has as one of its essential elements a major judicial reorganization of the 
corporation, is supported by International Boxing. There, the Court ordered dissolution of the combination, recognizing that new 
corporations would be formed to handle the business formerly transacted by the combination. The Court further noted that 
""dissolution might well have the salutary effect of completely clearing new horizons that the trial judge was attempting to create 
in the boxing world, especially when effected in conjunction with the stock divestiture provision."" 358 U.S. at 260-61 (emphasis 
added). "
305,20," Section 16, 15 U.S.C. ยง 26, was originally ยง 13 of the proposed Clayton Act. Although most of the legislative history speaks in 
terms of ยง 13, we shall avoid confusion by referring to the provision as ยง 16."
305,21," While the fears and doubts of the minority are not an authoritative guide to the construction of legislation, see Schwegmann 
Brothers v. Calvert Distillers Corp., 341 U.S. 384, 394, 95 L. Ed. 1035, 71 S. Ct. 745 (1951), their report did comprise the only 
specific explanation of the meaning of the private injunction provision that was readily accessible to the whole Congress. 
Moreover, the Supreme Court has consistently favored the ""presumably well considered and carefully prepared committee 
report"" over informal or casual statements made in the course of the legislative process.  Id. at 396 (Jackson, J. concurring); 
United States v. Auto Workers, 352 U.S. 567, 585, 1 L. Ed. 2d 563, 77 S. Ct. 529 (1957); United States v. Public Utilities 
Commission, 345 U.S. 295, 97 L. Ed. 1020, 73 S. Ct. 706 (1953)."
305,22," The Senate committee also sought to delete the exception for common carriers the House had provided in ยง 16, although it 
ultimately failed to do so. "
306,23," Representative Carlin then turned to clarify the relaxed standard for anticompetitive practices under the bill: The Sherman law in its operation is limited to three things: First, a contract or combination in the form of a trust or 
otherwise; second, a conspiracy in restraint of trade; third, an attempt to monopolize. There is nothing about competition in 
the Sherman law. There must be actual restraint of trade under the Sherman law to bring anyone under either its civil or 
criminal process. Under this bill there has to be only a lessening of competition. Competition may be lessened without restraint of trade. 
Competition may be lessened without attempt to monopolize. Competition may be lessened without conspiracy. It may be 
the natural effect of the putting together in close relationship through a holding company of two corporations that are natural 
competitors, or ought to be. Yet there would not be restraint. So instead of subtracting from the Sherman law, . . . we have 
added to the Sherman law a most effective rule by which the actions of these combinations in the future may be 
determined. . . ."
306,51," Cong. Rec. 9271 (daily ed. May 26, 1914). "
307,24," The author and prime proponent of the Senate amendment expressed his view of a dissolution: Wh[at] I propose [is] that we shall have a real decree, that there shall be a real burial, and that we shall sod down the grave 
upon the monster that was created in defiance of law, but that we shall at the same time preserve its parts and restore them 
to competition and activity. . . ."
307,51," Cong. Rec. 15864 (Sept. 29, 1914) (remarks of Sen. Reed). "
308,25," Our belief that Representative Floyd's comments cannot be taken as stating a Judiciary Committee intention regarding the 
scope of ยง 16 is supported by an exchange between Representative Floyd and a later witness. Floyd stated during the hearings 
on February 27, 1914, in reference to another proposed section ""the purpose of these provisions as tentatively drafted. . . ."" The 
next witness that day then begins his comments by referring to that clarification and stating, ""but as that point has been disposed 
of by the committee, . . . it is unnecessary to discuss that phase."" Representative Floyd responded: ""I think it has not been 
disposed of, Mr. Harlan. There are 21 members of this Committee, and matters are not so easily disposed of. I simply made an 
explanation as one member of the subcommittee that had prepared the bill, as to my view of it. I would be very glad . . . if you 
would state your views. . . ."" House Hearings at 1049-53. "
310,26," The Ninth Circuit explicitly holds this to be the House Judiciary Committee's view, and states that ""whether Congress shared 
this intention is not subject to rigorous proof."" I.T.T., 518 F.2d at 922. But the opinion treats its view of the Committee's 
understanding cum intention as that of Congress, viz., asking ""whether by refusing to allow private 'dissolution' suits, Congress 
also refused to allow private 'divestiture' suits."" Id."
310,27," The problems inherent in that approach to statutory construction have been elaborated by Professor Brest: [such an interpreter] must determine what the adopters intended future interpreters to make of their substantive views. 
Even if she can learn how the adopters intended contemporary interpreters to construe the [statute], she cannot assume 
they intended the same canons to apply one or two hundred years later. Perhaps they wanted to bind the future as closely 
as possible to their own notions. Perhaps they intended a particular provision to be interpreted with increasing breadth as 
time went on. Or -- more likely than not -- the adopters may have had no intentions at all concerning these matters.  Brest, The Misconceived Quest for the Original Understanding, 60 B.U.L. Rev. at 220 (footnotes omitted). Although Professor 
Brest's comments were directed to constitutional interpretation, they are equally appropriate here. See Appalachian Coals, Inc. 
v. United States, 288 U.S. 344, 351, 359-60, 77 L. Ed. 825, 53 S. Ct. 471 (1933) (""as a charter of freedom, the [Sherman Act] 
has a generality and adaptability comparable to that found to be desirable in constitutional provisions""); NBO Industries v. 
Brunswick Corp., 523 F.2d 262, 298 (3d Cir. 1975) (antitrust laws are almost an ""economic constitution"" for this nation), rev'd on 
other grounds sub nom.  Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, 429 U.S. 477, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701, 97 S. Ct. 690 (1977)."

broad terms of the statute itself . . . read in the light of Congress' belief that private antitrust litigation is one of the surest "
311,," weapons for effective enforcement of the antitrust laws""); Cabell v. Markham, 148 F.2d 737, 739 (2d Cir.) (L. Hand, J.) (""it is one 
of the surest indexes of a mature and developed jurisprudence not to make a fortress out of the dictionary; but to remember that 
statutes always have some purpose or object to accomplish, whose sympathetic and imaginative discovery is the surest guide to 
their meaning""), aff'd, 326 U.S. 404, 90 L. Ed. 165, 66 S. Ct. 193 (1945). "
316,1," SEPA administers the Alabama-Georgia, Kerr-Philpott, Cumberland Basin, Jim Woodruff and Laurel systems. "
317,2," Greenwood's complaint charged that Mississippi Power Company conspired with other members of the Southern Company 
system and with SEPA and the Department of Interior to impose unreasonable restraints of trade in commerce at all levels of 
production, transmission and distribution of electric power in Mississippi.  The complaint further charged that Mississippi Power 
individually monopolized and conspired to monopolize trade in the transmission, distribution and sale of electric power at 
wholesale and retail in Mississippi. Specifically, the complaint alleged that pursuant to the conspiracy five things were done: (1) By the August 1, 1976 contract, 
Mississippi Power Company ""established a restrictive division of markets for federal power generated, transmitted, and sold by 
SEPA and the Department of Interior under authority of Section 5 of the Flood Control Act."" (2) All energy generated by SEPA 
and sold in Mississippi was sold to Mississippi Power Company, which had agreed not to resell any of the power outside its 
territory and to resell only to preference agencies inside that territory. (3) This ""arrangement"" barred competition for acquisition 
of federal power by entities outside Mississippi Power's territory. (4) Benefits of ""peaking power and capacity power"" from federal 
projects were restricted to the exclusive use of Mississippi Power Company which restricted the wheeling of power to electric 
systems within its service territory or those of its sister companies.  (5) Greenwood was barred from obtaining power from 
competitors who could deliver only by use of the Southern companies' transmission facilities and was thus denied the benefit of 
the economy energy interchange operations and other benefits of pooling.  The complaint sought both injunctive and monetary 
relief. "
318,3," For a more detailed treatment of the policy debate over SEPA's options for marketing federal hydropower, see, for example, 
Interior Department Appropriations for 1953: Hearings on H.R. 7176 Before a Subcommittee of the Senate Comm. on 
Appropriations, 82d Cong., 2d Sess. 1169 (1952) (statement of Harllee Branch, Jr., President of Georgia Power Company); id. at 
1215 (statement of L.P. Sweat, President of Mississippi Power Company). "
319,4," Specifically, Mississippi Power Company contended that it was never requested by SEPA to provide any service to Greenwood 
because Greenwood was outside the area in which the government chose to market its power.  Mississippi Power pointed out 
that this decision not to market any of the Georgia-Alabama hydroelectric power to Greenwood was reconfirmed in 1977, after 
SEPA had contracted with Mississippi Power, by the Department of the Interior and the Department of Energy in a public 
rulemaking which established the government's marketing policy.  Mississippi further pointed out that by this marketing policy, 
Georgia-Alabama System of Projects, 45 Fed.Reg. 65140 (October 1, 1980), the Department of Energy proposed in 1980 to sell 
power originating in Tennessee and Kentucky in the Cumberland System to Greenwood -- power over which Mississippi Power 
had no control.  This was the first power offered by the government to Greenwood."
319,5," Mississippi Power asserted that its cooperation with SEPA had benefitted the public and consumers in the following ways: it 
increased the number of bulk power suppliers operating in Mississippi by providing SEPA access to them across its lines; it 
provided a relatively low cost source of power for Mississippi Power's principal retail competitors and provided a relatively low 
cost source of power for the Southern Mississippi Electric Power Association, assertedly a competitor of Mississippi Power 
Company; finally, Mississippi Power's cooperation had displaced wholesale sales in Mississippi it could otherwise have made 
itself. "
322,6," Rule 704 provides: Testimony in the form of an opinion or inference otherwise admissible is not objectionable because it embraces an ultimate 
issue to be decided by the trier of fact. "
323,7," Our decision on this point makes it equally unnecessary for us to address Mississippi Power's complaint that affidavits of 
Copeland and Russell contained inadmissible legal conclusions outside the scope of Fed.R.Evid. 704."
323,8," The Court in Copperweld held that a corporation and it wholly-owned subsidiaries must be considered as a single economic 
unit for purposes of Section 1 conspiracy claims.  Given the unity of interest shared by a parent corporation and its wholly-owned 
subsidiary, their common objectives and common corporate consciousness, the Court reasoned that a combination of such 
entities was not a concentration of separate economic forces violative of Section 1.  Relying on Copperweld, we held in Century 
Oil that two corporations under the common control and ownership of three individuals could not combine or conspire in violation 
of Section 1.  As we noted in Century Oil, given Copperweld there is no relevant difference between combinations by a 
corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary and combinations by two or more corporations wholly owned by a third corporation.  
""A contract between them does not join formerly distinct economic units.  In reality they have always had 'a unity of purpose or a 
common design.'"" 737 F.2d at 1317, quoting Copperweld, 104 S. Ct. at 2742. "
325,9," The problem stems in part from the fact that determining whether the petitioning conduct was a sham often involves questions 
of motive or subjective intent.  For example, the conduct protected by the Court in Noerr was an advertising campaign by the 
railroads directed against the trucking industry and intended to persuade the state legislature to enact laws detrimental to 
truckers.  If the ad campaign had been instituted for the purpose of injuring the trucking industry directly, rather than in an effort 
to persuade the legislature to take action, the activity would have been a sham. Similarly, if a competitor instituted an action 
against his rival before a regulatory agency in order to force him to defend against the action rather than in hopes of a favorable 
agency ruling, the activity would not be a bona fide petitioning conduct.  Developing criteria to separate legitimate efforts from 
others is not simple.  See generally P. Areeda, Antitrust Law para. 203 (1982 Supp.). "
327,10," For example, the Southern companies relented on their insistence that the government not contract directly with preference 
customers. The companies also agreed to include a provision in the wheeling contracts that would guarantee that the rate 
charged preference customers for supplemental power (the power requirements of the preference customers over and above 
that supplied by SEPA) would not be increased by the companies if the customers decided to purchase power from SEPA."
327,11," The sole proffered evidence in support of Greenwood's theory is a statement by Charles W. Leavy, a former SEPA official, in a 
hearing before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The Commission was evaluating a certain exclusive dealing provision 
contained in the 1956 contract between SEPA and Georgia Power.  Leavy stated that SEPA accepted the challenged provision 
as proposed by Georgia Power because it was made a necessary condition to Georgia's agreement to wheel any power at all.  
This solitary hearsay statement, however, is not sufficient to raise a fact issue for trial. "
329,12," SEPA explained to Greenwood that it had thoroughly considered Greenwood's request for power but for a number of reasons 
declined to honor it.  SEPA reasoned first that such an extension of the marketing area might spread power resources too thinly 
because other preference entities similarly situated to Greenwood might also press requests for power were Greenwood given 
an allocation.  SEPA also pointed to the fact that firming and transmission costs might be increased if the marketing area were 
extended off of the Southern system. Greenwood's expert, Whitfield Russell, an engineer, swore that ""this series of statements by SEPA and Interior officials, 
although sometimes correct, are not based upon solid engineering, system planning or ratemaking principles."" Such principles 
are not necessarily the sole criteria for judging SEPA's performance, however, and are unresponsive to the reasons given 
Greenwood for denying it power. "
330,13," The Court in Cantor made plain that the anticompetitive scheme challenged there -- a program whereby Detroit Edison 
provided its customers with light bulbs at not charge -- was created by the utility long before the government agency became 
involved and that it was the option of the utility to have and continue the program, not the government.  Thus the Court felt 
justified in concluding that the restraint was not simply the result of government action: When regulations merely takes the form of approval of a tariff proposed by the company, it surely has not increased the 
company's risk of violating the law.  The respondent utility maintained its lamp-exchange program both before and after it 
was regulated. The approval of the program by the Michigan Commission provided the company with an arguable defense 
to the antitrust charge, but did not increase its exposure to liability. "
330,428," U.S. at 599-600, 96 S. Ct. at 3121-3122. "
331,14," Some courts have suggested a commercial-governmental dichotomy to distinguish agreements with the government that are 
protected from those that are not.  See, e.g., Hecht v. Pro-Football, Inc., 144 U.S. App. D.C. 56, 444 F.2d 931, 939 
(D.C.Cir.1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1047, 92 S. Ct. 701, 30 L. Ed. 2d 736 (1972); George R. Whitten, Jr. v. Paddock Pool 
Builders, 424 F.2d 25, 33-34 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 850, 91 S. Ct. 54, 27 L. Ed. 2d 88 (1970). The idea is that there 
should be protection where the state either creates or contracts with a private entity which becomes the state's sole 
instrumentality carrying out what would otherwise be a governmental function, see, e.g., E.W. Wiggins Airways, Inc. v. 
Massachusetts Port Authority, 362 F.2d 52 (1st Cir.1966), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 947, 87 S. Ct. 320, 17 L. Ed. 2d 226 (1966) (no 
antitrust liability where government body let an exclusive contract for essential support services at Boston's Logan Airport), but 
that Noerr-Pennington protection is inapplicable where the government engages in a purely commercial decision. This distinction is easy to apply in cases at either extreme.  All would agree that antitrust liability should not attach in exclusive 
franchise agreements such as that in E.W. Wiggins Airways, and that, conversely, if as the result of a price fixing agreement by 
private parties the government pays more for products it purchases in the marketplace, the participants in the anticompetitive 
scheme should not escape liability because of the identity of the victim.  The lines are not always so clearly drawn, however, as 
the present case indicate.  We agree with the Ninth Circuit that there should be no commercial exception to Noerr-Pennington 
and that the protected status of commercial arrangements with government should hinge on the protected status of the 
petitioning conduct itself.  See In re Airport Car Rental Antitrust Litigation, 693 F.2d 84, 87-88 (9th Cir.1982), cert. denied, 462 
U.S. 1133, 103 S. Ct. 3114, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1368 (1983). Although some have suggested that our own decision in Woods Exploration & Producing Co. v. Aluminum Co. of America, 438 
F.2d 1286 (5th Cir.1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1047, 92 S. Ct. 701, 30 L. Ed. 2d 736 (1972), espoused the commercial 
exception, we think that such a characterization is erroneous.  Woods held that where the defendants filed false information with 
the Texas Railroad Commission their activities constituted an abuse of the administrative process and were not entitled to First 
Amendment protection.  Such conduct falls within the sham exception to the Noerr-Pennington doctrine.  See generally P. 
Areeda, Antitrust Law para. 204 (1982 Supp.)."
331,15," Indeed such a course of action has been pursued by Greenwood in the present case.  Greenwood has filed suit against the 
Department of Energy requesting a retroactive allocation of SEPA power.  See Greenwood Utilities Commission v. Schlesinger, 
515 F. Supp. 653 (M.D.Ga.1981) (partial summary judgment in favor of Department of Energy), complaint dismissed as moot, 
Civil Action No. 77-179-MAC (August 21, 1984), appeal pending No. 84-8069 (11th Cir.1984). "

344,1," Tropical Park apparently owns about 200 of these stalls, and Calder owns the rest; but each corporation utilizes all of the stalls 
during their seasonal racing periods."
344,2," All of the horses for which applications are submitted apparently meet the qualifications required for participating in 
thoroughbred racing in Florida."
344,3," The court defined an ""unreasonable"" restraint as one which is intended to prejudice the public interest in open and unrestricted 
competition, or which actually tends to prejudice this interest. "
345,4," The court found, as a matter of law, that the ""effect on interstate commerce"" requirement of section 1 had been established in 
the case."
345,5," HN5[
] Under the rule of reason, a restraint will be held illegal only if it unreasonably harms competition.  See NCAA, 104 S. Ct. at 2962; Topco, 405 U.S. at 606-07, 92 S. Ct. at 1133."
345,6," HN6[
] The ""touchstone"" of per se illegality is the anti-competitive market impact resulting from the type of restraints in 
question.  Construction Aggregate Transport, Inc. v. Florida Rock Industries, Inc., 710 F.2d 752, 777-78; see NCAA, 104 S.Ct at 
2959-62. Some examples of per se illegal restraints are price-fixing agreements, and horizontal divisions of markets between 
competitors. See Construction Aggregate, 710 F.2d at 772."
345,7," In Klor's, a retail appliance store sued another retailer and manufacturers and distributors of appliances alleging a conspiracy 
not to sell to the plaintiff, or to sell only at discriminatory prices and unfavorable terms.  The Supreme Court held the alleged 
conduct to be a violation of the Sherman Act and remanded for trial, stating that, ""group boycotts, or concerted refusals by "
346,," traders to deal with other traders, have long been held to be"" in the category of per se illegal conduct.  359 U.S. at 212, 79 S. Ct. 
at 709."
346,8," In McQuade, the Fifth Circuit set forth three categories of cases where collective refusals to deal have been held to be per se 
illegal: first, horizontal combinations among traders at one level of distribution, whose purpose is to exclude direct competitors 
from the market; second, vertical combinations among traders at different marketing levels, designed to exclude from the market 
direct competitors of some members of the combination; and third, combinations designed to influence coercively the trade 
practices of boycott victims, rather than to eliminate them as competitors. 467 F.2d at 186-87. The court felt that the rule of 
reason should be applied to other types of collective refusals to deal, if no elements of exclusionary or coercive conduct are 
present.  Id. at 187. But see Construction Aggregate, 710 F.2d at 777-78 (current touchstone of per se illegality is market impact 
of the restrictions, rather than the presence of exclusionary conduct)."
346,9," However, there are even exceptions to the per se rule in this situation.  For example, certain forms of self-regulation by 
cooperative organizations such as trade associations and sports organizations will be found exempt from per se analysis.  II 
Kintner, Federal Antitrust Law, ยง 10.34; see e.g., NCAA, 104 S. Ct. at 2961; see generally, M & H Tire, 733 F.2d at 980-984 
(discussion of antitrust law relating to sports regulation). The combination alleged in the present case does not fall within the sports regulation exception.  This exception generally 
applies in a situation where a regulatory organization sets forth rules and procedures essential to the existence of or survival of a 
sport. See, e.g., NCAA, 104 S. Ct. at 2961; M & H Tire, 733 F.2d at 981."
346,10," Construction Aggregate sets forth three categories of horizontal arrangements which warrant per se prohibitions.  710 F.2d at 
775. Since we conclude that the combination in the present case is not ""horizontal,"" we need not consider the application of 
those categories to this case."
346,11," Appellants contend that the race tracks compete against each other for the assignment of racing dates by the State of Florida.  
On the record of the case as presented to us, this contention is doubtful.  The fact that the two corporations have interlocking 
officers and operate on the same track negates any inference that the corporations compete for racing dates: it seems more 
likely that one corporation was specifically set up to hold racing meets in the summer, while the other was specifically set up to 
hold racing meets in the winter. "
347,12," A vertical restraint is a combination of entities operating at different levels of the market structure, such as manufacturers and 
distributors.  Oreck Corp v. Whirlpool Corp., 579 F.2d 126, 131 (2d Cir.1978) (en banc), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 946, 99 S. Ct. 
340, 58 L. Ed. 2d 338 (1979). If the appellants had alleged a combination between the race tracks and the ""favored"" trainers 
who received on-track stall space, that would have qualified as a vertical restraint."
347,13," Practices that result in price-fixing and/or output limitations are often condemned as per se illegal.  See NCAA, 104 S. Ct. at 
2960."
347,14," The refusal to allocate free, on-track stall space to the appellants does not seem to affect the quantity or quality of the horse 
races, since appellants' horses are still permitted to participate in the races held by the defendant tracks."
347,15," Kintner states that concerted refusals to deal have ""been held subject to the rule of reason where the refusing parties are a 
horizontal combination of traders which refuse to deal with a non-competing party at another level of competition."" II Kintner, 
Federal Antitrust law, ยง 10.33.  In such a situation, the parties involved in the combination are not competing with those alleging 
a boycott, and such actions are oftentimes legitimate business decisions.  Id. This seems to be somewhat descriptive of the 
situation in our present case, except that here the combination is not even between horizontal competitors. The McQuade case, 467 F.2d 178, is cited by Kintner in ยง 10.33, and supports an application of the rule of reason in the present 
case.  In McQuade, a committee of airline representatives who published a listing of tours refused to list some of the plaintiff tour 
operator's tours in their publication.  The Fifth Circuit applied the rule of reason and determined that the defendant committee's 
refusal to list the tours was reasonable, in part because the refusal was based on legitimate business objectives.  Id. at 187-88."
347,16," The record of this case reveals no hint of any incentive on the part of the race tracks to allocate stalls to the horses of 
particular trainers and not to others. "
355,1," We pretermit, as unnecessary to our decision, whether Thermal, even if not shown to be acting in subjective concert with the 
other defendants, could itself commit an antitrust violation by filing suit to recover under a contract known by it to have been 
confected illegally under the antitrust statutes."
355,2," The alleged tying arrangement in this case is different from the typical tying arrangement, in which a plaintiff agrees to buy both 
the tying product and the tied product from a single defendant.  However, that we have three defendants here, instead of one, is 
irrelevant since the plaintiff has alleged that all three defendants acted in concert.  Cf.  Imperial Point Colonnades Condominium, 
Inc. v. Mangurian, 549 F.2d 1029, 1043 n. 24 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 859, 98 S. Ct. 185, 54 L. Ed. 2d 132 (1977) 
(""defendant cannot escape suit via the statute of limitations by splitting itself into two separate legal entities and causing one of 
them to force plaintiff to buy the tied product from the other one""); Kaiser Aluminum, 677 F.2d at 1052 n. 14 (same). "
361,1," Hoffman presented some evidence that Integrated might have had as much as four months to prepare its bid. In our discussion 
below, we assumed that this longer number is correct. "
362,2," Integrated is correct that no direct evidence supports the conspiracy claim. However, it ignores the fact that bits of 
circumstantial evidence support a finding of collusion, and that circumstantial evidence can suffice to render summary judgment 
improper. See, e.g., Independence Tube Corp., 691 F.2d at 320. The following evidence in the record tends to support an 
inference of collusion between the Village and Integrated: (1) the Village awarded Integrated the specifications contract, without 
competitive bidding, even though Integrated employed no registered architects; (2) some evidence suggests that Village officials 
knew that Integrated would later bid on the construction project, and that this was highly unusual; (3) the Village failed to 
disclose Integrated's role as bidder in its initial solicitations in the Dodge Construction News. These facts imply that the Village 
and Integrated might have agreed to weight the bidding process in Integrated's favor. We are not suggesting that collusion 
actually took place. Rather, we are saying that circumstantial evidence in the record supports a finding of collusion, thus making 
summary judgment inappropriate on the conspiracy element of the Sherman Act claim."
362,3," Security Fire Door, held that plaintiff had failed to state a Sherman Act claim where it had alleged that architects and county 
representatives had drawn up specifications to exclude all dumbwaiters manufactured by firms other than one of the defendants. 
The Court observed: There is nothing alleged in the complaint to suggest that this choice was made other than in an atmosphere of free 
competition among suppliers. So far as the complaint alleges, each supplier was perfectly free to tout the virtues of his 
particular dumbwaiter system in an effort to secure favorable specifications. It would appear that the architects simply 
favored the Guilbert system. In doing so they and their principals can hardly be charged with an antitrust conspiracy."
362,484," F.2d at 1301. In our previous opinion we noted that Integrated, the successful bidder, had specified use of its own product 
and that it was unclear whether competitors could tout the virtues of their own products. Security Fire Door was thus "
363,," distinguishable. However, in light of the undisputed facts that Kirby and Mitchell systems are essentially equivalent, and that 
Hoffman was free to tout the virtues of the Mitchell system, this case no longer differs significantly from Security Fire Door. "
364,4," In light of this holding, we need not consider Integrated's alternative summary judgment motion on the issue of damages. "
369,1," For the purposes of addressing Allstate's argument, we assume, without deciding, that the activities about which the C.I.D. 
inquires are within the definition of ""business of insurance."" See footnote 2 of this opinion. "
370,2," We note that the Supreme Court has identified HN9[
] three criteria relevant in determining whether a particular practice is 
part of the ""business of insurance"": (1) whether the practice has the effect of transferring or spreading a policyholder's risk; (2) 
whether the practice is an integral part of the policy relationship between insurer and insured; and (3) whether the practice is 
limited to entities within the insurance industry. Union Labor Life Insurance Co. v. Pireno, 458 U.S. 119, 102 S. Ct. 3002, 73 
L.ED.2d 647 (1982). Although we need not reach the issue in our disposition of the instant case, it is our view that a boycott of 
providers of health care services is unlikely to be part of the ""business of insurance."" "
371,3," Section 15.10(d) (1) provides: ""A HN14[
] demand may require the production of documentary material, the submission of 
answers to written interrogatories, or the giving of oral testimony only if the material or information sought would be discoverable 
under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure or other state law relating to discovery."" "
377,*," The Honorable George C. Edwards, Senior Circuit Judge, United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, sitting by 
designation. "
380,6," When asked during trial how long the ""right of first negotiation"" for a film would last, Michael Kominsky of Marcus could state 
only that it lasted a ""reasonable amount of time."" (Tr. 2961-62). The response tends to show how little substance there is behind 
the defendants' phraseology. "
381,1," The Supreme Court decisions in Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 441 U.S. 1, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1, 99 
S. Ct. 1551 (1979) and NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma, et al., 468 U.S. 85, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 82 L. Ed. 
2d 70 (1984) do not militate against a conclusion that the split agreement constitutes a per se violation of Section 1. In Broadcast 
Music, the Court examined a horizontal agreement under the Rule of Reason and found it to be legal under Section 1. The Court 
specifically noted that the blanket licenses at issue were ""to some extent a different product"" and that there was no evidence that 
the creation of the new product was prompted by the purpose of restricting competition.  Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia 
Broadcasting System, Inc., 441 U.S. at 13, 22. In NCAA, the Court also applied the Rule of Reason to a horizontal agreement. 
The Court noted, however, the unique circumstances which called for the application of the Rule of Reason rather than the per 
se rule. ""What is critical is that this case involves an industry [college football] in which horizontal restraints on competition are 
essential if the product is to be available at all."" NCAA v. Board of Regents, 104 S. Ct. at 2961. Neither of the characteristics 
unique to blanket licenses or to college football are present in split agreements. Split agreements do not create a new product 
and horizontal agreements are not essential to the existence of the movie industry. "
382,2," F.R.C.P. Rule 65(d) reads as follows: Form and Scope of Injunction of Restraining Order. Every order granting an injunction and every restraining order shall set 
forth the reason for its issuance; shall be specific in terms; shall describe in reasonable detail, and not by reference to the 
complaint or other document, the act or acts sought to be restrained; and is binding only upon the parties to the action, their 
officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, and upon those persons in active concert or participation with them 
who receive actual notice of the order by personal service or otherwise. "
389,1, PCI also claimed two state law violations. These were dismissed without prejudice for refiling in state court. 
390,2," Briefs Amici Curiae on the First Amendment issue were filed by American Television & Communications Corp. and Home Box 
Office, Inc., jointly, on behalf of PCI and by the cities of Palo Alto and Menlo Park and the Town of Atherton, jointly, on behalf of 
the City."
390,3," On October 11, 1984, Congress enacted the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-549, 98 Stat. 2779, 
98th Cong., 2d Sess. (1984). The Cable Policy Act amends the Communications Act of 1934 to establish a comprehensive 
national cable television policy. The Act envisions a franchising model similar to the City's procedure. It prohibits cable operators from providing cable service 
without a franchise. Id. ยง 621(b)(1). Section 621(a)(1) of the Act empowers a franchising authority ""to award 1 or more franchises 
within its jurisdiction."" The term ""franchising authority"" is defined broadly to include ""any governmental entity empowered by 
Federal, State or local law to grant a franchise."" Id. ยง 602(9). A franchise authorizes the construction of a cable system over 
public rights of way and over easements dedicated for compatible uses; the cable operator is responsible for paying the cost of 
installation and operation, ensuring the continued safety, functioning, and appearance of the property affected, and providing just 
compensation to the owners of property damaged in the course of installation and operation. Id. ยง 621(a)(2). "
391,," The Cable Policy Act also provides for mandatory access and leased access channels. Section 611 authorizes the franchising 
authority to require as a condition of the franchise the dedication of channel capacity for public, educational, or government use. 
Similarly, ยง 612 requires the operator to designate a percentage of its channel capacity for commercial use by persons 
unaffiliated with the operator. The Act prohibits the operator from exercising any editorial control over programming by public, 
educational, government, or unaffiliated commercial users. See id. ยงยง 611(e), 612(c)(2). "
392,4," We note, however, that the mandatory access and leased access requirements contained in the City's franchising scheme and 
called for by ยงยง 611-612 of the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-549, 98 Stat. 2779, 98th Cong., 2d 
Sess. (1984), pose particularly troubling constitutional questions. Imposing access requirements on the press would no doubt be 
invalid. See Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241, 41 L. Ed. 2d 730, 94 S. Ct. 2831 (1974). Courts have divided 
as to the effect of the Tornillo holding on the validity of access requirements imposed on cable television operators. Compare 
Midwest Video Corp. v. FCC, 571 F.2d 1025, 1055-56 (8th Cir. 1978) (suggesting that to the extent the government's interest in 
imposing such requirements stems from the economic scarcity of the cable medium, the Supreme Court's decision in Tornillo 
casts considerable doubt on the government's ability to do so), aff'd on other grounds, 440 U.S. 689, 99 S. Ct. 1435, 59 L. Ed. 
2d 692 (1979) with Home Box Office, Inc. v. FCC, 185 U.S. App. D.C. 142, 567 F.2d 9, 46 n. 82 (D.C. Cir.) (suggesting that, 
unlike the right of reply statute involved in Tornillo, which was triggered by the publication of certain items, rules requiring cable 
operators to dedicate channels to common carrier use would not diminish the overall diversity of cable programming or deter the 
presentation of controversial material regarding public figures), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 829, 54 L. Ed. 2d 89, 98 S. Ct. 111 (1977) 
and Berkshire Cablevision of Rhode Island v. Burke, 571 F. Supp. 976, 983-88 (D.R.I. 1983) (upholding franchising procedure 
that required applicants to provide access channels for governmental, educational, and public use). We decline to reach this 
question. "
393,5," In Valley Forge, the Supreme Court also articulated a set of prudential limitations on standing. See also McMichael v. County of 
Napa, 709 F.2d 1268, 1270 (9th Cir. 1983). Thus, the plaintiff must assert his own legal rights and interests; his claim cannot 
rest on the rights or interests of a third party.  454 U.S. at 474. Further, courts should refrain from adjudicating ""abstract 
questions of wide public significance"" amounting to ""'generalized grievances,' pervasively shared and most appropriately 
addressed in the representative branches."" Id. at 475 (quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499-500, 45 L. Ed. 2d 343, 95 S. 
Ct. 2197 (1975)). Finally, the plaintiff's interest must fall within ""the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or 
constitutional guarantee in question."" Id. (quoting Association of Data Processing Serv. Orgs. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 153, 90 S. 
Ct. 827, 25 L. Ed. 2d 184 (1970)). None of these principles operate to deny standing to PCI. See Century Federal, Inc. v. City of 
Palo Alto, 579 F. Supp. 1553, 1562 (N.D. Cal. 1984)."
393,6," HN5[
] For example, direct restrictions on the content of cable broadcasts would generally be invalid. See, e.g., Cruz v. Ferre,"
393,571," F. Supp. 125 (S.D. Fla. 1983) (invalidates ordinance imposing sanctions on cable licensee's transmission of ""indecent"" 
programs); Community Television of Utah, Inc. v. Roy City, 555 F. Supp. 1164 (D. Utah 1982) (same); Home Box Office, Inc. v. 
Wilkinson, 531 F. Supp. 987 (D. Utah 1982) (same). "
394,7," In Midwest Video Corp. v. FCC, the Eighth Circuit limited Black Hills Video to its facts, further undercutting its precedential 
value. See 571 F.2d at 1054 n.71 (reading Black Hills Video as upholding FCC efforts to regulate cable operators' use of 
microwaves); see also Century Federal, Inc., 579 F. Supp. at 1563 n.19 (doubting continuing vitality of Black Hills Video). "
395,8," The Tenth Circuit also suggested that newspapers had enjoyed a long tradition of freedom from government interference, while 
cable television had not.  Community Communications Co., 660 F.2d at 1379; accord Berkshire Cablevision of Rhode Island, 
571 F. Supp. at 985. This distinction merely begs the question. The district court in Berkshire Cablevision offered a more helpful distinction. It asserted that, while a newspaper's natural 
monopoly did not preclude the public's use of the print medium, cable's natural monopoly did prevent public use of the television 
medium. See 571 F. Supp. at 986. As a factual matter, however, it is not clear that this is true. Cf.  Loveday v. FCC, 228 U.S. 
App. D.C. 38, 707 F.2d 1443, 1459 (D.C. Cir.) (noting the proliferation of broadcast stations since the National Broadcasting 
case and the fact that now there are many more stations than newspapers, and concluding that ""it seems unlikely that the First 
Amendment protections of broadcast political speech will contract further, and they may well expand.""), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 
1008, 104 S. Ct. 525, 78 L. Ed. 2d 709 (1983). And in reviewing a dismissal, we must resolve all doubts in favor of the plaintiff. "
396,9," In their amicus brief, the Cities of Palo Alto, Menlo Park, and Atherton suggest several other government ""interests"" served by 
a restrictive franchising regime. Amici assert that the City has interests in preventing ""cream skimming"" -- wiring only affluent, 
and therefore more profitable, portions of the franchise area; ensuring the provision of community access and leased access to 
cable facilities, and encouraging the development of state-of-the-art cable systems. Amici contend that these interests serve to 
justify the City's approach to cable franchising. On the present state of the record, we cannot agree. Here, the City bears the burden of proving that the elements of the O'Brien 
test are satisfied.  Playtime Theaters, Inc. v. City of Renton, 748 F.2d 527, 535 (9th Cir. 1984); see First Nat'l Bank of Boston v. 
Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 786, 55 L. Ed. 2d 707, 98 S. Ct. 1407 (1978); Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 362, 49 L. Ed. 2d 547, 96 S. 
Ct. 2673 (1976) (Opinion of Brennan, J.). Nothing in the record suggests that the City has a substantial interest in any of the 
concerns raised by amici. As we indicated in Playtime Theaters, the City must justify its regulations in terms of its own problems. 
It may not rely on the problems faced by other communities or on justifications that are merely conclusory and speculative. See 
748 F.2d at 536-37. Furthermore, there must be a showing that these interest are ""unrelated to the suppression of free 
expression."" See O'Brien, 391 U.S. at 377. There is nothing in the record on this issue. We are not convinced that restricting the 
number of cable operators in the manner set forth in PCI's complaint furthers these interests in a manner consistent with the 
First Amendment. As we noted earlier, we express no opinion as to whether the City may impose its access and coverage 
requirements by other means. Those issues are not before us. HN10[
] - "
399,10," In addition to originating their own programming, cable television operators exercise considerable editorial discretion regarding 
what their programming will include. See HN19[
] FCC v. Midwest Video Corp., 440 U.S. 689, 707 & n.17, 59 L. Ed. 2d 692, 99 S. Ct. 1435 (1979). Editorial judgment is entitled to First Amendment protection. See, e.g., Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. 
Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241, 257-58, 41 L. Ed. 2d 730, 94 S. Ct. 2831 (1974). Undeniably, cable operators do transmit programs 
produced by others. To the extent an operator does so, however, we believe it would be treated for First Amendment purposes 
as would be theater owners, booksellers, and concert promoters. Their First Amendment protection is not diminished because 
they distribute or present works created by others. See, e.g., Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. City of Dallas, 390 U.S. 676, 20 L. Ed. 2d 
225, 88 S. Ct. 1298 (1968) (movie theaters); Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, 372 U.S. 58, 9 L. Ed. 2d 584, 83 S. Ct. 631 (1963) 
(booksellers); Cinevision Corp. v. Burbank, 745 F.2d 560, 567-68 (concert promoters). And PCI does not lose its First 
Amendment rights merely because its judgment is tempered by commercial considerations. See Gannett Satellite Information 
Network v. Metropolitan Transp. Auth., 745 F.2d 767, 772 (2d Cir. 1984) (sale of newspapers is protected by the First 
Amendment); Cinevision Corp., 745 F.2d at 567 (promoting concerts for profit enjoys First Amendment protection); see also 
Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego, 453 U.S. 490, 504 n.11, 69 L. Ed. 2d 800, 101 S. Ct. 2882 (1981) (noting lower court's 
confusion of ""the category of 'commercial speech' with the category of individuals who have a 'commercial interest' in protected 
speech.""); First Nat'l Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 786 n.23, 55 L. Ed. 2d 707, 98 S. Ct. 1407 (1978) (""It is too late to 
suggest 'that the dependence of a communication on the expenditure of money itself operates to introduce a nonspeech element 
or to reduce the exacting scrutiny required by the First Amendment."") (quoting Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 16, 46 L. Ed. 2d 
659, 96 S. Ct. 612 (1976)). "
400,11," As already mentioned, see supra p. 1400 n.3, ยง 621(a)(1) of the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-
549, 98 Stat. 2779, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. (1984), empowers a local authority to ""award . . . 1 or more franchises within its 
jurisdiction."" To the extent that this provision authorizes the government to protect its interest in regulating disruption of public 
resources through a system of permits or franchises, see, id. ยง 621(a)(2)(noting government's interest in promoting safety and in 
ensuring that the costs of installation and operation are borne by the cable operator); see also id. ยง 602(8) (defining ""franchise"" 
as an initial authorization (or a renewal thereof), whether designated as a franchise, license, permit, or otherwise), it passes 
muster under the principles announced here. But we cannot agree with the suggestion in the legislative history that the provision 
""grants to the franchising authority the discretion to determine the number of cable operators to be authorized to provide service 
in a particular geographic area."" H. R. Rep. No. 934, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 59 (1984). A construction of such breadth would be 
invalid. Nothing in this opinion is inconsistent with a city-operated franchise system that respects First Amendment rights. 
Congress must be presumed to have envisioned such a system. "
401,12," The Boulder case concerned itself only with the availability of injunctive relief.  Century Federal, Inc. v. City of Palo Alto, 579 F. 
Supp. 1553, 1555 n.6 (N.D.Cal. 1984). Whether a majority of the Court would similarly curtail a municipality's state action 
immunity in a suit seeking treble damages remains unsettled. See Lafayette, 435 U.S. at 442-43 (Blackmun, J., dissenting); see 
also Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., 428 U.S. 579, 614 n.6, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1141, 96 S. Ct. 3110 (1976) (Blackmun, J., concurring in 
judgment) (discussing availability of a defense based on the unfairness of holding a private party liable where the state's 
participation dominates a decision to adopt a restraint challenged under the antitrust laws and asserting that unfairness"" would 
be a defense only to the recovery of damages, not to a suit seeking injunctive relief). See generally P. Areeda, Antitrust Law 
para. 212.2b, at 48-49 (Supp. 1982) (arguing that damages should not be available in antitrust suits brought against 
municipalities and suggesting that antitrust scrutiny of municipal actions may be more readily justified if damages are 
unavailable). Because we conclude that the statutory authorization for the City's franchising scheme satisfies the Boulder test, 
we do not reach this issue."

404,14," We note the Supreme Court's opinion in Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, 433 U.S. 350, 53 L. Ed. 2d 810, 97 S. Ct. 2691 (1977), 
a case that involved a challenge to a state bar disciplinary rule banning lawyer advertising that had been incorporated as one of 
the rules of the Arizona Supreme Court. See id. at 355. The Court found that, to the extent it prohibited attorneys from 
advertising the availability and the terms of their legal services, the rule violated the First Amendment. See id. at 363-84. This 
conclusion, however, did not prevent the Court from finding that, as the ban was an affirmative command of the state supreme 
court, the state action exemption barred the plaintiffs' antitrust claim. See id. at 359-63. Although the Court did not discuss the 
interplay between the plaintiffs' constitutional claim and their antitrust claim, we see no reason not to reach the same result here. "
412,1," In this opinion we use the term ""claim preclusion"" to refer to ""res judicata"" in a narrow sense, i. e., the preclusive effect of a 
judgment in foreclosing litigation of matters that should have been raised in an earlier suit.  In contrast, we use the term ""issue 
preclusion"" to refer to the effect of a judgment in foreclosing relitigation of a matter that has been litigated and decided.  See 
Migra v. Warren City School Dist. Bd. of Ed., 465 U.S. 75, 77, n. 1 (1984). "
414,2," Our analysis does not necessarily suggest that the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit erred in its holding in Nash County 
Board of Education v. Biltmore Co., 640 F.2d 484, cert. denied, 454 U.S. 878 (1981). The Court of Appeals there applied federal "
415,," preclusion principles to conclude that a state judgment approving settlement of state antitrust claims barred a subsequent 
federal antitrust claim. Although our decision today indicates that the Court of Appeals should have looked in the first instance to 
state law to determine the preclusive effect of the state judgment, the same holding would result if application of state preclusion 
law suggests that the settlement bars the subsequent federal claim and if there is no exception to ยง 1738 in these 
circumstances.  Cf.  640 F.2d, at 487, n. 5 (noting that state law gives preclusive effect to consent judgment).  We, of course, do 
not address those issues here."
415,3," THE CHIEF JUSTICE notes that preclusion rules bar the splitting of a cause of action between a court of limited jurisdiction and 
one of general jurisdiction, and suggests that state requirements of jurisdictional competency may leave unclear whether a state 
court action precludes a subsequent federal antitrust claim. Post, at 388-390.  The rule that the judgment of a court of limited 
jurisdiction concludes the entire claim assumes that the plaintiff might have commenced his action in a court in the same system 
of courts that was competent to give full relief.  See Restatement (Second) of Judgments ยง 24, Comment g (1982).  Moreover, 
the jurisdictional competency requirement generally is understood to imply that state court litigation based on a state statute 
analogous to a federal statute, e. g., a state antitrust law, does not bar subsequent attempts to secure relief in federal court if 
the state court lacked jurisdiction over the federal statutory claim.  Id., ยง 26(1)(c), Illustration 2.  Although a particular State's 
preclusion principles conceivably could support a rule similar to that proposed by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, post, at 390-391, where 
state preclusion rules do not indicate that a claim is barred, we do not believe that federal courts should fashion a federal rule to 
preclude a claim that could not have been raised in the state proceedings. "
417,1," E. g., by inquiring whether the plaintiff could have raised the question whether the defendant violated a particular statute."
417,2," E. g., by inquiring whether the plaintiff could have raised the question whether the defendant engaged in a group boycott. "
418,3," Compare Restatement (Second) of Judgments ยง 24, Comment g, Illustration 14, pp. 204-205 (1982): ""In an automobile collision, A is injured and his car damaged as a result of the negligence of B.  Instead of suing in a court of 
general jurisdiction of the state, A brings his action for the damage to his car in a justice's court, which has jurisdiction in actions 
for damage to property but has no jurisdiction in actions for injury to the person.  Judgment is rendered for A for the damage to 
the car.  A cannot thereafter maintain an action against B to recover for the injury to his person arising out of the same collision."" See also 18 C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure ยง 4412, p. 95 (1981), stating that the ""general 
rule"" in state courts is that ""[a] second action will not be permitted on parts of a single claim that could have been asserted in a 
court of broader jurisdiction simply because the plaintiff went first to a court of limited jurisdiction in the same state that could not 
hear them."" The holding in Lucas v. Le Compte, 42 Ill. 303 (1866), is similar to this ""general rule,"" but that holding was based on 
a construction of an Illinois statute, Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 59, ยง 35 (1845), which (a) has been repealed, see Act of Apr. 15, 1965, 
1965 Ill. Laws 331, and (b) had a broader preclusive effect than general Illinois res judicata doctrine has.  Clancey v. McBride, 
338 Ill. 35, 169 N. E. 729 (1929), involved the same circumstances as the above-quoted illustration from the Restatement.  The 
court resolved the case, however, without reference to the limited jurisdiction of the justice's court, by concluding that injury to 
the person and injury to property are distinct legal wrongs that can be the subject of separate lawsuits."
418,4," By contrast, when a federal court construes substantive rights and obligations under state law in the context of a diversity 
action, the federal interest is insignificant and the state's interest is much more direct than it is in the present situation, even if the 
relevant state law is ambiguous. "
425,1," In January 1985, more than a year after this suit was filed, the Plaintiff amended its complaint. It is unclear whether the Plaintiff, 
by way of the amended complaint, voluntarily dismissed Patrick Koloski as a Defendant from this case. However, in order to fully 
dispose of the motion, the Court will treat Mr. Koloski as if he were a Defendant here."
425,2," JDC also claims that the Defendants violated the Louisiana antitrust laws, La.Rev.Stat.Ann. 51:122 & 51:123 (West 1965), and 
the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. section 1983. These claims are not affected by this opinion."
425,3," Neither American Waste nor its parent corporation, Waste Management, Inc., were named as defendants in this action. 
Furthermore, JDC has not sought damages or any other relief from American Waste in any other proceeding. It is interesting to 
note, however, that American Waste was identified as a coconspirator with Jefferson Parish and Koloski in the Plaintiff's 
unamended complaint. In its amended complaint, JDC dropped the charge of coconspirator but maintained that the Defendants 
engaged in concerted action with American Waste to restrain competition. "
426,4," In December 1981, five firms submitted bids for the contract for the collection and disposal of solid waste for Garbage Districts 
Two and Six on the West Bank of Jefferson Parish. JDC submitted the third lowest bid. American Waste was the lowest bidder. 
The Parish Council approved the contract award by resolution in January 1982. American Waste began to perform the contract 
in June 1982. JDC also contends that the contract between the Parish and American Waste is a long-term exclusive dealing 
agreement which unreasonably forecloses competition in the market. The contract has an initial five year term with a provision 
for extensions of up to five more years. "
427,5," The Honorable J. Paul McGrath, Assistant Attorney General of the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of 
Justice, Professors Phillip Areeda and Milton Handler testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee. "

in merely defending antitrust suits regardless of the outcome."" Report of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on the Local 
Government Antitrust Act, S.Rep.  No. 593, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 7 (1984)."

(daily ed. Aug. 6, 1984). Impetus for the passage of the Local Government Antitrust Act was initiated by Unity Ventures v. 
County of Lake and Village of Grayslake, No. 81 C 2745 (N.D.Ill. Jan. 12, 1984). In Unity Ventures, a jury awarded the plaintiff 
$9.5 million in damages in an antitrust action against the local governments and their officials. The court trebled the award to 
$28.5 million. See id. at H8473 (statement of Congressman Hyde). Congressman Crane, who represents the district in which 
Unity Ventures is pending on appeal, stated during the House debates that this judgment, if upheld on appeal, could very well 
bankrupt Lake County. See id. at H8472-73."
428,8," See, e.g., id. at H8474 Congressman Hyde stated that ""this legislation is an explicit statement that the antitrust laws were not 
intended to oversee or interfere with the decision making process at the local government level."""
428,9," See also H.R.6027, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 130 Cong.Rec. H11696 (daily ed. Oct. 9, 1984). Congressman Rodino explained that 
the Act does not immunize local governments from the antitrust laws, but precludes the use of damage suits, which many 
members of Congress believe to be an inappropriate remedy; id. at S14364 (daily ed. Oct. 11, 1984) Senator Thurmond 
remarked that the Act strikes an appropriate balance for ""while taxpayers will not have to pay treble damage awards, injunctive 
relief will still be available to halt and prevent antitrust violations"" of local governments."
428,10," See H.R.6027, 98th Cong., 2d Sess., 130 Cong. Rec. H8622-23 (daily ed. Aug. 8, 1984) (statement of Rep. Brooks)."

Sawyer); id. at H11697 (statement of Rep. Crane); id. at H12176 (daily ed. Oct. 11, 1984) Rep. Porter stated that ""one inequity 
that is terribly compelling . . .  would be that which allows a recovery of money damages against just one, or a small group of 
defendant municipalities, while all others, before [Boulder and Lafayette] and after [the Local Government Antitrust Act], 
engaging in the same type of conduct have no such penalty."""
428,12," See, e.g., id. at S13574 (daily ed. Oct. 4, 1984) (colloquy between Senator Eagleton and Rudman); id. at H12187 (daily ed. 
Oct. 11, 1984) (colloquy between Rep. Seiberling and Rep. Rodino). "

429,15," Id. at S13574-75 (daily ed. Oct. 4, 1984). "
430,16," The Act is silent about the date from which courts should determine the stage of litigation. Defendants waited approximately 
six weeks from the enactment of the Act to bring to the Court's attention their intention to move to dismiss the Plaintiff's claim for 
monetary damages under the Clayton Act on the ground that the Local Government Act prohibited this claim. See District Court's 
Minute Entry of Dec. 5, 1984 (document No. 57 in District Court Record). The Plaintiff, however, was or should have been on 
notice of the potential consequences of the Act on this case by the time of the Act's date of enactment, October 24, 1984. 
Indeed, as early as November 27, 1984, JDC admitted that the Act ""place[d] a cloud over the certainty of JDC's recovering 
damages under the Clayton Act in the event JDC prevails in its substantive antitrust claims."" Plaintiff's Memorandum in 
Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Leave to File Supplemental and Amended Answer p. 3 (document No. 54 in District Court 
Record). Thus, this Court does not believe that it is unfair to use October 24, 1984 as the date from which to determine the stage 
of litigation. Furthermore, the Plaintiff is not prejudiced by the use of this date because the case has progressed very little since 
then."
430,17," A colloquy between Congressmen Seiberling and Rodino, who were members of the Conference Committee that submitted 
the final version of the Act to Congress, indicates that Congress believed that a case in which pre-trial discovery is not yet 
complete should be considered to be in an early stage of litigation. See H.R. 6027, 98th Cong., 2d Sess., 130 Cong.Rec. 
H12187 (daily ed. Oct. 11, 1984)."
430,18," JDC complains that it was forced to take these depositions in November and December 1984 to comply with the Court's 
preliminary pre-trial order requiring factual discovery to be completed by December 10, 1984.  The Plaintiff is correct that the 
Court's minute entry of July 10, 1984 set a discovery deadline of December 10, 1984. (document No. 14 in District Court 
Record). The Court, however, when it learned of Defendants' intention to file this motion, extended the deadline to March 1, 
1985. See District Court's Minute Entry of Dec. 5, 1984 (document No. 57 in District Court Record). This extension was granted 
on December 5, 1984 at a status conference at which counsel for JDC was present."
430,19," Section 3(b) of the Act states that the Court should look at the availability of alternative relief under the Clayton Act. The only 
other remedy available is injunctive relief provided by Section 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. section 26. Also, it should be 
noted that although the Act prohibits awarding costs and attorney's fees under Section 4 of the Clayton Act, a plaintiff who 
prevails in obtaining an injunction under Section 16 is still entitled to an award of costs and attorney's fees."
430,20," In its unamended complaint, which was initially filed in this case, JDC requested injunctive relief. See Plaintiff's Complaint 
(document No. 1 in District Court Record). For some reason not known to this Court, JDC, in its amended complaint, dropped 
this request. See Plaintiff's Amended Complaint (document No. 82 in District Court record). Regardless of whether or not the 
Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief, this Court is not precluded from determining if such an alternative remedy is available under the 
Clayton Act. "
431,21," See also United States v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 391 U.S. 244, 250, 88 S. Ct. 1496, 1500, 20 L. Ed. 2d 562 (1968) 
(explaining that a court may enter a decree to restore workable competition to the market place and ensure that there are no 
practices likely to result in future antitrust violations); International Telephone and Telegraph Corp. v. General Telephone & 
Electronics Corp., 518 F.2d 913, 925 (9th Cir.1975) stating that HN5[
] ""injunctive remedies under section 16 [of the Clayton 
Act] may be as broad as necessary to ensure that 'threatened loss or damage' does not materialize or that prior violations do not 
recur."""
431,22," In August 1982, Louisiana enacted a statute, HN6[
] La.Rev.Stat.Ann. 33:4169.1 (West Supp.1985), which provides in relevant part: A. The governing authority of every parish or municipality shall have the following powers: (1) To engage in the collection and disposal of garbage and trash within its jurisdiction in cooperation with, or to the 
exclusion of, other garbage and trash collectors. (2) To grant permits, licenses, exclusive or non-exclusive franchises, or any combination thereof to garbage and trash 
collectors and disposers. Any exclusive franchise shall be granted only after advertising for bids, reception of bids, and 
awarding of the contract or contracts in accordance with the public bid laws of the state and other provisions of law. (3) To enter into time contracts for the collection and transportation of garbage or trash for a term of up to ten years, and for 
disposal of garbage or trash for a term of up to twenty-five years. D. The governing authority of any municipality or parish is authorized to carry out the provisions of this Section as acts of 
government on behalf of the state of Louisiana as sovereign, and, to the extent the governing authorities deem necessary 
or appropriate, are further authorized to displace competition and provide a monopoly public service. "
432,23," In Corey, the plaintiff sued the town and the Steam Boat Authority, alleging that they conspired to deprive the plaintiff, who 
was in the business of operating parking lots, of an award to run a particular lot.  The contract was awarded to the Authority, 
plaintiff's competitor. State statutes authorized the Authority to operate parking lots and the town to regulate parking, but neither 
statute authorized the displacement of competition. The court stated that Even had the authority been granted the statutory power to monopolize the parking market, this would not necessary 
exempt all means to achieve this end. For instance, simply because one can enforce zoning laws does not necessarily 
mean that one can burn down a neighbor's offending building. Thus the Authority cannot establish that there is a ""clearly 
articulated and affirmatively expressed"" sovereign state policy favoring the Authority's boycott of competitors in the parking 
market."

432,24, La.Rev.Stat.Ann. 33:4169.1(A)(2) (West Supp. 1985) (emphasis added).
432,25," This Court has already determined that criteria of Section 3(b) of the Local Government Antitrust Act direct that the Act be 
applied to this pending case. The statutory directive is not to the contrary. See text accompanying notes 16-24. "
433,26," The Court cited Greene v. United States, 376 U.S. 149, 160, 84 S. Ct. 615, 621, 11 L. Ed. 2d 576 (1964); Claridge Apartments

Laramie Stock Yards Co., 231 U.S. 190, 199, 34 S. Ct. 101, 102, 58 L. Ed. 179 (1913). Both Greene and Claridge stand for the 
proposition that antecedent rights to a damage award cannot be subsequently revoked unless there is clear legislative intent to 
the contrary."

436 (1949); Seese v. Bethlehem Steel Co., 168 F.2d 58, 62-64 (4th Cir.1948)."
434,31," This Court recognizes that there is case law supporting JDC's contention that one has a vested property right in a cause of 
action once it has somehow accrued. See Hartford Fire Insurance Co. v. Lawrence, Dykes, Goodenberger, Bower & Clancy, 740 
F.2d 1362, 1367 (6th Cir.1984); Ducre v. Mine Safety Appliances, 573 F. Supp. 388, 392 (E.D.La.1983), rev'd in part on other 
grounds Ducre v. Executive Officers of Halter Marine, Inc., 752 F.2d 976 (5th Cir.1985) (the constitutional issue was not 
discussed); Edwardsen v. Morton, 369 F. Supp. 1359 (D.D.C. 1973); Jacklitch v. Redstone Federal Credit Union, 463 F. Supp. 
1134, 1139 n. 2 (N.D.Ala.1979). Those cases are conceptually difficult to reconcile with cases that hold that a plaintiff does not 
have a vested property right in a claim unless there is a final nonreviewable judgment. This Court disagrees with the former 
group of cases. They deal too loosely with the notion of what is property or a right. Additionally, the Court does not agree with 
the Plaintiff that Ducharme v. Merrill-National Laboratories, 574 F.2d 1307 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 1002, 99 S. Ct. 612, 
58 L. Ed. 2d 677 (1978), stands for the proposition that an existing cause of action is a vested property right protected by the 
Constitution. The holding in Ducharme was that ""a plaintiff has no vested right in any tort claim for damages under state law."" 
574 F.2d at 1309. In dicta, the court noted that the plaintiffs' action against the manufacturer under Louisiana law, which was 
abrogated by the Federal Swine Flu Act, did not even accrue until the passage of the Act. Thus, according to the court, the 
""plaintiff had no prior vested right in a cause of action"" under Louisiana law.  Id. at 1310. The court, however, ended its 
discussion there without discussing whether a so-called vested right in a cause of action would mandate constitutional protection 
under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. Furthermore, retroactive application of Section 3(a) of the Act to the pending case does not impair a previously vested 
contractual right. A possible violation of the Contract Clause of the Federal Constitution is not at issue here. Therefore, Lynch v. 
United States, 292 U.S. 571, 54 S. Ct. 840, 78 L. Ed. 1434 (1934); Coombes v. Getz, 285 U.S. 434, 52 S. Ct. 435, 76 L. Ed. 866 
(1932); and Richmond Screw Anchor Co. v. U.S., 275 U.S. 331, 48 S. Ct. 194, 72 L. Ed. 303 (1928), are not relevant here. "

435,34," The only mention of the Tucker Act in the legislative history is in a memorandum read into the record by Senator Symms. See 
H.R. 6027, 98th Cong., 2d Sess., 130 Cong.Rec. S14366 (daily ed. Oct. 11, 1984). This memorandum merely discusses the 
possibility of a Tucker Act remedy if retroactive application of the Act was held to be a taking of property without just 
compensation. It does not state whether or not Congress intended to withdraw the remedy. "
440,1," Throughout this Opinion, the Court will refer to the Amended Complaint as ""the Complaint."" The remaining Defendants after 
Thercol and Peabody's dismissal, SFI and all its subsidiaries and divisions, will be referred to collectively as ""the Santa Fe 
Defendants."""
440,2," This statute states: A. Every contract, agreement, combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce, any part of which trade or 
commerce is within this state, is hereby declared to be unlawful. B. Every contract, agreement, combination or conspiracy which controls the quantity, price or exchange of any article of 
manufacture, product of the soil or mine or any goods or services in restraint of trade is hereby declared to be unlawful. N.M.Stat.Ann. ยง 57-1-1 (1978). N.M.Stat.Ann. ยง 57-1-3 (1978) provides for civil liability for restraint of trade. Counts I and IV will 
be referred to hereinafter as ""Section I claims."" "
441,3," In addition to Count I, Counts II and III are monopolization claims brought under 15 U.S.C. ยง 2. "
451,1," Although immunity cannot be established on this record, it is possible that early resolution may be accomplished on the merits.  
The issues in this case are factually and legally straightforward and susceptible to minimum and efficient discovery.  My standing 
scheduling order calls for discovery to be completed within six months of the date of the order, with no enlargement to be 
granted.  This should provide for an early resolution, by summary judgment, or by a trial on the merits. "
455,2," One indication of this congressional intent is found in the House Report on the Act.  The report states: Examples of special purpose political subdivisions included within the definition are planning districts, water districts, sewer 
districts, irrigation districts, drainage districts, road districts, and mosquito control districts.  Such a subdivision would have a 
geographic jurisdiction that is not contiguous with, and generally substantially smaller than, that of the State that established it.  
The definition, however, would encompass special purpose governmental units that operate in more than one State.For 
example, regional planning boards, environmental organizations, or airport or port authorities may be established in two or more 
States. H.R. Rep. No. 965, 98th Cong. 2nd Sess. 19-20 (August 8, 1984 (emphasis added)."
455,3," Ironically, August 8, 1984 was the same day the U.S. House of Representatives passed its version of the Local Government 
Antitrust Act of 1984. "
456,4," The Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee of Conference, H.R. Rep. 1158, 98th Cong., 2nd Sess. (October 10, 1984), 
offers additional guidance on whether a district court should apply the Act to a pending case. The Conference Report states: The application to pending cases of the money damage protection afforded by section 3 will be based upon a case-by-case 
determination by the district court.  The local government has the burden of proof to establish to the court's satisfaction that it 
would be inequitable not to consider all the relevant circumstances.  The statute mentions two of the factors that the court should 
consider -- [the] stage of the litigation and the availability of alternative relief under the Clayton Act. Where a pending case is in 
an early stage of litigation and where injunctive relief can remedy the problem, the defendant local government may be able 
more easily to sustain its burden.  Where a case is in more advanced stages of litigation or where injunctive relief is unavailable 
or incomplete, the burden would become more difficult.  If a case has progressed to or beyond a jury verdict or district court

479,3," The Sixth Circuit consistently has advised district courts that ""cases involving question of motive or intent are normally not

Note to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 reemphasized that summary judgment is ""applicable to all actions,"" the court has affirmed summary 
judgments in a series of antitrust and intent-related cases, maintaining that ""the very purpose of a motion for summary judgment, 
to eliminate a trial where it would be unnecessary and merely result in delay and expense, warrants summary disposition of such 
cases when appropriate.""  Bouldis v. U.S. Suzuki Motor Corp., 711 F.2d at 1324. HN25[

487,1," We are today filing a separate opinion affirming the convictions of Louis Spiegel and Inter County Refuse Service, Inc. (A-191-
83T4)."
487,2," Technically, the trial judge was incorrect when he imposed a custodial term and suspended execution of the sentence.  
N.J.S.A. 56:9-11 provides that a knowing violation of the Antitrust Act constitutes a misdemeanor.  However, N.J.S.A. 2C:1-5b, 
N.J.S.A. 2C:1-4c and N.J.S.A. 2C:43-2a state that all persons convicted of an offense are to be sentenced in accordance with 
the Code of Criminal Justice.  See Stern, ""Preserving Jurisdiction Under the Code,"" 7 Crim.Just.Q. 1 (1979).  Unlike prior law, 
the sentencing court under the Code is permitted to directly impose a probationary term.  N.J.S.A. 2C:43-2b(2).  It is no longer 
proper for the court to impose a custodial term and suspend execution of all or a portion of it. "
490,3," N.J.S.A. 56:9-18 provides that the New Jersey Antitrust Act is to be construed in harmony with judicial interpretations of 
comparable federal provisions.  See  State v. New Jersey Trade Waste Ass'n, 96 N.J. 8 (1984);  Pomanowski v. Monmouth 
County Bd. of Realtors, 89 N.J. 306, 313 (1982), cert. den.   459 U.S. 908, 103 S.Ct. 213, 74 L.Ed.2d 170 (1982). "
491,4," That is not to say, however, that if such a regulatory conflict existed, the exemption would not be applicable.  For example, solid 
waste collectors file tariffs of rates with the Board.  These rates are then available for examination by the company's competitors.  
Such an exchange of current price information could be considered a violation of the antitrust law.  United States v. United 
States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422, 98 S.Ct. 2864, 57 L.Ed.2d 854 (1978). Clearly, however, since such an exchange of 
information is permitted by the BPU, the antitrust law is inapplicable.  Another example would be if the Board granted a 
particular collector a franchise territory pursuant to N.J.S.A. 48:13A-5.  In that situation a collector would have a governmentally 
sanctioned monopoly which would be exempted from the antitrust law. Again, however, no such regulatory conflict exists in the 
present case.   In re Application of Saddle River, supra."
491,5," We note that even had defendants' motion for a severance been granted, much of the evidence pertaining to the conduct of 
other co-conspirators would have been admissible in any event.  See Evid.R. 63(9).  Under such circumstances, a separate trial 
would not have altered the disparity of the evidence pertaining to defendants and the other co-conspirators.  Cf.   State v. 
Coruzzi, 189 N.J. Super. 273, 299 (App.Div.1983), certif. den.   94 N.J. 531 (1983);  State v. Reldan, 167 N.J. Super. 595, 600-

501,1, The City is located in both Eau Claire and Chippewa Counties.
501,2," The complaint also alleged violations of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U. S. C. ยง 1251 et seq., and of a common-
law duty of a utility to serve.  The District Court dismissed these claims, and they are not at issue in this Court. "
502,3," Midcal was originally brought as a mandamus action seeking an injunction against a state agency, the California Department of 
Alcoholic Beverage Control.  The State played no role, however, in setting prices or reviewing their reasonableness, activities 
carried out by the private wine dealers.  445 U.S., at 100-101. The mere fact that the state agency was a named defendant was 
not sufficient to alter the state action analysis from that appropriate to a case involving the state regulation of private 
anticompetitive acts.  See Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc. v. United States, post, at 56-57. "
503,4, There is no such order of the Department of Natural Resources at issue in this case.
503,5," The Towns also rely on Wis. Stat. Ann. ยงยง 66.076(1) and 66.30 (1965 and Supp. 1984) to argue that the State's policy on the 
provision of sewage services is actually procompetitive.  This claim must fail because, aside from the fact that it was not raised 
below, the provisions relied upon do not support the contention.  First, it is true that ยง 66.076(1) permits certain municipalities, 
including towns, to operate sewage systems.  The provision is simply a general enabling statute, however, not a mandatory 
prescription.  In addition, subsection (8) of ยง 66.076 incorporates into the enabling statute all of the limitations of ยง 66.069, 
including the power to limit the area of service.  Thus, ยง 66.076(1) does not express a procompetitive state attitude. Nor does ยง 66.30 aid the Towns.  It is a general provision concerning all utilities -- not just sewage systems -- that permits 
municipalities to enter into cooperative agreements.  The statute is not mandatory, but merely permissive.  Moreover, even 
assuming two municipalities agreed pursuant to this section to cooperate in providing sewage services, the result would not 
necessarily be greater competition.  Rather, the two combined might well be more effective than either alone in keeping other 
municipalities out of the market. "
504,6," Nor does it help the Towns' claim that the statutes leave to the City the discretion whether to provide sewage services.  States 
must always be free to delegate such authority to their political subdivisions."
504,7," Requiring such a close examination of a state legislature's intent to determine whether the federal antitrust laws apply would be 
undesirable also because it would embroil the federal courts in the unnecessary interpretation of state statutes.  Besides 
burdening the courts, it would undercut the fundamental policy of Parker and the state action doctrine of immunizing state action 
from federal antitrust scrutiny.  See 1 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law para. 212.3(b) (Supp. 1982)."
504,8," Our view of the legislature's intent is supported by Town of Hallie v. City of Chippewa Falls, 105 Wis. 2d 533, 314 N. W. 2d 321 
(1982), in which the Supreme Court of Wisconsin rejected the Town of Hallie's challenge under state antitrust laws against the 
City of Chippewa Falls in a case quite similar to the one at bar.  There, the Town of Hallie argued that the City's refusal to 
provide it with sewage treatment services, the requirement of annexation, and the City's conditioning of the provision of 
treatment services on the acceptance also of sewage collection and other city services, violated the state antitrust laws. The 
State Supreme Court disagreed, concluding that the legislature intended the City to undertake the challenged actions.  Those 
actions therefore were exempt from the State's antitrust laws. Analyzing ยงยง 66.069(2)(c) and 144.07(1m), the court concluded 
that the legislature had ""viewed annexation by the city of a surrounding unincorporated area as a reasonable quid pro quo that a 
city could require before extending sewer services to the area."" Id., at 540-541, 314 N. W. 2d, at 325. Although the Wisconsin Supreme Court's opinion does not, of course, decide the question presented here of the City's immunity 
under the federal antitrust laws, it is instructive on the question of the state legislature's intent in enacting the statutes relating to 
the municipal provision of sewage services. "
505,9," Among other things, municipal conduct is invariably more likely to be exposed to public scrutiny than is private conduct.  
Municipalities in some States are subject to ""sunshine"" laws or other mandatory disclosure regulations, and municipal officers, 
unlike corporate heads, are checked to some degree through the electoral process.  Such a position in the public eye may 
provide some greater protection against antitrust abuses than exists for private parties."
505,10," In cases in which the actor is a state agency, it is likely that active state supervision would also not be required, although we 
do not here decide that issue.  Where state or municipal regulation by a private party is involved, however, active state 
supervision must be shown, even where a clearly articulated state policy exists.  See Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference, 
Inc. v. United States, post, at 62. "
513,1," The Court construes plaintiffs' pleadings to state that the sublicensees with whom INA allegedly conspired were wholly owned 
subsidiaries of INA. See Complaint para. 11."
513,2," Tying arrangements are expressly prohibited under Section 3 of the Clayton Act and, in the context of this case, may also 
constitute unlawful conduct under Section 2 of the Sherman Act to the extent that it aids in the unlawful extension of the scope of 
the lawful patent right. "
514,3," Even if the antitrust laws do apply to the territorial restrictions in INA's patent licensing scheme, such vertical allocations of 
markets are not per se illegal, but are subject to scrutiny under the rule of reason.  Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTA Sylvania, Inc., 
433 U.S. 36, 54-59, 97 S. Ct. 2549, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568 (1977) (rule of reason is the proper standard of antitrust scrutiny for 
vertically-imposed divisions of territories since such restraints often generate pro-competitive interbrand rivalry)."
514,4," Although federal courts generally apply the same antitrust-law-immunity to licensing schemes as that afforded to outright 
grants of patent rights, a number of commentators have challenged the legal rationale for the practice. The basic position of 
these commentators is that while Section 261 of the Patent Code expressly exempts assignments from conflicting antitrust 
provisions, an exemption for licenses may only be implied. Lacking an express exemption, licensing schemes should be subject 
to rule of reason scrutiny under the antitrust laws. Baxter, Legal Restrictions in Exploitation of the Patent Monopoly, 76 Yale L.J. "
515,267," (1966); Gibbons, Domestic Territorial Restrictions in Patent Transactions and the Antitrust Laws, 34 Geo. Wash.  L. Rev. 
893, 894-904 (1966); Turner, The Patent System and Competitive Policy, 44 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 450, 469-470 (1969); Andewalt and 
Allen, Patent Licensing and Immunity from the Antitrust Law -- The Government Prospective, in 123 PLI, Patent Antitrust 1980, 
at pp. 273-284. Form over substance will not control this Court's analysis. From a competition-oriented perspective, there is little difference 
between an assignment and a license of patent rights. The same pro-competition considerations apply when analyzing 
restrictions contained in the creation of both types of rights. Therefore, just as assignments enjoy immunity from antitrust 
scrutiny, licenses are similarly cloaked with such immunity. A license or a grant of patent rights is subject to antitrust scrutiny 
only upon a showing that the scheme unreasonably expands the scope of the legal monopoly granted by the federal 
government."
515,5," The types of practices constituting a misuse of patent monopoly power were reviewed in Brownell v. Ketcham Wire & Mfg. Co., 
211 F.2d 121, 128-129 (9th Cir. 1954). ""It is not the monopoly of the patent that is invalid. It is the improper use of that monopoly."" U.S. v. Line Material Co., 333 
U.S. 287, 310, 68 S. Ct. 550, 562, 92 L. Ed. 701 (1948). The courts have condemned many practices in connection with the 
use of patents, e.g.: (a) Use of invalid patents in price fixing: McGregor v. Westinghouse Electric & Mfg. Co., 329 U.S. 402, 407, 67 S. Ct. 421, 
91 L. Ed. 380 (1947). (b) Cross-licensing of patents: U.S. v. Line Material Co., supra. (c) Attempts to extend the scope of patent monopoly: Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co., 243 U.S. 502, 516, 37 S. Ct. 416, 61 L. Ed. 871 (1917); Carbice 
Corp. of America v. American Patents Development Corp., 283 U.S. 27, 31, 51 S. Ct. 334, 75 L. Ed. 819 (1931). (d) Illegal price fixing activities in connection with patents: "

Co., supra, Pfotzer v. Aqua Systems, Inc., 162 F.2d 779, (2d Cir. 1947), falls within this category. There was also involved 
the claim of royalties on unpatented articles. (e) Tying patents to unpatented devices or processes: Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. U.S., 309 U.S. 436, 456, 60 S. Ct. 618, 84 L. Ed. 852 (1940); Mercoid Corp. v. Mid-Continent

Regulator Co., 320 U.S. 680, 684, 64 S. Ct. 278, 88 L. Ed. 396 (1944). (f) Seeking to extend the effect of an expired patent: U.S. v. Timken Roller Bearing Co., 83 F. Supp. 284, 313-314 (D. Ohio 1949), affirmed Timken Roller Bearing Co. v. U.S., 
341 U.S. 593, 71 S. Ct. 971, 95 L. Ed. 1199 (1951). (g) Misuse of patents: U.S. v. National Lead Co., 332 U.S. 319, 67 S. Ct. 1634, 91 L. Ed. 2077 (1947); McCullough v. Kammerer Corp., 166 F.2d 
759 (9th Cir. 1948)."
516,6," As the Department of Justice recently noted, HN4[
] the level of antitrust scrutiny of patent licensing schemes should not be 
as stringent as that imposed when evaluating restrictions which do not involve patents or other types of intellectual property. Restrictions in licenses of intellectual property (e.g., patent, a copyright, trade secret, and know-how) . . . often are essential 
to ensure that new technology realizes its maximum legitimate return and benefits consumers as quickly and efficiently as 
possible. . . . Unless restrictions in intellectual property licenses involve naked restraints of trade unrelated to development 
of the intellectual property, or are used to coordinate a cartel among the owners of competing intellectual properties, the 
restrictions should not be condemned. Department of Justice, Vertical Restraints Guidelines, 50 Fed. Reg. No. 31, 6263, 6266 (February 14, 1985) (concluding that 
promulgated guidelines are not applicable to patent licensing schemes in view of differing competitive considerations applicable 
to intellectual property from typical commodities and services). "
519,7," The Justice Department recently took the position that ""tying arrangements generally do not have significant anticompetitive 
potential,"" Justice Department Guidelines on Vertical Restraints, supra, at 6271, and that it would prosecute such arrangements

528,10," Motor Carriers Traffic Association, Inc. (MCTA), another rate bureau operating in North Carolina, also was named as a

of state agencies, to intervene as a defendant.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 24(a).  Throughout this litigation, the NARUC has 
represented the interests of the Public Service Commissions of those States in which the defendant rate bureaus operate. "
529,11," The defendants also contended that their collective ratemaking activities were protected by the Noerr-Pennington doctrine.  
See Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127 (1961); Mine Workers v. Pennington, 
381 U.S. 657 (1965). Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals rejected this defense, and we do not address it.  See n.

529,12," A panel of that court, with one judge dissenting, had affirmed the District Court's judgment.  United States v. Southern Motor

530,17," Although we granted certiorari on the Noerr-Pennington issue as well, see n. 11, supra, our disposition of this case makes it 
unnecessary to consider the applicability of that doctrine to the petitioners' collective ratemaking activities."
530,18," JUSTICE STEVENS, noting that ""[implied] antitrust immunities . . . are disfavored . . . ,"" post, at 67, cites United States v. 
South-Eastern Underwriters Assn., 322 U.S. 533 (1944), for the proposition that ""if exceptions are to be written into the Sherman 
Act, they must come from Congress, and not this Court."" Id., at 561. The dissent apparently finds some significance in the fact 
that no federal statute expressly exempts the petitioners' collective ratemaking activities from the antitrust laws. See post, at 70. The dissent's argument on this point, of course, does not suggest that compulsion should be a prerequisite to a finding of state 
action immunity. Instead, the logical result of its reasoning would require us to overrule Parker v. Brown and its progeny, for the 
state action doctrine is an implied exemption to the antitrust laws. After over 40 years of congressional acquiescence, we are 
unwilling to abandon the Parker doctrine. JUSTICE STEVENS relies primarily upon United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters, supra, and Georgia v. Pennsylvania R. 
Co., 324 U.S. 439 (1945), in the first section of his dissent.  Neither of these cases, however, has any bearing on the scope of 
Parker immunity. In South-Eastern Underwriters, supra, the Court held only that the ""business of insurance is interstate 
commerce,"" Group Life & Health Ins. Co. v. Royal Drug Co., 440 U.S. 205, 217 (1979), and thus is subject to the Sherman Act's 
proscriptions.  The Court did not suggest that, because of congressional silence, state regulation could not immunize insurance 
companies from the federal antitrust laws. Instead, it reasoned that Parker did not protect the insurance companies because ""no 
states authorize combinations of insurance companies to coerce, intimidate, and boycott competitors and consumers in the 
manner . . . [there] alleged."" 322 U.S., at 562. In Georgia v. Pennsylvania R. Co., supra, the Court was concerned with whether 
Congress intended to immunize a federal regulatory program from the antitrust laws. See n. 21, infra."
530,19," In holding that the States were free to regulate ""domestic commerce,"" the Parker Court relied upon congressional silence.  
There are, however, some statements in the legislative history that affirmatively express a desire not ""to invade the legislative 
authority of the several States. . . ."" H. R. Rep. No. 1707, 51st Cong., 1st Sess., 1 (1890).  See Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., 428 
U.S. 579, 632 (1976) (Stewart, J., dissenting). "
531,20," As we hold today in Hallie v. Eau Claire, ante, at 46, the second prong of the Midcal test is inapplicable to municipalities.  
Although its anticompetitive conduct must be taken pursuant to a clearly articulated state policy, a municipality need not be 
supervised by the State in order to qualify for Parker immunity. See ante, at 46."
531,21," The dissent argues that a state regulatory program is entitled to Parker immunity only if an antitrust exemption is ""'necessary . 
. . to make the [program] work. . . .'"" Post, at 74 (quoting Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., supra, at 597). This argument overlooks 
the fact that, with the exception of a questionable dictum in Cantor, supra, the dissent's proposed test has been used only in 
deciding whether Congress intended to immunize a federal regulatory program from the Sherman Act's proscriptions.  See, e. g., 
Silver v. New York Stock Exchange, 373 U.S. 341, 357 (1963). In this context, if the federal courts wrongly conclude that an 
antitrust exemption is ""unnecessary,"" Congress can correct the error.  As the dissent recognizes, however, the Supremacy 
Clause would prevent state legislatures from taking similar remedial action.  Post, at 67.  Moreover, the proposed test would 
prompt the ""kind of interference with state sovereignty . . . that . . . Parker was intended to prevent."" 1 P. Areeda & D. Turner, 
Antitrust Law para. 214, p. 88 (1978).  Therefore, we hold that HN3[
] state action immunity is not dependent on a finding that 
an exemption from the federal antitrust laws is ""necessary."" "

] Under the Interstate Commerce Act, motor common carriers are permitted, but not compelled, to engage in collective interstate ratemaking. 49 U. S. C. ยงยง 10706(b)(2) and 10706(d)(2)(C).  It is clear, therefore, that Congress has recognized the 
advantages of a permissive policy.  We think it unlikely that Congress intended to prevent the States from adopting virtually 
identical policies at the intrastate level. "
533,23," Contrary to the Government's arguments, our holding here does not suggest that a State may ""give immunity to those who 
violate the Sherman Act by authorizing them to violate it."" Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S., at 351; see Schwegmann Bros. v. Calvert 
Distillers Corp., 341 U.S. 384 (1951). A clearly articulated permissive policy will satisfy the first prong of the Midcal test.  The 
second prong, however, prevents States from ""casting . . . a gauzy cloak of state involvement over what is essentially a private 
price-fixing arrangement."" Midcal, 445 U.S., at 106. This active supervision requirement ensures that a State's actions will 
immunize the anticompetitive conduct of private parties only when the ""state has demonstrated its commitment to a program 
through its exercise of regulatory oversight."" See 1 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law ยง 213a, p. 73 (1978)."

534,25," The Mississippi statute stands in sharp contrast to the Colorado Home Rule Amendment, which we considered in Community 
Communications Co. v. Boulder, 455 U.S. 40 (1982). In Boulder, the State Constitution gave municipalities extensive powers of 
self-government.  Id., at 43-44. Pursuant to this authority, the City of Boulder prohibited a cable television company from 
expanding its operations.  The Court held that because the Home Rule Amendment did not evidence an intent to displace 
competition in the cable television industry, id., at 55, Boulder's anticompetitive ordinance was not enacted pursuant to a clearly 
articulated state policy. This holding was premised on the fact that Boulder, as a ""home rule municipality,"" was authorized to 
elect free-market competition as an alternative to regulation. Id., at 56. In this case, on the other hand, the Mississippi Public Service Commission is not authorized to choose free-market competition.  
Instead, it is required to prescribe rates for motor common carriers on the basis of statutorily enumerated factors.  Miss. Code 
Ann. ยง 77-7-221 (1972).  These factors bear no discernible relationship to the prices that would be set by a perfectly efficient and 
unregulated market.  Therefore, the Mississippi statute clearly indicates that the legislature intended to displace competition in 
the intrastate trucking industry with a regulatory program. "

539,13," As in Cantor, the Court concluded in the Midcal case that the State's ostensible compulsion of the resale-price-maintenance

carrier participating in the rate discussions.  When this happens, consumers lose the benefit of price competition that would 
occur if more efficient carriers were able to offer more attractive rates.  Another serious problem has been the closed nature of "

546,1," At the outset, Lane suggests an alternative method of analyzing the issue.  Rather than engaging in a straightforward analysis 
of the issue under the factors enumerated by the Supreme Court in Gulf Offshore, Lane argues that the exclusive jurisdiction of 
the federal courts would be clearly established if the anti-tying provision could be deemed an antitrust law since it is well-settled 
that federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction of claims arising under the antitrust laws. See, e.g., Blumenstock Bros. Ad. Agency 
v. Curtis Pub. Co., 252 U.S. 436, 440, 40 S. Ct. 385, 386, 64 L. Ed. 649 (1920); Kurek v. Pleasure Driveway & Park District of 
Peoria, 583 F.2d 378 (7th Cir.1978), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 1090, 99 S. Ct. 873, 59 L. Ed. 2d 57 (1979). We decline, however, to 
analyze the issue in such a fashion. Although Congress did confer exclusive jurisdiction upon the federal courts to hear claims arising under the antitrust laws, see 
15 U.S.C. ยง 15, Congress specifically defined ""antitrust laws."" The Bank Holding Company Act is not included in the definition.  
See 15 U.S.C. ยง 12. Moreover, the factors which might lead one to classify the anti-tying provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act as either an 
antitrust statute or a banking statute bear little, if any, relation to the factors which must be considered in determining whether 
jurisdiction is exclusive or concurrent. The general principle of state-court jurisdiction over cases arising under federal laws is straightforward: HN3[
] state 
courts may assume subject-matter jurisdiction over a federal cause of action absent provision by Congress to the contrary 
or disabling incompatibility between the federal claim and state-court adjudication. . . .  This rule is premised on the relation 
between the States and the National Government within our federal system.  Gulf Offshore Co. v. Mobil Oil Corp., 453 U.S. 473, 477-78, 101 S. Ct. 2870, 2874-75, 69 L. Ed. 2d 784 (1981) (citations 
omitted).  Although there may be standards that might provide guidance in classifying a provision as either an antitrust law or a 
banking law, we feel confident that these standards would not be ""premised on the relation between the States and the National 
Government within our federal system."" Id. Finally, the Supreme Court has suggested that the factors enumerated in Gulf Offshore are the exclusive means of resolving a 
controversy concerning the existence of exclusive federal jurisdiction. See Hathorn v. Lovorn, 457 U.S. 255, 266, 102 S. Ct. 
2421, 2428, 72 L. Ed. 2d 824 (1982) (""Only . . . [the factors enumerated in Gulf Offshore] will rebut the presumption [of 
concurrent jurisdiction]""). "
547,2," In Nesglo, Inc. v. Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A., 562 F. Supp. 1029, 1042-44 (D.P.R.1983), the court viewed 12 U.S.C. ยง 1978 
as expressing a congressional directive in favor of concurrent jurisdiction. The section provides: Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed as affecting in any manner the right of the United States or any other 
party to bring an action under any other law of the United States or of any State, including any right which may exist in 
addition to specific statutory authority, challenging the legality of any act or practice which may be proscribed by this 
chapter.  No regulation or order issued by the Board under this chapter shall in any manner constitute a defense to such 
action. HN7[
]"
547,12," U.S.C. ยง 1978. In our view, ยง 1978 evidences Congress' desire that the Bank Holding Company Act not preempt state 
legislation in this area.  Although the absence of federal preemption is not necessarily indicative of an intent to confer concurrent 
jurisdiction upon the states, it does tend to support that result because one would normally expect a litigant to bring all his claims 
in a single forum.  A holding to the contrary would, as a practical matter, frustrate the intent of Congress, since it seems likely 
that many litigants would forego an adjudication of their federal rights due to the cost and inconvenience of proceeding in a 
separate forum.  Although the availability of pendent jurisdiction in the federal courts lessens this concern, it does not eliminate 
it.  Similarly, a holding of exclusive federal jurisdiction would give litigants who were unsuccessful in state court two ""bites at the 
apple."" This we decline to do."

] The section states: ""2. No licensee authorized to sell liquor at retail for off-premises consumption shall sell, offer to sell, solicit an order for or 
advertise any item of liquor at a price which is less than cost.  As used in this section, the term: ""(a) 'liquor' shall mean liquor bearing a brand or trade name, and of like age and quality, which has been duly registered with and 
approved by the liquor authority pursuant to section 107A of this chapter, and ""(b) 'cost' shall mean the price of such item of liquor to the retailer plus twelve percentum of such price, which is declared as a 
matter of legislative determination to represent the average minimum overhead necessarily incurred in connection with the sale 
by the retailer of such item of liquor. As used in this paragraph (b) the term 'price' shall mean the bottle price to retailers, before 
any discounts, contained in the applicable schedule filed with the liquor authority pursuant to section one hundred one-b of this 
chapter by a manufacturer or wholesaler from whom the retailer purchases liquor and which is in effect at the time the retailer 
sells or offers to sell such item of liquor; except, that where no applicable schedule is in effect the bottle price of the item of liquor 
shall be computed as the appropriate fraction of the case price of such item, before any discounts, most recently invoiced to the 
retailer."" "
562,2," On the important matter of price regulation, the Commission noted that under the former statute the manufacturer was 
permitted to fix the price of liquor and the retailer could not sell it for less (Alcoholic Beverage Control Law former ยง 101-c).  The 
assumption behind this law was that high prices promoted temperance.  The Commission's studies led it to believe, however, 
that the assumed favorable relation of high-priced liquor to temperance did not exist (Moreland Commn Report No. 1, at 3, 17).  
The principal benefit from the statutory price provision went to the liquor interests who, after setting their own prices, had them 
enforced by State investigators.  This regulation, the Commission said, served only ""to insure the profit margins of the various 
segments of the industry"" (Report No. 3, at 19).  Moreover, the Commission found gross price discrimination against the New 
York consumer by the industry.  Indeed, it found that the retail price for a fifth of a well-known brand of liquor was lower in 
Washington, D.C. than the wholesale price in New York (see, Report No.  3, at 5, 6).  ""For almost every fifth of whiskey that he 
buys"", the Report stated, ""the New York consumer pays from 50 cents to $ 1.50 more than the price at which it is available in at 
least seven freer price markets"" (id., 3). "

573,3," The former version of Section 7, 15 U.S.C. ยง 18, provides in pertinent part: "
574,," No corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital 
and no corporation subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission shall acquire the whole or any part of the assets 
of another corporation engaged also in commerce, where in any line of commerce in any section of the country, the effect of 
such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly. . . ."
574,4," St. Jude argued that it could challenge the acquisition under Section 2 of the Sherman Act. Because it appears that St. Jude 
might be able to state a claim under Section 2, the court will grant it leave to amend."
574,5," The court expresses no opinion as to whether sanctions for allegedly false and evasive discovery responses by CarboMedics 
are appropriate.  This question has been previously referred to Special Master Morris M. Sherman.  See Order of Reference 
dated March 15, 1985. "
580,*," NOTICE: This opinion and order has been edited for the public record, to comply with the order in this case dated January 14, 
1985, which declared the proceedings on this motion confidential. The unedited opinion has been filed under seal."
580,1," Plaintiffs in this action are the United States Football League (""USFL""), its member clubs and the former owner of a member 
club. The USFL is a not-for-profit unincorporated association which, with and for its member clubs, stages and promotes 
professional football games. Since its first season in 1983 it has been operating on a spring and summer schedule, though it has 
announced plans to switch to a fall and winter season beginning in 1986."
580,2," Defendants herein are the National Football League (""NFL""), its member clubs and NFL Commissioner Alvin R. (""Pete"") 
Rozelle. Like the USFL, the NFL is a not-for-profit unincorporated association that presents professional football games. The 
NFL playing season is in the fall and winter."
580,3," I have received moving papers, opposition papers, a reply, a surreply and a rejoinder, as well as numerous supplementary 
letters. While I appreciate the parties' conscientious desire fully to inform and educate the Court, I would recommend that such 
procedure be avoided in the future. "
581,4," See, e.g., Waterbury Garment Corp. v. Strata Prods., Inc., 554 F. Supp. 63, 65 (S.D.N.Y. 1982); Neiman v. Local 144, Hotel, 
Hosp., Nursing Home & Allied Servs. Union, 512 F. Supp. 187, 189 (S.D.N.Y. 1981)."
581,5," See NCK Org., Ltd. v. Bregman, 542 F.2d 128, 131 (2d Cir. 1976). "
582,6," The Second Circuit's recent tightening of the standards for granting motions to disqualify counsel has been noted by 
commentators. See, e.g.  Lindgren, Toward a New Standard of Attorney Disqualification, 1982 American B. Found. Research J. 
419 (1982); Note, Developments in the Law -- Conflicts of Interest in the Legal Profession, 94 Harv. L. Rev. 1244, 1315-33 
(1981)."
582,7," Allegaert v. Perot, 565 F.2d 246 (2d Cir. 1977), suggests that the test for disqualification includes a fourth element. In Allegaert, 
the Second Circuit held that for HN5[
] a disqualification motion to succeed, the movant must demonstrate that the subject 
attorney was in a position to receive confidences that the movant would expect would not be disclosed to the attorney's present 
client. See Williamsburg Wax Museum, Inc. v. Historic Figures, Inc., 501 F. Supp. 326 (D.D.C. 1980), aff'd, 728 F.2d 503 (D.C. 
Cir. 1984); C.A.M., s.p.a. v. E.B. Marks Music, Inc., 558 F. Supp. 57 (S.D.N.Y. 1983); Waterbury Garment Corp. v. Strata Prods., 
Inc., 554 F. Supp. 63 (S.D.N.Y. 1982); Premium Prods. Sales Corp. v. Chipwich, Inc., 539 F. Supp. 427, 434 (S.D.N.Y. 1982). 
This element becomes an issue especially in cases where a partnership, joint venture or other cooperative effort breaks up, or 
where two former co-parties to a litigation later sue each other. If counsel for the combined effort then represents one of the 
former co-venturers in the ensuing litigation, his adversary might move to disqualify him because of his receipt of confidences 
from the movant during the course of the cooperative venture. In Allegaert, the Second Circuit held that such motions must fail. 
The Court required that a movant show that it reasonably expected that any information it imparted to counsel would not be 
revealed to its former co-venturer in the course of the prior representation. The Allegaert rule merits brief mention here because Paul, Weiss was in 1981 concurrently representing both the USFL and NFL 
Commissioner Rozelle, who is a defendant in this action. Paul, Weiss, particularly Arthur Liman, had a long-standing relationship 
with Rozelle, having represented him in both football-related and non-football-related matters. When the USFL's organizers 
originally approached Paul, Weiss regarding possible representation, Paul, Weiss determined that it should not take on the "
583,," USFL as a client unless both the USFL and Rozelle were informed of the concurrent representation and both approved. Both 
were so told, and neither one objected to the arrangement. Neither side contends that the USFL's consent in 1981 implies that the USFL should feel as assured today as it must have in 
1981 that its confidences will not travel within the Paul, Weiss firm and ultimately make their way to other Paul, Weiss clients, 
particularly Rozelle and the NFL.  Nor is it argued that the former simultaneous representation triggers the Allegaert rule, 
namely, that the USFL could not have reasonably expected its confidences not to be revealed to Rozelle during the course of 
the prior concurrent representation. Allegaert presupposes that the subject matter of the prior representation was one in which 
both of the present litigants were involved together. In such a situation, it is not reasonable for a client to expect pertinent 
information to be withheld from its co-party. That is not the case here. Since the matters Paul, Weiss handled for the USFL and 
Rozelle respectively in 1981 were not related to one another, the USFL could reasonably expect that its confidences would not 
travel to other clients of Paul, Weiss. Therefore, the Allegaert rule, even if it is a separate element of the test for disqualification, 
has no bearing here."
583,8," See also Forte v. Cities Serv. Co., No. 82 Civ. 7120, slip op. at n.1 (S.D.N.Y. Sep. 22, 1983) (Sand, J.) (available on LEXIS, 
Genfed library, Dist file) (""[Movant] Cities Service must be able to explain in detail what facts and issues were involved in the 
prior action and how those facts and issues relate to this case -- specifically to the cross claims that Cities Service and Gulf have 
asserted against each other."")."
583,9," Montgomery's affidavit of January 11, 1985 will be cited as ""Montgomery afft."", and his affidavit of February 27, 1985 will be 
referred to as ""Montgomery supp. afft."". Similar citation forms will be used for the affidavits of John C. Taylor, III, Max Gitter, and 
David T. Washburn."
583,10," Paul, Weiss's relationship with Rozelle is long-standing and continues to this day. Paul, Weiss also represents NFL Films, and 
on occasion has done legal work for the NFL (Liman afft. para. 4). "
584,11," An exclusivity clause purports to prevent the lessor from leasing the property to a person other than the lessee if that person 
will use the property to compete with the lessee. An example of a stadium lease exclusivity clause can be found in Hecht v. Pro-
Football, Inc., 187 U.S.  App. D.C. 73, 570 F.2d 982, 985 n.2 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (""'at no time during the term of this Lease 
Agreement shall the Stadium be let or rented to any professional football team other than the Washington Redskins. '""), cert.  
denied, 436 U.S. 956, 57 L. Ed. 2d 1121, 98 S. Ct. 3069 (1978)."
584,12," Like this action, Hecht was brought under sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. "
585,13," DiLeo's position and role are nowhere explained. He appears to have been advising David Dixon on certain USFL-connected 
matters."
585,14," Paul, Weiss's USFL file did not contain the memo on the essential facilities doctrine, but did contain the cover letter and 
Topkis's return letter."
585,15," Kurtz assigned a number of persons besides himself to work on the tax matters at the Washington office. All of Kurtz's 
information was obtained from Taylor and Washburn; he had no client contact. His only arguable client contact was not related 
to the League's tax problems (Kurtz afft. para. 5)."
585,16," Topkis's diaries contain no indication that he received or read the letter and memo from DiLeo. In any event, the subject matter 
of the memo is clearly unrelated to this case."
585,17," The work done for the USFL by Paul, Weiss is summarized in Washburn afft. para. 12 and the other affidavits referred to 
therein. "
586,18," Paul, Weiss claims to have been excluded from the July 9 meeting as well, though only for a short time. (Taylor afft. para. 10, 
Washburn afft. para. 7)."
586,19," See Harvard Note, supra note 6, at 1325 (""Case law provides an uncertain definition of the term ['substantial relationship'] to 
concerned attorneys.""). Apparently, defining ""substantial relationship"" is a long-standing problem, dating back at least as far as 
1955, two short years after T.C. Theatre. See United States v. Standard Oil Co., 136 F. Supp. 345, 355 (S.D.N.Y. 1955), quoted 
in Silver Chrysler Plymouth, Inc. v. Chrysler Motors Corp., 518 F.2d 751, 754 (2d Cir. 1975) (""unfortunately, the cases furnish no 
applicable guide as to what creates a 'substantial' relationship."") overruled on other grounds, Armstrong v. McAlpin, 625 F.2d 
433 (2d Cir. 1980), vacated, 449 U.S. 1106, 101 S. Ct. 911, 66 L. Ed. 2d 835 (1981). "
587,20," The Second Circuit's approach, as noted, centers on comparing the issues dealt with in each representation and presuming 
disclosure of confidences once a substantial relationship is established. The Seventh Circuit takes a somewhat different view. 
Rather than focusing on issues, it focuses on evaluating the relevance to the instant litigation of the confidences allegedly 
communicated in the prior representation. It uses a three-step analysis. Initially, the trial judge must make a factual reconstruction of the scope of the prior legal representation. Second, it must be 
determined whether it is reasonable to infer that the confidential information allegedly given would have been given to a 
lawyer representing a client in those matters. Finally, it must be determined whether that information is relevant to the 
issues raised in the litigation pending against the former client. Westinghouse Elec. Corp. v. Gulf Oil Corp., 588 F.2d 221, 225 (7th Cir. 1978). Accord La Salle Nat. Bank v. County of Lake, 
703 F.2d 252, 255-56 (7th Cir.1983); Novo Terapeutisk Laboratorium, A/S v. Baxter Travenol Laboratories, Inc., 607 F.2d 186, 
195-96 (7th Cir. 1979) (en banc). For purposes of the case before me, I see no practical difference between the Second Circuit's comparison-of-issues approach 
and the Seventh Circuit's approach of evaluating the relevance to the instant case of the alleged confidential communications. 
However, it may be that in certain situations the difference in approach could be significant. But see Emm Ess Metals Co., Inc. v. 
Triumph Alloys Int'l, Inc., 1979-1 Trade Cas. (CCH) P62,680 (S.D.N.Y. May 11, 1979) (Southern District case adopting Seventh 
Circuit's Westinghouse approach)."
587,21," See also Cheng v. GAF, supra; Hull v. Celanese Corp., 513 F.2d 568 (2d Cir. 1975); Yaretsky v. Blum, 525 F. Supp. 24 
(S.D.N.Y. 1981)."
587,22," The main ground for disqualification in C.A.M. was the rule of Allegaert v. Perot, see supra note 7. The challenged firm had 
represented both C.A.M. and E.B. Marks in the earlier litigation. "
588,23," Judge McMahon analyzed the issues presented by the respective cases as follows. There is no question that information pertaining to the management, profitability, potential exposure and value of a business 
impacts upon a decision of whether or not to sell the business. However, whether the building materials business is salable, 
or even whether senior management of GAF believed it to be salable, is not directly in issue in either of the cases before 
us. Rather, what is at issue is whether the senior management of GAF, as part of a campaign to fend off a proxy fight, 
issued false statements claiming that serious negotiations regarding the potential sale of the business were underway and 
would continue during 1982. Also at issue is whether senior management utilized corporate resources in this campaign in 
breach of fiduciary duty. The issues in the prior product liability and present cases cannot be termed identical or essentially 
the same. GAF, 559 F. Supp. at 753. "
589,24," See CITC Indus., Inc. v. Manow Int'l Corp., 1978-1 Trade Cas.  (CCH) P 61,947 at 74,006 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 24, 1978) (emphasis 
in original): So long as the antitrust claim is based only on the fraudulent misuse of the Zumbro patent [with which attorney Relson has 
no connection whatsoever], and not on other allegations of attempts to monopolize, the prior representation of CITC by Mr. 
Relson does not require his disqualification. . . . Without a broad assault on CITC's practices which could relate 
substantially to issues involved in Relson's prior representation, there are insufficient grounds for requiring his 
disqualification."
589,25," What effect my finding of a substantial relationship should have is a different question. It is dealt with infra, Part III.B, C. "
590,26," Paul, Weiss relies heavily on Laker Airways, Ltd. v. Pan Am World Airways, et al., 103 F.R.D. 22 (D.D.C. 1984) to establish 
that the two representations are not related. Its argument would be correct if Paul, Weiss's services in 1981 had been limited to 
Topkis' opinion on the enforceability of exclusivity clauses.  Such an abstract opinion divorced from any concrete factual 
considerations would not be related to the complaint's allegations of monopolistic practices aimed at foreclosing competition in 
the market for professional football. But Paul, Weiss's services went considerably beyond Topkis's opinion. The fact that Topkis's 
work was the only antitrust work done for the USFL does not end the matter. HN9[
] It is the congruence of factual matters, 
rather than areas of law, that establishes a substantial relationship between representations for disqualification purposes. See 
e.g., Emle, supra (one common factual question in two otherwise unrelated litigations can lead to disqualification), Laker, supra, 
slip op. at 33-37. So the fact that Paul, Weiss's antitrust services were not substantially related to the subject matter of this 
litigation does not mean that other aspects of the firm's representation of the USFL can not be substantially related."
590,27," A large part of the dispute in this motion is over defining what are the issues being litigated here. Defendants contend that the 
dispute is over the existence vel non of anticompetitive conduct by the NFL directed against the USFL once the USFL began its 
operation in competition with the NFL. Thus, they argue that since Paul, Weiss negotiated no stadium leases or television 
contracts for the USFL, was not involved in any transactions in which the NFL exerted pressure on others in order to discourage 
them from dealing with the USFL or otherwise was privy to any information about NFL conduct directed against the USFL, the 
representations are not substantially related. Plaintiffs, of course, take a broader view of the matters at issue in this litigation. 
They aver that certain of the matters addressed in Paul, Weiss's 1981 representation of the USFL are at least substantially 
similar if not identical to matters material to this litigation. They point to Paul, Weiss's services in attempting to find owners, in 
rendering advice on stadium access and in drafting the USFL's formational documents as matters which will be material to this 
litigation. On balance, plaintiffs' conception of the scope of this litigation is more realistic. This litigation is not limited only to considerations 
of NFL conduct aimed at the USFL which occurred once the USFL began competing.  Rather, the complaint alleges that the NFL 
not only occupied the entire market, but also took steps to ensure that it would be structurally impossible for any newcomer to 
compete effectively. The entire present structure of the market for professional football is in issue here. In the face of such 
allegations, Paul, Weiss's claims that its representation did not deal with any discrete instances of NFL misconduct are 
meaningless; it is not discrete instances that are at issue here. "
591,28," HN11[
] The presumption that confidences were disclosed should be distinguished from the different presumption that each 
individual lawyer in the firm was privy to those confidences. The latter presumption is rebuttable. See Schiessle v. Stephens, 717 
F.2d 417, 420 n.2 (7th Cir. 1983); Analytica, supra, at 1267; Freeman v. Chicago Musical Instrument Co., 689 F.2d 715 (7th Cir. 
1982); Silver Chrysler, supra; Laskey Bros. of W. Va., Inc. v. Warner Bros. Pictures, 224 F.2d 824 (2d Cir. 1955), cert.  denied, 
350 U.S. 932, 100 L. Ed. 814, 76 S. Ct. 300 (1956). The Eighth Circuit's view is somewhat different. See Arkansas v. Dean 
Foods Prods.  Co., Inc., 605 F.2d 380, 385 (8th Cir. 1979) (""Facts submitted to rebut the existence of actual conflict, in an effort 
to escape the impact of Canon 4 [protecting client confidences] would not in every case assure escape from the impact of Canon 
9 [avoiding appearance of impropriety], where the non-existence of actual conflict is presumed.""), overruled on other grounds, In 
re Mutli-Piece Rim Products Liability Litigation, 612 F.2d 377 (8th Cir. 1980) (en banc), vacated, 449 U.S. 368, 101 S. Ct. 669, 
66 L. Ed. 2d 571 (1981)."
591,29," Additionally, it is at least a fair inference from the language of Cheng that the Second Circuit views the presumption as 
generally irrebuttable. See Cheng, 631 F.2d at 1056. "
592,30," ""HN12[
] 'Confidence' refers to information protect by the attorney-client privilege under applicable law."" The First Circuit apparently feels that the disqualification motion is limited to protecting privileged information only. See Kevlik v. 
Goldstein, 724 F.2d 844 (1st Cir. 1984)."
592,31," Strictly speaking, this view accords with the ethical obligations of the attorney under the Code of Professional Responsibility 
(""CPR""). HN13[
] Under Disciplinary Rule (""DR"") 4-101(B), a lawyer shall not knowingly: (1) Reveal a confidence or secret of his client. (2) Use a confidence or secret of his client to the disadvantage of the client. (3) Use a confidence or secret of his client for the advantage of himself or of a third person, unless the client consents after 
full disclosure. ""Confidences"" are defined in DR 4-101(A), see note 28, supra. HN14[
] DR 4-101(A) defines ""secrets"" as well: ""'secret' refers 
to other information [not a confidence] gained in the professional relationship that the client has requested be held inviolate or 
the disclosure of which would be likely to be detrimental to the client."" The CPR proscribes knowing use of client confidences and secrets. The disqualification remedy is supposed to guard against 
even inadvertent revelation or use of client information, see, e.g., Emle, 478 F.2d at 571. Thus, the USFL's argument has some 
appeal. The CPR is not, however, dispositive of this motion. While the CPR is a source by which the courts may be guided, it is not the 
final word on disqualification. Courts are not policemen of the legal profession; that is a matter for the disciplinary arm of the bar. 
Disqualification is granted to protect the integrity of the proceedings, not to monitor the ethics of attorneys' conduct. As the 
Second Circuit has noted, The reporter for the ABA Committee that drafted the Code of Professional Responsibility recently noted that the Code's 
Disciplinary Rules were drafted for use in disciplinary proceedings and were not intended to be used as rules governing 
disqualification motions. The Code nevertheless will continue to provide guidance for the courts in determining whether a 
case would be tainted by the participation of an attorney or firm. Armstrong v. McAlpin, 625 F.2d 433, 446 n.26 (2d Cir. 1980) (en banc) (citations omitted), vacated on other grounds, 449 U.S. 
1106, 101 S. Ct. 911, 66 L. Ed. 2d 835 (1981). See also W.T. Grant Co. v. Haines, 531 F.2d 671, 677 (2d Cir. 1976) (""The 
business of the court is to dispose of litigation and not to act as a general overseer of the ethics of those who practice here 
unless the questioned behavior taints the trial of the cause before it.""). Thus, Paul, Weiss's potential violation of the provisions of 
the CPR is not in itself a reason to disqualify. "
594,32," It may be argued that the NFL obviously is in possession of its own leases, so that Paul, Weiss can not make ""unfair use"" of 
them. This argument fails once the importance of factual context is recognized. The specific concerns of a client affect what a 
lawyer looks for. So it is the study of leases from the USFL's perspective that is the key here."
594,33," It is evident from the nature and extent of the representation that more was involved than filling out forms and marking up 
documents used in prior transactions (see Washburn afft. Exhibits B, E). Thus some consideration of the factual context by the 
attorneys perforce was necessary. As the Eighth Circuit wrote, No set of canons are [sic] needed to establish the proposition that HN17[
] one offering services as a counselor must, if 
he would counsel well, receive full disclosure from the counseled. Indeed, a counselor at law is enjoined to probe deeply for 
all the facts, favorable and unfavorable, before counseling a particular course for his client. Arkansas v. Dean Foods Prods., Inc., 605 F.2d 380, 385 (8th Cir. 1979) overruled on other grounds, In re Multi-Piece Rim 
Products Liability, 612 F.2d 377 (8th Cir. 1980) (en banc), vacated, 449 U.S. 368, 101 S. Ct. 669, 66 L. Ed. 2d 571 (1981). "
595,34," ""HN19[
] If a lawyer is required to decline employment or to withdraw from employment under a Disciplinary Rule, no partner 
or associate . . . [in] his firm may accept or continue such employment."""
595,35," The Seventh Circuit suggests several factors for a court to consider in deciding whether the presumption has been rebutted. HN20[
] A district court, in resolving this issue, may . . . rely on any of a number of factors, among them being the size of 
the law firm, the area of specialization of the attorney, the attorney's position in the firm, and the demeanor and credibility of 
witnesses at the evidentiary hearing [required by the Seventh Circuit]. Freeman v. Chicago Musical Instrument Co., 689 F.2d 715, 723 (7th Cir. 1982)."
595,36," The attorney in question had been a supervisor at the SEC while it was investigating the matter that gave birth to the 
Armstrong litigation.  The Second Circuit was concerned that firmwide disqualification would ""hamper the government's efforts to 
hire qualified attorneys"" since prospective government attorneys may choose not to enter government service out of concern 
that private firms will avoid hiring them in the future in order to avoid firmwide disqualification. Id. at 443. "
596,37," The Seventh Circuit, for example, HN21[
] has approved the use of Chinese Walls in lawyer-movement cases even where 
the ""infected"" attorney gained his presumed knowledge not during government service, but during the course of private practice 
at a different firm. The firm seeking to avoid disqualification by erecting a screen bears the burden of proving that such a 
procedure would be effective. See Schiessle v. Stephens, 717 F.2d 417, 421 (7th Cir. 1983)."
596,38," Indeed, the Second Circuit has expressed its concern that information would flow within the firm in the course of a concurrent 
representation even when a Chinese Wall has been in effect from the time the concurrent representation began. See Fund of 
Funds, Ltd. v. Arthur Andersen & Co., 567 F.2d 225, 229 n.10 (2d Cir. 1977). A fortiori, in this case, where the wall was not put 
into place until three years after the concurrent representation, there is reason to surmise that information did travel among the 
attorneys in the firm. "
603,1," The letter stated: Any of the parties may cease option payment beginning with the subsequent payments due as of the end of January and 
continuing through June if they so desire, and the other parties shall have the opportunity to purchase the withdrawing 
partners interest.  If both partners desire to purchase this interest, it would be on a proportionate basis as it now stands. "
605,2," The incriminating memoranda circulated among Federated officers included the following: [Undated; no salutation and signature illegible] If we can't get Joske's [a major department store in Texas] (and there's no assurance that we can, shouldn't we consider 
signing up Monty Ward & as this letter indicates stop the second centre.  Bill will you poll our people & perhaps we should 
talk to Jim Selonick [senior vice president of Federated] about the problem. October 28, 1975 from Federated official Bill Shiffick to four others: I would appreciate your thoughts as regards Mr. Berman's [also affiliated with Federated] question regarding Montgomery-
Wards as a suitable alternate to Joske's. I strongly urge we talk to MW and head off a new center, if possible. October 28, 1975 from one Federated official to Bill Shiffick:"
605,1," ) I do not consider Mont. Ward a suitable alternate to Joske's at GG [Greenspoint].  With Penny's & Sears already there I 
feel MW will not enhance the prestige of the center as much as Joske's would."
605,2," ) It would only be worth considering if it were strictly a defensive measure to prevent the building of another center. October 28, 1975 from Bill Shiffick to Mr. Berman: Collective thoughts and recommendations of [four Federated officials] are that we make a strong recommendation to Mr. 
Selonick and F.S.R. that they work at bringing Montgomery Ward into the GreensGate center and that in doing so they 
enlist Montgomery Wards best efforts to also bring Joske's along with them to GreensGate. This means a five (5) major store center, which we believe the best tactic to forestall another center being developed a few 
miles down the road. "
606,3," The district court ordered a directed verdict on the antitrust claims against Deauville on several grounds, including the failure to 
prove either the geographic or the product market.  It is by no means clear that the district court erred in this holding, and its 
opinion exhibits considerable thought and insight into the matter.  However, because we reach our decision on separate 
grounds, we do not address this issue. In addition to the preceding assumptions, we also assume without deciding that Deauville has alleged ""antitrust injury."" 
Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 97 S. Ct. 690, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977). "
607,4," The Second Circuit's reasoning in a recent case decided under the Clayton Act casts light here: ""In the present case, a market 
definition artificially restricted to existing firms competing at one moment may yield market share statistics that are not an 
accurate proxy for market power when substantial potential competition able to respond quickly to price increases exists."" United 
States v. Waste Management, 743 F.2d 976 (2d Cir.1984). "
608,5," Contra Albert Pick-Barth v. Mitchell Woodbury, 57 F.2d 96 (1st Cir. 1932). After a thorough consideration of the issues 
involved, this circuit rejected Pick-Barth in Northwest Power where we held that if a defendant's acts have not palpably injured 
competition and produced an impermissible degree of market power there could be no violation of section 1 in a case governed 
by the rule of reason. Northwest Power, at 90.  Accordingly, to the extent to which Multiflex v. Samuel Moore, 709 F.2d 980 (5th 
Cir. 1983) conflicts with Northwest Power, Multiflex is not good precedent."
608,6," ""Monopoly"" here is used to refer to unlawful ""market power,"" not that extreme degree of market power termed ""monopoly 
power""; Northwest Power did not involve a monopolization claim. "
609,7," Deauville also argues that any right the parties had to withdraw from the venture was conditioned upon compliance with the 
terms of the November 26 letter and thus could be exercised only by cessation of the periodic payments necessary to keep the "
610,," site purchase option alive.  We agree with the district court that the language of the agreement was not conditional, and 
therefore was not intended to limit the manner in which the parties could withdraw from the venture."
610,8," We express no opinion as to what amount of damages the evidence here might reasonably support, although we believe a jury 
could reasonably find at least some damages have been demonstrated.  We do note, however, that Texas law does not permit 
recovery of prospective profits for a newly established business.  Keener v. Sizzler Family Steakhouses, 597 F.2d 453 (5th 
Cir.1979); McBrayer v. Teckla, 496 F.2d 122 (5th Cir.1974). We do not decide whether this rule has application in the present 
case, but leave the matter in the first instance to the trial court. "
611,9," We recognize a degree of incongruity, at least on the surface, in an opinion striking down the federal antitrust claims and yet 
finding evidence of malice necessary to support the state claim of unlawful interference.  At least one important distinction to be 
made is, broadly speaking, that the federal law protects competition; the state law, requiring no finding regarding market power, 
protects the competitor. "

618,1," References to the indictment throughout this decision are to the indictment in 83-CR-128.  The indictment in 84-CR-72 is 
virtually identical to the 83-CR-128 indictment. The two actions were consolidated by order of this court on July 12, 1984.  United 
States v. Rubbish Removal, Inc., No 83-CR-128 (N.D.N.Y. July 12, 1984). "
619,2," Although many courts list ""manner and means"" as separate elements of a Sherman Act indictment, this court considers them 
synonyms."
619,3," Paragraphs 11, 12 and 13 of the indictment provide:"
619,11," .  Beginning at least as early as 1974 and continuing until at least the Spring of 1982, the exact dates being unknown to the 
Grand Jury, the defendants and co-conspirators engaged in a continuing combination and conspiracy in unreasonable restraint 
of the aforesaid interstate trade and commerce in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 1."
619,12," .  The aforesaid combination and conspiracy consisted of a continuing agreement, understanding and concert of action among 
the defendants and co-conspirators, the substantial terms of which were to: (a) allocate and divide customers for containerized refuse removal services in the Onondaga County area among the defendants 
and co-conspirators; and (b) rig bids and price quotations for the provision of containerized refuse removal services to customers in the Onondaga County 
area."
619,13," .  For the purpose of forming and effectuating the aforesaid combination and conspiracy, the defendants and co-conspirators 
did those things which they combined and conspired to do."

619,5," The defendants have cited two cases in which the indictment was dismisses, however, one was dismissed on grounds other 
than vagueness, United States v. Braniff Airways, Inc., 428 F. Supp. 579 (W.D. Tex. 1977) and one is clearly distinguishable on 
the facts, United States v. Wayne Pump Co., 44 F. Supp. 949 (N.D. Ill.), appeal dismissed, 317 U.S. 200 (1942). "
621,6," ""Defendants"" used in relation to the December 2 letter refers only to defendants Rubbish Removal, Inc. and L. Michael Blumin."
621,7," The government reasons that Rule 11(e)(6) is identical to Fed. R. Evid. 410, and pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 1101(d)(2), the 
Federal Rules of Evidence are not applicable to grant jury proceedings; thus it follows that Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(e)(d) is also not 
applicable to grand jury proceedings.  In support of this contention the government cites United States v. Callahan, nom. United 
States v. Larson, 596 F. 2d 759 (8th Cir. 1979) wherein the court held that there was no violation in the government informing 
the grand jury that the defendant failed a polygraph test even though that information would be inadmissible at trial. "
623,8," The defendants urge that the government should have presented the following evidence to the grand jury: (1) Federal Bureau 
of Investigation [""F.B.I.""] questionnaires and responses thereto by defendants' customers; (2) the December 9 letter; and (3) a 
tape recording of a conversation that took place on or about December 2, 1981 between Thomas O'Connor, Sr. and George 
Smith.  Defendant Maggio also contends that the government should have questioned certain witnesses about Maggio's failure 
to attend conspiratorial meetings and should have presented memoranda of facts prepared by Mr. Maggio's attorney. The affidavit of the government prosecutor indicates that the O'Connor-Smith tape was played in full to the grand jury, that the 
witnesses were questioned about Mr. Maggio's involvement in the conspiracy, and that Maggio's memoranda of facts were 
presented to the grand jury. The O'Connor-Smith tape contained numerous instances of switching, and the December 2 letter 
lists customers that defendant Rubbish Removal allegedly ""took"" from other defendants.  In addition, the memoranda submitted 
by Mr. Maggio contained information about switching. Thus, even though evidence purporting to show switching does not negate 
the existence of an anticompetitive conspiracy, such evidence was presented to the grand jury. "
628,1," Plaintiff suggests that application of the Local Government Antitrust Act to this case may be constitutionally infirm as retroactive 
legislation. Analysis of the constitutionality of the retroactive application of a statute begins with the proposition ""that a court is to 
apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision, unless doing so would result in manifest injustice or there is a statutory 
direction or legislative history to the contrary."" Bradley v. School Bd. of City of Richmond, 416 U.S. at 711. The thrust of the 
analysis in this opinion is that it would be inequitable and hence unjust not to apply the Local Government Antitrust Act's 
immunities in this case. Moreover, the mandate that such actions be applied to pending cases is clearly laid out in the text of the "
629,," Act. See also Jefferson Disposal Co. v. Parrish of Jefferson, Louisiana, 1985-1 Trade Cas. (CCH), para. 66,471 at 65, 362-4 
(E.D. La. March 5, 1985). "
630,2," The colloquies between Congressmen Crane and Hyde and Congressmen Seiberling and Rodino provide guidance as to 
factors which should be considered in determining the applicability of section 3(a) exemptions. 130 Cong. Rec. at 12186-7. 
Congressmen Hyde, Seiberling and Rodino were all floor managers for the Local Government Antitrust Act. Their statements 
during the course of debate are particularly useful in gauging legislative intent. See, e.g., Johansen v. United States, 343 U.S. 
427, 437, 96 L. Ed. 1051, 72 S. Ct. 849 (1952). In the Senate, however, another of the floor managers was more adamant as to the import of the enumerated factors of stage of 
litigation and availability of alternative relief. Senator Metzenbaum stated: I want to make one thing crystal clear for the record about a central aspect of this conference report. We found ourselves hung up on the whole question of what happens to pending cases. A number of Senators felt quite strongly that a plaintiff who has won a jury verdict should not have that verdict taken away 
by intervening legislation - others disagreed. The Senate language which was accepted by the conferees, reflects hard fought, difficult negotiations among Senators. At the conference, the House suggested that additional factors, such as the financial impact on a city, be included. These 
suggestions were rejected by the Senate conferees. I want to say as loudly and as clearly as it is possible to say, as one of those who was intimately involved in these 
negotiations, that this Senator cannot change what the conferees agreed upon. No other Senator can change what the 
conferees agreed upon. No statement made upon the House floor can change what the conferees agreed upon. House 
Members who came to the conference and who made certain proposals and who were rejected in connection with those 
proposals have now spoken on the floor of the House, attempting to add some new interpretation. None of those House Members and none of us here in the Senate have the authority, have the strength, have the legal 
right to change the legal effect of what the conferees concluded in their language, nor can we change the statement of the 
managers. Only the statement of the managers accurately reflects the congressional intent in this area, and there is no way 
of changing that."
630,130," Cong. Rec S14368 (daily ed. October 11, 1984) (statement of Sen.  Metzenbaum). Contrary to plaintiff's suggestion, 
Senator Metzenbaum's remarks do not eradicate the plain language of the statute directing that all circumstances be considered 
and enumerating some, but not all, of the relevant factors. The Senator's statement does, however, help to emphasize the 
relative importance of the specifically delineated factors. "
631,3," Certainly, the liability of the Town of Mt. Crested Butte could be offset by contribution from other conspirators. But as noted 
earlier, each defendant is severally liable for any damage award under the Clayton Act. "
637,*," The Honorable James E. Doyle, Senior Judge of the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, is sitting 
by designation. "
638,1,"  A flat rate is a local rate of one or more carriers. A proportional rate is a portion of the through rate based on a percentage 
and/or differential over or under the Chicago to New York rate. Proportional rates are generally lower than flat rates 
between the same points.  Board of Trade of City of Chicago v. ICC, 646 F.2d 1187, 1189 (7th Cir. 1981)."
638,2," For a thorough discussion of the distinction between proportional and flat rates, and the history of the railroad rate structure in 
the central Midwest region, see Board of Trade of City of Chicago v. ICC, 646 F.2d 1187, 1189 (7th Cir. 1981). "
639,3," The district court ruled on other motions by the parties for summary judgment in its opinion in this case. The court denied 
defendants' motion for summary judgment on the basis of the exclusive jurisdiction of the ICC, reasoning that the time for 
appealing the ICC decision had expired and that the antitrust laws protect rights collateral to those protected by the ICA. The 
district court also rejected the defendants' argument that because certain shippers had elected to pursue the ICC remedy of 
damages they were barred from seeking damages under the antitrust laws. The court found that the shippers had not in fact 
elected their remedy because not all of the shippers requested reparations from the ICC. It appears that some shippers may 
have alluded to reparations. The ICC itself was ""unclear"" as to who had requested reparations, but ruled that none were 
appropriate. The district court also granted the shippers' motion to strike the carriers' Noerr-Pennington affirmative defense on 
the ground that the filing of a tariff itself cannot be a ""petition"" to the government. The court also granted the shippers' motion in 
limine that the carriers' conduct be deemed per se illegal since it is not exempt from the antitrust laws. Finally, the court denied 
the carriers' motion to hold the shippers collaterally estopped to seek damages in this action because the ICC had determined 
that the shippers had suffered no injury. First, the court found that not all shippers in this suit had participated in the ICC 
proceeding. Second, the court held that, even to the extent that shippers had participated, the ICC was not empowered to define 
antitrust injury and, therefore, a different issue was before the district court than had been before the ICC. The parties, however, 
do not challenge these decisions of the district court with the exception of Pillsbury, who challenges the court's holding with 
regard to the election of remedies. Because of our holding on implied immunity, it is not necessary to discuss this portion of the 
district court's order."
639,4," HN1[
] The Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. ยง 10706(a) (2) (A) provides: A rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission . . . that is a party to

making or carrying out the agreement. "
657,1," We also note that Professor Areeda's law review article which apparently influenced much of the Brunswick analysis, see, e.g., 
429 U.S. at 487 n.11, recognized potential differences between antitrust standing analysis in claims for section 4 damages and 
claims for a section 16 injunction. See Areeda, Antitrust Violations Without Damage Recoveries, 89 Harv. L. Rev. 1127, 1139 
(1976) (denying standing to section 4 plaintiffs ""does not leave society remediless, however, as both private equitable relief and 
government action are available.""); see also II P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law para. 335e at 176 (1978) (noting important 
differences between section 4 damage actions and section 16 injunctive actions); L. Sullivan, Antitrust ยง 247 at 772 (1977) 
(noting lower threshold for section 16 actions because loss must only be threatened."
657,2," Section 16 specifically refers to common law standards for equitable relief. Excel has not specifically objected to the district 
court's finding that Monfort satisfied section 16's requirements for impending harm. See 591 F. Supp. at 709-10. Excel does 
object to some of the fact findings supporting the injunction and we dispose of those objections in Section II, infra. But Monfort's 
allegations in its brief that it satisfied the requirements of section 16 are not answered or specifically denied in Excel's reply brief. The Sixth Circuit applied section 16 standards to determine the propriety of a preliminary injunction in a competitor's challenge to 
a merger when it, like we, concluded that the competitor had standing because causation between the antitrust violation and the 
injury had been shown. See Christian Schmidt Brewing Co., 753 F.2d at 1356, 1358. We think it is more productive for courts to "
658,," focus their efforts on section 16's judicially ascertainable prerequisites to relief rather than be forced to delve into the merits to 
determine standing, a task that should be a threshold inquiry."
658,3," One possible argument against Monfort having antitrust standing here is that the harm it may suffer from the reopening of 
Spencer Beef's Schuyler plant would occur regardless of which parent company reopened the plant. This, of course, was the 
basis for the Supreme Court's dismissal of the Brunswick claims. See 429 U.S. at 487. Monfort's alleged harm goes beyond the 
rejuvenation of the Schuyler plant, however. Monfort is concerned with potential predatory operation of all Spencer Beef and 
Excel plants, all but one of which are currently in use. It is claiming that additional market power would give these plants coercive 
strength that they previously lacked even when operating at full capacity."
658,4," This talismanic language is unhelpful here as it readily appears that Monfort's harm as a competitor may be a subset of the 
overall harm to competition. We are not prepared to dismiss every case that presents harm to specific competitors. Indeed, we 
are looking for such harm as part of our standing inquiry. "
659,5," Monfort could argue that it would be hurt by Excel's price leadership even if it continues in business because it would be 
coerced from vigorously competing in a way that might expand its own market share. We are satisfied, however, that Monfort 
would reap substantial profits at least in the short term from an interdependent price structure because it and other firms could 
charge supracompetitive prices."
659,6," The Justice Department filed its amicus brief in support of General Motors' motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of standing 
in Chrysler Corp. v. General Motors Corp., No. 84-115 (D.D.C.). The district court ultimately denied the motion to dismiss.  589 
F. Supp. 1182, 1187-94 (D.D.C. 1984). "
660,7," Our decision in Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco, Inc., No. 84-1169 (10th Cir. Feb. 9, 1984), 1984-1 Trade Cas. para. 65,896, is not to 
the contrary. In that case Pennzoil sought to enjoin Texaco's merger with Getty Oil. The court affirmed the district court's denial 
of injunctive relief, but the decision was not based on any judgment as to plaintiff's antitrust standing. The court was simply 
analyzing whether plaintiff had satisfied the traditional requirements for injunctive relief such as a showing of a substantial 
likelihood of success on the merits; proof of irreparable harm; proof that the threatened injury outweighs the damage that an 
injunction would cause; and a showing that the injunction would not harm the public interest. These equitable concerns enter the 
analysis in a case such as the one we face here. But the court considers them at the stage when it determines whether a section 
16 injunction is warranted for the section 7 violation; this occurs only after a plaintiff has met the causation requirement for 
antitrust standing. In other section 7 cases courts have appeared to approve competitor antitrust standing. See Arthur S. Langenderfer, Inc. v. S.E. 
Johnson Co., 729 F.2d 1050, 1058 (6th Cir. 1984) (plaintiff seeking both treble damages and injunctive relief), cert. denied, 469 
U.S. 1036, 105 S. Ct. 510, 83 L. Ed. 2d 401, 53 U.S.L.W. 3403 (1984); In re Japanese Electronic Products Antitrust Litigation, 
723 F.2d 238, 318-19 (3d Cir. 1983) (reversing trial court's denial of antitrust standing for claims seeking both treble damages 
and injunctive relief), cert. granted, 471 U.S. 1002, 85 L. Ed. 2d 157, 105 S. Ct. 1863, 53 U.S.L.W. 3702 (1985). The vast 
majority of appellate cases concerning the antitrust standing of competitors in section 7 cases involve either the special 
problems of claims for treble damages, see, e.g., A.D.M. Corp. v. Sigma Instruments, Inc., 628 F.2d 753 (1st Cir. 1980) (per 
curiam); Purex Corp. v. Procter & Gamble Co., 596 F.2d 881 (9th Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 983, 72 L. Ed. 2d 861, 102 
S. Ct. 2256 (1982); or a vertical relationship between companies, see Heatransfer Corp. v. Volkswagenwerk, A.G., 553 F.2d 964 
(5th Cir. 1977) (claim for damages), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1087, 98 S. Ct. 1282, 55 L. Ed. 2d 792 (1978). "
661,8," Fed cattle are steers and heifers that have been fattened in a commercial feedlot for a period of 100 to 140 days.  591 F. Supp.

Appellants' Brief at 38. "
662,12," Excel bolsters its argument that large capital costs do not present barriers to entry by citing the Areeda-Turner treatise. Yet 
Excel's quotation selectively ignores the context, in which the treatise authors do conclude that capital costs may comprise 
barriers to entry. See II P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law para. 409e at 303-05 (1978). "
664,13," The December 1, 1983, order provided that: ""ORDER IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that defendants Excel Corporation and Cargill, Inc. are PERMANENTLY ENJOINED from 
consummating the proposed acquisition between Excel Corporation, Cargill, Inc., and the Spencer Beef Division of Land 
O'Lakes, Inc. The defendants are further ENJOINED from undertaking any plan or entering into any agreement, the effect 
of which would be to allow the acquisition, merger, consolidation, operation or in any other way permit the combination of 
the ownership or operation of the beef packing businesses of defendants and the Spencer Beef Division of Land O'Lakes, 
Inc. Judgment will enter for Plaintiff Monfort of Colorado on its claim for injunctive relief. . . ."" "
664,591, F. Supp. at 710-11.
664,14," Excel advances a worthy purpose argument claiming that by purchasing only the Oakland plant it enabled Spencer Beef to 
reopen the Schuyler plant. This argument is as irrelevant here as it is to a determination of whether a section 7 violation 
occurred. "
671,*," Honorable Seybourn H. Lynne, U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of Alabama, sitting by designation. "
672,1," Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.A. ยง 15 (Supp.1980) provides in relevant part: ""Any person who shall be injured in his

673,3, Amey argues that it at least has standing to sue for injunctive relief. 
675,4," The First Circuit has yet to harmonize Blue Shield and Associated General Contractors. The only treatment of those two cases 
has been in the context of standing to sue for injunctive relief.  See e.g., Kartell v. Blue Shield of Massachusetts, 582 F. Supp. 
734 (D.Mass.1984) (applying the Associated General factors by analogy to hold that doctors did not have standing to obtain an 
injunction against restraint of trade in the prepaid health care market and distinguishing Blue Shield on its facts). One panel of the Second Circuit has aligned itself with the liberal standing approach of Blue Shield and distinguished Associated 
General as not limiting the application of Blue Shield.  See Crimpers Promotions, Inc. v. Home Box Office, 724 F.2d 290 (2d 
Cir.1984) (""Associated General indicates no departure from McCready in any fashion pertinent to this case""). One panel in the Third Circuit has reaffirmed that Circuit's adherence to balancing the policies of the Clayton Act to decide the 
standing question instead of relying on the specific prescriptions of either Blue Shield or Associated General.  See Merican, Inc. 
v. Caterpillar Tractor Co., 713 F.2d 958 (1984) (weighing the policies against double recovery and overly-complex damage 
claims in holding that an unauthorized dealer who purchased from an authorized dealer does not have standing to sue the 
manufacturer for treble damages). The Fourth Circuit has yet to harmonize Blue Shield and Associated General, and, therefore, continues to employ the 
foreseeable target area approach of its decisions in Blue Shield v. McCready, 649 F.2d 228 (4th Cir.1981), Ratliff v. Burney, 657 
F.2d 640 (4th Cir.1981), and South Carolina Council of Milk Producers v. Newton, 360 F.2d 414 (4th Cir.1966). The Sixth Circuit has abandoned its reliance on the zone of interests test and adopted the Associated General factors test to 
determine standing.  See Southaven Land Co. v. Malone & Hyde, Inc., 715 F.2d 1079 (6th Cir.1983) (lessor of commercial 
premises did not have standing to sue a lessee for anti-competitive conduct where diminished consumer interest and activity at 
lessor's shopping area was unrelated to the anti-competitive activity) and Goldberg, Inc. v. Goldberg, 717 F.2d 290 (6th 
Cir.1983) (shareholder does not have standing to bring an antitrust suit against a third party for injuries to his interest in the 
corporation). The Seventh Circuit has yet to resolve the Supreme Court cases.  As a result, the target area approach remains as the generally 
accepted measure of standing in that circuit.  See Note, 61 Wash.U.L.Q. at 1093-94. The approach of Associated General has been squarely adopted by the Eighth Circuit.  See McDonald v. Johnson & Johnson, 
722 F.2d 1370, 1371 (8th Cir.1983) (enumerating the Associated General factors). The treatment given Associated General by the Ninth Circuit has been inconsistent. In Chelson v. Oregonian Publishing Co., [715 F.2d 1368 (9th Cir.1983)] the court of appeals purported to apply the 
Associated General analysis, but couched its discussion solely in terms of antitrust injury.  The court allowed news dealers 
to sue their publisher for requiring exclusive dealing agreement as a condition of news distribution. In Park v. Watson, "
676,," however, the court of appeals read Associated General as supplementing the foreseeable target area test.  These 
divergent readings of Associated General provide no consistent guidelines for antitrust standing in the Ninth Circuit.  Note, 61 Wash.U.L.Q. at 1098. See also Solinger v. A. & M. Records, Inc., 718 F.2d 298 (9th Cir.1983) (prospective shareholder 
of an injured corporation does not have standing). The Tenth Circuit has yet to address standing in light of the competing policies and factors of Blue Shield and Associated 
General.  See generally Note, 61 Wash.U.L.Q. at 1098-99."
676,5," In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), this circuit adopted the case law of the former Fifth 
Circuit handed down as of September 30, 1981.  Bonner, 661 F.2d at 1209. Cf.  Stein v. Reynolds Securities, Inc., 667 F.2d 33 
(11th Cir.1982) (adopting as binding precedent all post-September 30, 1981, decisions of Unit B of former Fifth Circuit). "
678,6," Amey gives little weight to precedent established by the former Fifth Circuit decisions and the specific adherence of this circuit 
to those decisions.  Blue Shield does not limit the application of the target area test of antitrust standing.  See Construction 
Aggregate Transport, 710 F.2d at 765-66."
678,7," In its alternate holding that Amey did not have standing, the district court implicitly determined that Amey was not within the 
market endangered by the alleged antitrust conduct. The court agreed with the banks and law firms that the only market relevant 
to the standing inquiry was that of the providers of title services and the direct consumers of those services.  As such, the court "
679,," found, those with standing to redress the alleged antitrust violations by the appellants in this case, would be other attorneys in 
the Lee County area who desire to engage in the provision of title service work to the conspiring banks.  The court relied on 
Illinois Brick. We do not view Illinois Brick as controlling. "
680,8," Proof that Amey actually paid a higher price or was required to pay a higher price by Lee County Bank is not necessary for a 
determination of standing.  Preliminary litigation over these threshold questions would in effect be a trial on the merits.  See 
Construction Aggregate Transport, 710 F.2d at 763 n. 24. "
685,9," Title 28 U.S.C.A. ยง 1927 provides: HN15[
] Any attorney or other person admitted to conduct cases in any court of the United States or any territory thereof 
who so multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously may be required by the court to satisfy 
personally the excess costs, expenses, and attorneys fees reasonably incurred because of such conduct. Fla.Stat. ยง 57.105 provides: HN16[
] The court shall award a reasonable attorney's fee to the prevailing party in any civil action in which the court finds 
that there was a complete absence of a justiciable issue of either law or fact raised by the losing party. "
688,10," The identity of the persons and parties to the action is easily satisfied on these facts.  Henderson was the defendant in the first 
action and is also the major defendant in the second action, since without the services of Henderson, Amey would not have 
suffered its alleged injury.  Similarly, parties in the second action have maintained a similar identity of capacity as those in the 
first action: Amey was the mortgagor in both actions and the first action had as defendants the Henderson law firm, while the 
second action has as defendants law firms and banks providing mortgage financing. "
694,1, Interior no longer serves as a manufacturer's representative for Hiebert in the Minneapolis area.
694,2, Ketcham left Interior in April of 1983 to form Northern.
694,3," Pink also alleges a violation of Minnesota's antitrust laws, Minn.  Stat. ยงยง 325D.51; 325D.53, and violation of Hiebert's 
contractual obligation to keep Pink as a dealer as long as Pink performed satisfactorily. "
695,4," The Court will occasionally refer to these four defendants as the ""agent defendants."" "
696,5," Green made no reference to International Travel Arrangers, which in turn made no reference to Morton Buildings. "
697,6," Examples of nonprice restrictions are a manufacturer limiting the territory in which a dealer can sell, or limiting the customers to 
whom a dealer can sell."
697,7," HN7[
] The ""rule of reason"" involves a weighing of relevant factors in each case to determine if a restrictive practice is an 
unreasonable restraint on competition.  Monsanto, 104 S. Ct. at 1469. "
698,8," Citations to a name followed by numbers refer to a deposition and its relevant pages. A name followed by an exhibit number 
denotes a deposition exhibit."
698,9," See, e.g., (Doyle 24; Loomis 20-21; Pitra 9; Prindle 13; Ritchie 17; Ruter 39-41; Venero 20)."
698,10," ""Spec."" is slang for specification. In the office furniture business, customers can ""specify"" a particular brand of office furniture 
in their orders. Also a furniture distributor may be said to have a ""spec.,"" e.g., a Dayton's ""spec.,"" if it convinced the customer to 
specify a certain line of furniture. "
699,11," Nonprice vertical restraints, such as customer restrictions, must be unreasonable before they constitute antitrust violations.  
Monsanto, 104 S. Ct. at 1469. Plaintiff does not, however, argue in its brief that defendants violated the Sherman Act via 
nonprice restraints. If plaintiff was going to assert such a theory, plaintiff would ultimately have to demonstrate that the nonprice 
restraints were unreasonable. Defendants repeatedly try to characterize their actions as, at worst, nonprice or customer 
restraints. In light of plaintiff's position, if defendants' actions only amounted to nonprice or customer restraints, defendants 
would not be liable to plaintiff for Sherman Act violations. "
700,12, Metro is the dealer which replaced plaintiff. 
702,13," Defendants argue that even if Pitra can testify to Brion's statement, the statement makes no reference to price. Defendants 
are correct, but other evidence has shown that plaintiff's pricing may have been a factor causing Hiebert to terminate plaintiff's 
dealership. Thus, if plaintiff had admissible evidence of any type of concerted action, that evidence coupled with the other 
evidence of Hiebert's concern over plaintiff's pricing, might support a reasonable inference of a vertical price-fixing conspiracy. "
703,14," Plaintiff apparently has abandoned its claim of an illegal boycott conspiracy, Count II of plaintiff's complaint. Plaintiff's only 
reference to this claim was a footnote in its brief which stated that the same evidence which establishes plaintiff's price-fixing 
claim also establishes plaintiff's illegal boycott claim. Because plaintiff's evidence cannot support a reasonable inference of the 
former, it cannot support a reasonable inference of the latter."
703,15," The Court need not decide the question of whether plaintiff could use its federal antitrust claims as defenses to Hiebert's 
counterclaim if those claims had survived summary judgment. See Kelly v. Kosuga, 358 U.S. 516, 520, 3 L. Ed. 2d 475, 79 S. 
Ct. 429 (1959); Bruce's Juices, Inc. v. American Can Co., 330 U.S. 743, 755, 91 L. Ed. 1219, 67 S. Ct. 1015 (1947). "
706,1," This action is but one of several in the federal courts arising out of the merger and reorganization of Durham Hosiery Mills, Inc. 
In White v. Durham Hosiery Mills, Inc., 753 F.2d 1072 (4th Cir. 1985), another panel of this Court affirmed a jury verdict awarding 
a former minority shareholder compensatory damages of $25,900 and punitive damages of $50,000 on his action for 
misrepresentation under Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R. ยง 240.10b-5 (1983). Two actions brought by five other shareholders are 
presently pending in the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina. See Umstead v. Durham Hosiery 
Mills, Inc., 578 F. Supp. 342 (M.D.N.C. 1984); Teer v. Durham Hosiery Mills, Inc., 592 F. Supp. 1269. "
707,2," On January 9, 1981, plaintiff Lindner filed a complaint in the district court for the Western District of Virginia for the purpose of 
obtaining an injunction to postpone the shareholder meeting scheduled for January 12. On the morning of January 12, however, 
the district court concluded that Lindner had failed to show any irreparable injury from the holding of the meeting and the merger 
due to the availability of his appraisal remedy under state law. "
709,3," But see Hickey v. Howard, 598 F. Supp. 1105 (D.Mass. 1984) (holding that Massachusetts statute proscribing unfair methods 
of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce, and providing for treble 
damages, is applicable to securities transactions); Mitchelson v. Aviation Simulation Technology, Inc., 582 F. Supp. 1 (D. Mass. 
1983) (same). However, two other judges in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts have held that this 
Massachusetts statute does not apply to securities transactions. See Moseley and Sweeney, infra."
709,4," This fact makes the instant case clearly distinguishable from ITCO Corp. v. Michelin Tire Corp., 722 F.2d 42 (4th Cir. 1983), 
and Bostic Oil Corp. v. Michelin Tire Corp., 702 F.2d 1207 (4th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 894, 104 S. Ct. 242, 78 L. Ed. 
2d 232 (1983). In those cases this court held that proof of conduct violative of ยง 1 of the Sherman Act is proof sufficient to 
establish a violation of the North Carolina and South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Acts. But a key to those decisions was this 
court's observation that ""it is an accepted tenet of basic antitrust law that ยง 5 of the [FTC] Act sweeps within its prohibitory 
scope conduct also condemned by ยง 1 of the Sherman Act."" ITCO, 722 F.2d at 48 (citing FTC v. Cement Institute, 333 U.S. 683, 
92 L. Ed. 1010, 68 S. Ct. 793 (1948); FTC v. Beech-Nut Packing Co., 257 U.S. 441, 66 L. Ed. 307, 42 S. Ct. 150 (1922)). "

Ltd., Naji Robert Nahas, Sheik Mohammed Aboud Al-Amoudi, Sheik Ali Bin Mussalem and Banque Populaire Suisse. The 
parties highlighted by an asterisk have not joined in the motion."
716,2," The complaint alleges that de Atucha purchased three silver contracts at $50 per ounce for a total cost of $1.5 million. This 
implies that his three contracts called for delivery of 30,000 ounces of silver. As traded on Comex or CBOT a silver futures 
contract calls for delivery of 5,000 ounces of silver per contract while an LME silver contract calls for delivery of 10,000 ounces. 
Therefore, although not directly stated in the complaint, it follows that plaintiff traded on the LME. This fact is not in dispute."
716,3," Liquidation is the sale of a contract by a person holding a long position or the purchase of a contract by a person holding a 
short position. See complaint at para. 24(f). For a helpful explanation of the nature of the commodity futures markets in general 
see Leist v. Simplot, 638 F.2d 283, 286-88 (2d Cir. 1980), aff'd sub nom.  Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith v. Curran, 456 
U.S. 353, 72 L. Ed. 2d 182, 102 S. Ct. 1825 (1982)."
716,4, A purchaser of a futures contracts holds a long position and a seller holds a short position. See complaint at para. 24(e).
716,5," It is questionable whether these facts, without more, are sufficient to state a claim against the exchange defendants. See Sam 
Wong & Son, Inc.  v. New York Mercantile Exchange, 735 F.2d 653, 671 (2d Cir. 1984); Bishop v. Commodity Exchange, Inc., 
564 F. Supp. 1557, 1562 (S.D.N.Y. 1983). However, we do not address this issue since the complaint is dismissed for lack of 
standing."
716,6," Although the complaint refers to LME contracts as ""futures contracts"" they are actually ""forward contracts"", which differ from 
futures contracts in several respects. See note 2, supra."
716,7," 7 U.S.C. ยง 13(b) 1982. Recent enactments to 7 U.S.C. ยง 13(b) in the Futures Trading Act of 1982, Pub. L. No. 97-444, ยง 
227(2), 96 Stat. 2316 (1983) do not have a direct bearing on de Atucha's claim because they have no retroactive effect. See 
note 30, infra. This is also true as to 7 U.S.C. ยงยง 6c, 7a(8). (Pub. L. No. 97-444, ยงยง 206, 216(1)."

717,11, 7 U.S.C. ยง 7(d).
717,12," For the purposes of the section of the opinion discussing the antitrust claims ""defendants"" refers to the moving non-exchange 
defendants. "
718,13," De Atucha also relies heavily upon Strax v. Commodity Exchange, Inc., 524 F. Supp. 936 (S.D.N.Y. 1981) and Pollock v. 
Citrus Associates, 512 F. Supp. 711 (S.D.N.Y. 1981) for the proposition that traders in the silver futures market who were 
damaged by the price manipulations brought about by defendants' anticompetitive conduct are entitled to recover damages 
under the antitrust laws. De Atucha's reliance on these cases is misplaced. The decisions are inapplicable to the instant action 
because in Strax and Pollock the plaintiffs traded on and were allegedly injured on United States Exchanges."
718,14," Unlike Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707, 97 S. Ct. 2061 (1977) and Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., 405 
U.S. 251, 31 L. Ed. 2d 184, 92 S. Ct. 885 (1972), the leading Supreme Court cases on the so called ""pass-on"" proposition, this is 
clearly not such a case. "
719,15," Justice Brennan analogized the remoteness inquiry to the analysis utilized by the courts to determine proximate cause. He 
remarked that the inquiry as to what constitutes an injury for antitrust purposes is ""no less elusive"" than the evaluation of 
proximate cause.  Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready, 457 U.S. at 477; accord Associated General Contractors of California v. 
California State Council, 459 U.S. at 535-37."
719,16," While the specific intent of the defendants is a factor to consider, the mere fact that the complaint alleges improper motive is 
not a ""panacea that will enable any complaint to withstand a motion to dismiss."" Associated General Contractors of California, 
Inc. v. California State Council, 459 U.S. at 537. Here, the statement in the complaint that the defendants deliberately 
manipulated all significant silver markets does not answer the question wether de Atucha has standing under the Clayton Act as 
a trader on the LME. See Id."
719,17," The price quoted for domestically refined copper by Kennecott Copper Corporation, Phelps Dodge Corporation and Anaconda 
Company, the defendants in Reading and the producers of ""approximately 60 percent of the refined copper used by the nation's 
copper fabricators."" Reading Industries, Inc.  v. Kennecott Copper Corporation, 631 F.2d at 11."
719,18," We recognize, of course, that Reading was decided before the Supreme Court's rulings in McCready and Associated General 
Contractors. Courts in this Circuit have been advised to follow the approaches taken by the Supreme Court ""without concern 
whether the results are consistent with language in earlier Second Circuit cases"".  Crimpers Promotions, Inc. v. Home Box 
Office, Inc., 724 F.2d at 293. However, the Court of Appeals also indicated that their prior decisions have not necessarily ""been 
drained of their precedential vitality on their own or very similar facts . . . ."" Id.  The Reading court's analysis of causation is 
based upon the same principles as the remoteness inquiry set forth in McCready and Associated General Contractors. This, in 
addition to the factual similarities between this case and Reading, lead us to conclude that Reading offers valid precedential 
guidance on the issue of standing. "
720,19," Defendants further argue that de Atucha is not in the target area of the violation because he and the defendants both held long 
positions in the market. De Atucha correctly points out decisions in which ""long"" plaintiffs were allowed to sue ""long"" defendants. 
E.g., Leist v. Simplot, 638 F.2d 283, 290-91 (2d Cir. 1980), aff'd, 456 U.S. 353, 102 S. Ct. 1825, 72 L. Ed. 2d 182 (1982). In 
considering de Atucha's market position vis-a-vis the defendants we do not hold that plaintiffs can never sue individuals on the 
same side of commodities contracts. As previously stated, the standing determination is to be made on a case by case basis. 
This is merely one factor we deem appropriate to consider here. HN3[
] "
721,20," Recently, Congress modified the Sherman Act to specifically limit jurisdiction over foreign conduct to cases in which the 
conduct has a ""direct, substantial and reasonably foreseeable effect"" on American commerce. Although the amendment is not 
applicable to the instant action (because it relates to jurisdiction, not standing, and also because we are not faced here with 
""foreign conduct""), the enactment does evidence a reaffirmation of the proposition that the Sherman Act is directed to the 
protection of American trade. Pub. L. No. 97-290, Title IV, ยง 402, 96 Stat. 1246 (1982). "
722,21," See, e.g., Strax v. Commodity Exchange Commission, 79 Civ. 5366(MEL) (S.D.N.Y. filed Oct. 12, 1979); Freemarket v.

U.S. 353, 395, 72 L. Ed. 2d 182, 102 S. Ct. 1825 (1982). It is unnecessary for us to decide whether de Atucha's alleged injuries 
were ""proximately caused"" by actions prohibited under the CEA since we have concluded that he lacks standing to sue. "

724,29," De Atucha argues, by analogy, that under Pfizer, Inc. v. Government of India, 434 U.S. 308, 54 L. Ed. 2d 563, 98 S. Ct. 584, a 
decision which held that foreign nations may sue under Section 4 of the Clayton Act, foreign residents may bring a cause of 
action under the CEA. Our decision should not be interpreted as precluding foreigners from bringing such suits. We hold merely 
that a foreigner who trades exclusively on a foreign exchange does not have standing under the Act."

a registered futures association, any transaction specified in subsection (a) of this section, in either case to the extent of

organization, or registered futures association or by any officer, director, governor, committee member, or employee to 
enforce any bylaw, rule, regulation, or resolution referred to in paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection, or (B) the taking of

726,32," 7 U.S.C. ยง 6(b) (CEA Section 4(b)) provides: (b) The Commission may adopt rules and regulations proscribing fraud and requiring minimum financial standards, the 
disclosure of risk, the filing of reports, the keeping of books and records, the safeguarding of customers' funds, and 
registration with the Commission by any person located in the United States, its territories or possessions, who engages in 
the offer or sale of any contract of sale of a commodity for future delivery that is made or to be made on or subject to the 
rules of a board of trade, exchange, or market located outside the United States, its territories or possessions. Such rules 
and regulations may impose different requirements for such persons depending upon the particular foreign board of trade, 
exchange, or market involved. No rule or regulation may be adopted by the Commission under this subsection that (1) 
requires Commission approval of any contract, rule, regulation, or action of any foreign board of trade, exchange, or 
market, or clearinghouse for such board of trade, exchange, or market, or (2) governs in any way any rule or contract term 
or action of any foreign board of trade, exchange, or market, or clearinghouse for such board of trade, exchange, or market."
726,33," Prior to the enactment of CEA Section 4(b), (7 U.S.C. ยง 6(b)), the CFTC adopted Regulation 30.02, 17 C.F.R. ยง 30.02 (1984), 
which allows the CFTC to regulate against the perpetration of fraud on American consumers who purchase foreign commodities 
contracts. See II P. JOHNSON, supra, ยง 5.42 at p. 329 (""But American residents have been solicited to trade in foreign futures, 
principally in London. To fill this perceived regulatory gap, the Commission adopted Regulation ยง 30.02 . . . ."") De Atucha argues 
he is covered by both CEA ยง 4(b) and Regulation ยง 30.02. However, de Atucha is not a United States citizen. Further, 
notwithstanding the fact that Merrill Lynch's principal office may be located in the United States, the fact remains that de Atucha 
purchased his LME contracts from Merrill Lynch in Argentina, which is not ""located in the United States, its territories or 
possessions"" as Section 4(b) requires. "
727,34," De Atucha argues that he should not be barred from bringing an action under the CEA because it was Merrill Lynch, his 
broker, who made the decision to trade his commodities account on the LME rather than a United States exchange. Affidavits 
submitted in support and in opposition to the motion reveal there is a factual dispute as to (1) whether de Atucha's account was 
a ""discretionary"" one and (2) who made the decision to trade it on the LME. Compare, e.g., Affidavit of Jose Maria Malbran (filed 
June 10, 1983) with Affidavit of Jorge M.C.C. de Atucha (filed June 22, 1983).  Resolution of this dispute is not essential to 
disposal of the motion.  Whether de Atucha specifically instructed Merrill Lynch to trade on the LME or whether he left the 
decision regarding which exchange to trade on to his broker's discretion does not alter the fact which we find dispositive, namely, 
that the market he ultimately traded on is one that is not regulated by the CEA. Moreover, we accept the proposition that one 
goal of strict regulation of United States commodities is to provide incentive to foreigners to trade here. See Alpa S.A. 
Agroindustrial Alemano v. ACLI International Inc., 573 F. Supp. 1070, 1076 (S.D.N.Y. 1983) (""The way to encourage foreign 
traders to trade on the Chicago futures market, rather than on foreign markets, is to maintain a regulated market with standards 
of care imposed on commission merchants like ACLI as well as on the exchanges themselves. These standards should be 
applied as long as the actual trade is made on a United States exchange . . . ."") To allow recovery under the CEA based upon 
trading on foreign markets would eradicate this inducement to foreign traders. Moreover, it would be inconsistent with a 
congressional purpose of increased economic growth on United States commodities markets."
727,35," Nor, as plaintiff argues, does our decision in Strax v. Commodity Exchange, 524 F. Supp. 936 (S.D.N.Y. 1981) (Lasker, J.) 
compel an opposite result. Although we left open the question as to whether a trader who trades on one United States exchange 
may hold both United States exchanges liable, Id. at 942 n.13, Strax certainly did not hold that a foreign trader on a foreign 
exchange has standing under the CEA to sue the United States exchanges. "
728,36," Although most of the cases upon which plaintiff relies discuss jurisdiction and not standing, to the extent that the decisions 
provide analogous authority we find them to support the conclusion that de Atucha lacks standing. For example, in CFTC v. 
Muller, 570 F.2d 1296 (5th Cir. 1978), the Fifth Circuit relied upon a Second Circuit opinion, British American Commodity 
Options Corp v. Bagley, 552 F.2d 482 (2d Cir.), cert.  denied, 434 U.S. 938, 54 L. Ed. 2d 297, 98 S. Ct. 427 (1977), to hold that 
the CFTC has jurisdiction to regulate the sale of London Commodity options sold in the United States, and in Psimenos v. E.F. 
Hutton & Co., 722 F.2d 1041 (2d Cir. 1983), the Second Circuit recently held that trading on United States commodities markets 
was enough to sustain jurisdiction. "
742,1," Mr. Stone is a lawyer and sometime consumer advocate who formerly served as Assistant District Attorney in New York 
County, Chief of the Criminal Court Bureau of that office and Judge of the Criminal Court of the City of New York. "
743,2," It is because of, not despite, our belief in deference to the discretion of the district court that we have referred to the record in 
explanation of the district court's finding that class representation was adequate, given the district court's rather sketchy 
treatment of client-counsel relations that many, at first glance, would find suspect. Cf.  Susman, 561 F.2d at 93 (noting that ""the 
notion that the appearance of conduct is as important as the conduct itself is a predicate for the Code of Professional 
Responsibility""). "
744,3," We find, however, not altogether irrefutable the district court's conclusion that comparing loss ratios could not serve as a 
method of determining damages in this case. Prudential's willingness to utilize a loss ratio over 14% lower than CPG's average 
previous loss ratio obviously reflects a commitment prospective in nature, and to that extent is irrelevant to proof of damages 
here. It is possible, however, that the Prudential loss ratio was not determined whimsically but was projected from data that 
would form much of the factual basis for the antitrust claims at issue here. A demonstration, however, of the extent to which 
Prudential's determination of a loss ratio might reveal a method of structuring what to lay persons seems an intimidating mass of 
data was a task for appellants, not the district court -- a task appellants failed to perform. We emphasize the difference between 
supporting a claim for the relevance of data and supporting a claim on the basis of specific data. Because appellants failed to do 
the former, the district court was well within its discretion to discount the prospect of the latter. Similarly, we can agree with the district court that a theory of unjust enrichment is inappropriate in proving damages for an 
antitrust violation, 588 F. Supp. at 1056-57, without rejecting the possibility that, as in Zeller v. Bogue Elec. Mfg. Co., 476 F.2d 
795, 802 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 908, 38 L. Ed. 2d 146, 94 S. Ct. 217 (1973), CPG's excess gain might be found the "
745,," most effective way to measure plaintiffs' loss. But appellants' inability to justify advancing litigation to a stage where that issue 
would emerge makes the point moot."
745,4," In light of Judge Mansfield's vigorous dissenting opinion, we wish to make it clear that we view the viability of class claims for 
damages solely from the standpoint that they are claims for federal antitrust violations and lost advertising revenues. As such for 
damage purposes we agree with the district judge that the claims had no viability and rather than be ""potentially worth many 
millions of dollars,"" as Judge Mansfield suggests, and as our first opinion thought possible, it had no worth. This is not to express 
any opinion on the value, if any, of the state claims, as we say in the text at 3761. Moreover, it is not as if no monetary recovery 
were obtained in the settlement; as we pointed out, CPG agreed in the ""voluntary"" agreement of September 1980 to pay the 
Associations a total of $6.86 million and to spend an additional $4.5 million to promote membership in the Associations. "
747,5," It may be, as Judge Mansfield suggests, that it would be wise not to have the subject of attorneys' fees agreed upon but ""be left 
to the court for determination after its independent review and approval of a settlement. . . ."" (dissenting op., at 909). But where, 
as here, the amount of the fees is important to the party paying them, as well as to the attorney recipient, it seems to the author "
748,," of this opinion that an agreement ""not to oppose"" an application for fees up to a point is essential to completion of the settlement, 
because the defendants want to know their total maximum exposure and the plaintiffs do not want to be sandbagged. It is 
difficult to see how this could be left entirely to the court for determination after the settlement. I note with interest Judge Newman's doubts about a defendant's ""clear sailing"" clause and the distinction that he draws between 
such a clause and a plaintiff's ""ceiling"" clause. In my view, as a practical matter, I believe it a distinction without a difference."
748,6," According to the terms of the settlement, the defendants are not to oppose plaintiffs' application for attorneys' fees and 
expenses not in excess of $2.325 million. Of those fees and expenses not in excess of $1 million, CPG is to pay 90% and the 
Associations the remaining 10%. Of any fees and expenses in excess of $1 million, CPG is to pay 70% and the Associations the 
remaining 30%. The plaintiffs did in fact apply to the state court referee, as well as to the district court, for the full $2.325 million, 
and both the referee and the district court approved the application, the district court approving the application again on remand, 
588 F. Supp. at 1061."
748,7," In the previous appeal, we incorrectly describe the magnitude of the bonus approved by the referee and the district court as 
applying a multiplier of two to the average hourly rate of $120. The district court informs us, 588 F. Supp. at 1059, that a 
multiplier of 1.685 more accurately reflects the bonus over the average hourly rate, given the 10,282.75 hours submitted by 
plaintiffs' co-counsel to justify an application for $2,085,901 in fees. "
749,8," We arrive at this figure by calculating, according to the agreed upon contribution formula, supra note 4, the Associations' share 
of plaintiffs' requested fee of $2,085,901 to be $425,700, and then reducing it by a divisor of 1.685. Because CPG's contribution 
is, of course, unaffected by the elimination of the multiplier as applied to the Associations' contribution, the effect of the foregoing 
modification is a reduction of plaintiffs' fee award from $2,085,901 to $1,912,814. The net result is that CPG's contribution to 
plaintiffs' fees remains at $1,660,131, while the Associations' contribution is reduced to $252,683."
749,1," The defendant would also want to ascertain the amount of the plaintiff's attorney's fee in the settlement of any case in which the 
plaintiff, whether or not representing a class, is entitled to recover an attorney's fee by virtue of a statute authorizing an 
attorney's fee to the prevailing party. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988 (1982). "
750,2," At least this is so whenever the plaintiffs propose a fee ceiling that they will not exceed, and the defendant gladly agrees to 
incorporate this assurance into the proposed settlement. The risk that a defendant will extract a concession from the class is 
also normally absent when the defendant holds out for a fee ceiling lower than that initially proposed by the plaintiffs. Perhaps, in 
some instances of the latter type, a defendant, bargaining about the fee ceiling, might suggest its willingness to accept a ceiling 
closer to the plaintiffs' demand if the plaintiffs will surrender some benefit unrelated to the fee. The occasional occurrence of this 
sort of bargaining about the amount of the ceiling is far less troublesome than the negotiation of a ""clear sailing"" clause, which 
always confers a benefit upon the plaintiffs and their counsel for which the defendant will always be tempted to demand 
something in return. "
751,1," In the present case, for instance, the court would also take into consideration the defendants' adoption in February 1979 of 
some salutary provisions beneficial to the class, which possibly had the effect of assuring class counsel that they were likely in 
any event to receive some award from the court. As the district court noted, ""the vigorous prosecution of these lawsuits was the 
principal cause, if not the sole cause, of the revisions in practice carried out by the Associations commencing in February 1979."" "
752,2," ""THE REFEREE: Mr. Rosditcher, how did this number come about, is what I would like to know? How did the number of 2.325 
million come about? Where did that come from? ""MR. ROSDITCHER: This was a negotiated figure. During the course of the settlement discussions, we were asked whether, 
among other things, as part of the settlement, we would agree not to oppose a fee of a certain size. And various numbers, I can't 
remember the progression of the numbers, but various numbers were discussed. ""THE REFEREE: Who discussed them, if I may ask? ""MR. ROSDITCHER: I discussed them with Mr. Lesch. Mr. Kalmus discussed them with Mr. Lesch. Mr. Malchman and Mr. 
Kaufman, I believe, were also involved in discussions. Mr. Belnick was involved in discussions. And a partner of mine, Arthur 
Kalish, and at one point, one of my senior partners, Morris Abram, had been in one early discussion."" (Suppl. App. 2-3). 
(Emphasis supplied)."
752,3," ""THE REFEREE: How long did these negotiations or discussions ensue? Over what period of time? ""MR. ROSDITCHER: I would say there were two periods, and correct me if my memory is inaccurate, there were two periods of 
settlement discussion. There was a period which went back, I suppose, to, was it late 1978? ""MR. BELNICK: Yes. ""MR. LESCH: In about February, 1979. ""MR. KALMUS: Which came to nothing. ""MR. ROSDITCHER: Which was the first discussion of settlement. It was at that time -- ""THE REFEREE: Settlement with reference to the counsel fees, I'm talking about specifically now. ""MR. ROSDITCHER: Both, the entire settlement and entire counsel fees. The Associations at that time had begun the process of effecting changes in the relationship and the structure of the Association, 
and so forth, that Mr. Lesch has been describing and described in his affidavit, at that time. And it was about that time that settlement discussions were first raised with any seriousness. My recollection is that at times, people have said, 'Is there any basis for settlement?' But it was nothing worth describing here. "
753,," And at that time [early 1979] we discussed both the form of a settlement and the question of fee was raised, as to whether we 
would be agreeable not to oppose a certain fee application. Now, I don't recall what amount was proposed. I believe that it was certainly in excess of the 2.3 million. ""MR. LESCH: So the record is clear, -- ""THE REFEREE: Let Mr. Rosditcher state it, and then you may have the opportunity. ""MR. LESCH: Excuse me. ""THE REFEREE: After Mr. Rosditcher, Mr. Kalmus will state it, and you will state it and anyone else. Go ahead. ""MR. ROSDITCHER: My recollection is there was an initial figure which was substantially in excess of 2.325 million dollars 
mentioned. ""THE REFEREE: Which was it, approximately? ""MR. ROSDITCHER: Which was approximately $4 million. ""THE REFEREE: When you say mentioned, mentioned by whom? ""MR. ROSDITCHER: Mentioned by plaintiffs' counsel. ""MR. LESCH: So the record is clear, you are talking about 1980? ""MR. ROSDITCHER: No, talking about 1979."" (Suppl. App. 3-5). (Emphasis supplied)."
753,4," ""MR. LESCH: . . . . First, on the question of fee negotiations, I do not believe that Mr. Fischman ever mentioned the figure of $4 million. What I believe happened was that benefits were discussed. And that in the context of the quantification of benefits, the inference 
was drawn that Mr. Fischman was talking about a fee of $4 million. My understanding is that the first time that that figure was mentioned occurred in negotiations between, and I don't believe it was 
4 million, I believe that the number I mentioned was somewhat in excess of 4 million. ""MR. KALMUS: I believe it was. 4 1/2. ""MR. ROSDITCHER: I think Mr. Lesch is correct in the way I first got the 4 million. ""MR. KALMUS: I would concur with Mr. Lesch. ""MR. ROSDITCHER: I derived the inference from the benefits they were describing. ""MR. LESCH: And that then we got into the negotiations and we started with the figure in excess of 4 million, and they started 
with a figure substantially below 2.325 million dollars."" (Rev. Suppl. App. 17-18). (Emphasis supplied)."
753,5," ""MR. ROSDITCHER: And we indicated, that is, the CPG and the Association defendants as well, we would not be agreeable to 
an agreement which said we would not oppose such a fee. ""THE REFEREE: Such a fee of $4 million? ""MR. ROSDITCHER: Yes. ""THE REFEREE: Very well. But did you come back with a counter-proposal with reference to the -- ""MR. ROSDITCHER: Not at that time, I think our feeling was it was too high, and didn't come back with any approval. I think at some point, shortly after those talks began, that is, within a month or two, they ended, and we then proceeded to full 
activity. "
754,," I think things got wound up and we went through a lot of discovery after that. The next period that I recall, the time is collapsing here. ""THE REFEREE: I realize that. ""MR. ROSDITCHER: Was it early in 1980 we began again? ""MR. KALMUS: In the latter part of 1979. ""MR. ROSDITCHER: The latter part of 1979, yes. ""MR. KALMUS: I first had some discussions then. I and Mr. Oberman, my partner, had discussions with Mr. Lesch and his 
partner, Mr. Fischman. And at times, with Mr. Malchman and Mr. Kaufman as well. ""THE REFEREE: With reference to counsel's fees? ""MR. KALMUS: No, not specifically; with reference to the possibility of settling the litigation either with the AARP defendants 
alone or the entire litigation as to everyone. Those discussions began in late 1979, continued into 1980, on and off, with adversary discovery going on concurrently. In due course, in the early spring, I would say, of 1980, or perhaps late winter of 1980, that is to say, a little less than a year ago, 
those discussions led to discussions in which Colonial Penn counsel, Mr. Rosditcher and his partner, Mr. Kalish, were also 
involved, that went on back and forth over an extended period of time into June of 1980. At that time, a framework of a settlement was agreed upon orally. That framework included an understanding that the 
defendants would not oppose an application for counsel fees up to $2.325 million, inclusive of disbursements. And from June through into the autumn of last year [1980], we worked on the details of a settlement agreement which resulted in 
the settlement agreement that you have before you dated November 3, 1980. ""THE REFEREE: Is that substantially what occurred, Mr. Rosditcher? ""MR. ROSDITCHER: That is substantially what occurred. Just to add to something that I said earlier, I do not recall that you asked how we got to this number. ""THE REFEREE: Yes. ""MR. ROSDITCHER: And I do recall that Mr. Lesch, I believe it was, told us precisely what he believed the total hours spent by 
his firm and the Kaufman firm were worth. And I believe the number mentioned at that time, this was probably in early 1980, was 
a million dollars. He also felt that the benefits he conferred justified a substantial multiple of that number. And I think that we then started -- said 4 million, and we said, 'No, that is too high.' And somehow, through the period in early 1980, we came to an agreement as to the number we would not oppose.""

763,5," Appellee does not dispute the existence of a differential between the prices of IBM and the third-party firms, but contends 
instead that the differential is irrelevant because CES has not shown how the price variance indicates the existence of a relevant 
submarket. While it is certainly true that a price differential is not necessarily dispositive in determining the interchangeability of 
products, see, e.g., Acme Precision Prods. v. American Alloys Corp., 484 F.2d 1237, 1242-43 (8th Cir. 1973), different prices are 
at least probative of the question whether different markets exist.  Moreover, while we agree that price differentials are not in and 
of themselves significant except insofar as they suggest the existence of different markets, appellee misperceives the allocation 
of burdens on its motion for summary judgment. CES has produced evidence tending to show, in light of the record as a whole, 
that the price differential bears on the cross-elasticity of demand between third-party's services and IBM's.  We cannot say, 
given the ad hoc significance of price differentials in determinations of relevant markets, that IBM's consistently higher prices do 
not suggest the existence of separate markets."

(2) calculated to cause damage to plaintiffs in their lawful business; (3) done with the unlawful purpose of causing damage 
and loss, without right or justifiable cause on the part of the defendant (which constitutes malice); and (4) actual damage 
and loss resulting.'"" White v. Larson, 586 S.W.2d 212, 215 (Tex.Civ.App.1979) (quoting Tidal Western Oil Corp. v. Shakelford, 297 S.W. 279, 280

addition to holding under the third element that Control Data's actions were justifiable -- a result with which we might differ 
absent any claim of contractual right by Control Data -- the district court noted that ""any 'interference' by defendant had no effect 
on plaintiff's right under these contracts; therefore, the essential element of actual damages or loss to plaintiff is missing from 
plaintiff's claims."" Supplemental Memorandum Opinion, No. 4-78-317-K, slip op. at 5 (N.D.Tex.1983).  Since we agree that CES

induced the contract's breach without any economic justification or goal other than evisceration of the underlying contract.  Id. at 
1195-96. In our case, it is clear that, even viewing the facts most favorably to CES, Control Data's alleged interference was 
aimed at least as much toward retrieving its previous clients as it was toward abrogating CES's contractual relations.  The Texas 
cases will not support a claim for tortious interference with contract under these circumstances. "

1 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law paras. 203-04 (1978 & Supp. 1982).  We find little support for the point, regardless of "
774,," which branch of ""sham"" is asserted.  See generally Coastal States, 694 F.2d at 1371 n. 42. Appellants have cited nothing in the 
record other than an allegation in their initial complaint that the defendants conspired to monopolize.  See Record vol. 4, at 832-
34.  To the contrary, appellants conceded in their main brief that ""[Yellow's] negotiations with respect to the subject exclusive 
concession agreement was [sic] undertaken at arm's length. . . ."" Brief for Appellant Arrow at 46; Brief for Appellant 
Independents at 45-46.  Thus, while the existence or nonexistence of sham-ful conduct is generally a question of fact for the 
jury, Feminist Women's Health Center v. Mohammad, 586 F.2d 530, 543 (5th Cir.1978), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 924, 100 S. Ct. 
262, 62 L. Ed. 2d 180 (1979), appellants have nonetheless failed to present enough evidence to survive Yellow's motion for 
summary judgment. Cf.  Metro Cable Co. v. CATV of Rockford, Inc., 516 F.2d 220, 228-32 (7th Cir.1975) (holding that 
agreement of government official to petitioning entity's anticompetitive plan was insufficient to render the official a ""co-
conspirator"" for purposes of undermining Noerr-Pennington immunity).  But cf.  Duke & Co., Inc. v. Foerster, 521 F.2d 1277, 
1282 (3d Cir.1975) (""Where the complaint goes beyond mere allegations of official persuasion by anticompetitive lobbying and 
claims official participation with private individuals in a scheme to restrain trade, the Noerr-Pennington doctrine is inapplicable.""). HN11[

774,10," As the facts of this case suggest, the Parker and Noerr-Pennington immunities are somewhat interrelated.  We need not 
consider, however, whether the private appellee would have prevailed with equal ease on summary judgment if the City had not 
been exempt under Parker. In large part, the two doctrines remain mutually independent both in origin and in application. "
785,1," True, the plaintiff must allege a conspiracy of some sort, but we know from our experience in the criminal law that such an 
allegation is easily made and proven. "

damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee."" "
796,1," The elements of a cause of action for an illegal tying arrangement are: 1) two products or services; 2) a requirement that the 
consumer purchase both the tying and tied product from the same source; 3) market power by the seller in the tying product or 
service; 4) a restraint on competition in the market for the tied product or service; and 5) a not insubstantial effect on interstate 
commerce.  Fortner Enterprises, Inc. v. United States Steel Corp., 394 U.S. 495, 22 L. Ed. 2d 495, 89 S. Ct. 1252 (1969)

800,2," These figures, provided by plaintiffs, do not include those at plaintiff Fullerton Memorial Hospital where, because of the death of 
plaintiff James C. Maly, surgery has all but stopped. Defendants' contention that the decline in surgery at this hospital in 
attributable only to Dr. Maly's death is not contested by the plaintiffs. Accordingly, summary judgment is granted to the 
defendants against Fullerton Memorial Hospital. "

808,4," BOSS is the acronym for Basic Four Operating System Software. It is a copyrighted product manufactured by MAI and is not 
usable on non-MAI computers."
808,5," Operating system software is a set of computer programs that guide and control the basic function of a computer. It also 
provides the necessary link between the computer equipment ""hardware"" and the various application programs ""software,"" 
designed to perform specific functions, such as accounting, word processing and payroll. Thus, whenever a user expands its 
computer system and adds peripheral equipment, the BOSS software must be reconfigured by MAI. If it is not reconfigured, the 
computer will not function at its full capacity."

808,8," Although MAI sells computer hardware, it distributes BOSS software only under license agreements which strictly limit the 
user's rights to reproduce and transfer the software. Murawski Affidavit at para. 7."
808,9," In its response to MAI's motion for summary judgment, Root argues that CDI's September 2nd offer is ""irrelevant,"" since it 
already decided to purchase a new IBM computer on August 30, 1983. The court finds this argument to be without merit 
because Root has not offered evidence to indicate that it communicated to CDI its decision to discontinue negotiations and buy 
new equipment from another company. "
809,10," Root defines the relevant market as one limited to Basic Four computer hardware and software. Such a narrow definition is 
erroneous. HN6[
] ""The essential test for ascertaining the relevant product market involves the identification of those products 
or services that are either (1) identical to or (2) available substitutes for the defendant's product or service."" White and White,

1502, 1523, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1961). In this case, it is undisputed that there are competing computer systems that are identical to 
those manufactured by MAI and distributed by CDI. Such competing brands are available substitutes for Basic Four hardware 
and software. Thus, the court finds that the relevant market is that of small business computers. "
810,11, Frank Murawski is a research consultant and analyst for MAI. 
811,12," The Court stated: HN11[
] Market power is usually stated to be the ability of a single seller to raise price and restrict output, for reduced 
output is the almost inevitable result of higher prices. Even a complete monopolist can seldom raise his price without losing 
some sales; many buyers will cease to buy the product, or buy less, as the price rises. Market power is therefore a source 
of serious concern for essentially the same reason, regardless of whether the seller has the greatest economic power 
possible or merely some lesser degree of appreciable economic power. In both instances, despite the freedom of some or 
many buyers from the seller's power, other buyers -- whether few or many, whether scattered throughout the market or part 
of some group within the market -- can be forced to accept the higher price because of their stronger preferences for the 
product, and the seller could therefore choose instead to force them to accept a tying arrangement that would prevent free 
competition for their patronage in the market for the tied product. Accordingly, the proper focus of concern is whether the 
seller has the power to raise prices, or impose other burdensome terms such as a tie-in, with respect to any appreciable 
number of buyers within the market."
811,394," U.S. at 503-04, 89 S. Ct. at 1259 (emphasis added)."
811,13," In United States Steel Corp., supra, the Court noted that although a large number of customers accepted the alleged tie-in, 
such evidence standing alone was insufficient to establish the requisite economic power. "

813,15," CDI asserts a permissive counterclaim pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(b). In essence, it seeks to compel Root to sign two (2) 
license agreements for software it purchased previously from CDI. It is well-settled that HN19[
] a permissive counterclaim 
must be supported by an independent source of jurisdiction. See McCaffrey v. Rex Motor Transportation Inc., 672 F.2d 246, 248 
(1st Cir. 1982); Federman v. Empire Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 597 F.2d 798, 812 (2d Cir. 1979); 6 Wright & Miller, Federal Practice 
and Procedure ยง 1422. Since Root and CDI are citizens of Ohio, federal diversity jurisdiction does not lie. Accordingly, CDI's 
counterclaim is dismissed without prejudice. "
821,1," In their reply brief, defendants requested that they be granted an opportunity to answer the amended complaint if we denied 
their motion. We do not have to rule on this request since Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(a)(1) permits defendants to answer the amended 
complaint within ten days after we deny their motion. "

828,2," We note that this is not a traditional below-cost pricing case.  The usual below-cost pricing case involves a firm lowering its 
price so that the new price it is offering for its product is below what it cost to make that product.  The facts presented here are 
different in that the price of the finished product stayed the same but the cost of the raw materials needed to make the product 
rose.  Analytically, this distinction is irrelevant."

828,4," Costs are divided into ""fixed costs"" and ""variable costs"".  Fixed costs are costs that do not vary with changes in output, e.g., 
most management expenses, interest on bonded debt, depreciation (to the extent that equipment is not consumed by using it), 
property taxes, and other irreducible overhead.  In short, fixed costs are costs that would continue even if the firm produced no 
output at all.  Variable costs vary with changes in output, e.g., materials, fuel, labor directly used to produce the product, indirect 
labor such as foreman, clerks, and custodial help, utilities, repair maintenance, and per unit royalties and license fees.  Marginal 
cost is the increment to total cost that results from producing an additional increment of output. Average total cost is obtained by 
dividing total cost by output. Similarly, average variable cost is the sum of all variable costs divided by output. Areeda & Turner, 
Predatory Pricing and Related Practices Under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 88 Harv. L. Rev. 697, 700-01 (1975). HN9[

828,5," The only other testimony presented concerning average variable cost was given by Darling-Tacoma's comptroller.  His 
testimony is inconclusive as it was elicited by way of a hypothetical. "
848,1," The above is derived from the admitted or uncontested facts contained in the pleadings and the declarations and depositions 
included in the record.  Disputed or conflicting evidence is noted as such. "
850,2, The single exception was Gianelli's claim of improper use by defendants of his customer list. 
851,3," The court based its ruling in part on a statement made in Tameny v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (1980) 27 Cal.3d 167, 179, footnote 
12 [164 Cal.Rptr. 839, 610 P.2d 1330, 9 A.L.R.4th 314], that the covenant could apply to wrongfully discharged employees. "
852,4," HN6[
] If a writing is deemed integrated, extrinsic evidence is admissible only if it is relevant to prove a meaning to which the 
language of the instrument is reasonably susceptible.  ( Pacific Gas & E. Co. v. G. W. Thomas Drayage etc. Co. (1968) 69 
Cal.2d 33, 37 [69 Cal.Rptr. 561, 442 P.2d 641, 40 A.L.R.3d 1373]; Sherman v. Mutual Benefit Life Ins. Co. (9th Cir. 1980) 633 
F.2d 782, 784.) The court must preliminarily consider evidence concerning the circumstances surrounding the making of the 
agreement to decide if the language of the contract, in the light of these circumstances, is fairly susceptible to the offered 
interpretation.  If so, the extrinsic evidence is admissible. ( Pacific Gas & E. Co., supra, 69 Cal.2d at p. 40.) "
854,5," Provisions of the California Uniform Commercial Code, although not determinative in this situation, are illustrative of the 
admissibility of evidence of trade usage to interpret contract terms.  California Uniform Commercial Code section 1205 provides 
that ""[a] usage of trade is any practice . . . having such regularity of observance in a place, vocation or trade as to justify an 
expectation that it will be observed with respect to the transaction in question.  The existence and scope of such a usage are to 
be proved as facts."" Section 1205 continues that a usage of trade may supplement the terms of an agreement, unless the usage 
is inconsistent with the express terms of the writing.  (See also Corbin, Contracts (1950) ยง 528 and (1960) ยง 556.) Similarly, 
California Uniform Commercial Code section 2202 permits parol or extrinsic evidence of a usage of trade to explain or 
supplement -- but not contradict -- a writing intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement.  This section has 
been held to permit introduction of evidence of trade usage even where there is no proof of ambiguity of terms of the writing.  ( 
Balfour, Guthrie & Co. v. Gourmet Farms (1980) 108 Cal.App.3d 181, 190 [166 Cal.Rptr. 422].) "
856,6," Among business practices generally considered to constitute per se violations are price fixing, resale price maintenance, group 
boycotts, tying arrangements, and certain types of reciprocal dealing.  (See Cernuto, Inc. v. United Cabinet Corp. (3d Cir. 1979) 
595 F.2d 164, 166.) "
857,7," HN20[
] ""It is important to distinguish between 'horizontal' restraints, i.e. agreements between competitors at the same level 
of market structure, and 'vertical' restraints, i.e. combinations of persons at different levels of the market structure, such as 
manufacturers and distributors. [Citation.] Horizontal restraints alone have been characterized as 'naked restraints of trade with 
no purpose except stifling competition,' [citation]; and, therefore per se violations of the Sherman Act.  On the other hand, while 
vertical restrictions may reduce intrabrand competition by limiting the number of sellers of a particular product, competing for a 
given group of buyers, they also promote interbrand competition by allowing a manufacturer to achieve certain efficiencies in the 
distribution of its products [citation].  They are, therefore, to be examined under the rule of reason standard."" ( Oreck Corp. v. 
Whirlpool Corp. (2d Cir. 1978) 579 F.2d 126, 131, italics in original.) "
858,8," The parties have also referred to Battle v. Lubrizol Corp. (8th Cir. 1982) 673 F.2d 984, 987, in discussing whether the per se 
rule or the rule of reason is appropriate in determining whether a technically vertical restraint of trade which smacks of horizontal 
price fixing interference unduly restrains trade under the Sherman Act.  A panel of the Court of Appeals in that case reversed the 
trial court's judgment in favor of the manufacturer. Rehearing was granted on the issue whether an inference of conspiracy may 
be drawn from competitor complaints alone and the judgment of the trial court was affirmed by an equally divided court.  ( Battle 
v. Watson (8th Cir. 1982) 712 F.2d 1238.) The decision is thus without precedential value.  However, it is noteworthy that the 
opinion of the court on rehearing held that ""[a] manufacturer's termination after receiving complaints cannot be characterized in 
and of itself as responsive action permitting an inference of concerted action.  To do so is to nullify the well-recognized rule that 
termination following complaints by competitors is not sufficient to allow an inference of concerted action."" ( Id., at p. 1240.)"
858,9," ""Vertical restrictions promote interbrand competition by allowing the manufacturer to achieve certain efficiencies in the 
distribution of his products.  These 'redeeming virtues' are implicit in every decision sustaining vertical restrictions under the rule 
of reason. Economists have identified a number of ways in which manufacturers can use such restrictions to compete more 
effectively against other manufacturers. See, e.g., Preston, Restrictive Distribution Arrangements: Economic Analysis and Public 
Policy Standards.  30 Law & Contemp. Prob. 506, 511 (1965)."" ( Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., supra, 433 U.S. at 
pp. 54-55 [53 L.Ed.2d at p. 583].) "
860,10," The parties' briefing centers almost entirely upon the issue of whether Rausser sufficiently pleaded this violation in his 
complaint and whether the court erred in failing to consider this claim on the summary judgment motion.  Although we have 
determined to address the merits, as we believe summary judgment was properly granted upon the antitrust claims of all 
plaintiffs, it does appear that the issue may have been inadequately briefed. Defendants assert that this cause of action was not sufficiently pled and that therefore summary dismissal of it was appropriate.  
Business and Professions Code section 16756 HN29[
] provides that a cause of action is sufficiently pled if it states the 
""purpose or effects of the . . . combination, and that the accused is a member of . . . it, . . . without giving its name or description, 
or how, when or where it was created."" The complaint must contain ""factual allegations of specific conduct"" related to the cause 
of action. ( Jones v. H. F. Ahmanson & Co. (1969) 1 Cal.3d 93, 119 [81 Cal.Rptr. 592, 460 P.2d 464]; Chicago Title Ins. Co. v. 
Great Western Financial Corp. (1968) 69 Cal.2d 305, 327 [70 Cal.Rptr. 849, 444 P.2d 481].) Rausser's complaint, in paragraph 86, includes an allegation of a section 16727 violation, and further alleges a purpose of 
preventing and substantially lessening competition in the wholesale distribution of Beck's Beer in the relevant counties, thereby 
maintaining an artificially high resale price.  Rausser contends that the complaint incorporates by reference the factual allegation 
that Rausser was terminated because it refused to cease handling Beck's competitors. Paragraph 83 of the complaint does 
incorporate paragraph 77 which in turn incorporates exhibit F, the letter which discusses Beck's reasons for terminating Rausser.  
However, paragraph 86, the only one that discusses section 16727, does not incorporate those factual allegations.  (Since the 
complaint itself nowhere specifically alleges particular facts relating to an illegal exclusive dealing contract, it is possible that 
paragraph 86 contains a typographical error, and that ยง 16727 was intended to be 16726.) "
861,11," Evidence Code section 1223 provides that: HN32[
] ""Evidence of a statement offered against a party is not made 
inadmissible by the hearsay rule if: [para. ] (a) The statement was made by the declarant while participating in a conspiracy to 
commit a crime or civil wrong and in furtherance of the objective of that conspiracy; [para. ] (b) The statement was made prior to 
or during the time that the party was participating in that conspiracy; and [para. ] (c) The evidence is offered either after "
862,," admission of evidence sufficient to sustain a finding of the facts specified in subdivisions (a) and (b) or, in the court's discretion 
as to the order of proof, subject to the admission of such evidence."""
862,12," Restatement Second of Torts section 766, comment o, provides in pertinent part: ""o.  Causation.  The question whether the 
actor's conduct caused the third person to break his contract with the other raises an issue of fact . . . ."" "
863,13," Although section 767 of the Restatement Second contains some changes in phrasing, the essence of the section and the 
applicable comment (now com. b) remains unchanged. "
864,14," Although defendants maintain that causation is not present as Rausser was able to continue purchasing beer from Santa 
Clara Valley Distributors notwithstanding the letters from Woodlief, we believe that the question of damages is a factual one, as 
the letter may have contributed to the reduction of sources of supply for plaintiff Rausser."
864,15," Defendants state that a person, who in good faith, merely gives information or advice to other persons interested therein is not 
guilty of intentional interference with prospective business relations, citing Restatement Second of Torts, section 772.  However, 
as noted by the court in Lowell, ""[reliance] on this theory is misplaced since, as pointed out in comment a to the Restatement of 
Torts section 772, HN38[
] one of the conditions of such justification is '[1] that the advice be requested . . .'"" ( Id., at p. 20, fn."
864,1," .) In the present case nothing in the allegations of the complaint or presented at summary judgment suggests that defendants 
were requested by the wholesalers to advise them concerning supplying plaintiff. "
870,*, Ira S. Sacks filed a brief for Indian Head Inc. as amicus curiae urging affirmance.
870,1," That section reads in relevant part: ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several 
States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."" "
871,2," Although this patronage rebate policy is a form of price discrimination, ยง 4 of the Robinson-Patman Act specifically sanctions 
such activity by cooperatives: ""Nothing in this Act shall prevent a cooperative association from returning to its members, producers, or consumers the whole, or 
any part of, the net earnings or surplus resulting from its trading operations, in proportion to their purchases or sales from, to, or 
through the association."" 49 Stat. 1528, 15 U. S. C. ยง 13b. A relevant state-law provision provides analogous protection.  Ore. Rev. Stat. ยง 646.030 (1983). "
872,3," See L. Sullivan, Law of Antitrust 229-230 (1977); Bauer, Per Se Illegality of Concerted Refusals to Deal: A Rule Ripe for 
Reexamination, 79 Colum. L. Rev. 685 (1979). "
873,4," Northwest raises no challenge before this Court to the conclusion of the Court of Appeals that the cooperative's decision to 
expel Pacific was a ""combination or conspiracy"" affecting interstate commerce within the meaning of ยง 1 of the Sherman Act. "
874,5," See, e. g., American Motor Specialties Co. v. FTC, 278 F.2d 225, 229 (CA2), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 884 (1960). "
875,6," Because Pacific has not been wholly excluded from access to Northwest's wholesale operations, there is perhaps some 
question whether the challenged activity is properly characterized as a concerted refusal to deal.  To be precise, Northwest's 
activity is a concerted refusal to deal with Pacific on substantially equal terms.  Such activity might justify per se invalidation if it 
placed a competing firm at a severe competitive disadvantage. See generally Brodley, Joint Ventures and Antitrust Policy, 95 
Harv. L. Rev. 1521, 1532 (1982) (""Even if the joint venture does deal with outside firms, it may place them at a severe 
competitive disadvantage by treating them less favorably than it treats the [participants in the joint venture]"")."
875,7," Pacific argues, however, that this justification for expulsion was a pretext because the members of Northwest were fully aware 
of the change in ownership despite lack of formal notice. According to Pacific, Northwest's motive in the expulsion was to place 
Pacific at a competitive disadvantage to retaliate for Pacific's decision to engage in an independent wholesale operation.  Such a 
motive might be more troubling.  If Northwest's action were not substantially related to the efficiency-enhancing or procompetitive 
purposes that otherwise justify the cooperative's practices, an inference of anticompetitive animus might be appropriate.  But 
such an argument is appropriately evaluated under the rule-of-reason analysis. "
876,8," Given the state of this record it is difficult to understand how the Court of Appeals could have concluded that Pacific ""loses the 
ability to use Northwest's superior warehousing and expedited order-filling facilities, as well as any competitive advantages that 
may flow simply from being known in the industry as a member of an established cooperative."" 715 F.2d 1393, 1395 (1983). The 
District Court had specifically found no anticompetitive effect."
876,9," The District Court stated: ""I think that in a case of this nature, in order to move an antitrust violation, it is necessary to show some restraint of competition, 
and I don't believe that is shown here.  Even if it is a group boycott, I still believe under [Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc. v. 
Hawaiian Oke & Liquors, Ltd., 416 F.2d 71 (CA9 1969), and Ron Tonkin Gran Turismo, Inc. v. Fiat Distributors, Inc., 637 F.2d 
1376 (CA9 1981)], that the Rule of Reason operates.  And I think if you apply the Rule of Reason to the facts that are submitted 
by the parties here that are not disputed in this case, you come to the conclusion that there is [sic] simply been no showing by 
the Plaintiff in this case of a restraint of competition as distinguished from possible damage to the Plaintiff by being expelled from 
the association."" App. to Pet. for Cert. 23-24. "
884,1," This evidence may cut either way; it may well be regarded as evidence suggesting that competition for Sunday newspaper 
readers in Maine has increased since Defendant introduced Sunday. The Court takes note of this affidavit here only for the 
limited purpose of indicating that there exists a genuine issue of material fact as to the existence of a substantial potential for 
impact on competition. "
888,2," The Court notes that the fact that there may be others who support Plaintiffs' position does not vitiate the Court's concern that 
the broadly defined proposed class may well include persons with disparate interests with respect to matters material to this 
lawsuit. "
895,1," See Huron Valley Hospital, Inc. v. City of Pontiac, No. 78-72970 (E.D. Mich. Jan. 29, 1979)."
895,2," The defendants first assert that the applicable limitation period should be the 60 day period for appealing an adverse 
administrative determination under the Michigan Administrative Procedures Act, M.C.L. ยง 24.304. This argument is without merit.  
Burnett v. Grattan, 468 U.S. 42, 82 L. Ed. 2d 36, 104 S. Ct. 2924 (1984), held that HN3[
] a six-month state statute of 
limitations on filing employment discrimination complaints with an administrative agency was inappropriate for actions under the 
Civil Rights Acts (42 U.S.C. ยง 1981 et. seq.)."
895,3," Huron Valley Hospital, Inc. v. City of Pontiac, 466 F. Supp. 1301 (E.D. Mich. 1979), reversed on other grounds, 666 F.2d 1029 
(6th Cir. 1981)."
895,4, Id. 666 F.2d 1029 (6th Cir. 1981).
895,5," These defendants concede the amended complaint arose out of the same transaction or occurrence, but rely on Ringrose v. 
Engelberg Huller Co., Inc., 692 F.2d 403 (6th Cir. 1982), for the proposition that Rule 15 does not allow the addition of a new 
party after the statute would otherwise have run. Defendants assert that the rule permits an amendment to relate back only if it 
seeks to change a party who is already in the action -- in essence, only when correcting a misnomer. Ringrose does not support 
such a narrow construction of Rule 15, since the court remanded the case for a determination of whether service on a 
predecessor corporation was sufficient to give such notice that the two successor corporations would not be prejudiced in their "
896,," defenses on the merits, indicating that the real concern was with the adequacy of the notice given. See also 6 C. Wright & A. 
Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure, ยง 1498, at 512 (1971) where they note a split on the issue, but see ""no justification"" for 
such a restrictive interpretation as defendants urge, so long as the notice requirement is satisfied."

908,1, The following facts are derived primarily from the Magistrate's Report and Recommendation. 
910,2," The Furlong court upheld the district court's finding that the plaintiff had failed to plead facts that would support subject matter 
jurisdiction. The plaintiff did not outline facts from which it was inferable that the defendants' activities, infected with the illegality 
alleged, were likely to have a substantial effect on commerce. The court held that plaintiff's loss of $ 120,000 income, a 
substantial portion of which came from out of state insurers, was also insufficient, although a ""closer call,"" to sustain antitrust 
jurisdiction on a motion to dismiss. "
911,3," The preamble to the BY-LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS applicable to the medical staff of MCHV provides: Recognizing that the Medical Staff is responsible for the quality of medical care in the hospital and must accept and

] ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or 
persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed 
guilty of a felony . . . ."" 15 U. S. C. ยง 2."
922,2," Ski Co. developed Ajax in 1946.  The runs are quite steep and primarily designed for expert or advanced intermediate skiers. 
The base area of Ajax is located within the village of Aspen. "
923,3," In 1957, the United States Forest Service suggested that Ajax ""was getting crowded, and . . . that a ski area ought to be started 
at Highlands."" Tr. 150.  Whipple V. N. Jones, who owned an Aspen lodge at the time, discussed the project with Ski Co. officials, 
but they expressed little interest, telling him that they had ""plenty of problems at Aspen now, and we don't think we want to 
expand skiing in Aspen."" Id., at 150-151. Jones went ahead with the project on his own, and laid out a well-balanced set of ski 
runs: 25% beginner, 50% intermediate, 25% advanced.  The base area of Highlands Mountain is located 1 1/2 miles from the 
village of Aspen.  Id., at 154. Respondent Aspen Highlands Skiing Corporation provides the downhill skiing services at Highlands 
Mountain. Throughout this opinion we refer to both the respondent and its mountain as Highlands."
923,4," In 1958, Friedl Pfeiffer and Arthur Pfister began developing the ranches they owned at the base of Buttermilk Mountain into a 
third ski area.  Pfeiffer, a former Olympian, was the director of the ski school for Ski Co., and the runs he laid out were primarily 
for beginners and intermediate skiers. More advanced runs have since been developed.  The base area of Buttermilk is located 
approximately 2 1/4 miles from the village of Aspen.  Id., at 152, 1471-1472, 1526; Deposition of Paul Nitze 6-7."
923,5," In the early 1960's William Janss, a former ski racer, and his associates had acquired three ranches in the Snowmass Valley, 
and had secured Forest Service permits for a ski area.  The developer sold the company holding the permits to Ski Co. to allow 
it to develop a downhill skiing facility for the project, leaving him to develop the land at the base of the site.  A fairly balanced 
mountain was developed with a mixture of beginner, intermediate, and advanced runs.  Id., at 14-16; Tr. 1475-1476.  The base 
area of Snowmass is eight miles from the village of Aspen."
923,6," Id., at 378-379, 638, 2040-2051, 2069-2070, 2078-2082."
923,7," Friedl Pfeiffer, one of the developers of Buttermilk, initiated the idea of an all-Aspen ticket at a luncheon with the owner of 
Highlands and the President of Ski Co.  Pfeiffer, a native of Austria, informed his competitors that ""'[in] St. Anton, we have a 
mountain that has three different lift companies -- lifts owned by three different lift companies. . . .  We sell a ticket that is 
interchangeable.' It was good on any of those lifts; and he said, 'I think we should do the same thing here.'"" Id., at 153. "
924,8," Id., at 167.  Highlands' share of the total market during those seasons, as measured in skier visits was 15.8% in 1973-1974, 
17.1% in 1974-1975, 17.4% in 1975-1976, and 20.5% in 1976-1977.  Record Ex. No. 97, App. 183."
924,9," In 1975, the Colorado Attorney General filed a complaint against Ski Co. and Highlands alleging, in part, that the negotiations 
over the 4-area ticket had provided them with a forum for price fixing in violation of ยง 1 of the Sherman Act and that they had 
attempted to monopolize the market for downhill skiing services in Aspen in violation of ยง 2. Record Ex. X.  In 1977, the case 
was settled by a consent decree that permitted the parties to continue to offer the 4-area ticket provided that they set their own 
ticket prices unilaterally before negotiating its terms.  Tr. 229-231."
924,10," About 15-20% of each company's ticket revenues were derived from sales to tour operators at a wholesale discount of 10-
15%, while 80-85% of the ticket revenues were derived from sales to skiers in Aspen.  Id., at 623, 1772."
924,11," The 1976-1977 season was ""a no snow year."" There were less than half as many skier visits (529,800) in that season as in 
either 1975-1976 (1,238,500) or 1977-1978 (1,273,400).  Record Ex. No. 97, App. 183.  In addition, Highlands opened earlier 
than Ski Co.'s mountains and its patrons skied off all the good snow.  Ski Co. waited until January and had a better base for the 
rest of the season. Tr. 228. "
925,12," Ski Co. circulated another advertisement to national magazines labeled ""Aspen, More Mountains, More Fun."" App. 184.  The 
advertisement depicted the four mountains of Aspen, but labeled only Ajax, Buttermilk, and Snowmass.  Buttermilk's label is 
erroneously placed directly over Highlands Mountain. Tr. 860, 1803."
925,13," Highlands' owner explained that there was a key difference between the 3-day, 3-area ticket and the 6-day, 3-area ticket: ""with 
the three day ticket, a person could ski on the . . . Aspen Skiing Corporation mountains for three days and then there would be 
three days in which he could ski on our mountain; but with the six-day ticket, we are absolutely locked out of those people."" Id., 
at 245.  As a result of ""tremendous consumer demand"" for a 3-day ticket, Ski Co. reinstated it late in the 1978-1979 season, but 
without publicity or a discount off the daily rate.  Id., at 622."
925,14," In the 1977-1978 negotiations, Ski Co. previously had refused to consider the sale of any tickets to Highlands, noting that it 
was ""obviously not interested in helping sell"" a package competitive with the 3-area ticket. Record Ex. No. 16; Tr. 269-270.  
Later, in the 1978-1979 negotiations, Ski Co.'s vice president of finance told a Highlands official that ""[we] will not have anything 
to do with a four-area ticket sponsored by the Aspen Highlands Skiing Corporation."" Id., at 335.  When the Highlands official 
inquired why Ski Co. was taking this position considering that Highlands was willing to pay full retail value for the daily lift tickets, 
the Ski Co. official answered tersely: ""we will not support our competition."" Ibid. "
926,15," Of course, there was nothing to identify Highlands as the source of these instruments, unless someone saw the skier ""taking it 
out of an Adventure Pack envelope."" Id., at 505.  For the 1981-1982 season, Ski Co. set its single ticket price at $ 22 and 
discounted the 3-area, 6-day ticket to $ 114.  According to Highlands, this price structure made the Adventure Pack unprofitable.  
Id., at 535."
926,16," In these seasons, Buttermilk Mountain, in particular, substantially increased its market share at the expense of Highlands.  
Record Ex. BB; Tr. 1806."
926,17," See Record Ex. No. 91; Tr. 488, 571-572, 692-694, 698, 701-702.  Highlands' ski school had an outstanding reputation, and 
its share of the ski school market had always outperformed Highlands' share of the downhill skiing market.  Id., at 1822.  Even 
some Ski Co. officials had sent their children to ski school at Highlands.  Id., at 560-570, 588.  After the elimination of the 4-area 
ticket, however, families or groups purchasing 3-area tickets were reluctant to enroll a beginner among them in the Highlands ski 
school when the more experienced skiers would have to leave to ski at Ajax, Buttermilk, or Snowmass.  Id., at 571."
926,18," Highlands also alleged that Ski Co. had conspired with various third parties in violation of ยง 1 of the Sherman Act. The District 
Court allowed this claim to go to the jury which rendered a verdict in Ski Co.'s favor.  App. 189."
926,19," In United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 570-571 (1966), we explained: HN2[
] ""The offense of monopoly under ยง 2 of the Sherman Act has two elements: (1) the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market and (2) the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or development as 
a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident."""
926,20," The jury found that the relevant product market was ""[downhill] skiing at destination ski resorts,"" that the ""Aspen area"" was a 
relevant geographic submarket, and that during the years 1977-1981, Ski Co. possessed monopoly power, defined as the power 
to control prices in the relevant market or to exclude competitors. See App. 187-188. "
927,21," It answered this interrogatory affirmatively: ""Willful Acquisition, Maintenance or Use of Monopoly Power: Do you find by a preponderance of the evidence that the 
defendants willfully acquired, maintained or used monopoly power by anticompetitive or exclusionary means or for 
anticompetitive or exclusionary purposes, rather than primarily as a consequence of a superior product, superior business 
sense, or historic accident?"" Id., at 189."
927,22," Counsel also appears to have argued that Ski Co. was under a legal obligation to refuse to participate in any joint marketing 
arrangement with Highlands: ""Aspen Skiing Corporation is required to compete.  It is required to make independent decisions.  It is required to price its own 
product.  It is required to make its own determination of the ticket that it chooses to offer and the tickets that it chooses not to 
offer."" Tr. 1454. "
928,," In this Court, Ski Co. does not question the validity of the joint marketing arrangement under ยง 1 of the Sherman Act. Thus, we 
have no occasion to consider the circumstances that might permit such combinations in the skiing industry.  See generally 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla., 468 U.S. 85, 113-115 (1984); Broadcast Music, Inc., v. 
Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 441 U.S. 1, 18-23 (1979); Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 51-57 
(1977)."
928,23," The District Court also entered an injunction requiring the parties to offer jointly a 4-area, 6-out-of-7-day coupon booklet 
substantially identical to the ""Ski the Summit"" booklet accepted by Ski Co. at its Breckenridge resort in Summit County, 
Colorado.  See n. 30, infra. See also supra, at 589.  The injunction was initially for a 3-year period, but was later extended 
through the 1984-1985 season by stipulation of the parties.  Highlands represents that ""it will not seek an extension of the 
injunction."" Brief for Respondent 1, n. 1.  No question is raised concerning the character of the injunctive relief ordered by the 
District Court."
928,24," 738 F.2d, at 1516-1517 (quoting Ski Co.'s brief below)."
928,25," See Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 699 (1962); Associated Press v. United States, 326 
U.S. 1, 14 (1945)."
928,26," Highlands also contends that Ski Co.'s present contentions were not properly raised in the District Court.  In that court, Ski Co. 
primarily questioned whether the evidence supported a finding that it possessed monopoly power in a properly defined market.  
In this Court, on the other hand, Ski Co.'s entire argument relates to the question whether it misused that power.  Nevertheless, 
we agree with the Court of Appeals' conclusion, 738 F.2d, at 1517-1518, that Ski Co.'s motion for a directed verdict did raise the 
question whether the judgment improperly rested on an assumption that ยง 2 required a monopolist to cooperate with its rivals. "
929,27," HN3[
] Under ยง 1 of the Sherman Act, a business ""generally has a right to deal, or refuse to deal, with whomever it likes, as long as it does so independently."" Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 761 (1984); United States v. 
Colgate & Co., 250 U.S. 300, 307 (1919). "
930,28," ""In order to fall within ยง 2, the monopolist must have both the power to monopolize, and the intent to monopolize. To read the 
passage as demanding any 'specific,' intent, makes nonsense of it, for no monopolist monopolizes unconscious of what he is 
doing.  So here, 'Alcoa' meant to keep, and did keep, that complete and exclusive hold upon the ingot market with which it 
started.  That was to 'monopolize' that market, however innocently it otherwise proceeded."" United States v. Aluminum Co. of 
America, 148 F.2d, at 432."
930,29," R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 160 (1978) (hereinafter Bork)."
930,30," Ski Co. itself participates in interchangeable ticket programs in at least two other markets.  For example, since 1970, Ski Co. 
has operated the Breckenridge resort in Summit County, Colorado.  Breckenridge participates in the ""Ski the Summit"" 4-area 
interchangeable coupon booklet which allows the skier to ski at any of the four mountains in the region: Breckenridge, Copper 
Mountain, Keystone, and Arapahoe Basin.  Tr. 188, 590, 966, 1070-1081.  In the 1979-1980 season Keystone and Arapahoe 
Basin -- which are jointly operated -- had about 40% of the Summit County market, and the other two ski mountains each had a 
market share of about 30%.  Id., at 1100.  During the relevant period of time, Ski Co. also operated Blackcomb Mountain, 
northeast of Vancouver, British Columbia, which has an interchangeable ticket arrangement with nearby Whistler Mountain, an 
independently operated facility.  Id., at 369, 873-874.  Interchangeable lift tickets apparently are also available in some European 
skiing areas.  See n. 7, supra; Tr. 720."
930,31," ""In any business, patterns of distribution develop over time; these may reasonably be thought to be more efficient than 
alternative patterns of distribution that do not develop.  The patterns that do develop and persist we may call the optimal 
patterns.  By disturbing optimal distribution patterns one rival can impose costs upon another, that is, force the other to accept 
higher costs."" Bork 156. In ยง 1 cases where this Court has applied the per se approach to invalidity to concerted refusals to deal, ""the boycott often cut off 
access to a supply, facility or market necessary to enable the boycotted firm to compete, . . . and frequently the boycotting firms 
possessed a dominant position in the relevant market."" Northwest Wholesale Stationers, Inc. v. Pacific Stationery & Printing Co., 
ante, at 294. "
931,32," ""Thus, HN6[
] 'exclusionary' comprehends at the most behavior that not only (1) tends to impair the opportunities of rivals, 
but also (2) either does not further competition on the merits or does so in an unnecessarily restrictive way."" 3 P. Areeda & D. 
Turner, Antitrust Law 78 (1978)."
931,33, Bork 138.
931,34," Highlands' expert marketing witness testified that visitors to the Aspen resort ""are looking for a variety of skiing experiences, 
partly because they are going to be there for a week and they are going to get bored if they ski in one area for very long; and 
also they come with people of varying skills.  They need some variety of slopes so that if they want to go out and ski the difficult 
areas, their spouses or their buddies who are just starting out skiing can go on the bunny hill or the not-so-difficult slopes."" Tr. 
765.  The owner of a condominium management company added: ""The guest is coming for a first-class destination ski 
experience, and part of that, I think, is the expectation of perhaps having available to him the ability to ski all of what is there; i. 
e., four mountains vs. three mountains. It helps enhance the quality of the vacation experience."" Id., at 720. See also id., at 685. "
932,35," ""Our philosophy is that . . . to offer [Aspen] as a premier ski resort, our clients should be offered all of the terrain.  Therefore, 
we would never consciously consider offering a three-mountain ticket if there were a four-mountain ticket available."" Id., at 1026."
932,36," Id., at 356, 492, 572, 679, 1001-1002.  For example, the marketing director of Highlands' ski school reported that one 
frustrated consumer was a dentist from ""the Des Moines area [who] came out with two of his children, and he had been told by 
our base lift operator that he could not board.  He became somewhat irate and she had referred him to my office, which is right 
there on the ski slopes. He came into my office and started out, 'Well, I want to go skiing here, and I don't understand why I 
can't.' When we got the situation slowed down and explained that there were two different tickets, well, what came out is irritation 
occurred because he had intended when he came to Aspen to be able to ski all areas . . . ."" Id., at 356."
932,37," The refund policy was cumbersome, and poorly publicized.  Id., at 994, 1044, 1053."
932,38," In considering the competitive effect of Ski Co.'s refusal to deal or cooperate with Highlands, it is not irrelevant to note that 
similar conduct carried out by the concerted action of three independent rivals with a similar share of the market would constitute 
a per se violation of ยง 1 of the Sherman Act. See Northwest Wholesale Stationers, Inc. v. Pacific Stationery & Printing Co., ante, 
at 294.  Cf. Lorain Journal Co. v. United States, 342 U.S. 143, 154 (1951). "
933,39," ""The law can usefully attack this form of predation only when there is evidence of specific intent to drive others from the 
market by means other than superior efficiency and when the predator has overwhelming market size, perhaps 80 or 90 percent.  
Proof of specific intent to engage in predation may be in the form of statements made by the officers or agents of the company, 
evidence that the conduct was used threateningly and did not continue when a rival capitulated, or evidence that the conduct 
was not related to any apparent efficiency.  These matters are not so difficult of proof as to render the test overly hard to meet."" 
Bork 157 (emphasis added)."
933,40," Under the Ski Co. system, each skier's ticket, whether a daily or weekly ticket, is punched before he goes out on the slopes for 
the day.  Revenues are distributed between the mountains on the basis of this count.  Tr. 650-651.  Ski Co.'s vice president for 
finance testified that Ski Co. ""would never consider"" a system like that for monitoring usage on a 4-area ticket: ""it's fine to 
approximate within your own company."" Id., at 599.  The United States Forest Service, however, required the submission of 
financial information on a mountain-by-mountain basis as a condition of the permits issued for each mountain. Id., at 643, 945.  
A lift operator at Ajax conceded that the survey count during the years of the 4-area ticket was ""generally pretty close"" to the 
count made by Ski Co.'s staff.  Id., at 1627."
933,41," Lorain Journal Co. v. United States, 342 U.S., at 149 (quoting opinion below, 92 F.Supp. 794, 796 (ND Ohio 1950))."
933,42," ""[Why] didn't they buy an individual daily lift ticket at Aspen Highlands? . . .  For those who had bought six-day tickets, I think 
despite the fact that they are all relatively affluent -- a lot of them are relatively affluent when they go to Aspen -- they are all sort 
of managerial types and they seem to be pretty cautious.  Certainly the comments that I have had from individual skiers and 
from the tour operators, club people that I have talked to -- they are pretty careful with their money and they would feel -- these 
are the people who will buy the six-day, three-area ticket that giving up one of those days and going over to ski at Aspen 
Highlands would mean spending extra money."" Tr. 777. "
934,43," The Ski Co. advertising that conveyed the impression that there were only three skiing mountains in Aspen, supra, at 593, and 
n. 12, is consistent with this conclusion, even though this evidence would not be sufficient in itself to sustain the judgment."
934,44," Given our conclusion that the evidence amply supports the verdict under the instructions as given by the trial court, we find it 
unnecessary to consider the possible relevance of the ""essential facilities"" doctrine, or the somewhat hypothetical question 
whether nonexclusionary conduct could ever constitute an abuse of monopoly power if motivated by an anticompetitive purpose.  
If, as we have assumed, no monopolist monopolizes unconscious of what he is doing, that case is unlikely to arise. "
936,1," Unless otherwise stated, all statutory references are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 as amended and in effect during the 
years here in issue. "
940,2," The parties agreed in a substitution agreement to substitute Peavey Co. for Colorado Milling & Elevator Co. as a party to the 
agreement. "
946,3," According to the stipulation of facts, the total amount paid by all parties pursuant to the ITT agreement was $ 573,478.76, and 
the amount paid by petitioner after technical adjustments was $ 144,039.27. "
947,4," In the stipulation  [**33] of facts, the parties agree that these figures should be $ 144,039."
947,5, This obviously was intended to be 1.00.
947,6," Through this computation respondent effectively apportioned $ 281,987 of the litigation expenses of American Bakeries to 
Fisher Mills ($ 432,792 - $ 281,987 = $ 150,805) and $ 43,740 of the Interstate litigation expenses to Fisher Mills ($ 121,500 - $ 
43,740 = $ 77,760). "
948,7," For detailed discussion of the legislative history of this provision of the Tax Reform Act of 1969, see Wilberding, ""New Tax 
Consideration Injected Into Antitrust Treble Damage Proceedings,"" 19 Kan. L. Rev. 441 (1971); Boland, ""Income Tax Treatment 
of Antitrust Damages,"" 22 Tax L. Rev. 47 (1966). "
949,8," Petitioner does not contend that its entire payment to Interstate was a reimbursement of the plaintiff's attorneys' fees and 
litigation costs.  Although not specifically so stated, petitioner apparently accepts respondent's allocation of the amount of Fisher 
Mills' payment to Interstate allocable to attorneys' fees and litigation costs.  Respondent questions,  [**39] however, petitioner's 
allocation of the payment in excess of attorneys' fees to the period after Jan. 27, 1972."
949,9," Fisher Mills is a subsidiary of Fisher Co.'s, Inc., which is the petitioner in this case.  In the interest of simplicity, we sometimes 
refer to Fisher Mills as the petitioner in discussing the arguments of the parties and our conclusion. "
950,10," 15 U.S.C. sec. 15 (1975).  Sec. 4 of the Clayton Act provides in pertinent part: ""Any person who shall be injured in his 
business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor * * * without respect to the amount in 
controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained."""
950,11," Criminal antitrust violations are subject to a 5-year statute of limitation period under 18 U.S.C. sec. 3282 (1979), while civil 
damage actions brought under sec. 4 of the Clayton Act are subject to a 4-year statute of limitation under 15 U.S.C. sec. 15b 
(1975).  However, the civil statute of limitations may be tolled by fraudulent concealment of a conspiracy. As heretofore pointed 
out, sec. 1.162-22(c), Income Tax Regs., defines a ""related violation"" as requiring the United States to have obtained both a 
judgment in the criminal proceeding and an injunction against the taxpayer.  Sec. 1.162-22(f), example (2), Income Tax Regs., 
considers the case where the Government has obtained an injunction and a criminal judgment against a taxpayer for activities 
occurring between 1965 and 1970, while the civil damage action was based on a conspiracy occurring during 1963, ""a 
 [**45] year barred by the applicable criminal statute of limitations,"" but for which the pleadings in the civil action ""alleged that the 
civil statute of limitations had been tolled by the defendants' fraudulent concealment of their conspiracy."""
950,12," See example (3) of sec. 1.162-22(f), Income Tax Regs., which provides: Example (3). Assume the same facts as in example (1) [a conviction of antitrust violations with respect to electric transformers 
and an injunction with respect to price fixing of transformers] except that Z Co.'s claim for treble damages was based on a 
conspiracy to fix and maintain prices with respect to electrical insulators for high-tension power poles.  Since the civil action was "
951,," not based on the same violation of the Federal antitrust laws as the criminal action, or on a related violation (a violation which 
would have contravened the injunction if it were applicable), X Co. and Y Co. are not precluded by section 162(g)  [**47] from 
deducting as a trade or business expense the entire $ 85,000 paid by each in settlement of the civil action."
951,13," It is not clear from petitioner's argument that it does not concede that part of the payment with respect to American Bakeries 
was on account of the violation for which it was convicted if we hold as we have that the entire payment it made to American 
Bakeries was not in reimbursement of American Bakeries' attorneys' fees and litigation costs.  Petitioner does contend that no 
part of the payment to Interstate was on account of such violation, since it claims that the entire payment was for the period 
subsequent to January 1972.  Fisher Mills' criminal conviction was for the period from Aug. 15, 1967, to Dec. 31, 1969."
951,14," Sec. 1.162-22(c), Income Tax Regs., defines ""related violation"" as follows: (c) Related violation.  For purposes of this section, a violation of the Federal antitrust laws is related to a subsequent violation if 
(1) with respect to the subsequent violation the United States obtains both a judgment in a criminal proceeding and an injunction 
against the taxpayer, and (2) the taxpayer's actions which constituted the prior violation would have contravened such 
 [**48] injunction if such injunction were applicable at the time of the prior violation."
951,15," This case involved a conviction on a nolo contendere plea which would ordinarily permit the company convicted to avoid 
having the plea  [**50] constitute an admission in the subsequent litigation under sec. 4 of the Clayton Act. See A.B. Dick Co. v. 
Marr, 95 F. Supp. 83, 101 (S.D.N.Y. 1950). Since sec. 162(g) provides for disallowance of two-thirds of the treble damages on a 
conviction on a nolo contendere plea, it may be that in promulgating sec. 1.162-22(c), Income Tax Regs., respondent considered "
952,," that at least in these circumstances for years other than the years of the conviction there was no clear violation of a clearly 
defined public policy absent the United States also obtaining an injunction."
952,16," In fact, respondent in  [**54] his reply brief makes the following statement: It is interesting to note, and consistent with respondent's theory of the case, that petitioner states in support of its alternative 
theory: ""This allocation would be consistent with the mutual release executed upon the settlement which provided that in consideration 
of the payment, the parties released any claims which 'were or have been, or could in any way have been alleged in the 
respective pleadings * * *'"" "
963,1," Forty-nine defendants settled with the plaintiff prior to trial for a total amount of $295,000.  Apparently, this settlement covered 
both the present suit and a parallel class action suit brought by Park on behalf of all persons who had sold pre-owned residential 
real estate in El Paso County during the limitations period."
963,2," This award included a credit of $295,000 for the pretrial settlement."
963,3," Mark I Realty, Inc., and C & H Realty, Inc."
963,4," Only two realty companies remain in the case, since of the five brokers against whom judgment was entered, one did not file a 
notice of appeal (Elaine Achez) and two have voluntarily dismissed their appeals (Moorhead, Inc., and Donald M. Love, Jr.)."
963,5," One of these six brokers (Wayne L. Moorhead) has been dismissed from the case.  The remaining five cross-appellees are E. 
Dempsey Gunaca, Bruce B. Shields, Raymond Baca, Cecil D. Clark, and Ralph K. Tutor."
963,6," Under Texas law, a broker may not bring an action against a homeowner to recover a commission unless the commission 
agreement is in writing.  Texas Real Estate License Act ยง 20(b) Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6573a, ยง 20(b) (Ver. non 
Supp.1985).  Consequently, a real estate broker usually attempts to obtain from a property owner a written ""listing agreement."" "
964,7," For a general description and discussion of multiple listing services, see United States v. Realty Multi-List, Inc., 629 F.2d 1351, 
1355 (5th Cir. 1980)."
964,8," Ultimately, Park abandoned his flat fee and began charging commissions of two percent of the sales price of the property."
964,9," Despite this drop in sales, for unexplained reasons 1980 was apparently Park's most profitable year. "
965,10," Indeed, the appellants introduced evidence (1) that of the total number of Action's listings sold between 1976 and 1980, a 
greater number were sold by other MLS members than by Action itself, and (2) that the percentage of Action's listings sold by 
other MLS members was slightly higher than the average. "
966,11," This is a specific instance of the general principle that ""one can infer accord from common action only if it occurs in a setting 
which bespeaks accord."" L. Sullivan, Antitrust 315 (1977).  The fact that all people eat, drink, are occasionally merry, and die is 
hardly evidence of a conspiracy. In order to present a jury question regarding the existence of a conspiracy, an antitrust plaintiff 
must establish not merely consciously parallel action but a ""plus factor"" that indicates agreement.  Id. at 317.  Once he has met 
this initial burden, however -- that is, once he has established a setting that bespeaks accord -- then consciously parallel action 
is probative of the existence of a conspiracy whether or not it is potentially explicable in terms of the actor's self-interest.  It is up 
to the jury to determine which explanation of the parallel action to accept: the explanation in terms of conspiracy or in terms of 
independent business judgment."
966,12," In addition, we note that, contrary to the appellants' assertion, the plaintiff did present direct evidence that a boycott conspiracy 
existed -- in particular, he introduced statements by other brokers that the brokers in El Paso were going to drive Park out of 
business, 14 Rec. at 1115, and that the real estate profession regarded him as a person not to be dealt with, 14 Rec. at 1090."
966,13, The Board stayed further action on Park's complaint as a result of the filing of the present suit. 
968,14," The appellants also raise an objection to the form of the special interrogatory regarding interstate commerce. They claim that 
because the interrogatory did not distinguish between the price-fixing and the boycott conspiracies, it is possible that the jury 
found only that the price-fixing activities had had a substantial effect on interstate commerce. Because we reverse and remand 
on other grounds, we need not consider this question here.  We assume that, on remand, if the district court again submits 
special interrogatories, it will ask the jury specifically whether the activities affected by the boycott conspiracy had a substantial 
effect on interstate commerce."
968,15," In our view, all of the appellant's arguments regarding proof of the fact of damages relate instead to the size of the damage 
award. They do not show that the plaintiff did not sustain any injury. "
969,16," Where the defense counsel has failed to move for a James ruling at the close of all the evidence, we have limited our review 
of the district court's actions to the plain error rule.  United States v. DeRoche, 726 F.2d 1025, 1028 (5th Cir. 1984). Here, 
however, the defense counsel clearly did meet its burden of requesting a James ruling. 25 Rec. at 3730-32. "
970,17," The present case is thus distinguishable from Winship, where the trial court failed to articulate its James findings but implicitly 
applied the correct legal standard.  See Winship, 724 F.2d at 1121-22."
970,18," In this respect, the present case differs from cases where the evidence in question was obtained not merely in violation of a 
telephone tariff, but in violation of a party's fourth amendment rights."
970,19," In the present case, the plaintiff's purpose for taping the telephone conversations was to preserve evidence for trial.  In our 
view, this purpose is not an ""injurious act"" within the meaning of ยง 2511(2)(d). Cf.  Moore v. Telfon Communications Corp., 589 
F.2d 959, 966 (9th Cir. 1978)(Congress did not intend to prohibit recording a conversation when the purpose of the recording is 
to preserve evidence of extortion); Meredith v. Gavin, 446 F.2d 794, 799 (8th Cir. 1971) (Congress intended only to prohibit use 
of an intercepted conversation ""in a manner in which the offending party had no right to proceed""). "
972,20," A twenty percent market share would have made Action Real Estate the size of the largest four real estate firms combined in 
El Paso in 1980. 23 Rec. at 3328."
972,21," The highest profit reported by the plaintiff in any year was approximately $20,000.  In view of the fact that the plaintiff claimed 
to be working full-time in the realty business, this ""profit"" is more likely to represent a return on the plaintiff's labor than a profit 
from sales by his subordinates."
972,22," Our analysis of the logical defect in Dr. George's calculation of profit rate is confirmed by an examination of the profit rates of 
other real estate firms.  The defendants introduced uncontradicted evidence that the average profit rate for real estate brokerage 
firms nationally for the 1975 to 1980 period was only five percent. 24 Rec. at 3541-42.  The highest profit rate cited by the 
plaintiff for another brokerage firm in El Paso was twenty-six percent, and that was for only a single year, not for a sustained 
period. 20 Rec. at 2539.  Dr. George failed to give any credible explanation of how a firm could provide roughly the same 
services as other firms, charge a third of the price, and earn a higher profit rate.  Even were the plaintiff the Henry Ford of the 
realty industry, we are doubtful that he could have achieved threefold economies of scale."
972,23," In addition, since the exact number of residential resales in El Paso can now be determined for much of the damages period, 
the plaintiff should incorporate these figures into his model rather than rely on projections as he did previously.  The plaintiff 
should also use actual figures rather than projections for the home resale inflation rate, when calculating the commissions he 
would have received for his lost sales. "

982,4," See Wilk v. American Medical Association, 719 F.2d at 224-25, for a discussion of the limited role evidence of intent or purpose 
plays in consideration of the effect of the challenged actions as anticompetitive under the Sherman Act. As the Seventh Circuit in 
Wilk noted, the Chicago Board of Trade case sanctioned the consideration of the reason for adopting a particular remedy and "
983,," the purpose or end sought to be attained merely to assist the court in determining the effect of the defendant's conduct on 
competition.  719 F.2d at 225. "
995,1," In the plaintiffs' objections to Magistrate Sussman's denial of Rule 11 sanctions, plaintiffs argued that sanctions should be 
allowed pursuant to Rule 37(d) as well as Rule 11.  CAC's Ex. 5 at p. 2-3.  Judge McMillen affirmed that no Rule 11 sanctions 
were warranted, but found the Rule 37(d) argument had merit.  Therefore, it is not true, as CAC contends, that plaintiffs never 
raised or ""requested"" Rule 37(d) sanctions.  Defendants' Response at p. 5. "
999,1, A creative director is one who creates commercial materials for use in the advertising business. 
1002,2," The Court finds Defendant's argument that his business is not ""operated"" or ""situated"" in New England of no value since 
Defendant admits soliciting customers and using production facilities in the area. "
1003,3," The Court finds spurious Plaintiff's implication that Mr. Schiff's participation in production selection at Dial Media gave him 
invaluable information to which he was not otherwise privy. The factors which Dial Media uses in its product selection and 
advertising are nothing more than well-known advertising techniques. (e.g. use an attention-getting device early in the ad). 
Plaintiff disclosed nothing of a confidential nature which could have been used by Defendant to Plaintiff's detriment. "
1004,4," The covenant in Welcome Wagon, supra restrained the promisor from competing against the promisee in three (3) discrete 
geographically designated areas.  Welcome Wagon, supra at 506, 127 N.E.2d at 105."
1004,5," Despite Defendant's admission that he does business with Urban General, one of Plaintiff's biggest competitors, Plaintiff has 
not demonstrated that Defendant gained any unfair competitive advantage due to his former employment at Dial Media, any 
more than a stranger would have, who had Mr. Schiff's background and experience. Since an employee is entitled to use 
general knowledge and expertise learned during his employment to continue his livelihood, Plaintiff has no interest in 
Defendant's future productivity to protect. "
1013,1," Plaintiff apparently has addressed only the first step, arguing simply that the restraints are tantamount to a boycott and thus 
illegal per se. "
1014,2," Lomar does not explicitly contend that this occurred.  Indeed, plaintiff's explanation of the conspiracy has been conclusory and 
lacking in specifics. Nevertheless, the Court feels obligated, given the standards applicable to summary judgments, to address 
these possibilities. "
1017,3," This Court holds that the difference between terminating a distributorship and refusing to grant a distributorship is not legally 
significant in the context of the standard of proof required to permit the inference of a price-fixing conspiracy. "

1030,5," The day after the decision in this case, another divided panel of the Second Circuit reached a similar conclusion.  Bankers 
Trust Co. v. Rhoades, 741 F.2d 511 (1984), cert. pending, No. 84-657.  It held that ยง 1964(c) allowed recovery only for injuries 
resulting not from the predicate acts, but from the fact that they were part of a pattern.  ""If a plaintiff's injury is that caused by the 
predicate acts themselves, he is injured regardless of whether or not there is a pattern; hence he cannot be said to be injured by 
the pattern,"" and cannot recover.  Id., at 517 (emphasis in original). The following day, a third panel of the same Circuit, this time unanimous, decided Furman v. Cirrito, 741 F.2d 524 (1984), cert. 
pending, No. 84-604.  In that case, the District Court had dismissed the complaint for failure to allege a distinct racketeering 
injury.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, relying on the opinions in Sedima and Bankers Trust, but wrote at some length to record 
its disagreement with those decisions.  The panel would have required no injury beyond that resulting from the predicate acts."
1030,6," A month after the trio of Second Circuit opinions was released, the Eighth Circuit decided Alexander Grant & Co. v. Tiffany 
Industries, Inc., 742 F.2d 408 (1984), cert. pending, Nos. 84-1084, 84-1222.  Viewing its decision as contrary to Sedima but 
consistent with, though broader than, Bankers Trust, the court held that a RICO claim does require some unspecified element 
beyond the injury flowing directly from the predicate acts.  At the same time, it stood by a prior decision that had rejected any 
requirement that the injury be solely commercial or competitive, or that the defendants be involved in organized crime. 742 F.2d, 
at 413; see Bennett v. Berg, 685 F.2d 1053, 1058-1059, 1063-1064 (CA8 1982), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 710 F.2d 1361 (en 
banc), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 1008 (1983). Two months later, the Seventh Circuit decided Haroco, Inc. v. American National Bank & Trust Co. of Chicago, 747 F.2d 384 
(1984), aff'd, post, p. 606.  Dismissing Sedima as the resurrection of the discredited requirement of an organized crime nexus, 
and Bankers Trust as an emasculation of the treble-damages remedy, the Seventh Circuit rejected ""the elusive racketeering 
injury requirement."" 747 F.2d, at 394, 398-399. The Fifth Circuit had taken a similar position.  Alcorn County v. U.S. Interstate 
Supplies, Inc., 731 F.2d 1160, 1169 (1984). The requirement of a prior RICO conviction was rejected in Bunker Ramo Corp. v. United Business Forms, Inc., 713 F.2d 1272, 
1286-1287 (CA7 1983), and USACO Coal Co. v. Carbomin Energy, Inc., 689 F.2d 94 (CA6 1982). See also United States v. 
Cappetto, 502 F.2d 1351 (CA7 1974), cert. denied, 420 U.S. 925 (1975) (civil action by Government). "
1031,7," When Congress intended that the defendant have been previously convicted, it said so.  Title 18 U. S. C. ยง 1963(f) (1982 ed., 
Supp. III) states that ""[upon] conviction of a person under this section,"" his forfeited property shall be seized.  Likewise, in Title X 
of the same legislation Congress explicitly required prior convictions, rather than prior criminal activity, to support enhanced 
sentences for special offenders.  See 18 U. S. C. ยง 3575(e)."
1031,8," The court below considered it significant that ยง 1964(c) requires a ""violation of section 1962,"" whereas the Clayton Act speaks 
of ""anything forbidden in the antitrust laws."" 741 F.2d, at 488; see 15 U. S. C. ยง 15(a).  The court viewed this as a deliberate 
change indicating Congress' desire that the underlying conduct not only be forbidden, but also have led to a criminal conviction.  
There is nothing in the legislative history to support this interpretation, and we cannot view this minor departure in wording, 
without more, to indicate a fundamental departure in meaning.  Representative Steiger, who proposed this wording in the House, 
nowhere indicated a desire to depart from the antitrust model in this regard.  See 116 Cong. Rec. 35227, 35246 (1970).  To the 
contrary, he viewed the treble-damages provision as a ""parallel private remedy."" Id., at 27739 (letter to House Judiciary "
1032,," Committee).  Likewise, Senator Hruska's discussion of his identically worded proposal gives no hint of any such intent.  See 115 
Cong. Rec. 6993 (1969).  In any event, the change in language does not support the court's drastic inference.  It seems more 
likely that the language was chosen because it is more succinct than that in the Clayton Act, and is consistent with the 
neighboring provisions.  See ยงยง 1963(a), 1964(a)."
1032,9," It is worth bearing in mind that the holding of the court below is not without problematic consequences of its own.  It arbitrarily 
restricts the availability of private actions, for lawbreakers are often not apprehended and convicted. Even if a conviction has 
been obtained, it is unlikely that a private plaintiff will be able to recover for all of the acts constituting an extensive ""pattern,"" or 
that multiple victims will all be able to obtain redress.  This is because criminal convictions are often limited to a small portion of 
the actual or possible charges.  The decision below would also create peculiar incentives for plea bargaining to non-predicate-
act offenses so as to ensure immunity from a later civil suit.  If nothing else, a criminal defendant might plead to a tiny fraction of 
counts, so as to limit future civil liability.  In addition, the dependence of potential civil litigants on the initiation and success of a 
criminal prosecution could lead to unhealthy private pressures on prosecutors and to self-serving trial testimony, or at least 
accusations thereof.  Problems would also arise if some or all of the convictions were reversed on appeal.  Finally, the 
compelled wait for the completion of criminal proceedings would result in pursuit of stale claims, complex statute of limitations 
problems, or the wasteful splitting of actions, with resultant claim and issue preclusion complications."
1032,10," The Court of Appeals also observed that allowing civil suits without prior convictions ""would make a hash"" of the statute's 
liberal-construction requirement.  741 F.2d, at 502; see RICO ยง 904(a).  Since criminal statutes must be strictly construed, the 
court reasoned, allowing liberal construction of RICO -- an approach often justified on the ground that the conduct for which 
liability is imposed is ""already criminal"" -- would only be permissible if there already existed criminal convictions.  Again, we have 
doubts about the premise of this rather convoluted argument.  The strict-construction principle is merely a guide to statutory 
interpretation.  Like its identical twin, the ""rule of lenity,"" it ""only serves as an aid for resolving an ambiguity; it is not to be used to

1033,," (1981). But even if that principle has some application, it does not support the court's holding.  The strict- and liberal-construction 
principles are not mutually exclusive; ยง 1961 and ยง 1962 can be strictly construed without adopting that approach to ยง 1964(c).  
Cf.  United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422, 443, n. 19 (1978). Indeed, if Congress' liberal-construction 
mandate is to be applied anywhere, it is in ยง 1964, where RICO's remedial purposes are most evident."
1033,11," Even were the constitutional questions more significant, any doubts would be insufficient to overcome the mandate of the 
statute's language and history.  ""Statutes should be construed to avoid constitutional questions, but this interpretative canon is 
not a license for the judiciary to rewrite language enacted by the legislature."" United States v. Albertini, 472 U.S. 675, 680

1034,12," The decision below does not appear identical to Bankers Trust.  It established a standing requirement, whereas Bankers Trust 
adopted a limitation on damages.  The one focused on the mobster element, the other took a more conceptual approach, 
distinguishing injury caused by the individual acts from injury caused by their cumulative effect.  Thus, the Eighth Circuit has 
indicated its agreement with Bankers Trust but not Sedima.  Alexander Grant & Co. v. Tiffany Industries, Inc., 742 F.2d, at 413. 
See also Haroco, Inc. v. American National Bank & Trust Co. of Chicago, 747 F.2d, at 396. The two tests were described as 
""very different"" by the ABA Task Force.  See ABA Report, at 310. Yet the Bankers Trust court itself did not seem to think it was departing from Sedima, see 741 F.2d, at 516-517, and other 
Second Circuit panels have treated the two decisions as consistent, see Furman v. Cirrito, 741 F.2d 524 (1984), cert. pending, 
No. 84-604; Durante Brothers & Sons, Inc. v. Flushing National Bank, 755 F.2d 239, 246 (1985). The evident difficulty in 
discerning just what the racketeering injury requirement consists of would make it rather hard to apply in practice or explain to a 
jury."
1034,13," Given the plain words of the statute, we cannot agree with the court below that Congress could have had no ""inkling of [ยง 
1964(c)'s] implications."" 741 F.2d, at 492. Congress' ""inklings"" are best determined by the statutory language that it chooses, 
and the language it chose here extends far beyond the limits drawn by the Court of Appeals.  Nor does the ""clanging silence"" of 
the legislative history, ibid., justify those limits.  For one thing, ยง 1964(c) did not pass through Congress unnoticed.  See Part II, 
supra.  In addition, congressional silence, no matter how ""clanging,"" cannot override the words of the statute."
1034,14," As many commentators have pointed out, the definition of a ""pattern of racketeering activity"" differs from the other provisions 
in ยง 1961 in that it states that a pattern ""requires at least two acts of racketeering activity,"" ยง 1961(5) (emphasis added), not that 
it ""means"" two such acts.  The implication is that while two acts are necessary, they may not be sufficient.  Indeed, in common 
parlance two of anything do not generally form a ""pattern."" The legislative history supports the view that two isolated acts of 
racketeering activity do not constitute a pattern.  As the Senate Report explained: ""The target of [RICO] is thus not sporadic 
activity.  The infiltration of legitimate business normally requires more than one 'racketeering activity' and the threat of continuing 
activity to be effective.  It is this factor of continuity plus relationship which combines to produce a pattern."" S. Rep. No. 91-617, 
p. 158 (1969) (emphasis added).  Similarly, the sponsor of the Senate bill, after quoting this portion of the Report, pointed out to 
his colleagues that ""[the] term 'pattern' itself requires the showing of a relationship . . . .  So, therefore, proof of two acts of 
racketeering activity, without more, does not establish a pattern . . . ."" 116 Cong. Rec. 18940 (1970) (statement of Sen. 
McClellan).  See also id., at 35193 (statement of Rep. Poff) (RICO ""not aimed at the isolated offender""); House Hearings, at 665. "
1035,," Significantly, in defining ""pattern"" in a later provision of the same bill, Congress was more enlightening: ""[Criminal] conduct forms 
a pattern if it embraces criminal acts that have the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of 
commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events."" 18 U. S. C. ยง 3575(e).  
This language may be useful in interpreting other sections of the Act.  Cf.  Iannelli v. United States, 420 U.S. 770, 789 (1975)."
1035,15," Such damages include, but are not limited to, the sort of competitive injury for which the dissenters would allow recovery.  See 
post, at 521-522.  Under the dissent's reading of the statute, the harm proximately caused by the forbidden conduct is not 
compensable, but that ultimately and indirectly flowing therefrom is.  We reject this topsy-turvy approach, finding no warrant in 
the language or the history of the statute for denying recovery thereunder to ""the direct victims of the [racketeering] activity,"" 
post, at 522, while preserving it for the indirect.  Even the court below was not that grudging.  It would apparently have allowed 
recovery for both the direct and the ultimate harm flowing from the defendant's conduct, requiring injury ""not simply caused by 
the predicate acts, but also caused by an activity which RICO was designed to deter."" 741 F.2d, at 496 (emphasis added). The dissent would also go further than did the Second Circuit in its requirement that the plaintiff have suffered a competitive 
injury.  Again, as the court below stated, Congress ""nowhere suggested that actual anticompetitive effect is required for suits 
under the statute."" Ibid.  The language it chose, allowing recovery to ""[any] person injured in his business or property,"" ยง 1964(c) 
(emphasis added), applied to this situation, suggests that the statute is not so limited. "
1036,16," The ABA Task Force found that of the 270 known civil RICO cases at the trial court level, 40% involved securities fraud, 37% 
common-law fraud in a commercial or business setting, and only 9% ""allegations of criminal activity of a type generally 
associated with professional criminals."" ABA Report, at 55-56.  Another survey of 132 published decisions found that 57 involved 
securities transactions and 38 commercial and contract disputes, while no other category made it into double figures.  American

1041,1," Section 1964(c) provides: ""Any person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any 
appropriate United States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit, including a 
reasonable attorney's fee."" Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U. S. C. ยง 15, provides in relevant part: ""[Any] person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue 
therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, without 
respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover three-fold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including 
a reasonable attorney's fee."" "
1046,2," The analysis in my dissent would lead to the dismissal of the civil RICO claims at stake here.  I thus do not need to decide 
whether a civil RICO action can proceed only after a criminal conviction.  See ante, at 488-493. "
1047,1," The Court says these suits are not being brought against the ""archetypal, intimidating mobster"" because of a ""defect"" that is 
""inherent in the statute."" Ante, at 499.  If RICO must be construed as the Court holds, this is indeed a defect that Congress never 
intended.  I do not believe that the statute must be construed in what in effect is an irrational manner."
1047,2," The force of this observation is accented by RICO's provision for treble damages -- an enticing invitation to litigate these claims 
in federal courts. "
1049,3," As noted in the ABA Report, of the 270 District Court RICO decisions prior to this year, only 3% (9 cases) were decided 
throughout the entire decade of the 1970's, whereas 43% (116 cases) were decided in 1984.  ABA Report, at 53a (Table).  See

1059,6," The National Register states in its preface, ""The List is not, nor does it claim to be inclusive of all psychologists who meet the

1077,1," The reasons advanced included concerns that such diversion would interfere with the Japanese trade policy of voluntarily 
limiting imports to the United States, App. 143, 177-178; that the Soler-ordered vehicles would be unsuitable for use in certain 
proposed destinations because of their manufacture, with use in Puerto Rico in mind, without heaters and defoggers, id., at 182; 
that the vehicles would be unsuitable for use in Latin America because of the unavailability there of the unleaded, high-octane 
fuel they required, id., at 177, 181-182; that adequate warranty service could not be ensured, id., at 176, 182; and that diversion 
to the mainland would violate contractual obligations between CISA and Mitsubishi, id., at 144, 183. "
1078,2," The complaint alleged that Soler had failed to pay for 966 ordered vehicles; that it had failed to pay contractual ""distress unit 
penalties,"" intended to reimburse Mitsubishi for storage costs and interest charges incurred because of Soler's failure to take

that Soler had failed to obtain required financing; and that the Distributor and Sales Agreements had expired by their terms or, 
alternatively, that Soler had surrendered its rights under the Sales Agreement. Id., at 11-14."
1078,3," Section 4 provides in pertinent part: HN1[
] ""A party aggrieved by the alleged failure, neglect, or refusal of another to arbitrate under a written agreement for 
arbitration may petition any United States district court which, save for such agreement, would have jurisdiction under title 28, in 
a civil action or in admiralty of the subject matter of a suit arising out of the controversy between the parties, for an order 
directing that such arbitration proceed in the manner provided for in such agreement. . . .  The court shall hear the parties, and 
upon being satisfied that the making of the agreement for arbitration or the failure to comply therewith is not in issue, the court 
shall make an order directing the parties to proceed to arbitration in accordance with the terms of the agreement."" Section 201 provides: HN2[
] ""The Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards of June 10, 
1958, shall be enforced in United States courts in accordance with this chapter."" Article II of the Convention, in turn, provides: ""1. Each Contracting State shall recognize an agreement in writing under which the parties undertake to submit to arbitration all 
or any differences which have arisen or which may arise between them in respect of a defined legal relationship, whether 
contractual or not, concerning a subject matter capable of settlement by arbitration. . . . . ""3. The court of a Contracting State, when seized of an action in a matter in respect of which the parties have made an 
agreement within the meaning of this article, shall, at the request of one of the parties, refer the parties to arbitration, unless it 
finds that the said agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed."" 21 U.S.T., at 2519. Title 9 U. S. C. ยง 203 confers jurisdiction on the district courts of the United States over an action falling under the Convention."
1078,4, Mitsubishi also sought an order against threatened litigation.  App. 15-16.
1078,5," The alleged breaches included wrongful refusal to ship ordered vehicles and necessary parts, failure to make payment for 
warranty work and authorized rebates, and bad faith in establishing minimum-sales volumes.  Id., at 97-101."
1078,6," The fourth counterclaim alleged that Mitsubishi had made statements that defamed Soler's good name and business reputation 
to a company with which Soler was then negotiating the sale of its plant and distributorship.  Id., at 96.  The sixth counterclaim 
alleged that Mitsubishi had made a willfully false and malicious statement in an affidavit submitted in support of its application for 
a temporary restraining order, and that Mitsubishi had wrongfully advised Soler's customers and the public in its market area that 
they should no longer do business with Soler.  Id., at 98-99. "
1079,7," The District Court found that the arbitration clause did not cover the fourth and sixth counterclaims, which sought damages for 
defamation, see n. 6, supra, or the allegations in the seventh counterclaim concerning discriminatory treatment and the 
establishment of minimum-sales volumes.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 83-1569, pp. B10-B11.  Accordingly, it retained 
jurisdiction over those portions of the litigation.  In addition, because no arbitration agreement between Soler and CISA existed, 
the court retained jurisdiction, insofar as they sought relief from CISA, over the first, second, third, and ninth counterclaims, 
which raised claims under the Puerto Rico Dealers' Contracts Act, the federal Automobile Dealers' Day in Court Act, the 
Sherman Act, and the Puerto Rico competition statute, respectively.  Id., at B12.  These aspects of the District Court's ruling 
were not appealed and are not before this Court."
1079,8," Soler relied on P.R. Laws Ann., Tit. 10, ยง 278b-2 (Supp. 1983), which purports to render null and void ""[any] stipulation that 
obligates a dealer to adjust, arbitrate or litigate any controversy that comes up regarding his dealer's contract outside of Puerto 
Rico, or under foreign law or rule of law."" See Walborg Corp. v. Superior Court, 104 P.R.R. 258 (1975). The Court of Appeals 
held this provision pre-empted by 9 U. S. C. ยง 2, which declares arbitration agreements valid and enforceable ""save upon such 
grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract."" 723 F.2d, at 158. See Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 
U.S. 1 (1984). See also Ledee v. Ceramiche Ragno, 684 F.2d 184 (CA1 1982). Soler does not challenge this holding in its 
cross-petition here."
1079,9," As the Court of Appeals saw it, ""[the] question . . . is not whether the arbitration clause mentions antitrust or any other particular 
cause of action, but whether the factual allegations underlying Soler's counterclaims -- and Mitsubishi's bona fide defenses to 
those counterclaims -- are within the scope of the arbitration clause, whatever the legal labels attached to those allegations."" 723 
F.2d, at 159. Because Soler's counterclaim under the Puerto Rico Dealers' Contracts Act focused on Mitsubishi's alleged failure 
to comply with the provisions of the Sales Agreement governing delivery of automobiles, and those provisions were found in that 
portion of Article I of the Agreement subject to arbitration, the Court of Appeals placed this first counterclaim within the arbitration 
clause. Id., at 159-160. The court read the Sherman Act counterclaim to raise issues of wrongful termination of Soler's distributorship, wrongful failure to 
ship ordered parts and vehicles, and wrongful refusal to permit transshipment of stock to the United States and Latin America.  
Because the existence of just cause for termination turned on Mitsubishi's allegations that Soler had breached the Sales 
Agreement by, for example, failing to pay for ordered vehicles, the wrongful termination claim implicated at least three provisions 
within the arbitration clause: Article I-D(1), which rendered a dealer's orders ""firm""; Article I-E, which provided for ""distress unit 
penalties"" where the dealer prevented timely shipment; and Article I-F, specifying payment obligations and procedures.  The "
1080,," court therefore held the arbitration clause to cover this dispute.  Because the nonshipment claim implicated Soler's obligation 
under Article I-F to proffer acceptable credit, the court found this dispute covered as well.  And because the transshipment claim 
prompted Mitsubishi defenses concerning the suitability of vehicles manufactured to Soler's specifications for use in different 
locales and Soler's inability to provide warranty service to transshipped products, it implicated Soler's obligation under Article IV, 
another covered provision, to make use of Mitsubishi's trademarks in a manner that would not dilute Mitsubishi's reputation and 
goodwill or damage its name and reputation.  The court therefore found the arbitration agreement also to include this dispute, 
noting that such trademark concerns ""are relevant to the legality of territorially based restricted distribution arrangements of the 
sort at issue here."" 723 F.2d, at 160-161, citing Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S. 36 (1977). The Court of Appeals read the federal Automobile Dealers' Day in Court Act claim to raise issues as to Mitsubishi's good faith in 
establishing minimum-sales volumes and Mitsubishi's alleged attempt to coerce Soler into accepting replacement by a Mitsubishi 
subsidiary.  It agreed with the District Court's conclusion, in which Mitsubishi acquiesced, that the arbitration clause did not reach 
the first issue; it found the second, arising from Soler's payment problems, to restate claims already found to be covered.  723 
F.2d, at 161. Finally, the Court of Appeals found the antitrust claims under Puerto Rico law entirely to reiterate claims elsewhere stated; 
accordingly, it held them arbitrable to the same extent as their counterparts.  Ibid."
1080,10," Soler suggests that the court thereby declared antitrust claims arising under Puerto Rico law nonarbitrable as well.  We read 
the Court of Appeals' opinion to have held only the federal antitrust claims nonarbitrable. See id., at 157 (""principal issue on this 
appeal is whether arbitration of federal antitrust claims may be compelled under the Federal Arbitration Act""); id., at 161 (""major 
question in this appeal is whether the antitrust issues raised by Soler's third counterclaim [grounded on Sherman Act] are subject 
to arbitration"").  In any event, any contention that the local antitrust claims are nonarbitrable would be foreclosed by this Court's 
decision in Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U.S., at 10, where we held that the Federal Arbitration Act ""withdrew the power of 
the states to require a judicial forum for the resolution of claims which the contracting parties agreed to resolve by arbitration."""
1080,11," In this Court, Soler suggests for the first time that Congress intended that claims under the federal Automobile Dealers' Day in 
Court Act be nonarbitrable. Brief for Respondent and Cross-Petitioner 21, n. 12.  Because Soler did not raise this question in the 
Court of Appeals or present it in its cross-petition, we do not address it here."
1080,12," Following entry of the District Court's judgment, both it and the Court of Appeals denied motions by Soler for a stay pending 
appeal.  The parties accordingly commenced preparation for the arbitration in Japan.  Upon remand from the Court of Appeals, 
however, Soler withdrew the antitrust claims from the arbitration tribunal and sought a stay of arbitration pending the completion 
of the judicial proceedings on the ground that the antitrust claims permeated the claims that remained before that tribunal. The 
District Court denied the motion, instead staying its own proceedings pending the arbitration in Japan.  The arbitration 
recommenced, but apparently came to a halt once again in September 1984 upon the filing by Soler of a petition for 
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U. S. C. ยง 1101 et seq. "
1081,13," We therefore have no reason to review the Court of Appeals' construction of the scope of the arbitration clause in the light of 
the allegations of Soler's counterclaims. See n. 9, supra; Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U.S., at 15, n. 7. Soler does suggest that, because the title of the clause referred only to ""certain matters,"" App. 52, and the clause itself 
specifically referred only to ""Articles I-B through V,"" ibid., it should be read narrowly to exclude the statutory claims.  Soler 
ignores the inclusion within those ""certain matters"" of ""[all] disputes, controversies or differences which may arise between 
[Mitsubishi] and [Soler] out of or in relation to [the specified provisions] or for the breach thereof."" Contrary to Soler's suggestion, 
the exclusion of some areas of possible dispute from the scope of an arbitration clause does not serve to restrict the reach of an 
otherwise broad clause in the areas in which it was intended to operate.  Thus, insofar as the allegations underlying the statutory 
claims touch matters covered by the enumerated articles, the Court of Appeals properly resolved any doubts in favor of 
arbitrability. See 723 F.2d, at 159."
1081,14," The Court previously has explained that the Act was designed to overcome an anachronistic judicial hostility to agreements to 
arbitrate, which American courts had borrowed from English common law.  See Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, 470 U.S. 
213, 219-221, and n. 6 (1985); Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., 417 U.S. 506, 510, and n. 4 (1974). "
1082,15," The claims whose arbitrability was at issue in Southland Corp. arose under the disclosure requirements of the California 
Franchise Investment Law, Cal. Corp. Code Ann. ยง 31000 et seq. (West 1977).  While the dissent in Southland Corp. disputed 
the applicability of the Act to proceedings in the state courts, it did not object to the Court's reading of the arbitration clause 
under examination. "

on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) (1976), reprinted in 2 Yearbook Commercial Arbitration 167 (1977)."
1085,18," See Craig, Park, & Paulsson, supra, ยง 12.03, p. 28; Sanders, Commentary on UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules ยง 15.1, in 2 
Yearbook Commercial Arbitration, supra, at 203. We are advised by Mitsubishi and amicus International Chamber of Commerce, without contradiction by Soler, that the 
arbitration panel selected to hear the parties' claims here is composed of three Japanese lawyers, one a former law school dean, 
another a former judge, and the third a practicing attorney with American legal training who has written on Japanese antitrust 
law.  Brief for Petitioner in No. 83-1569, p. 26; Brief for International Chamber of Commerce as Amicus Curiae 16, n. 28. The Court of Appeals was concerned that international arbitrators would lack ""experience with or exposure to our law and 
values."" 723 F.2d, at 162. The obstacles confronted by the arbitration panel in this case, however, should be no greater than 
those confronted by any judicial or arbitral tribunal required to determine foreign law.  See, e. g., Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 44.1.  
Moreover, while our attachment to the antitrust laws may be stronger than most, many other countries, including Japan, have 
similar bodies of competition law.  See, e. g., 1 Law of Transnational Business Transactions, ch. 9 (Banks, Antitrust Aspects of 
International Business Operations), ยง 9.03[7] (V. Nanda ed. 1984); H. Iyori & A. Uesugi, The Antimonopoly Laws of Japan 
(1983). "
1086,19," In addition to the clause providing for arbitration before the Japan Commercial Arbitration Association, the Sales Agreement 
includes a choice-of-law clause which reads: ""This Agreement is made in, and will be governed by and construed in all respects 
according to the laws of the Swiss Confederation as if entirely performed therein."" App. 56.  The United States raises the 
possibility that the arbitral panel will read this provision not simply to govern interpretation of the contract terms, but wholly to 
displace American law even where it otherwise would apply.  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 20.  The International 
Chamber of Commerce opines that it is ""[conceivable], although we believe it unlikely, [that] the arbitrators could consider Soler's 
affirmative claim of anticompetitive conduct by CISA and Mitsubishi to fall within the purview of this choice-of-law provision, with 
the result that it would be decided under Swiss law rather than the U.S. Sherman Act."" Brief for International Chamber of 
Commerce as Amicus Curiae 25.  At oral argument, however, counsel for Mitsubishi conceded that American law applied to the 
antitrust claims and represented that the claims had been submitted to the arbitration panel in Japan on that basis.  Tr. of Oral. 
Arg. 18.  The record confirms that before the decision of the Court of Appeals the arbitral panel had taken these claims under 
submission.  See District Court Order of May 25, 1984, pp. 2-3. We therefore have no occasion to speculate on this matter at this stage in the proceedings, when Mitsubishi seeks to enforce 
the agreement to arbitrate, not to enforce an award.  Nor need we consider now the effect of an arbitral tribunal's failure to take 
cognizance of the statutory cause of action on the claimant's capacity to reinitiate suit in federal court.  We merely note that in 
the event the choice-of-forum and choice-of-law clauses operated in tandem as a prospective waiver of a party's right to pursue 
statutory remedies for antitrust violations, we would have little hesitation in condemning the agreement as against public policy.  
See, e. g., Redel's Inc. v. General Electric Co., 498 F.2d 95, 98-99 (CA5 1974); Gaines v. Carrollton Tobacco Board of Trade, 
Inc., 386 F.2d 757, 759 (CA6 1967); Fox Midwest Theatres v. Means, 221 F.2d 173, 180 (CA8 1955). Cf.  Lawlor v. National 
Screen Service Corp., 349 U.S. 322, 329 (1955). See generally 15 S. Williston, Contracts ยง 1750A (3d ed. 1972). "
1087,20," See n. 19, supra.  We note, for example, that the rules of the Japan Commercial Arbitration Association provide for the taking 
of a ""summary record"" of each hearing, Rule 28.1; for the stenographic recording of the proceedings where the tribunal so 
orders or a party requests one, Rule 28.2; and for a statement of reasons for the award unless the parties agree otherwise, Rule 
36.1(4).  See App. 219 and 221. Needless to say, we intimate no views on the merits of Soler's antitrust claims."
1087,21," We do not quarrel with the Court of Appeals' conclusion that Art. II(1) of the Convention, which requires the recognition of 
agreements to arbitrate that involve ""subject matter capable of settlement by arbitration,"" contemplates exceptions to arbitrability 
grounded in domestic law.  See 723 F.2d, at 164-166; G. Gaja, International Commercial Arbitration: New York Convention I. B.2 
(1984); A. van den Berg, The New York Convention of 1958: Towards a Uniform Judicial Interpretation 152-154 (1981); Contini, 
International Commercial Arbitration: The United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral 
Awards, 8 Am. J. Comp. L. 283, 296 (1959). But see Van den Berg, supra, at 154, and n. 98 (collecting contrary authorities); 
Gaja, supra, at I.D., n. 43 (same).  And it appears that before acceding to the Convention the Senate was advised by a State 
Department memorandum that the Convention provided for such exceptions.  See S. Exec. Doc. E, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 19 
(1968). In acceding to the Convention the Senate restricted its applicability to commercial matters, in accord with Art. I(3).  See 21 
U.S.T., at 2519, 2560. Yet in implementing the Convention by amendment to the Federal Arbitration Act, Congress did not 
specify any matters it intended to exclude from its scope.  See Act of July 31, 1970, Pub. L. 91-368, 84 Stat. 692, codified at 9 U. 
S. C. ยงยง 201-208.  In Scherk, this Court recited Art. II(1), including the language relied upon by the Court of Appeals, but paid 
heed to the Convention delegates' ""frequently [voiced] concern that courts of signatory countries in which an agreement to 
arbitrate is sought to be enforced should not be permitted to decline enforcement of such agreements on the basis of parochial 
views of their desirability or in a manner that would diminish the mutually binding nature of the agreements."" 417 U.S., at 520, n. 
15, citing G. Haight, Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards: Summary Analysis of Record 
of United Nations Conference, May/June 1958, pp. 24-28 (1958).  There, moreover, the Court dealt, arguendo, with an exception 
to arbitrability grounded in express congressional language; here, in contrast, we face a judicially implied exception.  The utility 
of the Convention in promoting the process of international commercial arbitration depends upon the willingness of national 
courts to let go of matters they normally would think of as their own.  Doubtless, Congress may specify categories of claims it 
wishes to reserve for decision by our own courts without contravening this Nation's obligations under the Convention. But we 
decline to subvert the spirit of the United States' accession to the Convention by recognizing subject-matter exceptions where 
Congress has not expressly directed the courts to do so. "

commentary written shortly after the statute was passed: ""Not all questions arising out of contracts ought to be arbitrated.  It is a remedy peculiarly suited to the disposition of the ordinary 
disputes between merchants as to questions of fact -- quantity, quality, time of delivery, compliance with terms of payment, 
excuses for non-performance, and the like.  It has a place also in the determination of the simpler questions of law -- the 
questions of law which arise out of these daily relations between merchants as to the passage of title, the existence of 
warranties, or the questions of law which are complementary to the questions of fact which we have just mentioned."" Cohen & 
Dayton, The New Federal Arbitration Law, 12 Va. L. Rev. 265, 281 (1926). In the Prima Paint case the Court held that the Act applied to a claim of fraud in the inducement of the contract, but did not 
intimate that it might also cover federal statutory claims.  See n. 9, Supra."
1091,12," ""The dispute between these parties over the alleged shortage in defendant's inventory of European trademarks, a matter 
covered by contract warranties and subject to pre-closing verification, is the kind of commercial dispute for which arbitration is 
entirely appropriate.  In my opinion, the fact that the 'fraud' language of Rule 10(b)(5) has been included in the complaint is far 
less significant than the desirability of having the Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris, France, 
decide the various questions of foreign law which should determine the rights of these parties."" Alberto-Culver Co. v. Scherk,

1092,14," ""Moreover, the factfinding process in arbitration usually is not equivalent to judicial factfinding.  The record of the arbitration

as discovery, compulsory process, cross-examination, and testimony under oath, are often severely limited or unavailable.  See 
Bernhardt v. Polygraphic Co., 350 U.S. 198, 203 (1956); Wilko v. Swan, 346 U.S., at 435-437. And as this Court has recognized, 
'[arbitrators] have no obligation to the court to give their reasons for an award.' United Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise

1094,21," ""We have often indicated the inappropriateness of invoking broad common-law barriers to relief where a private suit serves 
important public purposes.  It was for this reason that we held in Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Seagram & Sons, 340 U.S. 211 (1951), 
that a plaintiff in an antitrust suit could not be barred from recovery by proof that he had engaged in an unrelated conspiracy to 
commit some other antitrust violation.  Similarly, in Simpson v. Union Oil Co., 377 U.S. 13 (1964), we held that a dealer whose 
consignment agreement was canceled for failure to adhere to a fixed resale price could bring suit under the antitrust laws even 
though by signing the agreement he had to that extent become a participant in the illegal, competition-destroying scheme.  Both 
Simpson and Kiefer-Stewart were premised on a recognition that the purposes of the antitrust laws are best served by insuring 
that the private action will be an ever-present threat to deter anyone contemplating business behavior in violation of the antitrust 
laws. The plaintiff who reaps the reward of treble damages may be no less morally reprehensible than the defendant, but the law 
encourages his suit to further the overriding public policy in favor of competition.  A more fastidious regard for the relative moral 
worth of the parties would only result in seriously undermining the usefulness of the private action as a bulwark of antitrust 
enforcement.  And permitting the plaintiff to recover a windfall gain does not encourage continued violations by those in his 
position since they remain fully subject to civil and criminal penalties for their own illegal conduct."" Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v.

contract issues may or may not be within the scope of the arbitration clauses in the coinsurance and second marketing

issues, however, are nonarbitrable in just that sense.  Applied Digital Technology, Inc. v. Continental Casualty Co., 576 F.2d 
116, 117 (7th Cir. 1978). They are considered to be at once too difficult to be decided competently by arbitrators -- who are not

Safety Equipment Corp. v. J. P. Maguire & Co., 391 F.2d 821, 826-27 (2d Cir. 1968). The root of the doctrine is in the same soil

have nevertheless enforced arbitration agreements to settle an existing antitrust claim. Ante, at 633.  These settlement 
agreements, made after the parties have had every opportunity to evaluate the strength of their position, are obviously less 
destructive of the private treble-damages remedy that Congress provided.  Thus, it may well be that arbitration as a means of 
settling existing disputes is permissible. "
1097,34," Indeed, it has been argued that a state may refuse to enforce an agreement to arbitrate a subject matter which is nonarbitrable 
in domestic law under Article II(3) as well as under Article II(1).  Since awards rendered under such agreements need not be 
enforced under Article V(2) the agreement is ""incapable of being performed."" Art. II(3).  S. Exec. Doc. E, 90th Cong., 2d Sess.,

true amounts when known. "
1116,1," The ruling on these issues was delayed by the court pending the issuance of controlling decision by the Supreme Court and 
Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. "
1121,2," HN7[
] The Fourteenth Amendment states in pertinent part: No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall 
any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction 
the equal protection of the laws."
1121,3," HN8[
]  42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 states: "
1122,," Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of 
Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to 
the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in 
an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress. "
1143,1," In its amended complaint plaintiff added recently incorporated Memorial Medical Center, Inc. as a party defendant. Id. at 3, 
para. 6A. MMC Inc. is currently operating Memorial Medical Center under a long-term lease. Id. at paras. 37A-C. For 
convenience, the Court will refer to this and the other defendants as ""MMC."" In addition, the Court will refer only to the amended 
complaint in this Order, since it incorporates all of the original complaint."
1143,2," See O.C.G.A. ยง 31-6-1 (state regulatory scheme is designed to ensure that health care ""facilities should be provided in a 
manner that avoids unnecessary duplication of services, that is cost effective, and that is compatible with the health care needs 
of the various areas and populations of the state."")."
1143,3," See O.C.G.A. para. 31-6-40, et seq. (Any person proposing to develop new health services in Georgia must apply for a CON; 
CON applications are filed with the State Health Planning Agency (SHPA); interested parties may submit information in writing to 
SHPA concerning an application under review; appeals are made to the State Health Planning Review Board, whose decisions 
are subject to judicial review. See, e.g., St. Joseph's I, supra; see also State Health Planning Review Board v. Piedmont 
Hospital, 173 Ga. App. 450, 326 S.E.2d 814 (1985)."
1143,4," HN2[
] O.C.G.A. para. 31-6-43(e) (Michie 1984) specifies that ""any interested person may submit information to the [SHPA] 
concerning an application, and an applicant shall be entitled to notice of and to respond to any such submission."""
1143,5," In one of its briefs, plaintiff refers to a second ""misrepresentation"" letter from MMC to the SHPA. For reasons explained infra, 
this letter will not be considered. "
1145,6," The above-mentioned January, 1984 ""misrepresentation letter from MMC to the SHPA is cited as another example of MMC's 
bad faith activities.  Other examples are described in the complaint at paras. 37-38. St. Joseph's also alludes to other bad faith, 
conspiratorial actions which have been ""concealed"" and which it intends to prove at trial. Id., at para. 39.  Plaintiff concludes that 
all of the defendants' actions were designed to protect MMC from the threat of competition in the medical care market. Id., at 
para. 40. These actions, according to plaintiff, have been effective in restraining competition in the health care market. Id., at 
paras. 41-42. "
1147,7," Although not alleged in its complaint, plaintiff further specifies in a response brief that in this letter MMC deliberately inflated its 
capacity for performing cardiac surgery procedures so that SHPA would conclude that plaintiff's proposed services would 
unjustifiably duplicate same.  Plaintiff's First Response Brief at 7. In its Supplemental Response Brief at 3, n.1, plaintiff asserts 
that ""SHPA accepted at face value [MMC's] representation that it had capacity to perform 1560 cardiac surgery procedures a 
year. Yet at the court-ordered appellate hearing before the [Review Board, MMC's] own expert witness could only support a 
capacity . . . of less than half the 1560 number. See Transcript of Hearing at pp. 1180-81."" Because of the reasoning below, it is 
not necessary for the Court to rely on this information in disposing of the instant motions."
1147,8," MMC maintains that plaintiff's ""misrepresentation"" pleading fails to satisfy the requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b). This is not a 
fraud case.  Plaintiff only alleges misrepresentation as part of its ""sham exception"" pleading burden, not to recover on a fraud "
1148,," claim. Furthermore, even were Rule 9(b) read to apply to plaintiff's pleading burden, it is significant that HN7[
] ""it must not be read to abrogate rule 8, . . . and a court considering a motion to dismiss for failure to plead fraud with particularity should always 
be careful to harmonize the directives of rule 9(b) with the broad policy of notice pleading."" Nims, supra, 755 F.2d at 813 n.3; see 
also Reconsidering Federal Civil Rule 9(b), 104 F.R.D. 143, 177-180 (1985). The ""clear intent [of Rule 9(b)] is to eliminate fraud 
actions in which all the facts are learned through discovery after the complaint is filed."" Nims, at 813 n.3. (emphasis added). In 
the instant case, the misrepresentations are alleged to already have been learned, and they are pleaded in reference to MMC's 
letter to the SHPA. Defendants have not demonstrated that the complaint itself was intended merely to serve as a device to 
unearth possible misrepresentations. Further, the Court sees little reason to deviate from the standard of HN8[
] Rule 8, which does not require a detailed statement of facts, but only ""a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief. . . ."" However, it cannot be 
overlooked that conclusory statements of sham conduct can supply relative ease in the composition of an antitrust complaint 
against a competitor, especially in the aftermath of a competitor's appearance before a state agency. In so doing, a plaintiff can 
both chill a competitor's First Amendment rights and inject irony into the invocation of the sham exception. See Bethlehem Plaza 
v. Campbell, 403 F. Supp. 966 (E.D.Pa. 1975). It is in that context that this Court harbors no objection to making short shrift of 
conclusory allegations, especially those of sham conduct. Moreover, in view of the Court's obligation to strictly construe the 
sham exception, Mid-Texas Communications, supra, Rule 8 in this context is not offended by requiring plaintiff to make 
allegations containing clearly stated explanations of what the defendants did and how those actions produced an abusive effect 
on the government machinery in question.  Hydro-Tech Corp. v. Sundstrand Corp., 673 F.2d 1171, 1177 n.8 (10th Cir. 1982); 
Spanish Intern. Communications Corp. v. Leibowitz, 608 F. Supp. 178 (S.D. Fla. 1985); Caplan v. American Baby, Inc., 582 F. 
Supp. 869, 871 (S.D.N.Y. 1984); see also City of Gainesville v. Florida Power & Light Co., 488 F. Supp. 1258, 1266-67 (S.D.Fla. 
1980): P. Areeda, Antitrust Law, ยง 203.4b (1982 Supp.); 24 Fed Proc, L. Ed ยงยง 54:236, 242 (1984). "
1149,9," This is not to suggest that the mere showing of a single, meritless lawsuit will suffice for sham exception purposes. Indeed, ""the 
right to pursue a claim in a state court action would be unduly impaired if the state court plaintiff had to be subjected to 
protracted pre-trial discovery and perhaps even trial in an antitrust suit [or counterclaim] before the antitrust immunity of his state 
court suit was established."" Mountain Grove Cemetery v. Norwalk Vault Co., 428 F. Supp. 951, 956 (D.Conn. 1977). On the 
other hand, a large company can deliver a financial ""knock-out punch"" to a fledgling competitor by bringing one single but 
baseless and expensive action against it. See National Cash Register Corp.v. Arnett, 554 F. Supp. 1176, 1178 (D.Colo. 1983). 
HN11[
] Each case, therefore, must turn on its own facts and circumstances. See, e.g., Omni Resource, supra, 739 F.2d at"
1149,1414," (""When the antitrust plaintiff challenges one suit and not a pattern, a finding of sham requires not only that the suit is 
baseless, but also that it has other characteristics of grave abuse, such as being coupled with actions or effects external to the 
suit that are themselves anti-competitive.""); see also Hydro-Tech, supra, 673 F.2d at 1177 (Mere filing of a lawsuit without 
probable cause is not enough to support sham exception; ""[a] sham action is one which tends to be abusive of the judicial 
processes and, therefore, is something more than an action instituted without probable cause."")."
1149,10," Relatedly, mere factual exaggerations that normally accompany zealous advocacy in a legal process should not ordinarily be 
elevated to ""sham misrepresentation"" where it is not alleged that they in some way figured into a gross abuse of, as opposed to 
a mere drag on, the governmental process in question. To permit otherwise would enable antitrust litigants to ""overcome the 
doctrine that litigation, as a general rule, is protected by the First Amendment and is thus immune from antitrust challenge."" 
Omni Resource, 739 F.2d at 1413. Remedies for bad faith misrepresentations and meritless litigation before courts already exist 
in a variety of contexts within both federal and state court systems. See, e.g., Lipsig v. National Student Mktg. Corp., 214 U.S. 
App. D.C. 1, 663 F.2d 178, 181 (D.C.Cir. 1980) (parties sanctioned for misleading the court by misquoting or omitting material 
portions of documentary evidence); Fed.R.Civ.P. 11; Sanctions Under the New Federal Rule 11 - A Closer Look, 104 F.R.D. 181 
(1985); see also In re Beard, 742 F.2d 1465 (11th Cir. 1984) (unpublished decision) (Affirming this Court's Order suspending 
from practice before this Court an attorney who made unfounded allegations and factual misrepresentations over the course of 
various lawsuits); Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U.S. 240, 258-59, 44 L. Ed. 2d 141, 95 S. Ct. 1612 "
1150,," (1975); Beard v. Annis, 730 F.2d 741 (11th Cir. 1984) (attorney's fees awarded under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988 to defendant against 
plaintiff for bringing a frivolous, baseless lawsuit); Hubby v. Historic Savannah Foundation, 623 F. Supp. 637 (S.D.Ga. 1985) 
(Granting civil rights defendants' motion for $34,627.34 in attorney's fees and costs against pro se plaintiff for maintaining 
frivolous litigation); Van Berkel v. Fox Farm & Road Machinery, 581 F. Supp. 1248 (D.Minn. 1984) (Fed.R.Civ.P. 11 sanction 
imposed on plaintiff's attorney for failure to make reasonable inquiry regarding statute of limitations period before filing products 
liability action); accord, Wells v. Oppenheimer & Co., 101 F.R.D. 358 (S.D.N.Y. 1984); 28 U.S.C. ยง 1927; Karsman v. Portman, 
173 Ga.  App. 108, 325 S.E.2d 608 (1984); Florida Rock Industries, Inc. v. Smith, 163 Ga. App. 361, 294 S.E.2d 553 (1982); 72 
ALR Fed 724 (1985). Of course, this does not mean that misrepresentations which are so abusive that they subvert administrative, adjudicative and 
other judicial decision-making processes cannot be used to support a federal antitrust claim simply because other remedies exist 
to address the misrepresentations. Woods Exploration & Pro. Co. v. Aluminum Co. of Amer., 438 F.2d 1286, 1296 (5th Cir. 
1971). Misrepresentations within the judicial process are more significant than in the political process, as judicial/adjudicative 
bodies often must rely on a party's representations, Woods, while political bodies by nature are better equipped to tolerate 
impurities. The Trucking Unlimited Court made it clear that activity which is acceptable in the political arena does not necessarily 
retain its Noerr-Pennington immunity when it is used in the judicial process.  404 U.S. at 513."
1150,11," It is true that the Woods Court at this point was addressing the defendants' argument that since their production forecasts 
became a part of the commission's final production orders, plaintiff's alleged injury was solely the result of state action, which 
itself was exempt from the Sherman Act under Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 87 L. Ed. 315, 63 S. Ct. 307 (1947). 438 F.2d at "
1151,1293," . However, the Woods Court further found ""Noerr-Pennington [immunity] inapplicable to the alleged filing of false 
[information] . . . by defendants because this conduct was not action designed to influence policy. . . ."" 438 F.2d at 1298; see 
also Israel v. Baxter Laboratories, Inc., 151 U.S. App. D.C. 101, 466 F.2d 272, 275-279 (D.C.Cir. 1972). Furthermore, this Court 
finds such reasoning to be particularly useful in analyzing the instant case."
1151,12," This may be achieved in a variety of ways, and indeed, it may be done constructively. In many instances a wrongfully obtained 
adverse decision basically puts the losing party in the same position as in the case where that party has been effectively barred 
from access to the decision-making body. In this sense, it may be said that actions designed to bar a competitor's access to 
government decision-making machinery achieve the same (anticompetitive) result as the corruption/usurpation of that machinery 
by misrepresentations, bribery, or other abusive conduct. See Trucking Unlimited, supra, 404 U.S. at 511 (defendants' 
opposition to the plaintiffs' every application before the state commissions, regardless of merit, effectively closed the machinery 
of the agencies to the plaintiffs); Metro Cable Co., supra, 516 F.2d at 232; Racetrac Petroleum, Inc. v. Prince George's County, 
601 F. Supp. 892, 912 (D.Md. 1985) (No access-barring or abuse-of-governmental-process conduct shown). At all times both 
the design and the result revolve around the abuse of a governmental process."
1151,13," There was no need for the Transkentucky court to reach the issue of what minimum quantity of false submissions is necessary 
to support the sham exception, as the particular misrepresentations, combined with the alleged pattern of other abusive conduct 
(i.e., the repetitive, baseless litigation), were enough to justify invocation of the sham exception. Whatever is the minimum 
quantity of fraudulent misconduct, the alleged instances surpassed that in the Transkentucky complaint. "
1152,14," As the Outboard Marine court recognized, HN15[
] ""the administrative law applicable to the proceeding involved is a 
question of law, inquiry into which could be made on a motion to dismiss. . . ."" 474 F. Supp. at 178 n.17. HN16[
] O.C.G.A. ยง"
1152,31," -6-43(e) specifies that ""any interested person may submit information to the [SHPA] concerning an application, and an 
applicant shall be entitled to notice of and to respond to any such submission."""
1152,15," Although it is not necessary to base the instant ruling on the procedural structure of the SHPA proceedings, it cannot be 
overlooked that the legislative scheme behind the SHPA invites comment by ""interested parties"" and invests the SHPA with 
rulemaking powers, see O.C.G.A. ยง 31-6-21(b)(4) (Michie, 1984); see also O.C.G.A. ยง 31-6-43 (Michie, 1982); St.  Joseph's I, 
supra. Both the allegations and the exhibits to the complaint indicate that such powers were used in this case, thus revealing a 
quasi-legislative element in the proceedings. In addition, a major focus of the SHPA's duties was in large part on resource allocation (i.e., assessing area medical needs in 
light of the government policy of hospital cost containment in reference to avoiding costly duplication of services). Consequently, 
complaint exhibit ""B"" itself indicates that the SHPA proceeding was not purely ""adjudicatory,"" focusing only on the resolution of 
rights between the two sides and exclusively on information supplied by those sides, but instead contained a legislative (the 
""New Rule"") element resulting in a governmental policy decision involving the allocation of resources in the Georgia. It is in these "
1153,," circumstances that the special concerns over ""the integrity of the regulatory process"" Israel v. Baxter Laboratories, supra, 466 
F.2d at 278, may not be as heightened and greater adversarial ""breathing space"" is warranted. While the SHPA cannot be precisely equated with the agency in Franchise Realty, supra, 542 F.2d 1076 (Dismissal is more 
readily granted where the alleged sham activity occurs before a non-adjudicatory body because the grant of petitioning immunity 
is more broadly construed in political settings), nevertheless, the thread of reasoning contained in that case is useful here. See 
also P. Areeda, Antitrust Law, ยง 204c at 45-49 (1978); id., ยง 204.1c at 29 (1982 Supp) (Imposing antitrust ""liability [for 
mispresentations] would be least justified where the governmental body is legislative (where almost 'anything goes ') or where 
the proceedings are adversary or the agency is expert or investigative (where statements are challenged)."") id., ยง 204.1d at 30 & 
n.10 (emphasis added), citing Rush Hampton, supra. So viewed, Outboard Marine Corp. v. Pezetel, 474 F. Supp. 168 (D.Del. 1979), provides a useful comparison. In that case a 
Polish golf car manufacturer and its domestic distributor alleged in an antitrust suit counterclaim that a former domestic 
manufacturer combined with others to submit knowingly false information to federal agencies. They further alleged that the false 
information submitted to Treasury Department and Customs Service resulted in the imposition of dumping duties against them.  
As this Court holds in this case, the Outboard Marine court held that the fact that the defendants were not barred from the 
proceedings as a result of plaintiff's conduct did not vitiate the antitrust ""sham exception"" claim.  474 F. Supp. at 176. More 
importantly, however, there was no suggestion that the governmental agencies were engaging in anything more than application 
of regulations to the submitted data. That is, they were not engaged in rulemaking which following a public notice and comment 
period, as apparently occurred in the instant case. Outboard Marine therefore was closer to Woods and Israel, than to Franchise 
Realty, supra.  In contrast, extra latitude would be warranted in the instant case, where the proceedings were public and the 
""New Rule,"" a legislative-type act formulated by the SHPA, served as the primary basis for denial of St.  Joseph's CON 
application both at the SHPA and Review Board levels. See text accompanying notes 4 & 5, supra."
1153,16," Defendants also argue that their initial success before the SHPA negates any inference of sham conduct. See Leibowitz, 
supra, 608 F. Supp. 178. HN18[
] Success or failure of a party's protests before the state agency is regarded as indicative, 
although not singularly determinative, of a party's intent within the meaning of sham exception analysis.  Clipper Express, supra, 
690 F.2d at 1254, citing Hahn, supra, 615 F.2d at 841 n.13; see also Mid-Texas Communications, supra, 615 F.2d at 1383; 
Taylor Drug Stores v. Associated Dry Goods, 560 F.2d 211 (6th Cir. 1977); Areeda, Antitrust Law, ยง 203.1d (1982 Supp.). Although this Court agrees with that reasoning, it is to state the obvious however, that ""success"" achieved by corrupting the 
process producing such result is invalid. In the instant case, there is only a conclusory allegation that the process was corrupted, 
thus invalidating such success.  The specific allegations necessary to support this allegation are, as detailed above, absent from 
the complaint. However, the fact that the defendants initially were successful on the alleged misrepresentation component of the 
SHPA's decision is only probative evidence of their ""non-abuse"" intent, not dispositive. Relatedly, the mere fact that the SHPA 
was later reversed, St. Joseph's I, is irrelevant. See Greenwood Utilities, supra, 751 F.2d at 1500."
1153,17," As discussed in Part II, D, infra, the other alleged acts of the defendants in relation to the Review Board's activities do not rise 
to ""sham exception"" abuse. Also, plaintiff's own allegations make it clear that the injunctive relief requiring the Review Board to 
rule on the merits component of plaintiff's appeal from the SHPA was obtained in response to the Review Board's application of 
the New Rule and not the alleged misrepresentations. "
1154,18," Significantly, no sham conduct is alleged in relation to the State agency's adoption of the ""New Rule."""
1154,19," Although it is not necessary to support this Court's decision, the Court notes in passing plaintiff's letter brief of January 8, 
1985, to which there is appended two State Superior decisions (West Paces Ferry Hospital, Inc. v. SHPA, C.A. D-7076 (Atlanta 
Jud. Cir. Sup. Ct. Aug. 22, 1984) and Piedmont Hospital v. SHPA, C.A. D-08463 (Atlanta Jud. Cir. Sup.  Ct. July 20, 1984)) 
reversing the Review Board for its failure to consider the merits component of CON applications in light of the SHPA's cardiac 
rule (i.e., the ""New Rule.""). These cases reinforce this Court's conclusion that the ""New Rule"" has vitiated whatever causation 
might be shown to exist between the alleged misrepresentations and plaintiff's alleged injuries. "
1155,20," The complaint itself acknowledges that this chairman informed the SHPA that he had represented plaintiff's insurance carrier 
in another legal context and offered the SHPA the opportunity to move to disqualify him.  Complaint at 12, para. 35. "
1156,21," Plaintiff's allegations concerning defendants' involvement in the previously described National Medical Enterprise CON 
proceedings are insufficient. First, no abuse of governmental process is alleged, only permissible conduct within the meaning of 
Trucking Unlimited. Second, no such abuse is pleaded in connection with the alleged abuse in the instant case. In fact, plaintiff's 
complaint alleges that MMC was successful in this endeavor (Complaint at 9, para. 22), and it does not allege that the success 
was the product of defendants' abuse of governmental machinery. Plaintiff's emphasis as to MMC's involvement in the NME 
proceedings at best shows MMC to be a ""neighborhood bully."" As mentioned above, however, in sham exception analysis this 
Court is not to be concerned with unfair or unethical conduct that does not in some reasonably related way center on abuse of 
that government process which directly affects the plaintiff.  Third, plaintiff has failed to respond to this issue in both its response 
and supplemental response to defendant MMC's motion to dismiss. Accordingly, plaintiff concedes this argument. See Local 
Rule 6.2. "
1157,22," The Court recognize[s], of course, the plaintiff's sincere hopes and expectations that the discovery process will yield concrete factual 
data to fill these voids and the principles of notice pleading in the Federal rules, but [the Court] cannot ignore important 
countervailing constitutional principles.  To allow the complaint to stand on the basis of these expectations . . .  would 
certainly deter antitrust violators, but would at the same time seriously endanger the exercise of protected statutory and 
constitutional rights, a result which has been countermanded under Noerr. Bethlehem Plaza v. Campbell, 403 F. Supp. 966, 971 (E.D.Penn. 1975); see also Leibowitz, supra, 608 F. Supp. at 183, citing 
Franchise Realty, supra, 542 F.2d at 1082."
1157,23," In Count Two plaintiff alleges that ""the defendants and coconspirators have engaged in an unlawful combination and 
conspiracy to boycott St.  Joseph's in per se violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. 15 U.S.C. ยง 1."" Amended Complaint at 
23, para. 53 (emphasis added). In its brief of August 31, 1984, at 15, n.12, MMC argued that plaintiff's allegations fail to state a 
claim. More specifically, that plaintiff has alleged no facts showing that the defendants acted in concert with other competitors at 
a specific market level to exclude plaintiff from that market. Nor does plaintiff plead facts showing that defendants engaged in 
efforts with others to disadvantage plaintiff ""by 'either directly denying or persuading or coercing suppliers or [patients] to deny 
relationships the [plaintiff] need[s] in the competitive struggle. '"" Northwest Wholesale Stationers, Inc. v. Pacific Stationery & 
Printing Co., 472 U.S. 284, 105 S. Ct. 2613, 2619, 86 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1985) (citations omitted). At best plaintiff is simply pointing 
to the natural consequences relating to the competitive edge MMC currently enjoys from its position as provider of the cardiac 
services for which plaintiff seeks its CON. By juxtaposing this with the alleged abusive conduct for which no claim has been 
stated, plaintiff somehow attempts to build a boycott claim. Suffice it to say that this is at best a meritless spin off of the sham 
exception argument and therefore no boycott claim is stated. Plaintiff has simply failed to plead facts showing that MMC ""banded 
together with other competitors to protect [itself] from non-group competitors."" Indiana Federation of Dentists v. F.T.C., 745 F.2d 
1124, 1136 (7th Cir. 1984), app. for cert. pending, 54 LW 3007 (July 9, 1985). Additionally, plaintiff has failed to respond to MMC's motion and argument on this point. It is thus unopposed. Local Rule 6.2. 
Therefore, this Count also is dismissed."
1157,24," HN22[
] Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides in pertinent part: Every contact, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the

combination is not unlawful under ยง 1."" Id., 81 L. Ed. 2d at 641 n.13."
1158,25," For convenience, the Court will refer to both HCA and HCAM as ""HCA."""
1158,26," Under the liberal standards of Conley v. Gibson, supra, it might be possible to construe these allegations to include, indirectly, 
the cardiac-surgical market in these allegations, since the NME/West End project to which plaintiff refers might possibly have "
1159,," included a cardiac-surgical element. But this by necessity would involve sheer speculation and is simply too remote a possibility 
to support plaintiff's implicit suggestion that an independent interest exists to invoke the H & B exception."
1159,27," In fact, plaintiff conceded in its December 21, 1984 opposition brief at 6, n.2, that it has not been injured by any defendant's 
conduct in connection with the ""West Side"" project."
1159,28," Relatedly, the allegations concerning the recent incorporation of Memorial Medical Center as the long-term lessee of the 
hospital supply no additional grounds in support of plaintiff's allegations. At best plaintiff alleges that MMC, Inc. joined in the 
latter stages of the litigation in this case, see St. Joseph's I & II, supra, but there are no allegations of conduct not protected by 
the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. Nor are there any ""Copperweld"" allegations. "

1186,1," Minnesota law apparently is applicable to this action, by virtue of the choice of law provision contained in the Agreement. See 
Findings of Fact para. 7, supra. The plaintiff repeatedly has stated that the substantive law of Minnesota applies to its breach of 
contract claim, see Plaintiff's Trial Brief (filed Jan. 3, 1985) at 3; Plaintiff's Post Trial Brief (filed Mar. 7, 1985) at 5, 10; since the 
defendant has never contested this point, it is presumed to agree."
1186,2," Under Minnesota law, see note 1, supra, the parol evidence rule is a rule of substantive law prohibiting the admission of parol 
evidence to vary or contradict the language of a complete and unambiguous written agreement.  RJM Sales & Marketing v. Banfi 
Products Corp., 546 F. Supp. 1368, 1374 n.5 (D. Minn. 1982); Flynn v. Sawyer, 272 N.W.2d 904, 908 (Minn. 1978). Parol 
evidence is admissible to vary or contradict the terms of a written contract if the agreement is incomplete or ambiguous. Id.; see 
also 3 Corbin, Contracts ยง 573, at 357-358 (rev. ed. 1971) (""When two parties have made a contract and have expressed it in a 
writing to which they have both assented as the complete and accurate integration of that contract, evidence, whether parol or 
otherwise, of antecedent understandings and negotiations will not be admitted for the purpose of varying or contradicting the 
writing""). "
1187,3," This disincentive arguably is inconsistent with McKeown's obligation under paragraph 5(E) of the Agreement to ""actively solicit . 
. .  applications by persons and companies to become licensees."" See Pl. Ex. A; Def. Ex. M. "
1188,4," ""Good HN6[
] cause"" for terminating a franchise includes, but is not limited to, ""the franchisee's refusal or failure to comply substantially with any material and reasonable obligation of the franchise agreement."" Conn. Gen. Stat. ยง 42-133f(a). 
McKeown's breach of Paragraph 14 of the Agreement would constitute such a refusal or failure."
1188,5," The parties' election to have the law of Minnesota govern the Agreement, see Findings of Fact para. 7; note 1, supra, does not 
affect the availability to the plaintiff of a claim under the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (""CUTPA""). See R & R 
Associates of Connecticut v. Deltona Corp., Civil No. H 80-240 (D. Conn. May 19, 1982) (oral ruling) (holding that CUTPA claim 
is available to plaintiff despite choice of law provision in agreement specifying applicability of Florida law). The defendant does 
not contend that the choice of law provision has any bearing on the availability in this action of a CUTPA claim. "
1189,6," This conclusion flows from the well-established proposition that, in deciding a question of state HN8[
] law, a federal court 
whose jurisdiction is based upon diversity of citizenship should attempt to ascertain how the relevant state's highest court would 
rule. See Bernhardt v. Polygraphic Co. of America, Inc., 350 U.S. 198, 209, 100 L. Ed. 199, 76 S. Ct. 273 (1956) (Frankfurter, J., 
concurring); Cunninghame v. The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, 652 F.2d 306, 308 (2d Cir. 1981)."
1189,7," Although McKeown does not raise this question, it is arguable that a cause of action under CUTPA may be established by 
proof that a business practice of the defendant has caused a substantial injury to the plaintiff that outweighs the benefits to 
consumers arising from that practice. See McLaughlin Ford, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 192 Conn. 558, 569-571, 473 A.2d 1185, 
1192 (1984) (""McLaughlin""). In apparent dicta in McLaughlin, supra, the Connecticut Supreme Court seemed to suggest that a 
practice may be prohibited by CUTPA even though it meets only one of the criteria identified in FTC v. Sperry & Hutchinson Co., 
405 U.S. 233, 244, 31 L. Ed. 2d 170, 92 S. Ct. 898 n.5 (1972). However, even if this court were convinced that CUTPA prohibits 
an otherwise lawful and fair business practice merely because the practice results in substantial injury to competitors without a 
corresponding benefit to consumers (and that is far from clear), the plaintiff in this case has failed to prove that the injury to the 
plaintiff outweighs the benefits reaped by its former customers as a result of receiving the Gyp-Crete product from Gyp-Crete at 
a substantially lower price than they had been charged by McKeown. See Findings of Fact para. 34, supra. "

1231,9," We decline the request of City of Bell to judicially notice the minutes of certain meetings of the city council on the ground that 
they are not relevant to the issues before us.  We also decline the city's request to impose sanctions on plaintiff pursuant to

frivolous or taken solely for delay . . . ."" ( Code Civ. Proc., ยง 907.) "
1242,1," It is not clear from the record which of the Crow defendants actually owned the 20-acre parcel.  For purposes of this action, 
however, the question is immaterial."
1242,2," Plaintiff did not oppose the motion to dismiss pursuant to former Code of Civil Procedure section 581a, subdivision (a), insofar 
as it related to Gasparian and Simonian. "
1244,3," The courts (see, e.g., In re Airport Car Rental Antitrust Litigation (N.D.Cal. 1979) 474 F. Supp. 1072, 1083-1084) and 
commentators (see, e.g., Fischel, supra, 45 U. Chi. L. Rev. at pp. 87-88) that conclude or suggest that the Noerr-Pennington 
doctrine results from constitutional adjudication rather than statutory interpretation seem misled by California Transport.  In 
considering the applicability of the Noerr-Pennington doctrine to the judicial sphere, California Transport bypasses discussion of 
statutory interpretation to deal immediately with constitutional considerations (404 U.S. at pp. 510-511 [30 L. Ed. 2d at pp. 646-
647]), perhaps because the legislative history of the Sherman Act does not as plainly support the applicability of the doctrine to 
that sphere as it does to the other spheres (see Noerr-Pennington Abroad, supra, 84 Colum. L. Rev. at pp. 1351-1352 [the act 
was intended to protect ""politics . . . and not . . . appeals to nonpolitical government bodies such as courts.""]). "
1245,4," Plaintiff seems to rely on Woods Exploration & Pro. Co. v. Aluminum Co. of Amer. 5th Cir. 1971) 438 F.2d 1286, for the 
proposition that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine is inapplicable to the licensing process.  Whether or not Woods in fact supports 
such a proposition is irrelevant since California Transport is to the contrary (404 U.S. at pp. 509-511 [30 L. Ed. 2d at pp. 645-
646]). "
1248,5," As we judicially notice ( Evid. Code, ยง 452, subd. (d)), Werrlein, Kirwan, and Simonian, among others, were indicted by a 
federal grand jury for mail fraud (18 U.S.C. ยง 1341), owning and conducting an illegal gambling business (id., ยง 1955), interstate 
travel in aid of racketeering enterprises (id., ยง 1952), aiding and abetting (id., ยง 2), and racketeering (id., ยงยง 1962 (a), 1963) -- all 
arising from the alleged conspiracy to legalize and monopolize the operation of poker clubs in the City of Bell and related 
activities.  To date, on guilty pleas Kirwan has been sentenced to six months in a community facility, and Werrlein has been 
sentenced to three years in prison, fined $ 21,000, and ordered to forfeit about $ 400,000 in profits he made from the poker club. "
1250,6," Siciliano v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. (1976) 62 Cal. App. 3d 745 [133 Cal. Rptr. 376] -- the only case on which plaintiff relies -- is 
plainly not to the contrary.  There, as all parties recognized, the plaintiff was legally interested in the contract in question; indeed, 
he was a party to it."
1250,7," Former section 583 was repealed in 1984.  (Stats. 1984, ch. 1705, ยง 4.) The substance of the sentence quoted above is 
continued in Code of Civil Procedure section 583.420, subdivision (a). "
1251,8," Former section 581a was repealed in 1984.  (Stats. 1984, ch. 1705, ยง 3.) The substance of subdivision (a) is continued, with 
changes not material here, in current sections 583.210, 583.220, 583.230, 583.240, 583.250. "
1252,9," We decline the request of City of Bell to judicially notice the minutes of certain meetings of the city council on the ground that 
they are not relevant to the issues before us.  We also decline the city's request to impose sanctions on plaintiff pursuant to 
Code of Civil Procedure section 907: the city does not succeed in showing, nor does it appear to us, ""that the appeal was 
frivolous or taken solely for delay . . . ."" ( Code Civ. Proc., ยง 907.)"
1252,1," This view of course also extends to the other contentions more summarily dealt with in section II, subdivisions A, C, D, E, and F 
of the majority opinion.  My focus on Noerr-Pennington treatment is due to its primacy in the opinion and its novelty. "
1256,1," Jays filed its complaint on Nov. 3, 1978. Frito-Lay argues and Jays concedes that the four-year statute of limitations, 15 U.S.C. 
ยง 15b, bars Jays from recovering damages suffered prior to Nov. 3, 1974."
1256,2," Frito-Lay apparently had more than a 25% share of the potato chip market by mid-1978 (Ex. 23, p. 176905). By the late 1970s 
Jays potato chips outsold Frito-Lay potato chips within Chicago (Ex. 38, p. 168621), but Frito-Lay had a 55% share of the total 
salty snack food business in Chicago while Jays' share of that market was 24% (Ex. 34, p. 182435). "
1258,3," HN5[
] Courts generally have held that plaintiff makes out a prima facie case of predatory pricing by showing that defendant's 
prices fell below average variable cost and are thus presumptively predatory. When prices are above average variable but below 
average total cost plaintiffs must rebut the presumption that the prices are not predatory. See generally William Inglis & Sons 
Baking Company v. ITT Continental Baking Company, Inc., 668 F.2d 1014, 1035-36 (9th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 
825, 103 S. Ct. 57, 74 L. Ed. 2d 61 (1982). The Transamerica court set plaintiff's burden even higher when defendant's prices 
are above average total cost.  698 F.2d at 1388. "
1259,4," There is no indication that the MCI decision requires any different treatment of non-cost factors when the long-run incremental 
cost test rather than the average variable cost test is employed."
1259,5, The cost study shows that Frito-Lay's revenues exceeded its total cost for the last eight weeks of 1974. 
1260,6," In 1981 Price, Waterhouse & Company prepared an analysis of a contribution made by the sale of potato chips in the sale zone 
which included Chicago (Ex. 47). The study found that the potato chips made a positive contribution on a variable cost basis 
each year during the 1974-1980 period. That is, for the zone as a whole, Frito-Lay was selling its potato chips above its average 
variable cost. Plaintiff's theory, of course, is that Frito-Lay was selling its supermarket potato chips below its average variable 
cost in Chicago, even though its potato chips prices may have exceeded average variable cost throughout the zone as a whole. "
1261,7," The Allen Park plant was somewhat more inefficient that most other Frito-Lay plants (Ex. 43, p. 205123). Plaintiff points out that 
cost study, which may not have fully accounted for the inefficiencies of the Allen Park plan, may thus understate actual cost. "
1272,1," In his reply brief, plaintiff for the first time sets forth additional facts that he presumably desires this court to consider should we 
decide that defendants are correct that the district judge properly considered the facts raised by defendants in their 
memorandum of law. In essence, the plaintiff claims that his hospital privileges were suspended in retaliation for his opposition 
to the appointment of defendant Truman Esau to the position of Medical Director at Old Orchard, and his testimony against the 
parent corporation when it sought an application for a license to operate a hospital in a suburb of Chicago. He apparently 
concedes that he rarely admitted patients to Old Orchard, but he claims that this was because Esau and other doctors on Old 
Orchard's hospital staff became increasingly hostile to the plaintiff and his patients because of the doctors' desire to improve 
their private practices by excluding plaintiff from competition. Nowhere in the reply brief or the record, however, does plaintiff 
deny defendants' assertions that he only admitted eleven patients to Old Orchard from 1979 to October 1981, or that he had 
admitting privileges at other hospitals; he also does not state what acts by the defendants resulted in his permanent exclusion 
from the hospital. Plaintiff's new facts, however, are belatedly presented to this court. A reviewing court will not consider facts not presented to the 
district court in the first instance. In addition, this circuit's rule 9(e) prohibits the introduction of new matter in a reply brief. The 
reason for this rule is that if we were to consider such new material, the opposing party would have to be given an opportunity to 
file a supplemental brief in response. The possibilities for continued briefing become endless. Thus, given that plaintiff gave 
neither the district judge nor the defendants an opportunity to view these facts, we refuse to consider them. Plaintiff's complaint 
that he was presented with a Hobson's choice is simply without merit. Plaintiff easily could have objected to the introduction of 
defendants' facts, thereby preserving his objection to this procedure, and then proceeded to introduce additional facts in support 
of his jurisdictional allegations. Indeed, it is beyond cavil that the burden of setting forth sufficient jurisdictional facts remains with 
the plaintiff. Once plaintiff's original jurisdictional allegations have been controverted, he must come forward with additional 
evidence to support his jurisdictional claim.  Grafon Corp. v. Hausermann, 602 F.2d 781, 783 (7th Cir. 1979). "
1273,2," A plaintiff may adequately allege the requirement of ""interstate commerce"" either by pleading sufficient facts that the 
defendants' alleged illegal conduct is ""in interstate commerce"" or has a substantial and adverse effect upon interstate 
commerce. McLain v. Real Estate Board of New Orleans, Inc., 444 U.S. 232, 241-42, 62 L. Ed. 2d 441, 100 S. Ct. 502 (1980); 
Hospital Building Co. v. Trustees of Rex Hospital, 425 U.S. 738, 743, 48 L. Ed. 2d 338, 96 S. Ct. 1848 (1976). There is no 
dispute in this case that plaintiff is attempting to fulfill only the ""substantial and adverse effect on interstate commerce"" prong of 
the McLain test. Thus, for purposes of this appeal, we use only the more specific phrase ""substantial and adverse effect"" on 
interstate commerce in lieu of the more general one, ""interstate commerce."" "
1274,3," Defendants' claim that even if we decide this case on the basis of rule 12(b)(6) we may still consider the extra-complaint facts is 
without merit. ""It is axiomatic that the complaint may not be amended by the briefs (in support of or in) opposition to a motion to 
dismiss."" Car Carriers, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 745 F.2d 1101, 1107 (7th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1054, 105 S. Ct. 
1758, 84 L. Ed. 2d 821 (1985). We note that defendants could easily and properly have preserved those facts for our review by 
submitting them to the district court in affidavits and then moving for summary judgment."
1274,4," Plaintiff's claim also borders on the frivolous, and hence is arguably subject to dismissal for failure to raise a substantial federal 
question. See Hagans v. Lavine, 415 U.S. 528, 536-37, 39 L. Ed. 2d 577, 94 S. Ct. 1372 (1974); Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 
681-82, 90 L. Ed. 939, 66 S. Ct. 773 (1946). Nonetheless, given that it is now well-settled that under certain circumstances a 
single physician may bring an antitrust action against a hospital and its staff for excluding that physician from providing services 
at the hospital, see Marrese v. Interqual, Inc., 748 F.2d 373, 381-82 & n.15 (7th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 472 U.S. 1027, 105 S. 
Ct. 3501, 87 L. Ed. 2d 632 (1985), and cases cited therein, we do not affirm the dismissal of the instant action on the grounds of 
frivolousness. We also note that defendants have raised, albeit belatedly, a substantial claim that plaintiff's complaint is subject to dismissal 
pursuant to the state action exemption. See Hoover v. Ronwin, 466 U.S. 558, 80 L. Ed. 2d 590, 104 S. Ct. 1989, 1995, 80 L. Ed. 
2d 590 (1984); Marrese, 748 F.2d at 384. Defendants did not present this argument to the district judge, but rather raised it for 
the first time pursuant to this court's circuit rule 11 (citation of additional authority) after briefing in this court had been completed. 
This court has recently affirmed the dismissal of a similar action on the basis of the state action exemption even though the issue 
was not originally presented to the district judge, see Marrese, 748 F.2d at 384. Nonetheless, in that case, the issue had been 
fully briefed on appeal. Plaintiff in the instant action has not had the opportunity to respond to defendants' argument. In addition, 
unlike in Marrese, in the case at bar we can affirm the dismissal on the ground of failure to state a claim. Hence we do not reach 
the issue of a state action exemption. "
1275,5," A second issue arises in those cases as to whether the required nexus with interstate commerce can be based on the activities 
of either the plaintiff or the defendants, or only on those of the plaintiff. See Furlong, 710 F.2d at 926. We do not decide this 
issue for even if the interstate commerce nexus may be predicated on defendants' activities, plaintiff in the instant case has 
failed to adequately allege the required nexus."
1275,6," We reiterate the observation we made in Havoco of Am., Ltd. v. Shell Oil Co., 626 F.2d 549, 559 (7th Cir. 1982), that it is ""hard 
to ignore the suspicion that the facts of this case have been forced into an antitrust mold to achieve federal jurisdiction."" This "
1276,," suspicion is amply reinforced by the fact that the plaintiff's allegations are taken in haec verba from some of the allegations in the 
complaint in Dos Santos v. Columbus-Cuneo-Cabrini Medical Center, 684 F.2d 1346 (7th Cir. 1982), and by the plaintiff's 
unsupportable plea for $15.5 million in damages before trebling. Of that amount, $13.5 million are claimed as damages for the 
alleged antitrust violations. Compare id., No. 81-C-4296 (physician claims $500,000 damages as a result of permanent exclusion 
from providing services at defendant's hospital). Although we do not pretend to be able to quantify the appropriate damages for 
the alleged violations (if proven), we have no doubt that even if plaintiff had been permanently excluded from using the hospital 
facilities, he could not prove that he had suffered anything close to $13.5 million in damages. Indeed, plaintiff's counsel 
conceded at oral argument that the request for damages had no basis in fact. In addition, we also note that plaintiff made no attempt below either to buttress the allegations of his complaint with affidavits or 
to amend his complaint to cure any of the deficiencies identified by the district judge. Although it is true that the plaintiff is entitled 
to stand on the allegations of his original complaint, the plaintiff's deliberate failure ""to produce anything approaching a 
significant showing of"" Majd-Pour v. Georgiana Community Hospital, Inc., 724 F.2d 901, 903 (11th Cir. 1984), an antitrust claim 
is indicative of the true nature of this complaint. See also Furlong, 710 F.2d at 928. With respect to the request for relief in this complaint, we refer plaintiff's counsel to Fed.R.Civ.P. 11 and admonish him that this 
complaint comes dangerously close to violating that rule, as it existed when this complaint was filed on July 17, 1983, and as it 
now exists subsequent to the 1983 amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Each of the versions of that rule 
require that an attorney sign the pleading, thereby certifying that to ""the best of his knowledge"" there is good ground to support 
it. Here, plaintiff's counsel conceded at oral argument that the request for damages had no basis in fact. Hence the district judge 
could properly have stricken plaintiff's claim for damages. In addition, the bar is now put on notice that in the future this court will 
not tolerate such groundless pleading."
1276,7," Many of the facts relied upon by the court to sustain the complaint were submitted by the plaintiff by way of affidavit. Thus it is 
unclear whether that complaint, standing alone, would have survived a motion to dismiss. "
1277,8," If the issue were considered to be one of subject matter jurisdiction, it can be argued that in deciding the merits of the appeal, 
this court in Dos Santos implicitly found that the complaint adequately alleged a nexus with interstate commerce for it is 
axiomatic that a court without subject matter jurisdiction cannot rule on the merits and that a court can raise, sua sponte, the 
issue of subject matter jurisdiction. Nonetheless, we hesitate to infer that the court ruled on the question particularly when the 
issue of whether a complaint satisfies the requirements of antitrust subject matter jurisdiction is generally complex and fact-
based, and would not immediately come to the court's attention."
1277,9," In Dos Santos this court reversed the grant of a preliminary injunction and remanded the case for further proceedings. In our 
opinion, we observed that the plaintiff could only prevail if she showed that the contract ""results in a substantial foreclosure of 
competition in . . . a relevant market."" 684 F.2d at 1352. We also observed that we had ""reason to doubt whether the relevant 
market can be sliced so small as to embrace only a single hospital."" Id. at 1353. On remand the action was dismissed pursuant 
to the defendants' motion for summary judgment on the ground, inter alia, that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate that defendants' 
allegedly illegal activities had caused a substantial foreclosure of competition in any relevant market. See Dos Santos v. 
Columbus-Cuneo-Cabrini Medical Center, No. 81-C-4296, Summary Judgment and Order, Findings of Fact and Conclusions of 
Law, at 4, 10 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 25, 1983). That dismissal apparently was never appealed."
1277,10," See also Shahawy v. Harrison, 755 F.2d 1432 (11th Cir. 1985). In Shahawy, the court sustained the dismissal of the plaintiff-
doctor's antitrust action where plaintiff's interstate commerce allegations were based on the interstate flow of patients, revenues, 
and purchases of supplies. Plaintiff's allegations were so vague and lacking in absolutely any quantification that the court could 
not even conjecture, whether as a ""matter of practical economics"" the alleged effect on interstate commerce was substantial.  Id. 
at 1439. Shahawy, however, does not support the result we reach today; the opinion has been withdrawn pending 
reconsideration en banc. "
1278,11," The result we reach today is not inconsistent with Bunker Ramo Corp. v. United Business Forms, Inc., 713 F.2d 1272 (7th Cir. 
1983). In that case, we reversed the dismissal of an antitrust complaint because ""it may well be that . . . (the plaintiff) can 
demonstrate a substantial effect on interstate commerce as a matter of practical economics, and at this point we cannot say 
beyond doubt that . . . (the plaintiff) can prove no set of facts to show the required effect on interstate commerce."" Id. at 1282. 
We do not interpret this passage to mean that a plaintiff can avoid a section 12(b)(6) dismissal merely by stating a legal 
conclusion and then arguing that, at some later date, he might be able to flesh out the complaint with additional facts. As this court observed in Car Carriers, Inc. and Sutliff, Inc., the plaintiff must plead specific facts that are within his knowledge to 
support his claim. He cannot throw himself on ""the mercy of the court."" The court is not required to speculate as to the many 
possible facts that might have been alleged. In the instant case plaintiff might have alleged, for example, how many patients he 
treated at the defendant-hospital, what percentage of his patients are from out of state, how much of his own revenues came 
from out-of-state insurers, at what other hospitals he had admitting privileges, or what particular acts of defendants have led to 
his de facto permanent suspension from the hospital. Instead, he chose to allege only the bare fact of his suspension and then 
ask this court to speculate as to the rest. Nothing in Bunker Ramo, Car Carriers, Inc., or Sutliff, Inc., requires this court to 
assume plaintiff's burden of adequately pleading his claim. There may be some cases in which all of the facts supporting the requirement of a nexus with interstate commerce are within a 
defendant's exclusive knowledge. This case, however, is not one of those. Unless the plaintiff admitted a substantial number of 
patients to the defendant-hospital and could not have admitted them elsewhere, his suspension or exclusion from the hospital 
could not substantially affect any of defendants' interstate activities. On the other hand, it might possibly affect plaintiff's 
interstate activities; but this plaintiff would know, and he should have pleaded it. "
1281,1," There are several other proposed modifications, but these are minor revisions to which no objection has been raised."
1281,2, The court finds all other objections to be meritless.
1281,3," Two of NFA's four competitors grant exclusive territories. The court will accept the parties' statements that open membership 
results in less control over the quality of services offered by NFA members and thereby puts NFA at a competitive disadvantage 
compared to the organizations which grant exclusive territories. "
1289,1," After these actions were filed in 1978, all defendants moved to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim 
upon which relief can be granted, each asserting the state action exemption. These motions to dismiss were denied in the 
original district court opinion, 461 F. Supp. at 1031-33. On May 24, 1985, the Court issued an Order stating that it would 
reconsider these motions in light of subsequent authority. All parties submitted new briefs. On June 28, 1985, the private 
defendants -- Surtran Taxicabs, Inc., Yellow Cab of Dallas, Inc., and Fort Worth Cab & Baggage Company, Inc. -- moved for 
summary judgment under Rule 56, asserting the state action exemption and Noerr-Pennington immunity. The issues concerning the Local Government Antitrust Act of 1984 were raised by the Court in an Order issued December 6, 
1984. In response to that Order, each party filed papers addressing the applicability of the Act's provisions. "
1295,2," As an alternative ground for dismissal, this analysis proceeds as though the state action exemption did not apply, thus making 
the availability of alternative relief a reality. "
