21,*," A Petition for Rehearing with Suggestion for Rehearing In Banc was filed by appellants but was dismissed after the parties 
advised this court that they had reached a settlement. "
26,1," In 1966, the NBA awarded an expansion franchise for Chicago to Chicago Basketball. After considering both the Chicago 
Stadium and the International Amphitheatre, at that time Chicago's two indoor sports arenas, Chicago Basketball selected the 
Amphitheatre as the Bulls' home arena for the 1966-67 season. In January 1967, McCormick Place, Chicago's convention and 
exposition facility, burned down. The Amphitheatre was selected as the replacement site for McCormick's scheduled events. To "
27,," facilitate this switch, Arthur Wirtz, at Mayor Daley's request, took the Bulls as a tenant at the Chicago Stadium. In June 1967, 
Chicago Basketball and CSC executed a three-year lease agreement. When McCormick Place was not rebuilt by either the 
1970-71 or 1971-72 seasons, additional one-year leases were executed."
27,2," IBI was incorporated on June 13, 1972. Its shareholders were to have included Marvin Fishman, Robert Block, A. E. Stanley III, 
Lloyd Levin, Thomas Nadler, Robert Paliofito, Harold Paliofito and Jonathan Kovler. See infra note 35."
27,3," CPSC was incorporated on May 18, 1972. Its original shareholders were defendants Lester Crown, Philip Klutznick, Arthur 
Wirtz, James Cook and Albert Adelman and non-defendants Edward Ginsberg, George Steinbrenner III, Arnold Meyer, Lamar 
Hunt and Jonathan Kovler. "
28,4," The governors representing the New York Knicks, Los Angeles Lakers, Washington Bullets, Kansas City Kings and Detroit 
Pistons voted against the transfer. The Portland Trailblazers were not represented at the meeting. There is some question as to 
how William Putnam of the Atlanta Hawks voted. Putnam recalled that he voted not to approve but notes from the meeting 
indicate the opposite. "
29,5," Ginsberg spoke with Pollin several times about his group's interest in acquiring the Bulls. Arthur Wirtz provided NBA 
Commissioner Kennedy and Pollin with copies of his correspondence with Rich. William Wirtz did the same for Jack Kent Cooke 
(owner of the Los Angeles Lakers) and invited Cooke to call him and discuss the matter. William Wirtz also called William 
Putnam (Atlanta Hawks) and told him that CPSC could obtain a lease at the Chicago Stadium, whereas IBI could not. Arthur 
Wirtz called Ray Patterson (Houston Rockets) to deliver the same message. Some of the NBA governors took the initiative. Irish (New York Knicks) and Pollin telephoned Rich and asked what could be 
done to cause a sale to CPSC. Alan Rothenberg (Los Angeles Lakers) spoke to fellow NBA members to persuade them not to 
approve the transfer to IBI. "
30,6," Defendant Emprise Corporation operates the food and beverage concessions at various arenas throughout the country, 
including the Chicago Stadium. Defendant Chicago Blackhawk Hockey Team, Inc. owns and operates the Chicago Blackhawks, 
a National Hockey League (""NHL"") franchise; Arthur Wirtz owns a controlling interest in this corporation. As of 1972, defendant 
Atlanta Hockey, Inc. owned the Atlanta Flames, also an NHL franchise. Prior to 1979, other defendants in this suit included the NBA; Madison Square Garden Center, Inc.; California Sports, Inc.; 
Missouri Valley Professional Sports; Texas Sports Investment, Inc.; Atlanta Hawks Basketball, Inc.; Phoenix Professional 
Basketball; and Capital Bullets, Inc. The last seven were the owners of the seven teams that voted against the transfer of the 
Bulls to IBI. The claims against these eight ""NBA defendants"" were the same as those against the defendants here. In 
December 1978, these defendants settled with the plaintiffs for $750,000 and the claims against them were dismissed. Finally, Washington Hockey, Ltd. was named as a defendant but was dismissed on its motion for summary judgment in May 
1977."
30,7," The complaint also alleged that defendants had monopolized, attempted to monopolize, and conspired to monopolize the 
market for indoor sports arenas in Chicago and had conspired to restrain trade with respect to indoor sports arenas in Chicago. 
Consolidated Complaint, Counts III, IV. The district court ruled that plaintiffs lacked standing to bring this claim because there 
was insufficient evidence that they planned to acquire or build an indoor sports arena in Chicago. Liability Opinion, 1981-2 Trade "
31,," Cas. at 74,790. Further, the complaint alleged that defendants had monopolized, attempted to monopolize, and conspired to 
monopolize the market for major league professional winter sports in Chicago and had conspired to restrain trade in that market. 
Consolidated Complaint, Counts V, VI. The district court did not discuss these counts in its opinion, nor do the parties mention 
them on appeal."
31,8," Defendant Atlanta Hockey, Inc. has not appealed to this court. "
32,9," The national sports franchise market could be a relevant market under the facts of this case, but this would change the theory 
of the suit as pleaded by the plaintiffs. If the relevant market were the market for franchises, the charge would be monopsony, 
that is, that CPSC had made itself the only buyer of basketball franchises in Chicago. But, given the case that the plaintiffs 
brought, the trial court correctly defined the relevant market. "
33,10," As defendants point out, the Court also stated that ""the aggregate of towns in Otter Tail's service area is the geographic 
market in which Otter Tail competes for the right to serve the towns at retail."" 410 U.S. at 369 (footnote omitted). But it goes on 
to explain ""that competition is generally for the right to serve the entire retail market within the composite limits of a town, and 
that competition is generally between Otter Tail and a prospective or existing municipal system."" Id. at 369-70. Thus, the Court 
recognized that the area of effective competition between Otter Tail and each of the municipal systems was a single town, which 
was a natural monopoly. "
34,11," The dissent states that the ""generation of power is highly competitive. . . ."" Infra p. 571. The struggle for access to generation 
owned by third parties other than the local serving utility has been going on for many years with varying degrees of success. A 
provision for mandatory ""wheeling"" was rejected in the Federal Power Act amendments of 1935 (S. Rep. 621, 74th Cong., 1st 
Sess. 19, cited in City of Paris v. Kentucky Utilities Co., 41 FPC 45 (1969)) but was incorporated in a somewhat limited form in 
the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-617, ยง 203 (codified at 16 U.S.C. 824j (1982)). The regulated 
structure of the electric utility industry makes it questionable how much generation in adjacent utility serving areas really 
""competes,"" although there has certainly been an effort in recent years to further competition. "
35,12," As the dissent indicates, infra p. 577, Joseph Schumpeter said that the capitalist process creates a ""gale of creative 
destruction."" J. Schumpeter, Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy 84 (2d ed. 1947). Schumpeter also said, among other things, 
"" . . . the capitalist process unavoidably attacks the standing ground of the small producer and trader,"" id. at 140, and ""the 
capitalist process not only destroys its own institutional framework, but it also creates the conditions for another,"" id. at 162. "
36,13," The defendants rely heavily on the Court's approving quotation from R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox (1978) -- that Congress 
designed the Sherman Act as a ""consumer welfare prescription"" -- in Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 343, 60 L. Ed. 2d 
931, 99 S. Ct. 2326 (1979). Reiter is not, however, on point: It held that a consumer who pays a higher price for goods because 
of an antitrust violation has been injured in her ""property"" and may sue under ยง 4 of the Clayton Act."
36,14," As a matter of fact, the concept that ultimate consumer loss is an essential element of an antitrust claim may have puzzling 
implications for the application of antitrust principles to industries where prices are pervasively regulated. Retail electric rates, for 
example, are regulated in most jurisdictions to be ""just and reasonable."" The law presumes that rate regulation has denied 
monopoly profits to the electric utility and has precluded any injurious impact on consumers. Yet antitrust principles have been 
broadly applied to all aspects of the electric utility industry. See Otter Tail, 410 U.S. 366, 35 L. Ed. 2d 359, 93 S. Ct. 1022; 
Mishawaka, 616 F.2d 976; and Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., 428 U.S. 579, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1141, 96 S. Ct. 3110 (1976). "
37,15," The dissent does argue that a merger of two successive monopolists might result in lower consumer prices than would be the 
case if the monopolies were independently operated. Infra slip op. at pp. 76-77. Under this theory, which is surely not in the 
mainstream of the antitrust laws, consumers might be better off if the Bulls and the Stadium were in the same hands. This 
argument was not brought to the attention of the district court nor was it argued to this court. It was therefore waived. But we will 
nonetheless attempt to briefly address it. While we do not have the benefit of briefing on the point, we believe that the dissent 
fails to take into account potential anticompetitive effects which might result if the Bulls and the Stadium were under common 
control. See IV P. Areeda & D. F. Turner, Antitrust Law para. 1011b (1980). Also, even if integration of the successive 
monopolies in this case would result in lower prices to consumers, the purchase of the Bulls by CPSC did not result in the 
merger of two monopolists. Instead, after the sale of the franchise to CPSC, the Bulls were in the hands of a group of investors, 
one of whom was Arthur Wirtz, and the Stadium was controlled by William and Arthur Wirtz. While there was some overlap in the 
shareholders of CSC and CPSC, it is unrealistic to assume that these two corporations would act as a single monopolist since 
they were controlled by different sets of investors. Thus, we think the successive monopoly objection is not so simple as it might 
appear and can be addressed only if it is argued, and a record made on it, in the trial court. "
38,16," A patent is not a natural monopoly in the same sense as is a franchise for the provision of electric power at retail -- or even a 
professional sports franchise. The market could accommodate two or more producers of antistatic yarn but -- to advance policies 
wholly divorced from those informing the antitrust laws -- an administrative decision is made to confer a temporary monopoly on 
one producer. A patent monopoly is acquired in an ex parte administrative proceeding without consideration of those factors that 
might lead a different producer to dominance in the marketplace. Market and competitive concerns are sufficiently foreign to the 
world of patents that we would consider it ill-advised to recreate the law of antitrust in reliance upon a decision addressing patent 
fraud. "
39,17," The objective economic reality argument is also at odds with the stress the defendants place on Fishman's asserted belief that 
the Amphitheatre was in fact the better site for Bulls games. See Appellants' Brief at 11-13, 70-73. If the preferences of 
individuals with the power to grant an NBA franchise are not relevant to this discussion, we do not see how Fishman's could be. Whatever Fishman's views at various points (and the evidence was conflicting, with the district court characterizing the 
defendants' testimony at points as ""lack[ing] in credibility"" and ""astoundingly unbelievable""), they were not consensus views and 
do not seem dispositive of whether the stadium was an ""essential facility."" Fishman became very interested in the Chicago 
Stadium when it became apparent that it was the key to NBA approval. Further, his statements to the NBA about the 
Amphitheatre after he signed a lease there were an understandable attempt to salvage his position. "
40,18," The district court also briefly discussed the ยง 2 offense of ""monopoly leveraging,"" although it is unclear whether it intended to 
distinguish this from the withholding of an essential facility. Defendants argue on appeal that this violation had not been proven 
because there was no proof that CSC possessed monopoly power in the adjacent arena market. However, the district court did 
make such a finding, Liability Opinion, 1981-2 Trade Cas. at 74,755, based on evidence that CSC could raise its rents to team 
sports events far above those being charged by the Amphitheatre, without causing those events to switch arenas."
40,19," Contrary to the dissent's assertion, infra slip op. at pp. 100-01, this opinion does not reinstitute the Pick-Barth doctrine under 
which business torts are per se violations of the Sherman Act. We would agree with the dissent that any such result would be 
uncalled for. Thus, we do not hold here that a conspiracy to commit a business tort results in a per se violation of the antitrust 
laws. We have affirmed the district court's finding of a per se violation in this case because the defendants, who were found to 
have both market power and exclusive access to an essential facility, had engaged in a group boycott of IBI. As we have already 
stated, supra, this conclusion is consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in Northwest Wholesale Stationers, 472 U.S. 284, 
105 S. Ct. 2613, 86 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1985). Thus, our opinion in this case does not conflict with our earlier decisions rejecting the 
Pick-Barth doctrine. See Havoco, 626 F.2d at 554-56, and Juneau Square Corp. v. First Wisconsin National Bank, 624 F.2d 798, 
812-13 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1013, 101 S. Ct. 571, 66 L. Ed. 2d 472 (1980). Even if we were to agree with the dissent that the ยง 1 claim in this case should be analyzed under the Rule of Reason, we would 
still conclude that the defendants' refusal to deal constituted a violation of that section. In applying the Rule of Reason, ""the "
41,," factfinder weighs all of the circumstances of a case in deciding whether a restrictive practice should be prohibited as imposing 
an unreasonable restraint on competition."" Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 49, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568, 97 S. 
Ct. 2549 (1977) (citation omitted). As we have already explained, the defendants' conduct in this case had the effect of 
foreclosing competition for the Bulls, supra slip opinion at p. 24, and the defendants have not suggested to this court any 
benefits to competition which would result from their decision to withhold the Stadium from IBI, supra slip opinion at p. 25 & n. 
15. The dissent also contends that we lack the plurality of actors necessary to find a contract or conspiracy in restraint of trade in 
violation of ยง 1. Infra slip op. at pp. 101-02. While this argument was not raised by the defendants on appeal or, apparently, 
anywhere else, we will nevertheless address it here. The district court found a conspiracy between CSC and CPSC (which is 
also referred to by the district court in its opinion as the ""Crown-Wirtz group"").  Liability Opinion, 1981-2 Trade Cas. at 74,774-75. 
The dissent argues that under Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628, 104 S. Ct. 2731 
(1984), an agreement between CSC and CPSC to withhold the Stadium from IBI cannot form the basis of a conspiracy for 
purposes of ยง 1. We disagree. The Supreme Court held in Copperweld that a firm and its wholly-owned subsidiary are not 
capable of conspiring in violation of ยง 1. The dissent argues that we should extend Copperweld so as to preclude us from finding 
a conspiracy between two corporations which have ""common investors and [which] are under common control,"" infra p. 576. 
Even if we were to agree with this proposed extension of Copperweld, we do not believe that the facts of this case fit the 
hypothetical posited by the dissent. It is true that there was some overlap between the investors in CSC and CPSC since Arthur 
Wirtz owned and controlled CSC (along with his son, William Wirtz) and also invested in CPSC; however, CSC and CPSC were 
not under common control in the same sense as is a corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiary or as are two corporations 
owned in identical proportions by the same set of investors, see Century Oil Tool, Inc. v. Production Specialties, Inc., 737 F.2d 
1316 (5th Cir. 1984) (two corporations were commonly owned by three men, two of whom each owned 30% of each corporation 
and one of whom owned 40% of each) (cited by dissent, infra p. 576). A large number of individuals had invested in CPSC; there 
is no indication that Arthur Wirtz controlled or could control CPSC independent of the wishes of his co-investors. Thus, while 
there was some overlap in the ownership of CSC and CPSC, the two corporations lacked the ""complete unity of interest"" 
necessary to find them to be a ""single enterprise for purposes of section 1."" Copperweld, 467 U.S. at 771. And, viewing matters more broadly, a multiplicity of antitrust actors is supported by the disparity of economic interests between 
the stadium owners and the team owners. Further, this is a case where CPSC is a corporation virtually ""in formation,"" where the 
various investors can be seen as actors independent of the corporation itself. This is not some legal fiction of shareholders 
forming a conspiracy with their corporation; here the corporation was barely emerging from the interactions of the investors, who 
were certainly real economic actors in their own right. Copperweld eliminated the legal fiction of parent-subsidiary conspiracy as 
a basis of antitrust liability. It should not be extended to shelter independent actors having diverse economic interests acting 
jointly."
41,19," a Atlanta Hockey, Inc. did not appeal, and accordingly this opinion does not affect the entry of judgment against it. "
44,20," As plaintiffs point out, some cases do not require that the contract in question actually be breached but rather require only, for 
instance, that performance be rendered impossible, see Bailey v. Meister Brau, 535 F.2d 982, 987 n. 6 (7th Cir. 1976), or that 
the terms of the contract be coercively modified, see Hannigan v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 410 F.2d 285, 291 (7th Cir.), cert. 
denied, 396 U.S. 902, 90 S. Ct. 214, 24 L. Ed. 2d 178 (1969). While these cases show the courts' unwillingness to unduly 
restrict the tort based on technicalities, we do not think that they speak to the point made in Belden. NBA approval of the sale -- 
and thus the right to own the Bulls -- was not what was bargained for in the IBI-Chicago Basketball contract. Nor do we think that the cases holding that the plaintiff's interest need not be enforceable under the contract will support the 
weight the plaintiffs seek to place on them. For instance, in Kemper v. Worcester, 106 Ill. App. 3d 121, 435 N.E.2d 827, 62 Ill. 
Dec. 29 (5th Dist. 1982), the court held that interference with an at-will employment contract is actionable even though the 
plaintiff had no more than a reasonable expectation of future employment. This is completely consistent with Belden: The at-will 
employment contract represented a ""foundation for an on-going business relationship."" Id. at 124, 435 N.E.2d at 830. This is 
entitled to protection, as was the contingent contract in Belden. The point is, however, that the protection it merits is not so 
extensive as the protection afforded an unconditional contract right. "
45,21," The dissent takes issue with our conclusion that the defendants' violation of the federal antitrust laws eliminates their 
competitors' privilege. Infra slip op. at pp. 103-04. While we recognize that there are no Illinois cases which have used the 
Sherman Act as the basis of tort liability, we do not believe that Illinois case law precludes this result. We have found no cases 
which indicate that the illegality or wrongfulness of the conduct of a competitor is to be judged solely by reference to state law. Also, the defendants' conduct in this case might well be unlawful under the Illinois antitrust law. Ill. Ann. Stat. ch. 38, para. 60-1 
et seq. (Smith-Hurd Supp. 1986). This statute contains provisions similar to ยงยง 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. See Ill. Ann. Stat. 
ch. 38, para. 60-3 (Smith-Hurd Supp. 1986). While we have found no essential facilities cases decided under the Illinois 
antitrust law, Illinois courts are required by this statute to ""use the construction of the federal [antitrust] law by the federal 
courts as a guide in construing"" the state act ""when the wording of [the state act] is identical or similar to that of a federal "
46,," antitrust law. . . ."" Ill. Ann. Stat. ch. 38, para. 60-11 (Smith-Hurd Supp. 1986). This puts a reverse twist on the Erie doctrine. An 
Illinois court might find that the conduct of the defendants in this case violates the state antitrust law and that the defendants, 
therefore, are not shielded by the competitor's privilege. Thus, contrary to the dissent's assertion, there might be tort liability in 
this case even without the Sherman Act."
46,22," This section addresses only the damages of plaintiff IBI. Plaintiff Fishman had also sought $318,000 in damages representing 
his lost salary as IBI's chief executive officer. Since Fishman would have had to stop working full-time in real estate to become 
IBI's chief executive officer and since he had earned more than $318,000 in real estate, the district court ruled that Fishman 
could collect no damages on his lost salary claim. Fishman has not appealed this ruling."
46,23," The district court decided to count only those benefits directly accruing to CPSC (and thus, hypothetically, to IBI) in its 
damages calculation. It noted that the individual defendants had enjoyed substantial benefits from: (1) the ""ego"" satisfaction and 
publicity inherent in owning a professional sports team; and (2) the significant tax losses that can be passed through to the 
shareholders of a subchapter S corporation like either CPSC or Chicago Basketball. Neither of these benefits are enjoyed by the 
corporation itself. See infra note 36. "
47,24," Factors making franchises ""comparable"" included: (1) the size of the home city; (2) the degree of population growth in the 
home city; (3) the city's interest in basketball; and (4) whether the franchise was an ""expansion"" franchise. Damages Opinion, 
594 F. Supp. at 865-67."
47,25," Defendants had proposed a method of valuation variously called ""stock value"" or ""cash to seller."" Basically, this method would 
look only at the cash paid for comparable teams, ignoring any assumed liabilities. See Appellants' Brief at 83-86; Appellants' 
Reply Brief at 45-47. "
48,26," In a motion to amend, plaintiff IBI had challenged the $3.6 million figure for opportunity cost. The district court had assumed 
that IBI would have used the same pattern of using equity to fund operating losses as CPSC. Damages Opinion, 594 F. Supp. at 
877. IBI argued that the amount of equity was overstated by the inclusion of CPSC's higher purchase price, CPSC's Fishman 
litigation expenses, and opportunity cost accruing after the date as of which damages were measured. The district court agreed 
and revised the deduction for opportunity cost downward.  Fishman v. Estate of Wirtz, 609 F. Supp. 982 (N.D. Ill. 1985). "
50,27, Neither of the other two cases relied upon by the defendants squarely address the issue before us.
50,28," It is not indisputable that CPSC's offer should establish the market value of the Bulls in 1972. CPSC's control of the Stadium 
effectively gave it the power to exclude other bidders; therefore, one may not necessarily conclude that the $3.35 million paid by 
CPSC represents the price which the Bulls could have commanded under the conditions of an unfettered market. "
51,29," Cf.  Sinclair Refining, 289 U.S. at 699 (damages for breach of contract to assign a patent): Value for exchange is not the only value known to the law of damages. There are times when heed must be given to value 
for use, if reparation is to be adequate. [citations omitted]. An imaginary bid by an imaginary buyer, acting upon the 
information available at the moment of the breach, is not the limit of recovery where the subject of the bargain is an 
undeveloped patent. Information at such a time might be so scanty and imperfect that the offer would be nominal. The 
promisee of the patent has less than fair compensation if the criterion of value is the price that he would have received if he 
had disposed of it at once, irrespective of the value that would have been uncovered if he had kept it as his own."
51,30," The dissent criticizes the yardstick measure because it ostensibly does not recognize distinctions between price gain in 
basketball teams in general and price gains unique to the Bulls. Infra slip op. at pp. 108-09. But these distinctions (while perhaps 
academically defensible) were not argued to us, and we think it unnecessary to address them. In any event, gains in value from 
price inflation are at least partially offset (and perhaps fully offset) by the higher opportunity costs attributable to inflation which 
should be offset against the gain in value of the Bulls. See infra section C. 2. at 556. Similarly, the dissent argues that the district court has ignored any discrepancies due to transfer prices between the Stadium and 
CPSC. Infra slip op. at p. 109. This point has not been argued as a ground for error on appeal, and we see no need to address a 
""problem"" which does not appear of record. The dissent also suggests that the damage award should be adjusted to take into account the increase in value of the Bulls that 
is due to the entrepreneurial skills possessed by CPSC but not by IBI. Infra slip op. at p. 109. Again, the defendants did not raise 
this possible criticism of the damage award before this court, and as the dissent itself suggests, there is no evidence that any of 
the increased value was due to ""extraordinary entrepreneurial gains."""
51,31," While the district court computed the 1982 value of the Bulls by examining the purchase price of ""comparable"" teams, the use 
of this method is not incompatible with saying that these teams are not fungible. To compute damages one must use the most 
comparable figures available and other basketball teams provide such baseline figures, which may be adjusted to take into 
account, to the extent practicable, the actual experience of the Bulls. "
52,32," This is the problem with the defendants' ""stock value"" methodology. Taken alone, the cash component of these franchise 
purchases is as unenlightening as everyone agrees looking only at liabilities assumed would be."
52,33," Unlike liabilities for unearned deferred compensation, differing liabilities for earned deferred compensation can change the 
value of a franchise. Thus, if the ""comparable"" five NBA teams had had very small liabilities for earned deferred compensation 
and if the Bulls had had quite large ones, the district court's methodology would have led to an overstatement of the Bulls' net 
value in 1982. The district court has not addressed this specific problem (and it is questionable whether the defendants raised it 
there). Since the determination of damages will be remanded for other reasons, the district court may consider on remand any 
issue which may have been raised with respect to the treatment of earned deferred compensation. "
54,34," Defendants are at great pains to explain that opportunity cost is entirely different from mitigation of damages. They contend 
that opportunity cost ""is an economic concept which must be utilized to accurately measure gain."" Appellants' Reply Brief at 51. 
They are only half right -- opportunity cost is a concept that is used to measure relative gain. If someone has earned $100, he 
does not have only $10 because the next-best investment would have earned him $90; he has $100. And if he loses $100 but 
could have salvaged his position and lost only $90, it is still true that he has lost $100. Opportunity cost is a ""real"" but not an ""out 
of pocket"" cost.  Afram Export Corp., 772 F.2d at 1369. The law may turn the real but hypothetical cost into an out-of-pocket cost 
by making the alternative investment legally relevant; this it does through the rule regarding mitigation of damages. The dissent contends that we should consider CPSC's opportunity cost as critical and not IBI's mitigation efforts. Rather than 
deducting the profits which IBI could have made in an alternative investment, the dissent argues that we should instead reduce 
the increase in value of the Bulls, which is the starting point of the district court's damage calculation, by the imputed cost of 
CPSC's equity capital. Essentially, the dissent appears to contend that since IBI did not take the risk associated with an 
investment in the Bulls, it should not be awarded as damages the return associated with that risk. This approach may not be 
economically incorrect, but it seems to us to ignore the crucial distinction in law between the wrong-doer and the wronged. IBI wanted to buy the Bulls and assume the attendant risks, but the defendants' illegal conduct precluded IBI from taking this 
particular risk and from reaping the corresponding return. Instead, as the dissent points out, CPSC put its capital at risk and 
received a return commensurate with the risk-bearing service it supplied. If we were to accept the dissent's approach and reduce 
the damages by the value of the risk assumed by CPSC (i.e., the imputed cost of CPSC's equity investment), IBI's potential 
recovery would be drastically reduced or eliminated. Infra slip op. at p. 111. This result, according to the dissent, would be 
appropriate because IBI could have invested in some alternative opportunity, as risky as the Bulls, which would have returned a 
profit in line with that risk. Infra slip op. at p. 112. Thus, under the dissent's approach, IBI would really recover no damages but 
would have instead the profits from its alternative and equivalently risky investment. Under this analysis, in being pushed from 
an investment it wanted (the Bulls) to a theoretically equivalent investment it may not have wanted, IBI would have suffered no 
damage. It would be kept whole by another investment as risky as the Bulls. While the dissent's economic approach is 
understandable, it seems not to take account of the well-accepted legal concept that undue risk may not be forced on the 
wronged party, see infra p. 558. While that party may have been willing to accept a particular (and perhaps unique) business risk 
and opportunity, it may not be required, when wrongfully done out of that investment, to invest immediately in another line of 
business with its own unique configuration of risks. "
55,35," IBI issued its first stock in 1974, when Fishman caused IBI to issue three shares to himself in preparation for this lawsuit. See 
Damages Opinion, 594 F. Supp. at 881-82."
55,36," Plaintiffs argue that IBI shareholders were going to put equity into the Bulls, not because they were expecting a great return 
(3% over prime according to the defendants), but rather because they planned to use the Bulls as a tax shelter. Plaintiffs note 
that between 1972 and 1975 tax benefits had returned to CPSC's shareholders almost 70% of their equity investment. They 
assert that it is unfair to ""pierce"" the corporate veil to deduct a return on the investors' uninvested capital yet to ignore the tax 
benefits those investors lost when they were unable to buy the Bulls. We do not think that this analysis is inequitable. The value 
of the tax benefits to each of the investors depends on so many factors personal to each investor that we think that it would 
obviously be very difficult to try to ascertain their ""value."" In any event, the district court did not ignore this aspect of the damage 
problem in its calculations since the value of these tax benefits to an NBA owner is certainly reflected in the market prices of the 
comparable NBA franchises, which are the bases for the district court's damages award. A recognized tax shelter will be valued, 
at least in part, to reflect the tax benefits it makes available."
55,37," We are assuming for the purpose of calculating opportunity cost that IBI's organizers did in fact invest in that corporation and 
that IBI then placed these funds in an alternative investment. "
56,38," Anent the dissent's contention that IBI should ""cover"" its lost purchase, infra slip op. at pp. 108-09, finding a new investment 
opportunity for equity investors is certainly not as simple or routine a task as the dissent seems to imply. "
58,39," IBI also appealed the district court's refusal to adopt its proposed judgment order, which would have allowed IBI to execute 
upon both the federal antitrust treble damages and the Illinois common law punitive damages in such a way that no one 
defendant would have to pay both types of damages. Because we have reversed the district court's judgment on punitive 
damages, we do not have to reach this issue."
58,40," Antitrust Procedural Improvements Act, Pub. L. No. 96-349 (1980) (effective Sept. 12, 1980)."
58,41," The plaintiffs make no claim for interest on any amounts prior to May 31, 1982. The need for interest to compensate the 
plaintiffs fully in this case is not so great as if the damages all occurred as of July 1972 when IBI's contract to purchase the Bulls 
was terminated."
58,42," Congress also amended the Clayton Act to permit the government to recover prejudgment interest when it prevails in antitrust 
suits.  15 U.S.C. ยง 15a (1982). In contrast to section 15(a), a court can award the government prejudgment interest, not only 
when the other party engages in delaying tactics, but also when it is necessary to ""compensate the United States adequately for 
the injury sustained . . . ."" 15 U.S.C. ยง 15a(4) (1982). Therefore, although Congress was well aware of the policy of allowing 
prejudgment interest to make a plaintiff whole, it chose not to give courts the authority to consider this policy in the context of 
awarding prejudgment interest to the private antitrust plaintiff."
58,43," We agree with the defendants and the dissent that the Supreme Court suggested in General Motors Corp. v. Devex, 461 U.S. 
648, 657, 76 L. Ed. 2d 211, 103 S. Ct. 2058 (1983), that there is a presumption in favor of prejudgment interest even if a statute 
is silent on the question of interest. We do not believe, however, that this presumption necessarily applies under the Clayton Act 
given its subsequent amendment by Congress to specifically provide for the award of such interest only in very limited situations. "
59,44," The district court also entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs and against all defendants on Count III (restraint of trade in indoor 
sports arena market) and Counts V and VI (monopolization of market for professional winter sports in Chicago and restraint of 
trade in that market). We must reverse these as not consistent with the district court's findings of liability. It found that plaintiffs 
lacked standing to allege antitrust violations in the arena market (Count III) and never mentioned Counts V and VI at all. "
65,1," Although the majority is right to point out that a patent does not always create a monopoly, or even market power, the court in 
Riegel assumed that the patent in question created an absolute monopoly. "
67,2," Whether it would work is an open question. See Richard Schmalensee, The Control of Natural Monopolies 68-73 (1979); Oliver 
E. Williamson, Franchise Bidding for Natural Monopolies -- In General and with Respect to CATV, 7 Bell J. Econ. 73 (1976). "
68,3," The majority writes as if I were making the dissent's points in Otter Tail, so that the majority's failure to respond somehow 
refutes me. The dissenting Justices were arguing that Otter Tail should not be held liable. I am trying to find out why Otter Tail 
was held liable. My approach supplies a coherent reason. That the majority in Otter Tail did not offer a reason for its own 
decision hardly shows that I am wrong. "
73,4," Part of the value of a team is publicity for the owner and tax advantages for the investors. Part of the $3.3 million price 
compensated Rich for surrendering these benefits of ownership. The district court said that it was awarding Fishman and IBI 
nothing for the lost publicity and tax benefits. The implication is that the value of the profit stream expected from the Bulls was 
less than $3.3 million. The price was therefore not a bargain; it was a premium."
73,5," There is a related problem of selection bias. Plaintiffs sue only when the price rises. If defendants must pay the full value when 
the price goes up, but swallow their losses when the price falls, then on average they expect to pay more than their gains: 
sometimes they pay the plaintiffs, sometimes they pay through business losses. Then defendants as a group are penalized more 
than their expected profits from the violation; there is too much deterrence. "
74,6," To put this a little differently, banks lent to CPSC, with guarantees, for prime plus one-half percent because if CPSC had gone 
belly up the guarantees would have made the banks whole. If CPSC had failed no one was going to make its investors whole; 
their risk (and the appropriate rate of interest) was therefore the same as the banks would have demanded without the 
guarantees. "
75,7," The majority observes that by 1975 CPSC's lenders released the guarantees. But by 1975 CPSC's investors had a great deal 
of equity in the venture. This equity was the debt investors' ""cushion"", enabling them to charge lower rates. (Releasing a 
guarantee is one way to lower the rate.) CPSC's cost of capital includes the cost of all of its capital, debt and equity alike, just as 
a utility's cost of capital looks at all sources of capital. ""Opportunity cost"" refers to the implicit cost of the equity investment in 
CPSC. That cost always exceeds the price the banks charged for their safer debt investments. (The interest actually paid to 
banks is subtracted as an actual expense of the corporation and plays no role in the opportunity cost adjustment.) "
77,8," A plaintiff is effectively investing his antitrust damages with the defendant, so the right rate of interest is the one defendant pays 
to banks for its own capital. This rate compensates for the possibility of nonpayment plus the value of delay. The risk may be 
less than the risk of a single venture, because the defendants are diversified, so the rate appropriately would be somewhat less 
than the opportunity cost of CPSC's money. "
83,1," All further Act citations will take the form ""Act ยง --,"" referring to Title 29's numbering rather than the Act's internal numbering. "
84,2, Today Companies have an overwhelming majority of LCDs rather than commissioned drivers. 
85,3," Opinion, 636 F. Supp. at 205-07 simultaneously denied Companies' motion for summary judgment as to damages. "
86,4," Board had incorrectly held Act ยง 158(b)(4) proscribes union participation in all picketing by or on behalf of independent 
contractors. "
87,5," Although Unions do not explicitly attach the ""laches"" label to their argument, they assert both undue delay and prejudice--the 
necessary and sufficient ingredients of a laches defense."
87,6, [Footnote by this Court] Clayton Act ยง 6 is codified at 15 U.S.C. ยง 17.
87,7," All further citations to the Norris-LaGuardia Act will take the form ""N-L Act ยง --,"" also referring to the Title 29 numbering."
87,8," Although the Norris-LaGuardia Act does not speak of an ""exemption"" from the antitrust laws (instead it simply bars federal 
courts from issuing injunctions in cases involving labor disputes), H. A. Artists, id. (footnote omitted) emphasized: It has been interpreted broadly as a statement of congressional policy that the courts must not use the antitrust laws as a 
vehicle to interfere in labor disputes. "
88,9," There a group of fishermen (described by the Court, id. at 144-45 as ""independent entrepreneurs"") formed their own union and 
then refrained from selling fish to a processor, which refused to comply with their demand that it not purchase fish from nonunion 
members."
88,10," To do so Unions might have examined such matters as (1) the type of concerted activity engaged in by the associations of 
independent contractors in those cases, (2) the crux of the dispute between the parties there and (3) the relationship between 
the parties to the dispute.  To enable an effective comparison to be made, that kind of inquiry might well have also called for a "
89,," fuller story of what was at issue here than is afforded by the pleadings alone (see the previously quoted language of the Illinois 
Appellate Court in Yellow Cab)."
89,11," If the cases on which Companies rely are examined at all carefully, they really support Unions' position rather than Companies 
'.  Both cases recognize the potential antitrust exemption of associations of nonemployees--even such entrepreneurs as 
truckowners--when they seek to bargain over their own compensation as drivers rather than over the rental rate for their 
equipment (the familiar distinction between the value of services and the return on capital).  Each of those cases rejected the 
exemption because the second factor was at stake there, not the first.  But the LCDs here, though not statutory employees, are 
not entrepreneurial owners either--they are lessees rather than lessors of their cabs. In real world terms, the Unions-Companies 
dispute over lease rates impacted entirely on what the LCDs would earn from rendering services in dirving for their passengers.  
In the familiar process of legal analysis (matching similarities and dissimilarities, see Levi, Introduction to Legal Reasoning 1-6 & 
n.8 (1949)), the situation here comes much closer to the cases that United States Steel and Pan Alaska Trucking had to 
distinguish than to the latter two cases themselves."
89,12," Unions Mem. 2 seeks to rely on the holding in American Federation of Musicians of the United States and Canada v. Carroll, 
391 U.S. 99, 106, 20 L. Ed. 2d 460, 88 S. Ct. 1562 (1968) that HN8[
] where there is ""job or wage competition or some other 
economic interrelationship affecting legitimate union interests between the union members and the independent contractors,"" the 
independent contractors do not constitute a ""nonlabor"" group.  Thus a union may combine with or regulate such independent 
contractors without losing the labor exemption. Unions' reliance on AFM is misplaced, however.  There is no allegation here of 
any relationship between Unions' employee-members and independent-contractor-members (the LCDs), or that Unions' purpose 
was anything other than to obtain better lease terms and perhaps working conditions for the LCDs."
89,13," In Los Angeles Meat a group of 35 to 45 Los Angeles area ""grease peddlers"" (in the business of buying grease from 
restaurants and then selling it to grease processors) became members of a union.  Like the Division in this case, the peddlers 
formed a ""special 'subdivision' of the union"" and ""were treated as a separate group, distinct from the . . . . employee members"" 
(371 U.S. at 97). According to the Court ( id. at 98): There was no showing of any actual or potential wage or job competition, or of any other economic interrelationship, 
between the grease peddlers and the other members of the union. At the instigation of the union's business agent, and for the purpose of increasing the price margin for grease, a plan of price 
fixing and allocation of business was carried out.  That led to a District Court decree terminating the membership of the peddlers 
in the union because the District Court found ""only the support of the Union and the powerful weapons at its command enabled 
the peddlers and the Union together to destroy free competition in the purchase and sale of waste grease"" (id.). Before the 
Supreme Court the sole issue was whether it was within the District Court's power to order that particular remedy--a question 
answered in the affirmative. "
90,14," Because Unions Supp. Mem. was the last one submitted, Companies have not had the opportunity to speak to that argument.  
Further on the subject of issues to be dealt with (or, more accurately, not to be dealt with), Unions Supp. Mem. 2 n. correctly 
points out there is no reason to examine the sufficiency of Companies' Illinois common law claim at this stage of the 
proceedings.  If this Court refuses to permit Companies to add the Sherman Act claim, pendent jurisdiction for the state law 
claim will not exist."
90,15," Because the relation-back provisions of Rule 15(c) spare Companies' antitrust claim from dismissal under the otherwise 
applicable statute of limitations, that independent bar to their cause of action is inapplicable.  All the same, on the subject of 
delay it is surely relevant that Congress has decided HN11[
] four years is the outside date for bringing an antitrust action (15 U.S.C. ยง 15(b)).  Compare the similar use of a related statute of limitations to inform the proper measure of the delay factor for 
laches purposes in the patent field (see, e.g., Naxon Telesign Corp. v. Bunker Ramo Corp., 517 F. Supp. 804, 807-08 n.2 (N.D. 
Ill. 1981) and cases cited there, aff'd, 686 F.2d 1258 (7th Cir. 1982)). "
92,1," This opinion (1) will assume familiarity with the factual statement in the Opinion, (2) will follow the same usage of defined terms 
and (3) will refer to the parties' most recent memoranda as ""Unions Mem.--"" and ""Companies Mem.--."""
92,2," ""Leave [to amend the pleadings] shall be freely given when justice so requires."""
92,3," That differentiates this case from Components, Inc. v. Western Electric Co., 52 F.R.D. 379 (D. Me. 1971), on which Companies 
seek to rely.  There the court had stayed discovery and trial of patent misuse issues ( id. at 381-82). It was thus both 
understandable and proper for the court to permit plaintiff, at a later date, to amend its complaint to assert the invalidity of the 
patents that had allegedly been misused. "
93,4," See Textor v. Board of Regents, 711 F.2d 1387, 1391 (7th Cir. 1983); UNR Industries, Inc. v. Continental Insurance Co., 623 F. 
Supp. 1319, 1324-25 (N.D. Ill. 1985) (discussing Textor in light of Foman) and cases cited there."
93,5, See the description of that case in Opinion at 15-16 & n.13. 
94,6," Second Amended Complaint para. 11 alleges only that ""fewer drivers applied to rent [Companies '] taxicabs, and fewer 
taxicabs were available to serve the public."" Unions Mem. 4 n.* denies Unions and the LCDs engaged in price fixing, 
characterizing their activity instead as: primary picketing of the Cab Companies because of their complete refusal to negotiate over the terms of the lease and the 
working conditions of the drivers."
94,7," Companies' Memorandum is shot through with misunderstanding or mischaracterization (or both) of the relevant issues.  Thus 
Opinion at 18 n.15 referred to the four-year limitation period for antitrust claims, not as barring Companies' current effort as a 
matter of law (Rule 15(c) would prevent that result) but ""to inform the proper measure of the delay factor for laches purposes."" 
Companies Mem. 3 simply misses the point, labeling that well-established concept as an ""effective repeal[]"" of Rule 15(c).  But 
see Naxon Telesign, 517 F. Supp. at 807-08 & n.2, 686 F.2d at 1265 (passage of limitations period creates presumption of 
unreasonable prejudicial delay, shifting burden to plaintiff to excuse delay)."
94,8," Having denied Companies leave to amend on laches (delay-plus-prejudice) grounds, this Court need not reach the more 
complex labor exemption issue posed but left unresolved in the Opinion.  There too Companies Mem. 6-8 is less than 
persuasive in responding to the analysis and questions posed in Opinion at 9-17.  Unions Mem. 5-12 does a better job on that 
score, including (in addition to its discussion of the directly relevant cases discussed in Opinion at 10-16) its citation to Bodine 
Produce, Inc. v. United Farm Workers Organization Committee, 494 F.2d 541, 557 (9th Cir. 1974) and Local 24, International 
Brotherhood of Teamsters v. Oliver, 358 U.S. 283, 3 L. Ed. 2d 312, 79 S. Ct. 297 (1959) (each of which arguably has some 
potential relevance for the exemption issue).  But the labor exemption question remains fact-bound as to the underlying disputes 
between Companies and the LCDs (see Opinion at 17, and the language of the Illinois Appellate Court in Yellow Cab quoted in 
Opinion at 6).  Because the denial of leave to amend is so solidly grounded in established laches principles, there is little to be 
gained by exploring the uncharted reaches of the exemption issue. "
108,*," Honorable Jim R. Carrigan, United States District Judge for the District of Colorado, sitting by designation. Honorable William E. 
Doyle heard oral argument but did not participate in the final decision in this matter. "
109,1," Plaintiffs did not ask the court to submit the antitrust claim under the Rule of Reason as an alternative theory of recovery. See 
app., vol. II, at 649. The district court directed a verdict for Central on the antitrust claim involving its allocation system, and 
plaintiffs have not appealed this decision. "
110,2," The Court has recognized that tying arrangements may have procompetitive justifications which make condemnation 
inappropriate without considerable market analysis. See NCAA v. Board of Regents, 468 U.S. 85, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 2962 n.26, 
82 L. Ed. 2d 70 (1984). Such market analysis, however, concerns only the elements which would establish a presumption of 
anticompetitive forcing. The same analysis should readily disclose cases of merely ""literal"" tying, cf.  Broadcast Music, Inc. v. 
CBS, 441 U.S. 1, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1, 99 S. Ct. 1551 (1979) (literal price fixing), and other situations in which the Rule of Reason 
properly applies. Cf.  AAA Liquors v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, 705 F.2d 1203, 1205-07 (10th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 461 
U.S. 919, 103 S. Ct. 1903, 77 L. Ed. 2d 290 (1983) (Rule of Reason applied to vertical pricing policy absent crucial element of 
coercion); Colorado Pump & Supply Co. v. Febco, Inc., 472 F.2d 637, 640-41 (10th Cir.) (full-line requirement challenged as 
tying arrangement analyzed by court in terms of elements warranting per se condemnation), cert. denied, 411 U.S. 987, 36 L. 
Ed. 2d 965, 93 S. Ct. 2274 (1973). "
111,3," Because the challenged allocation system was not unlawful under the per se rule and because plaintiffs have not challenged its 
legality under the Rule or Reason, we need not consider whether the evidence of a conspiracy between defendants was 
sufficient. "
113,4," Gulf urges that Fox and Myers remained free to market competing lines, to finance and sell additional GLC's as did more 
enterprising dealers, and to obtain RX-7's from fellow dealers. The decisive question, however, remains whether the 
discriminatory aspect of Gulf's allocation system could be viewed as a calculated attempt to compel termination. Although the 
availability of alternative sources of supply may bear upon whether Gulf could have reasonably expected to accomplish such a 
result, the record by no means eliminates the possibility of success. "
118,1," Patriot's four count complaint alleges various violations of Mass. Gen. Laws chs. 93, 93A, and 93F as well as intentional 
interference with advantageous business relationships."
118,2," Section 3 of the Judicial Improvements Act of 1985, Public Law No. 99-36, amends 28 U.S.C. ยง 1441, the removal statute, by 
adding a new subsection (e) which provides that the court to which a civil action is removed is not precluded from hearing and 
determining any claim in the action because the state court from which the action was removed did not have jurisdiction over "
119,," that claim. This affects claims in civil actions commenced in state courts on or after the date of enactment, June 19, 1986. This is 
too late for the instant claim but will certainly erase much of the procedural convolution which has historically marked removal 
jurisdiction. "
120,3," General Cinema urges the Court to take note of federal claims filed by Patriot against the same or virtually the same 
defendants in 1978 and 1982. Allegedly, the 1978 and 1982 complaints invoked federal antitrust law and referred to similar 
events which Patriot described in terms of an interstate conspiracy. The Court declines to consider such evidence because it 
deems such consideration beyond the minimalist ""peeking"" which the Supreme Court has seen fit to allow. "
121,4," It was to this end, indeed, that the Department of Justice, acting through the Law Enforcement Assistance ADministration, 
sponsored a series of courses in the late 1970's to train state court judges on the principles of federal antitrust law. See, e.g., 
Materials for State Antitrust Specialty Course, National Judicial College (Spring, 1980). "
134,1," General Dynamics defines this market as including the design, sale, leasing, installation, interconnection and maintenance of 
customer premises equipment, including the telephone instrument itself, key telephone systems, and private business exchange "
135,," (""PBX"") systems. See Complaint paras. 17(h), 18(b). Key telephone systems allow a single telephone to connect several other 
telephones through the use of buttons on the telephones. Jack Faucett Associates v. AT&T, 240 U.S. App. D.C. 103, 744 F.2d 
118, 120 (D.C.  Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1196, 105 S. Ct. 980, 83 L. Ed. 2d 982 (1985). PBX systems utilize a central 
console or switchboard to allow the interconnection of numerous lines. Id."
135,2," General Dynamics defines this market as including the development, manufacture and distribution of a broad range of 
equipment designed for use in conjunction with communications services, i.e., central office switching and transmission 
equipment and customer premises equipment. See Complaint para. 18(a)."
135,3," The issues General Dynamics seeks to estop AT&T from relitigating also arise in paragraph 46 of Count III, according to 
General Dynamics. "
136,4," When the Litton jury first returned its verdict finding AT&T guilty of monopolization, it had failed to reach unanimity on special 
interrogatories 16(a) (asking whether AT&T filed the interface tariff in bad faith), 16(i) (asking whether AT&T delayed in making 
cutovers in bad faith), and 7 (asking whether AT&T's attempted monopolization was a proximate cause of injury to the plaintiffs). 
Special interrogatory 16 listed nine alleged practices of AT&T, and asked the jury to identify the practices on which it based its 
finding of predatory conduct. Although the jury had failed to reach unanimity on special interrogatories 16(a) and 16(i), it 
answered in the affirmative with respect to three of the interrogatories: 16(b) (asking whether AT&T intentionally delayed in 
providing and installing interface devices), 16(c) (asking whether AT&T opposed certification in bad faith), and 16(h) (asking 
whether AT&T, in bad faith, refused to sell inside wiring at all or on a reasonable basis). "
137,," After the initial verdict, although the court was of the opinion that the answer to special interrogatory 16(c) could support the 
damage award, the court instructed the jury to return to deliberations to try to answer interrogatories 7, 16(a) and 16(i). The jury, 
after deliberating approximately a half hour, returned and found against AT&T on all three issues. The jury did not change the 
amount of damages it had already calculated, however. See Litton, 700 F.2d at 802-04; Glictronix, 603 F. Supp. at 565-66. A 
copy of the Litton jury verdict is attached to this opinion as Appendix ""A."" "
138,5," The Phonetele plaintiff manufactured ""Phonemaster,"" a toll and message-unit restriction device used in conjunction with PBX 
and key systems. The Wrede plaintiffs manufactured an automatic dialing device. In denying the plaintiff's request for collateral estoppel, the Phonetele court also found that the ""belated"" jury findings were 
""arguably"" unnecessary to the verdict. The Phonetele court also called into question the correctness of Litton's statement of the 
Noerr-Pennington doctrine. The Wrede court similarly found the ""belated"" jury findings unnecessary to the Litton verdict. 
Although the Wrede court did not find Litton's statement of the Noerr-Pennington doctrine incorrect, it found Litton's holding on 
this issue in conflict with Judge Greene's opinion in the Government case. "
139,6," General Dynamics names as defendants in this action all of AT&T's Bell Operating Companies (""BOCs""). Litton sued only 
seven of the BOCs.  However, prior to January 1, 1984, the date of the divestiture of AT&T, the Bell system, including all of the 
BOCs, was ""legally a single enterprise."" United States v. Western Electric Co., Inc., 569 F. Supp. 1057, 1070 (D.  D.C. 1983). 
See also United States v. AT&T, 552 F. Supp. at 202. This court therefore finds that the defendants comprised a single 
enterprise during the period of time relevant to this suit, and the BOCs not named as defendants in Litton were in privity with the 
Litton defendants during the relevant time period."
139,7," General Dynamics points out that AT&T's Petition for Certiorari in Litton acknowledges that there are, or have been, at least 
seventeen different cases brought against AT&T dealing with the interface tariff. See General Dynamics' Memorandum in 
Support of Motion For Determination of Collateral Estoppel at 12 and Tab ""2."" This court accordingly finds that, although General 
Dynamics and the other affected manufacturers may have been able to technically effect joinder in Litton, such joinder could not 
have occurred with ""ease."" See Starker v. United States, 602 F.2d 1341, 1349-50 (9th Cir. 1979). The court will therefore not 
deny estoppel on the basis that General Dynamics might have joined as a plaintiff in Litton. "
140,8," AT&T defined the systems as follows in its Petition for Certiorari, p. 2: A PBX includes a switchboard and a number of extension telephones. The PBX can switch calls from one extension 
telephone to another as well as permit outside calls to be placed and received. A key telephone system includes telephone sets with buttons or keys and certain common equipment. The keys give each 
telephone set access to more than one telephone line. See General Dynamics' Reply Memorandum at 64. General Dynamics also points out that the plaintiff in Selectron was a 
General Dynamics' distributor; therefore, that case involved exactly the same PBX and key systems involved in the present 
case. In Selectron, AT&T conceded, and the court found, that the Selectron product market was the same as that in Litton.  
Selectron, 587 F. Supp. at 859-60. "
141,9," The Litton parties stipulated that the relevant product market is the sale and lease of telephone terminal equipment consisting 
of PBX and key telephone systems. See Litton trial transcript at 18020. "
143,10," AT&T also contends that the Litton decision conflicts on the Noerr-Pennington issue with Southern Pacific Communications 
Co. v. AT&T, 556 F. Supp. 825 (D. D.C. 1982), aff'd 238 U.S. App. D.C. 340, 740 F.2d 1011 (1984), cert. denied 470 U.S. 1005, 
105 S. Ct. 1359, 84 L. Ed. 2d 380 (1985). The court in Southern Pacific found that a speech given by former AT&T Chairman, 
John deButts, before the FCC announcing AT&T's opposition to certification, is protected by the Noerr-Pennington doctrine.  
Southern Pacific, 556 F. Supp. at 894-902, 906-07. This court notes that it is not clear that the Litton jury or the Second Circuit 
made any findings concerning application of the Noerr-Pennington doctrine to the deButts speech. See Litton, 700 F.2d at 796, 
800, 811; Selectron, 587 F. Supp. at 865. Given the court's ruling that Judge Greene's Noerr-Pennington decision conflicts with 
Litton, however, the court need not decide whether Southern Pacific also conflicts with Litton on the Noerr-Pennington issue. AT&T also contends that certain ""decisions"" of the FCC and State regulatory agencies, and a report by the National Academy of 
Sciences (""NAS""), conflict with the Litton finding that AT&T filed the interface tariff in bad faith. Agency findings may be given 
preclusive effect where the agency acts in a judicial capacity and the party against whom estoppel will be applied had a full and 
fair opportunity to present its case to the agency.  EZ Loader Boat Trailers, Inc. v. Cox Trailers, Inc., 746 F.2d 375, 377-78 (7th 
Cir. 1984). However, the regulatory decisions and report at issue were not the result of adversarial proceedings, with all the 
accouterments of a trial; neither were they based on economic and competitive concerns under principles of antitrust law. 
Accord, Glictronix, 603 F. Supp. at 568-69; Selectron, 587 F. Supp. at 865-66. Therefore, the court will not deny estoppel based 
on the allegedly inconsistent regulatory decisions and report."
143,11," Two judges in the Litton appeal found the Noerr-Pennington defense inapplicable to AT&T's tariff filing and opposition to 
certification. Litton, 700 F.2d at 806-09. These judges found that AT&T's tariff filing amounted only to ""'private commercial 
activity, no element of which involved seeking to procure the passage or enforcement of laws.'"" Id. at 807 (quoting Continental 
Ore Co. v. Union Carbide and Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 707, 82 S. Ct. 1404, 1414, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1962)). These judges 
also found that AT&T's opposition to certification, instead of constituting mere advocacy of a position before the FCC, actually "
144,," constituted an attempt by AT&T to buy as much time as possible to improve its competitive position in the terminal equipment 
market.  Litton, 700 F.2d at 809. All three Litton appellate judges found that AT&T's actions fell within the sham exception. Id. at 809-12. According to the court, 
AT&T's consistent and ""baseless"" claim that the PCA requirement was necessary to protect the telephone network amounted to 
an abuse of the administrative process and effectively barred other terminal equipment competitors from access to the telephone 
network system. Id."
144,12," Specifically as to the sham exception, the court found: The sham exception . . . must be narrowly construed so as not to chill the rights of individuals and corporations to access to 
courts and to legislative and regulatory bodies. This principle would be hindered by a ruling which exposed an entity to 
antitrust liability on the basis that an official body found its contentions to be unsupported by the facts or otherwise without 
merit. To be a sham, the representation must go beyond the normal and legitimate exercises of the right to petition; it must 
amount to a subversion of the integrity of the process. And, absent special circumstances, this standard is not breached 
unless there is evidence of a series of misleading statements, of representations having the effect of actually barring 
access to an official body, or of an intent to mislead the body concerning central facts. The Court finds that the Bell 
statements at issue here are not in any of these categories. United States v. AT&T, 524 F. Supp. at 1364. "
145,13," Miller and its progeny did not concern the finality of alleged inconsistent judgments; rather, they dealt with the finality of 
decisions upon which parties sought collateral estoppel. The Faucett court found that the ""finality"" required for an inconsistent 
determination precluding estoppel and that required in order to utilize a case for offensive estoppel are not the same, and that it 
is enough if the inconsistent judgment ""undermines the court's confidence in the underlying decision."" Faucett, 744 F.2d at 130. 
The Glictronix court, on the other hand, found the finality requirements identical.  Glictronix, 603 F. Supp. at 573-74. This court 
need not decide whether the finality requirements are identical or whether less finality is required of an allegedly inconsistent 
decision, because Judge Greene's Noerr-Pennington decision is clearly sufficiently final under Miller."
145,14," Additionally, this court notes that HN8[
] collateral estoppel may apply to questions of law as well as to questions of fact. Speaker Sortation Systems v. United States Postal Service, 568 F.2d 46, 49 (7th Cir. 1978). See also Selectron, 587 F. Supp. at 
864 n. 19. This court finds Litton's enunciation of the Noerr-Pennington doctrine essentially in accord with the Seventh Circuit's 
position. Compare Litton, 700 F.2d at 812-13, with Havoco, 702 F.2d at 649-51. However, the court in Litton, 700 F.2d at 813, 
found that a plaintiff must demonstrate the sham exception by a preponderance of evidence, whereas the Seventh Circuit, in 
MCI Communications v. AT&T, 708 F.2d 1081, 1155 (7th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 891, 104 S. Ct. 234, 78 L. Ed. 2d 
226 (1983), held the plaintiff to the higher ""clear and convincing"" evidentiary standard. It is well established that HN9[
] 
changes in the burden of proof may defeat collateral estoppel claims.  Guenther v. Holmgreen, 738 F.2d 879, 888 (7th Cir. 
1984), cert.  denied, 469 U.S. 1212, 105 S. Ct. 1182, 84 L. Ed. 2d 329 (1985). See generally Wright, Miller and Cooper, supra, ยง 
4422 at 214-15. Accordingly, this court finds that granting collateral estoppel effect to the jury finding that AT&T opposed 
certification in bad faith would inappropriately foreclose relitigation of AT&T's Noerr-Pennington defense in this circuit. "
146,15," The court specifically held: We view this evidence as arguably probative of AT&T's position, and find it difficult to justify the exclusion of this decision in 
light of the admission of the various FCC rulings. Although there is a considerable difference in cost between the two 
interface devices, this goes more to the weight to be accorded the evidence than its admissibility; any confusion or 
prejudice probably could have been avoided by appropriate instructions. But we are also mindful of the fact that this was a 
complicated and extensive trial, involving four and one-half years of pretrial proceedings, five months of trial, more than 
18,000 pages of testimony and 945 exhibits. If a jury trial of this size and complexity is to be had at all, the trial court must 
have the discretion to limit the evidence at some point. We cannot find that this exclusion amounted to prejudicial error. Litton, 700 F.2d at 819."
146,16," The Faucett and Glictronix courts accepted AT&T's contention that it would have introduced more state regulatory decisions, 
but the Litton trial court's ruling would have applied to, and excluded, such decisions.  Faucett, 744 F.2d at 127; Glictronix, 603 
F. Supp. at 574-75."
146,17," AT&T also contends that it is now prepared to introduce a significant amount of evidence which goes to the heart of the 
allegations against it in this case. See Glictronix, 603 F. Supp. at 575-76; Selectron, 587 F. Supp. at 866-67. AT&T asserts that it 
did not introduce this evidence in Litton because some of this evidence came into existence after the Litton trial, and the 
significance of some of this evidence became apparent to AT&T only after the Litton trial. The Glictronix court found that at least a portion of AT&T's new evidence, consisting of the testimony of Walter Hinchman, ex-
Chief of the FCC's Common Carrier Bureau, in Southern Pacific, 556 F. Supp. 825, casts doubt on the trustworthiness of FCC 
decisions issued from 1974 through 1978.  Glictronix, 603 F. Supp. at 575-77. The Glictronix court accordingly denied collateral "
147,," estoppel on the issue of the reasonableness of AT&T's tariff filing and opposition to certification. Id. Given this court's ruling with 
respect to Litton's exclusion of the state regulatory decisions, the court need not consider whether the Hinchman testimony is 
""crucial"" evidence which AT&T failed to introduce during Litton through no fault of its own. "
151,1," The Plaintiffs' Unfair Trade Practices claim, counts seven (7) and eight (8) of the March 25, 1986, complaint, is clearly time

dismiss counts seven (7) and eight (8) is granted. Rule 12(b)(6), Fed. R. Civ. Proc. Additionally, the court's rulings from the bench at the September 30, 1986, hearing are to serve as the order of the court for all

162,5," HN6[
] A showing of antitrust injury is necessary, but not always sufficient, to establish standing under ยง 4, because a party 
may have suffered antitrust injury but may not be a proper plaintiff under ยง 4 for other reasons.  See generally Page, The Scope 
of Liability for Antitrust Violations, 37 Stan. L. Rev. 1445, 1483-1485 (1985) (distinguishing concepts of antitrust injury and 
antitrust standing).  Thus, in Associated General Contractors we considered other factors in addition to antitrust injury to 
determine whether the petitioner was a proper plaintiff under ยง 4.  459 U.S., at 540. As we explain, n. 6, infra, however, many of 
these other factors are not relevant to the standing inquiry under ยง 16. "
163,6," HN9[
] Standing analysis under ยง 16 will not always be identical to standing analysis under ยง 4.  For example, the difference 
in the remedy each section provides means that certain considerations relevant to a determination of standing under ยง 4 are not 
relevant under ยง 16.  The treble-damages remedy, if afforded to ""every person tangentially affected by an antitrust violation,"" 
Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready, 457 U.S. 465, 476-477 (1982), or for ""all injuries that might conceivably be traced to an 
antitrust violation,"" Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., 405 U.S., at 263, n. 14, would ""open the door to duplicative recoveries,"" id., at 
264, and to multiple lawsuits.  In order to protect against multiple lawsuits and duplicative recoveries, courts should examine 
other factors in addition to antitrust injury, such as the potential for duplicative recovery, the complexity of apportioning damages, 
and the existence of other parties that have been more directly harmed, to determine whether a party is a proper plaintiff under ยง 
4.  See Associated General Contractors, 459 U.S., at 544-545; Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720 (1977). Conversely, 
HN10[
] under ยง 16, the only remedy available is equitable in nature, and, as we recognized in Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., ""the 
fact is that one injunction is as effective as 100, and, concomitantly, that 100 injunctions are no more effective than one."" 405 
U.S., at 261. Thus, because standing under ยง 16 raises no threat of multiple lawsuits or duplicative recoveries, some of the 
factors other than antitrust injury that are appropriate to a determination of standing under ยง 4 are not relevant under ยง 16."

164,8," See also S. Rep. No. 698, 63d Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 2, pp. 17-18, 50 (1914).  Although the references to ยง 16 in the debates on 
the passage of the Clayton Act are scarce, those that were made are consistent with the House and Senate Reports.  For 
example, in this excerpt from a provision-by-provision description of the bill, Representative McGillicuddy (a member of the 
House Judiciary Committee) stated: ""Under the present law any person injured in his business or property by acts in violation of the Sherman antitrust law may 
recover his damage.  In fact, under the provisions of the law he is entitled to recover threefold damage whenever he is able to 
prove his case.  There is no provision under the present law, however, to prevent threatened loss or damage even though it be 
irreparable.  The practical effect of this is that a man would have to sit by and see his business ruined before he could take 
advantage of his remedy.  In what condition is such a man to take up a long and costly lawsuit to defend his rights? ""The proposed bill solves this problem for the person, firm, or corporation threatened with loss or damage to property by 
providing injunctive relief against the threatened act that will cause such loss or damage.  Under this most excellent provision a 
man does not have to wait until he is ruined in his business before he has his remedy.  Thus the bill not only protects the 
individual from loss or damage, but it relieves him of the tremendous burden of long and expensive litigation, often intolerable."" 
51 Cong. Rec. 9261 (1914) (emphasis added). Representative Floyd described the nature of the ยง 16 remedy in these terms: ""In section 16 . . . is a provision that gives the litigant injured in his business an entirely new remedy. . . . . HN12[
] "". . . [Section] 16 gives any individual, company, or corporation . . . or combination the right to go into court and enjoin 
the doing of these unlawful acts, instead of having to wait until the act is done and the business destroyed and then sue for 
damages. . . .  [So] that if a man is injured by a discriminatory contract, by a tying contract, by the unlawful acquisition of stock of 
competing corporations, or by reason of someone acting unlawfully as a director in two banks or other corporations, he can go 
into court and enjoin and restrain the party from committing such unlawful acts."" Id., at 16319. "
165,9," In its brief, Monfort also argues that it would be injured by ""the trend toward oligopoly pricing"" that could conceivably follow the 
merger. Brief for Respondent 18-20.  There is no indication in the record that this claim was raised below, however, and so we 
do not address it here."
165,10," In this case, Monfort has conceded that its viability would not be threatened by Excel's decision to lower prices: ""Because 
Monfort's operations were as efficient as those of Excel, only below-cost pricing could remove Monfort as an obstacle."" Id., at 
11-12; see also id., at 5, and n. 6 (""Monfort proved it was just as efficient as Excel""); id., at 18; 761 F.2d, at 576 (""Monfort would 
only be harmed by sustained predatory pricing"")."
165,11," Respondent finds support in the legislative history of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 for the view 
that Congress intends the courts to apply ยง 7 so as to protect the viability of small competitors. The Senate Report, for example, 
cites with approval this Court's statement in United States v. Von's Grocery Co., 384 U.S. 270, 275 (1966), that ""the basic 
purpose of the 1950 Celler-Kefauver Act [amending ยง 7 of the Clayton Act] was to prevent economic concentration in the 
American economy by keeping a large number of small competitors in business."" S. Rep. No. 94-803, p. 63 (1976).  Even if 
respondent is correct that Congress intended the courts to apply ยง 7 so as to keep small competitors in business at the expense 
of efficiency, a proposition about which there is considerable disagreement, such congressional intent is of no use to Monfort, "
166,," which has conceded that it will suffer only a loss of profits, and not be driven from the market, should Excel engage in a cost-
price squeeze. See n. 10, supra."
166,12," Most commentators reserve the term predatory pricing for pricing below some measure of cost, although they differ on the 
appropriate measure.  See, e. g., Areeda & Turner, Predatory Pricing and Related Practices under Section 2 of the Sherman 
Act, 88 Harv. L. Rev. 697 (1975); McGee, Predatory Pricing Revisited, 23 J. Law & Econ. 289 (1980) (reviewing various 
proposed definitions).  No consensus has yet been reached on the proper definition of predatory pricing in the antitrust context, 
however.  For purposes of decision in Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574 (1986), for example, 
we defined predatory pricing as either ""(i) pricing below the level necessary to sell their products, or (ii) pricing below some 
appropriate measure of cost."" Id., at 585, n. 8. Definitions of predatory pricing also vary among the Circuits.  Compare Arthur S. 
Langenderfer, Inc. v. S. E. Johnson Co., 729 F.2d 1050, 1056-1057 (CA6) (pricing below marginal or average variable cost 
presumptively illegal, pricing above such cost presumptively legal), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1036 (1984), with Transamerica 
Computer Co. v. International Business Machines Corp., 698 F.2d 1377 (CA9) (pricing above average total costs may be 
deemed predatory upon showing of predatory intent), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 955 (1983). Although neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals explicitly defined the term predatory pricing, their use of the term is 
consistent with a definition of pricing below cost.  Such a definition is sufficient for purposes of this decision, because only below-
cost pricing would threaten to drive Monfort from the market, see n. 9, supra, and because Monfort made no allegation that 
Excel would act with predatory intent.  Thus, in this case, as in Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., supra, 
we find it unnecessary to ""consider whether recovery should ever be available . . . when the pricing in question is above some 
measure of incremental cost,"" 475 U.S., at 585, n. 9, or whether above-cost pricing coupled with predatory intent is ever 
sufficient to state a claim of predation.  See n. 11, supra."
166,13," See also Brunswick, 429 U.S., at 489, n. 14 (""The short-term effect of certain anticompetitive behavior -- predatory below-cost 
pricing, for example -- may be to stimulate price competition.  But competitors may be able to prove antitrust injury before they 
actually are driven from the market and competition is thereby lessened""). "
167,14," The Court of Appeals may have relied on the District Court's speculation that the merger raised ""a distinct possibility . . . of 
predatory pricing."" 591 F.Supp., at 710. This statement directly followed the District Court's second observation that Monfort did 
not raise such a claim, however, and thus was clearly dicta."
167,15," Even had Monfort actually advanced a claim of predatory pricing, we doubt whether the facts as found by the District Court 
would have supported it.  Although Excel may have had the financial resources to absorb losses over an extended period, other 
factors, such as Excel's share of market capacity and the barriers to entry after competitors have been driven from the market, 
must also be considered. In order to succeed in a sustained campaign of predatory pricing, a predator must be able to absorb 
the market shares of its rivals once prices have been cut.  If it cannot do so, its attempt at predation will presumably fail, because 
there will remain in the market sufficient demand for the competitors' goods at a higher price, and the competitors will not be 
driven out of business.  In this case, Excel's 20.4% market share after the merger suggests it would lack sufficient market power 
to engage in predatory pricing. See Williamson, Predatory Pricing: A Strategic and Welfare Analysis, 87 Yale L. J. 284, 292 
(1977) (60% share necessary); Areeda & Turner, Williamson on Predatory Pricing, 87 Yale L. J. 1337, 1348 (1978) (60% share 
not enough).  It is possible that a firm with a low market share might nevertheless have sufficient excess capacity to enable it 
rapidly to expand its output and absorb the market shares of its rivals. According to Monfort's expert witness, however, Excel's 
postmerger share of market capacity would be only 28.4%.  1 App. 66.  Moreover, it appears that Excel, like the other large beef 
packers, operates at over 85% of capacity.  Id., at 135-136.  Thus Excel acting alone would clearly lack sufficient capacity after 
the merger to satisfy all or most of the demand for boxed beef. Although it is conceivable that Excel could act collusively with 
other large packers, such as IBP, in order to make the scheme work, the District Court found that Monfort did not ""assert that 
Excel and IBP would act in collusion with each other in an effort to drive others out of the market,"" 591 F.Supp., at 692. With only 
a 28.4% share of market capacity and lacking a plan to collude, Excel would harm only itself by embarking on a sustained 
campaign of predatory pricing. Courts should not find allegations of predatory pricing credible when the alleged predator is 
incapable of successfully pursuing a predatory scheme.  See n. 17, infra. It is also important to examine the barriers to entry into the market, because ""without barriers to entry it would presumably be 
impossible to maintain supracompetitive prices for an extended time."" Matsushita, 475 U.S., at 591, n. 15. In discussing the 
potential for oligopoly pricing in the beef-packing business following the merger, the District Court found significant barriers to 
entry due to the ""costs and delays"" of building new plants, and ""the lack of [available] facilities and the cost [$ 20-40 million] 
associated with refurbishing old facilities."" 591 F.Supp., at 707-708. Although the District Court concluded that these barriers 
would restrict entry following the merger, the court's analysis was premised on market conditions during the premerger period of 
competitive pricing. Ibid.  In evaluating entry barriers in the context of a predatory pricing claim, however, a court should focus on 
whether significant entry barriers would exist after the merged firm had eliminated some of its rivals, because at that point the 
remaining firms would begin to charge supracompetitive prices, and the barriers that existed during competitive conditions might 
well prove insignificant.  In this case, for example, although costs of entry into the current competitive market may be high, if 
Excel and others in fact succeeded in driving competitors out of the market, the facilities of the bankrupt competitors would then "
168,," be available, and the record shows, without apparent contradiction, that shut-down plants could be producing efficiently in a 
matter of months and that equipment and a labor force could readily be obtained, 1 App. 95-96.  Similarly, although the District 
Court determined that the high costs of building new plants and refurbishing old plants created a ""formidable"" barrier to entry 
given ""the low profit margins in the beef industry,"" 591 F.Supp., at 707, this finding speaks neither to the likelihood of entry 
during a period of supracompetitive profitability nor to the potential return on investment in such a period."
168,16," See Koller, The Myth of Predatory Pricing: An Empirical Study, 4 Antitrust Law & Econ. Rev. 105 (1971); Miller, Comments 
on Baumol and Ordover, 28 J. Law & Econ. 267 (1985)."
168,17," Claims of threatened injury from predatory pricing must, of course, be evaluated with care.  As we discussed in Matsushita 
Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., the likelihood that predatory pricing will benefit the predator is ""inherently uncertain: 
the short-run loss [from pricing below cost] is definite, but the long-run gain depends on successfully neutralizing the 
competition. . . . [and] on maintaining monopoly power for long enough both to recoup the predator's losses and to harvest some 
additional gain."" 475 U.S., at 589. Although the commentators disagree as to whether it is ever rational for a firm to engage in 
such conduct, it is plain that the obstacles to the successful execution of a strategy of predation are manifold, and that the 
disincentives to engage in such a strategy are accordingly numerous.  See, e. g., id., at 588-593 (discussing obstacles to 
successful predatory pricing conspiracy); R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 144-159 (1978); McGee, Predatory Pricing Revisited, 
23 J. Law & Econ., at 291-300; Posner, The Chicago School of Antitrust Analysis, 127 U. Pa. L. Rev. 925, 939-940 (1979). As 
we stated in Matsushita, ""predatory pricing schemes are rarely tried, and even more rarely successful."" 475 U.S., at 589. 
Moreover, the mechanism by which a firm engages in predatory pricing -- lowering prices -- is the same mechanism by which a 
firm stimulates competition; because ""cutting prices in order to increase business often is the very essence of competition . . . [;] 
mistaken inferences . . . are especially costly, because they chill the very conduct the antitrust laws are designed to protect."" Id., 
at 594. "
169,1," Whether or not it so intends, the Court in practical effect concludes that a private party may not obtain injunctive relief against a 
horizontal merger unless the actual or probable conduct of the merged firms would establish a violation of the Sherman Act. The 
Court suggests that, to support a claim of predatory pricing, a competitor must demonstrate that the merged entity is ""able to 
absorb the market shares of its rivals once prices have been cut,"" either because it has a high market share or because it has 
""sufficient excess capacity to enable it rapidly to expand its output and absorb the market shares of its rivals."" Ante, at 119-120, 
n. 15.  The Court would also require a competitor to demonstrate that significant barriers to entry would exist after ""the merged 
firm had eliminated some of its rivals. . . ."" Ante, at 120, n. 15.  Indeed, the Court expressly states that the antitrust laws ""require 
the courts to protect small businesses . . . only against the loss of profits from practices forbidden by the antitrust laws."" Ante, at 
116 (emphasis added).  By emphasizing postmerger conduct, the Court reduces to virtual irrelevance the related but distinct 
issue of the legality of the merger itself."
169,2," ""Broadly stated, the bill, in its treatment of unlawful restraints and monopolies, seeks to prohibit and make unlawful certain 
trade practices which, as a rule, singly and in themselves, are not covered by the act of July 2, 1890 [the Sherman Act], or other 
existing antitrust acts, and thus, by making these practices illegal, to arrest the creation of trusts, conspiracies, and monopolies 
in their incipiency and before consummation."" S. Rep. No. 698, 63d Cong., 2d Sess. 1 (1914). "
170,3," This Court has described the legislative purpose of ยง 7 as follows: ""[It] is apparent that a keystone in the erection of a barrier to what Congress saw was the rising tide of economic concentration, 
was its provision of authority for arresting mergers at a time when the trend to a lessening of competition in a line of commerce 
was still in its incipiency.  Congress saw the process of concentration in American business as a dynamic force; it sought to

momentum."" Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 317-318 (1962) (footnote omitted)."
170,4," Section ยง 16 states, in relevant part: ""Any person, firm, corporation, or association shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief, in any court of the United 
States having jurisdiction over the parties, against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws, including 
sections 13, 14, 18, and 19 of this title, when and under the same conditions and principles as injunctive relief against 
threatened conduct that will cause loss or damage is granted by courts of equity, under the rules governing such proceedings, 
and upon the execution of proper bond against damages for an injunction improvidently granted and a showing that the danger 
of irreparable loss or damage is immediate, a preliminary injunction may issue . . . ."" 15 U. S. C. ยง 26. "
171,5," In Brunswick, we reserved this question, stating: ""The issue for decision is a narrow one. . . .  Petitioner questions only whether 
antitrust damages are available where the sole injury alleged is that competitors were continued in business, thereby denying 
respondents an anticipated increase in market shares."" 429 U.S., at 484 (footnote omitted).  Nor did we reach the issue of a 
competitor's standing to seek relief from a merger under ยง 16 in Associated General Contractors of California, Inc. v. Carpenters, 
459 U.S. 519 (1983). Id., at 524, n. 5. "
172,6," 15 U. S. C. ยง 15. This Court has emphasized the importance of the statutory award of fees to private antitrust plaintiffs as part 
of the effective enforcement of the antitrust laws. In Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U.S. 100, 130-131 
(1969), the Court observed: ""[The] purpose of giving private parties treble-damage and injunctive remedies was not merely to provide private relief, but was 
to serve as well the high purpose of enforcing the antitrust laws."" See also Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. International Parts Corp., 392 U.S. 134, 139 (1968); Fortner Enterprises, Inc. v. United 
States Steel Corp., 394 U.S. 495, 502 (1969); Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., 405 U.S. 251, 262 (1972). "
175,1," Throughout this opinion the Court will use the term ""itinerant surgery"" as a shorthand reference to the practical definition 
applied by the ACS, i.e., the delegation of post-operative care to a non-surgeon. "
176,2," In its earlier opinion, the Court specifically noted that it was unnecessary to decide the per se vs. rule of reason question at that 
time.  That was true because the defendants' motion for partial summary judgment presented ""the single issue [of] whether the 
plaintiffs, or any of them, has suffered any injury cognizable under the antitrust law"" (Defendants' Reply Br. at 1), and because 
the analysis of standing in an antitrust case is the same no matter which theory governs the case.  Koefoot, 610 F. Supp. at 
1298. Now that the case has progressed to the trial stage, the issue is ripe for decision. "
177,3," If an antitrust plaintiff succeeds in proving a per se violation, the Jury will be instructed not to even consider defense evidence 
or arguments that there is in fact no anti-competitive effect resulting from the challenged conduct. The Jury will also not be 
permitted to consider any pro-competitive justifications offered by the defendants that might, under the rule of reason, validate 
what facially appears to be an illegal restraint. Cf., Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting, 441 U.S. 1, 21-23, 99 S. Ct. 
1551, 1562-1564, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1979). The advantages of a per se approach to antitrust plaintiffs are vast."
177,4," A complete description of Dr. Koefoot's practice is found in this Court's prior opinion. See Koefoot, 610 F. Supp. at 1301-2. "
179,5," The Court's decision to conduct this trial under the rule of reason has nothing to do with the fact that this case involves the 
medical profession, as opposed to any other learned profession. Cf., Jefferson Parish, 104 S. Ct. at 1556, 1565-6, n.12 and n. 
42."
179,6," The Court notes that in its earlier opinion, the Court stated that the itinerant surgery rule, on its face, ""seems to allow local 
surgeons to block competition with visiting surgeons by refusing to accept responsibility for post-operative care of patients."" 
Koefoot, 610 F. Supp. at 1305 (emphasis added). That statement merely acknowledges that the itinerant surgery rule, like other 
facially legitimate ethical canons (as the Court has defined that term), may have anticompetitive effects.  However, the itinerant 
surgery rule on its face does not refer to economic interests. Thus, under the Court's analysis, any antitrust challenge to the rule 
must be made under the rule of reason."
179,7," Even if the Supreme Court precedent was less clear, the Court would still conduct this case under the rule of reason. The Court 
does not believe that the conduct of the ACS falls neatly into any per se theory advanced by the plaintiff. The Court is no more 
willing than the Supreme Court was in Indiana Federation of Dentists to ""force"" this case into a per se pigeonhole. The Court is 
also unwilling to fashion a new per se category to fit the instant case. ""Per se rules are invoked when surrounding circumstances 
make the likelihood of anticompetitive conduct so great as to render unjustified further examination of the challenged conduct."" 
N.C.A.A.  v. Board of Regents, 104 S. Ct. at 2962 (footnote omitted). In the instant case, further examination is not only justified, 
it is essential if the jury is to make a reasoned judgment on the legality of the itinerant surgery rule."

179,9, The re-trial in Wilk is currently scheduled for the Spring of 1987. 
181,10," Chiropractic has been defined as ""the science which utilizes the recuperative powers of the body and the relationship between 
the musculoskeletal structures and functions of the body, particularly of the spinal column and the nervous system, in the

187,11," On December 2, 1986, the defendants' counsel sent the sample of exhibits to the Court along with a letter containing 
argument on the substance of the motion. On December 3, 1986, the Court received a letter from the plaintiffs' counsel objecting 
to the argumentative tone of the December 2, 1986, letter. As is this Court's practice, the arguments contained in the December 
2, 1986, letter were not considered by the Court.  The plaintiffs' counsel also objected to the manner in which the 
""representative"" exhibits were chosen. Both parties were informed by telephone on December 3, 1986, that the plaintiffs had 
until noon, December 4, 1986, to make a formal objection to the representative nature of the exhibits. Because the plaintiffs 
made no formal objection, the Court assumes that the concerns expressed in the December 2, 1986, letter were unfounded. The 
Court has placed both letters in the file to preserve the record. "
197,1," The defendant, Theodore W. Schell, an individual, is the principal shareholder of Ger-Shep, Inc., formerly Lancaster Valite, 
Inc., and KLP, Inc., formerly Bituminous Applicators, Inc. In October of 1981 Lancaster Valite, Inc., and Bituminous Applicators, 
Inc., sold assets to McMinn's Asphalt Co., Inc. After the sale of these assets, Lancaster Valite, Inc., changed its name to Ger-
Shep, Inc., and Bituminous Applicators, Inc., changed its name to KLP, Inc. Mr. Charles McMinn died prior to January 9, 1986, 
the date when the indictment in this case was returned. The government named Jeffrey G. Sweigart, individually, as a defendant 
in the indictment alleging that he, as an officer of McMinn's Asphalt Co., Inc., and McMinn's Asphalt Products, Inc., personally 
participated in the antitrust violations set forth in the indictment. "
198,2," The government's evidence established that other co-conspirators would submit complimentary bids over the bid price of the 
conspirator designated as the firm to receive the business of a particular municipality. The purported purpose of the 
complimentary bids was to create an appearance of legitimate bidding. "
199,3," Pennsylvania statutes require bid bonds in regard to bids over a specified dollar amount to municipalities and DGS. See Pa. 
Stat. Ann. cit. 8 ยง 193 (Purdon Supp. 1986). "
200,4," The jury instructions on this issue were based upon United States v. Smith, 789 F.2d 196 (3d Cir. 1986). "
201,5," In Link v. Mercedes-Benz of North America, Inc., 788 F.2d 918, 927 (3d Cir. 1986), the court noted that HN3[
] circumstantial 
evidence is sufficient to authenticate a document and that the burden on the proponent is slight. Clearly, this standard has been 
satisfied in regard to Exhibits 207A and 207B. "
203,6," As a curative instruction I told the jury, inter alia., ""[w]hether he was mistaken, his motives in doing what he did and all that kind 
of thing, are strictly for you, and I'm not trying to send any hints for you that I believe or disbelieve any particular witness."" Tr. 
Vol. 6 pp. 12-13. "
208,1," The Supreme Court recently affirmed a dismissal under the state action immunity doctrine because the allegedly 
anticompetitive municipal conduct ""logically would result from"" conduct authorized by the state legislature. Town of Hallie v. City 
of Eau Claire, 471 U.S. 34, 105 S. Ct. 1713, 1718, 85 L. Ed. 2d 24, 31 (1985)."
208,2," The important statutory provisions are found in ยงยง 21690.7 and 21690.8: The governing bodies of publicly owned or operated airports shall manage airport facilities and grant airport concessions in 
furtherance of the development of commerce and tourism in or affecting the state. In managing facilities and granting 
concessions for services to the public, such airport governing bodies shall promote the development of commerce and 
tourism by . . . (d) limiting or prohibiting business competition which is destructive of the ends of promoting commerce and 
tourism in the state; . . . . Cal. Pub. Util. Code ยง 21690.7 (West Supp. 1986). The Legislature recognizes that to further the policies and fulfill the objectives stated in this article, it is often necessary that 
publicly owned or operated airports enter into exclusive or limited agreements with a single operator or a limited number of 
operators. The governing bodies of publicly owned or operated airports shall grant exclusive or limited agreements to 
displace business competition with regulation or monopoly service whenever the governing body determines, in 
consideration of the factors set forth in Section 21690.9, that such agreements are necessary to further the policies and to 
fulfill the objectives stated in this article. The Legislature contemplates that publicly owned or operated airports will grant 
exclusive or limited agreements in furtherance of the policy of this state to displace business competition by exclusive or 
limited agreements to fulfill these policies and objectives. Cal. Pub. Util. Code ยง 21690.8 (West Supp. 1986). "
209,3," We agree with the district court that the state legislature has gone beyond the minimum expression of state policy required to 
establish municipal immunity under the state action immunity doctrine. See Town of Hallie v. City of Eau Claire, 471 U.S. 34, 105 
S. Ct. 1713, 1718, 85 L. Ed. 2d 24, 31 (1985) (state policy to displace competition may be inferred from grant of ""broad authority 
to regulate"")."
209,4," We do not decide the question whether preemption of a state statute by federal law other than antitrust law nullifies that state 
statute for purposes of conferring state antitrust immunity on municipalities. "
210,5," In other state antitrust immunity cases, this court has found that statutes enacted after allegedly anticompetitive conduct 
expressed pre-existing state policies to displace competition. See Mercy-Peninsula Ambulance v. San Mateo County, 791 F.2d 
755, 757 n. 1, 758 n. 2 (1986); Lorrie's Travel & Tours, Inc. v. SFO Airporter, Inc., Id. at 793."
210,6," Section 21690.9 states: Before entering any exclusive or limited agreement in connection with the management of any airport facility or the 
operation of any airport concession, the governing body of a publicly owned or operated airport shall, under authority 
hereby expressly delegated by the state, determine the necessity for an exclusive or limited agreement. The governing 
body shall consider the following factors to determine the necessity for an exclusive or limited agreement to further the 
policies and objectives stated in this article: (a) Public safety. (b) Public convenience. (c) Quality of service. (d) The need to conserve airport space. (e) The need to avoid duplication of services. (f) The impact on the environment or facilities of the airport as an essential commercial and tourist service center. (g) The need to avoid destructive competition which may impair the quality of airport services to the public, lead to 
uncertainty, disruption, or instability in the rendering of such services, or detract from the state's attractiveness as a center 
of tourism and commerce. In making its determination, the airport operator shall not be required to take evidence or to make findings of fact. Cal. Pub. Util. Code ยง 21690.9 (West Supp. 1986) (emphasis added)."
210,7," The lease states that the City ""as part of its program of developing [the airport] to its highest and best use"" commissioned the 
preparation of an airport development plan that ""establishes and determines the City's policies with respect to uses to be 
permitted and followed at and in the vicinity of the Airport."" The challenged lease was adopted pursuant to this development 
plan. "
215,*," Hon. William J. Campbell of the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by designation. "
229,1," See this Court's prior opinions, Huron Valley Hospital, Inc. v. City of Pontiac, 585 F. Supp. 1159 (E.D. Mich. 1984) and Huron 
Valley Hospital, Inc. v. City of Pontiac, 612 F. Supp. 654 (E.D. Mich. 1985), affirmed 792 F.2d 563 (6th Cir.), cert. denied 479 
U.S. 885, 93 L. Ed. 2d 254, 107 S. Ct. 278 (1986)."
229,2," Plaintiffs also name as defendants four officials of the Michigan Department of Public Health (MDPH). The state defendants are 
not before the Court on these motions for summary judgment."
229,3," In addition, defendants have submitted several motions in limine to exclude evidence, but the Court finds it is unnecessary to 
exclude the subject evidence to reach its decision. "
230,4," See this Court's opinion at 585 F. Supp. 1159 (1984) and Huron Valley Hospital, Inc. v. State Health Facilities Commission, 110 
Mich. App. 236, 312 N.W. 2d 422 (1981). "
243,5," 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 provides: Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of any State or Territory or the 
District of Columbia subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the 
jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be 
liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress. "
244,6," See also United States v. Price, 383 U.S. 787, 794, 16 L. Ed. 2d 267, 86 S. Ct. 1152 (1966) where the Court said: ""To act 
'under color' of law does not require that the accused be an officer of the State. It is enough that he is a willful participant in joint 
activity with the State or its agents."" (footnote omitted). "
245,7," Thus it is clear that the posture of this case differs from its posture when the court denied a similar motion to dismiss on state 
action grounds in 1985 in Huron Valley Hospital v. City of Pontiac, 612 F. Supp. 654. There, this Court was dealing only with 
plaintiff's allegations of actions involving both state and private actors, here the court has looked beyond plaintiff's mere 
allegations after extensive discovery to assess whether a reasonable jury could conclude a conspiracy existed between state 
and private actors to deprive plaintiff of its rights under the United States Constitution. "
246,8," Admittedly, Michigan courts have held that the law was improperly administered by MDPH when it reviewed plaintiff's 
application, but the impropriety the state courts have pinpointed is the lack of duly promulgated rules establishing criteria in the 
CON process. There is a dearth of evidence that the source of any state policy dating back to 1974 was a conspiracy involving 
defendants and any state representative."
246,9," By this statement, the Court intends to make no comment on the merits of plaintiff's ยง 1983 claims against the state defendants 
who are still in this action but not now before the Court. "
254,1," The Time defendants have submitted with this motion copies of the Franchise Agreement between the City of New York and 
Sterling Information Services, Ltd. (the ""Franchise Agreement"") and the 1974, 1975 and 1980 amendments to the Franchise 
Agreement. Manhattan Cable TV, Inc. is the successor franchisee under this Agreement."
254,2," By stipulation dated August 11, 1986, plaintiff dropped the City of New York and its officials (the ""City defendants"") as 
defendants in this case and has dismissed, with prejudice, its first claim for relief which had alleged conspiracies between the 
Time defendants and the City defendants (a) in restraint of trade in violation of ยง 1 of the Sherman Act and (b) to monopolize in 
violation of ยง 2. Accordingly, plaintiff's ยง 2 claims of actual and attempted monopolization against the Time defendants are the 
only antitrust claims remaining in this case. "
255,3, See supra note 1. 
256,4," One might also discuss this in terms of only two markets - retail and wholesale - in which the wholesale market is constrained 
by sale of the product to the ultimate consumer."
256,5," It is clear that programmers cannot, consistent with the Franchise Agreement, enter the market as retailers of cable-delivered 
services. But that is not the same as saying that they would not compete for the consumer's dollar if they had access to the 
lower Manhattan market. The flow of money is indirect, but HBO and Showtime, if it had access, would clearly be ""in 
competition"" when the consumer prepared to subscribe to a pay cable service. "
257,6," This issue is addressed in the section on standing. It must be noted here, though, that wholesale prices are routinely 
dependent on retail prices. See infra text at note 9. "
259,7," Although Associated General addressed standing under section 4 of the Clayton Act, most of the factors it delineated apply 
equally in actions for injunctive relief. See Ashley Meadows Farm, Inc. v. American Horse Shows Association, 617 F. Supp. 
1058, 1063 (S.D.N.Y. 1985); cf.  Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 111, 107 S. Ct. 484, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427 
n.6 (U.S. 1986) (""certain considerations relevant to a determination of standing under ยง 4 are not relevant under ยง 16"")."
259,8," This court is not bound by plaintiff's conclusory allegations of harm, see, e.g., SCM Corp. v. Radio Corp. of America, 407 F.2d 
166, 169-70 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 395 U.S. 943, 23 L. Ed. 2d 461, 89 S. Ct. 2014 (1969), and must consider whether plaintiff 
has pleaded any facts to support its contention. Cf.  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 507, 45 L. Ed. 2d 343, 95 S. Ct. 2197 (1975)."
259,9," The fact that the Committee's real complaint in this action seems to be the lack of a wider selection in pay services does not 
change this conclusion. "
260,10," If, for instance, it can be shown that subscribers' prices for television are lower in areas in which Showtime and HBO are both 
available, plaintiff may be able to make out a prima facie case of injury."
260,11," An increase in competition by improving quality rather than prices would be automatically passed on to subscribers, since 
MCTV apparently does not alter the programming it buys."
260,12," There are limits on how much MCTV can charge subscribers for its pay cable services, even if it holds a state-granted 
monopoly on cable operations. For instance, if its refusal to deal with unaffiliated programmers is found to be a violation of the 
antitrust laws, then a decision to buy a service such as Showtime but charge a price so high that no consumer would subscribe 
to it would constitute a de facto refusal to deal. "
262,13," As the Floken court noted, the cable operator was outside the ""literal language"" of the regulatory provisions only in the limited 
sense that it was not itself a transmitter of any signal over the airwaves and did not itself have power to authorize others to 
receive the signal. See 629 F. Supp. at 1469. It was, however, quite clearly within the contemplated scope of the provisions, 
which generally protect the integrity of communications over the airwaves. See 47 U.S.C. ยง 605(a). "
263,14," Section 4(f) provides that: Priority on Additional Channels shall be given to the use of the System's transmission capability by persons other than the 
Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates, to provide auxiliary communications services of kinds different from those provided 
over the other types of Channels specified herein. There shall be open, non-discriminatory access to such Channels within 
the limits of available capacity. . . . If at any time after five years from the effective date of this contract the Board 
determines, following a public hearing on notice, that rendition of any auxiliary service by the Company or a subsidiary or 
affiliate has tended to create a monopoly or to restrain trade, the Board may issue such direction relating thereto as it 
deems appropriate to protect the public interest, including an order to discontinue one or more particular services or to 
divest any financial interest in the entity operating such service or services within a reasonable time."
263,15," Section 4(1) provides that: The Company shall make available its Pay Television channels to all persons on a first-come, first-served basis at 
nondiscriminatory rates and terms to the same class of user irrespective of whether such users are subsidiaries or affiliates 
of the Company . . . . In the event the Company offers billing, audience promotion, or any other services, including but not 
limited to the installation or rental of equipment, to any channel user offering Pay Television, including subsidiaries or 
affiliates of the Company, or in the event that the Company itself uses any such services, then the Company shall make 
available identical services to other persons desiring to use channels at non-discriminatory rates and terms to the same 
class of user. All rates charged by the Company, its subsidiaries, affiliates or other users to subscribers of Pay Television 
shall be on a non-discriminatory basis to the same class of subscriber."
263,16, See supra note 1. 
264,17," The Committee asks the court to apply more liberal standards when the third party beneficiary claimant seeks purely injunctive 
relief rather than damages. While it is true that courts have been concerned that a finding of liability would impose a ""crushing 
burden"" on government and those with whom it contracts, H.R. Moch Co. v. Rensselaer Water Co., 247 N.Y. 160, 165, 159 N.E. 
896, 897-98 (1928), a concern absent here, plaintiff cites no authority in support of this proposition. In fact, the New York courts 
apply identical standards to injunctive and damages actions. E.g., Associated Flour Haulers & Warehousemen, Inc. v. Hoffman, 
282 N.Y. 173, 26 N.E.2d 7 (1940); Airco Alloys Division, Airco, Inc. v. Niagara Mohawk Power Corp., 76 A.D.2d 68, 430 
N.Y.S.2d 179 (4th Dep't 1980); Westhampton House, Inc. v. Carey, 506 F. Supp. 215 (E.D.N.Y. 1980). "
265,18," In light of the disposition of the Cable Act claim, supra, this court need not consider the constitutionality of ยง 612 of the Cable 
Act. "
267,19," The Committee has withdrawn the first claim by stipulation dated August 11, 1986. See supra note 2. "
276,1," 15 U.S.C. ยง 1 provides in relevant part: ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint 
of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."""
276,2," 15 U.S.C. ยง 2 states: ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other 
person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be 
deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding fifty thousand dollars, or by 
imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court."""
276,3," Counts II, III, IV and V were dismissed pursuant to motion, with consent of Hudson, at the end of Hudson's case. However, 
allegations concerning the use of trademarks remain in the case to the extent the allegations or facts so developed affect the 
allegations with regard to sections one and/or two of the Sherman Act. (Trans. 10/14 at 50 to 78.)"
276,4," The parties have not indicated what is meant by the term ""unified;"" apparently, the two associations merged in some manner."
276,5," Legend devoted significant efforts in its briefs toward establishing a defense to the alleged antitrust violations under the 
Capper-Volstead Act, 7 U.S.C. ยง 291. The Capper-Volstead Act exempts from antitrust liability certain activities undertaken by 
""farm cooperatives"" which ""seek to achieve the lawful aims of the cooperative movement."" Alexander v. National Farmers "
277,," Organization, 687 F.2d 1173, 1182 (8th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 938, 77 L. Ed. 2d 314, 103 S. Ct. 2110 (1983). 
Because Hudson has failed to carry its burden in this case of establishing an antitrust violation, it is unnecessary to determine 
whether, under Capper-Volstead, Legend is a ""farm cooperative"" and whether its challenged practices are within the scope of 
Capper-Volstead."
277,6," The minimum sale requirement of 1200 pelts is not economically significant and accounts for only a very small part of an 
average rancher's production for a given year. "
279,7," Throughout this opinion reference may be made to the Blackglama trademark since it is the main focus of this action. However, 
all trademarks now within control of Legend are within the scope of this action. "
282,8, See Finding 5 concerning the minimum sales requirement necessary to maintain voting membership with Legend. 
286,9," Testimony was offered to establish the problems encountered with the January auction were corrected by Hudson. [Trans. 
10/14 at 193:25 - 194:5.] Nevertheless, the threat of these problems remained and was a factor which the Legend Board of 
Directors kept in mind. See Finding 110. "
288,10," Hudson has neither focused on the boycott aspect of its complaint nor argued it in its summation. The boycott contention has 
been effectively abandoned; and, in any event, the evidence submitted does not support the allegation. See Rothery Storage & 
Van Co. v. Atlas Van Lines, Inc., 253 U.S. App. D.C. 142, 792 F.2d 210, 215-16 (D.C. Cir. 1986). "
293,11," Plaintiff submitted exhibits P-84 to P-87 to demonstrate the ranchers were and "". . . are being coerced into dealing with SFX to 
the exclusion of Hudson. . . ."" Interim Trial Memorandum on behalf of Hudson at 3. Legend objected to this proffer because of 
lack of authentication, hearsay and relevancy. Legend's Brief in Opposition. These documents are admissible under Fed. R. Evid. 803(3); Legend's arguments are not sufficient to prevent admissibility. 
However, the weight to be accorded to these documents, as well as P-107 - P-114, is slight. I note the wording of P-84 and P-
107 - P-114 is, in pertinent part, identical suggesting an orchestrated effort. Moreover, the thrust of the complaints is inaccurate. 
For example, P-85 expresses the wish of the Iowa Fur Farmers to be able to market their fur pelts at whatever auction house 
they choose.  This is incorrect; the Legend restriction concerns only the availability of the trademarks. In substance, these 
documents do not establish coercion as alleged by Hudson. "
295,12," See slip op. at pages 56 to 59 for an explanation of the business purpose and intent with regard to the adoption of the 
restriction on the availability of the trademarks."
295,13, Nor does the other evidence submitted by Hudson establish coercion.  See footnote 11.
295,14," In Aspen Skiing, defendant, a competitor with monopoly power changed its ski lift ticket policies which rendered plaintiff's ski 
facility substantially less desirable to consumers. These circumstances are not present in this case. Legend does not have 
monopoly power nor has it been proved that pelts without the trademark are less desirable, per se.  The trademark is simply not 
an essential facility. Denial of access to the Blackglama trademark (or any other trademark at issue) will not give Legend 
exclusive control of all practical means of competition or the power to exclude or reduce competition in violation of the Sherman 
Act. See also Terminal R.R. Ass'n, supra."
295,15," As indicated, Hudson has not proved a market limited enough to permit the inference that Legend has leverage in such 
market. "
297,16," As noted in footnote 3, Hudson's claims concerning interference with contractual relationships and economic advantage were 
dismissed with its consent at the end of its case. "
299,1, Alan M. Rosen is the Vice-President of Finance of Hudson.

requirement of Rule 60 (b)(2): whether the evidence is ""of such a nature that it would probably change the outcome."" Stridiron, 
698 F.2d at 207. "
306,*," According to Professor Areeda, all of the reasoning of the Court . . .  equates sister corporations with subsidiaries. The total 
unity of the corporate enterprise is equally reflected in both. In refusing to make corporate form determinative and in refusing to 
treat wholly-owned corporations differently from unincorporated divisions, the Copperweld holding also denies conspiratorial 
capacity to sister corporations' dealings with each other. VII P. Areeda, Antitrust Law ยง 1464f (1986). "
314,1," The Guimond suit was filed prior to the Belfiore suit after the Times began T-Route delivery in the area of a single Fairfield 
County dealer, Louis Guimond. For purposes of this motion, plaintiff Guimond has adopted the Belfiore plaintiffs' Memorandum 
of Law in Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment."
314,2," The admitted sponsor and orchestrator of this litigation is the Metropolitan Routedealers Association (""MRA""), a trade 
association. Since at least 1977, the MRA has been amassing a ""legal fund"" to challenge the Times should it ever attempt to 
modify or eliminate the independent dealer system of home delivery. See Dep. of B. Hochhauser, President of the MRA, at pp. 
452-460 and Hochhauser Exhibits 15 & 47. The MRA's objective, as summarized by one Fairfield County dealer who chose not 
to be a plaintiff, is ""getting the Times to get the hell out of my area."" D. Young Dep. at p. 317. "
315,3," Four pendent state claims are also alleged: unfair methods of competition under the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, 
Conn. Gen.  Stat. ยง 42-110b et seq. (Count 6); violation of the Connecticut Antitrust Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. ยง 35-26 et seq. (Count 
7); violation of the Connecticut Franchise Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. ยง 42- 133(e) (Count 8); and tortious interference with contract 
(Count 9). In light of the resolution of the present motion, the Court need not address their merits."
315,4," See e.g., Paschall v. Kansas City Star Co., 727 F.2d 692, 704 (8 Cir.) (en banc), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 872, 83 L. Ed. 2d 152, 
105 S. Ct. 222 (1984) (""We find it hard to ignore that every other antitrust case brought against a newspaper publisher 
challenging the newspaper's decision to forwardly integrate into distribution has been resolved in favor of the newspaper"")."
315,5," In Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 368 U.S. 464, 473, 7 L. Ed. 2d 458, 82 S. Ct. 486 (1962), the Supreme Court 
stated that HN1[
] ""summary procedures should be used sparingly in complex antitrust litigation where motive and intent play 
leading roles, the proof is largely in the hands of the alleged conspirators, and hostile witnesses thicken the plot."" However, later 
in First Nat'l Bank v. Cities Service Co., 391 U.S. 253, 20 L. Ed. 2d 569, 88 S. Ct. 1575 (1968), the Supreme Court made it clear 
that Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e) should not be read out of antitrust cases.  While recognizing the importance of preserving litigants' 
rights to a trial on their claims, the Court was ""not prepared to extend those rights to the point of requiring that anyone who files 
an antitrust complaint setting forth a valid cause of action be entitled to a full-dress trial notwithstanding the absence of any 
significant probative evidence tending to support the complaint."" Id. at 288-90. In Matsushita Electric Indus. Co.  v. Zenith Radio 
Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986), the Supreme Court has reinforced the message of Cities Service 
that summary judgment is appropriate ""if the factual context renders respondents' claim implausible -- [and] if the claim is one 
that simply makes no economic sense . . . ."" Id. at 1356. In accordance with this reasoning, the Second Circuit has affirmed the 
grant of summary judgment in antitrust cases.  Reborn Enter., Inc. v. Fine Child, Inc., 754 F.2d 1072 (2 Cir. 1985); Triple M. 
Roofing Corp. v. Tremco, Inc., 753 F.2d 242 (2 Cir. 1985); Nifty Foods Corp. v. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., 614 F.2d 832 (2 
Cir. 1980); Modern Home Inst., Inc. v. Hartford Accident & Indemnity Co., 513 F.2d 102 (2 Cir. 1975). In a separate opinion filed this date the Court has denied the plaintiffs' motion to file a second amended complaint. "
316,6," HN4[
] Section 2 of the Sherman Act makes it unlawful to ""monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire . . . to monopolize"" any part of interstate or foreign commerce."
316,7," As argued by defendants, allegations of interference with deliveries, disparagement and misinformation made at the outset of 
this litigation have not been substantiated, and plaintiffs have admitted that whatever problems may have existed at the start-up "
317,," of the T-Route expansion have long since been alleviated. Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendants' Motion for Summary 
Judgment at 32 n.16, and citations therein. "
318,8," Professor Areeda interprets the controversy regarding publisher's vertical integration as follows: The antitrust controversy arises when the publisher decides to shift to self-wholesaling or self-retailing. There have been 
several motives for doing so. Perhaps most important is the publisher's conclusion that his circulation goals are not fully 
shared by an independent wholesaler. The latter's profits are entirely a function of his wholesale-retail margin and his 
volume, while the publisher's profits are a function both of (1) the wholesale price, publication cost, and volume of 
newspapers sold and (2) advertising revenue, which also depends upon circulation volume. This means that increased 
circulation volume is more valuable to the publisher than to the dealer . . . . The implications are two-fold. The publisher has 
a greater incentive (1) to assure higher quality service to subscribers than an independent distributor and also (2) to 
eliminate any excess costs or margins at the distribution levels. Moreover, because the distributors do not compete with 
each other, there is no market pressure on the dealers to hold their margins down and service up. Of course, the publisher 
might attempt to supervise the dealer's service by contract, but precedent condemns the contractual limitation of maximum 
prices. The publisher may therefore conclude that self-distribution would improve service and minimize prices to 
subscribers."
318,9," In an April 26, 1984 letter from A. Adelberg to the Special Master, plaintiffs more specifically defined the alleged market for this 
count as ""the home delivery of morning newspapers in that portion of Fairfield County served by [wholesaler] Standard News 
Company."" Because, even under the plaintiffs narrowly defined market, the Court finds that the second element of an attempt to 
monopolize claim is not satisfied, the Court need not reach the issue of whether this definition constitutes a legally cognizable 
market. See, e.g., Neugebauer, 474 F. Supp. at 1062 (rejecting argument that home delivery was separate market because it 
turned ""on how defendant Abell distributed its product rather than on the nature of what was being distributed""). "
319,10," Callcenter Services, Inc. (""CSI,"" sued as MCI Corporation), which serves as the ""telephone agent"" for the Times, is also a 
defendant in this suit. "
320,11," HN14[
] Whether two actors constitute distinct economic entities for purposes of a Sherman Act violation is determined by 
the economic realities of their relationship.  Knutson v. Daily Review, Inc., 548 F.2d 795, 801-02 (9 Cir. 1976). As noted in 
Fuchs, in the context of a principal/agent relationship this analysis requires consideration of a number of elements, including: 
whether the agent performs a function on behalf of his principal other than securing an offer from a buyer for the principal's 
product; the degree to which the agent is authorized to exercise its discretion concerning the price and terms under which the 
principal's product is to be sold; and whether use of the agent constitutes a separate step in the vertical distribution of the 
principal's product. If an actor is merely a ""conduit"" for another actor, there is not a Sherman Act violation.  602 F.2d at 1031 n.5. Review of these criteria in the case sub judice reveals that those entities described above were merely agents employed by the 
Times to implement its expanded system of direct distribution. See Amended Complaint paras. 12, 13 (using ""agents"" 
characterization)."
320,12," HN16[
] Section 1 of the Sherman Act states: "
321,," Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the 
several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal . . . ."
321,13," As noted by defendants, plaintiffs' counsel agreed in the course of the issue definition process before the Special Master, that 
HN19[
] to make out a vertical price fixing claim ""it is insufficient for a plaintiff to show that participation in a generally available 
market promotion of [the Times' newspaper] was conditioned by [the Times], acting independently, upon a dealer's compliance 
with the terms and conditions of the promotion, including price reduction, or that it would be unavailable to the dealer who did not 
adhere to the price."" Report of Special Master, August 11, 1984, p. 17, para. 14."
321,14," Plaintiff Blakeslee maintained in his deposition that he received direct threats on nearly every aspect of his business from 
every person in the Times' Circulation Department involved in home delivery in his area. See, Blakeslee Dep. pp. 241, 728, 729. 
Even if this testimony were believable, it would not, standing in contrast to the overwhelming evidence in the record 
demonstrating the absence of coercion, be sufficient to defeat summary judgment. See Reborn Enter., Inc. v. Fine Child, Inc., 
590 F. Supp. 1423, 1440 (S.D.N.Y. 1984) (one dealer's deposition testimony that he was threatened was insufficient to defeat 
summary judgment), aff'd, 754 F.2d 1072 (2 Cir. 1985)."
321,15," For example, at the start of T-Route expansion, full-week service from a T-Route for a four-week period cost $16.00, while 
plaintiffs' prices for the same service ranged from more than $19 to almost $26. "
322,16," The Second Circuit in Yentsch made clear what degree of ""coercion"" must be present to prevail on a price fixing claim: HN21[
] While evidence of exposition, persuasion, argument, or pressure is alone insufficient to establish coercion . . . 
threats of termination, as long as they secure adherence to the fixed price, have been deemed to trespass beyond the 
boundaries of Colgate, thereby triggering a finding of an illegal combination."
322,630, F.2d at 53.
322,17," The Court notes incidentally that to the extent that plaintiffs' atmosphere of coercion theory relies upon alleged coercive 
conduct occurring prior to September 20, 1978, it must fail. See 15 U.S.C ยง 15b (establishing four-year statute of limitations). 
And alleged coercive acts applied to non-plaintiff dealers, cannot support plaintiffs' claims unless they had actual knowledge of 
and were directly affected by the same. See Hewitt v. Joyce Beverages, Inc., 721 F.2d 625, 628 (7 Cir. 1983). "
324,1," This opinion (1) will assume familiarity with the factual statement in the Opinion, (2) will follow the same usage of defined terms 
and (3) will refer to the parties' most recent memoranda as ""Unions Mem.--"" and ""Companies Mem.--."""
324,2," ""[L]eave [to amend the pleadings] shall be freely given when justice so requires."" "
325,3," That differentiates this case from Components, Inc. v. Western Electric Co., 52 F.R.D. 379 (D. Me. 1971), on which Companies 
seek to rely. There the court had stayed discovery and trial of patent misuse issues ( id. at 381-82). It was thus both 
understandable and proper for the court to permit plaintiff, at a later date, to amend its complaint to assert the invalidity of the 
patents that had allegedly been misused."
325,4," See Textor v. Board of Regents, 711 F.2d 1387, 1391 (7th Cir. 1983); UNR Industries, Inc. v. Continental Insurance Co., 623 
F.Supp. 1319, 1324-25 (N.D. Ill. 1985) (discussing Textor in light of Foman) and cases cited there. "
326,5, See the description of that case in Opinion at 15-16 & n.13.
326,6," Second Amended Complaint P11 alleges only that ""fewer drivers applied to rent [Companies'] taxicabs, and fewer taxicabs 
were available to serve the public."" Unions Mem. 4 n.* denies Unions and the LCDs engaged in price fixing, characterizing their 
activity instead as:"
326,7," Companies' Memorandum is shot through with misunderstanding or mischaracterization (or both) of the relevant issues. Thus 
Opinion at 18 n.15 referred to the four-year limitation period for antitrust claims, not as barring Companies' current effort as a 
matter of law (Rule 15(c) would prevent that result) but ""to inform the proper measure of the delay factor for laches purposes."" "
327,," Companies Mem. 3 simply misses the point, labeling that well-established concept as an ""effective repeal[]"" of Rule 15(c). But 
see Naxon Telesign, 517 F.Supp. at 807-08 & n.2, 686 F.2d at 1265 (passage of limitations period creates presumption of 
unreasonable prejudicial delay, shifting burden to plaintiff to excuse delay)."
327,8," Having denied Companies leave to amend on laches (delay -- plus-prejudice) grounds, this Court need not reach the more 
complex labor exemption issue posed but left unresolved in the Opinion. There too Companies Mem. 6-8 is less than persuasive 
in responding to the analysis and questions posed in Opinion at 9-17. Unions Mem. 5-12 does a better job on that score, 
including (in addition to its discussion of the directly relevant cases discussed in Opinion at 10-16) its citation to Bodine Produce, 
Inc. v. United Farm Workers Organization Committee, 494 F.2d 541, 557 (9th Cir. 1974) and Local 24, International Brotherhood 
of Teamsters v. Oliver, 358 U.S. 283 (1959) (each of which arguably has some potential relevance for the exemption issue). But 
the labor exemption question remains fact-bound as to the underlying disputes between Companies and the LCDs (see Opinion 
at 17, and the language of the Illinois Appellate Court in Yellow Cab quoted in Opinion at 6). Because the denial of leave to 
amend is so solidly grounded in established laches principles, there is little to be gained by exploring the uncharted reaches of 
the exemption issue. "
330,*," Of the Fifth Circuit, sitting by designation."
330,1," The defendants in this appeal are the company and executive Charles M. Hartman. The jury found for Thomas E. Taylor, and 
the district court granted a judgment n.o.v. for Gene E. Hollen."
330,2, Electronic thermometers provide digital displays of a patient's temperature. 
332,3," As part of its instructions to the jury on the elements of a cause of action, the district court stated: ""As I understand the alleged misrepresentations, and I interpret them from the complaint, the initial paper which instituted 
this action, they at least are alleged to be the following."" The court then listed the four alleged misrepresentations and the series of omissions described below. Plaintiffs objected to this 
instruction, claiming that the evidence showed other misrepresentations upon which the jury could base a finding of fraud. 
Although plaintiffs list a series of additional misrepresentations in their brief on appeal, they do not appeal the district court's 
limitation to the four misrepresentations and the series of omissions presented to the jury. We therefore consider the issue of 
whether the court properly limited the statements as outside the scope of this appeal. "
334,4," Speculating on exceptions, however, would serve no present purpose. "
335,5," In this discussion, we consider misrepresentations (2) and (3) as listed in Section I, supra. The allegedly fraudulent aspect of 
each of those misrepresentations is the description of the Arbrook thermometer, Survalent, as an ""IVAC-type"" thermometer. We 
therefore treat these two misrepresentations as one, as did the district court. "
337,6," To the extent that failure to reveal that Survalent infringed part of the Meditemp patent is equivalent to the failure to disclose 
that Survalent had a pulse-counting feature, the alleged misrepresentation is covered by the alleged nondisclosure that we 
already have concluded is worthy of jury determination."
337,7," At trial, plaintiffs argued three bases for a breach of contract claim: (1) violation of a provision in the main contract stating that 
all warranties and representations were true; (2) violation of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and (3) failure to abide 
by the side agreement. Plaintiffs apparently have abandoned the first two theories on appeal."
337,8," Plaintiffs seem to argue that defendants also breached a contractual agreement to return a ""going business"" to them. It may 
well be that the provisions of the side letter agreement would be valuable to plaintiffs only in the event the Meditemp business 
still was viable at the time of the reassignment of assets, but the contract does not assure plaintiffs that Johnson & Johnson 
would be returning a ""going business."""
337,9," The description of the events leading to the shutdown of the Meditemp business is drawn largely from defendants' brief. 
Plaintiffs do not suggest that the significant facts are inaccurate. "
338,10, These counterclaims were dismissed prior to trial.
338,11," We suspect that plaintiffs' failure to prove a viable contract claim stems from their failure to formally plead such a claim. We 
decline, however, to consider defendants' argument that plaintiffs should be foreclosed from making this claim at all, and instead 
follow the district court's decision to consider the claim on the merits. "
339,12," Although we need not address this issue in light of our disposition of the fraud claim, the interests of judicial economy 
prompted us to dispose of it now rather than at the time of a possible later appeal."
339,13," We do not consider defendants' argument on the amount of damages. In the event a new jury finds liability for fraud, it should 
reach its own determination of plaintiffs' damages. See Gasoline Products Co. v. Champlin Refining Co., 283 U.S. 494, 500, 75 
L. Ed. 1188, 51 S. Ct. 513 (1931) (""Where the practice permits a partial new trial, it may not properly be resorted to unless it 
clearly appears that the issue to be retried is so distinct and separable from the others that a trial of it alone may be had without 
injustice. "
341,1," Plaintiff's state court complaint also set forth a cause of action for defamation, and injury to reputation on behalf of both the 
Printing Mart corporation and its president, Lawrence Qualiano. See Counts Two and Three of the Complaint. As these claims 
have little relevance to a determination of claim preclusion between the state and federal suits, the court does not address them 
in its opinion."
341,2," After filing the federal RICO complaint plaintiff obtained a copy of the investigative report through discovery. See Exhibit E 
attached to Plaintiff's Brief. "
342,3," RICO plaintiffs are required to plead the alleged fraud with particularity as set forth in Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure. Courts have been careful to require specificity in RICO actions recognizing that a false charge of racketeering can 
damage a defendant's reputation. See Seville Machinery Corp v. Southmost Machinery Corp, 742 F.2d 786 (3rd Cir. 1984), cert 
denied, 469 U.S. 1211, 84 L. Ed. 2d 327, 105 S. Ct. 1179 (1985); see also Spencer v. Agency Rent-a-Car, Inc., Fed. Sec. L.  
Rep. (CCH) Section 98,361 at 92,217 (D. Mass. 1981)."
342,4," Defendants Rosenthal and Laurriet Printing are represented by separate counsel from defendants Essenfeld, Sinoway and 
Sharp Electronics.  These defendant groups have each submitted separate briefs, but all make the same arguments in favor of 
dismissal."
342,5," There is nothing in the language of the federal RICO statute to indicate that it repeals and/or supercedes the full faith and credit 
clause. While various courts have split on the determination of this issue, the Seventh Circuit recently ruled that the statutory 
language of RICO, ""does not provide any reason to believe that any part was intended"" to relieve federal courts of their 
obligation to apply state preclusion law to state court decisions. See County of Cook v. Midcon Corp., 773 F.2d 892 (7th Cir. 
1985). The Supreme Court has reached the same conclusion with respect to other statutes. See Kremer v. Chemical 
Construction Corp., 456 U.S. 461, 72 L. Ed. 2d 262, 102 S. Ct. 1883 (1982) (no partial repeal in Title VII); Allen v. McCurry, 449 
U.S. 90, 66 L. Ed. 2d 308, 101 S. Ct. 411 (1980) (no partial repeal in Section 1983)."
342,6," Rule 4:27-1(b) states: ""Mandatory joinder. Each party to an action shall assert therein all claims which he may have against any 
other party thereto insofar as may be required by application of the entire controversy doctrine"". "
343,7," New Jersey Court Rule 4:37-2(d) provides that a dismissal for failure to state a cause of action is a decision on the merits for 
res judicata purposes. See 1 B. Moore, Federal Practice, Section 0.409 [1] 2d Ed. 1942. The parties agree that the state court 
ruling was a final judgment. Plaintiff though challenges the validity of the state court judgment alleging that the judgment was obtained by fraud. This court 
finds no support in the record for this bald assertion. Plaintiff contends that defendants obstructed plaintiff's discovery efforts and 
wrongfully withheld information necessary to plead the RICO claim until after a final decision was rendered. Yet, there is no 
evidence that any delay in discovery prior to the state court dismissal was maliciously motivated. See Affidavit of Michael Meisel; 
see also Reply Certification to Meisel Affidavit. Moreover, this court concludes that plaintiff had sufficient information to plead its "
344,," RICO claim at the time it instituted the state court action such that the lack of discovery cannot excuse plaintiff's failure to raise 
this claim."
344,8," The state trial court in Maplewood Bank & Trust, supra, did not have access to the Seventh Circuit's opinion before issuing its 
own and therefore made no effort to distinguish the Seventh Circuit's logic. In fact, the state court in Maplewood relied on the 
earlier trial court opinion in Midcon, which, contrary to the later circuit opinion, rejected the notion of concurrent RICO jurisdiction. "
346,9," Preclusion under the entire controversy doctrine is generally appropriate only after there has been an opportunity to amend 
pleadings where necessary to encompass additional claims. See Ajamian v Schlanger, 14 N.J. 483, 103 A.2d 9, cert. denied, 
348 U.S. 835, 99 L. Ed. 659, 75 S. Ct. 58 (1954). Yet in this case, plaintiff did not request leave to amend its complaint at any 
time prior to dismissal. This court notes that had plaintiff requested leave to amend the complaint, the state trial court could, in its 
discretion, have granted plaintiff leave to incorporate the RICO claims before it dismissed the action. "
353,1," Pendleton Construction appealed Judge Honts' decision to the Virginia Supreme Court. Because no petition for appeal was 
ever filed, the Court dismissed the appeal on December 29, 1983. Two other state-court suits filed by Pendleton Construction 
were voluntarily nonsuited on February 23, 1984, about six months prior to the filing of this federal suit."
353,2," Throughout this application process, Barger Construction was trying to put the heat on Pendleton Construction to accept its bid 
by raising periodically its price for the rock by.10c a ton."
353,3," Pendleton Construction obtained the majority of the rock it needed for the repair project at the Lone Jack Limestone quarry, 
same distance from the repair sites. Pendleton Construction also secured some already loose rock from several other quarries: 
McCown, Rowe, Watts, and Rieff. "
354,4," In City of Lafayette, the Court also suggested, without deciding, that in order for a municipality to gain Parker immunity, the 
state must have ""actively supervised"" the municipality's implementation of the state's anticompetitive policy.  435 U.S. at 410. 
When District Court Judge Ramsey decided Racetrac, 601 F. Supp. 892 (D. Md. 1985), aff'd, 786 F.2d 202 (4th Cir. 1986), it 
was unclear whether municipalities did in fact have the burden of proving ""active state supervision"". Recently, however, the 
Supreme Court has concluded that ""the active state supervision requirement should not be imposed in cases in which the actor 
is a municipality."" Town of Hallie v. City of Eau Claire, 471 U.S. 34, 105 S. Ct. 1713, 1720, 85 L. Ed. 2d 24 (1985). Therefore, in 
making my state action determination, I need only consider whether Virginia has a ""clearly articulated and affirmatively 
expressed"" anticompetitive state policy. "
355,5," See also, Fisher v. City of Berkeley, California, 475 U.S. 260, 106 S. Ct. 1045, 89 L. Ed. 2d 206 (1986) (although the majority of 
the Court disposed of the case on preemption grounds, Justice Powell, in his concurrence, argued that the City, when it passed 
a rent control ordinance, was immune from antitrust liability based on the state action doctrine of Parker v. Brown). "
358,6," I will assume for the sake of argument that the Barger Defendants did have a monopoly on the crushed stone market, however, 
this is a quantum leap for the Court to make. The evidence strongly points to the conclusion that the Barger Defendants simply 
happened to be in the right place at the right time. Accepting the Plaintiff's evidence, it points to the fact that there was a 
relatively short term market involved, i.e. the repair of Interstate 64. Upon the completion of this project, it is obvious that the 
Barger quarry would lose the advantage that it had in being in close proximity to the project. I doubt seriously that a relevant 
market can be predicated upon a single construction project. The Barger monopoly, if one existed, was a ""natural monopoly"" 
which came about by a coalescing of circumstances rather than by impermissible activities on the part of the Bargers. In this 
regard, see Stearns v. Genrad, Inc., 752 F.2d 942 (4th Cir. 1984). ""The defendant may escape statutory liability if . . . it owes its 
monopoly solely to . . . natural advantages (including accessibility to raw materials or markets . . . ."" ABA Antitrust Section, 
Antitrust Law Developments (2d Ed. 1984), p. 122, quoting from United States v. United Machinery Corp., 110 F. Supp. at 297. Also, to follow the Plaintiff's argument that the Barger Defendants' activities were in furtherance of the maintenance of a 
monopoly and an attempt to monopolize requires a bit of mental gymnastics. If the Barger Defendants had a monopoly, then it is 
obvious a charge of attempt to monopolize would not lie under Section 2 of the Sherman Act. By the very definition of the 
offense, an attempt is something which falls short.  Logically, the Barger Defendants could either have a monopoly, which they 
undertook to maintain, or they did not have a monopoly and were attempting to establish one, but they could not do both. HN9[

359,7," Insofar as Pendleton Construction has alleged, if at all, that the Barger Defendants violated Pendleton Construction's civil rights 
in violation of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, I hold that Noerr-Pennington immunity extends to this ยง 1983 claim, as well as the antitrust 
claim.  Racetrac, 601 F. Supp. at 912, aff'd., 786 F.2d 202 (4th Cir. 1986). "
361,8," My decision in regard to the applicability of absolute legislative immunity to the individual County Defendants is reinforced by 
Racetrac, 601 F. Supp. 892 (D. Md. 1985), aff'd., 786 F.2d 202 (4th Cir. 1986). Although District Judge Ramsey found no need 
to decide the issue of absolute immunity because he found that the individual county defendants were entitled to qualified 
immunity, he considered the defendants' arguments in regard to absolute immunity very persuasive.  Id., 601 F. Supp. at 915-

369,6," There is no substantive similarity between Willis and Freitas in Willis's reliance on a section not within the Cartwright Act, of 
which Cianci disapproved as follows: ""Second, the [Willis] opinion's use of section 16600 as an aid to the construction of the 
Cartwright Act is unconvincing.  The opinion declares: 'It is significant that, in related legislation added to the Business and 
Professions Code at the same time as the Cartwright Act, the word ""profession"" was included among the terms describing the 
scope of the legislation, notwithstanding the fact that the words ""trade"" and ""business"" were also used.  [Citation.] The difference 
in terminology between this section and the Cartwright Act may be viewed as indicating that the act was not intended to apply to 
the professions.' (58 Cal.2d at p. 809.) ""On closer examination, however, the two code sections are not sufficiently related to support the result the opinion reaches.  
'Section 16600 . . . was first enacted in 1872 and was placed at section 1673 of the Civil Code.  On the other hand, section 
16720 . . . was first enacted in 1907 as part of the then uncodified Cartwright Act and was patterned after the federal Sherman 
Act, with identical ""trade or commerce"" language . . . .  [para. ] The California Business and Professions Code came into 
existence in its present general form in 1937.  The relevant portions of the Cartwright Act and Civil Code section 1673 were 
moved into this, then new, codification in 1941.  It is significant that these two code sections were not new enactments ""added"" 
to the Business and Professions Code in 1941.  Rather, they were the result of the Legislature engaging in statutory 
consolidation.  Under these circumstances, a finding of legislative intent to exclude the professions from the Cartwright Act, 
based upon nothing more than language differences between the two code sections, exceeds the limits of plausible inference.'

filed with the liquor authority, and is then in effect.  Such schedule shall be in writing duly verified, and filed in the number of 
copies and form as required by the authority, and shall contain, with respect to each item, the exact brand or trade name, "
406,," capacity of package, nature of contents, age and proof where stated on the label, the number of bottles contained in each case, 
the bottle and case price to retailers, the net bottle and case price paid by the seller, which prices, in each instance, shall be 
individual for each item and not in 'combination' with any other item, the discounts for quantity, if any, and the discounts for time 
of payment, if any.  Such brand of liquor or wine shall not be sold to retailers except at the price and discounts then in effect 
unless prior written permission of the authority is granted for good cause shown and for reasons not inconsistent with the 
purpose of this chapter.  Such schedule shall be filed by each manufacturer selling such brand to retailers and by each

] ""For each item of liquor listed in the schedule of liquor prices to retailers there shall be posted a bottle and a case price.  
The bottle price multiplied by number of containers in the case must exceed the case price by approximately $ 1.92 for any case 
of 48 or fewer containers.  The figure is to be reached by adding $ 1.92 to the case price, dividing by the number of containers in 
the case, and rounding to the nearest cent.  Where more than 48 containers are packed in a case, bottle price shall be 
computed by dividing the case price by the number of containers in the case, rounding to the nearest cent, and adding one cent.  
Variations will not be permitted without approval of the authority."""

] ""No licensee authorized to sell liquor at retail for off-premises consumption shall sell, offer to sell, solicit an order for or 
advertise any item of liquor at a price which is less than cost.  As used in this section, the term: . . . . ""(b) 'cost' shall mean the price of such item of liquor to the retailer plus twelve percentum of such price, which is declared as a 
matter of legislative determination to represent the average minimum overhead necessarily incurred in connection with the sale 
by the retailer of such item of liquor. As used in this paragraph (b) the term ""price"" shall mean the bottle price to retailers, before 
any discounts, contained in the applicable schedule filed with the liquor authority pursuant to section one hundred one-b of this 
chapter by a manufacturer or wholesaler from whom the retailer purchases liquor and which is in effect at the time the retailer 
sells or offers to sell such item of liquor; except, that where no applicable schedule is in effect the bottle price of the item of liquor 
shall be computed as the appropriate fraction of the case price of such item, before any discounts, most recently invoiced to the 
retailer."""
406,4," Bulletin 471 provides, in part: ""Case prices may be posted off for any given month, or months, without an accompanying reduction in bottle prices.  The 
wholesaler is given these choices during the period of a post-off: ""1. May elect not to reduce the bottle price, in which case the legal bottle price will be the base for the 12% retail mark-up. ""2. May reduce the bottle price to conform with the post-off case price, consistent with Rule 16.4(e), in which case the reduced 
bottle price will be the base for the 12% mark-up. ""3. May adopt a bottle price any where between the extremes authorized under '1' and '2' above, in which case the reduced 
bottle price will be the base for the 12% mark-up. ""Wholesalers of liquor will note that pursuant to these changes no control is placed on the number of consecutive months during 
which post-offs may be scheduled."" "
408,5," The Court of Appeals suggested that the liquor-pricing system prevents ""temporary price reductions . . . threatening to drive 
small retailers out of business and consolidating control of the market in the hands of a relatively few mass distributors who 
could then dictate prices to the ultimate injury of consumers. . . ."" J. A. J. Liquor Store, Inc. v. New York State Liquor Authority, 
64 N. Y. 2d 504, 520, 479 N. E. 2d 779, 788 (1985). In Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574 
(1986), we recognized that predatory pricing schemes are ""rarely tried, and even more rarely successful."" Id., at 589. In this 
case, the possibility of success is practically nonexistent, because liquor retailers are limited to a single outlet.  ABC Law ยง 63.5 
(McKinney 1970).  In any event, ยง 101-bb forbids not only predatory pricing, but all price competition among retailers."
408,6," A simple ""minimum markup"" statute requiring retailers to charge 112 percent of their actual wholesale cost may satisfy the 
""active supervision"" requirement, and so be exempt from the antitrust laws under Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341 (1943). See 
Morgan v. Division of Liquor Control, Conn. Dept. of Business Regulation, 664 F.2d 353 (CA2 1981) (upholding a simple markup 
statute).  Section 101-bb, however, is not a simple minimum markup statute because it imposes a markup on the ""posted bottle 
price,"" a price that may greatly exceed what the retailer actually paid for the liquor. As we have explained, supra, at 339-340, 
Bulletin 471 permits wholesalers to reduce the case price -- the price actually paid by most retailers -- without reducing the bottle 
price.  The New York Court of Appeals expressly held that Bulletin 471 ""is consistent with Alcoholic Beverage Control Law ยง 
101-b(3) which does not mandate any price ratio between scheduled case and bottle prices."" J. A. J. Liquor Store, Inc. v. New 
York State Liquor Authority, supra, at 523, 479 N. E. 2d, at 790. We may not ""construe a state statute contrary to the 
construction given it by the highest court of a State."" O'Brien v. Skinner, 414 U.S. 524, 531 (1974). Appellees nevertheless argue 
that invalidation of Bulletin 471 does not require invalidation of ยง 101-bb.  Appellees contend that ยง 101-bb does not prevent the 
SLA from establishing a relationship between case price and bottle price; indeed, Rule 16.4(e) establishes such a relationship.  
Brief for Appellees 24-25, n. 37.  Invalidation of Bulletin 471 alone, however, would not prevent wholesalers from selling large 
quantities at low prices in one month, and then requiring retailers to charge abnormally high markups by raising bottle prices in 
subsequent months.  See supra, at 340.  We cannot accept appellees' suggestion that such unsupervised price fixing should be "
409,," tolerated as a reasonable accounting method or as a hedge against inflation.  See App. to Juris. Statement 101A (advertising a 
guaranteed 31.3 percent markup on liquor purchased in August 1984 and sold in September 1984).  We thus have no occasion 
to consider whether a simple minimum markup statute would be entitled to antitrust immunity under Parker v. Brown. LEdHN[6B][
] [6B]Some States completely control the distribution of liquor within their boundaries.  E. g., Va. Code ยงยง 4-15, 
4-28 (1983).  Such comprehensive regulation is immune under Parker v. Brown because the State substitutes its own power for 
""unfettered business freedom."" See New Motor Vehicle Bd. of Cal. v. Orrin W. Fox Co., 439 U.S. 96, 109 (1978)."
409,7," In a concurring opinion, Judge Jasen argued that the State actively supervises the liquor-pricing system.  J. A. J. Liquor Store, 
Inc. v. New York State Liquor Authority, supra, at 526-529, 479 N. E. 2d, at 792-794. Judge Jasen noted that the SLA can 
respond to market conditions by permitting individual wholesalers to depart from their posted prices, ABC Law ยง 101-b(3)(b), and 
by permitting individual retailers to sell below the statutory definition of ""cost,"" ยง 101-bb(3), ""for good cause shown."" Bulletin 471 
itself was issued by the SLA in response to market conditions.  Moreover, the state legislature frequently considers proposals to 
alter the liquor-pricing system.  Neither the ""monitoring"" by the SLA, nor the periodic reexaminations by the state legislature, 
exerts any significant control over retail liquor prices or markups. Thus, the State's involvement does not satisfy the second 
requirement of Midcal."
409,8," The same considerations lead us to reject appellees' contention that there is no ""contract, combination . . . , or conspiracy, in 
restraint of trade."" 15 U. S. C. ยง 1. HN10[
] Where ""private actors are . . . granted 'a degree of private regulatory power' . . . the regulatory scheme may be attacked under ยง 1"" as a ""hybrid"" restraint.  Fisher v. Berkeley, 475 U.S. 260, 268 (1986) (quoting 
Rice v. Norman Williams Co., 458 U.S. 654, 666, n. 1 (1982) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment)).  See Schwegmann Bros. 
v. Calvert Distillers Corp., 341 U.S. 384 (1951). Our decisions reflect the principle that the federal antitrust laws pre-empt state 
laws authorizing or compelling private parties to engage in anticompetitive behavior.  See also Northern Securities Co. v. United 
States, 193 U.S. 197, 345-346 (1904) (plurality opinion); 1 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law para. 209, pp. 60-62 (1978).  
That principle squarely governs this case."
409,9," Section 2 of the Twenty-first Amendment provides: HN12[
] ""The transportation or importation into any State, Territory, or 
possession of the United States for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors, in violation of the laws thereof, is hereby 
prohibited."" "
410,10," The dissenting opinion concedes that ""neither the House of Representatives nor the state ratifying conventions deliberated 
long on the powers conferred on the States by ยง 2."" Post, at 353.  It nevertheless maintains that the Senate debates ""clearly 
demonstrate an intent to confer on States complete and exclusive control over the commerce of liquor."" Post, at 354.  We find no 
such clear demonstration of congressional intent.  It is true that Senator Blaine, the Senate sponsor of the Amendment, at one 
point stated that the purpose of ยง 2 was ""to restore to the States . . . absolute control in effect over interstate commerce affecting 
intoxicating liquors. . . ."" 76 Cong. Rec. 4143 (1933).  At another point, however, Senator Blaine appeared to advance a 
narrower interpretation: ""So, to assure the so-called dry States against the importation of intoxicating liquor into those States, it is 
proposed to write permanently into the Constitution a prohibition along that line."" Id., at 4141. The dissent also maintains that the behavior of the States following ratification supports the view that States have power to enact 
laws governing the pricing of liquor free of the strictures of federal antitrust policy.  One commentator is quoted as saying that 
the States adopted ""'bold and drastic experiments'"" in price control. Post, at 357, quoting De Ganahl, Trade Practice and Price 
Control in the Alcoholic Beverage Industry, 7 Law & Contemp. Prob. 665, 680 (1940). In the next paragraph, however, this writer 
states that ""[because] the experiments came at a time when neither the fair-trade law nor the constitutional law on liquor was 
settled . . . there is uncertainty as to the validity of much of this legislation."" Ibid.  When the Twenty-first Amendment was 
adopted, it was far from clear that the federal commerce power extended to intrastate retail sales of liquor. See A. L. A. 
Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495, 542-548 (1935) (holding that the commerce power does not extend to 
intrastate sales of poultry, even when the poultry has been shipped across state lines).  The Miller-Tydings Fair Trade Act of 
1937, 50 Stat. 693, moreover, permitted States to authorize agreements prescribing prices for the resale of specified 
commodities, including liquor. Even after the passage of the Miller-Tydings Act, price control laws were not as universally 
popular as the dissent implies.  In 1940, for example, only 18 of the 45 ""wet"" States had price stabilization provisions written into 
their alcoholic beverage statutes, De Ganahl, supra, at 680, while in 17 States the State itself monopolized sales of liquor, 
Shipman, State Administrative Machinery for Liquor Control, 7 Law & Contemp. Prob. 600, 601, n. 5 (1940). "
411,11," There is no indication that the purpose of Bulletin 471 is to protect small retailers. The Bulletin states that its purpose is to 
prevent ""a situation during post-off periods which resulted in what became known as a 'two bottle' price."" App. to Juris. 
Statement 71A.  Although there is no precise explanation of ""two bottle pricing"" in the record, the caption of Bulletin 471 is 
""Unlawful Discrimination and Price Scheduling -- Bottle Price During Post-Down."" Ibid.  This suggests that the SLA was 
concerned with ensuring that wholesalers charge the same price to all retailers, and not with the relationship between the 
retailer's actual cost and the required markup. "
412,12," We have no occasion in this case to consider whether the State's interest in protecting small retailers ever could prevail 
against the federal interest in enforcement of the antitrust laws."
412,13," It is far from certain that the New York Legislature intended to promote temperance, or that the retail price maintenance 
system actually decreases consumption. Section 101-bb, like other sections of the ABC Law, recites that it is enacted ""for the 
purpose of fostering and promoting temperance."" ABC Law ยง 101-bb(1) (McKinney 1970).  This statement is not supported by 
specific findings, or by evidence in the record.  In Midcal, we accepted the California Supreme Court's rejection of a similar 
declaration of legislative purpose.  445 U.S., at 112-114 (discussing Rice v. Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Bd., 21 Cal. 3d 
431, 457-459, 579 P. 2d 476, 493-494 (1978)). The legislative Report accompanying ยง 101-bb does not suggest that the 
amendment was aimed at decreasing consumption. Rather, the Report focuses on the need to protect small retailers. New York 
State Legislature, Senate Excise Committee, Final Report 30, 37 (Mar. 1971).  The Report does express concern over the 
increase in liquor consumption during the years between 1964 and 1971.  Id., at 16.  But the Report recognizes the Moreland 
Commission's finding that higher prices do not reduce consumption, and states that ""because of the multiplicity of factors 
involved and lack of data on specifics, the Committee is unable to determine what portion of such increase is attributable to any 
particular factors."" Id., at 14. "

this opinion acknowledges the substantial assistance of Judge Larson in its preparation."
428,1," If, on remand, Midwest again recovers a judgment against Chloride on its antitrust claim, the judgment on the contract claim will 
have to be credited against it. We agree with the District Court that the contract and antitrust claims are duplicative, both 
designed to compensate Midwest for its going out of business. Midwest cannot recover on both theories."
428,2," John Dean had purchased the company from his father by the time the critical events in this lawsuit had occurred; therefore, 
any references in this opinion to ""Mr. Dean"" are to the son. "
429,3," Because of our decision reversing the Robinson-Patman verdict, plaintiff's counsel is not yet entitled to attorney's fees under 
the Clayton Act, and we need not consider its appeal of the District Court's fee award. In addition, since Chloride's tort recovery 
is to be reversed outright, it is not necessary to consider the propriety of offsetting it against any antitrust damages the bankrupt 
Midwest may recover in the future. "
430,4," The Supreme Court has interpreted price discrimination under the Robinson-Patman Act to mean any price difference 
unrelated to quality.  FTC v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 363 U.S. 536, 549, 4 L. Ed. 2d 1385, 80 S. Ct. 1267 (1960). No question is 
raised on appeal about the existence of such discrimination."
430,5," A study by the Attorney General's Committee emphasized the fact that the words of the statute expressly forbid injury only to 
competition and not competitors; therefore, a focus on individual competitors and not ""the health of the competitive process 
literally go[es] beyond the terms in the law."" Report of the Attorney General's National Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws 
(1955), quoted in E. Kintner, A Robinson-Patman Primer 118 (2d ed. 1979). "
431,6," Rep. Patman, describing the bill's purpose in debate, said Congress was ""attempting to stop"": a policy in business that a few rich, powerful organizations by reason of their size and their ability to coerce and intimidate 
manufacturers have forced those manufacturers to give them their goods at a lower price than they give to the independent 
merchants under the same and similar circumstance and for the same quantities of goods."

433,7," Midwest's expert testified, ""The route is a market. If that is right then Midwest was a major competitor."" Tr. at X:48. "
434,8," Instruction No. 29, Tr. at XV:46, defined predatory intent as the ""purpose . . . to injure Midwest or any other of Chloride's 
competitors."" This only circles back to the injury-to-a-single-competitor standard and is inadequate in light of our decisions, see, 
e.g., Conoco, Inc. v. Inman Oil Co., 774 F.2d 895, 904-05 n.6 (8th Cir. 1985), as well as Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. 
Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986), see infra at slip op. pp. 20-21, particularly since it 
would also permit a finding of predatory intent (and by inference, injury to competition) without any showing of the price 
discriminator's ability to lessen competition in the market as a whole. On remand, the predatory-intent instruction should be 
changed to conform with the standards set forth in this opinion. "
435,9," During cross-examination counsel for Midwest asked defendant's expert witness, ""Do you agree predatory intent can exist but 
not be successful?"" Tr. at XIII:125. The thrust of Matsushita is that while predatory intentions need not be accomplished, there 
must be some reasonable expectation on the part of the alleged predator that it will succeed in dominating, if not controlling, the 
market. Another comment from this trial is instructive here. A comparison was made between predatory competition and the 
shoving, ""if intentional,"" of Mary Decker by Zola Budd in the 1984 Olympics. Tr. at X:20. Under Matsushita, Ms. Budd would "
436,," have acted predatorily only if she had some plausible expectation that she could indeed win a medal (although she need not 
actually have won one, as she did not)."
436,10," Plaintiffs in Matsushita brought suit under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, as well as the Robinson-Patman Act. The 
District Court granted summary judgment in defendant's favor on the Section 1 allegation and dismissed the other claims as 
based on the same insufficient evidence. The Court of Appeals reversed. While Matsushita is primarily a Section 1 case, the 
general principles set out are not limited to cases brought under that statute.  106 S. Ct. at 1355 nn. 8 & 9. The Supreme Court 
described predatory pricing as a ""term . . . used chiefly in cases in which a single firm, having a dominant share of its market, 
cuts its price in order to force competitors out of the market, or perhaps to deter potential entrants from coming in."" Id. n.8 
(citations omitted)."
436,11," In International Telephone & Telegraph, the FTC suggested that the ideal rule would require both predatory intent (that is, 
sales below AVC for a significant period of time) and predatory conduct (that is, sales at prices which over a significant time 
period will force out equally efficient competitors). 3Trade Reg. Rep. (CCH) at 23,081. This seems only to restate the rational-
economic-conduct rule by redefining ""intent"" to mean conduct, and ""conduct"" to mean possibility. "
437,12," In Matsushita, the Supreme Court declined to determine what ""appropriate measure of cost,"" 106 S. Ct. at 1355 n.8, 
constitutes predatory pricing. The Court said it would not ""consider whether recovery should ever be available . . . when the 
pricing in question is above some measure of incremental cost,"" but added that ""as a practical matter, it may be that only direct 
evidence of below-cost pricing is sufficient to overcome the strong inference that rational businesses would not enter into 
conspiracies such as this one."" 106 S. Ct. at 1355 n.9 (emphasis in original.) "
438,13," Chloride also urges us to order judgment n.o.v. in its favor on the ground that the evidence of causation was legally 
insufficient. We disagree. There was enough evidence to establish the fact of injury. After that, the extent of damages may be 
ascertained on the basis of reasonable inferences. We observe, in addition, that on retrial Chloride may again assert the meeting-competition defense. We find no error in the 
District Court's instructions describing this defense. "
439,14," Chloride also argues that the District Court's refusal to instruct the jury on defendant's justification as a defense to the contract 
claim requires us to reverse the award. However, since we have rejected as actionable those aspects of Midwest's conduct to 
which Chloride refers -- see infra at slip op. pp. 31-32, 34-35 -- the refusal to instruct, if error, was harmless. "
440,15," The cases cited by the District Court, ante at slip op. p. 30, are useful here. In none of those cases did plaintiff contract with 
defendant concerning forbidden avenues of distribution, a fact of crucial significance to the deciding courts. See, e.g., El Greco 
Leather Products Co. v. Shoe World Inc., 599 F. Supp. 1380, 1391-92 (E.D.N.Y. 1984). Compare Bill Blass, Ltd. v. SAZ Corp.,

be trademark infringement. "
441,16," We have held that Midwest did not violate the Lanham Act by putting Chloride's name on its labels. Ante, Pt. V. Even if we had 
reinstated that verdict in Chloride's favor, however, there was no showing that the labels (rather than a better financial deal) 
induced the defection to Midwest."
441,17," We have considered and find unpersuasive Chloride's suggestion that conduct which might not represent tortious interference 
becomes actionable when a large proportion of a plaintiff's work force is hired away by a defendant. "
443,1," The majority also holds that prices above average total cost are legal per se. Ante at slip op. p. 22. Other courts have 
disagreed. See Transamerica Computer Co. v. IBM Corp., 698 F.2d 1377 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 955, 78 L. Ed. 2d 
329, 104 S. Ct. 370 (1983). Because defendant's counsel conceded at oral argument that Chloride's pricing often was below 
average total cost, I find no need to reach this question and accordingly express no opinion on the majority's above average total 
cost ruling. See Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 55 U.S.L.W. 4027, 4031, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427, 107 S. Ct. 
484 (1986) (reserving question of whether recovery should be available ""when the pricing in question is above some measure of 
incremental cost"")."
443,2," The district court's Instruction 29 stated in relevant part: In considering whether the effect of price discrimination 'may have been substantially to lessen competition . . .,' you should 
consider whether the intent of Chloride in making these price discriminations was predatory. If Chloride's intent was predatory, 
that is evidence from which you may properly conclude that the discriminatory prices may have had the required adverse effect 
on competition. Predatory intent means that its purpose was to injure Midwest or any other of Chloride's competitors. In determining whether 
Chloride acted with predatory intent, you should consider the following factors: (1) whether the person discriminating in price 
intended to injure one of its competitors; (2) the relative size of the competitors; (3) whether the price discrimination caused 
significant economic loss to a competitor; (4) whether discriminatory sales occurred over a long period of time; (5) whether the 
barriers to entry into the market are high or low, that is, whether new competition could enter the market; (6) whether Chloride's 
prices, sales or share of the market actually increased appreciably following any price discrimination it may have engaged in; 
and (7) whether Chloride's pricing was below cost or predatory. Predatory pricing occurs when a firm sells at prices below cost 
for the purpose of driving competitors out of business with the hope of recouping the losses through subsequent higher prices. 
Predatory pricing may be deemed to have occurred where the business' prices were, for a significant period of time, below what 
is called its marginal or average variable cost, or between average variable cost and average total cost. Variable costs are those 
costs which fluctuate with a firm's output. Total costs are variable costs plus fixed costs. "

Chlor/Alkali are participants in this conduct. Plaintiffs also proffer an economist's critique of the agencies' economic analysis

For purposes of this opinion, we will use ""4-Pets."""
552,3," Hartz contends that its actions were justified because GI was not treating it on an equal footing with other distributors in that GI 
was paying all other distributors but Hartz within thirty days. GI, however, notes in its brief that Hartz could not have been 
motivated by this information in 1977 and 1978 because it did not know the details of GI's payment record with other suppliers 
until three years after the fact, during discovery for this litigation. "
553,4," Hartz did counter this evidence with testimony that an accountant had determined that a portion of the ""lost"" orders were in fact 
cancelled by GI employees. However, other testimony, including that of Target executives, supported GI's contention that during 
this time, GI was unable to obtain adequate supplies of many Hartz products."
553,5," The district court correctly granted GI leave to file its amended complaint, holding that GI's covenant not to sue Hartz, which 
grew out of an earlier antitrust action against GI and Hartz, does not preclude GI's present suit. The covenant not to sue was 
executed in April, 1976, after Hartz and GI were sued by another Hartz distributor. Although an earlier version of this suit was 
dismissed based on the covenant not to sue, that dismissal related only to GI's promise not to sue for acts occurring before June 
15, 1977. The present suit arises out of GI's amendment of its complaint and focuses on events occurring after June, 1977."
553,6," The Honorable Paul A. Magnuson, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota, presiding. "
556,7," ""An attempt charge properly lies against conduct (1) which is totally unrelated to competition on the merits -- that is, lacking any 
plausible claim to redeeming virtue; (2) which clearly implies the presence or prospect of some degree of durable market power -
- as, for example, conduct not likely to be rationally undertaken by a firm without such power or the hope of attaining it through 
the challenged conduct; and (3) which has potentially significant exclusionary effects in the generality of cases -- in that there is 
a clear and direct causal connection between the conduct and the power."" P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law para. 820 at 
313 (1978). "
558,8," We also find it relevant, although not conclusive, that the FTC in its consent decree with Hartz, which was admitted at trial for 
limited purposes, used the phrase ""pet supplies"" to describe the market in which Hartz competed. "
560,9," Because we affirm the jury's verdict on GI's ยง 2 claim on the basis of attempted monopolization, we need not also review the 
evidence supporting the jury's finding of actual monopolization here. See, e.g., Woods Exploration & Producing Co. v. 
Aluminum Co. of America, 438 F.2d 1286, 1304 (5th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1047, 92 S. Ct. 701, 30 L. Ed. 2d 736

560,10," The limiting instruction given to the jury more than once during the course of trial read: Now, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you are going to hear evidence of a consent decree entered into by Hartz Mountain 
and the FTC. The consent decree is not evidence of any wrongdoing on the part of Hartz. You may not infer from the 
consent decree that Hartz engaged in any wrongful conduct or that it altered its conduct as a result of the consent decree. 
Although, you may infer that Hartz complied with the decree. You may only use it for determining the state of competition 
following the effective date of the consent decree. "
570,1," A final claim, for declaratory relief to interpret PECA's bylaws, also was decided adversely to the contractors. That decision is 
not challenged on appeal."
570,2," Summary judgment must be granted ""forthwith,"" unless the court determines that further time for discovery should be allowed. 
See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f). "
571,3," In Anderson, the Court held that the judge must also take into account the substantive evidentiary burden that the nonmoving 
party must meet at trial -- e.g., ""a preponderance of the evidence"" in most civil cases or ""clear and convincing evidence"" for 
actual malice in libel cases. See Anderson, 106 S. Ct. at 2513 (""The judge must view the evidence presented through the prism 
of the substantive evidentiary burden.""). Although the Court adhered to the long-standing rules that the judge should neither 
engage in credibility determinations nor weigh the evidence presented by opposing parties and that all evidence and justifiable 
inferences must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, see id., other passages, if read out of context, 
might suggest that weighing of the evidence is an appropriate function of the judge at summary judgment. See id. at 2512 (""The 
inquiry . . . is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-
sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.""); id. (""The judge's inquiry, therefore, unavoidably asks whether reasonable 
jurors could find by a preponderance of the evidence that the plaintiff is entitled to a verdict. . . .""). Given its continued adherence 
to the standard rules governing summary judgment noted above, we understand these statements to mean that HN7[
] a court 
must determine whether the evidence presented by the nonmoving party, coupled with undisputed background and contextual 
facts, see Matsushita, 106 S. Ct. at 1356, are such that a jury could reasonably find in its favor in view of the appropriate 
substantive evidentiary burden. Hence, the inquiry focuses on whether the nonmoving party has come forward with sufficiently 
""specific"" facts from which to draw reasonable inferences about other material facts that are necessary elements of the 
nonmoving party's claim. Were we to construe the Court's statements as requiring a court to ask whether a jury could find in 
favor of the nonmoving party viewing all of the evidence -- both that presented by the nonmoving party and that presented by the 
moving party -- such a construction would contradict the clear instruction that a court may not weigh the evidence or assess its 
credibility. "
572,4," Such a limitation on permissible inferences from ambiguous evidence alone, the Monsanto court explained, was in part 
necessary to avoid the erosion of the doctrine enunciated in United States v. Colgate & Co., 250 U.S. 300, 307, 63 L. Ed. 992, 
39 S. Ct. 465 (1919), which held that a manufacturer's independent refusal to deal with distributors did not violate antitrust laws. 
See Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 763. To permit an inference of conspiracy from ""highly ambiguous evidence"" in that case would 
create an ""irrational dislocation in the market"" and unfairly expose legitimate business conduct to the possibility of treble damage 
liability. See id. at 763-64. "
573,5," We need not address the allegation in the complaint that the national IBEW and Local 1186, ""by virtue of the [Master] 
Agreement, has [sic] combined with a favored group of employers (PECA members) to impose upon another group of employers 
(non-PECA members)"" the Fund contribution provision. The national IBEW and Local 1186, originally named as defendants in 
this action, have since been dismissed. Individual PECA members are not defendants in this action. Hence, we note that the 
complaint does not allege a horizontal conspiracy among PECA members, but rather a vertical conspiracy between PECA, Local 
1186, the national IBEW, and the as yet unidentified co-conspirators."
573,6," We note that, because the facts and issues in the case before us are different from those in NECA, we express the view as to 
whether we would follow the Fourth Circuit's opinion. "
574,7," Counsel for the contractors stated at oral argument that, although he believed that evidence of a conspiracy might have been 
uncovered if more extensive discovery had taken place, the decision below is not challenged on the ground that the district court 
had afforded inadequate time for discovery. "
586,*," Honorable Joseph J. Farnan, Jr., United States District Judge for the District of Delaware, sitting by designation. "
588,1," We are mindful of the fact that the 10 day notice provision of Rule 56(c) is intended to provide an opportunity to research and 
present the law as well as an opportunity to marshal the facts. Accordingly, there are undoubtedly cases where it would be unfair 
to schedule a summary judgment motion on a few days notice even where the facts are not in dispute. Here, however, the 
haulers fully briefed the law applicable to their antitrust claim in support of their motion for a preliminary injunction. "
589,2," A number of courts have held that the use of oral testimony on a summary judgment motion is specifically authorized by Fed. 
R. Civ. P. 43(e). See, e.g., Stewart v. RCA Corp., 790 F.2d 624, 628-29 (7th Cir. 1986); Walters v. City of Ocean Springs, 626 
F.2d 1317, 1322 (5th Cir. 1980). This court has previously utilized oral testimony at a preliminary injunction hearing to establish a 
genuine issue of material fact requiring reversal of summary judgment. Bolt Assocs. v. Alpine Geophysical Assocs., 365 F.2d 
742, 750 (3d Cir. 1966); see also Winkleman v. New York Stock Exchange, 445 F.2d 786, 788 (3d Cir. 1971) (recognizing 
district court's use of oral testimony from a previous preliminary injunction hearing in ruling on summary judgment motion). "
590,3," The Solid Waste Management Act defines ""municipality"" to include ""[a] city, borough, incorporated town, township or county or 
any authority created by any of the foregoing."" Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 35, ยง 6018.103 (Purdon Supp. 1986)."
590,4," The parties agree that Town of Hallie v. City of Eau Claire, 471 U.S. 34, 85 L. Ed. 2d 24, 105 S. Ct. 1713 (1985), is the 
controlling case. The haulers allege antitrust violations by both Chester County and the Chester Authority. The parties have not 
drawn a distinction between the standard applicable to the county, a political subdivision, and that applicable to the authority, a "
591,," state agency, Commonwealth v. Erie Metropolitan Transit Authority, 444 Pa. 345, 281 A.2d 882, 884 (1971), and we will apply 
the same standard to both actors in this case."
591,5," Because we find defendants immune under the state action exemption, we do not consider the possible applicability of the 
Local Government Antitrust Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-544, 98 Stat. 2750 (codified at 15 U.S.C.A. ยงยง 34-36 (West Supp. 
1986)). See Skepton v. County of Bucks, 613 F. Supp. 1013 (E.D. Pa. 1985). "
592,6," Plaintiffs further rely on the federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 6901 et seq., its emphasis on regional planning, and 
the congressional finding that suitable landfill sites are becoming scarce. Given the rationale underlying the decision in Parker v. 
Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 87 L. Ed. 315, 63 S. Ct. 307 (1943), we fail to perceive the relevancy of federal legislative intent in 
adopting the Solid Waste Disposal Act to the issue of whether defendants' conduct is immune from antitrust liability as state 
action. "
593,7," The Supreme Court further noted that, ""in cases in which the actor is a state agency, it is likely that active state supervision 
would also not be required."" 471 U.S. at 46 n.10."
593,8," In the cited text, Professor Areeda explains the hazards of permitting a challenge similar to that asserted by the haulers: "
594,," To be sure, HN22[
] state law ""authorizes"" only agency decisions that are substantively and procedurally correct. Errors of 
fact, law, or judgment by the agency are not ""authorized."" Erroneous acts or decisions are subject to reversal by superior 
tribunals because unauthorized. If the antitrust court demands unqualified ""authority"" in this sense, it inevitably becomes 
the standard reviewer not only of federal agency activity but also of state and local activity whenever it is alleged that the 
governmental body, though possessing the power to engage in the challenged conduct, has actually exercised its power in 
a manner not authorized by state law. We should not lightly assume that Lafayette's authorization requirement dictates 
transformation of state administrative review into a federal antitrust job. Yet that would be the consequence of making 
antitrust liability depend on an undiscriminating and mechanical demand for ""authority"" in the full administrative law sense. This concern is not fanciful. If an allegation of agency error or other unauthorized action is enough to deny antitrust 
immunity for public agencies, virtually every zoning decision, franchise grant, utility tariff ruling, or other routine 
governmental act will be subject to antitrust scrutiny. . . . P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law para. 212.3(b) (Supp. 1982). "
595,9," As stated by this court in Delaware River Basin Comm'n v. Bucks County Water & Sewer Auth., 641 F.2d 1087 (3d Cir. 1981): Neither party to this appeal suggests that, because the challenged classification was devised by an administrative rather 
than legislative body, principles other than those of conventional ""bottom tier"" equal protection scrutiny should apply. 
Moreover, HN24[
] in applying rationality analysis, courts generally do not subject administrative action to more exacting 
scrutiny than that accorded legislative decisions.  Id. at 1093 n.11; see Shelton v. City of College Station, 780 F.2d 475 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 477 U.S. 905, 106 S. Ct. 3276, 91 
L. Ed. 2d 566 (1986). Therefore, we shall apply the conventional rational basis test in this case."
595,10," This court recently examined whether, in seeking a legislative purpose supporting a provision under equal protection challenge 
where the legislative history does not disclose any purpose, the court is limited to considering only actual, articulated purposes.  
Delaware River Basin Comm'n, 641 F.2d at 1094-97. We concluded: ""So long as we are careful not to attribute to the legislature 
purposes which it cannot reasonably be understood to have entertained, we find that in examining the challenged provisions we 
may consider purposes advanced by counsel for the Commission or suggested initially by ourselves."" Id. at 1097 (footnote 
omitted). "
596,11," The district court did not consider whether concern over potential environmental contamination would constitute a legitimate 
purpose and, though we believe it would, we need not reach that issue here."
596,12," The haulers have argued to this court that they have raised facts that would permit a jury to infer that defendants' alleged 
concern to preserve Lanchester Landfill for county waste was a mere pretext to extort higher prices for accepting out-of-county 
waste. Arguably, that purpose would be rationally related to the legitimate goal of financing disposal of the county's waste. 
However, this argument was not made to the district court and, in any event, as indicated above, the decisionmakers' subjective 
motivation is irrelevant to rational basis analysis. "
597,13," The discovery of this ""newly discovered"" evidence is said to have been occasioned by the May 8, 1986 newspaper article 
referred to above. "
606,1," The present case also presents a claim of an illegal tying arrangement, but that is a separate issue from the analysis of the 
exclusive arrangement between St. John's Hospital and APL, and the Court will discuss that issue in a later section. "
616,2," The Clayton Act applies only to goods, whereas the Illinois Antitrust Act includes the word ""services."" Therefore, the Illinois Act 
applies to the provision of services as well as the sale of goods. "
617,3," Dr. Collins did receive bonuses for the years during which he was employed by APL prior to 1980, so the Court understands 
that he is challenging the Defendants' actions under only the 1977 Employment Agreement. "
621,1," In its complaint, the plaintiff avers that abortions account for approximately 35% of the Center's clients. Amended Complaint at 
P 5."
621,2," The third count, styled ""Pendent State Law Claims"", charges the defendants with commission of six distinct common law torts: 
(1) intentional interference with contractual relations; (2) assault; (3) battery; (4) trespass; (5) intentional infliction of emotional 
distress; and (6) libel and slander. Amended Complaint at P 88. As of this date, the plaintiff has abandoned its claims of assault, 
battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Plaintiff's Consolidated Memorandum in Support of Plaintiff's Motions in 
Limine and in Opposition to Defendants' Motions in Limine (Document # 110) at 1 n.1. The plaintiff has also announced that it 
""will not directly pursue claims for invasion of privacy."" Id_. As there is no pending claim in the amended complaint for invasion 
of privacy, what the plaintiff intends to abandon by this statement is unclear to the court. "
622,3," The defendants' motions for summary judgment on the RICO, antitrust, and contractual interference claims are documents 
#116, 115 and 114 respectively. The plaintiff's consolidated response is document #120. "
623,4," The Restatement's formulation of the common law tort of intentional interference with contractual relations has been adopted 
by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. See Adler, Barish, Daniels, Levin and Creskoff v. Epstein, 482 Pa. 416, 393 A.2d 1175, 
1181 (1978), appeal dismissed and cert. denied, 442 U.S. 907 (1979)."
623,5," Legal expenses and the repair or replacement of damaged property appear to fall outside the group of injuries intended to be 
recoverable under the Restatement. However, the court will allow the plaintiff an opportunity at trial to demonstrate the nexus 
between these injuries and the defendants' interference with the Center's contracts. "
624,6," The defendants' objection relates to defendants' interrogatories #7, 9, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 30, 31, 58, and 65."
624,7," In his memorandum, Magistrate Naythons intimated the possibility for such discovery. ""Defendants here seek not only to 
discover the political subdivision and state of domicile of women who have chosen abortions, defendants have requested names

condemned by the most enlightened opinion of the time, or which at all events pass the limit of interference as many 
consciences would draw it. Manifestly, therefore, nothing but confusion of thought can result from assuming that the rights of 
man in a moral sense are equally rights in the sense of the Constitution and the law . . . . No one will deny that wrong statutes 
can be and are enforced, and we should not all agree as to which were the wrong ones. Id. at 460."
626,10," Mohandas Gandhi, perhaps the most lauded proponent of civil disobedience in history, denounced the resort to violence as a 
means of protest: [I] discovered in the earliest stages that pursuit of truth did not admit of violence being inflicted on one's opponent, but that he 
must be weaned from error by patience and sympathy. For what appears to be truth to the one may appear to be error to the 
other. Gandhi, A Plea for the Severest Penalty upon Conviction for Sedition, in The Law As Literature, 459-60 (E. London ed. 1960) 
(quoted in McEwen, The Defense or Justification and Its Use by the Protestor: A Focus on Pennsylvania, 91 Dick. L. Rev. 3, 8 
(1986)). In his recent article on the justification defense, Judge Stephen McEwen notes that six reported state court decisions have 
addressed the proffered defense in the context of pro-life protests. In each case, the proported defense was rejected as 
improper. McEwen, supra at 32-34. Although each of these cases involved criminal prosecutions, their reasoning is enlightening 
in the civil context as well. See Cleveland v. Municipality of Anchorage, 631 P.2d 1073, 1077-82. (Alaska 1981); Gaetano v. 
United States, 406 A.2d 1291, 1292-95 (D.C. 1979); People v. Stiso, 93 Ill. App. 3d 101, 416 N.E.2d 1209, 1210-12 (1981);

626,11," The defendants also assert that evidence of motive is relevant to refute the existence of anticompetitive intent. See Franklin 
Music Co. v. American Broadcasting Cos., Inc., 616 F.2d 528, 541-42 (3d Cir. 1979). This question was addressed, and 
resolved, in the October 25, 1985 memorandum. Northeast Women's Center, Inc. v. McMonagle, No. 85 4845, slip op. at 11-12 "
627,," (E.D. Pa. Oct. 25, 1985). Lastly, the defendants offer evidence of their views as a truth defense to the plaintiff's defamation 
claims. To the extent such an asserted defense is inconsistent with the Supreme Court's views on abortion, it is disallowed."
627,12," The plaintiff has offered to stipulate that the defendants oppose abortion and that this opposition constituted the reason for 
their actions. Plaintiff's Consolidated Memorandum in Support of Plaintiff's Motions in Limine and in Opposition to Defendants' 
Motion in Limine (Document #110) at 3, n.2. Conveying the facts in this proposed stipulation to the jury is permissible."
627,13," In the motion, the plaintiff lists such terms as ""murder"", ""killing"", or ""baby-killing"" as references to abortion. This list, of course, 
is merely illustrative of the type of language the plaintiff fears. The court reads the plaintiff's motion as encompassing all such 
related references."
627,14," In defending against this motion, the plaintiff argues that evidence relating to the activities of non-defendants may be 
admissible to the extent the named defendants attempted to exploit those actions to extort the plaintiff. The plaintiff offers the 
analogy of a rash of neighborhood fires intentionally set by X. A, an uninvolved third party completely unaware that X was the "
628,," arsonist, threatens B that B's home will be the next arson casualty unless B pays A money to avoid the fire. Evidence of X's 
actions might be relevant in the extortion trial of A because A attempted to exploit X's conduct in order to induce B to pay A 
money. These hypothetical circumstances are different from those at hand. The injunction hearing established that the plaintiff should 
have realized that a number of different, unrelated, and not centrally organized individuals joined the defendants in protesting the 
Center. Thus, the plaintiff could not have reasonably feared any of the defendants' attempts at extortion premised on the 
conduct of non-defendants. "

on-call list. "
657,3," I need not decide whether the Court would have reached a different conclusion if, as here, it was alleged that the price-fixing

658,4," Because defendants are all specialists, plaintiff's theory that they desire to reduce specialists' fees to the benefit of general 
practitioners makes little ""economic sense."" Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct.

663,1," The Containerization Agreement provides, in relevant part: [1] The Agreements of ""Management"" shall set forth the work jurisdiction of employees covered by the said Agreements in the 
following terms: Management and Carriers recognize the existing work jurisdiction of ILA employees covered by their agreements with the ILA 
over all container work which historically has been performed by longshoremen and all other ILA crafts at container waterfront 
facilities. Carriers, direct employers and their agents covered by such agreements agree to employ employees covered by their 
work agreements to perform such work which includes but is not limited to: (a) the loading and discharging of containers on and off ships. (b) the receipt of cargo. (c) the delivery of cargo. (d) the loading and discharging of cargo into and out of containers. (e) the maintenance and repair of containers. (f) the inspection of containers at waterfront facilities (TIR men). [2] Management, the Carriers, the direct employers and their agents shall not contract out any work covered by this agreement. 
Any violations of this provision shall be considered a breach of this agreement. (Petitioner's Exhibit A, Item 3(a) at 1.) "
664,2," A union signatory agreement is distinguished from a straightforward no-subcontracting clause, which prohibits a single 
employer from transferring its own work to nonunion employers, and a ""union standards"" clause, which prohibits an employer 
from diverting its own work to a subcontractor employing nonunion labor at substantially lower cost, both of which are generally 
lawful."
664,3," It is well settled that a union may enter into an agreement with its members' employers for the purpose of preserving work 
traditionally performed by union members, if that agreement is not prompted by some other secondary, unlawful, motive. Such 
agreements are classic ""work preservation"" agreements and have been consistently upheld. See e.g., National Woodwork 
Manufacturers Association, 386 U.S. 612 (1967)."
664,4," In NLRB v. International Longshoremen's Ass'n, AFL-CIO, 473 U.S. 61 (1985) (ILA-II), the Supreme Court then upheld the 
Rules on containers, which provide that the ILA could lawfully agree with the carriers to have ILA members only stuff and strip 
containers at the pier itself, rather than within a fifty-mile radius of the pier. "
665,5," Defendant submits that Pennsauken, New Jersey -- a port in which the Agreement has been invoked -- is not a part of the Port 
of Philadelphia. No testimony has been presented to the Court regarding this assertion. "
670,1," HN2[
] Rule 12(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure states that: ""If, on a motion to dismiss for failure of the pleading to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, matters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court, the 
motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56 . . . ."" Although affidavits were filed 
in this case, the court has excluded them from consideration for the purposes of this motion because if, as here, plaintiffs cannot 
survive a motion to dismiss, any factual disputes created by the affidavits are not material. "
671,2," See M.G.L. c. 268A, ยงยง 19, 20, 21, which relate to conflicts of interest experienced by municipal officials, among others. "
672,3," A recent Massachusetts Court of Appeals decision suggests that there might be a number of different avenues of relief for 
conflict of interest violations by state officials. In Piccuirro v. Gaitenby, 20 Mass.App.Ct. 286, 480 N.E.2d 30 (1985), a real estate 
dealer who was also a Town Councilman serving on the Board of Health misused his official positions to avoid Board of Health 
requirements relating to a lot he sold to the plaintiffs. The court held: ""We think the findings that the defendant used his official 
position to obtain favorable Board of Health action to the detriment of the plaintiffs in matters in which he had a financial interest 
describe the kind of dealing which is 'unfair and deceptive' under c. 93A, ยง 2."" Piccuirro, 20 Mass.App.Ct. at 289. The Court 
awarded money damages under c. 93A."
672,4," The Supreme Court has decided that the fact that state law does not provide remedies as expansive as ยง 1983 does not mean 
that the state remedies are inadequate. In Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527, 544, 68 L. Ed. 2d 420, 101 S. Ct. 1908 (1980), the 
Court said: Although the state remedies may not provide the respondent with all the relief which may have been available if he could 
have proceeded under ยง 1983, that does not mean that the state remedies are not adequate to satisfy the requirements of 
due process. The remedies provided could have fully compensated the respondent for the property loss he suffered, and 
we hold that they are sufficient to satisfy the requirements of due process. See also Chongris, supra, at 44 (court found state remedy adequate that allowed plaintiffs to regain permit without recovering 
money damages because no bad faith.)"
672,5," Because the requirements articulated in Parratt and Hudson and discussed supra have not been met, it is not necessary to 
address the defendants' argument that complaints based on land use disputes cannot state a cause of action under ยง 1983. "
673,6," Where the anticompetitive conduct is by private parties, the anticompetitive conduct must also be actively supervised by the 
state in order for the state action exemption to apply. See California Retail Liquor Dealers Ass'n v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 
U.S. 97, 63 L. Ed. 2d 233, 100 S. Ct. 937 (1980); Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference Inc. v. United States, 471 U.S. 48, 
105 S. Ct. 1721, 85 L. Ed. 2d 36 (1985). In Town of Hallie the Supreme Court stated that the ""active state supervision 
requirement should not be imposed in cases in which the actor is a municipality."" Town of Hallie, 105 S. Ct. at 1720. This case 
involves allegations of anticompetitive conduct by a municipality and its officers. "
674,7," In Corey, the First Circuit found: ""Although specific, detailed legislative authorization is not necessarily required, we think that, 
absent explicit language, the political subdivision claiming exemption must illustrate the requisite state legislative intent by 
demonstrating by convincing reasoning that the challenged restraint is necessary to the successful operation of the legislative 
scheme that the state as sovereign has established."" In Southern Motor Carriers, however, the Supreme Court found that ""state 
action immunity is not dependent on a finding that an exemption from the federal antitrust laws is 'necessary.'"" Southern Motor 
Carriers, 105 S. Ct. at 1727 n. 21. The Supreme Court made this point in rejecting the contention in the dissent that: ""We have 
only authorized exemptions from the Sherman Act for businesses regulated by federal law when that exemption was necessary 
in order to make the regulatory act work . . . . No lesser showing of repugnancy should be sufficient to justify an implied 
exemption based on a state regulatory program."" Id. at 1736."
674,8," Although neither party has addressed the issue, it is appropriate to consider briefly the applicability of the Noerr-Pennington 
doctrine. That doctrine creates antitrust immunity for private parties lobbying to influence official action.  Eastern Railroads 
Presidents Conference v. Noerr, 365 U.S. 127, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464, 81 S. Ct. 523 (1961); United Mine Workers of America v. 
Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626, 85 S. Ct. 1585 (1964). The principle underlying the immunity doctrine is the ""right of 
the people to inform their representatives in government of their desires with respect to the passage or enforcement of laws."" 
Noerr, 365 U.S. at 139. As long as the people are trying to influence the passage or enforcement of laws, their petition will be 
protected regardless of their motivations. In Noerr the court found, ""it is neither unusual or illegal for people to seek action on 
laws in hope that they may bring about an advantage to themselves and a disadvantage to their competitors."" Id. In the instant case, however, there are no private defendants named in the complaint. Nor is there a suggestion that Town 
Councillor Weagle initiated and organized the alleged conspiracy of Town officials in response to the petitions of private parties. 
As a result, the Noerr-Pennington doctrine is inapplicable, and the court need not draw lines based on the degree of government "
675,," participation in a private conspiracy. Compare Metro Cable Co. v. CATV of Rockford, 516 F.2d 220, 230 (7th Cir. 1975), with 
Duke and Company v. Foerster, 521 F.2d 1277 (3rd Cir. 1975), and Affiliated Capital Corp. v. City of Houston, 519 F. Supp. 991, 
1016-23 (S.D.Tex. 1981), aff'd in part, 735 F.2d 1555, 1557 (5th Cir. 1984)."
675,9," 15 U.S.C. ยง 35 states that ""no damages, interest on damages, costs, or attorneys fees may be recovered under section 4, 4A, 
or 4C of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. ยง 15, 15(a) or 15(c)), from any local government, or official or employee thereof acting in an 
official capacity."" 15 U.S.C. ยง 15 provides that ""any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything 
forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefore in any district court of the United States . . . and shall recover threefold the 
damages by him sustained . . . ."" The ""antitrust"" laws referred to in 15 U.S.C. ยง 15 are defined in 15 U.S.C. ยง 12 to include the 
Sherman Act. The private remedy provided by 15 U.S.C. ยง 15 of the Clayton Act repealed equivalent sections of the Sherman 
Act. Areeda & Turner, Antitrust Law 32 n. 1 (1978). "
676,10," The court does not address the effect of 15 U.S.C. ยง 35 on recovery under state antitrust law. The state law explicitly does 
not apply to activities which are ""exempt from any of the federal antitrust laws."" M.G.L. c. 93, ยง 7. Although the state action 
exemption does not apply, no damages can be recovered under federal law. Apparently, the Massachusetts courts have not 
discussed whether protection from damages under federal law falls within the meaning of ""exempt from any of the federal 
antitrust laws."" Resolution of this issue is left for later proceedings on these claims. "
682,1," NRT also operated as a ""truckload"" or ""line haul"" carrier, carrying full truckloads from the shipper's place of business to the final 
destination. This case only concerns NRT's less-than-truckload operations. This opinion refers to IDC and NRT in the present tense even though the record and the appellate briefs indicate that both firms 
have begun proceedings under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. On January 9, 1987, the United States Bankruptcy Court for 
the District of New Jersey, Gindin, J., modified, effective September 6, 1985, the automatic stay as it extends to Walsh and the 
corporate defendants for purposes of permitting the continued prosecution of this appeal. The automatic stay resulting from 
IDC's petition does not affect our jurisdiction because, as to IDC, this appeal is not a proceeding ""against the debtor"" within the 
meaning of section 362.  Commerzanstalt v. Telewide Systems, Inc., 790 F.2d 206, 207 (2d Cir. 1986) (per curiam). "
683,2," As a result, we need not inquire whether (1) IDC had the burden of proving that NRT's prices were below NRT's reasonably 
anticipated marginal costs, or (2) NRT had the burden of rebutting IDC's proof that NRT's prices were below NRT's average 
variable costs by coming forward with evidence that those prices were above NRT's reasonably anticipated marginal costs. 
Compare Br. of Defendants-Appellants at 40-44 with Br. of Plaintiff-Appellee at 26-27 & n.15. "
684,3," HN3[
] ""Market power"" is a synonym for ""monopoly power."" We have previously defined ""monopoly power"" as ""the power to 
control prices or exclude competition . . . in the relevant market."" Broadway Delivery Corp. v. United Parcel Service, Inc., 651 
F.2d 122, 126-27 (2d Cir.,)cert. denied, 454 U.S. 968, 70 L. Ed. 2d 384, 102 S. Ct. 512 (1981). "
685,4," NRT maintains that it only had 10% of the market. IDC maintains that NRT's market share was closer to 17%. NRT 
hypothesizes that IDC still had a 33% share of the market in 1984. The record is unclear as to whether either party presented 
market share calculations to the district court, but both IDC and NRT have used evidence that was properly admitted at trial to 
make the calculations contained in their appellate briefs and we rely on those calculations. Viewing the evidence in the light most 
favorable to the verdict, we assume that IDC established that NRT enjoyed a 17% market share in 1984. "
686,5," We note as a preliminary matter that any conspiracy relevant here would have had to begin before Walsh and NRT hired 
defendants Henning, Tice, Weiss, Sabatini or Hannon. Once these defendants and Walsh became ""officers or employees of the 
same firm[, they could] not provide the plurality of actors imperative for a ยง 1 conspiracy."" Copperweld Corp. v. Independence 
Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 769, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628, 104 S. Ct. 2731 (1984) (citing, inter alia, Schwimmer, 677 F.2d at 953). After 
joining NRT, any concerted activity between any of these defendants and Walsh could not ""represent a sudden joining of two 
independent sources of economic power previously pursuing separate interests . . . that warrants ยง 1 scrutiny."" Copperweld, 467 
U.S. at 771. "
687,6," As a general policy matter, one firm's hiring of its competitor's employees does not present a ""compelling case for antitrust 
intervention."" 3 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law, ยง 702b at 109 (1978) (referring to monopolist's hiring of competitor's 
employees). A contrary analysis might constrict the freedom of employees to reap the full benefits of their abilities by 
discouraging them from moving to the employer offering the highest compensation, as well as by discouraging employers from 
bidding on a competitor's employees. Id."
687,7," Our conclusion might be altered had the IDC defendants misappropriated trade secrets from IDC in the course of working for 
NRT. The jury, however, found that IDC possessed no such trade secrets. "
688,8," The trial judge instructed the jury that ""the elements of [conspiracy to monopolize] are essentially the same for [the elements of] 
an attempt to monopolize . . . with the additional proof of a conspiracy to achieve that purpose. . . ."" J. App. at 2221-22. HN9[

Unlike the elements required to establish an attempt to monopolize, however, proof of a conspiracy to monopolize does not 
require a dangerous probability of success. American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U.S. 781, 789, 90 L. Ed. 1575, 66 S.

Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 495 F. Supp. 649, 668 (S.D.N.Y. 1980) (conspiracy to monopolize, like attempt to 
monopolize, requires dangerous probability of success), aff'd, 697 F.2d 495, 496 (2d Cir. 1983); Kreager v. General Electric Co., 
497 F.2d 468, 471 (2d Cir.) (same), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 861, 42 L. Ed. 2d 95, 95 S. Ct. 111 (1974). See also V. & L. Cicione, 
Inc. v. C. Schmidt & Sons, Inc., 403 F. Supp. 643, 651-53 & n.11 (E.D. Pa. 1975) (treating all violations of Sherman Act ยง 2, 
including conspiracy to monopolize, as requiring a showing of dangerous probability of success), aff'd mem., 565 F.2d 154 (3d 
Cir. 1977). Indeed, the Supreme Court has recognized that the elements of an attempt to monopolize are subject to confusion 
with those of a conspiracy to monopolize. Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide, 370 U.S. 690, 709, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777, 82 S. Ct. 
1404 (1962). See Von Kalinowski, supra, ยง 9.02[1] at 9-33 & n.4 (listing cases which confuse elements of attempt to monopolize 
and conspiracy to monopolize by requiring dangerous probability of success in both). Congress outlawed the conspiracy itself.  Nash v. United States, 229 U.S. 373, 378, 57 L. Ed. 1232, 33 S. Ct. 780 (1913). HN10[ ] Once a plaintiff establishes a conspiracy with a specific intent to monopolize, proof of success or impending success is 
irrelevant.  American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U.S. 781, 789, 90 L. Ed. 1575, 66 S. Ct. 1125 (1946) (""it has long been 
settled . . . [that defendant] might have been convicted here of a conspiracy to monopolize without ever having acquired the 
power to carry out the object of the conspiracy""); United States v. Griffith, 334 U.S. 100, 107 n.9, 92 L. Ed. 1236, 68 S. Ct. 941 
(1948) (same). See Copperweld, 467 U.S. at 767-71 & n.13 (explaining Congress' intent and rationale for treating conspiratorial 
conduct more harshly than unilateral conduct). A major concern underlying antitrust jurisprudence lies in the fear of mistakenly attaching antitrust liability to conduct that in 
reality is the competitive activity the Sherman Act seeks to protect. See Part A, supra; Handler, Reforming the Antitrust Laws, 82 
Colum. L. Rev. 1287, 1352-53 (1982). In this context, we note that HN11[
] proof problems regarding antitrust conspiracies are 
remedied by the close judicial scrutiny applied to evidence of their existence. Cf.  Matsushita, 54 U.S.L.W. at 4322-23 (antitrust 
law limits the range of permissible inferences of conspiracy from ambiguous evidence); Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service 
Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 763-64, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775, 104 S. Ct. 1464 (1984) (same). Attempted monopoly, however, implicates proof 
problems which partly explain our requirement that plaintiffs establish a dangerous probability of success under this section 2 
offense. See Part A, supra; Handler, supra, at 1352-53 (dangerous probability element in attempted monopoly cases ""assur[es] 
that aggressive single-firm conduct will not be attacked as attempted monopolization,"" id. at 1353; assures that procompetitive 
conduct will not be chilled by antitrust laws). Conspiracy to monopolize, therefore, differs from attempt to monopolize in at least 
one respect critical to our imposition of the additional element of a dangerous probability of success. "

mode of transportation. "
702,7," HN4[
]  49 U.S.C. ยง 10101a provides, in pertinent part: In regulating the railroad industry, it it the policy of the United States Government -- (1) to allow, to the maximum extent possible, competition and the demand for services to establish reasonable rates for 
transportation by rail;"
702,*," * * * * * (4) to ensure the development and continuation of a sound rail  [**19]  transportation system with effective competition 
among rail carriers and with other modes, to meet the needs of the public and the national defense; (5) to foster sound economic conditions in transportation and to ensure effective competition and coordination between rail 
carriers and other modes; "
703,," (6) to maintain reasonable rates where there is an absence of effective competition and where rail rates provide revenues 
which exceed the amount necessary to maintain the rail system and to attract capital; (7) to reduce regulatory barriers to entry into and exit from the industry;"
703,*," * * * * * (13) to prohibit predatory pricing and practices, to avoid undue concentrations of market power and to prohibit unlawful 
discrimination;"
703,8," The complaint alleges that Conrail has monopolized or attempted to monopolize the relevant rail market. The law applicable to 
such allegations is clear. In order to prove unlawful monopolization, the plaintiff must demonstrate the defendant's monopoly 
power and its willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of 
a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident.  Berkey Photo Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 603 F.2d 263, 274 (2d Cir. 
1979), cert.  denied, 444 U.S. 1093, 62 L. Ed. 2d 783, 100 S. Ct. 1061 (1980). To prove an attempt to monopolize, the plaintiff 
must show that the defendant employed methods which, though falling short of monopolization, create a dangerous probability 
of it with the specific intent to destroy competition or build a monopoly.  Buffalo Courier-Exp. v. Buffalo Evening News, 601 F.2d 
48, 54 (2d Cir. 1979). The ICC analysis in Decision Number 38676 concentrates primarily on evidence related to transit time, 
mileage, and fuel consumption associated with joint rate cancellations. Such information would appear, at least at this juncture, 
to have little impact on the application of the law summarized above. "
704,9," Specifically, paragraphs 15(a), (b), (e), and (g)."
704,10," D&H asserts that the four-year-period of 15 U.S.C. 15b functions merely as a limitation of damages. That is, a successful 
complainant can only recover for damages occurring during the four years prior to the filing of the complaint, regardless of when 
the acts that caused those damages occurred. Trans. at 33. "
709,1," Implicit in our Flip Side I is an assumption that the relevant product market is the promotion of concerts, including rock, rhythm 
and blues, and ""black-oriented"" concerts in the Chicago metropolitan area. While Jam ""denies"" this description in its 
counterclaim (amended counterclaim P 12), it does not present an alternative definition so we will continue to use it as the basis 
for discussion."
709,2," Besides the irony in Jam jumping its own fence to argue from the other side, we question the sincerity of its counterclaim in the 
face of the fact that during the relevant time period it too was trying to get an exclusive agreement with the International 
Amphitheatre. See Rosenbaum dep. at 121 (""Did you know in 1976 that Jam was attempting to obtain an exclusive right to use 
or to promote concerts at the International Amphitheatre?"") (question directed at Rosenbaum by Jam's attorney), and Exhibits 6, 
7, 9 thereto. "
710,3," It is of more than passing interest that the Chicago Stadium was found to be far superior to the International Amphitheatre, at 
least for professional basketball, in Fishman v. Estate of Wirtz, 807 F.2d 520, 539 (7th Cir. 1986). "
712,4," We caution Flip Side that such is not the case in its new suit against Jam and Contemporary Productions. Further, we suggest 
that Flip Side look closely at the impact Flip Side I might have on Flip Side II in terms of Rule 11 and the standards set forth 
above. See Cannon v. Loyola University of Chicago, 784 F.2d 777 (7th Cir. 1986). "
718,1," Three of the defendants in this case are local unions that were not parties to the Maryland litigation.  The district court granted 
summary judgment to one because Premier had not produced any evidence showing that the local was involved in the events of 
which Premier complained.  627 F. Supp. at 966-67. It denied the motion of the other local unions because the evidence was not 
dispositive either way.  Id. at 967-68. The parties have not discussed in this court the status of these two local unions, and 
Premier's appeal was dismissed on October 1, 1986, to the extent it concerned these unions.  We therefore do not discuss the 
claims made by and against these unions. "
725,2," The scope of the arrangement is made possible by the labor laws' tolerance of multi-employer bargaining groups and unions 
that organize the entire craft or trade.  Without the assistance of the Union the Association could not have achieved its objective.  
Several thoughtful scholars have questioned industry-wide collective bargaining.  See T. Campbell, Labor Law and Economics, 
38 Stan.L.Rev. 991, 1047-58 (1986); R. Lande & R. Zerbe, Reducing Unions' Monopoly Power: Costs and Benefits, 28 J.L. & 
Econ. 297 (1985). But Premier does not object to the scope of the Union's organization of the industry; the Union, for its part, 
does not repeat the contention (which both the Maryland district court, 498 F. Supp. at 539-43, and the Fourth Circuit, 678 F.2d 
at 502, rejected) that the labor laws shelter any agreement they reached with the Association.  We therefore do not pursue this 
matter. "
726,3," We express no view on the validity of an agreement among members of the Association to collect a 1% fee measured by their 
own payrolls.  That agreement affects a smaller portion of the industry's output and does not prevent any firm from dropping its 
membership in order to compete vigorously.  An intra-Association fee does not involuntarily raise any rival's cost. "
728,4," The due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments also protect access to the courts.  See Bounds v. Smith, 430 
U.S. 817, 97 S. Ct. 1491, 52 L. Ed. 2d 72 (1977); Lindsey v. Normet, 405 U.S. 56, 92 S. Ct. 862, 31 L. Ed. 2d 36 (1972); but see 
United States v. Kras, 409 U.S. 434, 93 S. Ct. 631, 34 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1973); Fuller v. Oregon, 417 U.S. 40, 94 S. Ct. 2116, 40 L. 
Ed. 2d 642 (1974)."
728,5," It also creates a new third-party effect by foisting on the loser the winner's fees, see R. Posner, Economic Analysis of Law ยง 
21.9 (3d ed. 1986), but we disregard this complication. "
729,6," Sealy itself disallowed a multiplier based on risk, but on the rationale that compensation for risk came through the trebling of 
damages.  Id. at 661-62.  Here the costs of litigation are the damages sought to be trebled."
729,7," See 461 U.S. at 745-47, 103 S. Ct. at 2171-72, concluding that the Board may not order the cessation of a lawsuit unless the 
suit is fatuous, but that if a colorable suit is pressed and the plaintiff loses, the Board ""would be warranted in taking that fact into 
account in determining whether the suit had been filed in retaliation for the exercise of the employees' ยง 7 rights.  If a violation is 
found, the Board may order the employer to reimburse the employees whom he had wrongfully sued for their attorney's fees and 
other expenses."" Id. at 747, 103 S. Ct. at 2172."
729,8," The Court's analysis has been confirmed by data.  J. Barron & J. Umbeck, The Effects of Different Contractual Arrangements: 
The Case of Retail Gasoline Markets, 27 J.L. & Econ. 313 (1984). "
753,1," In Ianniello, the single purpose of the enterprise was ""fraud continuing indefinitely,"" 808 F.2d at 191, -- specifically, skimming 
profits from various businesses. It ""had no obvious terminating goal,"" id.  at 192, so the enterprise element was clearly 
established. Here it could be argued that the enterprise -- the purpose of which was ""to terminate Reiter's and obtain its 
business"" (R&R at 24) -- did have an obvious terminating goal: driving plaintiff out of business, or at least out of the business of 
distributing defendant's products. The distinction does not really help defendant here, however. Plaintiff has alleged a continuing 
course of activity -- in fact, three years' worth -- in pursuit of that goal. Moreover, defendant does not appear to object to the 
sufficiency of the pleading of the enterprise requirement. "
755,1," Schmidt notes in the Affidavit of Robert L. Welty submitted in Opposition to the Motion to Amend the Complaint, that Reiter's 
has misquoted the letter from John P. Jones, Schmidt's Vice President for Marketing and Sales. The letter summarized a 
meeting held between the parties on July 17, 1984, and reads as follows:"
755,3," . You continue to sell customers from other boroughs than Brooklyn at your dock. Status: You are going to decide whether you are going to discontinue that practice and Midway Beverage is going to decide 
whether to discontinue selling Rheingold in Brooklyn. "
756,2," Reiter's letter to Magistrate Amon dated June 19, 1986 at p. 4, para. 3; see, also Plaintiff's Reply Memorandum of Law in 
Support of its Motion for a Preliminary Injunction Point III. "
758,3," Plaintiff cites 9 Von Kalinowski ยง 105.02 [5] as authority for the section of the amended complaint bearing this heading. 
Plaintiff's assertion that the allegations contained within that section are ""squarely within the usual and permitted scope of 
pleading an antitrust claim"" (Plaintiff's Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion to Amend Complaint) is untenable. ยง 105.02[5] 
provides a guide for making the proper jurisdictional allegations, and for alleging, in that context, that the acts complained of 
affect interstate commerce of a business. The kind of information offered by Reiter's has no bearing on this jurisdictional 
question. "
759,4," A copy of the complaint in State of New York v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., et al. was sent by plaintiff to Magistrate Amon on July 
17, 1986.  Defendant noted in its July 18, 1986 letter to Magistrate Amon that Schmidt is not one of the four breweries named in 
that complaint. Furthermore, although both Reiter's and Midway are among the defendant distributors, a review of the complaint 
reveals that neither of them is named by reason of any conduct or practice either by Schmidt or related to the sale or distribution 
of Schmidt's products. Thus any allegation concerning that proceeding in Reiter's proposed amended complaint is irrelevant."
759,5," Continental TV Inc. v. GTE Sylvania 433 U.S. 36, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568, 97 S. Ct. 2549 (1977) overruled the rule of Arnold Schwinn 
which made restrictions of resale locations by a wholesaler a per se violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Sylvania held that 
such restrictions of location should be judged under the traditional rule-of-reason standard. "
760,6," 18 U.S.C. ยง 1962(c) states: (c) it shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which 
affect interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's 
affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt. "

771,1," Nothing in the complaint suggests that the independent distributors conspired with defendants to fix prices. In fact, a parallel 
federal action is proceeding in which direct purchasers from defendants are seeking relief under federal antitrust laws for the 
same conduct alleged herein.  (Superior Beverage Co. Inc. v. Owens-Illinois, Inc., et al. (N.D. Ill.) Civ. No. 83 512 and related 
cases.) "
772,2," In 1978, the California Legislature added the following paragraph to HN2[
] section 16750, subdivision (a) of the Business and Professions Code: ""Such action may be brought by any person who is injured in his business or property by reason of 
anything forbidden or declared unlawful by this chapter, regardless of whether such injured person dealt directly or indirectly with 
the defendant."" (Italics added.)"
772,5," HN7[
] To meet the requirements for a class under rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure plaintiff must show numerosity of the class, typicality of the named plaintiff's claim, and adequacy of representation.  In addition, plaintiff must show 
that the common questions of law or fact predominate over questions affecting only individual class members and that the class 
action is the fairest and most efficient means of resolving the dispute. "
773,6," HN12[
] Violations of the Cartwright Act are also unlawful business practices under the unfair competition statutes.  (See People v. National Association of Realtors (1981) 120 Cal.App.3d 459, 473-476 [174 Cal.Rptr. 728, 22 A.L.R.4th 79].) "
774,7," Courts and commentators have taken great pains to point out that HN14[
] injury or ""fact of damage,"" which must be proven 
on a class-wide basis, is separate and distinct from the issue of actual damages.  As was pointed out in Zenith Corp. v. 
Hazeltine (1969) 395 U.S. 100, 114, footnote 9 [23 L.Ed.2d 129, 143, 89 S.Ct. 1562], HN15[
] an antitrust plaintiff's ""burden of 
proving the fact of damage . . . is satisfied by its proof of some damage flowing from the unlawful conspiracy; inquiry beyond this 
minimum point goes only to the amount and not the fact of damage."" (See e.g., Rosack v. Volvo of America Corp., supra, 131 
Cal.App.3d at p. 757; Hedges Enterprises, Inc. v. Continental Group (E.D.Pa. 1979) 81 F.R.D. 461, 474-475; Note, Substantive 
Policies and Procedural Decisions: An Approach to Certifying Rule 23(b)(3) Antitrust Class Actions (1979) 31 Hastings L.J. 491, 
502-503.) ""Fact of damage pertains to the existence of injury, as a predicate to liability; actual damages involve the quantum of 
injury, and relate to the appropriate measure of individual relief."" ( Martino v. McDonald's System, Inc. (N.D.Ill. 1980) 86 F.R.D. 
145, 147.) However, class treatment of fact of damage presumes the ability to prove the class as a whole was injured without 
becoming enmeshed in individual questions of actual damage.  (Ibid.) "
775,8," Plaintiff substantiates this proposition by stating that ""each distributor whose deposition has been taken testified that price 
increases by the defendants/manufacturers were completely passed on to plaintiff and the members of the class."" "
776,9," We note that class actions were frequently allowed prior to the United States Supreme Court's decision in Illinois Brick Co. v. 
Illinois, supra, 431 U.S. 720, even though the class members were indirect purchasers and were injured in different amounts.  
(See, e.g..  In re Antibiotic Antitrust Actions (S.D.N.Y. 1971) 333 F.Supp. 278; In re Sugar Industry Antitrust Litigation, supra,

783,2," A related action, Gann v. Star-Kist, No. CV 85-0553-K, has been filed by the vessel owners against the canneries alleging the 
same antitrust violations alleged in the present case. "
788,1," The purpose of this motion for summary judgment, both parties agree, is to request a determination of whether the state action 
exemption applies, based solely on the relevant statutes and rules, in order to avoid if possible a long and complex trial involving 
the adoption and enforcement of the State Board's various rules over the last ten years. Plaintiff appears to be presenting a case 
that involves the history of the State Board's rules, policies, and practices extending from at least as far back as 1974 up to the 
present."
788,2," The prorate program set up for raisins required producers in a particular zone to place most of their raisins in various ""pools"" to

market. "
789,3," In Bates, two licensed attorneys had run afoul of rules promulgated by the Arizona State Supreme Court that prohibited certain 
attorney advertising. Subjected to disciplinary proceedings by the Arizona State Bar, the attorneys challenged the advertising

furtherance or implementation of clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state policy. 102 S. Ct. at 841. "
792,9," The legislative committees have disapproved rules on advertising submitted by the State Board. On March 20, 1983, the House 
Committee on Commerce issued a report disapproving two rules of the State Board which required a CPA to retain copies of 
advertisements, solicitations and public communication for three years and to transmit copies of them to the State Board. (.See 
Committee Report, House of Representative, Committee on Commerce, March 3, 1983.) "
797,1," The district court's decision is reported at R.C. Dick Geothermal Corp. v. Thermogenics, Inc., 619 F. Supp. 441 (N.D. Cal. 
1985). Dick does not appeal the district court's rejection of its claims under section two of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 2. "
800,2," The Hughes subsidiaries and PEC engaged in a joint venture to exploit the Filley property adjacent to the Dick property. In 
1976, PEC transferred all of its steam interests to TGI."
800,3," For the purpose of their motion for summary judgment, the defendants stipulated that they had conspired with anticompetitive 
intent to withhold production of 90 megawatts of steam from the Dick property. "
801,4," The Dick property in 1100 acres. Between 1973-81, Hughes had leases or interests in over 18,000 acres in the Geysers. 
Between 1981-82, Hughes had interests in three properties (including the Dick property) totalling 1500 acres. However, it is 
unclear how much of the Hughes property was producing steam during this period. Dick's complaint alleges that the defendants' 
conspiracy was intended in part to enable Hughes to sell steam from the neighboring Filley property in place of the suppressed 
steam from the Dick property."
801,5," Assuming that there were other horizontal relationships between Hughes and the other defendants (e.g., between Hughes and 
PEC curing 1973-76, see supra note 2 and accompanying text), those agreements, like the Hughes-GRI agreement, would have 
entailed an agreement by one competitor (Hughes) to restrict steam on one of its properties (the Dick property). "
802,6," It is not entirely clear that Dick was engaged in commerce in the steam market. When Dick entered into the sublease 
agreement with GRI in 1966, it relinquished the right to develop geothermal steam on the Dick property. There is no evidence 
that Dick had any other involvement in developing geothermal properties in the Geysers. However, while Dick was not involved 
in selling steam, it did receive a royalty from the defendant lease-holders based on the amount of steam sold. While Dick was 
not a participant in the steam market as a seller of steam, we will assume that it had a sufficient role in that market to bring a 
section one claim. "
803,7, The parties agree that the relevant steam market consists of all steam produced in the Geysers.
803,8," For example, the district court stated that the defendants are ""the smallest producer (2.3 percent market share) among the top 
four steam suppliers currently operating in the Geysers . . . ."" R.C. Dick Geothermal, 619 F. Supp. at 457. "
804,9," In its clearest discussion of the ""naked"" restraint rule, the Court stated: [The NCAA] does not quarrel with the District Court's finding that price and output are not responsive to demand. Thus the plan 
is inconsistent with the Sherman Act's command that price and supply be responsive to consumer preference. We have never 
required proof of market power in such a case. This naked restraint on price and output requires some competitive justification 
even in the absence of a detailed market analysis. NCAA, 468 U.S. at 109-10 (footnotes omitted)."
804,10," The cases relied upon by NCAA in support of its ""naked restraint"" rule were all per se cases. Indeed, the term ""naked"" is 
generally used to refer to restraints that are per se illegal. See Topco, 405 U.S. at 610. See generally 7 P. Areeda, Antitrust 
Law para. 1511, at 434 (describing NCAA approach as a melding of per se and Rule of Reason analysis)."
804,11," The Court also reiterated the NCAA principle that proof of market power is unnecessary in the face of naked restraint on price 
or output. However, the Court declined to hold that the restriction at issue was ""sufficiently naked"" to justify application of the 
NCAA principle.  Indiana Federation, 106 S. Ct. at 2018-19. "
805,12," The alleged 90 megawatt output restriction constituted a significant portion of total steam production in the Geysers. Steam 
output in the Geysers was 396 megawatts in 1973, 980 megawatts in 1980, and 1,310 megawatts in 1983."
805,14," Indiana Federation can be read to hold that, for certain types of output restrictions, effect on price is irrelevant even absent a 
detailed market analysis. In upholding a determination that a conspiracy by dentists to withhold information from insurance 
companies violated the Sherman Act, the Court noted that ""[a] concerted and effective effort to withhold . . . information desired 
by consumers for the purpose of determining whether a particular purchase is cost-justified is likely enough to disrupt the proper 
functioning of the price-setting mechanism of the market that it may be condemned even absent proof that it resulted in higher 
prices . . . ."" Indiana Federation, 106 S. Ct. at 2019. The Court went on to state that even if no price effects would result, the 
defendant was ""not entitled to pre-empt the working of the market by deciding for itself that its customers do not need that which "
806,," they demand."" Id. at 2019-20. However, Indiana Federation is distinguishable from the case at issue because it involved a 
horizontal conspiracy by dominant competitors which clearly reduced ""output"" below competitive levels. In the instant case, 
where the anticompetitive nature of the output restriction is less obvious, it is appropriate to look to price effects in evaluating the 
legality of the defendants' agreement. "
807,15," In light of our finding that the district court properly evaluated the elements of proof supplied by Dick, we reject Dick's 
argument that the district court's conduct of the trial-which we review under the abuse of discretion standard, Kotz v. Bache 
Halsey Stuart, Inc., 685 F.2d 1204, 1208 (9th Cir. 1982) -was improper."
807,16," The district court indicated in a footnote that Dick's ""unsubstantiated statements regarding a quality-based market definition 
were insufficient to create a triable issue of fact regarding the scope of relevant market. R.C. Dick Geothermal, 619 F. Supp. at 
447 n.3. However, it did not address the issue of whether the defendants had established that there were no genuine factual 
issues regarding Dick's transportation-based market definition. "
815,1," The other plaintiff, Seaboard Products, Inc., is under the legal control of Knife and therefore only a nominal party to this action. 
Consequently, the court will refer strictly to plaintiff Knife in its discussion. "
816,2," HN1[
] Tying exists, under antitrust law, when sellers of a particular good (the tying product) condition its sale on the purchase of another, separate good (the tied product). See, e.g., Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. United States, 1958, 356 U.S. 
1, 5-6, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545, 78 S. Ct. 514. At first impression, Knife's tying claim seems novel. It apparently rests solely on Banfi's 
decision, in 1976, to change a policy of billing wine and freight separately to its current practice of charging one undifferentiated 
package price. Before and after the changed billing, Knife purchased freight as well as wine from Banfi and, according to 
counsel, did not ask to buy the freight separately until after the lawsuit was filed. "
817,3," In this respect, caselaw seeks to take account of the interdependent pricing of the tying and tied products, a factor emphasized 
in economic analyses of tying arrangements. See, e.g., P. Areeda & D. Turner, 5 Antitrust Law para. 1134b at 204 (1980); R. 
Posner, Antitrust Law: An Economic Perspective 173 (1976)."
817,4," The fair market value of the tied product, freight, does not appear to present a serious problem. Since there is a ready market 
for freight, the parties need not attempt to construct a hypothetical market value by extrapolating or projecting from imperfect 
data. The only issue, it seems, is which market price of freight among the numerous prices available is appropriate in this case."
817,5," The court does not rule out the possibility that an excess charge resulting from this calculation may be caused by 
circumstances other than tying -- e.g., improved service. If such an excess exists, defendant will certainly be free at trial to 
dispute its causal connection to the alleged tying arrangement. In the interest of simplicity, however, the court will assume for 
purposes of resolving the instant dispute that no other factors exist."
817,6," The importance of positing and, even more, identifying separate product markets is now apparent in the substantive law of 
tying arrangements, see Jefferson Parish Hospital Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 1984, 466 U.S. 2, 19-22, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2, 104 S. Ct. 1551, 
as well as in the proper computation of damages. Cf.  Will v. Comprehensive Accounting Corp., 7 Cir. 1985, 776 F.2d 665, 672-
73. "
822,1," By section 542.32, the legislature has directed that in construing chapter 542, ""due consideration and great weight be given to 
the interpretations of the federal courts"" relating to the body of antitrust law developed under the Sherman Act. See St. 
Petersburg Yacht Charters v. Morgan Yacht, Inc., 457 So.2d 1028, 1032 (Fla. 2d DCA 1984)."
822,2," Although the PSC's rule 25-22.008, Florida Administrative Code, does not preclude self-representation, it does state that ""the 
right of self-representation [sic] does not allow nonlawyer corporate officers to represent the legal interest of their corporations 
except upon compliance with the requirements of subsection (3) of this rule."" Subsection (3) provides that a person may receive 
a ""Class B"" certification by satisfying the commission ""that he or she possesses legal skills and a knowledge of the law and utility 
regulatory matters which is greater than that possessed by the average person,"" as well as knowledge of the code of ethics for 
administrative proceedings. "
854,1," The facts are drawn from the complaint, from Conoco's Statement of Material Facts, from plaintiffs' Statement of Material Facts, 
and from copies of the court file in Case No. 26818, in the District Court of the Eighteenth Judicial District of the State of 
Montana, in and for the County of Gallatin, of which the Court takes judicial notice. Fed. R. Evid. 201.  Where disputed, the facts 
are construed in plaintiffs' favor. See T. W.  Electrical Service, Inc., et al. v. Pacific Electrical Contractors Association, 809 F.2d 
626, 630-31 (9th Cir. 1987). "
857,2," Article IV, Sec. 1, provides in pertinent part: HN2[
] Full faith and credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and Judicial Proceedings of every 
other State."
857,3, 28 U.S.C. ยง 1738 provides in pertinent part: 
858,," HN3[
] [The] Acts, records and judicial proceedings [of the legislature or any court of any State, Territory, or Possession 
of the United States], shall have the same full faith and credit in every court within the United States and its Territories and 
Possessions as they have by law or usage in the courts of such State, Territory or Possession from which they are taken."
858,4," Plaintiffs claim that they never even filed a responsive pleading in the state action. The record indicates, however, that an 
answer was filed December 22, 1980, consisting of a general denial of the allegations contained in the complaint. "
865,5," Indeed, the only evidence of a ""conspiracy"" is the agreement between Rutledge and Taggarts that Rutledge alone would 
submit a bid. See 16A J.  Von Kalinowski, Business Organizations ยง 6A.02[3] at 6A-21 (discussing collusive bidding practices as 
unlawful price fixing under sections 1 and 3 of the Sherman Act)."
865,6," Section 2 HN34[
] makes it unlawful to ""monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person 
or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several states, or with foreign nations . . . ."" "
866,7," Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f) allows the Court to order a continuance to permit further discovery or submission of additional affidavits if 
the nonmoving party cannot present facts ""essential to justify his opposition."" Plaintiffs, however, have not suggested that they 
have had inadequate opportunity for discovery, and indeed, the discovery generated in this case is voluminous. Rule 56(f) will 
not assist a party where a full and fair opportunity for discovery has been provided, as here. See Pfeil v. Rogers, 757 F.2d 850 
(7th Cir. 1985); Creusot-Loire International, Inc. v. Coppus Engineering Corp., 585 F. Supp. 45 (S.D.N.Y. 1983). "
867,8," 15 U.S.C. ยง 13(a) provides in pertinent part: HN46[
] It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, either directly or 
indirectly, to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality, where either or any 
of the purchases involved in such discrimination are in commerce, where such commodities are sold for use, consumption, 
or resale within the United States . . ., and where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen 
competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy or prevent competition with any 
person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them . . . . "
869,9," Although the court in Zoslaw indicated that this ""threshold"" issue would normally be a jury question, HN56[
] summary 
judgment is appropriate where plaintiffs have not presented an adequate record to support a finding in their favor.  Dimidowich v. 
Bell & Howell, 803 F.2d 1473, 1477 (9th Cir. 1986), reh'g denied, 810 F.2d 1517 (9th Cir. Feb. 25, 1987). "
871,10," HN70[
] The ""rule of reason"" is also applied in analyzing restrictions imposed in the context of ""dual distributorships."" Dimidowich v. Bell & Howell, 803 F.2d at 1481. This concept refers to a situation where, as here, the defendant ""operates at two 
distinct levels of the distribution chain in the same market by acting as both a supplier and a distributor of [the] product."" Id. at 
1480; Krehl v. Baskin Robbins Ice Cream Co., 664 F.2d 1348, 1350-51 (9th Cir. 1982)."
871,11," Section 3 HN76[
] of the Clayton Act makes it unlawful for any person, in the course of interstate or foreign commerce, to 
lease or sell any commodity, or to contract to do so, ""on the condition, agreement or understanding that the lessee or purchaser "
872,," thereof shall not use or deal in the . . . commodities of a competitor or competitors of the lessor or seller, where the effect . . . 
may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce."" 15 U.S.C. ยง 14."
872,12," Tying arrangements are defined and discussed infra, pp. slip op. 41-46. "
873,13," The Court makes no finding as to whether this represents the appropriate geographic market, but merely draws this inference 
in plaintiffs' favor from the evidence submitted. "
874,14," Although defendants maintain that the supply agreement was a fully negotiated arms-length transaction desired by plaintiffs to 
guarantee a supply of gasoline, the Court assumes as true, for purposes of this ruling, plaintiffs' contention that they were 
compelled to execute the agreement or risk losing their station."
874,15," The potential 15-year term involved in the contract, although not inordinately long, carries a sufficient suggestion of restraint to 
resolve this factor in plaintiffs' favor. "
875,16," See Moore, 550 F.2d at 1217 (HN91[
] coercion occurs when the buyer must accept the tied item and forego possibly 
desirable substitutes). "
876,17," Because this arrangement is being tested under section 1 of the Sherman Act, the strict ""in commerce"" requirements of the 
Robinson-Patman Act discussed supra do not apply. For the purposes of this ruling, the Court takes as true plaintiffs' contention 
that the ""affecting commerce"" standard of section 1 is satisfied by the evidence presented herein. "
884,1," According to Hesston, Smith further indicated that it did not wish to jeopardize its relationship with John Deere by carrying a 
competitive tractor, but that assertion is controverted by Smith."
884,2," This is a disputed issue. Hesston asserts that the termination was prompted, at least in part, by Hesston's general 
dissatisfaction with the Smith dealership. Hesston asserts that Smith was a ""cherry-picker,"" taking advantage of Hesston's best 
selling items and making no effort with respect to the rest of the line. Hesston also alleges that it was dissatisfied with Smith's 
wait-and-see approach to marketing. Smith usually employed no outside sales people. Rather, Smith waited for customers to 
come in to the showroom to make a sale. Estes, on the other hand, had a more aggressive sales approach and did employ an 
outside sales force. For purposes of ruling on these motions, the Court accepts as true Smith's view of the reason for termination 
of the dealership. As explained below, the Court finds that summary judgment in favor of the Defendant is proper even if the sole 
reason for termination was Smith's refusal to carry the Hesston tractor."
884,3," The transcript of that proceeding is part of the record presently before the Court. A substantial amount of other evidence is also 
before the Court. "
885,4," The state claim could, of course, be dismissed in the Court's discretion under the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction, United Mine 
Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 726 (1966). "
886,5," Per se analysis has been adopted by the Supreme Court largely because the rule of reason analysis generally requires 
extensive, prolonged, and difficult consideration of the impact of the alleged violation on the market, and the Supreme Court 
opted for ease of decision, predictability and economy for litigants and courts in the context of agreements which it deems 
""plainly anticompetitive."" See, e.g., Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Society, 457 U.S. 332, 351 (1982); Continental T.V., Inc. 
v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 50 n. 16 (1977); Northern Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5 (1958). In the context 
of tying arrangements, considerable confusion has developed because of the recognition that not all tying agreements are 
anticompetitive at all, and many are, in fact, procompetitive. See NCAA v. Board of Regents, 468 U.S. 85, 104 n. 26 (1984). The 
means for deciding which tying agreements are ""plainly anticompetitive"" enough to justify per se treatment has become so 
complex and difficult that the objectives of the per se rule are no longer being realized through its use. See Jefferson Parish, 466 
U.S. at 32-42 (O'Connor, J., concurring in the judgment)."
886,6," The Jefferson Parish analysis is stated slightly differently than the three element analysis previously employed. The test for per 
se violation was often stated as follows: First, purchases of the tying product must be conditioned upon purchases of a distinct 
tied product; second, a seller must possess sufficient power in the tying market to compel acceptance of the tied product; third, 
the tying arrangement must foreclose to competitors of the tied product a not insubstantial volume of commerce. See Fox 
Motors, Inc. v. Mazda Distributors (Gulf), Inc., 806 F.2d 953, 957 (10th Cir. 1986). The considerations are essentially the same, 
but the Court is bound by the analytical structure specified in Jefferson Parish. "
887,7," The Court notes that the Tenth Circuit chose to align itself with the Seventh Circuit on another issue concerning per se analysis 
in vertical restraint cases on which the circuits were split.  Westman Commission Co. v. Hobart International, Inc., 796 F.2d 
1216, 1222-23 (10th Cir. 1986)."
887,8," The other part of the argument is that the Seventh Circuit's thinking is tainted by Chicago School of Law and Economics 
thinking. The Court declines to enter into this philosophical debate. "
903,1," The appellees are the Pennsylvania Dental Association, the Delaware Valley Dental Society, the Erie County Dental 
Association, Inc., the Harrisburg Area Dental Society, the Luzerne County Dental Society, the Montgomery-Bucks Dental 
Society, the Odontological Society of Western Pennsylvania, the Scranton Dental Society, the York County Dental Society, the "

Perkins, D.M.D., and Kay F. Thompson, D.D.S."
904,2," The summary judgment was granted on Blue Shield's third-party counterclaim. The litigation has had a complex history. It 
originated when the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania filed a complaint against the organized dentists, charging that they violated 
the antitrust laws by encouraging dentists to terminate Blue Shield participating dentist agreements. The organized dentists filed 
a counterclaim against the Commonwealth and a third-party complaint against Blue Shield. Blue Shield answered, and filed the 
third-party counterclaim with which this appeal is concerned. The Commonwealth and the organized dentists entered into a 
settlement which resulted in dismissal of the original complaint and counterclaim. Thereafter, Blue Shield moved for and 
obtained summary judgment in its favor on the organized dentists' third-party complaint, and this court affirmed.  Pennsylvania 
Dental Assn. v. Medical Service Assn. of Pennsylvania, 574 F. Supp. 457 (M.D.Pa. 1983), aff'd, 745 F.2d 248 (3d Cir. 1984), 
cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1016, 85 L. Ed. 2d 303, 105 S. Ct. 2021 (1985). That left pending Blue Shield's federal and state law 
claims against the organized dentists. "
907,3," Specifically, the affidavits reveal that Holy Spirit Hospital and the Pennsylvania Senate, both purchasers of group dental 
coverage from Blue Shield, terminated their Blue Shield dental plans because of low dentist participation in their geographic 
areas. "
909,4," See Farbenfabriken Bayer, A.G. v. Sterling Drug, Inc., 197 F. Supp. 627 (D.N.J. 1961), aff'd, 307 F.2d 210, 134 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 
522 (3d Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 372 U.S. 929, 83 S. Ct. 872, 9 L. Ed. 2d 733, 136 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 679 (1963). "
913,*," Honorable Lloyd D. George, United States District Judge, District of Nevada, sitting by designation. "
915,1," Similar concepts sometimes have been expressed in terms of antitrust standing.  Bhan v. NME Hospitals, Inc., 772 F.2d 1467, 
1469 n.2 (9th Cir. 1985). Courts have also asked whether the plaintiff fell within the ""target area"" of the violation, or inquired into 
the ""directness"" or ""indirectness"" of the injury, or conducted an analysis of proximate cause. For commentary on the confusion 
engendered by these disparate approaches, see Associated General Contractors of California, Inc. v. State Council of 
Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 535-38 & 536 nn. 31-33, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723, 103 S. Ct. 897; Haff v. Jewelmont Corp., 594 F. Supp. 
1468, 1471-79 (N.D. Cal. 1984). "
920,1," Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment, Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, and brief in support of its motion 
may all be found under Docket #49. Reference to plaintiff's proposed facts will take the following form: Pl. Facts para.    , with 
reference to the particular paragraph therein. Defendant's proposed facts may be found under Docket #61, and will be 
referenced as follows: Defs. Facts para.    ."
920,2," The parties acknowledge that not all sales were produced in this manner but the number of non-home sales appears to be 
insubstantial. (Dkt. #51, Mahoney Aff., paras. 3-5; Dkt. #45, Peterson Dep. p. 19) "
921,3," At the time Cygan signed his contract, the KIRBY marketing hierarchy consisted of three layers: distributors (who typically 
operated in several counties), area distributors (who were sublicensed by distributors and serviced a smaller territory) and 
dealers (who were essentially sales people for area distributors). Record references to the various layers is the source of some 
confusion in light of KIRBY's decision, in the early 1980's, to begin referring to area distributors as ""area dealers"" (presumably, 
""dealers"" still operate at the third level of distribution). It should be noted that this case involves only the first two levels of the 
marketing hierarchy: distributors (like Cygan), and what are currently known as ""area dealers"" (like Poff). I have used the terms 
""area distributor"" and ""area dealer"" interchangeably to refer to those operating at the second level of distribution. "
922,4," Peterson had a ""written dealer agreement"" with KIRBY area distributor Don Byrd from 1973-1978. (Peterson apparently was 
operating at this time as a ""dealer,"" at the third level of distribution. See Dkt. #45, Peterson dep., p. 19) In 1978, Byrd informed 
Peterson that his dealership was being transferred to Cygan, and Peterson thereafter contracted with Cygan (Dkt. #14, Answer 
and Counterclaims, paras. 6-9)"
922,5," Cygan's Distributor Agreement with KIRBY contained a virtually identical clause establishing the Distributor's right to sublicense 
and providing for the automatic termination of the sublicense upon termination of the Distributor Agreement. (Dkt. #52, Ex. 3 
attached to Windfeldt Aff., para. 4) In 1982, KIRBY altered its Distributor Agreements to delete the provision authorizing 
distributors to grant sublicenses to area dealers, and entered into new Distributor Agreements with all of its then existing 
distributors. (Pl. Facts para. 12-13) "
923,6," The term ""dealership"" is employed as proposed by the parties without intending the conclusion that there was a continuity of 
defendant's previously existing legal relationship with Cygan."
923,7," Defendant's Answer and Counterclaim (Dkt. #14, para. 15) indicates that the change was made because Peterson's location in 
Beloit was in the territory assigned to Patel."
923,8, The parties' proposed findings do not specify the source or resolution of these allegations. 
924,9, The third-party defendants' proposed facts may be found under Docket #54.
924,10," To the extent that plaintiff seeks summary judgment on its unfair competition and trademark infringement claims, it will be 
recommended that the motions be denied. Plaintiff's failure to advance facts in support of its position (its proposed facts merely 
cite the complaint (Pl. Facts paras. 8, 24)) and the extremely limited record on these issues makes summary disposition 
inappropriate. "
925,11, Defendant's separate group boycott claim under ยง 1 is discussed below in part 1(b).
925,12," The issue is also relevant to defendant's claims under the Robinson-Patman Act and the Wisconsin Fair Dealership Law. See 
infra pp. 27 - 34."
925,13," For example, Peterson's contract with Cygan was assignable by either party with the written consent of the other, but there is 
no evidence that an assignment ever took place. "
926,14," Defendant has cited no cases in support of his contention that his course of dealing with Wear, Moody and Patel gave rise to 
one or more dealership agreements between himself and any or all of those distributors. He has also failed to identify the terms 
of, or to distinguish between, his purported contracts with these individuals. And, as noted above, there is no evidence that any 
of them affirmatively agreed to make defendant an area dealer. (It is agreed, in fact, that defendant did not have an Area Dealer 
Agreement with Patel.) It is interesting to note that the only unlawful conduct alleged is against parties with whom defendant did 
not have a contract, yet the one party with whom he did have an agreement (Cygan) is not a party to this suit and there is no 
suggestion that defendant has a claim for unlawful termination as to him."
926,15," Defendant's attempt to assign some relevance to the failure of KIRBY and its distributors to give him notice that his dealership 
terminated in 1980 is without merit. Defendant's contract with Cygan stated that the rights granted therein ""shall terminate 
automatically"" (emphasis added) upon Cygan's termination. Nothing in the contract required that notice of termination be given. 
Furthermore, defendant was not unfamiliar with the legal requirements associated with a change of distributors. When he was 
informed in 1978 by Don Byrd, his area distributor at the time, that his dealership was being transferred to Ed Cygan, he 
undertook to regularize his relationship with Cygan by signing a new written Agreement."
926,16," On the other hand it is equally possible that defendant chose to remain unattached as it freed him from any responsibility to a 
distributor. "
927,17," It is worth observing, in addition, that if defendant's conspiracy argument be accepted, a trademark infringer would always 
have available to him an automatic, self-proving Sherman Act defense by advertising the trademarked product for sale at a price 
below that of the authorized licensees."
927,18," I note that I have found as fact, based upon the affidavit of R. Scott Mahoney, the Director of Administration for KIRBY, that 
KIRBY has no control over the prices at which distributors or area dealers sell KIRBY products. Mahoney stated that KIRBY 
does not publish or in any other manner suggest sale prices to distributors or area dealers. (Dkt. #51, para. 6) In rebuttal, 
defendant relies upon a portion of Bharet Patel's deposition stating that KIRBY distributors meet every two months and discuss 
prices. (Dkt. #58 p. 40) However, there is nothing to indicate that KIRBY plays a role in those meetings and, in fact, Patel "
928,," affirmatively denied such a role (p. 41). This evidence stands as an additional barrier to accepting defendant's price fixing claim 
as the conspiracy charged is that of KIRBY and Patel and Poff, and only KIRBY can assert the trademark claims."
928,19," It will be noted that there is no evidence that defendant even asked that Patel appoint him as an area dealer, a condition which 
would have imposed contractual obligations upon defendant. And had defendant asked, Patel was at liberty to refuse.  United 
States v. Colgate, 250 U.S. 300, 307 (1919) "
929,20," The same result is achieved under the rule of reason analysis. Contrary to defendant's suggestion, group boycotts are not 
always illegal per se. The Court of Appeals has stated that if concerted conduct is ""not designed to drive out competitors, but to 
achieve some other goal,"" application of the rule of reason is appropriate.  Indiana Fed. of Dentists v. Federal Trade Comm., 745 
F.2d 1124, 1132 n. 8 (7th Cir. 1984). See also Phil Tolkan Datsun, 672 F.2d at 1286. Here, there is no evidence to suggest that 
Poff and Patel sought to drive defendant out of business. They simply treated him like the non-dealer he was. Under the rule of 
reason, it is necessary to show ""anticompetitive effects, or actual harm to competition . . ."" Id. It is settled that there is no 
anticompetitive effect when a seller simply terminates an at-will contract with one buyer and enters into a similar contract with 
another buyer. See Union City Body, 791 F.2d at 539. In the instant case it is an exaggeration even to characterize defendant's 
relationship with Patel or Poff as an at-will contract. Further, as previously noted, Poff never refused to sell to defendant; 
defendant stopped buying from Poff and purchased from an underground wholesaler from whom he apparently obtained 
cleaners at a more favorable price. Cf.  United States v. General Motors Corp., 384 U.S. 127 (1966). Under these circumstances 
it is difficult to find any harm to competition in Patel and Poff's actions."
929,21," Although in his brief defendant presents an attempt to monopolize argument, that claim has not been pleaded and I do not 
consider it."
929,22," HN5[
] Monopoly is defined as the power to control prices or exclude competition in the relevant market.  United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 570-71 (1966). Peterson's claim is that the monopoly here is in KIRBY vacuum cleaners--KIRBY's 
own product. This presents fundamental conceptual problems at the outset in light of the Supreme Court's landmark decision in 
United States v. E. I. DuPont DeNemours & Co., 351 U.S. 377, 393 (1956). The court stated: Thus one can theorize that we have monopolistic competition in every nonstandardized commodity with each manufacturer 
having power over the price and production of his own product. [footnote omitted] However, this power that, let us say, 
automobile or soft-drink manufacturers have over their trademarked products is not the power that makes an illegal monopoly. 
Illegal power must be appraised in terms of the competitive market for the product. [footnote omitted] "
930,23," Neither party has cited any Wisconsin cases with respect to the interpretation of ยง 133.04(1), and it appears that the 
Wisconsin courts have not had occasion to consider it. But see OB-GYN Assoc. of Neenah v. Landig, 129 Wis.2d 362, 368, 384 
NW2d 719 (1986) (citing statute for comparison purposes). In light of Wisconsin's consistent reliance on federal precedent in 
antitrust matters, City of Madison v. Hyland, Hall & Co., 73 Wis.2d 364, 375, 243 NW2d 422 (1976), I will also apply federal 
precedent to defendant's price discrimination claim under ยง 133.04(1). "
931,24," It appears that defendant recognizes the infirmity of his Fair Dealership claim against Patel, as his brief advances no argument 
in opposition to Patel's motion for summary judgment on this claim."
931,25," I am not persuaded by defendant's argument that KIRBY is a grantor of Area Distributor Agreements because it retains the 
right to approve the distributors' appointments. The reservation of a manufacturer's right to approve persons who will ultimately 
be associated with the sale and service of its products is not inappropriate, particularly in light of KIRBY's in-home marketing 
strategy and its expressed concern about maintaining lawful and ethical selling practices. KIRBY also has a legitimate interest, 
for example, in determining whether appointees have been charged with fraud, theft, or other offenses, civil or criminal, which "
932,," might be injurious to the customer or the good of the company. In any event, the reservation of the right to approve area 
distributors does not create any obligations as between KIRBY and those individuals. "
933,26," In his brief, defendant argues that various portions of the deposition testimony of KIRBY divisional supervisor Gene Windfeldt 
support his position. I find nothing in Mr. Windfeldt's testimony to contradict the conclusion that KIRBY markets its products door-
to-door."
933,27," Defendant's yellow page advertisement in 1985 shows that he represented several vacuum cleaner manufacturers at that 
time, so that a storefront operation may have been more suitable to his purposes. (Ex. 43 to Third-Party Compl.) It is also of 
importance that after 1980 defendant had no contract with any distributor and was not, therefore, answerable to anyone with 
regard to the observance of KIRBY's prescribed sales methods. "
935,1," In any event, plaintiff did not inform this court, by affidavit or otherwise, of the nature of the information it had sought (or 
intended to seek), or of the reasons the information had not yet been obtained. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f); Koplove v. Ford Motor 
Co., 795 F.2d 15 (3d Cir. 1986); Mid-South Grizzlies v. National Football League, 720 F.2d 772, 779 (3d Cir. 1983)."
935,2," ""The boundaries of such a submarket may be determined by examining such practical indicia as industry or public recognition 
of the submarket as a separate economic entity, a product's peculiar characteristics and uses, unique production facilities, 
distinct customers, distinct prices, sensitivity to price changes and specialized vendors."" 370 U.S. at 325. "
936,3," Stated another way, ""[i]n determining what constitutes a relevant market for antitrust purposes, the goal is to 'delineate markets 
which conform to areas of effective competition and to the realities of competitive practice.'"" Sargent-Welch Scientific Co. v. 
Ventron Corp., 567 F.2d 701, 710 (7th Cir. 1977)."
936,4," For cases rejecting the notion that a market or submarket may be defined solely in terms of style or brand preferences, see, 
e.g., United States v. DuPont, 351 U.S. 377, 394-95 (1956); Mogul v. General Motors Corp., 391 F. Supp. 1305, 1313 (E.D. Pa. 
1975); Car-Freshner Corp. v. Auto Aid Manufacturing Corp., 438 F. Supp. 82, 87 (N.D. N.Y. 1977)."
936,5," ""The outer boundaries of a product market are determined by the reasonable interchangeability of use or the cross-elasticity of 
demand between the product itself and substitutes for it."" Brown Shoe, 370 U.S. at 325."
936,6," We reiterate that although a rounded watch face may have certain functional characteristics, the submarket proposed by 
plaintiff is defined by the pairing of that watch face with a particular style of metal bracelet. Plaintiff neither presented evidence 
nor argued that the bracelet or the pairing of watch face and bracelet has distinctive functional characteristics. "
943,1," In September, 1979, Northern Propane's then-parent company, InterNorth, Inc. (""InterNorth""), purchased the retail propane 
outlet in Camilla from Amoco Oil. InterNorth employed Northern Propane, a wholly-owned subsidiary, to operate its retail 
propane outlets in the United States. On November 30, 1983, InterNorth sold all its stock in Northern Propane to Penn Central 
Energy Group."
943,2," Defendant had filed a counterclaim against plaintiff, alleging that he breached his fiduciary duties while under its employ. 
Specifically, defendant alleged that plaintiff engaged in self-dealing by extending credit to a corporation in which he had a 
financial interest, McGahee Family, Inc. In addition to the alleged conflict of interest, the counterclaim asserted that plaintiff's 
allocation of credit to McGahee Family, Inc. was wrongful because the corporation was not credit-worthy.  Defendant voluntarily 
dismissed the counterclaim on February 25, 1985. "
944,3," For the purposes of the instant motion, defendant conceded that the relevant product market is propane and that the relevant 
geographic market is Mitchell and Baker counties in the southwestern region of Georgia. The Court notes, however, that there 
are some difficulties with plaintiff's asserted relevant geographic market. The cost of transportation limits the range in which a 
retail propane seller can operate profitably, but there is evidence that propane distributors who were active in Mitchell and Baker 
counties were also active in neighboring counties. On the other hand, even though other fuels may substitute for propane, there 
is, at the very least, an issue of fact as to whether propane constitutes a distinct product market. See United States v. Empire 
Gas Corp., 537 F.2d 296, 303-304 (8th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 1122, 51 L. Ed. 2d 572, 97 S. Ct. 1158 (1977)."
944,4," HN3[
] Section 2 of the Sherman Act provides the following: Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to 
monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of 
a misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding fifty thousand dollars, or by 
imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court. "
945,5," Most Circuits have followed some adaptation of the cost-based analysis first advocated by Professors Areeda and Turner in 
their landmark article, Areeda & Turner, Predatory Pricing and Related Practices Under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 88 
Harv.L.Rev. 697 (1975). See, e.g., Chillicothe Sand & Gravel Co. v. Martin Marietta Corp., 615 F.2d 427 (7th Cir. 1980); AT & T 
v. FCC, 602 F.2d 401, 410 n.49 (D.C. Cir. 1979); Pacific Engineering & Production Co. of Nevada v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 551 
F.2d 790, 797 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 879, 54 L. Ed. 2d 160, 98 S. Ct. 234 (1977); International Air Industries v. 
American Excelsior Co., 517 F.2d 714 (5th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 943, 47 L. Ed. 2d 349, 96 S. Ct. 1411 (1976). The 
Supreme Court has also indicated a preference for cost-based analysis over traditional notions of intent. See Matsushita Electric 
Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 1355 n.8, n.9, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). In the instant case, plaintiff advocates a test relying on traditional notions of intent and long-term cost analysis. Defendant 
argues that the Court is bound by the modified Areeda/Turner test employed by the former Fifth Circuit in International Air, 517 
F.2d at 724. As developed further in the text below, see infra slip op. at 10-12, International Air may well be dispositive, binding 
precedent; moreover, the Court concludes that the approach followed in International Air is the most sound."
945,6," As Professor Williamson has explained, To be sure, HN7[
] the demise of any firm has painful consequences for the affected employees and investors. Seen in a 
broader context, however, the elimination of inefficiency is a leading benefit of competition. It is crucial to make the 
distinction between protecting competitors and protecting competition. Sentiment is a cruel hoax if it leads to protecting 
competitors, since the consumer is invariably the loser when such rules are introduced. Williamson, Predatory Pricing: A 
Strategic and Welfare Analysis, 87 Yale L.J. 284, 288-89 (1977). "
946,7," HN10[
] Average variable cost is the sum of all costs that vary according to output divided by the output. It is employed as a 
surrogate for a more instructive measure, marginal cost, which is the increase to total cost resulting from each additional 
increment of output. This substitution is necessary because marginal costs are difficult to ascertain and is acceptable because 
marginal cost will exceed average variable cost only when a firm approaches its maximum output, an unlikely time for predation. 
See International Air Industries v. American Excelsior Co., 517 F.2d 714, 724 n.28 (5th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 943, 47 
L. Ed. 2d 349, 96 S. Ct. 1411 (1976)."
946,8," The International Air Court was concerned that its preferred view would run counter to the Supreme Court's holding in Utah Pie 
Co. v. Continental Baking Co., 386 U.S. 685, 18 L. Ed. 2d 406, 87 S. Ct. 1326 (1967). See 517 F.2d at 724 n.30. Matsushita "
947,," Electric Industries Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 1355 n.8, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986), indicates that 
Utah Pie does not resolve the ""debate . . .  about what 'cost' is relevant in [predatory pricing] cases."" Thus, Matsushita suggests 
International Air should be read for the broader of its two plausible holdings."
947,9," Plaintiff criticizes the Areeda-Turner approach on the grounds that it relies on a static economic analysis devoid of strategic 
considerations. See Williamson, Predatory Pricing: A Strategic Welfare Analysis, 87 Yale L.J. 284 (1977). He advocates a test 
relying on long-run incremental cost and traditional notions of intent. Over the short run, the AVC rule encourages the most efficient use of economic resources. The rules advocated by plaintiff are 
more difficult to apply and less likely to yield an efficient economy. See International Air Industries v. American Excelsior Co., 
517 F.2d 714, 724 (5th Cir. 1975), cert.  denied, 424 U.S. 943, 47 L. Ed. 2d 349, 96 S. Ct. 1411 (1976). Plaintiff's proposed rules 
might be justified if predatory pricing were a serious problem, but, as noted above, see supra slip op. at 7-8, it is not. Thus, in the 
Court's view, the entry barrier gloss added by International Air is sufficient to prevent the limited practical potential for the 
strategic use of above variable cost pricing."
947,10," It must be remembered that HN14[
] entry barriers must be ""extremely high"" for the profit maximizing standard to be 
applicable.  International Air Industries v. American Excelsior Co., 517 F.2d 714, 724 n.31 (5th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 
943, 47 L. Ed. 2d 349, 96 S. Ct. 1411 (1976). "
948,11," Plaintiff's challenges to Gower's affidavits are not without force.  For example, plaintiff points out that Gower did not include 
wages as a variable cost. In the abstract, it is certainly debatable that wages qualify as a variable cost, and an issue of fact can 
exist as to whether certain costs are variable or fixed. See Adjusters Replace-A-Car v. Agency Rent-A-Car, Inc., 735 F.2d 884, 
891 n.6 (5th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1160, 83 L. Ed. 2d 924, 105 S. Ct. 910 (1985). Gower has, however, offered a 
reasonable explanation for his approach. See Affidavit of Hugh A.  Gower at para. 16. (""Northern Propane had excess capacity 
and could have sold a significant number of additional gallons of propane gas without hiring additional employees. . . ."") And 
plaintiff has neither refuted this explanation nor submitted any contrary expert testimony. The Court also notes that Gower 
defined several arguably fixed costs as variable. Id. at P 24, Exhibit B and Exhibit B-1. Thus, it would be proper to conclude that Gower's testimony negated plaintiff's claim. In other words, defendant's showing 
exceeded the burden imposed by Rule 56. It bears emphasizing once again that defendant was not required to affirmatively 
rebut plaintiff's theory. Under the Supreme Court's recent pronouncements on summary judgment, merely pointing out that 
plaintiff's claim lacked factual support shifted to plaintiff the burden of producing some evidence of sales under defendant's AVC. 
See supra slip op. at 3-4.  Despite ample discovery, plaintiff failed to satisfy that burden."
948,12," As noted above, see supra at note 3, no propane dealer confined its operations to Mitchell and Baker counties. In fact, the 
parties competed with eight other propane retailers in a nine-county area. "
949,13," The Court acknowledges that new market participants might be deterred because the relevant market was stagnant. By the 
same token, the limited potential for market growth made it less likely defendant could hope to reap significant benefits from its 
alleged predatory conduct."
949,14," In pertinent part, HN16[
] the Robinson-Patman Act provides as follows: It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, either directly or indirectly, to 
discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality, where either or any of the 
purchases involved in each discrimination are in commerce, where such commodities are sold for use, consumption, or 
resale within the United States or any Territory thereof or the District of Columbia or any insular possession or other place 
under the jurisdiction of the United States, and where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen 
competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any 
person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them. . . . "
952,1," The complaint alleges that Jamesway is a New Jersey corporation.  Plaintiff concedes in his opposition papers that Jamesway 
is, in fact, a New York corporation. Accordingly, plaintiff withdraws his allegation that the Court has diversity jurisdiction over his 
state law claims and concedes that, if the federal antitrust claims are dismissed, he would have to pursue this action in state 
court. "
958,1," Section 10 is here set out in its entirety: HN2[
] Purchases by common carrier in case of interlocking directorates, etc. No common carrier engaged in commerce shall have any dealings in securities, supplies, or other articles of commerce, or shall 
make or have any contracts for construction or maintenance of any kind, to the amount of more than $ 50,000, in the aggregate, 
in any one year, with another corporation, firm, partnership, or association when the said common carrier shall have upon its 
board of directors or as its president, manager, or as its purchasing or selling officer, or agent in the particular transaction, any 
person who is at the same time a director, manager, or purchasing or selling officer of, or who has any substantial interest in, 
such other corporation, firm, partnership, or association, unless and except such purchases shall be made from, or such 
dealings shall be with, the bidder whose bid is the most favorable to such common carrier, to be ascertained by competitive 
bidding under regulations to be prescribed by rule or otherwise by the Interstate Commerce Commission. No bid shall be 
received unless the name and address of the bidder or the names and addresses of the officers, directors, and general 
managers thereof, if the bidder be a corporation, or of the members, if it be a partnership or firm, be given with the bid. HN3[
] Any person who shall, directly or indirectly, do or attempt to do anything to prevent anyone from bidding, or shall do any 
act to prevent free and fair competition among the bidders or those desiring to bid, shall be punished as prescribed in this 
section in the case of an officer or director. "
959,," Every such common carrier having any such transactions or making any such purchases shall, within thirty days after making 
the same, file with the Interstate Commerce Commission a full and detailed statement of the transaction showing the manner of 
the competitive bidding, who were the bidders, and the names and addresses of the directors and officers of the corporations 
and the members of the firm or partnership bidding; and whenever the said commission shall, after investigation or hearing, have 
reason to believe that the law has been violated in and about the said purchases or transactions, it shall transmit all papers and 
documents and its own views or findings regarding the transaction to the Attorney General. HN4[
] If any common carrier shall violate this section, it shall be fined not exceeding $ 25,000; and every such director, agent, 
manager, or officer thereof who shall have knowingly voted for or directed the act constituting such violation, or who shall have 
aided or abetted in such violation, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be fined not exceeding $ 5,000 or confined 
in jail not exceeding one year, or both, in the discretion of the court."
959,15, U.S.C. ยง 20 (1982). 
961,2," Chief Judge Lumbard found that the transaction came within Section 10 and that B&O violated a duty imposed by the statute, 
but concluded that B&O was not liable because it had sustained its burden at trial of showing that Reading suffered no injury in 
fact caused by the absence of competitive bidding. Klinger, 432 F.2d at 508-16. Judge Friendly, concurring, agreed that plaintiffs 
had failed to establish injury, but differed with the Chief Judge as to Section 10's application to the particular facts of the case.  
Id. at 516-19. Judge Friendly characterized Section 10 as ""a narrowly drawn statute designed to meet a particular set of 
experienced evils,"" id. at 516, and stated that ""[a] court should not apply a prohibitory statute in a manner that would make it a 
trap for persons who have been dealing in good faith,"" id. at 517. Judge Friendly did not, however, reach the question of the 
statute's application to parties other than the carrier. His specific concerns were (1) that the statute's reference to ""securities"" 
was limited to the sale of a carrier's own securities and (2) that ""Congress did not mean to require competitive bidding in the 
case of 'securities' which represented a share in a joint venture with an affiliated railroad and by their very nature could not be 
expected to elicit a substantial competitive bid."" Id. at 518. Judge Hays, dissenting, agreed with the Chief Judge that ""B&O 
violated a duty imposed upon it by Section 10 when it purchased Reading's interest in the terminal land and facilities without 
competitive bidding,"" id. at 519, but went beyond his brethren in finding that injury had been shown at trial, id. at 520-21. "
962,3," Although the district court made these findings, it did not determine -- after a trial -- that B&O engaged in any intentional 
overreaching of Reading. Rather, Judge Tyler concluded that Section 10 is a malum prohibitum statute, Klinger, 302 F. Supp. at 
825 n.9, and that a corporation can violate its second paragraph (which prohibits interference with competitive bidding) simply by 
engaging with a carrier in a transaction which is not the product of such bidding procedures, id. at 825. "

963,7," Defendants have submitted an affidavit by their attorney, Edward N.  Costikyan, which contains a detailed discussion of SPTC's 
specialized rail needs, its program of testing new types of rail available from foreign and domestic suppliers during the period in 
question, the reasons for SPTC's practice of purchasing rail on an ""as needed"" basis, and the difficulties encountered in making 
such purchases from foreign suppliers. Affidavit of Edward N. Costikyan at 6-12 & Exhibit A (Feb. 7, 1986). This portion of the 
Costikyan affidavit states that it is ""based upon interviews . . .  conducted with former purchasing officers of the Railroad, as 
confirmed and supplemented by attorneys for Southern Pacific,"" id. at 5. Plaintiffs point out that the Costikyan affidavit is not in accord with the prescription in Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e) that ""affidavits shall be 
made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the 
affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein."" However, even if only plaintiffs' evidence were before the court on 
this motion, it would still, by its general and anecdotal nature, leave the question of actual injury unsettled. Moreover, any 
infirmity in defendants' principal affidavit opposing the motion for summary judgment is of less concern at this point in the 
litigation, where there has been no discovery on the issue of whether foreign suppliers could have met SPTC's needs during the 
relevant period. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f). "

987,3," Since we affirm the entry of JNOV, we need not reach the district court's alternative grant of a new trial. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 
50(c)(1) (providing for conditional ruling on grant of new trial). Nor is it necessary for us to review the adequacy of the award of 
attorney's fees. Although we do reverse the grant of summary judgment on the RICO claims, we are unable to reach the 
borrowers' assertion of error in the district court's refusal to certify a class action. That issue need not be decided because 
""orders regarding certification and decertification of class actions should not be reviewed by this court when the judgment 
pursuant to which appeal was taken is reversed or vacated and the case remanded."" Weil v. Investment/Indicators, Research & 
Management, Inc., 647 F.2d 18, 27 (9th Cir. 1981). See also Alaska v. Chevron Chem. Co., 669 F.2d 1299, 1303 n.8 (9th Cir. 
1982) (to decide class certification issue on appeal when judgment is reversed is to rule impermissibly on an interlocutory order). "
990,4," A participation loan is an arrangement by which outside banks (participating banks) purchase portions of a loan extended by 
another bank (the lead bank). Participation loans are usually created when a single bank has exceeded its lending limits as 
imposed by state law or in-house rules. The interest rate applicable to a participation loan is generally negotiated individually by 
the lending bank and the borrower. "
991,5," These sections prohibit: HN6[
] (a) . . . any person who has received any income derived, directly or indirectly, from a pattern of racketeering 
activity or through collection of an unlawful debt in which such person has participated as a principal within the meaning of 
section 2, title 18, United States Code, [18 U.S.C. ยง 2] to use or invest, directly or indirectly, any part of such income, or the 
proceeds of such income, in acquisition of any interest in, or the establishment or operation of, any enterprise which is 
engaged in, or the activities of which affect interstate or foreign commerce. (c) . . . any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or 
foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a 
pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt. (d) . . . any person to conspire to violate any of the provisions 
of subsections (a), (b), or (c) of this section."

993,6," There is judicial support for the bank's position. See, e.g., HMK Corp. v. Walsey, 637 F. Supp. 710, 714 n.5 (E.D. Va. 1986) 
(""case law abounds with decisions under RICO granting preclusive effect to prior judgments""). In Brannan v. Eisenstein, 804 
F.2d 1041, 1047 (8th Cir. 1986), the court, affirming the dismissal of a RICO action, reasoned that since it ""affirmed the dismissal 
of the securities fraud claims, the same conduct cannot constitute a fraudulent scheme giving rise to a wire fraud claim."" See 
also Greenblatt v. Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., 763 F.2d 1352, 1362 (11th Cir. 1985) (arbitral decision, though not containing 
specific factual findings, demonstrated that the plaintiff would not be able to prove predicate acts necessary to support a RICO 
violation); Moss v. Morgan Stanley Inc., 719 F.2d 5, 19-20 (2d Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1025, 79 L. Ed. 2d 684, 104 S. 
Ct. 1280 (1984) (dismissal of securities fraud claim undercuts the existence of racketeering activity so that dismissal of RICO 
claim was justified); Berns v. O'Dell, 563 F. Supp. 1201, 1203 (E.D. Mo. 1983) (RICO claim based on mail fraud was precluded 
by a prior adverse jury verdict on claims of securities fraud and common law fraud arising out of the same operative facts), aff'd 
per curiam, 726 F.2d 409 (8th Cir. 1984). Similarly, in County of Cook v. Midcon Corp., 773 F.2d 892, 898 (7th Cir. 1985), the 
court affirmed the dismissal of a RICO action on collateral estoppel grounds because ""the propriety of each element of the 
alleged scheme to defraud was previously decided in the state court. . . ."" Given the explicit findings by the state judge, ""all the 
essential features of the alleged scheme to defraud were already considered, and found to be without merit. . . ."" Id. at 899-900."
993,7," The elements of common law fraud are (1) a representation; (2) its falsity; (3) its materiality; (4) the speaker's knowledge of its 
falsity or ignorance of its truth; (5) an intent that it be acted on by the person and in the manner reasonably contemplated; (6) the 
hearer's ignorance of its falsity; (7) reliance on its truth; (8) the right to rely thereon; and (9) consequent and proximate injury.  
Rice v. McAlister, 268 Ore. 125, 128, 519 P.2d 1263, 1265 (1974). In comparison, the elements of a violation of section 1962(c) 
are (1) conduct; (2) of an enterprise; (3) through a pattern; (4) of racketeering activity. Sedima, 105 S. Ct. at 3285. A plaintiff has 
standing only if he or she can show an injury to business or property by the conduct constituting the violation. Id. at 3285-86. In 
addition, the plaintiff must also prove the elements of the predicate act. See Durante Bros. & Sons v. Flushing Nat'l Bank, 755 
F.2d 239, 248 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 473 U.S. 906, 105 S. Ct. 3530, 87 L. Ed. 2d 654 (1985); Moss v. Morgan Stanley Inc., 719

Von Bulow, 634 F. Supp. 1284, 1304 (S.D.N.Y. 1986). Few cases, however, specifically compare the elements of a civil RICO claim with any common law cause of action. In Travelers 
Indem. Co. v. Sarkisian, 794 F.2d 754, 761 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 885, 107 S. Ct. 277, 93 L. Ed. 2d 253 (1986), the 
court, reviewing a dismissal on res judicata grounds, concluded that ""the elements of the state law claims [fraudulent 
conveyances and unlawful payments of dividends and salary] are not virtually identical to those previously pled under RICO."" 
(footnote omitted). See also Malley-Duff & Assocs v. Crown Life Ins. Co., 792 F.2d 341, 347-48 (3rd Cir.) (civil RICO is ""far 
removed"" from any traditional state action for purposes of borrowing state statute of limitations), cert. granted, 479 U.S. 983, 107

Ralston v. Capper, 569 F. Supp. 1575, 1580 (E.D. Mich. 1983) (RICO ""fraud"" claim is not identical to a state common law fraud 
claim). Similarly, in Armco, 782 F.2d at 482, the Fifth Circuit held that the elements necessary to support damages under civil 
RICO are different from state causes of action, including common law fraud. The difference is that ""justifiable reliance is not an 
element that need be proven to establish a mail fraud violation."" Id. "
995,1," Private claimants alleging fraud in the sale of securities must establish their case by a preponderance of the evidence. See 
Herman & MacLean v. Huddleston, 459 U.S. 375, 387-91, 74 L. Ed. 2d 548, 103 S. Ct. 683 (1983). Creditors alleging that a 
debtor should not be granted a discharge because of fraud must prove the fraud by clear and convincing evidence in some 
courts, see, e.g., In re Hames (Northern State Bank v. Hames), 53 Bankr. 868, 871 (D. Minn. 1985); by a ""fair preponderance"" of 
the evidence in some, see, e.g., In re Carr (McReynolds v. Carr), 49 Bankr. 208, 210 (W.D. Ky. 1985); and by a preponderance 
in others, see, e.g., Farmers Co-op. Ass'n v. Strunk, 671 F.2d 391, 395 (10th Cir. 1982). Other than in the context of RICO,

1002,2," The court in Hendrix appears to overlook that all declaratory judgments will be in some sense hypothetical, since they are 
premised on the understanding that the prospective plaintiff has not yet filed suit and the prospective defendant wishes to 
determine his or her liability. The issue is not whether the requested declaratory relief is hypothetical. Rather, the issue is 
whether the case presents a sufficiently concrete case and controversy upon which relief properly may be fashioned. "

1012,*," The Honorable Jean S. Breitenstein, United States Circuit Judge, heard oral argument in this case but did not participate in the 
final decision."
1012,1," ISDC originally claimed against Aetna individually under section 2 of the Sherman Act, and against both defendants under the 
Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. ยงยง 13-13b, 21a (1982). The court denied Aetna's motion for summary judgment on the claims 
under section 2 and the Robinson-Patman Act. After the court refused ISDC's motion for an interlocutory appeal of the partial 
summary judgment in favor of Aetna and Doron, ISDC dismissed its remaining claims against Aetna. ISDC had earlier withdrawn 
its Robinson-Patman claims against Doron. "
1013,2," The agreement did not constitute a true joint venture. One authority has defined HN2[
] a joint venture for antitrust purposes 
as ""an integration of operations between two or more separate firms, in which the following conditions are present: (1) the 
enterprise is under the joint control of the parent firms, which are not under related control; (2) each parent makes 
substantial contribution to the joint enterprise; (3) the enterprise exists as a business entity separate from its parents; and 
(4) the joint venture creates significant new enterprise capability in terms of new productive capacity, new technology, a 
new product, or entry into a new market.""  J. Brodley, Joint Ventures and Antitrust Policy, 95 Harv. L. Rev. 1523, 1526 (1982) (footnote omitted). The agreement between 
Aetna and Doron did not meet this test. "
1016,3," Because the alleged conspiracy involved conduct both pursuant to and outside the contract, the legality of the agreement itself 
is not determinative. "
1017,4," HN11[
] Whether a particular employee's intent may be attributable to the company depends on the employee's role in the 
decisional process of the company. VII P. Areeda, Antitrust Law para. 1506 (1986). Bart testified that he reported to Doron's 
president."
1017,5," In addition to the contract itself, the joint film curriculum, and the reference of overseas sales discussed in part IIA supra, we 
note evidence that Aetna, for example, sought and agreed to suggestions from Doron's president which resulted in unfavorable 
changes in the film purchasing agreement between Aetna and ISDC.  Cf.  Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U.S. 
752, 104 S. Ct. 1464, 1471, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775 (1984)."
1017,6," The district court did not consider whether the evidence tended to show that Doron possessed monopoly power in the relevant 
market. ISDC presented evidence that Doron possessed at least 80% of the market in simulator hardware during the relevant 
period, and that the driving simulator system was a unique driver education tool offering advantages not found in other driver 
teaching methods.  This evidence is sufficient to create a fact question on Doron's possession of monopoly power. "
1018,7," On rehearing, Doron contends that it is entitled to judgment on this claim as a matter of law under Pacific Engineering because 
it presented undisputed evidence of excess capacity. The evidence Doran points to is in an affidavit of Doron's president filed in 
support of a motion for summary judgment. Doron did not rely on the assertion of excess capacity to support its motion for 
summary judgment, however, so ISDC was not required to rebut that evidence. Nor did the trial judge rely on excess capacity in 
granting summary judgment. Although excess capacity is a relevant factor to be considered, see Pacific Engineering, 551 F.2d 
at 796-97, consideration of its existence and importance in this case must be left for the trial court on remand."
1018,8," The district court rejected Dr. Bates' conclusion that Doron sold below its total cost, taking issue with his method of arriving at 
that conclusion and stating that ISDC had conceded at a pre-trial conference that Dr. Bates' approach was erroneous. We have 
examined the transcript of that hearing and we find no such concession by ISDC. To the contrary, ISDC argued that Dr. Bates' 
method was proper. See rec., vol. XVIII, at 4323-24. HN14[
] Although the criticisms voiced by the court may go to the weight a 
fact finder would give Dr. Bates' testimony, they do not render it without any evidentiary value as a matter of law. "
1022,1," The Second Amended Complaint defines ""radiology"" as ""the medical specialty concerned with the diagnostic and therapeutic 
use of x-rays, radium rays and other forms of radiant energy or its equivalent, in the diagnosis and treatment of disease or 
injury."" "
1023,2," Empire explains that: In 1969, however, the New York Legislature became convinced that retrospective reimbursement failed to encourage the 
hospitals to control their costs, which were increasing at an alarming rate. As a result, the Legislature revised Chapter 28 of 
the Public Health Law, which set forth the procedure for determining hospital reimbursement, and directed the 
Commissioner of Health to develop an ""effective cost control program"" that would ""both enable and motivate hospitals to 
control their spiraling costs"" (Chapter 957, 1969 N.Y. laws). Given this mandate, the Commissioner developed regulations, 
now codified as NYCRR ยง 86-1.1, et seq. (the ""Regulations"" or ""Part 86""), that established the system of ""prospective"" 
reimbursement that remains in use in New York State. Instead of paying the hospital for the charges for all items of care rendered to each individual patient, under a prospective 
methodology Blue Cross pays a set amount to the hospital for each ""patient day"" of care rendered to a person with Blue 
Cross hospital coverage. That amount, referred to as the ""per diem reimbursement rate"" in paragraph 12 of the Complaint, 
is established annually for each Downstate Hospital on the basis of financial data it supplies and is provided to each 
hospital in advance of the rate year so that each may have an opportunity to plan its budget accordingly. If, during the rate 
year, a hospital's cost of providing care is less than the per diem, the hospital retains the difference. If the cost of care is 
greater than the payment rate, the hospital absorbs the difference. Thus, prospective reimbursement gives the hospitals an 
incentive to reduce waste and to make their own operations more efficient. "
1028,1," According to the Official Statement distributed to the public investors various participating financial institutions and savings and 
loan associations had binding contracts with SISCorp to fulfill the obligation undertaken by SISCorp. It is also alleged that 
Namer, and Bruce Wright (""Wright""), who was president of SISCorp, made representations to the Heitner defendants, defendant 
City of Provo and the Provo Excelsior Parties that binding ""participation agreements"" had in fact been signed by SISCorp and 
various financial institutions. "

1030,4, See cases cited supra note 1.
1030,5," See also In re Wicat Securities Litigation, 600 F. Supp. 1236 (D.  Utah 1984). In Wicat Judge Winder of this court adopted a 
test said to be in the middle of the spectrum: ""Some direct participation in the sale between underwriter and buyer must be 
alleged in order to state a ยง 12(2) claim. Other than this narrow holding, this court will not attempt to plumb the depths of the 
'substantial factor' standard of liability."" Id. at 1242. Judge Winder recognized that the concepts of ""control, agency, or direct "
1031,," participation in the sale . . ."" are available to extend ยง 12(2) to a class of persons beyond those in direct privity, leaving open 
possible expansion of those concepts in future cases.  Id. at 1240. "
1032,6," One court has concluded that if all the elements for aiding and abetting a violation of ยง 12(2) are proven the defendant would 
necessarily be liable for a primary violation under ยง 10(b) and therefore it is redundant to recognize the aiding and abetting 
claim.  Hackett v. Village Court Associates, 602 F. Supp. 856, 859 (E.D. Wis. 1985). Although that will be the case in many 
situations there may be factual situations where a primary violation of ยง 10(b) would not be present, and for that reason we 
consider that aiding and abetting ยง 12(2) claims should not be foreclosed. "
1033,7," The FSLIC's ability to foreclose on the property appears to be governed by Paragraph 9.03 of the Indenture of Trust which 
provides: Rights and Remedies of Bondholders. No owner of any bond shall have any right to institute any suit, action or proceeding 
at law or in equity for the enforcement of this Indenture or for the execution of any trust hereof . . . unless (i) a Default has 
occurred of which Trustee has been notified . . . or of which . . . it is claimed to have notice, (ii) owners of not less than 
twenty-five percent (25%) in aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Bonds shall have made written request to Trustee . 
. . and they have offered to Trustee indemnity as provided in Section 10.01(1), and (iii) Trustee shall thereafter fail or refuse 
to exercise the powers hereinbefore granted, or to institute such action, suit or proceeding in its own name within a 
reasonable time. Such notification, request and offer of indemnity are hereby declared in every case at the option of 
Trustee to be considered conditions precedent to the executions of the powers of trusts of this Indenture, and to any action 
or cause of action for the enforcement of this Indenture . . . it being understood and intended that no one or more owners of 
the Bonds shall have any right in any manner whatsoever to affect, disturb or prejudice the lien of this Indenture by its, his, 
her or their action or to enforce any right hereunder except in the manner herein provided, and that all proceedings at law or 
in equity shall be instituted, had and maintained in the manner herein provided for the equal and ratable benefit of the 
owners of all Outstanding Bonds."
1033,8," In Weir the plaintiff and defendant Bauer were the sole bondholders and sole shareholders of the defendant corporation. Bauer 
had a majority of the bonds and shares and served as president of the corporation. The Utah court recognized that Bauer 
controlled whether the corporation paid interest on the bonds or dividends on the stock. In those circumstances the court 
determined that the provision in the trust deed requiring a majority demand upon the trustee for foreclosure was not one where such restrictive provision . . . is to be given effect for the better protection and security of all outstanding 
bondholders, but one where the provision is resorted to and asked to be given effect for the gain and advantage of the 
majority holders and to the prejudice and injury of the minority. Id. at 944."
1033,9," Mercantile does not deny that it has taken a position adverse to the Series B bondholders but it distinguishes Weir on the basis 
that here there are more than two bondholders and it is not futile for the FSLIC to seek the support of those bondholders and 
comply with the express condition precedent of the Indenture of Trust. Mercantile also points out that the disposition of any 
proceeds realized from a foreclosure sale is a separate issue from the foreclosure itself. Mercantile argues that its decision not 
to foreclose at this time is not based upon hostility towards the Series B bondholders but upon ""considered judgment that a 
voluntary sale of an ongoing business is likely to bring a higher price for the bondholders than the forced sale of a closed 
building."" "
1035,10, See Id. at 1215-22.
1035,11," Prior to the 1983 amendment to ยง 1729(d) the statute provided that FSLIC's power to settle, compromise or release was 
subject to regulation ""of the court or other public authority having jurisdiction over the matter."" It would appear by negative 
implication that the change made clear that in its role as receiver in the settlement and compromise arena, FSLIC is wholly 
unfettered and not subject to regulation by the courts or any other public authority. That does not suggest to this court that where 
such claims are sought to be adjudicated rather than settled, compromised or released FSLIC becomes an adjudicatory body. 
To the contrary, it would appear that it continues to be subject to the plenary power of the court in adjudicatory matters. In all 
events we consider that to be so where, as here, FSLIC take an aggressive position as plaintiff or counterclaimant in litigation. "
1036,12," 811 F.2d at 1219-21. The court pointed out after a discussion of these statutes that Congress when granting exclusive 
adjudicatory powers has been express and detailed in its statutory language."

1037,14," A number of courts have focused upon the commercial versus investment distinction in determining whether a note transaction 
ought to come with the parameters of the securities laws or is better left to the operation of other regulatory laws. See Futura 
Development Corp. v. Centex Corp., 761 F.2d 33, 39-40 (1st Cir. 1985) (discussing the varying positions and tests of the circuit 
courts). The central focus under the commercial/investment test is ""the investor's dependency on the efforts of others and the 
investor's dependency upon financial disclosures provided by the other party."" Id. at 40-41. The factors considered in making the 
above determination are the size of the offering; necessary reliance on the issuer; the purpose of the issuer in execution the note 
and the payee accepting the note; the economic inducements held out to the prospect; the degree to which the profit on the note 
is in the hands of the maker rather than the payee; whether the object of the holder was to acquire an interest in the property or 
enterprise; whether the note was primarily commercial because it was serving as a ""cash substitute"" for the purchase price; and 
whether the return on the note was predetermined or could reasonably be anticipated, or was subject to the managerial efforts of 
the maker. Id. "
1038,15," See LTV Federal Credit Union v. UMIC Government Securities, Inc., 523 F. Supp. 819, 830 n.30 (N.D. Tx. 1981) (""[A] literal 
construction of Austin does not draw any distinction between commercial transactions and investment transactions. If Austin is 
correct that 'all contractual obligations to pay in the future for consideration presently received' are evidence of indebtedness; 
then all commercial notes are securities."""
1038,16," The third party defendants cite United States v. Namer, 680 F.2d 1088 (5th Cir. 1982) for the proposition that a loan 
commitment or standby commitment as is involved in this case is not a security. In that case the Fifth Circuit determined that 
clients came to defendant David Namer ""not with the expectation of profits, . . . but with hopes of obtaining fixed loan 
commitments."" The court also cited North American Intl Dev. Ltd. v. Allied Consultants, Inc., No. 77-C-3593, slip op. at 5-6 (N.D. 
Ill. Jan. 31, 1979) and described that case as a civil action against David Namer wherein the court relied on the Tenth Circuit's 
opinion in McGovern to conclude that loan commitments were not securities.  Namer, 680 F.2d at 1097 n. 18. There is 
insufficient description in United States v. Namer and North American Int'l Dev. Ltd. to determine whether the scheme alleged in 
either case is similar to that alleged here. In addition, the court in United States v. Namer concluded that the ""Tenth Circuit's 
decision in McGovern substantially narrowed that court's earlier decision in United States v. Austin . . . ."" 680 F.2d at 1096 n.16. 
While that statement may be true on its face, this court is compelled to follow the careful distinction drawn between the two 
cases as articulated by the Tenth Circuit in McGovern."
1038,17," The court notes that in McGovern the Tenth Circuit emphasized that ""whether a particular investment constitutes a security 
depends upon the facts and circumstances of the case."" 562 F.2d at 648 (quoting Vincent v. Moench, 473 F.2d 430, 435 (10th 
Cir. 1973)). However, the ruling here is based solely on the allegations in the complaint. When all of the facts and circumstances 
become clear the court may consider whether the distinction made in McGovern is still applicable. "
1039,18," In Grant v. Union Bank, 629 F. Supp. 570, 576 (D. Utah 1986) this court acknowledged that at a minimum the strict pleading 
requirements of Rule 9(b) of the Fed. R. Civ. P. must be met with regard to allegations of fraud in pleading a RICO claim. 
However, in the subsequent case of Huntsman-Christensen Corp. v. Mountain Fuel Supply Co., No. 86-C-530G, slip op. at 6-9 
(D. Utah Nov. 24, 1986), this court recognized that in special circumstances RICO claims may proceed even though not every 
allegation meets the strict requirements of Rule 9(b). In that case the complaint put the RICO defendants on notice so as to 
enable them fairly to understand and defend against such claims; a number of instances of predicate acts or transactions were 
alleged with a great deal of particularity; there was significant background information, including the relationship and affiliation of 
the various defendants; and whatever particularity was missing was peculiarly within the knowledge of the perpetrators of the 
fraud. The factors recognized in Huntsman-Christensen are present here as well."
1039,19," In Dominicus Americana Bohio v. Gulf & Western Industries, 473 F. Supp. 680, 693 (S.D.N.Y. 1979) the court recognized that 
the strict requirements of Rule 9(b) may be relaxed when the allegations relating to fraud allegedly were perpetrated by the 
defendant not upon the plaintiff but upon a third party. In such cases the court acknowledged that the circumstances surrounding 
the transaction are peculiarly within the defendant's knowledge and therefore the proper action is to deny the motion to strike the 
claims, without prejudice to renewal if plaintiffs are unable to support their claim after an opportunity for discovery. In Huntsman-
Christensen Corp. v. Mountain Fuel Supply Co., No. 86-C-530G, slip op. at 8 n.5 (D. Utah Nov. 24, 1986) this court accepted the 
principle of Dominicus but ordered the flip side relief by dismissing claims against particular plaintiffs without prejudice and with 
leave to amend. The reason for that ruling was that the motion went to particular defendants for which there was acute concern 
regarding damage to their reputations as a result of the allegations. This case fits within the Dominicus situation and on that 
basis is denied."
1039,20," The court said: ""Pattern of racketeering activity,"" then, is a design or arrangement of predicate acts which manifests both relatedness and 
continuity. This court conceives this to mean that in addition to the presence of design or arrangement there must be a 
separation in time and place of acts related to each other and/or the affairs of the Enterprise, and an ongoing or repetitive 
characteristic of such acts. The number of acts under RICO required to establish a civil cause of action is not set forth in the 
statute, but there must be ""at least two."" In a proper case it may be possible to demonstrate design and arrangement plus 
relatedness and continuity with just two acts, but depending on the predicate offense involved often more than two and 
perhaps many ""acts"" may be necessary. Id. at 1224. "

1040,24," In this regard third party defendants have cited Wood v. Santa Barbara Chamber of Commerce, 507 F. Supp. 1128, 1148 (D. 
Nevada 1980) wherein the court held that the extraterritorial service provided for in the antitrust law can be validly invoked only 
if venue is proper in the district where the suit is filed. See also First Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n of Pittsburg v. Oppenheim, Appel, 
Dixon & Co., 634 F. Supp. 1341, 1349 (S.D.  N.Y. 1986) (""Because the venue requirements of Section 27 [15 U.S.C. ยง 78aa] are "
1041,," inextricably intertwined with the statutory grant of personal jurisdiction . . . it follows that proper venue is a prerequisite to valid in

1108,5," Dear Pharmacist: As you know, INDERAL SM is the only brand of propranolol HC1 tablets indicated to reduce mortality post-MI. Recently, 
questions have been raised on the significance of this exclusive claim to practicing pharmacists, particularly as it relates to 
potential liability resulting from substitution on INDERAL prescriptions. Some generic manufacturers may tell you that the indication for which a drug is prescribed is confidential between the physician 
and patient. We feel that the pharmacist is an equal member of the health care team, a respected professional who shares in 
protecting the health of the patient. Therefore, a brief review of the implications of exclusive labeling is appropriate. The issue of possible liability associated with dispensing a generic drug for an indication not included in its labeling has not been 
resolved in the courts. It's not possible to determine, in advance, the outcome of a suit which may arise from such a situation. It 
is clear, however, that litigation is troublesome, expensive and will generate adverse publicity. Although some generic product 
manufacturers may be willing to indemnify for monetary rewards, no company could adequately compensate you for the trouble 
and negative publicity that may result from a court case. We believe that, consistent with prudent pharmacy practice, you will want to dispense INDERAL tablets, the only propranolol 
product with the approved indication for reduction of mortality post-MI. * If you know the patient is being treated for this condition, 
dispense only INDERAL. If you are considering substitution and don't know the condition being treated, take a few minutes to 
discuss the subject with your patient and the prescribing physician. Ayerst Laboratories considers pharmacists to be important members of the health-care profession. We support your need to be 
informed about critical issues regarding drug selection, and hope that we've helped to clarify the important issue of exclusive 
labeling.Sincerely, Marvin A. Heuer, MD"

Ayerst is in paragraph 43 which alleges that Ayerst gave money to a group known as ""CUREP."" The complaint asserts that a Dr. 
Sackler published statements falsely describing propranolol based upon a meeting of CUREP. We believe that this falls woefully 
short of the use of ""third-party advertising,"" which, in this context, by itself would not ""constitute a violation of the Sherman Act.""

at 224-25. "
1137,2," The Seventh Circuit has recently emphasized that trademark analysis should focus on the function of the trademark, rather 
than on whether the mark Is generic, descriptive, arbitrary or suggestive.  Scandia Down, 772 F.2d at 1431 n. 3; Walt-West, 695 
F.2d at 1057. See also Blau, 781 F.2d at 608 (""Labels should not determine rights."")."
1137,3," Brady has not alleged or presented any evidence that Lem attempted to pass itself off as a Brady distributor. See Tr. of 
October 25, 1982 at 85-86. "
1138,4," Even if color, per se, were trademarkable in the Seventh Circuit, the court would still find that Brady does not have a valid 
common law trademark in the color of its wire marker cards. First, the court finds that blue serves an aesthetic function, making 
the wire marker cards more pleasing to corporations that buy, and persons who apply, wire markers. However, wire marker card 
manufacturers do not have to color their cards blue in order to compete effectively in the market.  W.T. Rogers, 778 F.2d at 346. 
Indeed, the manufacturers can and do use other colors, and neither party presented testimony that blue is the only, or the most, 
attractive color for wire marker cards, or that all available and attractive colors and color combinations have been appropriated 
by wire marker card manufacturers. Therefore, aesthetic functionality would not bar Brady from obtaining the trademark 
protection it seeks. However, the court finds that Brady has failed to demonstrate that blue has acquired a secondary meaning. In determining 
whether a mark has acquired a secondary meaning, the court must be ""chiefly concerned"" with the attitude of purchasers toward 
the mark.  Ideal, 612 F.2d at 1023. Brady presented no testimony from wire marker purchasers or survey results indicating that 
the purchasers associate blue with Brady's cards. Instead, there was evidence that, from 1975 until 1982, Brady itself supplied 
blue wire marker cards to Gardner-Bender Co. for distribution under the Gardner-Bender private label. There was also evidence 
that Stranco uses blue for the cover of its wire marker books and its wire marker literature, and Brady manufactures non-blue 
wire marker cards. The court, based on all of this evidence, and the lack of evidence concerning purchasers' attitudes, finds that 
Brady failed to establish a secondary meaning linking blue wire marker cards with Brady in the minds of wire marker purchasers."
1138,5," The Seventh Circuit has recently stated that trade dress may include a product's color. Vaughan, at 348 n. 2; W.T. Rogers, 778 
F.2d at 337. However, in neither case does the court mention or distinguish Life Savers or state that color per se may constitute 
a valid trademark. "
1139,6," Although consumer survey evidence is not required in order to succeed on a motion for a preliminary injunction, Vaughan, slip 
op.  at 6; A.J. Canfield, 796 F.2d at 908, the court finds that the complete absence of survey or other evidence of consumer 
attitude at the trial on the merits of this action demonstrates a lack of secondary meaning. "
1143,7," The Supreme Court enunciated this doctrine in Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 
127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961), and United Mine Workers of America v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 
L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965); hence, its name. "
1147,8," In ruling on the parties' cross-motions for partial summary judgment on Lem's Robinson-Patman claim, the court found that 
Lem lacked standing to challenge Brady's alleged discriminatory prices to some companies because Lem did not show that it 
directly competed with Brady for the business of those companies; therefore, the court limited the controverted issues of fact 
remaining for trial under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(b) to those companies for whose business Lem and Brady directly competed. See 
Memorandum Opinion and Order of December 29, 1980. After the court's ruling, Lem, for the first time, came forward with 
affidavits indicating that it had directly sought to attain the business of many of the companies. The court consequently granted 
Lem's motion for reconsideration of the December 29, 1980 order, and ruled that it would not limit the Robinson-Patman factual 
issues remaining for trial. See Memorandum Opinion and Order of May 11, 1981. In the May, 1981 order, however, the court 
ruled that Lem could not present evidence pertaining to any alleged discriminatory prices Brady offered to Reliance Electric Co. 
(""Reliance""), because Lem's evidence revealed that, during Lem's single attempt to solicit Reliance's business, it offered a lower 
price than Brady offered. Id. at 3-4. At and after trial, Brady moved to strike evidence relating to 34 companies, which Lem claims received discriminatory prices 
from Brady, on the basis that Lem failed to produce sufficient evidence at trial that it directly competed with Brady for the 
business of those 34 companies. In moving to strike, however, Brady recognized that, should the court grant Brady's motion and 
strike the evidence from consideration under the Robinson-Patman Act, the court could still consider the evidence under Lem's 
Sherman Act Section 2 claim. The court reserved ruling on the motion to strike until its decision on the merits. The court now denies the motion to strike, but 
finds that Lem's evidence fails to show that it directly competed with Brady for the business of many, if not all, of the customers' 
business. "
1148,9," The evidence at trial demonstrated that Brady and Lem rarely, if ever, directly competed for a customer's business. The 
evidence revealed that Lem, as well as Brady, sold through independent distributors who were free to contract with the ultimate 
customers as they saw fit. See PX 341 at 7, 17; PX 335 at 47-49; Tr. of November 9, 1982 at 28-30. Therefore, in most cases, 
any direct competition took place between the distributors of Brady and Lem wire markers; not between Brady and Lem. Lem 
presented little, and inconclusive, evidence that it directly competed with Brady for the business of certain distributors or 
customers."
1148,10," The court notes that Lem established all other elements of a price discrimination prima facie case. At trial, Lem presented 
evidence that Brady is engaged in commerce, that Brady, in the blanket contracts, discriminated in price between different wire 
marker card purchasers for purchases of the same type and quantity of cards, and that such purchases were in commerce. 
Brady, during the relevant time period, had extended wire marker card price lists which, logically, established lower prices per 
hundred cards for orders of greater quantities of cards. Lem demonstrated that Brady offered prices below its extended price 
lists to blanket contract distributors in two ways. First, Brady set the blanket contract price based on the total quantity to be 
ordered annually, not on the quantity per order. For example, if the price for an order of 5,000 cards were $ 30 per hundred 
cards in the extended price list, and the price for an order of 25,000 cards were $ 10 per hundred cards, a blanket contract 
distributor who ordered 5,000 cards, but who was scheduled to purchase 25,000 cards during the contract term, would pay at 
the price set for orders for 25,000 cards, or $ 10 per hundred, not $ 30 per hundred. Second, in certain blanket contracts, Brady 
set the price below the rate set in the extended price list for the total quantity to be ordered annually. For example, the same 
blanket contract distributor would be scheduled to purchase a total of 25,000 cards during the contract term, but would pay only 
$ 5 per hundred cards for each order under the contract. The court notes that the prices In these examples are not the actual 
prices Brady offered to its blanket contract distributors. "
1149,11," Brady contends that Lem's Robinson-Patman claim is a predatory pricing claim; therefore, Lem must demonstrate that Brady 
priced below some measure of cost in order to prevail. An antitrust plaintiff may challenge a predatory pricing policy under 
Section 2 of the Sherman Act, and under the Robinson-Patman Act where that Act's requirements are met. If the plaintiff 
proceeds under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, the plaintiff will more than likely need to demonstrate that the defendant set its 
price below some measure of cost in order to prevail. See MCI Communications, 708 F.2d at 1123 n. 59; Chillicothe, 615 F.2d at 
432. In any event, Lem's challenge to the pricing in the blanket contracts Is based on the Robinson-Patman Act, not Section 2 of the 
Sherman Act. As set forth In the text, under the Robinson-Patman Act, a plaintiff may show a reasonable possibility of harm to 
competition through market analysis, express evidence of predatory intent, or evidence of predatory conduct from which the 
court may infer predatory intent. It may be that a Robinson-Patman plaintiff relying on predatory conduct to establish a 
reasonable possibility of harm to competition may need to demonstrate below-cost pricing in order to prevail, as under Section 2 
of the Sherman Act. See D.E. Rogers Associates, Inc. v. Gardner-Denver Co., 718 F.2d 1431, 1438-40 (6th Cir. 1983) (equating 
proof necessary under the Robinson-Patman Act with that necessary under Section 2 of the Sherman Act in predatory pricing 
cases); cert. denied, 467 U.S. 1242, 104 S. Ct. 3513, 82 L. Ed. 2d 822 (1984). See generally Hovencamp, Economics and 
Federal Antitrust Law ยง 6.12 at 189-90 (1985). This court need not reach this question, however, as the court finds that Lem 
failed to present any evidence, price-cost evidence or otherwise, demonstrating a reasonable possibility of harm to competition."
1149,12," Furthermore, as to the limited instances in which Lem directly competed with Brady for the business of certain customers and 
distributors, not only did Lem fail to establish a prima facie case of price discrimination, but Brady presented persuasive, "
1150,," voluminous evidence that it set its blanket contract prices to meet the equally low prices of its competitors. See Tr. of November 
8, 1982 at 840-46, 858, 875-85, 903; Tr.  of November 23, 1982 at 1015-18; Tr. of December 6, 1982 at 1241-42; PX 338 at 30, 
36, 45-71, 84-87, 108, 125; DX 293A at 1-2. The evidence establishes that Brady had a policy of obtaining Information regarding 
available competitive prices before setting blanket contract prices, and the court finds that a reasonable and prudent person 
examining the information that Brady collected would believe that the price Brady charged was generally available to the 
customer from Brady's competitors. Falls City, 460 U.S. at 438, 103 S. Ct. at 1290; Holleb, 532 F.2d at 35. The court notes that it is unclear whether Brady may rely on the meeting competition defense of Section 2(b) of the Clayton Act 
for the majority of its blanket contracts which it entered into with distributors instead of ultimate customers. Brady's meeting 
competition defense focuses on competitive prices available to the customers, not the distributors. Apparently, Brady contends that it set the prices in the Brady/distributor contracts at a level which would enable the distributor to 
offer the ultimate customer a price available to the customer from Brady's competitors or their distributors. This court need not 
determine whether the meeting competition defense may extend to meeting the competition of the ultimate customer where the 
manufacturer deals through a truly independent distributor, as the court finds that Lem has failed to establish a prima facie case 
of price discrimination. "
1158,1," When a federal court reviews the sufficiency of a complaint, before the reception of any evidence . . . its task is necessarily a 
limited one.  The issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to 
support the claims. Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236, 40 L. Ed. 2d 90, 94 S. Ct. 1683 (1974)."
1158,2," Specifically, KMT alleges that defendants monopolized and attempted to monopolize the exhibition of films in the Genesee 
County area in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 2 and that agreements between defendants and film 
distributors constitute an unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. KMT also alleges that 
defendants' actions violate state antitrust laws and constitute tortious interference with prospective business advantage."
1158,3, All referred to as counterdefendants.
1158,4," In addition to alleging that counterdefendants violated Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, National claims that 
counterdefendants have violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 18. Moreover, National alleges that 
counterdefendants' actions constitute a violation of Michigan Antitrust laws, that KMT's complaint in this action violates Sections 
1 and 2 of the Sherman Act as well as being an abuse of process under Michigan law and that counterdefendants tortiously 
interfered with National's prospective business relations."

1159,7," See also South Haven Land Co. Inc. v. Malone & Hyde, Inc., 715 F.2d 1079 (1983). In South Haven, the Sixth Circuit Court of 
Appeals examined the factors courts should use in analyzing whether an antitrust plaintiff had standing under section 4. Among 
these factors was the ""nature of the plaintiff's alleged injury including the status of the plaintiff as consumer or competitor in the 
relevant market."" Id. at 1084."
1159,8," HN4[
] Three elements must be established to prove a violation of Section 1: (1) a contract, combination or conspiracy among two or more separate entities, (2) that unreasonably restrains trade, and (3) is in or affects interstate commerce. See White & 
White, supra. To determine whether a restraint unreasonably restrains competition, there are two methods of analyses: the rule 
of reason and the per se rule. In United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 570-71, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778, 86 S. Ct. 1698 (1966), the United States Supreme 
Court stated that HN5[
] the elements of a Section 2 monopoly offense were: (1) the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market and (2) the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as 
distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident. In White & White, the Court of Appeals stated the Section 2 attempt to monopolize is composed of the following elements: (1) Specific intent to monopolize. (2) Anti-competitive conduct. (3) A dangerous probability of success. White & White at 506."
1159,9," National cites Com-tel, Inc. v. Dukane Corp., 669 F.2d 404 (6th Cir. 1982), which involved three dealers of a manufacturer's 
product who conspired with a manufacturer whose policy was to permit intrabrand competition. The dealers agreed with the 
manufacturer that they would all refuse to deal with plaintiff, a price cutter. The Court found this conduct illegal as a group 
boycott. "
1160,10," Group boycotts are concerted refusals by traders to deal with other traders.  Klor's Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., 359 
U.S. 207, 3 L. Ed. 2d 741, 79 S. Ct. 705 (1959)."
1160,11," Although it is true, as National asserts, that the Court must inquire as to the effect and purpose of the restrictions in 
determining whether a defendant's actions are per se illegal; nevertheless, before the Court can consider this, it must decide 
whether there was in fact a horizontal agreement."
1160,12," Although National contends that parties to a boycott do not need to be competitors, this ignores the facts of the cases it cites. 
Moreover, National cites A.I. Root Company v. Computer Dynamics, Inc., 615 F. Supp. 727 (D.C. Ohio 1985), which actually 
supports the Court's conclusion that for the counterdefendants' action to be analyzed under the rule of reason requires collusion 
among competitors."
1160,13," See Com-Tel, supra (quoting Klors, supra; United States v. General Motors Corp., 384 U.S. 127, 16 L. Ed. 2d 415, 86 S. Ct. 
1321 (1966))."
1160,14," Antitrust laws are designed to protect competition, not competitors. Brunswick, supra at 488. See also Richter Concrete v. 
Hilltop Concrete, 691 F.2d 818 (6th Cir. 1982). ""The fact that the . . .  practice adversely affects a firm's business is ordinarily 
insufficient to establish an unreasonable restraint of trade, absent further proof that such adverse effect also substantially 
impairs competition."" ABA ANTITRUST SECTION, ANTITRUST LAW DEVELOPMENTS 18 (2d ed. 1984). "
1161,15," This is also a requirement in a Section 2 case.  Byars v. Bluff City News Co., 609 F.2d 843, 860 (6th Cir. 1979). As preservation of competition is at the heart of the Sherman and Clayton Acts, a practice should be deemed 'unfair or 
predatory' only if it is unreasonably anticompetitive. In a ยง 2 case, only a thorough analysis of each fact situation will reveal 
whether the monopolistic conduct is unreasonably anticompetitive and thus unlawful."
1161,16," This is also important for determining market power. As counterdefendants point out, this is not contained in the counterclaim."
1161,17," National also mentions that the public has been harmed by having to pay higher prices but this allegation is nowhere to be 
found in the counterclaim. Moreover, National cites Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 60 L. Ed. 2d 931, 99 S. Ct. 2326 
(1979) and NCAA v. Board of Regents, 468 U.S. 85, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70, 104 S. Ct. 2948 (1984) in support of its contention that the 
Court should assess consumer preferences. Although the Supreme Court in NCAA indicated that Congress designed the 
Sherman Act as a ""consumer welfare prescription,"" (citing Reiter at 343), the Court analyzed restraints in terms of their effect on 
measurable factors such as price and output. "
1162,," A restraint that has the effect of reducing the importance of consumer preference in setting price and output is not 
consistent with [the fundamental goal of consumer welfare prescription] of antitrust law. NCAA at 88. As to the issue whether National has alleged facts sufficient to show that counterdefendants have sufficient market power, the 
Court is satisfied that National has satisfied its pleading obligation. National has alleged that the counterdefendants used 
monopoly or market power in other markets to restrain trade in this market. In this respect, this case is similar to Hand, supra 
which used a rule of reason analysis for a tying arrangement (analogous to the leveraging allegations in the instant case). The 
court stated that in deciding whether tying two products poses a threat of competitive harm requires that the seller have power in 
the tying product market. See also White & White, supra at 506. "
1163,18," National states that ""the counterdefendants had the capacity to enter the market, in which they bought the Butterfield theatres, 
de novo.  They chose instead to acquire the theatres and thereby remove themselves as potential competitors."" As counterdefendants point out the potential competition theory has been used to analyze acquisitions for their possible violation 
of Section 7 and involves acquisition of firms in the relevant market by firms outside the relevant market. See e.g., United States 
v. Marine Bancorporation, 418 U.S. 602, 41 L. Ed. 2d 978, 94 S. Ct. 2856 (1974). Transactions eliminating a potential competitor have been challenged because . . . the acquiring firm, but for the merger, 
very likely would have entered a concentrated market de novo or by acquisition of a much smaller ('toehold') firm, thus 
creating additional competition and likely future deconcentration in the market . . . . Antitrust Law Developments, supra, at 
178. The principal prerequisite to this theory is that the market be sufficiently concentrated.  United States v. Marine 
Bancorporation, supra. Moreover, it must be determined that the entering company had feasible means of entry other than 
by acquisition and that 'those means offer a substantial likelihood of ultimately significant procompetitive effects.' Id.  at 633. "

1170,*," Honorable J. Smith Henley, Senior U.S. Circuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation."
1170,1, The Section 2 claim was voluntarily withdrawn by TXP prior to trial.
1170,2," For example, the Fox Theatre, an enclosed facility, seats approximately 4,500 spectators, and Chastain Park, an unenclosed 
facility, seats approximately 6,500."
1170,3," TOPCOL is a successor corporation to TOPCOG, one of the other appellants in this lawsuit. TOPCOG in turn was a successor 
corporation to TOPCO, which was not named as a defendant in this suit. All three corporate entities performed essentially the 
same functions. TOPCO assigned its rights regarding the Omni to TOPCOG on February 1, 1980, and TOPCOG assigned those 
same rights to TOPCOL in December 1986. Both TOPCO and TOPCOG were subsequently dissolved. For simplicity, we will 
refer to the entity which successively performed the functions of what is now TOPCOL as ""TOPCOL"" throughout this opinion. "
1171,4," TOPCOL usually rents the Omni for a fixed percentage of gross ticket sales for the event or, less frequently, a fixed dollar 
amount."
1171,5," A computerized ticketing agency called Select-a-Seat operated in Atlanta in the early to mid-1970's, but ceased operations in 
the Atlanta area with the creation of SEATS in 1974. Small hard-ticketing companies have also operated in Atlanta from time to 
time, focussing on ticket sales for events staged at smaller facilities. For the period of time relevant to this lawsuit, however, 
SEATS and TXP were the only two ticket agencies operating in the Atlanta area."
1171,6," The companies also differ in that SEATS sells tickets for a wide variety of events, such as sports events, the circus, and ice 
shows, while TXP specializes in selling tickets for popular music concerts."
1171,7," The district court did find that the NCAA, the ACC and Amway had all used their own in-house hard-ticketing systems for 
events they staged at the Omni. The district court reasonably gave little weight to these occasions because none of the 
organizations hired any outside ticketing agency, but instead did the ticketing themselves. In addition, none of the events 
sponsored by any of these organizations were musical concerts, and therefore were not events TXP might have sold tickets for. "
1172,8," Split-ticketing would be an advantageous ticketing arrangement where a promoter anticipates that the draw for a particular 
event will come from a certain residential section of town or a particular group or class of people that may not have ready access 
to any of the fixed SEATS computer terminal locations. As an example, a promoter might be bringing in a rock band with 
particular appeal to college students and might want to sell hard tickets on the college campuses in the Atlanta area (assuming 
those campuses do not have SEATS terminals on or near the campus), in addition to selling tickets from the usual SEATS 
outlets."
1172,9," There was some testimony at trial that SEATS had permitted split-ticketing on a few occasions in response to specific ticketing 
needs, but the district court found that these isolated incidents did not disturb the conclusion that SEATS does not permit split-
ticketing as a matter of policy."
1172,10," This case has two case numbers and is technically ""consolidated"" because the district court inadvertently omitted one of the 
defendants from his original final judgment order and subsequently entered a separate order as to that defendant. As a 
consequence, there were two notices of appeal filed even though the two notices involved the same case and identical legal 
issues. "
1173,11," As the Supreme Court explained in Northern Pacific Railway Co., supra, ""if one of a dozen food stores in a community were to 
refuse to sell flour unless the buyer also took sugar it would hardly tend to restrain competition in sugar if its competitors were 
ready and able to sell flour by itself."" 356 U.S. at 7, 78 S. Ct. at 519; see also Jefferson Parish, supra, 466 U.S. at 12, 104 S. Ct. 
at 1558. "
1174,12," There is no dispute that the lease of the Omni and the sale of tickets to events at the Omni constitute two separate product 
markets. Cf.  Times-Picayune Publishing Co., supra, 345 U.S. at 614, 73 S. Ct. at 883; Amey, Inc., supra, 758 F.2d at 1503."
1174,13," The appellants do not argue that any of the district court's findings of facts are clearly erroneous; they argue only that the court 
erred as a matter of law in drawing its legal conclusions from those facts."
1174,14," Some courts have described this same concept as a requirement the plaintiff prove that the purchase of the tying product was 
""conditioned"" on the purchase of the tied product. See Times-Picayune Publishing Co., supra, 345 U.S. at 605, 73 S. Ct. at 878; 
Photovest Corp., supra, 606 F.2d at 725; SmithKline Corp., supra, 575 F.2d at 1061 n. 3; Bogosian v. Gulf Oil Corp., 561 F.2d 
434, 450 (3rd Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1086, 98 S. Ct. 1280, 55 L. Ed. 2d 791 (1978); Kentucky Fried Chicken, supra, 
549 F.2d at 377. The appellants elected to use the ""conditioning"" language in their brief. To avoid confusion, however, we will 
use the district court's terminology."
1174,15," As an initial point of contention, the parties quibble over what role ""coercion"" plays in proving a tying case. TXP contends that 
it is not necessary to prove coercion at all where the plaintiff is a competitor in the tied market rather than a buyer of the tied 
product. We reject this argument. It is clear that although competitors do not have to show that they themselves were forced or 
coerced to do anything, they do have to show that the buyer of the tied package was forced or coerced to buy the tied product. 
While some dicta in a few Fifth Circuit cases suggests that there is less of a need for a competitor to prove coercion than for a 
buyer to do so, see Ogden Food Service Corp. v. Mitchell, 614 F.2d 1001, 1002 n. 3 (5th Cir. 1980); Heatransfer Corp. v. 
Volkswagenwerk, A.G., 553 F.2d 964, 978 (5th Cir. 1977), it is doubtful that any such distinction survives Jefferson Parish. In 
that case, which was a lawsuit brought by a competitor rather than a buyer, the Supreme Court discussed the necessity of 
proving force or coercion without making any distinction between suits brought by competitors and suits brought by buyers, 
thereby implicitly rejecting the proposition that competitors do not have to show force or coercion to prove a tie-in.  466 U.S. at 
12-14, 26, 104 S. Ct. at 1558-59, 1565. Appellants, on the other hand, appear to argue that ""coercion"" is a distinct and separate element of a tying violation. Although 
the cases treat proof of coercion in a variety of ways, it generally appears to be part and parcel of two other requisite elements of 
proof rather than a separate element: 1) that the products are actually ""tied"" as a matter of antitrust law and 2) that the seller 
has the market power to force the buyer to purchase the tied product. See e.g., Amey, Inc., supra, 758 F.2d at 1502-03; Bob 
Maxfield, Inc. v. American Motors, Inc., 637 F.2d 1033, 1037 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 860, 102 S. Ct. 315, 70 L. Ed. 2d 
158 (1981); Kentucky Fried Chicken, supra, 549 F.2d at 377-78. Accordingly, we reject the argument that the district court erred 
by not treating coercion as a distinct element of proof. "
1175,16," Other findings of fact in support of this conclusion are that promoters contracting with TOPCOL to use the Omni never signed 
a separate contract with SEATS to provide ticketing services or engaged in separate negotiation with SEATS. In addition, some 
agreements contained typed-in language requiring promoters to pay the ticketing service fee together with the rent to TOPCOL 
following the show. "
1176,17," Although several promoters also testified at trial that they would have used TXP for split-ticketing at the Omni had SEATS 
permitted it, see discussion supra slip opinion p. 2524, p.     , the district court concluded that SEATS' refusal to permit split-
ticketing was a reasonable business practice and that there was no evidence to establish that any of the promoters (with the 
exception of Jim Veal) would have used TXP instead of SEATS to ticket an entire performance at the Omni. As discussed infra, 
we find no reason to disturb the district court's conclusions regarding split-ticketing."
1176,18," As an initial argument, appellants claim that the district court erred because it made no explicit finding of coercion. While the 
appellants are correct in asserting that the court failed to make an explicit finding of coercion, it is an inconsequential point. The 
court did make an explicit finding that the lease of the Omni was conditioned upon the use of SEATS and, further, that the two 
were tied as a matter of antitrust law. Since a conclusion that two products are ""tied"" as a matter of antitrust law by definition 
means that the purchase of the tied product was in fact coerced, the district court's conclusions implicitly embrace a finding of 
coercion. See also supra n. 15. Furthermore, as discussed infra, we conclude that the court's findings adequately establish 
coercion, regardless of whether the court explicitly found it or not. "
1179,19, The court does not explicitly spell its reasoning out; we are extrapolating from various findings of fact in the opinion.
1179,20," This last ""finding"" was not among the district court's findings, but part of the testimony presented at trial. "
1180,21," TXP also challenges the appellants' refusal to engage in split-ticketing as part of the tying arrangement and as a tying 
arrangement in and of itself. Both arguments are meritless. As for the first claim, the court accepted the policy against split-
ticketing as permissible, presumably because SEATS offered a legitimate business justification for it: it would dilute the best 
feature of computerized ticketing -- having all the tickets on sale simultaneously at every location. See Kentucky Fried Chicken, 
supra, 549 F.2d at 376. As for the second claim, the split-ticketing policy cannot be an illegal tying arrangement because it does 
not involve two separate products. See Times-Picayune Publishing Co., supra, 345 U.S. at 613-14, 73 S. Ct. at 883."
1180,22," The bonding requirement applies to all ticketing agencies, including SEATS."
1180,23," The district court had originally included a provision in the injunction to permit the appellants to approve prospective ticket 
agencies, but later removed the provision because it gave the appellants too much control over the selection of ticket agencies. "
1181,24," This court can only reverse the district court's fee award upon a showing that the award was an abuse of discretion.  City of 
Riverside v. Rivera, 477 U.S. 561, 106 S. Ct. 2686, 2693, 91 L. Ed. 2d 466 (1986); Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., 
488 F.2d 714, 717 (5th Cir. 1974)."
1181,25," At least two courts have noted that the principles guiding attorney's fee awards in other cases, such as civil rights suits under 
42 U.S.C.A. ยง 1983, should not be applied mechanically to antitrust cases.  Twin City Sportservice, supra, 676 F.2d at 1314; 
Black Gold Ltd., supra, 529 F. Supp. at 274. "
1182,26," We acknowledge that some courts have rejected this approach. See, e.g., Gossner v. Cache Valley Dairy Association, 307 F. 
Supp. 1090, 1091 (D.Utah 1970). "
1190,*," The Honorable Zita L. Weinshienk, United States District Judge for the District of Colorado, sitting by designation. "
1204,1," The first motion to dismiss filed herein was filed by First Maryland. Although First Maryland has been dismissed voluntarily, 
several other defendants have adopted several of First Maryland's arguments by reference. Consequently, the Court will refer to 
arguments and exhibits of the First Maryland motion. These papers are still a part of the record in this case. "
1214,2," Judge Ramsey of this Court has stated in passing that RICO establishes exclusive jurisdiction in the federal courts. See Morley 
v. Cohen, 610 F. Supp. 798, 822 (D. Md. 1985)(citing 18 U.S.C. ยง 1965(a) (the venue statute)). It does not appear from that 
opinion, however, that the issue was argued or that Judge Ramsey considered any of the above cases, including Gulf Offshore 
v. Mobile Oil Co. "
1215,3," Blakey expressed his thoughts that, based on the use of the antitrust laws as a model for RICO and based on the exclusive 
federal jurisdiction of the predicate offenses, courts could infer an intent to limit jurisdiction to the federal courts. Id. These two 
arguments and cases following them will be discussed infra. "
1218,4," None of those cases involved the exact situation of investors suing the directors of a savings and loan in receivership. 
However, as discussed ante slip op. at pp. 13-16, this suit clearly falls within the remedial scheme set up in response to the 
savings and loan crisis. "
1227,1," This Court has previously dismissed their claim for the negligent infliction of emotional distress. For an excellent, nation-wide 
synthesis of the evolving law in this area, see S. Plotkin, The Evolution of Tort Liability for Psychic Injuries: A Proposal to Protect 
Relational Interests (1986) (unpublished thesis on file at the University of Virginia School of Law)."

1228,4," This opinion uses the word ""Administrator"" generally to refer to the Administrator himself and also to the National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration, its predecessor, the National Highway Traffic Safety Bureau, the Department of Transportation, 
and the Secretary of Transportation."
1228,5," The ignition interlock system was prohibited by Congress in 1974 in an amendment to the Safety Act that also provided that 
any future safety standards other than seatbelts would have to be submitted to Congress where they would be subject to 
legislative veto.  15 U.S.C. ยง 1410(b). The legislative veto provision is apparently unconstitutional in light of Immigration and 
Naturalization Service v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 77 L. Ed. 2d 317, 103 S. Ct. 2764 (1983). "
1229,6," General Motors, through the affidavit of Jeffrey L. Pearson, states that the 1976 Blazer in question was assembled in August, 
1976, making the optional alternative regulations those applicable at the time of manufacture."
1229,7," General Motors' 1976 Blazer, a multipurpose passenger vehicle manufactured between January 1, 1976 and August 14, 1977, 
having a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,000 pounds or less, is covered by 49 C.F.R. ยง 571.208 - S4.2.2. (1985). The 
regulations applicable to the 1976 Blazer have remained essentially unchanged although the requirements for the first option, 
S4.1.2.1., have been amended with respect to complete automatic protection systems. This minor change is irrelevant for the 
purpose of preemption analysis. "
1230,8," General Motors has indicated in its brief that this form of preemption is not relevant to the Safety Act. HN5[
] Given that Congress expressly permitted identical regulation, 15 U.S.C. ยง 1392(d), and that states may regulate areas not specifically 
addressed by Congress, see Chrysler Corp.  v. Rhodes, 416 F.2d 319 (1st Cir. 1969), it is apparent that Congress did not 
intend to occupy the entire field of motor vehicle safety."
1230,9," HN7[
] In prescribing any standards under the Safety Act, the Administrator must consider whether the proposed standard is reasonable, practicable, appropriate, and whether it will contribute to carrying out the purposes of the Act.  15 U.S.C. ยง 1392(f). 
The Woods do not assert that the Administrator exceeded his authority or that he in any way flouted the statutory guidelines. Cf.  
State Farm, 463 U.S. 29, 77 L. Ed. 2d 443, 103 S. Ct. 2856 (1983) (holding that the Administrator acted capriciously and 
arbitrarily). "
1231,10," General Motors contends, nonetheless, that this Court should conclude that the Safety Act expressly preempts any putative 
award because it will have some regulatory impact on its conduct. This argument is better conceptually understood as one 
calling for implied preemption and is addressed therefore in that portion of this opinion. See infra ยง B.2, slip op pp. 18-26."
1231,11," Vanover v. Ford Motor Co., 632 F. Supp. 1095 (E.D. Mo. 1986) held that ยง 1392(d) did, in fact, expressly preempt state tort 
law liability in this area but the Vanover court made no reference to the savings clause and its discussion of the ""regulatory 
impact"" of a common law claim is better addressed as an implied preemption claim. See infra ยง B.2, slip op. pp. 18-26. "
1232,12," Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 769 F.2d 1451, 1456 (10th Cir. 1985) (on remand from Supreme Court), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 
1104, 106 S. Ct. 1947, 90 L. Ed. 2d 356 (1986). Contrary to the assertions of General Motors, Defendant's Supplemental 
Memorandum in Support of its Motion for Summary Judgment, 2, neither the Supreme Court nor the lower federal courts found 
any material violation. ""The only violations of federal regulations throughout the incident was [Kerr-McGee's] failure to maintain a 
record of the dates of two urine samples submitted by Ms. Silkwood."" 769 F.2d at 1457 (citing Silkwood, 104 S. Ct. at 619); 
Easterbrook, Foreward: The Court and the Economic Systems, 98 Harv. L. Rev. 4, 43 (1984) (""The NRC concluded that the 
plant had complied with all pertinent safety requirements; a jury concluded that it had not . . . ."").  In fact, the dissent in Silkwood 
explicitly focused on the lack of violations and the meticulous oversight of the plant by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (then 
the Atomic Energy Commission).  Silkwood, 464 U.S. at 277 (Powell, J., dissenting); id. at 262 (Blackmun, J., dissenting)."
1232,13," Mr. Justice Powell, dissenting in Silkwood, believes such awards present no element of regulation. 464 U.S. at 276 n.3 (""There 
is no element of regulation when compensatory damages are awarded . . . .""). "
1234,14," General Motors, in its argument for preemption, relies principally on San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, 359 U.S. 
236, 247, 3 L. Ed. 2d 775, 79 S. Ct. 773 (1959) and Fidelity Federal Savings & Loan Ass'n v. De La Cuesta, 458 U.S. 141, 73 L. 
Ed. 2d 664, 102 S. Ct. 3014 (1982), both decided before Silkwood. In Garmon, the Supreme Court stated that ""regulation can be 
as effectively exerted through an award of damages as through some form of preventive relief."" 359 U.S. at 247, noted in 
Silkwood, 464 U.S. at 249. In Garmon, the Supreme Court held that the federal government occupied the field of National Labor 
Relations and that state law regulating conduct ""only arguably protected by the National Labor Relations Act"" is nonetheless 
preempted. The Supreme Court, in Garmon, was concerned that the National Labor Relations Board's (""NLRB"") jurisdiction 
would be flouted if litigants sidestepped its remedial scheme and instead opted for bringing state law claims. Recently, the 
Supreme Court, while discussing the National Labor Relations Act (""NLRA"") and Garmon, articulated the different standards 
applied when the NLRB is involved.  ""[A] presumption of federal preemption applies even when the state law regulates conduct 
only arguably protected by federal law. Such a pre-emption rule avoids the potential for jurisdictional conflict between state 
courts or agencies and the NLRB by ensuring that primary responsibility for interpreting and applying this body of labor law 
remains with the NLRB. . . .  Garmon, 359 U.S. at 244-45. This presumption of federal pre-emption [is] based on the primary 
jurisdiction rationale."" Brown v. Hotel & Restaurant Employees & Bartenders International Union Local 54, 468 U.S. 491, 502, 82 
L. Ed. 2d 373, 104 S. Ct. 3179 (1984). Thus, the Supreme Court's concern in Garmon is better understood as one with the 
primary jurisdiction of the NLRB and the exclusive application of its remedial scheme. The NLRA provided a specific avenue for 
redress for the petitioner in Garmon. ""The Court's discussion of pre-emption of state common law claims must be read with that 
in mind."" Palmer, 633 F. Supp. at 1175 n.3. Normally, as in the case with the Safety Act, the presumption as to ""arguably protected conduct"" is just the opposite in 
preemption analysis.  Further, the only relief for the Woods, where General Motors has complied with the federal safety 
regulation, is provided by a common law claim. Cf.  15 U.S.C. ยง 1400 (providing a cause of action for dealers where 
manufacturers fail to comply with the safety standards). In De La Cuesta, the other Supreme Court case relied upon by General Motors, the issue was whether a judge made 
determination that due-on-sale clauses in mortgage contracts would not be enforced at the lender's option was preempted by 
federal regulations issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (""Board""). The regulations provided that a federal savings and 
loan association had the power to include and enforce due-on-sale clauses contained in their loan instruments. The Supreme 
Court focused its attention on whether the Board intended to preempt California's Wellenkamp doctrine. The Wellenkamp rule, 
as announced by the California Supreme Court in Wellenkamp v. Bank of America, 21 Cal. 3d 943, 582 P.2d 970, 148 Cal.  
Rptr. 379 (1978), forbade California courts from enforcing due-on-sale clauses solely at the option of the lender.  458 U.S. at "
1235,155," . After noting that compliance with the Board's permissive regulation on due-on-sale clauses and the Wellenkamp rule may 
not be a physical impossibility, the Supreme Court concluded that the doctrine nonetheless created ""an obstacle to the 
accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of the due-on-sale regulation.'"" Id. at 156 (quoting Hines, 312 
U.S. at 67). In supporting its conclusion, the Supreme Court explained that the Board unequivocally expressed its determination 
to displace state law. The Supreme Court cited to the regulations' preamble and a recent pronouncement by the Board that due-
on-sale practices ""shall be governed exclusively by the Board's regulations in preemption of and without regard to any limitations 
imposed by state law. . . ."" Id. 458 U.S. at 158 (emphasis added) (citing 12 C.F.R. ยง 556.9 (f)(2) (1982) and 41 Fed. Reg. 
18,286, 18,287 [1976]). The Board's intent to expressly preempt state law and to maintain flexibility for federal savings and loans is much more explicit 
than the purpose attributed to the Administrator by General Motors. Further, the impact of the Wellenkamp rule is much more 
certain and akin to state regulations since the California courts' had placed the petitioner on notice that its courts would not be 
an open forum for the enforcement of such clauses. Far less certainty is implicated by potential common law damage awards."
1235,15," While other portions of Justice Blackmun's opinion address the purpose of compensatory damages, see, e.g., 464 U.S. at 263 
(""The crucial distinction between compensatory and punitive damages is that the purpose of punitive damages is to regulate 
safety, whereas the purpose of compensatory damages is to compensate victims"") which purpose is arguably irrelevant to the 
regulatory effect of such awards, the quoted passage reflects Justice Blackmun's concern with the impact or effect of such 
awards."
1235,16," It is for Congress and not this Court to resolve the possible ""limitless"" regulatory consequences created by the ""tension"" on 
this particular regulatory scheme. See Silkwood, 464 U.S. at 256; Ferebee, 736 F.2d at 1543; Palmer, 633 F. Supp. at 1179. "
1236,17," The Supreme Judicial Court has stated repeatedly that the remedy of warranty liability is ""fully as comprehensive as that 
provided by ยง 402A of the Restatement [(Second) of Torts (1965)]."" Mason v. General Motors Corp., 397 Mass. 183, 189, 490 
N.E.2d 437 (1986) (quoting Swartz v. General Motors Corp., 375 Mass. 628, 378 N.E.2d 61 [1978])."
1236,18," Evidence on the economic and mechanical feasibility of airbags in 1976 is an example of the evidence to be weighed by the 
jury in deciding whether the 1976 Blazer was defective and unreasonably dangerous. At the same time, testimony that Patricia 
Wood was not wearing her seatbelt may be evidence of ""unreasonably proceeding to use a product which [she knew] to be 
defective"" thereby causing her to relinquish her protection under an implied warranty theory.  Correia v. Firestone Tire & Rubber 
Co., 388 Mass. 342, 446 N.E.2d 1033 (1983); see Allen v. Chance Manufacturing Co., 398 Mass. 32, 494 N.E.2d 1324 (1986). 
Of course, this Court makes no ruling on any of these issues at this time. "
1237,19," This Court notes that neither party has requested certification of this issue to the Supreme Judicial Court pursuant to Rule 1:03 
of the Rules of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, nor does this Court believe that such an approach is warranted. 
While this Court is not aware of any reported case which holds that liability can be imposed upon a manufacturer for failing to 
equip a vehicle with a passive restraint system, see Vanover v. Ford Motor Co., 632 F. Supp. 1095, 1098 (E.D. Mo. 1986) 
(granting summary judgment under Missouri law), there is also no impediment to such a theory under Massachusetts law. 
General Motors' reliance on Mavilia v. Stoeger Industries, 574 F. Supp. 107, 111 (D. Mass. 1983) (granting summary judgment 
on the grounds that a handgun is not unreasonably dangerous) is inapposite due to the extremely different nature of the product 
involved in that case. Consumers expect that a gun may cause fatal injuries since that is one of its essential purposes. 
Consumers do not expect to encounter a similar high degree of risk of fatality when operating a motor vehicle."

1238,21," It is instructive for a judge to be required to review one's own decision to see whether it has withstood the passage of time. At 
this remove, while the result may well be correct, I can see that my decision in Prince-Jackson unduly emphasizes the grief 
attendant upon the maiming or death of a child. HN18[
] A loss of consortium claim, however, does not compensate one for 
grief stemming from injury to a loved one but rather for damage to a beneficial relationship which, but for the intervention of the 
tortfeasor, would have continued undamaged. See generally Lowe, Tortious Interference with the Parent-Child Relationship: 
Loss of an Injured Person's Society and Companionship, 51 Ind. L.J. 590 (1976). "
1244,1," Not every case cited by defendants is reconcilable with this analysis. In Patriot Cinemas, Inc. v. General Cinema Corp., No. 86-
1190-Y (D. Mass. Dec. 1, 1986), the court permitted removal of a state suit in which plaintiff asserted state antitrust and common 
law claims. The court denied remand because it found that plaintiff's allegations challenging distribution of first-run films stated a 
claim arising under the Sherman Act, despite the complaint's reliance on state law. The court expressly refused to consider 
plaintiff's motive for filing in state court by ignoring the fact that plaintiff had previously commenced two federal suits against the 
same defendants raising substantially similar claims. "
1246,2," Grubbs v. General Electric Credit Corp., 405 U.S. 699, 31 L. Ed. 2d 612, 92 S. Ct. 1344 (1972), is not to the contrary. In 
Grubbs, the Supreme Court held that if there is any basis for sustaining federal jurisdiction of a judgment entered after a trial on 
the merits has taken place without any motion to remand, the validity of removal may not be raised sua sponte by the appellate 
court. The Court did not even suggest that denial of a timely motion to remand would have been permissible. "

1334,3," Interwoven among a number of BCBSK's present arguments is the assertion this court somehow ""coerced"" defendant into 
suspending Wesley's termination pending trial. The transcript of the November 21, 1985 proceeding belies this accusation: THE COURT: . . . What is your suggestion as to what we might do between now and the first of the year? You agree that 
you might be well advised to have the issue adjudicated in advance of January 1 and if you're wrong, at least know it first or 
up front? MR. SHULMAN: Your Honor, we are pleased to have the issue adjudicated whenever it is convenient for the Court. Our 
concerns -- and whether that is before the first of the year or after, we'll defer to the Court on that. THE COURT: Would you sit still to maintain your present status until it is adjudicated? MR. SHULMAN: We have discussed that, Your Honor, and I believe we would be willing to do that because we are -- 
assuming, as I'm sure the Court is interested in doing, that the matter is adjudicated promptly. We have two real concerns 
procedural [sic], Your Honor: First is that we have an opportunity to present as fully as possible our side of the matter. THE COURT: You will have that. You may be assured of it. MR. SHULMAN: Okay. THE COURT: I'm giving credence to the plaintiffs' claim. If I gave them full credence and acquiesced in what they said, 
seems to me that Blue Cross is in some trouble if that's what they are going to do and they did violate the [Sherman] Act. 
That's not to acquiesce in a thing they have said. MR. SHULMAN: If we violated the Act, Your Honor, I agree with you. THE COURT: . . . What they have asked is some kind of preliminary injunction. Would it make more sense that if we agree 
in principle to the substantive issues here, that perhaps Blue Cross would continue as presently operating pending full 
hearing on the issue as if we could take all the time we need on it and get an opinion out and then one side or the other can 
take me to the Circuit and see where we are. Would that make more sense? MR. SHULMAN: I think we would be willing to do that, Your Honor, assuming that the matter does move ahead reasonably 
promptly. THE COURT: If we agree to that in principle, I can put you on stream to the satisfaction of everybody what time you might 
need for what discovery you need, but sounds to me you pretty much would agree in principle at least to what the issues 
are. MR. SHULMAN: Yes. THE COURT: Be more of a legal argument as to where we are, wouldn't it? MR. SHULMAN: Yes. There are some factual issues, Your Honor. . . . . . . . MR. DUNCAN: I don't have any problem with that, Your Honor. Sounds like a good solution to me. . . . . . . . THE COURT: [It] makes sense to me that both sides would be well advised to proceed this way. I don't see any harm done 
to Blue Cross to [have the contract] remain in effect and I would be happy to take the blame in the sense that I could enter 
some kind of a brief order that we have conferred, this is in the best interest of the parties that the present contract remain 
in effect pending hearing on the issue and give you assurance I will do it as readily as we can and you guys tells me what 
that time should be. What do you think? MR. SHULMAN: I think that is fine as long as it's clear that it is a matter of voluntary agreement of the parties. THE COURT: Sure. Sure. Wouldn't be as if I put it on you. . . . "

1335,4," Section 7 of the Clayton Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 18, provides in pertinent part: HN5[
] No corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any part of the stock or 
other share capital and no corporation subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission shall acquire the whole 
or any part of the assets of another corporation engaged also in commerce, where in any line of commerce in any section 
of the country, the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly. HN6[
] Violation of this statute supports a private cause of action for money damages.  Gottesman v. General Motors Corp.,"
1335,414," F.2d 956 (2d Cir. 1969); see also Highland Supply Corp.  v. Reynolds Metals Co., 327 F.2d 725 (8th Cir. 1964) (private right 
of action exists only where acquisition has demonstrable anticompetitive effects). "
1337,5," In addressing the issues of standing at the summary judgment stage, I noted the following: Particular attention must be given to defendant's argument HCP's damages, as well as those of New Century and Reazin, 
are ""speculative"". The case is presently before the Court in a unique posture because of the parties' voluntary agreement to 
preserve the status quo, continuing to abide by the terms of the Wesley/BCBSK contracting provider agreement pending 
the outcome of this suit. The Court perceives the case as primarily a declaratory judgment action which will be tried to the 
jury to determine whether what is now the proposed termination of Wesley's contract, along with the formation and effect of 
the revised BCBSK contracting provider agreements with the remaining Wichita hospitals, would violate the antitrust laws if 
carried out. To that extent all plaintiffs' claimed injuries and damages are ""speculative"", but of course BCBSK cannot make 
any such argument. Consistent with the manner in which this case [is postured and] will be presented to the jury, the Court 
looks not to the existing situation to determine the merit of plaintiffs' claimed damages, but to their merit if BCBSK were to 
carry out its allegedly anticompetitive conduct. Reazin v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Kansas, Inc., 635 F. Supp. 1287, 1316-17 (D. Kan. 1986). Recognizing the procedural 
impact of the unusual posture of this case is critical, as will be discussed infra, because one of defendant's present challenges to 
the verdict is the alleged impropriety of the jury basing its decision in part upon ""likely future competitive effects"" of defendant's 
activities in the market. "
1348,6," 15 U.S.C. ยง 1011 states: HN13[

regulation or taxation of such business by the several States."

of regulating the business of insurance, or which imposes a fee or tax upon such business, unless such Act specifically 
relates to the business of insurance: Provided, That after June 30, 1948, . . . the Sherman Act, and . . . the Clayton Act, and

1351,11," The Ray court went on to note defendant insurance company's threat to terminate plaintiff's agency constituted ""coercion"" 
under ยง 3(b).  430 F. Supp. at 1358. This was simply an additional observation by the court, unnecessary to its actual holding in 
light of defendant's failure to prove the conduct at issue was the ""business of insurance"" under ยง 2(b). "

Supp. 65 (N.D. Cal. 1959); and Professional & Business Men's Life Ins. Co. v. Bankers Life Co., 163 F. Supp. 274 (D. Mont. 
1958). Even before the Supreme Court's decision in Barry, those courts which narrowly construed the ยง 3(b) exception recognized 
restraints of trade in an insurance market were actionable under federal antitrust laws by injured competitors in that market. See 
Addrisi v. Equitable Life Assur. Society of U.S., 503 F.2d 725 (9th Cir. 1974), cert. denied 420 U.S. 929, 43 L. Ed. 2d 400, 95 S. 
Ct. 1129 (1975); McIlhenny v. American Title Ins. Co., 418 F. Supp.  364 (E.D. Pa. 1976); Meicler v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 372 
F. Supp. 509 (S.D. Tex. 1974), aff'd 506 F.2d 732 (5th Cir. 1975); and Transnational Ins. Co. v. Rosenlund, 261 F. Supp. 12 
(D. Ore. 1966). Barry rejected this narrow ""blacklisting"" interpretation of ยง 3(b), holding the protections afforded by that exception 
are not limited solely to companies or persons engaged in insurance.  438 U.S. at 550-52. The Court thus expanded the class of 
potential plaintiffs entitled to recover for anticompetitive activities affecting an insurance market; nowhere has the Court ever 
intimated that federal preservation of competition in an insurance market is foreclosed by the McCarran-Ferguson Act. "
1355,13," One of these communications from defense counsel submits, for my consideration, a self-serving denigration of Reazin I by a 
lawyer representing another Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan not involved in this case. This person concludes his ""analysis"" by 
suggesting (or hoping) ""it is doubtful that many courts will cite Reazin [I] for its legal analysis . . . . "" Of course, how my opinions 
applying the law to the facts of this case are treated by courts addressing different facts in other cases is not my immediate 
concern. "
1360,14," See n. 3, supra."
1360,15," See n. 5, supra. "
1364,16," The additional factual distinctions between this case and Ball Memorial cannot be overemphasized. BCI kept its traditional 
indemnity insurance plan on the market, and simply attempted to introduce a new PPO, making it available to all competing 
providers on a bid basis.  784 F.2d at 1331, 1341. Plaintiffs in that case were attempting to prevent this from coming about. The 
district court's conclusion BCI possessed no market power was based in part on its finding Indiana hospitals ""'are vertically 
integrating into the health care financing market.'"" 784 F.2d at 1332 (quoting 603 F. Supp. at 1082 (emphasis added)). ""The 
Blues have not insisted that hospitals in the Blues' PPO refrain from joining other PPOs, so rivals have access to the hospitals 
on the same basis as the Blues."" 784 F.2d at 1339 (emphasis added). By distinct contrast, this case concerns BCBSK's "
1365,," attempts to prevent vertical integration in Kansas; plaintiffs alleged and the jury found, that as a direct consequence, rivals do 
not have access to Kansas hospitals on the same basis as BCBSK. One frightening aspect of Ball Memorial, as I view the facts of this case, is that in selecting providers for its PPO (which, again, 
was open to all hospitals on a bid basis), BCI unequivocally rejected one hospital's bid of a 20% discount from its normal 
charges: The Blues excluded St. Joseph's Hospital of Ft. Wayne for two reasons -- they deemed its bid of 80% of prior prices a ""low-
ball"" that was sure to be increased, and they concluded that it was not as conveniently located as Parkview Hospital in the 
same city."
1365,784," F.2d at 1342. The Seventh Circuit interpreted the state enabling act to deny any right to discriminate on the basis of 
geography, but to require simply that any PPO ""must not 'unreasonably discriminate' among hospitals."" Id.  The court then found 
there had been no unreasonable discrimination on price: The Hospitals do not disagree with the Blues' contention that they determined St. Joseph's bid to be a low-ball quote, too 
low to be justified by its costs (on which the Blues had data) and therefore too low to be sustained. One witness testified 
without contradiction that St. Joseph's bid was well below that of any other hospital, and another testified that the Blues 
feared that ""at the first opportune time [St. Joseph's] would be asking for an unreasonably high increase."" . . ."
1365,784," F.2d at 1343. BCI's determination, in the exercise of its sound business judgment, that a 20% discount was economically unsound and 
unsustainable, casts a disturbing light on BCBSK's eager request for a 25% discount from the Saints in Wichita, the hospitals' 
willing agreement to a 20% discount (see, e.g., Pltfs.' Ex. 4, infra), and defendant's pious assertion this ""new PPO"" operates to 
the unqualified benefit of Kansas consumers of health care financing products. "
1369,17," On its merits, defendant's contention Wesley lacks ยง 1 standing must be rejected out of hand. Reazin I analyzed and applied 
antitrust standing concepts to HCP, New Century and Dr. Reazin, concluding HCP was the only one of those three plaintiffs with 
standing to pursue actual antitrust damages under ยง 4 of the Clayton Act. 635 F. Supp. at 1310-18. Wesley is certainly the 
""victim of the forbidden practices"" by defendant, suffering tangible economic injury as a consequence.  Blue Shield of Virginia v. 
McCready, 457 U.S. 465, 472, 475, 73 L. Ed. 2d 149, 102 S. Ct. 2540 n. 11 (1982). BCBSK recognized Wesley as a 
""competitor"" by virtue of its association with HCA and HCP; that is the precise reason defendant undertook the conduct at issue 
in this case. The harm to Wesley ""was clearly foreseeable; indeed, it was a necessary step in effecting the ends of the . . . illegal 
conspiracy."" McCready, 457 U.S. at 479. In fact, BCBSK's specific intent to harm Wesley may well be ""dispositive"" in creating 
standing to sue under ยง 4. Assoc. General Contractors v. Cal.  State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 537, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723, 
103 S. Ct. 897 n. 35 (1983). Wesley's injury, as a ""direct victim"" of defendant's coercion, vests the hospital with the right to 
maintain its action for treble damages.  Assoc. General Contractors, 459 U.S. at 542. "
1381,18," The court, in addressing the jury, stated at pp. 33-38 of the JQRP: I needn't tell you of the time that was expended here in a trial of this case, some seven weeks. You would know out of hand 
that to try it was a rather expensive venture for both of these sides. More than that, an expenditure of considerable 
engergies [sic] and talent by these persons, but also your own and mine in hearing this case. I can tell you that from what I 
could see, it truly has been fully tried and fairly tried and it's all there in the evidence for you to make your judgments.  
Conversely, I would say to you that if this case were retried and has to be retried, that is to say mistried because of a hung 
jury of sorts and we did it all over again, I wouldn't know how to say that the case could be better tried to another jury. I 
think I made it clear when we closed out seven weeks ago or whenever, this is probably the best tried case by the best kind 
of attorneys that I have ever had the privilege to officiate with, and you should know that. As to those instructions that you 
had, ninety-four in number, took me three hours to read them to you, if you recall, again, so far as I can see, taking in 
account the instructions and the questions that are somewhat self-explanatory, it's the best I can make them. I'm just 
human and they are as clear as I know how to do. But, more than anything else, if we had to ever face down to that 
situation and we start over, somewhere down the line, honestly, folks, we can look this world over and we are not going to 
find a better jury, any of us, than you people that have given so much now of your time and your talent. Indicating you're a 
congenial bunch and you have kept your wits and your humor, certainly a well-balanced cross-section with good common 
sense, and all of the lawyers know it and I know it and you know it. All of us are impressed. We are impressed with your 
attention span, your notes as you kept them. I'm convinced that when ya'll went to that jury room you truly did know about 
as much as you're ever going you [sic] think you need to know in this field. Again, it is just a reminder of that. I would encourage you, don't give up, and come to grips with who you are. You're the 
best kind of jury that this Court could ever ask for, so I would encourage you to stay in there. If I had any parting thoughts -- and you indicated you want to go home, welcome to -- maybe it is just to draw on some 
human nature qualities that probably persuade any kind of a body such as a jury that are each asked for your input and 
your own views and your own thoughts of the matter, you draw from your own good experiences and put your own sense of 
common sense into the background. Maybe, however, when all that transpires, work at it and think through it and come to 
grips with the questions, human nature sometimes can be that you wander away from your instructions and put into the 
factors here things that aren't in evidence and you may be holding judgments that aren't in evidence or considering 
extraneous matters that you should not be considering. And human nature is that but you should remember that. People 
just sometimes are set in their ways or hardheaded or obstinate or things of that character, and that is their nature, but that 
same person with good common sense, knowing his or her duty, should also know that that's not proper here if they can 
also realize they have some obligation to listen to the other side and try to come to grips and blend your own views with 
theirs, if you can. I can think, by example, my own experience with other jurors has been that sometimes as you're picking on a particular 
decision or rule or evidence or what happened in this event or that, that you are drawing from the criminal experience as 
opposed to your duties in the civil case. I addressed that, I think, in the jury selection. In jury cases here in hearing a 
criminal case sometimes as they start -- you have to test the evidence beyond any reasonable doubt and set aside these 
exigencies, still have a reasonable doubt in their mind, then they have to acquit somebody. I think human nature is that in 
civil cases sometimes the people test the evidence in a more severe test than they should if they understand the 
responsibility in a civil case, which is to approach it reasonably. The test really is to test it in the framework of is it more 
likely so than not that this occurred? Is that a reasonable proposition? Am I persuaded reasonably? I wouldn't know if that is 
your problem or not. I just know that human nature is sometimes that people pick on something that maybe is not a fair test. 
If they look at it reasonably, they can see it in a different light if they understand that is your responsibility in a civil case, as I 
know you do. I closed the other day when I mentioned lastly that probably in jury selection we ought to inquire if people like 
puzzles, and I think that does have some application. Jurors are really expected, understanding the case, to do their dead-
level best to see if they can make that puzzle fit all together. You talk of forty plus witnesses and three hundred exhibits and 
all of the records that you have up there, that's what you're asked to do. You're challenged to see if you can be persuaded 
reasonably that that puzzle fits. If when you're all done, you find that there is a missing piece of that puzzle, then it doesn't 
fit.  It's that simple. But in this case, the instructions I think tell you what you're charged to do. All the pieces are on the table 
and it's for you now to put them together as best you can. "
1382,," So, if I can only leave you with this word as to what I said up front in those instructions, that you surely have to remember 
you did take an oath in this case and all of us expect you to carry it out, as we know you will.  Somewhere in those 
instructions I certainly say you must remember that you're not partisans in this case. You don't have your favorites. You 
have to be jurors and fact finders and then charge the case in that light and understand what you have before you and your 
responsibilities. I know you can do it. I think what you said to me, sir, you think you can do it. I don't know if what I have said here has helped at all, but I did think it was time to maybe in light of what was said to my 
clerk, ought to bring you down and just kind of refresh you on some of your responsibilities and urge you on and certainly to 
inquire if there was any serious problem. I take from what you said, sir, at this moment that there's not.  And I would only 
leave you to say that if time is a problem, just stay in there. If you need more time, take it. Nobody here would remotely tell 
you that anyone is impatient with this jury. We're not. We'll stand by to Halloween if need be awaiting to hear from you. So, that is about all I can say now. And, again, if you want, you want to go up and commence your deliberations or take a 
break, want to go home, get a good nights sleep, walk around the chair, whatever you do, do it; then tell us what you want 
to do. You want to come back in the morning, that is fine. All right. Okay. You're excused. Thank you."
1382,19," The court addressed the jury at pp. 64-67 of the JQRP as follows: All right. Let me just make this observation and I have handed a formal statement to you and I do appreciate your 
communications and your patience and I say that again. I'm going to ask you, however, that you continue with these 
deliberations in an effort to agree upon a verdict and dispose of this case. I wanted to make additional comments here that you might consider as well: Again remind you of the importance of this 
case. If you should fail to reach a decision this case is left open and undecided. Like all cases, it must be decided 
sometime. No reason to believe that the case can be tried again in any better or more exhaustive way than it has been.  
There is no reason to believe that more evidence or clearer evidence would be produced on behalf of either side. Finally, 
there is no reason to believe that the case would ever be submitted to seven people more intelligent, more impartial or 
more reasonable than you. Remember that the plaintiffs need only convince you of the sufficiency of their claims by a 
preponderance of the evidence. That is, more likely so than not. Plaintiffs do not labor under the higher burden of proving 
their claims beyond a reasonable doubt. If a substantial majority of your members agree on the absence of particular 
elements of the plaintiffs['] claims under the preponderance of evidence standard, each dissenting juror ought to reconsider 
his or here [sic] views since the evidence appears to make no effective impression upon the mind of others. On the other 
hand, if a majority of you find the plaintiffs have established the elements of their claim by a preponderance of the evidence, 
the other jurors ought to ask themselves again and most thoughtfully whether they are evaluating the evidence under the 
correct preponderance standard or whether they should continue to distrust the weight and sufficiency of evidence which 
convinces their fellow jurors that the elements of the plaintiffs' claims are more likely so than not. The fact each dissenting 
juror entertains some doubt about plaintiffs' claim does not necessarily mean that the plaintiffs have failed to produce a 
preponderance of the evidence to support their claim. Evidence must be evaluated under the correct standard without bias, 
prejudice or sympathy towards any party. One great mistake jurors or juries make in deliberating ofttimes on a verdict in a 
case is injecting an issue into the case which was not brought up or contended for in the courtroom trial or on which there is 
no evidence whatsoever. One good cure for such a misunderstanding and misconduct of a juror or jurors is to carefully read 
the instructions of the Court which focus on the issues to be decided. The Court's instructions contain the advice that a juror 
may use his or her common sense in evaluating facts shown in the evidence. This advice clearly means that if some fact 
asserted is so contrary to human experience and belief, it may be rejected as not true, or if the fact is in accord with such 
ordinary human experience and belief, it may[]be accepted as true. Most of the jurors' mental function is to use his or her 
sense of good judgment to determine the truth, which means determining the believability of evidence admitted by the 
Court. Use of common sense does not include or invite the consideration or introduction of discussions by a juror of a fact, 
situation or issue that's not in this case. Likewise, the permission to use one's common sense does not mean a juror is 
licensed to decide the case any way they wish. The verdict must be based on the belief or disbelief of part or all of the 
evidence that is before you. Let me recite again that at all times no juror is expected to yield a conscientious conviction that "
1383,," he or she may have as to the weight or the effect of the evidence, but you must remember that after full deliberation and 
consideration of the evidence in the case, it is your sworn duty to agree upon a verdict if you can do so. So, again, you may 
be as leisurely in your deliberations as the occasion may required [sic] and you should take all the time you feel that is 
necessary. Having said that, I will then again ask you that you retire once again to the jury room, and please continue your 
deliberations with these additional comments in mind to be applied of course in conjunction with all of the instructions that I 
have previously given you. I don't know if that will help or not but I would ask that each juror take it to heart, read it and reread it if necessary, as you 
come to grips with the decision in this case, if you can do it. I will send you back.  Thank you very much. "
1384,20," Over three and a half months after the verdict was returned, and 10 minutes before hearing oral argument on the post-trial 
motions in this case, I was visited by Mrs. Zelma Greenwood, one of the seven jurors, who delivered a 4-page, handwritten letter 
to me. In her letter, Mrs. Greenwood recanted her verdict, listing a number of ""reasons"" she was ""forced into the decision that 
was given."" (Dkt. 281-82.) Her reasons may be of interest to some, but not me. Mrs. Greenwood proceeded into the courtroom and delivered a copy of her letter to defense counsel Shulman. She offered to 
provide a copy to plaintiffs' counsel but did not bring one with her into the courtroom. (See Dkt. 290, Att'd Aff. of Robert H. 
Rawson, Jr., paras. 3-4.) Mrs. Greenwood remained in the courtroom for most of the hearing, as if to be available for the court's 
inquiry. I announced to all counsel at the outset of the hearing I had just received a troubling communication from one of the 
jurors and would consider its significance, if any, upon completion of oral arguments. (Dkt. 287, Tran. of Motions Proceeding 
Jan. 16, 1987, p. 4.) Mrs. Greenwood's letter parrots defendant's present arguments concerning my supplemental instructions to 
the jury. During the course of oral argument on these points, defense counsel Shulman rather impatiently inquired as to when we 
would address the matter of her letter. (Id., pp. 83-84.) He later denied knowing she was coming to the hearing, stating that so 
far as he was concerned it was simply a ""coincidence"". (Id., p. 145.) In light of my own questions about the import of her letter, I 
shared copies of it with all counsel and asked them to respond as to its effect, if any.  (Id., p. 148.) I occasionally permit lawyers to communicate with jurors, in certain cases, following return of the verdict and the polling of the 
jurors. In my view, lawyers and litigants welcome the occasion to extend their appreciation to the jurors for their time and service. 
But in such an event, and in this case, I first remind the lawyers not to discuss the merits of the case, the reasons underlying any 
of the jury's decisions, or any part of its deliberations. When the verdict was announced to a full courtroom on September 30, 1986, and after the jurors were polled and released from 
service, they were so greeted by the attorneys. Indeed, I myself participated in this, stepping down from the bench to host a 
""receiving line"" of sorts. Each juror passed through this line on the way out of the courtroom. I recall my own salutation to Mrs. 
Greenwood; she exhibited no anxiety about her decision.  She, like the others, seemed relieved and even pleased with her role. Later that evening, as I left my chambers after business hours, I observed defense counsel Shulman and Alioto sitting with Mrs. 
Greenwood in a hallway adjacent to the courtroom. Surprised, I reminded counsel they were not to discuss the case with her. 
One responded, ""Oh, we're not!"" (See also Aff. of Robert H. Rawson, Jr., para. 2.) Recalling these events, and in light of the ""coincidental"" appearance of Mrs. Greenwood at the hearing on January 16, 1987, my 
misgivings heightened. On January 20, 1987, I conferred with United States Attorney Benjamin Burgess and requested that he 
contact juror Greenwood for the limited purposes of determining if anyone encouraged her letter, suggested its content, or 
apprised her of the January 16 hearing. On January 22, Mr. Burgess, accompanied by an FBI agent, met Mrs.  Greenwood for the purposes directed. Mr. Burgess then 
reported to me that defense counsel Shulman and Alioto had returned to Wichita, from Topeka, the day following the verdict and 
met with Mrs. Greenwood at a Grandy's Restaurant located on South Seneca Street. Following that meeting, Mrs.  Greenwood 
called Mr. Shulman's office on at least one occasion to inquire whether he received the ""'first draft'"" of her letter. Approximately "
1385,," one week before oral argument on the post-trial motions, counselor Shulman telephoned Mrs. Greenwood and informed her that 
hearing was scheduled for January 16, at 1:00 p.m. The state courts of Minnesota, where counselor Shulman is licensed to practice, have made it abundantly clear attorneys should 
refrain from contacting jurors in hopes of impeaching a verdict. See Olberg v. Minneapolis Gas Co., 291 Minn. 334, 191 N.W.2d 
418 (1971). Why defense counsel might hope the rule is any different in this court, particularly in light of my two-fold warnings 
not to discuss the merits or the deliberations, is beyond belief. Further, it is axiomatic that where, as here, a jury gives its 
unanimous assent to a verdict, individual jurors will not thereafter be permitted to impeach their verdict. See Fed.R.Evid. 606(b); 
United States v. Miller, 806 F.2d 223 (10th Cir. 1986); United States v. Vannelli, 595 F.2d 402, 407 (8th Cir. 1979); United States 
v. Schroeder, 433 F.2d 846, 851 (8th Cir. 1970), cert. denied 401 U.S. 943, 28 L. Ed. 2d 224, 91 S. Ct. 951 (1971); United 
States v. Chereton, 309 F.2d 197, 200 (6th Cir. 1962), cert. denied 372 U.S. 936, 83 S. Ct. 883, 9 L. Ed. 2d 767 (1963); and 
United States v. 16,000 Acres of Land, etc., 49 F. Supp. 645, 654 (D. Kan. 1942). This inquiry need proceed no further. Defense counsel knowingly and blatantly violated my express rulings to avoid any 
communications with the jurors regarding the case or their deliberations. Adding insult to injury, Mr. Shulman, an officer of this 
court, misrepresented on the record his involvement. This entire matter reeks of fabrication and contrivance, if not obstruction of 
justice. See generally 18 U.S.C. ยง 1503 (influencing a juror), and ยง 1509 (obstruction of court orders). Defendant's motion for an 
evidentiary hearing is overruled; I refuse to lend any credence whatsoever to so-called ""evidence"" obtained in this contemptible 
manner. "
1465,1," The district court's opinion is reported as White v. Rockingham Radiologists, Ltd., 1986-1 Trade Cas. (CCH) P 67,142. "
1467,2," Dr. Canter wrote: The members of the Radiology Department sincerely regret the discomforture to all concerned precipitated by the General 
Staff Meeting last night. It is our position that the Radiology Department should be responsible for the performance and interpretation of the medical 
radiologic imaging procedures performed in our department. We will be very happy to work in consultation with you on any 
cases you so desire. We will be glad to set these cases aside until such time that they can be reviewed at your 
convenience and the convenience of the radiologist. The radiologist will charge for the conduct and interpretation of the 
examination. The above states our position. We await your early reply so that this matter can be resolved as promptly as possible. "
1468,3," The minutes of the meeting of the board disclose the following discussion: Concerns were raised by Board members as to accountability, the potential liability of the Hospital for medical accidents 
resulting from lack of coordination or attention, the management difficulties of supervising fragmented responsibility, and 
whether it was appropriate to permit Dr. White to have a privilege of interpreting head scans when he was not prepared to 
assume the full responsibility for conducting the tests and for interpreting scans other than head scans. Board members 
also questioned whether it was appropriate to have the radiology group responsible for the head scan tests but another 
physician to have the opportunity for interpretation. "
