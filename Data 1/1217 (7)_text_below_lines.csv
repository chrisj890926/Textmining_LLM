33,1," Depending upon their positions at the time, the parties to these lawsuits have used the letters ""L"" and ""A"" with or without 
periods. Whether or not periods are used, the name is always pronounced in two syllables, as two letters. Yet, throughout these 
proceedings, Anheuser-Busch has maintained that the two letters are not initials for anything. In attempting to explain why 
Anheuser-Busch at one time used periods after the letters, Michael Roarty, spokesperson for the Anheuser-Busch LA project, 
testified that: L period A period was simply an effort to get people to pronounce these two letters L A as opposed to La, which we were 
afraid that some people might misinterpret. Transcript at 1131. See also Transcript at 1141, 1145-47. For convenience, the court will use the term ""LA"" without periods throughout this opinion."
33,2," Four days later the Missouri district court issued an order permanently enjoining Stroh from using the ""LA"" mark throughout the 
United States. See Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. Stroh Brewery Company, 587 F. Supp. 330 (E.D. Mo.), aff'd, 750 F.2d 631 (8th Cir. 
1984). "
36,3," Anheuser-Busch Companies, Inc. is the holding company of Anheuser-Busch, Inc. See Transcript at 239, 1324."
36,4," Some of these witnesses were not identified in the parties' final pretrial report and were not otherwise identified by the party 
offering the testimony. Therefore, the court was left to guess the identity of the witnesses from the portions of deposition 
testimony offered. "
38,5," In paragraphs 4 and 5 the parties attempted to stipulate to jurisdiction and venue, which are not ""facts"" but conclusions of law.  
Parties may not stipulate to conclusions of law or confer jurisdiction by consent. See Kanzelberger v. Kanzelberger, 782 F.2d 
774, 776-77 (7th Cir. 1986)."
38,6," Anheuser-Busch later withdrew its agreement to paragraph 11. See Defendant-Counterclaimant's Supplement to the Joint 
Pretrial Report at 2. "
39,7," Some of these findings of fact will duplicate, at least in part, certain of the uncontroverted facts set forth above. However, the 
court's findings will add essential detail to the stipulations."
39,8," Laws and regulations governing alcoholic beverages are more properly the subject of judicial notice. However, this information 
has been included among the court's findings as background information and because the court found that one or more of the 
parties had actual knowledge of these laws and regulations. "
40,9," Mr. Busch testified at his deposition that he first directed the development of a low alcohol beer in the summer or fall of 1983. 
See Transcript at 242. James Buell, director of new product planning and development for Anheuser-Busch, testified that 
development of a low alcohol beer was underway when he joined the company in April of 1982. See Transcript at 126, 129. See 
also Trial Exhibit 758 (trademark search for LA dated February 24, 1981); Transcript at 1360-63, 1456."
40,10," According to David Wood, president of Interbrand, a ""line extension"" is ""the extension of an existing names [sic] into new 
products,"" e.g., BUDWEISER LA. See Transcript at 235-36. See also Transcript at 281-83, 899-902. "
41,11," At his deposition Buell professed not to know the meaning of the term ""line extension."" See Transcript at 181."
41,12," Michael Roarty, spokesperson for the Anheuser-Busch LA project, explained that consultants ""advised that to make an issue 
out of these things would just confuse the marketplace."" Transcript at 1259. See also Transcript at 1141. "
43,13," Anheuser-Busch attempted to prove that it made token use of the L.A. (with periods) mark in interstate commerce on 
December 5, 1983, by offering into evidence a three-page document consisting of an Anheuser-Busch invoice and two cash 
receipts from a dealer, Illinois Distributing Company. See Transcript at 1366-1434. See also Trial Exhibit 764 (not received). 
Because of lack of foundation and lack of indicia of reliability, the court refused to receive the third page of the exhibit. See 
Transcript at 1408. Moreover, substantial doubts were raised about the reliability of the other two pages. For example, the 
invoice described the beer shipped as containing 5% alcohol, indicating that it was not a low alcohol beer, which would contain 
1.8% alcohol. Arch Ahern, associate general counsel of Anheuser-Busch Companies, Inc., testified that this misdescription was 
made ""to shield the fact that there were any shipments of low alcohol beer being made from other employees within the 
company . . . ."" Id.  at 1412. See also Transcript at 1426-34; Trial Exhibits 765, 766 (not received) (purported records of token 
shipment of beer labeled with LA (without periods) mark made on January 20, 1984)."
43,14," Russell Cleary, chief executive officer of the G. Heileman Brewing Company, testified that he thought Heileman's LA beers 
were being sold in Illinois and other midwestern states in April or May of 1984. See Transcript at 365-66, 467-68. However, this 
belief was not supported by the shipping documents received in evidence. See Trial Exhibit 379. "
44,15," As terms of art in the field of trademark law, ""senior user"" denotes ""the first seller to adopt and use a mark in the United 
States,"" and ""junior user"" denotes ""the second seller to adopt the mark, even though the junior user may be the first in time 
within a given remote territory."" 1 J.  McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair Competition ยง 26:1 at 204 (1973). "
46,16," Anheuser-Busch's use was exclusive with the exception of Stroh's use of the mark on SHAEFER LA which was briefly 
marketed in one town in Texas. See Transcript at 496, 2112. See also Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. Stroh Brewery Company, 587 F. 
Supp. 330, 338 (E.D. Mo.), aff'd, 750 F.2d 631 (8th Cir. 1984). "
48,17," See e.g., Transcript at 168, 179, 1097, 1105-06, 1112-13, 1133, 1138, 1165, 1169, 1177-78, 1182, 1187-88, 1193, 1195, 
1199, 1319-22, 1333, 1339, 2175, 2187, 2201-02, 2221-23. The court regards these preemption statements as little more than 
sales promotion bluster, even though Heileman and Miller attempted to endow them with a sinister connotation throughout the 
trial. "
49,18," The court notes that Heileman's Certificate of Interest and other forms usually filed simultaneously with the Complaint were 
filed at 4:12 P.M. on April 18, 1984."
49,19," See Findings of Fact in Part III(C)(3), above. "
50,20," Light beer is a low calorie beer. See Transcript at 50-51, 157, 423. Light beer is a recognized segment of the beer industry 
among consumers. See Transcript at 51, 279, 435, 882, 1164. Heileman and Anheuser-Busch positioned their LA beers to 
compete with Miller LITE. See Transcript at 244-45, 2064-65, 2075, 2089-92, 2193. See also Trial Exhibit 301. "
51,21," The Federal Trademark Act of 1946 is popularly known as the Lanham Trademark Act. This is the name which will be used 
throughout this opinion. "
52,22," HN2[
] The term ""trademark"" includes any word, name, symbol, or device or any combination thereof adopted and used by a 
manufacturer or merchant to identify and distinguish his goods, including a unique product, from those manufactured or sold by 
others and to indicate the source of the goods, even if that source is unknown. See 15 U.S.C.A. ยง 1127 (1982 West & Supp. 
1987). See also Eagle Snacks, Inc. v. Nabisco Brands, Inc., 625 F. Supp. 571, 579 (D.N.J. 1985). "
57,23," The Restatement (Second) of Torts in its final form does not have sections dealing with the fields of unfair competition and 
trade regulation. The American Law Institute takes the position that these fields have evolved into bodies of law in their own 
right, no longer dependent upon tort law. Nevertheless, the Restatement test continues to be followed by Wisconsin's and other 
states' courts. See American Association for the Advancement of Science v. Hearst Corporation, 498 F. Supp. 244, 259 n.5 
(D.D.C. 1980). "
61,24," Products that are similar to each other or that are substitutes for each other display positive cross-elasticity. That is, if the price 
of ""A"" remains constant, an increase in the price of ""B"" will generate more sales of ""A"" as buyers switch to it. High cross-elasticity 
means that if the price of ""A"" remains constant, an X% increase in the price of ""B"" will generate a greater X% increase in the 
sales of ""A."" See Photovest Corporation v. Fotomat Corporation, 606 F.2d 704, 713 n.12 (7th Cir. 1979), cert.  denied, 445 U.S. 
917, 63 L. Ed. 2d 601, 100 S. Ct. 1278 (1980). "
62,25," Other circuits allow the proponent of the sham exception to meet the lesser, preponderance of the evidence quantum of proof. 
See, e.g., Litton Systems, Inc. v. American Telephone and Telegraph Company, 700 F.2d 785, 813-14 (2d Cir. 1983), cert. 
denied, 464 U.S. 1073, 79 L. Ed. 2d 220, 104 S. Ct. 984 (1984). "
63,26," But see Coca-Cola Company v. Overland, Inc., 692 F.2d 1250, 1257 n.17 (9th Cir. 1982) (noting that the court had discovered 
no case directly supporting the proposition that the bringing of meritorious trademark infringement suits can constitute sham 
suits violative of the antitrust laws). "
64,27," Declaratory judgment actions involving trademarks are analogous to those involving patents. Thus, guidance in trademark 
cases is often taken from patent cases. See Windsurfing International, Inc. v. AMF Incorporated, 828 F.2d 755, 757 (Fed. Cir. 
1987). "
65,28," Although Heileman and Miller could have filed an opposition to registration in the Patent and Trademark Office pursuant to 15 
U.S.C.A. ยง 1063 (West Supp. 1987), the record does not reveal that they did so.  Instead, they have attempted to accomplish the 
same ends in this court."
65,29," In general, an actual trademark infringer is allowed to seek relief under the Declaratory Judgments Act when there is a 
trademark infringement controversy because: One who is subjected to charges of infringement and the threat of legal proceedings need not wait until his accuser 
chooses to bring suit to secure a determination of his rights. One of the purposes of the Declaratory Judgments Act is to 
avoid the unfairness of allowing one party to create a controversy by making such charges but, by withholding suit, to 
prevent the other party from conclusively refuting them. Topp-Cola Company v. Coca-Cola Company, 314 F.2d 124, 125 (2d Cir. 1963)."
65,30," Section 43 (a) of the Lanham Trademark Act provides that: HN48[
] Any person who shall affix, apply, or annex, or use in connection with any goods or services, or any container or 
containers for goods, a false designation of origin, or any false description or representation, including words or other 
symbols tending falsely to describe or represent the same, and shall cause such goods or services to enter into commerce, "
66,," and any person who shall with knowledge of the falsity of such designation or origin or description or representation cause 
or procure the same to be transported or used in commerce or deliver the same to any carrier to be transported or used, 
shall be liable to a civil action by any person doing business in the locality falsely indicated as that of origin or in the region 
in which said locality is situated, or by any person who believes that he is or is likely to be damaged by the use of any false 
description or representation."
66,15, U.S.C. ยง 1125(a).
66,31," There is no appellate decision affirming the Chromium Industries judgment and the ruling regarding standing has never been 
cited as authority or precedent in any Seventh Circuit appellate decision. But see Exxon Corporation v. Humble Exploration 
Company, Inc., 695 F.2d 96, 103 n.10 (5th Cir. 1983); Johnson & Johnson v. Carter-Wallace, Inc., 631 F.2d 186, 189 (2d Cir. 
1980). Moreover, the Chromium Industries court applied its standing test in the context of a threshold motion to dismiss. The 
court ruled that, although the parties were competitors, the plaintiff had not alleged an injury even under its broadly construed 
test for standing because it had ""not alleged that it currently uses or is likely to use this term [""easy release""] in its marketing 
efforts."" Chromium Industries, 448 F. Supp. at 556. "
68,32," The only exceptions are Heileman's request for a judgment declaring that it is not unfairly competing with Anheuser-Busch 
under any Wisconsin Statute, see Complaint [of the G. Heileman Brewing Company] at para. 23(c), and Anheuser-Busch's claim 
for relief under the Illinois Anti-Dilution Act, see Answer to Amended Complaint and Amended Counterclaim at para. 29; Answer 
and Counterclaim at para. 24. "
71,33," It is the burden of the proffering party to prove the quality of survey evidence. However, even though a survey may not meet 
all criteria, the results may still be admitted and given lesser weight. See SquirtCo v. Seven-Up Company, 628 F.2d 1086, 1091 
(8th Cir. 1980); American Home Products Corporation v. Barr Laboratories, Inc., 656 F. Supp. 1058, 1062 (D.N.J. 1987)."
71,34," The promotional material used the phrases ""light in alcohol,"" ""half the alcohol,"" or ""reduced alcohol,"" but not ""low alcohol."" See 
Transcript at 1546. "
72,35," The Wind survey respondents were not tested to determine what they understood by the concept ""brand name."" See 
Transcript at 1568-70. Many courts have recommended the methodology of the survey conducted in the case of E.I. DuPont de 
Nemours & Company v. Yoshida International, Inc., 393 F. Supp. 502 (E.D.N.Y. 1975) in which the term ""Teflon"" was at issue. 
That survey offered the examples of ""Chevrolet"" to illustrate what it meant by a brand name and ""automobile"" to illustrate what it 
meant by a product type.  Then, respondents were asked to classify other brand names and product names among which was 
""Teflon."" However, other courts have cautioned that this type of test is helpful only when the distinction between the brand name 
and the product genus is obvious. See A.J. Canfield Company v. Honickman, 808 F.2d 291, 303 (3d Cir. 1986). These courts 
have expressed doubts that any consumer survey can be helpful when a category descriptor is used as a brand name. See Id. 
at 302."
72,36," A trademark has a dual function if it identifies particular product characteristics while at the same time indicating its source. 
See A.J.  Canfield v. Honickman, 808 F.2d 291, 300 (3d Cir. 1986); American Thermos Products Company v. Aladdin Industries, 
Inc., 207 F. Supp. 9, 20 (D. Conn. 1962), aff'd. sub nom.  King-Seeley Thermos Company v. Aladdin Industries, Inc., 321 F.2d 
577 (2d Cir. 1963)."
72,37," LA from Anheuser-Busch and at least one other low alcohol beer was being sold in each of the survey sites. See Transcript at 
1864-69. "
73,38," See Loctite Corporation v. National Starch and Chemical Corporation, 516 F. Supp. 190, 206 (S.D.N.Y. 1981) (criticizing a 
primary significance survey in which test subjects were not shown the products of each party)."
73,39," The survey results appear to have been somewhat stretched to reach a percentage over 50%. Multiple answers given by a 
single respondent were all tallied. See Transcript at 531. Seventeen percent gave answers that fell into more than one category, 
see Transcript at 608, leading to numerous discretionary coding decisions which were challenged by the defendant. See 
Transcript at 569-633."
73,40," When all 536 interviewees are considered, 50.2% (269) stated that LA means low alcohol. See Transcript at 716. "
74,41," Recently, the Seventh Circuit has explained that ""an adjective can be generic term when that word is a part of a common 
descriptive name of a kind of goods. In order to be generic, however (as the word implies), the word in question must serve to 
denominate a type, a kind, a genus or a subcategory of goods."" Henri's Food Products Company, Inc. v. Tasty Snacks, Inc., 817 
F.2d 1303, 1305-06 (7th Cir. 1987) (footnote omitted)."
74,42," The court determined that ""chocolate fudge soda"" rather than ""soda"" or ""chocolate soda"" was the product genus and held that: 
""If a producer introduces a product that differs from an established product class in a particular characteristic, and uses a 
common descriptive term of that characteristic as the name of the product, then the product should be considered its own genus. 
Whether the term that identifies the product is generic then depends on the competitors' need to use it."" A.J. Canfield Company, 
808 F.2d at 305-06. "
75,43," The plaintiffs attempted to show that LA and ""low alcohol"" were generic terms within the beer industry and that LA had gained 
currency as a category descriptor for beer in Australia. See, e.g., Transcript at 51-54, 68, 109-16, 240-42, 415, 944-48, 959, 
2212-13, 2225-28. See also Trial Exhibits 74, 77, 100, 101, 102, 103, 400, 401, 426, 427. However, industry and foreign usage 
are not indicative of a term's generic use by ordinary consumers. See Big O Tire Dealers v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, 
561 F.2d 1365, 1369 (10th Cir. 1977) (industry usage not determinative), cert.  denied, 434 U.S. 1052, 54 L. Ed. 2d 805, 98 S. 
Ct. 905 (1978); Donald F.  Duncan, Inc. v. Royal Tops Manufacturing Company, Inc., 343 F.2d 655, 661-62 (7th Cir. 1965) 
(generic use of term ""yo-yo"" in Philippine Islands not dispositive of whether ""yo-yo"" is generic among consumers in the United 
States)."
75,44," At the time LA beer was introduced there was merely a hope or expectation by those entering the low alcohol field that LA 
would become a product category. In its introductory stage, LA beer was little more than a fad. ""One can capitalize on a market 
or fad created by another provided that it is not accomplished by confusing the public into mistakenly purchasing the product in 
the belief that the product is the product of the competitor."" American Footwear Corporation v. General Footwear Company, 
Limited, 609 F.2d 655, 662 (2d Cir. 1979) (term ""bionic"" could be used in the absence of confusion). See also International Order 
of Job's Daughters v. Lindeburg and Company, 633 F.2d 912, 919 (9th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 452 U.S. 941, 69 L. Ed. 2d 956, 
101 S. Ct. 3086 (1981). "
76,45," In the Miller LITE litigation, the court of appeals relied heavily on a standard dictionary definition of ""light"" in ruling that ""LITE"" 
(or light) is a common descriptor for beer. See Miller Brewing Company v. G.  Heileman Brewing Company, 561 F.2d 75, 80-81 
(7th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1025, 54 L. Ed. 2d 772, 98 S. Ct. 751 (1978). In the instant case none of the parties 
presented evidence that either ""LA"" or ""low alcohol"" is defined by any lexicon as a type of beer. "
77,46," The dictionary defines ""initial"" as: ""Denoting the first letter or letters of a word."" American Heritage Dictionary of the English 
Language 676 (1969). ""Denote"" is defined as: ""To refer to specifically; mean explicitly."" Id. at 353. In contrast ""connote"" means: 
""To suggest or imply in addition to literal meaning."" Id. at 283. In the Stroh case, the district court stated that: It is apparent from the [Wind] study that consumers do not generally recognize the term LA to immediately connote low 
alcohol when they see such on plaintiff's product. Rather, it is this Court's opinion that the study supports a conclusion that 
LA, when placed prominently on a can of beer as the sole brand name, stands for an idea which requires some operation of 
the imagination to connect it with the product, and therefore is suggestive in nature. Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. Stroh Brewery Company, 587 F. Supp. 330, 337 (E.D. Mo.), aff'd, 750 F.2d 631 (8th Cir. 1984) 
(emphasis supplied). It is well-established that ""[a] term is suggestive if it requires imagination, thought and perception to reach a 
conclusion as to the nature of the goods."" Abercrombie & Fitch v. Hunting World, Inc., 537 F.2d 4, 11 (2d Cir. 1976); Gear, Inc. 
v. L.A. Gear California, Inc., 670 F. Supp. 508, 514 (S.D.N.Y. 1987). However, the ""imagination, thought and perception"" refers 
to the mental process required to connect a name that is incongruous or figurative with the product (e.g., ""Roach Motel"" with an 
insect trap or ""TIDE"" with soap), not the intermediate thought process needed to translate initials into the name which directly 
describes the salient characteristic of the product. The Missouri court also referred to ""LA"" as an acronym. See Anheuser-Busch, 587 F. Supp. at 334-35 & n.7. However, ""LA"" is 
not a true a acronym which is a ""word formed from the initial letters of a name."" See American Heritage Dictionary of the English 
Language 12. As noted throughout this opinion, the initials ""L"" ""A"" are not used or pronounced as a word when they are applied 
to beer. A true acronym could be a word which is arbitrary or suggestive on its own without reference to the underlying words. 
See, e.g., Merritt Forbes & Company Incorporated v. Newman Investment Securities, Inc., 604 F. Supp. 943, 955-56 (S.D.N.Y. 
1985) (denying summary judgment because the acronym ""TOP's"" standing for the generic term ""tender option security program,"" 
may conceivably constitute a valid and protectible service mark). In contrast, ""LA"" is nothing more than initials."
77,47," Reporters have even joined in this play. See Trial Exhibit 493 (Advertising Age headline from August 23, 1984, proclaiming 
""Light Audience so far for 'L.A.'""). "
78,48," A few courts in other districts have advanced the proposition that the abbreviation itself must have become generic or 
descriptive by virtue of being commonly understood in order to be ineligible for trademark status. See, e.g., Merritt Forbes & 
Company Incorporated v. Newman Investment Securities, Inc., 604 F. Supp. 943, 956 (S.D.N.Y. 1985) (and cases cited therein); 
Kampgrounds of America v. North Delaware A-OK Campground, Inc., 415 F. Supp. 1288, 1292 (D. Del. 1976) (and cases cited 
therein). However, in Merritt Forbes and in Kampgrounds of America more than merely initials were at issue. In Merritt Forbes 
the initials formed an acronym, TOP's, while in Kampgrounds, the KOA mark was deemed protectible when considered in 
combination with other aspects of trade dress. These cases fail to recognize that initials are merely short forms of the words for 
which they stand and should be accorded the same degree of protection as those words. In another case cited by the defendant, Modern Optics v. Univis Lens Company, 43 C.C.P.A. 970, 234 F.2d 504 (C.C.P.A. 
1956), the court ruled that the initials ""CV,"" standing for continuous vision, were not merely descriptive of trifocal lenses. The 
court reasoned that trifocal lenses had been sold for over fifty years without the terms ""continuous vision"" or ""CV"" being used to 
describe them. Id. at 505. Thus, the court found that the term ""CV"" was neither the necessary nor the obvious descriptor for the 
product. In contrast, ""LA"" was used from the outset to describe the unique characteristic of the new type of beer. "
80,49," The defendant also suggests that even those people who named different sources for each beer should have been asked 
whether they thought the different sources were part of the same company. See Transcript at 818-25. The court finds no merit to 
this proposal, since this was not a survey of consumers' knowledge of corporate structures. "
81,50," The plaintiffs have not pressed these unfair competition claims in their posttrial summations or briefs. Therefore, it appears 
that these claims have been abandoned. See 20 th Century Wear, Inc. v. Sanmark-Stardust, Inc., 747 F.2d 81, 92 & n.14 (2d 
Cir. 1984), cert.  denied, 470 U.S. 1052, 84 L. Ed. 2d 818, 105 S. Ct. 1755 (1985); Fogel v. Chestnutt, 533 F.2d 731, 738 n.7 
(2d Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 824, 50 L. Ed. 2d 86, 97 S. Ct. 77 (1976); E.S. Originals Inc. v. Stride Rite Corporation, 
656 F. Supp. 484, 485 & n.1, 491 & n.13 (S.D.N.Y. 1987). Even if the plaintiffs do not consider these claims abandoned, the 
court, in its ruling above, concludes that they are not entitled to relief. "
83,51," Courts have ruled that even a single sham lawsuit can serve as the basis for a cognizable claim under Section 2 of the 
Sherman Act. See, e.g., MCI Communications v. American Telephone and Telegraph Company, 708 F.2d 1081, 1155 (7th Cir.), 
cert. denied, 464 U.S. 891, 78 L. Ed. 2d 226, 104 S. Ct. 234 (1983). However, such claims have been notably unsuccessful in 
the context of trademark and copyright litigation. See Coca-Cola Company v. Overland, Inc., 692 F.2d 1250, 2157 n.17 (9th Cir. 
1982) (""We merely pause to note that we have found no case directly supporting the proposition that the bringing of meritorious 
suits can constitute sham suits violative of the antitrust laws.""). See also Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. v. Redd Horne, Inc., 
749 F.2d 154, 161 (3d Cir. 1984) (""a good faith attempt to enforce a copyright does not violate the antitrust laws""); Alberto-
Culver Company v. Andrea Dumon, Inc., 466 F.2d 705, 711 (7th Cir. 1972) (""plaintiff's good faith effort to enforce its copyright 
and trademark is not the kind of exclusionary conduct condemned by ยง 2 of the Sherman Act""); Drop Dead Company v. S.C. 
Johnson & Son, Inc., 326 F.2d 87, 96 (9th Cir. 1963) (registering multiple marks for wax products, mass advertising, mass sales 
and bringing of colorable infringement suits are lawful acts which do not ""constitute the sort of aggressive competition and 
promotion that antitrust law seeks to protect, particularly within the limits of lawful monopolies granted by Congress""); Toro 
Company v. R & R Products Company, 600 F. Supp. 400, 401-02 (D. Minn. 1984) (""The good faith attempt to protect a copyright 
interest, even if unsuccessful, is a defense to an action for attempted monopolization.""), aff'd, 787 F.2d 1208 (8th Cir. 1986); 
Car-Freshner Corporation v. Auto Aid Manufacturing Corporation, 438 F. Supp. 82, 87 (N.D.N.Y. 1977) ("". . . under any set of 
facts which could be proven by the defendants in support of their antitrust counterclaim, the acts of the plaintiffs in registering 
and enforcing the trademark in issue did not create a dangerous probability that the plaintiff would gain monopoly power in the 
market for auto air freshners. Rather, the acts complained of merely represent fair and aggressive competition which does not 
constitute a violation of the antitrust laws.""); Armstrong Cork Company v. Armstrong Plastic Covers Company, 434 F. Supp. 860, 
872 (E.D. Mo. 1977) (""good faith enforcement by the plaintiff of its trademark rights does not constitute an antitrust violation or a 
trademark misuse""); Sam S. Goldstein Industries, Inc. v. General Electric Company, 264 F. Supp. 403, 406 (S.D.N.Y. 1967) 
(plaintiff's antitrust claim that defendant, by seeking to monopolize the word ""Americana"" as a trademark, seeks to render it 
impossible for any other company to represent that its products are American in origin is patently frivolous). In contrast, misuse of patent claims have met with more success. See, e.g., Walker Process Equipment, Inc. v. Food Machinery 
& Chemical Corporation, 382 U.S. 172, 15 L. Ed. 2d 247, 86 S. Ct. 347 (1965). In Alberto-Culver Company v. Andrea Dumon, 
Inc., 295 F. Supp. 1155, 1158 (N.D. Ill. 1969), aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 466 F.2d 705 (7th Cir. 1972), the court explained that 
""the consequences of a label copyright or trademark infringement case are different than those of a patent infringement case"" in 
which a claimant is more likely to prevail on antitrust grounds. The owner of a patent is granted a monopoly over a particular 
product or invention, while the owner of a trademark merely acquires rights to a name. See Calvin Klein Cosmetics Corporation 
v. Lenox Laboratories, 815 F.2d 500, 503 (8th Cir. 1987). Thus, a patent owner can exclude competitors from marketing a 
particular product, whereas a trademark owner can only exclude competitors from using a particular name. Even if Heileman and 
Miller were not able to use the LA name, they could still market low alcohol beers under other names."
83,52," An antitrust plaintiff has the burden of proving that the defendant possessed sufficient power to come dangerously close to 
achieving monopoly power and the plaintiff must also prove the boundaries of the relevant geographic and product markets 
within which that dangerous probability occurred. See Photovest Corporation v. Fotomat Corporation, 606 F.2d 704, 711-13 (7th 
Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 445 U.S. 917, 100 S. Ct. 1278, 63 L. Ed. 2d 601 (1980). Anheuser-Busch maintains that the relevant 
product market is simply beer. See Defendant-Counterclaimant's (""Busch"") Pretrial Memorandum of Law at 21-22. "
84,53," Heileman tried to change its position in the instant case. On direct examination Heileman's chief executive officer Russell 
Cleary was asked: ""Does your low-calorie products or do your low-calorie products have low alcohol?"" Cleary answered, ""No.""

93,1," Because this Act is sui generis to the soft drink industry, we need not analyze at length the many cases on which Pennsylvania 
relies. Thus, even if the holding of Cernuto Inc. v. United Cabinet Co., 595 F.2d 164 (3d Cir. 1979), survives the holding and 
rationale of Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Serv. Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775, 104 S. Ct. 1464 (1984), it is of no help. In 
Cernuto, there were no exclusive territories. The supplier had two competing dealers in the same area and the first dealer 
allegedly undertook to eliminate the second. The same was true in Tunis Bros. Co. v. Ford Motor Co., 763 F.2d 1482 (3d Cir. 
1985), vacated and remanded, 475 U.S. 1105, 106 S. Ct. 1509, 89 L. Ed. 2d 909 (1986), on remand 823 F.2d 49 (3d Cir. 1987). 
In United States v. General Motors Corp., 384 U.S. 127, 16 L. Ed. 2d 415, 86 S. Ct. 1321 (1966), the supplier had many dealers. 
Some of them discounted and the non-discounters persuaded the supplier to take action against the discounters. Pennsylvania's 
so-called group boycott cases are not relevant either. These spring from scenarios in which a group of competitors hatched a 
plan to eliminate a competitor at the same level of competition among themselves. They then issued ultimatums to all the "
94,," suppliers or customers in their market. See St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Bamy, 438 U.S. 531, 57 L. Ed. 2d 932, 98 S. Ct. 
2923 (1978); Los Angeles Meat & Provision Drivers Union v. United States, 371 U.S. 94, 9 L. Ed. 2d 150, 83 S. Ct. 162 (1961); 
Radiant Burners, Inc. v. Peoples Gas Light & Coal Co., 364 U.S. 656, 5 L. Ed. 2d 358, 81 S. Ct. 365 (1961); Fashion Originators' 
Guild v. FTC, 312 U.S. 457, 85 L. Ed. 949, 61 S. Ct. 703 (1941); Paramount Famous Lasky Corp. v. United States, 282 U.S. 30, 
75 L. Ed. 145, 51 S. Ct. 42 (1930). "
104,1, As opposed to standard commodities such as salt or wheat. 
105,2," This necessary motion practice is particularly offensive where, as here, defendant raised objections to the legal sufficiency of 
plaintiff's pleading at the initial pretrial conference before this Court; the Court instructed the parties to meet and candidly review 
the complaint together; defendant spelled out to plaintiff informally all of the arguments that it eventually had to make formally to 
this Court; and the plaintiff chose merely to stand, on its pleading without amendment. This waste of both the Court's and 
opposing counsel's time is not acceptable. "
114,1," Motions are also pending to exclude certain testimony of plaintiffs' expert witnesses and to bar use of certain government 
reports. Because these motions have not been argued and because these motions concern rulings which may be more 
appropriately addressed immediately prior to or during trial, these motions will be addressed by Judge Wolin, the judge to whom 
this case has been re-assigned. For the purpose of this opinion, all evidence submitted by both parties is assured to be 
admissible."
114,2," Because of the mass of supporting material accompanying the parties' motions, citations in most instances are to the 
appropriate briefs, which in turn cite to the supporting data."
114,3," Gulfstream business jets are manufactured by the Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation, an American aircraft manufacturer. 
(Plaintiffs' Mem.  at 1, n. 1.) Gulfstream Aerospace and defendant Falcon Jet Corporation are two of the alleged co-conspirators 
which exchanged price information with the other business jet manufacturers."
114,4, Mr. Rosefielde has not purchased or sold any aircraft personally.  (Defendants' Mem. at 8.)
114,5, Falcon Jet did not subject the Rosefielde contracts to price escalation. (Defendants' Mem. at 15.) 
115,6," The Gulfstream case was filed in the Central District of California in June, 1985. (Defendants' Mem. at 12.)"
115,7," The operative facts of count sixteen are identical to the price-fixing conspiracy alleged in the Gulfstream case. (Defendants' 
Mem.  at 12.)"
115,8," Judge Lacey subsequently retired from the bench. The Rosefielde case was then transferred to Judge Barry, who consolidated 
Rosefielde and Gulfstream in April, 1986 in this district. "
116,9," Prior to 1980 the BJAR was published by Rockwell International. In that year, Rockwell ceased selling business jets, so the 
compilation and distribution of the BJAR was taken over by Falcon Jet."
116,10," See also, Report of Plaintiffs' Economic Expert Richard J. Barber, dated June 28, 1985 (""Barber Report"") at 31-34.)"
116,11," The relevant period of this lawsuit is roughly 1978 through 1982, the years during which defendants and other business jet 
manufacturers allegedly agreed to fix prices. (10/19/87 Tr. at 101.) "
118,12," HN6[
] Section 1 of the Sherman Act states, in pertinent part: Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the 
several states . . . is declared to be illegal. "
119,13," Plaintiffs admit there is no direct evidence of an express agreement to fix prices in the industry (see 10/18/87 Tr. at 97); 
therefore, defendants are granted summary judgment with respect to the existence of an express agreement to fix prices. 
However, plaintiffs argue the information exchange itself facilitated a tacit agreement to adhere to the prices exchanged. (Id. at 
100.)"
119,14," HN12[
] In markets which are oligopolistic, where the competition is for a fungible product, and demand is inelastic, the 
exchange of price information has the anticompetitive effect of stabilizing prices. See Container, 393 U.S. at 337; Gypsum, 438 
U.S. at 426, 457. But, where the exchange of information takes place in a market which is competitive, where the product is not 
fungible, competition is based on quality rather than price, and the market is elastic, then no anticompetitive effect exists. See, 
Von Kalinowski, 16A Business Organizations, ยง 6A.02[2] n. 58. "
120,15," See, Plaintiffs' Mem. at 13 (""Since at least the early 1970's, defendants and the other seven manufacturers of business jets 
sold in the United States exchanged among themselves on a regular quid pro quo basis large amounts of information on their 
current and future prices."")"
120,16, See 10/19/87 Tr. at 101. 
121,17," Both plaintiffs and defendants cite to the ITC Report. (Defendants' Mem. at 3, 16, 28; Plaintiffs' Reply to Defendants' 
Memorandum of 11/12/86, dated 12/10/86 (""Plaintiffs' Reply"") at 15.)"
121,18," The one point on which plaintiffs' and defendants' experts agree is that demand for business jets rose steadily from 1976, 
peaked in 1979, and then declined steadily to a low in 1982. Plaintiffs' expert Barber reports that 346 aircraft were ordered by 
customers in 1979, while in 1982 that number dropped to 65 orders. (Barber Report at 20.) Defendants' expert Adelman 
measures demand by quarterly sales. In the first part of 1979, sales were approximately 130 contracts per quarter, while in the 
third quarter of 1982 sales hit a low of 15 planes. (Adler Report at 35.)"
121,19," The Barber Report does not present an analysis of the relative market shares of the competing business jet manufacturers. 
Although Mr.  Barber recognizes the possibility of such an analysis, he relies solely upon abstract calculations to determine 
market concentration. (Barber Report at 13-17.) The Barber Report does not address directly the fluctuation of market shares. 
(p. 24, n. 11.) For example, according to the Adelman Report, Falcon Jet's market share in the years 1977 through 1983 was 
19.0%, 12.3%, 16.4%, 28.3% (industry leader), 13.2%, 13.3% and 17.2%, assuming the plaintiffs' market definition (Table I), or 
3.8%, 4.1%, 3.6%, 7.5%, 8.5%, 17.3% (industry leader), and 8.0%, including sales of used business jets. (Table 6.) "
122,20," Because the opportunity to compete over factors other than price is present in this context, a complex system of discovering 
and penalizing such deviations would also have to be arranged. Clark, supra. There is no direct evidence of such a system; 
however, plaintiffs argue the alleged co-conspirators gave ""mutual assurances"" there would be no discounts.  (10/19/87 Tr. at 
109.)"
122,21," HN17[
] Granting summary judgment in an antitrust action is disfavored when issues of motive and intent are central to the 
case.  Poller v. CBS, 368 U.S. 464, 473, 7 L. Ed. 2d 458, 82 S. Ct. 486 (1962). But see, Anderson, 106 S. Ct. at 2514; Zenith v. 
Matsushita, 513 F. Supp. at 1144. In granting summary judgment for the defendants in an extremely complex antitrust litigation, 
Judge Becker in Zenith v. Matsushita, noted The number of antitrust cases the Supreme Court and courts in the Third Circuit have granted or upheld the grant of 
summary judgment on the merits, either partial or complete, since the Poller decision in 1962 is extremely large. It is now 
settled that summary judgment is appropriate in those antitrust cases where plaintiffs, after having engaged in extensive 
discovery, fail to produce ""significant probative evidence"" in support of the allegations in their complaint. "
123,513," F. Supp. at 1140 (footnote omitted). In the instant action, where the plaintiffs have met their burden of proof to support the 
inference of an anticompetitive intent to exchange prices Poller does prevent the grant of summary judgment for defendants with 
respect to the intent issue. "
124,22," Courts subsequent to the Container case have distinguished its per se rule when the facts of the instant dispute do not fit the 
Container holding because the product is not fungible. See Belliston v. Texaco, Inc., 455 F.2d 175, 181 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 
408 U.S. 928, 33 L. Ed. 2d 341, 92 S. Ct. 2494 (1972); Flav-O-Rich, Inc. v. North Carolina Milk Comm'n, 593 F. Supp. 13, 15 
(E.D.N.C. 1983). Cf.  L.C.L. Theatres, Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Industries, 421 F. Supp. 1090, 1096 (N.D. Tex. 1976), aff'd, 566 
F.2d 494 (5th Cir. 1978) (distinguishing Container where the product is inter alia not fungible). See also Note, Antitrust 
Implications of the Exchange of Price Information Among Competitors, 68 Mich. L. Rev. 720, 722 (1970)."
124,23," Elasticity is an economic concept reflecting the effect an increase in prices will have on the demand for a product. The concept 
of elasticity, like that of relevant market depends almost entirely upon the degree to which products are interchangeable. A 
product which is said to be price elastic has many substitutes. A slight increase in price of a price elastic product will result in a 
large drop in demand as customers begin to use the substitute product. Inelastic products do not have substitutes. An increase 
in price of an inelastic product will result in a relatively small drop in demand because most customers would rather use the 
product at a higher price than forego its use at all. In this case, the elasticity of the business jet industry may depend upon the extent to which used business jets may be used for 
the same purposes as new business jets. If the two products are interchangeable, as defendants argue, (Defendants' Mem. at 
28), then the demand for new business jets would most likely be price elastic; price increases for new business jets would simply 
compel purchasers to buy retrofitted used business jets. (See Adelman Report at 18-20.) The interchangeability of used and new 
business jet aircraft is one of the factual issues which cannot be resolved as a matter of law based on the evidence present in 
the record. Therefore, a determination of the demand elasticity of new business jets is impossible to make at this time."
124,24," Subsequent to the Container decision, the Supreme Court explicitly stated ""the dissemination of price information is not itself a 
per se violation of the Sherman Act."" United States v. Citizens & Southern National Bank, 422 U.S. 86, 113, 45 L. Ed. 2d 41, 95 
S. Ct. 2099 (1975) (citing, inter alia, Container, 393 U.S. at 338 (concurring opinion); see also Gypsum 438 U.S. at 441 n. 16; 
Zenith Radio v. Matsushita, 513 F. Supp. at 1152-53. Therefore, if the per se rule of Container is to be followed, it must be 
closely tailored to the facts pattern of that case. See Container, 393 U.S. at 338. "
125,25," Plaintiffs' reading of Gypsum is strained when they argue that even in a non-oligopolistic market, the exchange of current and 
future prices constitutes a per se violation of section one of the Sherman Act. (Plaintiffs' Mem. at 57.) Plaintiffs cite Gypsum, 438 
U.S. at 441, n. 16, in support of their proposition. However, the passage they quote clearly states the exchange of current price 
information is ""not per se unlawful"" without a showing of an anticompetitive effect. Id. As will be shown, there is sufficient dispute 
of material fact on the issue of anticompetitive effect to preclude establishing a per se violation."
125,26," In United States v. E.I. DuPont De Nemours & Co., 351 U.S. 377, 395, 100 L. Ed. 1264, 76 S. Ct. 994 (1956), the Supreme 
Court states that HN19[
] in determining what constitutes a relevant market ""no more definite rule can be declared than that 
commodities reasonably interchangeable by consumers for the same purposes make up"" the relevant market. Accord Rothery 
Storage and Van Co. v. Atlas Van Lines, 253 U.S. App. D.C. 142, 792 F.2d 210 (D.C. Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1033, 
107 S. Ct. 880, 93 L. Ed. 2d 834 (1987); Hudson's Bay, 651 F. Supp. at 834-835. The relevant market must be determined in 
terms of both product and geographic markets.  Brown Shoe Co. v. U.S., 370 U.S. 294, 324, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510, 82 S. Ct. 1502 
(1962). Plaintiffs claim the geographic market in this case is the United States. (Plaintiffs' Mem. at 32.) The defendants do not 
appear to dispute this issue, however they vigorously contend plaintiffs' definition of the relevant product market. "
126,27," As well, the impact of resales of new business jets appears to be a consideration."
126,28, Defendants' Mem. at 32-37; Defendants' Reply at 17-25. 
127,29," Mr. Barber admitted in his deposition, however, that there was no express agreement among manufacturers to adhere to the 
exchanged prices.  (Barber Tr. at 501-502.) "
128,30," Defendants do not claim that plaintiffs lack standing to assert their claims with respect to all of the aircraft they purchased from 
Falcon Jet. (Defendants' Reply at 60 (""Defendants have never challenged the standing of Rose Associates as a direct purchaser 
of Falcon 50-81. . . ."")).  Therefore, the standing argument is really a question of whether plaintiffs can show they were injured 
through certain transactions."
128,31," The plaintiffs erroneously argue ""there is no issue of duplicative recovery, since no other plaintiff has sued."" (Plaintiffs' Mem.  
at 28.) "
129,32," Rosefielde & Gitomer was a law firm which dissolved prior to the commencement of this action. (Plaintiffs' Mem. at 84.) Mr. 
Rosefielde, a plaintiff, was a partner in that firm and is the successor in interest to those parts of the Rosefielde & Gitomer 
business that dealt with business jet aircraft. (Plaintiffs' Mem. at 84, citing Rosefielde Affidavit, para. 1.) Therefore, Mr. 
Rosefielde will have standing to sue for any aircraft assigned by Rosefielde & Gitomer."
129,33," The assignment to E.L. Cox does not fit within the narrowly defined exception to the rule of Illinois Brick which permits an 
indirect purchaser to sue when its purchase is made pursuant to a pre-existing, cost-plus contract. See Illinois Brick, 431 U.S. at 
736; Mid-West Paper Products Co.  v. Continental Group, 596 F.2d 573 (3d Cir. 1979). "
130,34," Falcon Jet did not attend these meetings, but received copies of the notes from participants at the meetings. (Plaintiffs' Mot. at 
42, no. 81.) "
131,35," Mr. Meyer has denied the existence of the alleged conspiracy in a sworn affidavit (Corwin H. Meyers Aff., para. 5), as have the 
other alleged co-conspirators. (Defendants' Reply at 65, n. 82.) "
138,1," Nowhere in the complaint does plaintiff mention any other state or federal laws to which the term ""inter alia"" might refer. Thus, 
the complaint can only be read, at this stage, to allege predicate acts of mail fraud and wire fraud. "
140,2," See, e.g., Connors v. Lexington Insurance Co., 666 F. Supp. 434, E.D.N.Y. 1987).  Where information similar to that in the 
present complaint was provided, Judge Glasser found that the pleadings were sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Rule 9(b). 
As Judge Glasser there observed: With respect to the allegations of mail fraud, plaintiff's complaint satisfies the particularity requirements of rule 9(b). 
Specifically, plaintiff has described where and how the alleged scheme occurred, given the approximate dates of his 
transactions with IGBE and thus, by inference, the approximate dates of mailings, and identified the alleged 
misrepresentations and omissions, as well as the ""speakers."" It is not necessary for plaintiff to provide more detail at this 
stage of the proceedings. As one court has noted, rule 9(b) is satisfied if enough information is given to allow the 
defendants to frame a responsive pleading and to assure the court that a sufficient basis exists for the allegations made. Id. at 450-51 (citations omitted)."
140,3," The Court does note, however, that if plaintiff chooses to file a new amended complaint, as provided by this Order, allegations 
naming the airlines involved in each example of the fraudulent schemes would bolster the complaint's compliance with the 
requirements of Rule 9(b). "
141,4," Where a RICO counterclaim alleged predicate act violations of ยง 10(b) of Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10(b)(5), 
the court found: even if the Bank did owe a duty to Lippe to disclose material information, his alleged ""injury"" is not adequately pled. He 
alleges that Tomcat is now an entity of questionable financial viability based solely on the fact that at some future date two 
investors may have a defense to notes that may be outstanding. The problem with this allegation is that it is too speculative. 
Essentially, Lippe is alleging that his partnership interest has been tarnished. It is significant that Lippe does not allege that 
the two investors actually have outstanding loans or that the Bank has unsuccessfully demanded payments on these notes. 
Hence, his allegation that Tomcat is of a questionable financial viability as a result of the Bank's failure to disclose material 
facts is not adequately pled. Bank Leumi Le Israel, B.M. v. Lippe, slip. op. No. 84 C. 9700 (N.D. Ill.  Dec. 16, 1986)."
141,5," Plaintiff correctly points out that a party can recover present damages for injuries that will accrue in the future. But none of the 
cases cited by plaintiff stands for the principle that a plaintiff can recover speculative damages. For example, plaintiff states in its 
brief that: Similarly, plaintiff [sic] under the antitrust laws can recover damages for future injuries. In Lehrman v. Gulf Oil Corp., 464 
F.2d 26 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1077, 93 S. Ct. 687 [34 L. Ed. 2d 665] (1972), the plaintiff was put out of business 
by the anticompetitive conduct of the defendant. The court permitted recovery of damages for future lost profits against the 
defendant's assertion that future injuries could not be compensated under the Sherman Act. To the extent that recovery of 
damages for yet-to-be-sustained injuries injects a measure of uncertainty, both in whether injury will be suffered at all and in 
the amount, the court held that ""the wrongdoer must bear the risk of the uncertainty in measuring the harm he causes."" 464 
F.2d, at 45. So long as future injuries are ""proved with reasonable certainty"", an antitrust plaintiff can recover damages for 
them.  Volasco Products Co. v. Lloyd A. Fry Roofing Co., 308 F.2d 383 (6th Cir. 1962), cert. denied [372] U.S. 907, 83 S. 
Ct. 721 [9 L. Ed. 2d 717] (1963). Plaintiff's Memorandum of Law at 4-5. Whether or not plaintiff's interpretation of antitrust law is correct, plaintiff's claim that it is liable to airlines cannot be considered 
similar in this context to the lost profits claim in Lehrman which plaintiff discusses. In Lehrman, the court determined that as a 
result of the antitrust violations of defendant, plaintiff had lost future profits, and an award of damages for those lost profits could 
be made, even if the exact amount of those losses could not be ascertained at the time of trial.  Indeed, the court in Lehrman 
claimed only to be applying ""the familiar rule that a wrongdoer is responsible for uncertainty in calculating the damages 
proximately caused by his own wrongdoing."" 464 F.2d at 45. In contrast, in the present case, it would not be possible, based on 
the allegations in the complaint, for this Court to determine at trial that plaintiff had in fact, or will in the future, become subject to 
liability to the airlines. While in Lehrman, the court could determine, with reasonable certainty, that future profits would be lost, in 
the present case plaintiff can only speculate that any of the defrauded airlines would seek to collect damages from plaintiff or, for 
that matter, anyone else. "
143,6," In Newman, plaintiffs alleged that: Defendant L. F. ROTHSCHILD is an enterprise as that term is defined in 18 U.S.C. 1961 engaged in interstate commerce 
and the activities of which affect interstate commerce. Such activities in and affecting interstate commerce include, among 
other things, the purchase and sale of securities, which have moved in interstate commerce. Judge Sweet dismissed the complaint, stating that ""missing are allegations of common purpose, as well as allegations that the 
alleged predicate acts are related to that common purpose. Consequently, under Beck, the Amended Complaint fails to allege 
'enterprise' properly, and the RICO count will be dismissed."" Newman, 662 F. Supp. at 958. "
149,1," The nineteen corporate defendants are dealers of commercial equipment. Most of the seventeen individual defendants are top 
officers or employees of the corporate defendants. "
154,2," Defendants have also moved for extensive discovery from the government. The court concludes, however, that the government 
is under no obligation to provide the defendants with any materials or information other than that which it must disclose under 
Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963), the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. ยง 3500(b), and F.R.Crim.P. 
16, and that which it has already promised to disclose voluntarily. "
158,1, The court does not interpret Haagen-Dazs' motion to seek summary judgment on its second cause of action in No. C-85-6553. 
159,2," Haagen-Dazs has filed objections to certain portions of Double Rainbow's and Two Count's factual record. The objections are 
based on various evidentiary grounds. The court has reviewed each of the objections, and believes that each is well taken. The 
objections are therefore sustained."
159,3," Haagen-Dazs is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Pillsbury Company. Haagen-Dazs and The Pillsbury Company are 
collectively referred to here as Haagen-Dazs. "
160,4, Price restraints are not involved in this case. 
162,5," Double Rainbow's and Two Count's statistics refer to the San Francisco Bay Area, using only super premium ice creams as the 
product market. Those statistics appear to be flawed, because of their exclusion of some alleged super premium brands. And 
even those statistics show that Haagen-Dazs' share of the alleged super premium market has dropped from 1984 through 1987. "
164,6," From the briefs in the summary judgment motions, the court does not understand Double Rainbow to argue that it has shown

resale within the United States or any Territory thereof or the District of Columbia or any insular possession or other place 
under the jurisdiction of the United States, and where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen

the services or facilities furnished by a competitor."
174,15, U.S.C. ยง 13(b). 
175,4," Although ""office products"" may be defined also to include office equipment and office machines, the ALJ expressly excluded 
those items from consideration of the industry in this case. ALJ Finding 6, J.A. at 46. "
176,5," The breadth and variety of discounts led one witness to observe that ""pricing in this industry is a jungle. Any given person in 
any given city on any given day could buy equal to, better than, or worse than someone else."" Commission's Exhibit 672-Z-94, 
95."
176,6," Boise's expert witness, Dr. Kenneth Elzinga, a professor of economics at the University of Virginia, opined that these discounts 
are not prevalent in the office products industry. The ALJ, however, found Dr. Elzinga's testimony outweighed by that of 
knowledgeable industry members who estimated that 50 % to 70 % of manufacturers offer such discounts. Id. 11-13, J.A. at 47-
48. "
177,7," Boise's distribution centers typically focus their sales efforts either on dealers or on consumers. Thirteen of the 27 distribution 
centers, for example, do not solicit end-user accounts. Id. 59, J.A. at 57-58. Of the eight centers that the Commission selected "
178,," for study in this case, seven made over 80 % of their sales to consumers (the eighth center made less than half of its sales to 
consumers). Id. 60-61, J.A. at 58. As might be expected, the proportion of its sales force devoted to dealer and end-user sales at 
each of the eight distribution centers roughly mirrors the percentage of dealer and consumer sales at the respective center. Id. at 
77-82, J.A. at 60a. In part because Boise's distribution centers are, for all practical purposes, autonomous, the marketing functions that Boise 
performs for manufacturers in its capacity as a dealer are similar to those performed by other dealers in the industry. Id. 522, 
J.A. at 142. For instance, like most dealers, the Boise distribution centers with substantial commercial sales tend to stock only 
those products that are frequently purchased. Id. 70, J.A. at 60. In addition, based on his review of the 23 selected dealers, the 
ALJ found that the dealers, like Boise, incur storage and resale expenses that reduce manufacturers' inventory costs, distribute 
catalogs that they produce or purchase from wholesalers, and employ outside salespeople to make regular calls on accounts. Id. 
503-14, J.A. at 139-40. While noting these similarities, the ALJ did not expressly find that any of the individual dealers provide 
the quality and quantity of services that Boise does."
178,8," Specifically, Rediform extends dealers a 50 % discount and wholesalers a 50-20 % discount. ALJ Findings 116-17, J.A. at 67-
68. Sheaffer Eaton gives dealers a 50 % discount, contract stationers a 50-10 % discount, and wholesalers a 50-20 % discount. 
Id. 165-70, J.A. at 77. On its ""visible equipment"" line, Kardex grants dealers a 40 % discount, ""key"" dealers (those with annual 
purchases of $ 5,000) a 50 % discount, and wholesalers a 50-10 % discount. Id. 224-26, J.A. at 85. On its ""insulated files"" line, 
Kardex extends dealers a 40-5 % discount, ""key"" dealers (those with annual purchases of $ 15,000) a 50 % discount, and 
wholesalers a 50-10 % discount. Id. 227-30, J.A. at 85-86. Boorum & Pease gives dealers a 50 % discount, contract stationers a 
50-10 % discount, and wholesalers a 50-10-5 % discount. Id. 261-64, J.A. at 91. Bates extends discounts to dealers between 40 
% and 50 % (based on quantity purchased) on most of its products, and contract stationers and wholesalers a 50-10 % discount 
on those items. Id. 293-300, J.A. at 96-97. Finally, Master Products gives dealers product- and quantity-specific discounts 
ranging from 40 % to 60 %, and wholesalers product-specific discounts ranging from 50 % to 60 %. Id. 343-345, J.A. at 104-05."
178,9," Although Boise played no part in instituting this pricing system, the ALJ concluded that Boise knew or should have known that 
the price disparity existed. Id. 368-69, 383, J.A. at 109, 112. Among other evidence of such knowledge were schedules in 
Boise's files documenting the size of dealer discounts and the reporting of dealer discounts in Boise's Buyer's Guide. Id. 148-49, 
151, 195, 241, 243, 280-82, 326, 363-64, J.A. at 75, 82, 88, 94, 102, 108. In addition Boise's salespeople and those of the 
selected dealers call on many of the same accounts, and Boise acquired dealers that had previously purchased at the less 
favorable dealer discounts. Moreover, Boise received complaints from disfavored dealers, id., 36, J.A. at 52-53, and knowledge 
of the range of discounts is common within the industry. Id. 194, 276-78, J.A. at 82, 93-94. And, of course, Boise knew that the 
manufacturers classify it as a wholesaler for purposes of wholesale discounts even as to goods that Boise resells to end-users. 
Id. 367, J.A. at 109. Based on these findings, the Commission determined that Boise had the requisite knowledge that its receipt 
of the discounts was not cost-justified. "
181,10," Concluding that Boise's receipt of wholesale discounts on goods it resold to end-users violated section 2(f), the Commission 
fashioned the following order: that Boise ""cease and desist from directly or indirectly inducing, receiving or accepting from any 
seller a net price that Boise Cascade knows or has reason to know is below the net price at which office products of like grade 
and quality are being offered or sold by such seller to other purchasers with whom Boise Cascade is competing in the resale or 
distribution of said office products to end-users."" Final Order, Boise Cascade Corp., FTC No. 9133, at 2 (Feb. 11, 1986), J.A. 
220, 221. "
182,11," This is not to say that Robinson-Patman applies only as to cases involving large buyers. The Supreme Court has held 
squarely to the contrary.  FTC v. Sun Oil Co., 371 U.S. 505, 522, 9 L. Ed. 2d 466, 83 S. Ct. 358 (1963); see also Falls City, 460 
U.S. at 436."
182,12," ""Competitive injury,"" as used throughout our opinion, refers to the broader definition of injury under the Robinson-Patman Act. 
As the Supreme Court established early on, ""the statute does not require that the discriminations must in fact have harmed 
competition, but only that there is a reasonable possibility that they 'may' have such an effect."" Corn Products Co. v. FTC, 324 
U.S. 726, 742, 89 L. Ed. 1320, 65 S. Ct. 961 (1945). See also Falls City, 460 U.S. at 434-35 (Commission ""must show . . . a 
reasonable possibility that a price difference may harm competition.""). "
183,13," The Court in Falls City expressly referred to the forbidden form of discrimination as one continuing ""over time."" 460 U.S. at 
435. A contrary approach would suffer from the danger of rigidly forbidding market adjustments to changing or temporary 
conditions."
183,14," With all respect, this is scarcely a paradigmatic Robinson-Patman Act case, contrary to what our colleague in dissent argues 
at such length. The Commission recognized at the creation of this long-lived proceeding that it was venturing into relatively new 
territory, namely into the area of dual distribution. This has been a hard fought venture by the Commission, with powerful and 
eloquent voices, such as that of now-Dean Pitofsky, railing against what some deem to be a quixotic application of Robinson-
Patman. This case is simply not of the lineage of Morton Salt. "
188,15," Notwithstanding this welter of dealer-specific evidence marshalled by Boise and painstakingly sifted by Judge Parker, the 
Commission apparently viewed Boise's efforts as an attempt to muddy the Robinson-Patman waters by implanting market-
structure analyses in alien legal soil. To be sure, Judge Parker made pertinent and seemingly well-founded observations as to 
the competitive health and vibrancy of the office products industry at large. Here is one such point: The battle between dealers in the office-products industry is highly competitive and it is inevitable that when Boise 
competes with the selected dealers it will lose accounts to them. Id. para. 408, J.A. at 117. And it is also clear that Boise argued in favor of a market-structure analysis under Robinson-Patman. But that is not to say that Judge Parker found only evidence going broadly to the structure of the industry and the competitive 
health of that industry overall. There was in this respect no commingling of market-structure analysis appropriate under other 
provisions of the Clayton Act, such as section 7, 15 U.S.C. ยง 18 (1982), but, as the Commission claims, off-target as to 
Robinson-Patman's less global perspective. The ALJ's findings, set forth in a thorough and careful 131-page opinion, are replete 
with the most specific, detailed facts about the twenty-three selected dealers and the six representative manufacturers, not just 
the structure of the entire industry. In short, Judge Parker did not lose sight of the trees in the midst of this vast forest. It seems 
to us, therefore, that the Commission mischaracterizes Boise's evidence as going to market structure, rather than to the twenty-
three selected dealers themselves, when Boise, in fairness, adduced evidence as to both. The dissent criticizes us for not telling the Commission with specificity how it should evaluate or weigh the evidence that was 
amassed before it in this case. We decline, with gratitude, the invitation to venture too deeply into areas where the Commission 
has yet to tread. The very fact of the Commission's expertise and knowledge of the industry, featured elsewhere by the dissent, 
counsels powerfully at this stage in favor of restraint and of permitting the expert agency to perform its assigned functions which 
it failed to carry out the first time around. This approach strikes us as achieving a more prudent balance between court and 
agency than that beguilingly suggested to us by the dissent. "
189,16," Our dissenting colleague suggests throughout his opinion that we have fashioned a novel rule of law under the Robinson-
Patman Act, namely a new evidentiary burden on the FTC to prove injury to competition. The charge, with all respect, is quite 
unfounded. To the contrary, we have steadfastly adhered to traditional principles of Robinson-Patman law in concluding that the 
Morton Salt inference was properly relied upon here to establish a prima facie case of competitive injury. In light of the 
Commission's success in this respect, the burden therefore shifted to Boise to rebut the FTC's prima facie case by breaking, if it 
could, the ""causal connection."" Our quarrel with the Commission, and now with our colleague, is that the FTC proceeded 
deliberately to ignore the wealth of evidence submitted by Boise, including fact-specific evidence going directly to the 
Commission-annointed ""victims,"" namely the selected dealers. This was no open-ended Sherman or Clayton Act case going 
broadly to the structure of the market or ""market dynamics,"" dissent op. at 1154: Boise's evidence could hardly have been more 
targeted. And Boise's target is clear to us, as it should have been to the Commission -- the selected dealers themselves and 
their specific circumstances in the competitive arena with Boise."
189,17," We recognize, of course, that the Falls City Court included the longstanding nature of a price difference in articulating when 
the existence of such a difference gives rise to Morton Salt's inference of injury.  460 U.S. at 435. We believe that the Court 
meant to suggest that long-term price differences more likely could lead to injury than differences of an equivalent magnitude 
maintained for only a short time or sporadically. See supra n.13. Our point is unrelated to this common-sense observation; it is 
that a price difference with the potential for causing injury will eventually result in measurable effects, such as diverted sales or 
lost profits. The more time that passes without such effects showing up, the more likely it becomes that the price difference does 
not in fact pose a threat of competitive injury. Cf.  Matsushita Electrical Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. 
Ct. 1348, 1358, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). Thus, evidence suggesting a lack of injury over the many years during which the 
challenged discounts have prevailed is clearly relevant to determining whether the statutory prerequisite of a ""reasonable 
possibility"" of injury exists. "
190,18," For instance, although Boise looms big as Boorum & Pease's largest single customer, id. 275, J.A. at 93 (at least in one fiscal 
year), Boise received over the years only the plain vanilla wholesaler discount offered to every other wholesaler. Id. 263, J.A. at 
91. "
191,19," Our disposition obviates any need to choose sides once and for all between Mueller and Doubleday. Mueller may, of course, 
be viewed as a strict application of the Morton Salt inference of competitive injury, because Mueller does not allow a finding that 
the amount of a functional discount is reasonably related to the recipient's cost of performing additional functions for the seller to 
negate the possibility of competitive injury. But we believe, for reasons previously set forth, that the inference can nonetheless 
be rebutted by a showing that injury is nonexistent. That view is clearly supported by Falls City, not to mention common sense."
191,1," I question whether the Morton Salt inference can ever be applied in a ยง 2(f) case. The Supreme Court has clearly held that the 
Commission cannot shift the burden of production onto the buyer simply by showing that the buyer knew that it was receiving a 
price discount unavailable to others.  Automatic Canteen Co. v. FTC, 346 U.S. 61, 79, 97 L. Ed. 1454, 73 S. Ct. 1017 (1953). 
The Commission cites no Supreme Court precedent applying the inference in a ยง 2(f) case, see Brief for Commission at 28-29 
n.26, and the only supporting circuit court case that it cites, Kroger Co. v. FTC, 438 F.2d 1372, 1378-79 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 
404 U.S. 871, 30 L. Ed. 2d 115, 92 S. Ct. 59 (1971), has been strictly limited to its unique facts, see Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea 
Co. v. FTC, 440 U.S. 69, 81-82 n.15, 59 L. Ed. 2d 153, 99 S. Ct. 925 (1979). In A & P, the Court held that a buyer accepting the 
lower of two prices competitively offered does not violate ยง 2(f) if seller has a ""meeting competition"" defense; it confined Kroger, 
which denied a buyer that defense, to instances of a ""lying buyer."" The decision appears to implement Automatic Canteen's 
unwillingness to foist onto a defendant buyer production burdens that are appropriate only for a seller responsible for a price 
discrimination. "
192,2," See Statement of Representative Utterback, presenting Conference Report to the House, 80 Cong. Rec. 9413, 9416 (1936) 
(contrasting unfair advantages said to accrue to some firms with ""the assurance of equal opportunity and fair play"" afforded by 
the bill); Report of House Judiciary Committee, H.R. Rep. No. 2287, 74th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 1 at 8 (1936) (favored buyers' 
partial non-contribution to costs and profits leads to ""burden and injury"" to disfavored customers); Report of Senate Judiciary 
Committee, S. Rep. No. 1502, 74th Cong., 2d Sess. 3 (1936) (committee's goal has been ""the preservation of equal opportunity"" 
to those engaged in distribution ""comportably with their ability . . . to serve . . . with real efficiency""); FTC v. Simplicity Pattern 
Co., 360 U.S. 55, 69, 3 L. Ed. 2d 1079, 79 S. Ct. 1005 (1959) (smaller firms said to suffer ""hopeless competitive disadvantage"" 
unrelated to cost). "
193,3," This appears to have been the case in Falls City Industries, Inc. v. Vanco Beverage, Inc., 460 U.S. 428, 75 L. Ed. 2d 174, 103 
S. Ct. 1282 (1983). Falls City sold beer to Kentucky wholesalers at a lower price than to Indiana ones (evidently solely because 
of a quirk in Indiana law). The Indiana wholesalers could not simply turn around and buy from Kentucky wholesalers across the 
border. It is a crime for an Indiana wholesaler to purchase beer from an out-of-state seller who does not hold a valid brewer's 
permit. The prerequisites to such a permit include not holding a disqualifying interest in another liquor permit, posting a bond to 
cover taxes, and agreeing to file reports with Indiana. See Ind. Code ยงยง 7.1-5-8-9; 7.1-5-9-1 to -13; 7.1-3-2-4 and -5 (1984). 
While the Falls City Court does not discuss the matter, the tone of the opinion strongly suggests that the Kentucky wholesaler 
did not hold the requisite permit."
193,4," The Dissent's suggestion slip op. at 22 that wholesalers cannot discover disfavored buyers of substantial quantities of 
discriminatorily priced goods reflects a robust imagination. It is, of course, the business of wholesalers to sell to retailers. 
Recipients of the wholesale discounts are typically listed as members of the Wholesale Stationers Association. Maj. Op. slip op. 
at 11. Thus the wholesaler seeking to engage in arbitrage can simply start with all firms in the business downstream from 
manufacture, subtract members of the Association, and have a prima facie list of the target group."
193,5," There is in fact substantial competition for sales to dealers between and among the wholesalers, and the suppliers. See AF 7, 
30, 33, 38, J.A. at 46, 51-53. Accordingly, if sellers in fact gave wholesalers unmerited discounts, competition among 
wholesalers would shift the benefit forward to dealers. "
194,6," As Holmes said, ""A fact taken in its isolation . . . is gossip."" 1 M. Howe, ed., Holmes-Laski Letters 129 (1953)."
194,7," This analysis is not altered in the slightest by the fact that sellers generally give the discount on all products bought by a 
wholesaler, even though many of them may be resold to end users. So long as the resale condition assures that non-discount 
customers are not saddled with a disproportionate share of fixed costs and profits, the sort of injustice at which the Act strikes is 
necessarily absent. "
195,," Moreover, a rule requiring suppliers to limit the discounts to items actually sold at wholesale would work to the detriment of 
Boise's purchasers, including dealers. Enforcement of such a rule would entail substantial administrative costs, see Calvani, 
Functional Discounts Under the Robinson-Patman Act, 17 B.C. Ind. & Com. L. Rev. 543, 556 (1976) (a company that had 
insisted on certification of resale scrapped the requirement ""as unworkable because it was not adopted by its competitors, was 
resented by its customers, and resulted in falsehood and inaccuracy""), which would doubtless be passed on to customers. 
Because of these administrative costs, Commission insistence on such market segregation might well eliminate the use of 
functional discounts and the substantial efficiencies they generate for dealers, see ALJ Finding (""AF"") 46, J.A. at 54-55 (dealers 
recognize that wholesalers provide them with valuable services unavailable from manufacturers), and for end users, see AF 393, 
J.A. at 114 (""'The City of Seattle buys from Boise because of usage reports, because of some of the sophistication in the 
invoicing system, because of depth of inventory and high [fill] rates.'""); see also AF 385, 392, 398, 402, J.A. at 113-16. The high 
administrative costs, as well as the tendency of the resulting efficiencies to spill over in sales to end users, likely account for 
sellers' disinclination to so restrict the discounts. "
223,1," During oral argument, counsel for Cemar discussed the fact that Cemar could buy Nissan vehicles from other dealers, albeit at 
inflated prices. This was not specifically alleged in the complaint. If there were other suppliers for the unpopular vehicles, 
substitutes could be available and competition could be foreclosed because Cemar may be forced to buy the vehicles from 
Nissan rather than from other sources. However, the fact that Cemar would not have bought the vehicles elsewhere means that 
no other sellers were foreclosed from the market because of the alleged tying arrangement. "
226,2," Section 1962(c) reads: HN31[
] ""It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged 
in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct 
of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt."" 18 U.S.C. ยง 1962(c) (1982). "
238,1," Because we uphold the jury's finding of monopoly power, we need not consider the attempted monopolization claim that was 
an alternative ground for the jury's verdict. "
239,2," For example, a ski resort with monopoly power was required to continue a marketing arrangement with its small neighbor 
where there was no legitimate business justification for discontinuing it, and the arrangement increased competition and 
benefited consumers.  Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585, 86 L. Ed. 2d 467, 105 S. Ct. 2847 
(1985)."
239,3," The jury instruction on this issue was: To sum up, you must determine whether PRI and Gasco maintained monopoly power in a relevant market by policies and 
conduct which were not legitimate business decisions but were instead designed primarily to further any domination of a 
relevant market. . . . You should seek to determine if the challenged conduct is supported by legitimate business reasons or 
whether it was a deliberate effort to injure a smaller rival which caused defendants to sacrifice short-run benefits and 
consumer good will. "
240,4," For this reason the ""essential facilities"" theory would not apply either. See MCI Communications Corp. v. AT & T Co., 708 F.2d 
1081, 1132 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 891, 78 L. Ed. 2d 226, 104 S. Ct. 234 (1983) (plaintiff must show control of the 
essential facility by a monopolist). "
246,1," Second Amended Complaint at para. 8 (October 2, 1987)."
246,2," McElderry also seeks relief under common law principles of fraud, breach of contract and unjust enrichment. Given the 
dismissal of McElderry's federal claims by this opinion, as discussed below, the court declines to exercise pendent jurisdiction 
over McElderry's state law claims, and they are accordingly dismissed. Diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1332 is not 
alleged."
246,3," The primary basis for dismissal of both McElderry's Federal Aviation Act claims and her antitrust claims is lack of subject matter 
jurisdiction under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). To the extent that the motion to dismiss was also brought under Fed. R. Civ. P. 
12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, the motion is properly converted to a motion for summary 
judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, as required by Rule 12(b) when ""matters outside the pleading are presented to and not 
excluded by the court."" See Goldman v. Belden, 754 F.2d 1059, 1065-66 (2d Cir. 1985). Here, conversion is appropriate 
because both parties have availed themselves of the opportunity to provide affidavits, numerous exhibits and other materials 
outside the pleadings and the court has considered such materials. Moreover, regardless of how the motion is labelled, 
dismissal is warranted: it is clear not only that ""there is no genuine issue as to any material fact"" as required by Rule 56, but also 
that McElderry can prove no set of facts in support of her claims which would entitle her to relief, the standard for dismissal 
under Rule 12(b)(6), see Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80, 78 S. Ct. 99 (1957)."

247,7," The four factors articulated in Cort are: First, is the plaintiff ""one of the class for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted,"" -- that is, does the statute create 
a federal right in favor of the plaintiff? Second, is there any indication of legislative intent, explicit or implicit, either to create 
such a remedy or to deny one? Third, is it consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to imply such a 
remedy for the plaintiff? And finally, is the cause of action one traditionally relegated to state law, in an area basically the 
concern of the States, so that it would be inappropriate to infer a cause of action based solely on federal law? Cort v. Ash, 422 U.S. at 78 (citation omitted) (emphasis in original)."
247,8," For reasons similar to those discussed above, the third Cort factor -- whether implication of a private remedy is consistent with

Wolf, 544 F.2d at 136-37; Polansky, 523 F.2d at 337-38, while the second Cort factor -- indication of legislative intent -- sheds no

250,17," McElderry also alleges that Cathay Pacific violated ยง 1 of the Robinson-Patman Price Discrimination Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 13, by 
establishing a baggage allowance and charge system which resulted in the discrimination in price between different purchasers of 
commodities of like quality, to wit, an airline through-ticket providing for passage from Hong Kong to Taipei on defendant's 
airline and a similar passage on an airline obeying United States laws and tariff requirements. Second Amended Complaint at para. 42. This claim is without merit: the Robinson-Patman Act applies only to the sale of goods, 
not services, and applies only to discriminatory sales that take place in the United States. See generally, ABA Antitrust Section,

260,1," The individually-named defendants are all members of WCES' Board of Directors: Donald Terrell, Keith Crowe, Reese Smith, 
Jr., Reese Smith, III, Stephen B. Smith, and W. C. Allen. Defendants Terrell, Crowe, Smith, Jr., Smith, III, and Stephen Smith 
were also members of WCMT's Board of Directors."
260,2," Specifically, the Court enjoined defendants from:"
260,1," . Refusing to provide engineering, design or other consulting or support services to North Central Watt Count;"
260,2," . Refusing to sell heatshield, caulking or other materials or supplies which defendants offer for sale to Watt Count franchises 
and/or refusing to sell or attempting to sell such items at prices which are higher than the regularly posted prices for such items;"
260,3," . Revoking or suspending plaintiff's Watt Count franchise or engaging in, or attempting to do any act to restrict plaintiff's 
business activities to any specified area;"
260,4," . Engaging in any other conduct or causing others to engage in any conduct which would restrict or interfere with plaintiff's 
conduct of business under its Watt Count franchise. In doing so, the Court held that NCWC had shown a likelihood of success on the merits of its antitrust claim. "
261,3," Various companies throughout the Middle and Northern Tennessee area provide services similar to those provided by Watt 
Count. Only Your Energy Service, however, issues a written guarantee similar to the one provided by Watt Count. Compared to 
the Watt Count Organization, Your Energy Service controls a relatively insignificant share of the relevant market."
261,4," For certain repeat work, however, WCES charges its area dealers seven cents per square foot of conditioned space."
261,5," As of April 11, 1987, there were 19 Watt Count area dealers located in nine different states. See Deposition of Keith Crowe at 
32."
261,6," WCMT paid $ 37,500 for the Williamson County dealership."
261,7," WCMT paid an additional $ 40,000 for the Davidson County dealership. "
262,8," Both NCWC and WCMT entered into identical dealership agreements with WCM. By the express terms of those agreements, 
WCM granted area dealers ""the exclusive right to promote, sell, and service the Watt Count System. . . in the geographic area 
specified in Paragraph 1.4"" See Authorized Total Energy Center Dealership Agreement, Paragraph 1.1. Paragraph 1.4 of the 
agreements required the area dealer to operate a business, and maintain a retail sales outlet in a defined area, and provided 
that WCM would not grant any other ""dealer franchise"" in a particular geographic territory. In Paragraph 1.6 of the agreements, 
the area dealers acknowledged WCM's right to authorize other area dealers to sell and promote the Watt Count System ""outside 
the geographic area specified in Paragraph 1.4."" The agreements, however, did not explicitly and unambiguously state that one 
franchise's salespersons could not solicit business in another franchise's territory."
262,9, See Deposition of Michael Busby at 27; Deposition of Keith Crowe at 19.
262,10, See Deposition of Donald Terrell at 56.
262,11," Defendants Terrell and Crowe claim that a franchise prospectus was not used when they negotiated to purchase WCMT's two 
area dealerships. See also Affidavit of Jim Pemberton at 2 (Pemberton, along with Michael Busby, negotiated the sale of 
WCMT's two area dealerships on behalf of WCM). In any event, although the franchise prospectus is somewhat ambiguous, it 
may reasonably be construed to support defendants' claim that WCES and WCM initially intended to impose territorial sales 
restriction. Section 13(ii) of the prospectus provided that ""[WCM] limits the geographic area in which . . . [a] franchise may 
promote and sell the Watt Count System."" Section 13(iii) further provided that ""[WCM] does provide territorial protection . . . in 
that [it] agrees not to establish another . . .  franchise within the geographic area designated in the . . . Dealership Agreement."""
262,12," WCES' position is supported by the testimony of Michael Busby, Clinton Swafford, Thomas Moody, and Robert Brown. See 
Deposition of Michael Busby at 16-17; Affidavit of Clinton Swafford at 2; Affidavit of Thomas Moody at 3; Affidavit of Robert 
Brown at 2."
262,13," See Deposition of Charles Parks at 7-10; Transcript of October 3, 1986 Preliminary Injunction Hearing at 25-26 (testimony of 
Raymond Busby); 82 (testimony of Allen Bowman). "
263,14," The testimony of defendants Terrell and Crowe, as well as that of Jim Pemberton support this contention. See Deposition of 
Donald Terrell at 15-19; Deposition of Keith Crowe at 10-11; Affidavit of Jim Pemberton at 1-2. Furthermore, defendants contend 
that Michael Busby, himself, acknowledged the truth of this contention at an informal WCES Board meeting just three days prior 
to the preliminary injunction hearing held in this case on October 3, 1986. For testimony in support, see Affidavit of W. C.  Allen 
at 3; Affidavit of Kimberly Redd at 2. Finally, the testimony of Glenn Lawrence, who served as a WCES director until January, 
1986, also supports this contention. See also Affidavit of John Baugh at 2 (a member of WCES' Board at time dealership first 
sold and considered)."
263,15," Defendants argue persuasively that it would have made no economic sense for them to have paid $ 40,000 for a second area 
dealership, unless they truly believed that the dealership agreements imposed protective territorial sales restrictions."
263,16," WCMT's letter contained two objections; one concerning NCWC's territorial crossings and another concerning engineering 
fees. The response drafted by Michael Busby addressed both of these complaints. The minutes of the October 25, 1983 board 
meeting, however, do not indicate that the Board discussed WCMT's objection to NCWC's actions, nor do they indicate that a 
copy of WCMT's letter was distributed to the directors. NCWC has not offered any explanation for these omissions. Furthermore, 
John Baugh, who in his affidavit claims to have been on WCES' Board until mid-1985 but who NCWC alleges was not present at 
the time WCES' Board discussed its response to WCMT's letter, contends that Michael Busby never advised the Board that 
NCWC was selling in another dealer's territory, and that the Board was never asked to change its original policy and permit 
territorial crossings. See Affidavit of John Baugh at 3."
263,17," This version of the facts is supported by the testimony of both Michael Busby and Clinton Swafford, a member of WCES' 
Board at the time who was present at the October 25, 1983 meeting and who drafted the cover letter under which WCES' 
response was sent to WCMT. See Affidavit of Clinton Swafford at 4-5."
263,18," According to defendant Terrell, at the time WCMT received Michael Busby's response to their letter, WCMT had no reason to 
believe that he was misrepresenting the position of WCES and thought that the best thing to do was avoid a costly court battle 
and begin selling in NCWC's territory. See Affidavit of Donald Terrell at 4."
263,19, All other area dealers were willing to sign and approve the policy statement. 
264,20," NCWC contends that although defendants Crowe and the Smiths were not directly involved, they either approved of or 
acquiesced in Terrell's action."
264,21," NCWC contends, however, that WCMT's remaining board members subsequently approved of or acquiesced in defendants 
Terrell and Crowe's actions. NCWC further contends that the complaint was meritless and that it was filed by defendants Terrell 
and Crowe with full knowledge of its groundless nature."
264,22," Prior to addressing WCES' Board, Terrell consulted with WCMT's remaining board members on an informal basis."
264,23, Defendant Allen moved that the Board adopt the resolution. 
265,24," Although Smith, III was not present, NCWC claims that he impliedly approved of the Board's action and the content of the 
letter sent to NCWC by failing to subsequently dissent."
265,25, It is unclear whether a similar letter was ever sent to WCMT.
265,26," But see Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538, 553, 106 S. Ct. 1348 
(1986) (""antitrust law limits the range of permissible inferences from ambiguous evidence in a ยง 1 case"")."
265,27," NCWC seeks both damages under 15 U.S.C. ยง 15 (Supp. 1987) and permanent injunctive relief under 15 U.S.C. ยง 26 (Supp. 
1987). HN3[
] It is well established that proof of actual ""antitrust injury"" is a necessary prerequisite to recovering damages under section 15. See Brunswick v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701, 712, 97 S. Ct. 690 (1977). 
Similarly, in order to obtain injunctive relief under section 26, NCWC must show a threat of ""antitrust injury."" See Cargill, Inc. v. 
Monfort of Colorado, Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427, 438, 107 S. Ct. 484 (1986). NCWC must show more than an injury 
causally linked to an antitrust violation.  Id. 93 L. Ed. 2d at 435. It must show both an actual and threatened injury ""of the type the 
antitrust laws were designed to prevent and that flows from that which makes a defendants' acts unlawful."" Brunswick, 50 L. Ed. 
2d at 712. Contrary to defendants' contention, NCWC has met this burden by presenting evidence which tends to show that 
defendants' alleged unlawful conduct reduced competition in the Middle Tennessee market for Watt Count services and that 
NCWC has been and will be injured by that reduction in competition. Defendants' motion for summary judgment, therefore, to the 
extent that it was based on this issue, is denied. "
266,28," It is undisputed that WCES and WCMT, while separate economic entities, are commonly-controlled corporations. Furthermore, 
defendants do not dispute that WCES' refusal to deal with NCWC was designed to either impose or enforce territorial sales 
restrictions, and that WCMT had a practical economic motive for encouraging such action on WCES' part.  Finally, it is clear that 
WCES' alleged misconduct did not occur until after WCMT gained some measure of control over WCES."
266,29," As NCWC points out, by threatening to terminate NCWC's franchise, WCES effectively restricted NCWC's business activity to 
a limited territory. NCWC's consumption of heatshield -- a product that traveled in interstate commerce -- therefore, decreased. 
The record clearly shows that NCWC purchased heatshield produced by Metallized Products, Inc., a corporation located in 
Boston, Massachusetts. It is therefore irrelevant that NCWC could have obtained heatshield from an intrastate source."
266,30," See also, supra, n. 25 (disposing of defendants' only other argument -- that NCWC has not presented evidence of an ""antitrust 
injury""). "
268,31," According to defendants, territorial restrictions also enhance intrabrand competition ""by forcing each dealer to develop and 
promote his own territory rather than take a free ride off another dealer's efforts."" Brief of Defendants in Opposition to Plaintiff's 
Motion for Summary Judgment at 12."
268,32," For example, an ""upstream"" entity's refusal to deal may be motivated by a desire to enforce a reasonable non-price vertically-
imposed territorial restriction. Defendants contend that this is exactly what WCES was doing in this case. "
269,33," HN10[
] Section 1962(c) provides: It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which 
affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's 
affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt."
269,18, U.S.C. ยง 1962(c) (1984).
269,34," It is well settled that HN12[
] section 1962(c) applies to legitimate as well as illegitimate enterprises. See United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 69 L. Ed. 2d 246, 253, 101 S. Ct. 2524 (1981)."
269,35," It is the enterprise itself, not the conduct of each individual defendant that must affect interstate commerce. See United States 
v. Groff, 643 F.2d 396, 400 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 828, 70 L. Ed. 2d 103, 102 S. Ct. 121 (1981). "
270,36," It is undisputed that defendants are all ""employed by or associated with"" the alleged enterprise. See 18 U.S.C. ยง 1962(c) 
(1984)."
270,37," HN14[
] Tenn. Code Ann. ยง 39-2-701 (1982) makes it unlawful for any person to: maliciously threaten to accuse another of a crime, offense, or immoral act, or to do any injury to the person, reputation or 
property of another, with intent . . . to extort any money, property, or pecuniary advantage whatever, or to compel the 
person so threatened to do any act against his will . . . ."
270,38," HN15[
]  18 U.S.C. ยง 1951(a) (1984) makes it unlawful for any person to obstruct, delay, or affect commerce or the movement of any article in commerce by using, attempting to use, or conspiring to use extortionate means. An essential element "
271,," of a section 1951(a) violation, therefore, is proof that the extortionate transaction has at least a de minimus effect on interstate 
commerce. See United States v. Harding, 563 F.2d 299, 301-02 (6th Cir. 1977)."
271,39," The Court is convinced that an ordinary and prudent government board such as the Contractor Licensing Board would not 
have merely accepted the representations made in the complaint. In fact its function is to verify those representations and 
determine whether a license is required. Cf.  Blount Financial Services, Inc. v. Walter E. Heller and Co., 819 F.2d 151, 153 (6th 
Cir. 1987)."
271,40," By refusing to sell heatshield to NCWC, defendants in no way ""maliciously threatened"" to take any action against NCWC. 
Such conduct, therefore, did not violate Tenn. Code Ann. ยง 39-2-701."
271,41," In fact, Allen Bowman, President of NCWC at the time, has admitted that he did not even now why WCMT refused to sel 
NCWC heatshield. See Transcript of October 3, 1986 Preliminary Injunction Hearing at 104. "

281,1," Pursuant to Rule 27(a) of the Local Rules of this court, and the order of the district court of May 23, 1985, we entered an order

defendants,"" the parties having reached a settlement."
281,2," The initial Act to Regulate Commerce was enacted in 1887. Ch. 104, 24 Stat. 379. Its successor, the Interstate Commerce Act, 
as amended, was subsequently codified at 49 U.S.C. ยงยง 1-66. These and related provisions were repealed and recodified by Act 
of Oct. 17, 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-473, 92 Stat. 1337, and are currently codified in scattered sections of 49 U.S.C. ยงยง 10101-
11917. Although this recodification was not intended to effect any ""substantive change,"" see ยง 3(a), 92 Stat. 1337, 1466, it 
substantially revised the language and structure of the Act. The parties have cited the old version of the Act, but we have cited 
the current version. For a good overview of the Interstate Commerce Act, including subsequent amendments, and its relationship to the antitrust 
laws, see Dempsey, Rate Regulation and Antitrust Immunity in Transportation: The Genesis and Evolution of this Endangered 
Species, 32 Am. U. L. Rev. 335 (1983)."
281,3," A tariff is a filed publication in which a carrier states its rates and charges and which may include rules governing other related 
services. See Rosenak, Rate Procedures and Proceedings, 12 Transp. L. Inst. 1, 1 (1979)."
281,4," Once a proposed tariff is filed with the ICC, the Commission has a limited time within which to suspend or reject the tariff. 
During this notice period the ICC may suspend the tariff either on its own motion or on the motion of an interested party.  49 
U.S.C. ยง 10707(a). If the ICC fails to reject the proposed tariff within the applicable notice period the tariff automatically becomes 
effective.  49 U.S.C. ยง 10707(b). After a rate becomes effective, the Commission can still investigate violations of the Act and 
compel compliance with the Act. Id. ยง 11701(a). Judicial review of the ICC's decision under these proceedings is also available 
but subject to certain limitations. Thus, a decision by the Commission following a ยง 10707(a) investigation to approve or 
disapprove a set of rates is a judicially reviewable final decision as is a decision to approve or disapprove a set of rates following 
a ยง 11701(a) investigation. In addition, although a decision not to investigate the lawfulness of a proposed rate schedule under ยง 
10707(a) is not reviewable, an interested party may require the Commission to ""investigate the lawfulness of any rate at any time 
-- and may secure judicial review of any decision not to do so -- by filing a ยง [11701(a)] complaint."" Southern Ry. Co. v. 
Seaboard Allied Milling Corp., 442 U.S. 444, 454, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1017, 99 S. Ct. 2388 (1979)."
281,5," See Louisville & Nashville R.R. v. Maxwell, 237 U.S. 94, 59 L. Ed. 853, 35 S. Ct. 494 (1915): Under the Interstate Commerce Act, the rate of the carrier duly filed is the only lawful charge. Deviation from it is not 
permitted upon any pretext. Shippers and travelers are charged with notice of it, and they as well as the carrier must abide 
by it, unless it is found by the Commission to be unreasonable. . . . This rule is undeniably strict, and it obviously may work 
hardship in some cases, but it embodies the policy which has been adopted by Congress in the regulation of interstate 
commerce in order to prevent unjust discrimination. "

282,6," This collective ratemaking was, and continues to be, effected through rate bureaus, which are associations of two or more

285,11," Following oral argument, C.D. Ambrosia Trucking Company, Inc., and David W. Reaney and Reaney Dock Company sought 
leave to file a post-argument amicus brief pursuant to Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. Because of the 
complexity of this case, and the possibility that the interest of amicus could be affected by the outcome of this case, we granted 
this motion on January 3, 1986. In disposing of the issues raised in this appeal, we have considered the arguments raised by 
amicus. Although amicus has raised some arguments which have not been raised by the principal parties to this action, it is 
sufficient to note that the position of amicus is similar to that of Pinney and Litton. "
287,12," However, in Georgia v. Pennsylvania R.R. Co., 324 U.S. 439, 89 L. Ed. 1051, 65 S. Ct. 716 (1945), the Supreme Court did 
see fit to apply Keogh in a case where Georgia was both a customer and a competitor. The Court noted that ""Georgia sues as a 
proprietor to redress wrongs suffered by it as the owner of a railroad and as the owner and operator of various public 
institutions."" Id. at 447. The Court then stated ""we think it is clear from the Keogh case alone that Georgia may not recover 
damages even if the conspiracy alleged were shown to exist."" Id. at 453. While Georgia presents a special case because it was "
288,," decided prior to the passage of the Reed-Bulwinkle Act in 1948, we find the Supreme Court's application of Keogh to a 
competitor to be relevant even under these circumstances. Georgia is discussed in greater depth in section IV of this opinion."
288,13," An additional argument which may be equally applicable to competitors and is addressed in Keogh and in Square D is the 
speculative nature of any damages. As we have pointed out, their existence necessarily presupposes alternate activity which 
might have been undertaken by the plaintiffs but for the allegedly violative conduct of the defendants. "

291,15," In United States v. Bessemer and Lake Erie R. Co., 230 U.S. App. D.C. 316, 717 F.2d 593 (D.C. Cir. 1983), the D.C. Circuit 
upheld the criminal conviction of appellant railroad for Sherman antitrust violations arising out of a 1956 agreement to eliminate 
or inhibit competition from private docks in handling iron ore on Lake Erie. Speaking of intent, the court observed: The activities described in the indictment do not fit within the narrow [ยง 10706] privilege. First, the indictment does not 
attack the rate bureau itself. It alleges, instead, that some members of the rate bureau entered into a separate agreement. 
This agreement only incidentally touched upon the setting of rates; its real purpose was to ward off the outside competition 
heralded by the advent of the self-unloaders. More than mere purpose or ""intent"" distinguished this separate conspiracy from the rate bureau. Several of the actions 
taken by this separate conspiracy were not ""in conformity with"" the rate bureau's [10706] rate agreement. Some of the actions were procedurally inconsistent with section [10706]. Paragraph 23(d) of the indictment alleges that 
defendants ""quot[ed] the same charges for handling iron ore from self-unloaders as from bulkers even though services 
identified in the applicable tariffs were not to be performed."" The crux of this charge is that handling the self-unloaders 
represented a significantly different type of service. Rather than promulgating a new rate for this new service in accordance 
with ICC requirements, the conspirators shielded the new joint rate from ICC scrutiny. "
292,," Id. at 600-01 (citations and footnotes omitted). The D.C. Circuit also correctly confined itself to the special role of the United 
States in enforcing the criminal aspects of the Sherman Act, noting that: The offense charged in this case is not subject to ICC remedial jurisdiction. The government does not seek to amend the 
[10706] rate agreement or to alter prospectively the rates set by the [10706] rate bureau; it seeks to punish an illegal 
antitrust combination which happened to employ a rate bureau. The ICC is not equipped to ""remedy"" criminal violations of 
the antitrust laws. Id. at 600. The court rejected the concept of an immunity argument under Bulwinkle as untimely and declined to address a 
primary jurisdiction argument. Id. at 599-600. We do not find our holdings here necessarily at odds with those in U.S. v. 
Bessemer involving entirely different considerations of the role of the United States in the criminal enforcement of the Sherman 
Act."
292,16," This rule applies to a party seeking reversal. Cf.  Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 475 n.6, 25 L. Ed. 2d 491, 90 S. Ct. 
1153 (1970) (""The prevailing party may . . . assert in a reviewing court any ground in support of his judgment, whether or not that 
ground was relied upon or even considered by the trial court."") "
295,17," It does appear, however, that the same area of activity challenged here has been made the subject of scrutiny by the Justice 
Department. See note 15, supra. "
296,18," This rule of ""particularity"" has been codified in Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which states in part: ""In all

case, there is no dispute that plaintiffs failed to comply with this rule. "
301,19," The other case cited by the district judge here to support his conclusion is King & King Enterprises v. Champlin Petroleum Co.,

F.2d 984 (1977), were met here. The evidence showed that the defendant actively sought to conceal its price fixing activities,

& F. Investment, 420 F.2d 1191, 1199 (7th Cir. 1970) (""where, as in the case of many conspiracies in violation of federal antitrust 
laws, the wrong is self-concealing, little need be added in order to justify tolling the statute.""). "
304,20," To the extent that plaintiffs are arguing that the defendants kept their meetings and dealings secret in violation of their 
statutory duty to issue public notices of meetings, proposals, and rate decisions, it would appear that plaintiffs' argument would 
involve an interpretation of ICC rules, regulations and statutes. This in turn would seem to implicate the issue of primary 
jurisdiction, an argument which the defendants also raised in support of their contention that this action should be dismissed, or 
at least deferred to until the ICC has an opportunity to address the issues. However, Judge Thomas seems to have anticipated 
this problem because he states: ""The present issue is not whether defendants had a statutory duty to disclose to plaintiff the 
details of their informal discussions. For purposes of the present motion, the court need only decide whether a genuine issue of 
fact exists as to the alleged agreement and communications being carried out in a manner which eluded discovery by plaintiff.""

district court concluded that ""the trier of fact could find from the documents in the record that the true justification for the

equipped to handle iron ore from bulk carriers' was the continuing secret agreement of February 26, 1958, to deny an iron ore 
commodity rate from Pinney's dock."" Pinney Dock, 1983-2 Trade Cas. (CCH) para. 65,608 at 69,045. "

343,2," Standing to sue for violations of the Sherman Act is provided by section 4 of the Clayton Act. Section 4 gives the right to bring a 
treble damages action to ""any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the

343,3," Count II of the amended complaint, alleging a violation of section 2 of the Sherman Act, was dismissed without prejudice by 
stipulation at oral argument, April 9, 1987, and is therefore not considered in this ruling."
343,4," At first glance, it might appear that the arrangements alleged by Federal should be treated as per se violations of the Sherman 
Act since Federal has alleged conspiracies among Amata and the wastepaper suppliers with the purpose ""to fix prices and 
elements of prices for the supply of wastepaper to Federal's Sprague mill,"" and ""[a] horizontal agreement to fix prices is the 
archetypal example of [a per se violation]."" catalano, Inc. v. Target Sales, Inc., 446 U.S. 643, 647, 64 L. Ed. 2d 580, 100 S. Ct. 
1925 (1980) (per curiam). ""The mere attachment of a per se label"" by Federal, however, ""does not automatically invoke the per 
se doctrine."" Bunker Ramo Corp. v. United Business Forms, Inc., 713 F.2d 1272, 1284 (7th Cir. 1983). ""The defendants' conduct 
must be analyzed to determine whether it should receive per se treatment."" Id. As the text makes clear, because Federal has not 
alleged facts from which this court can infer a restraint on competition, the defendants' conduct does not amount to a per se 
violation of section 1. "
344,5," Because per se liability is predicated on the existence of a substantial threat to competition, the ""per se rules may require 
considerable inquiry into market conditions before the evidence justifies a presumption of anticompetitive conduct."" NCAA, 468 
U.S. at 104 n.26."
344,6," Although the definition of relevant market is most often a question of fact, see Hayden Publishing Co., 730 F.2d at 70 & n. 8, 
except in unusual circumstances a single purchaser cannot usually constitute a relevant geographical market, see Jayco Sys., 
Inc. v. Savin Business Mach. Corp., 777 F.2d 306, 319 & n. 43 (5th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 816, 107 S. Ct. 73, 93 L. 
Ed. 2d 30 (1986). Since the court finds that there has been no anticompetitive effect in the market alleged by Federal, however, 
it is not necessary to consider whether Federal's allegation of a single-purchaser market is insufficient as a matter of law. "
345,7," This court also finds that Amata's refusal to purchase from the wastepaper suppliers that were unwilling to pay him bribes does 
not amount to a refusal to deal as in Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., 359 U.S. 207, 3 L. Ed. 2d 741, 79 S. Ct. 705 
(1959), where a refusal to deal was held to be a monopoly forbidden by the antitrust laws. Klor's involved a concerted refusal by 
""manufacturers, distributors and a retailer"" to deal with the petitioner.  Id. at 213. Amata's actions, by contrast, amounted at most 
to ""a single trader refusing to deal with another,"" a scenario that the Court in Klor's distinguished from the group boycott. See id. 
at 212."
345,8," An antitrust injury is an ""injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes 
defendants' acts unlawful."" Brunswick, 429 U.S. at 489. Analysis of a plaintiff's antitrust injury is also relevant for determining 
whether that plaintiff has standing to sue for treble damages under section 4 of the Clayton Act. See Eastway Constr. Corp. v. 
City of New York, 762 F.2d 243, 250 (2d Cir. 1985) HN4[
] (to have standing to bring an antitrust claim plaintiff must suffer an 
antitrust injury). The concept of antitrust injury and its relation to standing is discussed infra at part II. B. "
346,," The analysis of ""antitrust injury"" that this court undertakes with respect to Federal's Sherman Act claim should be distinguished 
from the ""antitrust injury"" analysis with respect to Federal's Robinson-Patman Act claim. As explained in the text infra, under 
section 2(c) of the Robinson-Patman Act there is no requirement that a plaintiff allege or prove antitrust injury or anticompetitive 
effect in order to establish a prima facie violation of section 2(c). The antitrust injury requirement for Federal's Robinson-Patman 
Act claim is imposed solely by common law standing doctrine. Moreover, since an antitrust injury is an ""injury of the type the 
antitrust laws were intended to prevent,"" Brunswick, 429 U.S. at 489, an antitrust injury for purposes of a claim arising under 
section 2(c) of the Robinson-Patman Act is different from an antitrust injury for purposes of a claim arising under section 1 of the 
Sherman Act. Section 1 of the Sherman Act is intended to protect free competition, NCAA, 468 U.S.  at 104 & n.27, so that a 
plaintiff's Sherman Act injury must reflect the anticompetitive consequences of the defendants' conduct, see Brunswick, 429 U.S. 
at 489. Section 2(c) of the Robinson-Patman Act, on the other hand, was enacted to close a loophole in the price discrimination 
laws. See infra part II. B. To establish antitrust injury for purposes of standing to sue for a violation of section 2(c), a plaintiff must 
show that the violation ""adversely affected his ability to compete with favored competitors."" World of Sleep, Inc. v. La-Z-Boy 
Chair Co., 756 F.2d 1467, 1480 (10th Cir.), cert.  denied, 474 U.S. 823, 88 L. Ed. 2d 63, 106 S. Ct. 77 (1985)."
346,9," There is no restraint in this case because the way was open to Federal to do business with individual suppliers. The fate of the 
blanket-license arrangement examined by the Supreme Court in Broadcast Music and on remand by the Second Circuit Court of 
Appeals in Columbia Broadcasting System provides a more sophisticated example of this concept.  The blanket licenses at 
issue gave the licensees ""the right to perform any and all of the compositions owned by the members or affiliates [of the 
American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers and Broadcast Music, Inc.] as often as the licensees desired for a 
stated term."" Broadcast Music, 441 U.S. at 5. In Broadcast Music, the Court refused to apply per se analysis to the blanket-
license arrangement.  Id. at 24. The Court observed that ""the individual composers and authors have neither agreed not to sell 
individually in any other market nor use the blanket license to mask price fixing."" Id. at 23-24. As the Court later commented in 
Maricopa County Medical Society, 457 U.S. at 355, ""although there was little competition among individual composers for their 
separate compositions, the blanket-license arrangement did not place any restraint on the right of any individual copyright owner 
to sell his own compositions separately to any buyer at any price."" On remand, the court of appeals examined the blanket-
license arrangement under the rule of reason. Columbia Broadcasting Sys., 620 F.2d at 932. After observing that the plaintiff 
CBS had never attempted to purchase songs from individual copyright owners, the court ""agree[d] with the defendants that if that 
opportunity [to purchase from the individual owners] is fully available, and if the copyright owners retain unimpaired 
independence to set competitive prices for individual licenses to a licensee willing to deal with them, the blanket license is not a 
restraint of trade."" Id. at 936. These cases demonstrate that anticompetitive effect is not to be blithely assumed."
346,10," The fact that the wastepaper suppliers were able to pass the cost of bribing Amata on to Federal and charge an excessive 
price for raw wastepaper does not mean there has been a restraint of trade for purposes of the Sherman Act. Presumably, the 
suppliers were able to pass these costs on to Federal because of Amata's willingness to bind Federal to purchase contracts that 
were not in Federal's interest in return for bribes and kickbacks. While it is true that every purchase negotiated by Amata 
""restrained"" trade in that it involved the ""fixity"" of a price, the same is true of any contract between a buyer and a seller, and the "
347,," Sherman Act has never been interpreted to impose a general prohibition on commercial contracts. See NCAA, 468 U.S. at 98; 
United States v. Topco Assocs., 405 U.S. 596, 606, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515, 92 S. Ct. 1126 (1972)."
347,11," The facts of Bunker Ramo are similar to the facts in this case. In Bunker Ramo, the plaintiff alleged that one of its employees 
and a supplier had been engaged in a scheme in which the supplier submitted false invoices for goods never received by the 
plaintiff. The employee filled out false delivery receipts so that the plaintiff paid the supplier for the goods never received, and in 
return the employee received bribes from the supplier. 713 F.2d at 1275. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the 
district court's denial of the defendants' motion to dismiss the plaintiff's Sherman Act claim. The court found that bribing an agent 
as part of a scheme to defraud -- without allegations of additional behavior by the defendants that might give rise to an antitrust 
violation -- did not constitute a per se violation of the Sherman Act and was deficient under the rule of reason for lack of any 
anticompetitive effect.  Id. at 1284-85. Although Bunker Ramo involved only one supplier, the logic of Bunker Ramo applies 
equally well to this case."

348,13," Section 2(a) of the Robinson-Patman Act prohibits price discrimination ""where the effect of such discrimination may be 
substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent 
competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with the customers of

349,18, See supra note 13. 
350,19," Federal cites Grace v. E.J. Kozin Co., 538 F.2d 170, 174 (7th Cir. 1976), for the proposition that whenever bribery of a 
purchasing agent results in a higher price to the buyer there is injury ""entitled to redress under Section 2(c)."" Federal's reliance 
on that case is inapposite for two reasons. First, the case is easily distinguishable. Grace involved bribes paid by the defendant, 
a wholesaler of seafood, to a purchasing agent of another wholesaler, the plaintiff, in order to induce the plaintiff to purchase 
seafood from the defendant at unreasonably high prices.  Id. at 172. Moreover, the two wholesalers shared some of the same 
customers. Id.  Thus, the plaintiff and defendant were direct competitors in the same consumer market. Under those facts, it is 
possible to infer that the higher cost of seafood that the plaintiff paid as a result of the kickback scheme disadvantaged the 
plaintiff in its ability to compete with the defendant.  In this case, however, Federal and the wastepaper suppliers do not 
compete, see infra note 20, and they do not share any of the same customers. Second, and more importantly, the court in 
Grace, which was decided before Brunswick and J. Truett Payne, appears to adopt the automatic measure of damages that the 
Supreme Court rejected in J. Truett Payne. See Grace, 538 F.2d at 174 (upholding the district court's award of damages in the 
amount of ""commissions"" paid to the unfaithful purchasing agent). Indeed, Grace is cited by the Court in J. Truett Payne as a 
case approving the automatic damages theory. See 451 U.S. at 561 n.2. In light of the recent Supreme Court developments in 
the law of standing, it would be improper to rely on Grace."
350,20," In its briefs, Federal argues that it competes with the defendant wastepaper suppliers because -- to the extent that the 
defendant suppliers went along with Amata and bought wastepaper from uncooperative suppliers and resold it to Federal -- they 
competed with Federal to make purchases of wastepaper. This argument does not withstand close analysis and cannot provide "
351,," the basis for finding that Federal has standing. The defendant suppliers, when they bought wastepaper from uncooperative 
sellers, bought the wastepaper in order to resell it to Federal. They were acting as brokers. Federal, however, has not made any 
allegation that it has been injured in its ability to compete with the defendant suppliers in the brokerage business. All that Federal 
has alleged is that it purchases wastepaper to recycle it into paperboard. Since Federal has not alleged that it brokers 
wastepaper, it cannot argue that it has been injured in its ability to compete in the wastepaper brokerage business."
351,21," Since Count VII is directed only at Amata, who has not moved to have that count dismissed, the sufficiency of Count VII is not 
at issue in this motion. "
352,22," Federal has also alleged other predicate acts which are not covered by 9(b) and which are sufficient to support a RICO claim. 
See infra note 25."
352,23," Although McNally dealt with mail fraud, case law interpreting the mail fraud statute also applies to the wire fraud statute.  
United States v. Giovengo, 637 F.2d 941, 944 (3d Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1032, 68 L. Ed. 2d 228, 101 S. Ct. 1743 
(1981)."
352,24," The case law has elaborated on the specificity requirements of Rule 9(b). When factual allegations are based on information 
and belief, ""the complaint must set forth the source of the information and the reasons for the belief."" Andreo v. Friedlander, 
Gaines, Cohen, Rosenthal & Rosenberg, 651 F. Supp. 877, 880 (D. Conn. 1986) [hereinafter Andreo I]. In addition, ""fraud 
allegations ought to specify the time, place, speaker, and content of the alleged misrepresentation."" DiVittorio v. Equidyne 
Extractive Indus., Inc., 822 F.2d 1242, 1247 (2d Cir. 1987). At the same time, however, Rule 9(b) does not require a plaintiff to 
set forth a complete history of every transaction. Accord General Accident Ins. Co. of Amer. v. Fidelity and Deposit Co. of Ind., 
598 F. Supp. 1223, 1232 (E.D.  Pa. 1984) (""If the fraud allegedly involved a course of conduct over an extended period of time or 
series of transactions, it is not necessary to recite, in detail, the facts of each transaction of the fraudulent scheme.""). 
Nonetheless, to survive a motion to dismiss and to satisfy Rule 9(b)'s purpose of providing fair notice to defendants, protecting 
defendants from unwarranted harm to reputation, and reducing the frequency of strike suits, see DiVittorio, 822 F.2d at 1247 
(discussing the purpose of Rule 9(b)), a plaintiff must specify at least one occasion of fraud.  Additional instances of fraud can be 
elicited with the tools of discovery. "
353,25," To the extent that Federal's RICO claim is brought under section 1962(c) and relies on predicate acts other than mail and wire 
fraud, amendment is not necessary. In particular, Federal has alleged a violation of ""the Hobbs Act, Title 18, United States Code, 
Section 1951 et seq."" Presumably, Federal means 18 U.S.C. ยง 1952, which prohibits interstate travel or the use of interstate 
facilities, including the mail, to ""promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the promotion, management, establishment, or 
carrying on, of any unlawful activity."" 18 U.S.C. ยง 1952(a) (1982). Unlawful activity includes commercial bribery prohibited by 
state law, Perrin v. United States, 444 U.S. 37, 50, 62 L. Ed. 2d 199, 100 S. Ct. 311 (1979), and in Connecticut commercial 
bribery is a crime, see Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. ยงยง 53a-160 and -161 (West 1985). The court notes that section 53a-160 requires 
that the bribes be made with ""intent to influence [the employee's] conduct in relation to his employer's or principal's affairs."" Id. ยง 
53a-160. As noted in the text supra, the specificity requirements of Rule 9(b) do not apply to allegations of intent. Nonetheless, 
Federal must still plead facts which give rise to a strong inference of intent. See Connecticut Nat'l Bank, 808 F.2d at 962. The 
court believes that Federal's allegations that bribes were paid by the defendant wastepaper suppliers to a purchasing agent of 
Federal are sufficient to establish intent on the part of the suppliers to influence the affairs of Federal. "
354,26," HN13[
]  18 U.S.C. ยง 1961(5) (1982) states: ""pattern of racketeering activity"" requires at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the effective 
date of this chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years (excluding any period of imprisonment) after the 
commission of a prior act of racketeering activity[.]"
354,27," Ianniello involved a ""continuing criminal enterprise"" to skim profits from bars and restaurants owned by the defendants and to 
evade taxes.  808 F.2d at 189. Some district courts in this circuit have apparently tried to limit Ianniello by requiring that a plaintiff 
allege separate criminal episodes when the enterprise is a lawful entity, rather than a ""continuing criminal enterprise."" See e.g., 
Mastercraft Indus., Inc. v. Breining, 664 F. Supp. 859, 860-61 (S.D.N.Y. 1987). This court believes, however, that Beck 
eliminates the multiple episode requirement in all cases. Although Beck also involved a criminal enterprise, see 802 F.2d at 48-
49, the court in Beck clearly stated that ""Ianniello confirms that two related predicate acts will suffice to establish a pattern under 
18 U.S.C. sec. 1961(5)."" Id.  at 51. In any event, since this court has determined that Federal has alleged criminal enterprises 
made up of Amata and the wastepaper suppliers, Ianniello clearly applies. "
355,28," Part of the plaintiffs' amended complaint in Beck was dismissed on other grounds, so that the only remaining claims related to 
the sale of the U.S. collateral. See 820 F.2d at 49-50."
355,29," Although Furman involved a legitimate partnershp regulated by New York law, see 828 F.2d at 900, this court sees no reason 
why its logic would not apply to criminal enterprises as well."
355,30," The fact that the defendants who are alleged to have engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity are also the members of the 
alleged enterprises is not fatal to a RICO complaint. Although an enterprise is ""an entity separate and apart from the pattern of 
activity in which it engages,"" United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583, 69 L. Ed. 2d 246, 101 S. Ct. 2524 (1981), there is ""no 
reason why a single entity could not be both the RICO 'person' and one of a number of members of the RICO 'enterprise.'"" 
Cullen v. Margiotta, 811 F.2d 698, 729-30 (2d Cir.), cert.  denied, 483 U.S. 1021, 107 S. Ct. 3266, 97 L. Ed. 2d 764 (1987). "
356,31," Although Federal's amended complaint is not specific in its allegations of the several criminal enterprises, and indeed the 
RICO count merely states that Amata ""conspired, established, conducted, and participated"" with the various defendants ""in an 
enterprise engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity,"" the necessary elements of a RICO enterprise can be inferred from the 
amended complaint as a whole. In particular, the amended complaint describes the conduct and the goals of the members of the 
enterprises. To ""plead the RICO enterprise in terms of the conduct and goals of those allegedly a part of the enterprise is not a 
bar to the RICO cause of action."" In re Gas Reclamation, Inc. Sec. Litig., 659 F. Supp. 493, 516 (S.D.N.Y. 1987). The allegations 
in the amended complaint are sufficient to put the defendants on notice of the claims against them and are satisfactory under the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedures. See Seville Indus. Mach. Corp. v. Southmost Mach. Corp., 742 F.2d 786, 790 (3d Cir. 1984) 
(notice pleading sufficient for the enterprise element of a RICO claim), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1211, 84 L. Ed. 2d 327, 105 S. Ct. 
1179 (1985). This court disagrees with the conclusion reached in Plount v. American Home Assurance Co., 668 F. Supp. 204, 
206-07 (S.D.N.Y. 1987), that Ianniello and its progeny presuppose and therefore require a specifically pleaded complaint. Rule 
9(b) limits specificity in pleading to averments of fraud. With respect to allegations of enterprise, Federal need only provide some 
factual basis for the legal conclusion that an enterprise existed. Cf.  Andreo I, 651 F. Supp. at 883 (addressing the pleading 
requirements for allegations of conspiracy). To require more would conflict with RICO's remedial purpose, see Sedima, 473 U.S. 
at 498, and the Supreme Court's directive that ""RICO is to be read broadly,"" id. at 497. "
361,1," The Appellate Division also certified the following question: ""Was the order of this Court, which reversed the six judgments 
(denominated orders) of the Supreme Court, properly made?"" Because the order appealed from finally determines these special 
proceedings (see, Matter of Abrams [Anonymous], 62 NY2d 183, 192), the certified question was unnecessary and need not be 
answered. "
362,2," Pertinent language from General Business Law ยง 343, the provision which confers investigatory powers on the Attorney-
General, illustrates the broad scope of that authority.  The statute authorizes an investigation ""[whenever] it shall appear to the 
attorney general * * * that any person or persons, partnership, corporation, company, trust or association shall have engaged in 
or engages in or is about to engage in any act or practice by this article [the Donnelly Act] prohibited or declared to be illegal, or * 
* * has assisted or participated in any plan, scheme, agreement or combination of the nature described herein, or whenever he 
believes it to be in the public interest that an investigation be made"".  That such an investigation may include the use of 
subpoenas and interrogatories is not disputed here."
362,3," Thus, the dissent's major premise -- that the Donnelly Act does not expressly declare the brewers' practice to be illegal -- is 
flawed.  The Act, by its very broad terms, declares all restraints on trade to be illegal; it is only by judicial interpretation that some 
practices have been held to be outside the act's scope.  And, as noted above (supra, at 332, n 2), the Attorney-General's 
investigatory powers are equally broad.  Thus, our decision to allow this investigation to proceed does not, as the dissent 
suggests, depend on the kind of extrapolation of legislative intent that we resisted in CPC Intl. v McKesson Corp. (70 NY2d 268). "

Monfort of Colorado, Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 107 S. Ct. 484, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427 (1986), and the result would appear to be the same. 
Cargill involved determination of standing under ยง 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 18, the section on which the relevant portion 
of 49 U.S.C. ยง 1378 is modeled, and held the status of competitor does not confer antitrust standing in the absence of an 
antitrust injury as defined by cases applying the Clayton Act. "
373,1," The Court rejects the Defendants' arguments that Komm v. McFliker, 662 F.Supp. 924 (E.D. Mo. 1987), misconstrued Terre Du 
Lac Association, Inc. v. Terre Du Lac, Inc., 772 F.2d 467 (8th Cir. 1985), in holding that a discharged employee has standing to 
sue under RICO. Terre Du Lac correctly reaffirmed its earlier holding in Alexander Grant & Company v. Tiffany Industires, Inc., 
742 F.2d 408 (8th Cir. 1984) (vacated on other grounds, in light of Sedima, 105 S.Ct. 3275 (1985), that a Plaintiff need not be a 
target of racketeering activity to have standing. Thus standing requirements for RICO civil suits and antitrust suits are not 
comparable despite similarly worded statutes. "
374,2," The merits of Plaintiff's wrongful termination claim, including his contract theory, are dubious at best. Nonetheless, the 
remainder of this case belongs in state court. There is no true diversity jurisdiction.  Aldinger v. Howard, 427 U.S. 1, 96 S.Ct. 
2413 (1976). Nor does it appear from the cases cited by the parties that the Arkansas appellate courts have squarely decided 
whether, under what circumstances, and to what effect an administrative factual determination arising from the denial of 
unemployment benefits is deemed to constitute an absolute bar to further litigation concerning the reason that a plaintiff became 
unemployed. Cf.  Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315, 63 S.Ct. 1098 (1943) (requiring abstension and dismissal by the federal 
court where state law is unclear or unsettled)."

which would be admissible upon the trial on the merits becomes part of the record on the trial and need not be repeated upon

Co., 293 U.S. 268, 279, 79 L. Ed. 356, 55 S. Ct. 182 (1934). The outer boundaries of a product market are determined by reasonable interchangeability of use or the cross-elasticity of 
demand between the product itself and substitutes for it. However, within this broad market, well-defined submarkets may 
exist which, in themselves, constitute product markets for antitrust purposes. Brown Shoe Company v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 325, 82 L. Ed. 2d 510, 82 S. Ct. 1502 (1962)."
394,7," Wal-Mart and Eckerd Drugs would be stores with their own ""minilab"" for film processing. "
395,8," In his Affidavit Professor Saving writes: The ""quick"" finishing market is separate and distinct from the wholesale photofinishing market in that it represents those 
consumers who place a high value on time. The Photofinishing Industry Report indicates that in 1986 minilab processing 
had an average cost of $ 8.23. Film processed in large labs ranged in cost from $ 5.36 retailed at Department Stores, $ 
5.34 retailed at Drug Stores, $ 4.71 retailed at Discount Stores, $ 4.23 retailed at Supermarkets, and $ 3.85 retailed through 
mail order. The weighted average retail cost of photofinishing in large labs was $ 4.57.  Thus, minilab film processing was 
80 percent more costly than large lab processing. This large price differential is suggestive of significant market 
segmentation. . . . . Important for the issue at hand is the fact the ""captive"" labs do not represent a source of processing for retail outlets that 
are not part of the integrated system. Thus, even though the ""captive"" photofinishing labs are part of the overall supply of 
photofinishing services, they may not exert significant competitive pressure on the price and terms upon which the 
independent wholesale photofinishing lab services are available. Affidavit of Thomas R. Saving at pp. 5-6."

482,2, This includes the restriction on the provision of information services in section II(D)(1) of the decree.
482,3," At the time the decree was entered, the Department of Justice agreed to report to the Court every three years concerning the 
continuing need for the restrictions imposed by the decree. See AT&T, 552 F. Supp. at 195. The first such report was submitted 
on February 2, 1987. After consideration of that filing, the responses of parties and intervenors, and three days of oral argument, 
the Court issued the Opinion referred to at p. 2, supra, granting in part and denying in part the Department's motion."
482,4," For example, the Court found, based on the studies of the Department of Justice's own expert, that only one-tenth of one 
percent of inter-LATA traffic volume, generated by one customer out of one million, is carried through non- Regional Company 
facilities to reach an interexchange carrier.  Opinion, 673 F. Supp. at 540. The local monopolies in the various areas where the 
Regional Companies operate are thus virtually as tight as they were in 1982 when the decree was signed, when the restrictions 
were first imposed, and when the same bottleneck monopolies were controlled by the Bell System."

French creators of their system must have known that to make the telephone company a potential competitor for every provider 
of information in France could only have had disastrous consequences. "
483,6," For example, the Court found with respect to manufacturing, where there has been four years of experience in a competitive 
market to compare against the market dominated by the Bell System monopoly, that ""there has been a flowering of research, 
development, innovation, introduction of new products, and quality assurance; new firms have entered the market; prices of 
equipment have declined dramatically (according to some by as much as fifty percent in some categories); and competition 
flourishes in a market that had seen relatively little of it before. The equipment market now consists of some six or eight very 
large firms, one to two hundred medium-sized firms, and hundreds of still smaller, vigorous and inventive firms, some of them in 
profitable relationships with one or more of the Regional Companies."" Opinion, 673 F. Supp. at 560 (footnotes omitted)."

483,11," In its approval of the decree in this case, the Court took account of such public policies as the congressional expectation of 
universal telephone service and the desirability under the First Amendment of achieving diversity in the sources of public 
information.  AT&T, 552 F. Supp. at 183, 191-94; see also Opinion, 673 F. Supp. at 583-87. "
484,12," The term ""videotex"" refers to a great variety of easy-to-use interactive data services. According to the Huber Report submitted 
by the Department of Justice in connection with the triennial review, ""videotex arranges information in a text or graphic format on 
a video display with user input through a keyboard."" P. Huber, ""The Geodesic Network: 1987 Report on Competition in the 
Telephone Industry,"" (hereinafter referred to as the ""Huber Report"") at 1.29 n.46. The Department has asserted that the Huber 
Report formed the principal factual basis for its position in this Court on the decree restrictions."
484,13," Indeed, several efforts to provide videotex services have failed. In March 1986, Knight-Ridder Newspaper Inc.'s viewtron 
service, which provided home subscribers in several markets with news, stock prices, and shopping information, folded without 
having made a profit. Around the same time, the Times Mirror Company's gateway videotex services closed down after losing 
approximately $ 30 million. Washington Post, ""Videotex's Timing is Questioned,"" March 20, 1986, section E1. However, 
Compuserve, Inc., a videotex provider, claims to have 375,000 subscribers to its consumer information services at the present 
time, offering 1,100 consumer information services and data bases."
484,14," The Court last fall listed some of the potential information services, as follows: Without attempting to be exhaustive, the following lists some of the more obvious videotex-related economic services that 
exist elsewhere and that might be made available in this country: (1) in banking, videotex could give customers direct and 
immediate account information and fund transfer capability; (2) in brokerage, there could be instant evaluation of current 
portfolios and access to alternative investment opportunities; (3) with respect to customer service by a variety of business 
enterprises, arrangements could be made for immediate access to information about outstanding balances, order 
fulfillment, accrued interest, and the like; and (4) with respect to shopping services, videotex could provide direct and 
immediate access to the prices and descriptions of a wide range of products and services that could be purchased 
electronically. Outside the economic sphere, videotex is used in France, and could presumably be applied in the United States, for such 
services as (1) travel information, restaurant reviews and reservations, hotel and rental car information, and airline 
schedules; (2) instantaneous access to ticketing for sports, musical, cultural, and entertainment events; (3) information 
concerning meetings of associations, including schedules, performers, and speakers; (4) social messaging; (5) access to 
federal and local governmental information; (6) language instruction; (7) reprints of newspaper and magazine articles; and 
(8) employment services. Opinion, 673 F. Supp. at 589-90 (footnotes omitted)."
484,15," In this respect, the transmission of information services is unlike the provision of information content, telecommunications 
manufacturing, and long distance services -- all of which can and do function exceedingly well without Regional Company 
participation. "
485,16," See Reply of Hayes Microcomputer Products, Inc., at 4."
485,17," Whether such a mass market will actually be created will depend of course on the organizational, technical, and marketing skill 
of the Regional Companies."
485,18," Under the decree as it now stands, the Regional Companies may not perform most of the ""gateway"" functions necessary to 
information transmission."
485,19, The decrease in rates nationally is estimated at thirty-five percent since divestiture in 1984.
485,20," Prior to the AT&T divestiture, the Bell System furnished telephones to subscribers only on the basis of an unending monthly 
rental, without any opportunity for purchase. Now telephone instruments are available for sale in all colors, shapes, and degrees 
of sophistication, at prices amounting to a small fraction of the total amount of the overall rental fees."
485,21," To cite only the most obvious, features such as automatic call repetition; one-button calling for dozens, even hundreds, of 
numbers; cordless phones; phones that respond to verbal commands -- all of them non-existent or exceedingly rare just three or 
four years ago -- are now commonplace in many households. Mobile phones in automobiles and airplanes are fast coming to 
match the ubiquity of these features. "
486,22," The U.S. West proposal was advanced jointly with the Regional Companies' traditional opponent in this field, the American 
Newspaper Publishers Association. As such, it represented the most substantial and fully considered of the concrete 
submissions. The proposals of the other Regional Companies were far more diffuse. See infra."
486,23," Hearing of July 1, 1987, Tr. at 362."
486,24," In a characteristic reversal of position, U.S. West dismissed the French Teletel system as already obsolete and not particularly 
well suited to the American environment, just as soon as the Court appeared to have accepted the original U.S. West position in 
its September 10, 1987 Opinion, and as it might have appeared to that company that its demands could therefore be safely 
ratcheted upward. See U.S. West Memorandum at 2-3."
486,25," Networks have been developed by entities such as CompuServe, The Source, Trinex, General Electric Information Services, 
Quantum Computer Services, and the two independent telephone companies, each with its own idiosyncracy and particular 
modes of technology."
486,26," These terminals are relatively inexpensive and unsophisticated, but they are adequate as parts of an information system."
486,27," Some commentators have suggested that information services will not survive in this country without such a program for the 
cost-free dissemination of dumb terminals. That may well be the case, but it is not an issue for the Court to decide. The United 
States government is unlikely to adopt such a policy, and the Court has neither reason nor power to require it or the Regional 
Companies to do so. This is, to be sure, an option that might be pursued by those interested in entering the market, but it 
involves a business decision unrelated to questions of antitrust law or enforcement. In fact, the Court's influence in this matter is limited to resolution of the question whether the Regional Companies will be 
permitted to engage in the transmission of information services. Once such permission is granted, it is solely for the individual 
companies to determine whether their entry into that market would be economically feasible and otherwise desirable. See also 
note 17, supra. Under the decree, the Regional Companies may not engage in the manufacture of consumer premises equipment, see section 
VIII(A), and dumb terminals fall within that prohibition.  Opinion, 673 F. Supp. at 596. However, nothing in the decree would 
preclude the Regional Companies from providing such hardware to the consumers, if it were obtained from a third source. "
487,28," The Department of Justice likewise expended much effort on matters already decided. Thus, the Court was told once again 
that the Department would prefer a complete removal of the information services restriction as of all other restrictions on the 
Regional Companies; that the Court's imposition of restrictions to prevent anticompetitive activities would amount to an 
assumption of regulatory functions; that requirements of nondiscrimination or of structural separation to prevent cross-subsidies 
are beyond judicial authority, and the like. See Response of the Department of Justice, filed November 16, 1987. In what must 
be a unique occurrence, at least in this litigation, the Department of Justice actually found the proposal submitted by U.S. West, 
a Regional Company not known for the modesty of its ambitions, to be too restrictive. Response of the Department of Justice at 
6-9. The Department's position becomes more understandable perhaps when it is considered that its officials met ex parte with 
Regional Company executives regarding the removal of the decree restrictions long before the triennial review (see note 3, 
supra) and even long before the Huber Report (see note 12, supra) was written and submitted."
487,29," For example, NYNEX proposes that the Court expand permitted infrastructure components to include store and forward, 
navigation translation, custom screens, and transaction support. Its only justification for this expansion is that those features 
would ""create a network environment that encourages the offering and use of a wide variety of information services."" NYNEX 
Memorandum at 8. NYNEX neglects to explain, however, how the Regional Companies might offer these services without 
manipulating content. While some of these activities might be accomplished without interfering with content, there is no 
guarantee that it will be so. Take, for example, credit validation services, which NYNEX would seek to provide as a ""transaction 
support."" One method of validation involves the use of computer software to verify the identity of a merchant, route the query to 
a proper back-end network, log the response, record the data, and send confirmation to the merchant -- a clear manipulation of 
content. Huber Report at 12.7-12.8"
487,30," Some of the Regional Companies freely acknowledge that their proposals would cross the line between transmission and 
content. See, e.g., Southwestern Bell's comment that ""it is not enough that the telephone network be open only to the accurate 
transmission of information"" (Memorandum at 18), and Pacific Telesis' observation that ""some may claim that our proposed 
order goes beyond the intent of the Opinion in permitting Regional Company activities"" (Memorandum at 1). As explained in greater detail below, despite the Court's willingness to permit divergences from the Teletel model, it will not 
endorse Regional Company entry into transmission activities absent a showing that these activities will not involve content. "
488,31," It may be that some of the parties' submissions are deliberately vague to achieve a quick entry into content, or it may be, on 
the other hand, that it is not possible to describe the ingredients of an as yet unknown and untried system that is limited to 
transmission."
488,32," As indicated infra, some transmission activities necessitate relatively slight changes in content. For that reason, among others, 
the line between permissible transmission and impermissible generation or manipulation of content is not always obvious."
488,33," For example, following the Court's decision with respect to the manufacturing restriction, some of the Regional Companies 
claimed that they had made elaborate plans regarding research and development preparatory to fabrication, on the theory that 
this was clearly permitted to them, although the trial record and the Court's Opinion which described that record clearly showed 
that research and development had been the facet of manufacturing that was the primary means for Bell System discrimination.  
United States v. Western Electric Co., 675 F. Supp. 655, 662-63 (D.D.C. 1987). One of the Regional Companies, Bell Atlantic, 
actually claimed that the ""decision unlawfully expands the scope of the manufacturing prohibition"" and another, Bell South, 
expressed ""utter frustration at a ruling which goes far beyond clarifying any ambiguity . . . ."" Telecommunications Reports, 
December 7, 1987, at 2. Even the Department of Justice, otherwise entirely in agreement with the Regional Companies, 
concluded, based on the record, that ""manufacturing"" includes research and development for purposes of the decree. Opinion, 
675 F. Supp. at 664-65. At least one Regional Company, Southwestern Bell, was found to have engaged in activity which violated the manufacturing 
restriction when it acquired Tsunami Technologies Corporation. See Report of the United States Concerning Southwestern Bell 
Corporation's Violations of the Modification of Final Judgment, February 12, 1988. "
489,34," See, e.g., Bell Atlantic Memorandum at 1-2, 3-6; Southwestern Bell Memorandum at 4."
489,35," Under the decree, the section VIII(D) electronic publishing restriction reins in AT&T. The suggestion presently made is that this 
restriction be extended to the Regional Companies in lieu of the section II(D)(1) information restriction. See note 39, infra."
489,36, Bell Atlantic Memorandum at 4.
489,37," The Court today approves Regional Company entry into the electronic mail market, but this is done after a separate evaluation 
of that market in a concrete setting. "
490,38," The five functions referred to in the September 10, 1987 Opinion are (1) data transmission, (2) address translation, (3) 
protocol conversion, (4) billing management, and (5) introductory information content."
490,39," Naturally, the text of this definition will have to be changed slightly to accommodate the present problem, so that the minimum 
prohibition will read as follows: . . . the provision by a Regional Company of any information which that Regional Company or its affiliates has, or has 
caused to be, originated, authored, compiled, collected, or edited, or in which it has a direct or indirect financial or 
proprietary interest, and which is disseminated to an unaffiliated person through telecommunications."
490,40," Among other services that are also clearly outside the transmission function are the maintenance of user profiles and their 
sale or release to others. See U.S. West Memorandum at 12-14; PacTel Memorandum at 16. Such profiles typically contain 
detailed information on users' favorite services, times of use, monthly expenditures, and usage habits, which would provide the 
Regional Companies with an almost insuperable advantage vis-a-vis other providers as a marketing tool. Regional Company 
control of such data would also raise very sensitive privacy questions. See Response of CompuServe at 14-15. "
491,41," It is possible that no transmission functions other than those so described are conceptually or technologically feasible. See 
also note 31, supra."
491,42," The direction of technology and the molding of the network must be informed by the whims of the consumer and the state of 
scientific experience. In order for the United States to develop a vigorous information services network, and to establish and 
maintain a leadership position in the world market, the Regional Companies should have available the means to design and 
administer a networking facility. Insofar as this goal is attainable without interfering with the core decree restrictions (e.g., the 
generation and manipulation of content), the Court will not seek to introduce any artificial hurdles."
491,43," In this respect, proposals with the imprimatur of the Federal Communications Commission will be considered to be prima facie 
valid, as the Court recognizes that that body, through its studies in Computer III and enhanced services, has experience in this 
field."
491,44," Audiotex allows consumer access to information through a regular telephone line and the use of a touchtone keypad. Huber 
Report at 6.3 n.8. Unlike in videotex, the information is not received in written form either on a video display screen or on paper. 
Huber Report at 1.29."
491,45," ""976"" services are public announcement services, accessed through the local exchange companies, which provide short, 
uncomplicated, low-value, mass market information. Information flow is one way -- to the user. To encourage frequent, impulse 
usage, billing is direct to the telephone number, on a per-call basis, without prior subscription. The access lines linking the 
switches of the information services providers to the public network have a 976 dial code that engages special telephone 
company billing services. The user is billed an additional per-call amount on his monthly telephone bill; the revenue from that 
extra charge is divided between the Regional Company and the information service provider. See Huber Report at 8.1, 8.3, 8.6. "
492,46," Home banking, brokerage, retail services information, messaging, bulletin boards, and other such services are particularly 
adaptable to audiotex. See Opinion, 673 F. Supp. at 589-90."
492,47," Most American consumers already own or rent the access device required by audiotex -- the telephone. Thus, audiotex could 
be enjoyed without the additional expense and bother of obtaining a separate terminal. See Response of Public Utilities 
Commission of California at 3-4."
492,48," Limited objections to this expansion have been expressed by some competing audiotex providers. See Phonequest, et al., 
Response at 3-4. The primary objection of the opponents appears to be that ""there is no possible way in which the independents 
could compete with the [Regional Companies]."" Id. at 4. These competitors fail to explain, however, why the potential for 
anticompetitive behavior is stronger in the audiotex field than in videotex. The mere fact that entry of the Regional Companies 
into the field will provide stiffer competition is not grounds for excluding them from the market. See note 88, infra."
492,49," See, e.g., Pacific Telesis Memorandum at 19; Bell Atlantic Memorandum at 18; BellSouth Memorandum at 18."
492,50, BellSouth Memorandum at 18.
492,51," Bell Atlantic Reply at 10. These bizarre interpretations of the scope of ""White Pages"" directories are yet another example of 
how the Regional Companies, or some of them, would abuse any flexibility that might be afforded to them. "
493,52," By the same token, the Court hereby denies requests by competitors of the Regional Companies for a reexamination of its 
decision to allow Regional Companies to provide ""White Pages"" electronic directories. See, e.g., Digital Directory Assistance, 
Inc., Memorandum at 3."

interrelated with information content.  Opinion, 673 F. Supp. at 595. Menu service may not be provided as part of gateway 
introductory information. "

494,57," As the Teletel network has become more sophisticated, the French telephone company has refined the kiosk system. Initially, 
a single charging rate was in effect for all services. To boost growth in kiosk services for businesses and professional users, 
which may cost more to develop but often receive fewer calls than services aimed at the general public, Teletel introduced 
multirate kiosk charging in the summer of 1987. Accessing services in the higher billing category is thus more expensive for 
users, but in return, the service providers receive a larger payment for each call."

495,62," Synchronous data transmission differs from asynchronous data transmission in that the transmitting and receiving devices can 
have character synchronization for a significant period of time. During the time that the devices are synchronized, it is possible to 
transfer data without marking the extremes of each character. This makes it possible to omit stop and start bits and increase 
transmission efficiency and speed. J. Hammond & P. O'Reilly, Performance Analysis of Local Computer Networks at 38 (1986)."
495,63, Ameritech Reply at 4.
495,64," However, it appears that the Regional Companies have requested the FCC only for authority to perform async./X.25 and 
async./X.75 protocol conversion services. Tynmet-McDonnell Douglas Memorandum at 11. If the FCC adopts that standard, the 
Regional Companies will of course not be free to exceed the limits set by that body."

Memorandum at 18."
495,66," The Court sees no reason, at this stage of the AT&T case, to endorse a return to the detailed and complicated framework 
considered and rejected by the parties as a possible means of settlement in that suit. As might be inferred from the names by 
which those negotiations have become known, Quagmire I & II, the entire subject became a hopeless web of intricate, issue-by-
issue micromanagement that was destined for failure. See, generally, S. Coll, The Deal of the Century: The Breakup of AT&T, at 
252-56; 297-301. "
496,67," In the Order appended hereto, the decree will be amended to except from the prohibition of section II(D)(1) Regional Company 
provision of certain ""transmission"" functions as they relate to information services. Concurrently, the amendment makes clear 
that the Regional Companies' non-discrimination obligations are to continue in the face of that relaxation."
496,68," Async/X.25 Order, 100 F.C.C.2d at 1104-12; Computer III Phase II Order, 2 FCC Rcd. at 3078-82. The fundamental precepts 
underlying the safeguards adopted by the FCC are that: (1) transparent transmission services should continue to be available to 
the public; (2) the Regional Companies should not be allowed to discriminate against competing information service vendors or 
their customers; and (3) the Regional Companies' monopoly ratepayers should not bear the costs of these competitive services."
496,69," The announcement of the possible use of this sanction, while severe, is intended to place the Regional Companies on notice 
that the Court expects their complete fidelity to the decree in entering this new market."
496,70," Since the Court did not discuss this topic in its September 10, 1987 Opinion, somewhat greater elaboration is necessary here 
than with respect to the ""transmission"" discussion, supra. "

course, like all restrictions, they are subject to removal pursuant to section VIII(C)."
497,74," Enhanced Service Providers Memorandum at 4-5; MCI Memorandum at 2; Compuserve Memorandum at 8; Consumer

497,75," E.g., Information Industry Association Response at 4-11; Committee of Corporate Telecommunications Users Response at 7-
9. One draft order, submitted jointly by U.S. West and the ANPA, proposes that the Regional Companies be permitted to provide 
storage on a wholesale basis to information providers, but prohibited from such provision on a retail basis to end users. U.S. 
West Memorandum at 14-16; ANPA Memorandum at 15. The Court rejects this distinction as being too difficult to administer in 
practice without the endless submission of requests for construction."
497,76, Southwestern Bell Memorandum at 9.
497,77," There is little dispute as to the desirability of allowing the Regional Companies to engage in storage to this limited extent. See, 
e.g., Consumer Federation of America Reply at 5, ""The only storage and messaging functions in which the Regional Companies 
should engage are those internal network functions which are fundamental to prompt, high-quality interconnection between ISPs 
and end-users."" "
498,78, Ameritech Memorandum at 8; Bell Atlantic Memorandum at 8.
498,79," See Ameritech Memorandum at 9; Bell Atlantic Memorandum at 8. It may be true that some information providers would 
choose to obtain storage capabilities from the Regional Companies should that service be available through the gateway. 
However, this service, like many others relating to computer technology, is also available through independent providers, and it 
is therefore neither necessary that the gateway furnish this facility, nor will the gateway necessarily provide the most cost 
efficient storage."
498,80," The term ""voice messaging"" encompasses a wide assortment of caller-directed, transient storage, limited-duration exchange 
telecommunications services. The technology allows a caller, in response to a busy signal or no answer, to record a brief message and then provide the calling 
instrument, the originating PBX, or the local exchange central office with routing instructions and a limited duration during which 
the system will attempt to complete the call and let the called party accept the recorded message at his discretion. In the event 
of an interexchange call, the originating caller rather than the local carrier selects the interexchange carrier. Because the caller 
must identify himself, the called party can accept the message or merely hang up; by agreeing to receive the message the called 
party becomes liable for the cost of the service. MessagePhone Memorandum at 3-4. Voice messaging is thus a purely unidirectional transmission. It is strictly caller-directed and can be initiated with as little as a 
single digit or character code. There is little to differentiate voice messaging from a standard telephone call other than by the 
incorporation of a short time delay for message delivery."
498,81," Voice storage and retrieval systems, in generic terms, act as sophisticated versions of an answering machine. Typically, 
incoming calls are intercepted by equipment which acquires analog speech, converts it to digital forms, and stores the digital 
version until it is required for retrieval in analog form. Huber Report at 10.1."
498,82," VSR and electronic mail services are much alike, except in the form of the information content: in VSR, the information is 
stored as a voice message, in electronic mail services, it is stored as a printed message."
498,83," In the simplest sense, such use of storage capability allows for time-delay services, that is, messages from an information 
provider or a user are stored until the particular telephone line is available or the called person or machine becomes free."
498,84," The fact that content might be converted to digital form for storage, and then returned to analog form for retrieval and 
transmission to the called party does not place it within the realm of content manipulation. For practical purposes, the stored 
information reaches the intended recipient in the same content form as it was in when it was delivered."
498,85," The experience of foreign telephone companies shows that these services are an important gateway function. Although the 
French Teletel system does not provide electronic mail now, it is installing that capability. In Japan, Canada, West Germany, 
Ireland, Denmark, Belgium, and Holland, the telephone companies all provide this service. Bell Atlantic Memorandum at 11. 
Voice messaging has become so popular in Japan that consumers send 60,000 voice messages each day. See 
Communications Week, September 28, 1987, at 56; How Tokyo Is Turning Telephones Into Answering Machines, Business 
Week, February 16, 1987 at 104C. "
499,86," See, e.g., OCTEL Memorandum at 12."
499,87," In one sense, call answering, voice mail, and electronic mail offerings are independent services for which competitive markets 
currently exist. See, e.g., MCI Memorandum at 3. In this view, the question simply is whether Regional Company entry into these 
markets would have positive or negative competitive effects."
499,88," HN3[
] It is of course a fundamental principle of jurisprudence that the antitrust laws protect competition, not competitors. Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 320, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510, 82 S. Ct. 1502 (1962). These laws seek to foster 
competition by increasing the number of providers in the marketplace and thereby allowing the consumer, through demand for 
services, to select the winning firm. It is likewise the purpose of the decree to allow consumers to reap the benefits of 
competition in telecommunications. The Regional Companies should not be excluded from this market simply because, due to 
their size and interest in the communications field, they would likely be formidable competitors therein. To decide otherwise 
would be in effect to grant exclusive franchises to the current providers. See also note 48, supra. "

500,90," As indicated above (p. 5 n.11, supra), this is not the first time that the Court has weighed matters of public import in ruling on 
questions of interpretation under the decree. The earliest such consideration occurred when the decree itself was modified and 
approved six years ago, in part because of public policy considerations which extended beyond the category of antitrust 
violations. At that time, the Court noted that the interests of universal service, for example, strongly supported entry of the 
decree, as well as the adoption of changes that allowed the Regional Companies to market customer premises equipment and 
Yellow Pages directories. The most recent such consideration occurred only last month, when the Court approved waivers of the 
terms of the decree, the public interest in receiving a particular service being at issue. See, e.g., United States v. Western 
Electric Co., C.A. No. 82-0192, slip op.  1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13536 (D.D.C. Feb. 8, 1988) (time and weather information)."

516,4," After the 1987 revision, section 76-10-1602 now lists the several statutory types of bribery individually, including commercial 
bribery under section 76-6-508. "
517,5," 18 U.S.C. ยง 1961(5) defines ""pattern of racketeering activity"" as ""at least two acts of racketeering activity . . . ."" This definition 
has been the subject of considerable judicial attention following the landmark United States Supreme Court decision in Sedima, 
S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., Inc., 473 U.S. 479, 105 S. Ct. 3275, 87 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1985). In its now famous footnote 14, the Court 
noted the lack of specificity in the federal definition of pattern of racketeering activity. After a brief discussion of suggestions in 
the legislative history that ""pattern"" connotes ""continuity plus relationship"" rather than merely an enumeration of acts, the Court 
observed: Significantly, in defining ""pattern"" in a later provision of the same bill, Congress was more enlightening: ""criminal conduct 
forms a pattern if it embraces criminal acts that have the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods 
of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events."" 18 U.S.C. ยง 
3575(e). This language may be useful in interpreting other sections of the Act."
517,105," S. Ct. at 3285. The pattern definition noted by the Supreme Court is substantially identical to the definition contained in the 
RICE Act. Thus, the pattern analysis under the RICE Act does not operate from the same sparse language of the RICO Act. "
519,1," Section 2(c) of the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C.A. ยง 13(c) (1973), expressly makes accepting a ""commission"" without 
performing real work in connection with a sale of goods illegal under federal law. "
520,2," The majority relies on federal cases rejecting the ""numerosity"" requirement of group boycott for the view that something less is 
now needed to constitute a group boycott. While it is true that these cases have dropped the ""numerosity"" requirement, i.e., 
concern about the number of conspirators in a horizontal relationship, they nonetheless still require the other elements of a 
group boycott: concerted refusal to deal, enlistment of others, and a target. See, e.g., Com-Tel, Inc. v. DuKane Corp., 669 F.2d 
404, 414 (6th Cir. 1982)."
520,3," The majority suggests that a boycott under their ""general definition"" differs from the term group boycott as it evolved under the 
per se doctrine. Ironically, their definition was taken from one of the landmark cases defining a per se illegal group boycott. The 
definition extracted from the Supreme Court's opinion was one which the Court offered to explain the term ""boycott"" in common 
parlance.  St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Barry, 438 U.S. 531, 545-46, 57 L. Ed. 2d 932, 98 S. Ct. 2923 (1978). "
521,4," Whereas group boycotts are subject to a per se rule of illegality, exclusive dealing arrangements are tested by a ""rule of 
reason"" standard.  Twin City Sportservice, Inc. v. Charles O. Finley & Co., 676 F.2d at 1302. The focus of this test is to first find 
a relevant market and then assess whether competition has been foreclosed in a substantial share of the relevant market. 
Antitrust liability is not imposed without proof of actual harm to competition. The purpose of this test is to determine the 
anticompetitive ""effects"" of the exclusive contract, id., rather than the anticompetitive ""intent"" as required by the Utah statute."
521,5," The memorandum decision is reprinted at Note, Criminal Antitrust Action in Utah: State v. Fletcher, 1 B.Y.U. J. Pub. L. 229, 
251-55 (1986). The decision was written in the context of a denial of a motion to dismiss. While the decision simply permitted the 
state to proceed to try its case before a jury, the trial court shared the majority's view that intent is the controlling element of a 
""group boycott"" charge. The theme of the cases cited by both parties is that the mere existence of an exclusive vertical contract is not a ""group 
boycott"" prohibited by the antitrust laws. However, the State has alleged and should be allowed to prove that the 
defendants had specific anticompetitive intent. This can not be inferred from the mere existence of an exclusive vertical 
deal, but by anticompetitive, illegal behavior an otherwise legal business decision can become an unlawful group boycott 
under the Utah Antitrust Act. The State should have the opportunity to establish that the defendants had a specific intent to 
eliminate access to the security guard market as the goal of their exclusive dealing and that no legitimate business purpose 
or result was intended. Id. at 254-55. "
522,6," ""An antitrust policy divorced from market considerations would lack any objective benchmarks."" Continental T.V. Inc. v. GTE 
Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 53 n.21, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568, 97 S. Ct. 2549 (1977). Contrary to the majority's characterization, I have 
not urged full-blown market analysis of the sort typical when applying the rule of reason. Such analysis is indeed unnecessary 
where an antitrust violation of the per se variety is at issue. However, I think a cursory peek at the relevant market is instructive 
in evaluating the likelihood that defendants had as their intent the elimination of competition."
522,7," Fortunately, such objectionable conduct is readily punished under our commercial bribery statute. Where the conduct is 
especially egregious, it can also, as in this case, be reached under the racketeering statute. Defendants did a bad thing and they 
should suffer the consequences. Their punishment, however, should be for the crimes they committed, not those they might 
have committed had the Legislature chosen a different approach to antitrust criminality. "
529,1," The Tampa Bay franchise withdrew as a plaintiff at the time of the filing of the First Amended Complaint.  The Arizona Outlaws 
have withdrawn their appeal."
529,2," The Los Angeles Raiders, Ltd., were not named as defendants in this action."

440,000,000 in the aggregate ($ 1,320,000,000 when trebled)""; in the joint pretrial order, plaintiffs sought ""threefold the amount 
of actual damages in excess of $ 567,000,000 in the aggregate (in excess of $ 1,700,000,000 when trebled)."""

538,*," Mr. Warner surrendered his interest in the Birmingham franchise in April, 1985. "
539,**," Dr. Hoffman surrendered his interest in the Chicago franchise in January, 1984.  Thereafter, it was operated by a corporation, 
CPHFC, Inc., until July 2, 1984, when a new franchise for Chicago was granted to Edjer Corp."
539,***," Mr. Roulier became a principal owner in June, 1984, replacing Mr. Lerner."
539,****," Mr. Oldenburg surrendered his interest in the Los Angeles franchise in June, 1984.  The franchise was operated by a USFL 
corporation for the balance of the 1984 season. In November, 1984, a new franchise for the Los Angeles area was acquired by 
LAEFC, Ltd., a Colorado limited partnership.  From November 1984 until January 30, 1985, Jay Roulier owned the stock of 
Express Football Club, Inc., the general partner of LAEFC, Ltd.  As of January 30, 1985, the stock of Express Football Club, Inc. 
was acquired by USFL Holdings, Inc., the stock of which is wholly owned by the USFL."
539,7," Article X provided that ""no club shall cause or permit a game in which it is engaged, to be telecast or broadcast into any area 
included within the home territory of any other club, without the consent of such other club"" on a day on which the other club was 
either playing or broadcasting one of its games at home.  116 F. Supp. at 329. The government contended that this provision 
restricted competition among clubs in the sale of broadcast rights. "
540,8," ABC now televises Monday night games and certain prime-time games. CBS televises National Football Conference (""NFC"") 
games throughout the season, on Thanksgiving Day, and on Saturdays in December. NBC televises American Football 
Conference (""AFC"") games throughout the season, Thanksgiving Day, and on Saturdays in December.  Interconference games 
are televised by the network with the rights to the conference of the visiting team. CBS televises NFC playoff games, and NBC 
televises AFC playoff games. The first Super Bowl, held in 1967, was broadcast by both CBS and NBC.  Since 1967, CBS and 
NBC have alternated telecasts of the Super Bowl, except that pursuant to its 1982-86 contract with the NFL, ABC televised the 
Super Bowl played in January 1985.  Broadcasting rights to Super Bowl games are not bid for separately but are rotated among 
the networks. "
541,9," USFL Commissioner Harry Usher testified that he was told by Roone Arledge, the president of ABC Sports, that Arledge ""had 
had negative reaction from the NFL for putting the USFL on initially."" ABC sportscaster Howard Cosell testified that he was told 
by Arledge that Commissioner Rozelle was ""all over"" Arledge because ABC was televising the USFL in the spring. (Arledge 
testified unequivocally that he had never made such a statement to Cosell.) Jim Spence, a senior vice-president at ABC, testified 
that he believed that the NFL was ""less than enamoured"" of the network's dealings with the USFL, although he did not recall that 
any NFL official had directly expressed any displeasure to him."
541,10," For example, Jim Spence, former senior vice-president of ABC Sports; Frederick Pierce, former president of ABC; Roone 
Arledge, group president of ABC News and Sports, former president of ABC Sports; Neil Pilson, president CBS Sports, 
executive vice-president of CBS, former president of CBS Sports; Arthur Watson, president of NBC Sports; William Grimes, 
president of ESPN."
541,11," For example, CBS Sports President Neil Pilson testified that he would consider televising the USFL in the fall only if another 
network was involved.  This double exposure would increase the USFL's value and also not leave CBS in a position that would 
induce the NFL to give the other networks better treatment, including a better schedule of games."
541,12," NBC Sports President Watson testified that his network did not conduct a business study concerning the feasibility of 
broadcasting USFL games on Saturday in the fall because of the network's commitments to other sporting events, including 
baseball, college basketball, golf, and thoroughbred racing. "
543,13," Included were such prominent NFL stadiums as Soldier Field in Chicago (capacity 65,793); the New Orleans Superdome 
(72,675); Giants Stadium in New Jersey (76,891); the Houston Astrodome (47,965); the Silverdome in metropolitan Detroit 
(72,675); and RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C. (54,794).  Before trial, Judge Leisure granted summary judgment in favor of the 
NFL on the USFL's stadium-related claims on Noerr-Pennington grounds.  United States Football League v. National Football 
League, 634 F. Supp. 1155, 1179-80 (S.D.N.Y. 1986) (""Opinion No. 4"").  This ruling has not been appealed."
543,14," A number of the USFL's coaches had coached in the NFL: George Allen (Redskins and Rams); Chuck Fairbanks (Patriots); 
Frank Kush (Colts); Walt Michaels (Jets); Red Miller (Broncos); and John Ralston (Bills).  Several had been successful NFL 
players: John Hadl, Craig Morton, Jack Pardee and Steve Spurrier."
543,15," The ABC agreement provided for additional payments for the telecast of more than twenty USFL games per season as well as 
for the shifting of daytime telecasts into prime time. "
544,16," After a January 1984 USFL owners' meeting, Myles Tanenbaum of the Philadelphia franchise complained that the ""'Original' 
franchise owners"" had become outnumbered, and expressed his outrage that ""one of the group believes it would be fair or 
appropriate to simply 'pay off' others in the event there is a potential big hit by way of merger or whatever."" "
546,17," In ruling that any inconsistency in these verdicts did not require a new trial, a ruling not challenged on appeal, the district court 
first recognized that inconsistent verdicts in a civil case are fully permissible in this circuit.  Opinion No. 16, 644 F. Supp. at 1045 
(citing Globus v. Law Research Serv., Inc., 418 F.2d 1276, 1290 n.17 (2d Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 913, 90 S. Ct. 913, 
25 L. Ed. 2d 93 (1970)). The court also plausibly reconciled the actual verdicts in the instant case.  Id. at 1046-48. "
547,18," During the hearings on the merger bill, Commissioner Rozelle testified ""that because of the logistics of handling perhaps 13 or 
14 games on a Sunday afternoon, [the NFL] would require at least 2 networks."" Professional Football League Merger: Hearings 
on S. 3817 Before the Antitrust Subcomm. (Subcomm. 5) of the House Comm. on the Judiciary, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. 64 (1966).  
In response to the question of whether New York City residents would be able to see professional football on television when the 
other New York club was playing a home game, Rozelle said that the league would try to do so, ""which is why I feel we will 
probably have to go to two networks, to assure that each of the 26 or 28 teams has all of its road games brought back to its 
home city."" Id. at 66.  Moreover, the NFL and AFL submitted a memorandum to the subcommittee concerning whether the 
merger would result in reduced broadcasts of football games: Because a single network cannot practicably establish as many as twenty-eight regional networks and because the 
expanded league desires to maintain its present level of club television income, the plan contemplates the continued use of 
two networks by the expanded league, e.g., on a conference or other divisional basis.  Thus, both during the period prior to 
the expiration of the existing television contracts and afterwards, it is contemplated that there will be continued home viewer 
access to duplicate broadcasts, including telecasts of other league games into home cities on days when the home team is 
playing at home. Id. at 119 (emphasis added). "
549,19," The USFL's brief offers an extreme version of the ""dilution effect,"" which we quote: The NFL's television-related conduct constitutes a textbook example of an anticompetitive practice available only to one 
who dominates the market. In a normal, competitive market, the NFL's extraction of monopoly rents by fixing its rights fees 
at an artificially high level would prove pro-competitive by attracting new businesses into the market.  Cf.  Matsushita Elec. 
Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 583, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). But by tying up the only 
three television networks capable of providing the revenue to support a competing league, and increasing the actual rights 
fees charged each of them by 625% in less than ten years (a feat only attainable through the exercise of market power), the "
550,," NFL forces the networks in turn to raise NFL advertising prices above competitive levels.  This in turn creates a disincentive 
to televise a rival, competitively-priced football league in the fall because such a lower-priced league would drive down 
advertising rates and reduce the NFL viewing audience.  This disincentive, termed the ""dilution effect"" and quantified by 
CBS at $ 50 million, applies equally to all the networks and prevents them from considering fairly the merits of a new 
league. USFL Br. at 39 (footnote and citation to record omitted). Even putting aside the unproven factual premises -- the existence of monopoly rents, the identical impact of the ""dilution effect"" 
upon all networks, the quantification of $ 50 million as realistic for 1986 -- this theory appears to posit a uniquely 
sadomasochistic economic relationship in which the more the seller charges, the happier the buyer is.  Needless to say, the 
network executives who testified did not describe their negotiations with Rozelle as fitting that model.  Nor was there evidence 
indicating why the networks had to be ""forced"" by high NFL rights fees to charge advertising prices the market would bear 
anyway."
550,20," The USFL incorrectly claims that the district court's instructions applied a more stringent standard of proof to its television 
claims than to other claims.  In fact, the intent-and-effect charge was given on all the monopolization issues.  The USFL also 
claims it was surprised by the intent-and-effect charge.  It was aware before trial, however, that the NFL would seek such a 
charge.  In any event, no claim of harm other than a passing psychic injury to otherwise robust counsel is made. "
551,21," The USFL contends that the district court improperly added a specific intent requirement to Section 2 by instructing the jury 
that it ""should infer no anticompetitive intent from the mere existence of"" the NFL's three network contracts.  This argument is 
groundless.  The quoted language simply restated the district court's holding in its Opinion No. 2 interpreting the Sports 
Broadcasting Act of 1961.  In any event, the district court instructed the jury that ""monopoly power is obtained intentionally and 
this element is satisfied, if defendants acquired it by means other than superior skill or historical accident"" or ""by any means of 
wielding monopoly power to prevent or impede competition."" This instruction applied to both the professional football market and 
television submarket claims and fully complied with Alcoa's requirement of only general intent for a monopolization violation.  
See 148 F.2d at 432. The usefulness in this area of the distinction between specific and general intent, moreover, may be 
diminished by Aspen's description of the intent requirement as an evidentiary tool to evaluate business conduct. "
558,22," We are aware that the NFL described the redefined market as being limited to the sale of broadcasting rights to football in a 
posttrial memorandum.  See Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Plaintiffs' Request for Permanent Injunctive Relief at 33.  The 
point being made, however, was in no way dependent on how the submarket was defined, and we see no reason to bind the 
NFL to that statement.  As stated in the text, someone looking solely at the verdict sheet would reach that conclusion.  In any 
event, the question is whether an adequate exploration of the issue was made before the district judge. "
561,23," The full limiting instruction was as follows: You have heard arguments presented by counsel and questions asked of witnesses which have brought to your attention the 
allegation that in some respects plaintiffs . . . may have had a motive to attempt to force a merger with the NFL in one of several 
ways. . . .  Any arguments that suggest that such conduct is unethical or somehow improper, are themselves inappropriate in 
this type of case, and in the context of this lawsuit.  Whether plaintiffs . . . may have pursued such conduct is irrelevant to the 
issue of whether the defendants here on trial engaged in any anticompetitive conduct towards the plaintiffs. Defendants . . . are entitled to show you, however, that certain business decisions may have been the cause of the poor financial 
health of the USFL. Thus, while plaintiffs contend that they have been injured by defendants' anticompetitive conduct, 
defendants contend that certain USFL business decisions caused the financial harm to plaintiffs. But, I must remind you that the nature of plaintiffs' conduct must have no bearing on your evaluation of whether the defendants 
did anything in violation of the antitrust laws."
561,24," The USFL's claim that two jurors were improperly influenced by evidence of the merger strategy despite the district court's 
limiting instruction must also be rejected.  See Fed. R. Evid. 606(b) (HN14[
] prohibits use of extrajudicial statements by jurors 
to impeach verdict). "
563,25," For similar reasons, exclusion of excerpts from minutes of the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Board of Directors was 
proper. "
564,26," The district court found that: (1) ""an important aspect of the NFL's purpose in seeking the 1961 exemption was to join the other 
professional sports organizations in being able to enter into pooled rights television contracts,"" Opinion No. 3, 634 F. Supp. at 
1171; (2) one of the terms of the 1966 merger was an increase in the number of teams; (3) at the NFL's request, the merger 
legislation did not grant the combined league any greater antitrust immunity than existed before the merger; (4) evidence on 
state of mind as to lobbying that took place fifteen to twenty years earlier was weak; and (5) the evidence was, in any event, 
merely cumulative.  See generally id. "
567,27," Judge Leisure gave an instruction regarding the USFL's lightened burden of proving the amount of damages that was entirely 
consistent with these rules.  Repeating nearly verbatim the instruction set forth in Judge Sand's Modern Federal Jury Instructions 
para. 79.02, at 79-57 (1986) (Instruction 79-26), Judge Leisure instructed the jury as follows: It might be difficult for you to measure the plaintiff[s'] damages in this case.  However, the fact that it might be difficult to 
determine the amount of the plaintiffs' damages should not prevent you from awarding damages to plaintiffs.  The law 
allows a party injured by conduct which violates the Sherman Act to collect damages even if the evidence does not reflect 
how those damages are to be calculated with mathematical precision. This does not mean, however, that you may determine the plaintiff[s'] damages on the basis of mere speculation or 
guesswork.  Rather, you must look to the evidence presented to you and make a fair and reasonable estimate of the 
plaintiff[s'] damages based on the evidence. Judge Leisure properly instructed the jury as follows on future damages: In this case plaintiffs are seeking not only to recover those damages they allege they have already suffered, but also to 
recover damages they claim they will suffer in the future as a result of the anticompetitive conduct of defendants that has 
already taken place and which may take place in the future. With regard to future damages, you are instructed that such damages are not recoverable if you find that the fact of their 
accrual is speculative or that their amount and nature is unprovable.  On the other hand, if you find that you can make a fair 
and reasonable estimate of plaintiffs' future damages, you may award such damages as you find appropriate, keeping in 
mind that the damage award need not be calculated with mathematical precision. "
568,28," The USFL attempts to distinguish MCI Communications on the ground that, unlike the instant case, MCI Communications 
involved partial market foreclosure and thus ""special proof problems."" Even assuming that the instant case is a total foreclosure 
case, the Supreme Court stated in Zenith Radio that the same standards of proof apply whether there is ""a partial or total 
exclusion from a market."" 395 U.S. at 123. "
577,1," This Court's earlier determination to the contrary in Nurse Midwifery Associates v. B.K. Hibbett, 549 F. Supp. 1185, 1189-90 
(M.D.  Tenn. 1982), was rendered before the Sixth Circuit's pronouncements in Smith and Potters. "
609,1," The Supreme Court has long recognized that price-fixing agreements are unlawful per se under the Sherman Act. See United 
States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 223, 60 S.Ct. 811, 844, 84 L.Ed. 1129, 1168 (1940). In Continental T.V., Inc. v. 
GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 97 S.Ct. 2549, 53 L.Ed.2d 568 (1977), the Court overruled its recently  [*8] adopted rule making 
vertical market allocations unlawful per se and reinstated a Rule of Reason analysis. Id. One commentator has noted, 
""Subsequent to Sylvania, several cases and law review articles have attacked or questioned the per se rule as applied to vertical 
price restraints."" II E.Kintner, Federal Antitrust Law ยง 10.18, at 126 (Supp. 1988)[hereinafter Kintner]. However, finding that 
plaintiffs in this case have not produced sufficient evidence of a conspiracy either between defendant and other dealers or 
between defendant and other manufacturers, the Court need not decide whether a per se or Rule of Reason analysis applies to 
these price claims. "
610,2," The Court would specifically add at this point that plaintiffs' reliance on Fragale & Sons Beverage Co. v. Dill, 760 F.2d 469 (3d 
Cir. 1985), is misplaced. In Belk, the court expressly distinguished Fragale as there was  [*12] no allegation in that case ""that 
competing distributors threatened to stop buying from the defendants if they supplied the new distributor."" Belk, 799 F.2d at 910, 
Hence, the Belk court reasoned on the facts before it that, even if the reason advanced to justify termination of a discounter is 
pretextual, ""[the manufacturer] still had a legitimate, independent reason to terminate their relationship."" Id. at 910-11, Similarly, 
threats by plaintiffs' competing dealers to stop buying from defendant likewise distinguishes the case sub judice from Fragale. "
611,3," Specifically, the so-called Colgate Doctrine permits a manufacturer to announce its resale price in advance and refuse to deal 
with those who fail to comply. See Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 761, 104 S.Ct. at 1469, 79 L.Ed.2d at 783-84. "
612,4," Each of these cases was limited by the Supreme Court's holding in Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 
752, 104 S.Ct. 2731, 81 L.Ed.2d 628 (1984). The Copperweld Court specifically rejected the so-called ""intra-enterprise doctrine"" 
and held that a parent corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary are not legally capable of conspiring with each other under 
section 1 of the Sherman Act. Id. at 777, 104 S.Ct. at 2745, 81 L.Ed.2d at 647. However, Copperweld does not alter the cases 
cited above respecting the proposition that concerted action may be found between a defendant  [*20] and an unwilling antitrust 
plaintiff. "
613,5," In other words, a factfinder may not transform conscious parallelism into conspiracy absent additional circumstantial evidence. 
Such facts are commonly referred to as ""plus factors"" and have been identified as follows: (1) indications of ""traditional 
conspiracy;"" (2) motive; (3) actions contrary to economic self-interests; (4) poor economic performance; and (5) actions 
facilitating oligopolistic collaboration. McElhinney v. Medical Protective Co., 549 F.Supp. 121, 129 (E.D.Ky. 1982) (quoting 
P.Areeda, Antitrust Analysis ยถ 325, at 371-82 (3d ed. 1981)), remanded for dismissal, 738 F.2d 439, 1984-1 Trade Cas. (CCH) 
ยถ 66,054 (6th Cir. June 5, 1984) [*23] ."
613,6," The Court would note that defendant's motion challenges only plaintiffs' Sherman Act claims. The seventh claim alleged 
Clayton Act violations and therefore is not presently before the Court. "
614,7," The Anderson Court also emphasized, ""The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiff's position will be 
insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff."" Id. at 252, 106 S.Ct. at 2512, 91 
L.Ed.2d at 214 (emphasis added)."
614,8," The Court would note that the voluminous record in these cases prevented intimate familiarity with the facts underlying 
plaintiffs' claims. Consequently, the Court relied heavily on the exhaustive briefs filed by counsel to guide its consideration of 
plaintiffs' evidence. "
615,9," Plaintiffs attempted to create a genuine issue of fact by producing claims of other dealers that defendant attempted to restrict 
their freedom to set their own price. See (Plaintiffs' Brief at 55-58). However, the Ninth Circuit rejected similar evidence as

Champion plugs for replacement purposes because Champion's exclusive-dealing practices made other brands unavailable. 
Such a theory is inconsistent with the essence of the predatory-pricing claim: if Champion so dominated the replacement market, 
it would not need to sell below cost in the original equipment market."

639,*," The Honorable Robert A. Grant, Senior District Judge for the Northern District of Indiana, is sitting by designation. "
640,1," The parties stipulated to the following definition of ""promoter"": ""Promoter is defined as a person who presents live musical entertainment events (hereinafter referred to as concerts). 
Concerts are performed by artists. In order to promote a concert, a promoter conducts, inter alia, the following activities: "
641,," (a) purchases the services of an artist; (b) contracts with an artist or his agent to obtain that artist's services for a particular location, date and time; (c) contracts with the owner of a facility in which the concert is to take place; (d) sells tickets to the public, either directly or through ticket outlets; (e) advertises the concert; (f) forms various other activities, all of which are designed to successfully present the entertainment event to the public."""
641,2," Flip Side further alleged that JAM had an exclusive contract with the Aragon, an ""essential"" mid-level facility and exclusives 
with the Riviera and Park West, lower-level ""essential"" facilities. On April 22, 1986, Judge Moran granted defendants' motion for 
summary judgment with respect to Flip Side's middle-level and lower-level antitrust claim, finding: ""This claim borders on the frivolous. Defendants, in an almost humorous fashion, list the facilities in each size category 
which Flip Side has admitted exist. The list of middle-level facilities extend to 16. The list of lower-level facilities counts 35. 
No one person or company owns them all, so the issue of monopoly control, which is the key to essential facility doctrine, 
does not even appear."" Flip Side has not pursued its middle- and lower-level antitrust claim on appeal."
641,3," JAM's counterclaim and third-party complaint recounted almost verbatim Flip Side's antitrust allegations and simply substituted 
itself as plaintiff and Flip Side as defendant. JAM asserted that the International Amphitheatre, rather than the Pavilion and 
Horizon, was the purported essential facility. Therefore, Judge Moran described JAM's counterclaim as a ""mirror image"" of Flip 
Side's complaint."
641,4," Ralph Mickelson and Alan Granat are the respective fathers of JAM's two principals, Jerry Mickelson and Arny Granat. "
642,5," Flip Side later brought a motion for summary judgment on the basis that the statute of limitations had run on the alleged RICO 
claim. The district court granted the motion concluding that JAM's RICO claim was untimely. Memorandum and Order, April 22, 
1986. "
643,6," The district court further found that even if the Horizon was considered an essential facility for the promotion of concerts in the 
Chicago area, Flip Side failed to prove that it had been excluded from the Horizon. The court observed that Flip Side ""while 
managing to produce documents which stack over two feet high, . . . has not produced a single copy of an alleged 'written' 
[exclusive] agreement"" between Tempo and JAM. Id. at 14. The court pointed out that ""the closest Flip Side goes to proving 
such an exclusive agreement is Zuckerman's [a promoter] testimony that a rumor existed that JAM had an exclusive at the 
Horizon. This does not satisfy Flip Side's burden of proof to produce evidence that would put its contentions in dispute."" Id. at 15. 
Lastly, the district court found that Flip Side failed to produce any evidence ""that the alleged [exclusive] agreement was intended 
to exclude competitors or that it had such an effect."" Id. at 16. "
644,7," Flip Side apparently referred to the following deposition testimony of Jerry Mickleson, a JAM owner: ""Q: [Steven Kramer --appellant's counsel] Have you ever stated that you would never do a show at the Amphitheatre? A: I may have stated that somewhere along the line."
644,*," * * Q: Okay. Have you ever referred to the Amphitheatre as a toilet? A: I may have."""
644,8," Oral argument was initially heard on December 10, 1986, while JAM's counterclaim and third-party complaint were still pending 
in the district court. Consequently, we dismissed appeal no. 86-1837 for lack of jurisdiction because the April 22, 1986, 
Memorandum and Order was not a final appealable order. Subsequently, on March 2, 1987, the district court granted Flip Side's 
motion for summary judgment on the counterclaim, finding that the International Amphitheatre was not an essential facility for the 
promotion of rock concerts in the Chicago metropolitan area. The court noted ironically that JAM had ""jumped its own fence"" to 
argue that the Amphitheatre was an essential facility despite having argued strenuously that the Stadium was and still is 
available for staging rock and other concerts. JAM has not appealed from the district court's granting of Flip Side's motion for 
summary judgment but appeals from the court's denial of JAM's petition for fees and costs. Flip Side appeals from the summary 
judgment order in favor of the defendants and also from the court's imposition of sanctions pursuant to Rule 11 in favor of 
Tempo. By an order of this court on April 13, 1987, we consolidated these appeals and have decided the merits of the antitrust 
allegations on the basis of the briefs filed and argument heard in appeal no. 86-1837. "
646,9," Flip Side alleged that Tempo had an exclusive contract with the Village of Rosemont for the presentation of concerts at the 
Horizon and further alleged that JAM had an exclusive sublicense for the promotion of concerts at the essential facility. This is a 
form of vertical organization in that Flip Side and JAM compete for the use of arena-level facilities, i.e., compete with each other 
for the presentation of concerts to consumers in the Chicago metropolitan market. JAM and Flip Side also compete for different 
performing artists. On the other hand, Tempo does not compete directly with Flip Side because it neither recruits artists nor 
actually promotes concerts itself; rather, it sublicenses its exclusive agreement to present concerts at the Horizon to various 
promoters, including JAM."
646,10," Lawrence Rosenbaum testified, inter alia: ""A.  Also, another difference between the two facilities is the acceptance by the groups and agents of the Horizon and what 
appears to be developing as a dislike by those same people for the Pavilion."
646,*," * * Q.  On what facts do you base the statement that some concerts -- some artists prefer the Horizon over the Pavilion? A.  Information from agents."" "
647,11," The court further noted that even if Flip Side did have standing, it had failed to produce any evidence of fraud. "
648,12," Tempo moved for sanctions under both 28 U.S.C. ยง 1927 and Rule 11. ยง 1927 provides only for the imposition of sanctions 
against counsel while Rule 11 provides for sanctions against both parties and their attorneys. See Ordower v. Feldman, 826 
F.2d 1569, 1573 (7th Cir. 1987). The district court assessed fees against Flip Side only; thus, we proceed with our analysis 
treating the district court's imposition of sanctions under Fed. R. Civ. P. 11."
648,13," Rule 11 provides: ""Every pleading, motion, and other paper of a party represented by an attorney shall be signed by at least one attorney of 
record in his individual name, whose address shall be stated. A party who is not represented by an attorney shall sign his 
pleading, motion, or other paper and state his address. Except when otherwise specifically provided by rule or statute, 
pleadings need not be verified or accompanied by affidavit. The rule in equity that the averments of an answer under oath 
must be overcome by the testimony of two witnesses or of one witness sustained by corroborating circumstances is 
abolished. The signature of an attorney or party constitutes a certificate by him that he has read the pleading, motion, or 
other paper; that to the best of his knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry it is well grounded in 
fact and is warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law, 
and that it is not interposed for any improper purpose such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless 
increase in the cost of litigation. If a pleading, motion, or other paper is not signed, it shall be stricken unless it is signed 
properly after the omission is called to the attention of the pleader or movant. If a pleading, motion, or other paper is signed 
in violation of this rule, the Court, upon motion or upon its own initiative, shall impose upon the person who signed it, a 
represented party, or both, an appropriate sanction, which may include an order to pay to the other party or parties the 
amount of the reasonable expenses incurred because of the filing of the pleading, motion, or other paper, including a 
reasonable attorney's fee."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 11 (1986). "
650,14," The district court found that Tempo only requested fees and not costs. Tempo does not challenge the district court's finding; 
thus, we affirm the award of $ 42,496.25 (rather than the $ 44,253.05 total including costs noted in Tempo's brief)."
650,15," Rule 38 provides: ""If a court of appeals shall determine that an appeal is frivolous, it may award just damages and single or 
double costs to the appellee."" "

movant which must actually come forward with evidence to demonstrate the existence of material issues of fact. If this goes 
against the ""familiar teachings"" of United States v. Realty Multi-List, Inc., 629 F.2d 1351, 1360 (5th Cir. 1980), then the court 
takes comfort in the fact that this view is consistent with more recent Fifth Circuit and Supreme Court decisions.  Celotex, 477

677,19," The exclusion of non-members from MLS participation need only satisfy the rule of reason. The requirement of membership to

further none of the Act's goals - when it operates to deny to consumers the opportunity to choose among alternative offers 
without offering the possibility of any joint, efficiency-producing economic activities. Realty Multi-List, 629 F.2d at 1364 (citing Broadcast Music, Inc.  v. Columbia Broadcasting Co., 441 U.S. 1, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1, 99

In order to avoid a motion for summary judgment, a claimant must come forward with significant probative evidence 
supporting its theory of conscious parallelism with, as it has been stated, some ""plus"" factor which tends to indicate that the 
asserted unilateral behavior was not such in fact, e.g., that the decisions not to deal were contrary to defendants' economic

However, the plaintiffs have not presented specific evidence sufficient to establish that the government defendants prohibited 
such activity by the plaintiffs.  The defendants did inform the plaintiffs of the state statutes involved but did not take steps toward 
enforcement. The court therefore does not need to decide whether or not such a prohibition would violate substantive due 
process requirements in addition to First Amendment requirements. See discussion at III.C. above. However, the court notes 
that prohibiting gifts between a merchant and his own customer is different from prohibiting ""gifts"" from a seller's agent to a

reputations and have not shown any denial of due process. The government defendants would not have violated any possible 
liberty interest by holding a public hearing on a complaint. The government defendants apparently did not ""publish"" the disputed 
information or initiate its publication."
692,61, See deposition of James Pope at 292.
692,62, The government defendants also have immunity defenses. See II.D.2.  footnote.
692,63," The situation in Snowden involved the unlawful administration of a state statute by state officials that resulted in the unequal 
application of a facially fair statute. Similarly situated persons may be treated differently in the application of the law without 
violating the equal protection clause. "
693,64, The court notes that the plaintiffs have produced little evidence to support these challenged claims. 
701,*," Honorable James M. Ideman, United States District Judge, Central District of California, sitting by designation. "
702,1," Distributor defendants Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc. and Buena Vista Distributing Co. and exhibitor defendants General Cinema 
Corp., General Cinema of Arizona, Plitt Inter-Mountain Theaters, Inc., and Mann Theaters Corp. of California are no longer 
parties. "
705,2," Although Harkins states that it was awarded 3% of the films, the actual allocation was 3.9%. The 22% figure for theatre 
operations assumes, for summary judgment purposes, that all five of Harkins' theatres were within the relevant market. The 
distributors dispute this fact. "
706,3," In addition to the 85% correlation between split designees and the actual film licensees, Harkins has presented uncontroverted 
evidence that exhibitors would sometimes ""trade"" rights to assigned films. The distributors actually licensed films to split 
members 97% of the time. This figure includes six occasions in which both Harkins and an exhibitor defendant were licensed the 
same film. "
712,4," The distributors brought their partial summary judgment motion jointly, and have not attempted to argue that some are entitled 
to judgment on certain claims while others are not. At this stage of the proceeding, therefore, we have not attempted to make 
such a delineation. Since Harkins has raised a triable issue of a conspiracy among the exhibitors, our decision applies to all of 
the exhibitors. "
719,1," The per se rule was affirmed by a bare majority, and in the face of serious criticism by antitrust scholars. R. Bork, The Antitrust 
Paradox, 372-75 (1978); Hirsh v. Martindale-Hubbell, Inc., 674 F.2d 1343, 1349 n. 19 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 973, 74 L. 
Ed. 2d 285, 103 S. Ct. 305 (1982); Mozart Co. v. Mercedes-Benz of North America, 833 F.2d 1342, 1345 n. 2, n. 3 (9th Cir. 
1987)."
719,2," Although the Court has stated, in dicta, that tying arrangements serve ""hardly any purpose beyond the suppression of 
competition,"" Standard Oil Co. of California v. United States, 337 U.S. 293, 305-306, 69 S. Ct. 1051, 1058, 93 L. Ed. 1371 
(1949), ""this declaration was not taken literally even by the cases that purport to rely upon it."" Hyde, 466 U.S. at 34, 104 S. Ct. at 
1563 (O'Conner concurring). ""The Court has never been willing to say of tying arrangements, as it has of price fixing, division of 
markets, and other arrangements subject to per se analysis, that they are always illegal, without proof of market power or 
anticompetitive effect."" Id. "
720,," HN3[
]"
720,3," There are three policy rationales for the per se rule against tying arrangements. The ""primary purpose"" is to prevent an 
extension of market power to a new product market. The so-called ""leverage theory"" has been criticized because ""modern 
economic thought seems to indicate that all available monopoly profits could be obtained from the tying product alone without 
the use of a tie-in."" Mozart, 833 F.2d at 1345 n. 3 (citing, Bork, supra, at 373); Hyde, 466 U.S. at 36, 104 S. Ct. at 1570-1571 
(O'Conner, concurring). Tying arrangements have also been viewed as a method for facilitating price discrimination. Id. Such 
price discrimination occurs where the seller ""meters"" the buyers use of the tying product.  Hyde, 466 U.S. at 36 n. 4, 104 S. Ct. 
at 1571 n. 4 (O'Conner, concurring). In this case plaintiff has made no such allegations. Furthermore, the proper party to bring 
suit under this theory, would be the franchisees not the distributors. Finally, in a regulated industry, a firm with market power may 
be unable to extract a supercompetitive profit because it lacks control over the prices it charges for regulated products or 
services. Tying may be used to extract that profit from the sale of unregulated tied products.  Fortner Enterprises, Inc. v. United 
States Steel Corp., 394 U.S. 495, 513, 89 S. Ct. 1252, 1263-1264, 22 L. Ed. 2d 495 (1969) (White, dissenting). HN4[
] "
721,4," Klien & Saft come to the same conclusion; ""Postcontract HN6[
] . . . a franchisor can use the threat of termination to ""hold up"" 
a franchisee that has made a specific investment in the marketing arrangement. However, this potential economic power has 
nothing to do with market power, ultimate consumers' welfare, or antitrust."" Klien & Saft, supra, at 356 (emphasis added). The 
""hold up"" of franchisees is a ""contract problem,"" but not an antitrust problem. As the axiom provides, the antitrust laws were 
designed to protect competition, not competitors; injury to the plaintiff alone (or to the franchisees) is not sufficient to prove injury 
to competition.  Brunswick Corp v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 488, 97 S. Ct. 690, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977). "
722,5," The Digidyne court's failure to engage in market analysis has been rejected by the commentators and the courts.  Mozart, 833 
F.2d at 1346 n. 4. (citing cases and articles). The Mozart panel points out that two of the five Justices who favor retention of the 
per se rule against tying arrangements would have granted cert in Digidyne because of the panel's failure to engage in market 
analysis. Id. "

738,1," The garment industry proviso creates an even broader exception than the construction industry proviso, allowing unions in the 
garment industry to use restrictive subcontracting clauses as organizational and economic weapons. See Danielson v. Joint 
Board of Coat, Suit and Allied Garment Workers' Union, 494 F.2d 1230, 1236 (2d Cir. 1974) (Friendly, J.). See also Connell 
Construction Co. v. Plumbers & Steamfitters Local Union No. 100, 421 U.S. 616, 633 n.13, 44 L. Ed. 2d 418, 95 S. Ct. 1830 
(1975). "
744,2," In Mackey, the Eighth Circuit articulated a three-part test to determine whether a particular agreement enjoys the protection of 
the nonstatutory exemption. First, the restraint on trade must primarily affect only the parties to the agreement. Second, the 
agreement must concern a mandatory subject of collective bargaining. Third, the agreement must be the product of bona fide, 
arm's-length bargaining. See Mackey, 543 F.2d at 614. The Ninth Circuit recently employed this three-part analysis. See 
Continental Maritime of San Francisco, Inc. v. Pacific Coast Metal Trades District Council, 817 F.2d 1391, 1393 (9th Cir. 1987). 
Although we believe that the agreement in the instant case could satisfy such a test, we need not adopt this particular analysis. 
Rather, we rely on the discussion of Jewel Tea and Connell Construction by Judge Sofaer in Home Box Office, 531 F. Supp. at 
591-93, which we subsequently endorsed. See 708 F.2d at 95. "
749,1," Dr. Collins is not unique in turning to antitrust laws for relief. Yet despite the growing frequency with which doctors file antitrust 
claims, they have had little success. See Enders, Federal Antitrust Issues Involved in the Denial of Medical Staff Privileges, 17 
Loy. U. Chi. L.J. 331 (1986). "
750,2," Collins filed suit against APL, the corporation, as well as the four pathologists employed by the corporation, each of whom was 
sued individually. The estate of a fifth individual pathologist was named as a defendant in Collins' second amended complaint. 
However, as Jessie Fulcher, executrix of the estate of the fifth pathologist, Dr. J. Herschel Fulcher, Jr., is not listed by the 
plaintiff's or the other defendants' brief as an appellee and has not filed a brief in this Court, the estate appears to have been 
dropped as a defendant."
750,3," Count VII, breach of contract, and Count VIII, misrepresentation, have evidently been abandoned. Plaintiff's briefs and oral 
argument do not fault the district court's disposition of those counts. See 676 F. Supp. at 1408-1410. "
752,4," Although Tampa Electric was brought under Section 3 of the Clayton Act, courts routinely rely on its analysis for cases arising 
under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. Since the proscription of Section 3 of the Clayton Act is broader than that of 
Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, if a contract does not fall within the relevant market coverage of the Clayton Act it is not 
forbidden by the Sherman Act. In addition, while Section 3 of the Clayton Act does not apply to services, Chelson v. Oregonian 
Pub. Co., 715 F.2d 1368, 1372 (9th Cir. 1983), reference is still appropriate for the analogous ""relevant market"" jurisprudence 
thereunder. "
754,5," The district court noted, and we agree, that Dr. Collins is slicing the geographic market much too thin in limiting the relevant 
market for pathology services to St. John's hospital.  676 F. Supp. at 1405. As we stated in Dos Santos v. Columbus-Cuneo-
Cabrini Medical Center, 684 F.2d 1346, 1353 (7th Cir. 1982), ""we have reason to doubt whether the relevant market can be 
sliced so small as to embrace only a single hospital."" "
755,6," Section 60-11 of the Illinois Antitrust Act requires that ""when the wording of this Act is identical or similar to that of a federal 
antitrust law, the courts of this State shall use the construction of the federal law by the federal courts as a guide in construing 
this Act."" 38 Ill. Rev. Stat. ยง 60-11. "
773,1," Appellants added Wallace Murray Corp. (along with its divisions U.S. Brass Corp. and Qest Plumbing Products), Vanguard 
Plastics, Inc. and Wrightway Mfg. Co., which all manufacture, produce, and sell insert fittings used with PB pipe systems. 
Appellants also added Plastic Pipe Fittings Association, which promotes, markets, and sells plastic pipe. "
778,2," Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act provides, in pertinent part: HN10[
] ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or 
otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be 
illegal."" 15 U.S.C. ยง 1. Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act provides, in pertinent part: ""Every person who shall monopolize, or 
attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or 
commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony."" 15 U.S.C. ยง 2."
778,3," HN12[
] The Sherman Act's prohibition against concerted activity in restraint of trade is analyzed under either the ""per se"" rule 
or the ""rule of reason."" The per se analysis is applied to practices that are presumptively illegal, such as (1) horizontal and 
vertical price-fixing; (2) horizontal market division; (3) group boycotts and concerted refusals to deal; and (4) tie-in sales. See 
Cascade Cabinet Co., 710 F.2d at 1370. The rule of reason requires ""'the factfinder to decide whether under all the 
circumstances of the case the restrictive practice imposes an unreasonable restraint on competition.'"" Id. (quoting Arizona v. 
Maricopa County Medical Soc'y, 457 U.S. 332, 343, 73 L. Ed. 2d 48, 102 S. Ct. 2466 (1982)). In this case, no per se antitrust 
violation is alleged; rule of reason analysis is appropriate. "
779,4," The district court also dismissed appellants' state law claim under the California Cartwright Act, Cal. Bus. & Prof Code ยงยง 
16700-16760. If a federal claim is dismissed before trial, any pendent state matters usually should be dismissed as well. See 
United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 726, 16 L. Ed. 2d 218, 86 S. Ct. 1130 (1966); Filco v. Amana Refrigeration, Inc., 
709 F.2d 1257, 1268 (9th Cir.), cert. dismissed, 464 U.S. 956, 104 S. Ct. 385, 78 L. Ed. 2d 331 (1983). In this case, however, 
appellants base their state law claim on the same facts on which they base their Sherman Act claims. We have recognized that 
Cartwright Act claims raise basically the same issues as do Sherman Act claims.  Filco, 709 F.2d at 1268 (citing Milton v. 
Hudson Sales Corp., 152 Cal.App.2d 418, 439-41, 313 P.2d 936, 950 (1957)). California state courts follow federal cases in 
deciding claims under the Cartwright Act. See Marin County Bd. of Realtors, Inc. v. Palsson, 16 Cal.3d 920, 925, 130 Cal. Rptr. 
1, 3, 549 P.2d 833, 835 (1976); Corwin v. Los Angeles Newspaper Serv. Bureau, Inc., 4 Cal.3d 842, 852, 94 Cal. Rptr. 785, 791, 
484 P.2d 953, 959 (1971); see also Filco, 709 F.2d at 1268. As a result, our conclusion with regard to the Sherman Act claims 
applies with equal force to appellants' Cartwright Act claims. Accordingly, we also affirm the district court's grant of judgment on 
the pleadings on the state antitrust claims."
779,5," In the AFA complaint the appellants stated that Dan-de ""was and is now engaged in the domestic and overseas business of 
selling, marketing and promoting polybutylene pipe [and] producing and selling flare-type pipe fittings."" "
780,6," Appellants acknowledge that they failed to include an allegation that the relevant market was the pipe fittings market. Such an 
allegation was included in the proposed second amended complaint, which was disallowed by the district court. Because we 
hold that the district court properly exercised its discretion in not allowing appellants to amend their complaint, we are limited to 
considering what appears on the AFA complaint in reviewing the judgment on the pleadings for failure to state a claim."
780,7," The district court also dismissed appellants' California Cartwright Act claims for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). We 
review such dismissals de novo.  Fort Vancouver Plywood Co. v. United States, 747 F.2d 547, 552 (9th Cir. 1984). Appellants 
have failed to allege conduct that involves intrastate commerce, see, e.g., R.E. Spriggs Co. v. Adolph Coors Co., 37 Cal.App.3d 
653, 657, 666, 112 Cal. Rptr. 585, 587, 594 (1974); instead the state antitrust claims relate only to foreign commerce and fail to 
allege the requisite antitrust injury. We thus affirm the district court's order dismissing the California Cartwright Act claim for 
failure to state a claim. "
781,8," Prior to enactment of section 6a, the extraterritorial reach of the antitrust laws was governed in this circuit by a tripartite test: (1) 
the effect or intended effect on the foreign commerce of the United States; (2) the type and magnitude of the alleged illegal 
behavior; and (3) the appropriateness of exercising extraterritorial jurisdiction in light of considerations of international comity 
and fairness.  Timberlane Lumber Co. v. Bank of America, 549 F.2d 597, 613, 615 (9th Cir. 1976) (Timberlane I). Upon remand 
of Timberlane I, the district court applied the tripartite test. See Timberlane Lumber Co. v. Bank of America, 574 F. Supp. 1453, 
1463-67 (N.D. Cal. 1983), aff'd, 749 F.2d 1378 (9th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 472 U.S. 1032, 87 L. Ed. 2d 643, 105 S. Ct. 3514 
(1985) (Timberlane II). On subsequent appeal, this Court reviewed the district court's analysis under the Timberlane I standard 
without mentioning section 6a. See Timberlane II, 749 F.2d at 1383-86. Other circuits had expressly rejected the Timberlane I 
test. See, e.g., National Bank of Canada v. International Card Ass'n, 666 F.2d 6, 8-9 (2d Cir. 1981) (holding that there must be 
an appreciable anticompetitive effect on this country's commerce of a type sufficient to justify assertion of jurisdiction); see also 
Liamuiga Tours v. Travel Impressions, Ltd., 617 F. Supp. 920, 923 (E.D.N.Y. 1985). In an effort to provide a single standard for the issue of extraterritorial application of the Sherman Act, Congress enacted section 
6a. See O.N.E. Shipping v. Flota Mercante Grancolombiana, 830 F.2d 449, 451 (2d Cir. 1987), petition for cert. filed, Feb. 8, 
1988; The 'In' Porters, S.A. v. Hanes Printables, Inc., 663 F. Supp. 494, 497-98 (M.D.N.C. 1987). Despite the peculiar 
procedural history of Timberlane -- section 6a was enacted between the remand and subsequent appeal -- we are bound to 
apply section 6a. We note that in passing the Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Act, Congress did not change the ability of the courts to 
exercise principles of international comity. See H.R. Rep. 686, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 13 (1982); see also Laker Airways v. 
Sabena, Belgian World Airways, 235 U.S. App. D.C. 207, 731 F.2d 909, 946 n.137 (D.C. Cir. 1984); McElderry v. Cathay Pacific 
Airways, 678 F. Supp. 1071, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 660, 1988-1 Trade Cas. (CCH) P 67,878, at 57,389 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 3, 1988); 
O.N.E. Shipping, 830 F.2d at 451-54. "
784,9," More recently, the Supreme Court has held that HN23[
] ""an individual's contract with an out-of-state party alone [cannot] 
automatically establish sufficient minimum contacts"" to support personal jurisdiction. Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 
462, 478, 85 L. Ed. 2d 528, 105 S. Ct. 2174 (1985) (emphasis in original). "
785,10," Ordinarily, if part one of the ""minimum contacts"" test is satisfied, we proceed to part two, which requires that appellants' claim 
""arise out of or result from the defendant's forum-related activities,"" Raffaele, 707 F.2d at 397, and part three, which requires 
that the exercise of jurisdiction be ""reasonable."" Id.; Data Disc, 557 F.2d at 1287. Personal jurisdiction is established, under the 
""minimum contacts"" test, only if all three parts of this test are satisfied. "
796,1," The per se rule, however, has been subject to some semantic confusion.  The term ""boycott"" is sometimes used 
interchangeably with ""concerted refusal to deal,"" which plainly cannot always be held in violation of the Sherman Act. (Rothery 
Storage & Van Co. v. Atlas Van Lines, Inc.  (D.C.Cir. 1986) 792 F.2d 210, 215 [253 App.D.C. 142], cert. den.  (1987) 479 U.S. 
1033 [93 L.Ed.2d 834, 107 S.Ct. 880].) In Northwest Stationers v. Pacific Stationery (1985) 472 U.S. 284 [86 L.Ed.2d 202, 105 
S.Ct. 2613], the court undertook to clarify the area of per se illegality: ""Cases to which this Court has applied the per se 
approach have generally involved joint efforts by a firm or firms to disadvantage competitors by 'either directly denying or 
persuading or coercing suppliers or customers to deny relationships the competitors need in the competitive struggle.'"" ( Id. at p. 
294 [86 L.Ed.2d at p. 211].) "
798,2," The oft-repeated rule that film distributors have freedom to choose where their films will play stands as a formidable obstacle to 
any attempt to characterize an exclusive dealing agreement as a boycott conspiracy. It has always been the prerogative of a 
supplier to decide with whom it will deal.  ( G.H.I.I. v. MTS, Inc. supra, 147 Cal.App.3d 256, 267-268.) Thus, ""'[A] distributor has 
the right to license or refuse to license his film to any exhibitor, pursuant to his own reasoning, so long as he acts independently . 
. . .'"" ( Lamb's Patio Theatre v. Universal Film Exchanges, supra, 582 F.2d 1068, 1070; Admiral Theatre Corp. v. Douglas 
Theatre Co. (8th Cir. 1978) 585 F.2d 877, 888; Paramount Film Distributing Corp. v. Applebaum, supra, 217 F.2d 101, 124.) ""A 
distributor acting independently has no legal duty to offer equally suitable theaters an equal opportunity to negotiate for or obtain 
films. [Citation.] Nor must it assess bids consistently or in good faith."" ( Universal Amusements Co. v. Gen. Cinema Corp., supra, 
635 F.Supp.  1505, 1514-1515.) It may favor a particular exhibitor ""for any reason or no reason at all."" ( Id. at p. 1515.)"
798,3," This conceptual issue is mirrored in the majority and dissenting opinions in Oreck Corp. v. Whirlpool Corp., supra, 579 F.2d 
126. When Whirlpool Corp. terminated its vacuum cleaner distributorship, Oreck Corp.  brought suit alleging that Whirlpool had 
acted at the behest of another distributor, Sears Roebuck & Co.  The dissent insisted that the case should be analyzed as a 
boycott involving a per se violation of the Sherman Act. ( Id. at p. 138.) The majority maintained that ""[the] present case, "
799,," involving as it does an alleged agreement between a single manufacturer and a single dealer, is, in essence, an exclusive 
distributorship controversy, and the 'group boycott' doctrine, is, therefore, not applicable."" ( Id.  at p. 131) "
800,4," In United States v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. (S.D.N.Y.  1980) 507 F.Supp. 412, 431, the court accepted a similar 
argument with respect to the exhibition of films in the pay television industry: ""While it is undoubtedly true, as the defendants 
argue, that the rare, outstanding film can be shown many times (even after it has appeared on commercial television) and will 
still draw a substantial market, the evidence is overwhelming that 'golden oldies' are not the essential element of pay television; 
it is the new, never-before-shown-on-television, motion picture that the subscriber pays his money for.  The other new pictures of 
nondefendant movie producers, which would be available equally to Premiere and the rest of the market, are not sufficient to 
allow equality among competitors."" Since ""golden oldies"" seldom play in commercial theatres, the importance of popular, first-run 
films may be greater in the theatre exhibition business."
800,5," In evaluating vertical restraints, Schwinn applied the rule of reason only to consignment sales, holding that restraints on 
territories and customers were illegal per se where title passed to the retailer.  The decision was reversed in Continental T.V., 
Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., supra, 433 U.S. 36 with respect to its rule of per se illegality, but it remains valid authority for 
application of the rule of reason.  The availability of commercially equivalent products continues to be a relevant factor in 
analyzing vertical restraints in post-Sylvania cases.  (See Donald B. Rice Tire v. Michelin Tire Corp. (1980) 483 F.Supp. 750, 
760.)"
800,6," Cf.  Lorain Journal v. United States (1951) 342 U.S. 143, 152 [96 L.Ed. 162, 72 S.Ct. 181] (the fact that buyers cannot compete 
without seller's product regarded as relevant circumstance in finding violation of section 2 of the Sherman Act). "
801,7," See R.C. Dick Geothermal Corp. v. Thermogenics, Inc. (N.D.Cal.  1985) 619 F.Supp. 441, 455, appeal pending, Ninth Circuit.  
(The court recognized the relevance of product differentiation to ease of entry in a market.  By extension, product differentiation 
may facilitate the creation of barriers to entry.)"
801,8," See Sullivan, The Law of Antitrust, op. cit. supra, section 149, page 429 [exclusive franchises] and 3 Areeda and Turner, 
Antitrust Law: An Analysis of Antitrust Principles and their Application (1980), section 732, page 253 [requirements contracts].  
Most cases involving such exclusive dealing agreements are decided under the Clayton Act section 3, ( Standard Co. v. 
Magrane-Houston Co. (1921) 258 U.S. 346 [66 L.Ed.  653, 42 S.Ct. 360]; Standard Oil Co. v. United States (1949) 337 U.S.  293 
[93 L.Ed. 1371, 69 S.Ct. 1051]; Tampa Electric Co. v. Nashville Coal Co. (1961) 365 U.S. 320 [5 L.Ed.2d 580, 81 S.Ct. 623]) but 
the Sherman Act contains parallel restrictions.  (2 Areeda & Turner, Antitrust Law: An Analysis of Antitrust Principles and their 
Application, op cit.  supra, ยง 304, p. 6; Interface Group, Inc. v. Mass. Port Authority (1st Cir. 1987) 816 F.2d 9, 11; Graphic 
Products Distributors v. Itek Corp., supra, 717 F.2d 1560.)"
801,9," The example is, of course, purely heuristic.  We do not mean to suggest that there is any precise mathematical analogy. "
802,10," This central purpose of assuring freedom of opportunity in the face of accumulations of corporate wealth, now obscured by 
changing social concerns, was readily apparent to contemporaries.  In one of the earliest and most authoritative interpretations 
of the Sherman Act, Standard Oil Co. v. United States (1911) 221 U.S. 1, 50 [55 L.Ed. 619, 641, 31 S.Ct.  502], the Supreme 
Court explained, ""[the] debates . . . conclusively show . . . that the main cause which led to the legislation was the thought that it 
was required by the economic condition of the times; that is, the vast accumulation of wealth in the hands of corporations and 
individuals, the enormous development of corporate organization, the facility for combination which such organizations afforded, 
the fact that the facility was being used, and that combinations known as trusts were being multiplied, and the widespread 
impression that their power had been and would be exerted to oppress individuals and injure the public generally."" Again, in 
Ramsay Co. v. Bill Posters Assn. (1923) 260 U.S. 501, 512 [67 L.Ed. 368, 370, 43 S.Ct. 167], the court stated that ""[the] 
fundamental purpose of the Sherman Act was to secure equality of opportunity and to protect the public against evils commonly

802,11," The debate over the purposes of the antitrust laws has generally acknowledged a balance of economic, social, and political 
goals.  Particularly distinguished contributions include: The Goals of Antitrust: A Dialogue on Policy (1965) 65 Colum.L.Rev. 363; 
Flynn, Antitrust Jurisprudence: A Symposium on the Economic, Political and Social Goals of Antitrust Policy (1977) 125

decades a distinct school of thought has vigorously espoused economic efficiency as the only goal of antitrust. See Bork, The 
Antitrust Paradox: a Policy at War With Itself (1975); Posner, Antitrust Law: An Economic Perspective (1976). "
804,12," Since the 1950 amendments to the Clayton Act, antitrust litigation in this field has generally relied on the relatively expansive 
provisions of the Clayton Act, section 7, but the same analysis applies to the Sherman Act, section 1.  (Intern. Tel. & Tel. Corp. 
v. General Tel. & Elect.  Corp. (D.Haw. 1978) 449 F.Supp. 1158, 1173.)"
804,13," Although the court did not reach the issue of Sherman Act violation, the decision is relevant to the Cartwright Act. Business 
and Professions Code section 16727 is patterned after section 3 of the Clayton Act.  ( Corwin v. Los Angeles Newspaper 
Service Bureau, Inc. (1971) 4 Cal.3d 842, 853 [94 Cal.Rptr. 785, 484 P.2d 953].) "
805,14," Appellant's claim of damages is based on failure to obtain five films from Orion.  Of these, ""The Terminator"" ranked 25th in 
rentals in 1984 and ""The Woman in Red"" and ""Breathless"" each ranked 35th in rentals in 1984 and 1983 respectively. "
812,1," The district court also determined that under no circumstances could the jury infer from the facts presented any basis that 
would allow recovery by the plaintiff. Additionally, the court noted that under ยง 1983 the acts of law enforcement officials leading 
to prosecution in state court can only be the basis of recovery when it clearly appears that those actions were taken with the 
intent to deprive the plaintiff of the valid exercise of a constitutional right or a clearly defined right under federal law. It reasoned 
that it is only when police officers or others with prosecutorial authority act maliciously or recklessly for the purpose of depriving 
an individual of a federally protected right that those officers or prosecutorial officials are culpable. "
813,2," The district court may withdraw the entire case from the bankruptcy court for ""cause shown."" 28 U.S.C. ยง 157(d). In DeLorean 
Motor Co. v. Allard, 49 B.R. 900, 912 (Bankr. E.D. Mich. 1985), the court stated that the ""cause shown"" test ""is, to be sure, an 
amorphous test. It is a chameleon within the legal lexicon whose definition is created by its application."" The court further 
observed that use of the phrase ""cause shown"" in ยง 157(d): ""Creates a presumption that Congress intended to have bankruptcy proceedings adjudicated in the bankruptcy court unless 
rebutted by a contravening policy. The presumption may be overcome only by an overriding interest based on a finding by 
the court that the withdrawal of reference is essential to preserve a higher interest than that recognized by Congress and is 
narrowly tailored to serve that interest."" 49 B.R. at 912 (emphasis in original)(citation omitted). "
814,3," Plaintiff additionally contends that permissive withdrawal should be allowed under ยง 157(d). See note 2, supra. I do not address 
this issue, however, because of my determination that withdrawal of the reference is mandatory."
814,4," Section 523(c), 11 U.S.C., states: ""Except as provided in subsection (a)(3)(B) of this section, the debtor shall be discharged from a debt of a kind specified in 
paragraph (2), (4) or (6) of subsection (a) of this section, unless, on request of the creditor to whom such debt is owed, and 
after notice and a hearing, the court determines such debt to be excepted from discharge under paragraph (2), (4) or (6), as 
the case may be, of subsection (a) of this section."" "
820,1," Direct Imports and Vintage Wine Selections are related companies, both being owned by Guido Capaldi. Direct Imports is 
engaged in the retail sale and distribution of wine and wine related products, while Vintage is engaged in the promotion of wine 
and wine related products via wine samplings. "
821,2," Thus, the state counter-complaint alleges unfair business competition, while the federal complaint alleges an antitrust violation. "

827,1," The amended complaint in State of New York v. Cedar Park, et al., 85 Civ. 1887, and the complaint in State of New York v. 
Century-Maxim Construction Corp., et al., 86 Civ. 8128, (""the complaints"") are identical except for the named defendants and co-
conspirators."
827,2," The State of New York notified the Court and all parties that it would not assert any additional damage claims. See Letters of 
September 15 and September 22, 1987 from Alice McInerney, Assistant Attorney General."
827,3," The other allegations by the defendants included: a) that the complaints violate Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 52 L. 
Ed. 2d 707, 97 S. Ct. 2061 (1977), by failing to allege sufficiently that the State or its subdivisions directly purchased products 
from the defendants; b) that there had been improper use of grand jury material and unlawful disclosures between individuals in 
the Attorney General's office; c) and that the complaints were either insufficient or required a more definite statement as to G & 
G Concrete Corporation and the individual defendants. See generally 665 F. Supp. 238, 242-48."
827,4," As we have not yet addressed this Court's jurisdiction to award civil penalties under New York's Donnelly Act, we do not fully 
discuss the statute of limitations argument under the state antitrust law. We note, however, that N.Y. Gen. Bus. L. ยง 340(5) has "
828,," the same four-year statute of limitations as described in 15 U.S.C. ยง 15(b) and that N.Y. G. Bus. L. ยง 342-a requires that an

828,5," The State of New York filed an amended complaint in Cedar Park on October 22, 1986, the same day it filed the complaint in 
Century Maxim. "
829,6," In noting that ""facts that should arouse suspicion . . . are equated with actual knowledge of the claim,"" 633 F. Supp. at 1443, 
Judge Ward cited Dayco Corp. v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 523 F.2d 389, 394 (6th Cir. 1975). In Dayco, a case in which a 
corporation brought an antitrust action against the competitor to which it had sold one of its divisions, the Sixth Circuit affirmed 
the district court's finding that the plaintiff's assertions of due diligence were insufficient. The Dayco court held that the plaintiff's 
suspicions should have been aroused by congressional proceedings that had been conducted more than ten years before it 
brought its suit, ""and that its failure to investigate further at that time was not the exercise of due diligence required . . . to employ 
the fraudulent concealment doctrine . . . ."" Dayco, 523 F.2d at 394. Similarly, in Donahue, where defendant's former employees alleged that the defendant corporation had resumed a resale price 
maintenance agreement, the court found that the plaintiffs had not adequately alleged fraudulent concealment because ""neither 
the complaint nor the proposed amended complaint contain[ed] specific allegations of acts by defendant to conceal the antitrust 
violation . . . ."" Donahue, 633 F. Supp. at 1443. "

838,1," The Seventh, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits have agreed with the analysis of the Fifth.  See Morrison v. Murray Biscuit Co., 797

841,2," LEdHN[1D][

] [5B] The dissent's principal fear appears to be not cartelization at either level, but Hartwell's assertion of dominant retail power.  This 
fear does not possibly justify adopting a rule of per se illegality. Retail market power is rare, because of the usual presence of 
interbrand competition and other dealers, see Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 54 (1977), and it should 
therefore not be assumed but rather must be proved.  Cf. Baxter, The Viability of Vertical Restraints Doctrine, 75 Calif. L. Rev. 
933, 948-949 (1987). Of course this case was not prosecuted on the theory, and therefore the jury was not asked to find, that 
Hartwell possessed such market power. "
842,3," LEdHN[6B][
] [6B] The conclusion of ""naked"" restraint could also be sustained on another assumption, namely, that an agreement is not ""ancillary"" 
unless it is designed to enforce a contractual obligation of one of the parties to the contract.  The dissent appears to accept this 
assumption.  See post, at 739-741, and n. 3, 744-746.  It is plainly wrong.  The classic ""ancillary"" restraint is an agreement by 
the seller of a business not to compete within the market.  See Mitchel v. Reynolds, 1 P. Wms. 181, 24 Eng. Rep. 347 (1711); 
Restatement (Second) of Contracts ยง 188(2)(a) (1981).  That is not ancillary to any other contractual obligation, but, like the 
restraint here, merely enhances the value of the contract, or permits the ""enjoyment of [its] fruits."" United States v. Addyston 
Pipe & Steel Co., 85 F. 271, 282 (CA6 1898), aff'd, 175 U.S. 211 (1899); cf. Restatement (Second) of Contracts ยงยง 187, 188 
(1981) (restraint may be ancillary to a ""transaction or relationship"") (emphasis added); R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 29 (1978) 
(hereinafter Bork) (vertical arrangements are ancillary to the ""transaction of supplying and purchasing""). More important than the erroneousness of the dissent's common-law analysis of ""naked"" and ""ancillary"" restraints are the 
perverse economic consequences of permitting nonprice vertical restraints to avoid per se invalidity only through attachment to 
an express contractual obligation.  Such an approach is contrary to the express views of the principal scholar on whom the 
dissent relies.  See 7 P. Areeda, Antitrust Law ยง 1457c, p. 170 (1986) (hereinafter Areeda) (legality of terminating price cutter 
should not depend upon formal adoption of service obligations that termination is assertedly designed to protect).  In the precise 
case of a vertical agreement to terminate other dealers, for example, there is no conceivable reason why the existence of an 
exclusivity commitment by the manufacturer to the one remaining dealer would render anticompetitive effects less likely, or the 
procompetitive effects on services more likely -- so that the dissent's line for per se illegality fails to meet the requirement of 
Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., supra, at 59, that it be based on ""demonstrable economic effect."" If anything, the 
economic effect of the dissent's approach is perverse, encouraging manufacturers to agree to otherwise inefficient contractual 
provisions for the sole purpose of attaching to them efficient nonprice vertical restraints which, only by reason of such 
attachment, can avoid per se invalidity as ""naked"" restraints.  The dissent's approach would therefore create precisely the kind of 
""irrational dislocation in the market"" that legal rules in this area should be designed to avoid.  Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite 
Service Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 764 (1984). "
843,4," [****24]   LEdHN[7B][
] [7B] The dissent apparently believes that whether a restraint is horizontal depends upon whether its anticompetitive effects are 
horizontal, and not upon whether it is the product of a horizontal agreement.  Post, at 745-747, and n. 10.  That is of course a 
conceivable way of talking, but if it were the language of antitrust analysis there would be no such thing as an unlawful vertical 
restraint, since all anticompetitive effects are by definition horizontal effects.  The dissent quotes a statement of Professor 
Areeda as supposed adoption of its definition of horizontal restraint.  Post, at 745-746, n. 10, quoting Areeda ยง 1457d, p. 174.  
That statement seems to us to be, to the contrary, Professor Areeda's attempt to explain a peculiar usage of the term 
""horizontal"" in Cernuto, Inc. v. United Cabinet Corp., 595 F.2d 164, 168 (CA3 1979), noting that (even though Cernuto did not 
involve a horizontal restraint) the use of the term ""horizontal"" was ""appropriate to capture the fact that dealer interests opposed 
to those of the manufacturer were being served."" Areeda ยง 1457d, p. 174.  The dissent also seeks to associate Judge Bork with 
its terminological confusion.  See post, at 746, n. 10, quoting Bork 288.  What the quoted passage says, however, is that a 
facially vertical restraint imposed by a manufacturer only because it has been coerced by a ""horizontal cartel"" agreement among 
his distributors is in reality a horizontal restraint.  That says precisely what we say: that a restraint is horizontal not because it 
has horizontal effects, but because it is the product of a horizontal agreement. "
844,5," Contrary to the dissent, post, at 742-743, 747, General Motors does not differ from the present case merely in that it involved a 
three-party rather than a two-party agreement.  The agreement was among competitors in General Motors; it was between 
noncompetitors here.  Cf. Bork 330 (defining ""boycotts"" as ""agreements among competitors to refuse to deal""). "
845,1," Section 1 of the Sherman Act, as set forth in 15 U. S. C. ยง 1, provides: ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several 
States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."" "
846,2," See, e. g., Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Society, 457 U.S. 332, 350, n. 22 (1982); United States v. Topco Associates, 
Inc., 405 U.S. 596, 608 (1972); Northern Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5 (1958). "
847,3," Thus, in Morrison v. Murray Biscuit Co., 797 F.2d 1430 (CA7 1986), cited ante, at 720, n. 1, the plaintiff had been terminated 
because he violated a lawful restriction on the customers to whom he could sell.  As the court correctly explained: ""As long as the supplier's motive is not to keep his established dealers' prices up but only to maintain his system of lawful 
nonprice restrictions, he can terminate noncomplying dealers without fear of antitrust liability even if he learns about the violation 
from dealers whose principal or perhaps only concern is with protecting their prices."" 797 F.2d, at 1440. There was no such justification for the termination in this case. "
848,4," ""When a manufacturer acts on its own, in pursuing its own market strategy, it is seeking to compete with other manufacturers 
by imposing what may be defended as reasonable vertical restraints.  This would appear to be the rationale of the GTE Sylvania 
decision.  However, if the action of a manufacturer or other supplier is taken at the direction of its customer, the restraint 
becomes primarily horizontal in nature in that one customer is seeking to suppress its competition by utilizing the power of a 
common supplier.  Therefore, although the termination in such a situation is, itself, a vertical restraint, the desired impact is 
horizontal and on the dealer, not the manufacturer, level."" Cernuto, Inc. v. United Cabinet Corp., 595 F.2d 164, 168 (CA3 1979)."
848,5," Thus, a boycott ""is not to be tolerated merely because the victim is just one merchant whose business is so small that his 
destruction makes little difference to the economy.  Monopoly can as surely thrive by the elimination of such small businessmen, 
one at a time, as it can by driving them out in large groups."" Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., 359 U.S., at 213, 
(footnote omitted).  Again, Judge Adams' analysis in the Cernuto opinion, n. 4, supra, is relevant: ""The importance of the horizontal nature of this arrangement is illustrated by United States v. General Motors Corp., 384 U.S. 
127 . . . (1966).  Although General Motors, the manufacturer, was seemingly imposing vertical restraints when it pressured 
recalcitrant automobile dealers not to deal with discounters, the Supreme Court noted that in fact these restraints were induced 
by the dealers seeking to choke off aggressive competitors at their level, and found a per se violation, rejecting the suggestion 
that only unilateral restraints were at issue.  So here, if [the manufacturer and the sales representative acted at the 
nonterminated dealer's] direction, both the purpose and effect of the termination was to eliminate competition at the retail level, 
and not, as in GTE Sylvania, to promote competition at the manufacturer level.  Accordingly, the pro-competitive redeeming 
virtues so critical in GTE Sylvania may not be present here."" 595 F.2d, at 168 (footnote omitted). As we said in General Motors: ""The protection of price competition from conspiratorial restraint is an object of special solicitude under the antitrust laws.  We 
cannot respect that solicitude by closing our eyes to the effect upon price competition of the removal from the market, by 
combination or conspiracy, of a class of traders.  Nor do we propose to construe the Sherman Act to prohibit conspiracies to fix 
prices at which competitors may sell, but to allow conspiracies or combinations to put competitors out of business entirely."" 384 
U.S., at 148. "
849,6," See United States v. Colgate & Co., 250 U.S. 300, 307-308 (1919). In Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U.S. 
752, 761 (1984), we noted that ""the basic distinction between concerted and independent action"" was ""not always clearly drawn 
by parties and courts."" In its opinion today the majority virtually ignores that basic distinction.  Thus, ante, at 728, the majority 
discusses the manufacturer's risks arising out of its agreement ""with one dealer to terminate another for failure to provide 
contractually obligated services."" But if such a breach of contract has occurred, the manufacturer should have an independent 
motivation for acting and need not enter into any agreement with a dealer to do so.  As we held in Monsanto, the mere fact that 
the breach of contract may have been called to the manufacturer's attention by another dealer does not make the manufacturer's 
independent decision to terminate a price-cutting dealer unlawful."
849,7," ""We have not wavered in our enforcement of the per se rule against price fixing."" Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Society, 
457 U.S. 332, 347 (1982). Thus, in Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park & Sons Co., 220 U.S. 373 (1911), the Court 
determined that vertical price fixing is per se invalid because resale price maintenance plans serve the profit motives of the 
dealers, not the manufacturers, and are thereby similar to plans pursuant to which the dealers themselves conspire to fix prices.  
Id., at 407-408. There is no doubt that horizontal intrabrand price fixing is per se illegal, even if the conspirators lack the market 
power to affect interbrand competition in a manner that would violate the rule of reason."
849,8," ""Scenarios that involve a firm or firms at one level of activity using vertical restraints deliberately to confer market power on 
firms at an adjacent level are inherently suspect.  To do so is, typically, to inflict self-injury, just as it would be for consumers to 
confer market power on the retailers from whom they buy."" Baxter, The Viability of Vertical Restraints Doctrine, 75 Calif. L. Rev. 
933, 938 (1987)."
849,9," ""Termination responses reflecting the manufacturer's own distribution policy differ greatly from those imposed upon him by a 
complaining dealer. In the latter case, the manufacturer's compliance with the complainer's demand is more likely to be 
anticompetitive. There is a superficial resemblance to Parke Davis in that three parties are involved, but my earlier analysis 
suggested that the key to that case was 'complex enforcement,' which is absent where a complaining dealer simply threatens to 
abandon the manufacturer who continues selling to discounting dealers."" 7 P. Areeda, Antitrust Law ยง 1457, p. 166 (1986). "
850,10," Commenting on Judge Adams' opinion in Cernuto, see nn. 4 and 5, supra, Professor Areeda wrote: ""That the complainer was a single firm did not weaken the 'horizontal' characterization.  Because the elimination of price 
competition was the purpose of the complaint and the termination, the court declared that per se illegality would be appropriate.  
However, the court made clear that no illegal agreement would be found if United was implementing its own unilaterally chosen 
distribution policy.  Thus, the court's implicit theory was that an agreement arose when the manufacturer bowed to the 
complainer's will.  In that situation, the 'horizontal' characterization is appropriate to capture the fact that dealer interests 
opposed to those of the manufacturer were being served."" Areeda, supra, at 174 (footnotes omitted). See also R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 288 (1978): ""A restraint -- whether on price, territory, or any other term -- is vertical, according to the usage employed here, when a firm 
operating at one level of an industry places restraints upon rivalry at another level for its own benefit.  (This definition excludes 
restraints, vertical in form only, that are actually imposed by horizontal cartels at any level of the industry, e. g., resale price 
maintenance that is compelled not by the manufacturer but by the pressure of organized retailers.)"""
850,11," The two critical facts that had not yet been determined by a jury in the Cernuto case are perfectly plain in this case.  As 
Professor Areeda explained: ""The Cernuto case was decided on summary judgment which accepted the plaintiff's view of the facts.  But two facts critical for 
the court will often be obscure.  First, was it the manufacturer's purpose to eliminate price competition as such? Let us assume 
that termination was not based on such completely independent grounds as non-payment of bills.  Even so, the existence of an 
inevitable price effect does not establish a purpose to control prices in a forbidden way.  A purpose to facilitate point-of-sale 
services or to protect minimum economies of scale could induce a manufacturer to limit intrabrand competition.  Notwithstanding 
price effects, such limitations are lawful when reasonable and not subject to automatic condemnation.  Indeed, termination of 
one dealer in order to grant another exclusive distribution rights in an area is generally lawful.  Nevertheless, so long as the 
manufacturer is not implementing his own interest but that of the complainer, the vice of eliminating 'horizontal' competition with 
the complainer's rivals seems equally present when the complainer thereby succeeds in eliminating horizontal competition with 
respect to customers or territories. Second, was the manufacturer coerced or was he indulging his own preferences?  As we 
have seen, this question cannot be answered in the abstract.  The court correctly acknowledged that the manufacturer might 
also be implementing his own unilateral vision of optimal distribution without regard to the complainer's desires and held that no 
illegal agreement would arise if that were the case."" Areeda, supra, at 174-175 (footnotes omitted)."
850,12," ""Let us defer for the moment problems of proof and assume that a manufacturer does not wish to terminate the plaintiff dealer 
but does so to placate the complaining dealer, who would otherwise cease handling the product.  This manufacturer would 
rather keep both dealers but, when forced to choose between them, concludes that terminating the plaintiff hurts him less 
(considering sales lost, transaction costs in finding and perhaps training a replacement, and any spillover effects upon his 
relations with other dealers) than losing the complainer's patronage. ""The present situation is Colgate in reverse.  In Colgate, it was the supplier who was controlling the dealer's behavior.  Here a 
dealer is conditioning his patronage in a way that controls the manufacturer's behavior.  The agreement concept seems parallel.  
But the economic effects can be very different.  From the policy viewpoint, it can matter greatly whether manufacturer or dealer 
interests are being served.  The former is more likely to seek efficient distribution, which stimulates interbrand competition; the 
latter is more likely to seek excess profits, which dampen interbrand competition.  Accordingly, antitrust policy can be more 
hospitable toward manufacturer efforts to control dealer prices, customers, or territories than toward the efforts of dealers to 
control their competitors through the manufacturer. ""Of course, manufacturer and dealer interests are not necessarily antagonistic.  Like the manufacturer, dealers might also 
believe that restricted distribution increases dealer services and sales and thus strengthens interbrand competition.  However, 
this objective seems unlikely when the manufacturer is forced to violate the distribution policy he thinks best.  Although he might 
be mistaken about what his optimal distribution policy ought to be, he should be presumed a better judge of that than coercing 
dealers who always desire excess profits unnecessary for efficient distribution."" Areeda, supra, at 167-168 (footnotes omitted). "
851,13," See 433 U.S., at 58, n. 28 (citing United States v. General Motors Corp., 384 U.S. 127 (1966), and United States v. Topco 
Associates, Inc., 405 U.S. 596 (1972))."
851,14," ""It might be helpful to note at this point that although the majority mentions only the reduction of interbrand competition as a 
justification for a per se rule against vertical price restraints, see ante, at 725-726, our opinion in Sylvania was quite different.  As 
we stated then: ""The market impact of vertical restrictions is complex because of their potential for a simultaneous reduction of intrabrand 
competition and stimulation of interbrand competition.  Significantly, the Court in Schwinn did not distinguish among the 
challenged restrictions on the basis of their individual potential for intrabrand harm or interbrand benefit.  Restrictions that 
completely eliminated intrabrand competition among Schwinn distributors were analyzed no differently from those that merely 
moderated intrabrand competition among retailers."" 433 U.S., at 51-52 (footnotes omitted). In the following pages, we pointed out that because vertical nonprice restrictions imposed by manufacturers may serve to 
advance interbrand competition, the restriction on intrabrand competition should be subject only to a rule of reason analysis.  
Along these same lines, we explained that ""economists also have argued that manufacturers have an economic interest in 
maintaining as much intrabrand competition as is consistent with the efficient distribution of their products."" Id., at 56. Thus, 
although the majority neglects to mention it, fostering intrabrand competition has been recognized as an important goal of "
852,," antitrust law, and although a manufacturer's efficiency-enhancing vertical nonprice restraints may subject a reduction of 
intrabrand competition only to a rule of reason analysis, a similar reduction without the procompetitive ""redeeming virtues"" of 
manufacturer-imposed vertical nonprice restraints, id., at 54, causes nothing but economic harm.  As one commentator has 
recently stated: ""Intrabrand competition can benefit the consumer, and it is therefore important to insure that a manufacturer's motive for a 
vertical restriction is not simply to acquiesce in his distributors' desires to limit competition among themselves.  The Supreme 
Court has recognized that restrictions on intrabrand competition can only be tolerated because of the countervailing positive 
impact on interbrand competition."" Piraino, The Case for Presuming the Legality of Quality Motivated Restrictions on Distribution,

understanding with Hartwell, but because of Business Electronics' sales performance.  If you find that Sharp did not terminate 
Business Electronics pursuant to an agreement or understanding with Hartwell to eliminate price cutting by Business Electronics, 
then you should answer 'no' to question number 1."""

853,16," In Morrison v. Murray Biscuit Co., 797 F.2d 1430 (CA7 1986), cited ante, at 720, n. 1, Morrison, a wholesale distributor, sued 
Murray Biscuit, a producer of cookies and crackers, charging a conspiracy between Murray Biscuit and Feldman, a food broker, 
to suppress price competition between Feldman and Morrison.  Id., at 1431. But it was quite clear that Murray Biscuit ""had 
assigned particular customers to particular middlemen, whether brokers [like Feldman] or warehouse distributors [like Morrison]."" 
Id., at 1435. Judge Posner's opinion explained: ""Suppose that after Sylvania was decided, a seller that had a price-fixing agreement (illegal per se) with its dealers adopted a 
lawful customer allocation agreement pursuant to which it terminated a dealer. That dealer could not sue for price fixing, even if 
the price-fixing agreement had never been rescinded, unless he could show that his breach of the customer allocation 
agreement was not the real reason for his termination; maybe the agreement was a mask behind which the illegal price fixing 
continued.  The reason for Morrison's termination was that he tried to take away a customer who had been assigned to Feldman; 
there is no indication that the assignment was a mask for resale price maintenance.  Since Feldman had the exclusive right to 
sell Murray Biscuit's products to the Certified account, Morrison had no business selling to Certified at any price."" Id., at 1439 
(emphasis added). Judge Posner thus made it clear that although Morrison had been terminated pursuant to a valid vertical nonprice restraint, a 
terminated dealer might prevail if it could prove that the nonprice agreement was ""a mask behind which the illegal price fixing 
continued."" Ibid."
853,17," ""When faced with conflicting evidence, the jury must determine whether the nonprice justifications for the termination 
advanced by the defendant are legitimate, or are mere pretext to disguise a per se illegal agreement with the nonterminated 
dealer to maintain resale prices.  It is the Court's duty under Monsanto to decide whether sufficient evidence was presented for a 
jury to make that determination."" McCabe's Furniture, Inc. v. La-Z-Boy Chair Co., 798 F.2d 323, 329 (CA8 1986), cited ante, at 
720, n. 1. See also L. Sullivan, Law of Antitrust 202 (1977) (""A shorthand method which may help to identify a restraint affecting price as 
naked is to examine the arguments which are being pressed in justification of the practice"")."
853,18," Although at trial respondent had asked the jury to find that it had acted independently, see n. 15, supra, and accompanying 
text, respondent has not disputed, either in the Court of Appeals or here, the jury's finding of an agreement.  (Respondent has, 
of course, contended that no agreement was reached requiring some level of resale price maintenance.  As I have argued, 
though, such an agreement is not needed to invoke the per se rule in a case such as this.) Respondent did argue before the 
District Court for an instruction explaining that ""it must be shown that the manufacturer agreed with the complaining dealer to 
terminate the existing dealer and that, in so agreeing, the manufacturer shared with the complaining dealer the same desire of 
eliminating price competition for the complaining dealer."" 1 Record 151. Respondent later objected to the court's decision not to 
give this instruction, 1 Record 54, 22 Record 1599, but the court in fact had quite carefully explained to the jury that ""what a 
preponderance . . . of the evidence in the case must show in order to establish the existence of the required combination, 
agreement, or understanding is that Sharp and Hartwell knowingly came to a common and mutual understanding to accomplish 
or to attempt to accomplish an unlawful purpose."" Id., at 1584-1585. "
854,19," The Court instructed the jury: ""The Sherman Act is violated when a seller enters into an agreement or understanding with one of its dealers to terminate 
another dealer because of the other dealer's price cutting. Plaintiff contends that Sharp terminated Business Electronics in 
furtherance of Hartwell's desire to eliminate Business Electronics as a price-cutting rival. ""If you find that there was an agreement between Sharp and Hartwell to terminate Business Electronics because of Business 
Electronics' price cutting, you should answer 'yes' to question number 1. ""Sharp, on the other hand, contends that it terminated Business Electronics unilaterally, not as a result of any agreement or 
understanding with Hartwell, but because of Business Electronics' sales performance.  If you find that Sharp did not terminate 
Business Electronics pursuant to an agreement or understanding with Hartwell to eliminate price cutting by Business Electronics, 
then you should answer 'no' to question number 1."" 22 Record 1587. Respondent had asked for an instruction requiring the jury to consider circumstantial evidence as proof of a motivation to 
eliminate price competition only if such evidence could not ""equally be interpreted to show that Sharp terminated Business 
Electronics Corporation for other business reasons and not pursuant to any agreement with Mr. Hartwell to fix resale prices of 
calculators."" 1 Record 148. Respondent objected to the failure to give this instruction, id., at 54, and also objected, more 
specifically, to the instruction that was given on the ground that ""it allows the jury to find against the defendant even if they do not 
believe that Sharp cared about [Business Electronics'] price cutting or if they believe that Sharp had a dual motive in making the 
termination."" 22 Record 1599. The instruction quoted above, though, makes it highly unlikely that the jury would have found for 
petitioner although finding respondent's motives to be mixed ones. "
855,20," Thus, the Courts of Appeals decisions cited by the majority as supporting its view, see ante, at 720, n. 1, are, in fact, 
consistent with the rule that a naked intent to eliminate price competition is per se invalid.  Each of the opinions contains a 
discussion that distinguishes between, on the one hand, an agreement between manufacturer and dealer to eliminate a price-
cutting competitor based solely on an intent to eliminate price competition, and, on the other hand, an agreement between 
manufacturer and dealer to eliminate a price-cutting competitor that is grounded not only in an antipathy to price competition, but 
also in a purpose to implement a procompetitive system of vertical nonprice restraints.  See McCabe's Furniture, Inc. v. La-Z-
Boy Chair Co., 798 F.2d, at 329-330; Morrison v. Murray Biscuit Co., 797 F.2d, at 1439-1440; Westman Commission Co. v. 
Hobart Int'l, Inc., 796 F.2d 1216, 1223 (CA10 1986). Moreover, none of these opinions proposes the rule that the majority 
sanctions today: that an agreement as to some level of resale price maintenance is necessary for invocation of the per se rule in 
these situations. "

863,5," At Kirkpatrick's sentencing on January 6, 1986, Assistant United States Attorney Steven Levy, who was in charge of 
Carpenter's and Kirkpatrick's prosecutions, made the following representation to the court: Your Honor, I guess I would also like to say that the political impact of this case, of this case cannot be underestimated 
[sic]. . . . I can say that the government of Nigeria as well as the State Department [of the United States] have shown a vital 
interest in this case. In fact, the State Department has been very concerned about the possible political impact upon the 
government of Nigeria if the Grand Jury disclosed certain information about who possibly received the payments which are 
set forth in the memorandum that Mr. Carpenter wrote to other senior officers of the corporation. I have as attorney for the Government [of the United States], your Honor, been resisting attempts by the Nigerian 
government to find out this information because I have not had a disclosure order and the State Department has its 
concerns about what would happen if the government of Nigeria actually knew who was involved in this scheme to sort of 
rip off money from this Nigerian contract. This is not a case where there is not a victim. Shagari, who was the president of Nigeria at the time of this contract[,] is now 
under house arrest. Some of these other individuals[,] and I can name them if the Court is interested, are very prominent 
military figures who are still in power in Nigeria. The Nigerian government would certainly like to have their names, . . . . Transcript of Sentencing of Kirkpatrick, dated January 6, 1986, p. 9, 1.21 to p. 10, 1. 22. "
864,6," The term ""Bernstein letter"" is derived from the Second Circuit's opinion in Bernstein v. N.V. Nederlandsche-Amerikaansche 
Stoomvaart-Maatschappij, 210 F.2d 375 (2nd Cir. 1954). Plaintiff Bernstein, a German national, owned a corporation that was 
confiscated by the Nazi government during World War II. The corporation's main asset was a ship; Bernstein was forced to 
relinquish title to the ship, as well as all other interest in the corporation. The Second Circuit initially dismissed Bernstein's suit 
against the ship's subsequent owners on act of state grounds. See Bernstein v. Van Heyghen Freres Societe Anonyme, 163 
F.2d 246 (2nd Cir. 1947). The court reversed itself after receiving a letter from the State Department's Legal Adviser, which 
stated that it was United States policy to permit the courts to exercise jurisdiction over claims to recover property expropriated by 
Nazi officials. The Supreme Court subsequently determined that, while it was proper for a federal court to consider a Bernstein letter, the Legal 
Adviser's recommendation in any given case was not to be considered binding on the court. In First National City Bank v. Banco 
Nacional de Cuba, 406 U.S. 759, 32 L. Ed. 2d 466, 92 S. Ct. 1808 (1972), Justice Rehnquist, announcing the judgment of the 
court, argued that the federal courts should defer to the view of the State Department; but only two other members of the court, 
Chief Justice Burger and Justice White, joined in his opinion. Justices Douglas and Powell, each of whom concurred separately, 
rejected the view that the State Department's view should control. So, too, did Justice Brennan, joined by Justices Stewart, 
Marshall, and Blackmun in dissent. "

867,9," One commentator has noted that Clayco has adopted the ""strict"" view of the act of state doctrine favored by other courts, most 
notably the Second Circuit in Hunt v. Mobil Oil, 550 F.2d 68 (2nd Cir.), cert. denied 434 U.S. 984, 54 L. Ed. 2d 477, 98 S. Ct. 608 
(1977), that precludes examination of a foreign sovereign's motivations. See Bazyler, Abolishing the Act of State Doctrine, 134 
U. Pa. L. Rev. 325, 357 n.190 (1986). Courts and commentators alike have criticized this interpretation of the doctrine as 
discouraging effective enforcement of United States regulatory policies against those who violate the law by engaging in illegal 
or anticompetitive conduct abroad. See, e.g., Industrial Investment Development Corp. v. Mitsui & Co., Ltd., 594 F.2d 48, 55 (5th 
Cir. 1979), cert. denied 445 U.S. 903, 100 S. Ct. 1078, 63 L. Ed. 2d 318 (1980); Sage International, Ltd. v. Cadillac Gage Co., 
534 F. Supp. 896 (E.D. Mich. 1981); Bazyler, supra, at 347. This court has expressed similar concerns with too sweeping an 
application of the doctrine. See Curtiss-Wright, 694 F.2d at 304 & n.5. "
868,10," Assistant United States Attorney Levy's representations at Kirkpatrick's sentencing, supra note 5, were not made in the course 
of these proceedings, were not addressed to act of state questions, and antedated the Legal Adviser's letter by nearly a year."
868,11," The Legal Adviser's letter does urge the court to exercise ""caution and due regard for foreign sensibilities"" at each stage of the 
litigation. In particular, the court is asked ""to endeavor to assure that no unnecessary inquiries are made, or allegations tested, 
during the course of discovery or trial."" Interpreting this passage as a failure on the part of the Legal Adviser to ""sign off"" 
completely on the act of state question, the district court dismissed the Legal Adviser's caveats with respect to the production of 
evidence as impractical and unconstitutional. See ETC, 659 F. Supp. at 1398. The Legal Adviser's expressions of concern about the possible damage to foreign relations that may result from wide-ranging 
discovery against foreign officials should not have been interpreted as a sign of ambivalence about the act of state question. 
Rather, the Legal Adviser simply urged the court to exercise appropriate supervision over discovery and other trial preparation to 
limit damage to foreign sensibilities. This advice is far from impractical. Foreign governments have often expressed their 
dissatisfaction with the wide discovery authorized under the Federal Rules, finding it intrusive and overbroad when compared to 
the European version of the fact-finding process. See Comment, Antitrust Suits Involving Foreign Commerce, 135 U. Pa. L. Rev. "
869,1003," , 1013-17 (1987). American judicial insensitivity to this foreign reaction has resulted in the enactment of ""blocking"" laws, i.e. 
laws that are specifically designed to block the Federal Rules' discovery provisions. See id. at 1016. The State Department's 
advice on this matter should be read as nothing more than a reminder to the district court of the complaints about American 
litigation with which the executive has become familiar."
869,12, See supra note 6.
869,13," That respect is, in our judgment, enhanced when the Legal Adviser is one who, in his former capacity as a federal judge, has 
addressed act of state problems with marked sensitivity and rigor in a particularly demanding context. See Sharon v. Time, 599 
F. Supp. 538 (S.D.N.Y. 1984)."
869,14," ETC has also argued that Mannington Mills' ten-factor balancing test should not result in a dismissal of the case on the basis 
of international comity. See Mannington Mills, 595 F.2d at 1297-98. Since the issue apparently was not raised below, and the 
record is substantially devoid of the sort of information called for by the Mannington Mills test, it would be inappropriate for this 
issue to be examined for the first time on appeal. "
871,15," Carpenter might have met his burden under this standard if he had been officially warned by the United States Government to 
forgo travelling abroad in order to avoid capture by Nigerian agents seeking to bring him to Nigeria for trial. Other evidence -- 
e.g. a pending prosecution or the institution or threatened institution of extradition proceedings -- might also have supported 
Carpenter's assertion of the privilege. The justifications that Carpenter advances in this case, however, amount to nothing more than speculation about Nigeria's 
intentions. First, the warnings by Benson Akindele, who does not appear to be a Nigerian official, do not, standing alone, provide 
a basis for Carpenter's fear of prosecution. And the somewhat ambiguous representation of Assistant United States Attorney 
Steven Levy with respect to Nigeria's ""vital interest"" in the American prosecution of Carpenter, supra note 5, falls short of 
suggesting that Nigeria was preparing to prosecute Carpenter. Second, what Carpenter identifies as a warning from the United States is actually something more remote. The record suggests 
that the Nigerian government, if interested at all in Carpenter, sought only to question him about others rather than prosecute 
him. Moreover, Carpenter himself was not troubled enough by the warning to stay in the United States: he later travelled to the "
872,," Bahamas. To justify his invocation of the privilege, Carpenter would have had to come forward with a good deal more than he 
presented to the magistrate."

conspiracy is unlawful under ยง 2, but restraint of trade without a conspiracy or combination is not unlawful under ยง 1.  Id. at 767 n.13. "
885,2," By ""vertical,"" we refer to the situation in which a manufacturer imposes conditions on the sale of its goods by dealers or other 
parties in the distribution chain. See R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox: A Policy at War with Itself 288 (1978). If a manufacturer also 
sells its own goods as a retailer, there is a horizontal element to the conduct. In our case, the manufacturer, James Jeans, sells 
its product solely to independent retailers who in turn resell the goods to the consuming public. "
886,3," The per se rule of illegality is applied to those ""certain agreements or practices which because of their pernicious effect on 
competition and lack of any redeeming virtue are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and therefore illegal without

886,4," Monsanto and Business Electronics call into doubt at least one of our earlier cases. In Filco v. Amana Refrigeration, Inc., 709 
F.2d 1257 (9th Cir.), cert. dismissed, 464 U.S. 956, 104 S. Ct. 385, 78 L. Ed. 2d 331 (1983), we considered the quantum of 
proof necessary to establish an illegal price-fixing conspiracy. Id. at 1261. Although Judge Wallace, who authored the opinion, 
presciently stated that ""something more than complaints and termination must be shown [to prove an illegal conspiracy to set 
prices],"" id. at 1263, we concluded that this ""something more"" could be supplied by the plaintiff showing ""a causal nexus 
between complaints and termination."" Id. (emphasis added). We criticized the Third Circuit for its statement in Edward J. 
Sweeney & Sons, Inc. v. Texaco, Inc., 637 F.2d 105, 110 (3d Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 911, 68 L. Ed. 2d 300, 101 S. 
Ct. 1981 (1981), that a supplier's termination of a discounting retailer in response to complaints by other retailers was 
insufficient, standing alone, to show concerted action. Filco, 709 F.2d at 1265 n.2. In Monsanto, however, the Supreme Court 
embraced the analysis in Sweeney. See Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 763-64. In Business Electronics, the Court held that an 
agreement between a manufacturer and a dealer to terminate another dealer for selling the manufacturer's goods at less than 
the manufacturer's suggested minimum resale price is not per se illegal without a showing of ""a further agreement on the price 
or price levels to be charged by the remaining dealer."" Business Elec., 56 U.S.L.W. at 4389. To the extent that Filco conflicts 
with Monsanto and Business Electronics, we are bound to follow the decisions of the Supreme Court. "
887,," Filco also concluded that a conspiracy can be shown by evidence of direct coercion by the manufacturer to ensure adherence to 
its resale price strategy.  709 F.2d at 1263. Whether this portion of Filco survives Monsanto and Business Electronics is explored 
infra."
887,5," As the Eleventh Circuit has put it, ""this evidence need not be such that only an inference of conspiracy may be derived from it. 
It must, however, go beyond equivocal complaints and tend to exclude the inference of independent action."" Helicopter Support 
Sys., Inc. v. Hughes Helicopter, Inc., 818 F.2d 1530, 1534 n.4 (11th Cir. 1987) (emphasis in original)."
887,6," There is evidence in the record that on several occasions, an employee of James Jeans met or sought to meet with the owners 
of The Jeanery to discuss The Jeanery's persistent price cutting. At one of these meetings, Kris Nordstrom, a James Jeans 
sales representative, offered to provide The Jeanery with off-priced goods and factory seconds for its discount outlets if The 
Jeanery would agree to sell a new line of James Jeans' goods at the desired retail price. There is evidence that The Jeanery 
accepted this offer. Although The Jeanery argued at trial that this evidence established an agreement to set prices, and 
requested a jury instruction to this effect, the requested instruction was refused by the trial court. The Jeanery does not argue on 
appeal that the trial court erred in refusing to give the requested instruction. Indeed, its position on appeal is one in support of "
888,," the jury's verdict. The jury returned a general verdict. Because the jury was not instructed that liability might be imposed if it 
found an agreement between James Jeans and The Jeanery to fix the resale price, we must assume that its general verdict 
does not include such a finding. Cf.  Husky Refining Co. v. Barnes, 119 F.2d 715, 717 (9th Cir. 1941) (explaining that ""it is to be 
assumed in the absence of a showing to the contrary that the direction of the court was followed""). The Jeanery did not argue, in opposition to the motion for JNOV, that the jury's verdict could have been based on finding the 
existence of an agreement between it and James Jeans. Nor does The Jeanery present this argument in any fashion in this 
appeal. Consequently, it is not necessary to decide whether the plaintiff has proved an Albrecht-type of conspiracy. See Albrecht 
v. Herald Co., 390 U.S. 145, 150, 19 L. Ed. 2d 998, 88 S. Ct. 869 n.6 (1968) (suggesting that retailer acquiescence in a 
manufacturer's demand makes it the second party to a conspiracy). Nor is it necessary to decide if this portion of Albrecht 
survives the teaching of Monsanto that ""a distributor is free to acquiesce in the manufacturer's demand in order to avoid 
termination."" Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Serv. Co., 465 U.S. 752, 761, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775, 104 S. Ct. 1464 (1984). Like the Court 
in Monsanto, ""we . . . decline to reach the[se] question[s], and we decide the case in the context in which it was decided below 
and argued here."" Id. at 762 n.7."
888,7," We have suggested in other cases that antitrust liability may depend on whether a manufacturer's primary motive in terminating 
a dealer was anticompetitive. See, e.g., O.S.C. Corp. v. Apple Computer, Inc., 792 F.2d 1464, 1467 (9th Cir. 1986) (citing with 
approval Zidell Explorations, Inc. v. Conval Int'l, Ltd., 719 F.2d 1465, 1469 (9th Cir. 1983)). The validity of this approach to 
antitrust liability is placed in doubt by the Supreme Court's Monsanto, Copperweld, Matsushita and Business Electronics 
decisions. These decisions reflect a more sophisticated use of economic analysis in antitrust cases than has previously been 
seen. Easterbrook, supra note 3, at 170-71. In line with this economic awareness, a court should be less concerned with 
subjective notions of motive and more concerned with the economic effect of challenged conduct. Cf.  Matsushita Elec. Indus. 
Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 588-95, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (analyzing the economic arguments 
against a predatory pricing conspiracy and concluding that ""economic realities tend to make predatory pricing conspiracies self 
deterring""); Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 762 (observing that ""the economic effect of . . . unilateral and concerted vertical price setting, 
agreements on price and nonprice restrictions . . . is in many, but not all, cases similar or identical""). "
889,8," In Business Electronics, the Court noted that our decision in Zidell conflicted with the holding of the Fifth Circuit which it 
affirmed.  Business Elec., 56 U.S.L.W. at 4388, n.1."
889,9," The dissent argues that this conclusion is at odds with United States v. Parke, Davis & Co., 362 U.S. 29, 4 L. Ed. 2d 505, 80 S. 
Ct. 503 (1960). We do not agree. As the Court stated in Business Electronics: In Parke, Davis, a manufacturer combined first with wholesalers and then with retailers in order to gain ""the retailers' 
adherence to its suggested minimum retail prices."" 362 U.S., at 45-46, and n. 6. The manufacturer also brokered an 
agreement among its retailers not to advertise prices below its suggested retail prices, which agreement was held to be part 
of the per se illegal combination. This holding also does not support a rule that an agreement on price or price level is not 
required for a vertical restraint to be per se illegal-first, because the agreement not to advertise prices was part and parcel 
of the combination that contained the price agreement, id., at 35-36, and second because the agreement among retailers 
that the manufacturer organized was a horizontal conspiracy among competitors. Id., at 46-47.  Business Elec., 56 U.S.L.W. at 4392 (emphasis in original). "
892,10," Even if the evidence were sufficient to establish an agreement between James Jeans and JJ's to terminate The Jeanery, there 
is no evidence this alleged agreement included ""some agreement on price or prive levels."" Business Elec., 56 U.S.L.W. at 4392. "
893,1," The Court in Monsanto, after reviewing the additional evidence present in that case, found ""something more"" and accordingly, 
affirmed the Court of Appeals, 465 U.S. at 764-768. The key evidence was a statement to Monsanto by a distributor that it would 
maintain the retail price. There was also a rather ambiguous newsletter from another distributor to his dealer-customers. In 
Monsanto, the ""something more"" was in actuality not very much. See Easterbrook, ""Vertical Arrangements and the Rule of 
Reason"", 53 Antitrust L.J. 131, 171-72 (1984)."
893,2," I note that Monsanto does not in any way signal a retreat from Parke, Davis. In fact, in its opinion, the Monsanto court cited 
Parke, Davis at two separate points. See Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 761, 762. "
894,3," One commentator has stated: ""Monsanto clearly does not adopt the implied acceptance or the coercion theory of agreement, 
but it may not entirely reject them either. Taking Colgate as given, the Court did not pursue agreement concepts."" 7 P. Areeda, 
Antitrust Law 83 (1986)."
894,4," Professor Areeda stated: I do not mean to imply that suggestions or persuasion standing alone can be treated as agreements. Rather we are 
focusing on persuasion and exhortations (etc.) in the context of threatened termination. In this context, I would treat these 
additional steps as ""complex."" As Parke Davis pointed out, such a manufacturer is not merely choosing congenial dealers 
in the sense of those who prefer to comply in order to get the goods -- he is trying to get compliance without bearing the 
burden of termination. Such steps approach a seeking of dealer assent to a much greater degree than simple 
announcement of conditions and termination of non-conformists."
894,7," P. Areeda, Antitrust Law 116-17 (1986). "
895,5," The majority characterizes this same exchange as ""reflect[ing] nothing more than an effort by a manufacturer to calm an angry 
customer."" Maj. op. at 1158. Though this may be a plausible interpretation of the exchange, interpreting the exchange as 
evidence of an agreement seems far more probable. In any event, the majority oversteps its role when it announces that the 
exchange falls [so] far short of establishing an agreement"" that the question should not even go to the jury. Maj. op. at 1158. In 
effect, the district court, and the majority, simply arrogated unto themselves the fact-finding function of the jury."
895,6," The majority's analysis seems to proceed from precisely the opposite premise set forth so persuasively by the Third Circuit 
when discussing antitrust conspiracies over forty years ago: ""The picture of conspiracy as a meeting by twilight of a trio of 
sinister persons with pointed hats close together belongs to a darker age."" William Goldman Theatres v. Loew's, Inc., 150 F.2d 
738, 743 n. 15 (3d Cir. 1945). Nowadays, because price-fixing agreements are per se illegal, antitrust conspirators tend to be 
perceptive enough to avoid express written agreements and to deny the existence of any combination or conspiracy; they also 
tend to avoid leaving incriminating evidence lying about."
895,7," In Monsanto, the Court upheld the jury's finding of a conspiracy based on ""direct evidence of agreements to maintain prices,"" 
even though that evidence was subject to lawful as well as unlawful interpretations.  Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 765. "
896,8," This parallels precisely what happened to The Jeanery: Its last order was not filled allegedly because James Jeans was out of 
stock or not in production, but The Jeanery offered persuasive evidence that these reasons were fictitious. "
899,1," The deficiency determined for petitioner's taxable year ended Dec. 27, 1975, resulted from a reduction of an investment credit 
carryback from petitioner's taxable year ended Dec. 30, 1978."
899,2," Unless otherwise indicated, all section references are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 as amended and in effect during 
the taxable years in issue.  All Rule references are to the Tax Court Rules of Practice and Procedure."
899,3," According to respondent, petitioner is one of several taxpayers that have taken conflicting positions with regard to the issue in 
this case."
899,4," For purposes of stipulations, trial, and briefing, the parties stipulated to these definitions of the terms ""folding cartons"" and ""milk 
cartons,"" unless it was clear from the context in which the terms appeared that some other definitions should apply.  We adopt 
the same definitions of the terms, unless it is clear from the context in which the terms appear that some other definitions should 
apply."
899,5," Subsequent to the filing of the criminal case, a separate grand jury convened to consider allegations involving milk cartons and 
did not return any indictments. "
900,6, See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.
900,7," The class initially included indirect purchasers of folding cartons, but was amended on July 15, 1977, to include only direct 
purchasers of folding cartons. See In Re Folding Carton Antitrust Litigation, 75 F.R.D. 727, 737-738 (N.D. Ill. 1977)."
900,8," We use the terms ""milk carton claims"" and ""folding carton claims"" because the parties to this case and to the antitrust litigation 
used such terms.  By using such terms, however, we are not suggesting that there were allegations of one conspiracy involving 
only milk cartons, and allegations of a second, separate conspiracy involving only folding cartons."
900,9," The defendants filing the motion argued, inter alia, that (1) because the milk carton business was distinct from the folding 
carton business, the addition of the milk carton claims to the antitrust proceedings was improper; and (2) continued joint litigation 
of the claims involving folding cartons and the claims involving milk cartons would complicate the antitrust litigation and cause 
prejudice to those defendants required to defend against both types of claims. "
901,10," Certain plaintiffs excluded themselves from the certified class at some point in time, and therefore did not participate in this 
settlement agreement. Separate agreements were negotiated with those plaintiffs, and are discussed infra."
901,11," There was no provision in the settlement agreement indicating that petitioner's payment was based upon petitioner's actual 
sales of folding cartons to its plaintiff-customers."
901,12, The parties have stipulated to this allocation.
901,13," Certain plaintiffs excluded themselves from the certified class at some point in time, and therefore did not participate in these 
settlement agreements.  Separate agreements were negotiated with those plaintiffs, and are discussed infra."
901,14," Defendants did, however, enter into an agreement among themselves with respect to the manner in which they would share 
their liability for various litigation costs incurred in the class action."
901,15," See this opinion, supra, for the defined class in the class action."
901,16," Thus, pro rata distributions were made to purchasers of folding cartons, milk cartons, or both types of cartons. "
902,17, This renewed motion only related to the claims of the opt-out plaintiffs.
902,18, See note 9 supra.
902,19," Portions of any payment shared on a per capita basis also were subject to certain absolute dollar limitation provisions.  Those 
provisions of the general sharing agreement, however, are not material to our decision."
902,20," These provisions of the general sharing agreement referred specifically to the Dean Foods milk carton claim, and did not refer 
to any other milk carton claims of opt-out plaintiffs."
902,21," Such sales percentages were set forth in an exhibit attached to the general sharing agreement. The total of the sales 
percentages for all Dean Foods milk carton signatories was 100 percent. "
903,22, Art. IV governed the settlement of folding carton claims.
903,23," Exhibit A to the general sharing agreement listed the various legal actions brought by the opt-out plaintiffs.  Included in the list 
was the action brought by Dean Foods. "
904,24," A. Petitioner's share of the settlement payment was calculated as follows pursuant to the general sharing agreement provision 
that focused on each defendant's actual sales: .1185 X .95 X $ 500,000 = $ 56,287. B. Petitioner's share of the settlement payment was $ 1,087 under the sharing agreement provision that focused on each 
defendant's per capita share.C. Petitioner's total share of the settlement payment to Dean Foods therefore was $ 57,374 ($ 
56,287 + $ 1,087)."
904,25," Such sales percentages were set forth in an exhibit attached to the Kraft sharing agreement. The total of the sales 
percentages for all Kraft milk carton signatories was 100 percent."
904,26, The parties have stipulated to this allocation.
904,27," As to the amounts paid by petitioner under the settlement agreements discussed herein, the parties to this case agree on the 
portion of such amounts that are allocable to various legal fees to which sec. 162(g) does not apply.  See sec. 1.162-22(a)(2), 
Income Tax Regs. Thus,"
904,28," Sec. 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. sec. 15 (1976), provides, in pertinent part, that ""any person who shall be injured in his 
business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor * * * without respect to the amount in "
905,," controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's 
fee."""
905,29," For a more extensive discussion of sec. 162(g) and its genesis, see Wilberding, ""New Tax Considerations Injected into 
Antitrust Damage Proceedings,"" 19 Kan. L. Rev. 441 (1971). the amounts allocable to legal fees are not in issue, and references in our analysis to petitioner's payments do not include such 
amounts."
905,30," References to any type of civil antitrust litigation hereinafter are to the litigation instituted by purchasers of cartons, and not to 
the civil enforcement action brought by the Government."
905,31," Respondent does not allege that the milk carton claims in the civil litigation are ""related"" to the violation involved in the criminal 
case. We therefore do not address that issue.  The statutory term ""related violation"" is defined in sec. 1.162-22(c), Income Tax 
Regs. See also sec. 1.162-22(f), examples (2) and (3), Income Tax Regs.; Fisher Cos., Inc. v. Commissioner, 84 T.C. 1319, 
1338-1343 (1985), affd. without published opinion 806 F.2d 263 (9th Cir. 1986)."
905,32," For purposes of this test, the ""claim"" in the instant case is the alleged conspiracy, not the milk carton claims and folding carton 
claims.  See note 8 supra concerning our use of the terms ""milk carton claims"" and ""folding carton claims."" "
906,33," It should also be noted, however, that this Court will not give effect to a settlement agreement or similar document written 
solely to enable a taxpayer to claim a deduction.  See Metzger v. Commissioner, 88 T.C. 834, 849-850 (1987); Fisher Cos., Inc. 
v. Commissioner, supra at 1340."
906,34," For instance, since 23.6 percent of the aggregate sales of cartons by all settling defendants to the settling plaintiffs constituted 
sales of milk cartons, petitioner argues that it should be able to allocate 23.6 percent of its settlement payments to milk carton 
claims."
906,35," Petitioner made payments in settlement of the class action and the opt-out plaintiffs' cases prior to the Supreme Court's 
decision in Texas Industries v. Radcliffe Materials, Inc., 451 U.S. 630 (1981). Nevertheless, prior to Texas Industries, as well as 
prior to the time the settlement arrangements discussed herein were entered into by the parties, the legal authority that existed 
on the issue of contribution among antitrust conspirators indicated that there was no such right.  See generally 47 A.L.R. Fed. 
712 (1980). "
908,36," Respondent has not brought any evidence to our attention concerning any distinction that would have been made in the class 
action based upon the actual sales of each of the defendants in that action. "
909,37," Petitioner contends that the sharing agreements ""could not affect in any way the legal liability of a defendant to the Opt-Out 
Plaintiffs on the underlying claims."" Nevertheless, the sharing agreements did give the defendants the ability to affect the 
ultimate net liability of each defendant to the opt-out plaintiffs -- the effect of the general sharing agreement was to avoid the 
noncontribution principles that otherwise apply to antitrust conspirators."
909,38," Petitioner did argue, however, that we should not base allocations upon the provisions of the sharing agreements, and we 
rejected such argument.  See note 37 supra. "
910,39," A milk carton claim against any Kraft milk carton signatory could be asserted against any defendant based upon the principle 
of joint and several liability, absent an agreement precluding Kraft from asserting such claim against other defendants in the 
antitrust litigation."
910,40," The $ 160,747.14 settlement payment represents the total value of petitioner's settlement with the opt-out plaintiffs, which was 
$ 178,569.14, minus legal fees, which were $ 17,822. "
931,1," Counterclaimants allege separate markets for the worldwide services of men's professional tennis players in general, and for 
the services of top-ranked men's professional tennis players. They likewise allege separate markets for worldwide production of 
men's professional tennis events in general, and for major men's professional tennis events. Therefore, counterclaimants assert 
restraint of trade in five, not just three relevant markets. I disagree. While the stakes, volume, and publicity of top-ranked men's 
professional tennis players' services and production of the major events that they play in might be exponentially larger than 
those of lesser known players and tennis events, they nevertheless do not constitute separate markets. "
932,2," Men's professional tennis consists of two types of events: those organized by the MIPTC (""sanctioned events""), and those 
having no relationship to MIPTC (""special events""). The owner of any sanctioned event, who bears complete financial 
responsibility for all aspects of the tournament, is actually a licensee who has obtained a sanction from MIPTC.  The owner can 
retain the sanction and, for some consideration, assign all rights and responsibilities for conducting the event to some other 
person.  In such a case, the owner remains the sanction-holder, and the assignee becomes a de facto owner of the event. "
933,3," Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides in pertinent part that: HN3[

without respect to the amount in controversy."
933,15," U.S.C. ยง 15 (1982). Section 26 of the Clayton Act provides in pertinent part that: any person, firm, corporation, or association shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief, in any court of the United 
States having jurisdiction over the parties, against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws, . . . when 
and under the same conditions and principles as injunctive relief against threatened conduct that will cause loss or damage 
is granted by courts of equity, under the rules governing such proceedings, and upon the execution of proper bond against 
damages for an injunction improvidently granted and a showing that the danger of irreparable loss or damage is immediate, 
a preliminary injunction may issue."
933,15, U.S.C. ยง 26 (1982). 
937,5," The Lanham Act provides in relevant part that: HN10[
] any person who shall . . . use in connection with any goods or services, . . . a false designation of origin, or any 
false description or representation, including words or other symbols tending falsely to describe or represent the same, and 
shall cause such goods or services to enter into commerce, . . . shall be liable to a civil action by . . . any person who

959,13," This is particularly so when the plaintiff is acting as a ""private attorney general,"" and enforcing an important public policy as is 
the case in private antitrust suits. See generally Klingsberg, Balancing the Benefits and Detriments of Private Antitrust 
Enforcement: Detrebling, Antitrust Injury, Standing, and Other Proposed Solutions, 9 Cardozo L. Rev. 1215, 1220 (1988)

959,14," Medtronic also incorporated by reference a Statement by the Defendant in Advance of a Plea of Guilty and a Plea Agreement 
concerning these charges, but these items do not contain information which would clarify Medtronic's claim."
959,15," Because Medtronic has failed to allege an injury, this Court need not reach the issue of whether it has properly pled a violation 
of ยง 1962.  This does not mean to imply that in its current state the part of Medtronic's pleading that pertains to ยง 1962 would 
withstand a motion to dismiss; in fact it seems unlikely that it would. "

963,31," Medtronic's reliance is based on dicta in the opinion stating that if the court had reached the opposite conclusion (i.e. that a 
private action could be brought under ยง 7), ""it would seem that the cause of action would arise at the time of the merger or 
acquisition."" Dairy Foods, 298 F. Supp. at 777. Dairy Foods was not decided on statute of limitations grounds, and even if it had 
been, the point in time at which a cause of action arises under the antitrust laws varies greatly from case to case."
963,32," Similarly, Honorable Kenneth L. Ryskamp, District Judge of the Southern District of Florida, found this argument unconvincing 
when Medtronic made an almost identical motion in a case quite similar to the one before this Court. Cordis Corp. v. Medtronic, 
Inc., No. 84-1239-CIV (S.D. Fla. Nov. 20, 1986)."

963,34," The discussion in Zenith lends support to the argument that the cause of action did not arise until commencement of the ITC 
suit: "
964,," If a plaintiff feels the adverse impact of an antitrust conspiracy on a particular date, a cause of action immediately accrues 
to him to recover all damages incurred by that date and all provable damages that will flow in the future from the acts of the 
conspirators on that date. . . .  Even if injury and a cause of action have accrued as of a certain date, future damages that 
might arise from the conduct sued on are unrecoverable if the fact of their accrual is speculative or their amount and nature 
unprovable. HN24[
] In antitrust and treble-damage actions, refusal to award future profits as too speculative is equivalent to holding 
that no cause of action has yet accrued for any but those damages already suffered. . . . The cause of action for future 
damages, if they ever occur, will accrue only on the date they are suffered . . . . Otherwise future damages that could not be proved within four years of the conduct from which they flowed would be 
forever incapable of recovery, contrary to . . . congressional purpose[s]. Zenith, 401 U.S. at 339-40 (citations omitted)."
964,35, There is no doubt that Medtronic acquired the '242 patent from a corporation.

965,40," Unlike invalidity and unenforceability, noninfringement is not a defense based on the validity of a patent. Rather, it is a defense

966,43," See New Marshall Engine Co. v. Marshall Engine Co., 223 U.S. 473, 478, 56 L. Ed. 513, 32 S. Ct. 238 (1912)."
966,44," See New Marshall, 223 U.S. at 478. The heavy reliance Medtronic placed on Tandon Corp. v. USITC, 831 F.2d 1017, 4 
U.S.P.Q.2D (BNA) 1283 (Fed. Cir. 1987), to counter this point is misplaced. Tandon dealt with a decision of noninfringement 
based on technological considerations.  Moreover, the Tandon Court noted that ""it was the intent of Congress that greater weight 
and finality be accorded to the Commission's findings as compared with those of a trial court."" Id. at 1019. Hence it hardly seems 
that the Federal Circuit intended to imply that ITC decisions could never be accorded res judicata effect."
966,45," Although Medtronic claims that the ITC eventually dismissed the case on jurisdictional grounds, it has presented no evidence 
to substantiate that claim. As the nonmoving party in this motion, Medtronic must present evidence of this assertion if it is to 
demonstrate that there is a genuine issue of fact present. Cf.  Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 256. In fact, the Federal Circuit, when 
rendering a decision on appeal of this court's denial of Medtronic's motion to disqualify counsel, recognized the existence of 
Telectronics' license and in no way indicated that this determination was in doubt in any way. See Telectronics Proprietary, Ltd. 
v. Medtronic, Inc., 836 F.2d 1332, 1334, 1335, 5 U.S.P.Q.2D (BNA) 1424 (Fed.  Cir. 1988) (""Medtronic is the current owner of 
the '242 patent; Telectronics is a current licensee.""). Medtronic also claims that Telectronics has already lost on a similar contention of res judicata when its motion to disqualify 
counsel was decided. Medtronic misreads both the statements of this Court and those of the Federal Circuit. This Court did not 
reach the issue of res judicata in the decision on that motion. See Telectronics Proprietary Ltd. v. Medtronic, Inc., 690 F. Supp. 
170 (S.D.N.Y. 1987); Telectronics, 836 F.2d at 1334. "

Although not dispositive, interpretations of the federal act nevertheless are persuasive in construing the state act.  Elida Inc. v. 
Harmor Realty Corp., 177 Conn. 218, 226, 413 A.2d 1226 (1979). The parties concur that the plaintiff has no independent 
antitrust claim by virtue of the state act, as a determination under the federal act will control.  Motion for Summary Judgment at 
10-11; Opposition Memorandum at 19 n.1. "
980,2," Defendant argues that plaintiff's theory of unlawful combination between Connecticut Handbag and Hartmann Luggage is 
inappropriate because it was not pleaded in the complaint. Reply Memorandum at 4. Hartmann seeks to impose a factual 
pleading requirement that is not mandated by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Plaintiff alleges that Hartmann's refusal to 
deal was a product of ""agreement and combination with other Hartmann Luggage dealers in the State of Connecticut."" 
Complaint para. 26. The court construes this allegation to subsume an agreement or combination with Connecticut Handbag. 
See 2A J. Moore, Moore's Federal Practice para. 8.17[3], at 8-104 (2d ed. 1985) (""the law is now well-settled that HN7[
] antitrust pleading is governed by the generally liberal philosophy of Rule 8.""); id. at 8-113 (""there are certain acts, such as price 
fixing . . . that are presumptively deemed to violate the antitrust laws. Where such per se violation is charged, with resultant harm 
to the plaintiff alleged, the pleading suffices."")."
980,3," Sorisio concedes that he was informed by Irwin Davidson, a regional vice president for Hartmann Luggage, that ""a lot of people 
discount. It just becomes a matter of degrees."" Sorisio Dep. at 35; Opposition Memorandum at 28. Certainly other retailers "
981,," discounted. Bruce Kalish, a regional vice president for Hartmann, indicated that ""most of the stores we sold discounted. . . . Not 
everybody kept full suggested retail."" Kalish Dep. at 31. Moreover, Jim Imwalle, a Hartmann sales representative for Sorisio, 
testified in response to an inquiry seeking ""knowledge as to how [Sorisio's] retail prices of Hartmann products compared to other 
accounts of yours in the State of Connecticut"", that ""They were all similar."" Imwalle Dep. at 24."
981,4," The defendant elicited no testimony on this issue when cross examining these two individuals at their depositions. Both 
depositions antedate that of the plaintiff. Imwalle Dep. 11/12/85; Kalish Dep. 1/21/86; Sorisio Dep. 7/21/86. The first indication 
that plaintiff's action would be based, in part, on a theory of combination between defendant and Connecticut Handbag resulting 
from a coercive threat allegedly made by defendant, was the Opposition Memorandum, filed on December 1, 1987. "
982,5," Kalish does not remember this conversation with Imwalle, Kalish Dep.  at 20-21."
982,6, The page numbers on the copy of Bienstock's deposition are not clear. The court's citations are approximate. 
983,7," One of the dealers, Jack Erlich, indicated in deposition testimony that he didn't recall any discussions where he lodged formal 
complaints with Imwalle. Erlich Dep. at 15. He recalls speaking to a Hartmann salesperson after finding out what type of store 
Sorisio operated ""and to find good merchandise in that type of a store. . . ."" Id. at 12. No testimony was elicited suggesting that 
this dealer complained about prices.  Another dealer, Steve Silver, testified that he recalled several discussions with various 
Hartmann sales representatives, but only one that definitely involved Connecticut Handbag. This was in a December, 1983, 
discussion with Kaspar, when Kaspar volunteered that Hartmann was selling merchandise to Sorisio but was looking to try to 
close the account. Silver Dep. at 5-6. Silver disavowed any discussions of Sorisio's discounting policies with Hartmann, id. at 7, 
or other retailers, id. at 11. "
985,8," Accompanying the form is a hand-written note, which purports to be from Imwalle and that instructs Sorisio to sign the form but 
not to date it. Imwalle's note is dated 4/23/83, although he could not recall when he signed the document. Imwalle Dep. at 67-68. 
Sorisio testified that he received Imwalle's dated note with the policy form. Sorisio Dep. at 110. "
986,9," Plaintiff also maintains that his termination as a franchisee without a good cause or written notice violates the CUTPA. The 
court held that the Connecticut Franchise Act is inapplicable to this action, thus rendering plaintiff's second CUTPA claim moot. "
988,10," Plaintiff neither alleges in his complaint nor pleads in his brief that defendant's conduct caused substantial injury to consumers, 
competitors, or other business people. See Ivey, Barnum & O'Mara, supra, 190 Conn. at 539 n.13, 461 A.2d 1369. See also 
McLaughlin Ford, supra, 192 Conn. at 569-70, 473 A.2d 1185 (to succeed on this third criterion, plaintiff must satisfy three-
pronged ""substantial injury test""). "
995,1," One of defendants' other grounds for dismissal is the failure to establish a relevant market. References in this opinion to a 
BehaviorScan market should not be interpreted as implicitly holding a relevant market has been shown. To the contrary, the 
court agrees with defendants that plaintiff has not shown a relevant market. That issue, however, need not be fully discussed 
since it is held plaintiff lacked antitrust injury and standing. "
997,2," The four aspects of Count IV will hereafter be referred to as Counts IV(i), IV(ii), IV(iii) and IV(iv)."
997,3," If Disher had waived his opportunity to appeal Count I, there very well may have been an estoppel effect. This court, however, 
does not find Disher waived his appeal of Count I. Disher only made clear to the Appellate Court which appellate issues involved 
duplicative relief and therefore would not have to be reached if Disher was successful on one of the other issues. See Brief of "
998,," Plaintiff-Appellant David C. Disher at 3-5, reproduced in Defendant's Supplementary Appendix at 10-12. Disher will not be 
penalized for aiding the Appellate Court by pointing out the overlap and relationship between issues."
998,4," Count IX was added in an amendment to conform the pleadings to the judgment. A copy of this amendment was not provided 
to the court, but presumably Count IX was only a claim for injunctive relief. See Transcript of July 18, 1985 proceedings before 
Judge Porter at 15, Defendants' Appendix at 201. Count VIII only sought rescission and delivery of the stock certificates as relief."
998,5," At a state court hearing on July 18, 1985, defendants' attorney referred to plaintiff amending his complaints to present damages 
claims in federal court only. Plaintiff's attorney referred to this being done by agreement. Defendants' attorney did not concede 
the amendments had been done by agreement, but also did not dispute that they had been. Judge Porter stated he would not go 
on to consider damages if nothing further was to be presented. Id. at 15-16, Defendants' Appendix at 201-02. Under the 
Restatement, acquiescence as well as agreement can result in the splitting of a cause of action. Id. ยง 26(1)(a). "
1000,6," Plaintiff relies in part on United States v. Runnels, 833 F.2d 1183 (6th Cir. 1987), modified in part, 842 F.2d 909 (6th Cir. 1988), 
rehearinq qranted & opinion vacated, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 8293, No. 86-1923 (6th Cir.  May 3, 1988). Runnels is not 
considered because, after plaintiff filed his brief, the Seventh Circuit rejected the holding in Runnels. See Holzer, 840 F.2d at 
1347-48. Also the Sixth Circuit recently granted another rehearing in Runnels. "
1001,7," Recent cases hold that breaches of fiduciary duties do not constitute mail or wire fraud under the theory that the victim is 
deprived of honest and loyal services. See Holzer, 840 F.2d at 1343; Lytle, 677 F. Supp. at 1381-84. Those cases, however, 
involve the question of whether there was a scheme to obtain money or property. They do not involve the question of whether 
the fiduciary breach constitutes fraud."
1001,8," Without developing any argument and without citing any predicate act other than mail or wire fraud, plaintiff refers to 
""extortionistic demands."" See 18 U.S.C. ยง 1961(1)(A); 18 U.S.C. ยง 1961(1)(B) (incorporating 18 U.S.C. ยง 1951). Since the 
argument is not developed, the court does not consider whether extortion as a RICO predicate act has been shown. Since the 
argument is not developed, the court also does not consider whether a ""scheme to defraud [defendants'] employees of money 
they could have earned by selling their services to IRI's competitors by unlawfully restraining the labor market"" has been shown 
and would constitute wire or mail fraud. "
1005,1," Legislative history is in accord. The Senate Report on the proposed bill observed that the court is ""to make a judgment as to 
whether or not the proposed relief is sufficient with respect to the conduct alleged in the complaint."" S. Rep. No. 298, 93rd 
Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1973). In debate in the House of Representatives, Rep. Barbara Jordan explained that ""the judge cannot 
compel the parties to write a different consent decree. He cannot compel the parties to go to trial. But what the judge can do is 
make a judgment as to whether the proposed solution to the alleged violations are [sic] in the public interest. And this is all the 
bill requires of the judge."" 120 Cong. Rec. 36,344 (November 19, 1974). "
1007,2," Even if Koppers had sought to intervene, Koppers would not have qualified for party status. In Stroh the judge rejected as 
""plainly incorrect"" the competitor's argument that the APPA confers a conditional right to intervene, and the judge denied 
intervention on any ground.  1982-2 Trade Cas. (CCH) P. 64,804 at 71,959 n.1. The judge properly considered that the 
competitor ""is motivated by its own private interest."" Id. at 71,961. Here Koppers plainly is motivated by its own private interest 
and so would not qualify for party status. "
1008,3," The hold-separate provision requires BNS and Gifford-Hill (i) to hold the business, including its assets, management, and 
operations, separate and apart from those of defendants; (ii) to provide and maintain sufficient working capital and lines of credit

1008,4," If the consent judgment were approved, the hold-separate provision would continue in effect until BNS had divested itself of the 
Irwindale facility (pursuant to the decree's divestiture provision). The divestiture provision states that if BNS does not sell the 
Irwindale business by the end of the year, a trustee will be appointed to sell the facility at the best price attainable. The district 
court's proper role in the APPA proceeding is to consider whether the divestiture proposal, on these terms, is in the public 
interest. "
1009,5," As if this were not enough, BNS also faces the loss of sunk costs in the form of loan commitment fees and other expenses, 
such as attorneys' fees. These costs amount to $ 13,000,000. They would be wasted if delay from the injunction sabotaged the 
takeover. Not only did the district court fail to weigh this loss into the balance of hardships, the district court denied BNS's 
request for a substantial bond to protect BNS against the irretrievable loss of its sunk costs. This decision alone was abuse of 
discretion calling for us to dissolve the injunction. "
1010,6," In the APPA proceeding Koppers couched its objections in terms of harm to competition as against the public interest. None of 
Koppers' customers or competitors, however, felt the need to object to the merger as harmful to competition. The special interest 
of Koppers' management explains why only Koppers sought a preliminary injunction. "
1020,1," The API production department is headed by a general committee that oversees standardization committees charged with 
formulating standards on categories of equipment. The sucker rod standardization committee was composed of manufacturer 
and user subcommittees. Although these committees participate in the development and revision of API specifications, the final 
authority for the administration of API's product approval program is vested in the director of the production department who, for 
this matter, had delegated his authority to Spanhel."

341, 83 S. Ct. 1246, 10 L. Ed. 2d 389. Unlike the New York Stock Exchange, API is not a self-regulating monopoly sanctioned 
by Congress. Thus, Consolidated's litany of alleged deficiencies in API's monogram licensing process -- including, for example, 
the lack of any avenue of appeal from the decisions of API's Standards Committee and API's monogram licensing staff -- is 
irrelevant. ""The HN17[

States Retail Lumber Dealers Assoc. v. United States, 234 U.S. 600, 608-09, 612, 34 S. Ct. 951, 952-53, 954, 58 L. Ed. 1490 
(1914), the evidence suggested that a combination of retail lumber dealers had agreed not to do business with wholesalers who 
sold directly to the retailers' customers. In Klor's, 359 U.S. at 213, 79 S. Ct. at 710, the plaintiff was an appliance retailer whose 
principal competitor had secured the agreement of the plaintiff's suppliers not to sell appliances to the plaintiff (or to charge 
exhorbitant prices). The plaintiff, without alternative sources of supply, was forced from the business. In Radiant Burners, 364 
U.S. at 658, 81 S. Ct. at 366-67, the only supplier of natural gas in Chicago agreed with an association of gas appliance 
manufacturers to supply gas only to homes using appliances approved by the association. The effect was that consumers could 
not use products unless approved by the association: there could be no demand for a competing manufacturer's gas appliances 
unless the association approved. "
1026,," In Associated Press, 362 U.S. at 4, 65 S. Ct. at 1417, AP's bylaws forbade member news associations from doing business with

imposed by AP than by any boycott. Id. at 24-25, 65 S. Ct. at 1426-27 (Douglas, J., concurring). See also Realty Multi-List, 629

45, 72 L. Ed. 2d 330 (1982), a case Consolidated contends is dispositive of this one, the Court discusses discriminatory 
application of trade standards in conjunction with cases of per se violations. Although this suggests that the challenged practice 
in ASME could have been per se illegal, we note that the later case of Northwest Wholesale Stationers does not include ASME 
in its extensive discussion of cases of per se violations. See 472 U.S. at 293-94, 105 S. Ct. at 2619. In any event, ASME 
involved both regulations that have the force of law and a direct conspiracy between the ASME staff and the plaintiff's

trade standards are a per se violation of Section 1 if shown to be ""unreasonable"": ""any other course would create too great a risk 
of competitive injury"". As we discuss below, although purely advisory trade standards may violate Section 1 under the ""rule of

not permit factfinders to infer implausible conspiracies."
1029,39," In ASME, for example, direct collusion between trade association staff and the plaintiff's competitors led to the association's 
denial of product certification. 456 U.S. at 561-63, 102 S. Ct. at 1939-41."
1029,40," It is significant that API did ultimately revise Spec. 11B to incorporate the three-piece threaded design and certified 
Consolidated's rod. API's decision to establish a subcommittee to study the three-piece, threaded design was consistent with 
earlier concerns about how the design performed in the field. Consolidated's contention that this process was excessively slow is 
unsupported by any evidence of how expeditiously API usually acts on such applications. Nor does Consolidated show 
clandestine meetings, bribes, or other evidence that the user subcommittee or Spanhel were unduly influenced by 
Consolidated's competitors."
1029,41," Consolidated's original complaint alleges that: because of widespread acceptance of and reliance on the API standards as a measure of quality and fitness for use, 
certification by the API through the licensing of its monogram is essential for manufacturers of sucker rods and related 
equipment to compete effectively in the marketplace. In its response, API denies this ""to the extent that during the 1980-82 . . . shortage of production equipment including sucker 
rods, due to the explosive growth in domestic petroleum exploration, . . . plaintiff and other producers . . . sold large quantities of 
rods which did not bear the API monogram""."
1029,42," Whatever API's admission, reproduced in note 41, is taken to mean, Consolidated must present more concrete information on 
""the sucker rod market"" to show the market effects of API's product approval program required by the rule of reason. See 
Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 762, 104 S. Ct. at 1470; GTE Sylvania, 433 U.S. at 51, 97 S. Ct. at 2558; Northwest Power Products, 576 
F.2d at 90-91. Neither party offers this court much useful information about ""the sucker rod market"". For example, we do not 
know how many of the rods are sold each year, how many of these bear the API monogram, whether there are substitutes for 
sucker rods, or how concentrated the market is on the supply or demand side. See generally Landes and Posner, Market Power 
in Antitrust Cases, 94 Harv.L.Rev. 937 (1981), discussing considerations relevant to market power. See also Stigler, A Theory of 
Oligopoly, 72 J. Pol. Econ. 44 (1964), reprinted in Stigler, The Organization of Industry 39 (1968), discussing market factors 
necessary to successful anticompetitive collusion. But see Rowe, Market as Mirage, 75 Calif.L.Rev. 991 (1987), discussing the 
subjectivity inherent in determining the relevant market."
1029,43," We note again that in this respect, this case differs significantly from ASME, where the Court found that "
1030,," [ASME's] codes, while only advisory, have a powerful influence: federal regulations have incorporated many of them by 
reference, as have the laws of most States, the ordinances of major cities, and the laws of all the Provinces of Canada. . . . 
Obviously, if a manufacturer's product cannot satisfy the applicable AMSE code, it is at a great disadvantage in the 
marketplace. "
1030,456," U.S. at 559, 102 S. Ct. at 1938-39. Similarly, the violation in Silver, 373 U.S. 341, 83 S. Ct. 1246, 10 L. Ed. 2d 389, was 
based upon the power granted by law to the New York Stock Exchange to act as a gatekeeper for the financial markets. See 
Northwest Wholesale Stationers, 472 U.S. at 293, 105 S. Ct. at 2619. Here, API's codes have no such legal force."

and the Market Mechanism, 84 Q.J. Econ. 488 (1970)."
1030,45," See Barzel, Measurement Cost and the Organization of Markets, 25 J.L. & Econ. 27, 27 (1982)."
1030,46," Because product information reduces uncertainty, it both increases consumer demand for the product and encourages 
producers to improve their products. See id. at 29-31, explaining how competition can force sellers to provide accurate quality 
information to consumers. These are benefits that the antitrust laws should not discourage. See Eliason, 614 F.2d at 129-30; 
Hatley, 552 F.2d at 653-54; Structural Laminates, 261 F. Supp. at 159; Roofire Alarm, 202 F. Supp. at 169. Cf.  BMI, 441 U.S. 
at 18-23, 99 S. Ct. at 1561-64, and NCAA, 468 U.S. at 103, 104 S. Ct. at 2961, both discussing ""output enhancement"" as an 
indicator of the usefulness of a challenged practice."
1030,47," Economists also acknowledge that the problem is different when quality standards have the force of law. See, e.g., Leland, 
Quacks, Lemons, and Licensing: A theory of Minimum Quality Standards, 87 J. Pol. Econ. 1328 (1979), arguing that if minimum 
quality standards can be enforced effectively, they will be too high if set by the industry itself."
1030,48," See Akerlof, 84 Q.J.Econ. at 499-500, discussing various means of assuring consumers of product quality; Barzel, 25 J.L. & 
Econ. at 32-42, doing the same. See also Grossman, The Informational Role of Warranties and Private Disclosure about 
Product Quality, 24 J.L. & Econ. 461 (1981), arguing that consumer expectations force makers of new products to provide 
reliable information about product quality. "
1031,49," We note that the closing sentences of Consolidated's own statement of the facts on appeal state: During the two year period that Consolidated waited to obtain a monogram from API, the oil boom collapsed and the market 
for sucker rods dried up. Unable to sell even monogrammed sucker rods, Consolidated went into receivership. Appellant's Brief at 12 (emphasis added). This plainly suggests that the lack of the API monogram was far from the principal 
source of Consolidated's business problems."

1035,*," Honorable Albert Lee Stephens, Jr., Senior United States District Judge for the Central District of California, sitting by 
designation. "
1036,1," Assuming that the Fergusons' complaint improperly alleged interstate commerce, we should not dismiss this case ""for lack of 
jurisdiction without giving the plaintiff an opportunity to be heard unless it is clear the deficiency cannot be overcome by 
amendment."" May Dept. Store v. Graphic Process Co., 637 F.2d 1211, 1216 (9th Cir. 1980) (citation omitted); see Timberlane 
Lumber Co. v. Bank of America Nat'l Trust & Sav. Ass'n, 549 F.2d 597, 602 (9th Cir. 1977). The record shows that the 
Fergusons welcomed exhibitors and products from out of state, which were discouraged by Chamber. Although sparse, these 
indications of interstate commerce are not so deficient and clearly incurable as to warrant sua sponte dismissal for lack of 
subject matter jurisdiction at this stage of the proceedings. We reach this conclusion in the context of the minimal showing "
1037,," demanded of the Fergusons. The scope of the Sherman Act is coextensive with the breadth of Congress' power to legislate; the 
Fergusons meet their burden if they can satisfy the very generous ""affecting interstate commerce"" standard. We also decline to remand to the district court for further proceedings on jurisdiction. Such a remand would be an exercise in 
futility because we hold that the Fergusons' complaint should be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be 
granted. See Kern Oil & Ref. Co. v. Tenneco Oil Co., 840 F.2d 730, 734 (9th Cir. 1988). "
1038,2," HN5[
] It is relatively common for courts to render decisions on the merits in antitrust cases notwithstanding uncertain 
jurisdiction. See generally, e.g., McLain v. Real Estate Bd. of New Orleans, Inc., 444 U.S. 232, 245-47, 62 L. Ed. 2d 441, 100 S. 
Ct. 502 (1980); Ronwin v. State Bar, 686 F.2d 692, 698-99 (9th Cir. 1981) (explicitly stating that the plaintiff had failed to 
establish jurisdiction but addressing other grounds), rev'd, 466 U.S. 558, 104 S. Ct. 1989, 80 L. Ed. 2d 590 (decision on merits); 
Timberlane, 549 F.2d at 602-03 (defense attacking commerce allegations is not jurisdictional, but on merits). "
1039,3," We agree with the Fergusons that the ""rule of reason"" analysis applies to the facts of this case and that they need not show 
specific intent under section 1. See Cascade Cabinet Co. v. Western Cabinet & Millwork Inc., 710 F.2d 1366, 1370-73 (9th Cir. 
1983); United States v. Champion Internat'l Corp., 557 F.2d 1270, 1274 (9th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 938, 98 S. Ct.

principal acts [the plaintiff] complains of was the opening of the bidding on the franchise and the receipt of competing bids. It is 
hard to see how that conduct can be called anticompetitive.""); Murdock v. City of Jacksonville, Florida, 361 F. Supp. 1083, 1088-
89 (M.D. Fla. 1973) (exclusive lease, open bidding, no Sherman Act violation). "
1041,5," Because we hold that plaintiffs have failed to present any material issue of fact on the merits of their antitrust claims against all 
defendants, we do not address whether any of the defendants were entitled to summary judgment under the eleventh 
amendment to the United States Constitution, the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, or Parker ""state action"" immunity. See Edelman v. 
Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 39 L. Ed. 2d 662, 94 S. Ct. 1347 (1974) (in private suits against state or its agencies, eleventh 
amendment bars recovery from state treasury); Eastern R.R. Presidents' Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 
5 L. Ed. 2d 464, 81 S. Ct. 523 (1961) (concerted efforts to influence government do not violate antitrust laws); United Mine 
Workers of Am. v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626, 85 S. Ct. 1585 (1965) (same); Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 87 
L. Ed. 315, 63 S. Ct. 307 (1943) (anticompetitive actions taken pursuant to program administered in detail by state are immune 
from antitrust laws). "
1044,1," None of the cases that the majority opinion cites decided that a panel of the court of appeals may proceed to a decision on the 
merits after noting lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Bender has overruled all previously decided cases to the extent of any 
conflict existed, and all subsequently decided court of appeals cases in conflict with Bender are against the law as articulated by 
the Supreme Court and are not valid precedents. Cases containing appellate observations as to what are proper district court 
procedures to resolve jurisdictional problems in complicated cases do not constitute precedent as to what is appropriate 
procedure in the court of appeals. Two Ninth Circuit cases that the majority cites, Kern Oil & Ref. Co. v. Tenneco Oil Co., 840 F.2d 730, 734 (9th Cir. 1988), and 
Kerr Center Parents Ass'n v. Charles, 842 F.2d 1052 (9th Cir. 1988), have been decided since Bender. To the extent they are 
viewed as applicable to this situation, they can not undercut the authoritative value of Bender. This has been recognized within 
the Ninth Circuit since both cases were decided before this circuit decided Latch. Moreover, neither Kerr Center nor Kern Oil 
involved the issue of subject matter jurisdiction. Kerr Center involved state immunity under the eleventh amendment, a defense 
which is not a jurisdictional bar. Kern Oil involved the district court's loss of jurisdiction upon the filing of the notice of appeal. The 
court noted that the doctrine was a judicial creation.  840 F.2d at 734. As I have heretofore noted, the need to establish a nexus 
with interstate commerce is a constitutional necessity. It is also important to note that the majority's reliance on McLain v. Real Estate Bd. of New Orleans, 444 U.S. 232, 62 L. Ed. 2d 
441, 100 S. Ct. 502 (1980), is misplaced. In McLain the Court articulated a very specific standard for determining the sufficiency 
of the nexus to interstate commerce in Sherman Act cases at different stages of the proceedings: Jurisdiction may not be invoked under [the Sherman Act] unless the relevant aspect of interstate commerce is identified; it 
is not sufficient merely to rely on identification of a relevant local activity and to presume an interrelationship with some 
unspecified aspect of interstate commerce. To establish jurisdiction a plaintiff must allege the critical relationship in the 
pleadings and if these allegations are controverted must proceed to demonstrate by submission of evidence beyond the 
pleadings either that the defendants' activity is itself in interstate commerce or, if it is local in nature, that it has an effect on 
some other appreciable activity demonstrably in interstate commerce. "
1044,444," U.S. at 242. Moreover, under McLain, the Fergusons had the burden of ""demonstrat[ing] a substantial effect on interstate commerce."" Id. See 
also Turf Paradise Inc. v. Arizona Downs, 670 F.2d 813, 818-19 (9th Cir. 1982). In McLain the Court allowed the plaintiffs-
petitioners to proceed to trial only because they had met the strict requirements of the McLain test. "
1045,2," Dismissing the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction would not be ""an exercise in futility."" The Fergusons would then 
lose only the right to rely on the Sherman Act. The Idaho courts remain open to them to pursue their claims under the anti-trust 
statutes of Idaho. For this reason the majority decision on the substantive issues is highly prejudicial to the Fergusons who might 
present a very different case in the state courts if allowed to proceed to trial. "
1056,1," See Roberts v. Corrothers, 812 F.2d 1173, 1177 (9th Cir. 1987) (quoting Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80,

L. Ed. 2d 90, 94 S. Ct. 1683 (1974). "
1059,2, The Altemose court did not address this issue. 
1064,3," The court has ordered dispositive motions, realizing that discovery is not complete. At a later stage of the proceedings, the 
court may disregard the perjury as predicate acts if the plaintiffs do not show that the perjury was part of the pattern of 
racketeering. Moreover, if the plaintiffs fail in their proof at trial, the court can direct a verdict before submitting the case to the 
jury. "
1077,1," Remaining plaintiffs are former owners of Fischer Brothers Aviation, Inc. See the court's order dated October 20, 1987. 
Plaintiffs will be hereinafter referred to collectively as FBA. "
1078,2," NW was confronted with essentially the same problem at Minneapolis/St. Paul. NW had a pre-existing contract with Mesaba 
while Republic had a pre-existing contract with Express."
1078,3," Mr. Rasmusson, a representative of NW, also attended portions of this meeting. "
1079,4," HN2[
] Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c), the district court should grant summary judgment only ""if the pleadings, depositions and answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to 
any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."" "
1080,5," The court recognizes and is troubled by the dilemma imposed upon a person in the plaintiffs' position as a result of the court's 
ruling. FBA was in the awkward position of having to choose between risking its present and future business relationship with 
NW by opposing the acquisition in the administrative proceeding or be precluded from relitigating the antitrust issues at a future 
date. Nevertheless, the court feels constrained to abide by the precedent established by the Supreme Court and the Eighth 
Circuit. Moreover, the court appreciates the countervailing economic and societal benefits derived from attaching finality to 
issues resolved by administrative agencies and Courts of Appeals. An additional aside concerns the failure of the DOT to grant NW immunity pursuant to 49 U.S.C. ยง 1384. Statutory immunity, 
however, is a separate and distinct issue from the preclusion issue raised by NW. "
1081,6," ""A common scheme"" requires that evidence ""be presented both that the distributor communicated its acquiesence or 
agreement, and that this was sought by the manufacturer."" Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 764 n. 9."
1081,7," The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit has followed the holding of Monsanto. See, e.g.  Lomar Wholesale 
Grocery, Inc. v. Dieter's Gourmet Foods, Inc., 824 F.2d 582, 589 (8th Cir. 1987); Famous Brands, Inc. v. David Sherman Corp., 
814 F.2d 517, 523 (8th Cir. 1987); Pumps & Power Co. v. Southern States Industries Inc., 787 F.2d 1252, 1256-57 (8th Cir. 
1986)."
1081,8, Plaintiffs' second argument is addressed in footnote 13. 
1082,9," Plaintiffs' ""item of evidence"" numbers 1, 3, 4, 5 and 16 read as follows:"
1082,1, . Northwest's admission that it terminated Fischer Bros. for failure to reach an agreement with Simmons;
1082,3," . Northwest's financial interest in Simmons, and its desire to sell its interest at a profit;"
1082,4, . the personal relationship between Rasmusson and the principals of Simmons;
1082,5, . the presence of Rasmusson at the September 22-23 meetings in Chicago; and
1082,16," . the filing of Simmons' cross-claim against Northwest as a ""friendly lawsuit."""
1082,10," Plaintiffs' ""item of evidence"" numbers 8 and 14 read as follows:"
1082,8, . the inconsistency between the testimony of Rasmusson and the Simmons' principals; and
1082,14," . the credibility problems and discrepancies in testimony of major witnesses in this case, including Rasmusson, Magary, Hall, 
Rothmeier, Abbott, Murray, and Piper. "
1083,11," Both defendants refute the contentions in plaintiffs' items 6, 13, and 15. NW argues that it was one of the Fischer brothers who 
contacted Rasmusson following the breakdown in negotiations, while Simmons argues that it did not find out about the notice of 
termination until several weeks following the actual notice."
1083,12," Plaintiffs ""item of evidence"" number 9 reads as follows:"
1083,9," . the inability of Northwest to present a coherent, consistent explanation of the decision to terminate Fischer Bros.;"
1083,13," As the court interprets the plaintiffs' memorandum, FBA argues that this third alternative also constitutes concerted activity. In 
other words, plaintiffs seem to argue that by requesting FBA and Simmons to divide the Detroit routes and by terminating FBA 
because a mutually agreeable division was not accomplished, the request and the termination, even if the termination was 
unilateral, constitutes a conspiracy. The court disagrees. While it might be that if Simmons and FBA agreed to divide routes, such conduct might establish concerted activity in a suit 
brought by a passenger alleging increased fares as a result of the territorial allocations, FBA's alleged injury does not flow from 
the attempted agreement to divide the Detroit routes. Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 586 (conspiracy must have caused plaintiffs to 
suffer an antitrust injury); Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-o-Mat Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 489 (1977). Instead, the alleged injury was 
caused by the termination, and if such termination was the result of a unilateral decision by Northwest, then there is no 
concerted activity for which FBA has an injury. "
1084,14," NW did not consider terminating Simmons because, unlike the FBA contract, the Simmons contract did not allow for 
termination without cause upon giving six months' notice. Instead, the Simmons contract could not be terminated until October 
29, 1988, without breaching the terms of the contract."
1084,15," Interference with prospective advantage is also known as wrongful interference with business relationships and interference 
with contractual relations. See Wild v. Rarig, 234 N.W.2d 775, 790-91 n. 16 (Minn. 1975)."
1084,16," For some unknown reason, plaintiffs' memorandum did not address the issue of interference with prospective advantage."
1084,17," In addition, plaintiffs' tort claim against Northwest is subject to mandatory arbitration which is now time-barred. The ""arising out 
of or relates to"" language of the arbitration clause includes tort, as well as contract claims, which involve a significant aspect of 
the contractual relationship. Cf.  Morgan v. Smith, Barney, Harris, Upham & Co., 729 F.2d 1163, 1167 (8th Cir. 1984). Plaintiffs' 
claim that Northwest interfered with FBA's prospective advantage by terminating the FBA contract pursuant to a conspiracy is a 
dispute that arises out of or relates to the contract. "
1085,18," The arbitration clause reads, in part, as follows: (a) Any dispute, controversy or claim between the Parties, as to which there are no other necessary or indispensable parties, 
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including its breach, or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which 
cannot be resolved amicably by the Parties, shall be referred to arbitration within 120 days of the date of the alleged breach 
occurred. "
1095,1," The complaint also contains a Lanham Act claim and state law theft of services and unfair competition claims. Although these 
claims were not addressed at the hearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction, plaintiff has reserved the right to pursue 
these claims at trial."
1095,2," Plaintiff moved to supplement the record with additional affidavits.  Defendants oppose this motion. The court has considered 
this additional material, however, the additional material did not affect the outcome of the motion."
1095,3, Richard J. Cowles is Executive Vice President of Telerate. 
1096,4," Anthony Sabatini, Jr. is Vice President for Systems Development of Telerate. "
1098,5," The Excel-A-Rate PC may also be attached to one of the ports of the Telerate Terminal. This hook up does not permit the 
Excel-A-Rate to perform some of the additional features noted previously. It is clear that this method of attaching the Excel-A-
Rate would be in violation of any interpretation of the Standard Agreement."
1098,6," As discussed infra at 234, the product Telerate subscribers purchase is access to the Telerate database. The system and all 
the equipment necessary to provide that access is better viewed as one entity. "
1099,7," Even if the certificate were in fact found to have been issued more than five years after the actual date of first publication, the 
court would be inclined to give the certificate the weight of prima facie evidence, as permitted under Section 410(c)."
1099,8," The theory of vicarious liability in the context of intellectual property is alternatively called ""contributory infringement."""
1099,9," The defendants also assert the defense of unclean hands defense by alleging that the plaintiff has violated the federal antitrust 
laws.  Because the court finds that defendant did not demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of those claims, the 
unclean hands defense is unavailing and, accordingly, not considered in the instant discussion. "
1101,10," Congress amended the Telecommunications Act in 1984 and redesignated Section 605 as Section 705. Nevertheless, Section 
705 is still codified at 47 U.S.C. ยง 605. "
1103,11," The Restatement (Second) of Torts does not treat the law of misappropriation of trade secrets because the Council of the 
American Law Institute determined that reliance on tort principles in the field of trade regulation had diminished as the field has 
evolved into an independent area of the law. See Restatement (Second) of Torts, Introductory Note to Division Nine. "
1105,12," Based on the court's finding that plaintiff has made a showing of irreparable harm, the balance of hardships could not tip 
decidedly in favor of defendants. Accordingly, to prevail on their motion for a preliminary injunction, defendants must 
demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits. "
1107,13," HN26[
] Section 2 of the Sherman Act provides in relevant part: Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to 
monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of 
a felony . . ."
1107,15, U.S.C. ยง 2.
1107,14," A party may establish monopoly power directly or, more commonly, indirectly by demonstrating that the alleged monopolist 
has a large share of the relevant product market. The first step in proving market share is the definition of the relevant product 
market. Defining the relevant market involves determining the various contours of that market: product, geographic area, and 
time. Further, HN27[
] the party alleging the violation bears the burden of establishing the relevant market. In this case, 
defendants have failed to carry their burden of establishing what is the relevant market. See generally Kintner, Federal Antitrust 
Law ยงยง 12.2-12.4."
1107,15, A complete discussion of the relevant market is set forth below. 
1108,16," It is amusing to note that the report observes that Telerate ""dominates the U.S. market for its type of service"" without 
describing the relevant market. In the same breath, the report indicates that Merrill Lynch and IBM are introducing a competing 
financial information service ""[that] has certainly exerted a negative influence."" "
1109,17," Defendants claim, based on the Dean Witter report discussed earlier, that plaintiff's operating income ""exceeded 50%"" in 
1982, 1983, 1984, and 1985. See Defendants' Findings of Fact at 13 para. 38. Telerate, by its executive vice-president Richard 
J. Cowles, claims that its pretax profits are declining and totalled 42% for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1985. See 
Cowles Reply Affid. para. 14."
1109,18," In their memorandum of law, defendants do not contend that Telerate possesses monopoly power in the market for 
peripherals that interface with its database; rather, defendants' argument is that Telerate has used its alleged monopoly power in 
the database market to distort competition in the peripherals market. Nevertheless, in its proposed findings of fact defendants 
advance the argument that Telerate possesses monopoly power in the peripherals market. "

1123,8," LEdHN[6B][
] [6B] The effect, independent of government action, that the 1981 Code had in the marketplace may to some extent have been 
exacerbated by petitioner's efforts to ""market"" the stigma respondent's product suffered by being excluded from the Code. See 
17 F.2d at 941, n. 3. Given our disposition infra, we need not decide whether, or to what extent, these ""marketing"" efforts alter 
the incidental status of the resulting anticompetitive harm. See generally Noerr, 365 U.S. at 142 (noting that in that case there 
were. ""no specific findings that the railroads attempted directly to persuade anyone not to deal with the truckers""). "
1124,9," Similarly in California Motor Transport any antitrust review of the validity of the activity at issue was limited and structured by 
the fact that there the antitrust defendants were ""us[ing] the channels and procedures of state and federal agencies and courts."" 
404 U.S. at 511; see also id., at 512-513. "
1125,10," LEdHN[7B][
] [7B] It is admittedly difficult to draw the precise lines separating anticompetitive political activity that is immunized despite its 
commercial impact from anticompetitive commercial activity that is unprotected despite its political impact, and this is itself a 
case close to the line. For that reason we caution that our decision today depends on the context and nature of the activity. 
Although criticizing the uncertainty of such a particularized inquiry, post, at 513, the dissent does not dispute that the types of 
activity we describe supra, at 503-504, could not be immune under Noerr and fails to offer an intelligible alternative for 
distinguishing those nonimmune activities from the activity at issue in this case. Rather, the dissent states without elaboration 
that the sham exception ""is enough to guard against flagrant abuse,"" post, at 516, apparently embracing the conclusion of the 
United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that the sham exception covers the activity of a defendant who ""genuinely 
seeks to achieve his governmental result, but does so through improper means."" Sessions Tank Liners, Inc. v. Joor Mfg., Inc., 
827 F.2d 458, 465, n. 5 (1987) (emphasis in original). Such a use of the word ""sham"" distorts its meaning and bears little relation 
to the sham exception Noerr described to cover activity that was not genuinely intended to influence governmental action. 365 
U.S. at 144. See also P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P203.1a, pp. 13-14 (Supp. 1987). More importantly, the Ninth 
Circuit's approach renders ""sham"" no more than a label courts could apply to activity they deem unworthy of antitrust immunity 
(probably based on unarticulated consideration of the nature and context of the activity), thus providing a certain superficial 
certainty but no real ""intelligible guidance"" to courts or litigants. Post, at 513. Indeed, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the very 
activity the dissent deems protected was an unprotected ""sham."" 827 F.2d at 465."
1125,11," LEdHN[4E][
] [4E] Although the absence of such anticompetitive motives and incentives is relevant to determining whether petitioner's restraint of 
trade is protected under Claiborne Hardware, we do not suggest that the absence of anticompetitive purpose is necessary for 
Noerr immunity. As the dissent points out, in Noerr itself the major purpose of the activity at issue was anticompetitive. Post, at 
512-513. Our statement that the ""ultimate aim"" of petitioner ""is not dispositive,"" supra, at 504, stands only for the proposition 
that, at least outside the political context, the mere fact that an anticompetitive activity is also intended to influence governmental 
action is not alone sufficient to render that activity immune from antitrust liability. "
1126,12," Even petitioner's counsel concedes, for example, that Noerr would not apply if the Association had a rule giving the steel 
conduit manufacturers a veto over changes in the Code. Tr. of Oral Arg. 41-42."
1126,13," The dissent mistakenly asserts that we today hold that Noerr immunity does not apply to mere efforts to persuade others to 
exclude a competitor's product from a private code. See post, at 514-516. Our holding is expressly limited to cases where an 
""economically interested party exercises decisionmaking authority in formulating a product standard for a private association that 
comprises market participants."" Supra, at 509 (emphasis added); see also supra, at 506-507 (relying in part on the distinction 
between activity involving the exercise of decisionmaking authority and market power and activity involving mere attempts to 
persuade an independent decisionmaker). Cf.  Noerr, 365 U.S. at 136. The dissent also mistakenly asserts that this description 
encompasses all private standardsetting associations. See post, at 515. In fact, many such associations are composed of 
members with expertise but no economic interest in suppressing competition. See, e. g., Sessions, supra, at 461, and n. 2. "

1144,1," The district court granted summary judgment against Liu on the issue of waiver of his defense under 29 U.S.C. ยง 260 and on 
the government's charge that he had violated the FLSA's record-keeping requirements. These rulings are not challenged on 
appeal."
1144,2," This statement cannot be viewed as conclusively admitting that no overtime premium was paid. It could reasonably be read as 
indicating that employees who were paid on a piecework basis did not also receive hourly wages. This reading is confirmed by 
Liu's denial of Requests Nos. 8 and 9, which asked in a more straightforward fashion whether Liu's records showing the 
payment of an overtime premium were false."
1144,3," The Secretary complains that Liu's opposition to the summary judgment motion relied upon materials in the record before the 
filing of that motion, rather than presenting affidavits. However, it is well-established that a party opposing summary judgment 
may rely on material already on file in the case. See 10A C. Wright, A. Miller & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure ยง 2722 
at 55-56 (2nd ed. 1983)."
1144,4," We affirm the grant of summary judgment to the extent it found Liu in violation of the FLSA overtime requirements for the April 
6, 1985 pay period."
1144,5," The Secretary points to several circumstances casting doubt on Liu's defense. Liu destroyed the current records of employees' 
piecework earnings despite FLSA regulations which require preservation of such records for three years, (see 29 C.F.R. ยง 
516.5), thereby shifting the burden of producing evidence to Liu under Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co., 328 U.S. 680, 687-
88, 90 L. Ed. 1515, 66 S. Ct. 1187 (1946). Liu claims to have changed his pay computation practices only during the single two-
week pay period for which the Secretary had obtained original piecework records, and admitted to the violations for the single 
pay period only after it was revealed that the Secretary had copies of the piecework tickets and all of the piecework 
computations for that period. Liu claims he abandoned his long-practiced method of computing overtime for this two-week period 
on the casual advice of a friend, and offers no explanation for returning to it. The district court also noted that Liu's ""piecework 
register"" may not have been prepared until after the litigation had begun. "
1145,6," In Matsushita the Court noted the absence of direct evidence of a predatory pricing conspiracy. 475 U.S. at 583. Left only with

in a ยง 1 case."" Id. at 588. In such a case, the Court said HN4[
] the plaintiff resisting a summary judgment motion ""must show 
that the inference of conspiracy is reasonable in light of the competing inference of independent action or collusive action that 
could not have harmed respondents."" Id. The Court noted that in Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 763, 
104 S. Ct. 1464, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775 (1984), ""we emphasized that HN5[
] courts should not permit factfinders to infer conspiracies 
when such inferences are implausible, because the effect of such practices is often to deter procompetitive conduct."" 
Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 593. ""Thus, mistaken inferences in cases such as this one are especially costly, because they chill the 
very conduct the antitrust laws are designed to protect."" Id. at 594. The Court noted that the only ""direct evidence"" of a predatory 
pricing conspiracy on which the lower court relied was direct evidence of subsidiary combinations which at most was only 
circumstantial evidence of the overall predatory pricing conspiracy plaintiffs sought to prove.  Id. at 595-96. The Court reviewed 
this circumstantial evidence and concluded it did not establish a plausible motive to engage in the alleged predatory pricing 
conspiracy. Id. at 596. HN6[
] ""Lack of motive bears on the range of permissible conclusions that might be drawn from 
ambiguous evidence: if petitioners had no rational economic motive to conspire, and if their conduct is consistent with other, 
equally plausible explanations, the conduct does not give rise to an inference of conspiracy."" Id. at 596-97. The Court concluded 
that HN7[
] plaintiffs alleging an antitrust conspiracy involving predatory pricing can only avoid summary judgment if they 
produce evidence ""tend[ing] to exclude the possibility that petitioners underpriced respondents to compete for business rather 
than to implement an economically senseless conspiracy."" Id. at 597-98 (citations and quotations marks omitted)."

1146,8," In California Arch. Bldg. Prod., Inc. v. Franciscan Ceramics, Inc., 818 F.2d 1466 (9th Cir. 1987), we upheld summary judgment 
against plaintiffs who claimed that defendant defrauded them by encouraging them to buy more goods but keeping its plans to 
close secret. Stressing that ""there is no direct evidence -- no 'smoking gun'"", we noted that ""had Franciscan planned to close, it 
is unlikely that it would have undertaken these expensive projects. It is also unlikely that Franciscan would go to such lengths 
merely to encourage the dealers to buy more tile. No economic incentive to act in that manner exists. Therefore to avoid the 
stigma of implausibility, the evidentiary burden of the dealers is heavy."" Id. at 1470. In Richards v. Neilsen Freight Lines, 810 F.2d 898 (9th Cir. 1987), we affirmed summary judgment in reliance on Matsushita 
where there was no direct evidence of the antitrust conspiracy and the circumstantial evidence ""was as consistent with 
permissible competitive behavior as with illegal conspiracy."" Id. at 904. We explained that Matsushita addressed inference-
drawing: ""the only inferences permitted . . . are those that are reasonable given the substantive law which is the foundation for 
the claim or defense. . . . In the context of the case before us, the substantive law is the law of antitrust, and if the claim makes 
no economic sense, a speculative inference from the jury will not help it. In such an instance, the record on summary judgment 
must contain further persuasive evidence if it is to support the claim."" Id. at 902. See also The Jeanery, Inc. v. James Jeans, 
Inc., 849 F.2d 1148, slip op. at 6388, 6398, 6407, 6412-13 (1988); Wilcox v. First Interstate Bank of Oregon, N.A., 815 F.2d 522, 
525-28 (9th Cir. 1987)(sustaining the grant of JNOV on weak circumstantial evidence of a price fixing conspiracy). United States v. King Features Entertainment, Inc., 843 F.2d 394, 399 (9th Cir. 1988) is not to the contrary. The sole issue in 
that case was whether a contract interpretation was plausible, which ""is a matter of law."" Id. at 398. HN12[
] It is of course 
permissible on summary judgment to assess the plausibility of a legal argument, as opposed to assessing the weight or 
credibility of direct evidence of a material fact. "

evidence concerning a historical fact therefore hinges on the witness' credibility and cognitive abilities, a true conflict concerning 
such evidence is exclusively within the province of the jury. . . . [A] conflict of direct evidence concerning a material historical fact 
may never be settled by the judge on a motion for summary judgment. . . . If the conflict concerns indirect evidence, the judge 
must make an initial determination that the inference to be drawn is a reasonable one, although it is in this area that the power of 
a judge under Rule 56 is most unclear."" "
1151,1," Celestial is a subsidiary of Kraft, and Lipton is a subsidiary of Unilever. Although Unilever has neither entered an appearance in 
this case nor responded in any other manner, the parties are in agreement that Unilever's presence in this action is unnecessary 
at this stage of the proceedings. See Certified Official Transcript of Hearing of June 10, 1988 (filed June 13, 1988) (""Transcript"") 
at 13-14."
1151,2," Defendant originally filed a document entitled ""Defendants' Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiff's Request for a Temporary 
Restraining Order."" At the hearing of May 31, 1988, the defendants agreed that that memorandum was, in effect, a motion to 
dismiss for failure to state a claim, and agreed to have the court consider the documents as such. At the same time, the court 
and the parties agreed on a schedule for expedited discovery prior to a hearing on defendants' motion and, if necessary, a 
hearing on plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction. Rule 12(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that if, on a 
motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, ""matters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court, the 
motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment."" At the hearing of June 10, 1988, the parties agreed that the court might 
treat the pending motion as one for summary judgment. See Transcript at 15. "
1152,3," Defendants agreed to assume for the purposes of this argument that the relevant market is ""herbal tea"" as opposed to ""tea."" 
See Transcript at 18. "
1153,4," The Supreme Court has also noted that ""the mechanism by which a firm engages in predatory pricing -- lowering prices -- is the 
same mechanism by which a firm stimulates competition; because 'cutting prices in order to increase business often is the very 
essence of competition . . . mistaken inferences . . . are especially costly, because they chill the very conduct the antitrust laws 
are designed to protect.'"" Cargill, 107 S. Ct. at 495 n.17 (quoting Matsushita, 106 S. Ct. at 1360). "
1154,5," Even if the court were to have found that plaintiff had raised a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether there was 
a substantial likelihood that Lipton would engage in predatory pricing, plaintiff has failed to submit any evidence raising a 
genuine issue concerning Lipton's ability to absorb the market shares of its competitors once prices have been cut, and the 
barriers to entry in the market when prices are subsequently raised to supracompetitive levels. These factors are also essential 
to a claim of predatory pricing, see Cargill, 107 S. Ct. at 494 n.15, and plaintiff's failure to raise genuine issues of material fact 
with respect to them would also be fatal to its claim of predatory pricing."
1154,6," Indeed, David C. Bigelow testified at his deposition that he does not expect Lipton to increase the amount of advertising and 
promotions for herbal tea previously expended by Lipton and Celestial. See Bigelow Deposition at 182. Mr. Bigelow even 
suggested that there might be a reduction. See id. at 247. "
1155,7," At oral argument, counsel for plaintiff contended that plaintiff would not have a remedy at law if Lipton were to engage in the 
alleged activity because the alleged predatory activity would be too difficult to prove. See Transcript at 55-56. If plaintiff 
concedes that he would not be able to prove that he had suffered antitrust injury once the alleged illegal activity occurred, then it 
is difficult to understand how the court could find that a substantial likelihood now exists that plaintiff will suffer antitrust injury in 
the future. Cf.  Cargill, 107 S. Ct. at 490 (noting that ""it would be anomalous . . . to read the Clayton Act to authorize a private 
plaintiff to secure an injunction against a threatened injury for which he would not be entitled to compensation if the injury 
actually occurred""). "
1169,1," Colt's appeal to the Federal Circuit actually invoked 28 U.S. C. ยงยง 1292(a)(1) and (c)(1), which together grant the Federal 
Circuit exclusive jurisdiction over appeals from interlocutory orders ""granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving [an] 
injunctio[n],"" ยง 1292(a)(1), ""in any case over which the court would have jurisdiction over an appeal under section 1295,"" ยง 
1292(c)(1)."
1169,2," Colt correctly points out that in this case our interpretation of ยง 1338(a)'s ""arising under"" language will merely determine which 
of two federal appellate courts will decide the appeal, and suggests that our ""arising under"" jurisprudence might therefore be 
inapposite. Since, however, ยง 1338(a) delineates the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts over cases involving patent 
issues, the phrase (like the identical phrase in ยง 1331) ""masks a welter of issues regarding the interrelation of federal and state 
authority and the proper management of the federal judicial system."" See Franchise Tax Board of California v. Construction 
Laborers Vacation Trust, 463 U.S. 1, 8, 77 L. Ed. 2d 420, 103 S. Ct. 2841 (1983) (footnote omitted). See also Merrell Dow

jurisdiction require sensitive judgments about congressional intent, judicial power, and the federal system""). "
1170,3," LEdHN[5B][
] [5B] On the other hand, merely because a claim makes no reference to federal patent law does not necessarily mean the claim does 
not ""arise under"" patent law. Just as ""a plaintiff may not defeat removal by omitting to plead necessary federal questions in a 
complaint,"" Franchise Tax Board, supra, at 22 (citations omitted); see Federated Department Stores, Inc. v. Moitie, 452 U.S. 
394, 397, n. 2, 69 L. Ed. 2d 103, 101 S. Ct. 2424 (1981); id., at 408, n. 3 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting), so a plaintiff may not defeat 
ยง 1338(a) jurisdiction by omitting to plead necessary federal patent-law questions. "
1172,4," HN8[
] Rule 15(b) provides in relevant part: ""When issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all 
respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings. Such amendment of the pleadings as may be necessary to cause them to 
conform to the evidence and to raise these issues may be made upon motion of any party at any time, even after judgment; but 
failure to so amend does not affect the result of the trial of these issues."" "
1173,5," There is no reason to apply law-of-the-case principles less rigorously to transfer decisions that implicate the transferee's 
jurisdiction. Perpetual litigation of any issue -- jurisdictional or nonjurisdictional -- delays, and therefore threatens to deny, justice. 
But cf.  Potomac Passengers Assn. v. Chesapeake & Ohio R. Co., 171 U.S. App. D.C. 359, 363, n. 22, 520 F.2d 91, 95, n. 22 
(1975). "
1175,1," Title 28 U.S. C. ยง 1295(a)(1) grants the Federal Circuit appellate jurisdiction over final decisions of federal district courts whose

district courts ""original jurisdiction of any civil action arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents . . . ."" As the Court 
correctly states, ante, at 807-810, ยง 1338 jurisdiction, like ยง 1331 jurisdiction, is over claims, not issues. See H. R. Rep. No. 97-
312, p. 41 (1981) (""Cases will be within the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in the same sense that 
cases are said to 'arise under' federal law for purposes of federal question jurisdiction.  Contrast, Coastal States Marketing, Inc. 
v. New England Petroleum Corp., 604 F.2d 179 (2d Cir., 1979) [Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals properly has 
jurisdiction over issues, not claims, arising under the Economic Stabilization Act]""). In this context, it is important to note that the ""well-pleaded complaint"" rule helps ferret out claims from issues, and says nothing 
about whether such separation should be made only on the basis of the original complaint."
1175,2," Indeed, since it seems plain that no implied cause of action exists under ยง 112 -- which, after all, merely describes the nature of

1182,*," Honorable Oscar H. Davis, United States Circuit Judge, United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, sitting by 
designation. Judge Davis participated in oral argument in this case and voted, before his death on June 19, 1988, in favor of the 
result reached in this opinion. "
1184,1," Ayerst initially sought injunctive relief against and damages from two other parties as well, Pharmacists Planning Service, Inc. 
and its president, Frederick S. Mayer. Pursuant to a stipulation among the parties, Judge Kram dismissed the action as to each 
without prejudice on June 23, 1987. "
1185,2," As Ayerst notes on appeal, technically the motion should have been styled as a Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the 
pleadings, because the notice of motion was filed after Ayerst had filed its answer to the complaint. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b); 
Falls Riverway Realty v. Niagara Falls, 754 F.2d 49, 53 (2d Cir. 1985). Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(2), however, a defense 
of failure to state a claim may be raised in a Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings, and when this occurs the court 
simply treats the motion as if it were a motion to dismiss. See, e.g., George C. Frey Ready-Mixed Concrete, Inc. v. Pine Hill 
Concrete Mix Corp., 554 F.2d 551, 553 & n.2 (2d Cir. 1977). "
1186,3," Technically, the January 1986 Letter, which was submitted as an exhibit to the Mahady Affidavit, was a matter outside the 
pleadings. If appellants had appended the Letter as an exhibit to the complaint, however, or had expressly incorporated the 
Letter by reference into the complaint, the pleadings would be deemed to include the Letter. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 10(c); Goldman 
v. Belden, 754 F.2d 1059, 1065-66 (2d Cir. 1985). Nonetheless the complaint clearly refers to the Letter, and there is no dispute 
as to the Letter's terms. Moreover, appellants did quote the entire text of the Letter in one of their memoranda of law in 
opposition to Ayerst's motion. Under these circumstances, we believe that the magistrate was authorized to treat the Letter as if 
it had been incorporated by reference into the complaint. "
1191,4," The magistrate also held that Zenith's antitrust claim relating to Ayerst's funding of CUREP ""falls woefully short of the use of 
'third-party advertising,' which, in this context, by itself would not 'constitute a violation of the Sherman Act.' Eastern Railroad 
Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 141, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464, 81 S. Ct. 523 (1961)."" In our view, this 
finding was inappropriate on a motion to dismiss. Summary judgment may be appropriate, however, if discovery indicates that 
this ""advertising"" does not overcome the de minimis presumption. "
1197,1, The court does not interpret Haagen-Dazs' motion to seek summary judgment on its second cause of action in No. C-85-6553.
1197,2," Haagen-Dazs has filed objections to certain portions of Double Rainbow's and Two Count's factual record. The objections are 
based on various evidentiary grounds. The court has reviewed each of the objections, and believes that each is well taken. The 
objections are therefore sustained."
1197,3," Haagen-Dazs is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Pillsbury Company.  Haagen-Dazs and The Pillsbury Company are 
collectively referred to here as Haagen-Dazs. "
1199,4, Price restraints are not involved in this case. 
1201,5," Double Rainbow's and Two Count's statistics refer to the San Francisco Bay Area, using only super premium ice creams as the 
product market. Those statistics appear to be flawed, because of their exclusion of some alleged super premium brands. And 
even those statistics show that Haagen-Dazs' share of the alleged super premium market has dropped from 1984 through 1987. "
1202,6," From the briefs in the summary judgment motions, the court does not understand Double Rainbow to argue that it has shown 
sufficient facts to contest Haagen-Dazs' motion on these common law claims. "
1209,1," The Honorable William C. Stuart, United States Senior District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa."
1209,2," HCEC also named as defendants the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, the Iowa Medical 
Society, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals, then Iowa Commissioner of Public Health Norman L. Pawlewski, H. 
Doyl Taylor, Donald C. Young, M.D., Nelson H. Chesney, M.D., Clarence R. Denser, Jr., M.D., and Joseph Sabatier, Jr., M.D. 
As a result of various settlement agreements and unappealed orders of the district court, these defendants are no longer parties 
to this lawsuit."
1209,3," HCEC also alleged violations of (1) the Iowa common law of tort due to interference with prospective business relations, and 
(2) 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. In 1986 the district court granted HCEC's motion to dismiss its tortious interference claim, Health Care 
Equalization Comm. v. Iowa Medical Soc'y, Civ. No. 79-381-A (S.D. Iowa Aug. 4, 1986) (HCEC v. IMS), and entered summary 
judgment in favor of all defendants on the ยง 1983 claim. Id. (Aug. 8, 1986) (the Blues); id. (Aug. 13, 1986) (remaining 
defendants). HCEC does not appeal from these orders. "
1210,4," All defendants joined in a motion to dismiss on the ground that HCEC lacked standing and the capacity to bring this lawsuit. 
The district court denied this motion.  HCEC v. IMS, 501 F. Supp. at 976-80. Appellees assert that the district court erred in 
denying this motion and raise this point of error in what purports to be a cross-appeal (No. 87-1015). Because it would be 
unnecessary to reach this argument if we affirm the district court on all aspects of appellant's appeal, we construe appellees' 
argument to be in the nature of an alternative basis for affirmance. We dispose of this issue infra, note 16."
1210,5," The district court certified its November 5, 1980, and August 4, 1986, rulings for interlocutory appeal. See 28 U.S.C. ยง 1292(b). 
Because all other defendants have been dismissed, these rulings have become final; accordingly, we exercise jurisdiction over 
this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1291. "
1211,6," The four factors set forth in Sound, Inc. were: [1] The existence and nature of any relevant statutorily expressed policy; [2] the nature of the regulatory agency's 
interpretation and application of its enabling statute, including the accommodation of competition by the regulator; [3] the 
fairness of subjecting a regulated private defendant to the mandates of antitrust law; and [4] the nature and extent of the 
state's interest in the specific subject matter of the challenged activity. Id. at 1334. "
1212,7," All discussions of Iowa Code Chapter 514, unless otherwise noted, refer to the Chapter as it read in 1979 at the time of HCEC's 
suit. Subsequent amendments are discussed where relevant."
1212,8," HCEC also appears to argue that the Blues were not obligated to exclude chiropractors because they sometimes made 
reimbursements to their subscribers for services performed by nonparticipating providers. The district court rejected this 
argument because, in its view, such reimbursements are permissible under Chapter 514.  HCEC v. IMS, 501 F. Supp. at 990-91. "
1213,," We do not find the question of whether the Blues in practice reimbursed their subscribers for the services of nonparticipating 
providers to be particularly relevant to the question of whether Chapter 514 authorizes the Blues to include chiropractors within 
their plans."
1213,9," Chapter 514, as originally enacted in 1939, authorized hospital service plans only. 1939 Iowa Acts Ch. 222, ยง 1. "
1214,10," Implicit in this holding is our view that HN9[
] ยง 1013(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act does not express a congressional intent to subject state-authorized boycott activity to the antitrust laws where conducted as part of a state-regulated ""business of 
insurance."" This question was left open by the Supreme Court in St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Barry, 438 U.S. 531, 554, 57 
L. Ed. 2d 932, 98 S. Ct. 2923 n.27 (1978) (""We have no occasion here to decide whether the element of state regulatory 
direction or authorization of the particular practice, absent in this case, is a factor to be considered in the definition of 'boycott' 
within the meaning of [15 U.S.C. ยง 1013(b)], or whether it comes into play as part of a possible defense under the 'state action' 
doctrine as elaborated in Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 87 L. Ed. 315, 63 S. Ct. 307 (1943), and its progeny""). But see Ballard 
v. Blue Shield, 543 F.2d 1075, 1079 (4th Cir. 1976) (""Section 1013(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act expresses congressional 
intention to subject boycotts by insurance companies to the Sherman Act. Consequently, there can be no justification for utilizing 
the principles of Parker v. Brown to impute a contrary intent to Congress."") (footnote omitted). Ballard made clear that West 
Virginia law specifically authorizes the defendant companies to insure the costs of chiropractic treatment, but the defendants 
elected not to provide this coverage. 543 F.2d at 1079. It seems to us unduly anomalous to suggest that Congress, in a statute 
intended to exempt state-regulated insurance practices from the antitrust laws, see Royal Drug, 440 U.S. at 218 n.18, intended 
to subject to the antitrust laws conduct by insurance companies that would be exempt from scrutiny if engaged in by any other 
entity. "
1216,11," HCEC did not allege that the Blues' boycott of chiropractors was related to the alleged monopolization by the Blues of the 
health care insurance market. We also understand HCEC to allege that the Blues attempted and conspired with their co-
defendants to monopolize the health care provider market by refusing to include chiropractors within their health care service 
plans. In view of our holding in Part IIA that this conduct was exempted from liability on HCEC's boycott claim under ยง 1 of the 
Sherman Act due to the state action doctrine, we similarly conclude that the allegations under ยง 2 of the Sherman Act of attempt 
and conspiracy to monopolize by the same conduct were also properly dismissed under the state action doctrine."
1216,12," HCEC also asserted jurisdiction over the ACR pursuant to ยง 12 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 22. The district court concluded 
that this provision did not support jurisdiction over the ACR, HCEC v. IMS, 501 F. Supp. at 980-82, and HCEC has not appealed 
from this ruling."
1216,13," Although HCEC was allowed eight months in which to conduct discovery relevant to its assertion of jurisdiction over the ACR, 
HCEC apparently presented no evidence in opposition to the ACR's motion to dismiss. Although HCEC argues that evidence 
discovered several years after the district court dismissed the ACR as a party suggests that it had jurisdiction over the ACR, we 
will not consider on appeal a theory of jurisdiction or evidence which was not before the district court and which was developed "
1217,," after the ACR had been dismissed as a party.  Universe Tankships, Inc. v. United States, 528 F.2d 73, 76 (3d Cir. 1975); 
Ludwig v. Marion Laboratories, Inc., 465 F.2d 114, 117 (8th Cir. 1972)."
1217,14," Because we conclude that the ACR did not have sufficient minimum contacts with Iowa to satisfy due process requirements, 
we do not reach the district court's assumption that the ACR's alleged conduct fell within the Iowa long-arm statute, Iowa Code ยง 
617.3. "
1218,15," Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e) provides, in relevant part: HN14[
] When a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in this rule, an adverse party may not 
rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the adverse party's pleading, but the adverse party's response, by affidavits or 
as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. If the adverse 
party does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against the adverse party."
1218,16," Because our disposition of this case leaves no defendants remaining in the case, HCEC's allegation that the district court 
erred in denying its motion for summary judgment is moot. We similarly have no occasion to consider appellees' argument as an 
alternative ground for affirmance that HCEC lacks standing or the capacity to bring this suit. Accordingly, ""cross-appeal"" No. 87-
1015 is dismissed.  [**36] "
1225,1," Plaintiffs complaint also sets forth violation of the Delaware antitrust laws, 6 Del.C. ยงยง 2101-2114. HN2[
] The Delaware Antitrust Act requires that the state law be construed in harmony with the interpretation of the federal antitrust law. 6 Del.C. ยง 
2113. Consequently, this Court's discussion and decision with regard to the Plaintiffs' Sherman Act claims shall dictate the ruling 
in the Plaintiffs' state antitrust claims."
1225,2, The parties agree that the relevant product market is the retail food store market. Compare D.I. 25 at 55 n* with D.I. 21 at 36. 
1226,3," Initially the Defendant raised the issue of whether the Plaintiffs Drabbant and Front Street had standing to raise the antitrust 
claims because the Plaintiffs were not injured by the alleged antitrust conduct and the damages allegedly suffered were 
speculative. D.I. 25 at 48. The Defendant's brief was docketed with the Court on May 24, 1988. On May 23, 1988, this Court 
granted the motion allowing the Attorney General of the State of Delaware to intervene as a party plaintiff on behalf of the 
Delaware citizens residing in and around the Milford area and the town of Milford. D.I. 24. At oral argument, counsel for the 
Defendant asked this Court not to rule on the standing issue since the Attorney General intervened. Transcript, D.I. 29 at 46. 
The Defendant did, however, seek to preserve this issue for briefing before trial, in particular as to the Plaintiffs Drabbant and 
Front Street. Id. at 46-47. "
1228,4," Other similarly unsupported statements include the following: Prospective tenants will be irretrievably lost to vacant stores in the shopping center; Present tenants will likely refuse to renew leases as they expire; Revenues to tenants, including the Beauty Shop, and Front Street, will continue to be incalcuably depressed; and damages 
suffered by consumers caused by the lack of competition will be impossible to calculate. D.I. 16, para. 15. "
1230,5," The Plaintiffs latch upon the language ""one of the conditions by which the Milford Safeway purchased by Super Fresh was 
agreed to was that the old Milford Super Fresh location would be totally protected."" D.I. 20A, Exhibit 1. "
1231,6," The pertinent part of the dialogue between Plaintiffs' counsel and Mr. DiFiore is set forth below: Q. But you are missing my question. It says here that Mr. DiFiore said, ""One of the conditions by which the Milford 
Safeway,"" I guess you left out the word was purchased, was ""purchased by Super Fresh was agreed to was that the Old 
Milford Super Fresh location would be totally protected."" What I want to know is who agreed to the condition?  Was it Farley? Was it Leonard? Was it A&P? Who had the responsibility for seeing that that condition was fulfilled? A. Real estate. Q. Okay. And that would be Farley on your level and Leonard on the next? A. Yes. Q. And by that you meant, look, we agreed to buy the Milford Safeway place provided you people would guarantee that the 
former location would be totally protected; is that right? A. Yes. Q. And you are just reminding them of that now; is that right? A. Yes. D.I. 32 at 55. "
1232,7," Two commentators set forth the following factors to consider: Definition of the relevant geographic market depends on the commercial realities of the community in which the shopping 
center is located. Factors to be considered include: the area which the center serves; the location and number of competing 
centers or ""free standing"" retail outlets within that area or in reasonably close proximity; and factors such as physical 
barriers, traffic flow patterns, zoning restrictions, locations of suppliers and shifts in the consumer population. Reilly & Keys, The Antitrust Aspects of Restrictive Covenants in Shopping Center Leases, (ICSC 1986), 22."
1232,8," There seems to be some dispute over the distance of the Super Fresh from the Milford Shopping Center. The Defendant 
alleges, without citing affidavits or deposition testimony, that the Super Fresh is approximately one mile away. D.I. 25 at 5. The 
Plaintiffs, on the other hand, submit affidavits all stating, in the exact same wording, that the nearest supermarkets, presumably 
the Super Fresh and Acme, are two miles away. D.I. 16, para. 10; D.I. 18, para. 9. For purposes of this motion, the Court will 
assume, without deciding, that the Super Fresh in the Milford Shopping is two miles away from the Milford Shopping Center."
1232,9," In point of fact, the affiants are: (1) a president of his own insurance agency who leases space in the Milford Shopping Center; 
(2) the president and chief executive officer of the Southern Delaware Chamber of Commerce; and (3) the vice president of the 
corporation which operates a beauty shop in the Milford Shopping Center. The latter two are those that submit the remarkably 
similar testimony."
1232,10," The Plaintiffs do submit a petition attached to one affidavit. D.I. 17. While petitioners are effective in the political process, their 
impact is lessened in a court of law which adjudicates and preserves the rights of individuals, even if it is against the voice of the 
majority. In this instance, the people signed a petition stating: ""We want and must have a food store in Milford Shopping Center. 
If you feel the same, please sign this petition below. Your help and support is greatly appreciated, by all of the tenant [sic] of the 
Shopping Center."" Id. Thus, rather than providing the Court with the much needed demographic information, the Plaintiffs have 
supplied a list of those who feel that they want a food store in the Milford Center. The importance of the petition is undermined, "
1233,," moreover, after a quick perusal of the petition reveals that people outside of the Plaintiffs' asserted geographic area have signed 
them. If people outside of the Plaintiffs' geographic market are willing to travel to the Milford Shopping Center, why should the 
court assume that those in the community around the Milford Shopping Center are unable to travel two miles to the Milford 
Village?"
1233,11," In their brief, Plaintiffs state that the ""'one-stop-shopping' aspect of a functioning and viable Milford Shopping Center also 
reconfirms the almost obvious fact that the Milford Shopping Center itself represents the relevant geographic market in this 
case."" D.I. 21 at 38. For support, Plaintiffs cite Reilly & Keys at 22 and State of Maryland v. Lee's Sport, Inc., 1981-2 Trade 
Cases, para. 64,365 (Md.Cir.Ct. 1981). The Court finds this unpersuasive. First, Reilly and Keys refer to the ""one-stop shopping"" 
asset in shopping centers as an aspect that defines a ""unique product market."" Reilly & Keys at 22. Secondly, State of Maryland 
v. Lee's Sport, Inc. is an Assurance of Discontinuance which does not constitute an admission by any of the parties with respect 
to any issue of fact or law except as provided in the Maryland Commercial Law Code Annotated, section 11-206(c). Lee's Sport, 
Inc., 1981-2 Trade cases P 64,365 at 74,686. "
1234,12," It is important to note, however, that in Outboard Marine Corp., the defendants conceded for the purpose of the motion to 
dismiss that 35% market share constituted a ""reasonable probability of success."" Outboard Marine Corp., 461 F. Supp. at 404. "
1235,13," It seems that the barriers to entry in this product market would be great, although Plaintiffs did not present evidence on this 
factor. The evidence presented by Plaintiffs, however, indicates that in this particular case, someone is willing to attempt to 
surmount whatever entry barriers that do exist and provide Meatland a place from which to operate in Milford. "
1238,1, Electric power is also provided in Oklahoma by three other investor-owned utilities and by 31 rural electrical cooperatives. 
1239,2," While the Court first articulated the test in the Midcal Aluminum decision, it also approved the compulsion requirement in that 
case. Needless to say, after Midcal Aluminum the federal courts were in complete confusion regarding which test to adopt. In 
Southern Motor Carriers, the Court for the first time clearly rejected the compulsion requirement. See Comment, Private Parties "
1240,," and State Action Immunity to the Sherman Anti-Trust Act After Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference, 24 Houston L. Rev. 
311, 333 (1987)."
1240,3," As a result of this decision, the Commission decontrolled the rates for PSO's outdoor lighting service in April 1985. "
1241,4," Furthermore, the 1984 decision may reasonably be interpreted as only requiring evidence that outdoor lighting is useful to the 
ratepayers, rather than as a limit on the Commission's jurisdiction to regulate the outdoor lighting market. Based on this 
interpretation, the Commission reconfirmed in December 1985 that the outdoor lighting provided by PSO's neighboring utility, 
Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company, should continue to be regulated. The Commission distinguished the PSO case on the 
ground that Oklahoma Gas and Electric's outdoor security lighting earned a ""higher than system average rate of return"" and was 
not subsidized by the other service classes. See In the Matter of the Application of Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company, OCC 
Cause No. 29450, Order No. 290658, p.10 (Dec. 20, 1985). We note that the interpretation of the public utility laws by the expert 
agency charged with enforcement of these laws should be given persuasive weight. E.g., Gambrel v. Kentucky Bd. of Dentistry, 
689 F.2d 612 (6th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1208, 75 L. Ed. 2d 441, 103 S. Ct. 1198 (1983)."
1241,5," PSO also believes it is insulated from liability by the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, which precludes application of the Sherman 
Act to an entity's efforts to obtain favorable treatment from the government, even if its goals are anticompetitive. Given our 
holding on PSO's state action immunity claim, we need not address this issue. "
1242,6," Because of our holding, we need not address whether plaintiffs satisfied the first two elements of attempted monopolization. 
We note, though, that to satisfy the second element, plaintiffs must show there existed a dangerous probability of PSO 
succeeding in monopolizing the relevant market by proving it had the ability to control prices and exclude competition. E.g., 
Shoppin' Bag of Pueblo, 783 F.2d at 164. This would have been a very difficult task, given the fact that the Commission dictated 
to PSO both the price it could charge for leasing outdoor lights and the electricity rates it could levy on competing contractors. 
Cf.  Bright v. Moss Ambulance Serv., 824 F.2d 819, 824 (10th Cir. 1987) (activity which is protected by state action immunity 
may not be the basis for allegations of improper market power). "
1247,*," Honorable William H. Timbers, Senior United States Circuit Judge, United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, 
sitting by designation. "
1248,1," The complaint named three members of the Peugeot corporate family: Peugeot Motors of America, Inc. (""PMA""), a Delaware 
corporation; Peugeot, S.A. (""PSA""), a French corporation; and Automobiles Peugeot (""AP""), a French corporation. PSA owns 
one hundred percent of AP. PSA owns ten percent of PMA and AP owns the remaining ninety percent. Chrysler owns 
approximately fifteen percent of PSA. Except when differentiation is relevant, the Peugeot corporate family will be denominated 
simply as ""Peugeot."" "
1249,2," Dreiling's familiarity with Rule 56(f) is evidenced by the filing of a Rule 56(f) motion and affidavit in response to an earlier motion 
for summary judgment. "
1251,3," In Umdenstock, we reversed summary judgment on an antitrust claim because there was inadequate opportunity for discovery. 
That decision went on to state, ""On the record presented we cannot say with certainty that plaintiffs can prove no facts which 
would entitle them to the requested relief."" Id. at 592. Dreiling has interpreted this statement to require the district courts in 
deciding motions for summary judgment ""to determine whether other facts could exist,"" Dreiling's Opening Brief at 28 (emphasis 
in original), that would create a genuine issue. Even if this were the holding of Umdenstock, it has been overruled by Liberty 
Lobby. The questions of sufficiency of discovery and existence of genuine issues are distinct. If the sufficiency of discovery is not 
at issue, the trial judge should not speculate whether additional evidence could justify a trial but instead should determine 
whether the present record ""is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party."" Liberty Lobby, 477 
U.S. at 248."
1251,4," The Burns and Figa law firm argues that the district court erred in granting Chrysler summary judgment because ""Chrysler 
produced no evidence or affidavits that it played no role in Dreiling's termination."" Burns & Figa Opening Brief at 14. The 
Supreme Court has recently rejected this argument in Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265, 106 S. Ct. 2548 
(1986), finding ""no express or implied requirement in Rule 56 that the moving party support its motion with affidavits or other 
similar materials negating the opponent's claim."" Id. at 323 (emphasis in original). "
1252,5," The district court also concluded that Dreiling lacked standing to object to the alleged Chrysler-Peugeot agreement. It stated: ""Furthermore, Dreiling's alleged injury, its termination as a Peugeot franchisee, could not have been caused by these alleged 
horizontal market division aspects of the agreement between Chrysler and Peugeot."" 605 F. Supp. at 602. We do not reach the 
standing issue, because we agree that Dreiling has not established a genuine issue of horizontal conspiracy. "
1266,1," The difficulty is not occasioned because the claim is too tersely stated. The 45-page complaint in general cannot be 
characterized as a ""short and plain statement"" of the plaintiff's claims. Rule 8(a)(2), F.R.Civ.P."
1266,2," The plaintiff clearly has not stated a constitutional due process claim as there is no allegation in the complaint indicating that 
any defendant was acting under color of state law or was involved in state action. See 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983; Lugar v. Edmondson, 
457 U.S. 922, 929, 101 S.Ct. 2744, 73 L.Ed.2d 482 (1982); Florida Canners Association v. State, 371 So.2d 503 (Fla. 2d 
DCA 1979), aff'd sub nom, Coca-Cola Co., Food Division, Polk County v. State, 406 So.2d 1079 (Fla. 1981). The defendants' 
argument that Count I should be dismissed because Gould assertedly has no property interest in continued radiology privileges 
at Sacred Heart, thus, is misdirected to the extent that it assumes there has been a constitutional due process claim asserted. "
1267,3," Although in this allegation the plaintiff attributes the dissatisfaction with his investment advice to all the defendants, in 
paragraph (18) he identifies only Hobgood, Post, and Haynes as the defendants who received and acted on this advice."

Hospitals, the American Osteopathic Association, the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care, and the 
'Medicare/Medicaid Conditions of Participation.' (2) There shall be no liability on the part of, and no cause of action of any nature shall arise against, any licensed facility, its 
governing body and governing body members, medical staff, or disciplinary body, or its agents or employees for any action 
taken in good faith and without malice in carry out the provisions of this section. Section 395.0115 was amended in 1985 by Chapter 85-175, Section 3, after the incidents occurred which gave rise to this suit. 
The parties do not contend that the amendment applies retroactively, and, thus, I apply Section 395.0115 as it existed when it 
was allegedly violated. "
1268,6," While it is not entirely clear, it appears that the plaintiff does not allege that he was dismissed from Sacred Heart's medical 
staff; rather, he alleges only that his radiology privileges at the hospital were revoked. while revocations of staff privileges are not 
covered by the literal language of Section 10D-28.56(1)(f), it is unlikely that HRS intended the regulation to reach dismissals but 
not curtailments of staff privileges. This interpretation is fortified by the reference in Section 10D-28.58(2)(d), a coordinate 
regulation, to ""withdrawal of any privileges of a member of the medical staff . . . ."" "
1269,7," The plaintiff makes no mention in his memorandum in opposition to the instant motions of the regulations of the Joint 
Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals. Nor has he furnished this Court with a copy of the portions on which he relies. Thus, I 
must assume that he no longer intends to rely upon them. Moreover, there is some question whether a private cause of action 
exists for a violation of those regulations. "
1270,8," Under the plaintiff's interpretation, Section 395.0115 would effectively bar a hospital from entering into an exclusive contract 
with a professional association. Given the recognized benefits to the public of such arrangements [see, e.g., Jefferson v. Parish 
Hospital District No. 2, 466 U.S. 2, 43-44, 104 S.Ct. 1551, 80 L.Ed.2d 2 (1984) (O'Connor, J., concurring)], I find nothing to 
indicate that the legislature intended Section 395.0115 to prohibit such contracts. "
1271,9," I note that while the P.A.'s contract with Sacred Heart, which was signed by the plaintiff on behalf of the P.A., enables the 
hospital to summarily revoke staff privileges under certain circumstances, that is not its only effect. The contract also provides 
advantages to the hospital, patients, and members of the P.A. See Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 v. Hyde, supra, 466 
U.S. at 43 (O'Connor, J., concurring). "
1272,10," HN16[
] An unambiguous contract provision can be interpreted as a matter of law, while an ambiguous provision raises a 
question of fact as to the parties' intent.  Scott Paper Co. v. Taslog, Inc., 638 F.2d 790, 796 (5th Cir. 1981). The preliminary 
question of whether an ambiguity exists is a question of law.  Freeman v. Continental Gin Co., 381 F.2d 459, 465 (5th Cir. 1967). "
1273,," A contract is not rendered ambiguous merely because the parties disagree as to its paper construction. Id. I find that paragraph 
(2) of the plaintiff's employment contract unambiguously establishes that with proper notice the employment relationship was 
terminable at will at the end of the annual contract term. "
1275,11," I note that Count VII alleges that the defendants conspired to interfere with the plaintiff's ""contract and employment relation."" 
(para. 66) (emphasis added). This language reveals the plaintiff's intention to sue for interference with his relationship with the 
P.A. generally, and not merely as defined by his employment contract. Cf.  Thompson v. Allstate, supra, 476 F.2d at 749. "
1276,12," Since the conspiracy is alleged to include others besides the P.A., Hobgood, and Post, the conspiracy does not run afoul of 
the principle that a corporation cannot conspire with its employees. See Buckner v. Lower Florida Keys Hospital District, supra, 
403 So.2d at 1029. I also note that the defendants named in Count VIII may be able to show that their interference was justified. 
""Justification,"" however, is a defense to liability for tortious interference. See, e.g., Wackenhut Corp. v. Maimone, 389 So.2d 656, 
657-58 (Fla. 4th DCA 1980). Because the factual basis for that defense does not appear on the face of the complaint and its 
attachments, I cannot rule on that defense on a motion to dismiss. See Oaxaca v. Roscoe, 641 F.2d 386, 391-92 (5th Cir. Unit A 
1981); 5 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure ยง 1277 (1969). "
1279,13," The market power needed for forcing can exist, for example, when the seller's share of a market is high or when it offers a 
unique product that competitors are unable to provide.  Id. at 17."
1279,14," This allegation would be sufficient if Sacred Heart was the sole provider of the tying services in the relevant market. The 
plaintiff, however, has not made such a claim. See Seidenstein v. National Medical Enterprises, 769 F.2d 1100, 1106 (5th Cir. "
1280,1985," ). I also point out the implausibility of the plaintiff's allegation that all of Sacred Heart's other medical services are tied to the 
P.A.'s radiological services."
1280,15," The defendants argue that the only alleged restraint on competition engendered by the tying arrangement is the plaintiff's 
exclusion from the radiological services market in Pensacola, and that under Hyde, this effect does not, as a matter of law, 
constitute an unreasonable restraint on competition. It may be that the plaintiff is basing his allegation that the tying arrangement adversely affected the price, quality, and quantity of 
radiological services in Pensacola solely on the fact that the arrangement allegedly prevented him from practicing radiology in 
Pensacola. However, that is not a necessary construction of the complaint, and, on a motion to dismiss, I must interpret the 
complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.  Ancata v. Prison Health Services, Inc., 769 F.2d 700, 703 (11th Cir. 1985). It is true that the Supreme Court in Hyde observed that the exclusive contract in that case merely reduced a patient's choice of 
anesthesiologists at the defendant hospital from five to four doctors, and concluded, apparently, that that was not a legally 
significant anti-competitive effect.  466 U.S. at 30-31. But the Hyde Court certainly did not hold that a limitation on choice was 
the only relevant anti-competitive impact. The Court also (unsuccessfully) looked in the record for evidence of an adverse effect 
on the price or quality of anesthesiological services.  Id. at 31 n.52. "
1282,16," Even if such a claim existed, it would not appear to entitle the plaintiff to any relief he could not obtain under one of his other 
anti-trust claims. "
1283,17," I note that this is the only refusal to deal which the plaintiff has properly alleged. While the plaintiff has also alleged that the 
defendants met with various physicians to persuade them not to refer their patients to the plaintiff, there is no allegation that 
these physicians responded to the defendants' persuasion."
1283,18," The defendants argue that even if the plaintiff is able to state a claim for a group boycott, that claim should be evaluated under 
the rule of reason because, as the Supreme Court has recognized, ""[t]he public service aspect, and other features of the 
professions, may require that a particular practice, which could properly be viewed as a violation of the Sherman Act in another 
context, be treated differently."" Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 787 n.17, 95 S.Ct. 2004, 44 L.Ed.2d 572 (1975). In 
order to have the analytical flexibility to consider the unique characteristics of the professions, the defendants seem to contend, 
the rule of reason must govern. See Hackett v. Metropolitan General Hospital, 465 So.2d 1246 (Fla. 2d DCA 1985). This issue 
cannot be resolved on a motion to dismiss. However, I point out that group boycotts characteristically are ""not justified by 
plausible arguments that they were intended to enhance overall efficiency and make markets more competitive."" Pacific 
Stationery, supra, 472 U.S. at 294. If the defendants can show, therefore, that the refusal to deal arose, for example, from an 
arrangement which improved the quality of radiological services provided at Sacred Heart, then it appears that their conduct 
would be judged under the rule of reason. See Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Society, 457 U.S. 332, 349, 102 S.Ct. 2466, "
1284,73," L.Ed.2d 48 (1982); National Society of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 696 & n.22, 98 S.Ct. 1355, 55 
L.Ed.2d 637 (1978). "
1320,1," The Court granted plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint on March 9, 1988, but expressly declined to comment at 
that time on the sufficiency of plaintiff's new allegations. Order, Mar. 9, 1988, at 4. The Court also advised the parties that it 
would stay its consideration of defendants' then-pending motions to dismiss several counts of the original complaint (referred to 
herein as ""Defendants' First Motion"") until the completion of briefing on defendants' motions to dismiss the counts added by the 
amended complaint (""Defendants' Second Motion""). Id. at 5. "

1324,43," Plaintiff contends that the DMS was a ""give away"" under the contract, but according to the Red Cross and Abbott, the contract

Decl. para. 12. Genetic Systems' proposal was identical in this respect. Id. PP 11-12; Wright Decl., Exh. 2 (ANRC 03025). The Red Cross estimates the total value of this portion of the contract to be $ 4.3 million for the two-year period, plus $ 7 million

continued use of the DMS system. Abbott's Reply on Defendants' First Motion, at 4. The contract provides that the monthly 
leasing charge will range from $ 960 to $ 2580 per center depending on whether the Region chooses an alternative supplier for 
only one or all three of the tests. Wright Decl., Exh. 3 (ANRC 02170)."

1326,49," Representative Seldomridge commented: ""This provision, as I read it, seems to affect the seller of goods and not the 
purchaser."" Plaintiff's argument that this portion of the legislative history is not relevant because the term ""contract for sale"" was not then 
included in the statute is unpersuasive since that term does not alter, but merely broadens, the obvious intent of Section 3, which 
is directed at the conduct of sellers."
1326,50," The argument of Genetic Systems that the Red Cross should not be dismissed from this action because it is a properly joined 
party, Plaintiff's Opposition to the First Motion of the Red Cross, at 27-30, is without merit since joinder rules do not override the 
substantive requirements of the antitrust laws that form the basis for this Court's jurisdiction over plaintiff's claims. Carroll v. "

hospital and a firm of anesthesiologists, the Court rejected the plaintiff's contention that the hospital was engaged in a per se 
illegal tying arrangement but commented in a footnote that, had the plaintiff presented such proof, ""the contract"" might have 
been illegal under the Sherman Act, Section 1. The Court's general observation, however, obviously provides no guidance on 
the issue of purchaser liability since it suggest only that ""the contract"" might be found violative of the antitrust laws."
1327,54," See Tampa Electric Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., 365 U.S. 320, 335, 5 L. Ed. 2d 580, 81 S. Ct. 623 (1961) (if a requirements

defendants in Yellow Cab was irrelevant because the original acquisitions of the cab companies by a controlling shareholder 
""were themselves illegal."" 467 U.S. at 761 (emphasis in original). The Court went on to distinguish other prior decision that

1333,74," Plaintiff argues at length that Count V involves issues of fact, such as ""plausibility,"" that cannot be properly decided as a 
motion to dismiss. For the reasons discussed above, however, the Court finds that the motion raises only issues of law and 
plaintiff's arguments that defendants have presented misleading facts or that further discovery would support its claim are 
irrelevant. Indeed, plaintiff itself apparently recognized this at the onset of this case when its Vice President for Sales and Marketing, 
Terrance Bieker, commented that ""while Abbott's actions may offer the Red Cross an apparent temporary economic benefit, in 
the long run Abbott's actions deprive the Red Cross of the benefits of competitively-determined prices and product quality."" 
Bieker Decl. para. 17. The declaration of plaintiff's economist attempts to explain the theoretical rationality that could have 
motivated the Red Cross, but fails to persuade that such speculation is allowed under the antitrust laws."
1333,75," Plaintiff cites the laws of several jurisdictions -- the District of Columbia (the headquarters of the Red Cross), Illinois (the 
headquarters and principal facility of Abbott Laboratories), and Washington State (all of Genetic Systems' facilities) -- but has not 
yet indicated on which State's law it relies. For present purposes, however, any distinctions among these jurisdictions' laws are 
irrelevant. "

1340,1," In 1987, ยง 1395nn was repealed and the statute renumbered and amended by ยงยง 4 and 14 of the Medicare and Medicaid 
Patient and Program Protection Act of 1987, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1320a-7b."
1340,2," The ""Freedom 55/65"" program was commenced prior to the August 18, 1987 enactment of the Medicare and Medicaid Patient 
and Program Protection Act. While the language of ยง 1320a-7b(b)(2)(B) is virtually identical to that of former ยง 1395nn(b)(2)(B), 
we will continue to refer throughout our discussion to ยง 1395nn as it existed prior to its 1987 amendment."
1340,3," Medicare Part A provides insurance coverage for inpatient hospital care and certain other kinds of medical services. See 42 
U.S.C. ยง 1395c, et seq. Medicare Part B (outpatient services) provides for a system of optional supplemental insurance for 
medical care not covered under Medicare Part A. See 42 U.S.C. ยง 1395j, et seq. "
1343,4," Section 14(a) of the Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program Protection Act of 1987 amending former ยง 1395nn (now ยง 
1320a-7b) provides: HN7[
] The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Attorney General, not later than 1 year after 
the date of the enactment of this Act [Aug. 18, 1987] shall publish proposed regulations, and not later than 2 years after the 
date of the enactment of this Act shall promulgate final regulations, specifying payment practices that shall not be treated 
as a criminal offense under section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. ยง 1320a-7b(b)] and shall not serve as the 
basis for an exclusion under section 1128(b)(7) of such Act. Any practices specified in regulations pursuant to the 
preceding sentence shall be in addition to the practices described in subparagraphs (A) through (C) of section 1128B(b)(3)

In enacting ยง 14(a), Congress recognized that the statutory language of ยง 1395nn(b)(2)(B) ""has created uncertainty among 
health care providers as to which commercial arrangements are legitimate, and which are proscribed,"" S. Rep. No. 109, 100th 
Cong., 1st Sess. 25, reprinted in 1987 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News 682, 707, and expressed its intention to deal with the

legislation.  Batterton v. Francis, 432 U.S. 416, 425 n.9, 53 L. Ed. 2d 448, 97 S. Ct. 2399 (1977); United States v. Mersky, 361 
U.S. 431, 437-38, 4 L. Ed. 2d 423, 80 S. Ct. 459 (1960). "
1344,5," With respect to West Allis' claim under section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 1, which was added in an amended complaint 
and made the subject of a supplemental motion for preliminary injunction, the district court concluded that: The illegal conduct which forms the basis for the Sherman Act claim is the violation of section 1395nn. Accordingly, for the 
reasons stated in denying the original request for a preliminary injunction, the [supplemental] request is denied.  West Allis Memorial Hospital, 660 F. Supp. at 941."
1344,6," 15 U.S.C. ยง 26 provides in pertinent part: HN10[
] Any person, firm, corporation, or association shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief, in any court of 
the United States having jurisdiction over the parties, against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws . 
. . when and under the same conditions and principles as injunctive relief against threatened conduct that will cause loss or 
damage is granted by courts of equity, under the rules governing such proceedings, and upon the execution of proper bond 
against damages for an injunction improvidently granted and a showing that the danger of irreparable loss or damage is 
immediate, a preliminary injunction may issue. "
1345,7," The type of factual and legal analysis which was required in the present case is similar to that undertaken in Ball Memorial 
Hospital, Inc. v. Mutual Hospital Insurance, Inc., 603 F. Supp. 1077 (S.D. Ind. 1985), aff'd, 784 F.2d 1325 (7th Cir. 1986) (a case 
which we find to be similar in many respects to that presented by West Allis). "
1346,8," Factual disputes exist, for example, as to the size of the ""relevant market"" and extent of the parties' ""market share"" (facts which 
go to whether St. Luke's is capable of monopolizing trade under 15 U.S.C. ยง 2); and as to whether St. Luke's and Good 
Samaritan, both owned by the same parent corporation, are capable of conspiring to restrain trade in violation of 15 U.S.C. ยง 1."
1346,9," While we do not require that a district court address each of the five factors necessary to support a preliminary injunction in 
every case in which such relief is denied, see Curtis v. Thompson, 840 F.2d 1291, 1297 (7th Cir. 1988), by limiting its analysis to 
a single factor, the district court has seriously restricted the scope of review on appeal -- a result which might have been avoided 
by a more detailed analysis and consideration of each of the factors. "
1356,1," The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, or HHI, is a measure of market concentration. It is calculated by squaring the market share of 
each firm competing in the market and then summing the resulting numbers. For example, for a market consisting of three firms 
with shares of 50, 30, and 20 percent each, the HHI is 3800 (50<2>+30<2>+20<2>=3800). The HHI takes into account the 
relative size distribution of the firms in a market. It approaches zero when a market is served by a large number of firms of 
relatively equal size, and reaches its maximum of 10,000 when a single supplier exists in the market. The HHI increases both as 
the number of firms in the market decreases and as the disparity in size among those firms increases. See Merger Guidelines, 
supra, at para. 4493. "
1358,2," In reaching this conclusion, however, this court expresses no opinion on the merits of the Commission's proposed amendment. "
1370,1," As a result of this market structure, Steelite distributors must sometimes sell"" Steelite products twice. First they must persuade 
the architect or engineer (who will specify which materials must be used on the job) to specify a Steelite product or an ""approved 
equal"" for the roofing or siding. Then, when the job is let for bids, the distributor must persuade the general contractor or its 
subcontractor that he should use a Steelite product and not an ""approved equal"" on the project."
1370,2, This quotation also reflects cost of engineering services provided by Steelite.
1370,3," According to Steelite, CRMC paid its bills late, placed unrealistic production demands on Steelite and generally abused Steelite 
personnel. "
1371,4," In light of Steelite's policy not to provide unit prices once it had quoted engineered prices, Oxhandler represents that it did not 
ask for unit prices on the IBM Job."
1371,5," The IBM Job was also known as the Independent Metals Job, and it appears that the Steelite employee who received the 
CRMC request had not worked on the Oxhandler engineered lump sum price quotation for the IBM Job, and thus did not 
recognize the material requested as material for a job in which Steelite had already quoted an engineered lump sum."
1371,6," Defendant Chris Anderson Erecting Co. was voluntarily dismissed by CRMC per Stipulation and Order dated August 8, 1985. "
1372,7," Accordingly, in Equimark Commercial Finance Co. v. C.I.T.  Financial Services Corp., 812 F.2d 141 (3d Cir. 1987), the Third 
Circuit noted: HN5[
] At the summary judgment stage, a 'judge's function is not himself to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of 
the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.' . . . However, if the evidence is 'merely colorable' or is 
'not significantly probative,' summary judgment may be granted . . . ."
1372,812," F.2d at 144 (quoting Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 248, 106 S. Ct. at 2511)."
1372,8," Judge Barry also denied plaintiff's cross-motion for summary judgment on Count 1. She held that even if an inference of 
impermissible discrimination had occurred, plaintiff produced no evidence definitively establishing a per se conspiracy between 
defendants Steelite and Oxhandler. Corrosion Resistant Materials, slip op. at 5-6. "
1373,9," In arriving at this conclusion, Judge Barry placed strong emphasis on a series of letters in which defendant Steelite expressed 
concern as to competition between its distributors in the New York metropolitan area. See infra notes 10 and 11 (setting forth 
relevant portions of said letters). "
1374,10," In pertinent part, this letter provides In an effort to minimize competition with other Steelite distributors in your area, the following steps have been taken. Both 
[CRMC] and Long Island Tinsmith Corp. will be required to give Steelite's Inside Sales a job name on all inquiries over 100 
squares. Letter from Steelite to Oxhandler dated June 14, 1983 (Exhibit F to Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment before Judge 
Barry)."
1374,11," CRMC was terminated as of a letter dated September 20, 1983, which provides in pertinent part: Steelite has found that certain of its distributors are competing against each other with increasing frequency on the same 
jobs. This has resulted in confusion in the market place [sic] and a loss of business for Steelite and its distributors. Letter from Steelite to CRMC (Exhibit B to plaintiff's Brief in Opposition to defendant's current Motion for Summary Judgment). "
1375,12," In an attempt to address this deficiency, plaintiff moved to amend the Final Pre-Trial Order by including the following 
paragraph: (W) This agreement between Steelite and Oxhandler to terminate plaintiff included an implied understanding that Oxhandler 
would set its prices at a level satisfactory to Steelite. This motion was denied at oral argument, however, in light of plaintiff's failure to show ""manifest unjustice"".  Ely v. Reading Co., 
424 F.2d 758, 764 (3d Cir. 1970)."
1375,13," In passing, this Court also notes that John Grochowski, CRMC's president, acknowledged that Steelite had never placed any 
price restrictions on CRMC and also that he had no knowledge as to any possible agreement between Steelite and Oxhandler. 
See Exhibit A to McSorley Affidavit dated June 2, 1988. "
1384,1," These distributors and co-defendants are Paul's Distributors, Inc.  (""Paul's""), Dairi Farms, Inc. (""Dairi Farms""), International Ice 
Cream, Inc. (""International""), and B & K Distributors, Inc. (""B & K"")(collectively, the ""New England distributors."")."
1384,2," Haagen-Dazs states that it does not want its product distributed by frozen food or warehouse distributors whose primary stake 
is in products other than ice cream. Affidavit of James E. Richards at 2. It thereby seeks to maintain the focus of the independent 
distributor on the Haagen-Dazs product and thus to secure the greatest amount of freezer space for the product. Id. "
1385,," Apparently, this battle for the limited amount of freezer space is an important element of distributing ice cream in the highly 
competitive frozen food and frozen desserts business. See Affidavit of Michael L.  Baily at 4. Mr. Baily, vice president, sales, of 
Haagen-Dazs, explained: All products that occupy freezer space compete for that space. Ice creams compete against frozen pizza and vegetables. 
Only the winners -- in terms of consumer takeaway -- are awarded adequate shelf space. . . . . . Haagen-Dazs believes the frozen foods distributor has a substantially greater conflict of interest -- if he fights for 
additional space for ice cream, he has to give up space that is occupied by the other frozen foods he sells. Id. at 5-6. Moreover, Haagen-Dazs asserts that it prefers to have its distributors sell only to retail accounts, not to subdistributors, because 
Haagen-Dazs has no contractual or other control over subdistributors. Id. at 9."
1385,3," Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 provides, in relevant part: . . . "
1386,," HN3[
] (c) Motion and Proceedings Thereon. . . . The judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, 
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no 
genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. . . . HN4[
] (e) Form of Affidavits; Further Testimony; Defense Required. Supporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on 
personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall affirmatively that the affiant is 
competent to testify to the matters stated therein. . . . The court may permit affidavits to be supplemented or opposed by 
depositions, answers to interrogatories, or further affidavits.  When a motion for summary judgment is made and supported 
as provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the adverse party's pleading, 
but the adverse party's response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing 
that there is a genuine issue for trial. If the adverse party does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be 
entered against the adverse party."
1386,4," Section 1 provides, in relevant part: HN5[
] Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce 
among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."
1386,15, U.S.C. sec. 1 (1982).
1386,5," Section 4 of the Massachusetts Antitrust Act provides: HN6[
] Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce in the 
commonwealth shall be unlawful. Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 93, sec. 4 (West 1984). This statute is construed in harmony with Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and 
the same principles and analysis under the federal claim apply to this particular state law claim. See Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 
93, sec. 1 (West 1984).  Therefore, Winter Hill's state antitrust claims are subsumed by this discussion of federal antitrust law. "
1387,6," Yet, HN12[
] even where such a ""combination contract or conspiracy"" exists, there is not necessarily a violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act; the complainant must still prove that the manufacturer's policy constitutes an unlawful restraint of trade. See 
2 Kinter Federal Antitrust Law sec. 10.20 at 133."
1387,7," The Court notes that HN13[
] there is a distinction between a non-simple unilateral refusal to deal and a concerted refusal to 
deal, which is also known as a ""group boycott."" See Horsley, Per Se Illegality and Concerted Refusals to Deal, 13 B.C. Indus. & 
Com. L. Rev. 484 (1972). A concerted refusal to deal is defined as ""an agreement by two or more persons not to do business "
1388,," with other individuals, or to do business with them only on specified terms."" Note, Concerted Refusals to Deal Under the Federal 
Antitrust Laws, 71 Harv. L. Rev. 1531 (1958). Although direct evidence of an explicit agreement that restricts dealing with a third 
party is not necessary for finding ""concerted action,"" this Court cannot find sufficient evidence of a ""boycott"" in this particular 
case."
1388,8," This Court, therefore, need not address the issue of whether there exists a ""contract, combination or conspiracy"" between 
Haagen-Dazs and the New England distributors in the present case. If, however, this Court were to decide this issue, there must be ""something more than evidence of complaints [from the 
nonterminated distributors] . . . there must be evidence that tends to exclude the possibility that the manufacturers and 
nonterminated distributors were acting independently."" Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Serv. Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 764, 104 S. Ct. 
1464, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775 (1984); see Bruce Drug, Inc.  v. Hollister, Inc., 688 F.2d 853, 856-57 (1st Cir. 1982). ""The antitrust 
plaintiff should present direct or circumstantial evidence that reasonably tends to prove that the manufacturer and others 'had a 
conscious commitment to a common scheme designed to achieve an unlawful objective.'"" 465 U.S. at 764 (quoting Edward J. 
Sweeney & Sons, Inc. v. Texaco, Inc., 637 F.2d 105, 111 [3d Cir. 1980], cert. denied, 451 U.S. 911, 68 L. Ed. 2d 300, 101 S. Ct. 
1981 [1981]). Moreover, the plaintiff must present evidence ""both that the distributor communicated its acquiescence or 
agreement, and that this was sought by the manufacturer."" Id. at 764 n.9.  Furthermore, the finding that an unlawful conspiracy 
exists cannot be supported by the mere fact that the court determines that the business reasons for certain trade practices are 
pretextual. See Bruce Drug, 688 F.2d at 857. Applying these evidentiary standards to the case at bar, it does not appear that 
Winter Hill has presented sufficient evidence to support the finding of a conspiracy; the Court, however, does not rule on this 
particular issue."
1388,9," Winter Hill concedes that this case is governed by the ""Rule of Reason,"" not the per se rules of antitrust illegality. See Winter 
Hill's Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment at 14 (hereinafter, ""Winter Hill's Memorandum 
in Opposition to Summary Judgment""). HN16[
] Since Winter Hill does not allege any ""agreements or practices which because 
of their pernicious effect on competition and lack of any redeeming virtue are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and 
therefore illegal without elaborate inquiry as to the precise harm they have caused or the business excuse for their use,"" 
Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5, 78 S. Ct. 514, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1958), the per se rules do not apply. See 
Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 49-50, 97 S. Ct. 2549, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568 (1977). "
1389,10," The Continental T.V. Court further noted that market efficiency is not the only permissible reason for a manufacturer to 
exercise control over the sales and servicing of a product.  433 U.S. at 55 n.23. ""As a result of statutory and common-law 
developments, society increasingly demands that manufacturers assume direct responsibility for the safety and quality of their 
products. . . . The legitimacy of these concerns has been recognized in cases involving vertical restrictions."" Id. In the present 
case, Haagen-Dazs asserts that ""ice cream requires more careful handling than other frozen foods. Because ice cream is 
perishable and sensitive to changes in temperatures, distribution involves a risk that the product may be mistreated."" Affidavit of 
Michael L. Baily at 7. The Court thus acknowledges that the quality and safety of the product constitute a basis for vertical non-
price restrictions. "
1390,11," For the purposes of this opinion, super premium ice cream is defined as that ice cream containing all natural ingredients, with 
a higher butterfat and a lower air content than other ice creams. See Declaration of Jerry A. Hausman at 4; Affidavit of Harold R. 
Rudnick in Opposition to the Motion by the Pillsbury Company and the Haagen-Dazs Company, Inc. for Summary Judgment at 3 
(hereinafter, ""Rudnick Aff. II""). Furthermore, the super premium ice cream is sold only in pints and for prices which are higher 
than other ice creams. See Rudnick Aff. II at 3. In the New England area, the super premium ice cream market includes the 
following brands of ice cream: Haagen-Dazs, Frusen Gladje, Ben & Jerry's, and Steve's."
1390,12," As a preliminary matter, the Court does not decide the issue whether there in fact exists a separate market for super premium 
ice cream; rather, it assumes arguendo that such a market does exist. If the Court were to decide this issue, the evidentiary burden falls on the plaintiff Winter Hill to establish a well-defined relevant 
market upon which anticompetitive actions had a substantial impact. See Kartell v. Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Inc., 582 F. 
Supp. 734, 742 (D. Mass. 1984), reversed and vacated in part on other grounds, 749 F.2d 922 (1st Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 471 
U.S. 1029, 85 L. Ed. 2d 322, 105 S. Ct. 2040 (1985). To demonstrate the separate existence of a super premium ice cream 
submarket, Winter Hill must prove those submarket elements such as ""industry or public recognition of the submarket as a 
separate economic entity, the product's peculiar characteristics and uses, unique production facilities, distinct customers, distinct 
prices, sensitivity to price changes, and specialized vendors."" Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 325, 82 S. Ct. 
1502, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1962) (footnote omitted).  Given these requisite factors for determining the existence of a submarket, this 
Court concludes that the two affidavits of Harold Rudnick would be insufficient to establish a distinct market for super premium 
ice cream. Moreover, in similar litigation filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Judge 
Legge ruled that ""all grades of ice cream compete for both retail shelf space and for consumers' attention,"" and there is not, 
therefore, a separate market for super premium ice cream. In re Super Premium Ice Cream Distribution Antitrust Litigation, 691 
F. Supp. 1262, 1268 (N.D. Cal. June 23, 1988). The Court, however, does not decide this issue."
1390,13," Harold Rudnick, president of Winter Hill, asserts that the market shares of the super premium ice creams in New England from 
December, 1986 through November, 1987 are the following: Haagen-Dazs - 43%, Ben & Jerry's - 41%, Frusen Gladje - 8%, and 
Steve's - 8%.  Rudnick Aff. II at 10.  Haagen-Dazs, however, notes that in the October - November, 1987 reporting period, 
Haagen-Dazs' market share was only 39%, while Ben & Jerry's was 45%. Declaration of Jerry A. Hausman at 10. "
1391,14," Winter Hill further contends that Haagen-Dazs' market power stems from its ability to raise prices above competitive levels 
without losing customers, and states, ""Haagen-Dazs is the price leader and is usually sold in supermarkets at prices which are 
more than 10 cents per pint above the price of any other super premium ice cream. Special flavors are priced 10 to 15 cents 
higher than that."" Rudnick Aff. II at 9. First, the Court questions Mr. Rudnick's conclusion that Haagen-Dazs is the price leader 
where Winter Hill's October 14, 1987 order guide contains the following suggested retail prices for 16-ounce packages of frozen 
desserts: Howard Johnson -- $ 1.79, Dole -- $ 1.98, Tofutti -- $ 2.79, Haagen-Dazs - $ 1.89, Frusen Gladje - $ 2.08, Mousse 
d'Jour - $ 1.99, and Steve's - $ 2.19.  Affidavit of Michael L. Baily, Exhibit B. Second, and more importantly, this conclusory 
statement of the pricing differentials in the super premium ice cream market, which is not supported by specific factual data, is 
insufficient evidence that Haagen-Dazs is in fact the price leader in the market. Cf.  United States v. Hall, 424 F. Supp. 508, 533-
34 (W. D. Okla. 1975)(holding that a motion requesting a trial judge to disqualify himself and the affidavit in support thereof were 
insufficient in part due to their conclusory nature), aff'd, 536 F.2d 313 (10th Cir.) cert. denied, 429 U.S. 919 97 S. Ct. 313, 50 L. 
2d 285 (1976). "
1399,1," In Count I of the complaint, AMI charges IBM with violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 1; in Count II, with a 
violation of Section 2, 15 U.S.C. ยง 2; in Count III, with unfair competition; and in Count IV, with tortious interference with business 
relationships and prospective business relationships. At trial, AMI dismissed with prejudice Count III of its complaint. AMI, 
Opening Statement, Tr. at 3."
1399,2," In its first counterclaim, IBM charges AMI with breach of contract; in the second counterclaim, with tortious interference with the 
performance of contracts; and in the third, fourth, and fifth counterclaims, with copyright infringement."
1399,3," Section 1 of the Sherman Act states: ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of 
trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. . . ."" 15 U.S.C. ยง 1."
1399,4," AMI's Section 1 claim contains a third part, based on IBM's alleged interference with AMI's ability to acquire parts from 
independent firms, see Complaint, para. 28(b), but the parties agreed not to raise this issue at the initial trial."
1399,5," This case was initially assigned to the Honorable Clarence C.  Newcomer, U.S. District Court Judge for the Eastern District of 
Pennsylvania. It was reassigned to me on January 28, 1987. Trial began on February 3, 1987. "
1400,6," IBM decided to apply net pricing to the 308X line of computers in 1980. The first 308X computer (the 3081D) was announced in 
November of 1980. DX 1799. However, IBM also had a net pricing policy with respect to the earlier line of 303X computers; 
many, perhaps all, 303X MIPS upgrades were net priced. See A.P.F. at para. 118; Allen, Tr. 286-288. Net pricing was first 
implemented in the late 1960's. Ritchie, Tr. 1078. AMI challenges net pricing only as it applies to the 308X line of computers."
1400,7," Computer manufacturers other than IBM generally quote a single price for the parts and labor included in upgrades. See 
English, Tr. 1566-67 (Burroughs); Ramsburg Dep. Tr. 6-7 (Control Data Corporation); Nielson Dep.  Tr. 7 (NCR); Ikezoye, Dep. 
Tr. 6-7 (Hewlett Packard); Gibbs, Dep. Tr. 5-6 (Prime Computer); Edstrom, Dep. Tr. 4-5 (Amdahl Corporation); see also 
MacNaughton Study, DX 1634, pp. 1-3. AMI ""often"" or ""usually"" charges its customers a single price for parts and labor when it 
installs an upgrade or feature for its customers. See, e.g., Lewis, Tr. 492, 502, 1735; Smith, Tr. 613-14; Loria, Tr. 676. UCS 
(Ultimate Computer Services), one of AMI's principal competitors, ""normally"" also charged a single price for an installed upgrade 
or feature. LaRocca, Tr. 1164-65."
1400,8," TCMs (Thermal Conductor Modules) will be discussed in greater detail below. See infra pp. 278-280, 283. Here I note only that 
the recovery of TCMs from 308X computers being upgraded was a major reason for implementing the net pricing policy. E.g., 
Armstrong, Tr. 902."

1400,11," It is unclear what ""SWRPQ"" stands for. As Mr. Gibson of IBM stated, ""don't ask me what an SWRPQ means, it really doesn't 
mean anything. But it is simply the MES or an RPQ for that matter priced without IBM labor . . . ."" PX 377 at 89707. "
1401,12," In its complaint, AMI defined the tying product as the parts needed to upgrade IBM large scale main frame computers, and the 
tied product as IBM installation service. Complaint, at para. 28(a). During the course of litigation, AMI also defined the tied 
product as the engineering labor necessary to reconfigure IBM large scale main frames, see Plaintiff's Proposed Findings of Fact 
and Conclusions of Law (hereinafter ""A.P.F."") at para. 151, or the engineering services necessary to perform net priced 
reconfigurations of IBM's large scale main frame computers. See Plaintiff's Post-Trial Memorandum of Law (hereinafter ""A.M."") 
at 44. IBM's net pricing applies only to certain upgrades sold new by IBM.  Reconfiguration activities include services as to which IBM's 
net pricing policy does not apply (e.g., upgrades with used parts, removals and reinstallations of customer-owned parts or 
upgrades, cycle conversions and refurbishments). See, e.g., PX 105, p. 76525; Levin, Tr. 64; Gibson, Dep.  Tr. 35-36. When 
used by AMI to refer to the tied product, the term reconfiguration must mean only those activities to which net pricing applies."
1401,13," ""The rationale for per se rules in part is to avoid a burdensome inquiry into actual market conditions in situations where the 
likelihood of anticompetitive conduct is so great as to render unjustified the costs of determining whether the particular case at 
bar involves anticompetitive conduct."" Hyde, 466 U.S. at 15 n.25 (citations omitted). However, the per se doctrine in tying cases 
has always required an elaborate economic analysis. See id. at 34 (O'Connor, J., concurring). ""There is often no bright line 
separating per se from Rule of Reason analysis. Per se rules may require considerable inquiry into market conditions before the 
evidence justifies a presumption of anticompetitive conduct."" National Collegiate Athletic Ass'n v. Bd. of Regents of U. of 
Oklahoma, 468 U.S. 85, 104 n.26, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70, 104 S. Ct. 2948 (1984)."
1401,14," Four justices in Hyde, including Chief Justice Burger and Justice Powell, asserted that all tying arrangements should be 
analyzed under the rule of reason. 466 U.S. at 35 (O'Connor, J., concurring). Many scholars agree. See Will v. Comprehensive 
Accounting Corp., 776 F.2d 665, 671 n.2 (7th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1129, 106 S. Ct. 1659, 90 L. Ed. 2d 201 (1986). "
1402,15," Notwithstanding net pricing, buyers could acquire new 308X upgrade parts from IBM, without IBM installation service included, 
on an over the counter (OTC) basis. See, e.g., Levin, Tr. 89-97; PX 455; PX 456; PX 457.  IBM contends that its sale of the 
alleged tying and tied products separately precludes application of the per se rule against tying. Post Trial Oral Argument, 
Chesler, Tr. 69-70; see Northern Pacific, 356 U.S. at 6 n.4. (""Of course, HN4[
] where the buyer is free to take either product 
by itself there is no tying problem even though the seller may also offer the two items as a unit at a single price.""). However, 
even when the products are sold separately, the per se rule may apply if the option is ""not viable."" Advance Business Systems & 
Supply Co. v. SCM Corp., 415 F.2d 55, 62 (4th Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 920, 25 L. Ed. 2d 101, 90 S. Ct. 928 (1970) It appears that IBM's OTC prices for TCMs were not available until late 1983. See PX 609; PX 261; PX 269; Smith, Dep. Tr. 158-
59. Once established, the OTC prices for 308X upgrade parts typically exceeded the sum of IBM's price for the net priced 
upgrade and the value of the parts removed from the upgraded machine. Levin, Tr. 89-97; PX 128A-P. For example, in 1983, a 
308D machine sold for $ 3 million and a 308K sold for $ 3.6 million. A D to K net priced upgrade sold for $ 600,000. PX 455. The 
OTC price for the parts required to perform D to K upgrade was $ 4.58 million. Id. The price structure encouraged buyers to buy 
net-priced upgrades rather than the parts alone for installation by third parties, such as AMI. Although the disparity between the 
OTC parts prices and the prices for net-priced 308X upgrades was not always as great as in the D to K example (especially 
when the value of the parts removed and returned to IBM is taken into account), see PX 456; PX 457; PX 458, and may have 
allowed for third-party installation in special circumstances, the OTC option was not, on the whole, sufficiently viable to preclude 
application of the per se rule. This does not mean that the OTC pricing structure was itself unreasonable or unlawful. See infra, 
pp. 296-297."
1402,16," Despite the language contained in Fortner I, the Court later observed that the treatment of the law on market power in Fortner 
I was in some ways less ""far-reaching"" than in Northern Pacific and United States v. Loew's Inc., 371 U.S. 38, 9 L. Ed. 2d 11, 83 "
1403,," S. Ct. 97 (1962) (copyright), which could be read to make actual market power irrelevant. See United States Steel Corp. v. 
Fortner Enterprises, Inc., 429 U.S. 610, 620 n.13, 51 L. Ed. 2d 80, 97 S. Ct. 861 (1977) (""Fortner II"") (quoting Dam, 1969 
Supreme Court Review, 25-26). Fortner I did not change the requirement of proof of ""market power in the sense of power over 
price."" Id."
1403,17, There is no dispute concerning AMI's definition of the relevant geographic market.
1403,18," Prior to trial, AMI defined large scale mainframe computers as ""electronic data processing systems with a typical systems 
price in excess of $ 1 million"". See AMI's Answers to IBM's Third Set of Interrogatories, No. 2 (Dec. 31, 1986)."
1403,19," The MES sales included in the calculation consist of IBM sales of MIPs upgrades (model upgrades), memory upgrades, 
channel upgrades, and other features. A.P.F. at para. 3, 14. Between 1982 and 1986, IBM's revenues from the sale of 308X 
MIPS upgrades exceeded $ 2 billion. DX 3001B."
1403,20," Although AMI includes IBM MES sales in its calculation of IBM large scale mainframe revenues, it does not appear to include 
non-IBM upgrade sales in the calculation of non-IBM large scale mainframe revenues. If such upgrades are sold by IBM's 
competitors, it is a mistake to exclude the revenues they generate. "
1404,21," The flaws are discussed more fully below. Here I note only that AMI's market share data are limited to new large scale 
mainframe sales, whereas AMI's alleged relevant market is not limited to new large scale mainframes. It consists of new as well 
as used large scale mainframes. IBM's share of sales of new computers only partly reflects IBM's power in a market consisting 
of all largescale mainframes, including those owned by leasing companies and marketed in competition with IBM. "
1405,22," AMI relies on other IBM documents also reflecting competitive situations involving IBM offerings of large scale mainframes or 
upgrades to such computers. Although it is not clear who examined the documents, AMI contends that they yield results 
consistent with Prof. Levin's conclusions based on IBM SWLRs. See A.F. paras. 273-275."
1405,23," With respect to documents in the preceding footnote, AMI acknowledges that IBM's SWLR's reflect a relatively small 
percentage of competitive situations. According to the documents, IBM shipped 83 computers per month, and reported 30 
situations per month. The documents do not establish the number of competitive situations involving IBM which did not result in 
a sale and which were not reported. Nor is it clear that every competitive situation which resulted in a sale was reported."
1405,24," The same is true with respect to the competitive activity AMI asserts is reflected in the numerous IBM documents neither 
sampled nor discussed by Prof. Levin. It appears that large scale mainframes competed with products outside AMI's market 
definition in approximately fifteen percent of all competitive instances in which at least one of the offerings was a large scale 
mainframe. "
1406,25," Prof. Levin acknowledged that ""leasing companies are competitors of IBM when they market IBM manufactured equipment in 
competition with IBM."" Levin, Tr., 764-65; see also id. at 758."
1406,26," Prof. Levin also has measured market shares on a transaction basis, Levin, Tr. 842-45, which appears to be an acceptable 
measurement standard. See DX 1665 p.3."
1406,27," Even if leasing companies were to be excluded from the relevant market definition, so that IBM's market share would not 
decline accordingly, the significant constraints they impose on IBM's market behavior must enter into any proper assessment of 
the significance of IBM's market share. See In re IBM Peripheral EDP Devices Antitrust Litigation, 481 F. Supp. 965, 979 (N.D. 
Cal. 1979), aff'd sub nom.  Transamerica Computer Co. v. IBM Corp., 698 F.2d 1377 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 955, 78 L. 
Ed. 2d 329, 104 S. Ct. 370 (1983). "
1409,28," Prof. Levin acknowledged that box swaps can under certain circumstances be alternatives to upgrades, Levin, Tr. 182, and 
appeared to include box swaps in the relevant market. Levin, Tr. 766. But see Id. at 743-49. AMI excludes box swaps."
1409,29," Including used-part upgrades and service bureaus, and to a lesser extent, box swaps, in the relevant market may raise 
analytical problems similar to those involved in the decision to include leasing companies in the market. See Transamerica, 481 
F. Supp. at 979. As with leasing companies, I find that a meaningful market analysis must take these alternatives into account, 
whether or not they are included in the relevant market definition."
1409,30," Prof. Phillips' figures tend to understate IBM's market share to the extent that he includes competition from maintenance 
companies, which IBM contends belong in the relevant market, I.P.F. at para. 103, and AMI correctly excludes. The figures tend 
to overstate IBM's market share to the extent that, in DX 1749, they fail to reflect revenues from leasing companies. See Phillips, 
Tr. 1597-98. Prof. Phillips offered no opinion concerning the proper definition of the relevant market. Phillips, Tr. 1584, 1594. "
1410,31," Prof. Phillips testified that ""even if a firm had 100 percent of the market today, if there aren't any impediments to entry, that 
would effectively preclude that firm from having market power."" Phillips, Tr. 1577-78. I do not need to evaluate this opinion."
1410,32," I agree with AMI that ""the capacity 'to force' [for purposes of invoking the per se rule against tying] does not require the 
existence of monopoly power in a defined relevant market."" A.M. at 36; see supra, p. 270. The market and industry 
characteristics I examine here are indicia of market power in general, not just monopoly power. See, e.g., Phillips, Tr. 1577-
1600."
1410,33," There is evidence of firms departing the market as well, in part reflecting the rapid technological developments taking place in 
the market: ""As [technology] provides a new opportunity, it usually forecloses an old one."" Phillips, Tr. 1581-82."
1410,34," In terms of IBM list price, Comdisco owns approximately $ 7 billion in IBM equipment. Pontikes, Dep. Tr. 11. Comdisco has a 
larger inventory of 308X computers than it ever had of 303X computers. Id. "
1411,35," The level of employee skill required for a firm to compete successfully is a relevant entry barrier consideration. See 
Transamerica, 481 F. Supp. at 976. According to Mr. Chisholm of AMI, anyone capable of doing ""field-engineering"" type work is 
capable of doing ""installation, discontinuance, upgrades and refurbishment."" Chisholm, Dep. Tr. 44. Mr.  Myland of AMI testified 
that ""anyone with a knowledge a little over basic doorbell circuitry . . . can do feature enhancement, modification, and additions 
on IBM equipment."" Myland, Dep. Tr. 59."
1411,36," A survey conducted on IBM's behalf concluded that the number of companies engaged in ""conversion, upgrade, downgrade 
activity"" grew from 10 in 1970 to nearly 100 in 1985. See Phillips, Tr. 1589."
1411,37," While recognizing the presence of competition in the industry, Burroughs described IBM as the ""dominant competitor"". Id."
1411,38," IBM's research and development expenditures for 1982-1985 totalled $ 15.5 billion and consumed approximately 9 percent of 
IBM's gross income over that period of time. DX 1924. "
1412,39," Prof. Levin asserted that another measure of a firm's market power is its rate of return, measured on a stock market valuation 
basis. Levin, Tr. 860-61. Courts have relied on evidence of a defendant's profit record on the theory that persistent excess profits 
are inconsistent with market competition. See, e.g., duPont, 351 U.S. at 404. The evidence concerning IBM's rate of return on 
stock to stockholders does not warrant the conclusion that IBM possesses market power. Compare DX 1215 (IBM) with DX 1352 
(AMI)."
1412,40," AMI also relies on the fact that large numbers of customers have accepted the tie. See A.M. at 40. This argument requires 
proof that, at least as to an appreciable number of buyers in the relevant market, net pricing imposed an unwanted or 
burdensome condition of sale. See Fortner I, 344 U.S. at 503-04. As AMI acknowledges, the argument also requires evidence 
that ""no factor other than the economic power of the seller explains this acceptance."" A.M. at 35; see Fortner II, 429 U.S. at 618 
n.10; see also Ungar v. Dunkin' Donuts of America, Inc., 531 F.2d 1211, 1225 (3d Cir.) cert. denied, 429 U.S. 823, 50 L. Ed. 2d 
84, 97 S. Ct. 74 (1976) (proof HN13[
] of acceptance of a burdensome or uneconomic offer of a ""tied"" product is some 
evidence of coercion, but such proof alone does not establish, prima facie, the coercion element of a tying claim.) Accepting the 
continued viability of the reasoning in Fortner I, AMI's argument fails for lack of evidentiary support, as is discussed below. See 
infra pp. 291-292."
1412,41," At most, a patent is prima facie evidence of the necessary market power. See Times-Picayune, 345 U.S. at 611 n.30, quoting 
Standard Oil Co.  of Cal. v. United States, 337 U.S. 293, 307, 93 L. Ed. 1371, 69 S. Ct. 1051 (1949). But see Hyde 466 U.S. at 
37 n.7. Countervailing evidence must be considered. "
1413,42," The court in Digidyne also stated that the requisite economic power may be inferred from the tying product's uniqueness, and 
that, therefore, ""it should seldom be necessary in a tie-in sale case [involving a unique product] to embark upon a full-scale 
factual inquiry into the scope of the relevant market for the tying product and into the corollary problem of the seller's percentage 
share in that market."" Id. Digidyne has been criticized on several grounds, see e.g., Data General Corp. v. Digidyne Corp., 473 
U.S. 908, 87 L. Ed. 2d 657, 105 S. Ct. 3534 (White, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari); Will, 776 F.2d at 673 n.4, and I 
decline to follow it."
1413,43," AMI also refers to a submarket consisting of upgrades and modifications of IBM large scale mainframe computers. See A.M. 
at 57, 81. A submarket definition limited to IBM's own product line is untenable. Prof.  Levin denied the existence of such a 
submarket. Levin, Tr. 772-74. Courts have generally rejected market definitions limited to the defendant's products. See, e.g., 
Seidenstein v. National Medical Enterprises Inc., 769 F.2d 1100, 1106 (5th Cir. 1985); Domed Stadium Hotel, Inc. v. Holiday 
Inns, Inc., 732 F.2d 480, 488 (5th Cir. 1984); Edward J. Sweeney & Sons, Inc. v. Texaco, Inc., 637 F.2d 105, 117-18 (3d Cir. 
1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 911, 68 L. Ed. 2d 300, 101 S. Ct. 1981 (1981); Coleman Motor Co. v. Chrysler Corp., 525 F.2d 
1338, 1349 (3d Cir. 1975). Further, the facts of this case do not support a conclusion contrary to the general rule, as my 
discussion of AMI's proffered submarket definition shows. "
1414,44," Prof. Levin failed to recognize a distinction between a market consisting of conversions and upgrades of large scale 
mainframes, and a market comprised of the large scale computers themselves. Levin, Tr. 774-76."
1414,45," In Columbia Metal Culvert Co. v. Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corp., 579 F.2d 20, 28 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 876, 58 
L. Ed. 2d 190, 99 S. Ct. 214 (1978) upon which AMI relies, evidence that price differentials did not significantly impact on 
customer preferences supported the argument that distinct submarkets existed."
1414,46," See also ILC Peripherals v. International Business Machines Corp.  (Memorex I), 448 F. Supp. 228, 233 (""Just as buggy whip 
manufacturers had to face the fact that the invention of the automobile meant the end of their market as they had known it, this "
1415,," new disk storage technology will have a serious impact on the market for customer-removable disk products.  However, the 
antitrust laws were not designed to insure the maintenance of the status quo for any competitor."")"
1415,47," The value of the labor content also exceeded 1.2 percent of the value of the net priced MES with respect to the CX to EX 
upgrade, see DX 3001, but the number of such upgrades performed (2)is insignificant."
1415,48," In July, 1984, during settlement discussions, AMI declined IBM's offer to sell AMI 308X upgrade parts without IBM labor 
included at prices below IBM's net MES prices. Mr. Allen wrote: ""On 3081 quantities ordered on your contract as presented, AMI 
would spend over three million dollars. Our maximum return on this purchase would be $ 65,000. That makes a 1.87 percent 
return on our investment. I am quite confident that no service organization can survive on that profit margin."" DX 2066; see Allen, 
Tr. 374-75. DX 2066 is admissible for impeachment purposes under Fed. R. Evid. 408. See, e.g., Reichenbach v. Smith, 528 
F.2d 1072, 1075 (5th Cir. 1976) (""Rule HN18[
] 408 codifies a trend in case law that permits cross-examination concerning a 
settlement for purpose of impeachment.""); Stainton v. Tarantino, 637 F. Supp. 1051, 1080-82 (E.D. Pa. 1986)."
1415,49," At his deposition, Mr. Allen asserted that he could not state what AMI would regard as an acceptable rate of return on its 
investment in parts. See Allen, Tr. 378-79."
1415,50," Such prices are lower than IBM's net MES prices, against which Mr.  Ross's labor content percentages are calculated. Thus, 
the figures in DX 1805A, Column 7, slightly understate what AMI's rate of return would be if it bought IBM parts at the SWRPQ 
price and installed upgrades at prices charged by IBM for net priced upgrades."
1415,51," I reach this conclusion, and my final decision, without consideration of DX 2069 and AMI's response thereto. However, I note 
that, on October 10, 1985, AMI rejected IBM's settlement offer to sell AMI numerous net priced MESs without IBM labor included 
at prices consistent with Mr. Ross's calculations. See A.P.F. at paras. 310, 312; DX 2069.  Although Fed. R. Evid. 408 limits the "
1416,," admissibility of evidence of settlement discussions, AMI included the fact that it declined IBM's 1985 settlement offer in its 
Proposed Findings of Fact and, thus, may have waived any objection to its admissibility."
1416,52," Prof. Levin acknowledged that, if IBM's labor content figures enable IBM to recover all costs associated with the properly 
defined service component of upgrades, plus a profit, then IBM would be under no obligation to set its prices at a level at which 
AMI could earn a profit.  Levin, Tr. 218-19; see also Baumol, Tr. 1697; Ross, Tr. 1398-99."
1416,53," AMI does not assert that IBM's labor component prices are ""predatory""; i.e., below cost. AMI suggests, however, that IBM 
transfers profits from its sale of the parts required to perform upgrades to its sale of the labor services involved. A.R.M. at 39. 
There is no evidence to support this assertion."
1416,54," The EC (engineering change) level of a machine must be determined before building the upgrade. The EC levels of machines 
may differ even within the same model. See Allen, Tr. 251-52. IBM installs ECs at no charge to the customer. Granito, Tr. 963-
65."
1416,55," Microcode contains programs which support each configuration of a 308X computer and control various computer functions. 
Allen, Tr. 251-52; Zartler, Dep. Tr. 63. In order to reconfigure a 308X computer, it is necessary to modify the machine's 
microcode. See Allen, Tr. 251-53, 267-70.  Such modification may involve the alteration of one to sixty microcode diskettes. Id. 
at 252-53, 268-69. "
1417,56," IBM argues that fabrication work, to the extent not already included in Mr. Ross's figures, is trivial; see IBM's Proposed 
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law at para. 260; however, I do not think that it can be overlooked."
1417,57," IBM's estimates of the labor hours required to upgrade 308X computers are generally the same as AMI's, and in some cases 
exceed AMI's estimates - even though IBM does not include (and AMI does include) the time needed to perform what AMI 
describes as ""IBM test"" and ""Determining Parts"". See DX 1580 (especially, p. 90654); DX 1805; PX 447-58; PX 447-60; PX 447-
62; PX 447-68; see also Chisholm, Dep. Tr. 62-67; cf. DX 1926."
1417,58," AMI contends that this is the ""best method"" to determine the value of the allegedly tied engineering services, A.M. at 44, since 
it reflects customer demand. AMI argues that ""[Mr.] Ross's estimates do not . . .  reflect the value of reconfiguration service in the 
marketplace."" A.R.M. at 32. However, IBM's SWRPQ price for the J to K upgrade, which is based on a $ 165 hourly rate for 
installation labor, is IBM's actual competitive price in the market."
1417,59," At best, AMI has shown that on several occasions it was able to perform the equivalent of IBM 308X MIPs upgrades while 
charging substantially more for its labor services than IBM. However, IBM showed that, based on AMI admissions (.9 rate of 
return and 3 percent inventory costs, see infra), AMI would have had no viable business opportunity even if it would have been 
able to command the higher prices and perform the upgrades. See DX 3000. "
1418,60," Although the focus has been on MIPS upgrades, my analysis applies to all 308X upgrades involving TCM technology. Half of 
all memory upgrades were net priced, but not all of them involved the TCM technology; some used the predecessor MST 
technology."
1418,61," Nor would I require IBM to sell the necessary parts on an OTC basis at an aggregate price lower than the price suggested by 
Mr. Ross's estimates, after adjusting for fabrication."
1418,62," Even if Mr. Ross's figures were increased by 65 percent, AMI would not have a viable business opportunity if only a few of the 
expenses AMI would necessarily incur to perform the work were taken into account. See DX 3001; DX 1927; see also Levin, Tr. 
197-204; Ross, Tr. 1392-96. "
1419,63," AMI suggests that IBM's lower and ""more competitive"" SWRPQ installation labor price of $ 165/hr. was designed to prevent 
third party installation of IBM features bought on an SWRPQ basis. See A.R.M. at 35 n*.  AMI relies on a 1983 memorandum by 
Mr. Gibson in which he states, ""Since third parties see an opportunity here, we should re-examine the SWRPQ price,"" and ""It 
appears the $ 221 effective rate is high and allows enough of an umbrella for a third party to install the MES."" PX 151. The 
memorandum, however, refers to a 303X feature, not a 308X upgrade, see id., and the effective hourly rate was not $ 221/hr, as 
Mr. Gibson assumed, but $ 161/hr. See PX 440 (stating that if the $ 161 hourly rate were to be modified, it should be increased 
to $ 186/hr.). Furthermore, absent proof of below-cost pricing, it would not be unlawful for IBM to ""reexamine"" its prices in order 
to compete more effectively."
1419,64," Additional expenses which AMI would incur include: the increased labor costs required to perform the additional upgrades (this 
amount would be large, see Houghton, Tr. 1453-56; Beckwith, Tr. 1302-03; Baumol, Tr. 1650-51; Ross, Tr. 1396; DX 1776A); 
additional expenses for marketing and inventory management; increased expenses for property, plant, and equipment; 
additional inventory insurance; and added interest expenses. See Houghton, Tr. 1453-56; Baumol, Tr. 1650-55; DX 1925."
1419,65," If AMI took over only a portion of IBM's business, its revenues and expenses would be adjusted accordingly, and the impact 
on AMI's business would be proportionately the same."
1419,66," The only way AMI could engage in the 308X upgrade business profitably, were the needed parts sold without IBM labor, would 
be if customers were willing to pay a substantial premium for AMI's services. The record does not support a finding that such a 
possibility exists. See infra. pp. 290-291."
1419,67," AMI does not appear to contest IBM's assertion, which is supported by the record, that AMI would incur out of pocket travel 
expenses equivalent to $ 1,500 per transaction. See Levin, Tr. 203; PX 379, at 20-21. "
1420,68," If actual IBM prices for 308X labor and net priced MESs are used instead of Mr. Ross's original figures, which applied 1985 
prices for both through the period 1982 to 1986, the average labor content of all MES upgrades would be.8 percent of the 
purchase price of the net priced MES, see DX 3001B; i.e., an amount lower than Mr. Ross's estimate of 1.2 percent, and lower 
than the.9 percent deemed unprofitable by AMI."
1420,69," If actual prices during the 1982-1986 period are used, and the 3 percent inventory cost figure retained, AMI would lose over $ 
48 million."
1420,70," I relied on Prof. Levin's methodology, which made no distinction between the quality of installation and fabrication labor, but 
measured only the additional quantity of labor associated with fabrication work."
1420,71," At trial, AMI counsel acknowledged that if the value of the labor content of 308X upgrades were de minimus, the two products 
would be considered a ""single product"": If that were the case, ""what the customer really wants is the feature. He doesn't care 
about the installation."" AMI Opening Statement, Tr. 10-12. AMI counsel stated that ""$ 2400 out of a much larger cost for the 
feature"" would be de minimus. Id.  That is the case involving the E to B 308X upgrade. See DX 1805A. "
1421,72," In the majority of instances when Comdisco sells an upgrade to an end user, it does not quote a separate price for the 
installation labor involved in the upgrade; it sells the user a ""result that includes both the parts and the labor."" Lewis, Tr. 502-03. 
CMI also generally charges its upgrade customers a single price for the parts and the installation labor.  Smith, Tr. 613-14; see 
also, Loria, Tr. 674-76. CMI's customers generally request a single price for the installed upgrade. Smith, Tr. 614."
1421,73," The ""MES Price(s) Without Labor"" set forth in DX 1805 fail to deduct for installation labor and would have to be reduced 
accordingly."
1421,74," Witnesses from CMI and Comdisco testified that neither company knew that IBM sold upgrades (including the J to K) without 
IBM labor included. See Lewis, Tr. 1721; Loria, Tr. 654-58; 660-61; Smith, Tr. 611-13. I do not credit such testimony, as there 
was documentary evidence (requests for IBM ""SW"" prices) to the contrary. DX 2265 (Smith); DX 2261, DX 2262, DX 2263 
(Loria); DX 2260, DX 2266 (Lewis). Further, the SWRPQ procedure has existed since 1975. DX 2219. SWRPQ prices are 
readily available from IBM. See Ross, Tr. 1371-72; Robertson, Tr. 693-94; Ritchie, Tr. 1114, 1120. AMI acknowledged that 
SWRPQ prices are made available from IBM when specifically requested. A.P.F. at para. 99. "
1422,75," Using customer-owned parts, AMI charged Comdisco between $ 25,000 and $ 30,000 for installing an E to B upgrade, 
requiring approximately 20 man hours. Lewis, Tr. 1723. Based on Mr. Ross's calculations, the value of IBM installation service 
for an E to B upgrade, requiring about 13 man hours of labor, see DX 1926, is $ 2,400. DX 1085A. Based on these facts and Mr. 
Lewis' assertions, it is fair to conclude that Comdisco would not select AMI over IBM to install a new E to B upgrade if it had the 
choice.  In view of this evidence, I do not accept AMI's assertion at closing argument that leasing companies ""don't care whether 
the service costs $ 2400 or $ 20,000."" Post Trial Oral Argument, Levy, at 30."
1422,76," Even if there had been proof of acceptance by buyers of burdensome terms, such proof would be evidence of coercion, but 
would not, alone, ""suffice to establish, prima facie, the coercion element of an illegal tie-in claim."" Ungar, 531 F.2d at 1225. "
1423,77," The $ 23 million figure only approximates the total value of the allegedly tied labor component in part because it excludes 
fabrication labor and includes the value of the labor component of J to K upgrades, which were optionally available on an 
SWRPQ basis."
1423,78," In Fortner I the Court stated that the ""relevant figure is the total volume of sales tied by the sales policy under challenge, not 
the portion of this total accounted for by the particular plaintiff who brings suit."" 394 U.S. at 502. AMI's portion of the foreclosed 
volume of commerce is not at issue here. The Fortner I Court did not consider the situation in which the plaintiff bringing suit has 
failed to show it would or could have engaged in the commercial activity allegedly foreclosed by the tie. "
1424,79," Besides buying net-priced upgrades, buyers wishing to increase their data processing capabilities may: buy replacement or 
additional computers of various sizes and processing power; add input/output devices; select appropriate software; install 
upgrades with used parts; subcontract to computer services and service bureaus; and to a more limited extent, swap machines 
or upgrades. See supra pp. 271-277. "
1425,80," This figure does not include IBM's TCM research and development costs. Granito, Tr. 982."
1425,81," It is worth repeating that IBM requires the return of removed TCMs only when a new net-priced upgrade is bought from and 
installed by IBM.  Over 90 percent of IBM's 308X computers are privately owned; the owners of those computers can do as they 
wish with their TCMs. See DX 1847; PX 25; see also Baumol, Tr. 1692-93."
1425,82," The evidence does not establish the total value of net priced 308X memory upgrades which incorporate only the older MST 
technology, but AMI counsel put the figure in the ""many millions of dollars"" range. A.R.M. at 2. IBM does not dispute AMI's "
1426,," assertion that, in 1984, IBM's revenues from the sale of all net priced memory upgrades exceeded $ 70 million. See A.P.F. at 
para. 79."
1426,83," For example, AMI refers to the fact that the following question was posed to Mr. Armstrong at an IBM presentation in 1982: 
""Should IBM resist third party expansion into labor intensive activities, such as feature/model addition and removal, equipment 
relocation and maintenance?"" PX 119 at 48690; see also PX 275; Gibson, Dep. Tr. 376-77. AMI also introduced an IBM Agenda 
containing ""RECOMMENDATIONS"" for ""ACTIONS ON RECONFIGURATION"" in which the following appears: ""NET PRICED 
MESs INSTALLED BY IBM."" PX 272. The document is undated."
1426,84," For example, AMI does not discuss the serial number designation policy in its post-trial memorandum of law. In its post-trial 
reply memorandum, AMI states that it would have no complaint concerning the serial number requirement if ""parts are available 
from IBM as a viable alternative."" A.R.M. at 35. "
1427,85," Similarly, the net priced upgrade prices were set so as not to impact adversely on IBM's sale of processors. Ross, Tr. 1370-71, 
1375; see also Levin, Tr. 163-64. Upgrade prices equalled the price-differentials of computer models. See DX 1861."
1427,86," I am aware of no decision in which a non-predatory price was found to violate the antitrust laws because it was too high. See, 
e.g., Kartell v. Blue Shield, Inc., 749 F.2d 922, 927 (1st Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1029, 85 L. Ed. 2d 322, 105 S. Ct. 
2040 (1985); Fairdale Farms, Inc.  v. Yankee Milk, Inc., 715 F.2d 30, 32 (2d Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 1043, 79 L. Ed. 2d 
174, 104 S. Ct. 711 (1984). "
1428,87," The IWSC also applied to IBM equipment purchased abroad and installed (or reinstalled) in the U.S. or Puerto Rico. The main 
issue at trial was the legality of the IWSC as it affected exports from the United States."
1428,88," After institution of the IWSC, IBM's standard purchase agreements continued to contain ""essentially . . . the same limited 
warranty."" Ritchie, Tr. 1102; see also, DX 2121, at 3; DX 829, at 1; DX 2124, at 5. "
1429,89," Due to the difficulties of administering the IWSC and the number of customer complaints about the policy, especially from 
leasing companies, IBM discontinued the IWSC as of January 1, 1985. DX 2220, at 16; PX 56, at 1; PX 60; Beckwith, Tr. 1308; 
Ritchie, Tr. 1101; Robertson, Tr. 700.  Although AMI criticizes IBM's post-IWSC policy, it does not assert a claim based upon it."
1429,90," Third party leasing companies, such as Comdisco and CMI, competed with IBM for the placement of large scale mainframe 
computers with end users in foreign markets. PX 71."
1429,91," Large scale mainframes operate on 60 cycle electric power in the U.S., and on 50 cycle electric power in Europe and parts of 
Japan. Lewis, Tr. 459"
1429,92," Although the machines on which AMI requested IWSC quotations were more expensive (in U.S. dollars) to buy in Europe than 
were equivalent machines in the U.S., Allen Tr. 393; Levin, Tr. 228-29, Mr. Allen hoped to be able to sell them at a price 
exceeding the difference because of the relatively short supply of the computers in the U.S. Allen, Tr. 285, 391-92. Mr. Allen 
testified that ""the customers who wanted these machines were willing to pay a premium."" Allen, Tr. 285. "
1430,93," I need not agree with AMI that there existed no viable substitute for IBM service warranty under the IWSC to conclude that 
AMI has standing to test the legality of IBM's policy. The focus of the standing inquiry under Section 4 is not ""whether a business 
practice violates the antitrust laws, but whether a particular plaintiff may recover damages from the effects of the arguably 
unlawful practice on him or her."" Bogus v. American Speech & Hearing Ass'n, 582 F.2d 277, 284 (3d Cir. 1978)."
1430,94," IBM does not contend that granting standing to AMI will create the risk of duplicative recovery involved in Illinois Brick Co. v. 
Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707, 97 S. Ct. 2061 (1977) and Merican, Inc. v. Caterpillar Tractor Co., 713 F.2d 958 (3d Cir. 
1983) cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1024, 79 L. Ed. 2d 682, 104 S. Ct. 1278 (1984). IBM's position is that AMI was an insufficiently 
""direct"" victim of the alleged harm to allow it to recover damages. See I.M. at 43; see also Associated General Contractors, Inc. 
v. California State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 540, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723, 103 S. Ct. 897 (1983). That AMI, as a business "
1431,," engaged in cycle conversions, did not (like the leasing companies) compete with IBM in the placement of computers with end-
users is nondispositive. See, e.g., Bravman v. Bassett Furn. Industries, Inc., 552 F.2d 90, 96 (3d Cir. 1977)."
1431,95," To the extent that AMI contends that IBM's enforcement of the IWSC (by collecting third party IWSC payments) was necessary 
to underscore the seriousness of IBM's IWSC announcement and produce the allegedly desired chilling effect on third party 
shipments, I would regard the argument as too speculative to establish the existence of the necessary contract or combination. "
1432,96," For computers bought in the U.S. and installed abroad, it was impossible to obtain IBM fixed-cost installation and/or 
maintenance service in the first year after the purchase of the machine without paying the IWSC. Levin, Tr. 75-76."
1432,97," Third party installation and/or maintenance services may not have been perfect substitutes for IBM fixed-cost warranty 
services, see Lewis, Tr. 469, but they were a reasonable alternative. "
1434,98," As with IBM's OTC prices for 308X upgrade parts, to the extent that AMI asserts an independent claim on the theory that the 
IWSC price was unlawfully high, such a claim fails under the Sherman Act."
1434,99," At his deposition, Paul J. Rizzo, Vice Chairman of IBM and a member of IBM's Management Committee, stated that he was 
involved in the decision to institute the IWSC, Rizzo, Dep. Tr. 107-108, and that he thought the handwriting on PX 68 was his 
own. Id. at 105-06. At trial, Mr. Rizzo testified that although the handwriting on PX 68 was similar to his handwriting, he was 
positive that he was not the author of PX 68 and could therefore not recall any of the circumstances surrounding the document. 
See Rizzo, Tr. 1195-1199. Mr. Rizzo stated that the document was written by Phillip Guthoff, a member of IBM's Comparable 
Planning Staff, in 1980.  Neither party called Mr. Guthoff as a witness. I find that Mr. Rizzo's trial testimony was credible."
1434,100," As concerns the IWSC, this case is unlike Eiberger v. Sony Corp., 622 F.2d 1068 (2d Cir. 1980), cert. denied sub nom., 
Simplot v. Strobl, 474 U.S. 1006, 88 L. Ed. 2d 459, 106 S. Ct. 527 (1985), upon which AMI relies.  For example, in Eiberger, 
Sonam exacted warranty service payments from its distributors even when no warranty services were provided. The warranty 
fees were designed and operated as penalties to enforce territorial restrictions. There was also an admission by a Sonam official 
that the warranty fees provided a ""good system"" ""to protect our dealer's territory."" Id.  at 1073. "
1447,1," The Physicians and Surgeons Association of Rhode Island and nineteen individual physicians intervened seeking injunctive 
relief and monetary damages against Defendant Blue Cross, a claim dismissed at trial. The Defendant Blue Cross also claimed 
against the Plaintiff-Intervenors alleging that Plaintiff-Intervenors violated Section One of the Sherman Act by conspiring to "
1448,," collectively negotiate with Blue Cross and sought injunctive and declaratory relief. There is no present threat to negotiate; 
therefore, the claim is denied as premature. "
1470,1," Jeanne King, as administratrix of Anna Katz's estate, is involved in a medical malpractice action against the hospital in whose 
emergency room Anna Katz died; James Carroll, as guardian ad litem for his son, has commenced a negligence action against 
the drunk driver who allegedly caused Kevin's permanent, totally disabling injuries; and Denise Hostettler has brought an action 
charging medical malpractice and hospital negligence for the injuries sustained at birth by her son, who is blind, deaf, and totally 
helpless. "
1471,2," Plaintiffs filed their original complaint on June 18, 1986, which I.I.I. answered on August 7, 1986.  Plaintiffs filed their amended 
complaint on September 16, 1986, to which I.I.I. responded by serving the instant motion. "
1472,3," For the legislative history, see especially Note, New York Creates a Private Right of Action To Combat Consumer Fraud: 
Caveat Venditor (48 Brooklyn L Rev 509, 559 [1982] [Caveat Venditor], citing Report of the Committee on New York State 
AntiTrust Law of the AntiTrust Law Section of the New York State Bar Association: A Proposed New State Law Making 
Deceptive Acts or Practices Unlawful, 1968 NYSBA AntiTrust L Symposium 114, 129 [CCH ed]).  Caveat Venditor contains a 
lengthy and detailed analysis of the Act, including all relevant legislative history and a comprehensive analysis of similar and 
identical statutes throughout the United States.  The article points out that because the Act provides no internal guidance with 
respect to the meaning of its terms, and that few cases have been decided interpreting the Act, that interpretive guidance must 
be sought from the Act's legislative history, New York Rules of Construction, and analogous statutes and the case law decided 
under them.  (Caveat Venditor, op. cit., at 519-525.) "
1474,4," If their allegations are deemed true, they either have settled or will settle for amounts less than their actions would otherwise be 
""worth"", or received or anticipate receiving jury verdicts below their cases' ""worth"" as a result of defendants campaign."
1474,5," In Pittsburgh Press Co. v Human Relations Commn. (413 U.S. 376), the court considered an ordinance which generally 
prohibited a newspaper from carrying help wanted ads in gender-designated columns.  The court distinguished purely 
commercial advertisements merely ""[proposing] a commercial transaction"" from advertisements expressing an editorial position 
on matters of social or political concern.  (Supra, at 385.) In making this distinction, the court signaled its shift from the economic 
motivation of the speaker to the content of the speech.  (Supra, at 386-387.) "
1475,6," It is precisely in this political area, as Justice Powell wrote, that ""'the state has a special incentive to repress opposition and 
often wields a more effective power of suppression'"" ( First Natl. Bank of Boston v Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 777, n 11, quoting 
Emerson, Toward a General Theory of the First Amendment, at 9, and citing Meiklejohn, Free Speech and Its Relation to Self-
Government, at 24-26). "
1476,7," The court there ruled on a Public Service Commission ban of advertising promoting the use of electricity, but considered 
whether a different result would occur if the promotional advertising included discussion of environmental concerns or other 
""'questions frequently discussed and debated by our political leaders.'"" ( Central Hudson Gas & Elec. v Public Serv. Commn., 
447 U.S. 557, 563, n 5.) It held that advertising which ""links a product to a current public debate"" does not thereby become 
entitled to constitutional protection afforded noncommercial speech. (Supra, at 563, n 5.) It wrote ""[Advertisers] enjoy the full 
panoply of First Amendment protections for their direct comments on public issues.  There is no reason for providing similar 
constitutional protection when such statements are made only in the context of commercial transactions"" (supra, at 563, n 5)."
1476,8," To be categorized as commercial, speech does not have to refer to a specific brand or manufacturer; ""a trade association may 
make statements about a product without reference to specific brand names"", and this can constitute commercial speech. ( 
Bolger v Young Drug Prods., 463 U.S.  60, 67, n 13, citing National Commn. on Egg Nutrition v Federal Trade Commn., 570 
F2d 157 [7th Cir 1977], cert denied 439 U.S. 821 [1978].) In the latter case the Seventh Circuit upheld regulation of commercials 
promoting the sale of eggs by attempting to defuse fear of health hazards due to their high concentration of cholesterol. "
1477,9," The ""free report"" referred to is a slickly done, nine-page pamphlet with the name and logo of the Insurance Information Institute, 
""A nonprofit action and information center"", at the top of the cover.  Page 1 contains a message from the president of I.I.I. which 
includes the following: ""America's insurance companies are deeply concerned about the lawsuit crisis. The high cost of lawsuits 
leads to higher insurance premiums, which leads to higher taxes, and disruptions to our daily lives and businesses."" "
1478,10," Doctors, CEOs of drug manufacturers, and governmental officials may be among the readers and viewers, but they are 
presumably an extremely small percentage and the ads are obviously not directed to them in their ""consumer"" capacity."
1478,11," For a discussion of recent and pending legislation relating to malpractice rates, see, e.g., Kramer and Moore, Medical 
Malpractice -- Comment on New Legislation, NJLJ, Aug. 1, 1988, at 3, col 1."
1478,12," Voir dire of jurors in civil cases now frequently includes questions directed to this advertising campaign, and a large number of 
potential jurors indicate both that they are aware of and influenced by the advertisements."
1478,13," For example, in March of this year the Attorneys General of seven States, including New York, filed a mammoth antitrust suit 
against numerous insurance companies alleging conspiracy to restrain competition and manipulate the cost of commercial 
general-liability insurance during the so-called ""insurance crisis"" (An Avalanche of Lawsuits Descends on Insurers, Business 
Week, Apr. 11, 1988, at 60).  Rather than spiraling jury awards, as the insurance industry claims, the Attorneys General attribute 
the ""crisis"" to ""boycotts, threats, intimidation, and other coercive conduct"" by the defendants.  (Op. cit., at 61.)"
1478,14," A strong argument can be made the other way, and has indeed been expressed in concurring or dissenting opinions in some 
of the major Supreme Court cases.  Looking to the First Amendment interest which involves maximizing speech and speakers, 
for example, Justice White has pointed out that the sheer market power of some speakers can, in this technologically dominated 
age, effectively monopolize debate to the end of actually decreasing available speech.  Thus, he argues, since corporations are 
the creatures of the state whose special treatment has allowed them to amass ""economic power which may * * * dominate not 
only the economy but also the very heart of our democracy, the electoral process"" their speech should be subject to regulation to 
avoid their ""threatening the role of the First Amendment as a guarantor of a free marketplace of ideas"" (First Natl.  Bank of 
Boston v Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 809-810 [White, J., dissenting]).  One model for regulation of corporate speech which might 
alleviate this problem involves corporate subsidization of alternate viewpoint (see, e.g., Richards, The Jurisprudential Sin of 
Treating Differents Alike: Emergence of Full First Amendment Protection for Corporate Speakers, 17 Mem St U L Rev 173, 177 
[1987]) but the Supreme Court's sharply divided decision in Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v Public Utils. Commn. (475 U.S. 1, reh 
denied 475 U.S. 1133 [1986]) has dashed hopes for any immediate approval of such speech-enhancing regulation. The choices 
about commercial and corporate speech made by the current Supreme Court majority are, however, binding on this and other 
courts, and must be followed here."
1478,15," Indeed, these ""debate-influencing"" advertisements would seem to be precisely the sort the court anticipated as entitled to 
protection in Central Hudson Gas & Elec. v Public Serv. Commn. (447 U.S. 557, 565, n 7)."
1478,16," Other courts which have been confronted with similar insurance industry campaigns have upheld claims of First Amendment 
privilege ( Quinn v Aetna Life & Cas. Co., 616 F2d 38 [2d Cir 1980] [Per Curiam], affg 482 F Supp 22 [ED NY 1979] [dismissing "
1479,," action to enjoin insurance company from running ads claiming that tort claims resulted in excessive jury awards]; but see, Quinn 
v Aetna Life & Cas. Co., 96 Misc 2d 545 [Sup Ct, Queens County 1978] [same parties in State court; court held First 
Amendment would not protect advertisement to the extent it might contain misleading advertising contravening plaintiffs' rights to 
an impartial jury]; cf., Rutledge v Liability Ins. Indus., 487 F Supp 5 [WD La 1979]). "
1483,1," All the subsidiaries were noted to be citizens of Connecticut. See Complaint, paras. 3-6."
1483,2," 15 U.S.C. ยง 1 provides in relevant part: Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the 
several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. Every person who shall make any contract or engage in any 
combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a felony. . . . "
1484,3," 18 U.S.C. ยง 1962(c) provides: It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, 
interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through 
a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt."
1484,4," Although not raised by the district court, the complaint also is defective as to the subsidiaries because Odishelidze states only 
that they are ""citizens"" of Connecticut and does not say where they are incorporated. See 28 U.S.C. ยง 1332(c). "
1485,5," Because of the view we take of the antitrust claim, see text supra, we need not address the district court's intimation, 668 F. 
Supp. at 97 n. 4, concerning the scope of the ""business of insurance"" for McCarran-Ferguson Act purposes. We take no view of 
whether or not that term embraces matters germane to insurer-agent relationships. See Group Life & Health Ins. Co. v. Royal 
Drug Co., 440 U.S. 205, 224-25, 59 L. Ed. 2d 261, 99 S. Ct. 1067 n. 32 (1979) (leaving question open); Thompson v. New York 
Life Ins. Co., 644 F.2d 439, 443 (5th Cir. 1981) (similar). "
1489,1," Crane also filed claims under the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 (otherwise known as the Racketeer Influenced and 
Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO)), 18 U.S.C. ยง 1964, and state law theories of unfair competition, breach of fiduciary duty and "
1490,," trust, misrepresentation, breach of good faith, and promissory estoppel. The district court ruled against Crane on the RICO 
claim, and Crane failed to appeal that ruling to this court. We express no view as to the validity of any of these claims. "
1494,2," This case was vacated by the Supreme Court in light of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corporation, 475 
U.S. 574, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538, 106 S. Ct. 1348 (1986). See Ford Motor Company v. Tunis Brothers Co., Inc., 475 U.S. 1105, 89 L. 
Ed. 2d 909, 106 S. Ct. 1509 (1986). Tunis I was therefore not available to the district court in the instant case as guidance or 
authority in ruling on the 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. In Tunis Brothers Company, Inc. v. Ford Motor Company, 823 F.2d 49 (3rd 
Cir. 1987) (Tunis II), the court held that Matsushita did not require a different result and reaffirmed its original 1985 decision. 
However, we remain unconvinced that either Tunis I or Tunis II requires a per se test to be applied to the facts as alleged in

1504,1," Apparently, Dr. Bolt's existing appointment was not yet due to expire, and he therefore continued to admit patients to DCH for 
some time after the executive committee's decision. Subsequently, however, the executive committee voted to suspend Dr. 
Bolt's privileges for the remainder of the term of his existing appointment."
1504,2," At the time of the decision, Dr. Bolt's existing appointment at OBMH was apparently not yet due to expire. In addition to denying 
reappointment, the executive committee summarily suspended Dr. Bolt's privileges for the remainder of the term of his existing 
appointment."
1504,3, The record does not reveal the precise date.
1504,4," Also named as a defendant was Humana, Inc., DCH's parent corporation. When we refer in this opinion to DCH in its capacity 
as a defendant, we mean both DCH and Humana, Inc."
1504,5," Also named as defendants were Dr. C.R. DeArmas, Jr. and Dr. Thurman Gillespy, Jr. The district court dismissed Drs. 
DeArmas and Gillespy before trial, and Dr. Bolt does not challenge that ruling in this appeal. "
1505,6," The federal antitrust claims were contained in count I of the complaint. Count II contained claims under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 
(1982). Citing several defects in the procedures the defendants used in reaching their decisions to revoke his staff privileges, Dr. 
Bolt alleged in count II that the defendants had deprived him of his fourteenth amendment rights to due process and equal 
protection of the laws. Count III was styled ""federal contractual claims."" In that count, Dr. Bolt alleged that the three hospitals, as participants in the 
federal Medicare program, had a contractual obligation to the United States government to comply with certain federal 
regulations pertaining to peer review procedures. Dr. Bolt alleged that the three hospitals had failed to comply with these 
regulations and had therefore breached their contractual obligation to the United States government, and that he, as a third party 
beneficiary, had suffered an actionable harm. Counts IV through X contained a variety of state law claims. In count IV, Dr. Bolt alleged that when he was first granted 
probationary privileges by the three hospitals, each hospital implicitly promised that his privileges would be terminated according 
to the procedures set out in the hospital's bylaws. Each hospital, Dr. Bolt alleged, had breached that promise, and Dr. Bolt 
requested the court to enter an injunction requiring the hospitals to reinstate his privileges. Count V contained claims for 
interference with prospective economic advantage. Count VI contained claims under Florida antitrust laws. Count VII contained 
claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Count VIII contained a claim for slander, and counts IX and X each 
contained a separate claim for libel. After the parties joined issue, the defendants moved the district court, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56, to enter summary judgment 
on all counts. The court denied summary judgment on the federal antitrust claims and the state law claims. It granted summary 
judgment on the section 1983 claims, but only insofar as those claims pertained to DCH, VCMS, Dr. Boye, Dr. Marino, and Dr. 
Stose. As to those defendants, the court held that the requisite state action was missing. As to the section 1983 claims against 
the remaining defendants -- HHMC, Dr. Smith, and Dr. Roberson -- the court indicated that it would defer ruling on the motion for 
summary judgment, and would sever the claims so that the parties could proceed to trial on the federal antitrust and state law 
claims. The parties thus proceeded to trial. As explained in the text, the district court ordered Dr. Bolt to present his evidence of 
conspiracy first. After he had done so, the defendants moved the district court for directed verdicts on the federal antitrust 
claims, and the court granted the motions. The court thereafter granted the pending motions by HHMC, Dr. Smith, and Dr. 
Roberson for summary judgment on the section 1983 claims. Having thus disposed of all the federal claims, the court dismissed 
the state law claims without prejudice."
1505,7," Dr. Bolt also alleged that the defendants had conspired to engage in a monopoly in violation of 15 U.S.C. ยง 2 (1982). Our 
discussion of the conspiracy aspect of Dr. Bolt's section 1 claims applies equally to the conspiracy aspect of his section 2 claims."
1505,8," Although the complaint alleges a conspiracy involving HHMC and members of it medical staff, and another conspiracy involving 
DCH and members of its medical staff, it does not allege yet another separate conspiracy involving OBMH and members of its 
medical staff. This may be because the OBMH governing board had not taken final action against Dr. Bolt at the time he 
instituted this lawsuit. In any event, the OBMH defendants, OBMH and Dr. Stose, are identified in the complaint only as taking 
part in the larger conspiracy involving all three hospitals, members of their medical staffs, and VCMS."
1505,9, Section 1 provides as follows: 
1506,," HN1[
] Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce 
among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. . . ."
1506,15, U.S.C. ยง 1 (1982). 
1507,10," HHMC raised the state action defense in the district court, but the court deferred ruling on HHMC's motion for summary 
judgment on that point. We address the issue here in keeping with the principle that we may affirm a district court's ruling on a 
ground upon which the district court did not rely. The applicability of the state action exemption is a purely legal question. We 
take judicial notice of the applicable Florida statutes and case law."
1507,11," Of the DCH staff members who participated in the peer review decision, two are named as defendants in this case: Dr. Boye 
and Dr. Marino. In this opinion, we sometimes refer to these defendants and DCH collectively as ""the DCH defendants."" "
1508,12," The state law relevant to our inquiry is that which was in effect when the defendants engaged in the challenged conduct. See 
Tambone v. Memorial Hosp. for McHenry County, Inc., 825 F.2d 1132, 1134-35 (7th Cir. 1987)."
1508,13," HN11[
] It is irrelevant that the state of Florida may have exercised some form of supervision over the kind of procedures 
DCH used in conducting its peer review; the relevant question is whether the state has authority to overturn the privileges 
determination itself. Patrick,     U.S. at    , 108 S. Ct. at 1663. "
1509,14," Fla.Stat. ยง 395.0653(3) (1981) provided that ""HN16[
] the governing body of every hospital shall set standards and 
procedures to be applied by the hospital and its medical staff in considering and acting upon applications for staff membership or 
professional privileges."" HN17[
] The Florida Administrative Code provided that ""the governing authority in fulfilling its 
responsibility shall be organized under approved written bylaws, rules and regulations which shall . . . provide for the 
appointment, reappointment, or dismissal of members of the medical staff, and a procedure for hearing and appeal."" 
Fla.Admin.Code Ann. r. 10D-28.56(1)(f) (1981). "
1510,15," Florida courts have recognized this cause of action for injunctive relief even though Fla.Stat. ยง 395.065(2) (1981) provides that 
""there shall be no liability on the part of, and no cause of action of any nature shall arise against, any hospital . . . for any action 
taken in good faith and without malice [in conducting peer review pursuant to Florida law]."" One Florida court has explained this 
apparent inconsistency in the following way: Section 395.065(2) expressly concerns itself with ""liability,"" which we construe to mean responsibility for damages 
proximately resulting from a tort. We also construe the subsequent phrase in the same subsection, ""cause of action of any 
nature,"" as referring to and limited by the word ""liability."" Were we to construe this subsection as completely eliminating any 
cause of action of any nature against a hospital which gave such inadequate notice of the reasons reappointment was not 
being recommended, but without malice, then any determinative hearing could be held by the hospital with complete 
immunity, notwithstanding the physician's substantial inability to prepare therefor. Similarly, any arbitrary and capricious, but 
not malicious action taken upon an application for reappointment would go totally unanswered. Article I, section 21, Florida 
Constitution, will not tolerate that happening, as it provides: ""The courts shall be open to every person for redress of any 
injury. . . .""  Carida v. Holy Cross Hosp., Inc., 427 So.2d 803, 806 n. 6 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1983)."
1510,16," The standards for reviewing staff privileges decisions are the same for public and private hospitals.  Carida v. Holy Cross 
Hosp., Inc., 427 So.2d 803, 805 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1983); see also Lawler v. Eugene Wuesthoff Memorial Hosp. Ass'n, 497 
So.2d 1261, 1264 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1986)."
1510,17," We are confident that this form of review was available at the time Dr. Bolt's privileges were revoked. We acknowledge that 
some of the Florida cases we have cited were decided after the events in this case occurred. Those cases, however, reinforce or 
elaborate upon the principles stated in the earlier cases; they do not represent departures from prior law. We note that Dr. Bolt 
was obviously aware when he filed his complaint in the district court that the cause of action for injunctive relief was cognizable 
under Florida law. The pendent state claim alleged in count IV of his complaint, see supra note 6, is based on that cause of 
action. "
1511,18," Of those members of the HHMC staff who participated in the peer review decision, two are named as defendants in this case: 
Dr. Smith and Dr. Roberson. In this opinion, we sometimes refer to these defendants and HHMC collectively as ""the HHMC 
defendants."""
1511,19," HHMC is not a private hospital like DCH; rather, it is a ""special district"" created by the Florida legislature. See 1979 Fla.Laws 
577. As such, HHMC may be more akin to a municipality than a private person for purposes of state action exemption analysis. 
In Town of Hallie v. City of Eau Claire, 471 U.S. 34, 105 S. Ct. 1713, 85 L. Ed. 2d 24 (1985), the Supreme Court held that it is 
sufficient for a municipality to establish that it acted pursuant to a clearly articulated state policy; unlike a private person, a 
municipality need not also establish active state supervision. Id. at 46-47, 105 S. Ct. at 1720. Because we conclude that both 
clear articulation and active state supervision are present in this case, we do not decide whether HHMC should be treated as a 
municipality rather than a private person. Cf.  Hospital Dev. & Serv. Corp. v. North Broward Hosp. Dist., 619 F. Supp. 535 
(S.D.Fla. 1985) (Florida special district treated as municipality for purposes of state action exemption analysis). "
1512,20," Additionally, in December 1981, Dr. Boye appeared in proceedings before the HHMC judicial review committee in connection 
with its review of the HHMC executive committee's decision to revoke Dr. Bolt's privileges. Dr. Marino, chief of surgery at DCH, 
also appeared at the proceedings. Dr. Patel, chief of staff at OBMH, testified at the September 10, 1981 meeting of the DCH 
credentials committee."
1512,21," In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), this court adopted as binding precedent all 
decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to October 1, 1981. "
1513,22," A hospital might have a number of legitimate independent business reasons for disciplining a staff physician based on his or 
her misconduct at another hospital. For example, a hospital may, under some circumstances, incur tort liability for its failure to 
screen carefully its professional staff. See, e.g., Elam v. College Park Hosp., 132 Cal.App.3d 332, 340-47, 183 Cal.Rptr. 156, 
161-65 (1982). That a hospital failed to take action against a staff member when it knew or should have known of that member's 
misconduct at another hospital might very well be relevant to this species of liability."
1513,23," Dr. Bolt places unwarranted emphasis on Dr. Marino's use of the word ""plan."" Placed in context, the reference is to a proposed 
course of action at DCH, not to some multi-hospital scheme."
1513,24," It is not clear whether all three executive committees drew up formal lists of charges; if they did, Dr. Bolt did not introduce 
those documents into evidence. He did introduce a letter he received from the HHMC executive committee in which the 
committee cited the two DCH incidents as grounds for its own decision. As to the OBMH executive committee, the evidence 
shows only that it relied on unspecified incidents that occurred at DCH; no evidence was introduced showing that the OBMH 
executive committee relied specifically on the two DCH incidents in question. Nonetheless, we think that the jury could infer from 
the evidence before it that the OBMH executive committee did rely on those incidents; the evidence does show that an 
administrator at OBMH contacted an administrator at DCH and requested information from Dr. Bolt's DCH disciplinary file. Of 
course, the OBMH defendants will have the opportunity to show, on remand, that they did not rely on DCH incidents, or that the 
DCH incidents upon which they did rely did not include the two incidents to which Dr. Woodward's testimony pertains."
1513,25," The first of the two cases involved a patient at DCH named Maribelle Winn. Mrs. Winn died at DCH while under the care of Dr. 
Smith, Dr. Bolt, and Dr. Smith's medical partner, Dr. Ruben. Soon after Mrs. Winn's death, Dr. Bolt telephoned her surviving 
daughters and told them that their mother would not have died but for the negligent care she received from Drs. Smith and "
1514,," Ruben. This action by Dr. Bolt apparently enraged Dr. Smith; in his deposition, Dr. Smith remarked that he could have ""pinned 
[Dr. Bolt's] ass to the front door with [his] fist."" Some time later, Dr. Schildecker, a pathologist at DCH and a member of the DCH executive committee, conducted an 
investigation of the Winn death. Dr. Schildecker's conclusion was that Drs. Smith and Ruben had engaged in no wrongdoing. It 
appeared, therefore, that Dr. Bolt had acted maliciously and unprofessionally when he called the Winn daughters and told them 
that their mother had died because of negligent treatment by Drs. Smith and Ruben. Dr. Bolt's behavior in connection with the 
Winn case was apparently used by the executive committee at each hospital (including the executive committee at HHMC, 
where Dr. Smith was chief of staff) as a ground for revoking Dr. Bolt's privileges. See supra note 24. Dr. Woodward was prepared to testify, based on his review of the Winn medical file, that the treatment Mrs. Winn received from 
Drs. Smith and Ruben was in fact so grossly inadequate as to amount to negligent homicide. From this testimony, a factfinder 
could conclude that the charge leveled against Dr. Bolt in connection with the Winn matter -- that he had acted maliciously and 
unprofessionally when he telephoned the Winn daughters -- was without foundation. The second case involved another DCH patient, one Harold Schmidt. Some time after undergoing abdominal surgery, Mr. 
Schmidt's surgical incision burst open. Alerted to the problem, Dr. Bolt went directly to Mr. Schmidt's room and proceeded to 
pass retention sutures through the wound, without first giving Mr. Schmidt any form of anesthesia. The Schmidt incident, like the 
incident involving the Winn death, was apparently used by all three executive committees as a ground for revoking Dr. Bolt's 
privileges. See supra note 24. Dr. Woodward was prepared to testify, based on his review of the Schmidt medical file, that Dr. 
Bolt's actions were entirely proper in light of the patient's condition."
1514,26," The district court apparently believed moreover that Dr. Bolt was precluded, as a matter of law, from attacking the factual basis 
of any of the grounds upon which the hospitals relied. In the court's view, this would constitute a form of forbidden ""de novo 
review."" We are frankly at a loss as to the legal basis for this particular concern. In its memorandum opinion, the court cited Sosa 
v. Board of Managers of Val Verde Memorial Hosp., 437 F.2d 173 (5th Cir. 1971), as support for its views concerning ""de novo 
review."" Sosa involved a physician who sued the board of a state hospital, claiming that the board had violated the due process 
and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment in denying his application for staff privileges. Reduced to its 
essentials, the case involved two issues: whether the criteria the board used to judge the plaintiff's application was arbitrary and 
capricious, and whether the plaintiff had been afforded procedural due process, i.e., notice and a hearing. In the context of this 
antitrust case, Dr. Bolt is attacking neither the hospitals' procedures nor the substance of the criteria they purported to apply. 
Sosa is plainly inapposite."
1514,27, See supra note 22. 
1515,28," We note that the OBMH governing board has apparently yet to take final action against Dr. Bolt. On remand, evidence that no 
such action has been taken at OBMH would be probative of whether the OBMH defendants participated in the community-wide 
conspiracy. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -EndFootnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - "
1519,1," Plaintiff alleges that the relevant products are travel services and homeowners and automobile insurance and that the relevant 
markets for these products are for persons over the age of fifty. In addition, plaintiff further attempts to limit these markets to 
AARP members. As plaintiff points out, determination of the relevant market, as there can be only one relevant market for each 
product, is a fact-specific question focusing on the cross-elasticity of demand for plaintiff's products and their reasonable 
substitutes. See, e.g., United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778, 86 S. Ct. 1698 (1966). Moreover, plaintiff, 
to show that AARP members comprise a discrete market segment, must show distinguishing characteristics of AARP members 
from the broader population of persons over the age of fifty. Merely defining the relevant market by the readership of the AARP 
publications without further distinction is plainly insufficient and an exercise in circular reasoning; i.e., defining a market merely 
by a publication's readership begs the question of whether that publication is an essential facility. In any event, as this is a fact 
question, this opinion will speak generically in terms of the ""relevant market."" "
1520,2," Case law indicates that satisfaction of the essential facilities doctrine leads to per se liability under section 1, see, e.g., Hecht, 
570 F.2d at 993 n.45, primarily because foreclosure of essential access to a market a fortiorari leads to an anticompetitive effect. 
It is clear, however, that HN3[
] for a section 1 claim, there must be proof of a conspiracy to restrain trade; a unilateral decision to deny access does not violate section 1. This is necessarily so since a monopolist may deal with whomever it pleases provided 
it has no purpose to restrain trade or further its own interests in the relevant market, e.g., Official Airline Guides v. FTC, 630 F.2d 
920, 927 (2d Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 917, 67 L. Ed. 2d 343, 101 S. Ct. 1362 (1981), and even where it has an interest, 
it may establish a business justification for its actions. See Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585, 105 
S. Ct. 2847, 2858, 86 L. Ed. 2d 467 (1985); P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law, para. 736.2f (Supp. 1986). Here, 
plaintiff alleges both a conspiracy among AARP, Olson, and Hartford and that AARP has an interest in the relevant markets by 
virtue of its agreements with Olson and Hartford thus raising per se liability.  Resolution of these questions, however, requires 
further factual development. "
1521,3," Professors Areeda and Hovenkamp have theorized that in a monopoly situation, compulsory dealing, while not favored 
generally, would not ordinarily restrict desirable activities where the integration of two facilities involved a ""no benefit"" integration. 
P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law, para. 1736.(2f) (Supp. 1986). Aptly, they illustrate a ""no benefit"" integration by ""a monopoly newspaper that happens to own one of a town's two department 
stores and that refuses to accept advertising from the rival store . . . . Requiring the newspaper to publish the rival's ads . . . 
would not reduce the incentives of [   ] [the monopolist] with respect to newspapers . . . ."" Id.  at p. 528. In their illustration, it is "
1522,," clear that the refusal to permit advertising by the rival store inhibits competition since there are only two stores in the market and 
the newspaper monopolizes advertising access. "
1526,1," Documents in the record contain references to the Board of Trustees of Cumberland County Hospital System, Inc. and the 
Board of Trustees of Cape Fear Valley Hospital, Inc. It is clear, however, and not disputed, that these Boards are one and the 
same. See App. at 86-89. "
1527,2," In Community Communications Co., Inc. v. City of Boulder, 455 U.S. 40, 70 L. Ed. 2d 810, 102 S. Ct. 835 (1982) and City of 
Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., 435 U.S. 389, 55 L. Ed. 2d 364, 98 S. Ct. 1123 (1978), the Supreme Court narrowed 
the scope of immunity from suit available to local governments under the Parker doctrine."
1527,3," As this issue is dispositive, we do not reach the substantial questions whether the alleged anticompetitive conduct had an effect 
on interstate commerce or whether appellant has adequately alleged a ""conspiracy"" under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 
U.S.C. ยง 1. "
1528,4," The record does not contain sufficient information for us to determine whether SunHealth can be classified as an ""employee"" of 
the Hospital System for purposes of immunity under Section 35 of the LGAA. It may be that, due to the fact that its relationship 
with the Medical Center was through a management contract, SunHealth cannot be classified as an employee. Nevertheless, we 
need not resolve this issue because, as stated above, we find that SunHealth was entitled to immunity from damages under 
Section 36 of the LGAA."
1528,5," These facts also compel the conclusion that Plyler's conduct amounted to ""official action"" within the meaning of Section 36."
1528,6," Appellant's amended complaint explicitly alleges that all the appellees, including the Board of Trustees of the Hospital System, 
participated in the refusal to renew Sandcrest's existing contract and the refusal to allow it to bid for an additional term. App. 51-
53. The affidavit of Dr. Meek, a former member of the Board of Trustees, makes clear that Plyler did not advise the Board that it 
lacked authority to countermand his decision not to renew Sandcrest's contract. He merely stated that ""he saw no need to have 
the Board of Trustees act on that decision."" App. 323-324. In fact, Meek, as a member of the Board, voiced his opposition to 
Plyler's decision not to renew Sandcrest's contract, and resigned. Despite Meek's arguments, the Board acquiesced in Plyler's "
1529,," decision, and it approved and authorized the replacement of Sandcrest. It is clear that the Board had and exercised ultimate 
control over the conduct of Plyler complained of by appellant."
1529,7," The original House version of the LGAA provided immunity for claims based on the ""official conduct of a local government."" 
See, e.g., H.R. 6027, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. ยง 3(a), 130 CONG. REC. H8469-8470 (daily ed. August 6, 1984). ""Official conduct of 
a local government"" was defined as ""any action or inaction of a local government, or its officials, employees or agents, that [they] 
could reasonably have construed to be within the . . . authority of such local government."" Id. at ยง 2(2). The Judiciary Committee 
House Report explains: ""The definition of official conduct allows room for good faith errors by local government officials in 
conducting the public business."" H.R. Rep. No. 965, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 20-21, reprinted in 1984 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. 
News 4602, 4621. "
1530,," Although the term ""official conduct of a local government,"" and its definition, were replaced with the undefined phrase ""official 
capacity"" in the final version of the LGAA, the House legislative history informs our construction of the phrase ""official capacity"" 
by highlighting the concerns of the legislature in drafting the Act. Moreover, the term ""official capacity"" was contained in the 
Senate version of the bill, see, e.g., S. 1578, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. ยง 2(b)(1), 130 CONG. REC. S13574 (daily ed. October 4, 
1984), and the Senate Judiciary Committee Report explains: ""The intent of [this] provision is to insure that local government 
officials performing their normal, lawful functions will not be personally responsible for damages when the local government itself 
is not."" S. Rep. No. 593, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 8 (1984). This definition is broad and consistent with the House legislative history."
1530,8," As with SunHealth, we need not determine whether the individual doctors who made up the ad hoc committee were officials or 
employees of the county because the immunity provided by Section 36 of the LGAA is dispositive. "
1532,9," Although Harlow involved qualified immunity from damages and the LGAA provides absolute immunity when the terms of the 
statute are met, the important point is that a court should strive to resolve the immunity issue as early as possible, with a 
minimum of expense and time to the parties. This is necessary in order to further the purpose underlying the provision of 
immunity. "
