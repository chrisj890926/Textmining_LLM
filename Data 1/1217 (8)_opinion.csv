744,Counsel,"Counsel: ""We're going to engage in discovery.""
None of the Court's or the clerk's contacts with counsel were written or otherwise recorded.
On May 27, 1987, the District Court ordered that the RICO count be dismissed because the one discrete course of 
conduct alleged fails to satisfy the ""continuity""  [**4]  aspect of the ""pattern"" requirement of RICO, 18 U.S.C. §§ 
1961(5), 1962(c); see Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 496 n.14, 87 L. Ed. 2d 346, 105 S. Ct. 3275 
(1985), relying on the reasoning used in the Eighth Circuit that a RICO ""pattern of racketeering"" must occur in 
 [*1282]  more than a single criminal episode or scheme. See Superior Oil Co. v. Fulmer, 785 F.2d 252, 257 (8th 
Cir. 1986); see also Northern Trust Bank/O'Hare N.A. v. Inryco, Inc., 615 F. Supp. 828, 831-34 (N.D. Ill. 1985). The 
Supreme Court has granted certiorari in another Eighth Circuit case premised on the Superior Oil reasoning. See 
1 HN2[
] Section 1441(a) provides:
Any civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction, may be 
removed by . . . the defendants, to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place where 
such action is pending.

the ""pattern"" standard used by the District Court. The motion was denied, and this appeal followed, seeking review 
of the procedural propriety of the District Court's action.

] Under our federal system of dual sovereignty, the subject matter jurisdiction of state courts is governed in 
the first instance by state laws; federal rights are ordinarily enforceable both in federal courts and in state courts. 
See Gulf Offshore Co. v. Mobil Oil Corp., 453 U.S. 473, 478-79, 69 L. Ed. 2d 784, 101 S. Ct. 2870 (1981). HN4[

Normally when Congress creates new civil causes of action by statute concurrent jurisdiction in the state courts is 
presumed, although the first Congress in the Judiciary Act of 1789 committed exclusive jurisdiction of federal 
criminal cases to the federal courts. Judiciary Act of 1789, ch. 20, § 11, 1 Stat. 79, now codified at 18 U.S.C. § 
3231. This presumption in civil cases arises both out of federal recognition of the states' independent sovereignty 
and from the states' duty under the Supremacy Clause to recognize federal law as paramount. Id; see The 
Federalist No. 82 (A. Hamilton). For more detailed discussions of the early development of rules of exclusive and 
concurrent jurisdiction over federal criminal and civil cases in state and federal courts, see H. Friendly, Federal 
Jurisdiction 8-11 (1973); F. Frankfurter & J. Landis, The Business of the Supreme Court [**6]  5-12 (1928); Warren, 
New Light on the History of the Federal Judiciary Act of 1789, 37 Harv. L. Rev. 49 (1923).
The presumption in civil cases may be rebutted, however. HN5[
] Congress may confine jurisdiction of a federal 
claim to the federal courts either explicitly or implicitly ""[1] by an explicit statutory directive, [2] by unmistakable 
implication from legislative history, or [3] by a clear incompatibility between state-court jurisdiction and federal 
interests."" Gulf Offshore, 453 U.S. at 479.
District courts and state courts have about equally divided on the issue of RICO concurrent jurisdiction, and the 
federal courts of appeals have only recently considered the problem. Only the Ninth Circuit, which found jurisdiction 
concurrent in a case from California, has squarely faced the issue. See Lou v. Belzberg, 834 F.2d 730 (9th Cir. 
1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 993, 108 S. Ct. 1302, 99 L. Ed. 2d 512 (1988). The California Supreme Court earlier 
had held jurisdiction concurrent, Cianci v. The Superior Court of Contra Costa County, 40 Cal.3d903, 221 Cal.Rptr. 
575, 710 P.2d 375 (1986). In dicta, the Seventh Circuit has leaned toward concurrent jurisdiction in a case from 
Illinois in County of Cook   [**7]  v. MidCon Corp., 773 F.2d 892, 905 n.4 (7th Cir. 1985), although an Illinois 
intermediate appellate court has held to the contrary, see Thrall Car Mfg. Co. v. Lindquist, 145 Ill. App. 3d 712, 718, 
99 Ill. Dec. 397, 401, 495 N.E.2d 1132, 1136 (1986).
Two other federal courts of appeals have decided that state courts within their circuits were either likely or unlikely 
to assume concurrent jurisdiction as a matter of state law. See Dubroff v. Dubroff 833 F.2d 557, 562 (5th Cir. 1987) 
(Texas likely); Cullen v. Margiotta, 811 F.2d 698, 732 (2d Cir.)(New York courts unlikely, relying on Greenview 
Trading Co. v. Hershman, 108 A.D.2d 468, 489 N.Y.S.2d 502 (1985), which held civil RICO jurisdiction not 
concurrent), cert. denied, 483 U.S. 1021, 107 S. Ct. 3266, 97 L. Ed. 2d 764  [*1283]  (1987). Our Circuit has yet to 
address this issue in a published case. There are no reported Michigan decisions.
HN6[
] The statutory language of civil RICO does not explicitly commit jurisdiction exclusively to the federal courts, 
and it is ""black letter law"" that the ""mere grant of jurisdiction to a federal court does not oust the state courts from 
concurrent jurisdiction."" Gulf Offshore, 457 U.S. at 480.
HN7[
] The civil RICO damage action [**8]  is authorized by 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), which provides that any person 
injured ""by reason of violation"" of criminal RICO § 1962 ""may sue therefor in any appropriate United States district 
court."" It is clear that this language alone does not constitute an ""explicit statutory directive"" for exclusive jurisdiction 
864 F.2d 1280, *1282; 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 17582, **4

 
of the type described in Gulf Offshore. But we must examine other language in the statute to explore the other two 
ways that Congress may have designed RICO as an exclusively federal cause of action.
There is no ""smoking gun"" legislative history in which RICO sponsors indicated an express intention to commit civil 
RICO to the federal courts. Indeed, Professor G. Robert Blakey, now a Notre Dame law professor who as the chief 
of the Senate committee staff was the originator of RICO and its principal draftsman, has conceded that ""'no one 
even thought of the issue' "" but that if members of Congress had, ""'they would have made [jurisdiction] exclusive.'"" 
Lou v. Belzberg, 834 F.2d at 736 & n.4 (quoting Prof. Blakey's remarks reported in Flaherty, Two States Lay Claim 
to RICO, Nat'l L.J., May 7, 1984, at 3, col. 1-2).
Prof. Blakey's speculation is a slender reed, cf [**9]  Blakey & Cessar, Equitable Relief Under Civil RICO:  
Reflections on Religious Technology Center v. Wollersheim: Will Civil RICO Be Effective Only Against White-Collar 
Crime?, 62 Notre Dame L. Rev. 526, 526 n.* (1987), but we believe that there is considerable evidence in the 
legislative history, though short of an express statement, in support of this view and that the legislative sponsors 
should be held to have intended an exclusively federal forum for civil RICO.
Although the drafters of RICO consciously avoided placing the provisions of RICO within the Sherman Act, see 
Sedima, 773 U.S. at 498-99, they equally consciously borrowed the exact language of the Clayton Act in drafting 
the jurisdiction and venue sections for civil RICO, see Sedima, 473 U.S. at 486-88; County of Cook v. MidCon 
Corp., 574 F. Supp. 902, 912 (N.D. Ill. 1983), jurisdictional holding questioned in dicta, 773 F.2d 892, 905 n. 4 (7th 
Cir. 1985).
At the time Congress enacted RICO, section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15 (1964 & Supp. V 1965-69) 
provided that ""[a]ny person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the 
antitrust laws [**10]  may sue therefor in any district court of the United States . . . and shall recover threefold the 
damages by him sustained and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee.""
Civil RICO's jurisdictional section, HN8[
]  18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), provides that ""[a]ny person injured in his business 
or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate United 
States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit, including a 
reasonable attorney's fee.""
The identical language is emphasized. What little nonidentical language exists consists of necessary substitutions, 
simplifications, and trivial inversions: deletion of ""who shall be;"" substitution of ""a violation of section 1962 of this 
chapter"" for ""anything forbidden in the antitrust laws;"" change from ""district court of the United States"" to ""United 
States district court;"" and change from ""by him sustained"" to ""he sustains.""
As noted in Sedima, 473 U.S. at 486-88, borrowing from the Clayton Act concept was suggested by the American 
Bar Association and proposed by Rep. Steiger. The principal House sponsor,  [**11]  Rep. Poff, described the 
treble-damages  [*1284]  provision as ""another example of the antitrust remedy being adapted for use against 
organized criminality."" 116 Cong.Rec.35295 (1970); see also 115 Cong.Rec.6993(1969)(statement of Sen. 
Hruska).
The first noteworthy point here is that the Clayton Act unmistakably provided for exclusively federal jurisdiction. 
There is explicit legislative history that Congress intended exclusivity and rejected a proposal for concurrent 
jurisdiction, see 51 Cong. Rec. 9662-64 (1914), and the Supreme Court repeatedly has held against concurrent 
jurisdiction, see Marrese v. American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 470 U.S. 373, 380-81, 386-87, 84 L. Ed. 
2d 274, 105 S. Ct. 1327 (1985); General Investment Co. v. Lake Shore & M.S. Ry., 260 U.S. 261, 287, 67 L. Ed. 
244, 43 S. Ct. 106 (1922); see also Freeman v. Bee Machinery Co., 319 U.S. 448, 63 S. Ct. 1146, 87 L. Ed. 2d 
1509 (1948); see generally Redish & Muench, Adjudication of Federal Causes of Action in State Court, 75 Mich. L. 
Rev. 311, 316-18 (1976)(hereinafter Adjudication in State Court.)
There is no doubt that the actual intent of Congress in enacting the Clayton Act in 1914 was to follow the precedent 
of earlier lower federal court rulings that the Sherman Act, enacted in [**12]  1890, had called for exclusively federal 
864 F.2d 1280, *1283; 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 17582, **8

 
jurisdiction. See Redish & Muench, Adjudication in State Court, 75 Mich. L. Rev. at 317-18 & n.34; Note, Exclusive 
Jurisdiction of the Federal Courts in Private Civil Actions, 70 Harv. L. Rev. 509, 51O n. 13 (1957)(hereinafter 
Exclusive Jurisdiction). In any event, the Supreme Court later ratified this view of the Sherman Act. See 
Blumenstock Bros. Advertising Agency v. Curtis Publishing Co., 252 U.S. 436, 440, 64 L. Ed. 649, 40 S. Ct. 385 
(1920).
The second point is that there is unmistakably clear evidence that Congress in 1970 closely patterned the civil 
RICO damages action on § 4 of the Clayton Act, which creates exclusively federal jurisdiction. See Agency Holding 
Corp. v. Malley-Duff & Associates, 483 U.S. 143, 107 S. Ct. 2759, 2764-65, 97 L. Ed. 2d 121 (1987)(noting, for 
statute of limitations purposes, ""similarities in purpose and structure between RICO and the Clayton Act"" and ""clear 
legislative intent to pattern RICO's civil enforcement provision on the Clayton Act""); Sedima, 473 U.S. at 489 
(""clearest current"" in RICO legislative history is ""reliance on the Clayton Act model""). Some other courts, noting the 
absence of evidence that RICO sponsors were actually aware [**13]  of the exclusive-jurisdiction feature of the 
Clayton Act, have downplayed this aspect of§ 1964(c). We find it significant because § 1964(c), which parallels § 4 
of the Clayton Act, is, after all, private civil RICO's jurisdictional provision. Compare Lou v. Belzberg, 834 F.2d at 
736-37; County of Cook v. MidCon Corp., 773 F.2d at 905 n.4.
The third way in which the Gulf Offshore presumption may be rebutted is by a ""clear incompatibility between state-
court jurisdiction and federal interests."" RICO is a criminal statute, and, as the Court in Sedima noted, the civil 
portion of the statute derives its meaning from the first two sections which define criminal liability. 473 U.S. at 488-
89. The federal interests embedded in civil RICO are best assessed not by narrow scrutiny of § 1964(c) in isolation 
but by examination of the civil RICO damages remedy in the context of the entire RICO statutory scheme.
The legislative history of RICO indicates clearly that the civil damages remedy of § 1964(c) was designed as an 
integral part of a broad-front attack on organized crime. Like its model, the Clayton Act, civil RICO seeks to enlist 
""the pressure of 'private attorneys [**14]  general' on a serious national problem for which public prosecutorial 
resources are deemed inadequate."" Malley-Duff, 107 S. Ct. at 2764; see Sedima, 473 U.S. at 487 (quoting Rep. 
Steiger that the civil remedy ""would enhance the effectiveness"" of the rest of RICO).
The entire scheme has been well described by the commentators: § 1961 defines key concepts, including predicate 
acts of ""racketeering activity,"" in the language of criminal liability; § 1962 prohibits different  [*1285]  acts; § 1963 
establishes criminal penalties; and § 1964 provides civil remedies on top of the criminal liability. Sections 1965-69 
govern venue and process, and provide specially for expedition of actions, discovery and closure of proceedings 
brought by the United States. See generally Blakey & Gettings, Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations 
(RICO): Basic Concepts -- Criminal and Civil Remedies, 53 Temp. L. Q. 1009 (1980); P. Batista, Civil RICO 
Practice Manual §§ 2.2 - 2.6 (1987).
For three principal reasons, we think that features of the RICO structure are incompatible with concurrent state-
court jurisdiction. First, virtually all of the predicate offenses defined as ""racketeering [**15]  activity"" in § 1961(1) 
are themselves prosecutable only in the federal courts. The only exceptions are those generic offenses described in 
§ 1961(1)(A) that are ""chargeable under State law"" and possibly some ""fraud in the sale of securities,"" § 
1961(1)(C). The remaining predicate offenses are enumerated in a long list of federal criminal offenses including a 
number of highly specialized areas--drug laws, ERISA, labor, bankruptcy, securities, white slavery, mail fraud--
whose adjudication is committed to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts by statute. See 18 U.S.C. § 3231 
(""offenses against the laws of the United States""); 15 U.S.C. § 78aa(1934 Securities Exchange Act violations). The 
state courts do not have jurisdiction to interpret and apply these laws, and they are generally unfamiliar with them. 
The great preponderance of civil RICO cases allege the federal offenses of mail or wire fraud or federal securities 
fraud. See Report of the Ad Hoc Civil RICO Task Force of the ABA Section of Corporation, Banking and Business 
Law 57 (1985)(some 80% of civil RICO claims based solely or primarily on mail, wire, or securities fraud). Two 
courts who have claimed to  [**16]  the contrary that civil RICO usually involves ""garden variety state law fraud"" 
have misconstrued these statistics. See Cianci, 710 F.2d at 380 n.3, and in HMK Corp. v. Walsey, 637 F. Supp. 
710, 717 (E.D. Va. 1986), aff'd, 828 F.2d 1071 (4th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1009, 108 S. Ct. 706, 98 L. 
864 F.2d 1280, *1284; 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 17582, **12

 
Ed. 2d 657 (1988). Not only are most of the predicate offenses exclusively committed to the federal courts, so is 
criminal RICO itself, including the often elusive concepts and definitions embedded in §§ 1961 and 1962.
Second, the frequently interstate character of alleged racketeering enterprises means that often predicate acts by 
the same defendants will occur in several states. See Malley-Duff, 107 S. Ct. at 2766. State-court jurisdiction would 
multiply the risk of inconsistent decisions in state courts in cases brought by different plaintiffs. The state courts 
have no multi-district litigation panel and no way to make their decisions on federal law consistent except through 
review by the Supreme Court. State court jurisdiction over the complex and ambiguous RICO statute would create 
the possibility of conflicting interpretations not only in the 12 regional federal courts of appeals but also in 50 [**17]  
states.
Third, the procedural apparatus created by §§ 1965-68 seems inconsistent with concurrent state court adjudication 
of § 1964(c) claims. Section 1965(a) and (d)'s extended venue and process provisions would be applicable only to 
civil RICO cases brought in federal court, thus creating either a procedural quagmire of multiple state and federal 
remedial procedures or a comity-threatening necessity for many state courts to alter radically their normal 
procedures. In addition, the remedial and procedural sections of civil RICO place great emphasis on the special 
treatment to be accorded to civil actions brought by the United States. These provisions sometimes limit their 
application to ""any district court of the United States,"" see §§ 1965(b)(c); 1966; 1968(g)-(j), but sometimes do not, 
see §§ 1964(b), 1967. Even if the Attorney General wanted to prosecute a civil RICO case in state court, this 
procedural scheme, if it does not commit such cases exclusively to the federal courts, certainly creates enormous 
incentives for the Government to litigate there. We find it difficult to accept that the same statutory scheme which 
explicitly provides extraordinary procedural  [*1286]  vehicles [**18]  in the federal district courts would silently 
contemplate concurrent jurisdiction in state courts, many of which either lack those mechanisms or would require 
considerable revamping to afford them.
In summary, while the statutory language of civil RICO does not say ""exclusive jurisdiction,"" the legislative history 
strongly suggests that this was the implicit legislative purpose. Moreover, consideration of several unique features 
of the RICO definitional and remedial structure demonstrates convincingly that state court jurisdiction would 
obstruct strong federal interests in uniform substantive and procedural enforcement of this integrated statutory 
scheme to control organized crime affecting interstate commerce. Thus the state court from which this case was 
removed lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the RICO claim.
III.
Ordinarily, when a case is removed from a state court which itself lacks subject-matter jurisdiction of the claim that 
served as the basis for removal, the pre-1986 doctrine of ""derivative jurisdiction"" comes into play. HN9[
] That 
judicial doctrine holds that a federal district court derives its jurisdiction from the state court from which an action is 
removed; if the [**19]  state court had no jurisdiction, the federal court acquires none, even if it would have had 
jurisdiction had the action been filed in federal court in the first instance. See Franchise Tax Board v. Construction 
Laborers Vacation Trust, 463 U.S. 1, 24 & nn.26-27, 77 L. Ed. 2d 420, 103 S. Ct. 2841 (1983); Minnesota v. United 
States, 305 U.S. 382, 389, 83 L. Ed. 235, 59 S. Ct. 292 (1939); Lambert Run Coal Co. v. Baltimore & O.R.R., 258 
U.S. 377, 382, 66 L. Ed. 671, 42 S. Ct. 349 (1922).
The doctrine has been much disapproved, see 14A C. Wright, A. Miller & E. Cooper, Federal Practice & Procedure 
§ 3722 at 284-90, and in 1986 Congress overruled it by statute, see 28 U.S.C. § 1441(e). But the 1986 amendment 
was applicable only to ""civil actions"" commenced in state court after June 19, 1986. This action was commenced 
before the effective date of § 1441(e), although the RICO claim was added by amendment after that date. HN10[
] 
The operative date under the statute is the date of the commencement of the ""civil action,"" not the date of the 
added claim. See 28 U.S.C.A. § 1441(e) note (""The amendment . . . shall apply with respect to claims in civil 
actions commenced in State courts on or after . . . June 19, 1986."")
There is, however, an established exception to this [**20]  now repealed problem of removal jurisdiction which we 
must discuss. In Grubbs v. General Electric Credit Corp., 405 U.S. 699, 31 L. Ed. 2d 612, 92 S. Ct. 1344 (1972), the 
Court held that HN11[
] when a case is improperly removed but is tried to judgment on the merits without 
864 F.2d 1280, *1285; 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 17582, **16

 
objection, a party waives his right to later raise the issue of lack of subject-matter jurisdiction at the time of removal. 
""[T]he issue in subsequent proceedings on appeal is not whether the case was properly removed, but whether the 
federal district court would have had original jurisdiction of the case had it been filed in that court."" Id. at 702.
The Grubbs rule is eminently sensible and conservative of judicial economy. It was the approach adopted long ago 
in this Circuit, see Handley-Mack Co. v. Godchaux Sugar Co., 2 F.2d 435, 437 (6th Cir. 1924); Riggs v. Island 
Creek Coal Co., 542 F.2d 339, 343 (6th Cir. 1976), and has been applied recently in a RICO case to which the 
doctrine of derivative jurisdiction might otherwise have applied, see Foval v. First National Bank of Commerce, 841 
F.2d 126, 129 (5th Cir. 1988). See also Sorosky v. Burroughs Corp., 826 F.2d 794, 801 (9th Cir. 1987).
Unlike Grubbs and the precedents [**21]  cited by the Court in Grubbs, however, this action has not been tried ""on 
the merits."" Rather, the District Court dismissed it under F.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) at an early stage, when little or no 
discovery had been done. Courts in the Fourth, Fifth, Ninth and Eleventh Circuits have extended the Grubbs rule to 
cases on appeal following summary judgment. See, e.g., Able v. Upjohn,  [*1287]  Inc., 829 F.2d 1330, 1334 (4th 
Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 963, 108 S. Ct. 1229, 99 L. Ed. 2d 429 (1988); Farina v. Mission Investment 
Trust, 615 F.2d 1068 (5th Cir. 1980); Sorosky v. Burroughs Corp., 826 F.2d 794 (9th Cir. 1987); Stone v. Stone, 
632 F.2d 740, 742 (9th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 453 U.S. 922, 69 L. Ed. 2d 1004, 101 S. Ct. 3158, 101 S. Ct. 3159 
(1981); Borg-Warner Leasing v. Doyle Electric Co., 733 F.2d 833, 835 n.2 (11th Cir. 1984).
It is not appropriate to extend the Grubbs exception so far as to include a case like this, when dismissal has come 
so early in the pleadings stage that there has been minimal investment of the parties' time in discovery or of the 
court's time in judicial proceedings or deliberations. The Grubbs ""waiver"" rule springs from concerns for judicial 
economy and from a desire to prevent a party that bided its time [**22]  before raising a defect in removal 
jurisdiction from getting a second bite at the apple. We think neither concern is significant here, and thus Grubbs is 
inapplicable. Accord, Dyer v. Greif Brothers, Inc., 766 F.2d 398, 401 (9th Cir. 1985)(in case dismissed for failure to 
prosecute and failure to attend pretrial conference, ""concern for judicial economy . . . less compelling"" when 
dismissed ""at an early stage"").
We express no opinion on the propriety of application of the Grubbs exception to cases resolved on summary 
judgment, except to note that summary judgment may involve only limited issues with minimal investment of time or 
may require extensive time and effort exceeding that experienced in many cases ""tried on the merits."" Compare, 
e.g., Foval v. First Nat'l Bank, 841 F.2d 126, 128-29 (5th Cir. 1988)(limited proceedings; Grubbs nevertheless held 
applicable) with Vantine v. Elkhart Brass Mfg. Co., 762 F.2d 511, 518 (7th Cir. 1985)(extensive discovery and 
proceeding; Grubbs held applicable).

The judgment of the District Court is vacated, and the case remanded to the District Court with instructions to 
dismiss the case for want of subject-matter jurisdiction.

Dissent
KRUPANSKY, Circuit Judge, dissenting. 
Because I believe that the majority has incorrectly concluded that jurisdiction over civil RICO cases lies exclusively 
with the federal courts, I must respectfully dissent.
Although the majority's opinion in the case at bar applies the correct standard, namely that the presumption of 
concurrent state court jurisdiction can be overcome if the Congress has confined jurisdiction to the federal courts 
by, inter alia, either ""unmistakable implication from legislative history or by a clear incompatibility between state 
court jurisdiction and federal interests,"" Gulf Offshore Co. v. Mobil Oil Corp., 453 U.S. 473, 478-79, 69 L. Ed. 2d 
864 F.2d 1280, *1286; 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 17582, **20

 
784, 101 S. Ct. 2870 (1981), it has incorrectly applied this standard in the case at bar. Disregarding the precedent 
of the four circuits which have considered this precise issue, 1 the majority has elected, without benefit of 
""unmistakable legislative history"" or ""clear incompatibility"" to override the well-established presumption of 
concurrent jurisdiction.
 [**24]  The legislative history of RICO does not provide the ""unmistakable implication"" that jurisdiction was 
intended to be exclusive. In contrast to the clear support for exclusive jurisdiction found in the Clayton Act's 
legislative history, the majority readily concedes that none of the drafters of RICO ""even thought of the issue"" of 
concurrent jurisdiction. Nonetheless, the majority maintains that since the jurisdiction  [*1288]  clause of RICO 
incorporates language similar to the corresponding Clayton Act clause, jurisdiction over RICO actions, like that over 
the Clayton Act, should be exclusively federal.
Although Congress patterned the civil RICO damages action on Section 4 of the Clayton Act, there is no indication 
that Congress intended to impress civil RICO plaintiffs with all of the requirements for a Clayton Act action. Other 
circuits have uniformly rejected the view that ""RICO should be viewed as an extension of antitrust law in all 
respects."" Bennett v. Berg, 685 F.2d 1053, 1059 (8th Cir. 1981)(Clayton Act requirement of ""competitive injury"" 
should not be extended to the RICO context), aff'd, 710 F.2d 1361 (en banc), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 1008, 104 S. 
Ct. 527, 78 L. Ed. 2d 710 (1983). See also Schact v.  [**25]   Brown, 711 F.2d 1343, 1357-58 (7th Cir.)(the notion 
that the objectives of RICO and the antitrust laws were identical is unsupported by legislative history), cert. denied, 
464 U.S. 1002, 78 L. Ed. 2d 698 (1983). 2
In Sedima S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., Inc., 473 U.S. 479, 485, 498-99, 105 S. Ct. 3275, 87 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1985), the 
Supreme Court specifically cautioned courts against employing analogies to the Clayton Act that limit the scope or 
availability of RICO claims. 3 See also Lou v. Belzberg, 834 F.2d at 737. Congress has mandated that ""[t]he 
provisions of [RICO] shall be liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purposes."" Pub. L. No. 91-452, § 904(a), 
84 Stat. 941, 947 (1970). ""Rejecting an alternative legislative course which would have involved simply amending 
the antitrust laws to provide remedies for competitive harm caused by racketeering infiltration, Congress instead 
enacted RICO as a separate tool in the fight against organized crime."" Schactt, [**26]  711 F.2d at 1357. RICO was 
not intended to be identical to the Clayton Act, but is to be construed more liberally than that act. 4 As the Lou court 
decided, ""this requirement of liberal construction 'strongly counsels us not to read the obstacle of exclusive 
jurisdiction into section 1954(c) on the sole basis of its similarity to Section 4 of the Clayton Act.'"" Id.
 [**27]  The decision in Agency Holding Corp. v. Malley-Duff & Associates, 483 U.S. 143, 107 S. Ct. 2759, 97 L. Ed. 
2d 121 (1987), is of no assistance to the majority. The Court's inquiry in Agency Holding is easily distinguishable 
1 See Brandenburg v. Md. Savings & Loan Depositors Comm., 859 F.2d 1179 (4th Cir. 1988); Crotty v. City of Chicago Heights, 
857 F.2d 1170, 1172 n.6 (7th Cir. 1988)(""We have expressed doubt that federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over RICO 
claims""); Emrich v. Touche-Ross & Co., 846 F.2d 1190 (9th Cir. 1988); Lou v. Belzberg, 834 F.2d 730 (9th Cir. 1987), cert.

2 Cf.  Lane v. Central Bank of Alabama, 756 F.2d 814, 817 (11th Cir. 1985)(even though Bank Holding Co. Act contains treble 
damages provision which was seen as a ""supplement to the antitrust laws,"" state courts were found to have concurrent 
jurisdiction).
3 In Sedima, the RICO defendants argued that ""just as a Clayton Act plaintiff must allege an 'antitrust injury,' so a RICO plaintiff 
must allege a 'racketeering injury,'"" Sedima, 473 U.S. at 485. The Supreme Court rejected this contention, stating that borrowing 
from antitrust principles would ""create [] exactly the problems Congress sought to avoid."" Id. at 498-99.
4 Various statements made on the floor of the Senate support this position. Senator Hruska rejected antitrust standing parallels 
and called for a broad interpretation of RICO. See 115 Cong. Rec. 6992 (1969). Senator McClellan similarly noted ""there is . . . 
no intention here of importing the great complexity of antitrust law enforcement into this field."" Id. at 9567. See also 116 Cong. 
Rec. 607 (1970)(statement of Sen. Byrd).
864 F.2d 1280, *1287; 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 17582, **23

 
from that faced by this court. In a statute of limitations inquiry, whenever the legislative history is silent, the court is 
free to ""borrow"" a limitations period from an ""analogous"" statute such as the Clayton Act. Agency Holding, 107 S. 
Ct. at 2762. However, in contrast to the statute of limitations analysis, in the concurrent jurisdiction setting, courts 
are not free to draw analogies to other statutes unless the legislature has specifically endorsed such action. In the 
event of legislative silence, courts are constrained to enforce the presumption of concurrent jurisdiction and the 
exclusive jurisdiction provisions of the Clayton Act may not be ""borrowed"" for civil RICO. See Lou, 834 F.2d at 737.
In short, while it is appropriate to consult the Clayton Act model in determining the limitations period for civil RICO, 
the pronouncements of Sedima, 473 U.S. at 498-99, instruct that the Clayton Act model may not be borrowed in 
 [*1289]  cases like the one at bar in which such ""borrowing""  [**28]  would unduly limit the availability of RICO 
claims. Accordingly, the legislative history provides no ""unmistakable implication"" that the Congress intended to 
foreclose state court jurisdiction over civil RICO cases.
The majority's alternative argument is that concurrent jurisdiction is precluded because there is a ""clear 
incompatibility between state-court jurisdiction and federal interests."" Gulf Offshore, 473 U.S. at 488-89. The 
majority rationalizes that: (1) most predicate offenses implicit to RICO come within the exclusive jurisdiction of 
federal courts; (2) predicate acts may occur in several different states; and (3) the elaborate venue and process 
provisions of RICO are unique to the federal courts and would militate against concurrent state court jurisdiction. 
These arguments are contrary to existing precedent.
First, the majority's conclusion that most RICO predicate offenses are exclusively federal in nature is misplaced. It 
is true that a number of predicate offenses to RICO prosecutions are identified as mail fraud, securities fraud, or 
other similar types of offenses generally characterized as federal crimes; however, they are generally only 
nominally ""federal.""  [**29]  As one commentator has noted, ""RICO lets civil plaintiffs sue in federal court for treble 
damages based on conduct that historically had been within the exclusive jurisdiction of state courts under common 
law principles of tort or contract law."" Cole & McNamara, 12 Litig. 24, 25 (Spring, 1986) ""If anything, RICO involves 
federal courts in the adjudication of state law claims rather than the other way around."" Lou, 834 F.2d at 738. See 
also United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 586-87, 69 L. Ed. 2d 246, 101 S. Ct. 2524 (1981)(criminal RICO 
moves ""large substantive areas formerly totally within the police power of the State into the Federal realm.""). RICO 
""has become a tool for everyday fraud cases."" Sedima, 105 S. Ct. at 3286 (emphasis added). In Sedima, the court 
found that fully 37% of civil RICO cases prior to 1985 involved ""common law fraud in a commercial or business 
setting."" Sedima, 105 S. Ct. at 3286 n. 16. A more recent study was even more dramatic. The study disclosed that 
54.9% of all RICO cases after Sedima involved ""common law fraud"" and another 13.1% involved either 
""nonsecurities fraud"" or ""theft or conversion."" See 62 Civil RICO Report, No. 44 at 7 (April 14, 1987);  [**30]  Blakey 
& Cessar, Equitable Relief Under Civil RICO: Reflections on Religious Technology Center v. Wollersheim: Will Civil 
RICO Be Effective Only Against White-Collar Crime? 62 Notre Dame L. Rev. 526, 619-22 (1987)(App. B). ""In 1985-
86, 41.4% of all RICO filings contained no grounds for federal jurisdiction other than section 1962."" Note - Clarifying 
a ""Pattern"" Of Confusion: A Multi-Factor Approach to Civil Rico's Pattern Requirement, 86 Mich. L. Rev. 1745, 1771 
(1988). In short, a majority of all RICO cases involve claims similar in nature to state law fraud, theft, or contract 
claims and, accordingly, there is no meaningful support for the majority's position that state courts should be 
considered incompetent to judge such charges. The Supreme Court has recently rejected an argument that RICO 
claims are ""too complex to be subject to arbitration."" Shearson American/Express, Inc. v. McMahon, 482 U.S. 220, 
107 S. Ct. 2332, 2344, 96 L. Ed. 2d 185 (1987). If arbitrators are capable of adjudicating RICO claims, there is no 
reason why state courts cannot hear such claims. 5
 [**31]  The majority next urges that the interstate character of RICO precludes concurrent state jurisdiction and that 
exclusive jurisdiction is necessary to decrease the risk of ""inconsistent decisions.""
5 The Supreme Court's analysis in McMahon is instructive. The court specifically decided that there was no ""irreconcilable 
conflict between arbitration and RICO's underlying purposes."" 107 S. Ct. at 2344. Since no conflict exists between arbitration 
and RICO's purposes, the majority must bear a heavy burden to show why there is such conflict between state court jurisdiction 
and RICO.
864 F.2d 1280, *1288; 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 17582, **27

 
It is, however, well-established that states have the authority to adjudicate  [*1290]  cases ""arising from events in 
other states."" Gulf Offshore, 101 S. Ct. at 2877. The judicial authority of the government looks beyond its own 
locality even ""though the causes of dispute are relative to the laws of the most distant part of the globe."" Id. The 
majority's argument, taken to its ultimate conclusion, would justify the elimination of concurrent jurisdiction in 
virtually all federal cases. Given the strong presumption in favor of concurrent jurisdiction, such an argument is 
untenable.
Neither would the majority's position eliminate the risk of inconsistent decisions. As the Supreme Court has noted, 
""even a finding of exclusive jurisdiction over claims arising under a federal statute usually will not prevent a state 
court from deciding a question collaterally."" Hathorn v. Lovorn, 457 U.S. 255, 102 S. Ct. 2421, 2428-29, 72 L. Ed. 
2d 824 (1982). State courts may, for example, adjudicate federal affirmative defenses to a cause [**32]  of action 
even if they cannot decide the exclusively federal cause of action itself. See generally, Note, Exclusive Jurisdiction 
of the Federal Courts in Private Civil Actions, 70 Marv. L. Rev. 509, 510-511(1957).
For the foregoing reasons, the Supreme Court has specifically rejected the premise that concurrent jurisdiction 
would produce unworkable confiict and inconsistent decisions. Such conflicts are ""not necessarily unhealthy,"" the 
court has reasoned, and are not a significant factor in the exclusive jurisdiction inquiry:
It is implicit in the choice Congress has made that ""diversities and conflicts"" may occur, no less among the courts of 
the eleven federal circuits, than among the courts of the several States, as there evolves in this field of labor 
management relations that body of federal common law of which Lincoln Mills spoke. But this not necessarily 
unhealthy prospect is no more than the usual consequence of the historic acceptance of concurrent state and 
federal jurisdiction over cases arising under federal law. To resolve and accommodate such diversities and conflicts 
is one of the traditional functions of this Court.
Charles Dowd Box Co. v. Courtney, [**33]  368 U.S. 502, 82 S. Ct. 519, 526, 7 L. Ed. 2d 483 (1962).
Similarly, in Hathorn, 102 S. Ct. at 2430 n. 23, the court rejected respondents' claim that concurrent state 
jurisdiction would frustrate federal enforcement of the federal statute in question. The court concluded that 
""[c]ommon notions of collateral estoppel suggest that the state proceedings . . . would not bind other interested 
persons who did not participate in them. . . . Persons dissatisfied with a state court's collateral lateral resolution. . . 
are likely to be able to litigate the issue anew in federal court."" Id. The court thus recognized the possibility that 
federal courts would render decisions inconsistent with state verdicts. Indeed, the court welcomed federal 
intervention to correct state verdicts with which other interested parties were dissatisfied. Accordingly, the court 
found jurisdiction over the Voting Rights Act to be concurrent, notwithstanding the possibility of conflict. Id.
In view of the Supreme Court's unambiguous pronouncements concerning the uniformity issue, it should be clear 
that ""the need for uniformity in the application of federal standards is not alone a sufficient basis on which federal 
courts may determine [**34]  that their jurisdiction is exclusive."" See Nordlicht v. New York Telephone Co., 799 
F.2d 859, 864 (2d Cir. 1986)(deciding that jurisdiction over federal claim involving Communications Act of 1934 was 
concurrent despite the international character of !he claim in question), cert. denied 479 U.S. 1055, 93 L. Ed. 2d 
981, 107 S. Ct. 929 (1987). 6
The majority's final charge that the procedural apparatus, particularly the venue and process service provisions, of 
RICO "" [*1291]  seems inconsistent with concurrent state court adjudication"" is equally misplaced. The majority 
reasons that the act contains so many incentives to litigate in federal court that concurrent jurisdiction would have 
little practical importance and the Congress must have intended federal jurisdiction to be exclusive.
6 The Nordlicht court relied on the Supreme Court's decisions in Pan American Petroleum Corp. v. Superior Court, 366 U.S. 656, 
665-66, 6 L. Ed. 2d 584, 81 S. Ct. 1303 (1961) and Great Northern Railway Co. v. Merchants' Elevator Co., 259 U.S. 285, 290-
91, 66 L. Ed. 943, 42 S. Ct. 477 (1922).
864 F.2d 1280, *1289; 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 17582, **31

 
However, in other contexts, the courts have found jurisdiction to be concurrent even though concurrent jurisdiction 
would be of little practical importance. In the civil rights context, for example,  [**35]  the Supreme Court has held 
that state courts may entertain 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claims 7 even though the drafters of the law probably thought 
concurrent jurisdiction to be ""of little practical importance."" See Nichol, Federalism, State Courts, and Section 1983, 
73 Va. L. Rev. 959, 983 n. 144 (1987); Theis, Res Judicata in Civil Rights Act Cases: An Introduction to the 
Problem, 70 NW.U.L. Rev. 859, 868 (1976).
Nor do the federal venue and service provisions incorporated into the RICO statute afford a persuasive reason to 
support exclusive federal jurisdiction. The Supreme Court has decided that concurrent jurisdiction exists over Labor 
Management Relations Act § 301(a) suits 8 despite the LMRA's procedural requirements, which includes venue and 
process sections like the RICO provisions upon which the majority relies. Most recently, the Supreme Court has 
also decided that concurrent jurisdiction exists over cases to enforce the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1973(c) 9 
despite the fact that 42 U.S.C. § 1973 specifies procedural requirements for actions arising under § 1973(c). 
Additionally, the Eleventh Circuit has  [**36]  found that concurrent jurisdiction exists for actions under the Anti-tying 
Provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act even though that act contains enforcement and venue provisions 
similar to those in the civil RICO statute.  Lane, 756 F.2d at 817.
From my review of the record, herein, none of the majority's proffered rationales persuasively supports the requisite 
""clear incompatibility between state court jurisdiction and federal interests."" Gulf Offshore, 453 U.S. at 478-79. 
Concurrent jurisdiction ""encourage[s] enforcement of RICO and provides an appropriate role for state courts in 
cases involving essentially state law."" Lou, 834 F.2d at 739. Until Congress manifests a contrary intent, ""the 
judiciary should not restrict a statute whose plain language directs a sweeping attack at deeply entrenched 
economic and social ills."" Note, The Conflict Over RICO's Private Treble Damages Action, 70 Cornell L. Rev. 902, 
939 (1985). Accordingly, I would join the Fourth, Fifth, Seventh and Ninth Circuits in their approval of 
concurrent [**37]  state and federal jurisdiction and respectfully enter my dissent to the majority opinion.
