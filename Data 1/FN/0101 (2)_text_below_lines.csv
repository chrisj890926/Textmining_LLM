821,4," Compare holding shown by stipulation (Rec. 572), with holding stated in Exhibit E, to bill. "
822,5," It should be stated that as early as June, 1905, provision was made by the Sunday Creek Company for purchasing certain trust 
certificates representing the beneficial interests in the stock of the other two coal companies which are parties to this cause, and 
this arrangement seems to have been carried out. "
828,6," I will refer to the Hocking Valley Railway Company as ""the Hocking""; to the Toledo & Ohio Central and the Zanesville & 
Western Railroads as ""the Central""; to the Kanawha & Michigan Railway Company as ""the Kanawha""; to the Lake Shore & 
Michigan Southern Railway Company as ""the Lake Shore""; and to the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Company as ""the 
Chesapeake & Ohio"" or ""the C. & O."" "
829,7," I do not overlook the broad complaint that the rates from the Hocking district were too large in proportion to the rates from the 
Kanawha district; but, in fact, all rates were fixed with relation to the Pittsburgh-Ashtabula rate.  This rate was not made by these 
defendants, but it was the ""keystone of the arch."" When the Commission reduced this Pittsburgh rate from 88 to 78 cents, the 
Hocking voluntarily reduced its Hocking-Toledo rate from 85 to 75 cents, and the 75-cent rate has been sustained by the 
Commission.  See Interst. Com. Com'n R., opinion No. 1941, case No. 4274, New Pittsburgh Coal Co. v. Hocking Valley Ry. 
Co., vol. 24, p. 244."
829,8," At one time, the New York Central, the Erie and the Lehigh competed at Buffalo for the east-bound through traffic from the 
Lake Shore, and the Michigan Central, Grand Trunk, and Lake Shore competed for the westbound through traffic from the New 
York Central.  The purchase of the Lake Shore by the New York Central restricted, if it did not end, this competition, for not until 
June, 1910, could joint rates have been compelled, nor, if there had been through joint rates, did the shipper, until that time, 
have the right of relection.  See 36 Stat. at Large, 552, 553.  Formerly, a through joint route could be compelled only as there 
was no existing ""practicable"" through route. And see note 14 as to joint through routes after June, 1910. "
830,9," Without doubt, two parallel roads might join in building, from a common terminus, and owning a new road connecting with and 
continuing both.  Joining in buying an existing extension seems to stand, logically, on the same ground, unless, as matter of fact, 
the purchase was with the dominant purpose of stopping existing or normal competition."
830,10," The actual effect of the (theoretical) rate sustaining interrelationship is minimized by the fact that coal rates go by districts, and 
a change in one district would affect all the others.  (See note 2.) "
831,11," In the same way, when some tendency to maintain high rates is only an incident of the contract under attack, we may well 
remember that the shippers' meritorious grievance on this point is the maintenance of an unreasonable rate, and for that he has 
an effective remedy."
831,12," While each road is content with half the Kanawha traffic, and the Kanawha has the power to equalize, the agreement to divide 
tends to make both Ohio roads careless as to good service.  Now that the shipper has the absolute right of through routing, the 
Kanawha's power to equalize rests solely on its relations to the Sunday Creek mines, which originate a considerable part of the 
tonnage, available as an equalizing medium, so that here, too, the Sunday Creek ownership is the real evil.  With this removed, 
the agreement to divide the Kanawha traffic becomes comparatively ineffective, and the shippers' right of through routing must 
bring the freight solicitors to them in competition."
831,13," There was then (in 1899) no way of compelling the Kanawha to join the Hocking in a through route or joint rate; nor was there, 
indeed, in 1910.  (See note 14.)"
831,14," In March, 1910, the Commission could direct two roads to join in a through rate and route only, ""provided no reasonable or 
satisfactory through route exists."" 34 S.L. 590.  It seems clear that the Kanawha-Central route would have been made and kept 
a ""reasonable and satisfactory through route"" so that the power to compel the Kanawha to join with the Hocking never would 
have arisen.  In June, 1910, this proviso was cut out, but its place was taken by the provision (36 S.L., 552): ""And in establishing 
such through route, the commission shall not require any company, without its consent, to embrace in such route substantially "
832,," less than the entire length of its railroad and of any intermediate railroad operated in conjunction and under a common 
management or control therewith which lies between the termini of such proposed through route, unless to do so would make 
such through route unreasonably long as compared with another practicable through route which could otherwise be 
established."" This is awkwardly expressed, because of the lack of definite antecedent for ""to do so""; but it seems to mean that if 
the condition in 1899 was restored, and if the Hocking demanded from the Kanawha a joint through route, via either Athens or 
the river division, the Kanawha could not be required to comply, because such route would embrace substantially less than the 
entire length of the Kanawha to Corning, and less than the entire route between its termini, the Kanawha district and Toledo, 
over railroads ""operated in conjunction and under a common management and control."" So the Hocking solicitors, in the 
Kanawha district, would have been helpless."
832,15," That this was real, not pretended, is shown by what happened.  In 1909, the first full year before the change, the C. & O. 
delivered to the Kanawha for hauling over its line, 4,000 tons of coal and coke and 70,000 tons of other freight. In 1911, the first 
full year after the change, it so delivered 811,000 tons of coal and coke, and 168,000 tons of other freight. Between the same 
periods, southeasterly bound freight received by the C. & O. from the Kanawha increased from 122,000 tons to 199,000 tons.  
This enormous tonnage given by the C. & O. to the Kanawha was not merely diverted from the other connections of the C. & O., 
because there was no decrease in the tonnage given to these other connections. "
833,16," The Kanawha traffic to be divided was about twenty-five per cent. of the total traffic of the two Ohio roads.  This appears only 
as to the Hocking; I assume a similar ratio on the Central.  I reach this result by taking the figures for 1911 (Ex. 138) and 
excluding the south-bound tonnage from the total of Kanawha and excluding the C. & O. tonnage from total Kanawha and total 
Hocking. "
834,17," Up to July, 1909, the Hocking, Central, and Kanawha cars were pooled and used interchangeably on these roads.  During the 
nine months intermediate the end of this pooling arrangement and May 1, 1910, the date of full effect of the March contracts, the 
Central furnished to the Kanawha an average of 266 cars per month.  During the same months of 1910 and 1911 it so furnished 
an average of 1,466 per month."
834,18," In 1909 the New York Central lines were furnishing 1,600 cars per month to the Central; in 1911, 8,300 cars per month.  Coal 
production at the mines on the Central increased 500,000 tons for 1911 over 1909. "
835,19," Indeed, the entire subject-matter of this numbered paragraph should be disregarded for the same reason.  Paragraph 20 of 
the bill limits the issue to the charge of a continued combination between the Hocking, the Central, the Zanesville and the 
Kanawha.  It is important to know what the C. & O., as owner of the Kanawha, is doing with the Kanawha; but, to the issue 
tendered and made, it is immaterial whether the C. & O. is under disability to become the owner of the Kanawha. "

1019,1," At the former hearing the case was argued by Mr. Solicitor General Davis, Mr. Assistant to the Attorney General Todd and Mr.

1027,1," As bearing upon the power obtained and what the Corporation did we give other citations from Judge Woolley's opinion as 
follows: ""The ore reserves acquired by the corporation at and subsequent to its organization, the relation which such reserves bear to ore 
bodies then existing and subsequently discovered, and their bearing upon the question of monopoly of raw materials, are 
matters which have been discussed in the preceding opinion, and with the reasoning as well as with the conclusion that the 
corporation has not a monopoly of the raw materials of the steel industry, I am in entire accord."" ""Further inquiring whether the corporation inherently possesses monopolistic power attention is next given to its proportion of the 
manufacture and sale of finished iron and steel products of the industry.  Upon This subject there is a great volume of testimony, 
a detailed consideration of which in an opinion would be quite inexcusable.  As a last analysis of this testimony, it is sufficient to 
say it shows that, large as was the corporation, and substantial as was its proportion of the business of the industry, the 
corporation was not able in the first ten years of its history to maintain its position in the increase of trade.  During that period, its 
proportion of the domestic business decreased from 50.1 per cent. to 40.9 per cent. and its increase of business during that 
period was but 40.6 per cent. of its original volume.  Its increase of business, measured by percentage, was exceeded by eight 
of its competitors, whose increase of business, likewise measured by percentage, ranged from 63 to 3779.  This disparity in the 
increase of production indicates that the power of the corporation is not commensurate with its size, and that the size and the 
consequent power of the corporation are not sufficient to retard prosperous growth of efficient competitors. ""from the vast amount of testimony, it is conclusively shown that the Steel Corporation did not attempt to exert a power, if such it 
possessed, to oppress and destory its competitors, and it is likewise disclosed by the history of the industry subsequent to the "
1028,," organization of the corporation that if it had made such an attempt it would have failed.  It is also shown by the testimony that, 
acting independently and relying alone upon its power and wealth, great as they were, the corporation has never been able to 
dominate the steel industry by controlling the supply of raw materials, restraining production of finished products, or enhancing 
and maintaining the prices of either."" "
