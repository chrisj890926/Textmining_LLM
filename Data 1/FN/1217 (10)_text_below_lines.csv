present motions that an appeal of Judge Bell's order is pending."
90,3," As a Cessna Conquest dealer, General was already authorized to perform some services on TPE 331 engines. However, 
without service center status, any parts which General purchased directly from Garrett would be at list price. "
91,4," Other Cessna dealers also sought Garrett service center appointments during the same time frame that General did. None 
were appointed by Garrett from 1981 to 1984. "
92,5," General's own expert has admitted that alleged agreement between Garrett and Cessna was not a price-fixing agreement. He 
stated that the agreement ""allow[ed] Cessna to price independently . . . ."" Affidavit of Peter Max, Paragraph 23 (emphasis 
added). "
93,6," See Davis-Watkins, 686 F.2d at 1201 n. 14: HN10[
] ""A dual distributorship involves a business structure in which one party operates a branch of dealership on the 
same market level as one or more of its customers."" "
94,7," General's admission that the alleged agreement was contrary to Garrett's interests is supported by the conclusions of the 
defendants' expert: Garrett's incentive is to keep distributor margins as small as possible, consistent with its need to maintain viable, efficient 
distributors. To the extent that Garrett's actions increase distributor margins, the price Garrett can charge for its parts at 
wholesale is diminished. Artificially higher distributor margins -- margins raised without some compensating efficiency 
benefits that increase Garrett sales -- are thus directly contrary to Garrett's interest. Hence the complaint fails a basic test 
for antitrust matters: HN13[
] 'If the factual context renders respondents' claim implausible -- if the claim is one that simply 
makes no economic sense -- respondents must come forward with more persuasive evidence to support their claim than 
would otherwise be necessary.' Affidavit of Howard Marvel, Sept. 22, 1989, pp. 12-13 (citing Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 
587, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538, 106 S. Ct. 1348 (1986)). "
95,8," General's expert states that The effect of the agreement was to give Cessna all sales of Garrett TPE 331-8 parts to Cessna Conquest dealers. The 
anticompetitive nature of the agreement was that it eliminated a competitor from the market, protecting Cessna from price 
competition, allowing Cessna to price independently, and increasing Cessna's control of the market. Affidavit of Peter Max, October 30, 1989, Paragraph 23. Mr. Max does not say which ""competitor"" was eliminated, but he 
appears to be referring to the elimination of Garrett as a competitor of Cessna. However, the facts are undisputed that Cessna 
dealers could continue to purchase TPE 331 replacement parts either from Garrett itself or from Cessna even after the two 
entities entered into the alleged agreement. Those Cessna dealers not authorized as Garrett service centers would simply have 
to pay Garrett's list price (which was higher than Cessna's price to its dealers) if they purchased from Garrett."
95,9," The Sixth Circuit has stated that . . . HN15[
] a complaint charging restraint of trade based on a manufacturer's substitution of one distributor for another must allege anticompetitive effect at the interbrand level to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion for failure to state a violation of 
Section 1 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. Crane & Shovel, 854 F.2d at 807. As the defendants' expert points out, the alleged agreement in this case may have even served to increase competition by 
improving service ability; had General been appointed as a Garrett service center, Cessna Conquest owners would have had 
only one authorized service option in Michigan -- General. The appointment of Kal Aero -- which was not affiliated with any 
aircraft manufacturers -- gave Conquest owners an additional authorized option. Marvel Affidavit, page 9. "
96,10," In its response to Garrett's requests for admissions, General admitted that it is ""not pursuing any antitrust claims that will be 
evaluated under the rule of reason."" Plaintiff General Aviation Inc.'s Response to the Garrett Corp.'s Request for Admissions, 
No. 12. Lest there be any doubt regarding the import of this admission, Garrett has alleged that General has refused to respond 
to discovery requests relevant to determining alleged harm to competition, which is required to establish liability on a rule of 
reason claim. Defendant The Garrett Corp.'s Brief in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment at 23."
96,11," HN19[
] Interbrand competition is the ""primary concern of antitrust law."" GTE Sylvania, 433 U.S. at 52. Intrabrand competition is of some concern as well. As one Circuit has stated, inquiries into the scope of competition under section 1 and 
section 2 of the Sherman Act are not precisely the same; stifling intrabrand competition may violate section 1, while obtaining a 
""monopoly"" over a given brand would clearly not run afoul of section 2. Columbia Metal Culvert Co., Inc. v. Kaiser Aluminum & 
Chemical Corp., 579 F.2d 20, 27 n. 11 (3d Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 876, 58 L. Ed. 2d 190, 99 S. Ct. 214 (1978). 
However, General has not set forth facts showing that intrabrand competition was ""stifled"" in any sense of the word, having 
presented no evidence that consumers have any fewer sources available for purchase of Garrett replacement parts."
96,12," HN21[
]  Mich.Comp.Laws Ann. section 445.772 provides as follows: A contract, combination, or conspiracy between 2 or more persons in restraint of, or to monopolize, trade or commerce in a 
relevant market is unlawful. This statute is modelled after the Uniform State Antitrust Act. The comment to the Uniform Act section above states that The adoption of Sherman Act language establishes its general standards of legality, provides needed flexibility, and makes 
available to state courts the relevant body of federal precedent. "
97,13," The Court notes that Mich.Comp.Laws Ann. section 445.772 did not go into effect until March 29, 1985. General's first 
amended complaint alleges that the agreement between the defendants continued until ""at least the spring/summer of 1984."" 
Therefore, on its face, the first amended complaint does not state a violation of section 445.772. Even if General had instead stated a claim for violation of the predecessor to section 445.772 -- the now-repealed section 
445.701 -- the same analysis would apply and summary judgment in favor of the defendants would be in order. Prior to its 
repeal, Michigan courts had held that section 445.702 was likewise patterned after the Sherman Act, and that federal court 
interpretations were persuasive authority as to section 445.701's meaning. Goldman v. Loubella Extendables, 91 Mich. App.

130,4," He also alluded in passing to the plaintiffs' failure to allege in their complaint a combination between the four defendants and 
the City.  This point was not commented upon by the court of appeals. We discuss this issue infra, majority opinion at 154. "
131,5," The court of appeals recognized that the City of Milwaukee had attempted to make sure of the legality of its proposed 
ambulance system by seeking legislation that would specifically validate its anticompetitive ordinance, and that legislation, even 
in a watered-down version, never became law because of a governor's veto.  The court of appeals properly, we conclude, gave 
little weight to this legislation that did not pass even though this bit of legislative history reveals that the City of Milwaukee's legal 
department was worried that the ordinance violated the state's antitrust law. We do not believe, however, that the subjective 
belief of the Milwaukee City Attorney's office in respect to this law is significant.  Nor can we conclude that the failure of the bill to 
pass was because it was the legislative intent to demonstrate that the Milwaukee ambulance ordinance violated antitrust laws. 
We reach this conclusion even though the governor's veto message stated as one reason for vetoing the bill that this law might 
have anticompetitive effects.  We consider this bit of legislative history to be substantially neutral on the question."
131,6," Private ambulance company defendants argued that they were protected by the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, i.e., that there

law.  ( Committee on Children's Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 209-210 [197 Cal.Rptr. 783, 673

155,7," For example, a fellow committee member wrote to Thomas just a week before the January meeting: ""With reference to Point #2 
of your letter of January 7, and as I view sagging domestic loan demand and an anything but ebullient near-term loan forecast, I 
wonder if the pricing section of our agenda could be amplified to include some discussion relating to differential pricing. With so 
many of our higher quality relationships covering what modest short-term requirements they may have in the commercial paper "
156,," market, I think that the industry needs to develop a way in which these borrowers can be brought back to the banking system, 
but at the same time without jeop[a]rdizing the spreads on existing credits that merit higher interest rates. It is a difficult area, but 
I do think our industry needs to develop a more sophisticated approach to the pricing of our credit-related products."" Another letter, from Thomas to CBCP members a month before the April meeting, reads in part: ""[M]y thinking is that we can 
divide the panel into four sections.  As moderator, I thought I might open the session by giving a brief overview of the role of 
commercial bank credit in our economy, perhaps dating back to the end of World War II, but with greater emphasis on the past 
five years.  Reuben Richards has then agreed to talk for seven or eight minutes on current activities in the marketplace, and 
Harry Meily has then agreed to discuss the likely course of commercial bank lending in the future.  Finally, Charlie Pistor will 
discuss the personnel implications of current practices and anticipated developments in commercial bank lending."" At the April panel, Thomas prefaced his remarks as follows: ""Our basic concern today . . . is whether or not there has been a 
fundamental change in demand for commercial loans.  Frankly, we don't know for sure, but we hope that our discussion today 
will shed some light on the issues involved.  We do believe that the answer to that question will have important implications for 
the way we will be doing business in the next several years."" "
157,8," Defendant ABA is a national trade association whose members include over 11,000 commercial banks.  ARCB, founded in 
1912, is an association of individual bankers from commercial banks.  RMA is an association of 3,100 institutions comprised 
mostly of commercial banks but including some savings banks and savings and loan associations."

159,1," In his dissent in Anderson, Justice Brennan contended that the majority, ""while instructing the trial judge to 'consider' 
heightened evidentiary standards, fails to explain what that means.  In other words, how does a judge assess how one-sided 
evidence is, or what a 'fairminded' jury could 'reasonably' decide?"" ( Id., at p. 265 [91 L.Ed.2d at p. 222].) Because the majority 
opinion ""could surely be understood as an invitation -- if not an instruction -- to trial courts to assess and weigh evidence much 
as a juror would"" ( id., at p. 266 [91 L.Ed.2d at p. 223]), Justice Brennan feared it ""may erode the constitutionally enshrined role 
of the jury."" ( Id., at p. 268 [91 L.Ed.2d at p. 224].) Justice Rehnquist who in an opinion joined by Chief Justice Burger also 
dissented in Anderson, claimed that the ""substantive standard"" which the majority decided must be applied by trial courts in 
deciding a motion for summary judgment ""is actually a procedural requirement engrafted onto Rule 56."" ( Id., at pp. 268-269 [91 
L.Ed.2d at p. 225].) ""The Court's decision to engraft the standard of proof applicable to a factfinder onto the law governing the 
procedural motion for a summary judgment (a motion that has always been regarded as raising a question of law rather than a 
question of fact [citation]), will do great mischief with little corresponding benefit."" ( Id., at p. 272 [91 L.Ed.2d at p. 227].)"
159,2," ""Matsushita was the quintessential overblown antitrust case.  The published opinions of the trial court 'would fill an entire 
volume of the Federal Supplement.' By the time the court granted summary judgment for defendants in 1981, the record had 
ballooned so that the 'essence of the evidence' filled forty volumes.  Judge Becker, who ruled much of the evidence inadmissible 
and granted summary judgment, said the 'enormous record . . . may be the largest summary judgment record ever developed.' 
To manage this record he required plaintiffs to file a 'final pretrial statement' detailing every fact they hoped to prove at trial, and 
all evidence that would be offered to prove these facts.  The final pretrial statement was to have preclusive effect: except for 
good cause, no other facts or evidence could be offered at trial.  Plaintiffs' final pretrial statement totaled 11,500 pages, not 
counting a 6,000 page appendix that cross-referenced 250,000 pages of documents."" (Calkins, Summary Judgment, Motions to 
Dismiss, and Other Examples of Equilibrating Tendencies in the Antitrust System (1986) 74 Geo.L.J. 1065, 1123.) "
160,3," It is true that in the very next sentence after the one in which the court articulates the ""tends to exclude"" standard the court 
states as follows: ""Respondents . . . , in other words, must show that the inference of conspiracy is reasonable in light of the 
competing inferences of independent action or collusive action that could not have harmed respondents."" (475 U.S. at p. 588 [89 
L.Ed.2d at p. 553].). Taken at face value, this sentence creates an ambiguity, because it is inconsistent with the preceding 
statement that the plaintiff must present ""evidence 'that tends to exclude the possibility' that the alleged conspirators acted 
independently."" However, other language in Matsushita makes it very clear that ""tends to exclude"" standard prevails; particularly 
the statement that ""conduct that is as consistent with permissible competition as with illegal conspiracy does not, without more, 
support even an inference of conspiracy."" ( Id., at p. 597, fn. 21 [89 L.Ed.2d at p. 559].)"
160,4," The Monsanto court emphasized that distributor termination are different from horizontal cases in several ways.  ""For example, 
the fact that a manufacturer and its distributors are in constant communication about prices and market strategy does not alone 
show that the distributors are not making independent pricing decisions."" (Id., at p. 762 [79 L.Ed.2d at p. 784].) Moreover, 
complaints from rival distributors are natural and unavoidable and ""'do not indicate illegal concerted action.'"" ( Monsanto, supra, 
465 U.S. at p. 763 [79 L.Ed.2d at p. 785], quoting Roesch, Inc. v. Star Cooler Corp. (8th Cir. 1982) 671 F.2d 1168, 1172.) Thus, 
it is precisely because ""[a] manufacturer and its distributors have legitimate reasons to exchange information about the prices 
and the reception of their products in the market"" (id., at p. 762 [79 L.Ed.2d at p. 784]), that the inference of concerted action 
cannot be drawn in vertical price-fixing conspiracy cases only from proof of termination following competitor complaints.  
Because of the ""important distinctions"" that are at the center of distributor-termination cases, the plaintiff must provide additional 
evidence ""that tends to exclude the possibility of independent action by the manufacturer and distributor."" (Id., at p. 768 [79 
L.Ed.2d at p. 788].) Thus, the innocence in distributor termination cases of facts that in other antitrust contexts might appear 
incriminating -- e.g., the sharing of information and complaints from rival distributors -- in effect renders a claim in such a vertical 
case ""implausible"" if it is not supported by additional evidence. Because Monsanto relates to concerns peculiar to vertical cases never thought to be relevant to horizontal cases, it has been 
said that Matsushita's reliance on Monsanto is ""unfair."" (Calkins, Summary Judgment, Motions to Dismiss, and Other Examples 
of Equilibrating Tendencies in the Antitrust System, supra, 74 Geo.L.J. at p. 1125 and fn. 456.) "
161,5," It has been suggested that this new attitude is more related to a desire of overburdened courts to increase the quantity of 
dispositions than the quality of adjudications.  (See, e.g., Brunet, The Use and Misuse of Expert Testimony in Summary 
Judgment (1988) 22 U.C. Davis L.Rev 93, 94 [""Today's courts, facing more complex cases and an increasing caseload, are 
simply more receptive to docket clearing devices such as summary judgment""]; Miner, Federal Courts at the Crossroads (1987) 
4 Const. Commentary 251, 255 [""courts are beginning to relax the standards for summary judgment, and I do not believe that 
this development is unrelated to the caseload crunch""], and Comment, Federal Summary Judgment: The ""New"" Workhorse for 
an Overburdened Federal System (1987) 20 U.C. Davis L.Rev. 955, 978 [""Considering the high litigation costs and crowded 
dockets in federal courts today, the future of summary judgment seems secure""].) "
163,6," The standard applied by the trial court in this case was precisely that adopted by the Court of Appeals in Celotex and rejected 
by the Supreme Court.  As stated in the Supreme Court opinion, the majority of the Court of Appeals concluded that "" Rule 56(e) 
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and this Court's decision in Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 159 (1970), 
establish that 'the party opposing the motion for summary judgment bears the burden of responding only after the moving party 
has met its burden of coming forward with proof of the absence of any genuine issues of material fact.' 244 U.S.App.D.C., at 
163, 756 F.2d, at 184 (italics in original; footnote omitted)."" ( Celotex, supra, 477 U.S. at pp. 321-322 [91 L.Ed.2d at pp. 272-

169,1, The Court notes that there were at least 21 pleadings filed on the issues of personal jurisdiction and venue.
169,2," Additionally, the Court shall not reach the following motions filed by the defendants: any motions to dismiss based on 
insufficiency of process or insufficiency of service of process; any motions to dismiss for failure to plead fraud with particularity; 
any motions to strike portions of the complaint; or, any motions to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action. "
170,3, The complaint numbers 213 pages. 
171,4," All of the admissions of wrongdoing involve actions in Maryland. Although Mylan filed this brief on July 11, 1989, it referred to 
this description of its factual basis for its claims in a brief filed as late as October 13, 1989, just prior to the hearing on the 
Motions to Dismiss."

172,6," Meals attended by defendants Chang, Brancato, Patel and Shah, at which illegal gratuities were paid, occurred ""at restaurants 
in the Rockville [located in Maryland] area."" Matkari and Chang had a meeting ""at the Bethesda Marriott Hotel in Bethesda, 
Maryland where [Matkari] gave Mr. Chang an envelope containing $ 2,000 in currency."" No mention is made of any payments in 
the District of Columbia at all. See Press Release From the United States Attorney for the District of Maryland, May 17, 1989,

[him]."" Brancato Affidavit at para. 9."
172,8," The first Brancato affidavit was filed in response to affidavits filed by defendants Patel and Shah. Defendant Patel asserted in his affidavit that ""I have never travelled to the District of Columbia to transact business with FDA 
officials or employees either as an individual or as a representative of Par. . . . All of my business with representatives of the 
FDA, including Charles Chang and David Brancato, was conducted in the State of Maryland. No business was conducted with 
FDA officials within the District of Columbia."" Affidavit of Ashok Patel in Support of Motion to Dismiss at para. 6. Defendant Shah asserted in his affidavit that ""I never have given either Chang or Brancato anything of value in the District of 
Columbia."" Affidavit of Dilip Shah in Support of his Motion to Dismiss at para. 9. "
173,9," Mr. Jackson states that ""[t]he purpose of this affidavit is to establish that the products of Mylan . . . as well as those defendants 
in this action -- . . . [Akzo, PBI, Par, Quad, ATI, and Vitarine] are sold in the District of Columbia."" para. 2."
173,10," Mr. Jackson asserts that there are three ways that ""Mylan, as well as other generic drug companies"" market their drugs, each 
of which allegedly leads to sales of drugs in the District. These three ways are: one, by selling to national or regional distributors 
who in turn sell drugs primarily to independent pharmacies or small chains; two, by selling to local wholesalers which in turn sell 
to chain or independent drug stores which do not maintain their own drug warehouses; and three, by selling drugs directly to 
drug store chains which maintain their own warehouses. para. 4. In category one, Jackson's assertion regarding the defendants is ""[t]o the best of my knowledge and belief, in addition to the 
drugs that defendants . . . sell through Mason [a national distributor which buys from Mylan], some or all of them also sell 
quantities of drugs to many, if not all, of the national distributors listed in para. 8 [none of which are defendants], as well as other 
national and regional distributors. To the best of my knowledge and belief, each of the national distributors listed in para. 8, as well as other national and regional 
distributors, sells drugs to retailers for ultimate resale in the District of Columbia. To the best of my knowledge and belief, some 
or all of the defendants . . . have sold drugs to the companies listed in para. 8, as well as other national and regional distributors, 
for ultimate resale within the District of Columbia. See paras. 11, 12. In category two, Jackson's assertions regarding the defendants' sale of drugs is limited to the following general, vague 
information: ""[t]o the best of my knowledge and belief, some or all of the defendants . . . presently sell drugs through District 
Wholesale. To the best of my knowledge and belief, similar sales occurred during all of the years relevant to the complaint. To 
the best of my knowledge and belief, a portion of these drugs were resold in the District of Columbia. . . . To the best of my 
knowledge and belief, the sales . . . include sales of some of the drugs listed [in the complaint] . . . as well as numerous other 
drugs."" paras. 20, 21. In category three, Jackson's assertions regarding defendants' drug sales in the District of Columbia are similarly vague and 
insubstantial: ""[t]o the best of my knowledge and belief, some or all of the defendants . . . have sold drugs to the companies 
listed in para. 24 [three companies to which Mylan sells] for ultimate resale within the District of Columbia. . . To the best of my 
knowledge and belief, the sales . . . include sales of some of the drugs listed in [the complaint] . . . as well as numerous other 
drugs."" paras. 28, 29. "

all defendants reside, or in which the claim arose, except as otherwise provided by law."
174,12," Since the Court has determined that the claim did not arise in the District of Columbia for purposes of 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), it is 
not necessary for it to consider whether venue is proper as to each defendant under the general venue provisions."
174,13," Congress' intent in enacting 15 U.S.C. § 22 was to expand the jurisdiction of the District Courts in antitrust suits beyond 
previous bounds of 15 U.S.C. § 15. Austad v. United States Steel Corp., 141 F. Supp. 437, 440 (D.Cal. 1956), citing Eastman

175,16," 15 U.S.C. § 22 cannot be used to confer venue in the District over defendants Matkari, Patel, Shah, Vegesna, Azeem, Chang, 
or Brancato, who are individuals. Additionally, the Court only considers § 22 as it applies to defendants Akzo, PBI, and Par, 
since they are the corporate defendants that have filed motions to dismiss based on improper venue. "
176,17," FBI asserts that it sold its products to three drugstore chains outside the District. FBI believes that these chains operate 
drugstores within the District, in addition to other states. FBI contends that it does not have knowledge of or control over where 
the drugstore chains sell the products they purchase from FBI. Id., at para. 7."
176,18," The Court has already rejected reliance on Mylan's arguments regarding the ""indirect"" sales of drugs of defendants which 
were averred to in the affidavit submitted by Roderick P. Jackson. Accordingly, the Court will limit its analyses of the defendants' 
business transactions in the District to their direct sales. The Court also finds unpersuasive Mylan's other arguments regarding this Court's proper venue. In particular, the Court rejects 
the following vague assertion: ""[i]n a July 11, 1989 hearing before the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the 
House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Dr. Marvin Seife, the Director of FDA's Division of Generic Drugs, testified under 
oath that he had received information that defendant Chang had met with an executive of defendant . . . ATI within the District 
under circumstances strongly suggesting that the meeting was part of the conspiracy alleged in the Complaint."" Mylan's 
Opposition to Par and PBI at 8."
176,19," Mylan also argues that venue is proper in the District of Columbia for Akzo based on Akzo's own actions. However, all of the 
actions of Akzo to which Mylan points refer to business activities in the United States and North America. (See, e.g. ""During 
1988, Akzo had approximately $ 1.35 billion in sales and employed 8900 people in North America."" ""In 1988 alone, Akzo 
invested an additional $ 125 million . . . in North America."" Akzo has begun work on, opened or taken over at least three new 
plants in the United States [in California and Michigan]."" Mylan's Opposition to Akzo's Motion to Dismiss at 7-9. Actions which 
are identified as taking place in North America or the United States cannot be the basis for proper venue in the District of 
Columbia."
176,20," The Court realizes that Akzo has substantial arguments regarding any Court's jurisdictional over Akzo by virtue of its 
subsidiary PBI. Since Akzo is HN12[
] an alien corporation, it may be sued in any district under the general venue statute. 28 U.S.C. § 1391(d). However, the alien venue provision does not establish personal jurisdiction in any Federal District Court. 
Instead, alien corporations may be sued in any district where valid service of process can be made against the alien corporation. 
Weinstein v. Norman M. Morris Corporation, 432 F. Supp. 337 (E.D. Mich. 1977). However, this Court will leave resolution of these arguments to the District Court for the District of Maryland. For now, this Court 
merely holds that since venue is improper as to PBI, there can be no basis for venue in the District of Columbia as to its parent 
company, Akzo, given that the only asserted basis for venue over Akzo was through PBI. "
177,21, Only a portion of these sales were of Par products identified in Mylan's complaint.
177,22," Mylan chose to respond to Azeem's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and improper venue along with its opposition to 
similar motions by defendants Patel and Shah."
177,23," Mylan puts forth several other weak arguments, including: ""[t]he illegal activity which Matkari has already admitted occurred in nearby Bethesda, Maryland. It is likely that defendant 
Matkari, who traveled from Colorado to pay the cash to defendant Chang, traveled through or stayed in the District during that 
trip."" Mylan's Opposition to Matkari at 12. The Court will not rely on such hypothetical assertions to find venue proper in the 
District. Mylan also asserted the interesting theory that ""Matkari corrupted a federal government process, the ultimate control over which 
lay in the District."" Mylan's Opposition to Matkari at 18. As defendant Matkari so aptly responded, ""[n]ot surprisingly, no authority 
is cited for this unusual theory."" Matkari's Reply at 17. As far as the Court is aware, there is none. "
178,24," The Court notes, without deciding on this basis, that several courts have questioned whether or not the contacts by a 
particular defendant with a district can be based on anything other than the defendant's personal affairs, not the affairs 
transacted on behalf of his employer. See, e.g. Anchor Glass Container Corn v. Stand Energy Corp., 711 F. Supp. 325, 329 
(S.D. Miss. 1989) and Bulk Oil (USA), Inc. v. Sun Oil Trading Co., 584 F. Supp. 36, 39 (S.D.N.Y. 1983). But see Miller Brewing 
Co. v. Landau, 616 F. Supp. 1285, 1289 (D.C. Wisc. 1985). "
179,25," Even had this Court found that venue in the District of Columbia was proper as to some of the defendants, the Court would still 
exercise its discretion and transfer this case to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.

""businesses which utilize advertising and marketing services and goods in order to sell their goods and services specifically to 
residents of Co-op City."" In paragraph 42, it states that Riverbay's actions ""constitute an attempt to monopolize the distribution of

the member. In an HMO or PPO, the member typically pays less for health care coverage than under a traditional indemnity 
insurance plan, but is limited in his or her choice of medical care providers. The district court, in its two opinions, described the 
trends and developments in the field of medical care which led to criticism of traditional indemnity insurance and to the

[a] particular diagnostic related group. Providers contracting with [Blue Cross] under the CAP program commit themselves 
to a maximum allowable payment ('MAP') for each service provided to the subscribers. The MAPs are based on uniform 
diagnostic-related groupings (DRGs) of medical services. . . . The 'hold harmless' provision ensures subscribers will not 
receive bills for covered medical expenses in excess of the contract amount [Blue Cross] pays a participating provider.""  Reazin II, 663 F. Supp. at 1375 (citations to record omitted). The CAP contracting provider agreements also contained a ""most 
favored nations"" clause, pursuant to which participating providers agreed to promptly inform Blue Cross of, and make available 
to Blue Cross, any lower rates it charged to competing insurance companies. Thus, Blue Cross was assured of receiving the 
lowest rates its participating hospitals charged. Wesley had been a contracting provider with Blue Cross since the 1940s. In 
early July 1985, approximately two months before Blue Cross decided to terminate Wesley's contracting provider agreement, 
Blue Cross had renewed the agreement. There was considerable testimony about the significant advantages in being a contracting provider hospital and the considerable 
disadvantages to not having that status. See also Reazin I, 635 F. Supp. at 1295-96. From the perspective of Blue Cross 
subscribers, Wesley's loss of its contracting provider status would mean that those subscribers using Wesley (1) would not have 
the same assurance of predictability of health care costs which the maximum allowable payment concept guarantees; (2) would 
not get the benefit of the ""hold harmless"" clause limiting their liability; and (3) would not have access to direct payment of claims 
from Blue Cross to the hospital. The contracting provider agreement with Wesley was never, in fact, terminated because, pending resolution of this suit, the 
parties agreed to maintain Wesley's contracting provider status. The maximum allowable payments were, however, reduced for 
all hospitals, and Wesley agreed to accept those reduced payments. In 1986, before the trial in this case, HCA informed Blue 
Cross that it was withdrawing from the health care financing field and divesting HCP. Blue Cross thereafter signed a new 
contracting provider agreement with Wesley. "
290,8," The letter included, in pertinent part: ""We cannot stand idly by and watch insurance-hospital corporations, such as HCA, monopolize the delivery and financing 
of care by seeking to enroll Blue Cross and Blue Shield subscribers in their insurance programs. Vertical integration is a 
strategy some hospitals may feel to be in their best interest. However, if hospitals decide to compete with Blue Cross and 
Blue Shield in the manner that HCA is competing, Blue Cross and Blue Shield must make a business decision about its 
future relationship with these entities. Hospitals that wish to continue their current relationship with Blue Cross and Blue 
Shield, that do not seek to enroll subscribers in other programs, and that wish to cooperate with Blue Cross and Blue Shield 
as a major marketing arm of the hospital, will experience no change in the contractual relationship that has historically 
served Kansans well."" Plaintiff's Ex. 468C, Addendum to Answer Brief of Appellees Vol. I (emphasis added)."
290,9," In fact, the lease agreement also was never actually terminated. "
291,10," The district court instructed the jury that ""the relevant product market in this case is private health care financing."" R. Vol. III, 
Tab 207 at Instruction 37. In denying Blue Cross' McCarran-Ferguson Act exemption claim, the court stated that ""this case 
proceeded under all parties' agreement [that] 'private health care financing' includes 'self-insurance and self-insured 
administration' products."" Reazin II, 663 F. Supp. at 1403. Additionally, the court noted that ""the market for private health care 
financing embraces defendant's activities with and through its subsidiary, [HMOK]."" Id. As discussed more fully, infra, Blue Cross 
argues that the court should have instructed the jury to make findings as to the products constituting the market of private health 
care financing. "
292,11," Peer Group V includes the four Wichita hospitals and ""is one of two geographically determined peer groups in the state."" 
Reazin I, 635 F. Supp. at 1294."
292,12," In Westman Comm'n Co., 796 F.2d at 1229, this court stated that ""section one of the Sherman Act does not proscribe refusals 
to deal absent a showing of monopoly or market power on the part of the manufacturer."" Thus, Blue Cross argues that, absent 
proof of at least market power, its refusal to deal with Wesley does not violate section 1. See also Schachar v. Am. Academy of 
Opthalmology, Inc., 870 F.2d 397 (7th Cir. 1989) (""the first question in any rule of reason case is market power.""); Ball Memorial 
Hosp., Inc. v. Mutual Hosp. Ins., Inc., 784 F.2d 1325, 1334 (7th Cir. 1986) (""Market power is a necessary ingredient in every 
case under the Rule of Reason.""). In certain circumstances, it may be that a detailed market analysis is not required. See note 
24, infra."
292,13," Blue Cross did not challenge Wesley's standing in either its motion for summary judgment or the pretrial order. See Motion of 
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas, Inc. for Summary Judgment, R.Vol. I, Tab 50 at p. 2; Pretrial Conference Order, R.Vol. II, 
Tab 76. The district court noted that Blue Cross failed to challenge Wesley's standing in its motion for directed verdict. Blue 
Cross finally challenged Wesley's standing in its Alternative Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict or New Trial. 
Defendants' Alternative Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict or New Trial, R.Vol. IV, Tab 246 at 2. Plaintiffs do not appear to object to the district court's rulings that plaintiffs New Century and Reazin lacked standing to pursue 
damages but had standing to seek injunctive relief. See Reazin I, 635 F. Supp. at 1309-20. "
293,14," While the district court did not specifically address antitrust injury, implicit in its discussion was its rejection of the combined 
argument Blue Cross made in its motion for judgment n.o.v. that Wesley failed to prove antitrust injury and lacked standing."
293,15," Taken together, those cases reveal HN12[
] the following factors to be considered in determining antitrust standing: the 
causal connection between the antitrust violations and plaintiff's injury; the defendant's intent; the nature of the plaintiff's injury; 
the directness or indirectness of the connection between the plaintiff's injury and the allegedly unlawful market restraint; the 
speculativeness of the plaintiff's damages; and the ""risk of duplicative recoveries . . . or the danger of complex apportionment of 
damages."" Associated Gen. Contractors, 459 U.S. at 544. The nature of the plaintiff's injury factor is designed to implement the requirement that only antitrust injuries are redressable 
under section 4. HN13[
] An antitrust injury is an ""injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows 
from that which makes defendants' acts unlawful."" Brunswick Corp., 429 U.S. at 489. An injury which is merely causally linked in 
some way to an alleged antitrust violation is insufficient.  Cargill, Inc., 479 U.S. at 109; Brunswick Corp., 429 U.S. at 489. "
294,16," We are also aware that the Supreme Court may be concerned about reading section 4 of the Clayton Act too broadly. See 
Associated Gen. Contractors, 459 U.S. at 529-530 & n.19. We do not believe we have done so in this case. "
295,17," Choice Care was a PPO which Blue Cross attempted to introduce into Wichita in 1985, after ceasing to market HMOK. Blue 
Cross solicited competitive bids from all Wichita hospitals for participation in the Choice Care program. Wesley and St. Francis 
were initially selected as the successful bidders. After Blue Cross altered some of the provisions of the proposed Choice Care 
program, Wesley was unhappy with its submitted bid. During June and July of 1985, Wesley and Blue Cross officials met in an 
effort to resolve these problems. Wesley wanted to submit a new bid but was not permitted to. On July 31, 1985, Wesley 
received the proposed Choice Care contract from Blue Cross. Blue Cross decided in August to abandon the Choice Care 
program in Wichita."
295,18," Indeed, there was abundant evidence that the only reason the Saints agreed to the reduced maximum allowable payments 
was because they anticipated a shift of patients from Wesley to the Saints as a result of the termination of Wesley's contracting 
provider agreement."
295,19," We likewise affirm the district court's rejection of Blue Cross' argument that there could be no agreement because the only 
Blue Cross agents with the authority to terminate the Wesley contract, the executive committee, had no knowledge of the 
alleged conspiracy in which Blue Cross' senior management staff may have participated. "
297,20," One hospital administrator, however, testified that, after the threatened termination, his hospital proceeded with a proposed 
contract with HCP only because the contract contained a termination clause permitting the hospital to terminate the contract on 
six months' notice."
297,21," Lynne Jeane, the executive director of Humana Hospital in Dodge City, Kansas, testified that Blue Cross' letter to all Kansas 
hospitals ""confirmed what we understood was a threat. The announcement of the cancellation of Wesley's policy confirmed that 
they would carry out the threat. . . . We have taken a position that we will wait and see what the outcome of this situation is 
before we attempt to provide any product."" R.Vol. 28 at 2547. Ingo Angermeier, the associate administrator of Asbury Hospital in 
Salina, Kansas, testified that he told Blue Cross' Marlon Dauner that he ""was concerned that [his] right as a provider to compete 
was being threatened."" R.Vol. 20 at 1248. He further testified that his hospital had ""substantially slowed down [its] discussion 
about a PPO,"" as a result of the threatened Wesley termination and the letter to all Kansas hospitals from Blue Cross President 
Wayne Johnston letter. Id. at 1292. Dale Martin, the Administrator and Chief Executive Officer of Graham County Hospital in Hill 
City, Kansas, testified that his hospital ""[has] not had any more discussions with anybody concerning HMOs or PPOs since [he] 
received [the Johnston] letter."" R.Vol. 28 at 2645."
297,22," In response to Blue Cross' argument that its actions only benefited consumers, we note that there was evidence that Wesley 
had historically been not only the largest, but also the premier and one of the most cost-effective hospitals in Wichita. In view of 
Blue Cross' mandate to pursue cost containment, we view with some suspicion the argument that the termination of the largest 
and one of the most cost-effective hospitals promotes cost containment and thereby benefits consumers, either in the short run 
or over the long run. "
298,23," In Shoppin' Bag, 783 F.2d at 162, we approved the following instructions on determining market strength: ""Market strength is often indicated by market share. Market share alone, however, is not enough to determine a firm's 
capacity to achieve monopoly. Other factors you should consider include the number and strength of the defendant's competitors, the difficulty or ease of 
entry into the market by new competitors, consumer sensitivity to change in prices, innovations or developments in the 
market, whether the defendant is a multimarket firm, as well as other evidence presented to you that you may deem 
persuasive regarding defendant's market strength."" "
299,24," The district court ""[agreed] with plaintiffs' suggestion the finding of market power may well be unnecessary given the jury's 
findings of actual anticompetitive restraint of trade."" Reazin II, 663 F. Supp. at 1416. The district court relied on FTC v. Indiana 
Fed'n of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445, 106 S. Ct. 2009 (1986), in reaching that conclusion. The Supreme Court in 
Indiana Fed'n of Dentists suggested two situations where an elaborate analysis of market power may be unnecessary. First, 
""'the absence of proof of market power does not justify a naked restriction on price or output.'"" Id. at 460 (quoting NCAA v. Bd. of 
Regents, 468 U.S. 85, 109-10, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70, 104 S. Ct. 2948 (1984)). Such a restriction ""'requires some competitive 
justification.'"" Indiana Fed'n of Dentists, 476 U.S. at 460 (quoting NCAA v. Bd. of Regents, 468 U.S. at 110). Second, even 
where a restraint is not sufficiently ""naked,"" ""'proof of actual detrimental effects, such as a reduction of output' can obviate the 
need for an inquiry into market power, which is but a 'surrogate for detrimental effects.'"" Indiana Fed'n of Dentists, 476 U.S. at 
460-61 (quoting Areeda & Turner, Antitrust Law, para. 1511 (1986)). Indiana Fed'n of Dentists involved a horizontal agreement among Federation members to withhold dental X-rays from patients' 
insurance companies. Such an agreement could either be viewed as a ""naked restraint"" on output, or as resulting in such actual 
detrimental effects that, absent any procompetitive justification, it could be condemned without proof of market power. The Court 
agreed that ample evidence supported the finding that actual detrimental effects had been proven, because ""in two localities . . . 
Federation dentists constituted heavy majorities of the practicing dentists and . . . as a result of the efforts of the Federation, 
insurers in those areas were, over a period of years, actually unable to obtain compliance with their requests for submission of x 
rays."" Indiana Fed'n of Dentists, 476 U.S. at 460 (emphasis added). We need not decide whether the restraint in this case is of 
such a nature or resulted in such effects as to obviate the need for detailed proof of market power, because plaintiffs did present 
detailed evidence as to Blue Cross' market power. We further express no opinion on the situations where such proof may be 
foregone."
299,25," In Shoppin' Bag, 783 F.2d at 164, this court noted: ""We believe that both elements have been necessary since the test's initial inception. While the concepts of price and 
competition are closely connected, it is conceivable that if a company has obtained control over prices that it still may not 
have the power to exclude other competitors from the market. . . . The differences between the elements will vary according 
to the factual scenarios which arise. Thus, easy distinctions between the concepts will not always be possible. It seems that 
in most instances a true evaluation of market power will not ultimately be possible without substantial data presented on 
both elements."" "
300,26," In addition to receiving some 62% of all earned health insurance premiums in its service area, compared to less than 5% for 
other insurance companies, Blue Cross was the largest non-federal source of revenue for hospitals. For example, there was 
testimony that Blue Cross accounted for 16% of St. Francis' revenues, compared to less than 5% from Blue Cross' next largest 
competitor. Wesley's chairman and chief executive officer, Jack Davis, testified that Blue Cross accounted for approximately 
18% of Wesley's revenues. R. Vol. 14 at 71. The same held true for hospitals outside Wichita. The associate administrator of 
Asbury Hospital testified that approximately 19% of Asbury's revenues came from Blue Cross, while the next largest insurance 
company accounted for at most 5%. R. Vol. 20 at 1231."
300,27," ""Self-insurance"" refers to the situation where an employer, typically a large employer, itself performs the function of insurer for 
its employees. The employer often hires a third party, such as Blue Cross, to administer the program. In the testimony from 
various witnesses concerning Blue Cross' market share, substantial time was devoted to whether self-insurance and self-
insureds should be included within the market of private health care financing, the market within which Blue Cross' market share 
was relevant. Blue Cross' argument to this court is that the jury, as a result of the district court's failure to instruct on the make-up of the 
market, must have ignored self-insurance, because inclusion of self-insurance in the relevant market necessarily lowers Blue 
Cross' market share below that which could sustain a finding of market or monopoly power. We disagree. There was conflicting 
testimony on the proportion of all insureds who participate in a self-insurance program in Kansas. Plaintiffs' expert, Raymond 
Davis, testified that he was unable to obtain hard data on that question either from Blue Cross or from the Kansas Insurance 
Commissioner. There was testimony that on a national basis 39% of those insured were self-insured, but there was also 
testimony as to why that figure might not be an accurate reflection of the self-insurance situation in Kansas. Thus, the jury heard substantial, and conflicting, evidence both as to the percentage of the total insurance market that self-
insurance represented as well as the propriety of including self-insurance when measuring Blue Cross' market share. We cannot 
say that the jury could not have found market or monopoly power from the evidence presented. "
301,28," The district court described that as ""legislation giving it [Blue Cross] the state's imprimatur."" Reazin II, 663 F. Supp. at 1417. 
There was also testimony that being a contracting provider with Blue Cross was viewed as the ""Good Housekeeping"" seal of 
approval."
301,29," Dr. Hay testified: ""These new forms of competition [alternative delivery systems], that's where the downward pressure on price is going to 
come from. That's what is going to cause health care costs to Kansas consumers to be lower, all right. If Blue Cross can 
stop that, can suppress it or can slow it down, that means that the cost of health care financing in Kansas is going to be 
higher than it otherwise would and that means that because Blue Cross has the power to do that, the power to stop it or 
slow it down, in a very real sense Blue Cross has the power over price, the power to prevent those price pressures, all right, 
from coming about to the advantage of Kansas consumers.""  R.Vol. 35 at 3538-39. Blue Cross argues that Dr. Hay erroneously equated power over competition with power over price, in 
contravention of Shoppin' Bag, 783 F.2d at 164. However, in Shoppin' Bag, we specifically noted that the ""concepts of price and 
competition are closely connected"" and that ""easy distinctions between the concepts will not always be possible."" Id. Further, in 
United States v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 351 U.S. 377, 392, 100 L. Ed. 1264, 76 S. Ct. 994 (1956), the case relied on in 
Shoppin' Bag in its discussion of monopoly power, the Court specifically stated: ""Price and competition are so intimately entwined that any discussion of theory must treat them as one. It is inconceivable 
that price could be controlled without power over competition or vice versa.""  Thus, we perceive no error in Dr. Hay's linkage of power over competition to power over price. Moreover, as we discuss further, 
plaintiffs introduced evidence of both Blue Cross' power over price and its power to exclude competition. "
302,30," The fact that the First Circuit has recently concluded that, as a matter of law, a ""Prudent Buyer"" policy utilized by Blue Cross 
and Blue Shield of Rhode Island, essentially identical to the most favored nations clause in this case, did not constitute 
monopolization in violation of section 2 does not alter our conclusion on the existence of Blue Cross' monopoly power here. See 
Ocean State Physicians Health Plan, Inc. v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield, 883 F.2d 1101 (1st Cir. 1989). In Ocean State, Blue 
Cross conceded its monopoly power. Id. at 1110. The only question was whether Blue Cross violated section 2. By contrast, the 
most favored nations clause here is not itself challenged as unlawful monopolization. Rather, it is only considered as evidence 
of, or as contributing to, Blue Cross' market or monopoly power. We need not reach the question addressed in Ocean State of 
whether use of the most favored nations clause could itself violate section 2."
302,31," The district court rejected this argument. The court opined that Blue Cross had waived that argument because, while asserted 
in Blue Cross' answer as a defense, it was abandoned in Blue Cross' motion for summary judgment and in the pre-trial order. 
Even if not waived, the district court concluded the argument was meritless under the immunity test of Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 
341, 87 L. Ed. 315, 63 S. Ct. 307 (1943). Blue Cross does not make any broad immunity argument on appeal. It does, in passing, reassert the argument that, because 
Blue Cross' rates were subject to approval and regulation by the Kansas Commissioner of Insurance, Blue Cross could not 
control prices and therefore lacked monopoly, and possibly market, power. The district court rejected that specific argument, 
stating: ""The factual predicate for such an argument is simply absent in this case. Defendant's own economic expert, Peter 
Hamilton, was specifically asked at his deposition two weeks prior to trial: 'What role, if any, does the fact that Blue Cross is 
regulated by the Insurance Commissioner of Kansas play in your opinions?' His unequivocal answer: 'None at this time.' 
(Hamilton Depo., p. 57). At trial, [Blue Cross] called Dr. Hamilton to present its best defense to market and monopoly 
power, Dr. Hamilton's testimony was utterly bereft of any reference whatsoever to state rate regulation.""  Reazin II, 663 F. Supp. at 1419. We agree with the district court that Blue Cross effectively abandoned this argument. Furthermore, Blue Cross does not direct us 
to any materials indicating the nature of the regulation at issue and has thus failed to prove that the Insurance Commissioner 
engages in the kind of regulation which might indicate that Blue Cross lacks any control over price. Finally, not only did Blue 
Cross' expert, Dr. Hamilton, fail to mention state regulation in his discussion of Blue Cross' monopoly and market power, but a 
number of Blue Cross employees, as well, testified about Blue Cross' pricing policies without mention of state regulation."
302,32," We thus agree with the district court that Ball Memorial Hosp., Inc. v. Mutual Hosp. Ins., 784 F.2d 1325 (7th Cir. 1986), a case 
on which Blue Cross heavily relies, is distinguishable. In Ball Memorial, Blue Cross' market share was smaller (27% of all 
patients in Indiana) and the health insurance market was evidently more competitive, with some 1000 firms licensed to do 
business in Indiana, and more than 500 selling insurance at the time of the decision. To the extent that the Ball Memorial court 
opined that entry barriers in the health care financing market are always low, in any health care financing market in the country, 
we respectfully disagree. See also Reazin II, 663 F. Supp. at 1420 n.16; Reazin I, 635 F. Supp. at 1328-31. "
303,33," Blue Cross does not appear to challenge on appeal the award of punitive damages under the state law tortious interference 
claim. Accordingly, we do not address it."
303,34," As the district court noted in Reazin I: ""The case is presently before the Court in a unique posture because of the parties' voluntary agreement to preserve the 
status quo, continuing to abide by the terms of the Wesley/[Blue Cross] contracting provider agreement pending the 
outcome of this suit. The Court perceives the case as primarily a declaratory judgment action which will be tried to the jury 
to determine whether what is now the proposed termination of Wesley's contract, along with the formation and effect of the 
revised [Blue Cross] contracting provider agreements with the remaining Wichita hospitals, would violate the antitrust laws if 
carried out."" Reazin I, 635 F. Supp. at 1316. "
307,35," Plaintiffs initially argued Blue Cross' actions also interfered with Wesley's present and future business relations with patients, 
doctors, nurses, other medical personnel, administrators and staff, as well as with HCP's and New Century's present and future 
business relations with hospitals and other providers of health care services. The jury was only presented with a special 
interrogatory relating to Wesley's relationship with Blue Cross subscribers."
307,36," The jury found that one of the elements of plaintiff HCP's tortious interference claim was not established. That element was the 
requirement that Blue Cross have undertaken its allegedly unlawful conduct ""with the wrongful intent of injuring or destroying the 
business of"" HCP. "
308,37," The Kansas Supreme Court referred to the Restatement (Second) of Torts § 767 (1979), which discusses whether conduct is 
proper or improper: HN40[
] ""'In determining whether an actor's conduct in intentionally interfering with a contract or a prospective contractual 
relations of another is improper or not, consideration is given to the following factors: (a) the nature of the actor's conduct, (b) the actor's motive, (c) the interests of the other with which the actor's conduct interferes, (d) the interests sought to be advanced by the actor, (e) the social interests in protecting the freedom of action of the actor and the contractual interests of the other, (f) the proximity or remoteness of the actor's conduct to the interference, and (g) the relations between the parties.'"" Turner, 722 P.2d at 1116-17."
308,38," ""An Allen charge derives its name from jury instructions approved by the Supreme Court in Allen v. United States, 164 U.S.

309,39," Some three-and-one-half months after the verdict was returned, a juror submitted a letter to the court in which the juror 
claimed her verdict was coerced. See Reazin II, 663 F. Supp. at 1443 n.20. The court denied Blue Cross' motion for a hearing 
into the letter. Blue Cross argues that denial was error. We disagree. We regard this as a classic example of a juror attempting 
to impeach her own verdict, which we will not permit in this case. See Tanner v. United States, 483 U.S. 107, 97 L. Ed. 2d 90, 
107 S. Ct. 2739 (1987); United States v. Miller, 806 F.2d 223, 225 n.2 (10th Cir. 1986); Holden v. Porter, 405 F.2d 878, 879 
(10th Cir. 1969)."
309,40," Blue Cross made several motions for a mistrial during the jury's deliberations. In its third such motion, made four days before 
the jury returned its verdict, Blue Cross did not even raise the court's communications with the jury as a ground for the motion. 
See R. Vol. 44 at 85-86."
309,41," HMOK was an HMO which Blue Cross attempted to introduce into Wichita in 1984. Ultimately, in 1985, Blue Cross withdrew 
HMOK from Wichita. The counterclaim largely revolves around the reasons for HMOK's lack of success in the Wichita market. 
The district court thoroughly explored the evidence relating to HMOK's failure in its two opinions. See Reazin I, 635 F. Supp. at 
1300-01; Reazin II, 663 F. Supp. at 1376-1377, 1465-68. "
310,42," Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 18, prohibits acquisitions the effect of which ""may be substantially to lessen 
competition, or to tend to create a monopoly."""
310,43," While Blue Cross listed it as an issue in its docketing statement, it does not brief the district court's grant of summary judgment 
on the interference with prospective advantage claim. We consider it abandoned."
310,44," Blue Cross also argues the acquisitions violate sections 1 and 2, although the counterclaim itself was not completely clear on 
that point. Additionally, in the pretrial order, Blue Cross agreed that a remaining legal issue was ""whether HCA acquired Wesley, 
Health Care Plus, and New Century in violation of section 7 of the Clayton Act."" No mention was made of sections 1 and 2. "
311,45," 28 U.S.C. § 1920 HN50[
] provides that a federal court may tax as costs against the losing party certain items, including ""fees and disbursements for . . . witnesses."" 28 U.S.C. § 1920(3).  28 U.S.C. § 1821 HN51[
] defines the witness fees specified in section 1920(3). In addition to an attendance fee of $ 30.00 per day, section 1821 also permits a witness to recover for travel 
expenses to and from trial and provides a subsistence allowance if the witness must stay overnight to attend trial."
311,46," In Crawford Fitting, HN52[
] the Supreme Court held that ""absent explicit statutory or contractual authorization for the taxation of the expenses of a litigant's witnesses as costs, federal courts are bound by the limitations set out in 28 U.S.C. § 1821 
and § 1920."" Id. at 445. Specifically, the Court held that Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d) did not permit an award of expert witness fees in 
excess of the limits contained in 28 U.S.C. § 1821. Blue Cross argues that same rule applies to 15 U.S.C. § 15(a) permitting a 
prevailing antitrust plaintiff to recover ""the cost of suit."" Thus, section 15(a) cannot permit costs beyond those expressly 
permitted in 28 U.S.C. § 1821. Plaintiffs respond that Crawford Fitting is limited to cases where a court invokes Rule 54(d). It says nothing about awards of 
costs under 15 U.S.C. § 15. "

312,48," In reaching this conclusion, we are aware that the question of whether expert witness fees should be viewed as ""costs"" or as 
expenses of litigation recoverable as attorneys' fees has engendered some disagreement among courts. And, particularly in view 
of Crawford Fitting, we are aware of the hotly contested issue of whether expert witness fees are recoverable as part of the "
313,," attorneys' fees a prevailing party may recover under 42 U.S.C. § 1988. Compare Friedrich v. City of Chicago, 888 F.2d 511 (7th 
Cir. 1989) with West Virginia Univ. Hosps., Inc. v. Casey, 885 F.2d 11 (3d Cir. 1989), cert. granted, 494, 110 S. Ct. 1294, 108 L. 
Ed. 2d 472 58 U.S.L.W. 3545 (1990). Although this circuit has held that such expert witness fees can be included in an award of 
attorneys' fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988, we decline in this case to extend that reasoning to section 4 of the Clayton Act."
313,49," In Ramos, we further stated that ""absent more unusual circumstances than we see in this case, the fee rates of the local area 
should be applied even when the lawyers seeking fees are from another area."" 713 F.2d at 555. We thus contemplated the 
possibility that ""unusual circumstances"" might warrant a departure from local hourly rates. The district court in this case found 
such ""unusual circumstances."" "

329,3," It is interesting to note that defendant D.C. Plan, in its counterclaim, also seeks declaratory relief and that such relief, if granted, 
would have an extraterritorial effect. "
330,4," Pursuant to Virginia choice of law rules, the validity, interpretation and construction of agreements are governed by the laws of 
the state where the contracts were made. Crosson v. Conlee, 745 F.2d 896, 902 (4th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1054, 84 
L. Ed. 2d 822, 105 S. Ct. 1759 (1985). A contract is ""made"" where the final act necessary to make the contract binding is done. 
See Chesapeake Supply & Equipment Co. v. J. I. Case Co., 700 F. Supp. 1415, 1417 (E.D. Va. 1988). All of the agreements in 
this case ultimately became effective by vote of the Association's Board of Directors in Illinois. Thus, because the agreements 
were made in Illinois, Virginia choice of law rules require that Illinois law governs the validity, interpretation and construction of 
the agreements. "
333,5," Federal courts hearing a state law claim must apply the procedural rules of the forum state, including its choice of law rules. 
Zukowski v. Dunton, 650 F.2d 30, 34, n. 3 (4th Cir. 1981). Under Virginia law, questions regarding the timeliness of an action are 
determined by reference to forum law. Hospelhorn v. Corbin, 179 Va. 348, 19 S.E.2d 72 (1942). "
334,6," The D.C. Plan's counterclaim also includes a claim for selective enforcement, although this claim was not argued during the 
course of the trial. In any event, the court finds that the D.C. Plan has failed to show selective enforcement. See United States 
Jaycees v. Philadelphia Jaycees, 639 F.2d 134 (3d Cir. 1981). In addition, D.C. Plan has failed to establish that the Association 
has waived any of its rights. "
336,7," The D.C. Plan relies heavily on U.S. v. Sealy, 388 U.S. 350, 87 S. Ct. 1847, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1238 (1967). Sealy involved an 
antitrust action brought by the government against a licensor of mattresses and bedding products. The complained of conduct 
consisted of the licensor conspiring with its licensees to allocate mutually-exclusive territories among the licensees. The licensor 
essentially promised the licensees not to grant any additional licenses to others seeking to operate in the same geographic area 
as the licensees. The facts of Sealy are clearly distinguishable to those in this case. The anticompetitive conduct in Sealy 
affected those who sought to sell Sealy products in an area already granted to a designated licensee. The arrangement between 
Sealy and its licensees completely foreclosed others from selling Sealy products in a particular area. In this case, the 
Association, in seeking to protect its rights in the Marks, has not completely foreclosed the D.C. Plan from engaging in foreign 
business. The Association has indeed encouraged such business, provided that the Marks are not used without its consent and 
authorization. "

355,2," Justice Rehnquist, joined by two other justices, dissented from the Supreme Court's summary affirmance because they 
questioned whether the application of an undefined ""public interest"" standard falls within the judicial power under Article III. See 
460 U.S. at 1001-06. "
356,3," Under the reorganization plan submitted by AT & T and approved by the court, the 22 BOCs were consolidated into seven 
Regional Holding Companies. See United States v. Western Elec. Co., 282 U.S. App. D.C. 347, 569 F. Supp. 1057 (D.D.C.), 
aff'd sub nom.  California v. United States, 464 U.S. 1013, 78 L. Ed. 2d 719, 104 S. Ct. 542 (1983). For simplicity, we continue 
to refer to these Regional Holding Companies as the ""BOCs."""
356,4," According to section IV(K) of the decree, ""'interexchange telecommunications' means telecommunications between a point or 
points located in one exchange telecommunications area and a point or points located in one or more other exchange areas or a 
point outside an exchange area."" 552 F. Supp. at 229. ""Exchange areas"" are geographic areas of jurisdiction established by the 
BOCs according to criteria set out in the decree. See id."
356,5," Section IV(J) of the decree defines ""information services"" as: the offering of a capability for generating, acquiring, storing, transforming, processing, retrieving, utilizing, or making 
available information which may be conveyed via telecommunications, except that such service does not include any use of 
any such capability for the management, control, or operation of a telecommunications system or the management of a 
telecommunications service."
356,552, F. Supp. at 229. 
357,6," Section VII of the decree is entitled ""Retention of Jurisdiction"" and reads: Jurisdiction is retained by this Court for the purpose of enabling any of the parties to this Modification of Final Judgment, or, 
after the reorganization specified in section I, a BOC to apply to this Court at any time for such further orders or directions 
as may be necessary or appropriate for the construction or carrying out of this Modification of Final Judgment, for the 
modification of any of the provisions hereof, for the enforcement of compliance herewith, and for the punishment of any 
violation hereof."
357,552, F. Supp. at 231. 
358,7," AT & T stated that it did not oppose information services relief for the BOCs but argued that any modification of that restriction 
should be made pursuant to section VII of the decree, not under section VIII(C)."
358,8," The court normally required the BOCs to operate the competitive business through a separate subsidiary that would obtain its 
own debt financing. Furthermore, the total net revenues for all non-telecommunications activities engaged in by a single BOC 
were limited to ten percent of that company's total net revenues. These conditions were designed to minimize the risk of cross-
subsidization and to guarantee that the BOCs would not neglect their primary responsibility of providing local telephone service. 
See 673 F. Supp. at 598. "
359,9," We need not decide here whether ""abuse of discretion"" is the proper standard for reviewing the district court's decisions 
concerning modification under section VII -- where the district judge is apparently called upon to apply a public interest standard. 
But cf.  Maryland v. United States, 460 U.S. 1001, 1001-06, 75 L. Ed. 2d 472, 103 S. Ct. 1240 (1983) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). "
360,10," In interpreting the decree, we do, however, take careful account of the explanatory opinion issued by the district judge at the 
time the decree was entered, see 552 F. Supp. at 131, although we are, of course, not bound by it, see United States v. Western 
Elec. Co., 846 F.2d at 1429."
360,11," When pressed at oral argument about the applicability of section VIII(C) to DOJ motions, counsel for the Department stated, 
surprisingly, that the Government had ""no position"" on the matter, noting that the Court had ""not asked [the Department] to 
argue"" that issue."
360,12," The Government opposed the modification sought in Swift, and therefore it is not at all clear to us that the stringent, so-called 
""unforeseen conditions"" test of Swift would apply to motions brought by the DOJ under section VII. Since the DOJ is, as plaintiff, 
the ""Prime Mover"" of this case, it may well be that modifications it seeks should be evaluated under a standard somewhat more 
akin to the ""public interest"" test of the Tunney Act. Still, it is true that the line of business restrictions were part of what AT & T 
bargained for in the original decree, therefore suggesting that the modification requests that AT & T opposes should perhaps be 
viewed differently from those that all the parties agree to. We need not pass judgment on this issue here since the DOJ brought 
no motion under section VII. "
361,13," We do not agree with the district judge, however, that the BOCs' burden is ""particularly heavy"" because of the litigants' and the 
public's interest in the finality of judgments or because would -- be competitors of the BOCs invested ""billions of dollars"" in 
reliance on the line of business restrictions. See 673 F. Supp. at 533 n. 25. Any enterprise that read the decree and the district 
court's 1982 opinion could not reasonably have relied on the perpetual enforcement of the line of business restrictions in light of 
the inclusion of section VIII(C) and the explicit pledge to review the continuing need for the restrictions every three years. And 
any interest that any party conceivably has in the ""finality"" of this judgment is necessarily tempered by the same factors. "
363,14," Assuming after remand the BOCs are permitted entry into the information services market, we would also expect the DOJ's 
reports concerning BOC behavior in that market as well as the effectiveness of applicable FCC regulation to be critical in 
subsequent Triennial Reviews. "
364,15," The district judge explicitly stated that his considerations of some of the public policies mentioned above ""d[id] not have an 
actual impact on the Court's decisions."" 673 F. Supp. at 580. While that disclaimer makes it somewhat unusual that he would 
include the sections of his opinion expressly dealing with those public policies, we take the district judge at his word. "

366,18," The BOCs pressed the argument below that the interexchange restriction should be removed because the Justice Department 
agreed to, and the district court accepted, a consent decree in an antitrust action against GTE that did not include line of 
business restrictions. See United States v. GTE Corp., 603 F. Supp. 730 (D.D.C. 1984). This claim was not raised on appeal and 
so we do not discuss it. We also have no occasion to discuss the suggestion made by the DOJ below, but dropped on appeal, 
that the restriction should be lifted with respect to cellular radio, paging, and other mobile interexchange services."
366,19," This latter admission moots any suggestion that the district court should have balanced the asserted economies of vertical 
integration against the anticompetitive danger of BOC entry into the market. We express no opinion as to whether such a 
balance would be the proper subject of litigation in future Triennial Reviews.  Cf. 673 F. Supp. at 560. "
367,20," The DOJ also noted that the so-called ""Open Architecture"" or ONA requirements, an integral part of the FCC's Computer III 
rules, might provide another obstacle to a BOC's ability to discriminate. When the case was presented to the district court, 
however, the DOJ represented that ""it is unclear just what the impact of ONA on the potential for discrimination will be and how 
those effects will vary from market to market."" For that reason, we do not understand how a court could be expected to rely at all 
in this Triennial Review on the asserted efficacy of the FCC's Computer III rules."
367,21," The DOJ also pointed to the FCC's Joint Cost proceeding which, it argues, will give the BOCs the incentive to develop 
accounting rules that are acceptable to the FCC in order to escape from the separate subsidiary requirements for BOC provision 
of enhanced (information) services and CPE. Whatever merit there might be in this argument -- and we note that the district 
judge thought there was very little -- we need not even consider it in this Triennial Review since the Joint Cost rules had not 
been implemented at the time this case was brought. See 673 F. Supp. at 572. Furthermore, we note with some discomfort that 
at least some of the BOCs were petitioning this court to strike down as arbitrary and capricious one of the central aspects of the 
Joint Cost rules designed to deal with the cross-subsidization problem while simultaneously pointing to the Joint Cost rules in 
this appeal as effectively ending the cross-subsidization danger. See Southwestern Bell Corp. v. FCC, 896 F.2d 1378 (D.C.Cir. 
1990)."
367,22," Conversely, R & D costs are quite high in the fiber-optics sector of the transmission equipment market. Still, the DOJ submits 
that cross-subsidization is not a primary concern since the BOCs' competitors in that sector could respond in kind to cross-
subsidization without suffering any competitive disadvantage. "
368,23," Among the regulations relied upon, however, were the new Computer III and Joint Cost rules which were not fully 
implemented at the time this case was submitted to the district court."
368,24," For instance, we question the DOJ's reliance on not-yet-final regulations as well as its apparent equation of FCC success in 
regulating CPE provision by the BOCs with its ability to regulate their CPE manufacturing. It would seem that manufacturing 
offers far greater opportunities for discrimination in interconnection. "
369,25," Under the Decree, ""Information service"" means the offering of a capability for generating, acquiring, storing, transforming, processing, 
retrieving, utilizing, or making available information which may be conveyed via telecommunications, except that such 
service does not include any use of any such capability for the management, control, or operation of a telecommunications 
service. Decree § IV(J), reprinted in 552 F. Supp. at 229."
369,26," The DOJ, in contrast, premises its challenge to the district court's information-services ruling solely on the ground that the 
court misapplied section VIII(C)."
369,27," Although the appellees suggest that AT & T did not consent to removal of the Decree's information-services restriction, it is 
clear from the record that AT & T did not object to such a modification of the Decree. See Joint Appendix 2695-96; see also id. 
1402. The district court did not suggest otherwise. See 673 F. Supp. 534 & n. 33 (characterizing AT & T's position as "
370,," ""suggest[ions]"" as to alternative ""routes with respect to the information services restriction""). For purposes of identifying the 
proper standard of review, the critical point is that neither AT & T nor the DOJ opposed the BOCs' motion. "
372,28," As Dr. Huber notes: The preparation of the information content itself is one activity that [the BOCs] would have notably little opportunity to cross-
subsidize. Running a local telephone exchange does not require reporters, copy editors, joke writers, financial analysts, 
astrologists, or other information-content providers. Id. at 6.35 (footnote omitted)."
372,29," We are also concerned with the practical difficulty of enforcing a merely partial repeal of the information-services ban; as the 
trial court recognized, significant disputes can be expected to arise concerning whether the BOCs are using their right to transmit "
373,," the information of others as a cover for generating their own. See 673 F. Supp. at 596. Because it is clearly in the public interest 
to minimize the district court's oversight responsibilities under the decree, see id. at 599, the district court on remand should also 
consider whether the residual anticompetitive risks associated with lifting the restriction on generation of information are 
sufficiently great to outweigh the administrative burdens on the court of policing this limited prohibition. "
403,1," According to the complaint, the December 11, 1987, agreement provided that HPT would act as a commission agent for NOW 
Plastics in the marketing of polyester film and other film products for two years. Now Plastics also made HPT its exclusive sales 
representative for all polyester film sold to the film coating and metallizing industry, and HPT agreed not to offer any competing 
polyester film to the industry which was not supplied by NOW Plastics. The Agreement also provided that for two years after the 
termination of the Agreement, but in any event until November 1, 1991, HPT would not market, directly or indirectly, any 
products from plaintiff's suppliers, Kolon Industries, Sam Young, and Unitika, nor contact any of the suppliers, without plaintiff's 
prior written consent. Plaintiffs allege that HPT terminated the Agreement in January 1989, and notified plaintiff of the 
termination in April 1989. Defendant Lipka is alleged to have acted as a commission agent for HPT, and to have conspired with HPT and its principals, 
through Lipka Products, to solicit and deal with plaintiff's customers in breach of the agreement between plaintiff and HPT."
403,2," For venue to be proper in cases involving multiple claims, each of the claims joined must have individually arisen in that district. 
It is not sufficient that one or several of the claims arose there. See C. Wright & A. Miller, Fed. Practice & Procedure, § 3808 at 
81. "
404,3," Plaintiffs contend that the contract was negotiated in part during a meeting in New York in February of 1987 between 
representatives of plaintiff and HPT, and that the parties held a second meeting in New York in 1988 to discuss problems arising 
out of their contractual relationship. It does not appear, however, that New York was chosen as the site of these meetings for 
any substantive reason. The February 1987 meeting apparently occurred during a trade show attended by the parties, and the 
1988 meeting occurred at a New York airport, at the request of plaintiff's principal, who was passing through New York en route 
to another destination. That meeting, in any event, was in the Eastern, not the Southern, District of New York."
404,4," Plaintiff attempts to portray defendants' contacts with New York as more substantial by referring to other business dealings of 
defendants with New York companies long before the contract between these parties was signed or the breach arguably 
occurred. Thus, it claims that defendant HPT was doing business with a company in Newburgh, New York from 1983-1985. 
HN3[
] While these contacts with New York might be relevant in a personal jurisdiction inquiry, they are not relevant to the 
""weight of contacts"" analysis conducted here. The contacts to be weighed are those between the claim and the jurisdiction, not 
those generally between a defendant and the jurisdiction. "
405,5," Plaintiff lists fourteen companies with which defendants allegedly had dealings, and whose representatives therefore are likely 
to be called as witnesses at trial. Only two of these companies, Camvac and Stanpat, have any relation to New York. The other 
fourteen are located in New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania. See Plaintiff's Affidavit in Opposition, Exhibit L. Plaintiff 
contends that New York is still a far more convenient forum than Ohio in terms of securing the presence of these third-party 
witnesses. However, plaintiff has made no showing that the third-party witnesses whom they wish to call will decline to testify in 
Ohio. Moreover, defendants have listed sixteen companies whose representatives they intend to call as witnesses, and for these 
witnesses Ohio appears to be the most convenient forum. See Affidavit of Defendants in Reply, Exhibit P. See Georgia Boot Div. 
v. Georgia Footwear Corp., 579 F. Supp. 1037, 1038-39 (S.D.N.Y. 1984) (finding venue in district which is more convenient for 
defendants' witnesses, where plaintiff has made no assertion that third-party witnesses would decline to testify there)."
405,6," If the venue provisions are satisfied as to some but not all of the defendants, plaintiffs of course have the option of maintaining 
their action here as to those defendants, and commencing a separate action in another district as to the remaining defendants. 
However, splitting the action in this way creates inefficiencies and multiplies the burdens on witnesses. It might well justify 
transfer for the purpose of consolidation under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a)."
405,7," HN5[
] As for individual defendants, the ""transacts affairs"" prong has been held to require evidence of personal affairs of the 
defendant within the state, not simply affairs he may have transacted on behalf of his employer. See Bulk Oil v. Sun Oil Trading 
Co., 584 F. Supp. 36, 39-40 (S.D.N.Y. 1983). Of course, in situations in which the employer is essentially a vehicle for the 
activities of the individual, such as a ""one man firm,"" it may be possible to ""pierce the corporate veil"" and attribute the individual's 
activity on behalf of his company to him personally. In this case, I need not determine whether such piercing is justified for HPT 
or Lipka Products, because I find that neither transacted sufficiently substantial and continuous affairs here as to justify venue for 
either the corporation or its principals."
405,8," Cf. Agra Chem. Dist. Co. v Marion Laboratories, Inc., 523 F. Supp. 699, 702 (W.D.N.Y. 1981) (listing seven factors to be 
considered in determining whether a corporation is ""transacting business"" under the analogous venue provisions of federal 
antitrust law). HN6[
] These factors include whether the corporation has within the district a place to do business, people to 
carry on the business, or tangible property; whether the corporation is subject to regulation in the district; and whether it has 
business operations there, manifestations of doing business, or good will activities. None of these seven factors is clearly met in 
the case of defendants HPT, Lipka Products, or their principals. "

444,4," Some courts and commentators state that the Supreme Court's decisions in Matsushita, Celotex, and Anderson v. Liberty 
Lobby, Inc, 477 U.S. 242, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202, 106 S. Ct. 2505 (1986) represent a ""new era"" more favorable to summary judgment 
motions. See e.g., Childress, A New Era for Summary Judgments: Recent Shifts at the Supreme Court, 116 F.R.D. 183 (1987). 
For example, the Matsushita court stated that plaintiffs ""must show that the inference of conspiracy is reasonable in light of the 
competing inferences [of lawful behavior]."" Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 588. This language suggests that courts must more critically 
weigh the inferences which the parties urge. However, the Second Circuit Court recently emphasized in the context of an 
antitrust summary judgment motion that, ""HN8[

what inferences are reasonable and therefore permissible, it is evident that the question of what weight should be assigned to 
competing permissible inferences remains within the province of the fact-finder at a trial."" Apex Oil Co. v. Dimauro, 822 F.2d 
246, 253 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 977, 98 L. Ed. 2d 487, 108 S. Ct. 489 (1987). "
445,5," ""Bookout"" contracts are separate contracts entered into by the parties to the original contracts whereby they settle their 
respective obligations under the original contracts by paying each other the difference between the contract price and an agreed 
reference price."
445,6," In 1987, the U.K. government changed the tax law to limit a producer's ability to select lower-priced sales from a large portfolio, 
thus reducing the frequency of tax spinning."
445,7," In Matsushita, the Supreme Court imposed HN9[
] a higher burden on the party opposing summary judgment when the 
scheme alleged is economically irrational. The Matsushita Court found that the predatory pricing scheme alleged -- pricing 
sufficiently below the market level to drive out competitors in order to gain monopoly power and then recoup any resulting losses 
through monopoly profits -- was economically irrational because it led to definite short-term loss and uncertain long-term gain. 
The instant case involves possible short-term gain and, defendants contend, almost certain long-term loss."
445,8," Earnings from upstream operations, which include the exploration and production of crude oil, rise and fall directly with crude oil 
prices. Earnings from downstream operations, which include the refining and marketing of refined products, derive from the 
difference between the cost of purchasing and refining the crude oil and the market price of the refined products. "
446,9," Conoco claims that when its crude production and refinery runs are compared, it was a net seller of crude oil between January 
and June of 1986."
446,10," Defendants contend that Colin Robinson, Transnor's expert witness, wrongly assumed that defendant companies bought 
lower-priced North Sea crude oil for their refineries in the open market during 1986. Exxon claims that from late 1985 through 
early 1986, the use of North Sea Crude Oil in Exxon refineries dramatically decreased, and the use of Saudi Arabian oil 
purchased on a netback basis increased. Moreover, Conoco did not use Brent Oil in its U.K. refinery."
446,11," Transnor's expert Colin Robinson, Professor of Economics at the University of Surrey, England, opined that defendants' 
overall after-tax profits would be increased by a drop in crude-oil prices, based on his analysis of the effect of declining oil prices 
on a ""typical"" and ""sophisticated"" integrated producer/refiner of North Sea crude oil, employing data gathered from the trade 
journal Petroleum Intelligence Weekly. Robinson acknowledges, however, that his data do not reflect ""the crude prices paid, the 
refinery netbacks achieved [nor] . . . the tax position of any one company."" Robinson Decl. paras. 49-50. Defendants object to 
Robinson's results as imprecise and lacking probative value because he did not examine data produced in discovery relating to 
defendants' actual experiences."
446,12," Transnor argues that Exxon's and Conoco's figures are misleading because they refer to ""earnings"" or ""after tax operating 
income"" rather than ""profits."" However, these terms are interchangeable, each referring to the excess, if any, of revenues over 
expenses. Transnor further faults Exxon's figures because they combine natural gas and petroleum earnings; Exxon attempts to 
justify this by asserting that the bulk of its natural gas production is dissolved in crude oil and it is unable to separate out the two 
for reporting purposes."
446,13," Richard J. Kruizenga, Vice President-Corporate Planning for Exxon states that ""competitive pressures are strong in the 
downstream and as a result product prices adjust to reflect changes in the price of crude oil."" Kruizenga Aff. para. 5. A Conoco 
document prepared in connection with Conoco's 1986 proposed plan stated ""the effect of lower crude oil prices is dependent "
447,," upon how quickly product margins reach a new equilibrium and whether the crude oil price decline precedes that of products or 
vice versa."""
447,14," Exxon states that between 1976 and 1988, its upstream earnings averaged $ 3.4 billion and downstream earnings averaged $ 
1.1 billion. During that period, whenever lower crude oil prices depressed upstream earnings, increases in downstream earnings 
were never sufficient to compensate for the upstream decreases. In further support of their claims of implausibility, defendants 
point to their large reserves of oil and natural gas and argue that they could not benefit from a decline in its price."
447,15," Transnor claims that a high degree of market power enabled integrated companies to keep refinery netbacks high while crude 
prices were falling. Robinson identifies eight firms, including four other than defendants and their alleged co-conspirator Mobil, 
as constituting an oligopoly in Western Europe because they accounted for 65% of total product sales in Western Europe in 
1984 and 82% of refinery capacity in the British market in 1986. When defendants applied the Herfindahl-Hirshman Index 
(""HHI""), a measure of market concentration, to firms with Western European refineries, an index of 1028 resulted. Since an HHI 
range between 1000-1800 represents a moderately concentrated market, see U.S. Department of Justice Merger Guidelines at 
§ 3.1, 4Trade Reg. Rep. (CCH) P13,103 at 20, 560 (1984), it is unlikely, although possible, that Western European refineries 
operated as an oligopoly. Robinson concedes that defendants lacked ""enough market power to be able to keep refinery 
netbacks constant whilst crude [oil] prices were being cut."" Robinson Decl. para. 44."
447,16," Robinson also concedes that such gains could be recognized only if these companies could delay the decline of product 
prices in the other markets as well. Transnor has provided no evidence that defendants possessed sufficient market power to 
delay the decline of product prices worldwide."
447,17," Although the document does not state whether this $ 3.00 per barrel decrease refers to oil prices generally or only Brent 
prices, it appears from subsequent documents that this figure refers to Brent prices. "
448,18," Defendants argue that there was little ""commonality of conduct"" among them as each producer adopted different rules for tax 
spinning and engaged in spinning for different motives. Nonetheless, defendants' conduct shared important common features in 
that each defendant entered into significant numbers of matched buy/sell transactions for tax purposes."
448,19," Transnor's own experts admit that it was not necessary for defendants to collude in order to benefit individually from tax 
spinning. Spuller Dep. at 290, 308, 337; Robinson Dep. at 174. "
449,20," Except for one four-way transaction, these transactions involved three parties and the original selling party ended up with 
exactly what it had sold. "
450,21," Another Exxon document relied on by Transnor discusses the tax spinning strategies of Shell and BP, making statements 
such as ""believe BP is selling equity; buying cheapest alternative."""
450,22," Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15 (1976) provides that, ""any person who shall be injured in his business or property 
by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor . . . and shall recover threefold the damages by him 
sustained."""
450,23," Defendants maintain that ""Transnor's case depends on its ability to prove as fact that defendants traded at below-market."" 
Defendants' Reply Brief at 2. Since a violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act occurs when there is even an unconsummated 
agreement in restraint of trade, see American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U.S. 781, 789, 90 L. Ed. 1575, 66 S. Ct. 1125 
(1946); United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 225 n. 59, 84 L. Ed. 1129, 60 S. Ct. 811 (1940), the Court will 
address the issue of causation in those terms. "
451,24," The parties have agreed to enter into a stipulation as to the terms of Exxon's, Conoco's, SUKO's and SITCO's contracts for the 
purchase and sale of crude oil, and have agreed, where supported by documentary evidence, on the contract's date of entry, 
price, grade, and month of delivery. No agreement has yet been reached with respect to BP contracts. The prices, dates and 
delivery months of non-defendant transactions were derived from Petroleum Argus Ltd. (""Argus""), a London-based spot market 
crude oil reporting service which gathers its information directly from market participants, which the parties have agreed to 
stipulate are accurate."
451,25," Transnor does not contradict this conclusion. When Fisher performed the same calculations using the same time period as 
Darracott's calculations, defendants were found to have traded an average of 0.96 cents above non-defendants. "
452,26," Transnor provides evidence that other market participants were unaware of the extent of tax spinning. For example, Exxon 
trader Sharp testified that non-participants in the tax spin did not know whether a given transaction was a tax spin or not. This 
was confirmed by Morgan Stanley trader Nancy Kropp, who stated that she could not tell what percentage of Exxon's or 
Conoco's trades were tax spins. "
453,27," Defendants note that market analysts and commentators in late 1985 and early 1986 overwhelmingly attributed the price 
decline to OPEC. One piece of evidence which defendants provide is a January 1986 telex written by E. Roy Moor, a principal of 
Transnor, in which he stated that Transnor had ""become increasingly concerned about the price distortions created in the crude 
oil markets by the impact of refined product netback related crude oil and in particular the effects of increased Saudi Arabia 
crude oil production/netback sales."" Moor Exh. 81."
453,28," in Robinson's deposition, taken before he submitted these calculations, he testified that he was ""not sure"" how to make these 
calculations and had seen no literature which explained the principles to apply. Robinson Dep. 258-59. Although Robinson 
claims that the market had fully adjusted to OPEC policy by January 1986, he also attributes a $ 2.00 per barrel price drop to 
reaction to a March 1986 OPEC meeting. Thus, it appears that, contrary to his earlier statements, Robinson claims that tax 
spinning accounted for a $ 13.00, not a $ 15.00, drop in price per barrel."
453,29," ""HN20[
] Contracts of sale"" is defined as ""sales, agreements of sale, and agreements to sell."" 7 U.S.C. § 2 (1976). ""HN21[
] Commodity"" is broadly defined to include, among others, ""all other goods and articles . . ., and all services, rights, and 
interests in which contracts for future delivery presently or in the future dealt in."" Id. Defendants do not contest that the Brent 
transactions were contracts of sale of commodities as defined by section 2(a)(1) of the Act."
453,30," HN22[
] Cash commodity contracts for deferred shipment or delivery are commonly known as ""cash forward contracts,"" 
whereas contracts of sale of a commodity for future delivery are called ""futures contracts."" See H.R.Rep.No. 93-975, 93rd Cong., 
2d Sess. 129-30 (1974). "
454,31," The Commission intends to adopt regulations concerning the scope of the forward contract's jurisdictional exclusion in a future 
release. 54 Fed. Reg. 1128, 1130 n. 14 (""Proposed Rules Concerning Regulation of Hybrid Instruments"") (CFTC January 11, 
1989)."
454,32," A ""dry"" or ""paper"" deal refers to the purchase or sale of a claim on a cargo of Brent in some future month."
454,33," A ""wet"" deal refers to a physical transaction in which a specific cargo actually changes hands. "
455,34," During the hearings prior to enactment of the CEA's predecessor, the Futures Trading Act, which sought to bring federal 
control to futures trading, witnesses expressed concern that there were a variety of legitimate off-exchange commercial 
transactions, such as cash grain contracts between farmers and grain elevator operators for the future delivery of grain, in which 
delivery of the commodity was delayed. Then-Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace urged preservation of the right to buy or 
sell next season's crop which had not yet been planted or harvested but which would exist at the delayed delivery date. 1921 
Senate Hearings at 462. Senator Capper, the sponsor of the Senate version of the bill, also stated that the bill dealt only with 
transactions in which the transfer of actual grain was not contemplated and that the entire business of sales or purchases of 
actual grain, either for present or future delivery, is expressly excluded from coverage. 61 Cong. Rec. 4762, 67th Cong., 1st 
Sess. (Aug. 9, 1921); Co Petro, 680 F.2d at 578."
455,35," A House Report on the recent amendments focused on the ""inherent value"" of the commodity to the buyer because of the 
nature of his business in reselling, distributing, manufacturing or otherwise dealing with the underlying commodity. See Co Petro, 
680 F.2d at 578. "
457,36," Nor will finding the 15-day Brent transactions to constitute futures contracts effectively eliminate the CEA's forward contract 
exception. The intentions of the parties still govern and the opportunity to satisfy a contract through means other than delivery is 
alone insufficient to categorize the nature of the transaction."
457,37," The Commission outlines additional elements characteristic of exchange-traded futures contracts, the ""presence or absence 
[of which] is not dispositive of whether a transaction is a futures contract."" Policy Statement Concerning Swap Transactions, 
supra, at 30694-95. Accordingly, defendants' claim that the absence of certain of these elements dooms Transnor's off-
exchange contracts is spurious at best. "
459,38," Campbell's footnote does nothing more than explain the distinction between two risks in a completely unrelated 10(b)(5) 
securities claim."
459,39," Moreover, HN30[
] section 4c(a)(A)'s broad prohibition of any transaction "". . . of the character of, or commonly known to the 
trade as, a 'wash sale,'"" suggests that negating market risk sufficiently eliminates any significant risk to fall within the prohibition."
459,40," Transnor also claims that defendants paired buy/sell transactions were prearranged. HN31[
] While prearrangement is not a 
necessary element for finding a wash sale violation, it is one method used to avoid a bona fide market position. See Collins II, at 
31,897. Because it is improbable that a pattern of matched orders or wash results represents the true interplay of market forces, 
the existence of such a pattern may ""raise an inference that the results were intentionally achieved by means of 
prearrangement."" Id. Defendants' matched transactions during the relevant period raise an inference of prearrangement, 
negating price competition, and would be grounds for denial of summary judgment even if the transactions were not deemed 
wash sales. Transnor also argues that defendants engaged in manipulative conduct by trading at artificially low prices. This contention, 
analyzed earlier in connection with Transnor's antitrust claims, need not be further discussed here. "
460,41," This Court rejects Transnor's proposition that Stoller recognizes that an illicit purpose indicates the existence of a wash sale. A 
clear reading reveals that the Second Circuit Court merely stated that wash sales had in the past been found in transactions 
motivated by illicit purposes, not that illegal motives mandate a finding of wash sales."
460,42," The Court rejects Transnor's argument that In re Gimbel, para. 24,313 at 35,003 n. 5, mandates abandonment of the 
legitimate market purpose test. That the Commission ""remains of the view"" that commercial motivations underlying transactions 
are not relevant, neither binds nor persuades this Court in light of the Second Circuit Court's ruling in Stoller, 834 F.2d at 266, 
which is also cited in the footnote. Stoller recognized that the statutory language permits the Commission to define its meaning 
although it may hold the public accountable only upon proper notification."
460,43," Stoller overrules a prior CFTC ruling, Collins II, at 31,896, that there is ""no basis in the statutory language of Section 4c(a) or 
the legislative history to imply an exception so that otherwise prohibited trading techniques, such as wash sales, would become 
acceptable when used for an alleged 'legitimate market purpose.'"" See In re Gimbel, 1988 CFTC LEXIS 204, at 3, n. 6."
460,44," Transnor's argument that OTO would never have accepted defendants' transactions had it been apprised of the true facts is 
beyond the scope of this inquiry. "

authoritative legislative history, a court should interpret the provision generously so as to effectuate the important congressional 
goals."" CIA. Petrolera Caribe, Inc. v. Arco Caribbean, Inc., 754 F. 2d 404, 428 (1985)."
482,5," HN2[
] The section provides in pertinent part: ""The several district courts of the United States are invested with jurisdiction to prevent and restrain violations of this Act, and it 
shall be the duty of the several United States attorneys, in their respective districts, under the direction of the Attorney General,

forth the case and praying that such violation shall be enjoined or otherwise prohibited.  When the parties complained of shall 
have been duly notified of such petition, the court shall proceed, as soon as may be, to the hearing and determination of the

of irreparable loss of damage is immediate, a preliminary injunction may issue . . . ."" 15 U.S.C. § 26. "
483,7," That the two provisions do differ is not surprising at all, since § 15 was largely copied from § 4 of the Sherman Act, see 26 Stat.

v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., 479 U.S. 104 (1986) -- had no counterpart in the Sherman Act."
483,8," LEdHN[5C][
] [5C] Indeed, the evident import of Congress' reference to ""threatened loss or damage"" is not to constrict the availability of injunctive 
remedies against violations that have already begun or occurred, but rather to expand their availability against harms that are as 
yet unrealized.  See Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U.S. 100, 130, and n. 24 (1969)."
483,9," The District Court in the IT&T case had observed that ""'[i]f it were necessary to strain terminology in order to accomplish the 
same result, a court could easily phrase a ""negative injunction"" in such terms as to enjoin the activities of a corporation to such a 
degree that divestiture would be the only economical choice available to that corporation.'"" 518 F. 2d, at 924. The Court of 
Appeals admitted the force of this observation, agreeing with the District Court that the Standard Oil dissolution decree, 
Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States, 221 U.S. 1, 78 (1911), served as an example of an ""'indirect' divestiture 
decre[e]."" 518 F. 2d, at 924. "
484,10," Notably, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit did not rely on either of the textual arguments that American has advanced 
here.  Had it done so, it would have been forced to acknowledge a distinction between direct divestiture and indirect divestiture."
484,11," In the context of construing the FTC's authority to issue such ""cease and desist"" orders, this Court -- speaking through Justice 
McReynolds, who had served as President Wilson's chief antitrust enforcement officer at the time the Clayton Act was framed -- 
had no difficulty finding that the continuing ownership of stock unlawfully acquired was itself a continuing violation of the Act: ""The order here questioned was entered when respondent actually held and owned the stock contrary to law.  The 
Commission's duty was to prevent the continuance of this unlawful action by an order directing that it cease and desist therefrom 
and divest itself of what it had no right to hold.  Further violations of the Act through continued ownership could be effectively 
prevented only by requiring the owner wholly to divest itself of the stock and thus render possible once more free play of the 
competition which had been wrongfully suppressed."" FTC v. Western Meat Co., 272 U.S. 554, 559 (1926) (McReynolds, J.). The suggestion that continuing ownership of stock unlawfully acquired might constitute a ""further violatio[n] of the Act"" would 
cast some doubt upon the utility of American's distinction between mandatory and prohibitory injunctions even were we inclined 
to accept the relevance of that distinction.  As we reject the distinction, we have, however, no cause to pursue this line of inquiry 
further. "
485,12," The Taft Administration received the decisions warmly, but they provoked bitter criticism from the Democratic Party leadership.  
Antitrust policy was sharply debated during the 1912 Presidential campaign.  See W. Letwin, Law and Economic Policy in 
America 266, 269 (1965).  Upon becoming Woodrow Wilson's first Attorney General shortly thereafter, James McReynolds 
promised to deliver dissolutions ""free from the fundamental defect in the plans adopted in the Standard Oil and Tobacco cases 
where the separate parts into which the business was divided were left under the control of the same stockholders."" Annual 
Report of Attorney General, H.R. Doc. No. 460, 63d Cong., 2d Sess., 7 (1913)."
485,13," An amendment passed by the Senate, but rejected by the House, provided: ""That whenever a corporation shall acquire or consolidate the ownership or control of the plants, franchises, or property of other

the court rendering such judgment shall decree its dissolution and shall to that end appoint receivers to wind up its affairs and 
shall cause all of its assets to be sold in such manner and to such persons as will, in the opinion of the court, restore competition 
as fully and completely as it was before said corporation or combination began to be formed.  The court shall reserve in its 
decree jurisdiction over said assets so sold for a sufficient time to satisfy the court that full and free competition is restored and 
assured."" 51 Cong. Rec. 15863 (1914). "
486,14," People v. North River Sugar Refining Co., 121 N.Y. 582, 608, 24 N.E. 834 (1890). The New York attorney general had sought 
dissolution of the company for its participation in the sugar trust, relying upon two theories: that dissolution was appropriate 
because the company had violated the terms of its charter by entering the trust, and that dissolution was appropriate under the 
state antitrust laws. The Court of Appeals agreed that dissolution was appropriate on the first ground, and so declined to reach 
the second.  Id., at 626, 24 N.E., at 841. Judge Finch, writing for a unanimous court, began the opinion by announcing, ""The judgment sought against the defendant is 
one of corporate death."" Id., at 608, 24 N.E., at 834. He then said that although the ""life of a corporation is indeed less than that 
of the humblest citizen,"" ""destruction of the corporate life"" may not be effected ""without clear and abundant reason."" Ibid. The 
ensuing opinion bristles with the rhetoric of moral condemnation; when characterizing the corporation's defense, for example, 
Judge Finch commented that the court had been asked ""to separate in our thought the soul from the body, and admitting the 
sins of the latter to adjudge that the former remains pure."" Id., at 626, 24 N.E., at 837."
486,15," See n. 13, supra.  Senator Reed, the sponsor of the Senate amendment which would have expressly authorized dissolution 
proceedings, stated that the statute's dissolution remedy should guarantee that ""we shall have a real decree, that there shall be 
a real burial, and that we shall sod down the grave upon the monster that was created in defiance of law, but that we shall at the 
same time preserve its parts and restore them to competition and activity . . . ."" 51 Cong. Rec. 15864 (1914). "
487,16," There is a common core to present-day and early 20th-century understandings of the distinction between dissolution and 
divestiture: ""As applied in both early and more recent antitrust cases, 'dissolution' refers to an antitrust judgment which dissolves or 
terminates an illegal combination or association -- putting it out of business, so to speak.  'Divestiture' is used to refer to 
situations where the defendants are required to divest or dispossess themselves of specified property in physical facilities, 
securities, or other assets."" Oppenheim, Divestiture as a Remedy Under the Federal Antitrust Laws, 19 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 119, 
120 (1950). Nevertheless, for at least the past four decades dissolution and divestiture have been treated as interchangeable terms in 
antitrust law.  See United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 366 U.S. 316, 330, n. 11 (1961) (terms are to a ""large 
degree interchangeable""); see also Oppenheim, 19 Geo. Wash. L. Rev., at 121 (recognizing technical distinction between terms, 
but treating them as interchangeable nonetheless). During the first decades of this century, however, ""dissolution"" was the favored term for a remedy that put an end to an unlawful 
combination and ""divestiture"" was rarely mentioned in the antitrust context.  The early 20th-century treatise writers seem to have 
spoken exclusively in terms of dissolution. See, e.g., W. Thornton, A Treatise on the Sherman Anti-Trust Act § 372 (1913).  Not 
surprisingly, all of the legislative history cited by the parties to this case refers to dissolution, not to divestiture. Yet even without using the term ""divestiture,"" Congress could and did recognize the appropriateness of a divestiture remedy in 
merger cases: § 11 of the Clayton Act expressly authorizes the FTC to order a defendant corporation to ""divest itself of the stock 
held . . . contrary to the provisions of sectio[n] seven . . . of this Act."" 38 Stat. 735.  Indeed, the term ""divestiture"" appears to have 
entered the antitrust vocabulary as a consequence of FTC proceedings against alleged violators of § 7 of the Act.  See, e.g., 
Arrow-Hart & Hegeman Electric Co. v. FTC, 291 U.S. 587 (1934); FTC v. Western Meat Co., 272 U.S. 554 (1926). Use of the 
term in those cases is unsurprising, for the text of the Act suggested that ""divestiture,"" rather than ""dissolution,"" was the remedy 
being sought. By 1944, Justice Douglas was using the two terms in close proximity, see United States v. Crescent Amusement Co., 323 U.S. 
173, 188-189 (1944) (Sherman Act case), although it is at least arguable that his usage preserved the technical distinction that 
was to be generally elided less than a decade later.  Cf.  Swift & Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 311, 319 (1928) (referring to 
""divestiture of the instrumentalities"" in a case raising both Sherman Act and Clayton Act claims).  It would appear that, as the 
moral conception of dissolution lost favor and divestiture decrees became paradigmatic of dissolution remedies, the two 
concepts were collapsed into one another."

488,26," Congress could, of course, have referred expressly to the divestiture remedy, as was done in § 11 of the Act, directing that the 
FTC shall require a violator of § 7 to ""divest itself of the stock"" unlawfully acquired.  There was, however, no reason for Congress 
to itemize the various remedies which might be available in a § 16 suit.  Moreover, while divestiture might be the appropriate 
remedy in every § 7 case prosecuted by the FTC, there is no reason to believe that the same would be true in private § 7 cases.

489,28," Professors Areeda and Turner have criticized the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on the ground that it did not correctly

the Court of Appeals ""cannot bear the weight the court placed upon it, when the reports of the relevant House and Senate 
committees were silent on the point, which also did not appear to have been mentioned on the House or Senate floor."" They 
point out that ""other courts have indicated, correctly, that divestiture is available in a private suit challenging unlawful mergers,""

by a private plaintiff."" 2 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law § 328b (1978) (footnotes omitted).  Other commentators have

497,1," Film distributors do not hand out prints for free; they sell exhibition licenses. These licenses normally specify a percentage of 
weekly house receipts, known as license fees, payable by the theatre owner to the distributor. Where more than one theatre in a 
given area volunteers to pay the license fee for a particular film, the distributor has several options: It can license the film to more 
than one theatre in the area; it can award the film to a particular theatre with which it has an ongoing relationship; or it can let 
them all bid for exclusive exhibition rights. Where the distributor adopts the competitive bidding approach, as virtually all 
distributors did in Las Vegas prior to October 1984, the high bid usually includes a guarantee -- a minimum fee payable to the 
distributor even if the film bombs. As bidding in Las Vegas grew more fierce, guarantee amounts went over the top. Too often, the bids were so high that theatre 
owners ran up substantial losses. The industry refers to these as busted guarantees, meaning that because the film did less 
business than was expected, the theatre was trapped into paying the higher guarantee amount instead of the percentage of box 
office it had negotiated. Occasionally, guarantees in Las Vegas were so high that they exceeded the gate at a particular theatre."

96 (1977). Given this reality, it would be perverse to expect rivals engaged in head on competition to act like best friends; 
indeed, it would be cause for suspicion if they did. "
499,6," We have previously held that HN9[
] a district court acts within the legitimate scope of its discretion in determining that 
evidence of a high market share establishes a prima facie antitrust violation, shifting to the defendant the burden of rebutting the 
prima facie violation. See California v. American Stores Co., 872 F.2d 837, 842 (9th Cir. 1989), reversed on other grounds, 495 
U.S. 271, 110 S. Ct. 1853, 109 L. Ed. 2d 240 (1990). The converse is not true, however; evidence of a high market share does 
not require a district court to conclude that there is an antitrust violation. In fact, such a conclusion normally should not be drawn 
where the evidence also indicates that there is no barrier to entry into the relevant market. See Oahu Gas Serv., Inc. v. Pacific 
Resources, Inc., 838 F.2d 360, 366 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 870 109 S. Ct. 180, 102 L. Ed. 2d 149 (1988); accord 
American Stores, 872 F.2d at 842 (""An absence of entry barriers into a market constrains anticompetitive conduct, irrespective of 
the market's degree of concentration.""). The explanation is simple; where entry barriers are low, market share does not 
accurately reflect the party's market power.  United States v. Waste Mgmt., Inc., 743 F.2d 976, 982-83 (2d Cir. 1984)."
499,7," Second-run films are the same as first-run films, only older. When a film is initially released for public exhibition, it is in its first 
run. Once public demand for the film has fallen off (but usually before it is reduced to a dead calm), the first-run theatre will ship 
it out to make room for something more recent. The film may then open elsewhere in the same area, usually at a lower ticket 
price, this being the film's second run. "
500,8," The government argues that the district court's finding that ""Roberts was a successful competitor of Syufy in Las Vegas,"" 
United States v. Syufy Enters., 712 F. Supp. 1386, 1393 (N.D.Cal. 1989) (emphasis added), is clearly erroneous because it 
conflicts with a stipulation that ""Roberts was not an effective competitor."" United States v. Syufy Enters., No. C-86-3057-WHO at 
6 (N.D.Cal. Nov. 3, 1988) (Stipulated Facts) (emphasis added). We see no reason to resolve this semantic squabble. The 
stipulation on which the government relies goes on to state that ""Roberts expanded its operation in Las Vegas from five screens 
in 1983 to 28 screens in 1987."" Id. It is this fact that colors our conclusion, not the particular adjective selected by the parties or 
by the district court. The stipulation -- even if read as the government suggests -- does not undermine the district court's separate findings that United 
Artists, Roberts' successor, ""competes vigorously with Syufy, a substantially smaller chain,"" that UA is ""much more successful 
than was Roberts because of its substantial 'clout' with distributors,"" and that UA could, if it wished to, compete with Syufy even 
more vigorously.  712 F. Supp. at 1394. All of this amply supports the district court's determination that Syufy faces substantial 
competition."
500,9," The government also challenges the district court's definition of the relevant upstream product market in Las Vegas. The court 
defined the market broadly to include not only first-run theatrical exhibition, but also ""exhibition on home video, cable television, 
and pay-per-view television."" 712 F. Supp. at 1389. We agree with the government that this is not the proper market definition in 
examining Syufy's power over film distributors. While moviegoers may well view these alternative methods of film exhibition as 
readily substitutable, film distributors do not. Distributors use first-run theatrical exhibition to make sure that audiences are 
exposed to a film so that, even if it gets bad reviews and fails to turn a profit in theatres, people switching channels or checking 
out videos will recognize the title and be induced by its fame to watch it. That first-run theatrical exhibition enhances a film's 
performance in auxiliary markets does not mean that auxiliary markets can substitute for theatrical release. The district court was 
therefore mistaken in relying on testimony that ""of the 578 films produced in 1987, 214 were released on home video and not in 
the theatres,"" id. at 1400, as there was no suggestion that any of these 214 films were suitable for theatrical release, or that any 
film has ever been released first on home video and then later played in first-run theaters. Jane Fonda's Low Impact Aerobic 
Workout may be a best-selling videocassette, but it is unlikely to be the hit at a local movie theatre. The district court's erroneous definition of the relevant upstream product market does not warrant reversal, however. The district 
court repeatedly made alternative findings using the government's narrower market definition limited solely to first-run exhibition. 
Our review of the record convinces us that these alternative findings are supported by substantial evidence."
500,10," The district court was entitled to rely on any of several indicia of Syufy's market share, including its percentage of first-run 
films, its percentage of first-run playdates and its percentage of gross box office receipts. As each of these indices points in the 
same direction -- toward Syufy's decreasing market share -- we fail to understand what the government hopes to gain by arguing 
that box office receipts are the only meaningful indicator of market share. "
501,," In any event, we are unable to agree with the government on this issue. By focusing exclusively on box office receipts, the 
government attributes to Syufy a prescience he does not possess. No one, not even Syufy, can accurately predict how every 
movie will do at the box office. As demonstrated by the large number of busted guarantees, exhibitors in Las Vegas often had 
great expectations for films that eventually disappeared without a trace. That does not necessarily mean that the films were bad 
or that the theatres that played them did not want them very much; it simply means that the exhibitor did not have perfect 
foresight. Thus, for example, the government stepped out of bounds in disparaging Powwow Highway. See Reply Brief for 
Appellant at 7-8 n. 7. While somewhat off beat, the film garnered terrific reviews and captured the Filmmakers Trophy at the 
Sundance United States Film Festival in Park City, Utah. LA Times, Jan. 31, 1989, at VI-7, col. 4. Film critic Sheila Benson 
described it as ""a little zinger of a comedy with a rare backbone of intelligence""; ""a pretty irresistible movie . . . that fixes [itself] 
permanently in our affections."" LA Times, March 17, 1989, at VI-1, col. 2, VI-16, col. 1. See also L. Maltin, Leonard Maltin's TV 
Movies & Video Guide 204 (1989). Reviews this good are not common; some theatre operators, seeing that a movie had 
become the critic's choice, might well be willing to go for the longshot rather than the sure thing."
501,11," The Antitrust Division's Merger Guidelines adopt a two-year test in determining whether there are barriers to entry in a market: 
if successful entry is likely within two years, there are no significant entry barriers, and the government will not challenge 
mergers in that market. Merger Guidelines § 3.3, reprinted in 4Trade Reg. Rep. (CCH) P 13,103 at 20,562 (1988). Had the 
government applied the two-year test here, it surely would not have pursued this suit against Syufy. The critical acquisition 
occurred in October 1984; by December 1986, Roberts had not only successfully entered the market, it was operating five more 
first-run screens than was Syufy."
501,12," The Justice Department argues that it is expensive to build a multiplex, but the district court was rightly unimpressed by this 
contention. Syufy was neither the first nor the last to open a multiplex in Las Vegas: Cragin's 11-screen Redrock was there 
before Syufy came into the market and, soon thereafter, Roberts opened three multiplexes in quick succession. In fact, Roberts 
was spared the expense of construction, as several of its theatres were financed by shopping center developers from whom 
Roberts later leased space. See RT 2:254-55, 2:261, 2:272-73, 2:278-79."
501,13," The Justice Department claims that the district court misunderstood the evidence on this point. It argues that Las Vegas is 
""overscreened,"" i.e., that potential competitors declined to enter the market because there was not enough business to go 
around. The district court made detailed contrary findings: The rule of thumb in the film industry is that it takes 10,000 people to 
support one screen. Las Vegas is populated by approximately 600,000 residents and 100,000 tourists at any given time, leaving 
room for as many as 70 screens. Yet, at the time of trial, there were only 50 first-run screens in the city, meaning that the Las 
Vegas market offered ample opportunities to potential entrants. In addition, Las Vegas is a boom town, growing at the rate of 
30,000 people a year. Thus, the potential for new entry into the first-run film market will continue. RT 2:300, 3:338, 6:989. 
""Because untapped potential provides a mouth-watering incentive for vigorous competition, it is axiomatic that monopoly power "
502,," is unlikely to arise in dynamic industries marked by a rapidly expanding volume of demand and low barriers to entry."" Metro 
Mobile CTS, Inc. v. NewVector Commun., Inc., 892 F.2d 62, 63 (9th Cir. 1989). More fundamentally, the government's static model, which assumes that there is only so much demand for a particular product, 
is alien to modern economic theory, as well as common sense, which teach us that things change. The demand for movie tickets 
can fluctuate with a variety of factors such as price, quality of the movie theatre, cost of related goods such as concession stand 
products, and quality of films shown. Even assuming that the Las Vegas movie market was, in some static sense, operating at 
capacity, the entry of a new competitor might, as the district court found, simply result in ""the exit of some of the less attractive 
and less efficient theatres in Las Vegas."" 712 F. Supp. at 1396. Or, a new competitor with high hopes might price movie tickets 
lower, increase advertising, provide more convenient parking facilities, or otherwise induce people to go to the movies more 
often. Or, a theatre operator might hit the jackpot by catering to parents of small children who might be more likely to patronize 
drive-in theatres. We cannot and should not speculate as to the details of a potential competitor's performance; we need only 
determine whether there were barriers to the entry of new faces into the market. As we discuss in greater detail below, in making 
that determination we are not concerned with whether, once in the market, the competitor will wind up doing well. The thing to 
remember is that doing business in the crucible of free enterprise is inherently unpredictable."
502,14," In Alcoa, Judge Hand concluded that defendant corporation violated the antitrust laws simply by making all the right moves, in 
particular, by filling the demand of which it was the creator: True, it stimulated demand and opened new uses for the metal, but not without making sure that it could supply what it had 
evoked. . . . ""Alcoa"" avows it as evidence of the skill, energy and initiative with which it has always conducted its business; 
as a reason why, having won its way by fair means, it should be commended, and not dismembered. . . . We may assume 
that all it claims for itself is true. . . . [But] it was not inevitable that it should always anticipate increases in the demand for 
ingot and be prepared to supply them. Nothing compelled it to keep doubling and redoubling its capacity before others 
entered the field. It insists that it never excluded competitors; but we can think of no more effective exclusion than 
progressively to embrace each new opportunity as it opened, and to face every newcomer with new capacity already 
geared into a great organization, having the advantage of experience, trade connections and the elite of personnel. . . . 
That was to ""monopolize"" that market, however innocently it otherwise proceeded. "
502,148, F.2d at 430-32. 
503,15," The government points out that the interiors of United Artists' theatres were not as luxurious as those of Syufy. We have no 
clue what sinister inference the government would have us draw from this fact. As the district court noted, ""No one stopped 
United Artists from remodeling Roberts' theatres after it acquired them. As the largest exhibitor in the nation, it certainly has the 
resources to do so."" 712 F. Supp. at 1402. Competitors need not provide a perfectly undifferentiated product in order to be 
competitive; it is a strength of our free market economy that competitors often provide products that cater to the varied tastes 
and preferences of consumers. Syufy made a business decision to invest in luxury theatres while Roberts and United Artists 
apparently decided to dispose of their profits in some other fashions. It remains to be seen which strategy will ultimately prevail. 
Indeed, it is not a winner take all situation; in a free market, any number can play and any number can win. We therefore agree 
with the district court's refusal to conclude that this difference in business strategies was an indication of market failure. "
504,16," The government argues that the district court erred in finding this earlier level of competition to be ""unhealthy."" 712 F. Supp. at 
1394. While we agree, we need not reverse because of the insignificance of the error. The erroneous finding was relevant to 
only one of three elements needed to prove the government's attempted monopolization claim. As the government was unable 
to demonstrate that Syufy had the power to control prices or to exclude competition, it cannot prevail even though we disregard 
the district court's finding of unhealthy competition."
504,17," The list of Orion films that played exclusively at Roberts theaters also includes such popular fare as Amadeus, Back to School, 
Bull Durham, Colors, Hoosiers, Married to the Mob, Radio Days and the unforgettable Throw Momma From the Train. "
505,18," See generally A. Alchian & W. Allen, University Economics 270, 301 (1964); 2 P. Areeda & D. Turner, supra n. 5, § 407b, at 
286-87; R. Posner, supra slip op. at p. 6, at 318 n. 2, 368. In business, as elsewhere in life, it is sometimes true that the bigger 
they are, the harder they fall."
505,19," The Justice Department throws out a volley of numbers which, it claims, show that Syufy managed to depress license fees 
after buying out his competitors. The government attributes the lower fees to the exercise of monopoly power, but it is mistaken. 
The percentage of box office receipts paid to movie distributors rises and falls due to a combination of factors; it is not an 
accurate measure of the competitiveness of the market. For example, in 1985, Syufy paid Universal a very low license fee (48.1%). The fact is, however, Syufy paid more money to 
Universal that year than in any other from 1983 to 1988. The percentage only looks low because, in 1985, Universal released 
the hugely successful Back to the Future. The film played in Syufy's first-run theatres for more than six months; the longer a 
film's run, the lower the percentage of gross receipts payable to the distributor. Thus, the low percentage rate was based on 
factors other than monopoly power, as the district court quite reasonably found. Support is missing in the record for the Justice 
Department's theory of a shakedown by a ruthless predator."
505,20," Among them are the following: (1) the district court misdefined the relevant market; (2) the court did not understand that this 
was a monopsony case; (3) the court erred in looking beyond Syufy's large market share; (4) the court mistakenly looked at the 
number of first-run movies shown as indicative of market share; (5) the court was wrong to call the preacquisition level of 
competition ""unhealthy""; (6) aggressive competition is itself a barrier to entry; (7) Las Vegas is ""overscreened""; and (8) 
Roberts/United Artists' theatres are not as luxurious as Syufy's. "
506,21," Absent any power to exclude competition, the government cannot prevail on its claim of monopolization under Section 2 of the 
Sherman Act, as that requires a showing that Syufy possesses monopoly power. Similarly, the attempted monopolization claim 
fails because the government cannot show that there was a dangerous probability that Syufy would succeed in destroying 
competition. Finally, the lack of entry barriers prevents the government from prevailing on its Clayton Act claim, as Syufy's 
acquisition of its competitors was not likely to substantially lessen competition. In his concurrence, Judge Quackenbush complains that our focus on the lack of entry barriers is too narrow; he lists other 
factors that ought to be considered. Concurrence at 673. While we agree that these other factors are relevant, as explained in 
the preceding paragraph, the total lack of entry barriers in Las Vegas determines the outcome of these factors in this case: 
Because others easily could (and did) enter the market successfully, Syufy lacked ""the ability to maintain [market] share, the 
power to control prices, [and] the capability of excluding competitors."" Id. Judge Quackenbush suggests that, under our holding, no one having ""less than 100 percent of market share"" could ever have a 
monopoly ""since the existence of competitors in the market would apparently establish the lack of barriers to entry."" 
Concurrence at 674. We respectfully disagree. Entry barriers pertain not to those already in the market, but to those who would 
enter but are prevented from doing so. See Merger Guidelines § 3.3, reprinted in 4Trade Reg.Rep. (CCH) P 13,103 at 20,562 
(1988) (focusing on difficulty of ""entry into a market""). Thus, a market containing two firms, each having a 50% share, could well 
be deemed monopolistic if entry barriers prevented other firms from gaining a foothold."
506,22," The concurrence disputes our benign characterization of Syufy, relying largely on his conduct in another market. Concurrence 
slip op. at 4554-55. As a general matter, we do not agree with this logic. Antitrust violations must be judged on a market-by-
market basis. That Syufy may have been guilty of some impropriety in the past would not justify the government's decision to 
pursue a drawn-out legal battle as to his conduct in Las Vegas unless there was substantial evidence of wrongdoing in Las 
Vegas. In any event, Syufy Enters. v. American Multicinema, Inc., 793 F.2d 990 (9th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1031, 93 L. Ed. 
2d 830, 107 S. Ct. 876 (1987), on which Judge Quackenbush relies, does not support his point; rather, it supports ours. In 
American Multicinema, we reversed an antitrust jury verdict against Syufy for insufficient evidence. See 793 F.2d at 1001-03. 
Given the infrequency with which we reverse jury verdicts, the Antitrust Division might have considered this, if at all, as a sign 
that Syufy was not the evildoer he was made out to be. "

Distrib. Corp. v. Syufy Enters., 829 F.2d 946 (9th Cir. 1987); Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp. v. MCA, Inc., 715 F.2d 1327 (9th

507,24," We are aware, of course, that even in a monopoly situation competitors may buy each other out where the selling company is 
failing. See United States v. General Dynamics Corp., 415 U.S. 486, 507, 39 L. Ed. 2d 530, 94 S. Ct. 1186 (1974); F. & M. 
Schaefer Corp. v. C. Schmidt & Sons, Inc., 597 F.2d 814, 817-18 (2d Cir. 1979). But establishing a failing company defense is 
not easy; a competitor must be in critical condition to be subject to acquisition under that doctrine. In a competitive market, 
however, there is no need to rely on a failing company defense, and the ability to buy out competitors who are merely ailing may 
well promote market efficiency, enhance consumer welfare and foster competition. "
509,1," In Part 3 of the opinion, the majority, in footnote 21, construes my citation of a prior case involving Syufy Enterprises, in which 
Syufy was found to be a monopolist, as a suggestion on my part that such a finding of prior monopolistic action, in and of itself, 
justified the initiation of this action. That was not my intent. The citation of the case in question, Syufy Enterprises v. American 
Multicinema, Inc., 793 F.2d 990 (9th Cir. 1986), was for the purpose of demonstrating that Syufy, who spent almost 5 million 
dollars in cash in purchasing all of his competitors, was not a ""paper tiger"" as suggested by the majority. In footnote 22, the majority also contends that the finding of monopolistic actions by Syufy in the San Jose major feature films 
market was reversed by the Ninth Circuit in American Multicinema for insufficient evidence. To the contrary, this jury finding was 
found to have been supported by substantial evidence. At page 996 of American Multicinema, the court stated: ""In conclusion, 
we hold that there is substantial evidence to support a jury verdict in favor of AMC on its first Section 2 monopolization theory; 
that Syufy monopolized the market for the exhibition of industry anticipated top-grossing films in the San Jose area."" "

was illegal because it restricted vigorous competition among dealers. The restraint in Kiefer-Stewart had an additional horizontal 
component, however, see Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Society, 457 U.S. 332, 348, n. 18 (1982), since the agreement

the maximum-price agreements could be to eliminate retailers and ultimately to reduce competition.  859 F. 2d, at 694, 696. We 
disagree.  Rivals cannot be excluded in the long run by a nonpredatory maximum-price scheme unless they are relatively 
inefficient.  Even if that were false, however, a firm cannot claim antitrust injury from nonpredatory price competition on the 
asserted ground that it is ""ruinous."" Cf.  United States v. Topco Associates, Inc., 405 U.S. 596, 610-612 (1972); United States v. 
Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 220-221 (1940). ""[T]he statutory policy precludes inquiry into the question whether

of some elements of price competition distorts the markets, and harms all the participants."" 859 F. 2d, at 694. Every antitrust 
violation can be assumed to ""disrupt"" or ""distort"" competition.  ""[O]therwise, there would be no violation."" P. Areeda & H. 
Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law para. 340.3b, p. 411 (1989 Supp.).  Respondent's theory would equate injury in fact with antitrust 
injury.  We declined to adopt such an approach in Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat., Inc., 429 U.S. 477 (1977), and 
Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., 479 U.S. 104 (1986), and we reject it again today.  The antitrust injury requirement 
cannot be met by broad allegations of harm to the ""market"" as an abstract entity.  Although all antitrust violations, under both the 
per se rule and rule-of-reason analysis, ""distort"" the market, not every loss stemming from a violation counts as antitrust injury."
526,9," LEdHN[1K][
] [1K] This is not to deny that a vertical price-fixing scheme may facilitate predatory pricing. A supplier, for example, can reduce its 
prices to its own downstream dealers and share the losses with them, while forcing competing dealers to bear by themselves the 
full loss imposed by the lower prices.  Cf.  FTC v. Sun Oil Co., 371 U.S. 505, 522 (1963). But because a firm always is able to 
challenge directly a rival's pricing as predatory, there is no reason to dispense with the antitrust injury requirement in an action 
by a competitor against a vertical agreement. "
527,10," LEdHN[5D][
] [5D] We did not reach a contrary conclusion in Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574 (1986), where 
we declined define precisely the term ""predatory pricing"" but stated instead that ""[f]or purposes of this case it is enough to note 
that respondents have not suffered an antitrust injury unless petitioners conspired to drive respondents out of the relevant 
markets by (i) pricing below the level necessary to sell their products, or (ii) pricing below some appropriate measure of cost."" 
Id., at 585, n. 8. This statement does not imply that losses from nonpredatory pricing might qualify as antitrust injury; we were 
quite careful to limit our discussion in that case to predatory pricing. See ibid. (nonpredatory prices would not cause antitrust 
injury because they would ""leave respondents in the same position as would market forces"").  We noted that ""[e]xcept for the 
alleged conspiracy to monopolize the . . . market through predatory pricing, these alleged conspiracies could not have caused 
respondents to suffer an 'antitrust injury.'"" Id., at 586. We also observed that ""respondents must show that the conspiracy 
caused them an injury for which the antitrust laws provide relief.  That showing depends in turn on proof that petitioners 
conspired to price predatorily in the American market, caused such an injury."" Id., at 584, n. 7 (citations omitted); see also Id., at 
id., at 594; Cargill, supra, at 117, n. 12 (interpreting our decision in Matsushita).  We have no occasion in the instant case to 
consider the proper definition of predatory pricing, nor to determine whether our dictum in Matsushita that predatory pricing 
might consist of ""pricing below the level necessary to sell [the offender's] products,"" 475 U.S., at 585, n. 8, is an accurate 
statement of the law.  See n. 3, supra."
527,11," The Court of Appeals purported to distinguish Cargill and Brunswick on the ground that those cases turned on an ""attenuated 
or indirect"" relationship between the alleged violation -- the illegal merger -- and the plaintiffs' injury.  859 F. 2d, at 695. We 
disagree.  The Court in both cases described the injury as flowing directly from the alleged antitrust violation. See Cargill, 479

528,13," LEdHN[13B][
] [13B] When a manufacturer provides a dealer an exclusive area within which to distribute a product, the manufacturer's decision to fix 
a maximum resale price may actually protect consumers against exploitation by the dealer acting as a local monopolist.  The 
manufacturer acts not out of altruism, of course, but out of a desire to increase its own sales -- whereas the dealer's incentive, 
like that of any monopolist, is to reduce output and increase price.  If an exclusive dealership is the most efficient means of 
distribution, the public is not served by forcing the manufacturer to abandon this method and resort to self-distribution or 
competing distributors. Vertical, maximum price fixing thus may have procompetitive interbrand effects even if it is per se illegal 
because of its potential effects on dealers and consumers. See Albrecht v. Herald Co., 390 U.S. 145, 159 (1968) (Harlan, J., 
dissenting) (maximum price ceilings ""do not lessen horizontal competition"" but instead ""drive prices toward the level that would 
be set by intense competition,"" by ""prevent[ing] retailers or wholesalers from reaping monopoly or supercompetitive profits"").  
Indeed, we acknowledged in Albrecht that ""[m]aximum and minimum price fixing may have different consequences in many 
situations."" Id., at 152. The procompetitive potential of a vertical maximum price restraint is more evident now than it was when 
Albrecht was decided, because exclusive territorial arrangements and other nonprice restrictions were unlawful per se in 1968.  
See id., at 154; United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co., 388 U.S. 365, 375-376 (1967). These agreements are currently subject 
only to rule-of-reason scrutiny, making monopolistic behavior by dealers more likely.  See Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service 
Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 761 (1984); Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 47-59 (1977). Many commentators have identified procompetitive effects of vertical, maximum price fixing. See, e.g., P. Areeda & H.

first, that after the challenged merger petitioners' company would be able to lower its prices because it would be more efficient; 
and second, that it might attempt to drive respondent out of business by engaging in sustained predatory pricing. We rejected 
the first theory because independent decisions to reduce prices based on efficiencies are legal and precisely what the antitrust 
laws are intended to encourage.  Id., at 116-117. We rejected the second theory because respondent ""neither raised nor proved 
any claim of predatory pricing before the District Court."" Id., at 119. However, in discussing the second theory, we recognized 
that predatory pricing ""is a practice that harms both competitors and competition,"" and because it aims at ""the elimination of 
competition . . . . is thus a practice 'inimical to the purposes of [the antitrust] laws,' Brunswick, 429 U.S., at 488, and one capable 
of inflicting antitrust injury."" Id., at 117-118 (footnote omitted).  Again, a competitor suffers the same ""antitrust injury"" from an 
illegal conspiracy setting prices designed to eliminate it as it would suffer from a single firm setting predatory prices."

enough to support even an indirect action by a patient of the competitor. Petitioners, a medical insurance company and an 
organization of psychiatrists, conspired in violation of § 1 to compensate patients for the services of psychiatrists, but not those 
of psychologists.  We recognized that if patients had chosen to go to psychiatrists, the ""antitrust injury would have been borne in 
the first instance by the [psychologist] competitors of the conspirators."" Id., at 483. Instead, patient McCready went to a 
psychologist at her own expense.  We held that ""[a]lthough McCready was not a competitor of the conspirators, the injury she

declines to define predatory pricing for the purpose of the § 4 inquiry it creates today, ante, at 341, n. 10.  Predatory pricing by a 
conspiracy, rather than a single actor, may result from more than pricing below an appropriate measure of cost.  See Matsushita

534,15," Indeed, the Court elsewhere acknowledges that ""'[m]aximum and minimum price fixing may have different consequences in 
many situations.'"" Ante, at 343, n. 13 (quoting Albrecht, 390 U.S., at 152). This is quite true.  See, e.g., Arizona v. Maricopa 
County Medical Society, 457 U.S. 332, 348 (1982) (the per se rule against maximum prices guards against the elimination of 
competition, discouraging entry into the market, deterring experimentation, and allowing hidden price setting); Continental T.V., 
Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 51, n. 18 (1977) (vertical price fixing reduces interbrand and intrabrand competition and 
may facilitate cartelizing).  In Sylvania, the Court also recognized that ""Congress recently has expressed its approval of a per se 
analysis of vertical price restrictions by repealing those provisions of the Miller-Tydings and McGuire Acts allowing fair-trade 
pricing at the option of the individual States."" Ibid. See also White Motor Co. v. United States, 372 U.S. 253, 268 (1963) "
535,," (BRENNAN, J., concurring) (""Resale price maintenence is not only designed to, but almost invariably does in fact, reduce price 
competition not only among sellers of the affected product, but quite as much between that product and competing brands"")."
535,16," The Court grudgingly ""assume[s], arguendo, that Albrecht correctly held that vertical, maximum price fixing is subject to the 
per se rule,"" ante, at 335, n. 5, but seeks to limit that holding to ""potential effects on dealers and consumers, not . . . 
competitors,"" ante, at 336.  However, in its zeal to narrow antitrust injury, the Court assumes that all vertical maximum-price-
fixing arrangements mimic the circumstances present or discussed in Albrecht, in which there was monopoly power at both the 
production and exclusive distributorship stages.  This approach is incorrect.  For example, in Albrecht itself the Court identified 
possible injury to consumers as one basis for its per se rule, even though there was no evidence of actual consumer injury in 
that case.  390 U.S., at 152-153. Furthermore, the Albrecht Court did not treat Albrecht himself as a ""dealer"" in the conspiracy, 
but essentially as a ""competitor"" targeted by the price-fixing conspiracy between Herald Company and the new dealers that were 
hired ""to force petitioner to conform to the advertised retail price"" by selling newspapers in his territory at lower, fixed prices.  Id., 
at 149-150, and n. 6. Although Albrecht was a potential Herald dealer -- and thus not strictly a ""dealer"" or a ""competitor"" in the 
Court's use of those terms -- what is critical is that he had standing to bring a § 1 action as the victim of a vertical conspiracy to 
underprice his sales.  Finally, the Court contradicts its own contrived model when it admits that vertical maximum-price-fixing 
schemes may facilitate predatory pricing for which a competitor could suffer ""antitrust injury"" in violation of § 2.  Ante, at 339, n. 
9."
535,17," Until today, the Court has clearly understood why § 1 fundamentally differs from other antitrust violations: ""The reason Congress treated concerted behavior more strictly than unilateral behavior is readily appreciated.  Concerted 
activity inherently is fraught with anticompetitive risk.  It deprives the marketplace of the independent centers of decisionmaking 
that competition assumes and demands.  In any conspiracy, two or more entities that previously pursued their own interests 
separately are combining to act as one for their common benefit.  This not only reduces the diverse directions in which economic 
power is aimed but suddenly increases the economic power moving in one particular direction.  Of course, such mergings of 
resources may well lead to efficiencies that benefit consumers, but their anticompetitive potential is sufficient to warrant scrutiny 
even in the absence of incipient monopoly."" Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 768-769 (1984). "
536,18," See, e.g., ante, at 337-338, n. 7 (""Rivals cannot be excluded in the long run by a nonpredatory maximum-price scheme unless 
they are relatively inefficient""); ante, at 344 (""[I]nsofar as the per se rule permits the prohibition of efficient practices in the name

are inefficient; market inefficiencies may also create imperfections leading to some firms' demise.  The Court sanctions a new 
force -- the super-efficiency of an illegally combined group of firms who target their resources to drive an otherwise competitive 
firm out of business.  Cf. Note, Below-Cost Sales and the Buying of Market Share, 42 Stan. L. Rev. 695, 741 (1990) (discussing

540,1," Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 requires a complaint to contain a ""short and plain"" statement of the claim arranged in ""simple, 
concise, and direct"" averments. Plaintiffs have organized their complaint in over three hundred numbered paragraphs consuming 
more than one hundred pages. The complaint is often confusing, needlessly repetitious, and permeated with unnecessary 
evidentiary allegations. Thus, in addition to the deficiencies discussed in detail in this opinion, Rule 8 provides an additional 
basis for dismissing plaintiffs' complaint. See Mutuelle Generale Francaise Vie v. Life Assurance Co., 688 F. Supp. 386, 391 
(N.D. Ill. 1988)."
540,2, All paragraph references are to plaintiffs' first amended complaint. 
542,3," Plaintiffs also challenge ""Rule 3-101(a) and 3-103(a) of the newly proposed Illinois Code."" (See, e.g., para. 19.) On February 8, 1990 the Illinois Supreme Court repealed the Code of Professional Responsibility and replaced it with the Illinois 
Rules of Professional Conduct (""New Rules""). See Order entered February 8, 1990, reported in the Chicago Daily Law Bulletin, 
Feb. 14, 1990, at 4-6. The New Rules take effect August 1, 1990. The Justices argue that a challenge to the New Rules is not yet ripe. However, the court need not address the ripeness issue: 
the substantial similarity between the New Rules and the challenged language of the ABA Model Code compels the same result 
in this case. See, e.g., New Rule 5.4(b) (""A lawyer shall not form a partnership with a nonlawyer if any of the activities of the 
partnership consist of the practice of law."") and New Rule 5.5 (""A lawyer shall not . . . assist a person who is not a member of the 
bar in the performance of activity that constitutes the unauthorized practice of law.""). "
543,4," Although plaintiffs argue in their memorandum in opposition that the associations' adoption of the ABA Model Code and ABA 
Model Rules restrain competition ""of their own force,"" they fail to allege any anticompetitive effects directly attributable to the 
associations' involvement with these codes and not the Illinois Supreme Court and Executive Committee's adoption thereof."
543,5," According to the Office of the Clerk for the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois the present form of

545,7," Plaintiffs' allegations that the private associations somehow conspired with the state actors do not save Count III. In order to 
sustain a Section 1983 conspiracy claim there must be some evidence of some concerted effort or plan between the private 
associations and the state actors to deny plaintiffs their constitutional rights. Moore v. Marketplace Restaurant, Inc., 754 F.2d 
1336, 1352 (7th Cir. 1985); Mirshak v. Joyce, 652 F. Supp. 359, 369 (N.D. Ill. 1987). Plaintiffs have alleged no such facts. On the contrary, plaintiffs incredibly state in their memorandum in response to the motions 
to dismiss that a more definitive statement of conspiracy facts might subject them to sanctions under Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure 11. (Memorandum at 36.) However, plaintiffs cannot file a complaint merely to gain access to discovery with the 
hopes of later finding facts to support their otherwise insufficient allegations. Count II must be dismissed.  [**18] "
546,8," See, e.g., ABA Model Code of Professional Responsibility EC 3-1 (1987) (""The prohibition against the practice of law by a 
layman is grounded in the need of the public for integrity and competence of those who undertake to render legal services. 
Because of the fiduciary and personal character of the lawyer-client relationship and the inherently complex nature of our legal 
system, the public can better be assured of the requisite responsibility and competence if the practice of law is confined to those 
who are subject to the requirements and regulations imposed upon members of the legal profession.""); Gassman v. State Bar, 
18 Cal. 3d 125, 553 P.2d 1147, 1151, 132 Cal. Rptr. 675 (1976) (""prohibited fee-splitting between lawyer and layman . . . poses 
the possibility of control by the lay person, interested in his own profit, rather than the client's fate . . . ."")."
546,9," In their complaint plaintiffs also include language alleging that the challenged provisions of the ABA Model Code are 
unconstitutionally vague. Apparently plaintiffs object to the phrase ""practice of law."" However, it has long been settled that this 
language is sufficiently clear to withstand constitutional scrutiny. Hackin v. Arizona, 102 Ariz. 218, 427 P.2d 910, 912-13 (1967),

552,1, SONOW later amended its complaint to add a claim of illegal monopolization.
552,2," This directive alone produced a flood of letters between the parties and to the Court, with the parties unable to agree on 
appropriate price and payment terms for the SONOW ads. The parties ultimately entered into an escrow agreement, pursuant to 
which SONOW agreed to pay into an escrow account the differential between the normal rate card price and the discount price 
to which SONOW claimed it was entitled, pending the final outcome of the case. Subsequent allegations of late payments, "
553,," improper placement of the ads, and disputes over the propriety of the escrow agreement's continued application have 
constituted a continuing saga in the tortured history of this case. "
554,3," In its amended complaint, SONOW refers to ""exclusionary and predatory conduct, including, but not limited to,"" defendant's 
refusal to deal with plaintiff. However, no other anticompetitive or predatory conduct has been either alleged or supported in any 
way by the facts uncovered during discovery, and therefore plaintiff's claim must be understood to rest only upon the allegedly 
wrongful refusal to deal. "
555,4," HN4[
] The offense of monopolization under § 2 of the Sherman Act consists of two elements: ""(1) the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market and (2) the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth 
or development as a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historical accident."" United States v. Grinnell 
Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 570-71, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778, 86 S. Ct. 1698 (1966); Delaware & Hudson Railway Co. v. Consolidated Rail 
Corp., supra, 902 F.2d at 178."

] ""To make out a successful claim of attempted monopolization, a plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) anti-competitive 
conduct; (2) intent to monopolize; and (3) a dangerous probability of obtaining monopoly power."" Delaware & Hudson Railway 
Co. v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 902 F.2d 174 (2d Cir. 1990). "
557,6," These arguments confuse the Digest's competition in the market for the service of advertisements -- a product distinct from that 
of soap opera magazines -- with its competition in the market in which it is alleged by plaintiff to be a monopolist."
557,7," For example, it is impossible to determine whether two products are reasonably interchangeable, and therefore in the same 
market for antitrust purposes, when the market is defined as a group of potential purchasers rather than as a product. The 
confusion in this case may be related to fact that many of the witnesses and parties have advertising backgrounds, where it is 
customary to define a market as a group of target purchasers of the product being advertised. Thus, Kenneth Stein of SONOW 
notes that the ""market"" for SONOW consists of soap opera ""fanatics."" However the term ""relevant market"" has a very different 
and specific meaning in the context of antitrust analysis, as previously noted. Products targeted at the same advertising ""market"" 
may nonetheless be in entirely different antitrust markets. "
558,8," For example, a magazine devoted solely to articles and information of interest to golfers would presumably reach a consumer 
group consisting of golf enthusiasts. Products also bought by this group, such as golf clubs, balls, and tees, would clearly not be 
in the same relevant market notwithstanding their having an identical consumer. These products would not by any stretch of the 
imagination be reasonable substitutes for one another from the perspective of those consumers. Thus, even a monopolist golf 
magazine would be free to refuse to accept advertising from a golf ball producer without incurring § 2 liability for illegal 
monopolization."
558,9," In support of its ""essential facilities"" theory, which underlies all of plaintiff's antitrust claims, plaintiff asserts that all of its readers 
and potential readers are also readers of the Digest. For this reason, advertisement in the Digest is obviously an extremely 
efficient method for SONOW to reach its targeted consumer market, and plaintiff asserts that such advertisement is in fact the 
only method for reaching these consumers that is not cost prohibitive for a small weekly publication such as itself. However, as 
noted previously, in stressing the effectiveness of the Digest in this manner, plaintiff has undermined any argument that it might 
have had that it is a competitor of the Digest in the sense contemplated by the Sherman Act. "
559,10," See also App. at 46 (letter of Michael Kape) (stating that SONOW fills a gap which Digest cannot, and that SONOW 
""obviously"" does not compete against the Digest, but only against the few other weekly newsletters being published)."
559,11," In its Memorandum Decision granting plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, the Court noted that SONOW had raised a 
substantial question as to whether the Digest could be said to constitute an essential facility in part because at that preliminary 
stage of the proceedings ""it appear[ed] that . . . without advertising in [the Digest], SONOW is unable to make its own publication 
into an effective substitute."" Soap Opera Now, Inc. v. Network Publishing Corp., 88 Civ. 984, at 8. Subsequent discovery, 
however, has failed to support the Court's initial view that SONOW could be a potential substitute for the Digest."
559,12," The Court does not mean to suggest that a small company cannot compete in the same relevant market as a large one, or 
that it must have a reasonable possibility of growing large in order to have a claim under § 2. Indeed, such a position would be 
ridiculous in light of the goals and policies of the Sherman Act. In the instant case, however, plaintiff is not a small company 
producing the same product as a larger monopolist. Instead, it consists of a qualitatively different product which is not a 
reasonable substitute for defendant's product. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to ask whether, in the market in which 
the Digest competes, small newsletter-type products may evolve (absent illegal use of monopoly power) into substitute products, 
and whether plaintiff is such a potential competitor. The evidence presented on this motion for summary judgment allows no 
reasonable inference that the answer to these inquiries is anything other than a negative one."
559,13," In the previous paragraph, Stein had explained that accurate ""sneak peeks,"" (coming attractions) ""are only possible if done by 
a small concern like ours"" because of the very small lag time between printing and delivery. He noted that the larger 
publications, such as defendant, necessarily take much longer to reach the consumer. He postulated that, because SONOW is 
thus able to ""beat them every week"" with respect to this future news, these publications desire to ""crush [SONOW] out of 
business."" Stein Aff. at 5. However, as noted above, Stein also insists that plaintiff's readers read SONOW in addition to, and not 
instead of, the Digest. In this context, use by Stein of the term ""our market"" makes clear that plaintiff and defendant's 
publications serve different, though related, markets."
559,14," The Court has serious reservations about whether plaintiff has even raised a factual question on the issue of defendant's 
monopoly power in the market in which it as a magazine competes. Putting aside disputes over whether other sources of ""the 
mass dissemination of soap opera news,"" such as the soap opera news service in the Prodigy computer software and the local 
and national soap opera telephone services, are in the same relevant market as the Digest, defendant has arguably rebutted 
any inference of monopoly power arising from its alleged market share with substantial evidence of low or nonexistent entry 
barriers. Plaintiff has failed to come forward with any tangible evidence of entry barriers in this market, beyond the assertion that 
soap opera magazines often go out of business or are published sporadically. However, in light of the large alleged market share "
560,," of the Digest, the Court will assume for purposes of this Opinion that the Digest exercises monopoly power in the market 
including the product of soap opera magazines."
560,15," During the pendency of the instant motion, the Digest was sold by defendant to News America Publishing Inc (""News 
America""). Subsequently, SONOW instituted an action against this new owner of the Digest, captioned Soap Opera Now, Inc. v. 
News America Publishing Inc., 90 Civ. 2631 (RJW). There is evidence in the record that the defendant in this latter action has 
begun a weekly soap opera magazine, which contains certain types of features, for example coming attractions, also contained 
in SONOW. Without the benefit of any argument or evidence on the issue, the Court is unable to determine whether there exists 
an issue of fact as to whether this new weekly publication competes in any relevant market with plaintiff, thus raising a possible 
claim of attempted monopolization under a leveraging theory. Plaintiff is, of course, free to pursue this issue in its lawsuit against 
News America. The Court notes in this connection, however, that in order to make out a successful leveraging claim, either 
under an attempt to monopolize theory or a distinct leveraging claim (if such a claim is available in this Circuit), a plaintiff must 
demonstrate both monopoly power in the first market, and a refusal to ""sell a rival the monopolized goods or services he needs 
to compete in the second market."" Berkey Photo, Inc. v. Kodak Co., 603 F.2d at 284 (emphasis supplied). Therefore, plaintiff 
would be required to come forward with some evidence suggesting that News America monopolizes the service claimed by 
plaintiff to be essential for it to compete in the market. "
561,16," Stein points out that many of these competitor publications either do not accept advertising, or are published less frequently 
than the Digest.  These facts, while perhaps relevant to the question whether advertising in the Digest is essential to the plaintiff, 
are not at all relevant to the question whether advertising in the Digest is essential to effective competition in the market. HN11[ ] As often stated but particularly pertinent here, the antitrust laws protect competition, not competitors. Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 320, 344, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510, 82 S. Ct. 1502 (1962). Simply because a particular plaintiff with peculiar 
advertising needs decides that it cannot remain profitable without advertising in a certain publication, that publication does not 
automatically rise to the level of an ""essential facility"" in the general market unless some substantial number of market entrants 
or competitors would also be foreclosed."
561,17," Because it finds that plaintiff has failed to raise a factual issue on any of its federal claims, the Court does not address 
defendant's argument that its refusal to deal is privileged under the first amendment. "
569,1," The Sponsor of the conversion (and former owner) of the Condominium -- Parkchester Apartments Co. -- is not named as a 
defendant in the consolidated complaint. The partners that compose the Sponsor, which is itself a New York partnership, are. 
The two alleged partners are defendant Supervisory Management Corp., a corporation owned by Harry Helmsley, and defendant 
Joseph V. Licari. In addition, other Helmsley-related entities are named defendants, as are numerous passive investors in the 
partnership. "
571,2," Grossman did not seek emergency relief from the abatement at the time it was implemented in March 1988, approximately two 
years before this application, although presumably Grossman's formula (funds = maintenance = quality of life) was as valid then 
as it is now. No explanation has been offered for this delay, nor any evidence suggestive that the ""quality of life within the 
condominium"" declined suddenly prior to the filing of this application, so as to warrant preliminary relief. "
575,3," HUD explained the treatment of condominiums as follows: HN11[
] ""For a condominium unit sale to be exempted from the 
Act, . . . either it must be completed before it is sold, or it must be sold under a contract obligating the seller to erect the unit 
within two years from the date the purchaser signs the contract of sale."" 38 Fed.Reg. 23,866 (1973). See also 44 Fed.Reg. 
24,012 (1979); Winter v. Hollingsworth, 777 F.2d 1444, 1448-49 (11th Cir. 1985) (Congress acted to exempt condominium sales 
""where the building is existing or must, by contract, be completed within two years."")."
575,4," Footnote One of the Opinion, in addressing the securities claim, stated: HN13[
] The sale of condominium units, even when ""made in contemplation of appreciation solely through the efforts of 
defendants,"" as the complaint alleges, does not constitute a sale of securities. See Bender [v. Continental Towers, Ltd., 
Partnership], supra, 632 F. Supp. 497. Even though the sponsor of an offering plan might influence the value of the units "
576,," through its marketing efforts and its own buying and selling strategies, a ""piece of real estate, such as a condominium, has 
an inherent worth not solely dependent on the efforts of the promoter."" Bender, supra, 632 F. Supp. at 501. Beauford, 650 F. Supp. at 550 n. 1. See also Grenader v. Spitz, 537 F.2d 612, 617 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1009, 50 L.

576,5, The complaint fails to specify on behalf of which of the plaintiffs this securities claim is brought. 
587,1," Whether a party has been or will be irreparably harmed is not a jury issue, although factual issues to be considered by the court 
in making that determination may be. See, State v. Texas Pet Foods, Inc., 591 S.W.2d 800, 803-804 (Tex. 1979). "
589,2," Section 188 of the RESTATEMENT states in full: Law Governing in Absence of Effective Choice by the Parties (1) The rights and duties of the parties with respect to an issue in contract are determined by the local law of the state which, 
with respect to that issue, has the most significant relationship to the transaction and the parties under the principles stated in § 
6. (2) In the absence of an effective choice of law by the parties (see § 187), the contacts to be taken into account in applying the 
principles of § 6 to determine the law applicable to an issue include: (a) the place of contracting, (b) the place of negotiation of the contract, (c) the place of performance, (d) the location of the subject matter of the contract, and (e) the domicil, residence, nationality, place of incorporation and place of business of the parties. These contacts are to be evaluated according to their relative importance with respect to the particular issue. (3) If the place of negotiating the contract and the place of performance are in the same state, the local law of this state will 
usually be applied, except as otherwise provided in §§ 189-199 and 203. Section 6 of the RESTATEMENT states: Choice-of-Law Principles (1) A court, subject to constitutional restrictions, will follow a statutory directive of its own state on choice of law. (2) When there is no such directive, the factors relevant to the choice of the applicable rule of law include (a) the needs of the interstate and international systems, (b) the relevant policies of the forum, (c) the relevant policies of other interested states and the relative interests of those states in the determination of the 
particular issue, (d) the protection of justified expectations, (e) the basic policies underlying the particular field of law, "
590,," (f) certainty, predictability and uniformity of result, and (g) ease in the determination and application of the law to be applied."
590,3," The covenant itself states that it was executed in Florida, but testimony for both parties established that DeSantis signed it last 
in Houston."
590,4," Section 196 states: Contracts for the Rendition of Services The validity of a contract for the rendition of services and the rights created thereby are determined, in the absence of an 
effective choice of law by the parties, by the local law of the state where the contract requires that the services, or a major 
portion of the services, be rendered, unless, with respect to the particular issue, some other state has a more significant 
relationship under the principles stated in § 6 to the transaction and the parties, in which event the local law of the other 
state will be applied. "
591,5," The trial court apparently concluded that this noncompetition agreement is enforceable under both Texas and Florida law. The 
court of appeals concluded that the agreement is enforceable under Florida law and did not consider whether it is enforceable 
under Texas law. DeSantis appears to concede that the agreement is enforceable under Florida law. Wackenhut strongly argues 
that the agreement is enforceable under Texas law. "
592,6," An agreement not to compete may be unenforceable for reasons other than public policy. For example, HN9[
] an agreement 
not to compete, like any other contract, must be supported by consideration. See B. Cantrell Oil Co. v. Hino Gas Sales, 756 
S.W.2d 781, 783 (Tex.--Corpus Christi 1988, no writ); Travel Masters Inc. v. Star Tours, Inc., 742 S.W.2d 837, 841 (Tex. App.--

ref'd n.r.e.). Consideration may include special training or knowledge afforded the promisor, but it is not limited to such things, 
and we specifically disapprove language to the contrary in Bland v. Henry & Peters, 763 S.W.2d 5 (Tex. App.--Tyler 1988, writ 
denied). Also, performance of a covenant not to compete, like performance of other contractual obligations, may, in certain 
instances at least, be excused by the promisee's own breach. See Langdon v. Progress Laundry & Cleaning Co., 105 S.W.2d 
346, 347-348 (Tex. Civ. App.--Dallas 1937, writ ref'd); Halbert v. Standley, 488 S.W.2d 887, 889 (Tex. Civ. App.--Waco 1972, 
writ ref'd n.r.e.); RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS §§ 237-249 (1981). And enforcement of an agreement not to 
compete may not be by injunction if the party seeking enforcement is not entitled to such stable relief, as, for example, when that 
party has himself engaged in inequitable conduct, see Vaughan v. Kizer, 400 S.W.2d 586, 589-590 (Tex. Civ. App.--Waco 1966, 
writ ref'd n.r.e.); National Chemsearch Corp. v. Frazier, 488 S.W.2d 545, 548 (Tex. Civ. App.--Waco 1972, no writ); or when that 
party has failed to show that without injunctive relief he will suffer irreparable injury for which he has no adequate legal remedy, 
see Parkem Indus. Services, Inc. v. Garton, 619 S.W.2d 428, 430-431 (Tex. Civ. App.--Amarillo 1981, no writ). "
594,7," New subchapter E added by this Act provides: SUBCHAPTER E. COVENANTS NOT TO COMPETE HN10[
] Sec. 15.50. CRITERIA FOR ENFORCEABILITY OF COVENANTS NOT TO COMPETE. Notwithstanding Section"
594,15," .05 of this code, a covenant not to compete is enforceable to the extent that it: (1) is ancillary to an otherwise enforceable agreement but, if the covenant not to compete is executed on a date other than 
the date on which the underlying agreement is executed, such covenant must be supported by independent valuable 
consideration; and "
595,," (2) contains reasonable limitations as to time, geographical area, and scope of activity to be restrained that do not impose a 
greater restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill or other business interest of the promisee. HN11[
] Sec. 15.51. PROCEDURES AND REMEDIES IN ACTIONS TO ENFORCE COVENANTS NOT TO COMPETE. (a) Except as provided in Subsection (c) of this section, a court may award the promisee under a covenant not to compete 
damages, injunctive relief, or both damages and injunctive relief for a breach by the promisor of the covenant. (b) If the primary purpose of the agreement to which the covenant is ancillary is to obligate the promisor to render personal 
services, the promisee has the burden of establishing that the covenant meets the criteria specified by Subdivision (2) of Section 
15.50 of this code. If the agreement has a different primary purpose, the promisor has the burden of establishing that the 
covenant does not meet those criteria. For the purposes of this subsection, the ""burden of establishing"" a fact means the burden 
of persuading the triers of fact that the existence of the fact is more probable than its nonexistence. (c) If the covenant meets the criteria specified by Subdivision (1) of Section 15.50 of this code but does not meet the criteria 
specified by Subdivision (2) of Section 15.50, the court, at the request of the promisee, shall reform the covenant to the extent 
necessary to cause the covenant to meet the criteria specified by Subdivision (2) of Section 15.50 and enforce the covenant as 
reformed, except that the court may not award the promisee damages for a breach of the covenant before its reformation and 
the relief granted to the promisee shall be limited to injunctive relief. If the primary purpose of the agreement to which the 
covenant is ancillary is to obligate the promisor to render personal services, the promisor establishes that the promisee knew at 
the time of the execution of the agreement that the covenant did not meet the criteria specified by Subdivision (2) of Section 
15.50 and the promisee sought to enforce the covenant to a greater extent than was necessary to protect the goodwill or other 
business interest of the promisee, the court may award the promisor the costs, including reasonable attorney's fees, actually and 
reasonably incurred by the promisor in defending the action to enforce the covenant. "

then dials the long distance call."
603,2," Under the Traffic Agreement, ""paid-on-Guam"" calls include both calls where a GTA subscriber placed and paid for the call and 
where a call from overseas was placed to and paid for by a GTA subscriber."
603,3," IT & E contends that Globcom and GTA endeavored to conceal the 1984 amendment to the Traffic Agreement because, in a 
break with previous practice, Globcom did not file the 1984 amendment with the FCC."
603,4," On November 18, 1983, GTA applied to the FCC for permission to acquire facilities from Hawaiian Telephone Company for the 
purpose of providing long distance service between the Territory of Guam and the State of Hawaii and points beyond. Both 
Globcom and IT & E filed petitions to deny GTA's initial application with the FCC."
603,5," IT & E asserts that it could not afford to purchase interconnections from GTA under the 50% net-revenue formula incorporated 
in the third amendment because IT & E, unlike Globcom, had very little inbound traffic and virtually no categories of exempt 
revenue under the formula. According to IT & E, GTA and Globcom purposely chose a revenue formula that was suited only to 
Globcom's particular circumstances and methods of operation because such a formula would be excessive and prohibitive for 
any other carrier. "
604,6," Because IT & E did not offer operator-assisted calling as did Globcom, GTA refused to list IT & E in the instruction section or 
""pink pages"" of the GTA telephone directory. However, after negotiations, GTA agreed to place IT & E's advertisement on the 
inside front cover of its directory and to refer to the advertisement in Globcom's listing in the ""pink pages."""
604,7," In order to bill a long distance call, a carrier must identify the subscriber to be charged. ANI is a procedure that enables the 
local service provider's switching equipment to automatically forward the telephone number of the party to be charged to the long 
distance carrier. There are two other methods to identify the subscriber to be charged: Operator Number Identification (""ONI"") 
and Personal Identification Number (""PIN""). ONI requires an operator to come on the line and request the billing information from 
the parties. With PIN, the billing information is recorded when a caller dials in the number of his or her personal account with the 
carrier. Prior to GTA's implementation of ANI, Globcom used the more cumbersome ONI procedure to identify the party to be 
charged."
604,8," Although GTA was originally named as a defendant in the first complaint, IT & E voluntarily dismissed the complaint as to GTA 
without prejudice pursuant to Rule 41(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure."
604,9," Globcom sought appellate review of the Court's denial of its motion to dismiss. On June 3, 1988, Globcom filed a petition for 
mandamus with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia which was denied. Globcom also filed a motion 
with this Court seeking certification for an interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). On July 28, 1988, this Court 
denied Globcom's motion for certification. "

if borne out by the evidence the defendants offer to adduce, would show their agreement to have a substantial capacity for 
increasing the efficiency of the integration.  * * * [T]he economics involved in judging the plausibility of defendants' theory,

635,3," In context, the Court of Appeals correctly reasoned: ""The language quoted from Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Society, supra, addresses the question of why the Court 
considered the arrangement there to involve more than 'literal price fixing.' Here, there is no contention that price fixing is 
involved.  The only claimed violation is a refusal to deal.  The Court's discussion in Maricopa, therefore, is not directly 
applicable.  Additionally, read in the context of the Supreme Court's entire opinion, the quoted language only suggests that, 
if the arrangement in Maricopa had involved some greater level of integration between the foundations and the insurance 
providers, it could have been saved from per se illegality.  It does not suggest, and we do not read it to hold, that an 
arrangement that constitutes a joint venture is ipso facto free from antitrust scrutiny.  Firms that are genuinely joined 
together for the accomplishment of some business purpose are capable of acting concertedly and anti-competitively 
through a refusal to deal.  We hold that, as a general proposition, although the extent of integration among firms engaged in 
a common enterprise may be relevant to the question of whether the arrangement should be treated as an illegal 
combination per se, characterizing an agreement as a 'joint venture' says nothing about the effect of the arrangement on 
competition and does not mean that the entity is free from antitrust scrutiny."" 97 Or App at 85. (Some citations omitted.)"

Congoleum products.  The defendants' evidence showed, however, that intrabrand competition increased and, by using a

this situation we must not overlook the Supreme Court's admonition in Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429

656,4," At trial one of Texaco's defenses was based on its obligation to comply with certain federal regulations during periods of

distributor classes of purchaser can be explained almost entirely by the magnitude of the distributor discount and the hauling

'functional discount.'"" 634 F. Supp. 34, 37, n. 4 (ED Wash. 1985) (emphasis in original)."
657,10," ""Secondly, the functional discounts negatively affected competition because they were, in part, reflected in the favored 
purchasers' (or their customers') retail prices. In other words, the discount was not consumed or absorbed at the level of the 
favored buyers; rather, the amount of the discount (or a significant portion) appeared in the favored purchasers' retail price, or in 
the favored purchasers' price to their customers and in their customers' retail prices. Under such circumstances, the otherwise 
innocuous nature and presumed legality of functional discounts is rebutted, for it is universally recognized that a functional 
discount remains legal only to the extent it acts as compensation for the functions performed by the favored buyer. See 3 Kintner 
& Bauer, Federal Antitrust Law 309-10 (1983); Rill, Availability and Functional Discounts Justifying Discriminatory Pricing, 53 
Antitrust L. J. 929, 939-41 (1985). The discount must 'be reasonably related to the expenses assumed by the [favored] buyer'

Company, 52 F.T.C. at 209, cited in Boise Cascade Corp., Docket No. 9133, slip op. at 117 (Feb. 14, 1984) (initial decision). If 
the discount exceeds such costs, it cannot be justified as a functional discount, particularly where, as here, the excess has a 
negative effect on competition. "
658,," ""In this case Texaco made no serious attempt to quantitatively justify its functional discounts. While a precise accounting of the 
value of the performed functions is not mandated, merely identifying some of the functions is not sufficient. There is no 
substantial evidence to support Texaco's position that the discounts were justified."" 634 F. Supp., at 38 (footnote omitted)."
658,11," In their brief as amici curiae, the United States and the Federal Trade Commission suggest the following definition of 
""functional discount,"" which is adequate for our discussion: "" A functional discount is one given to a purchaser based on its role 
in the supplier's distributive system, reflecting, at least in a generalized sense, the services performed by the purchaser for the 
supplier."" Brief for United States et al. as Amici Curiae 10 (filed Aug. 3, 1989). "
659,12," The legislative history indicates that earlier drafts of the Act did include such a proviso. See, e.g., Shniderman, ""The Tyranny 
of Labels"" -- A Study of Functional Discounts Under the Robinson-Patman Act, 60 Harv. L. Rev. 571, 583-586, and nn. 40-57 
(1947). The deletion of this exception for functional discounts has ambiguous significance. It may be, as one commentator has 
suggested, that the circumstances of the Act's passage ""must have conveyed to the congressional mind the realization that the 
judiciary and the FTC would view what had occurred as a narrowing of the gates through which the functional classification plan 
of a seller had to pass to come within the law."" Id., at 588. In any event, the deletion in no way detracts from the blunt direction of 
the statutory text, which indicates that any price discrimination substantially lessening competition will expose the discriminator 
to liability, regardless of whether the discriminator attempts to characterize the pricing scheme as a functional discount."
659,13," See n. 6, supra."
659,14," Texaco has not contested here the proposition that branded gas and unbranded gas are of like grade and quality. See FTC v. 
Borden Co., 383 U.S. 637, 645-646 (1966) (""the economic factors inherent in brand names and national advertising should not 
be considered in the jurisdictional inquiry under the statutory 'like grade and quality' test""). "
660,15," It has proven useful in Robinson-Patman Act cases to distinguish among ""the probable impact of the [price] discrimination on 
competitors of the seller (primary-line injury), on the favored and disfavored buyers (second-line injury), or on the customers of 
either of them (third-line injury)."" See 3 E. Kintner & J. Bauer, Federal Antitrust Law § 20.9 p. 127 (1983). "
661,16," ""In the Committee's view, imposing on any dual supplier a legal responsibility for the resale policies and prices of his 
independent distributors contradicts basic antitrust policies. Resale-price fixing is incompatible with the tenets of a free and 
competitive economy. What is more, the arrangements necessary for policing, detecting, and reporting price cutters may be 
illegal even apart from the resale-price agreement itself. And even short of such arrangements, a conscious adherence in a 
supplier's sales to retail customers to the price quotations by independent competing distributors is hardly feasible as a matter of 
business operation, or safe as a matter of law."" Report of the Attorney General's National Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws 
206-207 (1955) (footnotes omitted)."
661,17," ""In our view, to relate discounts or prices solely to the purchaser's resale activities without recognition of his buying functions 
thwarts competition and efficiency in marketing. It compels affirmative discrimination against a substantial class of distributors, 
and hence serves as a penalty on integration. If a businessman actually fulfills the wholesale function by relieving his suppliers 
of risk, storage, transportation, administration, etc., his performance, his capital investment, and the saving to his suppliers, are 
unaffected by whether he also performs the retailing function, or any number of other functions. A legal rule disqualifying him 
from discounts recognizing wholesaling functions actually performed compels him to render these functions free of charge."" Id., 
at 207."
661,18," In theory, a supplier could try to defend a functional discount by invoking the Act's cost justification defense, but the burden of 
proof with respect to the defense is upon the supplier, and interposing the defense ""has proven difficult, expensive, and often 
unsuccessful."" 3 E. Kintner & J. Bauer, Federal Antitrust Law, § 23.19, pp. 366-367 (1983). Moreover, to establish the defense 
a ""seller must show that the price reductions given did not exceed the actual cost savings,"" id., § 23.10, p. 345, and this 
requirement of exactitude is ill-suited to the defense of discounts set by reference to legitimate, but less precisely measured, 
market factors. Cf. Calvani, Functional Discounts Under the Robinson-Patman Act, 17 B. C. Ind. & Com. L. Rev. 543, 546, n. 16 
(1976) (distinguishing functional discounts from cost-justified price differences); Report of the Attorney General's National 
Committee on the Antitrust Laws, at 171 (""the cost defense has proved largely illusory in practice""). Discounters will therefore likely find it more useful to defend against claims under the Act by negating the causation element in 
the case against them: a legitimate functional discount will not cause any substantial lessening of competition. The concept of "
662,," substantiality permits the causation inquiry to accommodate a notion of economic reasonableness with respect to the pass-
through effects of functional discounts, and so provides a latitude denied by the cost-justification defense. Cf. Shniderman, 60 
Harv. L. Rev., at 603-604 (substantiality defense in functional discount cases). We thus find ourselves in substantial agreement 
with the view that: HN12[
] ""Conceived as a vehicle for allowing differential pricing to reward distributive efficiencies among customers operating 
at the same level, the cost justification defense focuses on narrowly defined savings to the seller derived from the different 
method or quantities in which goods are sold or delivered to different buyers. . . . Moreover, the burden of proof as to the cost 
justification defense is on the seller charged with violating the Act, whereas the burden of proof remains with the enforcement 
agency or plaintiff in circumstances involving functional discounts since functional pricing negates the probability of competitive 
injury, an element of a prima facie case of violation."" Rill, Availability and Functional Discounts Justifying Discriminatory Pricing, 
53 Antitrust L. J. 929, 935 (1985) (footnotes omitted)."
662,19," Texaco continues the argument by summoning a parade of horribles whose march Texaco believes is at issue in this case; 
according to Texaco, the Court of Appeals' rule ""would multiply distribution costs, rigidify and increase consumer prices, 
encourage resale price maintenance in violation of the Sherman Act, . . . , and jeopardize the businesses of wholesalers."" Brief

course been the subject of harsh criticism. See, e. g., Report of the Attorney General's National Committee to Study the Antitrust 
Laws, at 206. Much, if not all, of this criticism rests upon the view that, under the FTC's Standard Oil ruling, a ""supplier is 
charged with legal responsibility for the middlemen's pricing tactics, and hence must control their resale prices lest they undercut 
him to the unlawful detriment of his directly purchasing retailers. Alternatively, the seller may forego his operational freedom by 
matching his quotations to retailers with theirs."" Ibid. Nothing in our opinion today should be read to condone or approve such a

323 F.2d 44 (CA7 1963), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 923 (1964). The FTC in Mueller expressly disavowed dicta from Doubleday 
suggesting that functional discounts are per se legal if justified by the buyer's costs. Mueller held that the discounts were

performs it."" 52 F.T.C., at 209. As already noted, a causation defense in a functional discount case does not demand the 
rigorous accounting associated with a cost justification defense."

] [8C] The seller may be willing to accept any division of the price difference so long as some significant part is passed on to the 
distributor's customers. Although respondents here did not need to show any benefit to Texaco from the price discrimination 
scheme in order to establish a violation of the Act, one possibility is indicated by the brief filed amicus curiae by the Service 
Station Dealers of America (SSDA), an organization representing both stations supplied by independent jobbers and stations 
supplied directly by sellers. See Brief for SSDA as Amicus Curiae 1-2. SSDA suggests that an indirect price discount to 
competitors may be used to force directly supplied franchisees out of the market, and so to circumvent federal restrictions upon 
the termination of franchise agreements. See 92 Stat. 324-332, 15 U.S.C. §§ 2801-2806. One would expect that -- absent a safe harbor rule making functional discounts a useful means to engage in otherwise unlawful 
price discrimination -- excessive functional discounts of the sort in evidence here would be rare. As the Government correctly 
observes, ""this case appears to reflect rather anomalous behavior on the part of the supplier."" Brief for United States et al. as 
Amici Curiae 17, n. 15 (filed Aug. 3, 1989). See also Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 15 (filed May 16, 1989) (""market 
forces should tend to discourage a supplier from offering independent wholesalers discounts that would allow them to undercut 
the supplier's own retail customers"")."
664,24," Much of Perkins's case parallels that of respondents. ""There was evidence that Signal received a lower price from Standard 
than did Perkins, that this price advantage was passed on, at least in part, to Regal, and that Regal was thereby able to undercut 
Perkins' price on gasoline. Futhermore there was evidence that Perkins repeatedly complained to Standard officials that the 
discriminatory price advantage given Signal was being passed down to Regal and evidence that Standard Officials were aware 
that Perkins' business was in danger of being destroyed by Standard's discriminatory practices. This evidence is sufficient to 
sustain the jury's award of damages under the Robinson-Patman Act."" 395 U.S., at 649. "
665,25," We added: ""Here Standard discriminated in price between Perkins and Signal, and there was evidence from which the jury 
could conclude that Perkins was harmed competitively when Signal's price advantage was passed on to Perkins' retail 
competitor Regal. These facts are sufficient to give rise to recoverable damages under the Robinson-Patman Act."" 395 U.S., at 
648."
665,26," LEdHN[13B][
] [13B] In fact, the principles applied in Perkins -- that we HN15[
] will not construe the Robinson-Patman Act in a way that ""would 
allow price discriminators to avoid the sanctions of the Act by the simple expedient of adding an additional link to the distribution 
chain,"" 395 U.S., at 647 -- seems capable of governing this case as well. It might be possible to view Perkins as standing for a 
narrower proposition, either because Signal apparently exercised majority control over the intermediary, Western Hyway, and its 
retailer, Regal, see id., at 651 (MARSHALL, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), or because Standard did not assert that 
its price to Signal reflected a ""functional discount."" However, as the Perkins dissent pointed out, ibid., the Perkins majority did 
not put any such limits on the principle it declared."

Patman Act, 1989 Utah L. Rev. 813, 857 (1989) (concluding that ""trade discounts often are manifestations of economic price 
discrimination. . . . If a trade discount violates the normal competitive disadvantage criteria used under the Act, no special 
devices should be employed to protect it""); Rill, 53 Antitrust L.J., at 940-941 (""Although it is entirely appropriate for the FTC and

consumers and the resellers pass on to consumers all or part of the wholesaling functional discount""); C. Edwards, Price

Rev. 526, 556 (1952) (concluding that the ""characterization of a price differential between two purchasers as a functional or 
trade discount accords it no cloak of immunity from the prohibitions of the Robinson-Patman Act""); Shniderman, 60 Harv. L. 
Rev., at 599-600 (Commission's approach to functional discounts ""may have been influenced by the possibility of subtle price 
discriminating techniques through the employment of wholesalers receiving more than ample discount differentials""). Professor Edwards, among others, describes the status of functional discounts under the Robinson-Patman Act with clear 
dissatisfaction. He complains that ""The failure of the Congress to cope with the problem . . . has left the Commission an 
impossible job in this type of case."" Price Discrimination Law, at 313. He adds that the Commission's ""occasional proceedings"" 
have been attributed to the ""Commission's wrong-headedness."" Id., at 312. Professor Edward's observations about the merits of 
the statute and about prosecutorial discretion are obviously irrelevant to our own inquiry. Unlike scholarly commentators, we 
have a duty to be faithful to congressional intent when interpreting statutes, and are not free to consider whether, or how, the 
statute should be rewritten. "
666,28," ""In practice, the competitive effects requirement permits a supplier to quote different prices between different distributor 
classes -- so long as those who are higher up (nearer the supplier) on the distribution ladder pay less than those who are further 
down (nearer the consumer)."" F. Rowe, Price Discrimination Under the Robinson-Patman Act 174 (1962) (footnote omitted); see 
also id., at 178."
666,29," Rowe, writing prior to this Court's Perkins decision, describes the exception, which he identifies with the Standard Oil cases, 
as ""of dubious validity today."" Id., at 196. Rowe's analysis is flawed because he assumes that seller liability for tertiary line 
implications of wholesaler discounts must follow the logic of the Standard Oil complaint, and likewise assumes that this logic 
exposes to liability any seller who fails to monitor the resale prices of its wholesaler. Id., at 204. Indeed, Rowe's own discussion 
suggests one defect in his argument: legitimate wholesaler discounts will usually be insulated from liability by an absence of 
evidence on the causation issue. Id., at 203-204. In any event, nothing in our opinion today endorses a theory of liability under 
the Robinson-Patman Act for functional discounts so broad as the theory Rowe draws from Standard Oil. "

710,1," Minolta was the authorized United States distributor for and a wholly owned subsidiary of Minolta Camera Company Limited 
(""Minolta Japan""), a Japanese manufacturer of cameras and related equipment."
710,2," Although Wolf Camera was allegedly selected as the Atlanta market key dealer, it was not the only key dealer selling Minolta 
cameras in Atlanta. Some national market key dealers, e.g., Service Merchandise, had a substantial presence in Atlanta. "
711,3," As Wolf Camera purchased Minolta goods in the amount of $ 12,891,883 over a period of time comparable to that in which the 
price discrimination was alleged to have taken place, the purported favoritism translates into the following amounts: (1) At 4%, $ 
537,161 (.96X=$ 12,891,883; X=$ 13,429,044; $ 13,429,044-$ 12,891,883=$ 537,161); (2) At 5%, $ 678,520; (3) At 6%, $ 
822,886; (4) At 7%, $ 970,356."
711,4," The ""grey market"" refers to goods that were sold abroad by camera manufacturers at a price low enough to make it profitable 
for the foreign purchasers of those goods to export them into the United States. Once exported to the United States, the goods 
compete with those sold through normal, authorized, distribution channels. It is somewhat ironic that in this price discrimination 
case the alleged competitive threat is the grey market, which is often created by price discrimination on an international scale."
711,5," Section 2(a) HN2[
] provides, in relevant part, as follows: It shall be unlawful for any person . . . to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and 
quality . . . where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly 
in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any person who either grants or knowingly 
receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them: Provided, That nothing herein contained 
shall prevent differentials which make only due allowance for differences in the cost of manufacture, sale, or delivery 
resulting from the differing methods or quantities in which such commodities are to such purchasers sold or delivered. . . ."
711,15, U.S.C. § 13(a).
711,6," A controversy has raged (and continues to rage) over the meaning of the word ""competition"" as used in the so-called 
""competitive injury"" phrase of section 2(a). See, e.g., Boise Cascade Corp. v. FTC, 267 U.S. App. D.C. 124, 837 F.2d 1127, 
1143 (Starr, J.); id., at 1148-52 (Williams, J., concurring); id., at 1152-63 (Mikva, J., dissenting). The word ""competition"" as "
712,," generally used in the antitrust laws seems capable of meaning different things to different people and, according to one 
commentator, can be interpreted in at least five ways. See R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 58-61 (1978). To some, ""competition"" 
can only mean ""any state of affairs in which consumer welfare cannot be increased by moving to an alternative state of affairs 
through judicial decree,"" id., at 61, and competitive injury under the antitrust laws cannot occur unless an action taken has the 
net effect of restricting output and raising prices, i.e., lowering consumer welfare. Id., at 122. See also Ball Memorial Hosp., Inc. 
v. Mutual Hosp. Ins., Inc., 784 F.2d 1325, 1334 (7th Cir. 1986). Under this interpretation a proven injury to competitors is 
irrelevant under the antitrust laws (including the RPA); the focus of inquiry is on the detrimental effects of prices on consumers, 
not the detrimental effect of prices on competitors, for rarely the twain shall meet. Judicial precedent, however, suggests that in the RPA the meaning of competition is not so narrow, nor the gap between an 
injury to competition and an injury to competitors so wide. Indeed, many cases dealing with secondary-line price discrimination 
(as does this one) hold or suggest that an injury to competition is proved by showing an injury to competitors. See, e.g., Falls 
City Indus., Inc. v. Vanco Beverage, Inc., 460 U.S. 428, 434-38, 103 S. Ct. 1282, 1288-90, 75 L. Ed. 2d 174 (1983) (section 2(a)

injury to competition by a showing of 'injury to the competitor victimized by the discrimination'""; proof that ""the competitive

2d 169 (1982) (to establish competitive injury under section 2(a) a plaintiff ""must demonstrate that the likely effect of the alleged 
price discrimination was to allow a favored competitor to draw significant sales or profits away from him, the disfavored 
competitor""); Foremost Dairies, Inc. v. FTC, 348 F.2d 674, 678 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 959, 86 S. Ct. 435, 15 L. Ed. 2d 
362 (1965) (recognizing that section 2(a) protects injury to competition as well as injury to competitors). But see Boise Cascade, 
supra, at 1143 (harm to competition all that matters); Richard Short Oil Co. v. Texaco, Inc., 799 F.2d 415, 420 (8th Cir. 1986) 
(RPA refers to competition in general, not competitors). This interpretation has carried over to primary-line price discrimination 
as well. See Utah Pie Co. v. Continental Baking Co., 386 U.S. 685, 87 S. Ct. 1326, 18 L. Ed. 2d 406 (1967) (local market price 
war driving down prices injured competitor, thus it injured competition); A.A. Poultry Farms, Inc. v. Rose Acre Farms, Inc., 881 
F.2d 1396 (7th Cir. 1989) (recognizing difference between law and economics); McGahee v. Northern Propane Gas Co., 858

competitor). But cf.  Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) 
(allegations conflicting with economic theory are to be viewed skeptically). The gist of these cases, representing about a half-
century of RPA interpretation, is that HN3[
] the legal focus of the competitive injury inquiry is on the competitor, not the 
consumer. For section 2(a) purposes, whether or not output is restricted or prices are raised simply is not dispositive. We need not address this issue in any greater detail at this time. We address it at all only because the controversy over 
competitive injury may have implications for our later analysis of ""antitrust injury"" under Clayton Act section 4, 15 U.S.C. § 16. 
For the time being we are satisfied merely to make it clear that when confronted with contemporary economic argument on the 
one hand and judicial precedent on the other, we feel, unlike those of a more activist bent, see, e.g., R. Bork, supra, at 36, that 
economic argument is not ultimately controlling; judicial precedent is."

714,11," On the other hand, the accounting evidence showed that Minolta, through financial and other incentive programs, provided AA 
with benefits totaling $ 140,904: MDF in the amount of $ 60,458; non-MDF in the amount of $ 80,446."
714,12," AA filed four motions for partial summary judgment. Those motions sought judgment (1) rejecting Appellees' ""meeting 
competition"" defense; (2) establishing the element of interstate commerce; (3) establishing that the statute of limitations on the 
AA's claims was tolled by fraudulent concealment; and (4) finding that Appellees had violated sections 2(d) and 2(e) of the RPA. 
AA also filed a motion requesting the district court to certify for appeal its denial of AA's motion to compel discovery. Appellees 
responded with the following motions: (1) for summary judgment against AA's RPA claims; (2) for summary judgment against 
AA's state law claims; and (3) for the exclusion of AA's expert opinion damage study."
714,13," A private plaintiff's standing to sue for damages is authorized by section 4(a) of the Clayton Act, as amended, which states 
that ""any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue 
therefor . . . and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's 
fee."" 15 U.S.C. § 15(a). A private plaintiff may also avail itself of injunctive relief. Clayton Act section 16 provides that ""any 
person, firm, corporation, or association shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief . . . against threatened loss or 
damage by a violation of the antitrust laws . . . when and under the same conditions and principles as injunctive relief against 
threatened conduct that will cause loss or damage is granted by courts of equity."" 15 U.S.C. § 26. Although AA's complaint requested both damages relief and injunctive relief, AA is no longer in a position to pursue an 
injunction. Thus, damages via section 4 are our only concern. "
715,14," Appellees ""conceded"" for the purposes of summary judgment AA's calculation of price discrimination (based as it was on only 
discovered MDF accounts). They then argued, however, that the total should sum to $ 350,540, not $ 372,034. The Appellees 
ignored about $ 21,500 worth of advertising benefits granted Wolf Camera that did not appear in the accounts until after April 30, 
1986. They asserted that these benefits were provided Wolf Camera after the ""relevant period."" The district court adopted the 
Appellees' view."
715,15," Following from the court's RPA conclusions was its grant of summary judgment against AA's state law claim of tortious 
interference. With no antitrust injury or RPA ""wrong,"" the court reasoned, there could be no claim. The court also concluded that 
AA's other state law claim -- breach of implied covenant -- must fail as well. The court held that Georgia law does not allow a 
claim for breach of implied covenant, if such a claim cannot be tied to a violation of an explicit contractual provision. "
716,16," Though the birth of the RPA was motivated by a desire to place ""big"" purchasers on par with ""small"" ones, the Act's 
applicability is not limited to big buyer/small buyer cases. Boise Cascade, supra, at 1139 n. 11. ""It 'is of general applicability and 
prohibits discriminations generally.'"" Falls City Indus., Inc. v. Vanco Beverage, Inc., 460 U.S. 428, 436, 103 S. Ct. 1282, 1289, 75

717,17," We count only those discovered MDF benefits which relate to advertising and promotion, for the $ 271,123 of MDF benefits 
relating to free goods are not ""services or facilities"" within the meaning of sections 2(d) or (e). ""Services and facilities"" under 
sections 2(d) and (e) must be related to the resale of the product in issue, and Minolta's provision of free goods was not 
connected with the resale of Minolta equipment. See, e.g., Fred Meyer, supra, 390 U.S. at 355-57, 88 S. Ct. at 911-12. "
719,18," The lower court seemed to find that AA failed to establish injury at all, much less antitrust injury. The court found that the 
discriminatory benefits received by Wolf Camera were not passed on in the form of lower prices to its consumers and that AA 
never lowered prices to compete with Wolf Camera. Moreover, the lower court found from the evidence that AA's profit margins 
on Minolta products were comparable with or higher than those on its other products, and stayed that way throughout the period 
of discrimination. It apparently concluded from these findings that AA had suffered no loss of sales or profits and, consequently, 
that no damage had been sustained. Such a conclusion is a non sequitur. Wolf Camera may not have passed on its discriminatory benefits in the form of lower prices, 
although we think the evidence on this is mixed at best. But lower resale prices are not necessary to establish injury. The 
evidence shows that discretionary dollars in the Atlanta specialty camera store industry were most often channelled into store-
specific advertising rather than into investments in price cuts. Sales were gained not by cutting prices but by aggressive 
advertising or product/service enhancement. The evidence, more specifically, shows that Wolf Camera was an avid pursuer of 
marketing expense and enhanced service and, indeed, that it directed most of its discriminatory advantage into these areas of 
demand management, thereby expanding its sales at AA's expense. Although price is nice, it is this effect on sales that directs 
the injury inquiry. See Falls City Indus., Inc. v. Vanco Beverage, Inc., 460 U.S. at 437-38, 103 S. Ct. at 1290 (speaking of 
diverted sales); Rose Confections, Inc. v. Ambrosia Chocolate Co., 816 F.2d at 386-87 (speaking of injury through loss of 
potential customers). That AA's product margins on Minolta goods remained comparable with those on its other goods or that AA did not lower its 
prices on Minolta goods (which is to say the same thing) is not critical in establishing injury, for a firm's profits are the product of 
an equation multiplying profit margin and dollar volume of sales. Where the dollar volume of sales drops, as it did for AA in a 
most dramatic fashion, a firm's amount of profit drops regardless of stability in its profit margin. And it is the firm's profits, not its 
profit margin, that the law is concerned with. "
720,19," For damages ""it is enough that the illegality is shown to be a material cause of the injury; a plaintiff need not exhaust all 
possible alternative sources of injury in fulfilling his burden."" Zenith Radio Corp., supra, 395 U.S. at 114 n. 9, 89 S. Ct. at 1571-
72 n. 9."
720,20," This conclusion stands regardless of the specific concerns advanced by the lower court. The court felt that no injury could 
possibly arise from the amount of price discrimination involved in the case, which it called de minimis. But the de minimis 
doctrine, by which a price discrimination is held to be too inconsequential to have caused competitive injury under section 2(a) or 
actual injury under section 4, does not depend on the large or small amount of the price discrimination per se. It depends on the 
large or small effect that the price discrimination has on business rivalry. See Lupia, supra, at 1171. To illustrate, in a competitive 
market the smallest increment of price advantage to one competitor would theoretically allow it to capture from its rivals as much 
of a market share as its output allowed. The price advantage may be de minimis, but the effect of it is not. We are not suggesting 
that the market involved here is perfectly competitive, but it is imperfectly so, and even in such markets a little price 
discrimination can go a long way. See Foremost Dairies, supra, at 679 (dairy industry); Shreveport Macaroni Mfg. Co. v. FTC, 
321 F.2d 404, 409 (5th Cir. 1963), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 971, 84 S. Ct. 491, 11 L. Ed. 2d 418 (1964) (pasta industry). Indeed, 
AA's economic expert concluded that the competitive advantage given Wolf had a substantial effect on its ability to capture 
market share, and as far as we know the expert's conclusions constitute evidence. Thus, the lower court's de minimis objection 
cannot keep this issue from reaching the jury. "
721,," Nor can a variation on the de minimis theme relied on by the court: that no antitrust injury existed because Minolta products were 
only one line of many that AA carried. Simply because AA's injury derived from only one line of its products does not make that 
injury any less real. See FTC v. Morton Salt Co., 334 U.S. at 49, 68 S. Ct. at 829. If this particular strain of the de minimis 
argument failed in Morton Salt, where a grocer's potential injury came only from price differentials affecting one product amid 
thousands that it carried, it surely fails here. The court also seemed to think that AA's injury could only be caused from price-lowering actions by Wolf Camera. But sales in 
the specialty camera industry are affected by more than price; they are affected by promotion and product as well. The court 
found as a matter of fact that Wolf Camera channeled most of its advantage into advertising and promotion, and it seems that it 
enhanced its product (photographic equipment and retail service combined) too. The evidence establishes that promotion and 
product enhancement were the primary factors affecting camera consumers' choice of sales outlet. Thus the fact that Wolf 
Camera did not lower its resale prices, even if true, by no means eliminates causation from jury consideration. The court felt too that no genuine issue existed about AA's antitrust injury, or lack thereof, because AA was the cause of its 
losses, not Appellees. There can be no liability ""when the injury is the result of the plaintiff's own competitive shortcomings, 
rather than a merely coincidental discrimination in price."" Richard Short Oil Co. v. Texaco, Inc., 799 F.2d 415, 421 (8th Cir. 
1986). And it is true that AA had competitive shortcomings, including its faulty computer system and its decision to blunder about 
unprofitably in Florida. These shortcomings could easily have been the intervening cause of all AA's sales and profit losses or 
some part of them, of this there is no doubt. But whether the cause of all or some of AA's problems actually was AA's 
discrimination-based competitive disadvantage, AA's computer, AA's managers, all of these things or none of them, is a matter 
of educated inference that must be left for the jury. If it finds that Appellees' price discrimination was the cause of some of AA's 
injury, which is certainly a reasonable inference, Appellees will be ""responsible to that extent."" Falls City Indus., Inc. v. Vanco 
Beverage, Inc., 460 U.S. at 437, 103 S. Ct. at 1290. "
722,21," Even when AA's injury alone is considered, the district court's limitation on discovery was too severe. The court found that the 
Atlanta market was the only relevant market in this case, but this finding does not comport with the facts. AA had stores not only 
in Atlanta, but throughout the southeast United States and particularly in Florida. Grabowski's testimony alleged that Minolta 
channeled ""key dealer"" benefits to Florida camera stores other than AA, including Wolf Camera's Florida stores. The evidence is 
inconclusive with regard to the extent of competition, in Florida, between AA and the other key-dealer retailers. Thus, these 
benefits may have injured AA in Florida, or they may have been used to create a fund for injuring AA in Atlanta. Discovery 
should have been allowed to determine if this was the case. Moreover, a narrow reading of AA's complaint cannot limit the relevant market in this case solely to Atlanta. Although the 
complaint naturally focuses on Minolta and Wolf Camera in the Atlanta market, it does not do so to the point of limiting discovery 
only to Wolf Camera in the Atlanta market. It seems to us that the district court's focus on the Atlanta market was too narrow. At 
least for the purposes of discovery, AA should have been allowed to find information on price discrimination affecting all of its 
stores, even those outside of Atlanta."
722,22," Our analysis on summary judgment was based on a normal reading of the Rule 56 standard. Appellees argue that our 
analysis should have been based on a stricter reading. They assert that the Supreme Court's decision in Matsushita Elec. Indus. 
Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) evinces a mandate for courts to use a stricter-
than-normal summary judgment standard in antitrust cases, a standard that imposes extra burdens on a plaintiff, one that would 
lead us in this case to uphold the district court. We cannot agree with the Appellees' assertion, however, for Matsushita calls for 
no such deviation from the norm embodied in Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. "
723,," In Matsushita the Supreme Court warned courts in summary judgment proceedings to be skeptical when presented antitrust 
allegations that clash with established economic theory. Such skepticism is well warranted because established economic theory 
indicates how rational entities generally act, and most antitrust cases involve the acts of rational entities. Generalizing, 
Matsushita warns courts to be wary of drawing irrational inferences in summary judgment proceedings, for irrational inferences 
fail to create genuine issues of material fact. But such a doctrine is hardly novel; and it certainly does not modify the standard for 
summary judgment. Matsushita said nothing new, it merely informed the proper Rule 56 standard by placing it in a complex 
antitrust context (that of a predatory pricing conspiracy). We did not base our conclusions on irrational inferences, of course. Thus, Matsushita provides Appellees with little help. "
727,*," See Rule 34-2(b), Rules of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit."
727,**," Honorable Stanley Marcus, U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of Florida, sitting by designation. "
755,1," We should note that the holding of Monsanto primarily applies to discussions between the manufacturer and its distributors. 
Under United States v. Colgate & Co., 250 U.S. 300, 63 L. Ed. 992, 39 S. Ct. 465 (1919), it is clear that a manufacturer can have 
discretion over whom it wishes to deal with so that it can maintain order in its distribution ranks. As this court stated in T.W. 
Electrical Services, Inc. v. Pacific Electrical Contractors Assoc., 809 F.2d 626, 632 n. 4 (9th Cir. 1987), ""a manufacturer's 
independent refusal to deal with distributors did not violate antitrust laws."" But the same rationale does not necessarily apply to 
relationships among competitor companies, and we note that horizontal relationships among co-competitors, such as those 
which exist in this case, are distinguishable from vertical relationships between a manufacturer and its distributors. "
757,2," In first considering the parallel pricing evidence alone we do not ignore our mandate to ""take special caution to give the 
[plaintiffs] 'the full benefit of their proof without tightly compartmentalizing the various factual components and wiping the slate 
clean after scrutiny of each.'"" Wilcox v. First Interstate Bank of Oregon, N.A., 815 F.2d 522, 526 (9th Cir. 1977) (quoting 
Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 699, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777, 82 S. Ct. 1404 (1962)); see also City 
of Long Beach v. Standard Oil Co., 872 F.2d 1401, 1404-05 (9th Cir.), amended, 886 F.2d 246 (1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 
1076, 110 S. Ct. 1126, 107 L. Ed. 2d 1032 (1990). Thus, later in sections III-B and III-C we will consider appellants' claim that 
appellees exchanged various information to facilitate price coordination in the context of the parallel pricing evidence."
757,3," We note, however, that the parties sharply disagree over whether this correlation indicates sufficient ""control"" of the dealers to 
avoid the holding of Illinois Brick. Nonetheless, as stated earlier, we do not reach this issue. In analyzing the significance of the 
retail pricing data, we think it sufficient to note that, regardless of the specific degree of control over individual stations, 
movements in the appellees' wholesale prices generally influenced the retail prices that were charged by the dealers. The 
parties do not dispute this latter fact."
757,4," Curiously, the district court later went on to state, in apparent contradiction, that ""wholesale prices play a major part in any 
decision to set retail prices, and we therefore can assume that the defendants' wholesale prices had a tendency to follow a 
similar pattern"".  656 F. Supp. at 1300. We agree with this latter statement of the district court."
757,5," As used here, the term ""interdependent"" merely describes the phenomenon of sequential competitive pricing decisions that are 
each made (1) in response to the ones preceding it and (2) in hope or expectation of the ones that follow it. The legal 
significance of such conduct is analyzed below. "
758,6," Were it necessary to do so, we would be hard-pressed to conclude that interdependent pricing is ""inevitable"" or ""inherent"" in 
the gasoline markets at issue in this case. Given the generally rapid deterioration in prices that followed each restoration, any 
interdependence in the appellees' pricing behavior was at best imperfect. "
759,7," Thus, for example, the record indicates that in mid-February 1971, Union ""restored"" prices to its dealers in California by 
withdrawing dealer discounts, but when only two other companies followed suit, it reinstated dealer aid just a few days later."
759,8," In reaching this conclusion, we take note of the fact that the record indicates that the appellees generally learned quite rapidly 
of one another's price moves by reading about them in the trade press. In section III-B, infra, we consider the appellants' claim 
that the appellees' exchange of information through the trade press is, under the circumstances of this case, probative of a 
conspiracy. For purposes of the present analysis, however, we take the rapid dissemination of such pricing information as a 
given."
759,9," In some cases, when a market is highly unconcentrated, parallel pricing alone may be all the proof that is required. "
760,10," The record indicates that in the 1960s Exxon issued press releases concerning its withdrawal of dealer aid, but that it stopped 
doing so in 1969. Nonetheless, the record also indicates that Exxon continued to respond to press inquiries concerning its price 
moves. "
761,11," As noted earlier, the record indicates that price increases were occasionally announced in advance of their effective date. 
Such announcements are, of course, even more effective in allowing the price leader to communicate its intention and to receive 
reactions without having to incur substantial risk."
761,12," An inference that the parallel use of the trade press was the result of at least a tacit agreement is reasonable in light of the fact 
that, as noted in section III-C, infra, the use of the trade press was arguably a substitute for the direct competitor contacts that 
the appellees admit occurred during the period prior to the Court's decision in United States v. Container Corp., 393 U.S. 333, 21 
L. Ed. 2d 526, 89 S. Ct. 510 (1969)."
761,13," Consistent with the limited nature of the holding in Container, the Court has held that HN8[
] agreements to exchange pricing 
data do not themselves constitute a per se violation of the Sherman Act.  United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 
422, 441 n. 16, 57 L. Ed. 2d 854, 98 S. Ct. 2864 (1978). Accordingly, information exchanges help to establish an antitrust 
violation only when either (1) the exchange indicates the existence of an express or tacit agreement to fix or stabilize prices, or 
(2) the exchange is made pursuant to an express or tacit agreement that is itself a violation of § 1 under a rule of reason 
analysis. Given Container's conclusion that the agreement in that case fell within the per se ban against price fixing, see 393 
U.S. at 337-38 & n. 4 (citing United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 220-21, 84 L. Ed. 1129, 60 S. Ct. 811 
(1940)), it seems clear that Container falls into the first of these two classes. See Wilcox v. First Interstate Bank, 815 F.2d 522, 
526 (9th Cir. 1987) (noting that Container involved an agreement to fix prices); Hanson v. Shell Oil Co., 541 F.2d 1352, 1360 
(9th Cir. 1976) (characterizing Container as a case in which companies exchanged price information ""for the purpose of price 
stabilization""), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1074, 50 L. Ed. 2d 792, 97 S. Ct. 813 (1977). "
762,14," Our conclusion would necessarily be different were the appellants' inference of a price-fixing conspiracy based on the 
dissemination or advertising of retail prices; permitting an inference of conspiracy from such evidence would make it more 
difficult for retail consumers to get the information they need to make efficient market decisions. In the district court, the 
appellants did indeed base their claims in part on the public announcement of retail prices by dealers, but they have not pressed 
such a theory on appeal."
762,15," We also note that, as an alternative to using the price data dissemination evidence as a means of proving the existence of a 
per se illegal conspiracy to fix prices, the appellants on remand may also seek to challenge directly, under a rule of reason "
763,," analysis, the alleged agreement to exchange price information. See note 13 supra. Given the evidence indicating a lack of a 
strong procompetitive purpose for such data dissemination, the appellants' evidence clearly presents a jury question under this 
alternative theory. "
765,16," We disagree with the appellees' suggestion that the lack of agreement is clearly indicated by the diversity of publication 
practices. The fact that the appellees may have chosen different methods of publication does not imply that they did not each 
recognize and act upon a mutual understanding that such information would somehow be made available to competitors. "
768,17," As we found with the evidence of direct competitor contact in the pre-Container period, we also perceive no Matsushita 
problem in permitting an inference of conspiracy in the post-Container period for the same reasons. See vSection III-C-1 supra."
768,18," We note, however, that this evidence is direct evidence only of limited competitor contacts specifically described. It requires an 
additional inference to conclude that the existence of such contacts indicates the existence of other, undisclosed competitor 
conversations. As noted above, we conclude that, considered in the context of the other evidence in this case, such evidence 
does at least support a permissible inference that a number of the appellees continued to engage in occasional competitor 
contacts."
768,19," We note, however, that no independent oil company is presently a party in this action. "
769,20," During this period, Erdos was paid by Mobil for conducting surveys concerning wholesale prices in the independent market. "
772,21," We are not deciding the greater question of whether there was a conspiracy to fix prices. Nor are we deciding whether 
Galligan's testimony should be admitted during trial. When the lower court judge makes that decision he will not be viewing 
appellant's evidence from the same procedural posture. We simply are deciding the very narrow issue of whether the court can 
consider Galligan's testimony for the purposes of summary judgment on the discrete issue of independent dealer contacts."
772,22," Because there is direct evidence of defendant's efforts to coordinate pricing with the independent segment of the market, the 
Matsushita standards for summary judgment do not apply to this evidence.  McLaughlin, 849 F.2d at 1207. We simply decide 
whether there is a genuine issue of material fact.  Tzung v. State Farm Fire and Casualty Co., 873 F.2d 1338, 1339-40 (9th Cir. 
1989). "
775,23," Unlike the tankwagon price information discussed earlier, petroleum supply and demand information is important to a number 
of actors in the economy, and courts should hesitate to permit inferences of conspiracy based on the exchange of supply 
information alone. Such an inference will not have a negative deterrent effect, however, when it is based on the combination of 
actions and intent in this case. For example, while it might have harmful anticompetitive effects to allow an inference from the 
exchange of supply forecasts alone, it might not be harmful to allow that inference from supply forecasts and actions to reduce 
capacity and evidence of anticompetitive intent. Companies who were innocently distributing supply information would be 
unaffected by an antitrust rule that only prohibited the exchange of supply forecasts when accompanied by actions to reduce 
excess capacity and evidence of anticompetitive intent. Thus, permitting the inference in this case will not have an undue 
deterrent effect on the proper dissemination of petroleum supply and demand information. "
776,24," Because there is no evidence of the President's approval of the cartel's activities at issue we need not reach the question of 
whether it is within the powers of the executive branch to convey antitrust immunity through its acquiescence in an overseas 
consortium. "
777,25, Cal.Civ.Code § 3370.1 has since been recodified as Cal.Bus. & Prof.Code § 17206. 
781,1," Throughout this opinion the court uses the term ""University defendants"" to refer to The University of Utah, Intermountain 
Radiopharmacy, the State Board of Regents, and all those persons (including David Bragg in his official capacity) named in 
PDS's first amended complaint who are affiliated with the University of Utah and who are sued in their official capacities."
781,2," Throughout the remainder of this opinion, the term ""the complaint"" refers to PDS's first amended complaint."
781,3," PDS's complaint also named as defendants the United States of America, Secretary of the Treasury Nicholas Brady, and 
Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Laurence Gibbs (the ""federal defendants""). PDS sought to enjoin the federal 
defendants from continuing to grant the University of Utah tax exempt status pursuant to 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(3), or in the 
alternative, to require the federal defendants to assess and collect taxes allegedly due as a result of the sale of 
radiopharmaceuticals at a profit. On September 14, 1989, the court granted the federal defendants' motion to dismiss, holding 
that PDS lacked standing to seek relief against the federal defendants. "
782,4," HN2[
] The language of the Eleventh Amendment provides as follows: The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of 
another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State. U.S. Const. amend XI."
782,5," There is no suggestion here that the state has consented to suit against the University of Utah by expressly waiving its 
immunity."
782,6," In addition, the Utah Governmental Immunity Act defines the term ""State"" to include ""any office, department, agency, authority, 
commission, board, institution, hospital, college, university, or other instrumentality of the state."" Utah Code Ann. § 63-30-2(9) 
(1986 & 1988 Supp.). Hence, in denoting those entities protected by state law immunity, the Legislature specifically considered 
the University of Utah and Board of Regents instrumentalities of the state. "
783,7," PDS urges the court to adopt an opinion of the Utah Attorney General to the effect that the University is not an arm of the state 
for purposes of Eleventh Amendment immunity. See Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-001 (May 8, 1987) at 46-47. The opinion, though 
informative, is not authoritative. This court is unwilling to give greater credence to the Attorney General's non-binding opinion 
than to Utah statutory structure and the Utah Supreme Court's construction of that structure."
783,8," The court specifically rejects PDS's suggestion that a judgment against the University is not necessarily a judgment against the 
state. While it may be true that a significant proportion of University funding comes from non-state sources, it is a fiction to 
suggest that a judgment against the University will not ultimately be made up through state appropriations. Any use of non-state 
funds to satisfy a judgment inevitably will necessitate increased state outlays. See Ferguson v. Greater Pocatello Chamber of 
Commerce, 647 F. Supp. 190, 192 (D. Idaho 1985) (Idaho State University is immune under Eleventh Amendment since 
judgment would ultimately ""impact"" on state treasury). "
784,9," PDS insists that the court should at least allow factual discovery into the relationship between IRP, the University, and the 
state. And indeed it is true that ""each state university exists in a unique governmental context, and each must be considered on 
the basis of its own peculiar circumstances."" Soni v. Board of Trustees, 513 F.2d 347, 352 (6th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 426 U.S. 
919 (1976). In this case, however, the court need only look to the peculiarities of Utah law. Utah law, as distinguished from any 
detailed factual inquiry, clearly renders the University of Utah an arm of the state. Factual discovery would in no way alter the 
state law basis of this court's conclusion. See Prebble, 535 F.2d at 610 (relying on the Wyoming Constitution and statutes to 
hold that University of Wyoming is immune under Eleventh Amendment)."
784,10," See Prebble, 535 F.2d at 610 (University of Wyoming); Brennan, 451 F.2d at 1290-91 (University of Kansas)."
784,11," The court in Durham v. Parks, 564 F. Supp. 244, 246 (D. Minn. 1983), surveyed a number of cases that dealt with the status 
of state universities under the Eleventh Amendment. The Durham court concluded that ""the majority of courts which have 
considered the 'alter ego' relationship of a state university to its state have concluded that a suit against the university is a suit 
against the state for the purposes of the eleventh amendment."" Id."
784,12," Count II of PDS's complaint alleges that PDS is entitled to a declaratory judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 
57 and the federal Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201. However, the declaratory judgment sought in Count II is based 
on state law violations, and the Declaratory Judgment Act does not extend the subject matter jurisdiction of federal courts. See 
10A C. Wright, A. Miller & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2766 (2d ed. 1983) (""there must be an independent basis 
of [federal] jurisdiction, . . . before a federal court may entertain a declaratory judgment action""). Thus, the only alleged federal 
law bases for injunctive relief are the Sherman and Clayton Acts. "
785,13," The United States Supreme Court has yet to pass upon the specific question whether state executive agencies are entitled to 
Parker antitrust immunity. See Hoover, 446 U.S. at 568 n.17. Neither has the Tenth Circuit treated that specific question."
785,14," Again, PDS would have the court rely upon an Opinion of the Utah Attorney General, which concluded that the University of 
Utah was not the state acting in its sovereign capacity for purposes of Parker antitrust immunity. See Op. Att'y Gen. No. 85-002 
(Oct. 21 1985). However, the court notes once again that the opinion is non-binding. The opinion does not even mention the 
Fifth and Ninth Circuit cases decided before it was rendered, and it could not have considered the Charley's Taxi decision 
because it was decided after the Attorney General opinion was rendered. "
786,15," The University defendants suggest that Pennhurst may have entirely eliminated the ultra vires exception. It is true that the 
Pennhurst Court did ""question the continued vitality of the ultra vires doctrine in the Eleventh Amendment context."" 465 U.S. at 
114 n.25. The Court concluded that ""to the extent the [ultra vires] doctrine is consistent with the analysis of this opinion, it is a 
very narrow exception. . . ."" Id. This court need not pass upon the continued existence or nonexistence of the ultra vires doctrine because it holds that the 
University defendants' activities are not ""without any authority whatever."" Florida Dept. of State v. Treasure Salvors, Inc., 458 
U.S. 670, 697 (1982)."
786,16," At issue are the provisions of Board of Regents Rule 765-555, which PDS suggests have been incorporated into the Utah 
Administrative Code. Utah Code Ann. §§ 63-46a-2, -16 (1989). Rule 765-555 is entitled ""Policy on Colleges and Universities 
Providing Facilities, Goods and Services in Competition with Private Enterprise."" The Rule provides in pertinent part: R765-555-4. Policy"

786,17," It is arguable whether the University defendants' activities through IRP violate Rule 765-555 or other provisions of Utah law at 
all. Even so, under Pennhurst's Eleventh Amendment analysis, the court does not focus on the violation or nonviolation of state "
787,," law. Rather, the query is whether the activities are ""without any authority whatever."" Pennhurst, 465 U.S. at 101 n.11. In this 
case it is clear that the University defendants' activities are not without any authority whatever. PDS's reliance on Miami Univ. Assoc. Student Gov't v. Shriver, 735 F.2d 201 (6th Cir. 1984), is unavailing. In that case, the Sixth 
Circuit, in dicta, merely directed the district court to consider on remand the effect of Pennhurst on its ability to order compliance 
with state law. The court hinted, without holding, that Miami University officials' attempts to enforce a student ""no-car"" policy off-
campus may be without any authority whatever. Id. at 204. The court suggested that the ultra vires doctrine survived Pennhurst, 
but did not hold that the doctrine applied to the facts of the particular case. Id. "
799,1," A ""full service vendor"" is one who, in addition to supplying and maintaining the machines themselves, stocks them with

] The only significant distinction between Sections 1 and 3 lies in the geographical area covered by each statute. Section 1 (as well as Section 2) regulates interstate commerce, and was enacted pursuant to Congress' power under the 
Commerce Clause of the Constitution. U.S. Const. art. 1, § 8, cl. 3. Section 3 regulates commerce in the District of Columbia 
(and in United States territories), and rests in part upon Congress' power to enact legislation for the District of Columbia. Id. at cl. 
17. See United States v. National Association of Real Estate Boards, 339 U.S. 485, 488, 94 L. Ed. 1007, 70 S. Ct. 711 (1950); 
Darnell v. Markwood, 95 U.S. App. D.C. 111, 220 F.2d 374, 376 (1954). Section 3 also regulates commerce between the District 
of Columbia and states or territories. Thus, plaintiff's federal claims alleging conspiracy or restraint of trade which involve 
interstate conduct properly fall within Section 1, while those federal claims involving conduct within the District of Columbia or 
between the District and neighboring states fall within Section 3. As discussed below in connection with the pendent claims, 
plaintiff's Amended Complaint does not specify where the transactions at issue took place. Nevertheless, it is not necessary to 
determine which section applies to a particular claim, because either Section 1 or Section 3 will govern. "
801,3," Although Sun Dun has asserted that ""all four defendants combined and conspired,"" Amended Complaint, at para. 57, plaintiff is 
in fact alleging the existence of three separate conspiracies: a vertical conspiracy between PepsiCo and General Cinema, 
another vertical conspiracy between Coca-Cola and Mid-Atlantic, and a horizontal conspiracy between General Cinema and 
Mid-Atlantic. Any doubts with regard to the more ambiguous allegations throughout this count and the rest of the complaint are 
resolved by Sun Dun's own memorandum in opposition to the motions to dismiss. On pages 4-5 of its Opposition, plaintiff 
expressly states that it does not allege a conspiracy between Coca-Cola and PepsiCo."
801,4," Transshipment refers to the practice of resellers selling to other resellers outside of their territory. Pennsylvania ex rel. 
Zimmerman v. PepsiCo, Inc., 836 F.2d 173, 174-75 (3d Cir. 1988)."
801,5," ""Vertical arrangements"" refer to agreements between the manufacturers and their respective bottler/distributors. It is through 
such agreements that Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are able to impose fines on distributors who overstep their territorial bounds by 
transshipping. "
802,6," HN8[
] The Act does not purport to grant antitrust immunities. See H.R. Rep. No. 1118, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 2 (1980). Its 
protections represent a legislative response to questions over the proper application to the soft drink industry of the ""rule of 
reason"" approach to vertical restraints re-adopted by the Supreme Court in Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 
36, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568, 97 S. Ct. 2549 (1977). Under this standard, vertical restraints such as those at issue in this case do not 
violate the antitrust laws if the overall effect of the restraint is to promote interbrand competition. After an in-depth investigation of 
the industry, Congress determined that ""the public policy stated in the antitrust laws would be better served by the retention of 
the existing competitive structure [including vertical restraints] of the soft drink industry under the standards of this bill."" S. Rep. 
No. 645, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 9 (1980). See Zimmerman, 836 F.2d at 175-76. Thus, while there is no price-fixing conduct alleged against either Coca-Cola or PepsiCo, the allegations pertaining to their 
enforcement of vertical restraints could conceivably subject them to § 1 liability, if (1) it is eventually established that the Act 
does not apply and (2) the conduct of the two manufacturers fails an independent rule-of-reason analysis under Sylvania. "
803,7," HN12[
] As with Section 1 of the Sherman Act, Section 2 regulates interstate commerce and was enacted pursuant to Congress' power under the Commerce Clause. See supra note 2. On its face, Section 2 does not purport to regulate commerce 
in the District of Columbia, as does Section 3. Nevertheless, because all four defendants are incorporated and do business 
outside of the District of Columbia, the Court will assume, for purposes of ruling on these motions, that at least some of the 
alleged monopolization activity by the defendants was interstate in nature, and therefore would fall within Section 2. Because the 
Section 2 claims fail for the reasons set forth infra, the Court need not decide whether the statute would govern monopolization 
which occurred between states and the District of Columbia. "
804,8," See supra note 3. The only allegations in Count IV pertaining to conscious parallel behavior are directed toward the bottler 
defendants. The manufacturers are alleged to have participated in the maintenance of an illegal oligopoly only through their 
enforcement of the vertical restraints. "
805,9," Indeed, the whole issue of the applicability of Sherman Act § 2 to so-called ""shared monopolies"" is a matter debated among the 
treatise writers. Compare 3 P. Areeda & D. Turner, supra, paras. 842-862 (arguing for regulation of oligopoly under § 2) with 2 E. 
Kintner, Federal Antitrust Law § 12.1 (1980) (actual monopolization can be accomplished only by a single firm)."
805,10," Conversely, in its recent decision in Stephen Jay Photography, Ltd. v. Olan Mills, Inc., 713 F. Supp. 937, slip op. at 18-19, (4th 
Cir. 1990), the Fourth Circuit affirmed the granting of defendants' motion for summary judgment on a Section 2 claim, based on 
an alleged conspiracy between competitors to monopolize. The appellate court's decision, however, rested on the absence of 
evidence of a conspiracy; the opinion did not address the issue of whether competitors could ever conspire to monopolize in 
violation of Section 2."
805,11," Horizontal conspiracies among competitors have not been contemplated as candidates for monopoly regulation in subsequent 
legislation either. The SDICA, for example, exempts from protection the private enforcement of vertical restrictions by means of 
price-fixing agreements, horizontal restraints of trade, or group boycotts. 15 U.S.C. § 3502 (1982). Each of these means of 
enforcement violates § 1 of the Sherman Act. Were conspiracy to monopolize among competitors possible, we would be left with 
the anomalous result that horizontal conspiracy to monopolize might be a protected means of enforcement of vertical restraints. "
806,12, See supra notes 3 and 8.
806,13," As is suggested by these elements, HN20[
] the essential facilities doctrine relates most directly to a claim of monopolization under Section 2 of the Sherman Act. See Hendricks Music Co. v. Steinway, Inc., 689 F. Supp. 1501, 1509 (N.D. Ill. 1988). 
Nevertheless, some courts have applied the doctrine to claims under Sections 1 and 3 as well. See, e.g., Hecht v. Pro-Football, 
Inc., 187 U.S. App. D.C. 73, 570 F.2d 982, 992-93 (D.C. Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 436 U.S. 956, 57 L. Ed. 2d 1121, 98 S. Ct. 
3069 (1978); Beverage Management, Inc. v. Coca-Cola Bottling Corp., 653 F. Supp. 1144, 1156 (S.D. Ohio 1986). Because, as 
discussed infra, Sun Dun has otherwise failed to state a claim under the essential facilities doctrine, the Court need not decide 
the scope of the doctrine's application. "
807,14," HN22[
] Even firms that are nominally competitors, if they act as a single economic entity with respect to the facility (e.g., by 
sharing a single facility), may be subject to liability under the doctrine. See Turf Paradise, Inc. v. Arizona Downs, 670 F.2d 813, 
822 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 1011, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1308, 102 S. Ct. 2308 (1982)."

808,16," As discussed above, see supra note 2, HN28[
] the Constitution grants Congress the power to legislate for the District of Columbia. U.S. Const. art. 1, § 8, cl. 17. Through the Home Rule Act, Congress has ceded some of that authority to the D.C. 
Council. See D.C. Code §§ 1-206, -233 (1981) (limits on Council's legislative authority). The D.C. Code provisions at issue here 
were enacted by the Council, subject to the congressional oversight provided for in § 1-233(c), and ""subject to the retention by 
Congress of the ultimate legislative authority over the nation's capital granted by article I, § 8, of the Constitution."" Id. § 1-201(a). 
The Supreme Court long ago determined that ""there is no constitutional barrier to the delegation by Congress to the District of 
Columbia of full legislative power."" District of Columbia v. John R. Thompson Co., 346 U.S. 100, 109, 97 L. Ed. 1480, 73 S. Ct. 
1007 (1953). "
810,17," The Court finds it interesting that Sun Dun relies on Maryland common law, but District of Columbia statutory law, for relief 
from various harms arising from the same conduct by the defendants. As noted above, the defendants maintain that Sun Dun 
has invoked the D.C. Code only because it provides relief to an indirect purchaser, which is unavailable under federal and 
Maryland antitrust statutes. Although Sun Dun might have suffered separate injuries in Maryland and the District of Columbia, 
which would allow the law of each jurisdiction to apply to the respective harms, this apparent discrepancy in Sun Dun's pleading 
raises further questions about whether the D.C. Code can in fact apply to any of plaintiff's alleged injuries. "
817,1," Based on the court's decision as to the defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment the plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary 
Judgment and Motion to Compel are rendered moot. Also pending is a Motion for Reconsideration of the court's previous denial

geographic market as the entire United States, see 731 F. Supp. at 5-6, and the relevant product as three types of HHUDRS: 
face drills (""jumbos""), long-hole drills, and roof-bolting drills, as well as associated spare parts, components, and accessories, 
and used drills. See id. at 4, 6-8. Although the appellees quibble with the court's product market definition, they conclude that ""the [district] court's product market 
definition presages its finding that the extent of present competition and ease of entry preclude finding a violation of Section 7."" 
Brief for Appellees at 10 (emphasis added). If the appellees believe that the court's product market definition contributed to their 
victory, we see no reason to address their halfhearted and contradictory challenges to that definition."
842,3," From 1986 through 1988, Tamrock had an average 40.8% share of the United States HHUDR market, while Secoma's share 
averaged 17.5%.  731 F. Supp. at 6. In 1988 alone, the two firms enjoyed a combined share of 76% of the market. (The district 
court inaccurately calculated this figure as 66%. See id. at 10; Brief for Appellant at 10 n. 10; Brief for Appellees att. A.) The 
acquisition thus has brought about a dramatic increase in the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) -- a yardstick of concentration -- 
for this market. The Department of Justice's Merger Guidelines characterize as ""highly concentrated"" any market in which the 
HHI exceeds 1800. See United States Dep't of Justice, Merger Guidelines § 3.1 (June 14, 1984), reprinted in 4Trade Reg.Rep. 
(CCH) P. 13,103, at 20,561-64 (1988). Using the 1986-1988 figures, this acquisition has increased the HHI in this market from 
2878 to 4303. Brief for Appellant at 5 n. 3, 12 (computed from 731 F. Supp. at 6). "
843,4," Even if we found more impressive the argument that the district court did not clearly articulate the legal standard applicable to a

330, 838 F.2d 1280, 1285 (D.C.Cir. 1988) (""We HN3[

'may be substantially to lessen competition' (emphasis supplied), to indicate that its concern was with probabilities, not

847,9," Some of these firms have already tried, but failed, to penetrate the United States HHUDR market. As the district court correctly 
noted, however, failed entry in the past does not necessarily imply failed entry in the future: if prices reach supracompetitive 
levels, a company that has failed to enter in the past could become competitive. See 731 F. Supp. at 11; cf.  Cargill, Inc. v.

849,12," Judge Posner has elucidated this point: The most important developments that cast doubt on the continued vitality of such cases as Brown Shoe and Von's are 
found in other cases, where the Supreme Court, echoed by the lower courts, has said repeatedly that the economic 
concept of competition, rather than any desire to preserve rivals as such, is the lodestar that shall guide the contemporary 
application of the antitrust laws, not excluding the Clayton Act. . . . Applied to cases brought under Section 7, this principle 
requires the district court . . . to make a judgment whether the challenged acquisition is likely to hurt consumers, as by 
making it easier for the firms in the market to collude, expressly or tacitly, and thereby force price above or farther above 
the competitive level.  Hospital Corp. of Am. v. FTC, 807 F.2d 1381, 1386 (7th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 481 U.S. 1038, 107 S. Ct. 1975, 95 L. Ed. 2d

dinner party and announced that he would raise his commissions. The other realtors soon followed suit. But the Foley court does 
not rely on the dinner party and announcement to find a conspiracy. There was other strong evidence: letters and phone calls 
among the realtors exhorting each other to charge the higher rate and fearing that deviation would ruin the plan. Based on that 
evidence, the court had little trouble affirming the conviction."

San Fernando Valley Bd. of Realtors, 786 F.2d 1400, 1406, 1407 (9th Cir. 1986) (confronted with evidence that real estate 
brokers made disparaging comments to potential home buyers about the plaintiff discount brokers, including that plaintiff was ""no 
good, unethical, worthless and of generally bad repute,"" the court concluded that this conduct did not ""add up to a conspiracy by 
the [defendants] to restrain trade""). "
862,10," ""Because the buyer's broker represents only the buyer, the listing broker or some other representative of the seller must be 
present to represent the seller when a buyer tours a house. The buyer's broker is unable to demonstrate the house on behalf of 
the seller. The buyer's broker is unable to answer, on behalf of the seller, questions the buyer may have about the condition of 
the property, financing concessions, closing and occupancy dates, and the like. The listing broker is unable to give a lockbox 
combination to a buyer's broker. The Wauwatosa Realty Company listing agent is forced to fulfill many of the functions of the 
traditional selling agent in such transactions."" R.67 at 7 (Glawe Affidavit). "
867,1," The complaint involved in this appeal alleges Cartwright Act violations with regard to films licensed by appellees from 1985-88. 
Gulf Western was not a named party in Redwood I. "
869,2," See also Price v. PSA, Inc., 829 F.2d 871, 876 n. 4 (9th Cir. 1987)(describing Sullivan as limiting the artful pleading doctrine to 
cases ""where a plaintiff is seeking to circumvent the res judicata impact of a federal judgment""), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1006, 108 
S. Ct. 1732, 100 L. Ed. 2d 196 (1988). As this court's opinion in Ultramar points out, ""in Price no prior federal judgment even 
existed, and the court only described Sullivan to stress that this fact rendered application of the artful pleading doctrine 
inappropriate."" 900 F.2d at 1416 n. 7; accord, United Jersey Banks, 783 F.2d at 368 (case in which five state banks sought 
under New Jersey statutes to block merger of two nationally chartered banks. Defendants removed the case to federal court, 
claiming that the complaint raised questions of federal law, and the district court denied the plaintiffs' motion to remand. The 
Third Circuit reversed, finding that ""this is not a case . . . in which the plaintiff first filed a lawsuit containing federal claims and 
then, after dismissal, sought to recast those claims under state law [;] here, plaintiff has consistently sought to litigate state 
claims in state court"") (emphasis added). "
870,3," See 200 Cal. App. 3d at 694, where the court observed that: '[a] long line of California cases has concluded that HN10[
] the Cartwright Act is patterned after the Sherman Act and 
both statutes have their roots in the common law. Consequently, federal cases interpreting the Sherman Act are applicable 
to problems arising under the Cartwright Act.'  Id., quoting Marin County Bd. of Realtors v. Palsson, 16 Cal. 3d 920, 925, 130 Cal. Rptr. 1, 549 P.2d 833 (1976). Accordingly, 
the court stated that ""since the relevant case law under the Cartwright Act is comparatively sparse, we will also rely chiefly on 
federal decisions"" to evaluate Redwood's antitrust claims. Id."
870,4," In Exxon, the Supreme Court rejected the appellant oil companies' ""novel suggestion that because the economic market for 
petroleum products is nationwide, no State has the power to regulate the retail marketing of gas,"" and upheld the state regulation 
at issue.  437 U.S. 117, 128, 98 S. Ct. 2207, 57 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1978). "
871,5," The result in Partee does not undermine the substantive analysis of appellees' commerce-clause claim, supra: the Supreme 
Court based its decision on the fact that the Cartwright Act previously had been held inapplicable to professional baseball and 
basketball and that ""no case has been found applying state antitrust laws to the interstate activities of professional sports."" 34 
Cal. 3d at 384."
871,6," In the alternative appellees urge us to find that Redwood has acceded to federal jurisdiction. They offer no compelling reasons, 
however, for us to disregard ""the traditional rule that HN13[
] the parties cannot by consent, waiver or estoppel obtain federal 
subject matter jurisdiction,"" and we therefore reject their suggestion.  Sullivan, 813 F.2d at 1374. "
874,1," After the complaint was issued, the state of Vermont deregulated the intrastate transportation of freight, and NEMRB ceased to 
formulate and file rates applicable to Vermont. Complaint counsel moved to dismiss the complaint with respect to NEMRB's 
activities in Vermont, and the Administrative Law Judge granted that motion."
874,2," The decision of the FTC with regard to New Hampshire is not being appealed. The New Hampshire statute at the time of the 
FTC decision required carriers to file their rates; and such rates were to be nondiscriminatory, but the statute did not require that 
they be just and reasonable. Subsequently, the statute was amended to require the rates of motor carriers of property to be just 
and reasonable. The state is also now engaged in establishing policies and procedures to implement the revised statutory 
framework. NEMRB says that it may seek revision of the FTC order as soon as the new regulatory framework is in place."
874,3," Rates are also filed with the federal Interstate Commerce Commission with respect to interstate shipments. Federal law 
recognizes the right of rate bureaus to formulate and file collective rates for members, exempt from antitrust laws. 49 U.S.C. § 
10706(b). "
875,4," MDPU also employs 12 inspectors who have police power to enforce Massachusetts' motor carrier statutes. One of their duties 
is to spot check carriers to investigate complaints that they are not charging the rates they have filed. Stipulation 72 of August 
28, 1986."
875,5," In 1978 the language of the federal statute was changed from ""just and reasonable"" to ""reasonable"" for clarity, consistency, 
and to conform to modern usage. See 49 U.S.C. § 10701(a) (1990) and accompanying ""Historical and Statutory Notes."" No 
change in the meaning of the statutory language was intended. Id. "
877,6," While the Court upheld the collective rate making arrangements in Southern Motor Carriers, it did not address the ""active 
supervision"" component of the Midcal formula, as active supervision was conceded."
877,7," ""Pointed re-examination of the program"" is apparently derived from a statement in an opinion of the California Supreme Court 
in which that court referred to ""'pointed re-examination' by the state to insure that the policies of the Sherman Act are not 
'unnecessarily subordinated' to state policy."" Rice v. Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Board, 21 Cal. 3d 431, 445, 579 P.2d

878,8," It is hereby declared to be the policy of the commonwealth to regulate transportation of property by motor carriers upon its 
ways in such manner as to recognize and preserve the inherent advantages of such transportation, and to foster sound 
economic conditions in such transportation and among carriers engaged therein in the public interest; and in connection 
therewith to: (1) Promote adequate, economical and efficient service by motor carriers, and reasonable charges therefor, without 
unjust discriminations undue preferences or advantages or unfair or destructive competitive practices, (2) improve the relations 
between, and coordinate transportation by and regulation of, motor carriers and other carriers, (3) develop and preserve a 
highway transportation system properly adapted to the needs of the commerce of the commonwealth, and (4) promote safety 
upon its ways in the interests of its citizens. Mass.Gen.L. ch. 159B, § 1 (1986)."
878,9," In the exercise of the power to prescribe just and reasonable rates for the transportation of property by common carriers by 
motor vehicle and to disallow rates filed by any such carrier, the department shall give due consideration, among other factors, 
to the inherent advantages of transportation by such carrier, to the effect of any rates under consideration upon the movement of 
traffic by such carriers, to the need in the public interest of adequate and efficient transportation service by such carriers, to the 
cost of service and to the need of revenues sufficient to enable such carriers under honest, economical and efficient 
management to provide such service. Mass.Gen.L. ch. 159B, § 6, para. 6 (1986) (emphasis added). "
880,10," Such duties are enforceable by mandamus and other legal remedies in state courts. They are not mere precatory maxims. 
See Lutheran Serv. Ass'n of New England, Inc. v. Metropolitan Dist. Comm'n, 397 Mass. 341, 344, 491 N.E.2d 255, 257 (Mass.

880,11," Stipulation 55 of August 28, 1986 reads: ""The MDPU is authorized to reject or suspend proposed rates which are not 
consistent with the statute or the MDPU's orders, rules and regulations."" See also Mass.Gen.L. ch. 159B, § 6, paras. 1, 2 (1986) 
(""The department may reject any tariff filed with it which is not consistent with this section and with its orders, rules and 
regulations under this chapter."") Stipulation 61 reads: ""The MDPU, upon complaint of any motor common carrier of property or any other person, or upon its own 
motion, after hearing, may allow or disallow any filed or existing rates and may alter or prescribe rates in accordance with the 
legal standards provided."" See Mass.Gen.L. ch. 159B, § 6, para. 5 (1986)."
880,12," Stipulation 51 of August 28, 1986 provides: A carrier has the right to seek whatever rate it desires. No one at the MDPU looks behind the filed rates to determine 
whether they accurately reflect a carrier's profits and costs. The rate analyst has never requested financial information to 
support a tariff nor has he rejected a rate because of the price to be charged. However, if confronted with a tariff containing 
rates that in his judgment are out of line with the average rates that have been established in the involved pricing zone, or 
seem extraordinarily high, such as a 20% to 50% increase, he would recommend suspension and investigation of the tariff 
by the MDPU Commissioners. (emphasis added) Stipulation 62 of August 28, 1986 provides: It is the opinion of the rate analyst that whenever tariffs become effective without rejection, suspension or hearing, that 
action results from a determination that the proposed rates meet the regulatory criteria of the statute, orders, rules and 
regulations pertaining to motor carriers of property. (emphasis added) There is a rate analyst and one clerk who is responsible for processing filed motor carrier rates. Stipulations 44 and 45, August 
28, 1986. There are 12 field inspectors who have police power to enforce the Massachusetts motor carrier statute; among other 
duties they spot check for rate violations. Stipulation 72. Stipulation 75 of August 28, 1986 provides: "
881,," If a complaint alleges a violation of Chapter 159B [the motor carrier laws, including those pertaining to rates] or any order, 
rule or regulation adopted thereunder, it will be investigated and appropriate action taken if warranted. Private complaints may be filed with the MDPU and are required by law to be investigated by the agency. Violations of the 
Massachusetts motor carrier statute are punishable by fine and may be enjoined in the Massachusetts courts at the instance of 
private parties as well as of the MDPU. Stipulation 76."
881,13," Stipulation 78 of August 28, 1986 provides: Aside from its role in reviewing proposed rates, MDPU does not monitor economic conditions in the intrastate trucking 
industry of Massachusetts. "
882,14," Stipulation 120 of August 28, 1986 reads: Aside from its role in reviewing proposed rates, [the Division of Public Utilities and Carriers] does not monitor economic 
conditions in the intrastate trucking industry of Rhode Island."
882,15," For example, the MDPU receives rate justification data from NEMRB which the latter provides to the ICC. It is also advised as 
to the ICC's actions as to such filings, and presumably would learn of actions by regulatory agencies of other states."
882,16,"  The department, upon complaint of any common carrier . . . or any other person, or upon its own motion, after hearing, may 
allow or disallow any filed or existing rates. . . . Whenever, upon complaint or in an investigation on its own initiative, the 
department, after hearing, shall be of the opinion that any rate or charge demanded, charged or collected by any common 
carrier by motor vehicle . . . is or will be unjust or prejudicial, it shall determine and prescribe the lawful rate of charge . . . 
thereafter to be made effective. HN3[
] Mass.Gen.L. ch. 159B, § 6, para. 5 (1986) (emphasis added). See also id. para. 6, quoted in note 8 supra, for the guidelines the MDPU must follow in the exercise of its duty to overrule unjust 
or prejudicial rates. "
883,17," Stipulation 51 of August 28, 1986 reads: If confronted with a tariff containing rates that in his judgment are out of line with the average rates that have been 
established in the involved pricing zone, or seem extraordinarily high, such as a 20% to 50% increase, [the rate analyst] 
would recommend suspension and investigation of the tariff by the MDPU Commissioners. Likewise, if a tariff appeared to 
contain discriminatory provisions, such as being applicable only for the account of a named shipper or shippers rather than 
being available to the general public, the [Commercial Motor Vehicle Division] would recommend suspension and 
investigation. Stipulation 62 of August 28, 1986 reads: It is the opinion of the rate analyst that whenever tariffs become effective without rejection, suspension or hearing, that 
action results from a determination that the proposed rates meet the regulatory criteria of the statute, orders, rules and 
regulations pertaining to motor carriers of property."
883,18," We agree with commentators who state that a court (and, by analogy, the FTC in its adjudicatory capacity) should not 
scrutinize the rigor with which the state supervises the challenged activity to ensure that supervision is more than pro forma. P. 
Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law, § 213c, at 75 (1978). Instead, for many of the same reasons that the Supreme Court 
refuses strictly to scrutinize state economic regulation under the Fourteenth Amendment, the antitrust adjudicatory body must 
accept the state's apparent supervision on its face. P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law, § 213c, at 75 (1978). There simply is no way to tell if the state has ""looked"" hard enough at the data, and there certainly are no manageable 
judicial standards by which a court may weigh the various elements of a ""public interest"" judgment in order to determine "
884,," whether the legislature or agency decision was correct. Those are political judgments and ought to be made by the 
legislature and its delegates. Id. See also United States v. Topco Associates, 405 U.S. 596, 611-12, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515, 92 S. Ct. 1126 (1972) (Brennan, J., 
concurring) (""To analyze, interpret, and evaluate the myriad of competing interests and the endless data that would [] be brought 
to bear on [] decisions"" to sacrifice competition in one portion of the economy for greater competition in another portion, ""and to 
make the delicate judgment on the relative values to society of competitive areas of the economy, the judgment of the elected 
representatives of the people is required."" ""Courts are ill-equipped and ill-situated for such decision-making.""); Denver Rockets 
v. All-Pro Management, Inc., 325 F. Supp. 1049, 1063 (C.D.Cal. 1971) (""The primary disadvantages of the 'rule of reason' are 
that it requires difficult and lengthy factual inquiries and very subjective policy decisions which are in many ways essentially 
legislative and ill-suited to the judicial process.""). Areeda and Turner believe that ""an allegation that state officials customarily 'rubber stamp' the self-interested decisions or 
recommendations of the private parties involved should not ordinarily oust Parker immunity."" P. Areeda & D. Turner, § 213c, at 
75 (1978). See also Llewellyn v. Crothers, 765 F.2d 769 (9th Cir. 1985): The availability of Parker immunity . . . does not depend on the subjective motivations of the individual actors, but rather on 
the satisfaction of the objective standards set forth in Parker and authorities which interpret it. This must be so if the state 
action exemption is to remain faithful to its foundations in federalism and state sovereignty.  Id. at 774 (emphasis added). "
889,1," AT & T, 552 F. Supp. at 226-34. Rafferty's description of the decree as purportedly restricting the Regional Companies to three 
lines of business (Opposition at 1) is incorrect."
889,2," NYNEX disputes Rafferty's account of the scope of the waiver and of what he was told about the legality of Telco's consulting 
operation under the consent decree. The Court, however, must accept Rafferty's account of these events for purposes of the 
motion for summary judgment. "
890,3," Plaintiff also asserts that on several other occasions he brought to NYNEX's attention activities involving Telco that he believed 
to be violative of the decree."
890,4," For example, and simply for purposes of illustration of a wider phenomenon, plaintiff contends that it is defendants' claim that 
the Court is barred as a matter of law from allowing a jury to disbelieve his witnesses (Opposition at 11); that there is no genuine 
dispute as to the evidence on the wrongful hire and employment theory (Opposition at 23); that with respect to the second claim 
NYNEX ""relies exclusively on [the] Control Data [case]"" (Opposition at 24); and that all but one of defendants' antitrust 
precedents deal only with the admissibility of consent decrees at trial (Opposition at 17). None of these statements is true. See 
also, note 18, infra, and the litany of plaintiff's false or unsupported statements in defendants' Reply at 32-35. Inasmuch as Rafferty is a member of the bar who apparently could afford to hire competent counsel but refuses to do so, the 
Court will in the future hold him to the same standard as other members of the bar. Accordingly, misrepresentations or 
misstatements of law or fact may, in appropriate circumstances, lead to sanctions."
890,5," See, e.g., p. 329, infra."
890,6," In addition to his thirty-nine page memorandum, plaintiff has filed a ""concise"" statement of issues consisting of sixty-one pages. 
That statement fails to comply with Rule 108(h) of the Rules of this Court, in that it includes pages upon pages or facts that are 
entirely irrelevant to the motion for summary judgment. In part, this may be due to inexperience (see p. 326, supra), but the filing 
is also consistent with plaintiff's practice of sometimes inundating the Court and the opposing party with materials in large 
volume, some of them relevant, many of them irrelevant, and some of them relevant to other pleadings or lawsuits plaintiff may 
have pending, so as to lay the groundwork for later complaints that not everything had been controverted or decided. Another 
effect of this practice is to compel the opposing party and the Court to refine the issues on their own so as to permit them to 
make presentations or judgments on the question whether there are genuine issues of material fact. That is, of course, improper. 
See Frito-Lay v. Willoughby, 274 U.S. App. D.C. 340, 863 F.2d 1029, 1034 (D.C.Cir. 1988). See also, note 39, infra. Nevertheless, the Court has waded through this material on this occasion (although it could have deemed defendants' proposed 
facts to be admitted on account of plaintiff's failure to comply with Rule 108(h)). See Simpson v. WMATA, 688 F. Supp. 765, 768 
(D.D.C. 1988). However, hereafter it will require this plaintiff, like all litigants, to comply with the rules of procedure. See also, 
note 4, supra. [**6]"
890,7," Rafferty's description of his first claim is headed ""Antitrust Whistleblowing"" -- a non-existent legal category. His legal argument 
on this claim is divided into various sections that are inappropriate for a summary judgment brief. "
891,8," Defendants argue at length (Memorandum at 31-38) that the facts do not support plaintiff's claim that he was terminated, inter 
alia, because he sought legal advice. It is not necessary to decide the factual dispute underlying this antitrust claim, and the 
Court does not do so."
891,9," The claim fails to provide an explanation of the statutes and theories which support it. In answers to interrogatories Rafferty 
asserts that Count Two refers to a violation of Section 4 of the Clayton Act, and that there is no evidence of violations of 
Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. Response to Interrogatories 1-3. In his Opposition to the motion for summary judgment, 
however, Rafferty suggests that ""defendants cannot establish at summary judgment that there is no relevant violation of 
Sherman Sections 1 or 2."" Opposition at 19 & n. 14. Even if the issue were open in view of the interrogatory answers, plaintiff 
could not possibly establish either market power in the consulting market or the requisite combination or conspiracy for a 
Sherman Act claim. See, e.g., Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 759-77, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628, 104 S. 
Ct. 2731 (1984). Further, there are no citations to the discovery record and no explanation of the theories that lead plaintiff to his 
conclusion. Such unsupported and conclusory statements are insufficient to withstand a motion for summary judgment. See 
Rule 56(e), Fed. R. Civ. P. [**7]"
891,10," Obviously, a judicial consent decree is not an ""antitrust law."""
891,11," Plaintiff attempts to distinguish Paul M. Harrod by suggesting that it turns on the fact that references to the consent decree 
would prejudice the jury and that references to it were readily excisable. The explanation is patently false. The court in that case 
flatly decided that to ""permit a private party to recover damages for violation of any provision of [a government antitrust decree] 
is so obviously beyond the scope of the term 'antitrust laws,' as used in the statute, as to require no further discussion."" 194 F. 
Supp. at 504. And the court went on to say that in view of its dismissal of the counts in the complaint referring to the antitrust 
decree that these counts would be ordered stricken. "
892,12," Plaintiff misconstrues Thomason and Haigh by claiming that they distinguish Ostrofe on the facts without rejecting its holdings 
(Opposition at 23 n. 16). See Thomason, 701 F. Supp. at 1570 (""if Thomason is correct in his allegations [that defendant fired 
him for refusal to engage in illegal conduct] he has suffered injury; but that harm cannot be redressed under the Sherman and 
Clayton Acts""); Haigh, 676 F. Supp. at 1346 (""again, this Court must reject the Ostrofe analysis"")."
892,13," In Ostrofe, the plaintiff was an essential participant in a scheme to fix prices and allocate customers; in Donahue, the plaintiff 
was likewise the means by which the defendant had imposed the illegal resale price maintenance scheme."
892,14," The loss of employment by plaintiffs in Adams satisfied this standard because it was directly caused by the predatory 
destruction of their employer by competitors. 828 F.2d at 17."
892,15," It appears to be plaintiff's theory that his termination was carried out in connection with the cessation of a business that was 
violating the AT & T decree. Even if true, that is not an ""antitrust injury."""
892,16, See 552 F. Supp. at 143.
892,17," There is not the slightest support for plaintiff's flat statement that the ""intent of the AT & T consent decree specifically to benefit 
management employees is beyond cavil"" (Opposition at 24). - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -End  [**13]  Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - "
893,18," In view of the lengthy discussion supporting the Control Data court's conclusion that antitrust consent decrees may not be 
enforced by third parties, it is difficult to ascribe Rafferty's assertion that the court declined to ""express an opinion"" on that issue 
(Opposition at 24) entirely to inexperience."
893,19," Jewett Deposition at 186, 191, 202."
893,20," Defendants' argument that because Jewett denied plaintiff's claim to a two-year contract, the Wemhoff rule does not apply 
(Reply at 15-16) is contradicted both by the Wemhoff decisions themselves and by Hackney which expressly states that the 
Statute of Frauds is waived if the defendant as much as admits to the existence of the contract. Id. at 1067."
893,21," Whether Jewett had the intent to commit a fraud when he apparently made the promise is a matter which, of course, must be 
left for trial. "
894,22," The complaint alleges that defendants' commitment was given ""in consideration for [his] continued efforts to develop Telco 
consulting"" (Complaint, para. 37). However, plaintiff was already obligated to advance that objective."
894,23," [**19]  Rafferty relies on Barger v. General Electric Co., 599 F. Supp. 1154, 1161 (W.D.Va. 1984), for the proposition that his 
continued service constituted consideration. However, not only did Barger involve special facts (the existence and distribution of 
a handbook to govern layoffs) but it applied only Virginia law, recognizing that on the broad issue the jurisdictions are severely 
split."
894,24," In his deposition testimony, plaintiff stated that he ""had a commitment of employment for the indefinite future."" Rafferty 
Deposition at 857."
894,25," There is considerable dispute between the parties about exactly what was said to whom. It appears, however, that ambiguous 
statements were made that could have left Rafferty with the impression upon which he now relies."
894,26," Both in Tennessee and in the District of Columbia, HN8[
] while a plaintiff need not, at this stage, show the amount of the 
damages, he is obligated to show that they exist and are not entirely speculative. See, e.g., Haynes v. Cumberland Builders, 
Inc., 546 S.W.2d 228, 233 (Tenn. App. 1977); Naartex Consulting Corp. v. Watt, 232 U.S. App. D.C. 293, 722 F.2d 779, 793 n. 
22 (D.C.Cir. 1983); W. Prosser & W. P. Keaton, Torts § 110 (5th ed. 1984). "
895,27, It is therefore not necessary to explore defendants' several other defenses to this claim.
895,28," NYNEX, on the other hand, has been indicted for alleged violations of the decree. See United States v. NYNEX Corporation, 
Criminal No. 90-0238 (D.D.C. 1990)."
895,29," Rafferty testified that several of Telco's customers have either recommended him for other positions or are willing to do so, 
Deposition at 1047, 1103-04, and that he was able to secure a comparable consulting position at the Diebold Group. Id. at 1501."
895,30," In addition to arguing that no cause of action for wrongful discharge is recognized in either Tennessee or the District of 
Columbia, defendants maintain that this claim should be dismissed because plaintiff was fired for business reasons and not as a 
consequence of his actions under the decree. But that is an issue of fact not amenable to resolution on the instant motion."
895,31," Both parties have taken positions on the law applicable to this claim that are at odds with those they have taken elsewhere in 
these filings. Plaintiff argues elsewhere that District of Columbia law governs this case, Opposition at 29 n. 24; but with respect 
to this count he suggests variously that New York, District of Columbia, and Tennessee law are applicable. Opposition at 36 n. 
29. Defendants, meanwhile, have asserted elsewhere that the case is governed by Tennessee law, Motion at 52, while relying 
here principally upon District of Columbia law."
895,32," Plaintiff distorts the Hall decision, claiming that it deals only with the political rights of public employees (Opposition at 35) 
when that was but one of the questions considered by the court. His further attempt to denigrate the Court of Appeals opinion by 
characterizing it as dictum and as relying on a D.C. Court of Appeals en banc decision without precedential value must likewise 
fail, for this Court is certainly bound by plain language of the U.S. Court of Appeals. "
896,33," In the original complaint, the demand was for $ 1 million; that demand has now been increased, without explanation, to $ 2 
million."

938,6," Appendix A to this opinion represents a summation of the Larner Report comparing prices paid by Feeser and Weis Markets, 
Tartan Foods and Sky Brothers for several Serv-A-Portion portion-controlled products. "
939,7," On appeal Weis Markets submitted a brief detailing generally its position that its decisions concerning Serv-A-Portion 
purchases were unilateral and not dictated by another competitor's activities. It averred that there is no evidence that it knowingly 
induced or received lower prices in violation of section 2(f) of the Robinson-Patman Act. In this same vein, as to the Sherman Act allegation, Weis Markets disputes that there is any evidence of conspiracy between 
Serv-A-Portion and Weis which would support such a violation. Feeser does not specifically respond to any of Weis Markets' evidentiary contentions, but counters that Weis lacks standing to 
argue any point on appeal since it did not raise such issues before the district court. Because our decision vacating the grant of 
summary judgment in favor of Serv-A-Portion necessarily involves the disposition previously rendered in regard to Weis Markets, 
we need not address the argument premised on Weis' lack of standing to proceed. "
941,8," The only evidence in the record of the amount of the difference is Dr. Larner's report, expressed in percentages. Although it 
does not challenge the figures, Serv-A-Portion does contend that the dollar amounts which these percentages represent are 
very slight. "
942,9," Although earlier decisional history of the degree of certainty needed to demonstrate actionable Robinson-Patman injury runs 
the semantical gambit from ""reasonable possibility,"" see Corn Products Refining, 324 U.S. at 742, to ""reasonable probability,"" 
see Foremost Dairies, Inc. v. F.T.C., 348 F.2d 674, 680 n. 11 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 959, 15 L. Ed. 2d 362, 86 S. Ct. 
435 (1965), the 1983 Supreme Court decision in Falls City confirms that a reasonable possibility that the price differential may 
harm competition is the appropriate standard.  460 U.S. at 434-35. To assist in determining the meaning of reasonable possibility, one commentator suggests that ""while certainty is not to be 
required, neither can plaintiff prove its case by mere hypothesis of competitive injury."" E. Kintner, § 22.5. "
943,10," Unfortunately the precise issue of the intended scope of the Act in regard to the targeted effect on competition was not before 
the Supreme Court on certiorari. The Court, however, did reference its prior reasoning in Falls City, 460 U.S. at 436, that ""the 
competitive injury component of a Robinson-Patman violation is not limited to the injury to competition between the favored and 
disfavored purchaser; it also encompasses the injury to competition between their customers."" Texaco v. Hasbrouck, 58 
U.S.L.W. at 4814 (quoting Falls City, 460 U.S. at 436). Thus by inference, a showing of price discrimination between competing 
purchasers can suffice to satisfy the required element of injury to competition within the meaning of the Act. "
944,11," Although the district court disallowed a considerable part of this testimony as hearsay, it acknowledged that some of the 
excluded depositions would be admissible under Fed. R. Evid. 803(3) if the customer's motive for not purchasing from Feeser 
was relevant to this action. Finding that motive was not germane, the district court disallowed the bulk of the depositions. The 
district court erred in this regard because the reason why a customer was not doing business with a particular seller is relevant 
in a lost profits/sales inquiry and its causal connection to the pricing practices of the alleged violator. If Feeser was losing sales 
or was being forced to cut its selling prices and thereby reducing its profits to meet Weis' price, this is directly related to actual 
injury. See Herman Schwabe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 297 F.2d 906, 914 (2d Cir. 1962) (""statements of a customer 
as to his reasons for not dealing with a supplier are admissible for this limited purpose,"" i.e., the purpose of proving customer 
motive, but not as evidence of the facts recited as furnishing the motives); see also Hydrolevel Corp. v. Am. Soc. of Mech. 
Engineers, 635 F.2d 118, 128 (2d Cir. 1980) (following Schwabe); 4 J. Weinstein & M. Berger, Weinstein's Evidence para. 
803[03], at 803-112 (1988). There is contrary authority. In Reserve Supply Corp. v. Owens Corning Fiberglas, 639 F. Supp. 1457 (N.D. Ill. 1986), it was held 
that deposition testimony relating conversations in which former customers told an official of the plaintiff's company that they had 
been purchasing [a product] from lower priced distributors was inadmissible hearsay. The district court cited no authority nor 
offered any rationale for its decision and, thus, we do not consider it persuasive. "
945,12," Again, inadmissible hearsay was the reason advanced by the district court for refusing consideration of Feeser's sales force 
affidavits. The basis for exclusion echoed its reasoning concerning the depositions, i.e., that the reasons enunciated by the sales 
people for lost sales had to do with the customers' motive in not purchasing Serv-A-Portion goods from them and were therefore 
not relevant. We have already expressed our opinion that the customers' motive was indeed relevant."
945,13," The cases cited by the district court to lend credence to its theory that de minimis violations are not actionable are either 
factually or legally distinguishable. See Rudner v. Abbott Laboratories, 664 F. Supp. 1100 (N.D. Ohio 1987) (although court recognized that there must be more 
than de minimis violations in both sales and volumes, record was insufficient to analyze factual question in summary judgment 
motion); Hanson v. Pittsburgh Plate Glass Industries, Inc., 482 F.2d 220, 224 (5th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1136, 38 L. 
Ed. 2d 761, 94 S. Ct. 880 (1974) (de minimis sales occurred, when as courtesy one distributor extended to another item not in "
946,," stock); Lupia v. Stella D'Oro Biscuit Co., Inc., 586 F.2d 1163 (7th Cir. 1978) (question existed whether defendant possessed 
valid exclusive right to compete in certain geographic area; also, plaintiff unable to identify extent of possible customer dealings 
or estimate sales actually lost); Whitaker Cable Corp. v. FTC, 239 F.2d 253 (7th Cir. 1956), cert. denied, 353 U.S. 938, 1 L. Ed. 
2d 761, 77 S. Ct. 813 (1957) (manufacturer selling to 8 1/2% of participants in market and who charged different prices to its 
customers without justification for differential was engaging in activity violative of the Act); Uniroyal, Inc. v. Hoff and Thames, 
Inc., 511 F. Supp. 1060 (S.D. Miss. 1981) (sales, with $ 200 combined value, to three customers were de minimis); Dairy King, 
Inc. v. Kraft, Inc., 645 F. Supp. 126 (D.Md. 1986) (lower prices offered to certain purchasers were in form of discounts offered to 
first time customers)."
946,14," In most respects, the district court dismissed the opinion of the expert. Although it did not exclude Dr. Larner's report 
specifically, it rejected each and every one of its contentions outright. The district court erred first, as it did not make the requisite 
finding as to whether or not this is the sort of data relied upon experts and Dr. Larner's field in conducting pricing analyses, see 
Indian Coffee Corp. v. Proctor & Gamble Co., 752 F.2d 891 (3d Cir. 1985), and second, because the uncontested figures 
actually do indicate substantial price discrimination over time. It is clear enough from recent cases that at the summary judgment "
947,," stage the judge's function is not himself to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether 
there is a genuine issue for trial.  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202, 106 S. Ct. 2505 (1986)."
947,15," Feeser's economist, Dr. Larner, also prepared an analysis comparing the average price paid by Weis and Feeser for six key 
Serv-A-Portion products for a six-month time period in 1984. The products used were identified by Weis as being particularly 
important in the portion control market, and the time period selected was, according to Larner, a conservative one during which 
he believed that the extent of the price discrimination against Feeser, and in favor of Weis, was not as great as in other relevant 
time periods. His analysis revealed that Weis received lower prices than Feeser on five of these six key products, and that Weis' 
resale prices were lower on each of the five products than were Feeser's even though Weis had a higher margin than Feeser on 
four of the products. Thus, Larner's analysis is capable of supporting the inference that, for this six-month period, Weis was 
passing on some of the savings it received from Serv-A-Portion, savings that allowed it to charge a lower resale price than 
Feeser while retaining a higher profit margin. As such, this analysis, especially when coupled with evidence that Weis' cost was 
the basis for its selling price to customers, is highly probative of competitive injury, see Morton Salt, 334 U.S. 37, 47, 92 L. Ed. 
1196, 68 S. Ct. 822 (1948) (a showing that price discrimination was sufficient in amount to influence resale prices was ""in itself . . 
. adequate to show competitive injury""); and bolsters the evidentiary force of the testimony of Feeser's sales people, and 
Larner's own less detailed pricing analysis for years 1982-1985. "
948,16," To estimate its lost sales at trial, Hasbrouck's expert presented a market analysis comparing Hasbrouck's actual prices, 
volumes and profits to its estimated amount absent the discrimination. The expert utilized economic projections based upon 
various assumptions such as assuming Texaco did not offer a favored price to its competitors and assuming that Texaco 
lowered its price to Hasbrouck. On appeal, the Supreme Court decided that: even if some portion of some of the respondent's injuries may be attributable 
to the conduct of independent retailers, the expert testimony nevertheless provided a sufficient basis for an acceptable 
estimate of the amount of damages.  Hasbrouck, 58 U.S.L.W. at 4814. "
949,17," The goals of the Sherman Act and the Robinson-Patman Act also do not mirror one another. In Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea 
Co. v. FTC, 440 U.S. 69, 82, 83, 59 L. Ed. 2d 153, 99 S. Ct. 925 n. 16 (1979), the Supreme Court noted that price discrimination 
with advantageous results for buyers versus a competitive edge for sellers encourages the aims of the Sherman Act, and in that 
respect, can be viewed as inconsistent with the Robinson-Patman Act. "
950,18," The dissent notes that the dismissal of Feeser's Sherman Act claim could be affirmed because Feeser's Rule 56(f) affidavit did 
not adequately outline the additional evidence necessary to demonstrate the presence of the conspiracy. Diss. Op. at 1546 n. 2. 
Although the dissent correctly states the law of specificity concerning Rule 56(f) affidavits, it is not applicable here. At Serv-A-
Portion's request, the district court limited discovery to the elements of competitive injury. Serv-A-Portion's summary judgment 
motion was directed only to the issue of damage to competition. It would be unfair to impose upon Feeser an obligation to 
specify the type of evidence it needed to uncover to substantiate the conspiracy element of its Sherman Act claim when it was 
without notice that the district court intended to consider and resolve the entire Sherman Act claim. "
951,19," Serv-A-Portion moved to strike the Tighe affidavit. In its order granting summary judgment, the district court dismissed, save 
one, all of Serv-A-Portion's motions to strike as moot. In light of our decision that there exists material issues of fact, the findings 
of mootness concerning the evidentiary questions, newly viable, are necessarily dissolved. "
953,1," I cannot agree with the court's suggestion that there are ""de minimis violations"" of the Robinson-Patman Act that do not count 
as such. I acknowledge that circumstances may exist where price differentials are so de minimis that they could not create a 
reasonable possibility that competition between the favored and disfavored purchasers would be harmed. Where, however, ""'the 
record indicates a price differential substantial enough to cut into the purchaser's profit margin . . . [or one] that, if reflected in a 
resale price cut, would have a noticeable effect on the decisions of customers in the retail market, an inference of injury may be 
properly indulged.'"" Boise Cascade Corp. v. FTC, 267 U.S. App. D.C. 124, 837 F.2d 1127, 1153 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (Mikva, J. 
dissenting) (quoting Foremost Dairies, Inc. v. FTC, 348 F.2d 674, 680 (5th Cir. 1965))."
953,2," As was the district court, I am willing to assume, for purposes of analyzing whether Feeser has produced sufficient evidence of 
adverse competitive impact under § 1 of the Sherman Act, that the agreement alleged in Feeser's complaint existed, i.e., a 
conspiracy between Serv-A-Portion and Weis whereby Weis would receive more favorable prices than Feeser. However, if an 
independent ground for affirmance were not available, affirmance might well be appropriately based on the lack of record 
evidence of a conspiracy, given that discovery in this case went on for over a year prior to the order limiting discovery to issues 
of competitive injury, and Feeser's Rule 56(f) affidavit did not indicate what additional discovery it needed to uncover evidence of 
an illegal agreement. See Dowling v. City of Philadelphia, 855 F.2d 136 (3d Cir. 1988) (""This court has interpreted Rule 56(f) as 
imposing a requirement that a party seeking further discovery in response to a summary judgment motion submit an affidavit 
specifying, for example, what particular information is sought; how, if uncovered, it would preclude summary judgment; and why 
it has not previously been obtained.""); see also, Hancock Industries v. Schaeffer, 811 F.2d 225, 230 (3d Cir. 1987); Koplove v. 
Ford Motor Co., 795 F.2d 15, 18 (3d Cir. 1986); Mid-South Grizzlies v. National Football League, 720 F.2d 772, 781 (3d Cir. 
1983), cert. denied, 467 U.S. 1215, 104 S. Ct. 2657, 81 L. Ed. 2d 364 (1984). Feeser was thus well apprised of the need to 
produce adequate evidence on this element of its claim, and filed a, albeit inadequate, Rule 56(f) affidavit to respond to this 
portion of Serv-A-Portion's motion. "
954,3," The record is unclear as to the precise geographic area allegedly affected by the unlawful agreement alleged by Feeser. Nor is 
it apparent whether Feeser contends that the product market is all portion control products or whether it contends that Serv-A-
Portion portion control products can in themselves constitute a product market for § 1 purposes.  Columbia Metal Culvert Co. v. 
Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corp., 579 F.2d 20, 27 (3d Cir. 1978), (quoting Brown Shoe Co., Inc. v. United States, 370 U.S. 
294, 325, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510, 82 S. Ct. 1502 (1962)) (""The outerbounds of a product market are determined by the reasonable 
interchangeability of use or the cross-elasticity of demand between the product itself and substitutes for it.""). Feeser does 
advance the proposition that Serv-A-Portion products occupy a unique niche in the portion control market because of their 
combination of moderate price and good quality. This proposition suggests that if Serv-A-Portion's distributors fail to maintain 
their prices at a reasonable level, end users will either switch to higher quality products (made price competitive because of 
Serv-A-Portion's increased prices) or considerably cheaper products (the rise in Serv-A-Portion's prices not being justified by the 
quality difference between its products and cheaper ones)."
954,4," With respect to intent, Feeser's amended complaint alleges only an agreement to engage in price discrimination, and does not 
allege that this agreement was designed to drive it from the portion control product market altogether. Compare Coleman Motor 
Co. v. Chrysler Corp., 525 F.2d 1338, 1347 (3d Cir. 1975) (""A combination of distributors, which through unfair practices 
eliminates a competitor and leaves it in such a condition that it lacks the ability to continue business as an interbrand competitor, 
has an adverse effect on competition.""). "
955,," In its briefs to the district court and this court, Feeser has, at best, vaguely alleged that Serv-A-Portion intended to hamper 
Feeser's ability to compete with Weis in sales of Serv-A-Portion's portion control products. No record evidence supports this 
assertion, however. Further, the proposition that Serv-A-Portion would intend to do this seems facially implausible. As Judge 
Breyer has explained, a ""supplier himself typically has an economic interest in encouraging competition among his dealers, and 
thus preventing the emergence of any 'dealer monopoly.' Other things being equal, a profit-maximizing dealer monopolist would 
set retail prices that, from the supplier's perspective, are too high and unduly restrict the product's sales."" Monahan's Marine, 
Inc. v. Boston Whaler, Inc., 866 F.2d 525, 526 (1st Cir. 1989); see also Continental T.V. Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 
56, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568, 97 S. Ct. 2549 & n. 24 (1977) (indicating that economists believe that once a manufacturer sets its own 
price, the manufacturer desires intrabrand competition among its distributors since this leads to lower retail prices and increased 
sales). Most important, as I discuss infra, even if Serv-A-Portion intended to give Weis an unfair advantage over Feeser, this 
would not violate § 1 unless it was part of a plan to cause some adverse effect on competition in a relevant market. The 
Sherman Act is not designed as a general prohibition on unfair business practices, it is designed to protect consumers and 
absent some purpose to harm them or some adverse effect upon their interests, the Act is not concerned with harm to a 
particular competitor."
955,5," See also Continental T.V. Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. at 52 n. 19 (""Interbrand competition is the competition among the 
manufacturers of the same generic product . . . and is the primary concern of antitrust law. . . . The degree of intrabrand 
competition is wholly independent of the level of intrabrand competition confronting the manufacturer. Thus, there may be fierce 
intrabrand competition among the distributors of a product produced by a monopolist and no intrabrand competition among the 
distributors of a product produced by a firm in a highly competitive industry. But when interbrand competition exists . . . it 
provides a significant check on the exploitation of intrabrand market power because of the ability of consumers to substitute a 
different brand of the same product.""). "

959,2," The defendants have categorized the various counts in plaintiffs' complaint as setting forth only two federal claims, a Sherman 
Act claim in Count I and an FAA claim in Count VI, the rest being pendent state claims. Although plaintiffs' complaint could be 
more clearly drawn, a broad reading suggests that all of the counts are interrelated and form part of their antitrust and FAA 
claims. Each count clearly realleges each allegation previously made in the preceding counts. Moreover, at the very least, 
counts II, III, and IV elaborate and form part of the antitrust claim and Count V appears related to plaintiffs' FAA claim. To the 
extent that distinct state law claims are also presented (e.g., defendants characterize Count V as a breach of contract claim), 
defendants' motion to dismiss these must fail because of the court's decision as to the antitrust claim. "
961,3," ""Contemplated"" is not a precise word, but the Supreme Court was not explicit in defining the criteria to be employed in 
determining whether the challenged municipal activity came within the intent of the state legislature. Although specific 
articulation of legislative intent was not required to come within the Parker doctrine, the court was not particularly expansive in its 
discussion of the level or type of legislative intent which would be required. For the instruction of the Fifth Circuit in Lafayette, 
see 532 F.2d 431, 434-35."
961,4," In Goldfarb, supra, the Supreme Court held that ""the threshold inquiry in determining if an anti-competitive activity is state 
action of the type the Sherman Act was not meant to proscribe is whether the activity is required by the State acting as 
sovereign."" 421 U.S., at 790 (emphasis supplied). See also Star Lines, Ltd. v. Puerto Rico Maritime Shipping Authority, 451 
F.Supp. 157, 166 (S.D.N.Y. 1978). This so-called compulsion test may be more appropriate to defendants who are private 
parties rather than a municipality or state subdivision like the County, because there is usually some delegation of authority by 
the State to the municipality, however ambiguous. See, Note, Antitrust Law - Municipal Immunity - Application of the State 
Action Doctrine to Municipalities, 1979 Wis. L. Rev. 570, 590-92 (1979). It is apparent that the Supreme Court's approach and 
instruction in City of Lafayette, as set forth supra, is more appropriate in this case, given the status of the County. "
962,5," The court's most recent pronouncement in California Retail Liquor set forth two standards to be used in applying the Parker 
doctrine: First, the challenged restraint must be ""one clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy""; second, the policy 
must be ""actively supervised"" by the State itself. California Retail Liquor, 48 U.S.L.W., at 4240."
962,6," See City of Lafayette, supra, at 418,421-23 (Burger, C.J., concurring). Chief Justice Burger framed the issue as ""whether the 
Sherman Act reaches the proprietary enterprises of municipalities,"" id., at 422 (emphasis supplied), and would hold that it does. 
Focusing solely on the nature of the activity, that is, whether it is governmental or proprietary, has some limitations as a tool of 
analysis. However, Burger's opinion is not unpersuasive insofar as it insists that a State, or municipality, be treated as any other 
antitrust defendant if it is engaged in an activity of a proprietary or business type nature, rather than of a regulatory governmental 
nature. "
963,7," The very recent case of California Retail Liquor, supra, n.5, in no way changes my decision. If anything, it indicates a 
continuing trend of the Supreme Court to apply the Parker doctrine narrowly and, although no state subdivision was involved in 
that case, it reinforces my decision in this case that there should be no finding of antitrust immunity."
963,8," It is not entirely clear from plaintiffs' complaint whether plaintiffs seek only injunctive relief for the alleged violation of § 1349(a), 
or damages as well. A review of 49 U.S.C. § 1487, the section which authorizes the government and, in a very limited situation, 
a private party, to seek enforcement of the Federal Aviation Act, suggests that only injunctive relief would be obtainable by the 
plaintiffs, assuming arguendo that a private remedy exists for a violation of 49 U.S.C. § 1349(a). A court appears authorized 
under § 1487 to direct only injunctive relief, and there is no mention of damages at all. "
971,1," Upon agreement of counsel for all parties, these three cases were consolidated for purposes of oral argument and rendering of 
the Court's opinion."
971,2," DME consists of wheelchairs, hospital beds, walkers, crutches, and other equipment often used by persons convalescing at 
home after hospitalization."
971,3," The appellant also sued Health East, Inc., the manager of Giles Memorial, in Docket No. 89-2377. The contracts referred to 
were originally entered into with Primedica, Inc., which was the corporate predecessor to Medserv Corporation. For simplicity, 
this opinion refers to the company as it existed under both names as ""Medserv."""
971,4," Radford is a wholly owned subsidiary of Southwest Virginia Health Services Corporation. Southwest Virginia Health 
Enterprises, Inc., is also a wholly owned subsidiary of that holding company. Southwest Virginia Pharmacy & Medical Supply 
Company d/b/a Community Pharmacy & Medical Supply is a wholly owned subsidiary of Southwest Virginia Health Enterprises, "
972,," Inc. For simplicity, this opinion uses the term ""Southwest"" to refer to this entire family of companies, except for Radford 
Community Hospital, which is referred to as ""Radford."""
972,5," Most of the district court's opinion focused on the plaintiff's § 2 claims. The court reasoned that the plaintiff's claims under § 1 of 
the Sherman Act were also deficient because ""those things which are condemned by § 2 are in large measure merely the end 
products of conduct which violates § 1."" Joint Appendix at 21 (citing United States v. Griffith, 334 U.S. 100, 106, 92 L. Ed. 1236, 
68 S. Ct. 941 (1948))."
972,6," In the cases involving Twin County and Giles, the Court accepts as true the allegations of the plaintiff's proposed second 
amended complaints for purposes of this opinion. If those allegations state claims upon which relief could be granted, the 
amendment of the complaints would not have been ""futile"" and should have been allowed by the district court. See Foman v. 
Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 9 L. Ed. 2d 222, 83 S. Ct. 227 (1962); Island Creek Coal Co. v. Lake Shore, Inc., 832 F.2d 274, 279 
(4th Cir. 1987). As to the appellant's § 3 Clayton Act claims against Twin County and Giles, which were not included in its 
second amended complaints, the Court accepts the allegations of the plaintiff's first amended complaints as true. See infra note 
20 and accompanying text. "
973,7," In Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628, 104 S. Ct. 2731 (1984), the Supreme Court 
held that a parent corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary are legally incapable of conspiring in violation of § 1 of the 
Sherman Act. See infra discussion pp. slip op. at 12-16. Because joint ventures consist of multiple entities, they are legally 
capable of violating § 1. See NCAA v. Board of Regents of the Univ. of Okla., 468 U.S. 85, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70 
(1984). "
974,8," In reaching our decision on this and the other claims that we remand for further consideration, the Court expresses no opinion 
as to the ultimate merits of the plaintiff's case. As this Court has stated, a complaint should not be dismissed ""merely because 
the court doubts that the plaintiff will ultimately prevail; so long as a plaintiff colorably states facts which, if proven, would entitle 
him to relief, the motion to dismiss should not be granted."" Adams v. Bain, 697 F.2d 1213, 1216 (4th Cir. 1982)."
974,9," It is unclear from the complaint among whom AHCS alleges the conspiracy. For purposes of this appeal, we assume that it 
alleges all of the possible permutations of alliances among the defendant entities named in the complaint."
974,10," Section 2 of the Sherman Act provides in part: HN5[
] ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or 
combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several 
States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony."" 15 U.S.C. § 2."
974,11," AHCS makes clear that it is the subsequent conduct of the affiliated corporations, not the act of affiliation itself, that it deems 
illegal. It has elected not to allege a claim under § 7 of the Clayton Act. Thus, the Court need not address whether Southwest's 
acquisition of the local drug store was an illegal combination under § 1. AHCS has not alleged that an original anticompetitive 
purpose is evident from the affiliated corporations' subsequent conduct. "
975,12," This conclusion has also received scholarly support. Professor Areeda posits that the total unity of the corporate enterprise is 
equally reflected in both the parent-subsidiary relationship and the relationship between sister corporations. In refusing to make 
corporate form determinative of liability, and in refusing to treat wholly owned corporations differently from unincorporated 
divisions, the Copperweld holding, he argues, also denies conspiratorial capacity to sister corporations' dealings with each other. 
VII P. Areeda, Antitrust Law § 1464f (1986)."
975,13," For similar reasons, we affirm the dismissal of AHCS's claim that Southwest conspired to monopolize the DME market in 
Radford, Virginia, in violation of § 2 of the Sherman Act. See infra discussion p. 150. "
976,14," HN9[
] A firm, even one with monopoly power, is not guilty of predatory exclusionary conduct when it is simply exploiting the 
competitive advantages legitimately available to it. See Berkey Photo v. Eastman Kodak, 603 F.2d 263, 276 (2d Cir. 1979), cert. 
denied, 444 U.S. 1093, 62 L. Ed. 2d 783, 100 S. Ct. 1061 (1980). "
977,15," It cannot be assumed on a 12(b)(6) motion that the hospitals have not lost profits in their inpatient services as a result of their 
exclusive DME agreements. It may be that the plaintiff will be able to show that they are currently losing money with the 
expectation of recouping those losses after driving the other DME suppliers out of the market. Further, the fact that the monopoly 
profits gained through the exclusive dealing arrangements may have already offset the lost profits in the hospital services market 
would not conclusively indicate a lack of antitrust violations. These are all factual issues that cannot be resolved at this point. Cf.  
Barry Wright Corp. v. ITT Grinnell Corp., 724 F.2d 227 (1st Cir. 1983) (outlining conditions necessary for successful predatory 
pricing)."
977,16," The appellees may be correct in their assertion that Aspen Skiing only establishes duties to engage in cooperative behavior in 
very limited circumstances. See Alpert's Newspaper Delivery Inc. v. The New York Times Co., 876 F.2d 266, 272 (2d Cir. 1989). 
Even if Aspen Skiing is so limited, it cannot be determined from the allegations of the plaintiff's complaints that such 
circumstances were not present in these cases. "
978,17," Because we address this case at an undeveloped stage, and because we find that the appellant has stated other related § 2 
claims that require a remand of this case for further proceedings, we assume that monopoly leveraging is an independent § 2 
violation separate from monopolization and attempted monopolization. We reserve definitive resolution of that issue for a case in 
which the issue is squarely presented. See Catlin, 791 F.2d at 1346; Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women v. 
NCAA, 236 U.S. App. D.C. 311, 735 F.2d 577, 586 n. 14 (D.C. Cir. 1984). "
979,18, See supra discussion pp. slip op. at 12-16.
979,19," Because AHCS did not include an essential facilities claim in its complaint filed in the Radford case, this section of this opinion 
refers to the Twin County and Giles cases only. "
980,20," AHCS did not include a § 3 Clayton Act claim in the amended complaints it proposed to file against Twin County and Giles. 
Nevertheless, the Court considers these claims in its review of the district court's dismissal of and refusal to reconsider dismissal 
of the first amended complaints in the Twin County and Giles cases. See supra note 6."
980,21," Although separate cases, the language setting forth the Clayton Act § 3 claims is identical in all three complaints."
980,22," On the face of the complaints, there are no allegations that the discharged patients are the actual buyers of DME and that they 
entered into exclusive dealing agreements with Medserv and Southwest. Although plaintiff suggests that the alleged monopoly 
power of the hospitals influences patients' choice of DME, plaintiff specifically refrains from alleging that the defendants have tied 
access to medical services with DME selection. Accordingly, we do not address that possibility. "
981,23," In support of this contention, the plaintiff has cited several cases for the proposition that the appropriate hospital personnel can 
be the de facto economic decision-makers in the purchasing of medical services. See, e.g., Dos Santos v. Columbus-Cuneo-
Cabrini Medical Center, 684 F.2d 1346, 1354 (7th Cir. 1982); United States v. American Soc'y of Anesthesiologists, 473 F. Supp. 
147, 159-60 (S.D.N.Y. 1979). But see Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 27-28 & 30 n. 50, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2, 
104 S. Ct. 1551 (1984) (finding it likely that ""it is the patient's doctor and not the patient who selects an anesthesiologist,"" but that 
this sort of market imperfection was irrelevant); Key Enterprises of Del. v. Venice Hosp., 703 F. Supp. 1513 (M.D. Fla. 1989) 
(rejecting the substitution of hospital discharge personnel for the patient as the consumers of DME). In any event, all of these 
findings were in the context of defining the relevant market for health-care specialists in Sherman Act cases, and the appellant 
has not cited any cases that apply this logic to purchaser-identity in exclusive dealing cases."
981,24," This theory cannot be maintained in the Radford case because of the extensive corporate relationship in place. See 
discussion supra p. slip op. at 29. "
986,1," As always, we regard as true the complaint's factual allegations and we view them and the reasonable inferences implied by 
them in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, here, the Appellants. See SK Hand Tool Corp. v. Dresser Indus., Inc., 852 F.2d "
987,936," , 938 (7th Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 492 U.S. 918, 109 S. Ct. 3241, 106 L. Ed. 2d 589 (1989). See also Seglin v. Esau, 769 
F.2d 1274, 1283 (7th Cir. 1985) (HN3[
] a pleader is permitted ""to enjoy all favorable inferences from facts that have been 
pleaded,"" but he is not permitted to substitute ""conclusory statements . . . for minimally-sufficient factual allegations""). The 
complaint's factual allegations, however, are at times meaningless; they float from nowhere, seemingly unconnected with any 
worldly experience. Because of this, we have embellished this statement of facts with background material from sources outside 
of the complaint, in particular two cases: In re Kenneth C. Kern, 555 N.E.2d 479 (Ind. 1990), and Kaminsky v. Medical Licensing 
Bd., 511 N.E.2d 492 (Ind. Ct. App. 1987). We have used nothing from these sources to contradict the factual allegations in the 
Appellants' complaint or the reasonable inferences implied by those allegations. We have used the sources merely to give 
insight into what the Appellants are talking about. Cf.  Car Carriers, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 745 F.2d 1101, 1107 (7th Cir. 1984), 
cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1054, 84 L. Ed. 2d 821, 105 S. Ct. 1758 (1985)."
987,2, The Medical Board's decision later was upheld by the Indiana courts.
987,3," Instrumental in effecting this decision, which later was upheld by the Indiana courts, was IBCE member Kolanko."
987,4," Despite these setbacks, Kaminsky persevered. He obtained reinstatement of his license in 1987; this, despite the contrary 
efforts of IBCE member Simonson and others. "
988,5," ISP member White and deputy attorney general Minglin also worked on the Jennings case, although to what extent is 
unknown."
988,6," As part of the proceedings against Lisa, members of the Marion County Prosecutor's Office and the IAGO waged a 
disqualification campaign against Lisa's (and Kaminsky and Jennings's) counsel, Kenneth Kern. This campaign failed, but 
another was more successful. Two counts of alleged improper conduct were filed against Kern by Indiana Supreme Court 
Disciplinary Commission executive secretary Breskow. Minglin, Lane, Emry, Beyer, Meyers, White, Newman, and Pearson all 
gave deposition testimony for the disciplinary hearings, deposition testimony unfavorable to Kern. Kern was found guilty of Count 
II, alleging conflict of interest. He eventually was suspended from the practice of law for 60 days."
988,7," Other examples of irrelevant alleged federal law violations: 18 U.S.C. § 242 (deprivation of rights under color of law); 18 U.S.C. 
§ 2 (aiding and abetting the commission of some unknown crime); 18 U.S.C. § 1 (classification of crimes); 18 U.S.C. § 1001 
(lying to the FBI). Examples of alleged state law violations: I.C. 34-1-5-1 (rules for pleading for libel and slander); I.C. 34-1-14-5 
(incompetent witnesses); I.C. 35-43-4-4(h)(3) & (4) (authorizing return of property from law enforcement agency); I.C. 35-44-2-2 
(false informing); I.C. 35-44-3-4 (obstruction of justice); I.C. 35-44-1-2 (official misconduct); I.C. 35-41-5-1 (attempt to restrain 
trade): I.C. 35-41-5-2 (conspiracy to restrain trade); I.C. 34-41-2-4 (aiding and abetting); I.C. 35-43-1-2 (criminal mischief); I.C. 
35-45-2-2 (harassment); I.C. 24-1-2-5 (duties of attorney general and prosecuting attorney); I.C. 34-4-30.5-2 (action by 
prosecuting attorney to enjoin violation of law); I.C. 34-1-60-9 (deceit of attorney); I.C. 35-33-5-5 (disposition of seized items); 
I.C. 35-41-1-2 (repealed); etc."
988,8," For a definition of ""legend drug,"" see I.C. 16-6-8-2(k). "
989,9, We offer no opinion on whether a violation of I.C. 16-6-8-3(f)(1) constitutes a racketeering act.
989,10," The factual allegation portion of the complaint alleges the following: ""In July 1984, Defendant BUEHRLE after obtaining an 
illegal prescription of diabenzanine from a licensed pharmacist, went to the office of JENNINGS using an undercover name, 
Mike Peterson, and a fictitious employment."" We cannot find from this allegation ""facts from which the court may make . . . a 
determination"" that the Indiana statutes were violated. See Reynolds, supra, 882 F.2d 1251-52. This is especially so in light of 
the complaint's presentation of Buehrle as an investigating member of the ISP."
989,11," The ""pinpointed"" allegations include Martin's purported violation of I.C. 35-43-1-1 (arson), Alder's purported violation of I.C. 35-
43-4-2 (theft; receiving stolen property), and Simonson's purported violation of I.C. 35-44-1-1 (bribery). They also include a 
plethora of purported violations, by numerous Appellees, of 18 U.S.C. § 1951. The factual detail supporting these purported 
violations is absent, however; the complaint fails adequately to allege -- in facts -- that the above mentioned crimes were 
committed. The same goes for all of the Appellants' other allegations, including their numerous allegations of mail and wire 
fraud, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 & 1343. "
990,12," Assuming, arguendo, that some of the alleged statutory violations constitute racketeering acts, and waiving, for the moment, 
our plaint with the conclusory manner in which the allegations are made."
990,13," The Appellants mention, among other entities, (1) the conspiracy of the ""members of the Indiana State Medical Association,"" 
(2) the conspiracy of the American Medical Association, the Indiana State Medical Association, Minglin, White, and ""numerous 
other named and unnamed people,"" (3) ""various enterprises including [the] collective criminal enterprise,"" (4) ""an on-going 
criminal syndicate,"" and (5) ""the legitimate practice of chiropractic."""
990,14," Appellants' counsel's concession at oral argument that the complaint's purported enterprise is an association-in-fact of the 
Appellees bears this interpretation out: the government offices are not the purported enterprise, the Appellees are. As for this 
association-in-fact, again, there is nothing in the complaint to show that the Appellees constitute a separate and distinct 
enterprise: there is nothing indicating a command structure separate and distinct from the government offices; there is nothing 
indicating an enterprise existing apart from the Appellees' deeds. "
991,15," In addition to claiming under the federal RICO statute, the Appellants' complaint claims under various provisions of Indiana 
state law. Absent the jurisdiction provided by the federal RICO count, however, the Appellants' state law claims need not be 
addressed.  United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 86 S. Ct. 1130, 16 L. Ed. 2d 218 (1966). "
995,1, Holiday Steel was a defendant below but it is now bankrupt and is not a party to this appeal.
995,2," This genre of software is called CAD/CAM, which stands for ""computer assisted design and computer assisted manufacture."" "
996,3," The court found Lasercomb was damaged in the amount of $ 105,000 on the copyright infringement claim, and was damaged 
in the amount of $ 105,000 on the fraud claim. Because those two damages amounts arose from lost sales of the same three 
Interact copies, the court ruled Lasercomb could recover only once."
996,4," Additional actual and punitive damages were awarded against the corporation severally. Because damages for the breach of 
contract were awarded against the corporation only, issues relating to that cause of action are not raised in this appeal."
996,5," Appellants raise two other defenses to copyright infringement. They claim Lasercomb's recovery is barred by their failure to 
comply with statutory notice requirements in perfecting the copyright. Somewhat incongruously, appellants alternatively advance 
the defense of innocent infringement. Because of our disposition of the copyright misuse defense, we do not reach these other 
two defenses to infringement. "
997,6," Appellants also claim Lasercomb has created an illegal tie-in by discounting the price of Interact to licensees who purchase 
steel rule dies and other goods from Lasercomb. This simply is not a tie-in. No customer is required to buy steel rule dies in 
order to be able to purchase the Interact software, nor must any customer buy the Interact software in order to purchase steel 
rule dies, nor does Lasercomb require customers to agree to not purchase any other vendor's wares in order to be able to 
purchase Lasercomb's software and dies. See Northern Pac. Ry. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5-6, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545, 78 S. 
Ct. 514 & n. 4 (1958)."
997,7," The district court's finding of breach of contract (not before us on appeal) was based on a letter in which Holliday admitted an 
oral agreement between Holiday Steel and Lasercomb was binding."
997,8," At the time of trial, Lasercomb had sold approximately 40 licenses in Interact. Lasercomb's president testified that the terms of 
the licensing agreement, including the noncompete language, were negotiable. He stated the noncompete language had been 
negotiated out or modified in ""several"" instances, but could not specifically state the degree to which the language had been 
removed or altered."

999,13," [***1851]  The Court of Customs and Patent Appeals observed that the patent/copyright clause was unusual in stating the 
reason the power had been granted, and commented: Its inclusion doubtlessly was due to the fact that those who formulated the Constitution were familiar with the long struggle 
over monopolies so prominent in English history, where exclusive rights to engage even in ordinary business activities were 
granted so frequently by the Crown for the financial benefits accruing to the Crown only. It was desired that in this country 
any Government grant of a monopoly for even a limited time should be limited to those things which serve in the promotion 
of science and the useful arts.  In Re Shao Wen Yuan, 38 C.C.P.A. 967, 188 F.2d 377, 380 (C.C.P.A. 1951). See also Howell's Copyright Law, at 15."

1000,15," The primary effect of the Patent Misuse Reform Act is to eliminate the presumption that use of a patent license to create a tie-
in is per se misuse. See Calkins, Patent Law, at 196-97."
1000,16," In Paramount Pictures, the Court in an antitrust context stated: Block-booking [of feature films] prevents competitors from bidding for single features on their individual merits. The District 
Court held it illegal for that reason and for the reason that it ""adds to the monopoly of a single copyrighted picture that of 
another copyrighted picture which must be taken and exhibited in order to secure the first."" That enlargement of the 
monopoly of the copyright was condemned below in reliance on the principle which forbids the owner of a patent to 
condition its use on the purchase or use of patented or unpatented materials. The court enjoined defendants from "
1001,," performing or entering into any license in which the right to exhibit one feature is conditioned upon the licensee's taking one 
or more other features. We approve that restriction. "
1001,334," U.S. at 156-58 (citations and footnote omitted). Citing Paramount, the Fifth Circuit has opined in dicta that ""it is . . . likely that 
the public monopoly extension rationale of Morton Salt . . . is applicable to copyright."" Mitchell, 604 F.2d at 865 n. 27."
1001,17," In the context of copyright, this confusion probably arises at least in part from Broadcast Music, Inc. v. CBS, 441 U.S. 1, 60 L. 
Ed. 2d 1, 99 S. Ct. 1551 (1979). In that case, CBS brought an antitrust suit and also asked for a declaratory judgment that 
defendant's action constituted misuse of copyright. The Second Circuit first addressed whether there was an antitrust violation, 
and finding there was, ""the Court of Appeals held that the challenged conduct constituted misuse of copyrights solely on the 
basis of its finding of unlawful price fixing."" Id. at 6 n. 9. The Supreme Court reversed the finding of a Sherman Act violation -- on 
the basis that the court of appeals had used the wrong standard to evaluate the price fixing -- stating: ""We reverse that 
judgment, and the copyright misuse judgment dependent upon it. . . ."" Id. at 24. Standing alone, this latter sentence seems to 
imply that copyright misuse depends on a finding of an antitrust violation. In context, however, it is apparent that misuse was 
linked to antitrust in that case simply as a matter of litigation strategy. Copyright misuse was not asserted as a defense to an 
infringement suit, and the primary claim was an antitrust claim."

Constitution, reflects a balance of competing claims upon the public interest: Creative work is to be encouraged and 
rewarded, but private motivation must ultimately serve the cause of promoting broad public availability of literature, music,

1019,2," At oral argument the plaintiffs argued that the fact that the Zoning Board of Appeals considered the location of ""The Country 
Store"" to the school in question should be ignored altogether or at least discounted because the school itself dispensed gasoline 
to its buses. This argument is not compelling. The fact that the school dispenses gasoline for the use of its buses is 
distinguishable from the use that ""The Country Store"" had hoped to employ. The schools use was a very controlled and limited 
one, whereas ""The Country Store"" was quite the opposite, both uncontrolled and unlimited. Therefore, the Zoning Board of 
Appeals consideration of that fact in rendering its decision on the issue of whether to grant such establishment a use variance

allegations that various lending institutions had entered into an agreement to fix the interest rates charged by them. Id. at 681. 
Such an agreement is clearly a form of horizontal price fixing, a per se violation of Section 1. Since a per se restraint is 
conclusively presumed to have an anticompetitive effect, the plaintiff does not have to make detailed allegations concerning

fourth, anticompetitive effects in the tied market; and fifth, the involvement of a ""not insubstantial"" amount of interstate

five elements for an illegal tying arrangement on the ground that the Supreme Court in Jefferson focused only on ""the 
anticompetitive effect of tying arrangements and the resultant harm to consumer choice in the tied product market."" It would 
appear that the five elements for evaluating an alleged illegal tying arrangement were not intended by the court in Yentsch, upon 
which the Gonzalez court relied, to comprise an exhaustive list. The Yentsch court recognized ""considerable logic for using [the 
'direct economic benefit'] criterion"" even though it did not have occasion to adopt the requirement in that case.  630 F.2d at 57 n.

lenses with a solution comprised of a disinfecting amount of peroxide and an effective amount of peroxide-active proteolytic 
enzyme for a time sufficient to remove substantially all protein accretions and to disinfect the lenses. Claim 2. The method of claim 1 wherein the solution is prepared by combining the enzyme and peroxide at the time the lenses 
are contacted with the solution. Claim 3. The method of claim 2 wherein the enzyme is in a powder or tablet form and is dissolved in the peroxide solution. Claim 4. The method of claim 1 wherein the solution is prepared by dissolving a dry peroxide and dry enzyme in an aqueous 
solution. Claim 5. The method of claim 4 wherein both components are combined in powder or tablet form. Claim 6. The method of claim 2 wherein the enzyme is present in an amount between 0.001 and 5 Anson units, and the peroxide 
is hydrogen peroxide and is present in an amount between 0.02 and 10% by weight/volume. Claim 7. A method, according to claim 6, where the proteolytic enzyme is subtilisin. Claim 8. The method of claim 7 wherein the peroxide is hydrogen peroxide, sodium perborate, potassiumpersulfate, sodium 
percarbonate, diperisophthalic acid, peroxydiphosphate salts or sodium aluminum aminohydroperoxide. Claim 9. The method of claim 8 where the [aqueous composition] solution comprises 3% hydrogen peroxide and 0.30% subtilisin 
A by weight/volume. Claim 10. The method of claim 1 wherein said contact lenses have a hydrophilic surface. "

weight/volume. Claim 14. The method of claim 13 wherein said hydrogen peroxide is present in an amount of about 3% by weight/volume. Claim 15. The method of claim 10 wherein said peroxide-active proteolytic enzyme is subtilisin A and said peroxide is hydrogen 
peroxide."
1046,4," Alcon has a product -- Opti-Zyme -- which is similar to Allergan's Ultrazyme product. The Opti-Zyme tablet contains a 
proteolytic enzyme which is the active protein removing ingredient. The combination of Opti-Zyme with hydrogen peroxide would 
also facilitate a one-step solution for simultaneous cleaning and disinfecting contact lenses. Alcon has conceded that if FDA 
approval is received for promoting the use of Opti-Zyme with hydrogen peroxide, that such acts will constitute inducement of 
infringement of claims 1, 2, 3, 6, 10, 13, and 14 of the '672 patent."
1046,5," Approval from the Food and Drug Administration is required before a product can be commercialized. The FDA tests for safety

sodium carbonate, polyethylene glycol 3350, and tartaric acid. "
1048,7," Alcon also presented the affidavit of Bruce McCarty, the inventor of the BIZ '139 patent. Dr. McCarty concludes that Lo's 
experiment would meet all claims of the patent. However, his opinions are based on recollection, and he has performed no tests 
to verify such conclusions. The Court has considered Dr. McCarty's opinions and has concluded that they are not persuasive, 
and they have not been given significant weight."
1048,8," Rosenthal was unable to obtain the same solution as Lo. This indicates that, although the BIZ used by Rosenthal had the same 
McCarty patent number on the box, the formulation was not necessarily the same as the formulation of BIZ in 1969. "
1049,9," Alcon points out that Lo's 50% level of cleaning is comparable to the cleaning in Example 1 and better than the results of the 
second Example 7 of the patent in suit. The Court must define the scope of the patent from the claims; the examples are merely 
illustrative. Alcon would have the Court isolate the examples showing 30% and 50% cleaning and ignore the more numerous 
examples showing 60%-90% cleaning. Example 1 showed 50% to 70% cleaning; second Example 7 showed 30% cleaning and 
Example 2 showed 80%-90% cleaning."

1052,15," Alcon has also urged that Allergan must show a synergistic result from combining the two known ingredients, each to be used 
for their intended purpose. Allergan presented evidence -- much of it from Alcon's own experiments -- which showed findings of 
synergism. However, after review of all the evidence, the Court determines that such enhancement was not attributable to the 
combination of enzymes and hydrogen peroxide alone. Rather, enhanced disinfection is related to pH level. The Court has 
reviewed the briefs, evidence, and applicable law and determines that a showing of synergism is not required in this case. 
Allergan is not distinguishing the patent in suit from the prior art on the basis of unexpected synergism alone. Hence, a lack of 
synergy does not render the patent obvious. See, Merck & Co. v. Biocraft Laboratories, Inc., 874 F. 2d 804 (Fed. Cir.), cert.

unfair competition. All these claims stem from B & W's alleged infringement of Liggett's quality seal (""Q-seal"") closure by B & W's 
oval closure seal."
1069,4," The jury heard evidence and arguments for 115 days, and considered 2,884 exhibits, 85 deposition excerpts, and testimony 
from 23 live witnesses. The verdict was returned after nine days of deliberations. The court's instructions to the jury on the 
antitrust claim were generally consistent with the legal position and theory espoused by Liggett. Some of the same issues and 
contentions had been considered by the court at summary judgment and/or the directed verdict stage of the trial, and resolved in 
Liggett's favor. In a complex case such as this, however, development of a complete record is sometimes necessary in order for 
the court to have a thorough understanding of the issues and facts in controversy. An ever expanding court docket does not

(M.D.N.C. 1986), aff'd, 829 F.2d 36 (4th Cir. 1987). The court's JNOV rulings on competitive injury, causation, and antitrust 
injury are based upon interpretations of the applicable law. If these interpretations are found to be erroneous and an appellate 
court applies legal standards more favorable to Liggett, this court does not believe that an examination of the weight of the 
evidence, the credibility of witnesses, and any alleged errors in the admission or rejection of evidence or instructions to the jury 
would justify granting B & W a new trial. The only remaining significant issue concerns the sufficiency of Liggett's damage 
evidence. If antitrust injury is proven, courts are lenient in assessing the proof required to support a damage award. See Bigelow

extensive evidence from the testimony of two experts and other witnesses. The court believes there was sufficient evidence to 
support the jury's damage award. "
1070,7," The six major cigarette manufacturers are Philip Morris, Inc., R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Corp., B & W, Lorillard, Inc., American 
Tobacco Co., and Liggett. A few other domestic and foreign firms have sold cigarettes in the United States during the 1980's, but 
none has attained any significance in the marketplace."
1070,8," The term ""branded cigarettes"" describes full-price cigarettes targeted to the image-conscious cigarette consumer. Branded 
cigarettes are advertised heavily and packaged in containers with distinctive designs. Well-known branded cigarettes include 
Newport, Pall Mall, Kool, Winston, and, of course, Marlboro -- America's most popular branded cigarette by a wide margin."
1070,9," The term ""generic cigarettes"" refers to a catch-all category of cigarettes priced significantly lower than branded cigarettes. 
Within this category, sometimes called the price-value category, there are different types of generic cigarettes. This dispute 
centers around one such type -- black and white cigarettes. Black and white cigarettes are sold in plain-looking white packages 
with black lettering indicating the nature of the product contained within (e.g., ""Filter Cigarettes""). These packages look like other 
generic products on the grocery shelf so that consumers can quickly identify them as lower-priced cigarettes. Another category 
of generic cigarettes is ""branded generics."" Branded generics are cigarettes in branded packaging but priced in the black and 
white cigarette range."
1070,10," Liggett was not the first cigarette company to sell generic cigarettes. Both U.S. Tobacco Co. and G. A. George Georgopulo & 
Co., smaller cigarette manufacturers with no significant market share, sold generic cigarettes prior to Liggett. However, once 
Liggett entered the generic category it became the dominant player and was responsible for the segment's initial growth."
1070,11," ""Twenty-five's"" (""25's"") are cigarettes priced and packaged like branded cigarettes but with twenty-five cigarettes contained in 
each package instead of the standard twenty. RJR introduced Century and B & W introduced Richland as entries in the ""25's"" 
category."
1070,12," RJR repositioned Doral, a brand which had previously been unsuccessful competing with other branded cigarettes, by 
lowering the price to generic levels. Since May 1984, Doral's market share has grown considerably. "
1071,13," B & W's published volume rebates from mid-1984 to the end of 1985 ranged from sixty to eighty cents per carton depending 
on the number of cartons a customer bought from the company. B & W's rebate schedule on a per carton basis was as follows: 
60 cent rebate for customers who bought 0-499 cases per quarter; 65 cent rebate for customers who bought 500-999 cases per 
quarter; 70 cent rebate for customers who bought 1,000-1,499 cases per quarter; 75 cent rebate for customers who bought 
1,500-7,999 cases per quarter; and 80 cent rebate for customers who bought 8,000 or more cases per quarter."
1071,14, Lorillard is the only major cigarette manufacturer without a significant presence in the generic cigarette segment.
1071,15," Coupons are a form of price competition in which money-off vouchers on cigarette cartons and packs are distributed to 
consumers through newspapers and other mediums. Stickering is a form of price competition in which money-off stickers are 
attached to cigarette cartons, and sometimes even individual packs. Although the list price of couponed and stickered cigarettes 
does not change, the amount of money the consumer has to pay at the cash register is lessened by the value of the coupon or 
sticker."
1071,16," In Robinson-Patman Act cases, courts distinguish the probable impact of the price discrimination upon competitors of the 
seller (primary-line injury), the favored and disfavored buyers (secondary-line injury), or the customers of either of them (tertiary-
line injury). See 3 E. Kintner & J. Bauer, Federal Antitrust Law § 20.9, at 127 (1983)."
1071,17," Non-geographic means that the United States is the relevant market as opposed to any particular city, state, or region."
1071,18," The parties do not dispute that at least one of the sales of B & W black and white cigarettes was made across a state line; that 
each pertinent sale of B & W black and white cigarettes was for use and resale in the United States; that the black and white 
cigarettes sold by B & W were physical items; that the black and white cigarette sales being compared were made by B & W at 
about the same time; and that the B & W black and white cigarettes involved in the sales being compared were of like grade and 
quality."

doing so. If the price does not violate the relevant predatory pricing standard, it cannot tend to lessen competition or to have 
the dangerous probability of doing so. P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law 720, at 618 (Supp. 1989). "

1074,26," Oligopoly is the economic term for a market in which few producers are present. There is nothing illegal per se about an 
oligopoly."
1074,27," Elasticity means the responsiveness of a dependent variable to changes in a causal factor. Burnett looked at what happened 
to consumer demand in the cigarette industry when prices rose. He concluded that demand for cigarettes was inelastic because 
consumer demand did not decrease very much despite steadily rising prices."
1074,28," Burnett does not contend that the major cigarette manufacturers overtly engaged in price-fixing in a smoke-filled room. 
Instead, he believes the major manufacturers silently agreed that price uniformity was in their best interests and, therefore, 
priced in lock-step fashion."
1074,29," Average variable cost equals the sum of all the variable costs divided by output. For a manufacturing firm such as a cigarette 
company, costs are divided into two categories -- fixed and variable. Variable costs fluctuate with a firm's output while fixed costs 
are independent of output. Variable costs typically include items such as materials, fuel, labor, maintenance, licensing fees, and 
depreciation occasioned by use. Fixed costs generally include management expenses, overhead, interest on debt, and 
depreciation occasioned by obsolescence. A price below average variable cost causes a manufacturer to lose money on each 
unit of output of the product. "
1075,30," Burnett's only theory of recoupment was simultaneous recoupment. He did not contend that B & W's recoupment would come 
by raising the price of generic cigarettes."
1075,31," Issues of corporate ethics and morality, or the lack thereof, are not appropriate subjects for consideration by the court unless 
they are also violative of the antitrust, trademark, and unfair competition claims alleged."
1075,32," Many circuits have held that the competitive injury requirement of the Robinson-Patman Act cannot be satisfied unless the 
alleged predator has at least a reasonable prospect of obtaining market power. See Stitt Spark Plug Co. v. Champion Spark 
Plug Co., 840 F.2d 1253, 1255-56 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 890, 109 S. Ct. 224, 102 L. Ed. 2d 214 (1988); Henry, 809

to apply the market power concept to the Robinson-Patman Act, but this hesitance has always been in the context of geographic 
price discrimination claims factually distinct from the non-geographic claim alleged here. See A.A. Poultry Farms, 881 F.2d at

recoupment stage that consumer welfare is injured. "

1078,36," Much of Liggett's market analysis focuses on the steady decline of the market share of black and white cigarettes. This decline 
has not injured consumers because of the steady growth of branded generic cigarettes sold at the same price as black and white 
cigarettes. Overall, the generic segment has grown with consumers preferring branded generic cigarettes to black and white 
cigarettes. The rest of Liggett's market analysis is equally unconvincing. Liggett contends that B & W caused the price differential 
between branded and generic cigarettes to decrease. Yet, the percentage price differential has remained about thirty per cent 
(30%), and B & W quickly retracted the only generic cigarette price increase that it initiated because the competition did not 
follow. Liggett also alleges that B & W's pricing forced it to reduce its advertising, thereby slowing the segment. Still, the generic 
cigarette category continued to grow, fueled in part by RJR's aggressive promotion of Doral. Finally, Liggett argues that the 
military market provides empirical evidence of actual injury to consumers. The generic segment now accounts for over thirty per 
cent (30%) of the military market, as compared to approximately fifteen per cent (15%) of the civilian market. However, the age, 
income, and image differences in the military and the civilian sectors make such inferences suspect; the market for generic 
cigarettes has grown in both sectors; and without any realistic prospect of obtaining market power B & W's conduct cannot be 
the cause of the different market shares in the two sectors."

1082,42," This court used average variable cost because Liggett's evidence of predatory pricing centered on this measure; average 
variable cost is a conservative measure unlikely to penalize the competitive pricing activities of a more efficient competitor; and 
many circuits use some variant of the average variable cost test to isolate predatory pricing."
1082,43," Since Liggett and B & W are full-line competitors who compete for market share across all cigarette product lines, this court 
instructed the jury that they could consider Liggett's below-cost pricing evidence only if they determined that generic cigarettes 
formed a well-defined submarket based on the practical indicia test of Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 325, 8 L. 
Ed. 2d 510, 82 S. Ct. 1502 (1962). The court used this concept to aid the jury in determining whether generic cigarettes were 
sufficiently distinct from branded cigarettes to justify applying the average variable cost test to generic cigarettes, and not as a 
means of deciding the appropriate market in which to evaluate competitive injury. If there are no significant economic differences 
between the two products there is no reason to analyze their price-cost relationship separately. "
1083,44," See Morgan v. Ponder, 892 F.2d 1355, 1361-62 (8th Cir. 1989) (court refuses to apply a price-cost test solely to legal

of the advertising used by the two parties; (6) the defendant's intent; (7) actual confusion."
1084,46," Liggett also contends that B & W improperly took advantage of the court's pre-trial rulings which prevented Liggett from calling 
consumers who had confused B & W's black and gold lion closure seal, a seal which was not the basis of Liggett's claim in this 
case, with the Liggett quality seal trademark. Liggett further contends that it was tricked or prevented from calling Saul Lefkowitz, 
a former chairman of the United States Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, who would have testified that registration of the "
1085,," quality seal was proper, a fact B & W conceded. Other proposed testimony by Mr. Lefkowitz sought to instruct the jury on the 
law, a matter within the province of the court. The court is satisfied that its initial position concerning these witnesses was 
correct. "
1102,1," BMI licenses the works in its repertoire to the three major television networks, cable program suppliers, and thousands of local 
television and radio stations. Other licensees include concert halls, nightclubs, bars and skating rinks. "
1103,2," ""Pay"" cable program services typically are offered by cable system operators to subscribers for a monthly premium over the 
basic monthly cable service fee. Lifetime's cable service is labelled ""basic"" because it is generally offered by cable operators to 
subscribers as part of a routine cable package."
1103,3," Virtually every domestic copyrighted composition is in the repertory of either ASCAP or BMI, but not both. Consequently, 
defendant asserts, ASCAP and BMI do not compete in the same marketplace. Lifetime must, as a practical matter, seek license 
relationships with both organizations. "
1104,4," In BMI, the Supreme Court held that the blanket license is not a per se section 1 violation."
1104,5," The Court does not dispute that Judge Winter, who concurred in Buffalo Broadcasting, maintains that absent evidence of 
agreement among composers or producers to refrain from licensing performing rights independently, ""a non-exclusive blanket 
license cannot restrain competition."" Id. at 934 (Winter, J., concurring). The majority decision of the panel, however, is not that 
broad. See BMI, Inc. v. The Christian Broadcasting Network, Inc., 89 Civ. 6246 (JES) (Transcript of May 11, 1990 Oral Argument 
on BMI's motion to dismiss identical antitrust counterclaims of another basic cable television program service, pp. 8-9). "

performance of the copyrighted compositions by defendant. See Boz Scaggs Music v. KND Corp., 491 F. Supp. 908, 912 (D. 
Conn. 1980). Defendant challenges only the fourth element. "
1109,8," For example, a plain reading of the present pleading reveals such bemusing allegations as: BMI and Preston each have 
composers and publishers as affiliates, BMI and Preston each control the copyrights which BMI licenses, BMI and Preston were 
both sued by the United States in 1964, and both BMI and Preston possess unrestrained ability to exert enormous market 
power. "

1136,1," There is no dispute over the definition of the relevant geographic market. Since defendants organize and promote tournaments

1139,3," For the 1986 Fall Tour there was a third possible source of revenue. As was explained supra, for the 1986 Fall Tour NBC did 
not pay a fixed rights fee. Instead, the PBA had to sell 24 commercial spots (of 30 seconds' length each) per tournament for 
NBC. The PBA guaranteed that it would raise a certain sum from such sales. If the PBA was able to arrange for advertising 
income over this set amount, the PBA would keep the excess amount. However, if the PBA was not able to generate enough 
spot commercial sales to reach this level, the PBA would suffer a reduction in the rights fees paid to them by NBC to make up 
the shortfall. "
1140,4," Also, plaintiff alleges that defendant never offered to sanction the Bud Ball for a price. This argument is directly related to 
plaintiff's essential facilities claim, which is discussed, infra. Unless defendants' control an essential facility, defendants have no 
obligation to deal with plaintiff on any terms. "
1141,5," The Court held that the essential facilities doctrine was not violated because plaintiff failed to show that it had suffered any 
economic loss due to defendant's actions. "
1142,6, Professional bowlers must also pay a fee to enter a PBA tournament. 
1145,7," In fact, plaintiff paid to A-B a licensing fee for the use of its logo on the Bud Ball. "

1154,3," Plaintiffs' other objections to this evidence, i.e. the alleged bias of the counsel in question and the lack of specificity of the 
advice, go more to the weight of the evidence than its admissibility. The court also finds that defendants did not prohibit or limit 
discovery to the extent claimed by plaintiffs. "
1155,4," Defendants also counter that interrogatories have indicated that testimony of these two experts will be used by the States to 
support antitrust claims purportedly assigned by utilities to states. In view of the court's ruling on the assignment issue, this 
motion may be moot. "
1156,5," The category of witnesses under the defendants' ""present employ or direct control"" includes employees only, and would 
generally not include retirees. Disputes concerning witnesses employed as consultants will be dealt with as they arise. "
1157,6," In Hanover Shoe, plaintiff alleged that defendant United had monopolized the shoe manufacturing machinery industry and 
sought treble damages for overcharges paid in leasing machinery from defendant. United defended, in part on the ground that 
Hanover had passed on the overcharge to its customers and, as a result, had suffered no injury. The Supreme Court disallowed 
the defense, concluding that (1) establishing the amount of the overcharge shifted to indirect purchase ""would normally prove 
insurmountable,"" 392 U.S. at 493, and (2) allowing a pass-on defense"" would reduce the effectiveness of antitrust actions by 
diminishing the recovery available to any potential plaintiff. See id. at 494. In Illinois Brick, the Court reached a similar result. In that case, the State of Illinois sued concrete block manufacturers for 
alleged antitrust violations. The status of Illinois was that of an indirect purchaser. The Court rejected the claim, holding that 
since, under Hanover Shoe, the defendants could not use a pass-on defense in an action by direct purchasers, offensive use of 
the pass-on theory by an indirect purchaser would implicate similar risks of complicated proof as well as risks of multiple liability. 
431 U.S. at 730-31. "
1158,7," Since the briefs of the parties fail to adequately address the assignments as they pertain to KPL's state antitrust claims, the 
court decides here only the issue of assignment of federal antitrust claims."
1158,8," For example, as defendants argue, this case could be further complicated, since even if the States could represent consumers 
residing in Kansas and Missouri, they could not represent consumers from other states. These unrepresented consumers could 
then seek intervention and further delay the resolution of the action."
1158,9," The absorption of overcharges could occur due to (1) the extent market conditions and state regulation would have allowed the 
utility to raise its rates prior to the overcharge, and (2) because state regulation might have prevented an immediate or complete 
passthrough of gas purchase costs. See Kansas and Missouri v. Utilicorp United, Inc., supra, 110 S. Ct at 2813. "
1159,10," As defendants argue, the States have not moved for substitution of parties as required by Rule 25(c), Fed. R. Civ. P., which 
applies to ""any transfer of interest"" during the pendency of an action. Although the court has decided the instant motion on the 
merits, we note that, had the motion for substitution been made, it is unlikely that we would have determined that the substitution 
would ""facilitate the conduct of the litigation."" See 7C Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure, § 1958, p. 557 
(1986)."
1159,11," We note, however, that our ruling does not, at this time, affect the assignments as they pertain to the post-trial apportionment 
between the parties of any damages."
1159,12," In addition, as the court stated in its August 2, 1990, order, any damages which are essentially duplicative will be thoroughly 
scrutinized at trial. "
1160,13," The court, however, declines at this time to grant defendants' motion with respect to the state's ""mention"" of evidence of the 
full amount of alleged overcharges in this case."
1160,14," The pretrial order identifies only three contracts, two for direct sale and one for resale, all involving the city of Springfield. "
1161,15," Defendants also seek to preclude plaintiffs from claiming damages for overcharges on their tortious interference claim. Since 
the court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment on that claim in its August 2, 1990, order, this motion is moot."
1161,16," The ""No 107"" estimate assumes the Pipeline would have refused to pay 107(c)(5) prices and would have instead paid § 102 or 
§ 103 prices. The ""market-out"" estimate assumes the Pipeline would have negotiated for immediately exercisable market-out 
provisions. Finally, the ""base case"" estimate is derived from assumptions that the Pipeline would have chosen different pricing 
alternatives based on the year the gas was produced. With respect to the utilities' expert Dr. Kretz, these plaintiffs have represented to the court that Dr. Kretz intends to rely solely on 
the ""base rate"" theory of damages. "
1162,17," Plaintiffs' argument is also based on Rule 703, Fed. R. Evid., which provides that an expert may rely on inadmissible facts or 
data in forming his opinion, as long as they are ""of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field."" "
1169,1," Defendants Amber, Krah and Grim are all citizens of New Jersey, plaintiffs' state of citizenship. Therefore, there is not complete

1175,2," In the case of Domed Stadium Hotel, Inc. v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 732 F.2d 480, 488 (5th Cir. 1984), the Fifth Circuit held that

hotel rooms, as defined by the district court. Id. at 487-89. "

1211,1, FGT operates the only pipeline transporting natural gas into Florida.
1211,2," The natural gas industry in Florida is regulated by the FERC and the Florida Public Service Commission (""FPSC""). At the 
federal level, the FERC regulates the wellhead cost of natural gas (i.e., cost from the producer to the wholesaler) and the 
wholesale price paid by retail distributors such as City Gas. At the state level, the FPSC regulates the retail rates charged by 
distributors such as City Gas. Retail rates are determined through a process known as a ""rate case."""
1211,3, The FPSC was formerly the Florida Railroad and Public Utilities Commission.

agreement the agreement was not invalid under Florida antitrust laws. The court did not reach the federal issues.  Id. at 436. "
1214,7," The Court found that the judiciary was an inadequate supervisor because no statute expressly provided for judicial review of

circumstances from 1960, when the FPSC promulgated the Order.  Id. at 339 (FPSC may withdraw or modify its approval only 
after proper notice and hearing, and upon a showing of changed circumstances). Second, in 1972 the FPSC rescinded and then 
reaffirmed its approval of the territorial agreement. FPSC Order Nos. 5495, 5800. Accordingly, the FPSC's active supervision is

1216,2," The panel, and this court today, have adopted the district court's findings of facts and conclusions of law. For the sake of 
convenience, therefore, I refer throughout this dissent to the district court's decision. "
1217,3," The district court made much of the fact that FGT assumed the lateral pipe costs. Given the uncertain state of the natural gas 
market in the 1960s, however, see infra slip op. at 5137,    , that fact is of little significance. Because the natural gas market was 
limited and its future uncertain, City Gas still took a large degree of initiative and assumed substantial risk in devoting its 
resources to natural gas distribution."
1217,4," The statute has been amended. See 1989 Fla.Laws ch. 89-292 (codified as amended, Fla.Stat. ch. 366 (1989)). See infra note 
86, for a discussion of the amendment and its relevance to the present case. "
1218,5," The district court put an unwarranted spin on its characterization of these facts. Adopting a good-guys/bad-guys motif, the 
district court cast Consolidated as the good guys and City Gas as the bad guys. Everything that City Gas did was bad -- part of 
large-scale and well-planned effort to drive out all competition from the natural gas industry and thereby grease the wheels of its 
large, rumbling monopoly. As the good guys, Consolidated naturally suffered, finding itself the weak and unwitting victim of the 
monstrous monopolist. In my view, this characterization was unjustified. Viewed objectively, City Gas' conduct was that of a rational business actor. It 
adopted an aggressive marketing campaign to increase its customer base -- activity that epitomizes competition but that the 
district court labeled anticompetitive because the conduct was a competitive success. Consider the district court's 
characterization of City Gas' marketing efforts. The district court noted that, shortly before undertaking this marketing and 
expansion effort, City Gas' Board of Directors met and considered acquiring Consolidated -- which was then simply a struggling 
LP gas company -- a consideration that hardly constitutes anticompetitive conduct. The district court then stated: City Gas' solicitations and pipeline extensions were not simply ordinary business expansions, but rather, were basic 
components of City Gas' strategy to force Consolidated to sell out. This conclusion is further supported, we think, by the 
fact that City Gas had to duplicate a portion of Consolidated's pipeline in order to serve the eighteen Consolidated 
customers it had recently signed. Yet if City Gas had expected to reach a purchase agreement with Consolidated, it would 
have acquired Consolidated's pipelines and would not have had to incur this expense. City Gas' action of duplicating these 
pipelines before notifying Consolidated of its interest in acquiring the company seems to have been designed to force 
Consolidated to sell at a low price or face the resultant certainty of losing its customers and their value as quickly as City 
Gas could serve them.  This characterization of these events is, in my view, absurd. As the Supreme Court stated in United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 
U.S. 563, 570-71, 86 S. Ct. 1698, 1704, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778 (1966), what violates section 2 of the Sherman Act is ""the willful 
acquisition or maintenance of [monopoly] power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior 
product, business acumen, or historic accident."" (Emphasis added.) City Gas' successful expansion effort was clearly the latter: 
the very type of growth or development that defines competition. If the courts were to characterize as anticompetitive conduct 
every effort that businesses undertook to expand their business through advertising and building facilities, we would soon find 
ourselves in a competitive crisis. And surely the district court did not mean to argue that because City Gas legitimately intended 
to compete for Consolidated's business -- which would in turn reduce the value of Consolidated's assets -- City Gas' conduct 
suddenly became anticompetitive. I can think of no legitimately competitive conduct that, when successful, does not adversely 
affect a less-successful competitor's assets: when one cola company captures a higher percentage of the market, another cola 
company's market share slips. Nor was the district court justified in characterizing Consolidated as a victim because, in attempting to enter the natural gas 
market as a retail distributor, it had to face City Gas as a competitor. Consider these passages from the district court's opinion: In deciding to convert from LP gas to natural gas in 1982, Consolidated suddenly found itself in potential competition with 
City Gas, which had grown to be a giant in the south Florida area. . . . . . . . Consequently, Consolidated was forced to compete with City Gas in order to retain its customers or else see them 
go to City Gas for more economical gas service. . . . . . . . Thus, it became crucial that Consolidated convert to natural gas for as low a cost as possible in order to be able to 
offer rates that were competitive with those City Gas could offer.  "
1219,665," F. Supp. at 1505-06 (emphasis added). City Gas had the foresight and took the initiative to enter the natural gas business at 
an early stage. By 1982, as the result of ""growth [and] development as a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, 
[and] historic accident,"" Grinnell, 384 U.S. at 570-71, 86 S. Ct. at 1704, City Gas found itself in a highly competitive position. For 
that, City Gas need not feel guilty. And for having failed to jump that train itself, Consolidated can claim no sympathy. By holding that under these circumstances Consolidated can invoke the antitrust laws to require City Gas to underwrite 
Consolidated's entry into the natural gas market, the district court, affirmed by the court today, embarked on an entirely 
unprecedented course. Before embarking, however, we should be entirely clear that under established law, City Gas has done 
nothing wrong."
1219,6," This expansion effort triggered a lawsuit by Consolidated, seeking an injunction to prevent City Gas from laying pipe in certain 
utility easements over which Consolidated claimed an exclusive right. The State Circuit Court granted Consolidated a preliminary 
injunction but then dissolved it, and the State Court of Appeal affirmed the dissolution, holding that Consolidated had no 
exclusive right to the easement."
1219,7," The district court again applied its good-guys/bad-guys characterization to City Gas' intervention into the FERC proceedings. 
Although the district court held that City Gas' intervention did not itself constitute a violation of section 2, the court suggested that 
the action was evidence of City Gas' bad motives. This was so for two reasons: ""first, Consolidated was severely damaged by 
the delay which occurred as a direct result of City Gas' intervention; and, second, City Gas' reason for opposing Consolidated's 
application was to protect its own domain."" 665 F. Supp. at 1542. Neither the district court, nor any one else, ever indicated that 
City Gas had committed an abuse of process by intervening into the FERC proceeding. On the contrary, City Gas, along with 
some other intervening natural gas suppliers, had legitimate concerns relating to Consolidated's requested allocation. In my 
view, a rational business actor has a strong interest in ""protect[ing] its own domain."" Id. Thus, City Gas did nothing wrong in 
intervening in the proceedings. If Consolidated's request for an allocation took longer than Consolidated expected, that may 
have harmed Consolidated but the fault is certainly not attributable to City Gas, which merely exercised its right to petition in a 
legitimate way. Perhaps the problem was that Consolidated's expectations, which the district court seems to have adopted, were 
entirely unreasonable. "
1220,8," As the district court noted, shortly before undertaking this marketing and expansion effort, City Gas' Board of Directors had met 
and passed a resolution to acquire ""the assets of Consolidated Gas Company and take whatever steps with respect thereto, as 
they deem appropriate."" 665 F. Supp. at 1507. Based on these facts, the district court concluded that City Gas' solicitations and pipeline extensions were not simply ordinary business expansions, but rather, were basic 
components of City Gas' strategy to force Consolidated to sell out. This conclusion is further supported, we think, by the 
fact that City Gas had to duplicate a portion of Consolidated's pipeline in order to serve the eighteen Consolidated 
customers it had recently signed. Yet if City Gas had expected to reach a purchase agreement with Consolidated, it would 
have acquired Consolidated's pipelines and would not have had to incur this expense. City Gas' action of duplicating these 
pipelines before notifying Consolidated of its interest in acquiring the company seems to have been designed to force 
Consolidated to sell at a low price or face the resultant certainty of losing its customers and their value as quickly as City 
Gas could serve them.  Id. at 1507-08. Faced with this situation, Consolidated began its effort to convert to natural gas. As the district court stated: ""In deciding to 
convert from LP gas to natural gas in 1982, Consolidated suddenly found itself in potential competition with City Gas, which had 
grown to be a giant in the south Florida area."" Id. at 1505."
1220,9," ""Therm,"" as defined in the FPSC's regulations under chapter 366, ""denote[s] a unit of heating value equivalent to one hundred 
thousand (100,000) British thermal units."" 1986 Fla.Admin.Code Ann. 25-7.003(15). A British thermal unit is, of course, ""the 
quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water one degree Fahrenheit."" Id. at 25-7.003(14). "
1221,10," Section 16 of the Clayton Act also provides that ""any person, firm, corporation, or association shall be entitled to sue for and 
have injunctive relief . . . against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws."" 15 U.S.C. § 26. As I discuss 
below, see infra slip op. at 5146-5150,    , courts have interpreted section 16 as imposing a causation requirement that is similar 
to section 4's. For purposes of convenience, I refer only to the requirement under section 4, but the discussion also applies to 
Consolidated's request for injunctive relief under section 16 to the extent that its request is based on the territorial agreement."
1221,11," The Government brings civil enforcement actions under section 4 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 4, which provides, in 
pertinent part: The several district courts of the United States are invested with jurisdiction to prevent and restrain violations of sections 1 
to 7 of the title; and it shall be the duty of the several United States attorneys, in their respective districts, under the 
direction of the Attorney General, to institute proceedings in equity to prevent and restrain such violations. . . . "
1222,12," In the Brunswick case, for example, the plaintiff had already proved that its loss ""occurred 'by reason of' the unlawful 
[conduct],"" or as a material result of that conduct, but the Court held that the plaintiff had not proved that the loss occurred ""'by 
reason of' that which made the [conduct] unlawful."" Brunswick, 429 U.S. at 488, 97 S. Ct. at 697. In short, not every injury 
materially caused by conduct proscribed by the antitrust laws will justify a recovery under those laws."
1222,13," As I discuss below, the district court was also off target in attempting to fit this case into the ""willful acquisition"" prong of the 
Grinnell standard. See infra part V."
1222,14," Consolidated raised only a section 2 claim, charging in its amended complaint that City Gas' conduct constituted an attempt to 
monopolize and monopolization under section 2 of the Sherman Act. Consolidated has not presented a claim under section 1 of 
the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1, attacking City Gas' conduct as part of a conspiracy in restraint of trade. The territorial 
agreement might have been relevant to such a claim."
1222,15," Consolidated claimed that this agreement was a horizontal market division. As the Court explained in United States v. Topco 
Assocs., 405 U.S. 596, 608, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 1133, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515 (1972), a horizontal market division is an agreement 
between competitors at the same level of the market structure to allocate territories in order to minimize competition. Such 
concerted action is usually termed a ""horizontal"" restraint, in contradistinction to combinations of persons at different levels of the 
market structure, e.g., manufacturers and distributors, which are termed ""vertical"" restraints. "
1223,16," In this respect, section 4's causation requirement parallels the elements of liability under section 2. As courts have stated, 
monopoly power alone provides no basis for liability under section 2; rather, the improper exercise of that power justifies the 
imposition of liability. See, e.g., Byars v. Bluff City News Co., 609 F.2d 843, 853 (6th Cir. 1979); Berkey Photo, Inc. v. Eastman 
Kodak Co., 603 F.2d 263, 273 (2d Cir. 1979) (citing Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 221 U.S. 1, 62, 31 S. Ct. 502, 516, 55 L. 
Ed. 619 (1911)), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1093, 100 S. Ct. 1061, 62 L. Ed. 2d 783 (1980); see infra slip op. at 5160,    ."
1223,17," As the passage from Grinnell cited by the district court indicates, however, the restrictive agreement in that case was only one 
of the exclusionary practices supporting the government's case. See Grinnell, 384 U.S. at 576, 86 S. Ct. at 1706-07. Whether 
that agreement, standing alone, would have provided an independent basis for liability even in Grinnell remains uncertain."
1223,18," Even if Consolidated could satisfy the injury requirement with respect to the territorial agreement, I doubt that the agreement 
would provide a basis for liability under section 2 of the Sherman Act. As I note above, see supra note 15, Consolidated properly 
characterized the agreement as a ""horizontal market division."" A horizontal market division can, of course, provide the basis for 
liability under section 1 of the Sherman Act. See, e.g., Topco, 405 U.S. at 596, 92 S. Ct. at 1126. I have found no support for the 
proposition that a horizontal market division could also provide a basis for liability under section 2. The district court here did not 
address this point; it merely stated that ""a territorial agreement, even between regulated utilities, is a per se violation of the 
Sherman Act"" and concluded that City Gas ""has violated § 2 of the Sherman Act."" 665 F. Supp. at 1532. In support of this 
proposition, however, the district court cited three cases in which territorial agreements were held to violate section 1, and not 
section 2, of the Sherman Act. These section 1 cases, in my view, do not control in this section 2 case. Thus, the district court's "
1224,," holding that the territorial agreement provided a basis for liability under section 2 -- even if Consolidated could satisfy the Clayton 
Act's causation requirement -- lacks supporting authority. "
1225,19," These definitions contain a resonance of what a market historically was: a physical location where merchants sold their goods. 
The definitions, however, use terms of location that are at once more modern and more abstract, referring to ""any context"" or 
""any area."""
1225,20," This description would apply as well to the historical market -- the physical location where merchants hawk their goods. The 
mere existence of such a physical market did not guarantee a ""market"" in the sense of a mechanism for negotiating price. The "
1226,," physical market meant that parties to a potential transaction had a place where they could conduct their negotiations, but it did 
not necessarily provide the parties with a history of transactions in the context of which they could negotiate a price. For example, imagine strolling through the agora on a classically beautiful day in ancient Athens. Merchants are selling olives, 
retsina, and goats. Suddenly, a mysterious looking figure appears in the center of the agora with a creature resembling a goat, 
but golden in color and with a single, spiral horn rising from the top of its head. The figure announces that this creature is for 
sale, and a crowd begins to gather. A goatherd, whose interest has been piqued, offers to buy the beast for five drachmas, the 
going rate for a ram. The mysterious figure laughs and instead offers to sell the unicorn in exchange for the goatherd's entire 
herd. The goatherd, along with the rest of the crowd, looks at the figure in surprise. Clearly, they have never tried to buy a 
unicorn before. The figure scans the crowd, but no one attempts another offer. With a sudden wave of his arm, the figure opens 
a path through the crowd and departs, as quickly as he came. The historical market, thus, provides a stage for this scene. The history of transactions incorporated in that market, however, are 
useless as a basis for arriving at a price for a unicorn. "
1228,21," That criterion must be satisfied before the FERC can order an allocation under Section 7(a) of the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. 
§ 717f(a) (1988), which requires that the allocation be ""necessary or desirable in the public interest"" standard. "
1229,22," Ball based his ""competitively priced source of gas"" figure on the price City Gas paid for wholesale gas from FGT. As I discuss 
below, see infra notes 60-61 & accompanying text, that figure provided an improper basis for calculating Consolidated's future 
profits if Consolidated purchased gas from City Gas. These figures, on the other hand, would provide a proper basis for 
calculating Consolidated's future profits if Consolidated purchased gas from FGT, which is the focus of my discussion here."
1229,23," The source of these and other present-value figures in this opinion is L. Gitman, Principles of Managerial Finance app. A, tbl. 
A-4 (3d ed. 1982). "
1232,24," Monopoly leveraging also refers to a monopolist's conduct in attempting to integrate vertically, by using its established 
monopoly power (on a given level of the market) to leverage its way into another level of the market. "
1233,25," But see Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp. v. Aspen Skiing Co., 738 F.2d 1509 (10th Cir. 1984), aff'd, 472 U.S. at 585, 105 S. Ct. 
at 2847. The Tenth Circuit there applied the essential facilities doctrine to a refusal to deal that did not involve monopoly 
leveraging. See infra slip op. at 5184-5187,    , for a discussion of the case. In affirming the Tenth Circuit, however, the Supreme 
Court did not analyze the case under the essential facilities doctrine. In my view, this case is not properly classified as an 
essential facilities case."
1233,26," As Areeda and Hovenkamp note, the essential facilities doctrine can be mechanically applied to a broad range of situations: 
""the 'essential facility' is just an epithet describing the monopolist's situation: he possesses something the plaintiff wants. It is not 
an independent tool of analysis but only a label -- a label that beguiles some commentators and courts into pronouncing a duty 
to deal without analyzing the implications. . . ."" P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law, para. 736.1a, at 701 (Supp. 1989). "
1234,27," To summarize briefly the terminology, refusal to deal cases under section 2 involve two types of conduct, either monopoly 
leveraging or non-monopoly leveraging. Courts have developed a variety of formulas for analyzing the circumstantial evidence in 
these refusal-to-deal cases in order to determine whether the evidence gives rise to an inference of anticompetitive intent. These 
formulas include the essential facilities doctrine, the intent test, and the monopoly-leveraging theory. "
1235,28," I have discussed in detail above the irrelevance of City Gas' abandoned contract with Florida Gas. See supra slip op. at 5158-
5160,    . "
1236,29," In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), this court adopted as binding precedent all 
decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to October 1, 1981. "
1237,30," As I discuss below, see infra part VI, the present case also involves difficulties in fashioning a remedy that do not arise in 
these monopoly-leveraging cases. In these cases, the defendants were already engaged in providing the service at issue: Kodak 
sold photographic supplies at wholesale; National Screen sold movie advertising accessories at wholesale. Here, City Gas never 
sold gas at wholesale to anyone. In fashioning a remedy, therefore, the district court could look to no price established by City 
Gas for the transaction at issue. The district court instead had to set its own price (a task it delegated to the FPSC). That task 
presents a set of complications that I explore below. Regarding these problems, however, the monopoly-leveraging cases 
provide no guidance. "
1238,31," As a more general problem, the district court improperly identified the facility at issue here. According to the district court's 
description, the facility appears to be a facility (the pipesystem) and the resource contained in that facility (the natural gas for 
resale). The district court, however, also referred to ""City Gas' lateral pipe"" as the essential facility. This lateral pipe connected 
City Gas' pipesystem to FGT's pipeline and enabled City Gas to pump a supply of natural gas into its pipesystem. Which of 
these three elements -- the gas, the lateral pipe, or the pipesystem itself -- constituted the essential facility? Clearly, all three 
components, together, formed the essential facility here. Consolidated did not want access just to City Gas' lateral pipe. That 
pipe was located a long distance from Consolidated's pipesystem. Consolidated, however, needed more than just gas: it needed 
access to City Gas' entire pipesystem in order to obtain the gas. Of course, Consolidated wanted access to that pipesystem only 
insofar as it contained gas, thus making the lateral pipe (through which City Gas acquired its gas) an indispensable component 
of the facility. In short, Consolidated wanted to hook into City Gas' pipesystem, at a point near Consolidated's own pipesystem, 
in order to take gas from City Gas' pipesystem (gas from FGT's pipeline that entered City Gas' pipesystem through City Gas' 
lateral pipe) in order to supply its own pipesystem. In effect, therefore, Consolidated wanted access to City Gas' entire 
distribution operation. This case is not about a piece of City Gas' system, but rather about that system as a whole. Consolidated claimed that in order 
to compete with City Gas, it had to have access to City Gas' system. Consolidated needed gas from FGT, and, according to 
Consolidated, City Gas -- with its lateral pipe and pipesystem -- stood between Consolidated and FGT. Thus, Consolidated 
either had to go around City Gas' system or through it. Consolidated argued that going around that system would be too 
expensive to allow Consolidated to compete (in effect, what the second element of the essential facilities doctrine requires). It 
therefore claimed that access to the facility -- i.e., City Gas' system as a whole -- was ""essential."" Consolidated, therefore, 
wanted to be a customer of City Gas', but with an important difference from the rest of City Gas' customers: Consolidated 
wanted City Gas to sell this gas at a lower price than City Gas charged its other customers so that Consolidated itself could turn 
around and sell the gas. "
1240,32," The nature of the facilities that courts have held are not practically or feasibly able to be duplicated in other essential facilities 
cases also supports my conclusion here. See, e.g., Terminal R.R., 224 U.S. at 383, 32 S. Ct. at 507 (major railroad terminal); 
Fishman, 807 F.2d at 520 (Chicago stadium); Aspen, 738 F.2d at 1509 (ski mountain); Hecht, 570 F.2d at 982 (Robert F. 
Kennedy Stadium). "
1241,33," As I explain in detail below, see infra slip op. at 5196-5203,    , by ""fair"" price, I mean the price required by the just 
compensation clause of the fifth amendment."
1241,34," The government brought suit under section 4 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 4, contending that the arrangement was a 
combination in restraint of trade in violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act, id. § 1. "
1242,35," The Court rejected the government's request for a dissolution of the ownership group. Relying on a proposition that ""'injury to 
the public by the prevention of an undue restraint on or the monopolization of trade or commerce is the foundation upon which 
the prohibitions of the statute rest,'"" id. 224 U.S. at 409, 32 S. Ct. at 515 (quoting Standard Oil, 221 U.S. at 78, 31 S. Ct. at 523), 
the Court held that mandating equal access to the facility on the part of all railroads would accomplish the requirements of the 
antitrust laws most consistently with the public's interest in a well-operated railroad terminal. "
1244,36," The monopoly-leveraging cases that I discuss above, see supra slip op. at 5167-5168,    , would therefore not control here 
either. "
1245,37," Indeed, it differs from refusal-to-deal cases in general, under any formula of analysis. See supra slip op. at 5160-5165,    . "
1246,38," As such, this element would be very different from a legitimate business reason asserted by a company in its defense after a 
plaintiff has already submitted sufficient evidence to raise an inference of anticompetitive intent."
1246,39," That is, it must satisfy the fifth amendment's just compensation requirement. See infra slip op. at 5196-5203,    . "
1248,40," These advertisers, moreover, did not request advertising space on special terms, monetary or otherwise; the subject of their 
advertisements was unobjectionable; and the advertisements would not have had an adverse impact on the newspaper's ability 
to attract other clients. Thus, the newspaper presumably had no legitimate business reason for its refusal. "
1252,41," Although the FPC could not order a company to wheel involuntarily, the FPC did have authority to order interconnections and 
sales at wholesale."
1252,42," The Court faced the question of whether the federal regulatory scheme limited the district court's power to fashion a decree. 
The Court concluded that the requirement of FPC approval of interconnections posed a potential limit on the decree. Because 
the decree mandated wholesaling only subject to Commission approval, however, the facts of the case did not implicate that "
1253,," limit. If, in light of future events, a problem were to arise, the Court indicated that the district court, which retained jurisdiction, 
could consider the problem then. The Supreme Court noted, however, that the Federal Power Act gave the FPC no authority to order an electric company to 
wheel if the company had not voluntarily undertaken an obligation to do so, see id. at 375-76, 93 S. Ct. at 1028-29. Thus, the 
federal regulatory scheme had no impact on the district court's decree that Otter Tail wheel power.  Id. at 376, 93 S. Ct. at 1029; 
see Florida Power & Light Co. v. FERC, 660 F.2d 668, 674-76 (5th Cir. Unit B Nov. 1981), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1156, 103 S. 
Ct. 800, 74 L. Ed. 2d 1003 (1983)."
1253,43," In fact, the court held only that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's finding that AT & T's refusal to deal was 
unlawful.  708 F.2d at 1132-33. "
1254,44," MCI merely wanted access to the local exchange facilities on the same terms that AT & T had access to them. The Bell 
System, which consisted of twenty-three operating companies, provided the local exchange services. These companies were in 
the business of providing telephone service on the local level and of selling AT & T access to that service for its long-distance 
operation. Thus, the Bell System was obviously in the business of interconnecting long-distance lines to its local switching 
services."
1254,45," The court reached this conclusion based on its application of antitrust principles. It considered those principles independently 
of the effect that a regulatory determination regarding such interconnections might have. As the court admitted, its conclusion 
might have been different if the FCC had authorized or mandated that AT & T provide the interconnections. Without such an 
FCC order, however, the antitrust laws imposed no duty on AT & T to provide the interconnections. See id. at 1149. "
1256,46," The government might also bring a civil enforcement action under section 4 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 4, to enjoin the 
defendant from refusing to deal in violation of section 2. See infra note 11."
1256,47," As I elaborate below, see infra slip op. at 5205-5210,    , the private plaintiff may also seek, in addition to an injunction, 
damages for profits lost between the refusal to deal and the date of final judgment; or, if injunctive relief would not provide a 
remedy because the refusal to deal forced the plaintiff to go out of business, then the plaintiff may seek damages for loss of its 
going concern value and damages for profits lost in the interim."
1256,48," The district court and panel made much of the fact that City Gas ""had, in fact, entered into a contract with a third party [Florida 
Gas] to sell its gas for resale."" 880 F.2d at 300, see 665 F. Supp. at 1510. This contract, however, was merely executory: City 
Gas never performed. As the panel claimed, this contract no doubt provides evidence that City Gas had ""power"" to sell gas at 
wholesale, 880 F.2d at 301 (emphasis in original), but the contract is not evidence that City Gas ever actually did sell at 
wholesale. As I discuss in part IV, that City Gas might have possessed the power to sell at wholesale is neither here nor there; 
rather, what is significant is that City Gas legitimately chose not to exercise that power -- not selling to Consolidated, to Florida 
Gas, or to any other firm. And in making this choice, City Gas did nothing wrong. As I also discuss in part IV, the contract would not be relevant even if the parties had not abandoned it: the contract would have 
involved a different geographic market than the market involved in the present case. Perhaps the best evidence of this contract's 
irrelevance, though, is the fact that the district court never looked to it as a basis for establishing a selling price in its injunctive 
order requiring City Gas to supply wholesale gas to Consolidated. The district court delegated the task of establishing a selling 
price to the FPSC. See 665 F. Supp. at 1512, 1534, 1545. In so doing, the district court implicitly found the Florida Gas contract 
to be unreliable as evidence of City Gas' wholesale gas price."
1256,49," In articulating this new rule of law, the district court should have distinguished the body of antitrust cases in which courts have 
held that the antitrust laws impose no positive duties, but only negative duties. See, e.g., Aspen, 472 U.S. at 600-01, 105 S. Ct. 
at 2856-57; United States v. Colgate & Co., 250 U.S. 300, 307, 39 S. Ct. 465, 468, 63 L. Ed. 992 (1919); Olympia, 797 F.2d at 
376 (7th Cir. 1986); Florida Fuels, Inc. v. Belcher Oil Co., 717 F. Supp. 1528, 1532 (S.D.Fla. 1989). These cases teach that a "
1257,," company has no duty to foster competition or to aid a competitor but that a company may not do anything to prohibit competition 
or to prevent a company from competing. Under the district court's new rule, which the court today upholds, section 2 would 
seem to impose a positive duty on City Gas, requiring it to sell at wholesale to Consolidated so that Consolidated can compete, 
even though City Gas has never voluntarily sold wholesale gas to any firm. Although I see no grounds for distinguishing these 
cases from the present case, I assume for purposes of discussion that their inapplicability to the present case could be 
explained."
1257,50," In the typical refusal-to-deal case, the fifth amendment poses no problem: the court requires the defendant to sell at its 
already-established selling price, applying a presumption that the defendant has set the price that it must receive in order to 
obtain just compensation. "
1258,51," The Hope Court approved historical cost as a basis for calculating rates. Under this rule, just compensation is provided by 
""rates which enable [a] company to operate successfully, to maintain its financial integrity, to attract capital, and to compensate 
its investors for the risks assumed."" Hope, 320 U.S. at 605, 64 S. Ct. at 289. The rationale behind this rule, as one judge has stated, is that regulation was part of the original compact between investors and the state. Rate regulation is, in theory, the substitute for 
competition. The state stands in the shoes, as it were, of competitors, keeping the utility within bounds that would be drawn 
by market forces in a non-monopolistic market. Whether economically sound or not, utility rate regulation in itself raises no 
constitutional concerns.  Jersey Central, 810 F.2d at 1190 (Starr, J., concurring). A crucial principle behind this rule, therefore, is the idea that the utility 
companies have voluntarily undertaken to operate in a regulated industry, enjoying the benefits of a natural monopoly in return 
for submitting to reasonable regulation of their rates. As a corollary to this principle, the utility company may, of course, choose 
not to participate in the industry any longer: although the regulations limit the companies' rates, those regulations, as this court 
has itself observed, do not require ""the regulated group . . . to participate in the regulated industry."" Whitney v. Heckler, 780 F.2d 
963, 972 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 813, 107 S. Ct. 65, 93 L. Ed. 2d 23 (1986)."
1258,52," Application of established takings cases also supports this conclusion. In this case, the ""compact"" rationale, see supra note 
51, under which utilities voluntarily subject themselves to regulation in return for certain benefits, does not apply. Rather, ""the 
regulated group is . . . required [by a federal court implementing the Sherman Act] to participate in the regulated industry,"" 
Whitney, 780 F.2d at 972, and courts have considered such compulsion to be an important indication of a fifth amendment 
taking. Such a regulation could still be enforced if the company was provided just compensation. Because the company acts 
under compulsion, however, rather than voluntarily submitting to regulation as in the ratemaking cases, the court should apply a 
more rigorous standard for just compensation than the relatively broad ""zone of reasonableness"" standard developed under 
Hope. Before turning to the question of just compensation, I first analyze this case under established takings principles. As the Supreme Court has emphasized, ""the power to exclude has traditionally been considered one of the most treasured 
strands in an owner's bundle of property rights."" Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419, 435, 102 S. Ct. 
3164, 3176, 73 L. Ed. 2d 868 (1982); see Nollan v. California Coastal Comm'n, 483 U.S. 825, 830-32, 107 S. Ct. 3141, 3145, 97 
L. Ed. 2d 677 (1987); Kaiser Aetna v. United States, 444 U.S. 164, 179-80, 100 S. Ct. 383, 393, 62 L. Ed. 2d 332 (1979); see 
also FCC v. Florida Power Corp., 480 U.S. 245, 251-53, 107 S. Ct. 1107, 1112, 94 L. Ed. 2d 282 (1987). In fact, the Court has 
held that a permanent physical occupation of property by the government constitutes a per se taking. See, e.g., Loretto, 458 
U.S. at 434-36, 102 S. Ct. at 3175-76; see also Florida Power Corp., 480 U.S. at 251-53, 107 S. Ct. at 1112. The severity of 
such an invasion warrants this conclusion without requiring analysis under the ""multifactor inquiry generally applicable to 
nonpossessory governmental activity."" Loretto, 458 U.S. at 440, 102 S. Ct. at 3178-79; see Penn Central Transp. Co. v. City of 
New York, 438 U.S. 104, 124, 98 S. Ct. 2646, 2659, 57 L. Ed. 2d 631 (1978) (describing multifactor inquiry); see also infra 
(applying inquiry in present case). The Supreme Court has emphasized, however, that this permanent-physical-occupation rule 
is ""very narrow."" See, e.g., Florida Power, 480 U.S. at 251-53, 107 S. Ct. at 1112; Loretto, 458 U.S. at 441, 102 S. Ct. at 3179. In my view, this case presents a close question concerning the Loretto rule's applicability. Loretto involved a state regulation that 
required landlords to allow cable television companies to install cable facilities on their property. The Court found that the 
installation involved a permanent, physical attachment and thus held that it constituted a per se taking.  Loretto, 458 U.S. at 441, 
102 S. Ct. at 3179. As the Court has subsequently indicated, a key rationale behind that holding was the fact that the statute 
required landlords to allow cable installation. On this basis, the Court in Florida Power distinguished a federal statute, the Pole 
Attachments Act, 47 U.S.C. § 224 (1982), which authorized the FCC to regulate the terms of contracts between utility companies "
1259,," and cable operators for the attachment of cable to utility poles, from the regulation in Loretto. As the Florida Power court 
discussed, while the statute we considered in Loretto specifically required landlords to permit permanent occupation of their property 
by cable companies, nothing in the Pole Attachments Act as interpreted by the FCC in these cases gives cable companies 
any right to occupy space on utility poles, or prohibits utility companies from refusing to enter into attachment agreements 
with cable operators. "
1259,480," U.S. at 251, 107 S. Ct. at 1112. The Court in Florida Power expressly stated, however, that it did ""not decide . . . what the 
application of Loretto . . . would be if the FCC in a future case required utilities, over objection, to enter into, renew, or refrain 
from terminating pole attachment agreements."" Id. at 251 n. 6, 107 S. Ct. at 1112 n. 6. The present case seems to present 
exactly this question, and to the extent that the element of compulsion explains the rule in Loretto, that rule should apply here. Another key factor in the Loretto decision was the nature of the invasion: the permanence of the facilities and the landlord's lack 
of control over them and their installation. In my view, the invasion in the present case is factually similar. As in Loretto, the 
district court's mandate requires a permanent, physical intrusion onto City Gas' property. The intrusion is permanent in two ways: 
first, a pipe must be constructed permanently to attach City Gas' pipesystem to Consolidated's pipesystem; and second, this 
interconnecting pipe will permanently drain natural gas from City Gas' pipesystem and into Consolidated's pipesystem. As the 
Court has previously held, such a continuous arrangement constitutes a ""permanent physical occupation"" for purposes of the 
Loretto rule. See Nollan, 483 U.S. at 832, 107 S. Ct. at 3145 (easement giving individuals ""permanent and continuous right to 
pass to and fro, so that the real property may continuously be traversed""). I also think that City Gas, like the landlord in Loretto, lacks control over this invasion. City Gas has no control over the invasion in 
that City Gas cannot refuse to provide gas. But City Gas also lacks control over the invasion in a secondary sense that the 
Loretto Court also held to be important. The Court there referred to the landlord's lack of control over the ""placement, manner, 
use, and possibly the disposition of the installation"" and suggested that the outcome might have been different if the landlord 
had such control.  458 U.S. at 440 n. 19, 102 S. Ct. at 3179 n. 19. Similarly, in Nollan, the Court noted the property owner's 
inability to regulate the continuous flow of traffic across his property. See 483 U.S. at 830-32, 107 S. Ct. at 3145. Here, City Gas 
will have to supply gas according to the terms mandated by the district court: in set amounts, at set times, and at set prices. The 
fact that City Gas owns its own pipesystem is of no significance. The district court, and not City Gas, decrees the terms of the 
arrangement. I would think, therefore, that Loretto controls: if section 2 of the Sherman Act requires City Gas to deal under these 
circumstances, that constitutes a per se taking. Even if Loretto does not control, this forced supply constitutes a taking under the Penn Central multifactor inquiry. That inquiry 
looks to (1) the economic impact of the regulation, (2) the extent to which it interferes with investment-backed expectations, and 
(3) the character of the governmental action. See Penn Central, 438 U.S. at 124, 98 S. Ct. at 2659. Imposing a duty to deal will 
have a significant economic impact on City Gas. With an investment of time and money, City Gas will have to divert some of its 
own gas supply to Consolidated and also administer the actual process of supplying gas to Consolidated. In addition, by 
enabling Consolidated to compete without having to undertake the costs associated with entry into the natural gas supply 
business, the duty to deal might force City Gas to change its retail distribution business: in order to avoid losing customers to 
Consolidated, City Gas might (subject to the FPSC's approval) have to lower its retail prices, if it can do so without loosening the 
safety controls of its operation; it might have to undertake a more aggressive marketing strategy, which would in turn increase its 
operating costs; it might also lose potential business opportunities -- e.g., the ability to extend its services to customers in 
territory occupied by Consolidated. In the event of a gas shortage, moreover, City Gas might have to curtail delivery to its own 
customers in order to continue supplying Consolidated. As these considerations suggest, the duty to deal will also interfere with City Gas' investment-backed expectations. By changing 
the market's regulatory structure and altering the nature of competition in that market, the duty to deal will significantly affect 
these expectations. Finally, the character of the district court's invasive action suggests a taking. This is not a case where a government regulation 
merely restricts the use of property. Rather, the case involves an actual physical invasion of City Gas' property: gas is removed 
from its pipesystem and transferred to Consolidated's pipesystem. Even under the multifactor inquiry, therefore, this case 
involves a taking. "
1260,53," In deciding this case, of course, the court faces the question of just compensation in a different procedural context than it 
would in the standard ratemaking cases that I cite above. Rather than reviewing a state or federal agency's rate determination to 
decide whether it passes constitutional muster, the court, as I explain in the text below, must itself set the just compensation 
price in order to determine the issue of liability in the case. In addition, this ""taking"" must satisfy the fifth amendment's ""public use"" requirement. That requirement, however, has been 
interpreted broadly. As the Supreme Court stated in Hawaii Housing Auth. v. Midkiff, 467 U.S. 229, 240, 104 S. Ct. 2321, 2329, 
81 L. Ed. 2d 186 (1984), ""the 'public use' requirement is . . . coterminous with the scope of a sovereign's police powers."" See 
also Berman v. Parker, 348 U.S. 26, 32-33, 75 S. Ct. 98, 102, 99 L. Ed. 27 (1954). Thus, the courts conduct ""'an extremely 
narrow'"" review of ""a legislature's judgment as to what constitutes a public use,"" Midkiff, 467 U.S. at 240, 104 S. Ct. at 2328 
(quoting Berman): ""the Court . . . will not substitute its judgment for a legislature's judgment as to what constitutes a public use 
'unless the use be palpably without reasonable foundation,'"" id. at 241, 104 S. Ct. at 2329 (quoting United States v. Gettysburg 
Elec. R. Co., 160 U.S. 668, 680, 16 S. Ct. 427, 429, 40 L. Ed. 576 (1896)). I assume, for the sake of discussion, that the taking 
in the present case would satisfy this requirement."
1260,54," In effect, antitrust doctrine already reflects this idea by holding that a party is not liable under section 2 for a refusal to deal if a 
valid business justification supports that party's decision. See, e.g., Mid-Texas Communications Sys., Inc. v. AT & T, 615 F.2d 
1372, 1388-89 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 912, 101 S. Ct. 286, 66 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1980); Poster Exchange, 431 F.2d at 
339; Gamco, Inc. v. Providence Fruit & Produce Bldg., Inc., 194 F.2d 484, 488 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 344 U.S. 817, 73 S. Ct. 
11, 97 L. Ed. 636 (1952)."
1260,55," In its ""cost"" figure, the district court below included only the price that City Gas paid for its wholesale gas and not the overall 
costs that City Gas incurred in its retail gas operation. See 665 F. Supp. at 1511."
1260,56," As I discuss above, see supra notes 5 & 7, the district court below put a spin on these facts, characterizing City Gas as the 
bad guys and Consolidated as the good guys. The district court suggested that City Gas knew its initial offer of cost plus ten 
cents per therm was too high and that the FPSC would never approve it. In addition, the district court pointed to testimony by "
1261,," City Gas' Vice President that ""he made no attempt to ascertain a reasonable price for direct gas sales to Consolidated, and that 
he came up with the cost plus ten cents terms 'out of the air.'"" 665 F. Supp. at 1510. This characterization assumes that City Gas had a duty to enable Consolidated to enter the natural gas business at as little cost 
as possible so that it could most effectively compete with City Gas. Because City Gas did not want, and did not seriously 
attempt, to do this, the court characterized its behavior as bad. This characterization is counterintuitive. City Gas did exactly 
what one would expect any rational business firm to do: it continued operating as it normally did, doing nothing illegal to obstruct 
a potential competitor's entrance into the market but also doing nothing to facilitate its entrance into the market. To characterize 
this type of conduct as bad is to adopt a position totally at odds with normal business practices in this country."
1261,57," Consolidated must show that City Gas' price exceeded the fifth amendment price by a substantial amount. If that point is fairly 
debatable, then City Gas will not be subject to liability. I suggest that Consolidated might also have to show that its counter offer was reasonable in light of the fifth amendment price. If 
Consolidated offered a price, indicating that it would pay no more for the gas, and the fifth amendment price substantially 
exceeded Consolidated's offered price, then Consolidated has no claim under section 2."
1261,58," Consolidated bears the burden of proof on this point. In arranging the order of proof, however, the court might apply a 
presumption requiring City Gas to come forward with all of the evidence, on the ground that the evidence is exclusively in its 
possession and that fairness requires City Gas to proceed first. City Gas will then have to present evidence demonstrating that 
the price it quoted to Consolidated was necessary to provide just compensation. See infra slip op. at 5199-5203,    , for a 
discussion of the factors relevant to such a showing. The burden, however, will then shift to Consolidated to rebut City Gas' just 
compensation price."
1261,59," Blackacre's fair market value can be determined based on the selling price of comparable pieces of property. Even if no 
comparable sales have occurred in the market, the value can be determined by constructing a hypothetical market and taking 
expert testimony regarding Blackacre's best-use price. "
1262,60," If such a company had existed in the present case, then the district court below, in fashioning its injunction requiring that City 
Gas sell to Consolidated, would not have had to delegate to the FPSC the task of setting a selling price. See 665 F. Supp. at 
1512, 1534, 1545. Instead, it could have looked to that other company's wholesale gas price as evidence of City Gas' just 
compensation price. Even if such a company could be found, its selling price would probably not be controlling. That company would be a regulated 
company, selling its wholesale gas at rates approved by the FPSC. As such, that company would have voluntarily undertaken to 
sell at wholesale in a regulated market, subjecting itself to the FPSC's rates in return for the benefits of operating in a regulated 
industry. See supra note 51. That price would not be presumptively fair to City Gas, a company that has not voluntarily 
undertaken to deal at those FPSC-approved rates."
1262,61," Consolidated obviously could not point to the price charged by wholesalers like FGT, as a basis for the just compensation 
price. City Gas has opted not to sell in the wholesale market, applying its resources to the retail market instead. As a retail 
distributor, City Gas' fixed and operating costs are entirely different from those of a wholesaler like FGT: City Gas' investments 
are committed to a variety of expenditures that are unnecessary for a wholesale operation. In order to receive a reasonable 
return on its investment, therefore, City Gas must charge a different price than FGT charges."
1262,62," In order to evaluate this last factor, the court considers, in part, probable changes in the market value of Consolidated's stock."
1262,63," As the Hope Court stated: The investor interest has a legitimate concern with the financial integrity of the company whose rates are being regulated. From 
the investor or company point of view it is important that there be enough revenue not only for operating expenses but also for 
the capital costs of the business. These include service on the debt and dividends on the stock. . . . By that standard the return 
to the equity owner should be commensurate with returns on investments in other enterprises having corresponding risks. That 
return, moreover, should be sufficient to assure confidence in the financial integrity of the enterprise, so as to maintain its credit 
and to attract capital."
1262,320," U.S. at 603, 64 S. Ct. at 288."
1262,64," That is, Consolidated must prove that the price City Gas offered Consolidated was substantially higher than the fifth 
amendment price. See supra note 57."
1262,65," In that context, moreover, the courts' task is eased by a high initial burden of proof on the utility company to show that the rate 
is unreasonable before the test even applies. In addition, the courts apply a broad standard of reasonableness in reviewing rates 
set by regulators. In part, that standard reflects institutional concerns and ensures the courts' deference to agencies' 
determinations. That standard also reflects the nature of the compact between utility companies that have voluntarily entered a 
regulated market and the state, which regulates the market. See supra note 51. In the present case, however, City Gas has not "
1263,," voluntarily entered such a compact. A price that might be satisfactory in the regulatory context, therefore, will not necessarily 
provide City Gas with a reasonable rate of return on its investment here."
1263,66," As I develop below, see infra slip op. at 5210-5213,    , the district court in this case did not find a fifth amendment price, let 
alone evaluate City Gas' offered price in light of that fifth amendment price. The district court, therefore, never properly decided 
whether, in light of the fifth amendment price, City Gas actually refused to deal under section 2. In addition, having failed to find 
a fifth amendment price, the district court did not properly determine whether Consolidated actually suffered injury as a result of 
City Gas' refusal to deal. Finally, because of this failure to find a fifth amendment price, the remedies fashioned by the district 
court were also erroneous: as I discuss below, see id., proper remedies in this case must be based on the fifth amendment 
price."
1263,67," City Gas' shareholders will initially absorb these expenses through a depletion of City Gas' resources but will then pass them 
off to the customers through rate increases. If the FPSC does not approve rate increases, however, the shareholders will 
assume the burden themselves. In that case, City Gas will eventually go out of business (when its resources are exhausted). "
1265,68," Congress surely did not design the antitrust laws merely to prevent companies from going out of business where the 
defendant has done nothing to undercut that company's ability to compete. Nor did Congress provide for liquidated damages in 
the antitrust laws, and I sincerely doubt that Congress intended the antitrust laws to tie up a courtroom for months for the 
purpose of awarding nominal damages merely to punish a company such as City Gas for not selling gas at the fifth amendment 
price."
1265,69," Curiously, Consolidated did not request a preliminary injunction. If Consolidated's ability to operate as a natural gas supplier -- 
and to do so at a profit -- depended upon a hook-up to City Gas, then presumably Consolidated would have wanted a hook-up 
as soon as it could obtain one. Nevertheless, for reasons not apparent in the record, Consolidated decided not to request a 
preliminary injunction. Instead, it waited until trial to specify the remedy it was seeking. There, Consolidated claimed that City 
Gas, by refusing to supply wholesale gas, had in effect taken Consolidated's business. Consolidated therefore sought damages 
in the form of the going concern value of its business. Through its expert witness, Ben Ball, Consolidated asserted that City Gas 
had deprived it of twenty years of future profits. As it turned out, the district court awarded Consolidated its lost future profits 
(reduced to their present value) as well as a permanent injunction requiring City Gas to supply Consolidated with gas at a price "
1266,," to be set by the FPSC. The granting of injunctive relief was patently inconsistent with the damages award, an issue that I discuss 
below, see infra slip op. at 5209-5210, 5212,    ,    ."
1266,70," If Consolidated cannot show past injury for purposes of the damages award, then Consolidated will probably also be unable to 
show a likelihood of future injury for purposes of injunctive relief. In a case such as this one, a plaintiff generally proves a 
likelihood of future injury based on a showing of past injury."
1266,71," Conceivably, Consolidated could have lost a part of its going concern value prior to its total demise. Assume, for example, that 
Consolidated (as an LP gas distributor) serviced Whiteacre and Blackacre and that, soon after the refusal to deal, City Gas took 
control of Blackacre. At that point, which preceded its general demise, Consolidated lost the ability to go back into operation in 
Blackacre even if it could have acquired a supply of gas before its general demise. In that case, Consolidated would still seek 
damages for the company's going concern value just prior to the demise, as well as damages for profits lost prior to its demise; it 
would also seek damages for the going concern value of its operation in Blackacre -- the portion of its operation that was lost 
before the demise. Of course, when the court determined the going concern value of Consolidated's entire operation just prior to 
the demise, that operation would no longer include Consolidated's operation in Blackacre. Cf. infra note 76 (discussing loss of 
partial going concern value in relation to injunctive relief). "
1267,72," I assume that City Gas was Consolidated's only feasible gas supplier, i.e., that hooking up to FGT's pipeline was too 
expensive for Consolidated."
1267,73," In the dickering process, the buyer and seller assess the risk of the investment. The buyer emphasizes the possibility that 
Consolidated will generate profits only for a short term, taking into account the likelihood of changes in the fifth amendment 
price. Obviously, the more uncertain Consolidated's profit picture might be, the less the buyer is willing to pay."
1267,74," For the sake of discussion, I assume that $ 250,000 in annual profits represents Consolidated's net operating profits: gross 
revenues less gas delivery costs with no reserve for depreciation. I also assume that Consolidated's fixed assets -- its plant and 
equipment -- are self-consuming and will be worthless at the end of twenty years."
1267,75," In the unlikely event that the demise occurred the moment of City Gas' refusal, and Consolidated could still show that it could 
have turned a profit had City Gas not refused to deal, then Consolidated obviously cannot seek damages for lost profits in the 
past: the damages for loss of future profits will be calculated as of the moment of the refusal and will thus include all profits that 
Consolidated could have generated had the refusal not occurred. "
1268,76," These two remedial schemes would be consistent and would not involve a double recovery in a case where a company 
permanently loses part of its assets as a result of a refusal to deal but retains enough of its assets to continue operating once it 
gains access to the needed resource. Assume, for example, that Company A operated in Whiteacre and Blackacre and had an 
opportunity to expand into Beyondacre. As a result of Company B's refusal to sell resource X to Company A (which would 
constitute a violation of section 2 under the district court's new rule, even though Company B has never sold resource X to other 
companies), Company A can no longer operate in Blackacre and has lost forever the opportunity to expand into Beyondacre; 
Company A's operation, although still profitable, is now limited to Whiteacre. Thus, the court grants an injunction ordering 
Company B to deal, which allows Company A to continue its operation in Whiteacre, and the court also awards damages for lost 
profits between the time of Company B's refusal to deal and the final judgment in the case. In addition, the court awards 
Company A the fair market value of its operation in Blackacre and its opportunity to expand into Beyondacre (these business 
opportunities having been lost forever). If the court, in doing so, made the necessary factual findings -- such as what the fifth 
amendment price was for resource X, whether Company A could turn a profit given that fifth amendment price, and what the 
degree of uncertainty concerning Company A's profitability was -- these remedies would be proper."
1268,77," The district court below found that City Gas refused to deal as of February 20, 1982 -- the date when City Gas' Board of 
Directors met and first considered acquiring Consolidated. In my view, that finding is clearly erroneous. The refusal could not 
have occurred until City Gas and Consolidated entered into negotiations and City Gas refused to deal at the fifth amendment 
price. "
1269,78," In improperly directing the parties to repair to the FPSC for a determination of the wholesale price, the district court in the 
present case implied that the FPSC's price would, without further consideration by the district court, operate as a provision (the 
price term) of the injunction. The district court apparently gave no thought to what should happen if the FPSC's price did not 
satisfy the fifth amendment. That is, the district court did not retain jurisdiction to review the FPSC's price in the event that the 
price failed to provide City Gas with just compensation. "
1270,79," Ball's testimony assumed an entire taking of Consolidated's business as a company with gas. Thus, the record provided no 
basis for treating this case as a partial-taking situation, see supra notes 71 & 76, in which damages for loss of going concern 
value might be consistent with injunctive relief."
1270,80," In awarding Consolidated damages in the form of the present-day value of the profits that it would have made over the next 
twenty years, the district court found -- albeit implicitly (by accepting Ben Ball's testimony) -- that City Gas would have supplied 
gas for that period at a ""competitive price."" If Ball's testimony supported the finding that, with a supply of gas from City Gas, 
Consolidated could have operated profitably for twenty years, then that testimony certainly supported, with equal force, the 
district court's conclusion (implicit in its award of permanent injunctive relief) that an injunction would enable Consolidated to 
operate profitably for twenty years. "
1271,81," Municipalities, unlike private parties, must satisfy only the first Midcal requirement in order to have Parker immunity. See Town 
of Hallie v. City of Eau Claire, 471 U.S. 34, 46-47, 105 S. Ct. 1713, 1720, 85 L. Ed. 2d 24 (1985). "
1273,82," Because the state courts conducted no review of specific committee decisions, the Patrick court found it unnecessary to 
decide ""the broad question whether judicial review of private conduct ever can constitute active supervision."" 486 U.S. at 104, 
108 S. Ct. at 1664-65; see also Pinhas v. Summit Health, Ltd., 894 F.2d 1024, 1030 (9th Cir. 1989) (also avoiding that question), 
cert. granted, 496 U.S. 935, 110 S. Ct. 3212, 110 L. Ed. 2d 660 (1990). I consider this question below, as it applies to this case. 
See infra slip op. at 5223,    ."
1273,83," The Court did suggest that a simple ""minimum markup"" statute, which required retailers to charge 112% of their actual 
wholesale cost, might satisfy Midcal's second prong. See 479 U.S. at 344 n. 6, 107 S. Ct. at 725 n. 6. "
1274,84," This chapter has been amended by 1989 Fla. Laws ch. 89-292, to authorize expressly the FPSC to approve territorial 
agreements and resolve territorial disputes between natural gas utilities. I consider below the amendment's effect on the present 
case, see infra note 86."
1274,85," Indeed, once the panel's decision in this case adopted this inconsistent position, the Florida legislature in effect overruled it by 
adding language that expressly authorizes the FPSC to approve territorial agreements and resolve territorial disputes between 
natural gas utilities. The legislature thus made explicit what, as I have observed, was already implicit in the old provision. "
1276,86," This conclusion finds support in the Florida Supreme Court's holding in the Peoples Gas case that chapter 366 implicitly grants 
the FPSC power to approve territorial agreements. As the panel noted, 880 F.2d at 302-03, although that decision is not 
dispositive of this inquiry, it is relevant."
1276,87," The district court quoted the relevant passage from the FPSC's decision: It is not clear that this Commission has the statutory authority to either establish exclusive service territories for natural gas 
utilities (as it does for telephone, water and sewer utilities) or resolve territorial disputes between natural gas utilities (as 
specifically authorized for electric utilities). However, our resolution of this question is not necessary in view of our [other] 
finding. . . . "
1276,665," F. Supp. at 1530. This ""expression of doubt"" is clearly dictum. Whatever doubt the FPSC might have expressed, moreover, 
has not effected the FPSC's actions in approving territorial agreements, as I discuss. Also, that expression of doubt has nothing 
to do with the active supervision issue; rather, the expression merely comments on whether the state has clearly articulated a 
policy in favor of territorial agreements. As I show above, the state has indeed done so -- regardless of whatever doubt the 
FPSC (an agency without judicial authority to interpret legislative intent) may have expressed. "
1277,88," As the Supreme Court has made clear, a state court's determination that conduct is consistent with some state law does not 
necessarily insulate that conduct from federal antitrust law. See Parker, 317 U.S. at 351, 63 S. Ct. at 314 (citing Northern Sec. 
Co. v. United States, 193 U.S. 197, 344-47, 24 S. Ct. 436, 459-61, 48 L. Ed. 679 (1904)). Here, however, the Florida Supreme 
Court has approved that conduct as consistent with the state's policy to displace competition in the natural gas industry. Such a 
decision is exactly what invokes Parker immunity."
1277,89," Curiously, the panel noted that City Gas challenged the district court's holding that Parker immunity did not apply to its refusal 
to deal, see 880 F.2d at 301, but nevertheless failed to address the issue."
1277,90," The district court claimed that the legislature, in drafting this provision, had in mind sales of gas for resale to landlords who 
would re-meter the gas for further distribution to their tenants and that the legislature, therefore, did not specifically contemplate 
wholesale sales to other natural gas utilities. Although the legislature no doubt had in mind sales to landlords, that fact provides 
no basis for the district court's conclusion that this provision does not apply to wholesale sales to other natural gas utilities. Not 
only is that reading inconsistent with the provision's plain language, which refers in broad terms to sales of gas for resale 
generally, but the district court's construction of the legislature's intent is extremely crabbed. Wholesale sales to other natural "
1278,," gas companies also place an administrative burden on the FPSC by altering the structure of competition in the industry or of the 
utility's assets, thus increasing the complexity of the ratemaking process. See supra slip op. at 5218-5219,    . The district court's 
too narrow construction of the legislature's intent is thus inconsistent with the nature of the regulatory scheme created by chapter 
366. "

an issue of fact as to the competition element, based in part on the fact that the defendant's advertisements reached the 
plaintiff's market area.  The court also relied on statements that the plaintiff's customers would ""buy the product at a much lower 
price at [the defendant's store]"" to find that there was an issue concerning the defendant's competitive presence in the plaintiff's 
market area.  594 F Supp at 1035. "
1299,10," Yamaha argues on appeal that there was no evidence at trial that any of those dealers closed because of Yamaha's sale to 
Beaverton and that other factors contributed to the closures.  Although we do not decide that issue, the concurrence in time of 
those events made such evidence relevant for consideration by the jury."
1299,11," The jury awarded plaintiff damages of $ 2,166.56 for the difference in price charged to Beaverton and plaintiff on 1982 
motorcycles purchased from defendant and $ 23,691.45 for the reduction in value of plaintiff's 1980 and 1981 motorcycles, for 
total price discrimination damages of $ 25,858.01.  The jury also gave plaintiff an identical award of $ 25,858.01 on its alternate 
breach of contract claim (for the reduction in value of plaintiff's inventory of new and noncurrent motorcycles due to Yamaha's 
breach of the dealership agreement).  The trial court trebled the price discrimination award and entered judgment for plaintiff for 
$ 77,574.03.  The trial court offset that award by $ 29,391, which the parties had stipulated plaintiff owed Yamaha for parts, 
resulting in a net recovery to plaintiff of $ 48,183.03. "
1300,12," Federal cases interpreting the Robinson-Patman Act do require that discriminatory sales be ""reasonably contemporaneous.""

presumes that plaintiff was damaged in the amount of the price discrimination that is the difference between the price 
charged plaintiff and the price charged Beaverton.  This amount may not exceed $ 3,292.24. ""This presumption of damages only applies to plaintiff's price discrimination claim.  That presumed price differential cannot 
be the basis for the measure of damage on the other claim. ""* * * ""Plaintiff seeks damages for reduction in value of plaintiff's 1980 and 1981 motorcycle inventory which plaintiff had on hand

1376,2," The plaintiff alleges that New York law applies to the fourth cause of action. The defendants contend that New York and Illinois

1387,2," Most courts have rejected the hard-to-calculate marginal cost standard and have replaced it with a calculation of reasonably 
anticipated average variable cost. See, e.g., Transamerica Computer Co. v. IBM, 698 F.2d at 1386. The Federal Trade 
Commission has held that there is a presumption of legality if defendant's prices are above average variable costs. This 
presumption becomes conclusive if the prices exceed average total costs. ITT Continental Baking Co., 3Trade Reg. Rep. para. 
22,188 (FTC 1984). The FTC and others urge capital, executive, and administrative costs, sales expenses, and some elements 
of promotional expense to be included in the average variable cost computation. Areeda and Turner include only capital costs in 
their computation. "
1388,3," At one point, the Court refers to Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., stating that ""we found that a plaintiff competitor had 
not shown antitrust injury and thus could not challenge a merger that was assumed to be illegal under § 7 of the Clayton Act . . . 
."" USA Petroleum, 495 U.S. at 340. Later in that decision, the Court declares, ""We have previously recognized that even in 
cases involving per se violations, the right of action under § 4 of the Clayton Act is available only to those private plaintiffs who 
have suffered antitrust injury."" Id. at 344 (emphasis in the original). A third time when the Court implies that the antitrust injury 
must be shown as a jurisdictional concern is where the Court states that it declines to dilute the antitrust injury requirement 
against vertical, maximum price-fixing schemes, ""if such a scheme causes the anticompetitive consequences detailed in 
Albrecht, consumers and the manufacturers' own dealers may bring suit."" Id., referring to Albrecht v. Herald Co., 390 U.S. 145, 
159, 19 L. Ed. 2d 998, 88 S. Ct. 869 (1968), reh'g denied, 390 U.S. 1018, 88 S. Ct. 1258, 20 L. Ed. 2d 169. Finally, the Court 
declares that since ""respondent's injury . . . . is not 'inextricably intertwined' with the antitrust injury that a dealer would suffer,"" it 
""does not militate in favor of permitting respondent to sue on behalf of petitioner's dealers."" Id. at 345, quoting Blue Shield of 
Virginia v. McCready, 457 U.S. 465, 484, 73 L. Ed. 2d 149, 102 S. Ct. 2540 (1982)."

presence in the market.'"" ARCO v. USA Petroleum, 495 U.S. at 334 (1990), quoting Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, 
Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 489, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701, 97 S. Ct. 690 (1977). Likewise, the Court declares, ""The per se rule is a method of 
determining whether § 1 of the Sherman Act has been violated, but it does not indicate whether a private plaintiff has suffered 
antitrust injury and thus whether he may recover damages under § 4 of the Clayton Act."" Id. at 341. Furthermore, ""the antitrust 
injury requirement ensures that a plaintiff can recover only if the loss stems from an competition-reducing aspect of effect of the 
defendant's behavior."" Id. at 328 (emphasis deleted). "

1404,3," As authority for its decision that antitrust claims are assignable, the Third Circuit in In re Fine Paper, 632 F.2d at 1090, relied on 
D'Ippolito v. City Service Co., 374 F.2d 643 (2d Cir. 1967); Hicks v. Bekins Moving & Storage Co., 87 F.2d 583, (9th Cir 1937);

1405,5," The Seventh Circuit held in Tellis v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 805 F.2d 741, 745-46 (7th Cir. 1986), that treble 
damage claims could best be characterized as penal in nature. While this may support an argument that Fishman should be 
limited to its particular facts, this court hesitates to place too much emphasis on an assessment that arose in a completely 
different context. Tellis involved an analysis of the various state statutes of limitations that could be applied to RICO actions, 
prior to the Supreme Court's application of the Clayton Act statute of limitations in Agency Holding Corp, 483 U.S. 183. "
1407,1," The factual background of the parties' dispute is more fully described in this Court's Memorandum Opinion of May 8, 1990. For 
purposes of the pending motion, less detail is necessary."
1407,2," In its memorandum in support of the pending motion, Shell has advised that it will soon move for summary judgment on Count 
I. The deadline for submission of substantive motions in this case is November 30, 1990."
1407,3," As is customary in the petroleum business, Shell owns the realty on which its service stations are located. Under Shell's 
variable rent program, Shell dealers receive rent discounts for gasoline orders above specified levels. Thus, the more gasoline a 
dealer orders from Shell, the less rent he pays to Shell. Shell negotiates agreements involving rent discounts with each 
individual dealer, and provisions pertaining to rent discounts therefore differ from dealer to dealer. "
1408,4," Further guidance is provided by regulations published by the Federal Trade Commission. These regulations list the following 
examples of services within the scope of § 2(e): handbills, displays, demonstrations, catalogs, storage cabinets, accepting 
returns for credit, prizes or merchandise for conducting promotional contests. 16 C.F.R. § 240.5 (1990). One commentator has "
1409,," theorized that ""to fall Within the category of a 'service or facility,' the benefit: (1) must be of a kind which facilitates resale by the 
purchaser (rather than the original sale to the purchaser); (2) must be accorded to the buyer 'in connection with' (or bearing 
some relationship to) the 'sale' of a commodity; and (3) must be with respect to a product the purchaser is reselling rather than 
consuming. E. Kintner, Federal Antitrust Law § 27.6 (1983). "
1414,1," We assume, without deciding, that the relevant market consists of the servicing and repair of AMI machines in the Washington, 
D.C., area. As we discuss below, the district court found a genuine issue of fact concerning the market definition. Because of our 
disposition of the other issues in this case, however, we need not reach the issue of market definition. "
1415,2," The alleged deception would not have harmed consumers because they would ostensibly have received the same service as 
under the PMA contract, but at a lower price. "
1416,3," AMI acknowledges that it sometimes allows phone orders from individual customers that are smaller with a lower risk in case of 
error. "

(N.D. Ill. 1975). "
1422,1," Plaintiff also argues that an interlocutory appeal will not materially advance the termination of the litigation. Plaintiff's Opening 
Memorandum at 6-7. If the Court certified the question presented and the Third Circuit Court of Appeals held that plaintiff has no 
standing, this case would be completely finished at the trial court level. On the other hand, plaintiffs may or may not appeal the 
Court's dismissal of their other claims. See August 30, 1990 Order at 2 (dismissing plaintiffs' claims concerning other airplanes). 
Because the Court holds that there is no substantial ground for difference of opinion, it will not reach the advancement of 
litigation issue. "
1423,2," Because Cessna was not a party to Rosefielde, Judge Lechner's decision could not have had any preclusive effect on the 
Court's recent determination of the standing issue. See Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc. v. University of Illinois Foundation, 
402 U.S. 313, 329, 91 S. Ct. 1434, 1443 (1971) HN2[
] (due process prohibits issue preclusion against non-party to first 
litigation of issue). The August 30, 1990 indicates that Judge Lechner's decision had no collateral estoppel effect on the Court's 
recent decision on standing. See August 30, 1990 Opinion at 15 n.1 (referring to, but not relying on, Rosefielde)."
1423,3," HN3[
] Section 4 of the Clayton Act provides in relevant part: ""Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by 
reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor . . . and shall recover threefold the damages by him 
sustained. . . ."" 15 U.S.C.A. § 15(a) (Supp. 1990)."
1423,4," Cessna argues that Utilicorp aids its argument in favor of certification pursuant to 28 U.S.C § 1292(b) because the district court 
in Utilicorp certified the direct purchaser issue to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. Cessna Reply Memorandum at 4. When the 
district court certified the issue, however, the Seventh Circuit decision which the district court had followed had recently been 
withdrawn.  In re Wyoming Tight Sands Antitrust Cases, 695 F. Supp. 1109, 1119 (D. Kan. 1988), aff'd, 866 F.2d 1286 (10th 
Cir. 1989). By the time the Tenth Circuit answered the certified question, the Seventh Circuit had issued an en banc opinion 
reversing its original stance. 866 F.2d at 1293. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve the conflict between the Seventh 
and Tenth Circuits. 110 S. Ct. at 2811. There is no such history in this case. In fact, Cessna has not brought to the Court's 
attention any apposite case from any court to support its position. "
1424,5," The Court gives little weight to the characterization of this transaction as a sale by the manufacturer to Macy's. There is little 
reason to believe the parties to the closing had the arcana of antitrust standing in mind when they named the closing 
memorandum. "
1435,1," Further references to the transcript of the preliminary injunction hearing will be referred to as ""Tr.""."
1435,2," The civil law doctrine of culpa in contrahendo is embodied in Art. 1802, 31 L.P.R.A. sec. 5141 which states that: A person who 
by an act or omission causes damage to another through fault or negligence shall be obliged to repair the damage so done. 
Concurrent imprudence of the party so aggrieved does not exempt from liability, but entails a reduction of the indemnity. "

1438,4," Puerto Rico commentators and courts have stated that interpretations of the Federal Robinson-Patman Act are to be looked to 
in construing Section 263. See, e.g., Estrella, Antitrust Law in Puerto Rico, 28 Revista Juridica del Colegio de Abogados, No. 
3, pg. 615 (It is hornbook law that when a statute is adopted from a foreign jurisdiction, it is presumed to be adopted with the

here""). "

1453,1," Anaheim purchased 96.8%, Riverside 97.2% and Azusa, Banning and Colton 100% of their wholesale capacity requirements 
from Edison during the period from 1975 through 1985. Anaheim and Riverside did make purchases from suppliers other than 
Edison during that period. Since these purchases were not integrated, the total amount of electricity purchased from Edison was 
87.5% for Anaheim and 89.4% for Riverside. "
1454,2," Anaheim's capacity provided by Edison was 68% in 1986, 35% in 1987 and 1988 and 24% in 1989; Riverside's capacity

1454,4," The initial hearings before the Administrative Law Judge (""ALJ"") on both the cost of service issue and the price squeeze claim 
were held in August 1977. The ALJ issued an initial decision on June 1, 1978, approving the rate increase in part and ordering 
refunds to the Cities of $ 4.4 million. The Cities' price squeeze claim was rejected.  Southern California Edison Co., 3 FERC 
para. 63,033 (1978). The FERC affirmed the ALJ's findings on the cost of service issue, and in an appeal dealing only with this 
issue, the Court of Appeals affirmed. Southern California Edison Co., 8 FERC para. 61,198 (1979), reh'g denied in part and

1981). The FERC disagreed, however, with the ALJ's price discrimination analysis and remanded the price squeeze claim for a 
second phase of hearings. "
1456,5," It is the FERC's view that ""price discrimination becomes 'price squeeze' when the disparity between wholesale and retail rates 
causes an anticompetitive effect, i.e., the wholesale customer loses or is likely to lose retail load, thereby 'squeezing' the 
wholesale customer out of the retail market."" FERC IV, 40 FERC at 62,151."

Court adopted the ""monopoly leveraging"" theory. The Court held that ""the use of monopoly power attained in one market to gain 
a competitive advantage in another is a violation of § 2, even if there has not been an attempt to monopolize the second market. 
It is the use of economic power that creates the liability."" Id. at 276. The Ninth Circuit has not adopted the flexible standard for 
monopoly leveraging Set forth in Berkey. In Catlin v. Washington Energy Co., the Ninth Circuit noted that it had not adopted 
Berkey in any of its decided cases, but instead has found § 2 violations based on anticompetitive conduct by the monopolist in 
the second market. 791 F.2d 1343, 1346 (9th Cir. 1986) (discussing M.A.P. Oil Co. Inc. v. Texaco, Inc., 691 F.2d 1303 (9th Cir.

& Brunner, supra, at 576-79 (describing general difficulty of identifying culpable behavior in the regulatory context). "
1467,15," Edison has also argued that certain regulatory differences between the CPUC and the FERC must be taken into account in 
determining whether a price discrimination exists at all. Since Edison controlled the time and amount of the rate increase, the 
rate differential cannot be attributed to regulatory differences. The regulatory differences, however, like any differences in the 
cost of service, may be appropriately considered in measuring the quantum of discrimination. "
1469,16," J. Truett Payne v. Chrysler Motors Corp., 451 U.S. 557 (1980) does not control this case. Truett Payne held that price 
discrimination alone could not establish both the fact and the measure of injury for a treble damage claim under § 4 where the 
plaintiff had established price discrimination in violation of the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. 13(a). The Robinson-Patman Act 
outlaws price discrimination by ""any person engaged in commerce,"" where the effect ""may be substantially to lessen competition 
or tend to create a monopoly . . ."" 15 U.S.C. § 13(a). Because Robinson-Patman is a prophylactic statute, a court cannot infer 
from the fact of a violation that the defendant's behavior has caused the plaintiff any injury.  Truett Payne, 451 U.S. at 569 
(Powell J., dissenting); cf. Brunswick, 429 U.S. 477 (addressing § 7 of the Clayton Act, also a prophylactic statute); see also 
Areeda, Antitrust Violations Without Damage Recoveries, 89 Harv. L. Rev. 1127, 1130-33 (1976) (describing relationship 
between substantive liability under § 7 of the Clayton Act and damage recoveries). In contrast, § 2 prohibits unlawful use of 
monopoly power because such conduct is harmful to competition. One kind of violation of § 2 is charging monopoly prices, which 
a plaintiff can show harms it directly. Hanover Shoe, 392 U.S. at 489. The electric utility price squeeze has not generally been 
attacked under the Robinson-Patman Act, in part because of uncertainty over whether courts would find electricity to constitute a 
commodity for purposes of the Act, compare City of Newark, 467 F. Supp. at 774 (not a commodity) with City of Kirkwood, 671 
F.2d at 1181 (is a commodity), but perhaps also because of the limitations of Truett Payne. "
1470,17," The Court does include in price squeeze damages the expenses of litigating the defendants' attempt to withdraw as wholesale 
suppliers. Mishawaka II, 616 F.2d at 989-90. "
1471,18," Courts have also applied the essential facility doctrine to find violations of § 1 of the Sherman Act. See, e.g., Hecht v. Pro-
Football, Inc., 570 F.2d 982 (D.C. Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 436 U.S. 956 (1978) (holding a restrictive covenant in a stadium lease 
violates § 1 where use of stadium is essential to potential market entrant.)"
1471,19," In Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585 (1985), the Supreme Court did not base its decision on 
the essential facility doctrine, but the reasoning of Aspen nevertheless influenced the analysis to be employed in essential facility 
cases."
1471,20," Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U.S. 184, 197 (1964) (Stewart, J., concurring). "
1473,21," The Court has not separately analyzed whether the Cities have established Edison's monopoly power for the foreclosure 
claim. For the purposes of this discussion, the Court will assume that the Cities have made any additional showing necessary to 
the extent the analysis of this element of a § 2 essential facilities claim differs from a § 2 price squeeze claim."
1473,22," Settlement agreements require Edison to provide the Cities with all their bulk power requirements and to wheel power that the 
Cities obtain elsewhere. Therefore, this case does not present the question of whether the Intertie is essential because Edison 
has cut off the Cities' access to power. Cf. Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States, 410 U.S. 366 (1973) (vertically integrated utility 
must transmit power over its lines to municipalities that compete with the utility at retail). "
1474,23," In reaching this conclusion, the Court has accepted the Cities' argument that the interruptible service offered by Edison was 
not a reasonable alternative to firm access. "
1475,24," CPUC did not review transmission agreement between Edison and Pasadena over Palo Verde line because FERC was the

Corp., 834 F.2d 208, 217 n. 4 (1st Cir. 1987); United Jersey Banks v. Parell, 783 F.2d 360, 366 (3rd Cir.), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 
1170, 90 L. Ed. 2d 979, 106 S. Ct. 2892 (1986); Powers v. South Cent. United Food & Commercial Workers Unions, 719 F.2d 
760 (5th Cir. 1983)."
1486,5," In re Carter, 618 F.2d 1093 (5th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 949, 67 L. Ed. 2d 378, 101 S. Ct. 1410 (1981), did not 
involve a motion to remand filed by the plaintiff. Rather, the plaintiff was arguing that he had relied upon federal law. It was the 
defendant, who, after removing the case and losing, alleged that the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction. The 
court was not recharacterizing the plaintiff's complaint in a fashion contrary to the plaintiff's own position.  Furthermore, in 
Powers v. South Cent. United Food & Commercial Workers Unions, 719 F.2d 760, 766 (5th Cir. 1983), the Fifth Circuit stated 
that, in Carter, ""the plaintiff's complaint necessarily presented a federal claim."" In Buchanan v. Delaware Valley News, 571 F. Supp. 868, 872 (E.D. Penn. 1983), the Court held that, since Pennsylvania had 
no state antitrust statute, the plaintiff's state antitrust claim was actually a federal antitrust claim. In In re Wiring Device Antitrust Litigation, 498 F. Supp. 79, 81 (E.D.N.Y. 1980), it was conceded that there was diversity between 
the parties. Therefore, the Court's discussion regarding the federal question was mere dicta. Furthermore, there had previously 
been a federal antitrust indictment, as well as thirty federal antitrust cases with the same claims and defendants. See Bowlus v. 
Alexander & Alexander Servs., 659 F. Supp. 914, 919 (S.D.N.Y. 1987). Lastly, in Three J Farms, Inc. v. Alton Box Board Co., 1979-1 Trade Cas. (CCH) (D.S.C. 1978), paras. 62,423, 76,547, 76,550, 
rev'd on other grounds, 609 F.2d 112 (4th Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 445 U.S. 911, 63 L. Ed. 2d 327, 100 S. Ct. 1090 (1980), the 
court held that, since plaintiff's complaint alleged interstate commerce and since the Supreme Court of South Carolina had 
previously ruled that any claim alleging interstate commerce must be federal antitrust claim, South Carolina had displaced state 
law from the field."
1486,6," The defendant also cites to T.O.C., Inc. v. United Artists Theatre Circuit, 631 F. Supp. 832 (N.D. Cal. 1986). However, this case 
was recently disapproved of by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in Redwood Theatres, Inc. v. Festival Enterprises, Inc., 908 
F.2d 477 (9th Cir. 1990). "
1487,7," Thus, even if the defendant has correctly interpreted the reach of the Healy v. Beer Institute, Inc., 491 U.S. 324, 105 L. Ed. 2d 
275, 109 S. Ct. 2491, 2499 (1989), the Court notes that such an interpretation would simply constitute a federal defense to the 
plaintiff's state-law claims. "
1490,1, The pertinent paragraphs are as follows:
1490,20," . Ameritech and Illinois Bell's latest discriminatory tactic will slash All-Tone's profits and will require All-Tone to charge its 
customers more for pay telephone service than Illinois Bell charges its own [pay telephone] customers for the same service."
1490,21," . Beginning on March 4, 1987, Ameritech and Illinois Bell will charge All-Tone a new, discriminatory rate for use of central 
office services and facilities. The new rate is sensitive to (a) the time of day the call is placed, (b) the distance the call travels, (c) 
the time length of the call, and (d) the volume of calls placed from the calling telephone number."
1490,22," . Prior to March 4, 1987, All-Tone paid Illinois Bell approximately 4.5 cents per call made on one of All-Tone's pay telephones 
to a location within the Chicago calling area. As a result, All-Tone was able to charge customers a flat rate of twenty-five cents 
for each local call. Under the new discriminatory tariff, the telephone call in Chicago will cost 4.5 [cents] could now cost All-Tone 
in excess of 25 [cents]."
1490,23," . Under the new tariff, the charges All-Tone will pay to Illinois Bell will increase sharply. These increased charges will 
adversely affect All-Tone's ability to compete in the market. For example, if All-Tone keeps its charge to the customer at 25 
[cents], its profit margin could disappear entirely; alternately, if All-Tone raises its charges to compensate for the increased rates, 
it cannot and will not be competitive with Illinois Bell telephones. In locations where both All-Tone and Illinois Bell have a pay 
telephone, an All-Tone customer will have to pay more for a call placed on the All-Tone pay telephone, an All-Tone customer will 
have to pay more for a call placed on the Illinois Bell pay telephone."
1490,24," . In addition, because of the new rates, All-Tone will be required to bear the cost of reprogramming all of its pay telephones in 
order to charge its customers according to the new rate schedule."
1490,25," . Illinois Bell's new tariff does not change the rate for Illinois Bell's pay telephones. As a result, users of Illinois Bell's pay 
telephones will continue to make calls within the Chicago calling area for a flat rate of twenty five (sic) cents. "
1493,2," The resale of telephone services to customers such as All-Tone is an example of how the state regulates the telephone service 
industry. It is not controverted that Illinois Bell, in the past, provided telephone service only to end-users. That is, customers were 
not allowed to resell to others the service they received from Illinois Bell. About the time of the 1984 Bell Systems divestiture, the 
Commission decided to permit resale in Illinois. See United States v. Western Electric Co., Inc., 673 F.Supp. 525 (D.D.C. 
1987); and Interim Order, Second Interim Order, and Third Interim Order, Docket 82-0292, August 24, 1983, June 27, 1984, and 
September 18, 1984, respectively."
1493,3," Northeastern Telephone Company v. AT & T, 651 F.2d 76 (2d Cir. 1981); U.S. Transmission Systems, Inc. v. AT & T, 564 
F.Supp. 1020 (S.D. N.Y. 1983); United States v. AT & T, 461 F.Supp. 1314 (D.D.C. 1978). "
1503,1, The jury instructions listed the following six alleged anticompetitive acts:
1503,1, .  Monopolistic stone pricing;
1503,2, .  Price or profit squeezing and cross-subsidization;
1503,3, .  Leveraging its position in ODOT and OTC;
1503,4, .  Tying the sale of stone and sand to the sale of asphalt;
1503,5," .  Intimidating, discouraging, coercing and retaliating against competitors;"
1503,6," .  Refusal to sell stone to Sader. Defendants assert that because the jury's above-reflected response to the interrogatory did not list any of these six alleged 
anticompetitive acts, its findings were not consistent with a violation of the antitrust laws. The trial court found, however, that the 
jury's response to this ""one or more"" question was not inconsistent with the general verdict. "
1504,2," Defendants named were the Johnson companies, Ohio Engineering Co. (Ohio), Fred R. Creager & Sons, Inc. (Creager), Matco 
Asphaltic Concrete Producing Co. (Matco), OAMCO, Inc. (OAMCO), C.P. Calaway, Inc. (Calaway), Maumee Stone Co. 
(Maumee), Michigan Stone Co. (MSC), Wolcottville Sand & Gravel Corp. (WAS&G), Saxon Development Co. (Saxon), Stoneco, 
Inc. (Stoneco), and J.T. Kirkby."
1504,3," Defendants also responded that Ohio & Metro ""no longer exist,"" and that Calaway ""is currently an inactive corporation"" (as of 
July 1986). Johnson answered that Maumee & MSC merged into it; that WAS&G ""operated a sandpit in Indiana and became 
inactive and is now inactive, but that WAS&G's assets, after reactivation, were transferred into Stoneco."" Defendants further 
answered that Saxon ""is inactive and has no current business activities."" Kirkby was alleged, in the answer, to have owned less 
than a five percent interest in Johnson at all relevant times."
1504,4," We do not endorse the reason given by the district court for this ruling. While we find no error in the holding that evidence of 
bidding practices may be relevant and admissible, we do not believe, as asserted, that its exclusion would be to ""direct a verdict 
for defendants."" We held in Langenderfer I that bidding ""above the total average costs"" of defendants was not an antitrust 
violation under the Sherman Act, and that the proper test for anticompetitive conduct in that regard was not whether defendants' 
bids were ""above competitors' costs."" 729 F.2d at 1055. The effect of Langenderfer I, it should be observed, was to set aside the 
judgment based upon plaintiffs' asserted cause of action for predatory pricing, which was the thrust of the first trial and appeal. 
The district court, however, charged the jury to the above effect. Plaintiffs' experts emphasized what they perceived to be low 
bidding and ""predatory pricing"" conduct of defendants. "
1506,5," In a deposition, Chesebro stated that this two county area remained ""pretty constant."" He also stated that ""Seneca and 
Sandusky Counties account for over 90 percent of our work."" (emphasis added) (referring to the entire relevant period). 
Defendants' credit officer Uhl testified, without contradiction, that M & B won bids on ODOT work in only three counties over 
twenty-plus years prior to trial. The amended complaint asserted that M & B ""engaged in business as a general paving 
contractor principally in Seneca, Sandusky, and contiguous counties."""
1506,6," M & B's Chesebro testified also that M & B bought very little stone from defendants' quarry at Portage, and only on occasion. M 
& B bought or obtained few materials from defendants and cannot fairly be characterized as anything but a minor and infrequent 
customer. Defendants' alleged high stone prices, bringing about an alleged profit squeeze, would therefore seem clearly not to 
bear on M & B's situation directly, if at all. "
1507,7," Price did not sell its sand business to defendants; instead, defendants agreed to continue buying sand from Price (and others). "
1509,8," Sader stated that in recent years 90 percent of his work was in Wood County and areas of nearby Lucas County. In earlier 
years he did work within and without the wider thirteen-county area, but again mostly in Wood County."
1509,9," Urbana moved this plant away at the expiration of its lease. Sader testified that its superintendent later was employed by 
defendants. Wood's plant and equipment were taken over by Portage in 1964 or 1965. "
1510,10," In cross-examining defendants' expert, Dr. Myslinski, Sader's counsel referred to Pugh and West Millgrove quarries as being 
12 to 15 miles away from Bowling Green."
1510,11," Apparently, defendants continued to operate Creager after acquisition as a non-union facility in contrast to its other facilities. 
Sader complained this gave an advantage to defendants, but this has nothing to do with anticompetitive conduct."
1510,12," Sader admitted that most other ""smaller pavers that worked the area was [sic] having the same problems with scheduling."" 
Sader was thus not singled out or treated discriminatorily in that regard."
1510,13," Sader conceded that he bought ""very little"" stone from Maumee."
1510,14," A monthly bill on August 31, 1979 (Exhibit 9M) revealed that Sader owed Maumee Stone Co. nearly $ 47,000, a considerable 
part of which was at least 30 days old, and that in early September, Sader paid some $ 11,000 on this bill; Sader satisfied this 
account the following month, mid-October. Early in 1980, Sader's account reflected over $ 26,000 past due (up to 90 days) and 
he was warned, per telephone, that the ""account is in serious condition and because of the status credit privileges have been 
removed."" (Exhibit BP.) In fact, credit limits of $ 10,000 were later imposed. In 1982, credit privileges were again suspended for "
1511,," delinquent accounts. In March of 1980, by notice, France also advised Sader that its ""account is seriously overdue,"" and his 
credit privileges were apparently withdrawn at a France quarry. "
1512,15," Sader, upon cross examination, stated that he did not believe that his credit had been suspended in 1979 or 1980 when his 
deposition was taken and the first trial took place. He added that he would not have a problem if defendants ""treated me like they 
treated everybody else"" in credit matters. He conceded, however, that he had credit problems with defendants as early as 1978 
and that this continued into 1983."
1512,16," Being ""cut off"" meant essentially that Sader was required to pay cash rather than rely on credit for certain periods of time. 
Sader was placed on a ""permanent job basis"" by defendants, after a number of revocations and reinstatements of credit, in 
August 1983. "
1514,17," Rocky Ridge quarry, owned by defendants, slightly exceeded Portage's costs in 1983. Portage reflected no cost data in 1984, 
and its costs exceeded its average sales price in 1982. "
1517,18," Defendants in White & White were found to have a market share in various markets of as much as 45 percent and over 30 
percent in others. "
1518,19," Martin Marietta was described in an antitrust suit by a sand and gravel operator which dealt in coarse gravel or stone used in 
construction of roads as ""a large, diversified company with holdings in various fields including the production of sand and gravel 
(aggregates). It has aggregates holdings in fifteen states. . . ."" Chillicothe Sand & Gravel v. Martin Marietta Corp., 615 F.2d 427, 
428 (7th Cir. 1980). France is owned by Koppers Corp., a large conglomerate. "
1519,20," In closing argument, MacRitchie's attorney claimed basic damages of approximately $ 188,745 for MacRitchie; the jury 
awarded $ 200,000. As of March 31, 1985, MacRitchie had an accumulated deficit of $ 560,000. "
1520,21," Burton MacRitchie testified that his company, NOAP, and/or other MacRitchie family enterprises, operated an asphalt batch 
plant at the West Millgrove quarry from 1960 to 1980. He purchased stone and manufactured sand from France. He testified that 
he only occasionally obtained sand from defendants. Mr. MacRitchie testified also that MATCO was to the S.E. Johnson Co. as 
NOAP was to Langenderfer, both producing asphalt utilized by their paving companies."
1520,22," Burton MacRitchie conceded that there were a number of independent sand producers in Wyandot County serving the south 
and east part of the relevant market area and others in Indiana and Michigan serving the western and northern portions."
1520,23," France apparently allowed discounts on stone prior to 1972. France's prices and those charged by independent quarries were 
different. Independent quarries sometimes gave a volume discount. "
1523,24," Southaven Land, like Associated General Contractors, discusses § 4 of the Clayton Act but it is entirely relevant to discussion 
of the anti-trust claims in this case."
1523,25," See Associated General Contractors, 459 U.S. at 544. "
1525,26," The district court discussed in the jury instructions plaintiffs' contention about ""price squeeze"" or ""profit squeeze"" or ""cross 
subsidizing."" This contention was that ""defendants have used their monopoly power in stone to gain an unfair advantage in 
paving."" (emphasis added). As we have seen, however, defendants did not have sufficient market power or price control in 
limestone to constitute monopoly power. Plaintiffs' theory of ""duopolization"" through their expert witness, Dalton, simply had no 
legal basis of support in treating and combining the shares and practices of France with those of defendants to evidence alleged 
monopoly power and control. "
1526,27," Price's principal plant at Norwalk, Ohio, was outside the bounds of the thirteen-county area by a distance of approximately 15 
miles, and he operated principally in Huron and Erie Counties, outside the relevant market area. "
1527,28," The 1969 pretax profit figure of $ 189,382 for Langenderfer is indeed difficult to accept as ""normal."" It is considerably more 
than the same pretax profit totals for 1966, 1967, 1968, and 1970 combined. Plaintiffs' exhibit 71 reflects also that in 1969 
Langenderfer was awarded bids on three ODOT and OTC contracts totalling only $ 237,168. It is not possible, therefore, that 
Langenderfer's profits for 1969 came from ODOT and OTC work. (In 1968, the successful bid awards for Langenderfer were $ 
380,063; thus, this data reflects that ODOT and OTC contracts could not have carried over as a substantial part of a profit 
source in 1969.) We are, therefore, inclined to regard this 1969 figure as a less-than-reliable basis for claiming average profits by 
Langenderfer. The basis for any substantial profit in 1969 must have been from non-ODOT/OTC work."
1527,29," The figures in parentheses reflect defendants' combined ODOT/OTC market share. Plaintiffs' exhibit 71; Langenderfer I, 729 
F.2d at 1054 n.6. "
1528,30," Burton MacRitchie conceded than the amount of work available to paving contractors in northwest Ohio dropped by more than 
half during the early 1970s; it provided ""fewer opportunities to bid."" Langenderfer began losing money at the same time in 1971. "
1530,31," The second method, unlike the first, eliminated bids made by Langenderfer on jobs in which concededly Langenderfer did not 
recover its fixed costs."
1530,32," This third method involved calculation of Langenderfer's ""revenues on ODOT and turnpike projects for the work it performed 
during the period 1973 through 1977"" based on ""an analysis of what it would have had on those bids had it been able to bid at 
the levels being bid in the remainder of the state."" We consider this method to be unsupported by the proof and highly 
conjectural."
1530,33," For the last two years in question, 1986 and 1987, plaintiffs discounted their claimed damages by 17.03 percent annually. 
Plaintiffs' exhibit 150. We have applied the same discount to the newly calculated damage figure. For 1986, this comes to $ 
24,931; for 1987, $ 21,303. "
1532,34," Langenderfer I held that the order of the district court which did not include divestiture, provided ""no ground for assignment of 
error."" "
