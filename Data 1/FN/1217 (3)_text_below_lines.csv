24,1," Although the parent was originally named as a defendant, it was agreed at trial that plaintiffs would proceed solely against 
MBNA."
24,2," For details regarding certification of the class, see Link v. Mercedes-Benz of North America, Inc., Daimler-Benz A.G., 1975-2 
Trade Cas.  (CCH) P60,534 (E.D. Pa. 1975), appeal dismissed, 550 F.2d 860 (3d Cir. 1977). "
25,3," In a prior order filed April 30, 1984, and opinion and order filed May 29, 1984, I granted summary judgment for defendant on 
plaintiffs' claim of overcharges in the sale of parts, based on Illinois Brick Co. v. State of Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707, 
97 S. Ct. 2061 (1977). I also noted that plaintiffs who purchased parts from franchisee dealers could continue to seek injunctive 
relief under section 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 26 (1983). See Mid-West Paper Products Co. v. Continental Group, Inc., 
596 F.2d 573, 590-94 (3d Cir. 1979). Plaintiffs' claims in this regard are discussed later in this opinion."
25,4," The jury answered ""no"" to the following interrogatory:"
25,1," . (a) Have the plaintiffs proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Mercedes-Benz of North America, Inc., acted (not 
individually but in a concerted way) with one or more of its dealers by contracting, combining or conspiring with a conscious 
commitment to a common scheme to fix and raise the labor charges for non-warranty repair work?"
25,5," Plaintiffs have also moved to set a hearing date on their motions for sanctions. This request is denied and the motions 
dismissed. The trial was structured to provide both sides with ample opportunity for discovery.  I believe that defendant made 
every reasonable effort to produce documents in its possession and otherwise cooperate in discovery matters. Because I find no 
conduct by defendant that warrants the imposition of sanctions, there is no basis for further consideration of these motions. "
27,6," Plaintiffs asked that a full evidentiary hearing be held on the juror contact issue. I denied this request by an order dated 
November 15, 1984. I feel that such a hearing is neither compelled by the case law in this area nor warranted by the 
circumstances of this case. In my view, the actions taken to investigate the alleged juror contact were adequate to protect the 
rights of the parties and insure the fairness of the trial. Plaintiffs contend that under Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 209, 71 L. Ed. 2d 
78, 102 S. Ct. 940 (1982), the court was required to hold a full evidentiary hearing at which counsel would have the opportunity 
to cross-examine witnesses.  While this may be the appropriate course to take in criminal cases involving clearly improper juror 
contacts or serious questions of juror bias, I do not feel that a hearing of this type is mandated in a civil action where no improper 
contact has been shown. See, e.g., Standard Alliance Industries v. Black Clawson Co., 587 F.2d 813, 828 (6th Cir. 1978), cert. 
denied, 441 U.S. 923, 60 L. Ed. 2d 396, 99 S. Ct. 2032 (1979) (""The correct response of a trial judge, when confronted with 
allegations of improper jury contact, is to give notice to the parties and to question the jurors on the record about any alleged 
incident.""). "
28,7," Of particular relevance is paragraph 7 of the order which states: The issues in the ""conspiracy"" phase of the trial will be the following: (a) Are Mercedes-Benz dealers bound by contract to use Mercedes-Benz Service Management Controls, and if so, which 
dealers are so bound. Does a requirement that Service Management Controls are to be used necessarily mean that 
Mercedes-Benz Labor Time Guide values will be followed. (b) Did Mercedes-Benz combine with some or all of its dealers to set the labor times in the various Mercedes-Benz Labor 
Time Guides to be used for nonwarranty repairs by the combining dealers, and/or, did Mercedes-Benz combine with some 
or all of its dealers to promulgate and use Mercedes-Benz Labor Time Guides and thereby fix prices dealer-wide for 
nonwarranty repairs. (c) Did Mercedes-Benz combine with some or all of its dealers to fix or peg the customer labor rate charged by those 
dealers on nonwarranty repairs. "
31,8," Specifically, plaintiffs also contend that the court erred in its charge by (1) setting out an unwarranted distinction between 
horizontal and vertical price-fixing; (2) instructing the jury that they could not infer an agreement from the advocacy by MBNA of 
certain business practices and the subsequent statement by a dealer that it intended to follow such advice, where the dealer's 
decision was independent; (3) referring to defendant's argument that plaintiffs put on no witnesses who could show that the time 
guides were inflated; (4) stating that MBNA could recommend the use of an inflated guide if its dealers then agreed to use it 
independently; (5) telling the jury that it must determine whether each dealer had individually conspired with Mercedes. "
34,9," Specifically, plaintiffs contend that the court erred by: (1) separating the trial of labor and parts issues, granting summary 
judgment on parts damages claims, and excluding from trial evidence concerning parts; (2) deferring a decision on plaintiffs' 
motions for sanctions; (3) requiring the jury to find conspiracy on a ""dealer by dealer"" basis; (4) unreasonably constricting 
plaintiffs' rebuttal case; (5) excluding evidence of MBNA dealers' profitability and refusing to permit cross-examination of dealer 
witnesses on this subject; (6) excluding evidence of concerted action between MBNA and its dealers in April and May, 1985; (7) 
refusing to permit plaintiffs to cross-examine dealer witnesses on their knowledge of Hollywood Service Management controls; 
(8) refusing to require the production of documents from zone offices and failing to investigate allegations of document 
destruction at zone offices; (9) commenting that certain of plaintiffs' evidence was not germane; (10) permitting defense 
witnesses to testify to hearsay matters; (11) refusing to admit evidence of the profitability of MBNA franchises; (12) admitting 
Exhibit D-268, a summary prepared by MBNA during the course of litigation; (13) unfairly restricting plaintiffs' use of expert 
testimony; (14) excluding Exhibit P-203 relating to the use of Service Management Controls. "
35,10," Plaintiffs incorrectly state that the only issue submitted to the jury was whether the time guide was inflated. In fact, the issue 
submitted to the jury was whether MBNA and its dealers conspired to fix and raise the price of labor charges for nonwarranty 
repairs. The jury determined that no such violation occurred. Plaintiffs' assertion that the jury considered only the inflation issue 
is apparently based on information gained from post-verdict juror interviews. Such testimony may not be used to call into 
question the clear language of the verdict in an effort to restrict its effect."
35,11," HN8[
] Even if plaintiffs are unable to prove that concerted activity has resulted in legally cognizable damages, they may still 
be entitled to injunctive relief. McLain v. Real Estate Board of New Orleans, 444 U.S. 232, 243, 62 L. Ed. 2d 441, 100 S. Ct. 502 
(1980). In the injunction context, once a determination has been made that the defendant has violated the antitrust laws, a 
plaintiff need only demonstrate a ""threatened loss or damage"" growing out of a violation. Thus, injunctive relief may be available 
though plaintiff has not yet suffered or proved actual injury.  Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U.S. 100, 130, 
23 L. Ed. 2d 129, 89 S. Ct. 1562 (1969). The purpose of giving private parties treble-damage and injunctive remedies was not 
merely to provide private relief, but was also to serve the purpose of enforcing the antitrust laws. Id.  Section 16 should be 
construed and applied with this purpose in mind. Id. "
36,12," The doctrine of collateral estoppel is not implicated here since no issues were actually litigated. See Lawlor v. National Screen 
Service Corp., 349 U.S. 322, 326, 99 L. Ed. 1122, 75 S. Ct. 865 (1955)."
36,13," I also reject defendant's contention that plaintiffs have waived their claim for injunctive relief relating to parts. In the April 30, 
1984, order, the court set for trial only issues relating to the pricing of labor charges for nonwarranty repairs. That order also 
instructed the parties that plaintiffs could continue to seek parts injunctive relief. No time frame was suggested for seeking such 
relief. While the court was under the impression, perhaps mistaken, that plaintiffs were not going to pursue their claim for 
injunctive relief, now that they have indicated their interest in doing so, the opportunity will be open to them. "

live. (Tr. 1090-1091) "
48,," Government exhibit (""GX"") 343 indicates for each bank in Benzie, Leelanau, Grand Traverse, Antrim and Manistee counties the 
number of accounts held by customers residing in each zip code within those five counties. In addition to the number of accounts

amount, the percentage of each bank's total accounts (by dollar amount), and the average size of accounts held by residents 
within each zip code in the five-county area. This data was compiled for savings and loan institutions as well as banks in the five-county area, and serves as underlying data 
for many of the documents admitted into evidence reflecting account information introduced by both parties. The Court notes 
that the zip code data was compiled using bank and savings and loan records as of 1982. There are 37 zip codes in the five-county area. The Court notes that a fraction of the accounts in the banks did not live in the 
five-county area, or did not have their address on file with their financial institution. (See Horvitz, Tr. 1094-1096.) These accounts 
are identified in GX343 by zip code ""99999,"" and were not of consequence to the parties in this case."
48,20," This figure is derived from adding the total loans and total deposits held in Traverse City by Benzie residents (Defendant's

area. There is no basis given as to this conclusion, other than that "". . . the markets listed herein represent the product of an 
amalgamation of various techniques adopted across hundreds of cases during more than a quarter of a century."" Id., at p. vii. Noting that several cases have adopted the findings of federal agencies on this point where appropriate, see, e.g.  Phillipsburg 
National Bank, supra, 399 U.S. at 364, 90 S. Ct. 2035; Philadelphia National Bank, supra 374 U.S. at 361, 83 S. Ct. at 1740, this

60,86," Although the commercial realities may differ greatly from region to region, regardless of its size, the residents of rural Benzie 
County do not appear, based on their level of interchange with Grand Traverse, to be deterred by the driving distance of 35-40 
miles. In passing on a merger between banks located in Powell and Cody, Wyoming, the Tenth Circuit stated, ""'The factor of 
inconvenience localizes banking competition as effectively as high transportation costs in other industries.' (citations omitted) 
However, what may be inconvenient to a bank customer in an urban area, who has many alternatives for banking and other 
services in the immediate vicinity, may not be inconvenient to a customer in a small, rural town who is accustomed to traveling 
long distances to obtain basic services."" Wyoming Bancorporation v. Federal Reserve Board, 729 F.2d 687, 690 (10th Cir. 
1984). The present case bears this out. The extent to which banking is localized is not absolute, but is dependent on the characteristics 
of each region. "
61,87," This figure was compiled by the court, using defendant's exhibit DDD (Grand Traverse and Benzie market shares), but 
subtracting the deposits held by savings and loans. The total deposits in this two county market for commercial banking is $

76,4," There was also a split of authority among the circuits. See, e.g., Sams v. Ohio Valley Gen'l. Hosp. Ass'n., 413 F.2d 826 (4th 
Cir. 1969) (receipt of Hill-Burton funds meant hospital acted under color of state law); Simkins v. Moses H. Cone Mem. Hosp., 
323 F.2d 959 (4th Cir. 1963) (same); Doe v. Bellin Mem. Hosp., 479 F.2d 756 (7th Cir. 1973) (receipt of Hill-Burton funds did not 
mean hospital's actions and policies carried out under color of state law); Barrett v. United Hosp., 376 F. Supp. 791 (S.D.N.Y. 
1974) (same). The decision in Simkins and the cases following it relied on Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, supra, where the Supreme 
Court held that racial discrimination by a restaurant that leased premises in a municipally owned and operated parking garage 
was state action for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Burton court found that, considering the totality of the 
circumstances, including the mutual benefits conferred and received and the fact that the restaurant was located in a public 
building operated by the city for a public purpose, the state had so far insinuated itself into the operations of the restaurant as to 
become a joint participant in its discriminatory practices.  Id. 365 U.S. at 725. It was not until Moose Lodge and Jackson, 
however, that the Supreme Court considered the question of whether state regulation of a private activity confers upon it the 
status of state action, a question more directly relevant to the activities of private hospitals than the issue considered in Burton. "
77,5," In the wake of Jackson, the Fourth Circuit has also decided not to follow its earlier cases holding that receipt of Hill-Burton 
funds brings private hospitals within the ambit of the state action requirement. See Modaber v. Culpeper Mem. Hosp., Inc., 674 
F.2d 1023, 1025-26 (4th Cir. 1982) (holding earlier cases inconsistent with Jackson)."
77,6," Although Dr. Quinn has not referred to a specific subsection of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1985, the circumstances alleged in his complaint 
make it clear that only section 1985(3) would be appropriate.  HN14[
]  42 U.S.C. ยง 1985(3) reads, in relevant part: ""If two or more persons in any State or Territory conspire to go in disguise on the highway or on the premises of another, for 
the purpose of depriving, either directly or indirectly, any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws, or of 
equal privileges and immunities under the laws; . . . in any case of conspiracy set forth in this section, if one or more

78,," States, the party so injured or deprived may have an action for the recovery of damages occasioned by such injury or 
deprivation, against any one or more of the conspirators."""
78,7," Griffin involved a group of Negroes who were driving in their car when they were stopped by a group of whites, who mistook

two constitutionally protected rights that did not implicate state action: the right to interstate travel and the right of Negro citizens 
under the Thirteenth Amendment to have the same rights the law secures to all free men. "
80,8," The district court in Marrese had found that there was no state action sufficient to sustain Marrese's civil rights claim under 42 
U.S.C. ยง 1983, and, for reasons that are not clear, Marrese did not appeal this aspect of the district court's decision. "
81,9," Cf. P. Areeda, Antitrust Law para. 212.3 (Supp. 1982) HN20[
] (""A policy to displace the antitrust laws will . . . be found if the 
challenged restraint of competition is a necessary consequence of engaging in the authorized activity."")."
81,10," In Marrese the court was greatly concerned that denial of an antitrust exemption would frustrate the policy of the peer review 
statute by making physicians reluctant to serve on peer review committees. The Court finds this concern misplaced, since the 
relevant inquiry is not whether the exemption would foster the purpose of the statute but whether restriction of competition is a 
necessary consequence of engaging in the activity promoted by the statute. In most instances, these two conditions would 
probably converge, but in the case of peer review statutes it appears that they may not. "
82,11," The defendants also argue that, independent of the availability of a state action exemption under Parker, they are entitled to a 
presumption of good faith immunity under the Delaware peer review statute. It is elementary, however, that HN23[

absence of state action or express federal statutory exemption federal antitrust law will preempt state law to the extent that the 
latter conflicts with it. ""A conflict will be found . . .  where the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and

83,13," The defendants' conduct in opposing the application of Dr. Quinn's medical group for a zoning variance to erect a sign 
advertising the availability of ambulatory surgery at the group's clinic, which is adjacent to the Hospital, is not relevant to the 
Noerr-Pennington issue. Dr. Quinn does not challenge the defendants' right to oppose his application for a variance, but merely 
cites their opposition as evidence of the competitive relationship between himself and the defendants."

] Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 1, proscribes ""every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States . . ."". Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 
U.S.C. ยง 2, makes it a felony to ""monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or 
persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States . . ."". Dr. Quinn's complaint alleges 
violations of both section 1 and section 2. The section 2 allegation maintains that ""the defendants entered into a contract, 
combination or conspiracy to unlawfully prevent plaintiff from obtaining Active Staff privileges at Kent General Hospital, thereby 
preventing him from providing services to prospective patients in the Dover area in violation of ยง 2 of the Sherman Act (15 
U.S.C. ยง 2)."" "
84,15," The defendants have pointed out that none of the individual physician defendants practices in the same specialty as Dr. 
Quinn, orthopedic surgery."
84,16," The reasons for the Third Circuit's holding are not entirely clear.  The court stated that the medical staff was empowered to 
make staff privilege decisions on behalf of the hospital and, with respect to these decisions, operated as an officer of a 
corporation would in relation to the corporation, but the court also recognized that the members of the medical staff had 
independent economic interests of their own. The court appeared to place weight on the fact that the medical staff had no 
interest in competition with the hospital, but this is puzzling, since economic actors may combine for purposes of section 1 of the 
Sherman Act even if they are not competitors, as in the various vertical arrangements that are subject to proscription under 
section 1."

117,10," The FTC does not argue that its interpretation of section 7A(h) should be given significance on other grounds, such as agency

address the issue."
117,11, We do not mean to suggest that Congress could not delegate dual lawmaking authority.
117,12," We pause to note that appellees never sought the Texaco/Getty premerger information as part of an ""administrative . . . action 
or proceeding,"" namely the FTC's consent judgment proceeding, even though the state officials sought to comment on the 
merger. The FTC, however, did address this exception to ยง 7A(h)'s disclosure prohibition in General Motors Corp., 3Trade Reg. 
Rep. (CCH) P 22,118 (1984), where Chrysler Corp. sought FTC materials about the then proposed consent order covering a "
118,," joint venture between General Motors Corp. and Toyota Motors Corp. The Commission in a three-to-two vote suggested that ยง 
7A(h) itself did not bar disclosure of premerger information to allow Chrysler to comment on the GM/Toyota consent order 
proceeding. Id. at 22,844. Nevertheless, the Commission indicated that ยง 6(f) barred such disclosure, id., a conclusion that 
appears to conflict with the FTC's position that ยง 6(f) does not authorize disclosure of H-S-R information, though we need not 
address the issue, see infra, slip op. at note 17. Appellees argue that General Motors conflicts with the FTC's decision below. General Motors concerned the ""proceedings"" 
exception in ยง 7A(h), and we cannot agree that it conflicts with the Commission's position that ยง 7A(h) precludes disclosure."
118,13," Some of the legislative history cited by the Commission is ambiguous at best. For example, Senator Abourezsk was asked 
what information would be precluded under section 4F(b), see supra note 9, and responded: The section specifically limits the Attorney General's power to release documents to whatever his powers are under existing 
law. Under existing law, he cannot turn over materials given in response to a grand jury demand or to a civil investigative 
demand. Therefore, the section is limited by existing law to cases where materials were turned over voluntarily. This section 
is in the bill, because it was requested by members of the House conferees, who had met on this."
118,122," Cong. Rec. 29,160 (1976) (emphasis added). The statement is not very illuminating. On the one hand, it indicates that only 
information turned over voluntarily -- which presumably does not include premerger information -- can be disclosed under 
section 4F(b). On the other hand, Senator Abourezsk did not mention premerger information when describing those materials 
that cannot be turned over."
118,14," For example, Senator Hruska introduced an amendment -- identical to what ultimately became section 7A(h) -- to the Senate 
version of the bill, which authorized disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, but in explaining it only mentioned 
confidentiality: The proposed addition . . . requires the Federal Trade Commission and the Assistant Attorney General to keep notification 
information confidential, except that appropriate congressional inquiry is permitted. The confidentiality provision will insure 
that respondents are not prejudiced by submitted confidential information concerning a proposed merger or acquisition."
118,122," Cong. Rec. 15,812 (1976). Whether or not premerger information could be disclosed on a confidential basis to state officials, 
the information could not be disclosed under FOIA; Congress made that intention crystal clear. "
119,15," Statutory interpretation, it has been suggested, is as much the application of a relatively stable way of thinking about how 
language should be read as it is the discovery of what Congress actually intended the language to mean. Cf. Posner, Statutory

interpretation as ""imaginative reconstruction""). "
120,16," Even if we were convinced that section 7A(h)'s ""public"" should be given the same meaning as section 6(f)'s ""public,"" which we 
are not, we could of course disagree with the Interco court's interpretation of the term. We need not, however, pass on this point. In light of our interpretation of ยง 7A(h), we also need not address whether ยง 6(f) provides authority for the disclosure of 
premerger information, even though it refers only to ""information obtained by [the FTC] hereunder."" But we note that we cannot 
agree with the district court's construction of ยง 4F(b). Of course, if the court were right that ยง 7A(h) permitted disclosure it would 
be another matter. Any decision that it was right, however, would have to come from a higher authority than our own. "

137,22," Unlike the complaints in the instant cases, those of AGC neglected to specify the nature of plaintiffs' alleged harm. The Court 
therefore was required to speculate in a footnote about the likely injury suffered by the unions. Importantly for the purposes of 
my analysis of the instant complaints, however, the Court stated that such union harms as losses in dues receipts or diminished 
opportunities to organize previously nonunion firms are remote and indirect, flowing out of the harm suffered by unionized 
subcontractors and the resultant losses suffered by union members. Essentially engaged in a ""proximate cause"" analysis, the 
Court wrote: Because of the absence of specific allegations, we can only speculate about the specific components of the Union's claim. 
If the Union asserts that its attempts to organize previously nonunion firms have been frustrated because nonunion firms 
wish to continue to obtain business from those subjected to coercion by the defendants, its harm stems most directly from 
the conduct of persons who are not victims of the conspiracy (cite omitted). If the Union claims that dues payments were 
adversely affected because employees had less incentive to join the Union in light of expanding nonunion job opportunities, 
its damage is more remote than the harm allegedly suffered by unionized subcontractors. The same is true if the Union 
contends that revenues for dues payments declined because its members lost jobs or wages because their unionized 
employers lost business.  That harm, moreover, is even more indirect than the already indirect injury to its members, yet a 
number of decisions have denied standing to employees with merely derivative injuries."

explanations supporting this allegation are provided."
141,53," Local 959's complaint alleges at least fifteen separate means by which competition in the market for truck transportation

141,54," Plaintiffs' Third Supplemental Memorandum in Opposition to the Oil Companies' Motion to Dismiss, like plaintiffs' amended 
complaint, merely sets forth the conclusion that ""the actions taken against Union-affiliated trucking companies directly affected 
the market for labor services in North Slope trucking."" See PTOB, supra at 5. Explanation of how this occurred is not provided 
here or in Local 959's other briefing."
141,55," This is certainly not to suggest, however, that such coercive activities engaged in by the oil companies to ""union bust"" would 
not contravene federal labor laws. Such a claim is not part of this litigation, however."
141,56," In noting that the amended complaint in AGC did not allege any restraint on competition in the market for labor union services, 
the Supreme Court further stated that ""there is no claim that competition between rival unions has been injured or even that any 
rival unions exist."" See AGC, supra at 527 note 14. By thus framing its discussion of ""the market for labor union services,"" the 
Court implied that the state of competition amongst more than one union rather than of unionization generally might be the 
relevant inquiry here. "

142,65," It is true that Local 959 heeded the statement of the Court in AGC by adding to its complaint allegations that (1) the aggregate 
share of the contracting market controlled by union firms has diminished; (2) the number of employed union members has "
143,," declined; (3) the union's revenues in the form of dues or initiation fees has decreased; and (4) union affiliated firms have been 
subject to a complete boycott. See Complaint paras. 22-32. In AGC, the Court noted that the absence of these allegations was 
further evidence of the speculative nature of the unions' damage claims.  The Court did not state, however, that the mere 
inclusion of these allegations in a similar complaint would necessarily mitigate the speculative nature of damage claims 
surrounding such alleged antitrust conspiracies. For the reasons noted, I have found Local 959's damage claims highly 
speculative due to their indirectness and the presence of an ascertainable class of more directly affected ""victims"" of the oil 
companies' alleged conspiracy."

166,2," Given the inadequacy of the RICO allegations, the Court need not consider whether this RICO action is time barred by the

166,3," In this context the holding of In Re Investors Funding Corp., etc., 523 F. Supp. 533, 544 (S.D.N.Y. 1980), upon which this Court 
relied to dismiss Beagan's claim pursuant to N.Y.Gen.Bus.Law ยง 352-c (blue sky statute), has been implicitly approved. See 
Bloor, supra, 754 F.2d at 60 n. 2. "
169,1," In the Beagan action, the Court observed that, ""The fraudulent scheme alleged in the complaint consists of a plot to plunge Teltronics into bankruptcy. [Complaint] para. 
120. Assuming the success of the plot as alleged in the complaint, the separation of Beagan or any other Teltronics' 
shareholder from their shares was hardly integral to bankrupting the corporation. Moreover the asserted misrepresentation 
contained in a press release, was that Teltronics had defaulted on loans from Nordic and Citibank. Although the default 
may have been excused, or Teltronics may have had a defense to a suit by the banks [or their successors in interest to the 
debt instruments], it nevertheless defaulted when it failed to make the interest payment on time. Beagan also cites an 
omission in that the press release failed to state that Teltronics had adequate assets to pay the loans. The availability of 
money would not preclude a default, and in these circumstances, the asserted solvency of Teltronics is irrelevant to the 
fraud alleged to have precipitated its rapid demise. That fraud was defendants' alleged promise to make the interest 
payments if Teltronics did not do so. Teltronics' possible State law claim for commonlaw fraud arising from this deceit has 
been settled.  The attenuation between this misrepresentation and the securities involved in any subsequent sale, forced or 
otherwise, is apparent from the pleaded facts."""
169,587, F. Supp. at 731-32. The instant complaint alleges the same facts and merits the same response.
169,2," For reasons which escape the Court (and defy logic), plaintiffs persist in attempting to persuade the Court that Wilson v. 
Garcia, 471 U.S. 261, 105 S. Ct. 1938, 85 L. Ed. 2d 254 (1985), undercuts the Court's earlier analysis, 587 F. Supp. at 733, and 
presumably the analysis of Durante Brothers, etc. v. Flushing Nat. Bank, 755 F.2d 239, 248-49 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 473 U.S. 
906, 105 S. Ct. 3530, 87 L. Ed. 2d 654 (1985), concerning the appropriate New York statute of limitations for a civil RICO suit. 
The RICO claim in this case was dismissed upon deficiencies in the merits and not upon any defense of the statute of 
limitations. "
170,3," As Teltronics has settled all of its claims against Ericsson as part of a bankruptcy, there is no possibility of a shareholders' 
derivative RICO suit. "
172,4," Contrary to plaintiffs' attorneys' assertions, this Court never encouraged them to take an appeal on behalf of Teltronics."
172,5," The prior proceedings concerning Teltronics in this Court and the Court of Appeals put plaintiffs' attorneys on notice that this 
action was so completely without hope of succeeding that pursuing the matter in this Court, beyond placing the case in an 
appellate posture, was vexatious to the defendants and indicative of bad faith. See Glick v. Koenig, 766 F.2d 265, 270 (7th Cir. 
1985)."
172,6," Plaintiffs' attorneys submitted their opposition papers (dated July 1, 1985) on July 5, 1985. Apparently, the references to 
Datasaab were intended to satisfy the RICO requirement of prior criminal convictions, as set out in Sedima S.P.R.L. v. Imrex, 
Inc., 741 F.2d 482 (2d Cir. 1984). Although this requirement was rejected by the Supreme Court in that case on July 1, 1985, 
473 U.S. 479, 105 S. Ct. 3275, 87 L. Ed. 2d 346 in their subsequent papers, plaintiffs' attorneys have not withdrawn their 
references to exhibits related to Datasaab. The record discloses that Datasaab's activities have no legal or factual impact upon 
Ericsson's relationship(s) with Teltronics or these plaintiffs. "
173,7," Not only are the claims the same as were raised in the Beagan action, but many of the affidavits and documents submitted by 
plaintiffs' attorneys are the same, viz., Plaintiffs' Exhs. D, E, F, H, and K (including Exhs. N and O to Exh. K). "
178,1, It is therefore unnecessary to reach the issue of forum non conveniens.
178,2," Buckeye not only failed to respond to the defendants' memorandum and affidavits, it resisted the defendants' discovery efforts 
relating to this jurisdictional issue. On April 13, 1985, the defendants served notices for taking the depositions of Buckeye's 
president and a designated officer of Buckeye pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6). The depositions were scheduled for April 24, 
1985 and were limited solely to the issue of personal jurisdiction. In response to these deposition notices, Buckeye moved for a 
protective order vacating the notices on the grounds that ""justice requires protection of its officers from oppression and undue 
burden and expense"" and that ""the plaintiff is located out of state and its officers have busy schedules."""
178,3," In Chlebda, the defendant moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and supported its motion with an affidavit indicating 
a lack of contacts with the forum. The plaintiff filed a memorandum in opposition to the motion but filed no counter-affidavits. 
After the motion to dismiss was granted, the plaintiff argued on appeal that the allegations in her complaint must be accepted as 
proven for purposes of resolving the issue of personal jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals characterized this argument as an 
""elementary mistake."" In affirming the district court's dismissal of the complaint, the Court held that the plaintiff must go beyond 
to pleadings to establish personal jurisdiction. 609 F.2d at 1024; see Geist v. Martin, 675 F.2d 859, 862 (7th Cir. 1982); Weller v. 
Cromwell Oil Co., 504 F.2d 927, 929-30 (6th Cir. 1974) (""Where a motion [to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction] is filed, 
supported by affidavits, the non-moving party may not rest upon allegations or denials in his pleadings but his response by 
affidavit or otherwise must set forth specific facts showing that the court has jurisdiction."")"
178,4," This focus is consistent with the complaint, which asserts that ""venue is proper in this district pursuant to both s. 12 of the 
Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C., s. 22, and 28 U.S.C., s. 1391 since the claim asserted herein arose in this district because the defendant 
committed tortious acts in this district, and because the defendants transact and do business within the district."" Complaint para. 
3. "
179,5," Personal jurisdiction in federal question cases is a matter of federal law, to be governed by the due process standards of the 
Fifth Amendment rather than the Fourteenth Amendment.  Stanley Works v. Globemaster, Inc., 400 F. Supp. 1325, 1334 n.13 
(D. Mass. 1975). As a general proposition, the Fifth Amendment would permit a federal court to exercise personal jurisdiction 
over a defendant in a federal question case by looking to the defendant's aggregate contacts with the United States as a whole, 
without regard to the defendant's contacts with the forum state. See, e.g., Holt v. Klosters Rederi A/S, 355 F. Supp. 354, 356-
57 (W.D. Mich. 1973). Courts have differed as to whether there must be a clear manifestation of Congressional intent before a district court can use 
such an ""aggregate contacts"" test in all federal antitrust cases. Compare Superior Coal Co.  v. Ruhrkohle, A.G., 83 F.R.D. 414 
(E.D. Pa. 1979) with Centronics Data Computer Corp. v. Mannesmann, A.G., 432 F. Supp. 659 (D.N.H. 1977). The better rule is 
there must be specific statutory authority. That is, to obtain service and personal jurisdiction on the basis of the defendant's 
aggregate contacts with the nation as a whole, there must be a federal statute authorizing such action.  Superior Coal Co., supra 
at 418; see generally Hovenkamp, Personal Jurisdiction and Venue in Private Antitrust Actions in the Federal Courts: A Policy 
Analysis, 67 Iowa L. Rev. 485, 498-502 (1982). If there is no such federal statute, the federal court must then look to the long 
arm provisions of the forum state to obtain personal jurisdiction, even in federal question cases. "
180,6," There is a split of authority as to whether the appropriate time for analyzing facts relating to venue under the ""transacting 
business"" clause is the time the suit was commenced or the time the cause of action accrued. Compare Agra Chem. Distrib. Co. 
v. Marion Laboratories, Inc., 523 F. Supp. 699 (W.D.N.Y. 1981) with Board of County Commissioners v. Wilshire Oil Co., 523 
F.2d 125 (10th Cir. 1975). Because there is nothing in this record to suggest that there was any change in either of the 
defendants' contacts with Massachusetts between the time the cause of action accrued in 1984 and the time suit was 
commenced in 1985, the analysis focuses on the events of 1984. "
181,7," This fact, by itself, is not compelling. If a defendant makes substantial sales on a continuous basis within a forum district, he 
cannot escape jurisdiction and venue in that district simply by requiring shipments to be made F.O.B. outside the forum. See 
State of Illinois v. Harper & Row Publishers, Inc., 308 F. Supp. 1207, 1209 n.7 (N.D. Ill, 1969). However, it is one factor to be 
considered in analyzing a defendant's manner of doing business."
181,8," Even where there is a federal statute, such as Section 12, providing for worldwide service of process in a federal question 
case, the plaintiff has the option of relying on the forum state's long arm statute for asserting personal jurisdiction over the 
defendant. Although some courts have indicated that ""the requirements of state long arm statutes are simply irrelevant to the in 
personam jurisdiction of a federal court,"" Sportmart, Inc. v. Frisch, 537 F. Supp. 1254, 1257 (N.D. Ill. 1982), the Federal Rules of 
Civil Procedure clearly permit the plaintiff to look to the applicable state long arm statute. Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(c)(2)(C)(i); Advisory 
Committee Notes to the 1963 Amendments to Rule 4. Thus, Buckeye could rely on the Massachusetts long arm statute for 
asserting personal jurisdiction even on its federal antitrust claims. See Black v. Acme Markets, Inc., 564 F.2d 681, 684 (5th Cir. 
1977). "
182,9," The defendants note in their brief that Buckeye might also seek to invoke Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223, ยง 38 in an attempt to 
establish personal jurisdiction over the defendants. The plaintiff has failed to mention this or any other statute as the basis for 
personal jurisdiction. Section 38 of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223 has not been supplanted by the long arm statute and therefore 
remains an independently viable basis for asserting jurisdiction over a foreign corporation.  Campbell v. Frontier Fishing & 
Hunting, Ltd., 10 Mass. App. Ct. 53, 405 N.E.2d 989 (1980). Section 38 permits service of process on a foreign corporation 
which ""is engaged in or soliciting business in the commonwealth, permanently or temporarily."" This statute may be invoked ""only 
if a foreign Corporation's activities affected Massachusetts commerce substantially or so affected the transaction at issue as to 
make Massachusetts an appropriate forum."" Mas Marques v. Digital Equipment Corp., 637 F.2d 24, 28 (1st Cir. 1980). For the 
reasons set forth elsewhere in this opinion, the Court rules that Section 38 does not support the exercise of jurisdiction over the 
defendants. "
183,10," Shipments F.O.B. do not, standing alone, give rise to jurisdiction under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223A, ยง 3(b) as they do not 
constitute contracts ""to supply services or things in this commonwealth."" Droukas v. Divers Training Academy, Inc., 375 Mass. 
149, 157-160, 376 N.E.2d 548 (1978). Here, there is no evidence that Buckeye ever contracted with Fila USA for the delivery of 
goods or services whatsoever. As for Fila Italy, the contract appended to the complaint makes no reference to Massachusetts, 
and Buckeye has provided no factual support for its contention that certain of the Fila merchandise mentioned in the contract 
was slated for sale in Massachusetts. "

that the subsidiary was treated as a profit center or division rather than as a separate corporation. In O'Byrne v. Cheker Oil Co., 
727 F.2d 159 (7th Cir. 1984), the Seventh Circuit, citing Security Tire, held that there was no violation because there was no sale 
from seller to seller-owned stations. Prior to Security Tire, the Ninth Circuit held in Brown v. Hansen Publications, Inc., 556 F.2d 
969 (9th Cir. 1977), that a transfer between sibling corporations was not a ""sale"" for Robinson-Patman Act purposes because 
the siblings were operated as a single integrated enterprise. The limited number of opinions expressed by commentators on this question have been mixed. See III E. Kintner & J. Bauer, 
Federal Antitrust Law ยง 21.15 (1983) (""If the subsidiary really is an independent, profit-making center, with an ability to make its 
own pricing and resale decisions, and if goods indeed are sold to it, i.e., if title and risk of loss have passed, the likelihood of 
substantial injury to competition may be as great as with sales to a completely unrelated company.""); Comment, Application of 
the Robinson-Patman Act to Price Discrimination in Intra-Enterprise Transactions, 53 NW. U.L. Rev. 253 (1958). But see 
Adelman, Effective Competition and the Anti-Trust Laws, 61 Harv. L. Rev. 1289 (1948). "
230,3," We also do not consider dispositive the admission in an affidavit by a Marathon employee that ""Marathon sells gasoline to 
Emro."" Stubbins affidavit, Supplemental Joint Appendix 59, 60. "
231,1," The Supreme Court in Copperweld did not consider the applicability of its holding to the Robinson-Patman Act. The Fifth Circuit 
in Security Tire & Rubber Co. v. Gates, 598 F.2d 962, 965 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 942, 100 S. Ct. 298, 62 L. Ed. 2d 
309 (1979), expressly distinguished ""the rather remote question whether a partially-owned subsidiary corporation could conspire 
with its parent corporation in violation of the Sherman Act."" "
232,2," A purchaser may be held liable for violating ยง 2(f) of the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 13(f), if it knowingly induces or 
receives an unlawful price discrimination. "
235,1," The reasons set forth in this opinion for denying Texaco's JNOV motion are also intended to supplement the court's oral ruling 
denying defendant's motion for a directed verdict."
235,2," Some economists and commentators have distinguished between the terms ""functional discount"" and ""trade discount."" See 
Boise Cascade Corp., Docket No. 9133, slip op. at 99-100 (Feb. 14, 1984) (initial decision); Calvani, Functional Discounts Under 
The Robinson-Patman Act, 17 B.C.Indus.  & Comm.L.Rev. 543, 5454 n. 9 (1976). Technically, a ""functional discount"" disregards 
the buyer's level in the distribution scheme and rewards the buyer for actually performing functions which otherwise would be 
performed by the seller. A ""trade discount"", on the other hand, is given to a buyer based upon the buyer's level in the distribution 
scheme and is completely independent of the functions performed by the buyer. Thus, a ""trade discount"" should be available to 
all buyers who operate at the same trade level regardless of the actual functions performed and a ""functional discount"" should 
be available to any buyer -- regardless of its trade level -- who performs functions for the seller. Although defendant Texaco has 
not made this distinction, and it is questionable whether the distinction is of any legal importance, see Rill, Availability and 
Functional Discounts Justifying Discriminatory Pricing, 53 Antitrust L.J. 929, 936 (1985), the thrust of defendant's argument 
appears to fall within the parameters of functional discount in its more limited, technical sense, i.e. that Dompier and Gull were 
performing functions which Texaco would otherwise have performed."
235,3," The functional discount concept is distinguished from the cost justification defense, 15 U.S.C. ยง 13(a), in that the former 
focuses on the buyer's cost of performing the seller's functions and the latter is concerned with comparing the seller's costs of 
servicing one buyer versus the cost of servicing another buyer. Understandably, many commentators, including a chairman of 
the A.B.A.'s Robinson-Patman Act Committee of the Section of Antitrust Law, find it a ""confusing distinction."" Panel Discussion 
-- Questions and Answers, 53 Antitrust L.J. 967, 968 (1985) (comment by Bernat Rosner). "
236,4," Prior to 1974 Dompier Oil Co. did not operate any retail stations but, as a distributor, sold Texaco gasoline to retail stations. 
Beginning in 1974 Dompier did acquire retail outlets and eventually operated four Texaco retail stations. While there is a serious 
question as to whether Dompier was entitled to a ""functional discount"" on the gas it resold at retail, compare Mueller Co., 60 
F.T.C. 120 (1962), affd., 323 F.2d 44 (7th Cir.1963), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 923, 84 S. Ct. 1219, 12 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1964) 
(entitlement to functional discount based on resale level) with Doubleday and Co., 52 F.T.C. 169 (1955) (entitlement to functional 
discount based on level of purchase), the court assumes, arguendo, that the mere fact that Dompier retailed the gas does not 
preclude a ""functional discount."" See Boise Cascade Corp., Docket No. 9133 Feb. 14, 1984 (initial decision) (Administrative Law 
Judge urges adherence to Mueller rule)."
236,5," Although Texaco did introduce evidence that Dompier and to some extent Gull were performing marketing and advisory 
functions, the gasoline hauling function cannot be considered, at least to the extent it was compensated for by the hauling 
allowance, since the court excluded the hauling allowance from the price differential. "
237,6," The term ""Dompier-supplied retail stations"" includes any stations supplied by Dompier, including Dompier's own retail outlets. "
238,7," Although Texaco did put forth some evidence that its pricing practices in the early 1970's (particularly as regards Gull) were 
motivated by competition, scant evidence was produced that the ""competitive circumstances"" justified a continuation of the lower 
price in subsequent years. See Falls City Industries v. Vanco Beverage, Inc., 460 U.S. at 450, 103 S. Ct. at 1297. "
240,8," The fallacy of defendant's off-target argument is high-lighted in the following hypothetical: Jack's Texaco and Jenny's Texaco 
are competing Texaco gasoline retailers in Free Marketville, U.S.A. They both are supplied by Texaco's tanker truck and their 
product-purchase price is identical and provides Texaco with a better than average profit margin.  Being the only Texaco 
retailers in the market they have prospered and so has Texaco. Now, along come two new Texaco retailers into the market, 
Tom's Texaco and Terry's Texaco. They receive their gasoline in the same manner as Jake and Jenny, only Tom and Terry pay 
four cents per gallon more for their gas. Assuming that Tom and Terry eventually close their doors because they cannot "
241,," compete, that they are able to prove a violation of the Act, that Texaco has no statutory defenses and that the plaintiffs prove 
""antitrust injury,"" under Texaco's argument the only way to remedy the violation would be to increase Jake and Jenny's purchase 
price. Surely, Tom and Terry are not foreclosed from calculating their damages based on the estimated profits they would have 
experienced had the price differential been eliminated by lowering their purchase price."
241,9," In addition to the new-trial grounds discussed above, the defendant asserts other grounds. Besides restating its four JNOV 
grounds as grounds for a new trial, Texaco also argues it is entitled to a new trial due to erroneous instructions. As regards the 
erroneous instructions ground, Texaco's ""overcharge-undercharge,"" ""actual injury to competition"" and ""proximate cause"" 
arguments have been addressed. The defendant simply has not met either the JNOV standard or established adequate grounds 
for a new trial. "
258,1," On January 20, 1984, this Court entered an order granting NBL's motion for a preliminary injunction and consolidating the 
Trend action with the Nordic action. This order also granted Trend's motion for summary judgment on NBL's claims against five 
of the nine financial institutions named as defendants in NBL's first amended complaint. The actions against the four other 
banking defendants have since been disposed of. "
262,2," The complaint names at least two defendants on all but one count. The following chart, which counsel for some of the

265,3," We note in passing that the plaintiffs appear to have stated a claim under RICO as it has been interpreted recently by the 
Supreme Court. ""A violation of ยง 1962(c), the section on which [Trend] relies, requires (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) 
through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity."" Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 105 S. Ct. 3275, 3285, 87 L. Ed. 2d 
346 (1985) (footnote omitted). The complaint alleges at least five acts of ""racketeering activity."" See 18 U.S.C. ยง 1961 (1) (1982). 
""A pattern of racketeering activity"" is composed of two or more such acts. The definitions of ""conduct"" and ""enterprise"" appear to 
be satisfied as well. Id."
265,4," The plaintiffs' motion to dismiss the civil RICO claims without prejudice is also deemed withdrawn. The resuscitation of the 
RICO claims effectively disposes of the defendants' motion to dismiss the common law claims in the complaint for lack of subject "
266,," matter jurisdiction. This Court has pendent jurisdiction over those claims, which arise out of the same ""common nucleus of 
operative facts"" as the RICO claims.  United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 726, 86 S. Ct. 1130, 1139, 16 L. Ed. 2d 218 
(1966)."
266,5," Subsection (B) prohibits traditional tie-in arrangements. Subsections (C) and (D) prohibit reciprocal arrangements whereby a 
customer provides a bank with something of value in exchange for the bank's product or service.  Another subsection prohibits 
exclusive dealing arrangements.  12 U.S.C. ยง 1972(1)(E) (1982)."
266,6," Trend and Lease Trend brought their BHCA claim pursuant to section 1975 of that act which authorizes suits by ""any person 
injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in section 1972."" 12 U.S.C. ยง 1975 (1982)."
266,7," Apparently, at some point, Trend and Lease Trend were joint obligors on the Flourtown loans. Consequently, they are named 
jointly in those counts charging fraud and other improper conduct with respect to those loans. In the interest of simplicity and 
brevity, the Court will refer to Trend and Lease Trend jointly as ""Trend."" From time to time, the Court will also address them as 
the plaintiffs. "
267,8," Both parties buttressed their arguments on this motion with affirmations, affidavits, and other materials outside the pleadings.  
Consequently, we treat this as a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. "
269,9," The defendants do not discuss the traditional banking practices defense. Instead, they assert that the plaintiffs must establish 
an ""anti-competitive effect"" in order to state a claim under the BHCA's anti-tying provisions. This terminology is confusing. The 
term ""anti-competitive"" derives from the BHCA's legislative history, see S. Rep.  No. 1084, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 1, reprinted in, 
1970 U.S. Code Cong. & Ad.  news 5519, 5535 [hereinafter ""S. Rep.""] (""The purpose of the provision is to prohibit anti-
competitive practices . . . .""), and from opinions construing the BHCA, see, e.g., Rae v. Union Bank, 725 F.2d 478, 480 (9th Cir. 
1984) (""The plaintiff must show an anti-competitive tying arrangement.""). This language notwithstanding, the BHCA does not 
require a plaintiff to prove that the arrangement in question had an anti-competitive effect. Instead, the BHCA establishes a per 
se rule obviating the need for a specific inquiry into the anti-competitive effect of the prohibited tie.  Costner v. Blount National 
Bank, 578 F.2d 1192, 1194 (6th Cir. 1978); Parsons Steel, Inc. v. First Alabama Bank, 679 F.2d 242, 244-45 (11th Cir. 1982); 
Naegele, The Anti-Tying Provision: Its Potential Is Still There, 100 Banking L.J. 138, 143 (1983) (""In contrast to the general 
antitrust laws, Section 1972 imposes treble damage liability without a showing that the bank, bank holding company or its 
subsidiary has sufficient economic power in the market for the tying product to impose a tying arrangement.""). See also S. Rep. 
at 5558 (Supplementary Views of Edward W. Brooke). (""Tying arrangements involving a bank are made unlawful by [the BHCA] 
without any showing of specific adverse effects on competition or other restraints of trade and without any showing of some 
degree of bank dominance or control over the tying product or service."") "
270,10," The plaintiffs contend that these cases, which concern alleged violations of section 1972(1)(c), are inapposite because most 
of the claims herein arise under subsections (B) and (D). No doubt these subsections differ in effect. While (B) and (D) prohibit a 
bank from tying the extension of credit to property or services offered by a bank holding company or to a subsidiary of that 
company, subsection (C) prohibits a bank from tying two or more products or services together. However, except for one phrase 
in subsection (C) that permits banks to tie together certain products and services, the language of the three subsections is 
identical. Moreover, the same policies underlie each subsection. The cited cases are among the only authority construing 
section 1972(1) and are persuasive with regard to each of that section's subsections. "
271,11," Given the presence of affidavits and other matters outside of the pleadings, the Court treats this motion to dismiss as one for 
summary judgment. See supra note 8."
271,12," The plaintiffs cite Bass v. Boston Five Cent Savings Bank, 478 F. Supp. 741, 746-47 (D. Mass. 1979) and Stavrides v. Mellon 
National Bank & Trust Co., 353 F. Supp. 1072, 1076 (W.D. Pa.), aff'd, 487 F.2d 953 (3rd Cir. 1973), to support their contention 
that the tying and tied markets differ. Those cases refused to dismiss Sherman Act claims alleging that a bank improperly tied 
the procision of mortgage financing to the maintenance of an escrow account. The tying and tied products identified herein are 
hardly so distinct. "
272,13," In its last set of sur-reply papers, Trend suggested that -- should its per se claim fail -- it could, nevertheless, state a claim 
under a ""rule of reason"" analysis. HN16[
] Every plaintiff who asserts a tying claim, whether per se or rule of reason, must 
establish the existence of distinct tying and tied products.  Jefferson Parish Hospital v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 104 S. Ct. 1551, 1567, 
80 L. Ed. 2d 2 (1984). Because the plaintiffs have failed in this regard, their rule of reason claim cannot survive."
272,14," Since whether Trend was coerced to accept the realignment is not dispositive on either the BHCA, see supra slip op. at pp. 
15-16, or antitrust claims, the plaintiffs are not entitled to a stay of our decision on those issues pending further discovery on the 
issue of coercion. "
273,15," Even if the law were that stated in United States v. Wallace and Wallace Fuel Oil Co., 540 F. Supp. 419, 430 (S.D.N.Y. 1982), 
an issue of fact would remain as to whether Trend could have hoped to gain anything from the option agreement. "
274,16," The defendants objected to the breach of contract claims on the ground that the plaintiffs' performance is not pled. Rule 9(c) of 
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that ""in pleading the performance or occurrence of conditions precedent, it is 
sufficient to aver generally that all conditions precedent have been performed or have occurred."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(c). The 
remaining breach of contract claims should be repled to include this general allegation, if truthful. "
275,17," The affidavit of William Johnson supplies NABC's entire argument on the seventeenth count. Johnson became an NABC 
employee in June 1979, after most of the loan agreements that are the subject of the seventeenth count had been 
consummated. Johnson has no first-hand familiarity with those loans and cannot competently discuss NABC's intent respecting 
their provisions."
275,18," We note also that the seventeenth count adequately pleads a breach of contract claim. NABC's objections to this count based 
on the adequacy of the pleadings are meritless. See supra slip op. at p. 36. "
276,19," This standard appears at odds with Judge Winter's statement in Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. Beech Aircraft Corp., 
751 F.2d 117 (2d Cir. 1984) [hereinafter ""Beech Aircraft Corp.""]. There, Judge Winter wrote: [A] plaintiff must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that in personam jurisdiction exists. It is true that, when 
the issue is decided initially on the pleadings and without discovery, the plaintiff need show only a prima facie case. 
However, if that initial decision is contested, the plaintiff must then prove, following discovery, either at a pre-trial hearing or 
at trial, that jurisdiction exists by a preponderance of the evidence. Given that the district court permitted substantial 
discovery, VW must now be held to the preponderance burden. Id. at 120 (citations omitted). If, indeed, this statement is inconsistent with that in Hoffritz For Cutlery, Inc. v. Amajac, Ltd., the 
Court chooses to follow the latter which is both more recent and consistent with a long line of Second Circuit and Southern 
District pronouncements regarding the manner of resolving the issue of personal jurisdiction. Although personal jurisdiction must 
eventually be established by a preponderance of the evidence, the Court has discretion in determining when to require such a 
showing."
276,20," The courts have long held that the Sherman Antitrust Act's nationwide service provisions, 15 U.S.C. ยง 78aa (1982), extend the 
courts' personal jurisdiction to the boundaries of the United States, the due process clause being the only constraint. See, e.g., 
Mariash v. Morrill, 496 F.2d 1138, 1142-43 (2d Cir. 1974). The Court's interpretation of RICO's similar provisions, see H. Rep. at 
4034 (""Section 1965 contains broad provisions regarding venue and process, which are modeled on present antitrust 
legislation.""), is consistent with these precedents."
276,21," The parties do not appear to question the fact that Ekman, Kaila, Ostergaard, Naper, CHB, and KOP have not been served 
with process in this country. However, the papers do not indicate whether Smith or Sclater were ever served in the United "
277,," States. If the plaintiffs can establish that they were timely and properly served in this country, the Court will assess its jurisdiction 
over the two NBL officials. "
278,22," According to the plaintiffs, ""The Second Circuit . . . articulated another theory of jurisdiction over CHB, DnC and KOP based on 
their close relationship to NABC"" in Beech Aircraft Corp. Plaintiffs' Memorandum in Opposition at 147. This statement 
mischaracterizes that opinion, which merely summarized the law pertaining to jurisdiction over parents doing business in New 
York through their subsidiaries. The plaintiffs seek leave to depose NABC on the ""new"" issues raised by the Beech Aircraft Corp.  
decision. Since, however, the issues are not new, the request is denied."
278,23," DnC and CHB have also underwritten several multi-million dollar securities offerings and have designated New York 
brokerage firms to represent them in connection with these offerings. These infrequent forays into investment banking were 
neither substantial nor continuous enough to establish the corporate defendants' presence in New York."
278,24," The long arm statute reads, in pertinent part, As to a cause of action arising from any of the acts enumerated in this section, a court may exercise personal jurisdiction 
over any noncomiciliary, . . . who in person or through an agent:"
278,1, . transacts any business within the state; or
278,2, . commits a tortious act within the state . . .; or
278,3," . commits a tortious act within the state causing injury to person or property within the state . . ., if he "
279,," (i) regularly does or solicits business, or engages in any other persistent course of conduct, or derives substantial revenue 
from goods used or consumed or services rendered, in the state, or (ii) expects or should reasonably expect the act to have consequences in the state and derives substantial revenue from 
interstate or international commerce. . . . N.Y. Civ. Prac. Law ยง 302(a) (McKinney 1972)."
279,25," In his affidavit, Ostergaard indicates that he attended the second meeting only to submit his resignation and otherwise played 
no role there. Ostergaard Affidavit at para. 3."
279,26," NABC's counsel redacted the minutes of its board meetings to exclude references to discussions pertaining to matters other 
than Trend. Naper Affidavit para. 3. "
280,27," Although the amended complaint alleges tortious conduct other than fraud, the moving defendants are not named in any of the 
counts alleging such conduct."
280,28," To the extent that the complaint attempts to assert claims other than fraud against DnC, CHB, and KOP, those claims are 
dismissed as well.  These defendants' jurisdictionally significant contacts relate only to the fraud claims in the amended 
complaint. CHB and DnC originally moved for summary judgment on the RICO and fraud claims against them. The Court need not consider 
these motions, since the claims have been disposed of on jurisdictional grounds. The plaintiffs' motion ordering a continuance of 
the summary judgment motions pending further discovery is also rendered moot. "
281,29, The plaintiffs do not assert that the individual defendants are doing business in New York.
281,30," In Calder v. Jones, 465 U.S. 783, 104 S. Ct. 1482, 1485, 79 L. Ed. 2d 804 n.5 (1984), and in Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., 
465 U.S. 770, 104 S. Ct. 1473, 1478 n.4, 79 L. Ed. 2d 790 (1984), the Supreme Court held that the fiduciary shield doctrine is 
not grounded in the due process clauses of the first or fourteenth amendments. The doctrine is thus inapplicable in an action 
brought under RICO or another federal statute that extends jurisdiction to the limits of due process.  Soltex Polymer Corp. v. 
Fortex Industries, Inc., 590 F. Supp. 1453, 1458 (E.D.N.Y. 1984) (McLaughlin, J.).  However, it remains a gloss on the New York 
long arm statute, which does not extend that far. See Photo Promotions Associates v. Household International, Inc., 584 F. 
Supp. 1238, 1248 (S.D.N.Y. 1984) (Weinfeld, J.) (decided one month after Calder and Keeton and applying fiduciary shield 
doctrine). "
290,1," According to paragraph 8(a) of the Loan Agreement, an unpaid balance of $106,605.48 was owed by TCI as of September 20, 
1979 under a Revolving Credit Agreement dated June 4, 1975, between Henry Goldman (one of plaintiffs' principals), Theatre 
Service and TCI, the payment of which had been guaranteed by Mi-Ann theatre Corp. (a theater owned by plaintiffs' principals) 
and Andrea theatres (one of the plaintiffs herein) pursuant to a concession lease agreement dated November 18, 1979 between 
these two theaters and TCI. According to paragraph 8(b), Andrea Theatres and Mi-Ann Theatre also entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement with TCI 
dated November 18, 1975, under which they owed TCI as of September 20, 1979, the sum of $17,971.41. Finally, according to paragraph 8(c), Andrea Theatres and Mi-Ann Theatre together with some of the principals owed TCI as of 
September 20, 1979, a past-due balance of $24,259.65 pursuant to a promissory note in the face amount of $17,000 dated 
February 6, 1976."
290,2," More specifically, TCI, in its Memorandum of Law in support of its partial summary judgment motion in State Court, avers that 
ATI admitted to owing TCI at least $87,494.79 in the Spring of 1984. To alleviate any possible confusion which might arise from this recitation of the parties' conflicting allegations, the Court notes 
that its decision to abstain in this matter was made only after a thorough review of the papers and pleadings prepared by both 
sides in both the federal and State Court actions. The Court, therefore, summarizes above, without casting any judgments as to "
291,," the merits of the opposing claims, some of the issues that lie at the heart of the State contract dispute and which must be 
resolved before this Court could take up the matter again. "
297,1," Several plaintiffs originally named in the complaint have since voluntarily withdrawn from the action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 
41 (a)(1). These include Barbara Boyle Valentine, individually and as sole proprietor of the Ottawa Group, David Trauger, 
William Thomas and the Scranton Insurance Company. Significantly, PIBA, the principal plaintiff, offers the claims are based on 
the loss of revenues and membership attributed to the defendants' actions in preventing their agents from selling PIBA-Scranton 
plans, but Scranton has decided not to purse any claim."
297,2," Defendants Webster H. Hurley, H. Don Rutherford and Walter Slusser hold the titles of President, Vice President and Regional 
Director, respectively, of Union Bankers. Defendant David Gourley and the corporation of which he is President and sole 
shareholder, defendant Unicorn Marketing, Inc., are managing general agents for Union Bankers in Pennsylvania. Defendant 
David Friedman is a general agent of Union Bankers."
297,3," The defendants have filed three separate motions to dismiss. For the purposes of simplicity, I will treat these motions together. 
In addition to the motions to dismiss, defendants Webster Hurley and Donald Rutherford have requested that they be dismissed 
from the case because this court lacks personal jurisdiction over them. I find it unnecessary to address this issue since I have 
decided to grant the motion to dismiss as to all defendants on other grounds. "
298,4," The complaint requests, and plaintiffs initially sought, a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. The temporary 
restraining order was never granted, and since that time, plaintiffs have not renewed their request for any injunctive relief. I will 
not address this issue as my disposal of the motion renders the claim moot."
298,5," Defendants are technically correct in contending that these factual allegations are not part of the Complaint and, therefore, are 
not properly before this court on a motion to dismiss. HN3[
] Memoranda submitted to a court with a motion to dismiss may, 
however, be accepted by the court and are not considered matters outside the pleadings for purposes of converting the motion 
into one for summary judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b) (6). Wright and Miller 5 Federal Practice and Procedure, ยง1366 
(1969). In addition, I will not consider any affidavits filed by the plaintiffs with their memorandum in response to the motion to 
dismiss, as they are outside the pleadings and add noting to the case. It should also be noted that the memorandum submitted 
by the plaintiffs was accepted ;by the Court for purposes of determining whether plaintiffs should be permitted to amend their 
Complaint. "
299,6," In doing so, the Court noted that the intent of the Pennsylvania Legislature to regulate the insurance industry was collection 
representing insurance regulation in Title 40 of Purdon's Pa. Statutes. Id. "
300,7," The Weiss case differs significantly from the present action in that it involved a class action suit by a group of osteopaths who 
alleged that a hospital had violated the antitrust laws in excluding them from the medical staff. While the Court did find that the 
hospital medical staff was a ""combination"" of individual doctors so that any action taken by the medical staff would satisfy the 
""contract, combination, or conspiracy"" requirement of the Sherman Act, its holding that the medical staff could not conspire with 
the hospital had direct application in this case."
300,8," It should be noted here that there is some authority to the contrary as the Weiss Court recognized at Note 51. The Court 
declined to follow this contrary line of reasoning which emphasizes the difference between inside and ""outside"" agents of a 
corporation. I will follow the teaching of Weiss. At any rate, the defendant agents are more akin to employees than outside 
agents and should be treated as such for the purposes of antitrust analysis. "
301,9, This description is taken from the plaintiffs' memorandum which I have accepted for the reasons stated in Note 4.
301,10," In St. Paul, it was alleged that all of the underwriters of medical malpractice insurance in Rhode Island conspired to prevent 
policyholders of one company, St. Paul, form obtaining insurance except on a claims made basis. As such, the boycott excluded 
consumers from an entire line of commerce unless those consumers agreed to do business with one of the insurers under the 
insurers' terms."
301,11," Monopolizing the sale of insurance is plainly the business of insurance, and Pennsylvania law declares unlawful any act in the 
insurance business that results in or tends to result in a monopoly. 40 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. ยง1171.5(a)(4) (Purdon's 1985). "
302,12," These criteria include the directness of the injury caused by the antitrust violation, the purpose and function of the plaintiff 
relative to the unlawful action, whether damages are readily identifiable or speculative, and whether the identification of 
damages and apportionment among affected parties is a complex issue requiring lengthy proceedings.  459 U.S. at 528. "
303,13," Because the pendent state law claims will be dismissed with the federal claims, I find it unnecessary to address the 
substantive issues raised as to these counts. "
312,1, See infra n. 4. 
315,2," We do not mean to imply that state law standards are identical to, or control the determination of, federal standards under 
RICO. Rather, our discussion is only intended to demonstrate that the factual issues decided in the state court suit are material 
and controlling in plaintiffs' current suit alleging a scheme to defraud. Plaintiffs cite us to United States v. Mandel, 591 F.2d at 
1361, where the court said that ""the mail fraud statute generally has been available to prosecute a scheme involving deception 
that employs the mails in its execution that is contrary to public policy and conflicts with accepted standards of moral 
uprightness, fundamental honesty, fair play and right dealing."" But the point that escapes plaintiffs is that the actual findings 
made in state court preclude a determination that defendants' activities fall under even that broad definition of fraudulent 
conduct. We agree that in some circumstances actions may be found fraudulent even if they do not in terms transgress any 
statute. For example, in Mandel, allegations that a governor accepted bribes in return for adopting favorable positions on certain 
legislation could constitute a scheme to defraud even though the governor clearly had the right to take, and previously had 
adopted, those positions as a matter of independent judgment. There it was obvious that the governor's failure to disclose that 
his judgment was no longer independent was utterly inconsistent with ""fair play and right dealing."" But a duty to disclose must 
arise from somewhere. If no state law is violated, and the circumstances of defendants' actions do not by themselves raise an 
inference of deception, self-dealing or even of any damage to the supposed victims of the scheme to defraud, then plaintiffs 
must point to some other basis for believing that the actions constituting the scheme were in fact fraudulent. Otherwise, the 
previous findings that defendants' actions were legal and proper are sufficient to conclude the issue. See 1B MOORE'S 
FEDERAL PRACTICE para. 0.443[2] at 761 (""Any contention that is necessarily inconsistent with a prior adjudication of a 
material and litigated issue, then, is subsumed in that issue and precluded by the prior judgment's collateral estoppel effect."") "
317,3," Both plaintiffs also argue they had no full and fair opportunity to litigate their RICO claims in state court, based on their 
contention that jurisdiction over RICO claims is exclusively federal. We have concluded that under Illinois law the doctrine of 
collateral estoppel fully applies to bar relitigation of the issues presented in this suit. Therefore we find it more appropriate to 
consider plaintiffs' arguments regarding the interplay between state and federal claims in conjunction with our decision whether 
RICO creates an exception to the usual rule that a federal court must look to state preclusion law in evaluating the effect of prior 
state proceedings on a subsequent federal claim."
317,4," No federal appellate court has yet considered the question whether jurisdiction over RICO claims is exclusively federal. Two 
district courts have determined that state courts enjoy concurrent jurisdiction of RICO claims. See Chas. Kurz Co. v. Lombardi, 
595 F. Supp. 373, 381 n.11 (E.D. Pa. 1984) (stating that there is no indication that Congress intended RICO jurisdiction to be 
exclusively federal); Luebke v. Marine National Bank of Neenah, 567 F. Supp. 1460, 1462 (E.D. Wis. 1983) (stating that a 
presumption of concurrent jurisdiction controls unless Congress explicitly provides to the contrary). On the other hand, two state 
courts (in addition to the court below) have reached the opposite conclusion. See Greenview Trading Co. v. Hershman & 
Leicher, P.C., 108 A.D.2d 468, 489 N.Y.S.2d 502 (1985) (relying primarily on Congress' modeling of RICO provisions on antitrust 
statutes, which are exclusively federal); LaVay Corporation v. First National Bank of Maryland, No. 83-1020 (Circuit Court Prince 
Georges County, Maryland) (same). We doubt whether the analogy to antitrust law is sufficiently strong to conclude that 
because jurisdiction over antitrust cases is exclusively federal, RICO jurisdiction necessarily must follow suit. See Sedima, 
S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., Inc., 473 U.S. 479, 105 S. Ct. 3275, 87 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1985); Schacht v. Brown, 711 F.2d 1343, 1358 (7th 
Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 1002, 104 S. Ct. 508, 509, 78 L. Ed. 2d 698 (1983). Particularly in light of the normal presumption 
that state courts share concurrent jurisdiction over federal statutes, we would be reluctant to conclude from congressional 
silence that Congress intended to depart from the usual rule. Cf.  Greenview Trading Co. v. Hershman & Leicher, P.C., 108 
A.D.2d 468, 489 N.Y.S.2d 502 (court quotes ""principal draftsman of RICO,"" Professor G. Robert Blakey, for the proposition that "
318,," there is nothing on the face of the statute or in the legislative history that touches on the question of concurrent jurisdiction, 
although if Congress had considered the question, it would have made jurisdiction exclusively federal). In any event, we do not 
find it necessary to decide the issue today. It would be particularly ironic for us to find exclusive federal jurisdiction in a case 
involving the operations of state-regulated public utilities, which would seem to be in a special way the concern of state law. See 
Kremer v. Chemical Construction Corporation, 456 U.S. 461, 72 L. Ed. 2d 262, 102 S. Ct. 1883 (1982) (refusing to reach the 
issue whether jurisdiction over Title VII is exclusively federal in the course of deciding whether Title VII creates an exception to 
section 1738)."
318,5," Cf.WRIGHT AND MILLER, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE, ยง 4403 at 19, n.20 (discussing statutes that expressly 
provide for, or defeat, ordinary rules of res judicata)."
318,6," Possibly an argument could be made that by omitting any discussion of the use of collateral estoppel in situations other than a 
civil proceeding brought by the United States following a criminal proceeding brought under RICO by the United States, 
Congress intended to express its intention that traditional collateral estoppel principles would not apply in these other 
circumstances. Certainly, we would be reluctant to find in the legislature's mere failure to provide for these other situations any 
""clear and manifest"" intention to repeal section 1738. Indeed, Professor Blakey, who served as Chief Counsel of the Senate 
Subcommittee on Criminal Laws and Procedures during 1969 and 1970, when the Organized Crime Control Act was considered, 
has indicated that the legislature's omission of any reference to the use of collateral estoppel by private parties following a 
criminal conviction secured by the United States was not the result of a policy decision to bar private parties' use of collateral estoppel, but rather of an understanding of the 
requirements of mutuality at the time RICO was drafted. When the subsequent civil action is brought by a private individual, 
the preclusion effect of the prior criminal prosecution would be governed not by RICO, but by general principles. . . . . Consequently . . . it seems clear that a third party will be permitted to make use of a prior verdict in a criminal 
prosecution against the defendant in a subsequent civil action under RICO.  G. ROBERT BLAKEY AND BRIAN GETTINGS, RACKETEER INFLUENCED AND CORRUPT ORGANIZATIONS (RICO): 
BASIC CONCEPTS--CRIMINAL AND CIVIL REMEDIES, 53 TEMPLE L.Q. 1009, 1045-46 (1980) (footnotes omitted). See also 2 
CORNELL INSTITUTE ON ORGANIZED CRIME, MATERIALS ON RICO 859-93 (1980-81). Of course, Professor Blakey's 
comments do not address the particular situation at issue in this case -- the use of collateral estoppel in a civil RICO suit to 
preclude relitigation of issues decided in a prior state civil case. It seems, if anything, less likely that Congress would intend to 
supersede traditional preclusion principles in this situation than in the criminal/subsequent private-party civil RICO action 
context, which presumably was more easily foreseeable. Regardless, the central inquiry is whether there is any clear indication "
319,," that Congress intended to repeal section 1738 when it enacted RICO, and Professor Blakey's view lends support to our 
conclusion that it did not."
319,7," See United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. at 586 n. 9: RICO imposes no restrictions upon the criminal justice system of the States. See 84 Stat. 947 ('Nothing in this title shall 
supersede any provision of Federal, State, or other law imposing criminal penalties or affording civil remedies in addition to 
those provided for in this title'). Thus, under RICO, the States remain free to exercise their police powers to the fullest 
constitutional extent in defining and prosecuting crimes within their respective jurisdictions. That some of these crimes may 
also constitute predicate acts of racketeering under RICO, is no restriction on the separate administration of criminal justice 
by the states. "
320,8," Indeed, denying issue preclusive effect to prior state convictions for offenses that may serve as predicate offenses under RICO 
would seem nonsensical in light of the fact that a civil action may be brought on the basis of predicate acts, involving certain 
conduct that is merely ""chargeable"" under state law, without the necessity of a prior conviction for violation of the state law. See 
Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Company, Inc., 473 U.S. 479, 105 S. Ct. 3275, 87 L. Ed. 2d 346. It would seem anomalous to require 
a court presiding over a civil RICO action to determine whether the defendant could be convicted of violating state law while 
refraining from relying on the fact that he had already in fact been convicted of such a violation."
320,9," Without discussing whether an exception to ยง 1738 should be recognized, the court in Greenblatt v. Drexel Burnham Lambert, 
Inc., 763 F.2d 1352 (11th Cir. 1985) applied collateral estoppel principles to preclude a civil RICO claim primarily on the basis of 
issues decided against the plaintiff in a prior arbitration of state contract claims. See also Sports Factory, Inc. v. Chanoff, 586 F. 
Supp. 342, 347-48 (E.D. Pa. 1984) (res judicata barred relitigation of issues in civil RICO suit that were or could have been 
decided in prior arbitration)."
320,10," In light of our determination that the district court correctly dismissed this suit on grounds of collateral estoppel, we need not 
review its holding that the RICO claims were not barred by res judicata. We do affirm the district court's holding that res judicata bars plaintiffs' pendent claims, which seek to impose an accounting and 
constructive trust on the corporations and their officers for breach of their fiduciary duties under state law. (The district court only 
referred explicitly to the state law claims urged by the City, although the County had apparently brought similar claims; the 
County has not raised this issue in its briefs on appeal, but since the same rationale applies to both parties' state claims, we treat 
them together.) The City correctly notes that Illinois has a permissive counterclaim rule, and that generally, absent a compulsory "
321,," counterclaim rule, when facts form the basis of both a defense and a counterclaim in an initial action, the original defendant's 
failure to allege these facts as a defense or counterclaim does not normally preclude him from relying on those facts in a 
subsequent action brought by him against the original plaintiff. See RESTATEMENT OF JUDGMENTS ยง 22(1) and comment b. 
An exception to this rule is recognized, however, where the relationship between the potential counterclaim and the plaintiff's 
claim in the first suit ""is such that successful prosecution of the second action would nullify the initial judgment or would impair 
rights established in the initial action."" RESTATEMENT OF JUDGMENTS, ยง 22(2)(b) and comment f; Lee v. City of Peoria, 685 
F.2d 196, 201 (7th Cir. 1983); Martino v. McDonalds System, Inc., 598 F.2d 1079 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 966, 62 L. Ed. 
2d 379, 100 S. Ct. 455 (1979). We believe the rationale of the exception noted in the Restatement and recognized in Lee and 
Martino is fully applicable to the state claims urged here which, as the district court noted, in many respects duplicate the 
counterclaims that plaintiffs voluntarily withdrew from the state proceedings. We agree with the district court's conclusion that: [If the City and County] were granted the relief that is requested of this court, rights established in favor of the corporate 
defendants by the judgment of the state court would clearly be impaired. Moreover, since the City and County chose to 
intervene with state proceedings, this is not the usual instance where defendants, having been sued, were involuntarily 
forced to litigate in the prior forum so that equities counsel that they be given the opportunity to raise their own claims in a 
forum of their choice. The traditional considerations associated with res judicata, therefore, are fully applicable to the City 
and County.  County of Cook v. MidCon Corp., 574 F. Supp. at 909 n.1."
321,11," Plaintiffs contend that the district court erred by dismissing plaintiffs' RICO claims on the basis that they had made no 
allegations of a separate ""racketeering injury"" distinct from injuries arising from the predicate acts. We note that the Supreme 
Court recently decided that no such ""racketeering injury"" requirement exists.  Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Company, Inc., 473 U.S. 
479, 105 S. Ct. 3275, 87 L. Ed. 2d 346; American National Bank & Trust Company v. Haroco, Inc., 473 U.S. 606, 105 S. Ct. 
3291, 87 L. Ed. 2d 437 (1985). However any error in the district court's analysis of this point is without effect since we have 
approved its alternative, independent rationale for dismissal based on collateral estoppel. "

331,3," Although the court in South Carolina Elec. & Gas Co. v. ICC, 236 U.S. App. D.C. 258, 734 F.2d 1541 (D.C. Cir. 1984), did not 
expressly make this point, that is the clear implication of its discussion of the shippers claim that ""depreciation accounting was 
currently being used in ratemaking."" Id. at 1545. If the ICC's accounting rule had operated like FERC's CWIP rule, the ICC rule 
would have bound both the agency and the customers to accept depreciation accounting in ratemaking. Instead, in the case the 
shippers cited, the ICC had simply set out cost figures based on the new system of accounting, along with cost figures based on 
the old system of accounting, not as a matter of record (and a fortiori, not as a matter of law) but as additional information 
relevant to the reasonableness of the rates.  Id. at 1545-46. "
348,4," In Public Systems v. FERC, 196 U.S. App. D.C. 66, 606 F.2d 973 (D.C. Cir. 1979) (Public Systems I), we noted that ""on 
numerous occasions the Supreme Court has recognized both the importance of competition in regulated industries and the 
responsibility of regulatory agencies to encourage competitive forces.  [FERC] has been required to examine the impact on 
competition of ratemaking orders, the issuance of utility securities, and industry supply practices."" Id. at 982 (footnotes omitted).  
It may well be that FERC's responsibility to ""encourage competitive forces"" compels FERC either to consider the potential 
anticompetitive effects of a proposed rule at the rulemaking stage or to supply an adequate remedy that allows wholesale 
customers to avoid those effects when the rule is applied in ratemaking. As explained in text, we do not reach this question but 
we believe FERC may find it necessary to do so on remand. "
351,5," Lest this aspect of our decision be misunderstood, we emphasize that we are not relying on Public Systems' claim that it 
""presented a detailed comparative analysis of state and federal regulation"" that demonstrated ""a high probability that price 
squeeze would result from liberalized or indiscriminate CWIP."" Brief for Public Systems at 18.  We have examined the record 
citations offered in support of this allegation, and we think that Public Systems greatly exaggerates.  The first citation, J.A. at 
691-92, contains nothing more than an assertion that FERC practices such as tax normalization and forecasted test year periods 
""already often yield wholesale rates greatly in excess of comparable retail rates."" Id. at 692 n. 1.  The second, J.A. at 702, 
contains what Public Systems referred to as a ""laundry list of favorable [federal] regulatory practices,"" id., including those already 
mentioned and others -- with no showing that state regulatory practices, in these respects or in other offsetting respects, were 
any less ""favorable."" The final citation, J.A. at 1062, simply reiterates, citing only the citations we have just discussed, the 
assertion that FERC's ""rate-setting methods are more generous to suppliers than are the methods of virtually all state 
commissions."" We do not see in Public Systems' allegations, unsubstantiated as they are, a quantum of evidence sufficient to 
oblige FERC to undertake a detailed comparative study of state and federal ratemaking policies on remand, though, as earlier 
noted, FERC might well conclude that this is now necessary."
351,6," We vacated the price-squeeze portion of FERC's Pennsylvania Power Co. decision in Boroughs of Ellwood City, see 731 F.2d 
at 963 n.5, 979, but we expressly stated that ""we do not have occasion in this case to consider the validity of the Commission's 
announced 'general rule' of not remedying a price squeeze that is the product of different policies and procedures at the state 
and federal level."" Id. at 974. Instead, we found that FERC ""went beyond its 'general rule' in this case; while stating that a price 
squeeze resulting from a utility's discretionary decision as to when to file retail and wholesale rate increases presents a more 
compelling case for a price squeeze remedy,"" the Commission found mitigating circumstances to excuse just such a result in this 
case.  Id. at 975. We reversed because FERC had completely ignored the effects of the price squeeze and because we found 
no circumstances that would mitigate or even excuse price discrimination.  Id. at 979. We concluded that FERC had ""not 
exercised its discretion under Conway in a manner consistent with the purpose of the Conway doctrine to guard against price 
discrimination by retail suppliers against their municipal competitors."" Id. "
352,7," We note that even if we assume the validity of FERC's general policy against remedying ""regulatory"" price squeezes, it by no 
means necessarily follows that FERC is not obliged to consider ""regulatory"" price squeeze effects in the rulemaking context.  
FERC's general policy is addressed to situations in which federal ratemaking policy, as expressed in a valid FERC rule or 
regulation, differs from state ratemaking policy.  That is not inconsistent with the proposition that, in promulgating rules and 
regulations, FERC is obliged to consider ""regulatory"" price squeeze effects and any other anticompetitive effects the proposed 
rule make have.  Federal policy, as expressed in the Federal Power Act, may in fact mandate that FERC do so.  We express no 
opinion on that question. "

370,1," Since the contract provisions in question here concern the provision of services rather than the sale of goods, arguably the 
notice provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code do not apply. See, e.g., Dixie Lime & Stone Co. v. Wiggins Scale Co., 144 
Ga. App. 145, 240 S.E.2d 323 (Ct. App. 1977) (notice not required for breach dealing with service aspect of contract). We note 
in passing, however, that even if the U.C.C. were determined to govern the contract issues before us, MPW has done all that is 
required of it under the applicable notice provisions of the U.C.C. See, e.g., Okla. Stat. Ann., title 12, ยง 1-201(26) (West 1963) 
(notice is given when a buyer takes such steps as may be reasonably required to inform the seller in ordinary course; notice is 
received by a person when ""it comes to his attention"" or when ""duly delivered . . . at any . . . place held out by him as the place 
for receipt of such communications""), id.; ยง 1-207(27) (""Notice, knowledge or a notice or notification received by an organization

374,2," Although Facet readily concedes that Keystone was ""one of MPW's competitors"" at the time Keystone became a P & D 
distributor, see Brief of Appellee at 3, Facet nonetheless argues that the two WDs were not ""competing customers"" because 
both enterprises did not become Facet distributors at reasonably contemporaneous times. In so arguing, Facet relies upon the 
case of England v. Chrysler Corp., 493 F.2d 269 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 869, 42 L. Ed. 2d 107, 95 S. Ct. 127 (1974). 
That case, however, is distinguishable. In England, the trial court found and the appellate court affirmed that the plaintiff and the 
allegedly favored customer were not competitors. In the case at bar, it is clear beyond cavil that MPW-KC and Keystone were 
competitors at the time the allegedly discriminatory benefits were given to Keystone. "

387,13," In light of the above disposition we do not reach the merits of the additional arguments raised by the Exchanges in support of 
dismissing individual claims asserted against them. However, since these arguments may have to be addressed in the not-too-
distant future, and since Michelson will have the opportunity to propose amendments to his pleading, it is worthwhile to make the 
following observations: (1) It is questionable whether the complaint adequately alleges antitrust claims against the Exchanges for 
the reasons set forth in Minpeco, S.A. v. ContiCommodity Services, Inc., 552 F. Supp. 327, 331-32 (S.D.N.Y. 1982). (2) 
Michelson's Commodity Exchange Act claims may not be untimely as a matter of law because a question of fact appears to exist 
as to whether the equitable doctrine of tolling precludes the application of the relevant statute of limitations, see Stephens v. 
Clayton Brokerage Co., No. 82 - 5786, slip op.  at 11-12 (N.D.Ill. Jan. 6, 1984), reprinted in the Exchange Defendants' 
Memorandum of Law In Support of Their Motion To Dismiss, at Exhibit B. In any event, for the reasons discussed infra, the 
complaint fails to allege a private right of action under Sections 6(c) and 13(b) of the Commodity Exchange Act. (3) The 
dismissal of the Exchanges from the New Mexico proceeding for lack of personal jurisdiction before the case was transferred 
here suggests that the Exchanges cannot be held liable to Michelson under New Mexico law, see Pearson v. Northeast Airlines, 
Inc., 309 F.2d 553, 559 (2d Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 372 U.S. 912, 9 L. Ed. 2d 720, 83 S. Ct. 726 (1963). Finally, (4) the 
Supreme Court's recent ruling in Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 105 S. Ct. 3275, 87 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1985), may 
allow Michelson to assert a RICO claim against the Exchanges. "
388,14," The complaint alleges a violation of the Clayton Act. HN5[
]"
388,15," HN8[
] The Fourteenth Amendment bars any state from depriving ""any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law."" U.S. Const. amend. XIV, ยง 1."
388,16," This argument was made by the Exchange defendants in support of their motion to dismiss the complaint's New Mexico state 
law claims. "
389,17," Although the complaint alleges violations of CEA sections 6c, 9b and 13b, we agree with the defendants that Michelson 
intended to allege the violations of the provisions noted in the text."
389,18," Although the parties make no mention of the fact in their briefs, we note that Section 13(b) of the CEA was not in effect in 
1979-80 when the acts Michelson complains of are alleged to have taken place. See Futures Trading Act of 1982, ยง 230, Pub. L. 
No. 97-444, 96 Stat. 2294, 2319 (effective Jan. 11, 1983). This provides yet another ground for a finding that there exists no 
private right of action under Section 13(b). "
391,19," Our records contain no response by Michelson to Conheeny's motion to dismiss. Nevertheless, it is highly unlikely that 
Michelson could proffer an argument that would justify denying Conheeny's motion. "
394,1," These include recent delinquencies as a sub-distributor of Best Brands itself. See Best Brands' letter to Consolidated dated 
October 24, 1984 which in part reads as follows: For sometime now, the Chemical Bank Factoring Division, to whom we assign our accounts receivable, has expressed to 
us their concern and displeasure at the fact that your Company's [Consolidated's] payments of our invoices, for goods sold 
and delivered, have been delinquent. As we have explained to you, it is our business custom to assign our accounts receivables to Chemical Bank, who then 
collects payment of same.  On several occasions, Chemical Bank has contacted us to state they do not wish to continue to 
act in such a capacity with respect to your account, because of your delinquency in payment, and the attendant 
inconvenience to them resulting therefrom."
394,2," On May 15, 1985, being completely unaware of any proposed second master distributor, I ordered in general terms that 
defendants Falstaff and Pearl not ""discriminate"" or ""interfere"" with Best Brands' exclusive distributorship. Upon learning of the 
commencement of shipments to Consolidated some five or more days after the order, I ruled those shipments to be a violation of 
the order. The circumstances surrounding these shipments as thereafter developed in depositions lends further support to the 
determination of contempt. Notwithstanding that Consolidated had been told by defendants in April that it must have a letter of 
credit before Falstaff would ship, defendants, after the Court's order, without advising the Court, and without waiting for the letter 
of credit, commenced shipping, justifying their shipments on the theory that they were in possession of some of Consolidated's 
blank checks. They even made the first shipment without ascertaining whether there were funds in the bank to cover the checks 
-- and it turned out there were not. "
397,3, Q. Do you recall any explanation given to you by Mr. Mullen for the price increases imposed on Best Brands? A. He didn't give me one. Q. He never gave you one? A. No. Q. Did he [Mr. Mullen] ever mention to you a dispute between Mr.  Kalmanovitz and A. Raymond Tye?
397,*," * * * A. Certainly. Q. What did he tell you about that? A. I believe that he was involved in - to my best knowledge, he was involved in a dispute with Mr. Tye, Mr. Raymond Tye 
and Mr. Kalmanovitz, which was basically Mr. Ray Tye, was to help settle a legal dispute with a Considine Distributing. I 
don't know if he owned that at that point or not, or whether he ever owned it, and there were suits filed against Falstaff, and 
evidently he never settled it, or he was never active in the settlement of it. Q. Did Mr. Mullen tell you anything else about the dispute between Mr.  Kalmanovitz and Mr. Tye? A. Only the fact that nothing had been settled, and that Paul [Kalmanovitz] was very upset with Mr. Tye, and the fact that 
he had gotten Raymond Tye and David Tye mixed up, and he [Mullen] was obliged to tell him [Kalmanovitz] they were not 
the same people. Q. Mr. Mullen was trying to tell Mr. Kalmanovitz they were not the same people? A. Yes, that they were brothers, that they were not one and the same."
397,*, * * * Q. Is there anything more Mr. Mullen told you about how upset Mr.  Kalmanovitz was?
397,*, * * * 
398,," Q. Did you ever discuss that dispute with Mr. Kalmanovitz, directly? A. Vaguely. Q. What time? A. Must have been sometime this spring. Q. Spring this year [1985]? A. Yes. Q. What did he tell you about it? A. He was very upset with David and Ray Tye. Q. Did he tell you why he was upset with them? A. Because they had not performed an obligation that he was expecting them to do, and which goes back to settling of 
Considine affair. Q. Do you recall when, in the spring, this discussion took place? A. Not really . . . ."
398,*," * * * Q. Did he tell you any more precisely, what he considered to be the obligations of the Tyes? A. He felt that Mr. Raymond Tye had pledged to settle this litigation with Considine in Massachusetts, and that he had not 
performed as expected, and he was just very upset. . . ."
398,*, * * * Q. Did he ever tell you that he wanted to retaliate against the Tyes for their failure to settle the Considine litigation?
398,*," * * * A. He said he was very upset with them, and retaliate -- I don't remember that word being used, but - Q. What words do you remember? A. Just that he was very upset with them. Q. Did he say what he intended to do, if anything, as a result? A. Not in detail, I'd just have to speculate on it. MR. AUFSES: No, just testify to what you remember him saying. A. I'm not going to speculate. I don't remember the detail of that.  Frankly, I wanted to stay . . . I wanted to stay away from it."
398,4," Not only Kalmanovitz's choice of a dual master, but also the manner in which it came to pass suggest the absence of good 
faith. If indeed, after Best Brands' successes, see supra, Falstaff truly felt there were problems, one would have expected the 
parties to meet to discuss their resolution.  Instead of that there was the secret appointment of Consolidated in violation of Best 
Brands' exclusive mastering agreement. Also illuminating is Kalmanovitz's insistence on shipping to Consolidated 
notwithstanding this court's order and demoting a plant manager who, knowing of this Court's order, refused to ship. 
Kalmanovitz's letter reads: "
399,," May 23, 1985 Mr. Earl Thompson Falstaff Brewing Corporation"
399,1025," Grant Avenue Ft. Wayne, Indiana 46803 Dear Mr. Thompson: You are hereby notified that effective immediately you are removed from the position of Plant Manager. This action is taken as a result of your refusal to ship beer to Consolidated Beverage. Mr. Val Pickett will become Plant Manager effective immediately. /s/ Paul Kalmanovitz "
400,5, The entire industry has an awareness of Schaefer beer's never recovered sales losses following an ill-conceived price rise. 
412,1," The opinion cites  [**37] only two cases for this finding, Stewart v. Stearns & Culver Lumber Co., 56 Fla. 570, 48 So. 19 (1908) 
and Janet Realty Corp. v. Hoffman's Inc., 17 So.2d 114 (1944). Both recite the common law rule that agreements in restraint 
of trade are unenforceable as contrary to public policy. "

of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. "
421,2," From 1965 until 1974, Inman Oil was known as Inman-Anderson Oil Company. In 1974, the company reverted to its original 
name of Inman Oil Company, for reasons unrelated to this litigation. For convenience, the company will be referred to throughout 
this opinion as Inman Oil."
421,3," The petroleum products pertinent to this litigation come in three types by degree of refinement -- gasoline; diesel fuel (kerosene 
and heating oil); and lubricants (greases, motor oils, hydraulic oils and the like). Lubricants are delivered to industrial consumers 
either in bulk or in packaged form. The lead mining companies generally require some volume of lubricant in both forms. "
423,4," Although Inman Oil does not raise the point, we note that the 1979 JFA contains the same language. Thus, under our 
interpretation, the Distributor Development Philosophy would also be a part of the 1979 JFA. The 1981 JFA revokes all prior 
agreements without qualification. "
426,5," Because we find there was no competition within the meaning of the statute, we do not reach the question of whether there 
was the requisite injury to competition."
426,6," Some conflict exists within our Circuit regarding the exact elements of attempted monopolization. In our leading case of United 
States v. Empire Gas Corp., 537 F.2d 296, 298-99 (8th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1122, 51 L. Ed. 2d 572, 97 S. Ct. 1158 
(1977), as well as in our most recent discussion of the subject, National Reporting Co. v. Alderson Reporting Co., 763 F.2d 
1020, slip op. at 9 (8th Cir. 1985), we stated the elements as being (1) specific intent to monopolize, and (2) dangerous 
probability of success in the relevant product and geographic market. In Trace X Chemical, supra, however, we included a 
separate element of predatory conduct and made no reference to the requirement of the relevant market.  Trace X Chemical, 
supra, 738 F.2d at 265. The bulk of the circuits combine our two formulations, requiring (1) specific intent, (2) predatory conduct, 
and (3) dangerous probability of success in the relevant market. See, e.g., Manufacturing Research Corp. v. Greenlee Tool Co., 
693 F.2d 1037 (11th Cir. 1982); William Inglis & Sons Baking Co. v. ITT Continental Baking Co., 668 F.2d 1014 (9th Cir. 1981), 
cert. denied, 459 U.S. 825, 74 L. Ed. 2d 61, 103 S. Ct. 58, 103 S. Ct. 57 (1982); Lektro-Vend Corp. v. Vendo Corp., 660 F.2d 
255 (7th Cir. 1981); United States v. Dairymen, Inc., 660 F.2d 192 (6th Cir. 1981); Northeastern Tel. Co. v. American Tel. & Tel. 
Co., 651 F.2d 76 (2d Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 943, 102 S. Ct. 1438, 71 L. Ed. 2d 654 (1982); Nifty Foods Corp. v. Great 
Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., 614 F.2d 832 (2d Cir. 1980); George R. Whitten, Jr., Inc. v. Paddock Pool Builders, Inc., 508 F.2d 547 
(1st Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 421 U.S. 1004, 44 L. Ed. 2d 673, 95 S. Ct. 2407 (1975). But see Domed Stadium Hotel, Inc. v. "
427,," Holiday Inns, Inc., 732 F.2d 480 (5th Cir. 1984) (requiring relevant market but making no reference to predatory conduct); RCM 
Supply Co. v. Hunter Douglas, Inc., 686 F.2d 1074 (4th Cir. 1982) (same). HN8[
] The intent element is often proven by inferences drawn from the defendant's conduct. E.g., Gough v. Rossmoor Corp.,"
427,585," F.2d 381, 390 (9th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 936, 59 L. Ed. 2d 494, 99 S. Ct. 1280 (1979). However, even in the 
presence of direct evidence of intent, we think a separate showing of predatory or anti-competitive conduct is necessary. 
Evidence of intent alone can be ambiguous and misleading. The legal sophistication of one defendant may enable it to avoid 
leaving any documentary trail of improper intent, while another defendant lacking in this sensitivity may ""create rich evidence of 
such intent simply by the clumsy choice of words to describe innocent behavior."" Posner, Antitrust Law -- An Economic 
Perspective 189-90 (1976). To maintain the distinction between vigorous competition and unlawful attempts to restrain 
competition, it must be shown that the defendant pursued its goals through unfair or predatory means. Thus, we affirm our 
articulation in Trace X Chemical, supra, of predatory conduct as a separate element of an attempted monopolization claim. As will be discussed below, we hold in the case at bar that the element of predatory conduct was not met. For this reason, we do 
not reach the element of dangerous probability of success, and we therefore decline to determine whether a showing of the 
relevant market is required in connection with that element. We leave that decision to a case which squarely presents us with the 
question. "
428,7," The use of the term ""competitor"" in this context differs from that under the Robinson-Patman Act. There, the statute expressly 
defines the types of competition cognizable under the Act. The relationship between Inman Oil and Conoco simply does not fit 
within one of those three categories. Here, in contrast, Inman Oil is a ""competitor"" of Conoco in the sense that it had a customer 
desired by Conoco. Thus, our reference here to Inman Oil as a competitor is not inconsistent with our holding above that it could 
not be in primary line competition with Conoco for purposes of the Robinson-Patman Act."
428,8," A number of courts have adopted a cost-based approach to determine predatory pricing, influenced by the article by Areeda & 
Turner, Predatory Pricing and Related Practices Under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 88 Harv. L. Rev. 697 (1975). See, e.g., 
Transamerica Computer Co. v. IBM Corp., 698 F.2d 1377 (9th Cir. 1983); Chillicothe Sand & Gravel Co. v. Martin Marietta 
Corp., 615 F.2d 427 (7th Cir. 1980); Pacific Engineering & Prod. Co. v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 551 F.2d 790 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 
434 U.S. 879, 54 L. Ed. 2d 160, 98 S. Ct. 234 (1977). "
429,9," Shell Oil Co. v. State Tire & Oil Co., 126 F.2d 971 (6th Cir. 1942), cited by Inman Oil, is inapposite. As the magistrate 
recognized, that case involved fraudulent misrepresentations by the defendant, conduct clearly qualifying as ""wrongful means."" "
430,10, There is no dispute that the JFA's were contracts for the sale of goods and thus governed by the Uniform Commercial Code. 
448,1," The Court conceded that a contrary rule with respect to active state supervision had been suggested by its plurality opinion in 
City of Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., 435 U.S. 389, 415, 55 L. Ed. 2d 364, 98 S. Ct. 1123 (1978). Town of Hallie v. 
City of Eau Claire, supra, 105 S. Ct. at 1720. This court previously applied the standards enunciated in the plurality opinion in 
denying similar motions for summary judgment by these defendants. See Endorsement Ruling on Defendant City of Hartford's 
Motion for Summary Judgment (entered August 12, 1983). "
449,2," As noted above, the City of Hartford need not demonstrate that the state actively supervised the negotiation or implementation 
of the contracts at issue in this case. See Town of Hallie v. City of Eau Claire, supra, 105 S. Ct. at 1720. The approval of the 
contracts by the Executive Committee of the North Central Connecticut Emergency Medical Services Council and the State 
Office of Emergency Medical Services nonetheless serves to reinforce the court's conclusion that the city has acted in 
furtherance of a clearly articulated state policy. "

454,2," Dolphin estimated the characteristics of the total population of Japanese visitors to San Francisco by relying on the Hawaii 
Visitors Bureau's Annual Research Report, for 1981. "
456,3," Our opinion is not intended as an indication of the validity of Dolphin's evidence of conspiracy. This is an issue to be resolved in 
the course of the litigation. We review the evidence and accusations of conspiracy only as necessary to our assessment of 
causation."
456,4," We find the term competitive reaction misleading, see infra n.6."
456,5," In some instances an antitrust plaintiff who is excluded from the relevant market may seek to recover the going concern value 
of his business as an alternative measure of damages.  Graphic Products, 717 F.2d at 1579; ABA Antitrust Section, Antitrust 
Law Developments 410-11 (2d ed. 1984) (hereinafter ""Antitrust Law Developments""). "
457,6," The parties to this case, the district court, and some decisions, Murphy Tugboat, 658 F.2d at 1262; R.S.E., 523 F. Supp. at 
966, have referred to this component of the antitrust plaintiff's burden as a requirement that antitrust plaintiffs account for the 
""competitive reaction"" of antitrust defendants. Although those courts which have used the term competitive reaction have 
essentially employed a lost profits analysis by stating that the antitrust plaintiff cannot estimate his market share and lost profits 
by assuming that defendants would not have reacted competitively by reducing their prices in response to plaintiff's entry in the 
market, we prefer not to use the term competitive reaction. Competitive reaction implies that we must determine whether the 
defendants would have continued cartel pricing or reacted competitively to Dolphin's entry in the market by reducing their prices. 
But under Bigelow Dolphin's measure of recovery is the difference between what it could have made in a free economic market 
and what it actually made in spite of the anticompetitive activity. A competitive price differential between Dolphin and defendants 
is presumed in order to measure what Dolphin could have made in an economic free market, not because defendants would 
necessarily abandon their cartel in favor of competitive price reductions. Dolphin has lost only the difference between what it 
could have made in a hypothetical free market and what it actually made in spite of the anticompetitive activity. "
458,7," For purposes of reviewing the grant of summary judgment it is reasonable for us to assume that the survey will not be given to 
the jury in isolation. It will likely be supported by testimony from Dr. Mak and Dolphin's owner. During cross examination the 
defendants can bring out any problems with the survey or the Report and emphasize factors which they believe indicate that the 
Report overestimates the market share which Dolphin would have attained in a free market."
458,8," Defendants raise a number of other challenges to Dolphin's evidence regarding the amount of injury. Some of these arguments 
may be considered in determining the admissibility of the survey and Report, and some may be introduced to rebut the Report if 
it is found admissible. For purposes of this appeal, however, none of defendants' contentions indicates that the jury would have 
to engage in speculation in determining the amount of Dolphin's injury."
458,9," Dolphin also attempts to challenge the district court's refusal to find the agreement between defendants Japan Travel Bureau 
International and Nippon Express U.S.A. a per se violation of the antitrust laws and grant summary judgment in its favor. Dolphin 
claims that the denial of summary judgment is appealable as inter alia a denial of preliminary injunctive relief. See Safe Flight 
Instrument Corp. v. McDonnell-Douglas Corp., 482 F.2d 1086, 1093 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1113, 38 L. Ed. 2d 740, 94 
S. Ct. 843, 180 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 97 (1973). However, the district court denied Dolphin's motion for summary judgment and 
request for temporary injunctive relief on March 23, 1983. Dolphin's notice of appeal was not filed until July 7, 1984. Even were 
we to consider the denial of summary judgment on the per se violation issue appealable as a denial of temporary injunctive 
relief, the issue is not properly before us because Dolphin failed to file its notice within thirty days of the order denying injunctive 
relief as required under Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1). "

470,27," Burlington also asserts that White Stag's refusal to accept plaintiff's ""reasonable offer"" [ILLEGIBLE WORD] indicate that it is 
the defendant who has unduly prolonged this litigation. Plaintiff had agreed to permit entry of summary judgment in favor of 
White Stag and to provide a statement [ILLEGIBLE WORD] White Stag from any wrongdoing provided White Stag would forego

(E.D.N.Y. 1983). [ILLEGIBLE WORD] Given these options, this Court cannot punish White Stag for its chosen alternative. "

471,29," See note 26 supra for text of Section 1927. [ILLEGIBLE WORD] Section 1927's language has been read in an analogous manner to the ""bad faith"" standard underlying the court's inherent 
equitable powers to award fees ""[i]n order not to deter an attorney [ILLEGIBLE WORD] from his ethical duty to 'represent his 
client zealously?"" Gianna Enterprises, Supra, 551 F. Supp at 1359 (quoting [ILLEGIBLE WORD]  [**46] Model Code of

version of Rule 11 did not became effective until August 1, 1983. See Fed R. Civ. P. 11. As the Second Circuit noted in Eastway, 
""the language of the [new] rule provides a striking contract to the words of its predecessor. 762 F.2d at 253. See [ILLEGIBLE

472,31," Burlington filed these papers on April 1, 1985. See note 30 Supra."
472,32," White Stag alleges that it notified plaintiff of Ms. Funderburk's affidavit on or before June 30, 1983. [ILLEGIBLE WORD] 
Rhine's Supp. Aff. [ILLEGIBLE WORD] P 9. on that date, White Stag sent a letter to Burlington confirming [ILLEGIBLE WORD] 
an earlier report that Ms. Funderburk's remark had been directly refused by a sworn affidavit in its possession. See id. at Ex. B. 
Hence, even if Burlington did  [**50] not see the affidavit until May 13, 1985, the date White Stag filed its reply papers, it knew of 
its existence for almost two years beforehand. Moreover, in plaintiff's memorandum of law [ILLEGIBLE WORD], it makes no 
mention of Ms. Funderburk's remark, [ILLEGIBLE WORD] indicating [ILLEGIBLE WORD] its own awareness of the sworn 
affidavit at least from the time it filed its opposition papers."
472,33," See Viola Sportswear, Inc. v. Mimun, 574 F. Supp. 619, 621 (E.D.N.Y. 1985) (attorney's fees awarded when plaintiff alleged a 
nationwide company on the basis of one ten dollar pair of jeans), See also U.S. ex rel. U.S. Namibia [ILLEGIBLE WORD] Trade

473,34," Because Rule 11, as amended, encompasses the situation where claims are rendered untenable by subsequent discovery 
disclosures, see [ILLEGIBLE WORD] Schwarzer, Sanctions Under the New Federal Rule II-A Closer Look, 104 F.R.D. 181, 189 
(1985),  [**51] this court need not address the fact that Nemeroff v. Abelson, 704 F.2d 652 (2d Cir. 1983), would provide it with 
alternate grounds to grant attorney's fees witness its [ILLEGIBLE WORD] equitable powers for the same prescribed period. See 
id. (where plaintiff's was suffered setbacks that warranted either an accelerated pace of discovery or a discontinuance of the 
action neither of which occurred, prevailing defendants were entitled to an award of attorney's fees)."
473,35," Thus, White Stage is entitled to attorney's fees for [ILLEGIBLE WORD] a period commencing [ILLEGIBLE WORD] April 1, 
1985. See text accompanying note [ILLEGIBLE WORD] supra. "
484,1," In its original counterclaim, Marion-Kay claimed that the ยง 1, Sherman Act, violation resulted from the fact that Marion-Kay was 
precluded from selling its seasoning products to KFC franchisees. It appears that this claim has been abandoned and that 
Marion-Kay is now contending that KFC has unlawfully foreclosed Marion-Kay from selling KFC seasoning to KFC franchises. "
487,2," In a business format franchising system, the franchisor merely provides a trademark and some supplies to be used in the 
operation of the business. Id. See also Siegal v. Chicken Delight, Inc., 448 F.2d 43 (9th Cir. 1972). In these situations the tied 
products are generally commonplace articles and are only remotely connected with the trademark itself. Id."
487,3," In a business format system a franchisor can easily maintain its quality standards through less intrusive means other than 
requiring its franchisees to purchase those items from the franchisor. As a result, the coerced purchase of those tied products is 
nothing ""more than an effort to impede competition on the merits in the market for the tied products."" Id.  (citations omitted). "
492,1," For purposes of RICO, each act of criminal activity is counted as an act of racketeering activity even if numerous acts arise out 
of the same episode. See United States v. Weatherspoon, 581 F.2d 595, 601-02 (7th Cir. 1978). "
500,*," The Honorable Robert A. Grant, Senior District Judge for the Northern District of Indiana, is sitting by designation. "
503,1," No mean feat because ""franchises"" (the tying product here) are just names and methods of doing business, not ""products"" and 
some courts have held that as a matter of law there cannot be a tie-in between a name and a product, see Krehl v. Baskin-
Robbins Ice Cream Co., 664 F.2d 1348 (9th Cir. 1982); Principe v. McDonald's Corp., 631 F.2d 303 (4th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 
451 U.S. 970, 101 S. Ct. 2047, 68 L. Ed. 2d 349 (1981); Jack Walters, supra, 737 F.2d at 704-05 (reserving the question). A tie 
involves products that may be sold in separate markets. But a method of doing business (the franchise) is not sold separately 
from the ingredients that go into the method of business. A franchiser and its franchisees are part of a business organization not 
altogether different from vertical integration. See G. Frank Mathewson & Ralph A. Winter, The Economics of Franchise 
Contracts, 28 J.L. & Econ. 503 (1985). We need not consider the implications of this approach, however."
503,2," There has been a debate among both judges and scholars concerning the effects of tying arrangements. The close division on 
the rationale in Hyde was attributable in part to this. On the scholarly debate, compare Phillip Areeda & Donald F. Turner, V 
Antitrust Law paras. 1129c, 1134b (1980), Robert H. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 140-44, 372-75 (1978), and Roger D. Blair & 
David L. Kaserman, Antitrust Economics 381-405 (1985), with Louis Kaplow, Extension of Monopoly Power Through Leverage, 
85 Colum. L. Rev. 515 (1985). See also S.J. Liebowitz, Tie-in Sales and Price Discrimination, 21 Economic Inquiry 387 (1983). 
Many scholars, and at least four Justices, would analyze tying arrangements under the Rule of Reason or permit them outright 
even when the seller has substantial market power. We need not join the debate, given the conclusions discussed below. "
504,3," The use of barriers to entry as a proxy for market power is familiar in the law of mergers. Unless barriers to entry prevent rivals 
from entering the market at the same cost of production, even a very large market share does not establish market power. See 
e.g., United States v. Waste Management, Inc., 743 F.2d 976 (2d Cir. 1984) (market share exceeding 50% does not establish 
power over price when entry is easy); Echlin Manufacturing Co., 105 F.T.C. 410 (June 28, 1985). Cf. William M. Landes & 
Richard A. Posner, Market Power in Antitrust Cases, 94 Harv. L. Rev. 937, 947-51, 962-68 (1981); Areeda & Turner, supra, at 
para. 504 (1978). True, even in the absence of barriers the inevitable delay in entry by rivals may enable those with a large 
share of a market to raise the price and make supracompetitive profits. But the possibility that short-run market power exceeds 
long-run power does not apply to a case, such as this, in which the restraints in question have lasted for many years. Rivals to 
Comprehensive have long since been able to enter, so that barriers (and not lags) are what matter. "
505,4," To the extent Digidyne Corp. v. Data General Corp., 734 F.2d 1336 (9th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 473 U.S. 908, 105 S. Ct. 
3534, 87 L. Ed. 2d 657 (1985), holds that a plaintiff may prevail, without establishing power over price in the relevant market, by 
showing that rivals cannot produce exactly the same package, it conflicts with Spartan, Kypta, and several other cases, including 
Jack Walters in our circuit. E.g., Systemized of New England, Inc. v. SCM, Inc., 732 F.2d 1030 (1st Cir. 1984) (no market power 
as a matter of law in a unique system); Domed Stadium Hotel, Inc., v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 732 F.2d 480 (5th Cir. 1984) (no market 
power as a matter of law in a factually unique reservation system that occupied more than 20% of its market). Sellers may strive 
to differentiate their products from others in order to compete for the custom of patrons with slightly different needs or tastes. It 
would be perverse to turn this ordinary attribute of the competitive struggle into a source of illegality. No one may copy 
Comprehensive's trademark or its copyrighted materials precisely, but rivals may create similar items for similar costs. Only 
when there is a barrier to entry -- when rivals' cost of creating similar items is higher than the full costs of the original creator -- 
may differences in the design of the package be treated as proof of market power. Spartan, Kypta, and the other cases we have 
cited are in line with Fortner II and Hyde; we follow them rather than Data General. "
508,5," Merchant v. Ruhle, 740 F.2d 86 (1st Cir. 1984), holds that general civil verdicts may be inconsistent. See also Alexander M. 
Bickel, Judge and Jury -- Inconsistent Verdicts in the Federal Courts, 63 Harv. L. Rev. 649 (1950). Merchant assumes that the 
rule in criminal cases should apply in civil cases too; we think not, for reasons we have explained. It is also established that 
special verdicts of civil juries must be consistent. Inconsistent general verdicts may be much rarer, but there is no good reason 
to treat them differently from inconsistent special verdicts as a rule. There may be something to the First Circuit's argument when 
the inconsistency involves but one party, for this may arise in a borderline case. There is no special virtue to a rule of all-or-
nothing when several different claims may cluster right around the boundary between judgment for plaintiff and judgment for 
defendant; a very small difference may put one claim over while the other fails. Different outcomes on very similar facts therefore 
may not be inconsistent at all. Whatever the appropriate treatment of one-party cases, inconsistency among parties is 
impermissible. "
509,6," Barnes and Cundiff hold that a request to have the jury resume its deliberations is the only appropriate response to special 
verdicts that are inconsistent with general verdicts, see Rule 49(b), and that if a party does not act in time he waives any later 
challenge. We need not decide whether this is also the rule for inconsistent general verdicts. "

Regueira, Inc. v. Am. Distilling Co., 642 F.2d 826, 830 (5th Cir. 1981). In this instance, the Court questions whether the hearsay 
statements of Mr. Graf, a non-party, would be admissible, and whether Mr. Ruhs is sufficiently identified with Apple so as to 
render his hearsay statements admissible as a party admission or otherwise. Plaintiff has not made any showing or argument as 
to the admissibility of such statements."
536,5," Nor has plaintiff submitted any argument or testimony to rebut the affidavit of Mr. Fiddler regarding the lack of involvement on 
the part of D. H. Holmes and/or Computer Depot in plaintiff's termination. Moreover, Mr. Holmes admitted he had no evidence 
that D. H. Holmes asked Apple to terminate Computer Connection as an Apple dealer. See Will Holmes Deposition, pp. 98-99. 
Plaintiff merely alleges that Mr. Dyer's testimony would reveal a [presumably illegal] connection between the D. H. Holmes 
dealership and plaintiff's termination. No such testimony has been shown to the Court, and Mr. Dyer's affidavit affirmatively 
contradicts Mr. Holmes' admitted speculation."
536,6," Plaintiff alleges that Apple, Compumark and other Apple dealers were involved in a conspiracy ""(a) to agree upon and fix prices 
charged to ultimate consumers of the Apple Computer; (b) to agree upon and enforce standardized terms and conditions upon 
which computers were to be offered for sale and to otherwise eliminate competition in the sale of computers but for defendant, 
Compumark."" See Paragraph VIII, First Supplemental and Amending Complaint filed August 21, 1984. "
537,7," ""Complaints about price-cutters are 'natural -- and from the manufacturer's perspective, unavoidable -- reactions by distributors 
to the activities of their rivals.' Such complaints, particularly where the manufacturer has imposed a costly set of nonprice 
restrictions, 'arise in the normal course of business and do not indicate illegal concerted action.' [Citation omitted] Moreover, 
distributors are an important source of information for manufacturers. In order to assure an efficient distribution system, 
manufacturers and distributors constantly must coordinate their activities to assure that their product will reach the consumer 
persuasively and efficiently. To bar a manufacturer from acting solely because the information upon which it acts originated as a 
price complaint would create an irrational dislocation in the market."" ""Thus, something more than evidence of complaints is needed. There must be evidence that tends to exclude the possibility that 
the manufacturer and nonterminated distributors were acting independently. As Judge Aldisert has written, the antitrust plaintiff 
should present direct or circumstantial evidence that reasonably tends to prove that the manufacturer and others 'had a 
conscious commitment to a common scheme designed to achieve an unlawful objective.' [Citations omitted]"" Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Serv. Co., supra, 104 S. Ct. at 1470-71. "

if a properly worded injunction could require Texaco to continue providing crude oil to nonintegrated refiners in accordance with 
the consent order, the State's action, if successful, would force Texaco to divest itself of Getty's former California assets. Yet, the 
FTC has given Texaco permission to acquire these assets, permission which must have been a major inducement for Texaco to 
agree to the conditions embodied in the consent order. "
560,9," State focuses on a portion of the opinion wherein the court concludes the appeal is not made moot by the consummation of 
the merger ""[s]ince we trust that the attorneys general still could challenge the merger and are still interested in the information, .

of the consent order. Furthermore, it is not clear the court is referring to challenges under state law. Finally, the court offered as 
an alternative ground for its conclusion that ""the question presented is 'capable of repetition, yet evading review.'"" (Ibid., quoting 
Southern Pac. Terminal Co.  v. Int. Com. Com. (1911) 219 U.S. 498, 515 [55 L.Ed. 310, 316, 31 S.Ct. 279].)"
560,10," States are not without remedy against large mergers. HN19[
] States may bring suit in federal court under federal antitrust law, either in their proprietary capacities or in parens patriae, for treble damages resulting from violation of the antitrust laws. (15 
U.S.C. ยงยง 15, 15c; Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co. (1972) 405 U.S. 251, 262-263 [31 L.Ed.2d 184, 192-193, 92 S.Ct. 885].) 
Furthermore, states may sue for injunctive relief against violations of federal antitrust law.  (15 U.S.C. ยง 26; Georgia v. 
Pennsylvania R. Co. (1945) 324 U.S. 439, 447 [89 L.Ed. 1051, 65 S.Ct. 716]; Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., supra, 405 U.S. at p. 
261 [31 L.Ed.2d at pp. 191-192].) There is a split of authority among federal appellate courts whether the injunctive relief allowed under federal law includes 
divestiture. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals holds divestiture is not available to private parties suing under that provision. ( 
International T. & T. Corp.  v. General T. & E. Corp. (9th Cir. 1975) 518 F.2d 913, 920; Calnetics Corp.  v. Volkswagen of 
America, Inc. (9th Cir. 1976) 532 F.2d 674, 692; cert. den.  (1976) 429 U.S. 940 [50 L.Ed.2d 309, 97 S.Ct. 355].) The Sixth 
Circuit, without analysis, has followed the Ninth Circuit's holding. ( Arthur S. Langenderfer, Inc.  v. S. E. Johnson Co. (6th Cir. 
1984) 729 F.2d 1050, 1060, cert. den. (1984)     U.S.     [83 L.Ed.2d 401, 105 S.Ct. 510, 511].) The First Circuit came to the 
opposite conclusion in CIA. Petrolera Caribe, Inc. v. Arco Caribbean, Inc. (1st Cir. 1985) 754 F.2d 404, 414-430. We have read 
the cases and find the First Circuit's analysis more persuasive. "
570,*," The Honorable Robert A. Grant, Senior District Judge of the Northern District of Indiana, is sitting by designation."
570,1," Defendants also argued that the complaint should be dismissed because (1) it does not sufficiently allege an antitrust injury, (2) 
it does not allege that the antitrust violation has a substantial impact on interstate commerce, and (3) it concerns local 
government activity that the tenth amendment prohibits the federal government from regulating. The district court rejected all of 
these additional grounds for dismissal. In view of our finding that the complaint should be dismissed on ""state action"" grounds 
we do not address these arguments. "
571,2," The plaintiffs include Unity Ventures, an Illinois partnership engaged in real estate development; William Alter, Unity Venture's 
managing partner and the beneficial owner (through land trusts) of the 145-acre parcel at issue; and LaSalle National Bank of 
Chicago, trustee of the land trusts comprising the 145 acres. "
572,3," Although this failure to allege any involvement by the Villages may in itself justify dismissal of this portion of the complaint since 
without such involvement there was no joint action to ground a conspiracy, we need not decide this issue because of our 
decision to dismiss on state action grounds. "
573,4," Although paragraph 1046(b)'s syntax leaves something to be desired (the ""in order to"" phrase in the first clause suggests that 
the second clause will set forth a conditional requirement for obtaining federal grants, where in fact the second phrase uses the 
permissive verb ""may""), we think it means that a municipality has authority to adopt proportionate cost sharing if they do so for 
the purposes of being (i.e., ""in order to"" be) eligible for federal grants. "
574,5," This power includes the power to regulate and restrict the location and use of buildings, structures and land for trade, industry, residence and other uses 
which may be specified by [the board of supervisors], to regulate and restrict the intensity of such uses, to establish building 
or setback lines on or along any street, trafficway, drive, parkway or storm or floodwater runoff channel or basin outside the 
limits of cities, villages and incorporated towns which have in effect municipal zoning ordinances; to divide the entire county 
outside the limits of such cities, villages and incorporated towns into districts of such number, shape, area and of such 
different classes, according to the use of land and buildings, the intensity of such use (including height of buildings and 
structures and surrounding open space) and other classification as may be deemed best suited to carry out the purposes of 
this Act; to prohibit uses, buildings or structures incompatible with the character of such districts respectively . . . . Ill. Ann. Stat. ch. 34, para. 3151 (Smith-Hurd 1985 pocket part). "
575,6," Although the parties have not briefed the issue (except for a footnote reference in the State of Illinois' Amicus brief), we think 
that the claim regarding the zoning decision may be barred by the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, another exemption that the 
Supreme Court has read into the Sherman Act. This doctrine bars Sherman Act suits against persons who associate for the 
purpose of restraining trade and competition if they pursue this purpose through legitimate political means. See Eastern Railroad 
Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464, 81 S. Ct. 523 (1961); United Mine Workers v. 
Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626, 85 S. Ct. 1585 (1965); California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 
U.S. 508, 30 L. Ed. 2d 642, 92 S. Ct. 609 (1972) (limiting Noerr-Pennington to legitimate, non-abusive political conduct); 
Racetrac Petroleum, Inc. v. Prince George's County, 601 F. Supp. at 908-910 (setting forth the doctrine in greater detail). As we 
understand the complaint (as amended by the brief) it charges that the Villages violated the Sherman Act by associating 
together in an attempt to persuade the county Board to deny the special permit and that they did so for anticompetitive purposes. 
The complaint contains no intimation that the Villages abused the political process in seeking to convince the County to deny the 
special zoning permit. This sort of association for purposes of influencing governmental action would appear to be exempt from 
antitrust challenge under Noerr-Pennington. "
583,1," This cost, however, was not included as part of the direct labor costs developed during the 13-week study. "
584,2, Petitioners do not challenge the $27 fee for approval of minor amendments. 
587,3," Contrary to petitioners' argument, Reply Brief for Petitioners at 8-9, the term ""incidental,"" as used in Electronic Industries, is the 
opposite of ""independent."" In Electronic Industries, we stated: The FCC can include in the cost basis of its fees only those expenses which the agency incurs to confer value on the payor 
. . . .  Expenses incurred to serve some independent public interest cannot . . . be included in the cost basis for a fee, 
although the Commission is not prohibited from charging an applicant or grantee the full cost of services rendered to an 
applicant which also result in some incidental public benefits. "
587,554," F.2d at 1114-15 (emphasis in original).  In describing the difference between ""incidental"" and ""independent"" public benefits, 
the court provided a hypothetical example, discussed above, see supra p. 15, which clearly indicates that the court considered 
""incidental"" and ""independent"" as antonyms: If the [FCC], in granting an equipment type approval under 47 U.S.C. ยง 302(a) (1970) and 47 C.F.R. ยง 2.803 (1975), is 
required to incur expenses for testing or inspection, such expenses can be charged in full to the applicant.  These activities 
have undisputed private benefits although they may also create incidental public benefits as well.  But, if the agency were to 
engage in further activity to determine whether a piece of equipment which has already been found to have no potential for 
creating ""harmful interference"" under Section [302(a)] meets standards for consumer safety it would be doing so to satisfy 
some independent public interest, and the charge for these additional expenses could not be included in fees imposed on 
equipment owners.  Although there may be some private benefit in safety testing, it is not a part of the service the agency 
must render to the manufacturer in order for him to comply with the statute: the additional tests serve an independent public 
interest, with only incidental private effects. Id. at 1115 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted). "
588,4," Petitioners' reliance in this respect upon New England Power, supra, and Public Service Co. of Colorado v. Andrus, 433 F. 
Supp. 144 (D. Colo. 1977), is misplaced.  The issue in the portions of these opinions cited in petitioners' briefs was whether 
there was any private benefit at all, not whether some portion of the costs involved in providing that private benefit should be 
allocated to an independent public benefit. See NCTA II supra, 554 F.2d at 1097 (characterizing issue in New England Power); 
433 F. Supp. at 152-53."
588,5," See, e.g., United States v. Container Corp., 393 U.S. 333, 21 L. Ed. 2d 526, 89 S. Ct. 510 (1969) (exchange of price 
information had anticompetitive effect and therefore violated section 1 of the Sherman Act); American Column & Lumber Co. v. 
United States, 257 U.S. 377, 66 L. Ed. 284, 42 S. Ct. 114 (1921) (holding unlawful an ""open competition plan"" for hardwood 
manufacturers, which included, among other things, exchange of price information)."
588,6," HN6[
]  49 U.S.C. ยง 10706(b) (2)(B)(v) provides, ""Upon request, the organization must . . . admit any person to any meeting at which rates or rules will be discussed or voted upon, and must divulge to any person the vote cast by any member carrier on 
any proposal before the organization."""
588,7," Petitioners attack the Commission's revocation of its 50 percent approach on two additional grounds.  First, they contend that 
the Commission failed adequately to explain the change in policy.  See Brief for Petitioners at 31.  We find the Commission's 
explanation for its change in policy to be entirely adequate.  As already noted, decisions of the Supreme Court and of this court 
between 1974 and 1976 cast considerable doubt upon the Commission's earlier fees decisions and, in particular, established the 
propriety of recovering the full cost of agency services when the other conditions discussed above were met.  See supra pp. 5-6.  
The Commission's NOPR clearly explained that the abandonment of the 50-percent rule was due to these developments in the 
law.  See supra p. 8. Petitioners' other argument is that the Commission arbitrarily continued to allocate a portion of the costs of other Commission 
services to the public.  See Petitioners' Brief at 35.  We also find this argument lacking in merit.  The fees to which petitioners 
refer are fees for major rail transactions, which the Commission set at 25 percent of the Commission's costs.  See 49 Fed. Reg. 
at 6122. The Commission explained that 50 percent of the costs of reviewing major rail transactions is ""attributable to directly "
589,," related or responsive applications"" by non-parties. Id. Petitioners do not dispute the propriety of reducing the fee to account for 
this cost.  What petitioners do dispute is the Commission's decision to allocate an additional 25 percent of its costs to ""the 
general public interest."" Id. The Commission, however, explained the basis of its 25 percent ""public interest"" allocation by pointing to specific public benefits 
produced by its consideration of major rail transactions: Major transactions involve the merger of at least two class I railroads.  In such cases the Commission must consider, 
among other matters, the effect of the proposed transaction on the adequacy of transportation service to the public and the 
interest of carrier employees.  See 49 U.S.C. 11344(B). Id. These benefits would seem to be independent of the benefit -- ensuring that the merger does not violate antitrust standards -- 
provided to the merging parties by the Commission's review process.  The Commission need not consider such matters as 
""adequacy of transportation service to the public"" or ""the interest of carrier employees"" as part of its antitrust review.  Hence, we 
are unable to conclude that the 25 percent allocation was arbitrary, or that this allocation was inconsistent with the Commission's 
refusal to allocate to the public a portion of the costs of reviewing rate association agreements and amendments."
589,8," The tariff-filing requirement may contribute to industry stability in at least two ways.  First, it may make secret price-cutting 
impossible, since tariffs are of course public records and inasmuch as a motor carrier must charge the rate specified in its tariff. 
Second, the requirement may make instantaneous price cuts more difficult; before lowering its rates to meet or undercut the 
competition, a carrier must go to the trouble of filing its new proposed rates with the ICC.  These statutorily provided constraints 
on competition, in turn, stabilize the profits of individual carriers. "
590,," Our conclusion that this increased industry stability warrants the imposition of a filing fee may appear, at first blush, inconsistent 
with the statement in NCTA II, see supra p. 15, that a fee may not be predicated merely upon the adoption of some practice of 
general benefit to the industry as a whole.  Such is not the case, however.  The tariff system is, in a sense, a cooperative 
venture, sanctioned by statute and supported by the ICC, in which each carrier agrees to publish its rates, thereby foregoing the 
opportunity of making secret, precipitous rate cuts that would be advantageous to the carrier in the short run.  In return, all the 
other carriers agree to similar behavior, the result of which is to stabilize prices in the industry.  As already noted, this stability is 
one of the chief purposes underlying the tariff-filing requirement.  The ICC, by accepting a carrier's tariffs, assists that carrier in 
fulfilling its obligation to the other carriers, even as it assists the carrier in complying with its statutory duty.  Hence, in these 
special circumstances, the ICC's tariff-filing services benefit the individual carrier, and not merely the industry as a whole."
590,9," Petitioners make one additional argument against the ICC's conclusion that processing of tariffs confers a private benefit on 
motor carriers. They argue that the Commission's conclusion in Ex Parte No. MC-165, Exemption of Motor Contract Carriers 
From Tariff Filing Requirements, 133 M.C.C. 150 (1983), that tariff filing is burdensome and expensive for contract carriers, is 
inconsistent with the view expressed in the ICC's final decision that tariff filing produces a private benefit.  These conclusions are 
not inconsistent, however.  Tariff filing no doubt is burdensome and expensive but, as noted above, it also produces significant 
benefits for the industry.  In our view, it is these industry-related (and non-public) benefits that justify imposition of a tariff filing 
fee in this case, notwithstanding any burdens to the carriers of complying with the requirement. "
591,10," Petitioners also contend that tariff-filing produces a third public benefit, namely increased rate competition.  However, they 
have produced no evidence that tariff-filing actually produces this effect.  The cases they cite in support of their argument, 
moreover, suggest the opposite.  See Locust Cartage Co., supra, 430 F.2d at 343 (tariff-filing prevents ""the kind of fluid, ad hoc 
ratemaking which endangers efficient service;""); Bowser and Campbell v. Knox Glass, Inc., 390 F.2d 193, 195-96 (3rd Cir. 1968) 
(purpose of requirement that contract carriers file tariffs is to ""prevent destructive competition between contract carriers and 
common carriers . . . thus confer[ring] on common carriers a right of knowledge and surveillance of the actual competition from 
contract carriers""). "
592,11," Petitioners' attack on the ""enormous"" number of hours of annual, sick, and holiday leave (a total of 42.9 days per year) used in 
the Circular also misses the mark.  See Petitioners' Brief at 21. The number of hours used is apparently the number of hours to 
which an ICC employee with 3 to 15 years of service is entitled.  See Government's Brief at 40-41.  The only plausible argument 
against the OMB's methodology here -- an argument not raised by petitioners -- is that it fails to account for the fact that many 
employees may not use all of their sick or annual leave.  It is not clear, however, whether this would make much difference in the 
percentages."
592,12," Petitioners' other attack on the G&A component -- based on an allegedly unexplained increase in rent, communications, and 
utilities of $36 million -- apparently was withdrawn after the Government pointed out that the actual figure was $36,000 and 
satisfactorily explained the discrepancy which petitioners had pointed out.  See Brief for Respondents at 42 n.42; Petitioners' 
Reply Brief at 16 n.14. "

and the corporation we met and discussed who would handle which accounts and came to an agreement at that meeting. Q: Was that in any way, sir, directed to the fact that independent dealers had been competing for the same State agency 
rental business? A: That's correct."
603,*," * * Q: And would you tell us in what way and why there would be competition between the dealers in connection with the rental 
contract? Would you describe that for us? A: The pricing was the same whether the branch offered it or whether the dealer offered it. And it became a question of 
which outlet the State agency felt more at ease with doing business."

the contracts each would call on."
603,*," * * A: That's a fair statement. Q: All right, sir. And after meeting with the competitors and deciding the contracts that you would call upon, did that cease a

finance the business, but was hoping to obtain 100% financing from the Bank. He made no investment in facilities or 
equipment. He had no contract with the bank. . . . Thus, it seems plain that Martin was unprepared to either enter the new 
business or to expand his existing business to include the gasoline plant purchase and operation. "

607,30," Savin vigorously protests that Jayco released any claim of conspiracy involving state officials. The Compromise and 
Settlement Agreement reserved to Jayco the right to pursue its ยง 1 and ยง 2 claims as set forth in its Fourth Amended complaint. 
Savin points to the following language in the complaint -- ""Savin and its independent dealers . . . entered into a combination, or 
conspiracy . . .,"" -- and argues that the omission of any explicit reference to state officials precludes Jayco from using their acts 
as the basis of a conspiracy. We disagree. Jayco need not name every conspirator when it pleads conspiracy. Moreover, after a 
review of the record, we doubt if the references to state officials caused Savin any undue surprise."
607,31," Had Savin not refused to sell machines to its dealers and required that they bid not higher or lower than a predetermined

609,41," Jayco's half-hearted attempt to characterize Savin's refusal to deal as a group boycott and thereby bring it within the ambit of 
per se condemnation, Mendelovitz v. Adolph Coors Co., 693 F.2d 570, 577 (5th Cir. 1972), is unavailing. Simply put, the facts do 
not support a finding of a group boycott. In fact, Jayco was offered the opportunity to participate in the service network, but 
declined to do so. As one commentator has observed, ""boycott law deals with concerted efforts by traders at one level to keep 
others out or inhibit their competitive efforts at that level by making it more difficult for them to find what traders at that level 
need, usually suppliers or customers but sometimes access to transactions with other traders at the same level. When concerted 
conduct entails these elements, the boycott rule may have application."" L. Sullivan, Antitrust ยง 83, at 232 (1977). The only set of facts that might justify a preliminary finding of group boycott would be that where Unicopy, alone or with other 
dealers, conspired with Savin to deny Jayco copiers or supplies. See, e.g., Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway Hale Stores, Inc., 359 U.S. 
207, 79 S. Ct. 705, 3 L. Ed. 2d 741 (1959) (department store conspired with wholesalers and manufacturers to deny competing 
store the goods it needed to do business). Because there is no evidence that any dealer influenced Savin's refusal to deal or "
610,," that anybody other than Savin refused to deal with Jayco -- and that refusal extended only to enforcing its customer restriction -- 
this set of facts remains hypothetical."

611,47," In arriving at a definition of the relevant product submarket, the district court in Grumman noted: The United States Government is the market concerned with production and distribution of weapons systems for

612,48," If we assume that the whole state was the relevant market (something that Jayco has never even contended), Jayco has 
shown neither Savin's market power nor an anticompetitive effect on interbrand competition in either the copier or supplies 
product market. In fact, from reading Jayco's briefs, one gets the impression, unsupported by any meaningful data, that Savin 
was the only major supplier of copiers in Texas. While this might have been true, the record does not disclose to us the fate of 
IBM, Xerox, Canon, Saxon, A.B. Dick, Sharp, Minolta, and the other manufacturers. Jayco has the burden of proving 
anticompetitive effect, Red Diamond, 637 F.2d at 1007, and it has failed to carry it. "
626,1," In evaluating the single price charged by a manufacturer, the antitrust analysis may depend on how costs are allotted to the 
production and distributional activities. For example, an alternative analysis could lead to the conclusion that the supplier did not 
discriminate in the price of the underlying product, but engaged in predatory pricing of its distributional activities -- conduct that 
would be illegal under section 2 of the Sherman Act. "

642,6," This position derives from Justice Powell's dissent in Thiboutot.  Justice Powell thus characterized the legal implications of the

""legitimate claim of entitlement"" under the federal aviation laws. A showing of congressional intent to confer some benefit is 
consistent with the analysis of entitlements. See Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577, 33 L. Ed. 2d 548, 92 S. Ct. 2701 
(1972). The question is ultimately one of legislative intent, whether Congress intended to create enforceable rights. "
644,10," The fact that the statute is a directive to a federal agency does not alter this conclusion. HN17[
] The Secretary is required 
under the statute to receive assurances from airport sponsors that the airport will be available on fair, reasonable and 
nondiscriminatory terms. Such language has been held to create enforceable rights. See Cohen v. Massachusetts Bay Transp.

646,12," Controversies as to the relative authority of state and federal governments are distinct, in terms of the appropriate analytic 
framework, from issues involving the rights of individuals: When a litigant contends that . . . an attempted state regulation intrudes into an area of exclusively national concern, the 
constitutional issue is wholly different from that posed by an assertion that certain government action abridges a personal 
liberty secured by the Constitution. The essence of a claim of the latter type . . . is that no organ of government, national or 
state, may undertake the challenged activity. In contrast, when a person alleges that one of the federalism provisions of the 
Constitution has been violated, he implicitly concedes that one of the two units of government -- national or state -- has 
power to engage in the questioned conduct. The core of the argument is simply that the particular government that has 
acted is the constitutionally improper one. J. Choper, Judicial Review in the National Political Process 174-75 (1980) (quoted in United Nuclear Corp., 564 F. Supp. at 586-
87.) "
647,13," In view of the determination that the plaintiff has, under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, a cause of action based upon 49 U.S.C. ยง 2210(a), 
it is not necessary to decide whether there is also a private right of action implied by ยง 2210(a). As the court has decided that 
neither 49 U.S.C. ยง 1349 nor ยง 1305(a) create rights enforceable by plaintiff under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, it follows that there is also 
no private right of action created by those provisions alone."

Defendants' contention that the amended complaint lacks a sufficient factual basis to state a claim under the antitrust laws must 
be rejected, in light of the liberal pleading requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a). Defendants' 
assertion that the amended complaint makes only a ""bare allegation . . . that the Commission's alleged conduct was pursuant to 
a 'contract, combination or conspiracy' with PBA"" ignores the factual allegations in the complaint. Defendants' Memorandum in 
Support of Motion to Dismiss at 26. There is no inconsistency, as defendants claim, in New York Air's allegation that the 
Commission's action was based on several factors, one of which constituted a violation of the antitrust laws. "

U.S.C. ยง 1305(b). As with defendants' argument in relation to New York Air's constitutional claims, this contention is premature.  
There is no evidence before the court by which this issue can be resolved. "

654,3, Neither the original complaint nor the amended complaint was served on defendant Harrison.
654,4," In discussing its first claim, ITP argues that Fox should not have remitted the joint venture's funds to Harrison and that Fox is

1564 at 740 (1971). Since, under New York law, a partnership and a joint venture are treated identically, see infra slip op. at p. 4, 
the Court finds (in the absence of any evidence to the contrary) that New York law controls the plaintiffs' capacity to bring this 
action."

655,7, Whether a factor weighs for or against granting of standing depends on how it is stated. 
656,8," Although Cerra's alleged injury is not a direct consequence of the alleged antitrust violation, it too occurred by virtue of conduct 
that the antitrust laws were assertedly intended to prevent. "
658,9," The plaintiffs direct our attention to Schlottman Agency, Inc. v. Aetna Casualty and Surety Co., 70 A.D.2d 1041, 417 N.Y.S.2d 
561 (4th Dep't 1979), and Eagle Spring Water Co. v. Webb & Knapp, Inc., 236 N.Y.S.2d 266 (Sup. Ct. N.Y. County 1962). These 
decisions held that a complaint may survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under the Donnelly Act if it generally 
alleges ""that the tendency of the alleged arrangement or combination will be or has been to lessen competition in the relevant 
market."" Schlottman Agency, Inc., supra, 417 N.Y.S.2d at 562. This statement runs counter to State v. Mobil Oil Corp., 38 
N.Y.2d 460, 344 N.E.2d 357, 381 N.Y.S.2d 426 (1976). In deciding a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the Court of 
Appeals in that case examined the anti-competitive impact of the particular practice alleged. State v. Mobil Oil Corp. continues to 
state the law in New York. Moreover, even if the cases cited by the plaintiffs were applicable, they would not save the amended 
complaint, which does not satisfactorily delineate the market in which competition was impaired."
658,10," The defendants reiterate their objections based on standing, antitrust injury, and failure to allege the requisite agreement. The 
standing and antitrust injury analyses under the Donnelly Act mirror those under the Sherman Act. Therefore, Fox's objections to 
ITP's standing and injury as they relate to the Donnelly Act claim are without substance.  Cerra, however, lacks both 
prerequisites to a viable Donnelly Act claim. See supra slip op. at pp. 7-10. Since the language in the Donnelly Act requiring a 
""contract, agreement, arrangement, or combination"" is somewhat broader than the comparable Sherman Act language, Harlem 
River Consumers Cooperative, Inc. v. Associated Grocers of Harlem, Inc., 408 F. Supp. 1251, 1283 (S.D.N.Y. 1976), the 
complaint a fortiori alleges sufficient concerted action under that statute."
658,11," That the distribution agreement was partly prepared in New York is unimportant. Although this fact might bear on issues of 
personal jurisdiction or conflict of laws, it says nothing about the economic impact of the scheme. "
659,12," Predictions, as contrasted with misstatements of fact, afford a very shaky basis for asserting fraud."

to participate in a bidding process for cable television rights. As we conclude in this case, the TCI Cablevision court concluded 
that the plaintiff's costs were ""too attenuated from the allegedly illegal activity to qualify as an actionable 'antitrust injury.'"" Id. at

and Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773-91, 95 S. Ct. 2004, 44 L. Ed. 2d 572 (1975), before granting them antitrust 
immunity, Justice Stevens further notes that, Unless the Arizona Supreme Court affirmatively directed petitioners to restrain competition by limiting the number of 
otherwise qualified lawyers admitted to practice in Arizona, it simply cannot be said that its position is anything more than 
one of neutrality; mere authorization for anti-competitive conduct is wholly insufficient to satisfy the test for antitrust 
immunity. [Citing Medical, supra, and City of Lafayette, supra.] No affirmative decision of the Arizona Supreme Court to 
restrain competition by limiting the number of qualified persons admitted to the bar is disclosed on the present record. The 
alleged conspiracy to introduce a factor other than competence into the bar examination process is not the product of a 
clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state policy and hence does not qualify for antitrust immunity. "

785,3," Hefner's original complaint named Ivan Alexander Jr., the District 1-A Grievance Committee Chairperson and the State Bar of 
Texas as defendants. Hefner subsequently amended his complaint by dropping the State Bar of Texas as a defendant and 
adding the members of Grievance Committee 1-A, the members of the Board of Directors of the State Bar of Texas as well as 
the Executive Director and two Texas Supreme Court Justices who serve as liaisons to the State Bar. At no time has Hefner 
named the Texas Supreme Court, which promulgates the rules for disciplinary proceedings, as a defendant in this cause. "
788,1," In 1984, Continental lost the right to sell Renfield's product in McHenry, DuPage and Cook counties, making Romano 
Renfield's exclusive distributor in this area. "
789,2," Because the Court in Monsanto expressly rejected the Seventh Circuit's test in this area, we do not look to the Seventh 
Circuit's discussion in Valley for guidance. "
790,3, Renfield did meet with Romano and Continental separately prior to Valley's termination. See n. 6.
790,4," Valley claims that prices had been falling, and after Valley's exclusion, prices stabilized."
790,5," We realize, of course, that evidence of actual meetings and express agreement is unnecessary. Communication is all that is 
required, and this can occur in a variety of ways. The result may be simply a tacit understanding rather than an explicit 
agreement. Circumstantial evidence would be the usual method of proof."
790,6," There were separate meetings between Renfield and each of its distributors prior to Renfield's announcement of the contours 
of the realignment. On July 17, 1981, Renfield met with each of its distributors separately and informed them that it planned to "
791,," realign them. Valley has produced no evidence to suggest that these meetings were not what Renfield, Romano and Continental 
explained they were: unilateral notifications. The fact that Renfield met each distributor separately after it had decided to realign, 
and that every participant in these meetings has described the unilateral nature of Renfield's conduct negates any inference that 
a common scheme to fix prices was discussed among the alleged co-conspirators at that time. The July meetings were similar to 
the October meetings (and a September meeting with Romano) and there is no evidence that common understandings arose 
out of the July meetings. In fact, all evidence is to the contrary. For example, Continental was so upset as to its realignment in 
October, that its initial October meeting had to be cancelled in order that Continental could meet with Renfield's president, as 
Continental insisted. Memorandum in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment, Exh. 3. If some common scheme 
had arisen out of the July meetings, Continental would not have been surprised and disturbed in October. Valley has not focused 
on these pre-October meetings to support its allegation of a conspiracy, see supra at p. 8, and it is easy to see why it has not: 
Renfield's conduct in announcing a realignment, meeting with each distributor separately, then announcing the contours of the 
alignment, supports an inference of unilateral action. When the Court in Monsanto and the post-Monsanto courts emphasized 
co-conspirator communications, obviously they meant communications that would support an inference of unity of purpose, for 
example, joint meetings among the conspirators, or meetings held in secret, or meetings in which pricing was discussed. Since 
the meetings here, as Valley tacitly recognizes, do not suggest unity of purpose, but the contrary, they do not support Valley's 
position. All the evidence as to Renfield-Romano Continental meetings was presented to us in the preliminary injunction hearing, and we 
found, as here, that this evidence only supported Renfield's assertion of no conspiracy. Memorandum in Support, Exh. C. The 
Seventh Circuit agreed that the evidence presented at the hearing could not support an inference of a conspiracy to fix prices. 
Valley, 678 F.2d at 744. Valley has submitted no evidence regarding these meetings (or any other meetings) to change our 
conclusion. "
805,1," This time period can be modified to some extent. In some instances, the Secretary and the Attorney General can shorten the 
period by granting expedited review. They can also extend the period by requesting additional information from an applicant and 
suspending the running of the time period until the information arrives. "
806,2," This case is concerned with portions of the Act directed towards the promotion and certification of export trade entities. The Act 
includes other provisions; in all, it is composed of four titles. Title I sets forth the Act's overall purposes and definitions, and 
establishes the Department of Commerce office for promotion of export trade entities. Title II concerns the role of banks in the 
formation and financing of export trade entities. Title III contains the Act's certification provisions. Title IV amends the Sherman 
Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act to curtail the application of antitrust laws to foreign business transactions by U.S.  
companies, so long as the transactions are free of anticompetitive domestic effects. See generally Bruce & Pierce, 
Understanding the Export Trading Company Act and Using (Or Avoiding) Its Antitrust Exemptions, 38 Bus. Law. 975, 975-77 
(1983). "
807,3," References to agency materials generally will be to guidelines published at 50 Fed. Reg. 1786 (1985) and rules and regulations 
codified at 15 C.F.R. Part 325 (1985). These guidelines and regulations apply to all applications filed after January 11, 1985. The 
certification at issue in this case took place between October 30, 1984 and January 25, 1985. It was therefore covered by earlier 
guidelines published at 49 Fed. Reg. 15937 (1983), and rules and regulations published at 48 Fed. Reg. 10596 (1983)(to be 
codified at 15 C.F.R. Part 325(interim rules). There are no pertinent substantive differences between the earlier and later 
materials; however, the later materials provide a clearer and more detailed picture of the agencies' practices. "
808,4," As plaintiffs point out, it is somewhat anomalous to rely upon applicants to address antitrust concerns. An applicant intending to 
abuse an export certificate by engaging in anticompetitive domestic conduct is unlikely to reveal its motives or to supply 
information that might hinder its certification."
808,5," Purpose analysis necessarily would focus upon an applicant's avowed purposes, although it could embrace a determination of 
the applicant's credibility. See supra note 2. Such a credibility determination would rely upon inferences drawn from the likely 
effects of proposed conduct. Thus, the determination might be hindered by an applicant's reticence regarding possible 
anticompetitive effects of proposed conduct. See id. HN1[
]"
808,6," It appears that Congress intended the agencies' analysis to turn upon foreseeability of anticompetitive effects. The Act's 
legislative history includes numerous references to the concept of foreseeability. For example, the House Judiciary Committee 
envisioned ""a single, flexible criterion . . . . Rather than merely requiring a legal judgment as to whether the conduct would 
violate the antitrust laws, the standards call for a prediction of whether the conduct will be likely to violate the antitrust laws."" See "

original). The report of The House Committee on Foreign Affairs noted: The Committee expects the Secretary of Commerce . . . and the Attorney General . . . to examine carefully the possibility of 
any damage occurring to any other firms or entity in U.S. domestic commerce, and to deny such certification where any 
such damage is reasonably foreseeable . . . . H.R. Rep. No. 637(I), 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 15, reprinted in 1982 U.S.  Code Cong. & Ad. News 2431, 2437. It is also of note that the Act's provision of exemption of export conduct from the Sherman and Federal Trade Commission Acts 
utilizes a ""'direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect' test"" to identify eligibility for the exemption. See H.R. Rep. No. 
686, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 2, reprinted in 1982 U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News 2487, 2487-88."
809,7," HN2[
] ""Spillover"" effects are anticompetitive effects felt in the domestic price market caused by activities involved in joint exporting. See Comment, Limiting Spillover and Foreclosure Through Title III of the Export Trading Company Act of 1982, 52 
Fordham L. Rev. 1300, 1309-10 (1984). ""Foreclosure"" effects are the results of anticompetitive activities which reduce or 
eliminate competitors' opportunities. See id. at 1321."
809,8," The threshold test draws upon the Department of Justice's merger guidelines. An important tool utilized by those guidelines is 
the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (""HHI""), see Merger Guidelines, 49 Fed. Reg. 26823, 26830-31 (1984). The HHI is calculated 
by squaring the market share of each firm competing in a market and then summing the resulting numbers.  This calculation 
takes into account both the relative size and the distribution of firms in a market; it therefore yields a figure that expresses 
market concentration. Comparison of ""pre-merger"" and ""post-merger"" HHI figures measures any increase in concentration 
caused by the merger. See id. The Department of Justice assesses the likely anticompetitive effects of mergers by reference to a scale of HHI figures that 
reflects different degrees of anticompetitive potential. The Department's standards for horizontal mergers are: (a) Post-Merger HHI Below 1000. Markets in this region generally would be considered to be unconcentrated. . . . (b) Post-Merger HHI Between 1000 and 1800. . . . This region extends from the point at which the competitive concerns 
associated with concentration are raised to the point at which they become quite serious . . . . The Department . . . is 
unlikely to challenge a merger producing an increase in the HHI of less than 100 points. The Department is likely to 
challenge mergers in this region that produce an increase in the HHI of more than 100 points . . . . (c) Post-Merger HHI Above 1800. Markets in this region generally are considered to be highly concentrated. . . . The 
Department is unlikely, however, to challenge mergers producing an increase in the HHI of less than 50 points.  The 
Department is likely to challenge mergers in this region that produce an increase in the HHI of more than 50 points. . . . See id. at 26831. "
810,9," Such additional economic characteristics include: (1) the ease of entry into the market by other firms, (2) the ease with which firms in an industry can expand supply; (3) the homogeneity of a product across producers; (4) the existence of large buyers; (5) whether the participants have in the past effectively coordinated domestic price levels or output rates; and (6) whether domestic demand is stable or variable. See Revised Guidelines, 50 Fed. Reg. 1786, 1795 (1985)."
810,10," References to the administrative record will be indicated by the initials ""A.R."" and will note the specific pages to which I refer."
810,11," It has been noted that a balance between chlorine and caustic soda can be struck. Caustic soda production can be altered by 
raising or lowering chlorine demand and production; this can be accomplished to some extent by raising or lowering the price of 
chlorine. Otherwise, the price of caustic soda can be directly modified. A.R. at 515. Therefore, pricing can play an important role 
in the industry. It should be noted, however, that soda ash is to some degree a substitute for caustic soda. A.R. at 428-29. "
811,12," Plaintiffs dispute the contention that expedited review was necessitated by the schedule for negotiation of Australian contracts 
or the threat of Saudi production. According to plaintiffs, Australian contracts are negotiated throughout the year, and the Saudi 
Arabian plant was not completed by March or April of 1985. See Mercer Affidavit at para. 15. "
812,13," Chlor/Alkali's application was deemed submitted on November 1, 1984. Notice of Chlor/Alkali's application was published in 
the Federal Register on November 15, 1984, at 49 Fed. Reg. 45203 (1984). See A.R. at 574. The notice indicated that 
comments on the application were to be submitted by December 3, 1984. Id. Because the notice appeared before expedited 
review was withdrawn, it also indicated that Chlor/Alkali's request for expedited review had been granted and that interested 
parties' comments on the application would be due twenty days after the publication of the Federal Register notice. A.R. at 575. Plaintiffs complain that the agencies' provision of notice was faulty in several respects. First, they object to the timing of the 
publication on the ground that the Act calls for publication within ten days. See 15 U.S.C.A. ยง 4012(b)(1) (West Supp. 1985). 
Second, they complain that the twenty day comment period provided by the agencies was ""substantially"" shorter than ""the 
comment period that would have been provided under the normal ninety day application process."" The agencies take issue with the plaintiffs' characterization of the notice and comment procedures. With respect to publication, 
the defendants point out that the notice was submitted to the Federal Register for publication on November 9, 1984. Because 
the Secretary cannot control the Federal Register's publication schedule but can control submission dates, defendants conclude 
that submission on November 9 and subsequent publication on November 15 complies with the Act's requirements. As for the 
comment period, defendants contend that the twenty day period is the rule for all applications, pursuant to regulations 
promulgated under the Act. See 15 C.F.R. 325.5(b) (1985); see also Interim Regulations, 48 Fed. Reg. 10602 (1983). Defendants are correct that the regulations provide for a twenty day comment period. Moreover, the actual comment period 
given by the agencies was November 15 through December 3, or eighteen days. The proximity of that period to the twenty days 
provided by the statute, together with the fact that neither plaintiffs nor anyone else submitted comments to the agencies, tends 
to reduce the significance of plaintiffs' objections. These observations do not affect the merits of this case, because plaintiffs' failure or inability to comment does not affect their 
standing to bring this suit. The Act provides that ""any party"" aggrieved by certification procedures may bring an action to set 
aside the determination. See 15 U.S.C.A. ยง 4015(a)(emphasis added). "
814,14," Defendants argue that the bill originally passed by the House demonstrates a legislative intent to insulate the Attorney 
General's actions from review. That bill placed certification entirely in the hands of the Attorney General and precluded review of 
the Attorney General's determinations regarding issuance, amendment, or revocation of a certificate. See H.R. Rep. No. 637 (II), 
97th Cong., 2d Sess. 21, reprinted in 1982 U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News 2444, 2458. This argument is not persuasive. The House version entirely precluded judicial review of grants or denials of certification, while 
the final statute does not. Such a significant difference negates the inference that any part of the House's intentions with respect 
to review remains viable.  Moreover, the basis of the House bill was not a desire to protect the Attorney General from review; 
rather, it was ""to protect the certificate holder's interest and promote imports."" See id. Such protection obviously depends upon 
preclusion of all review. The final statute does not preclude all review. Thus, the original House bill does not support preclusion 
of judicial review of the Attorney General's actions under the final statute. "
816,15," The Webb-Pomerene Export Trade Act, codified in its present form at 15 U.S.C. ยงยง 61-66 (1982), permits United States 
exporters to join together to engage in export trade activity free of the Sherman Act, provided that they comply with the Webb-
Pomerene Act's provisions. Perceived inadequacies in the Webb-Pomerene Act were an impetus to the Export Trading 
Company Act. See generally, H.R. Rep. No. 637 (I), 97th Conb., 2d Sess. 1-16, reprinted in 1982 U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News

817,16," On April 24, 1985, I issued an order denying defendants' motion for a protective order and permitting the plaintiffs to engage in 
discovery. My order held:"
817,1," . The Court should not determine whether the Secretary's determination was 'erroneous' regarding the requirements of 
Section 4013(a)(1)(2)(3) without seeing the results of the discovery."
817,2," . The discovery is necessary to determine how to apply Congress' intent that ""normally"" the administrative record alone is 
adequate for purposes of judicial review, i.e., whether, in light of the facts soug't in discovery, this is an exceptional case 
requiring that the administrative record be supplemented with additional evidence."
817,3," . Balancing the burdens of the discovery, the need for prompt, meaningful and efficient judicial review and recognizing the 
possibility that the discovery may indeed be wasted motion in the end, the Court concludes that the more efficient way to 
proceed is to conclude discovery within sixty days and then litigate the legal issues with the appropriate factual base (be it "
818,," the administrative record alone or as supplemented) rather than argue legal issues in the abstract on an administrative 
record which one side contends is incomplete."
818,4," . The need for certainty that judicial review has been upon a complete record outweighs the short run efficiencies of 
shutting-off discovery at the start of the case."
818,17," Mr. Edwards also stated that he has developed close personal relationships with competitors' marketing personnel, and that 
he had ""continuing communications and contacts with his competitors throughout at least the last ten years, including 
representatives of Goodrich and Occidental."" See Plaintiffs' Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants' Motion For Summary 
Judgment at 70. In contrast to Edwards' description of price-related communications, the existence of such relationships and 
communications does not in itself suggest that Edwards and others engaged in price-fixing activities. It does provide 
circumstantial evidence regarding the likelihood of such activities, however."

Judgment, counsel for the defendants noted that the case had been dismissed. Plaintiffs responded that the matter is not yet

821,20," The ""other factors"" listed in the Export Trading Company Act guidelines are: (1) the ease of entry into the market by other firms, (2) the ease with which firms in an industry can expand supply; (3) the homogeneity of a product across producers; (4) the existence of large buyers; (5) whether the participants have in the past effectively coordinated domestic price levels or output rates; and (6) whether domestic demand is stable or variable. See Revised Guidelines, 50 Fed. Reg. 1786, 1795 (1985). The Justice Department's merger guidelines enumerate a variety of similar factors. These include the homogeneity of the 
product, the degree of difference between the products and locations in the market and next best substitutes, the distance 
between the sellers and the next-most-distant seller, the similarities and differences in the products and locations of the merging 
firms, information about specific transactions and buyer market characteristics, the ability of small or fringe sellers to increase 
sales, the conduct of firms in the market, market performance, and efficiencies. See Merger Guidelines, 49 Fed. Reg. 26823,

for criminal contempt should certainly not issue. In terms of the analysis under the standard for criminal contempt, which the 
Court considers in the alternative from the civil contempt evaluation, respondents' sworn explanations suggest, at the worst, a

858,2," The language of the 1984 Act is inclusive and not exclusive, defining a ""local government"" as ""a school district, sanitary district, 
or any other special function governmental unit established by State law in one or more States."" 1984 Act ยง 2(1)(B) (emphasis 
added). The report of the House Committee on the Judiciary, H.R. Rep. No. 98-965, 98th Cong., 2d Sess, reprinted in 1984 U.S. 
Code Cong. & Ad. News 4602 [hereinafter cited as House Rep.], in reporting to the House the predecessor bill to the 1984 Act, 
H.R. 6027 (defining ""local government"" as a ""city, county, parish, town, township, village, school district, sanitary district, or any 
other general or special purpose political subdivision of one or more States"") says further that Examples of special purpose political subdivisions included within the definition are planning districts, water districts, sewer 
districts, irrigation districts, drainage districts, road districts, and mosquito control districts. Such a subdivision would have a 
geographic jurisdiction that is not contiguous with, and is generally substantially smaller than, that of the State that 
established it. The definition, however, would encompass special purpose governmental units that operate in more than 
one State. For example, regional planning boards, environmental organizations, or airport or port authorities may be 
established in two or more States. ""'Special purpose "" subdivisions of States should not be read to include largely private regulatory bodies that operate with 
the sanction of a local government. . . . [A] group such as a county or city bar association, dental association or medical 
association that regulates entry and enforces professional ethics is not a local governmental unit. Id. at 19-20. The report by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, reporting the Senate version of H.R. 6027, S. 1578, is also 
noteworthy: It is important to note that the damage protection afforded private parties . . . is not applicable if their liability arises from 
activity involving the 'purchase or sale of goods or services' on a commercial basis by the unit of local government in 
competition with private persons. Thus, if a city operates its own ambulance service on a commercial basis in competition 
with three private ambulance companies, and all conspire to fix prices, the three private companies may be subject to treble 
damages. The city itself would, however, remain subject to injunctive remedy only. S. Rep. No. 98-593, 98th Cong., 2d Sess., reprinted in [July-Dec.] Antitrust & Trade Reg. Rep. (BNA) No. 1179 at 379, 381 (Aug. 
23, 1984) [hereinafter cited as Senate Rep.]. Desert argues that its creation and regulation pursuant to California statute, Cal. Health & Safety Code ยงยง 23000-32492, and its 
performance of a public function by protecting public health and welfare through furnishing hospital services in areas with 
inadequate care, see Talley v. Northern San Diego Hospital District, 41 Cal. 2d 33, 40, 257 P.2d 22, 29 (1953) renders it a 
""special function governmental unit"" for purposes of the 1984 Act.  Plaintiffs did not address this point in their papers or in oral 
argument. At least one case has applied the 1984 Act to a city hospital building authority, which, like a hospital district, is a 
special function governmental unit performing functions traditionally performed by private parties. Huron Valley Hospital v. City of 
Pontiac, 612 F. Supp. 654, 664-65 (E. D. Mich. 1985). "
859,3," Nowhere in its Complaint does PSMC allege that Desert acted outside its official capacity. Cal. Health & Safety Code ยง 32128 
provides that the rules of a district hospital established by a hospital district board of directors ""shall include . . . provision for the 
organization of physicians and surgeons . . . licensed to practice in this state who are permitted to practice in the hospital into a 
formal medical staff"" and ""provision for procedure for appointment and reappointment of medical staff as provided by the 
standards of the Joint Committee on Accreditation of Hospitals."" Likewise, Cal. Health & Safety Code ยง 32121 provides that the 
local hospital district may ""purchase, receive, have, take, hold, lease, use and enjoy property of every kind and description within 
the limits of the district,"" ""do any and all things which an individual might do which is necessary for and to the advantage of a 
hospital,"" and ""establish, maintain, and operate one or more hospitals, situated within the territorial limits of the district."" PSMC would read into the ""official capacity"" language of the 1984 Act a requirement that the local government act in good faith 
in exercising its official authority. The House Committee report accompanying H.R. 6027 supports that interpretation: The definition of official conduct allows room for good faith errors by local government officials in conducting the public 
business. Conduct falls within the definition if the actor 'could reasonably have construed' his actions to be within the 
authority of the local government. . . . On the other hand, participation in criminal acts, or other behavior clearly falling 
outside a local government's authority, would fall outside the definition of official conduct. House Rep. at 20. H.R. 6027, however, differed in significant respects from the Senate version, S. 1578, which conferred 
blanket immunity from damages on local governments. Discussion in the House following the conference committee's report on 
the compromise bill between the House and Senate versions of H.R. 6027 reveals that the House came to contemplate 
protection for local governments in all aspects of decision-making and exercising of authority: Competition is important in free enterprise and the operation of our economic system. When you move over to 
governmental decisions, then the competitive factor is not relevant, really, or far less relevant than environmental 
considerations, health considerations, safety considerations, and a whole panoply of issues that a governmental body must 
take into consideration in its judgments allocating contracts, access to sewer lines, zoning, and things like that. So it is clear that the antitrust laws ought to be inapplicable to governmental decisions certainly in their most harsh aspect 
and that is treble damages for governmental decisions. The problem is governments make decisions, State governments 
and local governments, based on their best judgment on a range of considerations that are not contemplated by antitrust 
laws. So the antitrust law is a square peg trying to be forced into the round hole of government operation. This remedy is 
very much needed. "
860,130," Cong. Rec. at H12183 (statement of Rep. Hyde). Other discussions in the House and Senate reveal concern for the 
paralyzing effect that antitrust damage liability would have on local government decisionmaking. See note 4 infra. Thus, even if 
the Court were to read an ""official capacity"" limitation into the 1984 Act's immunity for local governments, it would constrain that 
limitation to all decisions made by a local government in an ""official capacity,"" and not just those made in good faith, in order to 
give effect to the Congressional purpose. While a hospital district may abuse or improperly exercise its powers under the state 
Health & Safety Code, see, e.g.  Rosner v. Eden Township Hospital District, 58 Cal. 2d 592, 598-99, 375 P.2d 431, 434-35, 25 
Cal. Rptr. 551, 554-55 (1962), that does not mean automatically that a hospital district acts outside its ""official capacity"" as that 
term was ultimately understood by Congress."
860,4," PSMC contended in oral argument that because the 1984 Act was passed in response to Boulder, its sole purpose was to 
overrule Boulder. Under this theory, the 1984 Act would immunize local governments only when their actions are within their 
lawful authority granted by the state and pursuant to a ""clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed"" state policy.  Boulder, 455 
U.S. at 51. To say that the 1984 Act was sparked by Boulder, however, is not to say that its sole purpose was to overrule 
Boulder. Both the House and Senate Committees on the Judiciary, in reporting H.R. 6027 and S. 1578 to their respective 
chambers, reflected a concern over the increasing number of lawsuits and large damage awards against local governments 
spawned by Boulder and City of Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., 435 U.S. 389, 55 L. Ed. 2d 364, 98 S. Ct. 1123 (1978) 
""that could undermine a local government's ability to govern in the public interest."" House Rep. at 2; see also id. at 10 (citing 
Unity Ventures v. County of Lake, No. 81 C-2745 (N. D. Ill. 1984), in which $ 28.5 million in damages, after trebling, was 
awarded by a jury against a county and village). The Senate Committee stated: It would appear that in many instances, the practical impact of Boulder . . . has been to paralyze the decisionmaking 
functions of local government. The threat of antitrust treble damage actions has caused local officials to avoid decisions 
that may touch on the antitrust laws even when such decisions have involved critical public services. Furthermore, it would 
also appear that uncertainty of whether particular actions may be anticompetitive might have lead to the making of no 
decision at all, resulting in, for example, the inclusion of all bidders in a franchise, rather than choosing the most economical 
and efficient bidder. In either case, where a local government has avoided the issue or where it has simply allowed all 
comers to participate, the public interest may not have been well-served. In addition the Committee is concerned by delays 
in the decisionmaking process during the pendency of time-consuming and costly antitrust damage litigation. "
861,," Senate Rep., reprinted in [July-Dec.] Antitrust & Trade Reg. Rep. (BNA) No. 1179 at 379. S. 1578 as originally introduced would 
have bestowed a local government antitrust immunity comparable to that of state governments under Parker; but S. 1578 as 
reported, rather than ""address[ing] the basic application of the antitrust laws to local governments,"" left Boulder unchanged and 
""altered the antitrust remedies available against local governments, or against private parties acting at the direction of local 
governments,"" by ""flatly prohibit[ing] any award of damages."" Id. at 380.  It was ""inappropriate to assess damages which 
ultimately must be borne by taxpayers,"" regardless of whether the local government had violated the antitrust laws, and the 
Senate Committee was further ""aware of the tremendous financial burden which can be placed on local governments in merely 
defending antitrust suits regardless of the outcome."" Id. This purpose was much broader than that of H.R. 6027, which, as 
reported by the House Committee, did extend ""protection against [treble] damage suits . . . to local governments if they act within 
their authority, dispensing with the test in [Boulder] that a local government act in every instance pursuant to a 'clearly articulated 
and affirmatively expressed' state policy."" House Rep. at 2. The language of the 1984 Act reflects that of S. 1578, with its blanket 
immunity for local governments, and not that of H.R. 6207, and the House passed the final version after it came back from 
conference while distinguishing between blanket immunity for local governments and ""official capacity"" immunity for officials. 
See, e.g., 130 Cong. Rec. at H12188 (statement of Rep. Rodino). Representative Hyde, in urging passage of the final version of 
H.R. 6027, further spoke of the ""ticking bomb"" left by Boulder which was to be remedied by the legislation. Similarly, during the 
Senate passage of H.R. 6027 as reported by the conference committee, Senator Thurmond stated: This legislation brings much-needed order and certainty to our Federal antitrust laws as they apply to local governments. 
Needless to say, local governments throughout the country have lived in the shadow of [Boulder], and it is time that the 
Congress answers at least one major question that Boulder raised: Whether both local governments and nongovernmental 
parties, acting at the direction of local governments, should be liable for treble damages. Id. at S14364 (statement of Sen. Thurmond). Senator Moynihan, after noting the large number of antitrust damage suits filed 
against local governments after Boulder and their paralyzing effect on decisionmaking, urged passage of the legislation as 
""balancing the need of local governments to provide essential services -- without the fear of lawsuits -- and the right of aggrieved 
parties to seek injunctive relief against cities."" Id. at S14367 (statement of Sen. Moynihan). The purpose of the bill as applied to local governments, then, was to eliminate the financial burden and decisionmaking paralysis 
caused by the threat of treble damage antitrust suits, and not merely to overrule Boulder."
861,5," PSMC also points to several comments by representatives during the consideration of the original H.R. 6027 and of the final 
conference bill in support of its ""official capacity"" theory regarding local government immunity. At most, these were off-hand 
comments that scarcely reflected substantive consideration of what the bill was intended to do. See, e.g., 130 Cong. Rec. at 
H12175 (H. Res. 616) (by which House waived its rules to allow expedited consideration of the conference report on H.R. 6027, 
referring to it as ""the bill . . . to clarify the application of the Clayton Act to the official conduct of local governments""); H. Conf. 
Rep.  No. 98-1158, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. (1984), reprinted in 1984 U.S. Code Cong.  & Ad. News 4626 (conference committee, 
in reporting H.R. 6027 to House and Senate, referred to the ""bill . . . clarify[ing] the application of the Federal antitrust laws to the 
official conduct of local governments""); 130 Cong.  Rec. at H12176 (statement of Rep. Rodino) (in which Representative Rodino, 
calling up the conference report pursuant to H. Res. 616, referred to the bill ""to clarify the application of the Clayton Act to official 
conduct of local governments""). "
864,6," PSMC in its opposition papers also quotes several statements by representatives during the October 11, 1984 session, in 
which they address the problem of the 1984 Act's applicability to pending cases, as support for its proposition that the 1984 Act 
was intended only to apply to local government action within its lawful authority. See 130 Cong. Rec. at H12183-86. Those 
statements pertained, as PSMC acknowledges, to the equities of applying the 1984 Act to pending cases. The instant action, 
filed on September 18, 1985, was not pending when the 1984 Act was passed, and these statements are inapposite. "
872,1," No evidence was adduced at trial regarding the claims of Plaintiffs Sukovitch and Kudlas, who apparently are graduates of 
Sherman College and practicing chiropractors. The motion to dismiss of Defendant American Chiropractic Association was 
granted at the close of Plaintiff's evidence. Judgment was entered in favor of Dr. Williams in a separate order entered April 16, 
1985. "
873,2," In 1974, CCE secured recognition as a nationally recognized accrediting agency by the United States Office of Education 
(""USOE""), the predecessor to the present Department of Education. CCE was determined to be a ""reliable authority as to the 
quality of training offered"" by educational institutions. See 20 U.S.C. ยง 1141(a). The principal purpose of federal recognition is to 
establish a mechanism for screening schools for participation in federal aid programs. See 34 C.F.R. ยง 603.1. CCE's recognition 
was renewed in 1975, 1979 and 1982, and will be up for renewal again in 1986. In 1979, Sherman College challenged the USOE's renewal of CCE's recognition on the grounds that CCE failed to represent the 
profession as a whole. The renewal was subsequently upheld by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. 
See Sherman College of Straight Chiropractic v. United States Commissioner of Education, 493 F. Supp. 976 (D.D.C. 1980). 
CCE was also approved as an accrediting agency by the council on Post Secondary Accreditation (""COPA"") in 1976. COPA is a 
private, nonprofit association of accrediting agencies and national higher education associations, which endeavors to promote 
quality in the accreditation process by reviewing and approving accrediting agencies. COPA renewed CCE's approval in 1982."
873,3," Despite its rejection by CCE, Sherman is clearly a substantial educational institution, dedicated to giving its students a quality 
chiropractic education within the parameters of its chiropractic philosophy. The court also found Sherman's founder and 
president, Dr.  Thomas A. Gelardi, to be a person of high intelligence and integrity. Sherman College has been fully accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, a regional accrediting agency, 
since December of 1984. Sherman also has candidate status with Plaintiff SCASA, the Straight Chiropractic Academic 
Standards Association, Inc. Although accreditation with these organizations increases the prestige of Sherman's program, such 
endorsements generally do not help Sherman's graduates to become licensed chiropractors because of the regulatory choices 
made by the state licensing boards. (See discussion in text at slip op. pp. 4-5, infra). SCASA is an accrediting agency formed in 1978, with Sherman college and Pennsylvania College of Straight Chiropractic 
(formerly Adio Institute) as founding members. SCASA has not made application to the USOE or to COPA for recognition. SCASA has sought recognition as an accrediting agency for chiropractic colleges from a number of states. It has received 
recognition as of today only from the District of Columbia. CCE testified against SCASA at several state hearings on approval of 
SCASA, including New Hampshire, South Carolina and the District of Columbia. Both USOE and COPA will entertain applications from more than one accrediting agency in a particular professional field. COPA 
currently recognizes two accrediting agencies in legal education, as well as two accrediting agencies in the field of medical 
assistance and medical technology. The evidence indicated that dual recognition for both CCE and SCASA would be unlikely but 
it is possible. "
874,4, Plaintiffs contend FCLB conspired with Defendants but FCLB is not a Defendant in this action.
874,5," For example, Dr. Vern R. Webster was vice president of the FCLB from 1972 through 1977, and president from 1977 through 
1979. He was also a director of the NBCE from 1975 through 1979, and has occupied that position since 1981 as well. 
Furthermore, Dr. Webster was a member of the Commission on Accreditation of the CCE from approximately December of 1978 
through February of 1981. Dr. James A. Mertz served as vice president of the FCLB from 1974 to 1975, and as president from 1975 through 1976. Dr. 
Mertz was vice president of the CCE in 1976, and president in 1977 and 1978. He also served as a member of the Commission 
on Accreditation of the CCE from July of 1974 through December of 1982, serving as chairman of the Commission the last two 
years. While president of the FCLB, Dr. Mertz also served as a director on the NBCE."
874,6," NBCE points out that this request was initiated by the members of certain state chiropractic licensing boards. They threatened 
to stop using the NBCE exam for licensure purposes unless graduates of anti-diagnostic schools were denied permission to take 
the exam. This fact is evidence which shows that at least some chiropractic licensing boards were actively involved in assisting 
the pro-diagnostic group. "
875,7," The parties did not address the issue of whether the administration of general diagnostic tests by chiropractors would or does 
violate scope-of-practice limitations in the various states."
875,8, Sherman college is presently one of two anti-diagnostic chiropractic colleges in the United States.

889,2," These three-party dealings generally are known as ""on-us"" transactions. Since no interchange occurs, no fee is charged in ""on-

merchants were recruited only by Bank of America. The BankAmericard gave way to VISA in 1977. ""On-us"" transactions often 
occur even when several banks issue cards and sign merchants because the same bank that issued the card may have signed 
the merchant to accept the card. Obviously, this would occur most often in a card-issuing bank's surrounding community. "

VISA members.  NaBanco, 596 F. Supp. at 1239-40. The district court properly held that NaBanco had standing to pursue this

restraint was imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable. The history of the restraint, the evil 
believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, are all relevant

Catalano, Inc. v. Target Sales, Inc., 446 U.S. 643, 100 S. Ct. 1925, 64 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1980). The Court also refused to extend 
BMI to the NCAA. See NCAA v. Board of Regents of University of Oklahoma, 468 U.S. 85, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70 
(1984). Similarly, the former Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals addressed BMI's availability only on one occasion, and refused to find 
it applicable. See United States v. Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc., 672 F.2d 469, 479-80 (5th Cir. Unit B 1982), "

895,13," From an economist's viewpoint, the VISA IRF may not even qualify as a ""price,"" because it would be driven upward by 
unrestrained competition. See Baxter Deposition, Vol. I, at 57 (Feb. 25, 1981). Professor Baxter, who appeared as a witness for 
VISA, subsequently published his research in bank transactional paper. See Baxter, Bank Interchange of Transactional Paper: 
Legal and Economic Perspectives, 26 J.L. & Econ. 541 (1981). The article includes an excellent explanation of the economic 
arguments favoring an interchange fee of some sort. It concludes that the economics of the system indicate that interchange 
fees are not horizontal price fixing, but rather act as equilibratory devices necessary to avoid ""chaotic results . . . higher fees and 
instability within card systems."" Id. at 586. In Baxter's opinion, such a fee is legally valid so long as all members of a four-party 
payment system have the option to bypass the required fee and negotiate their own fee. Id. See In Re UATP -- 1976, 85-11 
C.A.B. 2481, 2506 (1980). As mentioned earlier, the Base II system is not mandatory and may be bypassed if the VISA 
members so choose."
895,14," Commentators have approved the result in Catalano while criticizing its economics. See W. Liebler, Antitrust Adviser, 30-31 
(2d ed. 1984); P. Areeda, supra n.8 at 33-34."
895,15," One commentator maintains that the Court's position in Maricopa ""made it impossible for the majority to articulate a principled 
explanation of the Court's unanimous decision in [BMI]."" W. Liebeler, supra note 14 at 35. See generally Maricopa, 457 U.S. at

896,16," The various VISA members neither share profits and losses nor commingle management functions. Each member also 
competes actively against other members in a variety of ways. This results in merchant-signing banks competing with card-
issuing banks to enroll cardholders. See NaBanco, 596 F. Supp. at 1253."
896,17," NaBanco repeatedly stresses that each VISA member, not VISA, issues the individual plastic cards and receives all proceeds 
from individual transactions. Thus, VISA ""produces"" no true "" product"" according to NaBanco. The VISA product, however, is not the plastic card itself, but the rules and regulations among the various VISA members that 
thereby create a national payment system. This universal system is the true product of VISA; the plastic card merely embodies 
that product."

its product.  NaBanco, 596 F. Supp. at 1253. "

to NaBanco the relevant market is credit card processing services. We do not reach this issue since the market in these 
particular circumstances is the same, whether viewed from the plaintiff's, defendant's or consumer's perspective. "
942,1," Ordinance No. 47656, codified as Chapter 8, Code of General Ordinances of Kansas City, Missouri, entitled ""Massage Shops, 
Nude Modeling Studios and Artists - Body Painting,"" enacted May 6, 1977."
942,2," On May 22, 1985, the City Council eliminated the Board of Massage Examiners and vested the authority it had previously

943,3," The affidavit submitted on behalf of JBK in connection with the present motion makes clear that ""J.B.K. Corporation"" and ""JBK, 
Inc."" are one and the same corporate entity. Which is the proper corporate name is something I need not address at the 
moment. "
945,4," I acknowledge the theoretical - although unlikely - possibility that the parties' unusual method of submitting their earlier 
controversy to the state court involved an agreement that JBK would be permitted to ""split"" its claims on that cause of action, 
reserving for some later forum those not specifically identified in the two stipulations. See generally RESTATEMENT (SECOND) 
OF JUDGMENTS, supra ยง 26 (1) (a). It would, however, be JBK's burden to establish that fact, and it has offered neither any 
proof nor even any suggestion that such was the case."
945,5," In the abstract at least, this ruling would extend only to a claim that the ""taking"" arose from the facial provisions of the 
ordinance, leaving the possibility of a ""taking"" which arose in connection with discriminatory enforcement. There is, however, no 
reason to strain constitutional theory by attempting to predicate a ""taking"" claim upon the latter basis. As pointed out in Part III 
hereof, a ""taking"" claim of any variety would present no more than a pendent state claim for inverse condemnation in any event. 
Further, if JBK can prove its discriminatory enforcement claims, it will receive its full measure of damages in a straightforward 
fashion under ยง 1983 and the Equal Protection Clause. There is, in these circumstances, no reason to leave pending some 
theoretical but useless vestige of its ""taking"" claim."
945,6," Whether those ""transactions"" could be considered a ""connected series of transactions,"" see RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF 
JUDGMENTS, supra ยง 24, with respect to the enactment of the ordinance is something that cannot be determined upon the 
present record."
945,7," To put the matter another way, it is unclear whether the parties' stipulations had the effect of ""withdrawing"" all issues other than 
those associated with enactment of the ordinance, thereby accomplishing, in effect, a dismissal without prejudice of those other 
issues. See generally Hart-Bartlett-Sturtevant Grain Co. v. Aetna Ins. Co., 365 Mo. 1134, 293 S.W. 2d 913, 929 (1956), cert.

946,8, Plaintiffs are now also represented by an additional attorney who was not present in the state court litigation.
946,9," The question was squarely presented in Siebert, but left unruled.  Certain language in the opinion, however, would appear to 
support limiting the doctrine in this way. There are, in addition, substantial policy reasons for such a limitation. "
947,10," HN7[
] Section 8.8(g) provides that businesses covered by the ordinance shall operate only between the hours of 6:00 a.m. 
and 12:00 midnight."
947,11," Plaintiffs will, however, be directed to identify specifically, by ordinance section or subsection, any other provisions they 
challenge under this theory, within fifteen days of the date of this order, so that all such other matters may be promptly 
addressed. "
948,12," Plaintiffs have also attached a copy of one of the examinations actually given. I do not decide here whether that examination 
might be subject to any of the arguments plaintiffs make: such a matter represents an application of the ordinance (which, itself, 
specifies only general subjects for the examination); and given the fact that there were apparently a number of different 
examinations given at different times, I believe the subject is better left to future resolution upon a more developed record. "
949,13," The only definition of ""recreational massage"" contained in any of plaintiffs' affidavits is that offered by J. Diane Byrne, and is 
singularly unhelpful: ""recreational massages are traditional types of massages given in private relaxing surroundings. Those . . . 
practicing recreational massage, do not treat illness or injury nor do they perform physical therapy or hydrotherapy for the 
treatment of illness or injury."" "
950,14," I note plaintiffs' citations to Myrick v. Board of Pierce City Comm'rs, 101 Wash. 2d 140, 677 P. 2d 140 (1984), and Pentco, Inc. 
v. Moody, 474 F. Supp. 1001 (S.D. Ohio 1978). In the former case, the Washington Supreme Court's holdings appear to be 
premised solely upon its construction of the Washington state constitution. A state is quite free, of course, to construe its own 
constitutional provisions as it sees fit; but I have no obligation to give such rulings any particular weight in dealing with provisions 
- even counterpart provisions - of the Federal Constitution. As to the latter case, I can say only - although with respect - that I 
believe it accords considerably less deference to legislative decisions of the present sort than is mandated by current Supreme 
Court constructions of the Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clause. "
951,15," As nearly as I can determine, the theory of the claim is that if one has been issued a massagist license by the county (here, 
presumably, Jackson County), it is a violation of ยง 2 of article IV if the city fails to ""grant reciprocity."" If so, the claim obviously 
does not involve a discriminatory treatment of the residents of some other state by the State of Missouri, or even by the City; 
rather it implicates relations between two subordinate governmental units of the same state, and the treatment accorded to 
persons who are residents of the same state. Article IV, ยง 2 has no application to that situation.  United Bldg. & Constr. Trades v. 
Mayor, 465 U.S. 208, 217, 79 L. Ed. 2d 249, 104 S. Ct. 1020 (1984); Slaughter-House Cases, 83 U.S. 36, 16 Wall. 36, 77, 21 L. 
Ed. 394 (1873). Accordingly, the only persons having standing to assert a ""reciprocity"" argument of the nature made here would 
be massagists licensed and residing in some state other than Missouri. There is no indication that any of the present plaintiffs 
are thus situated. "
960,1," The validity of distinction between vertical price restraints and non-price restraints has been the subject of scholarly discussion.

the per se rule against vertical price restraints.  Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park & Sons Co., 220 U.S. 373, 31 S. Ct. 376, 
55 L. Ed. 502 (1911). Our resolution of this case makes it unnecessary for us to reach or rule on Sharp's contention."
961,2,"  Dealer complaining is likely whenever there is discounting by free riders, because most dealers are harmed by such 
conduct. The manufacturers cannot prevent the complaining. Yet if it occurs the manufacturer may have to abandon even 
nonprice restrictions in distribution, because any action it takes against a discounter may be deemed to be tainted by price-
fixing. Posner, The Next Step, supra note 1, at 13. "
962,3," If, on retrial, the district court again chooses to use special interrogatories, it may wish to follow either the form of the first 
interrogatory in Monsanto, 465 U.S. 752, n.2, 104 S. Ct. 1464, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775 or the bifurcated form of the first and second

975,1," Presumably, Lady Foot bases this motion on Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Lady Foot has combined its 
motion, however, with an extensive affidavit purporting to show plaintiffs' inability to prove certain allegations in their complaint. 
The court could chose to consider this extrinsic source of information but would be required to treat the motion as one for 
summary judgment and afford the plaintiffs a reasonable opportunity to present opposing material. See J.M. Mechanical Corp. v. 
United States, 716 F.2d 190, 196-97 (3d Cir. 1983); Federal R. Civ. P. 12(b). At this point, it would be premature to consider defendant's motion as one for summary judgment. Neither side has had an 
opportunity for full discovery. Accordingly, I will treat Lady Foot's motion as one pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) and will disregard at 
this time matters outside the pleadings proffered by Lady Foot. "

1002,1," Cardiology involves the diagnosis and treatment of persons with heart disease. In this area, physicians employ procedures that 
are termed ""invasive"" or ""non-invasive,"" depending on whether an actual invasion of the patient's body is required. For example, 
an electrocardiogram (EKG) is a non-invasive diagnostic procedure, while a heart catheterization, involving insertion of a 
catheter into the body to examine the heart, is classified as an invasive technique."

1003,3," Defendants filed an untimely notice of appeal wherein they challenged the lower court's ruling as to jurisdiction. Plaintiffs 
responded with a motion to dismiss defendants' appeal as untimely. The motion has been referred to this panel. Although 
plaintiff's motion is technically correct, dismissal of defendants' appeal as untimely becomes an exercise in futility because the 
issue of subject matter jurisdiction is threshold to the court's authority to invoke its jurisdiction to proceed with an action. Subject "
1004,," matter jurisdiction may be contested at any and all stages of the proceedings, even after judgment and may be addressed by the 
court sua sponte. "
1005,4," The Furlong court's interpretation of McLain as requiring plaintiff to allege sufficient facts that the defendants' purported illegal 
activity itself have a ""not insubstantial effect on interstate commerce"" (as opposed to focusing, as did the court below, upon the 
defendants' business in general to find the interstate nexus) was cited approvingly by this circuit in McElhinney v. The Medical 
Protective Co., et al., 738 F.2d 439 (6th Cir. 1984). However, that decision, which reversed the trial court's conclusion that 
defendants' general interstate transactions satisfied the criteria, was not published, and therefore is not precedent within this 
circuit. See Sixth Circuit Rule 24(B); U.S. v. Eckman, 581 F.2d 587, 588 (6th Cir. 1978) (per curiam) (unreported decision only 
binding if res judicata to present appeal)."
1005,5," Judge Martin's concurrence would affirm the trial court's motion for summary judgment on the theory that no antitrust injury was 
proved. Initially, I seriously question this court's inherent authority to affirm the district court's award of summary judgment on 
issues that were not addressed by the district court nor assigned as error, briefed or argued before this court. To support its 
conclusion, the concurrence cites to County of Oakland v. City Berkley, 742 F.2d 289, 298 (6th Cir. 1984) and Herm v. Stafford, 
663 F.2d 669, 684 (6th Cir. 1981). The controlling language of Herm is as follows: an appellate court can find an alternative basis for concluding that a party is entitled to summary judgment . . . provided it 
proceeds carefully so the opposing party is not denied an opportunity to respond to the new theory. In the instant case the concurrence contends that the plaintiff was not denied an opportunity to respond to the injury theory 
because that issue had been raised in the trial court. However, a review of the record in this appellate proceeding fails to 
disclose that the defendants joined the issue of no injury as an assignment of error or that the plaintiff responded or had an 
opportunity to respond to the argument before this court. An examination of the record before the trial court concerning the 
motion for summary judgment reflects that the issue of antitrust injury and damage was properly joined by the pleadings and by 
the defendants' affirmative assertions which were specifically denied by the plaintiffs. Moreover, the plaintiff supported his 
allegations with documentary evidence including the deposition testimony of his expert witness Dr. Paul Feldstein. J. App. 331. 
Although only one page of Dr. Feldstein's testimony is incorporated into the record, the following synopsis of that testimony 
outlined in the plaintiff's brief in opposition to the motion for summary judgment states: (b) Patient Market After two hearings before this Court, plaintiff obtained patient origin zip code data showing the residence of patients who 
were treated for cardiological problems at 18 Detroit area hospitals having catheterization facilities. Plaintiff's expert, Dr. 
Paul Feldstein, Ph.D., was questioned about this data during his recent deposition. Dr. Feldstein testified that there is an 
area consisting of approximately 15 zip codes from which most of the patients utilize Beaumont Hospital for cardiologic 
difficulties. In Dr. Feldstein's opinion, Dr. Stone cannot hope to treat patients residing in this market area unless he obtains 
staff privileges at Beaumont Hospital (Feldstein Tr. 1:24). Plaintiff intends to utilize this data at trial to establish, through 
expert testimony, that there is a distinct market of cardiology patients served by Beaumont Hospital and Drs. Gordon and 
Timmis. In addition, plaintiff will produce data showing that although Beaumont and Harper Hospitals are relatively equal in 
size, in 1980 the volume of cardiac diagnoses at Beaumont was nearly twice that at Harper. "
1006,," Because defendants have not seen plaintiff's statistical data, they certainly cannot assert to this Court that the data is 
incorrect or that the conclusions drawn by plaintiff's expert are erroneous. In any event, definition of market based on the 
submissions of the respective parties must await trial, inasmuch as it presents a factual issue to be resolved. (See, e.g., 
FTC v. Rhinechem Corp., 459 F. Supp. 785, 788 (N.D. Ill., 1978) (""The definition of relevant product market is a factual 
question""). *"
1006,*," See also Borden, Inc. v. FTC, 674 F.2d 498 (6th Cir. 1982), wherein the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals stated that ""Only a 
careful factual analysis of the market in question will reveal whether monopoly power, in fact, exists."" Id. 510. Instead, defendants hope to skirt the issue by stating merely that Crittenton Hospital serves the same type of patients as are 
treated at Beaumont Hospital. However, this is not the same thing as saying that Crittenton Hospital services the same patient 
population. In point of fact, plaintiff's patient origin zip code data establishes conclusively that Beaumont Hospital and Crittenton 
Hospital service separate and distinct markets of cardiac patients. J. App. 123-124. The conflicts of fact as to the material issue of antitrust injury and damage are demonstrated by the foregoing summary of the 
plaintiff's challenge to the defendants' assertions on the issue. Essentially, plaintiff claimed damages for being denied access to 
a separate and distinct market of cardiac patients served by Beaumont. It is apparent that where, as here, the record reveals the 
existence of material issues of fact bearing on the presence or absence of an antitrust injury, summary judgment is 
inappropriate. The concurrence would not only invade a province of the jury, but endorse the highly disfavored practice of 
weighing the limited evidence in the record, assessing its probative value, passing upon credibility, speculating as to ultimate 
findings and electing between the factual inferences which could be drawn from the evidence adduced pursuant to a summary 
judgment motion. See Aronsen v. Crown Zellerbach, 662 F.2d 584 (9th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1200, 75 L. Ed. 2d

(1980): Even where there is an inability to prove that concerted activity has resulted in legally cognizable damages, jurisdiction 
need not be impaired, though such a failure may confine the available remedies to injunctive relief. See Georgia v. 
Pennsylvania R. Co., 324 U.S. 439, 452-463, 89 L. Ed. 1051, 65 S. Ct. 716 (1945); Keogh v. Chicago & N.W. R. Co., 260

fraction of a vote, see Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186 [7 L. Ed. 2d 663, 82 S. Ct. 691 (1962)]; a $5 fine and costs, see 
McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420 [6 L. Ed. 2d 393, 81 S. Ct. 1101 (1961)]; and a $1.50 poll tax.  Harper v. Virginia Bd. "
1008,," of Elections, 383 U.S. 663 [16 L. Ed. 2d 169, 86 S. Ct. 1079 (1966)]. . . . As Professor Davis has put it: ""The basic idea that 
comes out in numerous cases is that an identifiable trifle is enough for standing to fight out a question of principle; the trifle 
is the basis for standing and the principle supplies the motivation."" Davis, Standing: Taxpayers and Others, 35 U. Chi. L.

1009,3," Judge Martin's proposed reading of McLain ""would in essence eliminate the interstate commerce test from antitrust law, since 
the total activities of virtually any defendant, no matter how local its business, are likely to have some effects upon interstate 
commerce."" Kissan, Webber, Bigus & Holzgraefe, Antitrust and Hospital Privileges: Testing the Conventional Wisdom, 70 Calif. 
L. Rev. 595, 632 (May, 1982). "
1010,4," Twelve other cardiologists, none of whom is affiliated with GTA, have privileges at Beaumont and of these twelve, nine have 
catheterization lab privileges. "
1011,5," Privilege decisions that affect only individual practitioners or local communities of practitioners raise the most difficult cases for 
the interstate commerce test, and these cases invite different results under different approaches. The current case law appears 
to be more or less split on this matter, apparently depending upon the presence or absence of some special quantitative contact 
with interstate commerce. Kissan, Webber, Bigus & Holzgraefe, Antitrust & Hospital Privileges: Testing the Conventional 
Wisdom, 70 Calif. L. Rev. 595, 637 (May, 1982)."
1011,1," For a thorough discussion of the application of the interstate commerce requirement to hospital staff exclusion cases, see Note, 
Sherman Act ""Jurisdiction"" in Hospital Staff Exclusion Cases, 132 U. Pa. L. Rev. 121 (1983); see generally P. Areeda & D. 
Turner, Antitrust Law, para. 232.1 (Supp. 1982). "
1012,2," The argument that a failure to allege an effect on interstate commerce is a failure to state a claim rather than a failure to allege 
subject matter jurisdiction is a persuasive one. See, e.g., P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law, para. 232.1 at 97-99 (Supp. 
1982); Note, Sherman Act ""Jurisdiction"" in Hospital Staff Exclusion Cases, 132 U. Pa. L. Rev. 121 (1983). This distinction is 
irrelevant in the instant case, however, as I believe the plaintiff has established a sufficient nexus with interstate commerce."
1012,3," Several courts have relied on the following language that appears near the end of the McLain opinion to support their 
conclusion: To establish federal jurisdiction in this case, there remains only the requirement that respondents' activities which allegedly 
have been infected by a price-fixing conspiracy be shown ""as a matter of practical economics"" to have a not insubstantial 
effect on the interstate commerce involved.  McLain, 444 U.S. at 246. Courts that have adopted a narrow view of McLain have interpreted this passage to require a showing 
that the ""infected"" activities of the defendant or, in other words, defendant's alleged antitrust violations have the requisite effect 
on interstate commerce. See Seglin, 769 F.2d at 1280; Furlong, 710 F.2d at 926; Cordova & Simonpietri Insurance Agency, Inc. 
v. Chase Manhattan Bank, 649 F.2d at 45. In my opinion, this is a slim reed to rely upon to reject the indisputably explicit "
1013,," language in the McLain opinion rejecting this proposition. As I read this passage, it was not intended to have any limiting effect 
on the explicit language in the earlier portion of the opinion. The court was simply stating that the brokers' activities had allegedly 
been infected by an antitrust conspiracy."
1013,4," I believe a recent decision of the Supreme Court also lends support to my position. In a hospital staff privilege case, the Court 
did not even discuss the interstate commerce requirement but simply turned to the merits of the case.  Jefferson Parish Hospital 
District No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 104 S. Ct. 1551, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2 (1984). Because the requirement is jurisdictional, as the 
majority recognizes, the Court implicitly acknowledged its satisfaction. In fact, four members of the Court who concurred in the 
judgment stated, ""It is not disputed that such an impact [on interstate commerce] is present here."" Id. 104 S. Ct. at 1569, 1571 
n.5."
1013,5," In Shahawy v. Harrison, 755 F.2d 1432 (11th Cir. 1985), the Court decided both issues discussed in the text the same way as I 
have proposed.  Id. at 1437-38. In applying the test, the Shahawy court adopted a very restrictive view. It should be noted, 
however, the Shahawy decision has been withdrawn and a petition for rehearing granted. "
1014,6," In this case, counsel for the defendants raised the issue of no injury in his motion for summary judgment. Counsel for the 
plaintiff had an opportunity to respond and did respond to the argument at the hearing on the summary judgment motion. "
1020,1," I am aware, as defendants point out, that the Court of Appeals in General Leaseways, supra at 595-96, seems to de-
emphasize the use of internal documents: We attach rather little weight to internal company documents used to show anti-competitive intent, because, though they 
sometimes dazzle a jury, they cast only [*15]  a dim light on what ought to be the central question in an antitrust case: 
actual or probable anti-competitive effect. But here they corroborate an inference of anti-competitive effect based on the 
objective evidence of what the defendant has done. At the risk of seeming ""dazzled,"" I find that these internal US&S documents are rather more damaging than those in General 
Lease-ways and significantly more explicit. In addition, they also corroborate the apparent anti-competitive effect of the 
agreement. "
1027,1, All statutory references are to the Business and Professions Code unless otherwise indicated.
1027,2," In their points and authorities in support of the demurrer, defendants stated that several complaints, alleging the identical 
wrongdoing, had been filed in federal district courts on behalf of all direct purchasers of coconut oil against the same named 
defendants.  These federal actions, brought pursuant to sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act (Sherman Act) (15 U.S.C. 
ยงยง 1, 2) and sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton Antitrust Act (Clayton Act) (15 U.S.C. ยงยง 15, 26), were subsequently consolidated 
and transferred to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.  (In re Coconut Oil Antitrust Litigation 
MDL 474.) On July 1, 1983, an agreed final judgment was entered in the federal action in accordance with a settlement 
agreement. The settlement terms included an agreement by defendants to pay the plaintiffs $ 2 million in cash and to distribute 
to the plaintiffs class coupons evidencing credits for 40,241,448 pounds of crude and refined coconut oil which were valued for 
settlement purposes at $ 10 million. "
1029,3," A similar response occurred in other jurisdictions.  (See, e.g., Hawaii Rev. Stats., ยง 480-14(c); Ill. Ann. Stats., ch. 38, ยง 60-7(2) 
(Smith Hurd 1977); N.M. Stats. Ann., ยง 57-1-3(A); Wis. Stats. Ann., ยง 133.18(1); D.C. Code Ann. ยง 28-45091; Md. Ann. Code, ยง 
11-209; S.D. Laws Ann. ยง 7-1-33.) Alabama and Mississippi already had statutes allowing indirect-purchaser recovery.  (See 
Ala. Code, ยง 6-5-60(a); Miss. Code Ann., ยง 75-21-9.)"
1029,4," The dissent viewed the majority opinion as a regrettable retreat from prior cases which extended recovery to all persons who 
are made victims of the forbidden practice.  (See Mandeville Farms v. Sugar Co. (1948) 334 U.S. 219, 236 [92 L.Ed. 1328, 1340, 
68 S.Ct. 996].) Justice Brennan declared that the decision frustrated Congress' plainly stated objective to provide a remedy to all 
persons injured by violations of the antitrust laws.  The dissent draws attention to the then recently enacted Hart-Scott-Rodino 
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (15 U.S.C. ยง 15c et seq.) which gave state Attorneys General a cause of action to sue as 
parens patraie on behalf of citizens against antitrust violators and reasoned that the act confirmed Congress' intent to provide 
redress to all injured persons.  ( Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, supra, 431 U.S. 720, 748-765 [52 L.Ed.2d 707, 726-736].) In a 
separate dissenting opinion, Justice Blackmun stated that had Hanover Shoe not been ""'on the books,'"" he was positive that 
possibly a unanimous court would have ruled in favor of the plaintiffs.  ( Id., at p. 765 [52 L.Ed.2d at p. 737].) "
1030,5," If, for example, the state statute required that all overcharges be paid to indirect consumers, but not direct consumers, there 
would be a conflict with the federal remedy.  However, in the present case, the California statute in no way impinges on recovery 
of damages by direct purchasers. "
1031,6," A similar conclusion was reached in State Indirect Purchaser Statutes: The Preemptive Power of Illinois Brick (1982) 62 B. U. 
L. Rev. 1241. That note sets forth an excellent analysis of whether state statutes that authorize indirect purchaser suits so 
conflict with the federal policies expressed in Illinois Brick as to require preemption of the state statutes.  The author reasons that 
since the legislative history of the federal antitrust law, and the case law thereunder, do not evidence a congressional intent to 
displace state law and since the Illinois Brick decision is based predominantly on the policy of judicial economy, the Supreme 
Court's reliance on nonstatutory policies dictates that the decision not be extended to displace state laws that allow such suits."
1031,7," Defendants also cite Russo & Dubin v. Allied Maintenance Corp. (1978) 95 Misc.2d 344 [407 N.Y.S.2d 617], and In re Wiring 
Device Antitrust Litigation (E.D.N.Y. 1980) 498 F.Supp. 79. However, in both of these antitrust actions no state statute provided 
for suits by indirect purchasers and the due process argument was never fully discussed."
1031,8," See footnote 2, ante. "
1039,1," After the briefs were filed in this case, the parties informed the court that the merger had been consummated. We assume for 
purposes of this decision that the merger took place as described in the documents submitted by the parties. At the request of the appellants, this court had expedited briefing and argument in this case. However, the parties delayed two 
months in providing the court with the transcript of the argument that it had requested."
1039,2," The one exception to this limitation is that suits challenging mergers on the ground that they violate section 2 of the Sherman 
Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 2, need not be filed in this thirty day ""window"". See 12 U.S.C. ยง 1828(c)(7)(C). "
1040,3," The statute provides as follows: Except as otherwise provided by sections 3 and 4 of this act, (a) No company which owns more than 25% of the stock of 
any bank located inside this State shall acquire ownership of more than 10% of the stock of another bank located inside this 
State if, at the time of such acquisition, or if, as a result of such acquisition, the company owns, or would own, more than 
10% of the stock of each of two or more banks located inside this State, whose aggregate average deposits exceed 20% of 
the aggregate average deposits of all banks other than savings banks transacting business in this State as of the two call 
dates for which published figures are available next preceding such acquisition. N.J. Stat. Ann. ยง 17:9A-345(a)."
1040,4," [**8] N.J. Stat. Ann. ยง 17:9A-347 provides: HN4[
] Nothing in this act shall prohibit a company from acquiring bank stock in excess of the limitation imposed by section 2 of this act, if such acquisition results from an exchange of stock resulting from the merger or consolidation of a 
bank with another bank or banks."
1040,5," Specifically, United Jersey argues that the exception to ยง 345 contained in ยง 347 was inadvertently left in the statute when the 
New Jersey legislature amended ยง 345 in 1968 to allow partial ownership of banks by bank holding companies. According to 
United Jersey, leaving the ยง 347 exception intact effectively undermines the limitation in ยง 345. See Brief for United Jersey at 6. 
Whether the New Jersey legislature did intend to repeal ยง 347 is, of course, a question of state law."
1040,6," The Attorney General of New Jersey, representing the New Jersey Commissioner of Banking, refused to join the petition for 
removal. The Attorney General took the position that the complaint did not state a claim either under federal or state law. United 
Jersey argues that the Commissioner's failure to join the petition renders it fatally deficient and requires that the action be 
remanded to state court. See Tri-Cities Newspapers, Inc. v. Tri-Cities Printing Pressmen & Assistants', Local 349, 427 F.2d 325, 
327 (5th Cir. 1970) (all but ""nominal"" parties must join a petition for removal). Because of the view we take of the case, we need 
not decide this issue. "
1041,7," This statute provides as follows: B.  HN7[
] One or more banks may, without the approval of the commissioner or of any other officer, department, board or 
agency of this State, merged into or consolidate with a national banking association under the charter of such association, 
with the approval of the holders of at least 2/3 of the capital stock of each such bank entitled to vote. A majority of the 
directors of each such bank shall, within 10 days after such approval has been given, file in the department a certificate 
over their signatures that such approval has been given, and that the bank intends to act in pursuance thereof. Except as 
otherwise provided in subsection D of this section, a merger or consolidation authorized by this subsection shall be effected 
solely in the manner and with the effect provided by applicable Federal law, and no such merger or consolidation shall be 
subject to sections 132 through 147 or to any other law of this State; but a copy of the agreement or merger or 
consolidation certified by the comptroller of the currency shall be evidence, and may be recorded, as provided by section 
138. Upon the taking effect of the merger or consolidation, the bank shall be deemed to have surrendered its charter. N.J. Stat. Ann. ยง 17:9A-148(B) (emphasis added). For purposes of this section, the New Jersey banking laws define ""bank"" only 
to include state-chartered banks. See N.J. Stat. Ann. ยง 17:9A-1(1)."
1041,8," The Attorney General's brief agrees with plaintiffs that section 148(B) applies only to mergers of state banks into national 
banks, but also notes that the state banking laws do not grant the Commissioner of Banking any authority to regulate mergers 
between national banks. See Brief on Behalf of Mary Little Parell, Commissioner, New Jersey Department of Banking at 7. "
1042,9," Removal in this case is governed by 28 U.S.C. ยง 1441(a) & (b), which provide: (A) HN10[
] Except as otherwise expressly provided by Act of Congress, any civil action brought in a State court of which 
the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction, may be removed by the defendant or the defendants, to the 
district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place where such action is pending. (b) Any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction founded on a claim or right arising under the 
Constitution, treaties or laws of the United States shall be removable without regard to the citizenship or residence of the 
parties. Any other such action shall be removable only if none of the parties in interest properly joined and served as 
defendants is a citizen of the State in which such action is brought."
1042,10," On the same day that it decided Franchise Tax Board, the Supreme Court held in Shaw v. Delta Airlines, Inc., 463 U.S. 85, 77 
L. Ed. 2d 490, 103 S. Ct. 2890 (1983), that employers could bring a federal suit claiming that certain state laws were preempted 
by ERISA. "
1045,11," Other cases finding federal jurisdiction for state antitrust challenges are distinguishable. In In re Wiring Device Antitrust 
Litigation, 498 F. Supp. 79 (E.D. N.Y. 1980), the state antitrust statute had been interpreted to apply only to intrastate commerce 
and the plaintiffs sought to claim violations of the state law based on interstate commerce. Similarly, in Three J. Farms, Inc. v. 
Alton Box Board Co., 1979-1 Trade Cas. (CCH) P62,423 (D.S.C. 1978), rev'd on other grounds, 609 F.2d 112 (4th Cir. 1979), 
cert. denied, 445 U.S. 911, 100 S. Ct. 1090, 63 L. Ed. 2d 327 (1980), the plaintiff sued under a narrowly interpreted state law to 
redress wide ranging interstate anticompetitive behavior. In both cases federal class actions against the same defendants were 
already pending. "
1046,12," First Fidelity argues that the Comptroller's approval and the subsequent consummation of the merger rendered this case moot. 
In light of our holding that the district court had no subject matter jurisdiction, we do not reach the mootness issue. First Fidelity, 
of course, will be free to contend before the state court that this case is now moot. "
1049,1," Although the ""Successorship"" Clause is repeatedly referred to in this order, its status as a legal and mandatory subject of 
collective bargaining has already been conclusively established by the Tenth Circuit. See, Lone Star Steel Co. v. N.L.R.B., 639 
F.2d 545 (10th Cir. 1980), cert.  denied, 450 U.S. 911, 67 L. Ed. 2d 335, 101 S. Ct. 1349 (1981). Therefore, the parties have 
stipulated that the clause is no longer at issue in this litigation. However, in light of its duty to determine the provisions in the 
1974 NBCWA through which the Union, by strike or coercion, sought to ""forc[e] or requir[e]"" Lone Star's accession, the Court 
finds it necessary to recount the content of the parties' meetings and letters. The persistent referrals to the clause as a point in 
controversy throughout the negotiations evidences its primacy in the dispute."
1049,2," The provision of the 1974 NBCWA referred to as the Coal Lands clause is Article II, Section (f) ""Application of This Contract to 
the Employer's Coal Lands,"" it reads as follows: As part of the consideration for this Agreement, the Employers agree that this Agreement covers the operation of all coal 
lands, coal producing and coal preparation facilities owned or held under lease by them, or any of them, or by any 
subsidiary or affiliate at the date of this Agreement, or acquired during its term which may hereafter (during the term of this 
Agreement) be put into production or use."
1049,3," The Royalty payments provision (Art. XX(d)) objected to by Jensen reads, inter alia: In addition to the contributions indicated above, during the life of the Agreement, each signatory Employer shall, for the 
periods of time indicated below, contribute to the Trusts established in this Article in the amounts shown below based on 
cents per ton on each ton of two thousand (2,000) pounds of bituminous coal after production by another operator, "
1050,," procured or acquired by such Employer for use or for sale on which contributions to the appropriate Trusts as provided for 
in this Article have not been made . . .:"
1050,*, * * * 
1052,4," At various points in the negotiations Lone Star expressed its concern that the ""Construction Work"" provision in the 1974 
NBCWA would limit its ability to build coke ovens at the Starlight Mine. The Union's proposed addendum was designed to allay 
Lone Star's worries on the matter.  Lone Star now asserts that one of the Union's objectives in striking the Starlight Mine was to 
achieve the ""Construction Work"" provision."
1052,5, Lone Star does not now assert that a disagreement over choice of insurance carriers was an object of the strike.
1052,6," The passing reference to the ""Leasing, Subleasing and Licensing Out of Coal Lands"" clause in Lone Star's telegram was the 
only time during the course of the negotiations and appertaining correspondence that Lone Star voiced an objection to it. Lone 
Star now asserts that one of the Union's objectives in striking the Starlight Mine was to achieve the Clause. "

1058,12," The scant treatment provided in Fleming Building Co. v. Northeastern Oklahoma Building & Construction Trades Council, 532 
F.2d 162 (10th Cir. 1976) is not immediately helpful on the issues presented here. "
1059,13," The Court appreciates that, as a technical matter, it is questionable whether res judicata, as distinguished from collateral 
estoppel, can ever be applied to preclude ยง 303 ""claims"" on the basis of prior adjudications in ยง 8(b)(4) unfair labor practice 
proceedings. In International Longshoremen's Union v. Juneau Spruce, 342 U.S. 237, 72 S. Ct. 235, 96 L. Ed. 275 (1952), the 
Court held that, although the definition of the wrong in ยง 303 is borrowed from ยง 8(b)(4), court proceedings under ยง 303 are 
""independent"" of ยง 8(b)(4) unfair labor practice proceedings in the sense that a Board decision is not a prerequisite to the 
institution of court action under ยง 303. The Court observed that the National Labor Relations Act specifies two different remedies 
before two different tribunals for the respective violations, and that each tribunal is entitled to make its own independent decision 
on the evidence before it.  342 U.S. at 244-45. Since res judicata applies to repetitious suits on the same ""cause of action,"" 
Commissioner v. Sunnen, 333 U.S. 591, 597, 68 S. Ct. 715, 92 L. Ed. 898 (1948), or stated in the modern sense -- transactional 
""claim,"" it is doubtful that the doctrine may be applied, to separate actions for distinctive remedies which, with the imprimatur of 
the highest Court, may lead to inconsistent results. Compare, e.g., N.L.R.B. v. Deena Artware, 198 F.2d 645 (6th Cir. 1952) with 
United Brick & Clay Workers v. Deena Artware, 198 F.2d 637 (6th Cir. 1952) (Sixth Circuit, on same day, reached inconsistent 
decisions on ยง 303 and ยง 8(b)(4) actions involving identical facts and issues). This, of course, does not mean that collateral 
estoppel (issue preclusion) is inapplicable under the appropriate circumstances. See Eazor Express v. General Teamsters Local 
326, 388 F. Supp. 1264 (D. Del. 1975), and cases cited in footnotes 11 and 12, supra. Fortunately, the facts of the instant case 
do not require the Court to delve into the epistemological meanings of ""claim"" and ""cause of action,"" for the Court holds that the 
requisite elements of res judicata are not established, assuming arguendo, the doctrine's general applicability."
1059,14," The doctrine of res judicata is an affirmative defense which must be proved by the defendant. F.R.Cv.P. 8(c), Federal 
Insurance Company v. U.S., 618 F.2d 661, 662-63 (10th Cir. 1980) (per curiam). "

1060,16," Of course, bargaining to impasse over an illegal ยง 8(e) clause also constitutes a violation of the ยง 8(b)(3) duty to bargain in 
good faith. But in the absence of a clear ruling on the point, this Court is not willing to speculate that the Tenth Circuit predicated 
its ยง 8(b)(3) finding on a conclusion that the clause violated ยง 8(e). Neither can the Court assume, as the Union would have it, 
that the Circuit implicitly found the clause legal by deeming it a nonmandatory subject of collective bargaining. Nowhere in the 
court's opinion is the clause referred to as ""permissive."" Lone Star Steel Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 639 F.2d 545

1061,17," In National Woodwork, a ยง 8(b)(4)(i), (ii)(A) case, the Court upheld a clause which precluded the primary employer from using 
precut doors in order to preserve the traditional work of cutting doors for the unit employees. The Court suggested that it might 
have reached a different result had the clause been used as a ""sword"" to reach out and acquire new work rather than as a 
""shield"" to retain the jobsite work of the bargaining unit employees.  386 U.S. at 630, 87 S. Ct. at 1260, 18 L. Ed. 2d at 370. "
1062,18," In its review of the Successorship clause the Tenth Circuit stated: ""the statutory language [of ยง 8(e)] provides two distinct and 
alternative tests for finding a violation -- the first prohibiting an agreement by an employer to 'cease or refrain from handling, 
using, selling, [transporting] . . . or otherwise dealing in any of the products of any other employer;' the second prohibiting an 
agreement by an employer to'cease doing business with any other person.' Lone Star Steel v. N.L.R.B., 639 F.2d 545 (10th Cir. 
1980); cert. denied, 450 U.S. 911, 67 L. Ed. 2d 335, 101 S. Ct. 1349 (1981). These tests were derived from the general 
guidelines established by the Supreme Court in National Woodwork and were applied with an eye toward identifying the union 
objectives which motivated the challenged provision."
1062,19," The origin of the Coal Lands Clause may be traced to a 1943 order of the National War Labor Board directing the inclusion of 
a provision into each UMW contract which required all coal operators to agree not to lease their mines to third parties ""as a 
subterfuge"" to avoid having to comply with the substantive provisions of the collective bargaining agreement. See Lewis v. 
Pennington, 257 F. Supp. 815, 824 (E.D. Tenn. 1966), modified, 400 F.2d 806 (6th Cir.1968), cert. denied, 398 U.S. 960, 26 L. 
Ed. 2d 546, 90 S. Ct. 2177 (1970); see also Ramsey v. United Mine Workers, 265 F. Supp. 388 (E.D.  Tenn. 1967), rev'd on 
other grounds, 401 U.S. 302, 28 L. Ed. 2d 64, 91 S. Ct. 658 (1971), (providing a concise chronology of all the historical 
developments discussed herein). Since 1943, the clause, in one form or another, has been incorporated into every UMW 
contract. See, Smitty Baker Coal Co. v. United Mine Workers, 620 F.2d 416, 436-37 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 870, 66 L. 
Ed. 2d 89, 101 S. Ct. 207 (1980). "
1063,20," The Tenth Circuit and the ALJ found the clause to be both under and over inclusive in pursuing the objective of work and 
standards preservation. It was observed that the clause did not apply to non-Union operations. If it so desired, Lone Star could 
commence coal mining operations at another facility geographically proximate to Starlight, with freedom to hire non-Union 
employees at lower wages than it was contractually bound to pay the Union members at Starlight. Alternatively, the clause would 
bind Lone Star to apply the contract to phases of coal production that were unrelated to the actual mining of coal (the work of the 
bargaining unit employees). Further, the clause was not limited to the application of the contract's economic provisions, it 
required Lone Star to adopt the agreement in toto. As the ALJ noted, the clause could easily have been drafted more narrowly, 
and effectively, to protect union standards and preserve the primary employees' work. At the heart of the Tenth Circuit's decision lies the observation that the clause's language sweeps too broadly to bring it within 
the matters that, by law, must be resolved through collective bargaining. Because the clause is not carefully drafted to present a 
""direct frontal attack upon a problem thought to threaten the maintenance of the basic wage structure established by the 
collective bargaining contract,"" it is not sufficiently vital to the employee's interests to be deemed a mandatory subject of 
collective bargaining. Lone Star Steel Co. v. N.L.R.B., 639 F.2d 545, 558-59 (10th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 911, 101 S. 
Ct. 1349, 67 L. Ed. 2d 335 (1981) (quoting Teamsters Union v. Oliver, 358 U.S. 283, 294, 79 S. Ct. 297, 304, 3 L. Ed. 2d 312 
(1959))."
1063,21," Although it is not difficult to hypothesize a scenario in which the Union might resort to unlawful means to enforce the Coal 
Lands Clause, (for example by striking at Starlight to force Lone Star not to do business with vertical coal-related operations 
subsequently established by an affiliated company who refuses its Unionized employees' demands to implement the national 
contract), this alone does not render the clause violative of ยง 8(e) on its face. See N.L.R.B. v. Enterprise Ass'n of Steam & 
General Pipefitters (Austin Co.), 429 U.S. 507, 97 S. Ct. 891, 51 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1977) (a union may not strike to enforce an 
otherwise lawful work preservation clause by means that would violate ยง 8(b)(4)(i), (ii)(A))."
1063,22," Lone Star's position that if it were to agree to the Coal Lands clause it would then be bound to adopt (or submit to arbitration 
on) other allegedly illegal clauses in the 1974 NBCWA is similarly misplaced, and in fact amounts to a ""back-door"" attempt to 
place the entire national agreement into contention in this litigation. The adoption of this clause in the agreement covering the 
employees at Starlight surely cannot constitute a ""waiver"" of Lone Star's rights to object, file unfair labor practice charges, or "
1064,," institute litigation should the Union subsequently violate the Act at other locations. The critical distinction in this case is that the 
sole objects of the strike at Starlight were the Coal Lands and Royalty clauses. The content of these clauses are sufficiently 
independent of the other provisions in the agreement as to eliminate any need to commence an inquiry based upon a theory of 
inosculation. In sum, ""hot cargo"" clauses may well reside within the fifty-two pages of the 1974 NBCWA, but they are not at issue 
here because the strike at Starlight was not in furtherance of Union objectives to force or require Lone Star to agree to them."
1064,23," An agreement by which an employer agrees to preserve work for the contracting employees will inevitably affect other 
employers (and their employees). However, ""[t]he effect of work preservation agreements on the employment opportunities of 
[others], is of course irrelevant to the validity of the agreement so long as the union had no forbidden secondary purpose."" Frito-
Lay, Inc. v. Retail Clerks Union Local No. 7, 629 F.2d 653, 659 (10th Cir. 1980) (quoting N.L.R.B. v. International 
Longshoremen's Ass'n, 447 U.S. 490, 508 n.22, 100 S. Ct. 2305, 2315 n.22, 65 L. Ed. 2d 289 (1980)). "
1065,24," Lone Star may take solace in the fact that pursuant to the Supreme Court's decision in Kaiser Steel v. Mullins, 455 U.S. 72, 
102 S. Ct. 851, 70 L. Ed. 2d 833 (1982) the legality of the Royalty provision can be raised in defense to an action by the Health 
and Retirement Fund Trustees for delinquent or past due contributions. In Kaiser Steel, the legality of the clause was not at 
issue and was not decided, but, Justice White did observe that if the clause is illegal, ""it is because of the financial burden which 
the agreement attached to purchases of coal from non-UMW producers even though they may have contributed to other 
employee welfare funds."" 455 U.S.  at 79, 102 S. Ct. at 857."
1065,25," Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides in relevant part that ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or 
conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, . . ., is . . . illegal. Section 2 of the Sherman Act provides that ""Every person who shall monopolize or conspire with any other person or persons, to 
monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, . . ., shall be deemed guilty of a felony, . . . Sections 4 and 16 of the antitrust laws provide civil remedies for private businesses injured by the violation of Sections 1 and 2. 
Lone Star's complaint additionally alleges that the defendants have violated Sections 13, 15, 18, and 45(a)(1) of the antitrust 
laws."
1065,26," Although the Successorship and Coal Lands clauses are not specifically named in Lone Star's complaint, the allegations 
contained therein can only be read as referring to these provisions. Paragraph 8, which is the only portion of the complaint that 
states facts in support of the claims, provides as follows:"
1065,8," ) That since approximately February of 1975, Defendants, . . ., have been engaged in collective bargaining, and a strike to 
force the Plaintiff herein to execute a collective bargaining contract which would, among other things, require Plaintiff to 
cease doing business with other employers who are not United Mine Workers of America . . . signators; to prohibit the sale "
1066,," of assets or the business itself in whole or in part to non-UMWA signators; and to apply the substantive terms of the 1974 
National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement to other affiliated employers and subsidiaries of the Plaintiff, and further 
requiring that all coal lands owned by the employer or its affiliates and subsidiaries be licensed only to employers willing to 
assume the UMWA and its contract."
1066,27," It should be noted that this action does not proceed under Section 16 of the Clayton Act. Under Section 16, the injunctive relief 
provision, a plaintiff may sue for threatened damage or loss resulting from a violation of the antitrust laws. This suit is brought 
under Section 4, the treble damages provision, which requires injury in fact.  Monfort of Colorado, Inc.  v. Cargill, Inc., 761 F.2d 
570, 573-74 (10th Cir. 1985), cert.  granted, 474 U.S. 1049, 88 L. Ed. 2d 763, 106 S. Ct. 784 (1986). "
1067,28," In the absence of any agreement whatsoever, the facts of this case are wholly inapposite to the facts of any of the Supreme 
Court decisions concerning the scope of labor's antitrust exemptions. In all of these cases (which Lone Star inappropriately relies 
upon) an agreement between a union and an employer or a non-labor third party was already in effect when suit was 
commenced, and it was the agreement itself which constituted the focus of the Court's antitrust analysis. See Connell 
Construction Co., Inc.  v. Plumbers & Steamfitters Local Union No. 100, 421 U.S. 616, 95 S. Ct. 1830, 44 L. Ed. 2d 418 (1975); 
Meat Cutters v. Jewel Tea Co., 381 U.S. 676, 85 S. Ct. 1596, 14 L. Ed. 2d 640 (1965); United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 
U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965); Allen Bradley Co. v. Electrical Workers, 325 U.S. 797, 65 S. Ct. 1533, 89 L. 
Ed. 1939 (1945). For the same reason, this case is distinguishable from the cases which have addressed the antitrust 
implications of the 1974 NBCWA. See Duquense Light Co., 580 F. Supp. 670 (W.D. Penn. 1984), vacated, 756 F.2d 284 (3rd 
Cir.), cert.  denied, 474 U.S. 863, 88 L. Ed. 2d 149, 106 S. Ct. 180 (1985); Feather v. U.M.W., 494 F. Supp. 701 (W.D. Penn. 
1980), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 711 F.2d 530 (3rd Cir. 1983); see also Smitty Baker Coal Co. v. U.M.W., 620 F.2d 416 (4th 
Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 870, 66 L. Ed. 2d 89, 101 S. Ct. 207 (1980). Lone Star does not allege the existence of an 
anticompetitive agreement between the Union and any other party as grounds for its antitrust claim."
1067,29," Carried to its logical conclusion, Lone Star's theory would vest standing to sue for an antitrust violation in any third party who 
has been unable to maintain business operations with an employer whose unionized employees are on strike. If the third party 
could establish that the Union's strike objects, if successful, would illegally restrain trade between it and the struck employer it 
would be entitled to recover three-fold the damages it has suffered as a result of the strike. Under this scenario a multitude of 
plaintiffs would be entitled to exorbitant damage recoveries, wholly out of proportion to the alleged ""violation."" Cf.  Montreal 
Trading Ltd. v. Amax Inc., 661 F.2d 864, 867-68 (10th Cir. 1981), cert.  denied, 455 U.S. 1001, 71 L. Ed. 2d 868, 102 S. Ct. 
1634 (1982)."
1067,30," The Court in no way intimates that the Successorship or Coal Lands clauses violate the antitrust laws. Nor does the Court 
imply that, if the requisite injury was proved, Lone Star could recover treble damages for the Union's strike to force Lone Star to 
adopt these clauses. Indeed, the statutory language of Section 6 of the Clayton Act which provides,  inter alia, that nothing in the 
antitrust laws shall ""forbid or restrain individual members of. . . [labor] organizations from lawfully carrying out the legitimate 
objects thereof, nor shall such organizations, or the members thereof, be held or construed to be illegal combinations or 
conspiracies in restraint of trade, under the antitrust laws,"" clearly indicates congressional intent to exempt the kind of unilateral 
activities present in this case. See Berman Enterprises Inc. v. Int'l Longshoremen's Ass'n, 644 F.2d 930 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 
454 U.S. 965, 70 L. Ed. 2d 381, 102 S. Ct. 506 (1981) (holding an ""affiliates"" clause much like the Coal Lands clause legal 
under rule of reason analysis). Moreover, in a pre-trial conference, Lone Star's counsel abandoned rule of reason analysis in favor of its allegation that the 
disputed provisions constitute a per se violation of the Sherman Act. Pre-trial conference held February 7, 1984, record at 12. In 
the absence of any evidence demonstrating that the purpose or effect of the disputed provisions is that of ""raising, depressing, 
fixing, pegging, or stabilizing"" prices, or evidence showing that a rule of reason analysis would be complex, time consuming, and 
ultimately uncertain, the Court would be extremely hesitant to conclude that these clauses give rise to such a pernicious effect 
on competition as to render them presumptively illegal without inquiry into their precise harm. See Northern Pacific Railway v. 
United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5, 78 S. Ct. 514, 518, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1958). The Court also notes that a number of courts have "
1068,," observed that, in light of the statutory and nonstatutory labor exemptions and the mutual incompatibility between national labor 
policy and national antitrust policy, per se analysis may be inappropriate to antitrust claims against a labor union for engaging in 
labor-related activities. See e.g., Commerce Tankers Corp. v. National Maritime Union, 553 F.2d 793, 801-02 (2d Cir.), cert. 
denied, 434 U.S. 923, 54 L. Ed. 2d 280, 98 S. Ct. 400 (1977) (per se analysis inappropriate); Smith v. Pro Football, Inc., 193 
U.S. App. D.C. 19, 593 F.2d 1173, 1177-82 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (per se analysis inappropriate). "
1071,1," Prior to the bidding, Brinkley & Son and Dickerson entered into an agreement whereby each company agreed to give the other 
a subcontract estimate for a portion of Contract 12. Brinkley, which specializes in plant work, gave Dickerson a subcontract price 
for the pumping station construction; and Dickerson, which specializes in pipeline work, gave Brinkley a price for the pipeline 
work. While both companies submitted a competitive prime contractor bid on Contract 12, each agreed that if it won the contract 
it would subcontract the relevant portion to the other company."
1071,2, See supra note 1. 
1072,3," Crain and Denbo also testified that, prior to the bidding in 1977, Brinkley contacted them for safe numbers to bid on Contracts 7 
and 8 of the Pasquotank River Supply Project. They further testified that they supplied him with those numbers. Joint Appendix 
at 136 and 170."
1072,4," The appellants contend that the general nature of the jury's verdict makes it impossible to tell whether the jury looked to the 
alleged agreement between Carpenter and Brinkley, the alleged agreement between Crain & Denbo and Brinkley, or both, to 
support its verdict. The possibility that the jury relied only on the agreement between Crain & Denbo and Brinkley -- one which 
they claim did not exist -- gives rise to their argument that the evidence was insufficient. Without commenting on this contention 
by the appellants, we address the issue of whether the evidence regarding the conduct of Crain, Denbo and Brinkley is sufficient 
to support appellants' convictions of bid rigging."
1072,5," Of course, a corporation acts through its officers or agents. The use of the conjunctive ""and"" instead of the ampersand 
indicates actions by the individuals on behalf of the corporation."
1072,6," Section 1 of the Sherman Act declares illegal ""every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in 
restraint of trade or commerce among the several States."" The necessity of concerted action is apparent on the face of the 
statute."
1072,7," To that end, the appellants requested that the trial court give the following instruction to the jury: Members of the jury, I instruct you that certain conduct, standing alone, is not a violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust [sic] Act. 
It is not, for example, a violation -- nothing more appearing -- for one contractor to give another contractor a price to bid 
above if so requested when the contractor requesting the price has already determined independently and unilaterally not 
to compete for the project. Brief of Appellant at 15. For the reasons set forth below, we find that the district court properly refused to give such an 
instruction. "
1073,8," There is evidence in the record to suggest that Brinkley did indeed inflate his bid. In 1977, Brinkley & Son won Contract 12 with 
a low bid of $ 653,000. Two years later, Brinkley & Son won the contract with a bid of $ 995,000. The project design was not 
altered between 1977 and 1979. Joint Appendix at 47. Assuming a 23 percent rate of inflation in construction costs -- to which 
the parties stipulated -- Brinkley should have adjusted his bid to $803,000. Joint Appendix at 50. Moreover, Dickerson, to whom Brinkley subcontracted the pipeline work for $555,000, apparently earned a substantial profit on 
the project. Carpenter testified that while Dickerson normally estimated a profit of 15 percent on such projects, it estimated a 25 
percent profit in its 1979 subcontract price to Brinkley because ""there was very little competition on the job."" Joint Appendix at 
79. Carpenter further testified that Dickerson's actual gross profit on the job was 49 percent. Joint Appendix at 78."
1073,9," This suggested instruction is obviously based on appellants' argument that there was no agreement between Crain & Denbo 
and Brinkley to restrain trade because Crain & Denbo had unilaterally decided not to compete for Contract 12. We again reject 
this argument and any instruction based thereon. "
1075,10," Other circuits have considered the application of Gypsum in per se cases and have reached the same conclusion as this 
circuit. See United States v. Koppers Co., Inc., 652 F.2d 290, 295-96, n.6 (2nd Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1083, 70 L. Ed. 2d 
617, 102 S. Ct. 639 (1981) (""Where per se conduct is found, a finding of intent to conspire to commit the offense is sufficient; a 
requirement that intent go further and envision actual anti-competitive results would reopen the very questions of 
reasonableness which the per se rule is designed to avoid.""); and United States v. Brighton Building and Maintenance Co., 598 
F.2d 1101, 1106 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 840, 100 S. Ct. 79, 62 L. Ed. 2d 52 (1979) (""We do not read Gypsum as 
indicating that once defendants are proved to have intentionally made an agreement which is unlawful per se, there must be an 
instruction that the defendants cannot be convicted unless they are found to have intended to restrain trade or commerce.""). "

1088,1," AMC's corporate structure includes three related entities.  AMC owns and operates the exhibition screens; AMC Film 
Management, Inc. acts as a film buying and booking agent for AMC theatres; and Durwood, Inc. owns a controlling interest in 
both AMC and AMC Film Management."
1088,2," The jury also found in favor of AMC on the antitrust claims raised by Syufy in its complaint.  Syufy does not appeal that part of 
the verdict.  In addition, the district court granted a directed verdict in favor of Syufy on AMC's claim that Syufy conspired to 
restrain trade in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act."
1088,3, Syufy does not contest the jury instructions on appeal.
1088,4," Syufy also argues that in setting the rate of interest on the judgment, the district court erred in applying retroactively both 
California (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code ยง 685.010 (West Supp. 1986)) and federal (28 U.S.C. ยง 1961 (1982)) statutes enacted after the 
date of judgment.  We need not reach this issue because we vacate the district court's judgment and remand for a new trial.  
Clearly, any judgment entered subsequent to this opinion will be governed entirely by 28 U.S.C. ยง 1961. "
1089,5," We utilize this simplified structural approach -- rigidly bifurcating market definition from the question of power within the defined 
market, see generally L. Sullivan, Handbook of the Law of Antitrust 33-35 (1977), -- because it has been adopted by the parties.  
We do not imply that this is the exclusive way to approach the question of market power. "
1091,6, We discuss the evidence on excessive clearances below in section B of this part of our opinion.
1091,7," Syufy objects for the first time on appeal to the admission of Silverman's testimony.  Syufy argues that his opinion testimony 
had no basis in the evidence and further that his testimony should have been excluded because the identification of Silverman 
as an official antitrust enforcer prejudiced the jury.  AMC replies that Syufy failed to object at trial and that hence it has waived its 
objection under Fed. R. Evid. 103.  Syufy has fallen far short of demonstrating that the admission of Silverman's testimony was 
plain error.  Despite the shortcomings of Silverman's testimony regarding the particular relevant market in question, he qualified 
as an expert in antitrust matters, and although his testimony about the San Jose film exhibition market was of marginal value, it 
was not plain error to admit it. "
1092,8," Marks testified that in his opinion the Syufy domed theaters and AMC's Oakridge theaters were not in substantial competition 
with each other.  Although Marks may have contradicted himself by stating that the AMC's Old Mill theater, which is located 
farther away from the Syufy domes than either the Saratoga or Oakridge theaters, had some competitive effect on Syufy's 
domed theaters, it is the province of the jury to judge credibility and choose from conflicting inferences.  R.T. at 3120."
1092,9," The district judge's instructions to the jury discussed the leveraging theory as a component of the general section 2 
monopolization claim.  But the legal and evidential requirements of the two theories are so distinct (e.g., the existence and 
impact of monopoly power in another market) as to merit separate treatment. "
1093,10," Thus, we need not enter into the debate concerning the anticompetitive effects of leverage. Compare 5 P. Areeda & D. Turner, 
Antitrust Law para. 1129c, 1134b (1980), and R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 140-44, 372-75 (1978), with L. Kaplow, Extension 
of Monopoly Power Through Leverage, 85 Colum. L. Rev. 515 (1985)."
1093,11," AMC's brief does include citations to other portions of the record that are alleged to support the leverage theory.  But we find 
these citations to be totally unhelpful.  One citation to page 2494 of the Reporter's Transcript leads us to testimony that bears no 
relationship to the proposition AMC claims it supports.  The other citation, to pages 3257-58 of the Transcript, leads us to 
testimony by Silverman expressing a legal opinion that if Syufy successfully used leverage it would be guilty of monopolization."
1093,12," In addition, four of the nine films were not included in the product market defined by AMC, which was the only market in which 
AMC claimed causal antitrust injury and damages. "
1094,13," The question whether ""dangerous probability of success"" is an element of attempted monopolization appears to have 
generated a measure of confusion in this circuit.  Compare Lessig v. Tidewater Oil Co., 327 F.2d 459 (""dangerous probability of 
success"" not an element of attempted monopolization) with Transamerica Computer Co., Inc., 698 F.2d 1377, 1382 (9th Cir. 
1983) (""dangerous probability of success"" is an element) and California Computer Prods., Inc., 613 F.2d at 736 (same).  
Because of its large market share, Syufy cannot seriously argue that AMC's attempted monopolization claim fails on the ground 
that AMC failed to prove ""dangerous probability of success."" For this reason, we need not address the question whether proof of 
""dangerous probability of success"" is required. "
1095,14," On appeal, Syufy claims that the district court submitted the Section 2 conspiracy claim to the jury inadvertently because it 
overlooked the directed verdict it had granted on the Section 1 claim.  The record is clear, however, that the district court acted 
deliberately in submitting the Section 2 conspiracy claim to the jury.  It did so after counsel for Syufy called the court's attention 
to the directed verdict on the Section 1 claim.  We also note that appellant did not object to jury instructions on the Section 2 
conspiracy claim."
1095,15," Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides that ""every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in 
restraint of trade . . . is declared to be illegal."" 15 U.S.C. ยง 1 (1982). The relevant portion of Section 2 reads, ""Every person who

1104,1," In 1982, while this case was pending in the California Court of Appeal, the Berkeley electorate enacted the ""Tenants' Rights 
Amendments Act of 1982,"" revising certain sections of the 1980 Ordinance. Like the California Supreme Court, we review the 
Ordinance as amended, see 37 Cal. 3d 644, 654, n. 2, 693 P. 2d 261, 270, n. 2 (1984); all reference herein will therefore be to 
the 1982 version of the Ordinance. "
1107,2," Though they have not pressed the point with any vigor in this Court, appellants have suggested that Berkeley's rent controls 
constitute attempted monopolization because the city ""is clearly engaged in the provision of housing in the public sector"" and 
using the controls to depress the prices of residential properties as a prelude to taking them over.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 14-15.  As to 
this claim, we note only that the inquiry demanded by appellants' allegations goes beyond the scope of the facial challenge 
presented here.  See Rice v. Norman Williams Co., 458 U.S., at 661. "
1108,1," When Berkeley's charter amendment was passed in 1972, Article XI, ยง 3(a), of the California Constitution read: ""For its own government, a county or city may adopt a charter by majority vote of its electors voting on the question.  The charter 
is effective when filed with the Secretary of State.  A charter may be amended, revised, or repealed in the same manner.  A 
charter, amendment, revision, or repeal thereof shall be published in the official state statutes. . . .  The provisions of a charter 
are the law of the State and have the force and effect of legislative enactments."" This provision was construed to require that charter amendments be approved by concurrent resolution of both houses of the 
state legislature. Birkenfeld v. City of Berkeley, 17 Cal. 3d 129, 137, n. 2, 550 P. 2d 1001, 1007, n. 2 (1976). "
1109,2," The 1972 charter provision permitted individual adjustments of the across-the-board rent ceiling only on a unit-by-unit basis, 
and only after a hearing on the particular unit whose rent was to be raised.  The California Supreme Court found that this 
limitation ""put the [rent control board] in a procedural strait jacket,"" and ""unnecessarily [precluded] reasonably prompt action"" on 
meritorious petitions by landlords. Birkenfeld, supra, at 171, 172, 550 P. 2d, at 1031, 1032. "
1110,1," Rice held that a ""state statute is not pre-empted by the federal antitrust laws simply because the state scheme might have an 
anticompetitive effect."" 458 U.S., at 659. Rice involved a challenge to a California statute which effectively allowed liquor 
distillers to control distribution of their products in the State.  The Court concluded that because such vertical nonprice restraints 
are not per se illegal under the Sherman Act, see Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S. 36 (1977), the statute 
was not pre-empted. 458 U.S., at 661; see also Exxon Corp. v. Governor of Maryland, 437 U.S. 117 (1978); Joseph E. Seagram 
& Sons, Inc. v. Hostetter, 384 U.S. 35 (1966). In contrast, Berkeley's Rent Stabilization Board fixes prices for rental units in the 
city.  Unlike nonprice restraints, price fixing has traditionally been held to be per se illegal under the Sherman Act. See Dr. Miles 
Medical Co. v. John D. Park & Sons Co., 220 U.S. 373 (1911). "
1111,2," The Court would distinguish Schwegmann and Midcal based on the role of private parties in setting prices.  Ante, at 268-269.  
The Court characterizes the statutory restraints imposed in those cases as ""hybrid, in that nonmarket mechanisms merely 
enforce private marketing decisions."" Ante, at 267.  In this case, the Court argues, Berkeley's landlords have no control over the 
prices they charge.  Ibid. True, in both cases private parties, rather than the State, were largely responsible for setting the prices that retailers had to 
adhere to.  However, the lack of state supervision over price-fixing activities was only relevant to whether the challenged statutes 
were immune from antitrust liability under Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341 (1943), see Midcal, 445 U.S., at 105; neither decision 
drew the distinction the Court today creates between ""unilateral"" and ""hybrid"" governmental restraints.  In both cases the 
challenged statute was found invalid simply because it compelled private parties to charge fixed prices for their products, 
conduct which the Sherman Act forbids. See Schwegmann, 341 U.S., at 389; Midcal, supra, at 103. The Court's ""distinction"" 
ignores the fact that price fixing has the same deleterious effect upon the competitive market whether prices are set by an 
administrative body or by private parties.  Thus, regardless of whether Berkeley's landlords have some role in setting the prices 
they must charge, the coercive effect of the city's Ordinance results in concerted action violative of the Sherman Act. "
1112,3," At that time, the State Constitution required the legislature to approve city charter amendments.  See Birkenfeld v. City of 
Berkeley, 17 Cal. 3d, 129, 137, n. 2, 550 P. 2d, 1001, 1007, n. 2 (1976). In 1974, the State Constitution was amended to 
eliminate this requirement. "
1127,*," See Rule 3(b), Rules of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit."
1127,1," The district court did not expressly decide the pendent state antitrust claim. It was not necessary to do so, however, because 
conduct exempt under federal antitrust law is also exempt from Fla.Stat. Ch. 542. Fla. Stat. ยง 542.20 (1985). "
1133,*," The Honorable Hubert L. Will, Senior District Judge for the Northern District of Illinois, is sitting by designation."
1133,1," People who cannot divert to preferred providers are unlikely customers of PPO plans. When a person's physician has privileges 
only at non-PPO hospitals, the incentives created by the plan have less effect, if they have any. Because the PPO plan adds a 
new option and does not withdraw any old one, patients who lack a choice among hospitals are best off sticking with their 
existing financing scheme. Throughout this opinion, when we discuss patients' incentives we refer only to those patients who 
have options or can persuade physicians to take advantage of these options. "
1146,2," The data were not introduced into evidence, and therefore the presumption that evidentiary matters will be available to the 
public does not apply. See In re Continental Illinois Securities Litigation, 732 F.2d 1302 (7th Cir. 1984) (announcing a 
presumption of availability). The D.C. Circuit has concluded that the panel in Continental Illinois got its history wrong, see In re 
Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 249 U.S. App. D.C. 119, 773 F.2d 1325 (1985) (no presumption of access), but 
this is not the occasion to resolve the question. "
1147,3," Counsel cited Disciplinary Rule 2-107, which says that counsel shall ""not enter into an agreement that restricts his right to 
practice law"" as part of a ""settlement of a controversy or suit"". The protective order was not part of a ""settlement,"" and we 
therefore need not consider whether it ""restricts [the] right to practice law"" within the meaning of the rule. "
1157,1," At the time plaintiffs filed this civil action, AT&T conducted its business through its Long Lines Department (""AT&T Long 
Lines""), and in conjunction with Bell Telephone Laboratories (""Bell Labs""), Western Electric Company (""Western Electric""), 
American Bell, Inc., a.k.a. AT&T Information Systems (""ABI""), and the Bell Operating Companies (""BOCs"").  AT&T controlled the 
BOCs, Western Electric, ABI, and Bell Labs through the ownership of stock. However, AT&T divested itself of the BOCs 
pursuant to an antitrust settlement approved by Judge Harold Greene of this court in United States v. American Tele. & Tele. 
Co., 552 F. Supp. 131 (D.D.C. 1982), aff'd sub nom., Maryland v. United States, Tandy Corp. v. United States, North American 
Telephone Ass'n v. United States, and Illinois v. United States, 460 U.S. 1001, 75 L. Ed. 2d 472, 103 S. Ct. 1240 (1983), which 
took effect on January 1, 1984. Besides American Telephone and Telegraph Company, the other named defendants include Western Electric Company, Inc., 
American Bell, Inc., Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc., Michigan Bell Telephone Co., the Mountain States Telephone and 
Telegraph Co., New England Telephone and Telegraph Co., New York Telephone Co., Indiana Bell Telephone Co., Inc., the 
Ohio Bell Telephone Co., Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., Pacific Northwest Bell Telephone Co., the Pacific Telephone and

Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Co., the Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Co. of Maryland, the Chesapeake and 
Potomac Telephone Co. of Virginia, the Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Co.  of West Virginia, Cincinnati Bell, Inc., Illinois 
Bell Telephone Co., New Jersey Bell Telephone Co., Wisconsin Bell, Inc., the Diamond State Telephone Co., and Bell 
Telephone Co. of Nevada. Second Amended Complaint at 6. These defendants will be referred to collectively as ""AT&T"" for the 
purposes of this opinion."
1157,2," Until January 1, 1984, a consent order entered in United States v. Western Electric Co., Inc. and American Telephone & 
Telegraph Co., 1956 Trade Cas. (CCH) P 68,246 (D. N.J. 1956), enjoined AT&T from engaging directly or indirectly through 
subsidiaries in any business other than the furnishing of common carrier communication services with certain limited exceptions. 
This consent decree acted as a legal barrier to defendants' entry into the alarm industry until it was vacated on August 24, 1982, 
as part of the approved antitrust settlement."
1157,3," Plaintiffs cite defendants' operation ""SUNRAY"" as an example of the type of services intended for use by defendants to lure 
away Sonitrol customers. Operation SUNRAY is ""an enhanced services package for residential and business telephone 
subscribers"" which ""will offer customers an array of electronic services, such as home banking, electronic yellow pages, meter 
reading and alarm service."" Second Amended Complaint para. 49. "
1158,4," As noted by the Special Master in his recommendation, while defendants' motion is limited to the Sonitrol plaintiffs in only five 
states, ""the basic principles involved concern all of the Sonitrol plaintiffs."" Decision or Recommendation of Special Master on 
Motion for Partial Summary Judgment Re: State Action Immunity (""Special Master's Recommendation"") at 2. Accordingly, the 
Court's decision on the issue of defendants' state action immunity defense will apply to any subsequent motions by the other 
Sonitrol plaintiffs to which this doctrine may apply. "
1163,5," The New York Public Commission consolidated the coin service rate aspects of Case No. 27995 with Phase II of Case No. 
27710, a proceeding which they had instituted in response to coin service rate proposals advanced initially in New York 
Telephone Company's August 1981 second filing. Therefore, the hearings mentioned above also include testimony and 
evidence as to Phase II of Case No. 27710. "
1174,1," That is not to say that for some antitrust purposes all the defendant electrical contractors may not be potential competitors. 
They well might be, for example, for the purpose of a nonconspiratorial statute like section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 18 
(1982). But the fact that they are potential competitors for the purpose of antitrust laws aimed at preventing potential future injury 
to competition does not support a legitimate inference that those defendants entered into a conspiracy with respect to specific 
markets defined by the independent economic decisions of persons unrelated to and uncontrolled by them. "
1175,2," Justice Brennan's position, announced in his concurring opinion in Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. at 453-54, that there is a fourth 
double jeopardy principle permitting joinder of multiple offenses, but not separate trials, growing out of the same transaction or 
occurrence, has not received majority support in the Court. If separate Sherman Act offenses are charged in the indictments 
before us, however, we believe his Ashe v. Swenson test would be satisfied. "
1177,3," Judge Stapleton's concurring opinion develops the absence of evidence which would justify a finding of a single overreaching 
conspiracy. I fully agree with that analysis. "
1178,1," If this kind of interdependence had been shown, it would, of course, have been strong evidence of a single conspiracy."
1178,2," The Gulf meetings were held at the National Electrical Contractor's Assoc. building in Philadelphia. Fairless meetings were held 
at the Philadelphia Airport Hotel, except for one held at a Pittsburgh Airport Hotel. Western Works meetings were held at the 
Duquesne Club in downtown Pittsburgh. [173a, 613a-14a, 439a-40a, 450a, 536a]."
1178,3, The records and discussions never related to other sites. [173a].
1178,4," At Fairless, no codes or special precautions against detection were taken, and participants would enter and leave the meetings 
together [458a]. At Western Works, meetings were called by using a code. [458]. The participants would go to and leave the 
Western Works meetings in secrecy. [459a, 398a-99a]."
1178,5," There were no trade-offs between jobs at Gulf and any other location or between jobs at Fairless and any other location. [552; 
559; 650; 496-97; 449; 465; 548; 628; 630; 596-97; 594]. There were no trade-offs between Western Works and Fairless. [464; 
496-97; 924]. However, there were trade-offs between jobs at Western Works and J & L Steel [502-03], even when bid lists were 
not identical between the two operations. [980-82]. The court did not credit the failure to allocate jobs on a conspiracy-wide basis 
because the lack of similarity between the bidders at the various locations made trade-offs ""simply impractical"" [192]. The court 
did not, however, explain why trade-offs were impractical between all the other conspiracy locations except Western Works and 
J & L Steel."
1178,6," A dual rotation system was employed at Gulf -- one rotation for jobs under $100,000 and a second one for jobs over that 
amount. [753,764]. At Fairless, the low bidder was not determined by rotation, and so could not be ascertained prior to the 
meeting [616]. Instead, at Fairless, the decision was made ad hoc in an effort to equalize the dollar volume of the work. [447, 
539]. At Western Works, the low bidder was determined by dollar volume. [396, 917]. "
1179,7," 180a-81a, 480a."
1179,8," For example, Geuther of Foley testified that he was unaware of bid rigging at Western Works or Lukens [627a, 634a]. Therrien 
of Meade testified that he was unaware of any bid rigging taking place in Philadelphia [408a-09a]. Frazer of Frazer did not know 
that bid rigging was going on at Sun until he started attending meetings to rig bids in 1973 [769a]. Frazer also testified that he 
did not know that bid rigging was going on at Fairless and Western Works, and did not know that there were meetings held at 
the Philadelphia Airport Hotel to rig bids [770a-71a]. Gosewisch of Frazer was unaware that there was rigging going on at 
Fairless [654a]. Spang of Riggs Distler had no knowledge of rigging at Western Works, Fairless, Gulf, Sun, or Lukens [693a]. Arbogast of Lord did testify that, in his opinion, the Western Works and Fairless schemes were part of one whole [910a-11a]. But 
his testimony did not show any awareness that this scheme extended beyond U.S. Steel or included Gulf. [Id.] Arbogast did not 
suggest that any of the Western Works and Fairless schemes were dependent on each other. Thus Arbogast's testimony is as 
consistent with multiple conspiracies as with a single conspiracy. Perrott of Lord testified that he considered the Western Works 
and Fairless schemes as two separate areas and two separate circumstances [464a, 496a-97a]."
1179,9, 172a
1179,10, 181a
1179,11," The fact noted by the district court that there was some overlap in the periods of and the participants in the rigging at the 
various sites is similarly as consistent with multiple conspiracies as with a single one. "
1181,1," These facilities included the Lukens Steel plant in Coatesville, the Sun Oil Company plant in Marcus Hook, and the Atlantic 
Richfield refinery in Philadelphia. "
1182,2," In cases involving per se violations of section one of the Sherman Act, such as bid-rigging, a determination of market power is 
deemed unnecessary, see, e.g., United States v. Socony-Vacuum Co., 310 U.S. 150, 84 L. Ed. 1129, 60 S. Ct. 811 (1940); 
Fischbach & Moore, Inc., 750 F.2d at 1192, as it is presumed that such pernicious practices have an adverse impact on 
competition. Indeed, in Socony-Vacuum, the Supreme Court stated that to establish a violation of section one in a per se case, 
the prosecution need show no more than a purpose to engage in the illegal practice, and that it is unnecessary to establish 
either the commission of an overt act or ""that the conspirators had the means available for accomplishment of their objective. . . 
."" Id. at 225 n.59. Thus, while in a case subject to the rule of reason an identification of the relevant market might be useful in 
determining the scope of an anticompetitive conspiracy for double jeopardy purposes, that is not the situation here."
1182,3," The hypothesized facts may be visualized thus: Facility One , Facility Two , Facility Three A , A , A B , B , B C , D "
1183,," , E "
1185,4," The Supreme Court recently held that ""the coordinated activity of a parent and its wholly owned subsidiary must be viewed as 
that of a single enterprise for purposes of ยง 1 of the Sherman Act."" Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 
752, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 2742, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1984). "
1195,1," In support of their motion, INTV and SVC have submitted a statement of undisputed facts of 68 numbered paragraphs set out 
on 28 pages. They have filed in support of their motion 15 volumes containing more than 1,200 exhibits. Many of the individual 
exhibits are themselves constituted of many documents. CFA and the Big Eight have filed contrary statements of disputed facts 
and their own volumes of exhibits. ABC has filed a 27-page statement of material and contested facts covering 26 pages and 
has filed its own volume of supporting exhibits. By leave of court, INTV and SVC have replied separately to the defendants. "
1196,2," ABC urges the court to adopt a general rule disfavoring summary judgment in antitrust cases, citing Poller v. Columbia 
Broadcasting System, Inc., 368 U.S. 464, 473, 7 L. Ed. 2d 458, 82 S. Ct. 486 (1962). In Poller, the United States Supreme Court 
observed that summary procedure ""should be used sparingly in complex antitrust litigation where motive and intent play leading 
roles, the proof is largely in the hands of the alleged conspirators, and hostile witnesses thicken the plot."" On the basis of this 
language in Poller, it has sometimes been said that summary judgment should be sparingly granted in antitrust cases or that it is 
less available in complex antitrust matters than in other litigation. See World of Sleep, Inc. v. La-Z-Boy Chair Co., 756 F.2d 1467, 
1474 (10th Cir. 1985); Holter v. Moore & Co., 702 F.2d 854, 855 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 937, 78 L. Ed. 2d 313, 104 S. 
Ct. 347 (1983); Pueblo Aircraft Service, Inc. v. City of Pueblo, 679 F.2d 805, 806 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1126, 74 L. 
Ed. 2d 977, 103 S. Ct. 762 (1983). The import of these cases, however, is that factual issues concerning motive and intent 
create special discovery and evidentiary problems and do not submit readily to summary resolution. Neither Poller nor the cases 
following it in any way exclude antitrust matters from the scope and force of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. Indeed, there 
are many reasons why summary judgment may be of special service in antitrust matters. Antitrust actions are often borne of 
commercial disappointment rather than a legal wrong. The great cost of adjudication in time, money, and energy, and the 
complexity of antitrust issues and the relative inexperience of jurors with the concepts needed to resolve them also counsel that 
the law should be applied early if the facts are not in dispute. There is also a compelling need for a uniform and foreseeable 
interpretation of the antitrust laws. Summary judgment therefore must get careful consideration in these cases. See First 
National Bank v. Cities Service Co., 391 U.S. 253, 289-90, 20 L. Ed. 2d 569, 88 S. Ct. 1575 (1968); White Motor Co. v. United 
States, 372 U.S. 253, 259, 83 S. Ct. 696, 9 L. Ed. 2d 738 (1963); Curtis v. Campbell-Taggart, Inc., 687 F.2d 336, 338 (10th Cir.), 
cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1090, 103 S. Ct. 576, 74 L. Ed. 2d 937 (1982); Baum v. Gillman, 648 F.2d 1292, 1295-96 (10th Cir. 1981) 
(""there is nothing unique in antitrust actions which precludes application of the rule [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56]""); Farnell 
v. Albuquerque Publishing Co., 589 F.2d 497 (10th Cir. 1978); Alt v. American Income Life Insurance, 337 F.2d 472 (10th Cir. 
1964); II P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law para. 316, 57-58 (1978); J. von Kalinowski, Antitrust Laws & Trade Regulation 
para. 113.02, 113-15 (1985). The court therefore rejects ABC's argument urging adoption of a general rule against summary 
adjudication of antitrust matters. "
1197,3," The parties agree that the rights conveyed by CFA and the Big Eight under the challenged arrangements are not absolutely 
exclusive in an ordinary sense, since members can sell television rights outside the plans.  The term ""exclusivity,"" however, has 
been used by the parties to refer to the time and territorial restrictions that the plan imposes on members for the benefit of the 
networks. The court adopts this practice of the parties."
1197,4," An ""exposure"" is actual broadcast or cable time, usually three and one-half hours, during which a game or games may be 
shown. More than one game may be presented during the same exposure. For example, the network might decide to air one 
game in the east and a different game in the west at the same time, that is, during the same exposure; these games are called 
""split-national"" games. Alternatively, the network might air three or more ""regional"" games during the same exposure. The 
network might, of course, choose to air only one game of intense national interest during an exposure, thus presenting the same 
game to the entire national audience. "
1198,5," ""Access"" and ""pay-per-view"" telecasts are essentially exceptions to the time-period exclusivity granted by CFA to ESPN. They 
are important because they represent direct competition between the network game selected by ESPN and a competing local 
telecast offered at the same time by a CFA member. An ""access"" telecast is an over-the-air presentation of a game played by 
one or more CFA members shown at the same time as the ESPN game of the week. A ""pay-per-view"" game is a game 
communicated to paying viewers via cable television facilities in the home state or states of CFA members playing a game at the 
same time as the ESPN game of the week. Thus, access and pay-per-view telecasts hold the potential to draw local audiences 
from the game selected by ESPN for national cablecast. The parties dispute the significance of this competition and also dispute 
the circumstances under which CFA members are contractually entitled to sell access and pay-per-view rights to their games 
after such games have been ""passed"" by ABC and ESPN, that is, not selected as the game of the week. "
1200,6," The NCAA television plan continues as a source of controversy among the parties. INTV's and SVC's claims are grounded on 
their contention that the CFA and Big Eight plans perpetuate the NCAA intercollegiate football cartel and that the offensive 
provisions of the NCAA plan earlier enjoined by this court are reproduced with only legally insignificant modifications in the 1984 
and subsequent CFA and Big Eight plans. ABC, CFA, and the Big Eight, on the other hand, contrast the 1984 and later plans 
with the NCAA plan and argue that current television rights arrangements are different from the earlier plan and are pro-
competitive and legal. The basic terms of the NCAA television plan are set out in Board of Regents, 468 U.S. 85, 104 S. Ct., at 
2959. "
1201,7," See Board of Regents, 468 U.S., at    , 104 S. Ct, at 2961-62 (""despite the fact that this case involves restraints on the ability of 
member institutions to compete in terms of price and output, a fair evaluation of their competitive character requires 
consideration of the NCAA's justifications for the restraints""); id., at 2968 n. 55 (""if the NCAA faced interbrand competition from 
available substitutes, then certain forms of collective action might be appropriate in order to enhance its ability to compete"");

(""not all arrangements among actual or potential competitors that have an impact on price are per se violations of the Sherman 
Act or even unreasonable restraints[;] . . . joint ventures and other cooperative arrangements are also not usually unlawful . . . 
where the agreement on price is necessary to market the product at all""); see also Continental T. V., Inc.  v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 
433 U.S. 36, 51-57, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568, 97 S. Ct. 2549 (1977) (approving vertical intrabrand restraints that foster interbrand 
competition); Appalachian Coals, Inc. v. United States, 288 U.S. 344, 376-77, 77 L. Ed. 825, 53 S. Ct. 471 (1933) (approving 
joint sales agency). "
1202,8," In a related matter, the Big Eight asserts that it is a ""single entity"" and is therefore incapable of combining or conspiring with 
itself in violation of the antitrust laws. The courts have considered frequently, with varying results, whether sports leagues are 
single entities or combinations. Precedent is of no particular value, however, since each league is sui generis and claims its own 
unique status. The Big Eight has presented enough evidence of its unitary purpose to warrant further inquiry into the facts 
supporting this defense. It should also be noted that the treatment as separate entities of member clubs of professional sports 
leagues has been seriously criticized. See National Football League v. North American Soccer League, 459 U.S. 1074, 74 L.

1202,9," INTV offers three theories upon which it contends it is entitled to relief even in the absence of proof of a relevant market or of 
market power, but INTV is not entitled by any of these to summary judgment. INTV correctly states that a per se violation of ยง 1 
requires no market definition or showing of power, citing Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Society, 457 U.S. 332, 341 n. 11, 
102 S. Ct. 2466, 73 L. Ed. 2d 48 (1982), United States v. McKesson & Robbins, Inc., 351 U.S. 305, 309-10, 100 L. Ed. 1209, 76 
S. Ct. 937 (1956), and United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 221, 84 L. Ed. 1129, 60 S. Ct. 811 (1940). But 
INTV has not proved a per se violation. For the reasons set out above, the court cannot at this stage of the proceedings 
condemn the defendants' arrangements as unlawful per se. INTV correctly maintains that agreements that distort prices, reduce 
output, or subvert market choices and are unaccompanied by procompetitive justifications may violate ยง 1 under the rule of 
reason and may be condemned even in the absence of market power, citing Board of Regents, U.S.    , 104 S. Ct. at 2965 n. 42. 
However, there are factual issues that must be resolved before the court can determine whether the CFA or Big Eight plans fix "
1203,," prices, reduce output, or constrict viewer choice.  The court also is faced with factual disputes material to its evaluation of the 
procompetitive justifications alleged by the defendants. INTV points out, also accurately, that market power need not be shown 
to prove a conspiracy to monopolize in violation of ยง 2, citing Salco Corp. v. General Motors Corp., 517 F.2d 567, 576 (10th Cir. 
1975). To establish such a violation, however, INTV must prove the defendants' specific intent to monopolize. This question is 
the epitome of the inferential conclusion least amenable to judgment based on documents, and the court is unable and unwilling 
to decide this question upon the present record."
1203,10," In its original answers to the complaints in these cases, CFA admitted that the relevant product market is telecast rights to 
intercollegiate football games as found earlier by this court in Board of Regents. On January 8, 1985, the United States 
Department of Justice issued an opinion that the United States Football League (USFL) can lawfully televise its football games 
on Saturdays in the fall. CFA subsequently with leave of court amended its answers to deny the market asserted by INTV and 
SVC."
1203,11," CFA and ABC state, and INTV and SVC do not dispute, that: on November 19, 1984, Commissioner Chester R. Simmons of 
the USFL, in accordance with the procedure set out at 28 C.F.R. ยง 50.6 (1984), requested a business review letter from the 
Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice stating its enforcement intentions with respect to the league's 
proposal to telecast its games on Saturday afternoons commencing in the fall of 1986. The USFL recognized that its plan, 
because it contemplated Saturday, rather than Sunday, telecasts was not exempted from the antitrust laws by the Sports 
Broadcasting Act of 1961, 15 U.S.C. ยงยง 1291-95, which grants a limited antitrust exemption to joint marketing of television rights 
by professional football, baseball, basketball, and hockey teams. On January 8, 1985, the government issued its business 
review letter expressing no intention to institute enforcement proceedings challenging the USFL plan. Declining to apply the per 
se rule to the plan, the government expressed the view that the exclusivity provisions were, given then current market 
conditions, procompetitive and therefore permissible under the rule of reason. The government enforcement intentions, however, 
were bound to market conditions. The review letter noted the disparity between television revenues of the NFL and the USFL.  
The government noted that the USFL is a ""new and struggling venture"" seeking to compete with the ""more established"" NFL. 
The government noted the importance of television revenues to the new league's ability to attract competitive athletic talent by 
offering comparable salaries and thus the significance of television revenues to the continued survival of the league. Relying on 
information provided by the USFL, the government assumed that the USFL drew far lower ratings and far smaller audience 
shares than the NFL, and that each USFL team therefore earned only $1.3 million in television revenues during 1984 as "
1204,," compared with $14 million for each NFL team. Because television revenue accounted for an average of 26.6 percent of each 
USFL club's total revenue, USFL clubs lost an average of $3.5 million in 1984 and were placed at a marked competitive 
disadvantage.  The USFL also represented to the government that the league had no power, even in the limited professional 
football market, that no network would contract for the television plan without the subject restrictions, and that without a 
television pact the USFL would die."
1204,12," In support of its contention that the USFL is not a viable competitor with CFA and Big Eight football, INTV has filed three 
newspaper articles about the USFL published in USA Today on April 25, 1985. These articles do nothing to settle the dispute 
about the USFL's competitive potential. They do report the league's financial difficulties and that the owners of the Tampa Bay 
Bandits intend to drop out of the league if the season is shifted to the fall, but they also report that the Bandits drew an average 
crowd of 46,854, including ticket giveaways, during the USFL's last season and that the New Jersey Generals drew an average 
crowd of 43,160, up 14 percent from 1984, and other positive developments. Moreover, INTV and SVC do not dispute CFA's 
contention that it has had 11 defections during the past year, and apparently do not believe that these defections signal the 
imminent collapse of CFA. The court simply cannot arrive at an informed conclusion about the competitive vigor of the USFL 
based upon the present record. "

1208,14," A ""crossover"" game is a game in which a CFA member competes with a non-member institution or a Big Eight member 
competes with an institution outside its own conference. It is undisputed that under the 1984 agreements, a CFA member could 
not contract for national network television rights to its games with non-members, or even if the game was ""passed"" by ABC and 
ESPN. It was this very restriction that was before the court in Regents of the University of California v. American Broadcasting 
Companies, Inc., 747 F.2d 511 (9th Cir. 1984), in which a game between Notre Dame, a CFA member, and USC, a Big 10-PAC 
10 member, was, before an injunction was entered, threatened with blackout by the ban on national telecasts of crossover 
games in conflict with the CFA plan."
1208,15," The court notes the striking similarities between the time period exclusivity provisions of the 1984 CFA television plan and the 
parallel terms of the proposed 1986 USFL television plan approved by the Department of Justice. Under the USFL plan, the 
league proposes to make a pool of one to four Saturday afternoon games available to its contracting television network. The 
network could select one game for national telecast or could show two or more games regionally. The network would have exclusive rights to the Saturday afternoon games, and games not selected could not be televised by 
the competing clubs. All other USFL games would be played on Saturday nights outside the exclusive window or on other days 
of the week. Each USFL team would retain and could assign telecast rights to its games within its home market except during 
the exclusive Saturday afternoon window. The proposed agreement would be in addition to an agreement between USFL and 
ESPN for evening cablecasts and a possible third agreement effectuating a network television plan for Sunday afternoons. The 
Department of Justice specifically considered the exclusivity clause and concluded that ""the USFL's proposed agreement, 
including the window of exclusivity, appears at the present time and under present market conditions to be reasonably 
necessary in order for the USFL to have a chance of surviving in competition with the NFL and thus providing additional 
competition in the market in which broadcast rights for professional football are sold, and other markets as well."" The 
government assumed when issuing its business review letter that the USFL would not survive without such a television plan. No 
such contention is made with respect to CFA or the Big Eight. The business review letter nonetheless underlines the importance 
of considering the purpose and effect of such restraints in the market in which they appear. Such consideration requires 
resolution of the many factual disputes that have been presented by these motions. "

(See conc. & dis. opn., post, at pp. 489-490.) The concurring and dissenting opinion also implicitly approves two other aspects of 
the Bruno opinion: the rejection of federal precedents holding fluid recovery to be unlawful ( Bruno, supra, 127 Cal.App.3d at pp. 
128-129), and the determination that fluid recovery is not barred under Blue Chip Stamps v. Superior Court, supra, 18 Cal.3d 
381 ( Bruno, supra, 127 Cal.App.3d at p. 126)."
1225,8, The following discussion owes much to the scholarly brief submitted by amici Consumers Union et al. 
1226,9," Similarly, the settlement in a more recent case provided for the defendant oil company to make annual contributions both to the 
State Department of Health Services, earmarked for environmental health purposes, and to the State Water Pollution Cleanup 
and Abatement Account.  (People ex rel. George Deukmejian v. Occidental Petroleum Corp.  (E.D.Cal. Feb. 6, 1981) Civ. No. 5-
79-989 [unpublished stipulated settlement included in the record of the present case].) Other examples abound.  (See, e.g., 
United States v. Exxon Corp. (D.D.C. 1983) 561 F.Supp. 816, 856-857, affd. in relevant part (T.E.C.A. 1985) 773 F.2d 1240, pp. 
1280-1287 [recovery in oil overcharge case paid to the United States Treasury for future distribution to states for use in state and 
federal energy conservation and related programs]; see generally, 3 Newberg, Class Actions, supra, ยง 4620, p. 86.)"
1226,10," Some commentators have suggested that the benefits of earmarked escheat may be diluted since there is nothing to prevent 
the Legislature from reducing appropriations to the recipient agency by the amount of the damage award.  (See, e.g., Durand, 
An Economic Analysis of Fluid Class Recovery Mechanisms (1981) 34 Stan.L.Rev. 173, 180-181 [hereafter Economic 
Analysis].) However, earmarked escheats can be conditioned on the state's promise not to divert previously budgeted funds.  
(See Cy Pres Remedy, supra, 39 U.Chi. L.Rev. at p. 458, fn. 42.) Though the court's ability to enforce such conditions may be 
limited, there is no reason to assume that the state would act in bad faith. "
1227,11," Of course, a court considering the allocation of funds to an existing private body must be mindful of possible conflicts of 
interest.  An organization seeking the right to administer class funds may view a large recovery as a pot of gold to fund projects 
ranked high on the group's own agenda but of little or no benefit to the class.  Trial courts are frequently called upon to make 
similar assessments when deciding whether a plaintiff seeking to maintain an action on behalf of a class will fairly and 
adequately represent the interests of all members of the class.  (See 4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Pleading, ยงยง 207- 
209, pp. 245-248.) Where such a conflict is identified, earmarked escheat or the creation of a new body to administer the 
consumer trust fund may provide suitable alternatives."
1227,12," Claimant fund sharing can be used as a method for distributing the residue -- that portion of the fund that remains after class 
members have proved their actual damages.  It also can be employed, as here, to distribute the entire fund to individual 
claimants on a pro-rata basis.  Had distribution in this case not been delayed by the appellate process, the class fund would 
have been distributed pro-rata, leaving little if any residue. "
1228,13," The reserve role of the parens patriae action is readily apparent from the fact that it, unlike the private class action, does not 
provide for the recovery of treble damages.  (ยง 16760, subd. (a)(2); ยง 16750, subd. (a).)"
1228,14," This conclusion is in no way altered where, as here, the two types of action are brought together and settled together.  To hold 
otherwise would penalize the Attorney General and the class for employing the parens patriae action in its intended role as a 
backup for private class actions.  In view of this conclusion, it is not necessary to decide whether the parens patriae statute "
1229,," operates retroactively to cover this action.  The alleged violations occurred in 1972-1976.  Section 16760 was enacted in 1977.  
(Stats. 1977, ch. 543, ยง 1, p. 1747.)"
1229,15," By contrast, the statute's approach is consistent with the character of the parens patriae action, which is less concerned with 
compensation.  ""The most reasonable interpretation of section 16760, subdivision (e) is that the Legislature has sanctioned the 
use of a civil action by the Attorney General . . . regardless of the compensatory effect of the action."" ( Bruno, supra, 127 
Cal.App.3d at pp. 133-134.) "
1230,1," By comparison, the concerns weighing against an emphasis on class participation and dissent are far stronger at the class 
certification stage.  If the class is not certified, the harm caused by the defendant's violation may never be remedied in any 
fashion.  (Cf.  Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc. (5th Cir. 1969) 417 F.2d 1122, 1124 [differences among class 
members held not to warrant denial of certification, but subclassing and intervention might be necessary at the remedial stage].) "
1231,2," Though not binding on this court, federal law concerning class action procedures has been applied where consistent with 
California law and policy.  (See La Sala v. American Sav. & Loan Assn. (1971) 5 Cal.3d 864, 872 [97 Cal.Rptr. 849, 489 P.2d 
1113]; compare Bruno v. Superior Court (1981) 127 Cal.App.3d 120, 128 [179 Cal.Rptr. 342] [rejecting federal case law that was 
inconsistent with California policy].) "
1232,3," According to the record, up to 344 persons may have informed the court that they wished to object at the fairness hearing. In its findings of fact, the trial court stated that ""345 persons, including the intervenor, filed objections to the proposed settlement 
in accordance with the terms of the class notice."" The class notice stated: ""If you wish to object to the settlement, you must file a 
notice of intention to appear and state all of the reasons you object to the proposed settlement in writing by April 6, 1981."" The 
intervener informed the court of her intention to appear.  There is nothing in the record to indicate that the other 344 objectors 
did not do likewise. "
1233,4," It should be noted that the courts are not mechanically bound by expressions of class opposition.  ( Flinn, supra, 528 F.2d at p. 
1173; Bryan, supra, 494 F.2d at p. 803.) The many arguments against placing undue reliance on majority sentiment are 
discussed in Rhode, supra, 34 Stan.L.Rev. at pages 1232-1242."

at para. 50. Plaintiffs also allege that Pendleton used various means to sanction its sales force including shifting territory from 
non-cooperating representatives, subjecting them to disparagement, refusing them permission to carry other lines of clothing, 
interfering with their accounts, evaluating them harshly, dismissing some, and forcing others into early retirement. Id. at para. 60.

administrative agency that can provide relief to the aggrieved individual, 29 U.S.C. ยง 633(b). Plaintiffs concededly commenced 
the appropriate actions before both the EEOC and the New York Department of Human Rights. "
1247,3," HN3[
] Not all discussions between a manufacturer and its distributors about prices amount to unlawful resale price 
maintenance agreements. Naked suggestions for resale prices unaccompanied by threats or sanctions for non-compliance 
create no legal problems even though most distributors ultimately comply with the suggestions.  Yentsch v. Texaco, 630 F.2d 46, 
53 (2d Cir. 1980); see generally VII P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law (1986) (""VII Areeda & Turner"") ยง 1440. A 
manufacturer may also dictate resale prices to its agents and enforce their compliance with such prices.  Finally, manufacturers 
may freely select or terminate distributors, so long as they act independently in doing so. Section 1 of the Sherman Act requires that there be a ""contract, combination . . . or conspiracy"" between the manufacturer 
and other distributors in order to establish a violation.  15 U.S.C. ยง 1. Independent action is not proscribed. A manufacturer 
of course generally has a right to deal, or refuse to deal, with whomever it likes, as long as it does so independently.  United 
States v. Colgate & Co., 250 U.S. 300, 307, 63 L. Ed. 992, 39 S. Ct. 465 (1919); cf.  United States v. Parke Davis & Co., 
362 U.S. 29, 4 L. Ed. 2d 505, 80 S. Ct. 503 (1960). Under Colgate, the manufacturer can announce its resale prices in 
advance and refuse to deal with those who fail to comply. And a distributor is free to acquiesce in the manufacturer's 
demand in order to avoid termination. Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 104 S. Ct. 1464, 1469, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775 (1984). HN4[
] The 
Sherman Act prohibits only price-fixing agreements. ""Thus the manufacturers strongly felt concern about resale prices does not 
necessarily mean that it has done more than the Colgate doctrine allows."" Id. at 1470. A plaintiff must plead and prove an 
agreement as a necessary predicate to succeeding in an antitrust action alleging such an unlawful scheme. Although a plaintiff 
may introduce circumstantial evidence to prove the agreement, in the ""inference of such an agreement . . . from highly 
ambiguous evidence, there is the considerable danger that the doctrine[] enunciated in . . . Colgate will be seriously eroded."" Id. 
Thus a plaintiff may not rely solely on actions by a manufacturer following complaints about price cutters, or actions that 
depended on information provided by distributors, but rather ""must [supply] evidence that tends to exclude the possibility that the 
manufacturer and nonterminated distributor were acting independently."" Id. at 1471. One commentator has suggested that 
evidence of ""complex"" as opposed to simple enforcement of announced conditions will support the necessary finding of an 
agreement. VII Areeda & Turner, supra, at ยง 1446, as will a finding of individualized negotiation or distributor admission of an 
agreement, id. at ยง 1447. Without passing on the sufficiency of such allegations, or that quantum of evidence that would likely be necessary to establish 
them at trial, the Court notes that in the amended complaint plaintiffs propose plaintiffs do allege an enforcement mechanism 
and other actions by Pendleton that far exceed the ""simple announcement of conditions for dealing followed by termination 
degree of enforcement permitted under Colgate, as recently reviewed in Monsanto. Plaintiffs, for example, would allege direct 
negotiations with discounters in which Pendleton sought assurances that they would bring their prices up to approved levels. 
Proposed Amended Complaint at paras. 50, 51."
1247,4," The Court reads plaintiffs' complaint to allege an unlawful resale price maintenance agreement and not, as defendant 
suggests, a violation of the 1979 consent decree. Accordingly, the Court need not consider the legal effect of the decree nor 
whether plaintiffs could properly sue Pendleton for violating the conditions of that decree. "

1248,6," The Act provides further that such persons may sue ""in any district court of the United States in the district in which the 
defendant resides or is found or has an agent, without respect to the amount in controversy. . . ."" 15 U.S.C. ยง 15. Pendleton 
does not dispute that, assuming plaintiffs have standing to sue under the antitrust laws, it may properly be sued in this district."
1248,7," Psychologists had suffered distinct injuries for which they also brought suit, but they could not claim the particular aspect of 
damage, the out of pocket payment to her psychologist, that McCready asserted. The Virginia Academy of Clinical Psychologists 
filed a complaint similar to McCready's against the same defendants which the Virginia district court allowed to proceed.  
McCready, supra, 457 U.S. at 469 n.4. "
1252,8," The absence of specific intent on the part of Pendleton to harm its sales representatives does not determine the standing 
question. As the Supreme Court held, ""the availability of the ยง 4 remedy to some person who claims its benefit is not a question 
of the specific intent of the conspirators. Here the remedy cannot reasonably be restricted to those competitors whom the 
conspirators hoped to eliminate from the market."" McCready, supra, 457 U.S. at 479 (quoted in Associated General, supra, 459 
U.S. at 537). "
1253,9," See Michigan Note, supra, at 1864-65. "
1255,10," Even without the Second Circuit's suggestion that cases decided prior to Associated General and McCready provide little 
useful guidance, the Court would note that the cases argued by Pendleton provide at best only mixed support for its position. 
The Third Circuit in Bravman v. Bassett Furniture Industries, Inc., 552 F.2d 90 (3rd Cir. 1977), upheld standing for a terminated 
sales representative who alleged antitrust violations against the furniture manufacturer whose goods he sold. Although the circuit 
court there upheld a jury verdict for the plaintiff on the basis that plaintiff had in fact competed with the defendant following his 
termination, the court acknowledged at the same time ""that ยง 4 standing analysis is essentially a balancing test comprised of 
many constant and variable factors and that there is no talismanic test capable of resolving all ยง 4 standing problems."" 552 F.2d 
at 99. In making that observation, the court declined to accept the defendant's characterization of precedent in the Third Circuit 
as limiting standing to competitors only.  552 F.2d at 100. The circuit court furthermore specifically rejected the defendant's 
attempt to analogize the position of the sales representative plaintiff to that of either the officers or stockholders of a corporate 
antitrust victim, 552 F.2d at 97, or that of a lessor to such a corporate victim, 552 F.2d at 98-99, arguments that Pendleton has 
urged upon this Court. Both McNulty v. Borden Inc., 542 F. Supp. 655 (E.D. Pa. 1982), and Booth v. Radio Shack Division, Tandy Corp., 1982-83 Trade 
Cas. para. 65,001 (E.D. Pa. 1982), two cases on which Pendleton also relies, involved employee claims against their former 
employers for alleged violations of the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 13 et seq. In both cases, the district courts looked to 
the purposes of the Robinson-Patman Act to determine whether the plaintiffs' protection was a fundamental purpose of the 
antitrust law at issue. In both case, the courts found the primary purpose of the Robinson-Patman Act to be to protect 
purchasers and competitors, not employees, and therefore the courts denied standing to plaintiffs on that ground. That analysis 
would not necessarily dictate the same result for Sherman Act violations. The court in McNulty further noted that it was ""not unmindful of the weighty policy considerations recently put forth by the Ninth 
Circuit in granting standing to an employee fired for refusing to carry out policies allegedly violative of ยง 1 of the Sherman Act [in 
Ostrofe I],"" 542 F. Supp. at 661, but felt constrained in that case by Third Circuit precedent requiring that injury directly result 
from the economic effects of the alleged violation. Cf.  Callahan v. Scott Paper Co., 541 F. Supp. 550, 560-61 (E.D. Pa. 1982) (in 
denying standing to employee plaintiff in suit brought under Robinson-Patman Act, court expressed opinion that Ostrofe I was 
wrongly decided). It is worth noting that another court within the Third Circuit, also employing the Bravman balancing test 
discussed above, granted antitrust standing to a terminated employee.  Shaw v. Russell Trucking Line, Inc., 542 F. Supp. 776, 
780-81 (W.D. Pa. 1982). The district court in Shaw found that the plaintiff's injury flowed immediately and directly from his 
termination allegedly for refusing to participate in what the court assumed were Sherman Act violations.  542 F. Supp. at 780-81. 
The court in Shaw explicitly adopted the Ninth Circuit's assessment of relevant policy considerations in Ostrofe I in reaching its 
conclusion that terminated employees have standing to sue under the antitrust laws.  542 F. Supp. at 780. "
1257,11," Without deciding the question, the Court notes that the weight of authority and policy lean toward according FTCA 
proceedings the same tolling effect as government proceedings under the Clayton and Sherman Acts. Indeed, FTC actions 
under 15 U.S.C. ยง 45 may concern conduct that also violates the Sherman or Clayton Acts. See Rader v. Balfour, 440 F.2d 469 
(7th Cir. 1971); see also Wendkos v. ABC Consolidated Corp., 379 F. Supp. 15, 22 (E.D. Pa. 1974); In re Antibiotic Antitrust 
Actions, 333 F. Supp. 317, 320 (S.D.N.Y. 1971) (look to acts underlying proceeding); Lippa's Inc. v. Lenox Inc., 305 F. Supp. "
1258,182," , 185-88 (D. Vt. 1969). For purposes of determining the limitations period on plaintiffs' antitrust claim, therefore, the Court will 
accept the reasoning of the Fourth Circuit in Rader as persuasive, and will assume that the FTC proceeding at issue here should 
be given the same tolling effect as would a proceeding brought under the Clayton or Sherman Acts."
1258,12," Accepting plaintiffs' contentions and further assuming the consent order was filed on July 31, 1979, the date that appears on 
the order itself, the action could have remained pending only until October 1, 1979.  Plaintiffs would have to have brought suit by 
October 1, 1980 to gain any advantage from the pendency of the FTC proceeding even under this tolling theory. This they failed 
to do."
1258,13," In square contradiction to the express wording of the statute, plaintiffs would have the Court stretch the statute of limitations by 
tacking together the four years of 15 U.S.C. ยง 15(b), the time during the pendency of the FTC investigation, and the one year 
following the termination of the proceeding. The Second Circuit, in an opinion by Judge Hand, long ago rejected just such a 
whimsical reading of the statute.  Herman Schwabe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 274 F.2d 608, 610 (2d Cir. 1960), 
cert. denied 363 U.S. 811, 4 L. Ed. 2d 1153, 80 S. Ct. 1247 (1960); see also Stewart Aviation Co. v. Piper Aircraft Corp., 372 F. 
Supp. 876, 878 (M.D. Pa. 1974); Fleischer v. A.A.P. Inc, 180 F. Supp. 717 (S.D.N.Y. 1959), aff'd, 329 F.2d 424 (2d Cir. 1964). "
1267,1," With respect to the common law abuse-of-process claim, the jury specifically found that neither the Maryland suit nor the patent 
protest constituted an abuse of process.  Joint Appendix at 72.  This finding was not disturbed by the trial judge and was not 
presented to us on appeal. "
1268,2," Doubts have been expressed about the frequency, or even the existence, of much alleged predatory behavior because of the 
great costs such behavior inflicts upon the predator. Predatory price-cutting, for example, requires the would-be monopolist to 
expand output, and so depress the market price, sufficiently to make the intended victim lose money.  The difficulty is that the 
predator must also sell at a loss and to a much larger part of the market, particularly if the victim cuts back production during the 
period of the assault.  This fact makes price-cutting a relatively unappealing mode of aggression.  Sham litigation, however, does 
not suffer from this drawback since the litigation costs of the predator need not be any larger than those of the victim, either 
proportionately or absolutely.  There is, in addition, the prospect that a court or agency order may keep the victim from operating 
at all until the litigation is concluded, when, since the litigation is a sham, the victim, if it survives, will presumably win."
1268,3," Viewing the matter from a perspective congenial to antitrust policy, it may be said that the possession of legal rights contributes 
to a company's efficiency in the same way that possession of any other asset does, so that the legitimate assertion of a legal 
right against a competitor, however, damaging to the competitor, or even to competition, that may be, does not constitute 
monopolizing or attempting to monopolize within the meaning of the Sherman Act. "
1283,1," Scher was also a plaintiff in the lawsuit, and joined Gregory in filing this appeal. However, it was conceded below that Scher 
lacked standing as an individual to bring suit, and that his claim was entirely derivative of Gregory's."
1283,2," The Act states, in pertinent part, that HN1[
] it shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, either directly or 
indirectly, to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality, . . . where the 
effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of

of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them. . . ."" 15 U.S.C. ยง 13(a)."
1283,3," Section 1 of the Clayton Act defines ""antitrust laws"" as the Sherman Act, the Wilson Tariff Act, and the Clayton Act. This

1285,5," None of the Supreme Court's antitrust standing cases involved alleged violations of the Robinson-Patman Act. However, those 
cases interpret ยง 4 of the Clayton Act, the same provision governing Gregory's standing to bring suit in this case, and we thus 
apply the general principles developed in the Sherman Act cases in light of the particular law creating the substantive antitrust 
violation. See, e.g., Schoenkopf v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 637 F.2d 205, 210-211 (3d Cir. 1980)."
1285,6," Section 2 of the Robinson-Patman Act, an amendment to the Clayton Act, was enacted in 1936 in response to growing

1299,1," NUE had filed its complaint four years earlier, in the District Court for the District of New Jersey.  Zenith's complaint was filed 
separately in 1974, in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.  The two cases were consolidated in the Eastern District of 
Pennsylvania in 1974. "
1300,2," The inadmissible evidence included various government records and reports, Zenith Radio Corp. v. Matsushita Electric 
Industrial Co., 505 F.Supp. 1125 (ED Pa. 1980), business documents offered pursuant to various hearsay exceptions, Zenith 
Radio Corp. v. Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., 505 F.Supp. 1190 (ED Pa. 1980), and a large portion of the expert 
testimony that respondents proposed to introduce.  Zenith Radio Corp. v. Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., 505 F.Supp. 1313

1300,3," The District Court ruled separately that petitioners were entitled to summary judgment on respondents' claims under the 
Antidumping Act of 1916.  Zenith Radio Corp. v. Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., 494 F.Supp. 1190 (ED Pa. 1980). 
Respondents appealed this ruling, and the Court of Appeals reversed in a separate opinion issued the same day as the opinion 
concerning respondents' other claims.  In re Japanese Electronic Products Antitrust Litigation, 723 F.2d 319 (CA3 1983). LEdHN[2B][
] [2B]Petitioners ask us to review the Court of Appeals' Antidumping Act decision along with its decision on the 
rest of this mammoth case.  The Antidumping Act claims were not, however, mentioned in the questions presented in the petition 
for certiorari, and they have not been independently argued by the parties.  See this Court's Rule 21.1(a).  We therefore decline 
the invitation to review the Court of Appeals' decision on those claims. "
1301,4," As to 3 of the 24 defendants, the Court of Appeals affirmed the entry of summary judgment. Petitioners are the 21 defendants 
who remain in the case."
1301,5," In addition to these inferences, the court noted that there was expert opinion evidence that petitioners' export sales ""generally 
were at prices which produced losses, often as high as twenty-five percent on sales."" 723 F.2d, at 311. The court did not identify 
any direct evidence of below-cost pricing; nor did it place particularly heavy reliance on this aspect of the expert evidence.  See 
n. 19, infra. "
1302,6," The Sherman Act does reach conduct outside our borders, but only when the conduct has an effect on American commerce.  
Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 704 (1962) (""A conspiracy to monopolize or restrain the 
domestic or foreign commerce of the United States is not outside the reach of the Sherman Act just because part of the conduct 
complained of occurs in foreign countries"").  The effect on which respondents rely is the artificially depressed level of prices for 
CEPs in the United States. Petitioners' alleged cartelization of the Japanese market could not have caused that effect over a period of some two decades.  
Once petitioners decided, as respondents allege, to reduce output and raise prices in the Japanese market, they had the option 
of either producing fewer goods or selling more goods in other markets.  The most plausible conclusion is that petitioners chose 
the latter option because it would be more profitable than the former.  That choice does not flow from the cartelization of the 
Japanese market.  On the contrary, were the Japanese market perfectly competitive petitioners would still have to choose 
whether to sell goods overseas, and would still presumably make that choice based on their profit expectations.  For this reason, 
respondents' theory of recovery depends on proof of the asserted price-cutting conspiracy in this country."
1302,7," Respondents also argue that the check prices, the five company rule, and the price fixing in Japan are all part of one large 
conspiracy that includes monopolization of the American market through predatory pricing. The argument is mistaken.  However 
one decides to describe the contours of the asserted conspiracy -- whether there is one conspiracy or several -- respondents 
must show that the conspiracy caused them an injury for which the antitrust laws provide relief.  Associated General Contractors 
of California, Inc. v. Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 538-540 (1983); Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 488- "
1303,489," (1977); see also Note, Antitrust Standing, Antitrust Injury, and the Per Se Standard, 93 Yale L.J. 1309 (1984). That showing 
depends in turn on proof that petitioners conspired to price predatorily in the American market, since the other conduct involved 
in the alleged conspiracy cannot have caused such an injury."
1303,8," Throughout this opinion, we refer to the asserted conspiracy as one to price ""predatorily."" This term has been used chiefly in 
cases in which a single firm, having a dominant share of the relevant market, cuts its prices in order to force competitors out of 
the market, or perhaps to deter potential entrants from coming in.  E. g., Southern Pacific Communications Co. v. American 
Telephone & Telegraph Co., 238 U. S. App. D. C. 309, 331-336, 740 F.2d 980, 1002-1007 (1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1005 
(1985). In such cases, ""predatory pricing"" means pricing below some appropriate measure of cost.  E. g., Barry Wright Corp. v. 
ITT Grinnell Corp., 724 F.2d 227, 232-235 (CA1 1983); see Utah Pipe Co. v. Continental Baking Co., 386 U.S. 685, 698, 701, 
702, n. 14 (1967). LEdHN[7B][
] [7B]There is a good deal of debate, both in the cases and in the law reviews, about what ""cost"" is relevant in such cases.  We need not resolve this debate here, because unlike the cases cited above, this is a Sherman Act ยง 1 case.  For 
purposes of this case, it is enough to note that respondents have not suffered an antitrust injury unless petitioners conspired to 
drive respondents out of the relevant markets by (i) pricing below the level necessary to sell their products, or (ii) pricing below 
some appropriate measure of cost.  An agreement without these features would either leave respondents in the same position 
as would market forces or would actually benefit respondents by raising market prices.  Respondents therefore may not 
complain of conspiracies that, for example, set maximum prices above market levels, or that set minimum prices at any level."
1303,9," We do not consider whether recovery should ever be available on a theory such as respondents' when the pricing in question is 
above some measure of incremental cost.  See generally Areeda & Turner, Predatory Pricing and Related Practices Under 
Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 88 Harv. L. Rev. 697, 709-718 (1975) (discussing cost-based test for use in ยง 2 cases).  As a 
practical matter, it may be that only direct evidence of below-cost pricing is sufficient to overcome the strong inference that 
rational businesses would not enter into conspiracies such as this one.  See Part IV-A, infra."
1303,10," Respondents argued before the District Court that petitioners had failed to carry their initial burden under Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure 56(c) of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.  See Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 
144, 157 (1970). Cf.  Catrett v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., 244 U. S. App. D. C. 160, 756 F.2d 181, cert. granted, 474 U.S. 944 
(1985). That issue was resolved in petitioners' favor, and is not before us."
1303,11," Rule 56(e) provides, in relevant part: HN1[
] ""When a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest 
upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleading, but his response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, must "
1304,," set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.  If he does not so respond, summary judgment, if 
appropriate, shall be entered against him."""
1304,12," See n. 10, supra. "
1306,13," NUE's complaint alleges that petitioners' conspiracy began as early as 1960; the starting date used in Zenith's complaint is 
1953.  NUE Complaint para. 52; Zenith Complaint para. 39."
1306,14," During the same period, the number of American firms manufacturing television sets declined from 19 to 13.  5 App. to Brief 
for Appellant in No. 81-2331 (CA3), p. 1961a.  This decline continued a trend that began at least by 1960, when petitioners' 
sales in the United States market were negligible.  Ibid.  See Zenith Complaint paras. 35, 37."
1306,15," Respondents offer no reason to suppose that entry into the relevant market is especially difficult, yet without barriers to entry it 
would presumably be impossible to maintain supracompetitive prices for an extended time.  Judge Easterbrook, commenting on 
this case in a law review article, offers the following sensible assessment: ""The plaintiffs [in this case] maintain that for the last fifteen years or more at least ten Japanese manufacturers have sold TV 
sets at less than cost in order to drive United States firms out of business.  Such conduct cannot possibly produce profits by 
harming competition, however.  If the Japanese firms drive some United States firms out of business, they could not recoup. 
Fifteen years of losses could be made up only by very high prices for the indefinite future.  (The losses are like investments, 
which must be recovered with compound interest.) If the defendants should try to raise prices to such a level, they would attract 
new competition.  There are no barriers to entry into electronics, as the proliferation of computer and audio firms shows.  The 
competition would come from resurgent United States firms, from other foreign firms (Korea and many other nations make TV 
sets), and from defendants themselves.  In order to recoup, the Japanese firms would need to suppress competition among 
themselves.  On plaintiffs' theory, the cartel would need to last at least thirty years, far longer than any in history, even when 
cartels were not illegal.  None should be sanguine about the prospects of such a cartel, given each firm's incentive to shave 
price and expand its share of sales.  The predation recoupment story therefore does not make sense, and we are left with the 
more plausible inference that the Japanese firms did not sell below cost in the first place.  They were just engaged in hard 
competition."" Easterbrook, The Limits of Antitrust, 63 Texas L. Rev. 1, 26-27 (1984) (footnotes omitted)."
1306,16," The alleged predatory scheme makes sense only if petitioners can recoup their losses.  In light of the large number of firms 
involved here, petitioners can achieve this only by engaging in some form of price fixing after they have succeeded in driving 
competitors from the market.  Such price fixing would, of course, be an independent violation of ยง 1 of the Sherman Act. United 
States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150 (1940). "
1307,17," The predators' losses must actually increase as the conspiracy nears its objective: the greater the predators' market share, the 
more products the predators sell; but since every sale brings with it a loss, an increase in market share also means an increase 
in predatory losses."
1307,18," The same is true of any supposed excess production capacity that petitioners may have possessed.  The existence of plant 
capacity that exceeds domestic demand does tend to establish the ability to sell products abroad.  It does not, however, provide 
a motive for selling at prices lower than necessary to obtain sales; nor does it explain why petitioners would be willing to lose 
money in the United States market without some reasonable prospect of recouping their investment."
1307,19," Respondents also rely on an expert study suggesting that petitioners have sold their products in the American market at 
substantial losses.  The relevant study is not based on actual cost data; rather, it consists of expert opinion based on a 
mathematical construction that in turn rests on assumptions about petitioners' costs.  The District Court analyzed those 
assumptions in some detail and found them both implausible and inconsistent with record evidence.  Zenith Radio Corp. v. 
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., 505 F.Supp., at 1356-1363. Although the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's finding 
that the expert report was inadmissible, the court did not disturb the District Court's analysis of the factors that substantially 
undermine the probative value of that evidence.  See 723 F.2d, at 277-282. We find the District Court's analysis persuasive.  
Accordingly, in our view the expert opinion evidence of below-cost pricing has little probative value in comparison with the 
economic factors, discussed in Part IV-A, supra, that suggest that such conduct is irrational. "
1308,20," The Court of Appeals correctly reasoned that the five company rule might tend to insulate petitioners from competition with 
each other.  723 F.2d, at 306. But this effect is irrelevant to a conspiracy to price predatorily.  Petitioners have no incentive to 
underprice each other if they already are pricing below the level at which they could sell their goods.  The far more plausible 
inference from a customer allocation agreement such as the five company rule is that petitioners were conspiring to raise prices, 
by limiting their ability to take sales away from each other.  Respondents -- petitioners' competitors -- suffer no harm from a 
conspiracy to raise prices.  Supra, at 582-583.  Moreover, it seems very unlikely that the five company rule had any significant 
effect of any kind, since the ""rule"" permitted petitioners to sell to their American subsidiaries, and did not limit the number of 
distributors to which the subsidiaries could resell.  513 F.Supp., at 1190. "
1309,21," We do not imply that, if petitioners had had a plausible reason to conspire, ambiguous conduct could suffice to create a triable 
issue of conspiracy. Our decision in Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U.S. 752 (1984), establishes that HN5[
] 
conduct that is as consistent with permissible competition as with illegal conspiracy does not, without more, support even an 
inference of conspiracy. Id., at 763-764. See supra, at 588. "
1310,1," The Court adequately summarizes the quite fact-specific holding in Cities Service.  Ante, at 587. In Monsanto, the Court held that a manufacturer's termination of a price-cutting distributor after receiving a complaint from 
another distributor is not, standing alone, sufficient to create a jury question.  465 U.S., at 763-764. To understand this holding, it 
is important to realize that under United States v. Colgate & Co., 250 U.S. 300 (1919), it is permissible for a manufacturer to 
announce retail prices in advance and terminate those who fail to comply, but that under Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park & 
Sons Co., 220 U.S. 373 (1911), it is impermissible for the manufacturer and its distributors to agree on the price at which the 
distributors will sell the goods.  Thus, a manufacturer's termination of a price-cutting distributor after receiving a complaint from 
another distributor is lawful under Colgate, unless the termination is pursuant to a shared understanding between the 
manufacturer and its distributors respecting enforcement of a resale price maintenance scheme.  Monsanto holds that to 
establish liability under Dr. Miles, more is needed than evidence of behavior that is consistent with a distributor's exercise of its 
prerogatives under Colgate.  Thus, ""[there] must be evidence that tends to exclude the possibility that the manufacturer and 
nonterminated distributors were acting independently."" 465 U.S., at 764. Monsanto does not hold that if a terminated dealer 
produces some further evidence of conspiracy beyond the bare fact of postcomplaint termination, the judge hearing a motion for 
summary judgment should balance all the evidence pointing toward conspiracy against all the evidence pointing toward 
independent action. "
1311,2," Dr. DePodwin summarizes his view of the harm caused by Japanese cartelization as follows: ""When we consider the injuries inflicted on United States producers, we must again look at the Japanese television 
manufacturers' export agreement as part of a generally collusive scheme embracing the Japanese domestic market as well.  
This scheme increased the supply of television receivers to the United States market while restricting supply in the Japanese 
market.  If Japanese manufacturers had competed in both domestic and export markets, they would have sold more in the 
domestic market and less in the United States.  A greater proportion of Japanese production capacity would have been devoted 
to domestic sales.  Domestic prices would have been lower and export prices would have been higher.  The size of the price 
differential between domestic and export markets would have diminished practically to the vanishing point.  Consequently, 
competition among Japanese producers in both markets would have resulted in reducing exports to the United States and 
United States prices would have risen.  In addition, investment by the United States industry would have increased.  As it was, 
however, the influx of sets at depressed prices cut the rates of return on television receiver production facilities in the United 
States to so low a level as to make such investment uneconomic. ""We can therefore conclude that the American manufacturers of television receivers would have made larger sales at higher 
prices in the absence of the Japanese cartel agreements.  Thus, the collusive behavior of Japanese television manufacturers 
resulted in a very severe injury to those American television manufacturers, particularly to National Union Electric Corporation, 
which produced a preponderance of television sets with screen sizes of nineteen inches and lower, especially those in the lower 
range of prices."" 5 App. to Brief for Appellants in No. 81-2331 (CA3), pp. 1629a-1630a."
1311,3," The DePodwin Report has this, among other things, to say in summarizing the harm to respondents caused by the five 
company rule, exchange of production data, price coordination, and other allegedly anti-competitive practices of petitioners: ""The impact of Japanese anti-competitive practices on United States manufacturers is evident when one considers the nature of 
competition.  When a market is fully competitive, firms pit their resources against one another in an attempt to secure the 
business of individual customers.  However, when firms collude, they violate a basic tenet of competitive behavior, i. e., that they 
act independently.  United States firms were confronted with Japanese competitors who collusively were seeking to destroy their 
established customer relationships.  Each Japanese company had targeted customers which it could service with reasonable 
assurance that its fellow Japanese cartel members would not become involved.  But just as importantly, each Japanese firm 
would be assured that what was already a low price level for Japanese television receivers in the United States market would 
not be further depressed by the actions of its Japanese associates. "
1312,," ""The result was a phenomenal growth in exports, particularly to the United States.  Concurrently, Japanese manufacturers, and 
the defendants in particular, made large investments in new plant and equipment and expanded production capacity.  It is 
obvious, therefore, that the effect of the Japanese cartel's concerted actions was to generate a larger volume of investment in 
the Japanese television industry than would otherwise have been the case.  This added capacity both enabled and encouraged 
the Japanese to penetrate the United States market more deeply than they would have had they competed lawfully."" Id., at 
1628a-1629a. For a more complete statement of DePodwin's explanation of how the alleged cartel operated, and the harms it caused 
respondents, see id., at 1609a-1642a.  This material is summarized in a chart found id., at 1633a."
1312,4," In holding that Parts IV and V of the Report had been improperly excluded, the Court of Appeals said: ""The trial court found that DePodwin did not use economic expertise in reaching the opinion that the defendants participated in a 
Japanese television cartel. 505 F.Supp. at 1342-46. We have examined the excluded portions of Parts IV and V in light of the 
admitted portions, and we conclude that this finding is clearly erroneous.  As a result, the court also held the opinions to be 
unhelpful to the factfinder. What the court in effect did was to eliminate all parts of the report in which the expert economist, after 
describing the conditions in the respective markets, the opportunities for collusion, the evidence pointing to collusion, the terms 
of certain undisputed agreements, and the market behavior, expressed the opinion that there was concert of action consistent 
with plaintiffs' conspiracy theory.  Considering the complexity of the economic issues involved, it simply cannot be said that such 
an opinion would not help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or determine that fact in issue."" In re Japanese Electronics 
Products Antitrust Litigation, 723 F.2d 238, 280 (1983). The Court of Appeals had similar views about Parts VI and VII."
1312,5," I use the Third Circuit's analysis of the five company rule by way of example; the court did an equally careful analysis of the 
parts the cartel activity in Japan and the check prices could have played in an actionable conspiracy. See generally id., at 303-
311. "
1313,," In discussing the five-company rule, I do not mean to imply any conclusion on the validity of petitioners' sovereign compulsion 
defense.  Since the Court does not reach this issue, I see no need of my addressing it. "
