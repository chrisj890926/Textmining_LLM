26,1," See In re Superior Court Trial Lawyers Association, et al., Opinion of the Commission, 107 F.T.C. 562 (1986), hereinafter 
referred to as ""FTC Decision."" The Initial Decision of the Administrative Law Judge will be referred to as ""I.D."" and the numbered 
findings in that decision will be referred to as ""I.D.F.    ."" Citations to testimony and exhibits in the record will refer to the Joint 
Appendix (JA) filed in this court by the parties. "
27,2," The Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides that ""in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . 
to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence."" In Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U.S. 25, 32 L. Ed. 2d 530, 92 S. Ct. 2006 
(1972), the Supreme Court held that this provision required that counsel be provided whenever the defendant might suffer a loss 
of liberty."
27,3," I.D.F. 24; the record suggests that the CJA regulars received fewer appointments after the rate increase ""whether they like it or 
not."" Testimony of Perrotta at 677, JA 161."
27,4," At the time of the boycott, D.C. Code Ann. § 11-2604(a) capped compensation at the hourly scale established by 18 U.S.C. § 
3006A(d)(2), the federal CJA statute."
27,5," Following the boycott, the limit was increased administratively to $50,000. See I.D.F. 29. "
28,6," Petitioners routinely used the word ""strike"" to describe their concerted refusal to accept new cases. Petitioners have not 
suggested, however, that they are ""employees"" within the meaning of § 20 of the Clayton Act, 29 U.S.C. § 52 (1982), which 
limits the granting of injunctions ""in any case between an employer and employees, . . . involving, or growing out of, a dispute 
concerning terms or conditions of employment,"" or that SCTLA is a ""labor organization"" within the meaning of § 6 of the same 
Act, 15 U.S.C. § 17 (1982), which provides that ""nothing contained in the antitrust laws shall be construed to forbid the existence 
and operation of labor . . . organizations, instituted for the purposes of mutual help; . . . nor shall such organizations, or the 
members thereof, be held or construed to be illegal combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade, under the antitrust laws."" 
We therefore accept the FTC's considered characterization of SCTLA's action as a ""boycott,"" as that term is used in antitrust 
parlance. "
30,7," The complaint is based upon petitioners' ""coercive, concerted refusal to deal [i.e., to accept new cases] for the purpose of 
increasing the CJA fees,"" and ""not upon their price agreement alone nor upon their preboycott collective efforts to persuade the 
city government, solely by the force of argument, to raise the fees."" FTC Decision, 107 F.T.C. at 573. "
32,8," The finding that the boycott was intended to ""coerce"" the city into agreeing to a rate increase is not inconsistent with the 
petitioners' claim, discussed infra in sections V and VI, that their actions also served as a means of dramatizing their opposition 
to the prevailing rates."
32,9," Cf.  Federal Baseball Club of Baltimore, Inc. v. National League, 259 U.S. 200, 66 L. Ed. 898, 42 S. Ct. 465 (1922) (national 
pastime not ""commerce"" within Sherman Act); Flood v. Kuhn, 407 U.S. 258, 282-84, 32 L. Ed. 2d 728, 92 S. Ct. 2099 (1972) 
(acknowledging that professional baseball is ""engaged in interstate commerce"" but leaving to Congress any change in the 
""aberration"" established by Federal Baseball). "
33,10," We do not read petitioners' characterization of the market for CJA services as ""price fixed,"" to suggest that the District of 
Columbia is a ""monopsonist,"" i.e., that it is the near exclusive purchaser of their services and is therefore capable of exerting 
market power over the price they are paid for their work. The record would not support such a claim, nor have petitioners argued 
that it is a defense (which would surely fail) that the victim of the boycott possessed monopsony power. See Keifer-Stewart Co. 
v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, 340 U.S. 211, 214, 95 L. Ed. 219, 71 S. Ct. 259 (1951) (no defense of price-fixing by 
manufacturers that wholesale purchasers had fixed resale prices)."
33,11," Any individual lawyer is free to decline work at an unacceptable price, of course; the Sherman Act operates only against 
contracts, combinations, and conspiracies, and attempts thereat. "
34,12," The conclusion that a restraint is illegal ""per se"" may mean not only that the court will not consider any justification offered in 
support of it but also that it may be condemned without any proof that it had an adverse effect on competition. The issue of 
whether the Commission must prove ""market power"" or price ""effect"" on the facts of this case is discussed infra in section VI. "
35,13," Cf.  Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U.S. 748, 769, 48 L. Ed. 2d 346, 96 S. Ct. 
1817 (1976) (rejecting a claim that a ban on advertising by pharmacists was necessary to ensure quality and noting that ""there is 
no claim that the advertising ban in any way prevents the cutting of corners by the pharmacist who is so inclined. That 
pharmacist is likely to cut corners in any event. The only effect the advertising ban has on him is to insulate him from price 
competition and to open the way for him to make a substantial, and perhaps even excessive, profit in addition to providing an 
inferior service."")"
35,14," See, e.g., Testimony of Cheryl D. Stein at 61, JA 446; Testimony of Slaight at 81, JA 473; cf. Testimony of Perrotta at 729, JA 
195 (increased respect from judges). "
36,15," See Testimony of Addison at 886-88, JA 254-56."

at 462-64 (1964)."
36,17," See Testimony of Perrotta at 123, JA 498 (""As a matter of fact, one of the interesting things about the work stoppage . . . was 
that there were some people, fringe people, in terms of competence and skill who were against it for precisely that reason, that 
they felt that there would be more competition and that they would end up getting fewer cases."")"
36,18," Testimony of Perrotta at 677, JA 161 (100-120 lawyers call in for cases daily whereas 40-60 did so before rates were 
increased; lawyers get fewer cases ""whether they like it or not""). "
37,19," Petitioners put into the record a letter from the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to the Speaker 
of the House (April 7, 1983) urging, on behalf of the Judicial Conference of the United States, passage of legislation increasing 
the per case maximum and authorizing the Conference to adjust the hourly rate for work done under the federal version of the 
CJA, and observing ""increasing concern at all levels of the Federal Judiciary that further delay . . . may significantly erode the 
quality of legal services which the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution mandates."" Resp. Exh. 40, JA 672. "
38,20," The Commission takes the position that the boycott would not be justified even if ""denial of Sixth Amendment rights was 
rampant"" since ""the remedy for such an evil would still lie with the three branches of government, not with a suppliers' cartel."" 
FTC Brief at 35-36 n.35 (citing Fashion Originators' Guild, Inc. v. FTC, 312 U.S. 457, 467-68, 85 L. Ed. 949, 61 S. Ct. 703 
(1941))."
38,21," The Commission specifically found that the quality of representation before the boycott was ""adequate under Sixth 
Amendment standards."" See 107 F.T.C. at 587. In support of this finding, it cited to the decision of the ALJ at I.D.F. 25, but the 
ALJ there concluded only that ""on the basis of this record, no definitive finding can be made about the performance of CJA 
lawyers in handling their caseloads except to observe that collectively they move a large volume of cases through the District's 
criminal justice system""; that they are of uneven quality and have diverse motivations for doing CJA work; and that ""the CJA 
corps still has its fair share of courthouse 'hangers-on' who take as many cases as possible (usually misdemeanors) in the 
expectation that without investigation, preparation, or concern for the particular needs of their clients, their cases will plead out, 
and hassles with Bar Council over charges of ineffective representation will be avoided as a living is scratched out collecting 
CJA fees."" Nor can the low rate of reversals of criminal convictions on Sixth Amendment grounds, upon which the FTC drew, provide 
substantial support for the Commission's finding. HN8[
] A conviction may be affirmed despite the substandard performance of 
counsel unless the court determines that this performance ""so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that 
the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result."" See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 686, 80 L. Ed. 2d 
674, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). Advising a client to accept the offer of a bargained plea will occasion even less rigorous judicial 
second-guessing when the defendant later seeks a writ of habeas corpus, claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. It does not 
follow, apodictically, therefore, that ""if the city's fees for CJA lawyers had been inadequate to elicit competent counsel for 
indigents, a history of reversals of criminal convictions on Sixth Amendment grounds would have signalled that inadequacy."" 107 
F.T.C. at 587. "
39,22," The result in Noerr was extended in United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 669-71, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626, 85 S. Ct. 
1585 (1965), to anticompetitively motivated efforts to influence administrative action. "
40,23," Indeed, lower courts have declined to interpret Noerr in the fashion suggested by petitioners. Thus, Noerr immunity has been 
denied to lobbying efforts that use undesirable methods without regard to whether the participants' desire to influence the 
government was ""genuine."" See Sacramento Coca-Cola Bottling Co. v. Chauffeurs, Teamsters & Helpers Local No. 150, 440 
F.2d 1096, 1099 (9th Cir. 1971) (Noerr and Pennington do not apply to ""threats, intimidation and other coercive measures""); 
Westborough Mall v. City of Cape Girardeau, 693 F.2d 733, 746 (8th Cir. 1982) (Noerr does not apply to lobbying efforts 
accompanied by illegal or fraudulent actions); see also Woods Exploration & Producing Co. v. Aluminum Co. of America, 
438 F.2d 1286, 1296-98 (5th Cir. 1971) (Noerr does not protect a conspiracy to supply false information to a government 
agency). A small number of cases have considered whether Noerr protects boycotts by competitors aimed at influencing governmental 
action. The majority of these decisions have concluded that it does not. See United States v. North Dakota Hospital Ass'n, 640 
F. Supp. 1028, 1040-43 (D.N.D. 1986) (agreement by competing hospitals to deny the Indian Health Service a contractual price 
discount); COMPACT v. Metropolitan Government, 594 F. Supp. 1567, 1572-73 (M.D. Tenn. 1984) (agreement among black 
architectural firms to negotiate jointly on public projects); Osborn v. Pennsylvania-Delaware Service Station Dealers Ass'n, 497 
F. Supp. 553, 555, 557-58 (D.Del. 1980) (agreement among gasoline dealers to cease all sales to customers until maximum 
retail price of gasoline is increased); In re Michigan State Medical Soc., 101 F.T.C. 191, 296-301 (1983) (agreement among 
competing doctors to increase state Medicaid reimbursement rates by threatening collective departicipation). But see Crown 
Central Petroleum Corp. v. Waldman, 486 F. Supp. 759 (M.D. Pa. 1980) (boycott by gasoline retailers aimed at increasing 
maximum retail prices was exempt from the antitrust laws under Noerr). See also Missouri v. National Organization for Women, 
Inc., 620 F.2d 1301 (8th Cir. 1980) (Sherman Act is not applicable to a convention boycott by the National Organization for 
Women against all states that had not ratified the Equal Rights Amendment)."
40,24," Allied Tube, the nation's largest producer of steel conduit for electrical wires, conspired with other interested parties to exclude 
the plastic conduit manufactured by its competitor, Indian Head, from the electrical conduit market. To this end, Allied Tube 
""packed"" the 1980 annual meeting of the National Fire Protection Association with 155 new members whose only function was 
to vote against a proposal to include plastic conduit as an approved type of electrical conduit in the Association's 1981 National 
Electric Code. The plan was successful and Indian Head's product was excluded entirely in a substantial number of jurisdictions 
that adopted the National Electric Code directly into law. Recovery was based on the sales that Indian Head lost where its 
product could lawfully be used but was not used because of the stigma of not obtaining Code approval. "
41,25," Allied Tube suggests that for Noerr to apply, the restraint must also be ""incidental"" to the effort to influence governmental 
action. This requirement is aimed at situations, as in both Noerr and Allied Tube, where efforts to influence the government 
cause ""direct"" harm to competitors in the marketplace in addition to any harm resulting from governmental action. See supra at 
38, 41 n.24. In such cases, the court must ensure that the defendants' efforts to influence legislative action are not a ""mere 
sham"" to cover what is actually an attempt to interfere directly with a competitor's business relationships. In this case, however, 
the boycott was aimed solely at the government as a purchaser of goods and services, and there is no allegation that the boycott 
caused the District any marketplace harm that is distinguishable from the harm caused by petitioners' efforts to induce the 
District government to raise their compensation. It therefore makes little sense to ask whether the boycott is ""incidental"" to the 
defendant's efforts to influence the government. Instead, the relevant question is simply whether it is a ""valid"" effort to influence 
government action."
41,26," The possibility that boycotts organized for ""political"" purposes may be expressive conduct protected from regulation under the 
Sherman Act has generated intense interest among commentators. The relevant literature includes Hurwitz, Abuse of 
Governmental Processes, the First Amendment and the Boundaries of Noerr, 74 Geo. L.J. 65, 111-16 (1985); Kennedy, Political 
Boycotts, the Sherman Act, and the First Amendment, 55 S. Cal. L. Rev. 983 (1982); Note, A Market Power Test for Non-
Commercial Boycotts, 93 Yale L.J. 523 (1984); Note, NOW or Never: Is There Antitrust Liability for Noncommercial Boycotts?, 
80 Colum. L. Rev. 1317 (1980); Comment, Protest Boycotts Under the Sherman Act, 128 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1131 (1980); Note, 
Political Boycott Activity and the First Amendment, 91 Harv. L. Rev. 659 (1978); see also Bird, Sherman Act Limitations on 
Noncommercial Concerted Refusals to Deal, 1970 Duke L.J. 247; Coons, Non-Commercial Purpose as a Sherman Act Defense, 
56 Nw. U.L. Rev. 705 (1962). "
42,27," In considering the impact of Claiborne Hardware on the petitioners' Noerr defense, we note, as a preliminary matter, that while 
Claiborne Hardware involved the state law tort of malicious interference with a business, nothing in the Court's opinion suggests 
that it would apply any different analysis to conduct that allegedly violates the federal antitrust laws. To the contrary, Claiborne 
Hardware's discussion of Noerr suggests that the Court believed its analysis would be equally applicable in Sherman Act 
context."
42,28," It is clear that not even politically motivated boycotts enjoy First Amendment protection against sanctions under all 
circumstances. In International Longshoremen's Ass'n v. Allied Inter., Inc., 456 U.S. 212, 72 L. Ed. 2d 21, 102 S. Ct. 1656 (1982) 
(ILA), a case decided less than three months before Claiborne Hardware, the Court rejected, in a brief paragraph, the claim that 
a politically motivated secondary boycott by a labor union was entitled to First Amendment protection. Longshoremen had 
refused to handle cargoes arriving from or destined for the Soviet Union in order to protest the invasion of Afghanistan. The 
Court stated it has consistently rejected the claim that secondary picketing by labor unions in violation of § 8 (b) (4) [of the National Labor 
Relations Act] is protected activity under the First Amendment. (Citations omitted.) It would seem even clearer that conduct 
designed not to communicate but to coerce merits still less consideration under the First Amendment. "
42,456," U.S. at 226. The Court also noted that ""there are many ways in which a union and its individual members may express their 
opposition to Russian foreign policy without infringing upon the rights of others."" Id. at 227. "
43,," In Claiborne Hardware the Court referred to ILA for the proposition that economic regulation in furtherance of an important or 
substantial government interest is not unconstitutional merely because it has an incidental effect on First Amendment freedoms. 
See 458 U.S. at 912."
43,29," In fact, most commentators who have discussed an exemption from the Sherman Act for ""non-commercial"" or ""political"" 
boycotts have excluded from the scope of their analysis all boycotts organized by business competitors aimed at increasing their 
own profits. See Note, NOW or Never: Is there Antitrust Liability for Noncommercial Boycotts?, 80 Colum. L. Rev. 1317, 1319 & 
n.16 (1980); Comment, Protest Boycotts Under the Sherman Act, 128 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1131, 1133 (1980); Note, Political Boycott 
Activity and the First Amendment, 91 Harv. L. Rev. 659, 660 (1978); see also Kennedy, Political Boycotts, The Sherman Act, 
and the First Amendment, 55 S. Cal. L. Rev. 983, 990 (1982) (""One important factor in properly characterizing a particular 
mixed-motive boycott is the presence or absence of economic gain flowing to the boycotters.""). "
44,30," Even this goal, which could be characterized as ""economic"" when viewed in isolation, is more appropriately viewed as part of a 
comprehensive effort to achieve racial equality in the public life of Claiborne County. By contrast, as noted above, SCTLA's 
demand for increased CJA fees was not part of a larger effort to focus attention on the quality of representation provided to 
indigent defendants or on the criminal justice system in the District of Columbia."
44,31," See U.S. Bureau of the Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States: 1988 at 410 (108th ed. 1987). "
45,32," The Commission did not address this question because it found that the policies underlying the federal antitrust laws (including 
the per se condemnation of price fixing boycotts) justified any incidental restriction on the petitioners' First Amendment 
freedoms. See 107 F.T.C. at 594-95. "
47,33," Both the magnitude of the price increase considered and the length of time allowed for new entry may vary depending on the 
reason the market is being defined. In the context of mergers, for example, the Department of Justice generally defines markets 
by examining the effect of a five percent price increase lasting one year. See U.S. Department of Justice, Merger Guidelines §§ 
2.11, 2.2 (1984)."
47,34," Contrary to SCTLA's suggestion, the record admits of starkly contrasting inferences. We note, for example, that the CJA 
attorneys received a rate increase of 75% for out-of-court time and of 17 % for in-court time, substantially above the 5 % 
increase generally used by the Department of Justice in defining markets under the merger guidelines. See supra n.33. In 
addition, the assumption that production substitution serves as a check on market power may be problematic when the price is 
set through legislation. As petitioners have repeatedly noted, legislatively determined prices tend to be ""sticky"" so that an 
increase in supply caused by a rise in price is unlikely to restore the market to the competitive equilibrium, i.e., to a lower price. 
Thus, post-increase entry may only reflect the availability of supra-competitive returns for new entrants, resulting in rationing of 
cases to lawyers. "
48,35," The record demonstrates that Mayor Barry and other important city officials were sympathetic to the boycotters' goals and may 
even have been supportive of the boycott itself. See I.D.F. 37, 38, 43, 45, 50, 63; 107 F.T.C. at 560. At a meeting on August 29, 
1983, for example, Mayor Barry, who was aware of the September 6 strike deadline, explained the District's emergency 
legislative process to SCTLA representatives and told them ""you do what you have to do, and I will do what I have to do."" See 
I.D.F. 50. Indeed, the ALJ concluded that ""the Mayor . . . believed that an increase was fully merited but could not be brought 
about unless the city was confronted with an actual emergency demonstrating the importance of the CJA lawyers to the 
administration of the criminal justice system."" 107 F.T.C. at 559. We agree with the Commission that the Mayor's ""knowing wink"" 
cannot confer immunity on the petitioners if they did, in fact, have market power that they exercised to the detriment of the city. 
See Socony Vacuum Oil, 310 U.S. at 226. Nonetheless, the mayor's remarks could also be interpreted as encouraging the 
petitioners to stage a demonstration of their political muscle so that a rate increase could more easily be justified to the public. 
Such a demonstration would not offend the antitrust laws if the petitioners actually lacked the ability to exert any significant 
economic pressure on the city. "
50,1," It is true that the Claiborne Hardware Court described the boycotters as seeking ""to effectuate rights guaranteed by the 
Constitution itself,"" 458 U.S. at 914, and juxtaposed that objection against only the right of the states to regulate economic 
activity. This might suggest that the Court would give greater deference to federal regulation in drawing the appropriate balance 
with the First Amendment. Nevertheless, Claiborne Hardware does not appear to me to be limited to boycotts that protest 
unconstitutional practices. "
56,1," The Honorable John L. McCraw, Justice, participated in the submission of this case and in subsequent deliberations. However, 
he was no longer a member of the Court at the time of the opinion and judgment herein. The remaining members of the 
submission panel being in agreement, this opinion is delivered by them as the decision of the Court. "
57,2," He died during the trial, and his deposition was read in evidence. "
58,3," Vendor's machines already had been on location at both of these clubs for a considerable period. Also, MJR had been 
operating both premises for a substantial time. The leases executed on this date apparently renewed or memorialized a pre-
existing arrangement."
58,4," The date and circumstances whereby these new leases came into existence lie exclusively in the testimony of the individual 
defendants. They bore no acknowledgements; no others testified concerning their execution. The parties continued to utilize Old 
Vendor's machines already in place on both premises. The existence of these new leases was not made known until during the 
trial."
58,5, Defendants Woodruff and Murphy even borrowed money from Vendor in order to remodel one of the clubs.
58,6," For the period of weeks from the February 1984 exclusion date to the time of trial, interest was accrued instead of applied as a 
discount. "
59,7," In view of the fact that the case must be remanded for re-trial, we omit discussion of most of the contentions concerning the 
alleged factual insufficiency of the evidence. We expressly do not reach Furrh's points 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 
30 and 32 and MJR's points 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 20, 22, 24, 26, 30 and 32."
59,8," Furrh points 3, 15, 17, 21, and 31; MJR points 4, 6, 8, 10, 21, 23, 25, and 33. "
60,9," By its finding of fact no. 1, the trial court held that Vendor ""had the contractual right to exclusive placement of coin-operated . . . 
machines for terms of years at the ten clubs listing them by name."" Finding no. 10 held that MJR ""breached its contracts"" in 
allowing machines to be removed. By conclusion of law no. 22, the court again found that MJR ""breached its contracts"" in 
allowing machines to be removed. The court omitted to specifically address the situation with respect to Geno's or to expressly 
find that Vendor was a third-party beneficiary of any particular contract. "
62,10," On the same analysis, we again reject Vendor's donee-beneficiary contentions; the record is bereft of any evidence of clear 
intent, as required in order to sustain a third-party beneficiary claim, that Furrh desired to bestow upon Vendor the substantial 
gratuity of fifteen years of exclusive machine placement rights. "
64,11," Accord with respect to third-party liability concerning public construction contract, see Knox v. Ball, 144 Tex. 402, 191 S.W.2d 
17 (1946). "
65,12," James Stewart & Co. v. Law, 149 Tex. 392, 233 S.W.2d 558 (1950) (general contractor, in construction contract, agreed to 
purchase liability insurance and require that all subcontractors do so -- subcontractor, having failed to insure, injured plaintiff; 
held, suit may be maintained against general contractor on third-party beneficiary theory). ""If it be assumed that the motive of . . . 
[owner] was only the selfish one to protect itself . . ., it does not follow that it did not intend to benefit third parties."" Id. at 561 
(emphasis added). We view the case as an anomaly, applicable, out of humanitarian and public policy considerations, only to 
situations where construction contractors agree to purchase personal injury liability insurance."
65,13," The cases discussed above support the proposition that we must adopt a construction which does not create a third-party 
beneficiary liability, if we can reasonably do so. Even further, adopting the third-party beneficiary claim would do little to relieve 
the problem of construction. As pointed out, we are still troubled by the inability to find any debt or other obligation that bargain-
seeker Furrh was seeking to discharge or protect; we are further troubled by the inability to clearly define the obligations incurred 
by bargain-giver MJR. "
66,14," Defendants argue that Vendor abandoned any legally enforceable right that it possessed to require MJR to sign a standard 
location agreement through inaction. See Hancock v. Bradshaw, 350 S.W.2d 955 (Tex. Civ. App. -- Amarillo 1961, no writ). It 
further argues that the primary contract parties may revoke a third-party beneficiary agreement before it is acted upon.  See Rau 
v. Modern Sales & Service Inc., 414 S.W.2d 203 (Tex. Civ. App. -- San Antonio 1967, writ ref'd n.r.e.). Vendor counters that the 
primary contract parties may not act in a manner that will defraud the beneficiary. See Pacific American Gasoline Co. v. Miller, 
76 S.W.2d 833, 845 (Tex. App. -- Amarillo 1934, writ ref'd). Vendor has again confused reprehensibility with unlawful conduct. 
Inasmuch as Vendor had not accepted the hypothetical contract commitment to execute a location agreement form, the primary 
contract parties were free to revoke the beneficiary's grant. The fact that defendants surreptitiously organized a competitor 
company before proceeding may have been offensive and unfair, but the test is unlawfulness, not unfairness. Inasmuch as we 
have rejected the interpretation that the contract provision was a promise by MJR to execute a location agreement, we need not 
further explore these matters. "
67,15," Vendor's position is that the life of the machine location agreement was not left to conjecture; it was co-terminous with the 
fifteen year life of the grant, but the argument proves too much. Why would these club owners and operators, being in a 
particularly favorable bargaining position with respect to Geno's, be willing to commit themselves to a fifteen-year contract 
whereas they had not usually previously committed for more than five years at locations producing only a quarter or a third as 
much revenue? "
71,16," We are not to be construed as holding that defendants did not induce the breach of the machine-location agreements between 
Circle W, Inc. and Vendor. Neither do we hold that Vendor may not recover damages with respect to such agreements. What we 
do hold is that the judgment before us cannot be upheld upon any such theory; Vendor neither pleaded nor presented evidence 
in support of any claim against defendants for inducing breach of the Circle W location agreements."
71,17," Furrh, points 25 through 28; MJR, points 16 through 19."
71,18, TEX. REV. CIV. STAT. arts. 8801-8817 (Vernon Supp. 1986).
71,19," Defendants only attack the location agreements relating to four clubs on restraint of trade grounds: Babe's, Cuddles, Fantasy 
Island, and Showtime. Presumably, they so limit their attack because the evidence only shows these four machine-location 
agreements to have been extracted from defendant MJR as an express condition imposed by Vendor upon the making of a loan. 
Although the evidence indicated that defendant uniformly required the execution of location agreements in connection with the 
making of a loan, defendants presented no evidence that any other location agreement was executed as part of the price of 
obtaining a specific loan. Obviously, one situation does not necessarily follow the other; merely showing the execution of a 
location agreement does not prove that any loan whatever was involved. "

appellee has in his answer brief conceded that there was no section one violation of the Sherman Act and argues that all the jury

focus on whether the requisite requirements of a section 2 conspiracy to monopolize case were met. "

129,2," WIPCO's ""sole function is to supply electricity to its member cooperative systems at wholesale. . . . It is owned by seven 
electric distribution cooperatives, and its board of directors is comprised of representatives of these corporations."" Western 
Illinois Power Coop., Inc. v. Property Tax Appeal Board, 29 Ill. App. 3d 16, 331 N.E.2d 286, 288 (1975). Apparently, in the late 
1970's, WIPCO and another cooperative negotiated with the Illinois Power Company to acquire an ownership interest in the new 
Clinton Nuclear Power Plant. ""The REA has urged participation by federated cooperatives [such as WIPCO] in agreements 
involving the joint ownership and operation of large-scale generation facilities,"" especially nuclear power plants.  Greensboro 
Lumber Co. v. Georgia Power Co., 643 F. Supp. 1345, 1360-61 (N.D. Ga. 1986), aff'd, 844 F.2d 1538 (11th Cir. 1988). As a part 
owner of Clinton, WIPCO was responsible for part of the financing of the plant, which experienced substantial cost overruns 
during construction. Although the record on appeal contains no information about WIPCO's costs and their effect on RECC's 
rates, the rates WIPCO charges RECC and its other member cooperatives may have risen commensurately with its increased 
financial obligation to the Clinton project. See Fuchs, 672 F. Supp. at 1112 n.2. This may be the root cause of plaintiffs' 
complaints about their rates. See infra note 8."

130,6," Defendants do not concede a per se violation, contending that the contract must be evaluated under the rule of reason. 
Because we find that defendants' challenged action was state action not subject to the federal antitrust laws, we do not address 
the issue of whether the service area agreement on its face violated the antitrust laws. The challenged restraint must be 
considered an act of the state pursuant to state law, and the ESA is therefore not preempted by the federal antitrust laws. See 
324 Liquor Corp. v. Duffy, 479 U.S. 335, 107 S. Ct. 720, 726 n.8, 93 L. Ed. 2d 667 (1987); Rice v. Norman Williams Co., 458

(Parker and Rice mandate essentially the same preemption inquiry)."
130,7," Commissioner Bushnell points out in her brief that even in the absence of the agreement, the ESA freezes service areas. CIPS 
would need a certificate of public convenience and necessity under PUA § 8-406 in order to extend service to RECC's current 
customers. Although the primary factor in the issuance of such a certificate is cost savings to customers, PUA § 8-406(d), the 
existence of a similar service (RECC) in the area might preclude issuance of the certificate."
130,8," This dispute is apparently but one variation of the periodic conflicts occurring between co-op customers and their electricity 
suppliers. When Congress enacted the REA in 1936, ninety percent of rural residents were without electric power. The REA 
(along with the National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation, which provides additional financing to supplement the 
REA's loan and loan guarantee program) provided the loan capital for the construction of facilities, the extension of lines, and the 
generation and transmission of power in sparsely populated areas ""which the investor-owned utilities had not found it profitable 
to service."" Salt River, 391 F.2d at 473. Total cumulative government financing of rural electrification approaches $ 50 billion. 
The co-ops pay for these loans through their member/consumers' electric rates. Now that the rural electric systems are almost 
universally in place, but not paid for, some co-op customers are disgruntled with their rates, which necessarily reflect the 
amortization cost of the system. Consequently, distribution co-ops have tried to sell their assets to neighboring investor-owned utilities, Tri-State Generation and 
Transmission Assoc., Inc. v. Shoshone River Power, Inc., 805 F.2d 351 (10th Cir. 1986), or to void their long-term contracts with 
co-op suppliers whose rates are higher than neighboring utilities.  United States v. Southwestern Electric Coop., 663 F. Supp. 
538 (S.D. Ill. 1987). The withdrawal of any distribution co-op from the system necessarily shifts the fixed costs of the electricity 
(represented by the debt service) to the other members of its generation and transmission cooperative and raises the possibility 
of default, with potentially disastrous results for the system. See Tri-State, 805 F.2d at 357. It is clear that somebody will have to 
retire the debt of the rural electrification system; if co-op customers like plaintiffs succeed in removing themselves from the REA 
structure in large enough numbers to precipitate default, the costs may eventually be shifted to federal taxpayers. "
131,9," HN1[
] By ""antitrust laws"" we mean the federal antitrust laws referred to in § 1 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 12."
131,10," Plaintiffs argue that Congress would have explicitly excluded electric cooperatives from the antitrust laws, as it did agricultural 
(15 U.S.C. § 17; 7 U.S.C. §§ 291-92) and fishery (15 U.S.C. §§ 521-22) cooperatives, had it intended them to be exempt. The 
crucial question for state action analysis, however, is whether the state intends to and does act in its sovereign capacity. The 
Supreme Court has held that Congress did not attempt to intrude on state regulatory behavior."

147,1," Defendant Corinne Kehoe (""Kehoe"") is separately represented and has filed her own Rule 56 motion and supporting 
memoranda. All other defendants have proceeded jointly and have included a request for sanctions under Rule 11 as part of 
their supporting memoranda (Kehoe has not made such a request). This opinion addresses the Rule 11 issue briefly after 
discussing the merits under Rule 56."
147,2," Familiar HN1[
] Rule 56 principles impose on the movant the burden of establishing the lack of a genuine issue of material fact ( Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265, 106 S. Ct. 2548 (1986)). For that purpose this Court 
draws all ""reasonable inferences, not every conceivable inference"" in the light most favorable to the nonmovant -- in this case 
Martin ( DeValk Lincoln Mercury, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 811 F.2d 326, 329 (7th Cir. 1987)). "
148,3," This District Court's General Rule 12(e) requires a party moving for summary judgment to submit a statement of material facts 
as to which there are no genuine issues. General Rule 12(f) then requires the nonmovant to respond by admitting or 
controverting each paragraph of the movant's statement. Here all defendants except Kehoe have submitted a joint statement 
(""D. Jt. 12(e)""). Citations to that statement in this opinion are to paragraphs admitted by Martin's response. "
149,4," Martin's suspension ultimately lasted about 60 days (D. Jt. 12(e) para. 47). Martin Mem. 14 lays out in some detail what he 
contends are defects in the procedures employed in the hearing process. Because such claimed irregularities are irrelevant to 
the Sherman Act cause of action, they are omitted entirely from this opinion ( Northwest Wholesale Stationers, Inc. v. Pacific 
Stationery & Printing Co., 472 U.S. 284, 293, 86 L. Ed. 2d 202, 105 S. Ct. 2613 (1985) (""the absence of procedural safeguards 
can in no sense determine the antitrust analysis"")). "

Northwest Stationers) a per se approach to a boat trailer manufacturers' association's dealings with boat trailer lamp 
manufacturers. "
151,7," For other cases rejecting per se treatment, see, e.g., Cha-Car, Inc.  v. Calder Race Course, Inc., 752 F.2d 609, 613-14 (11th 
Cir. 1985); Deesen v. Professional Golfers' Ass'n of America, 358 F.2d 165, 170-71 (9th Cir. 1966)."
151,8," Martin's Mem. 26-27 cites Northwest Stationers for the proposition that American satisfies a ""market power test,"" therefore 
bringing per se treatment into play. That is just a misreading of Northwest Stationers (especially in light of the NCAA opinion). "
152,9," It is certainly questionable whether Panno's decision was actually caused by Martin's suspension. Panno testified (Dep. 17-18) 
she had wanted to work in Italy since December 1985, well before the suspension. Only 20 years old even now, Panno is 
presently enrolled in college and living in Massachusetts. However, this opinion views the evidence in the light most favorable to 
Martin (see n.2)."
152,10," [Footnote by this Court] Car Carriers II spoke of what a ""plaintiff must allege"" because it dealt with pleading requirements in 
the context of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. Of course the ingredients of what a plaintiff must prove -- in the sense of at least creating 
an issue of material fact for Rule 56 purposes -- are identical."
152,11," [Footnote by this Court] See also Havoco of America, Ltd. v. Shell Oil Co., 626 F.2d 549, 558 (7th Cir. 1980) (""a loss by the 
plaintiff of a single contract with a single purchaser is simply not equivalent to a deleterious effect on the market""). "
153,12," [Footnote by this Court] Industrial Gas held a terminated employee who refused to participate in alleged price fixing schemes 
suffered no ""antitrust injury"" because he was not a ""target"" of the alleged conspiracy. Moreover, the employee was also ruled not 
a proper party because his injury was too remote from the alleged illegal conduct ( id. 519-20). That same analysis applies with 
equal force to Martin, providing still another ground for dismissing his claim. On the issue of remoteness, see generally Areeda 
and Turner, Antitrust Law II § 340e, at 217 (1978): "
154,," [A] non-competitor is usually denied standing to complain that he was injured by selling less to one who was injured by the 
defendant's alleged antitrust violation. In this category are those who supplied employment services. . . ."
154,13," Perhaps the most famous formulation of the rule of reason is Justice Brandeis' in Board of Trade, 246 U.S. at 238: The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes 
competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition. To determine that question the court must 
ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and after the 
restraint was imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable. The history of the restraint, the evil 
believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, are all relevant 
facts. This is not because a good intention will save an otherwise objectionable regulation or the reverse; but because 
knowledge of intent may help the court to interpret facts and to predict consequences."
154,14," Martin argues the alleged lack of procedural due process afforded him bears on the Section 1 claim. Not so (see n.4). At best 
Martin could contend such facts, if proved, evidence anticompetitive motive or intent.  But because he proffers no affirmative 
evidence suggesting such animus or motivation, this Court will draw no such inference. "
155,15," This Court has frequently pointed out (though for a very different reason) that summary judgment is a substitute for trial -- or 
more accurately a demonstration that no trial is needed because no material factual issues require resolution (see, e.g., 
Teamsters Local 282 Pension Trust Fund v. Angelos, 649 F. Supp. 1242, 1252 (N.D. Ill. 1986))."
155,16," This opinion had already been completed when this Court received, as part of its weekly package of slip opinions from our 
Court of Appeals, the September 12, 1988 opinion in Zepik v. Tidewater Midwest, Inc., 856 F.2d 936 (7th Cir. 1988). There the 
court, after upholding a summary judgment on the single federal-question claim, remanded the variety of pendent claims for 
consideration of a potential UMW v. Gibbs dismissal (slip op. at 16-19), rather than upholding the District Court's summary 
judgment disposition of those claims on the merits. Although this Court (as the text reflects) applies a UMW v. Gibbs analysis as 
a matter of course in such situations, Zepik does not appear to recognize the meaningful difference that frequently exists 
between (say) a dismissal of federal claims under Rule 12(b)(6) (failure to state a claim) or Rule 12(c) (judgment on the 
pleadings) on the one hand and under Rule 56 (summary judgment) on the other. Although each of those involves a dismissal 
""before trial"" ( UMW v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. at 726) in literal terms, the only reason that is an accurate description of a Rule 56 
dismissal is that there will never be a ""trial"" -- an in-court proceeding with live witnesses -- in any event. But if the trial court 
already knows everything that would be known at such a trial, and if the only reason that no trial will be held is that no triable 
factual issues require one, it would seem that what UMW v. Gibbs, id. says should ""certainly"" happen -- dismissal of the state 
claims -- should not be taken literally (it is worth noting the UMW v. Gibbs statement was a classic example of dictum, for the 
case there had involved a disposition of the pendent state claim in (not before) a full-blown trial, and the Court upheld the District 
Court's having dealt with that claim on the merits (383 U.S. at 729)). At a minimum it would appear that applying a ""strong 
presumption"" in favor of state-claim dismissal in the summary-judgment full-record context ( Baltimore Orioles, Inc. v. Major 
League Baseball Players' Association, 805 F.2d 663, 682 (7th Cir. 1986), relied on in Zepik, slip op. at 17) overstates the case 
substantially. If anything, the presumption in that kind of situation probably ought to go the other way.  As the ensuing text 
discussion -- written before Zepik -- reflects, however, presumptions (really tie-breaking rules) play no part in this case. Several 
reasons counsel leaving Martin's state claims to a state court -- that is, if he chooses to refile them at all, rather than retiring to 
lick his wounds. "
156,17," By limiting the inquiry to the antitrust claim, this order expects Martin's counsel to clear away the really irrelevant factual 
underbrush that clutters up Martin Mem. 35-36, addressing instead the matters that bear upon the reasonably understood facial 
viability of the federal claim when Martin brought it."
156,18," Among the matters to be considered will be the appropriate disposition of the Rule 11 claim to the extent defendants' counsel 
have extended time and incurred expense on the Count II and III claims. "

178,3," One commentator has observed that the interstate commerce issue is essentially a nonissue in most Sherman Act cases: Once one focuses on the inherent effects of a trade restraint in a national economy together with the long-held rule that the

187,1," Local Rule 6.01 (E.D. Wis.) provides that principal briefs shall not exceed 30 pages, exclusive of pages containing statements 
of facts, exhibits, and affidavits. Plaintiff's brief in support of the summary judgment motion exceeded this limitation by 10 pages, 
while the brief in response to defendants' motion exceeded this limitation by 26 pages. Plaintiff did seek leave to file the 
oversized briefs, but those motions were made contemporaneously with the filing. In the recent case of Fleming v. County of 
Kane, No. 88-2385, Slip Op. (August 26, 1988), the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit discussed in some 
detail the exceptional nature of leave to file oversized briefs on the appellate level. The court noted that the limitation is 
necessary not merely to regulate the Court's workload, but also to encourage litigants to hone their arguments and eliminate 
excessive verbiage. Slip Op. at 1-2. In the case at hand, this Court can understand plaintiff's need for excess pages in its initial 
filing. But the Court cannot find justification for the 26 additional pages (56 pages total) in response to defendants' motion—
especially since the brief to which plaintiff was responding contained only 30 pages of legal analysis. In order to encorage 
plaintiff's counsel to strive towards making legal arguments as succinctly as possible, the Court hereby SANCTIONS counsel

187,2, References are to the page of an individual's deposition. 
208,1," One commentator summarized the holding of Brunswick as follows: Even if the plaintiff can show an antitrust violation, courts should allow treble damages only for injuries reflecting a 
disruption of competition in the plaintiff's market. From this perspective, Brunswick was an easy case. The plaintiffs may 
well have shown a violation of § 7 -- the mere possibility that a large firm active in many markets will cut prices or use other 
monopolization tactics in a new market is enough to show a § 7 violation -- but they failed to show that their losses 
stemmed from the realization of this possibility. The defendant had merely kept afloat businesses that otherwise would 
have failed. It had not affected prices in any way. The ""lost profits"" the plaintiffs complained of were the result of the very 
situation that the antitrust laws are supposed to encourage -- free competition among as many firms as a market can 
support. "
209,,"  Note, ""Antitrust Standing, Antitrust Injury, and the Per Se Standard"", 93 Yale L.J. 1309, 1320 & n.58 (1984). "
210,2," The establishment of a per se rule against maximum vertical price fixing is more than merely a recognition that the 
anticompetitive effects of the practice outweigh the procompetitive effects. Dissent at 699 n.1. Rather, it is a recognition that 
""such [procompetitive] cases are not sufficiently common or important enough to justify the time and expense necessary to 
identify them."" Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 97 S. Ct. 2549, 2557 n.16, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568 (1977). 
Indeed, ""per se rules are appropriate only for conduct that is manifestly anticompetitive, that is conduct that would always or 
almost always tend to restrict competition and decrease output."" Business Elecs. Corp. v. Sharp Elecs. Corp., 485 U.S. 717, 108 
S. Ct. 1515, 1519, 99 L. Ed. 2d 808 (1988) (internal quotes and citations omitted). With this in mind, the dissent's flat assertion, based on Professor (now Judge) Easterbrook's neo-classical economic views, that 
""maximum vertical price fixing lacks the potential anticompetitive effects that maximum horizontal price fixing has, and in contrast 
has the potential for creating a competitive benefit"" is simply irrelevant. Dissent at 701 (citing Easterbrook, Maximum Price 
Fixing, 48 U. Chi. L. Rev. 886, 890 n.20 (1981)). To the extent that the Supreme Court's view of this issue differs from Judge 
Easterbrook's, we are required to apply the former. "
211,3," Recently, in Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Serv. Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775, 104 S. Ct. 1464 (1984), the Solicitor 
General and a number of other amici asked the Supreme Court to reconsider the inclusion of resale price maintenance within 
the per se rule. The Court declined to do so.  Id. at 761-62 n.7; see Business Elecs. Corp. v. Sharp Elecs. Corp., 485 U.S. 717, 
108 S. Ct. 1515, 1519, 99 L. Ed. 2d 808 (1988) (reaffirming the per se illegality of vertical price agreements). Although the dissent disclaims taking any position on whether maximum vertical price fixing should any longer be per se illegal, 
dissent at 9 n.5, it is almost impossible to read the opinion's lengthy discourse on the benefits of this practice as saying anything 
else. It claims that ARCO's competitors are not harmed by its conduct, and that its consumers will only benefit. Yet, as discussed 
in Part III of this opinion, the Supreme Court has established per se rules against certain conduct only ""for conduct that is 
manifestly anti-competitive, that is conduct that would always or almost always tend to restrict competition. . . ."" Business Elecs. 
Corp., 108 S. Ct. at 1519 (internal quotes and citations omitted). "
212,4," The dissent's contention that maximum vertical price fixing is ""less destructive than minimum price fixing because it generally 
results in lower prices to consumers,"" Dissent at 12725-26, is questionable at best, but in any event simply irrelevant. Both 
violations are classified as per se because the resulting harm to competition is extremely serious. Moreover, the Ninth Circuit 
case the dissent cites for its proposition, Northwest Publications Inc. v. Crumb, 752 F.2d 473, 475 (9th Cir. 1985), simply does 
not say what the dissent says it does. Although we did note that these restraints ""arguably benefit consumers,"" id. (emphasis 
added), we also enumerated some of the reasons, as we do above, why the Supreme Court still holds that ""maximum price-
fixing is as pernicious as minimum price-fixing."" Id. We discuss below our views of the other case the dissent cites, Jack Walters 
& Sons Corp. v. Morton Building, Inc., 737 F.2d 698 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1018, 83 L. Ed. 2d 359, 105 S. Ct. 432 
(1984)."
212,5," In essence, this is also the position the dissent takes. ""Maximum vertical price fixing is destructive when the prices set are 
predatory."" Dissent at 701 (citing Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 584, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. 
Ed. 2d 538). However, the Court in Matsushita did not comment on whether maximum vertical price maintenance is destructive 
in the absence of predatory pricing. That issue was simply not before the Court or considered by it. "
213,," The dissent's position would preclude a finding of a violation of the antitrust laws in the case of the vast majority of unlawful 
maximum resale price agreements -- i.e., those not accompanied by predatory conduct. No one, except an unenthusiastic 
Department of Justice and, under certain circumstances, the dealers who are parties to the resale price maintenance 
agreement, would have standing to bring suit to challenge conduct which undeniably is forbidden by the antitrust laws. This 
would virtually amount to a finding that Brunswick has, sub silentio, overruled Albrecht, Kiefer-Stewart, and Maricopa County, P. 
Areeda & H. Hovencamp, Antitrust Law para. 335.2(i), at 277 n.56 (1987 Supplement)."
213,6," For a single firm's pricing practices to violate the antitrust laws, that firm must be engaged in predatory pricing or discriminatory 
pricing (the Robinson Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 13(a)). However, much less need be shown to assert that the pricing practices of 
two or more firms have violated the antitrust laws: it need only be shown that those firms have conspired to fix prices. See 
generally H. Hovenkamp, Economics and Federal Antitrust Law 92-124, 159-61, 172-73, 258-65 (1985). Here, a price-fixing 
agreement between ARCO and its dealers is alleged."
213,7," There is another reason why Cargill is not dispositive. The law against monopoly involved in Cargill, section 7 of the Clayton 
Act, attempts to prevent market structures in which the competitive process is vulnerable to distortion. The distortion is only 
potential. In price-fixing cases, by contrast, the distortion of the price mechanism has, by definition, already occurred."
213,8," This characterization applies equally well to Alberta Gas Chemicals, Ltd. v. E.I. Du Pont De Nemours & Co., 826 F.2d 1235 
(3rd Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 56 U.S.L.W. 3849, 486 U.S. 1059, 108 S. Ct. 2830, 100 L. Ed. 2d 930 (1988). In Alberta Gas, 
plaintiff claimed that defendant's acquisition of a company caused the acquired company to cancel a project. Because the 
project was canceled, the acquired company bought less of plaintiff's product. The court found that the plaintiff had not shown 
antitrust injury. This, too, is an unsurprising finding: the connection between violation and injury is too attenuated for the plaintiff 
to claim, without more, that the injury involved is of the type the particular antitrust rule was meant to prevent. "
214,9," ARCO relies on Murphy Tugboat Co. v. Crowley, 658 F.2d 1256 (9th Cir. 1981), heavily, and the dissent does so equivocally, 
recognizing that the case is not controlling. In fact, Murphy Tugboat is wholly inapplicable. In Murphy Tugboat, one tugboat 
company complained of the low fees charged by another tugboat company for the services of its licenced inland pilots. These 
lower fees were the result of a labor agreement entered into between the inland pilots and one of the defendants. Because the 
plaintiff was not a competitor in the area covered by the labor agreement, the legality of that agreement was irrelevant to our 
principal inquiry. In any event, we ultimately held that the agreement was valid.  Id. at 1259. As a result, the plaintiff's claim 
depended entirely on whether the defendants' ""overall pricing policies constitute[d] anticompetitive conduct."" Id. at 1259. With 
the labor agreement, and thus the price-fixing allegation removed from the case, an antitrust violation could only be 
demonstrated by proof of a predatory pricing scheme. This is in stark contrast to the present case, in which the defendant's 
unlawful price-fixing is (for the purpose of the summary judgment motion) conceded and thus an antitrust violation is established 
without any need to show predatory pricing. As the dissent points out, we did state in Murphy Tugboat that ""[the antitrust laws] do not prohibit non-predatory conduct that 
results in a lower price to the consumer."" Dissent at 702. However, the dissent ignores the crucial fact that, in Murphy Tugboat, 
predatory pricing was a necessary element because, in the absence of such conduct, there was no violation of the antitrust laws. 
(It also fails to mention that Murphy Tugboat was not a maximum resale price case and did not purport to discuss the role of 
predatory conduct in such cases.) It was in connection with our discussion of whether a violation had occurred that we made the 
statement that the dissent now lifts wholly out of context -- the statement that the antitrust laws do not protect inefficient 
businessmen against others who establish lower prices but do not engage in predatory conduct. Here, however, we are not 
seeking to determine whether a violation of the antitrust laws occurred. For our purposes, there is a conceded violation of those 
laws; specifically, it is agreed that a violation occurred in the absence of predatory pricing. The only question here is whether 
there is a cognizable injury. In short, Murphy Tugboat deals solely with the issue of when a plaintiff who is not the defendant's competitor in the area in 
question may claim that an antitrust violation has occurred. The question of when a plaintiff who is a competitor can prove 
""antitrust injury"" is the basic issue in the present case. Indeed, it is worth noting that the Seventh Circuit did not consider Murphy 
Tugboat sufficiently on point to mention it when it considered the same question now before this court -- whether competitors 
have antitrust injury standing in maximum resale price cases.  Jack Walters & Sons Corp. v. Morton Building, Inc., 737 F.2d 698 
(7th Cir. 1984). "
215,10," See Flynn & Ponsoldt, supra, at 1126 n.4 (citation omitted): One of the more popular cliches is that the antitrust laws protect competition, not competitors. The cliche implicitly asserts 
that one can have competition without competitors, contains no definition of ""competition,"" and is frequently used to deny 
the congressionally defined goals of antitrust policy in favor of the narrow goals assumed by the neoclassical model."

216,13," As one commentator has noted: Even consumers would not be able to bring actions under the rule established in Judge Posner's opinion in Jack Walters & 
Sons Corp. v. Morton Building. . . . . . . I cannot escape the conclusion that Judge Posner -- growing impatient with Congress's or the Supreme Court's refusal 
to overrule Albrecht -- has decided to undertake that task on his own. Members of the Chicago School have visions, as do most of us, of the kinds of things that should obtain in a perfect world. 
The per se rule against resale price maintenance is definitely not among them. That fact justifies arguments, both 
theoretical and political. But it does not justify taking the matter into one's own hands, no matter how certain we may be that 
we are right.  Hovenkamp, ""Chicago and Its Alternatives"", 1986 Duke L.J. 1014, 1025-26 (footnote omitted)."
216,14," Cf. Flynn & Ponsoldt, supra, at 1149: HN11[
] [A conspiracy to fix prices] is a direct displacement of the competitive process of price determination. It is an 
assumption of power by the proponent of the restraint, denying rights of distributors and consumers to make their own 
judgments about pricing -- a denial of rights guaranteed by the goals of antitrust policy. Congress did not leave to the 
proponents of such restraints the authority to determine unilaterally the scope of the contract rights of distributors. Similarly, 
Congress did not intend the proponents of maximum price fixing to determine what the best price should be for the benefit 
of the public."
216,15," We recognize that our decision conflicts with that of the Seventh Circuit. In U.S. v. Larm, 824 F.2d 780, 784 (9th Cir. 1987), we 
said ""absent some good reason to do so, we are disinclined to create a direct conflict with another circuit."" We did not intend by 
that statement to surrender our authority to decide important issues of first impression or to suggest that we would adopt the 
view of the first circuit to consider such issues in every instance. Rather, we meant that we would give respectful attention to the 
views of the other circuit and carefully evaluate that circuit's analysis before settling on ours. Here we have done so and we find 
good reason to disagree with the result reached by Judge Posner. "
218,1," USA asserts that the per se rule conclusively presumes that maximum vertical price fixing is anticompetitive so it can never 
have any procompetitive consequences. On the contrary, the per se rule is a recognition that although price fixing agreements 
may have some procompetitive potential, the anticompetitive effects on balance outweigh the procompetitive aspects. See 
Continental T.V., Inc., 433 U.S. at 50 n.16. Antitrust injury analysis requires that the ""injury"" reflect the anticompetitive effect of 
the violation, not any procompetitive effects. See Brunswick, 429 U.S. at 488-89. For examples of antitrust violations without 
antitrust injury, see Local Beauty Supply, Inc. v. Lamaur, Inc., 787 F.2d 1197 (7th Cir. 1986); Page, The Scope of Liability for 
Antitrust Violations, 37 Stan. L. Rev. 1445, 1469-1470 (1985); 2 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law, PP. 345 & 346. "

Easterbrook argues that the per se rule should be abandoned in the maximum horizontal price fixing case. Id."
219,5," Because maximum vertical price fixing is viewed as having some procompetitive benefits and because its economic effect is 
not very different from nonprice vertical restraints, Continental T.V., Inc., 433 U.S. at 69 & n.10, many commentators have "

(9th Cir. 1988) (presenting, ""an abbreviated bibliography of this debate""). I also note that the Supreme Court was asked by the 
Solicitor General and other amici in Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775, 104 S. Ct. 1464 
(1984), to reconsider whether vertical price restrictions should always be unlawful. The Supreme Court declined to reach the 
question because it had not been presented in the district court nor raised on appeal.  465 U.S. at 761 n.7. Similarly, this 
argument was not raised in the case before us, and I express no opinion as to the merits of this argument."
220,6," I note that the Supreme Court in dictum in Business Electronic Corp., 108 S. Ct. at 1520 stated that ""vertical price restraints 
reduce interbrand price competition."" From the Court's citations it is clear that the Court was referring to minimum vertical price 
restraints. The Court cites Continental T.V., Inc., 433 U.S. at 51 n.18, which quotes Justice Brennan's concurring opinion in 
White Motor Co. v. United States, 372 U.S. 253, 268, 9 L. Ed. 2d 738, 83 S. Ct. 696 (1963) where he stated, ""resale price 
maintenance is not only designed to, but almost invariably does in fact, reduce price competition not only among sellers of the 
affected product, but quite as much between that product and competing brands."" Resale price maintenance has traditionally 
been used to refer to minimum vertical price fixing and was used by Justice Brennan in the context of a minimum vertical price 
fixing case. Similarly, the Court relies on Posner, Antitrust Policy and the Supreme Court: An Analysis of the Restricted 
Distribution, Horizontal Merger and Potential Competition Decisions, 75 Colum. L. Rev. 282, 294 (1975) in support of its 
comment. Again, Posner uses the term ""resale price maintenance"" to refer to minimum vertical price fixing. See id. at 292, n.36. 
Furthermore, Posner uses Justice White's quote to refer to the ""rule of Dr. Miles"" which was a minimum vertical price fixing case.  
Id. at 294. Posner criticizes the Court for not drawing a distinction between minimum and maximum vertical price fixing. Id. at 
297. "
221,7," Although USA alleged that it was ""forced"" to match ARCO's prices, it is difficult to see how ARCO with only 17% of the gasoline 
market during its most successful month ""forced"" USA to match ARCO's prices when most of the market had set prices above 
those required by ARCO. It would appear instead that USA voluntarily chose to match ARCO's reduced price to remain 
competitive."

320, 102 S. Ct. 1038 (1982) contains facts similar to the facts presented here. However, I do not find King & King Enterprises 
helpful because it did not discuss the antitrust injury requirement and it involved a horizontal conspiracy to fix maximum prices. "
222,9," USA has not alleged and no facts exist in the record to suggest that any maximum horizontal price fixing agreement was also in 
existence. Vertical price fixing agreements which also have a horizontal element cause concern because not only do they 
reduce or eliminate intrabrand competition, but they have the potential to eliminate or drastically reduce interbrand competition.

to sell their products, or (ii) pricing below some appropriate measure of cost."" Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 585 n.8. USA 
acknowledges that this standard is inapplicable to a conspiracy to engage in maximum vertical price fixing."

price and non-price vertical restraints. In ten out of the eleven cases he studied involving maximum vertical price fixing and no 
other restraints, only intrabrand competition was affected.  Id. at 166, table 1."

242,6," The fact that the discrete objectives of each of the predicate acts were all of the same basic type would not, of course, prevent

243,8," The civil RICO claimant need not, however, plead and prove a distinct ""racketeering injury."" Sedima, 473 U.S. at 495. "
244,9," As the district court noted, the great bulk of the allegations against the MSSIC defendants concern their allegedly negligent or 
grossly negligent failure to carry out their statutory duty to regulate the financial practices of MSSIC's member institutions. See 
Amended Complaint paragraphs 58-80."
244,10," The defendants correctly point out that while, as we have noted, it is not necessary to establish detrimental reliance by the 
victim in order to make out a violation of the federal mail fraud statute, see Armco Indus., 782 F.2d at 481-82, such reliance is 
necessary to establish injury to business or property ""by reason of"" a predicate act of mail fraud within the meaning of § 1964(c). "
245,11," We are aware of the Sedima Court's admonitions that RICO's civil remedy provisions are to be ""liberally construed"" and that 
Congress did not intend civil RICO claimants to be unduly hampered by the interrelated ""strict requirements [of] 'standing' to sue 
and 'proximate cause'"" appropriate in the related antitrust context.  Sedima, 473 U.S. at 498. But these admonitions obviously 
were not intended to read the traditional proximate cause concerns of tort law completely out of civil RICO, leaving only a cause-
in-fact requirement. They were made in the context of a rejection of the view that RICO injury, like antitrust injury, see Brunswick 
Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 489, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701, 97 S. Ct. 690 (1977), must be of a special type causally 
connected to the anti-competitive effects of the basically proscribed conduct rather than the normally compensable type of injury 
flowing from the basically proscribed conduct (predicate acts) itself. This rejection clearly relaxes the RICO proximate cause test 
from that applied in antitrust, by focussing inquiry on more direct cause and effect relationships than the necessarily more 
attenuated ones implied by the amorphous concepts of ""anti-competitive"" injury and violation. But it is plain that with the matter 
of RICO injury and RICO violation thus settled, the Sedima Court assumed that the normal proximate cause inquiry into their 
relationship would be appropriate. See id. at 497, n. 15. Our inquiry proceeds within those bounds. "
246,12," In light of this conclusion, we find it unnecessary to address the alternative argument, strenuously advanced before us by the 
six MSSIC member institutions that are joined as defendants, that they cannot be held liable in any event for the alleged 
misconduct of MSSIC's officers and directors. In terms of our analysis, it is plain that the causal connection between their 
conduct and the plaintiffs' injury is even more attenuated -- ""legal"" cause less evident -- than that of the MSSIC directors 
themselves."
246,13, We agree with the district court that the plaintiffs have stated a civil RICO claim against the First Maryland defendants.
246,14," As the Court explained: The State provides a unified method for the formation of policy and determination of cases by the Commission and by the 
state courts. The judicial review of the Commission's decisions in the state courts is expeditious and adequate. Conflicts in 
the interpretation of state law, dangerous to the success of state policies, are almost certain to result from the intervention 
of the lower federal courts. On the other hand, if the state procedure is followed from the Commission to the State Supreme 
Court, ultimate review of the federal questions is fully preserved here. "
246,319, U.S. at 333-34. 
247,15," There is no merit to the plaintiffs' contention that MDIF ""lacks standing"" to maintain this action because the receivership order 
has relieved it of the obligation to pay them interest. The plaintiffs' loss of interest on their deposits is derivative of the loss First 
Maryland itself suffered when the defendants misappropriated its assets, including some of the plaintiffs' deposits, preventing it 
from earning income on those assets. The fact that the receivership court has relieved the institution of its debt to the plaintiffs 
does not negate the fact that the institution itself suffered that loss of income. "
248,16," Federal courts have frequently invoked the Burford doctrine to avoid interference with ongoing state receivership proceedings. 
See, e.g., Law Enforcement Ins. Co. v. Corcoran, 807 F.2d 38 (2d Cir. 1986) (Burford abstention appropriate in contract action 
against insurance company which was in liquidation); Levy v. Lewis, 635 F.2d 960 (2d Cir. 1980) (Burford abstention appropriate 
in action brought against insurance company in liquidation by its former employees for wrongful termination of retirement 
benefits); Mathias v. Lennon, 474 F. Supp. 949 (S.D.N.Y. 1979) (Burford abstention appropriate in action by policyholders 
against insolvent insurance company); cf.  Pennsylvania v. Williams, 294 U.S. 176, 79 L. Ed. 841, 55 S. Ct. 380 (1935) (pre-
Burford case). Indeed, several district courts in this circuit, in addition to the court below, have already dismissed cases arising 
out of the Maryland savings and loan crisis on Burford abstention grounds. See American Casualty Co. v. Community Sav. & 
Loan, 635 F. Supp. 539 (D. Md. 1986); Northern Virginia Law School, Inc. v. Hughes, No. B-85-3200 (D. Md. Nov. 22, 1985); 
Tafflin v. Levitt, Nos. N-87-668/684 (D. Md. 1987)."
248,17," The plaintiffs also argue that the Burford doctrine is inapplicable for two additional reasons. First, they contend that Burford 
abstention is inappropriate because Maryland has not created a specialized state court to handle all claims arising out of the 
savings and loan crisis. This claim is refuted both by the facts of this case and by our decision in Browning-Ferris, Inc. v. 
Baltimore County, Md., 774 F.2d 77, 80 (4th Cir. 1985) (existence of a specialized state court with jurisdiction to decide only 
certain kinds of cases is not an absolute prerequisite to Burford abstention). Second, they argue that Burford abstention is 
inappropriate because they seek damages rather than injunctive relief. This argument has no merit. While the origins of the 
abstention doctrines may lie in the limitations of federal equity jurisdiction, it is now well-established that they apply to actions at 
law as well. See 17A C. Wright, A. Miller & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure: Jurisdiction § 4241, at 17-18. "
250,18," Since the object of Burford abstention is to avoid disruption of a comprehensive state regulatory apparatus, the proper course 
is to dismiss the action rather than simply staying it pending action by the state courts. See Burford, 319 U.S. at 334; 17A C. 
Wright, A. Miller & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure: Jurisdiction § 4245, at 101-102. This disposition in no way 
prejudices the plaintiffs' right to refile their federal claims in state court, should they so desire. "
258,1," For a more complete discussion of the factual background of these lawsuits, see the Court's January 4, 1988 Memorandum 
and Order at 3-6."
258,2," By order dated January 4, 1988, the Court dismissed all claims against Reuben Mattus, Rose Mattus and Kevin Hurley for lack 
of personal jurisdiction. "
259,3," As an initial matter, the Court notes that plaintiffs' allegations of a conspiracy between defendants and ""certain distributors and 
other entities not named as parties herein"" are too inspecific to survive a motion to dismiss. Lombard's, Inc. v. Prince Mfg., Inc., 
753 F.2d 974, 975 (11th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1082, 88 L. Ed. 2d 892, 106 S. Ct. 851 (1986) (HN3[
] failure to 
identify specific participants in alleged conspiracy is fatal to claim of conspiracy to restrain trade); see also Newport 
Components, Inc. v. NEC Home Electronics, Inc., 671 F. Supp. 1525, 1545 (C.D.Cal. 1987)."

265,5, Implicit in Count XIX and paragraph 28(F) is the presumption that the complained of conduct occurred in Oregon. 
288,1," Several days after oral argument in this case, defendant Texaco petitioned under the federal bankruptcy law for protection from 
creditors.  Thereafter the United States Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, approved by order a stipulation 
between the parties in this suit.  The stipulation provides that the parties desire this appeal be determined by this court and that 
""[neither] Texaco nor the Attorney General shall use the pendency of Texaco's [bankruptcy] case as a basis to challenge the 
other party's right to proceed with the pending appeal in [this] litigation."" "
289,2," As discussed below, this was the accepted interpretation of ""combination"" when the statute was enacted.  (See post, part 
II.C.1.b.; cf.,  G.H.I.I. v. MTS, Inc. (1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 256, 266 [195 Cal.Rptr. 211, 41 A.L.R.4th 653] [suggesting similar 
interpretation];  Bondi v. Jewels by Edwar, Ltd. (1968) 267 Cal.App.2d 672 [73 Cal.Rptr. 494] [same].) "
290,3," Although overlooked by some prominent commentators who have focused on the history of the federal antitrust laws, it has 
been correctly observed that ""the first legislation spawned by the national antitrust movement of the late nineteenth century 
occurred at the state level."" (Thorelli, The Federal Antitrust Policy: Origin of An American Tradition (1955) pp. 155-157; Rubin, 
supra, 26 U. Fla. L.Rev at p. 657, and fn. 21.) Indeed, it appears from the debates of the Sherman Act, and the language of the 
Clayton Act, that Congress borrowed liberally from state statutes of the day (in addition to the common law).  On the subject of 
mergers, for example, compare the acts of Texas (1899), Mississippi (1900), Texas (1903), and Arkansas (1905), all discussed 
post, pages 1159-1160, with the original language of the Clayton Act (38 Stats. 730 (1914))."
290,4," (1890) Miss. Laws, ch. 36.) Still, the Texas law was well publicized in this early period.  The Texas bill was presented at 
conventions of state legislators in 1889 and 1890, and ""this attention . . . resulted in several states copying [the Texas bill]."" 
(Mathews, supra, Texas Antitrust Laws, pp. 29-30; see also Cotner, supra, at pp. 165-166.) "
291,5," See Letwin, Congress and the Sherman Antitrust Law: 1887-1890  (1956) 23 U. Chi. L.Rev. 221, 249-255; Rubin, supra, 26 
U. Fla. L.Rev. 653, 661, footnote 38; Thorelli, supra, at pages 210-214."
291,6," (1890 La. Acts, No. 86; 1905 Neb. Laws, ch. 162, §§ 1, 2.)"
291,7," In addition to the initial round of states that adopted the Kansas-Maine format (ante, p. 1154), at least five more states adopted 
that format. (1891 Ill. Laws, p. 206; 1897 S.C. Acts, No. 265; 1899 Ark. Acts 41; 1907 Wis. Laws, § 1791j, pp. 432-433; 1907 
Ind.Acts, ch. 243.) Moreover, a number of states, some of which had previously embraced the Texas format, subsequently 
enacted a law using the Kansas-Maine format. (See the laws of Kansas, Texas, and Mississippi, post, fn. 9.)"
291,8," It is widely recognized that the 1889 Texas act served as the model for a number of state acts that followed it.  (Rubin, supra, 
26 U. Fla. L.Rev. 653, 659; Mathews, Texas Antitrust Laws, pp. 29-30.) In addition to the initial laws of Mississippi and Ohio (see 
1890 Miss. Laws, ch. 36; 1898 Ohio Laws, p. 143), the Texas act appears to have been the model for the subsequent acts of 
Kansas, Michigan, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, as well as forming the basis for later revisions of the Texas antitrust 
acts.  (See post, fn. 9.)"
291,9," Texas enacted a new act, similar in all relevant respects to its first, in 1895.  (1895 Tex. Gen. Laws, ch. 83.) Mississippi, in 
1900, and Texas, in 1899, switched from the Texas format to the Kansas-Maine format. (1900 Miss. Laws, ch. 88; 1899 Tex. 
Gen. Laws, ch. 146.) Missouri reenacted its Kansas-type act in 1891 (Mo. Laws, p. 186) and did so again in 1895 (Mo. Laws, p. 
237).  Texas then switched, as did five other states, from the Kansas-Maine format to the Texas format. (1903 Tex. Gen. Laws, 
ch. 94; 1897 Neb. Laws, ch. 79; 1897 Kan. Sess. Laws, ch. 265; 1897 S.D. Laws, ch. 94; 1899 Mich. Pub. Acts, No. 255; 1905 
N.D. Laws, ch. 188.) In 1893, and again in 1897, Illinois reenacted Kansas-type laws (Ill. Laws, p. 89; Ill. Laws, p. 298).  In 1899 
Kansas returned to its original format, and Missouri again reenacted a Kansas-type law (1899 Kan. Sess. Laws, ch. 293; 1899 
Mo. Laws, p. 314).  In 1905, Nebraska switched to a format following the Sherman Act. (1905 Neb. Laws, ch. 162.) Tennessee 
reenacted a law following the Kansas scheme (1903 Tenn. Pub. Acts, ch. 140), and Michigan returned to a Kansas-type law.  
(1905 Mich. Pub. Acts, No. 229.) Arkansas reenacted a Kansas-type law (1905 Ark. Acts, No. 1).  Finally, Missouri continued to 
tinker with its Kansas-type law.  (1907 Mo. Laws, p. 377.) At least one state enacted a law that combined attributes of the two 
formats. (1892 La. Acts, No. 90.) "
292,10," The court first confronted the meaning of the term in  Texas & P. Coal Co. v. Lawson (1896) 89 Tex. 400 [34 S.W. 919]. In that 
case, a coal company leased some of its land to a saloon owner.  The contract provided the company would lease to no other 
saloon; that it would pay its employees by check, not money; and that the saloon would accept the checks as payment, and 
remit to the company two-thirds of the profits as rent.  The court held this illegal under the statute because ""the contract 
provided, not only for the union or association by the parties of their capital, but also for their united and associated action, 
during the entire term, in furtherance of the common object, and was, therefore, a 'combination of capital' and 'acts.'"" (Id., at p. 
920.) Similar decisions focusing on the definition of ""combination"" were handed down thereafter.  (See  Welch v. Phelps & Bigelow 
Windmill Co. (1896) 89 Tex. 653 [36 S.W. 71] [""The purpose of the statute was to prohibit 'two or more persons,' etc., from 
uniting or associating their otherwise independent, separate, and possibly competing 'capital, skill, or acts' . . .""];  Texas Brewing 
Co. v. Templeman (1896) 90 Tex. 277 [38 S.W. 27, 28];  Fuqua v. Pabst Brewing Co. (1896) 90 Tex. 298 [38 S.W. 29, 30].)"

Neb. Laws, ch. 162, § 2; see also 1889 Tenn. Pub. Acts, ch. 250, § 1; 1890 La. Acts, No. 86, § 3; 1907 Ind. Acts, ch. 243, § 2.)"
293,13," Eleven years earlier, a commentator had recommended prohibiting corporations from holding or controlling, directly or 
indirectly, the stock of another corporation.  (Stimson, Trusts  (1888) 1 Harv.L.Rev. 132, 143.) "
294,14," Comparison of selected relevant language (and enforcement provisions) from the various acts and the Reagan bills of 1889 
and 1890 demonstrates that the Cartwright Act, although similar in many respects to the Reagan bill of 1890, is more similar to 
the Texas and Michigan acts.  Comparison also discloses that the language of the Cartwright Act has very little in common with 
that of the Sherman Act. By way of example, some key passages are set out below, with deviation from the words and 
punctuation of the Cartwright Act noted by underscoring. The Cartwright Act.  As originally enacted, the Cartwright Act read: ""A trust is a combination of capital, skill or acts by two or 
more persons, firms, partnerships, corporations or associations of persons, or of any two or more of them for either, any or all of 
the following purposes: [para. ] 1. To create or carry out restrictions in trade or commerce. . . .  [para. ] 5. To make or enter into 
or execute or carry out any contracts, obligations or agreements of any kind or description, . . . so as to directly or indirectly 
preclude a free and unrestricted competition among themselves, . . . or by which they shall agree to pool, combine or directly or 
indirectly unite any interests that they may have connected with the sale or transportation of any such article or commodity, that 
its price might in any manner be affected.  . . ."" (Stats. 1907, ch. 530, § 1 (1) & (5), pp. 984-985.) The Reagan Bill of 1888.  This bill read: ""That a trust is the combination of capital    or skill . . . by two or more persons    . . . for . 
. . the following purposes: [para. ] First. To create or carry out restrictions on trade . . . .  [para. ] Fourth.  To create a monopoly. . 
. ."" (19 Cong.Rec. p. 7512.) The Texas act of 1889.  The original Texas act expanded the scope and specified the reach of the 1888 Reagan bill by rewriting 
the first sentence, and adding a fifth paragraph.  It also narrowed the reach of the act by deleting the monopoly provision.  It read 
as follows: ""That a trust is a combination of capital, skill, or acts by two or more persons, firms, . . . corporations, or associations 
of persons, or of either two or more of them for either, any, or all of the following purposes: First -- To create or carry out 
restrictions in trade . . . . Fifth -- To make or enter into, or execute or carry out any contract    , obligation, or agreement     of any 
kind or description     . . . to . . . preclude a free and unrestricted competition among themselves     . . . or by which they shall 
agree to pool, combine, or . . . unite any interest     that they may have in connection with the sale or transportation of any such 
article or commodity     that its price might in any manner be affected. . . ."" (1889 Tex. Gen. Laws, ch. 117, § 1.) The acts of 
Mississippi and North Dakota closely follow this language.  (1890 Miss. Laws, ch. 36, § 1; 1905 N.D. Laws, ch. 188, § 1.) The Reagan bill of 1890.  This second Reagan bill copied the first sentence of the above act, replaced the monopoly provision, 
renumbered the final sentence as paragraph six, copied the first half of that sentence from the above act, and made syntax and 
punctuation changes in the last half of that sentence.  It read as follows: ""That a trust is a combination of capital, skill, or acts by 
two or more persons, firms, . . . corporations, or associations of persons, or of any two or more of them for either, any, or all of 
the following purposes: [para. ] First.  To create or carry out restrictions in trade . . . [para. ] Fifth. To create a monopoly . . . . 
[para. ] Sixth. To make or enter into or execute or carry out any contract, obligation, or agreement     of any kind or description     
. . . so as to . . . preclude . . . free and unrestricted competition among themselves     . . . or by which they shall agree to pool, 
combine, or . . . unite any interest    . . . they may have connected with the sale or transportation of any such article or 
commodity     that its price may, in any manner, be so affected.  . . ."" (21 Cong.Rec. p. 2456 (1890).) The Michigan act of 1899.  This act modified the first sentence by adding the word ""partnerships,"" substituting ""arts"" for ""acts,"" 
and deleting some punctuation.  It also deleted the monopoly provision, added an opening clause to the fifth paragraph, made 
plural that paragraph's list of ""contracts, obligations or agreements,"" added the phrase ""directly or indirectly"" in two places in the 
middle of that sentence, and modified (consistently with the 1889 Texas act) the syntax of the final clause of the last sentence 
(""that its price might in any manner be affected.  . . ."").  It read: ""That a trust is a combination of capital, skill or arts by two or 
more persons, firms, partnerships, corporations or associations of persons, or of any two or more of them for either, any or all of "
295,," the following purposes: [para. ] 1. To create or carry out restrictions in trade or commerce; . . .  [para. ] 5. It shall hereafter be 
unlawful . . . [to] make or enter into or execute or carry out any contracts, obligations or agreements of any kind or description, . . 
. so as to directly or indirectly preclude a free and unrestricted competition among themselves, . . . or by which they shall agree 
to pool, combine or directly or indirectly unite any interests that they may have connected with the sale or transportation of any 
such article or commodity, that its price might in any manner be affected.  . . ."" (1899 Mich. Pub. Acts, No. 255, § 1 (1) & (5).) 
Michigan, in turn, appears to have followed the language of the Ohio act of 1898.  (See Ohio Laws, p. 143 et seq., § 1 (1) & (5).) (The language of the Sherman Act, by contrast, differed substantially from all of the above.  See ante, pp. 1155-1156, quoting 15 
U.S.C. §§ 1, 2.) In addition to the above noted differences in language and coverage between the Reagan bills and the Cartwright Act, we also 
note that the two Reagan bills differed in another significant respect from the Cartwright Act, and from the acts of Texas and 
Michigan: Unlike the latter acts, the Reagan bills contained essentially no enforcement provision.  (Compare 19 Cong.Rec. 
7512-7513 (1888), and 21 Cong.Rec. 2456 (1890), with 1889 Tex. Gen. Laws, ch. 117, §§ 2-5, 7-9; 1899 Mich. Pub. Acts, No. 
255, §§ 2-3, 5-6, 11; and Stats. 1907, ch. 530, §§ 2-3, 5-6, 11.) This, together with the striking similarity between the 
enforcement provisions of the three acts, further indicates that the Cartwright Act was modeled after the Texas and Michigan 
acts, and not the Reagan bills or the Sherman Act."
295,15," Additionally, it is clear that our Legislature is well aware of the Clayton Act, section 7 of which expressly regulates mergers. 
(15 U.S.C. § 18; see post, fn. 18.) In 1961 the Legislature enacted Business and Professions Code section 16727, essentially 
adopting section 3 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. § 14), which deals with exclusive dealing arrangements. "
296,16," The antimerger provisions of the original three states remain in effect today.  ( Tex. Bus.& Comm. Code Ann., § 15.05(d); 
Miss. Code Ann., § 75-21-13; Ark. Code Ann., § 4-75-301.) We note that the Uniform State Antitrust Act (1974) does not contain an antimerger provision.  This may reflect some 
commentators' concern about the propriety of such state regulation. (See Rubin, supra, 26 U.Fla. L.Rev. 653, 731, 723, fn. 502, 
and authorities cited.) The drafters of at least one modern state antitrust statute specifically declined to adopt the Clayton Act, 
which, inter alia, regulates mergers. (See 15 U.S.C. § 18; coms., Ill. Stat. Ann., ch. 38, § 60 et seq., p. 441 [drafters' comments 
on 1965 Ill. Laws, p. 1943].) "
297,17," (E.g., Von Kalinowsky & Hanson, The California Antitrust Laws: A Comparison With the Federal Laws  (1959) 6 UCLA L.Rev. 
533, 553; but see Folsom & Fellmeth, California Antitrust Law and Practice (1983) § 45, pp. 37-38; Lowell v. Mother's Cake & 
Cookie Co.   (1978) 79 Cal.App.3d 13, 23 [144 Cal.Rptr. 664, 6 A.L.R.4th 184]; Munter v. Eastman Kodak Co.   (1915) 28 
Cal.App. 660, 666 [153 P. 737] [dicta].) We need not decide the Attorney General's claim that the Cartwright Act reaches monopolistic practices by individual firms, 
because the Attorney General's complaint does not allege a monopoly."
297,18," See Kintner, supra, section 10.77, page 292 (Section 7 of the Clayton Act ""was designed to reach acquisitions and mergers 
before they accomplished their anticompetitive effects.  [It] was to reach 'incipient monopolies and trade restraints' which would 
otherwise be immune from attack under the Sherman Act.  Therefore, the Clayton Act speaks in terms of probabilities rather 
than actualities.  The Government need not show that a lessening of competition has already occurred, or that it will certainly 
occur; instead, the Clayton Act merely requires that it is probable that competition will be substantially lessened by the 
transaction."").  (Italics added.) "
298,19," The Attorney General did not challenge the merger on common law grounds, and we do not address the issue here. "
299,20," Cianci's dicta is evidently based on Business and Professions Code section 16720, subdivision (e)(4), which prohibits certain 
activity respecting ""'any . . . article or commodity, that its price might in any manner be affected.'""  (40 Cal.3d at p. 918, italics 
added in Cianci.) This provision -- including the underscored phrase -- appears in the original Texas act of 1889, and most acts 
following it.  (See 1889 Tex. Gen. Laws, ch. 117, § 1; e.g., 1890 Miss. Laws, ch. 36, § 1; 1897 Kan. Sess. Laws, ch. 265, § 1; 
1897 Neb. Laws, ch. 79, § 1; 1898 Ohio Laws, p. 143, § 1(5); 1899 Mich. Pub. Acts No. 255, § 1(5); N.D. Laws, ch. 188, § 1.) 
We are aware of no case construing this language as suggested by Cianci's dicta."
299,21," To the extent it is inconsistent with our conclusion, we disapprove dicta in  Munter, supra, 28 Cal.App. 660, 666. "
301,1," Section 7 of the Clayton Act provides in relevant part: ""No person engaged in commerce or in any activity affecting commerce 
shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital and no person subject to the 
jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission shall acquire the whole or any part of the assets of another person engaged also in 
commerce or any activity affecting commerce, where in any line of commerce or in any activity affecting commerce in any 
section of the country, the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly."" 
(15 U.S.C. § 18.)"
301,2," Section 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act provides: ""Unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, and 
unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, are declared unlawful."" (15 U.S.C. § 45(a)(1).) "
304,3," The provisions of the Cartwright Act relevant to this action are codified in Business and Professions Code sections 16720 and 
16726.  Section 16726 declares: ""Except as provided in this chapter, every trust is unlawful, against public policy and void."" 
Section 16720, in pertinent part, defines a ""trust"" as ""a combination of capital, skill or acts by two or more persons . . . To make 
or enter into or execute or carry out any contracts, obligations or agreements of any kind or description, by which they . . . Agree 
to pool, combine or directly or indirectly unite any interests that they may have connected with the sale or transportation of any . . 
. article or commodity, that its price might in any manner be affected."" (Id., § 16720, subd. (e)(4).)"
304,4," Business and Professions Code section 17200 provides, in relevant part, that ""unfair competition shall mean and include 
unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business practice.  . . ."" "
311,5," The pertinent discussion in Gates is as follows: ""In order to constitute a trust, within the meaning of the statute, there must be a 
'combination of capital, skill or acts by two or more.' 'Combination,' as here used, means union or association.  If there be no 
union or association by two or more of their 'capital, skill or acts,' there can be no 'combination,' and hence no 'trust.' When we 
consider the purposes for which the 'combination' must be formed, to come within the statute, the essential meaning of the word 
'combination,' and the fact that a punishment is prescribed for each day that the trust continues in existence, we are led to the 
conclusion that the union or association of 'capital, skill or acts' denounced is where the parties in the particular case designed 
the united co-operation of such agencies, which might have been otherwise independent and competing, for the accomplishment 
of one or more of such purposes.  In the case stated in the petition there is no 'combination.' The plaintiff bought defendant's 
goods, together with the good will of his business, both of which were subjects of purchase and sale; and, in order to render the 
sale of the good will effectual, the seller agreed that he would not, for one year thereafter, do a like business in that town.  This 
was but a kind of covenant or warranty that the purchaser should have the use and benefit of such good will during that year; for 
it is clear that, if the seller had immediately engaged in a like business at the same place, the purchaser would have had no 
benefit therefrom.  By this transaction neither the capital, skill, nor acts of the parties were brought into any kind of union, 
association, or co-operative action.  The purchaser became the owner of the things sold, and the seller was, by the terms of the 
contract, restrained from doing a thing which, if done, would have defeated in part the effectiveness of the sale.  The agreement 
that the seller would exert himself to aid the purchaser in securing patronage but constituted the former the agent of the latter for 
that purpose, and in no wise contravened the statute.""  (90 Tex. at pp. 564-565 [39 S.W. at pp. 1080-1081].) "
312,6," The majority present three minor arguments in support of their conclusion that the Cartwright Act cannot be construed to cover 
mergers. The first is that at the time the statute was enacted the term ""combination"" referred narrowly to only that kind of 
arrangement in which the combining entities maintain separate and independent interests and identities.  As I have shown, this 
is not so.  The majority may be understood to claim that certain language in  G.H.I.I. v. MTS, Inc. (1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 256, 
266 [195 Cal.Rptr. 211, 41 A.L.R.4th 653], and  Bondi v. Jewels by Edwar, Ltd. (1968) 267 Cal.App.2d 672, 678 [73 Cal.Rptr. 
494], support their construction.  They are wrong: that language says nothing more than that ""combination"" does embrace an 
arrangement between two or more persons within a single entity. The majority's second argument is that had the Legislature intended the Cartwright Act to apply to mergers it would have 
inserted an express antimerger provision as other state legislatures had done.  But if as I have concluded the language of the 
act is broad enough to reach mergers, no such express provision was needed.  If the Legislature has never expressly provided 
that the Cartwright Act is applicable to mergers, it is because it has never had to.  As I have explained, in  Munter v. Eastman 
Kodak Co., supra, 28 Cal.App. 660, the Court of Appeal stated clearly, albeit impliedly, that although only mergers with 
anticompetitive effects are unlawful under the Cartwright Act, mergers are indeed within the act's coverage. The majority's third argument appears to be as follows: in 1961 the Legislature enacted Business and Professions Code section 
16727 (hereinafter section 16727), which essentially incorporated section 3 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. § 14) prohibiting 
exclusive-dealing agreements; in so doing it manifested its recognition that the Cartwright Act did not have the reach of the 
Clayton Act generally; it thereby impliedly recognized that the Cartwright Act did not cover mergers. The argument is 
unpersuasive.  I believe that the Legislature's enactment of section 16727 can reasonably be understood not as the recognition 
the majority claim it is, but rather as a response to the decision in  Rolley, Inc. v. Merle Norman Cosmetics, supra, 129 
Cal.App.2d 844, 845-852, which held that the Cartwright Act did not apply to exclusive-dealing agreements. In an attempt to support their conclusion that the Legislature did not intend to include mergers in the scope of the Cartwright Act, 
the majority assert that that body may have had a reason to so limit the statute's reach.  On this point, however, they engage in 
mere speculation and conjecture -- and altogether unpersuasive speculation and conjecture at that: in view of the fact that it 
sought to further consumer welfare by enacting the Cartwright Act, the Legislature cannot reasonably be deemed to have 
intended the application of the statute to turn on the formal characteristics of an arrangement rather than on its potential 
economic effects. "
313,7," In  Rolley, Inc. v. Merle Norman Cosmetics, supra, 129 Cal.App.2d 844, the court stated: ""the Clayton Act is broader in its 
prohibitions than the Sherman Act. It is in the same respects broader than the Cartwright Act . . . ."" ( Id. at p. 851.) In  Milton v. 
Hudson Sales Corp. (1957) 152 Cal.App.2d 418 [313 P.2d 936], the court followed Rolley: ""the Clayton Act is broader in its 
prohibitions than the Sherman Act, and, in the same respects, is broader than the Cartwright Act . . . ."" ( Id. at p. 441.) In light of 
the foregoing discussion each statement must be considered erroneous. "
314,8," I observe in passing that as of this date the FTC's ""solution"" to the anticompetitive problems posed by the Texaco-Getty merger 
in California appears destined for failure.  As noted above, that ""solution"" was predicated on the expectation that by 1989, when 
the part of the consent order requiring Texaco to supply Getty crude oil to independent refiners in the state expires, there would 
be new supplies of oil from offshore sites to satisfy all market demands.  That expectation, however, will likely be frustrated.  It 
currently appears that offshore sites may not even be leased for oil production until 1990 or later."
314,9," Defendants have submitted briefs in which they present arguments to the contrary.  In the course of my analysis I shall address 
their points.  After briefing was completed, they directed the court's attention to an article by Daniel Oliver, appointed to the FTC 
as Chairman in 1986, which is essentially devoted to an analysis of the present action: Federal and State Antitrust Enforcement: 
Constitutional Principles and Policy Considerations  (1988) 9 Cardozo L.Rev. 1245 [hereinafter Oliver, Federal and State 
Antitrust Enforcement].  Although Chairman Oliver's views cannot be rejected out of hand, they need not be addressed 
separately: they amount to little more than restatements of arguments presented by defendants. "
319,10," Defendants' attempt to empty HSR's savings provision of its substance founders on the plain meaning of the words of the 
clause and hence does not require an extended response.  One point, however, may be made.  Contrary to defendants' 
assertion, nothing in the language of HSR, its purpose, or its legislative history supports, less still compels, the conclusion that 
the statute bars actions in state courts based on state antitrust law.  The legislative history cited by defendants and rehearsed 
in Oliver, Federal and State Antitrust Enforcement, supra, 9 Cardozo L.Rev. at page 1270, establishes only that the savings 
provision was intended, inter alia, to preserve the federal government's right to challenge a merger -- not that it was meant to 
preclude a challenge founded in state law. "
321,11," In  Russo v. Texaco, Inc. (E.D.N.Y. 1986) 630 F.Supp. 682, 685, affirmed (2d Cir. 1986)  808 F.2d 221, the district court noted 
with apparent approval language used by the court of Appeal below: ""That order 'comprehensively [regulated] the merger 
between Texaco and Getty on a nationwide basis.'"" In reliance on that quotation, defendants argue that the consent order is 
indeed ""comprehensive."" Their reliance, however, is misplaced.  The district court's approval cannot be understood to extend 
beyond the Court of Appeal's language to its conclusion that the consent order is ""comprehensive"" for purposes of preemption. 
The district court did not address, less still resolve, the issue of preemption. ""It is axiomatic that cases are not authority for 
propositions not considered."" ( People v. Gilbert (1969) 1 Cal.3d 475, 482, fn. 7 [82 Cal.Rptr. 724, 462 P.2d 580]; accord,  
McDowell & Craig v. Santa Fe Springs (1960) 54 Cal.2d 33, 38 [4 Cal.Rptr. 176, 351 P.2d 344].) "
324,12," Defendants have submitted briefs in which they present arguments to the contrary.  In the course of my analysis I shall 
address their points.  I shall not address, however, the views expressed in Oliver, Federal and State Antitrust Enforcement, 
supra, 9 Cardozo L.Rev. 1245: they amount to little more than restatements of arguments set forth by defendants.  (See fn. 9, 
ante.) "
327,13," To the extent defendants seek to establish that the state's interests in subjecting the Texaco-Getty merger to review in this 
action are not compelling by asserting that the Attorney General ""cannot cite a single previous instance where this State sought 
to challenge a merger under the Cartwright Act,"" they are patently unsuccessful.  First, it simply does not follow from the alleged 
fact that the state has not challenged any other merger under the Cartwright Act that its interests in this particular very large 
merger in this particular very important industry are not compelling.  Second and at least as important, in the past the Cartwright 
Act was as a practical matter unnecessary in view of the vigorous prosecution of Clayton section 7 actions by federal 
enforcement agencies and other parties, and the plain receptivity of the federal courts to such actions.  That situation, as is 
commonly recognized, has changed.  (See, e.g., Hovenkamp, State Antitrust, supra, 58 Ind. L.J. at p. 376 [""the notion that 
federal antitrust law is aggressive . . . is largely a thing of the past""].) "

370,*," Honorable Seybourn H. Lynne, Senior U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of Alabama, sitting by designation. "
371,1," For the purpose of this summary judgment motion, Northern Propane accepted that the relevant geographic market is Mitchell 
and Baker Counties in southwest Georgia and that the relevant product market is propane. The district court suggested that it 
had difficulties with this definition of the relevant markets.  McGahee, 658 F. Supp. at 192 n. 3. The Northern Propane internal 
report discussing the markets does support this definition of the relevant markets. See Plaintiff's Exhibit 87, p. IN01029.  Cf.  
Oahu Gas Service, Inc. v. Pacific Resources, Inc., 838 F.2d 360, 364-66 (9th Cir.1988) (holding market definition to be jury issue 
in case with similar facts)."
371,2," Northern Propane filed a counterclaim against McGahee alleging that he had breached his fiduciary duties while its employee 
by wrongfully extending credit to McGahee Family, Inc., a corporation in which McGahee had a financial interest. Northern 
Propane voluntarily dismissed the counterclaim on February 25, 1985. "
372,3," Plaintiff's Exhibit 5, compare p. COO333 with p. COO328."
372,4," These percentages are based on McGahee's estimates during his deposition. Logically, two competitors engaging in a price 
war in which other competitors do not participate should increase their combined share of the market. These percentages 
indicate that Northern Propane's and McGahee's combined share of the market decreased despite their price war. This anomaly 
is not explained in the record."
372,5," Compare the prices in Plaintiff's Exhibit 15, p. COO907, Plaintiff's Exhibit 16, p. COO851, and Gower's First Affidavit, Exhibit D, 
p. 2, lines 10-13 to the average variable costs in Gower's First Affidavit, Exhibit C, p. 3, lines 26-28. Northern Propane calls 
McGahee's contention ""a blatant misrepresentation of the record,"" but fails to explain why the documents do not support 
McGahee's contention, except to claim one of the three documents concerning prices had a typographical error that was 
corrected later by Gower's Third Affidavit. On the other hand, McGahee merely gives prices and costs and cites their sources 
without fully explaining these numbers."
372,6," Northern Propane responds to this contention by calling it misleading and explains why, but does not support this explanation 
with evidence in the record. The district court assumes Northern Propane sold propane in the Camilla district at prices below 
those charged in other districts.  McGahee, 658 F. Supp. at 197. In March 1982, Northern Propane's discount policy gave each 
individual district the option of offering, with regional office approval, cash discounts, class of customer discounts, and individual 
commercial customer discounts. Plaintiff's Exhibit 1, pp. C1OOO1-C1OOO5. Northern Propane's internal documents show that 
its Camilla district offered these discounts."
372,7," Plaintiff's Exhibit 80, p. COO832. McGahee also contends that Northern Propane attempted to hinder and harass him by not picking up its tanks when requested 
by customers, refilling customers' tanks after being asked to disconnect them, and reporting McGahee to the State Fire Marshal 
for disconnecting Northern Propane's tanks. Unfortunately, the primary source McGahee cites to support these contentions of 
anticompetitive conduct is not part of the record on appeal; therefore, we do not consider them. "
373,8," Justification is not, however, an element of an antitrust plaintiff's prima facie case, but is an affirmative defense.  15 U.S.C. § 
13(b) (Robinson-Patman Act); e.g., Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States, 410 U.S. 366, 93 S. Ct. 1022, 35 L. Ed. 2d 359 (1973)

375,11," The district court apparently focused on the lack of trade secrets, patents, and licenses in finding that there are no substantial 
barriers to entry in this market. Other factors, such as large capital outlays required to start a new business, the existence 
already of excess capacity by existing sellers, the price inelasticity of the market (i.e., consumers do not consume much more if 
the price goes down or much less if the price goes up), and the difficulties buyers may have in changing suppliers are also 
relevant to this question. See Oahu Gas Service, Inc. v. Pacific Resources, Inc., 838 F.2d 360, 366-67 (9th Cir.1988) (upholding 
jury finding that local propane market had high barriers to entry)."
375,12," McGahee brought to the district court's attention, several times, sales it contended were below average variable cost as 
average variable cost was computed by Northern Propane's expert. See supra note 5. Moreover, the district court expressed 
doubts about the allocation of variable and fixed costs by Northern Propane's expert, but made a factual finding nonetheless.

Company v. M/V NAN FUNG, 695 F.2d 1294, 1298 (11th Cir.1983), since it is the province of the jury to assess the 
probative value of the evidence, see Odum v. Celotex Corp., 764 F.2d 1486, 1488 (11th Cir.1985). The district court must 
not ""assess[] the probative value of any evidence presented to it, for this would be an unwarranted extension of the 
summary judgment device."" Gauck v. Meleski, 346 F.2d 433, 436 (5th Cir. 1965).  Lane v. Celotex Corp., 782 F.2d 1526, 1528 (11th Cir.1986); Tippens v. Celotex Corp., 805 F.2d 949, 953 (11th Cir.1986)."

377,27," The debates in 1890 show ""that the main cause which led to the legislation was the thought that it was required by the

379,28," The version of this provision proposed by the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1936 differs slightly from the enacted statute in 
effect today, but the differences are immaterial to the present discussion. In addition, Congress illustrated this principle with an 
example based on injury to a buyer, but the phrase being explained applies equally to a seller's Robinson-Patman Act claim. "
380,29," When considering the role Congress foresaw for objective evidence, i.e., economics, in proving an antitrust violation, one must 
remember Congress did not have the advantage of the plethora of academic writings now available on the subject. The 
development of economic theory as applied to antitrust law is not to be ignored--in fact, courts should use it vigorously in 
furthering the Congressional intent of using objective evidence of prices and costs. On the other hand, an original Congressional 
intent of using evidence of a defendant's subjective intent is not to be ignored today just because the science (art?) of 
economics has made great strides since original passage of the statutes. Economics provides the means for evaluating the 
facts, not the elements of an antitrust violation."
380,31," ""A fair profit"" or ""the necessary minimum of profits"" may reflect an implicit or explicit cost, depending on how a company is 
capitalized. See E. Mansfield, Microeconomics: Theory and Application 181 (4th ed. 1982) (defining implicit and explicit costs). 
Regardless of whether it reflects an implicit or explicit cost, it still should be considered a cost of production under the alternative 
cost doctrine (also known as the opportunity cost doctrine). See id. at 179 (defining and discussing the alternative cost doctrine). "

prices above average variable cost before a fact finder may infer predatory intent and to add verbiage that may confuse a jury.

conclusory statements of an expert, whose analysis focused on the proper test for predatory pricing, to establish the dangerous 
probability of success element. Northern Propane responds by attacking these sources of evidence and by pointing out that it is 
""undisputed"" that Northern Propane's market share declined from 65 percent in 1981 to 35 percent in 1983. Therefore, we 
assume, arguendo, that Northern Propane's market share when McGahee opened for business was 65 percent. See also supra

tortious interference with economic advantage."
395,3," The parties are in dispute whether IPA controls the majority of the Health Plus Board. Although plaintiffs maintain that IPA 
members and persons ""selected by them"" control Health Plus; they point to nothing in the record to support this. Defendants, on 
the other hand, offer the affidavit of Gerald Landgraf, president of Health Plus and a defendant, which states that this is not true. 
(Landgraf Aff. at 3.) Moreover, Landgraf is Executive Director of both IPA and Health Plus which are apparently run out of the same office. In fact, 
plaintiffs contend that IPA has no staff. Instead, Health Plus ""details"" people to perform tasks for IPA."

396,10," However, Dr. Ronald Smaller, the former president of IPA, has testified that ""assuming the existence of Health Plus and IPA, 
unless a physician were an IPA member eligible to treat Health Plus subscribers, he might have difficulty finding patients."""
396,11," One of these was Dr. Cookingham, an allergist, who applied for IPA membership in October of 1981. The other was Dr. 
Tanhehco."
396,12," The IPA physicians who participated in the investigation indicated that plaintiffs overused certain diagnostic tests, performing 
them on a routine rather than selective basis and that there were a number of substantial deficiencies in plaintiffs' records. (S. 
Hassan Dep. Exs. 12, 13; Mackenzie Dep. at 48; Van Duyne Dep. at 64.) The IPA testing policy is that ""allergy testing is not a set of routine procedures and all diagnostic studies done should be 
selectively chosen . . . with specific indications."" (Mackenzie Dep. Ex. 2.) Plaintiff Shawky Hassan has testified, however, that 
""for all allergic patients who are first seen a nasal smear eosinophilin is helpful in determining the initial therapy and subsequent 
progress or failure of treatment."" (S.  Hassan Dep. at 594.) See also S. Hassan Dep. at 489 and 492. "
397,13, Defendants contend that the Hassans' cash revenues declined faster before leaving IPA than afterward. (Lynk Aff. at 19.)

antitrust laws may sue . . . and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained. . . ."" "
398,17," HN6[
] The label ""antitrust standing"" has traditionally been applied to some elements of his injury . . . the focus of the 
doctrine of 'antitrust standing' is somewhat different from that of standing as a constitutional doctrine. Harm to the antitrust 
plaintiff is sufficient to satisfy the constitutional standing requirement of injury in fact, but the Court must make a further 
determination whether the plaintiff is a proper party to bring a private antitrust action. Id. 459 U.S. at 535 n.31."
398,18," In plaintiffs' complaint at paragraph 24, the plaintiffs allege that the ""fees fixed by IPA were consistently below those fees 
which plaintiffs and other allergy specialists in the area had routinely charged non-[Health Plus] patients . . . ."""
398,19," Defendants rely on Kartell v. Blue Shield of Mass., 749 F.2d 922, 930 (1st Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1029, 85 L. Ed. 2d 
322, 105 S. Ct. 2040 (1985) for the proposition that the Sherman Act was intended to protect consumers against prices that "
399,," were too high, not too low. Kartell, however, denied the plaintiff's antitrust claims because no horizontal conspiracy was involved 
-- only a single firm, Blue Shield which was providing the medical service. In dicta, the Court indicated additional reasons to deny 
court supervision of a Blue Shield/physician price bargain.  One of these was because the prices at issue were too low and that 
when that was the case, ""courts at least should be cautious to condemn too speedily -- an arrangement that . . . appears to bring 
low price benefits to the consumer."" Id. at 931."
399,20," Defendants rely on Matsushita Elec. Ind. Co. v. Zenith Radio, 475 U.S. 574, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538, 550, 106 S. Ct. 1348 (1986) 
which stated, in dicta, that: [Plaintiffs, competitors, cannot] recover damages for any conspiracy by petitioners to charge higher than competitive prices 
in the American market. Such conduct would indeed violate the Sherman Act . . . but it would not injure [plaintiffs]: as 
[defendants,] competitors, respondents stand to gain from any conspiracy to raise the market price . . . . That does not mean, however, that consumers could not challenge the conduct because they had presumably been injured. See 
also Tom v. Hawaii Dental Service, 606 F. Supp. 584 (D. Haw. 1985)."
399,21," See also Kiefer-Stewart, supra 340 U.S. at 213 (""agreement[s] among competitors to fix maximum resale prices of their 
products . . . no less than those to fix minimum prices, cripple the freedom of venders and thereby restrain their ability to sell in 
accordance with their own judgment.""); ABA ANTITRUST SECTION, ANTITRUST LAW DEVELOPMENTS, at 33, (2d Ed. 
1984)."
399,22," This is not established by the record. IPA members were merely encouraged and not obligated to do this under their 
agreement. (Van Duyne Dep. 62.)"
399,23," The Supreme Court in Matsushita stated: For purposes of this case, it is enough to note that respondents have not suffered an antitrust injury unless petitioners have 
conspired to drive respondents out of the relevant markets by (i) pricing below the level necessary to sell their products, or 
(ii) pricing below some appropriate measure of costs."
399,24," If plaintiffs were to allege that defendants set allergy reimbursement levels too low in order to drive plaintiffs out of the market 
with the aim of giving that business to primary care physicians, that theory is contradicted by the fact that plaintiffs were 
immediately replaced by two other allergists, Drs. Cookingham and Tanhehco. "
400,25," Defendant Landgraf stated in his affidavit at paragraphs 8 and 9 that ""no specialty group determined maximum fees applicable 
to procedures performed by specialists because no specialty group comprised a majority on either the IPA Finance Committee 
or IPA's Board of Directors."" Defendants rely on Vogel v. American Soc. of Appraisers, 744 F.2d 598 (7th Cir. 1984), which stated, in dicta, that plaintiff had 
failed to satisfy his burden of showing that the agreement complained of was an agreement among competitors as most of the 
members of the Society were not gem appraisers (as was plaintiff), and that of the few gem appraisers only four were located in 
Illinois. That case is not applicable here for the reasons indicated below. Moreover, the other case cited by defendants, Pennsylvania Dental Assoc.  v. Medical Services Assoc. of Penn., 745 F.2d 248 
(3d Cir. 1984) is inapplicable. In that case, the 32-member Board of Directors which had the responsibility for setting pricing 
decisions, included only two dentists.  The rest were non-dentists. The court stated that ""health care providers do not constitute 
a majority on the Board."" Id. at 258. Thus, there was no conspiracy. This case may well support plaintiffs rather than defendants. "
401,26," As mentioned above, the IPA Finance Committee, which is appointed by the IPA Board of Directors, sets the fees. (Troutman 
Dep. Exs. 5, 6 and 7; Landgraf Aff. at 31.) Both these entities are made up of physicians or osteopaths."
401,27," ANTITRUST LAW DEVELOPMENTS, supra n.20 at 22."
401,28," Once experience with a particular kind of restraint enables the Court to predict with confidence that the rule of reason will 
condemn it, it has applied a conclusive presumption that the restraint is unreasonable.  For the sake of business certainty and 
litigation efficiency, we have tolerated the invalidation of some agreements that a full blown inquiry might have proved to be 
reasonable. Maricopa, 457 U.S. at 344. This experience ""is normally provided by a history of cases involving a particular type of challenged 
conduct in which application of the rule of reason has almost always resulted in a finding of anticompetitive effect."" ANTITRUST 
LAW DEVELOPMENTS, supra, at 22. "
402,29," In Broadcast Music, the Court held that the rule of reason should be applied to test the legality of ""blanket"" music performance 
licenses offered by copyright holders who had joined in a joint venture to market the licenses. This was essentially the holding in NCAA, 468 U.S. at 101, in which the Court wrote: ""what is critical is that this case involves an 
industry in which horizontal restraints on competition are essential if the product is to be available at all."""
402,30," The Court contrasted the facts in Maricopa with HMOs. An alternative to the fee-for-service type of insurance plan is illustrated by the health maintenance organizations authorized 
under the Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. § 300e et seq. . . .  Under this form of prepaid health 
plan, the consumer pays a fixed periodic fee to a functionally integrated group of doctors in exchange for the group's 
agreement to provide any medical treatment that the subscriber might need. The economic risk is thus borne by the 
doctors. Id. at 339 n.7."
402,31," Being a member of IPA means only that a physician can offer his services to Health Plus members and not that he cannot 
provide services to patients who are not members of Health Plus. (Lynk Aff. para. 13.) Moreover, ""IPA physicians are free to 
accept affiliation with any other health care financing organization, without forfeiting their IPA membership."" (Id. para. 15.) "
403,32," Unlike traditional fee-for-service systems, in which there is incentive to provide greater amounts of service, Health Plus 
provides a set fee payment to the IPA which remains constant regardless of the actual utilization of service. This provides a 
strong incentive to stop overutilization. This was not the case in Maricopa. In that case the foundations, unlike Health Plus, did 
not insure risks themselves -- rather, the insurance companies did. In essence, the foundations acted as the insurance 
companies' claims agents on a contract basis. They administer the claims and, to some extent, review the medical necessity and propriety of the treatment for which a 
claim is entered. Id. at 359 n.3."
403,33," Unlike the facts presented in Maricopa, Health Plus and IPA share any deficit or surplus that results from the provision of non-
physician services."
403,34," In fact, payments have been withheld and lost in some years. (See Landgraf Aff. para. 11.) "
404,35," Obviously, if the maximum levels were too high, costs would exceed revenues from Health Plus customers. In that situation, 
IPA members would lose their ""risk withhold"" and/or be forced to raise prices to consumers. This is not like the facts in Maricopa, supra in which the prices fixed were the prices charged to the consumer."
404,36," Plaintiffs also maintain that there is a question as to the definitions of the markets in which plaintiffs compete. Plaintiffs argue 
that their competitors include other allergy specialists and not general practitioners performing allergy services. Even if plaintiffs' 
competitors were limited to specialists, plaintiffs fail to indicate how this is relevant to the competitive impact on price. "
405,37," See also Hoffman v. Delta Dental Plan of Minn., 517 F. Supp. 564 (D. Minn. 1981). "
406,," We reject defendants' argument that Delta, as a single entity, is not a horizontal competitor . . . . Because of the member 
control of Delta as evidenced by member domination of the Delta board of directors, the fact that membership is exclusively 
composed of participating dentists, and the creation of Delta by the Minnesota Dental Association, we conclude that the 
existence of concerted action is not precluded as a matter of law . . . .  Moreover, because of member control of Delta, 
Delta can be considered the agent of its members. Thus, the requirement that the alleged conspirators be horizontal 
competitors of the injured party is also satisfied."
406,38," See Pa. Dental Ass'n, supra n.24 at 257 and n.5."
406,39," ""The category of restraints classed as group boycotts is not to be expanded indiscriminately, and the per se approach has 
generally been limited to cases in which firms with market power boycott suppliers or customers in order to discourage them

the retailers. In 1978, members of Northwest voted to expel Pacific, offering no explanation at the time nor giving Pacific notice, 
a hearing, or any other opportunity to challenge the decision. Pacific contended that the expulsion was a group boycott and per 
se violation of § 1. "
407,41," Although defendants contend that there is an additional element, that a defendant must act to disadvantage competitors, this 
is at most a part of the third element. ""Cases to which this Court has applied the per se approach have generally involved joint 
efforts . . . to disadvantage competitors by 'either directly denying or persuading or coercing suppliers or customers to deny 
relationships the competitors need in the competitive struggle.'"" Id. at 211."
407,42," Even plaintiffs' expert testified that if a plan deals only with selected physicians whose methods suit a PPO's aims, it could 
benefit by receiving the lowest bids and, by operating in this manner, can be procompetitive. (Leonard Dep. at 980.) "
408,43," In fact, when asked if he had any evidence of any primary care physicians gaining as a result of the plaintiffs' leaving the IPA, 
plaintiffs' expert testified that ""[he didn't] know what happened to the Hassans' patients."" (Leonard Dep. at 1005.)"

organizations. (Leonard Dep. at 609.) Moreover, although he opined that an HMO market existed and even that a submarket for 
HMOs existed for those who strongly prefer HMOs, he had no facts to support this. (Leonard Dep. at 600-610.) "

reasonably calculated to prejudice the public interest."" Lamb Enterprises v. Toledo Blade Co., 461 F.2d 506, 517 (6th Cir. 1972), 
cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1001, 34 L. Ed. 2d 262, 93 S. Ct. 325 (1972). "
410,52," Of course, Health Plus subscribers can still receive treatment from the plaintiffs, but Health Plus will not cover it."
410,53," See Ball, 784 F.2d 1325 (market HN23[
] power does not exist if entry is easy). Plaintiffs assert, without any evidence, that 
the ""barriers to entry . . . presented to an allergy specialist denied IPA membership are high indeed."""
410,54," Although plaintiffs contend that ""by driving plaintiffs from the market, defendants have decreased the availability of allergy 
specialty services,"" they present no evidence that this is true. In fact, they acknowledge in their response to defendants' motion 
for summary judgment that primary care physicians can perform allergy services. (Plaintiffs' Brief at 18.) Therefore, the public 
has not been harmed in that allergy services are still available not only from the plaintiffs, but also from other physicians as well. 
Plaintiffs make no claim that the quality of these services is not sufficient.  Lamb Enterprises, 461 F.2d 506. Although the 
plaintiffs contend that ""allergy specialists"" are the relevant market, they do not have any evidence. In fact, plaintiffs' economist 
has testified that their competitors are not specialists (Leonard Dep. 627) and that primary care physicians are in the same 
product market. (Leonard Dep. at 632-3.) Moreover, plaintiffs are still in the relevant market so there is the same amount of 
allergy specialty services available."
410,55," Affiant Lynk stated that ""Health Plus . . . authorizes for allergy testing and reimbursement not only two board-certified or board-
eligible allergists [Drs. Tanhehco and Cookingham] but twenty other physicians as well [which illustrates] the range of 
competitive alternatives available in the allergy services market."" (Aff. at 20 n.16.)"
410,56," Plaintiffs rely on FTC v. Indiana Federation of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 106 S. Ct. 2009, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445 (1986) for the 
proposition that ""where clear anticompetitive motives are present and no clear competitive benefits exist, an extended market 
analysis is not required."" "
411,57," The Court relied on 4 Restatement Torts, 2d § 766B."
411,58," Moreover, plaintiff's claim for exemplary damages, that is, damages for mental and physical anguish and humiliation, must 
also be dismissed. It is well established ""that HN25[
] one who commits the tort of intentionally interfering with another's 
business relations is subject to liability for ""pecuniary damages. . . . Exemplary damages are ordinarily inappropriate in 
commercial contexts. . . ."" Cf. Kewin v. Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins.  Co., 409 Mich. 401, 295 N.W.2d 50 (1980); Getman v. 
Mathews, 125 Mich. App. 245, 249, 335 N.W.2d 671 (1983). Although plaintiffs allege that defendants' conduct was especially 
egregious and was undertaken with the knowledge it would cause plaintiffs significant personal distress, they offer no supporting 
evidence. "
420,1," The findings of fact and conclusions of law set forth in this opinion are adopted from proposed findings and conclusions 
provided by the parties to this suit. I have carefully reviewed all such findings and conclusions and the ultimate findings of fact 
and conclusions of law are my own. See Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 572 (1985). "
421,2," The complaint also charged Foseco with violation of the Robinson-Patman Act for price discrimination in connection with the 
sale of SIVEX filters; however, that count was dropped by Consolidated and has been dismissed with prejudice. The charges of 
direct infringement of the '212 and '303 patents against Foseco were transferred to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, where 
these charges have been dismissed without prejudice. FIL remains charged with contributory infringement of these patents in 
this action. "
425,3," Dr. Reti was a classmate of plaintiff's expert, Dr. Diran Apelian, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Tr. 1082). Dr. 
Reti received his Bachelors, Masters, and Ph.D. in metallurgy from MIT, and had taken a course in ceramics during his 
education at MIT (Reti Dep., 7/10/84, p. 4). In view of Mr. Reti's education and other evidence in this case, I find Mr. Dore's 
statement that he gave Dr. Reti detailed supervision and that this was required not credible."
425,4," This patent covers the formula for the slurry used to manufacture Consolidated's ceramic foam filter. Consolidated concedes 
that Foseco does not use this formula and has not sued for infringement of this patent. "
428,5," Because this litigation was commenced in May 1982, the parties agree that the subsequent amendments to the patent law in 
1984 do not apply to the question of the enforceability of the patents in suit. "
430,6," Defendants argue that Consolidated engaged in additional inequitable conduct in misleading the examiner into neglecting to 
look at the Schwartzwalder '094 and other patents. I agree that statements made in Consolidated's application process could 
have and were probably intended to have that effect. In view of the findings made above, however, I conclude that the issue of 
whether Consolidated's limited disclosure amounted to inequitable conduct need not be reached."
430,7," Open cell or open pore plastic foam having no thin walls or windows separating the cells was available in the 1960's. 
(DX1042). If walls or windows did occur in the foam, the '094 patent taught that the percentage of open cells could be 
""beneficially increased"" by dissolving these membranes with caustic soda (sodium hydroxide). "
433,8," Consolidated contended the purpose of the upwardly sloped filter was to facilitate the removal of air bubbles, but I credit the 
testimony of defendants' expert, Mr. Hatch, that at least where the degree of slope is slight as claimed in the '056 patent, this 
would have no such effect. "
435,9," Foseco's witness, Dr. Ott, presented defendants' case for non-infringement under the '081 patent, and did not contend that this 
feature of the '081 claims was not present in the SIVEX foundry filter (Tr. 3181). I find no other evidence to dispute 
Consolidated's evidence that the asserted claims of the '081 patent literally read on the SIVEX filters and their use. "
438,10," Because the good faith of Alusuisse and Consolidated in asserting the patent in suit against Foseco was put in issue by 
Foseco, evidence was received on settlement discussions in 1980-1982 between parties prior to the filing of this lawsuit 
(FRE408). "
446,11," Defendants also allege that Consolidated brought its Robinson-Patman claim in bad faith. Defendants may pursue this claim 
in a Rule 11 motion if they believe it has merit. "
464,1," Had the accessory use provision of the Dallas ordinance been construed to have the meaning which the building inspection 
department understood it to have, that would not have rendered the ordinance facially unconstitutional."
464,2," It is true that, under Texas Local Government Code, § 211.009(c), the building inspection department's notices may have had 
the legal effect of requiring a four-to-one or five-to-zero vote in VIP's favor at the Board of Adjustment in order for VIP to prevail 
on an appeal. However, as VIP never took an appeal, this is irrelevant."
464,3," Section 211.010(c) provides: ""(c) An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action that is appealed unless the official from whom the appeal is 
taken certifies in writing to the board facts supporting the official's opinion that a stay would cause imminent peril to life or 
property. In that case, the proceedings may be stayed only by a restraining order granted by the board or a court of record 
on application, after notice to the official, if due cause is shown."" It is obvious in this case that the exception ""imminent peril to life or property"" would not be applicable. While the Dallas Development Code authorizes the building inspection department to have utilities disconnected in case of 
zoning violations, the City never did this. Although its violation notice threatened to take such action after fifteen days, the fifteen-
day period was sufficient for appeal to the Board of Adjustment and such appeal by its stay provisions would have prevented any 
such action. I also observe that under the Dallas Development Code it is a defense to prosecution that the person prosecuted is 
in compliance with an order of the Board of Adjustment, even if the party's action would otherwise constitute a violation. "
471,1," Smith Kline U.K. is not a defendant in this action. By reason of related litigation in the United Kingdom, plaintiff was enjoined 
from proceeding against Smith Kline U.K. in this country. Although originally named as a defendant in the present action, the 
amended complaint deleted Smith Kline U.K. as a party defendant. "
472,2," Defendants contend that MgK was being developed solely as a dietary supplement for nonpotassium-sparing diuretics. 
Plaintiff, on the other hand, contends that a potassium-sparing diuretic containing MgK was also being developed. Plaintiff points 
out that the MgK United States Patent sets forth a combination of a magnesium/potassium composition and hydrochlorothiazide 
(P-TAB 89, column 3). Hydrochlorothiazide was a basic ingredient in many of the diuretic drugs."
472,3," I will refer to the papers and exhibits concerning the pending motion to dismiss for summary judgment as follows: defendants' 
brief in support of this motion is designated ""defendants' brief,"" and the accompanying exhibits as D-TAB 1, etc. Defendants 
reply brief is designated ""defendants' reply"" and the accompanying exhibits as DR-TAB 1, etc. Defendants' fact supplement is "

supplement"" and the accompanying exhibits as PS-TAB 1, etc."
473,4," Dyazide is a compound containing triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide. Dyrennium, another drug manufactured by Smith Kline 
U.S., is composed only of triamterene. "
478,5, Neither memorandum is authenticated.
478,6," In the limited excerpt of Dr. Guthrie's testimony provided by defendants, Dr. Guthrie never explicitly states that he is referring to 
MgK. However, it appears that Dr. Guthrie was referring to MgK. In the excerpt, Dr. Guthrie is explaining the conclusion stated in 
an unidentified document. At the end of the excerpt, counsel asks Dr. Guthrie if he recalls ""writing any other memos about Dr. 
Bloch's product."" This question implies that the unidentified document concerned MgK and that, therefore, Dr. Guthrie's 
comments concerned MgK. "
479,7," The Marketing Recommendation is not authenticated. However, defendants agree that the document at P-TAB 55 is indeed a 
marketing recommendation written by defendants' marketing department and delivered on January 15, 1975. (Defendants' fact

(Defendants' fact supplement at 31). "
484,15," The letter is unauthenticated. Also, the quality of the copy is so poor that the name of the addressee cannot be read."
484,16, The memorandum is unauthenticated.

492,30," Plaintiffs evidence indicates that, in 1974, plaintiff assigned his entire right, title and interest in the licensing agreement to 
trustees. Nothing in the evidence indicates that plaintiff reobtained these rights. The evidence also indicates that, in 1982, 
plaintiff assigned the rights to develop MgK to Lansdowne Research & Development Limited and never reobtained these rights. "
497,1," Rule 74.01(b). Plaintiff's First Amended Petition for damages filed November 17, 1986 was amended by interlineation on April 
29, 1987. The petition was in three counts -- Count I, conspiracy; Count II, tortious interference with business expectancy and 
Count III, violation of the Missouri Antitrust Law, ch. 416, R.S.Mo. 1986. The defendants, Jenn Air, Roth Distributing Co., and 
Wick, filed motions to dismiss Counts I, II, and III, and the trial court sustained the motions as to Count III, but overruled the 
motions as to Counts I and II. Thereafter plaintiff voluntarily dismissed Counts I and II and the trial court in its ""memorandum and 
order"" of January 4, 1988, entered a final judgment on Count III for purposes of appeal. The original petition was filed on 
December 27, 1984. After certain motions to dismiss the appeal were filed in this court, and were originally taken with the case, this court, on its own 
motion, on June 2, 1988, set aside the orders taking the motions to dismiss the appeal with the case, denied the respondents 
motions to dismiss the appeal, and granted appellant leave to file a late notice of appeal. Rule 81.07. The order dismissing 
Count III is, under the facts, an appealable order. "
499,2," The legislative history of the Sherman Act is replete with statements that the Act was designed to supplement rather than to 
preempt state law. Senator Sherman so argued. 21 Cong. Rec. 2456-57 (1890) quoted in Hovenkamp, supra, 58 Ind. L. J. at 
379. It has been recognized that in addition to federal statutes state antitrust laws have played a part in antitrust enforcement. The 
majority of the states have passed legislation which generally tracks the Sherman Act. Considerable litigation exists, it is said, 
under some of these laws -- notably the Donnelly Act in New York, N. Y. Gen. Bus. Law § 340 (McKinney 1968 Supp.) and the 
Cartwright Act in California, Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 16700-16760 (West 1983). See P. Jones, Litigating Private Antitrust 
Actions, § 10.2 at 5 (1984). "

] Rate regulation is designed to prevent a public utility from making excess monopoly profits and to assure fair prices 
and adequate service to consumers. The most common method of rate regulation, and the method used in Oklahoma, is to 
control the utility's aggregate revenue by application of the formula R = O + B(r).  Application of Oklahoma Natural Gas 
Company, Okl., 406 P.2d 273, 277 [1965] and State ex rel. Cartwright v. Okl. Natural Gas, Okl., 640 P.2d 1341, 1349 [1982]. ""R"" represents the utility's allowed revenue requirements. ""(r)"" is the utility's allowed rate of return on its rate base. HN4[
] A public utility is entitled to earn a rate of return sufficient to 
enable it to operate successfully, maintain its financial integrity, attract capital and compensate its investors for the risk assumed.  
Lone Star Gas Co. v. Corporation Com'n., Okl., 648 P.2d 36, 39 [1982]. ""O"" represents the utility's operating expenses. HN5[
] It encompasses both out-of-pocket costs, such as wages and raw 
materials, and depreciation of capital assets used to provide the regulated product. Since rates are determined prospectively, 
""O"" should theoretically represent the firm's future operating expenses, but since the future is difficult to forecast, ""O"" traditionally 
has been based upon actual expenses incurred by the utility during a recent past period referred to as the ""test year."" This is the 
method employed in Oklahoma.  Southwestern Public Service Co. v. State, Okl., 637 P.2d 92, 98 [1981]. The test year in the 
present case was 1984. ""B"" represents the utility's rate base. HN6[
] This is the amount upon which the utility is permitted to make a profit.  Application of Oklahoma Natural Gas Co., supra at 277. In Oklahoma this amount is based upon the value of the property ""used and useful

expenses incurred in the test year. In several instances, advertisements were found which were information oriented, but 
they were disallowed in accordance with the Oklahoma Statutes since they did not carry the statement 'paid for by 
ratepayers.' Staff disallowed all contributions and club dues (annual amount of $ 411,176). ""Mr. Buck explained a year end composite factor of 93.47% was used to allocate SBC fourth quarter expenses to SWBT, 
and a composite factor of 12.20% to allocate to Oklahoma, resulting in a downward adjustment of ($ 77,348) for the 
quarter. This computed amount was then compared to the actual amount of SBC costs charged to Oklahoma, with an 
adjustment made for the difference. Since Staff adjustments had already been made in the area of advertising, 
contributions and dues, aircraft expense, and treasury department expense, these amounts were removed both from the 
SBC expense allocation pool and the amount actually allocated to SWBT, thus avoiding double counting. An adjustment of 
minus ($ 460,011) for the quarter was made to SBC allocated Treasury Department costs, because they were abnormally 
high in the last quarter. An adjustment was made to normalize SBC executive department and pensions/benefits expenses "

allocate G.H.Q. expenses for the last quarter, resulting in an adjustment of a negative ($ 733,576) for the quarter. ""Mr. Buck further testified a review was made of the financial records to ascertain what records are available to support 
Bellcore's financial statements, its billings to its owners, and its reports of charges to work projects. This involved the 
examination of procedures for cost allocation, overhead cost processing and billing, and entailed the tracking of costs back 
through the system to the point of examining original source documents such as expense vouchers on a sample basis."

original data used for computing the factors and recomputed the factors to ascertain that the Oklahoma portion was, in fact, 
based on the stated factors. She found some inconsistencies in the data reported by the states to GHQ for use in 
calculating the prorate factors. Her findings, together with the need for a means to year end the prorate factors, led her to 
calculate a composite prorate factor of 12.20 percent based on each state's year end investment and employees, and the 
revenues and expenses for the last quarter of 1984. She recommended this composite prorate factor be used to calculate 
the year end level of GHQ expense charged to Oklahoma. This resulted in an adjustment of $ 6,021,496 (total state) for the 
test year. Since Staff made several adjustments and specific expense disallowances to the prorated GHQ expense, Mr. 
Buck incorporated the 12.20 prorate percentage in calculating his adjustment to the GHQ expense for the test year and

537,42," These minimum guidelines are suggested in one of the dissents. The court also refers the Commission to Section XII of 
another dissent for further guidance in establishing minimum standards of disclosure for SWBT. Unlike the author of the latter "
538,," dissent, the court does not believe that the entire rate order must be vacated and remanded. The court also disagrees with the 
following parts of the thesis advanced in Section XII of that dissent:"
538,1," . Income taxes paid by SWBT are not properly includable as an operating expense. [See Oklahoma Natural Gas Co. v. 
Corporation Commission, 90 Okl. 84, 216 P. 917, 922 (1923)]."
538,2, . The court should determine SWBT's appropriate rate of return on equity.
538,3," . The Commission Staff should conduct a detailed audit of the records of each affiliate. [While those transactions defined as 
""payments to affiliates"" must be carefully audited, the Staff's resources are limited and they should concentrate on conducting 
detailed audits of SWBT's payments to affiliates.]"
538,4, . Prepayments of operating expenses may not be included in cash working capital.
538,5, . The court should select the appropriate depreciation method for SWBT.
538,43," One of the dissents voices well-founded concern about SWBT's method of billing its affiliates for services on an incremental 
cost plus contribution basis. There are several reasons for billing affiliates for services on an incremental cost basis -- the preferred method according to 
managerial accounting theory. For example, as in the present case, there may not be a readily ascertainable market price. 
Also, unless fixed assets are being used at full capacity, a corporation can always increase its overall profitability by selling 
additional units at a price above its incremental or variable cost for that unit. While incremental cost pricing is appropriate 
for transactions between two unregulated affiliates, when one of the affiliates is a regulated entity a new problem is 
introduced. Since ratepayers have paid the cost of the fixed assets of a regulated affiliate, they are entitled to recover from 
the price charged to an unregulated affiliate not only the variable costs but also the fixed costs of producing the product."

541,47," In United States v. Western Elec. Co., Inc., supra note 26 at 854, the court stated: ""[HN31[
] a] Regional Holding Company could also subsidize its competitive ventures by transferring assets from its 
regulated affiliates to its unregulated affiliates at less than their cost or below their market value. Such a practice would not 
only adversely affect the ratepayers who ultimately fund the research and development costs of the transferred assets, but 
it would, once again, impede fair and effective competition in the competitive market: this cross subsidization would give the 
company's unregulated enterprise an obvious and improper advantage over its competitors."""

541,49," In United States v. American Tel. and Tel. Co., supra note 1 at 201 and 203, the court stated: ""Those who claim that the Operating Companies should be compensated for assets transferred to AT&T misperceive both 
the law and the nature of the proposed reorganization. Under long-established general legal principles, HN32[
] the 
transfer of assets between a parent and its subsidiary is not an arm's length transaction for which compensation is required. 
Corporate law holds that such a transfer constitutes an intra-enterprise exchange for which compensation is not necessary."
541,*," * * * Opponents of the settlement rely on Democratic Central Committee v. Washington Metropolitan Transit Commission, 158 
U.S. App. D.C. 7, 485 F.2d 786 [D.C.Cir 1973], as allegedly requiring a different result. To be sure, the Court of Appeals 
held in that case that capital gains realized on the disposition of assets do not automatically flow to the firm's investors but 
instead inure to the benefit of ratepayers, and opponents of the proposed decree conclude from that holding that AT&T 
must compensate the Operating Companies and thus, indirectly, local ratepayers. But there is a crucial difference between 
the disposition of assets that was involved in that case and the transfer of assets proposed here. In Democratic Central "
542,," Committee, the assets were taken out of operation and out of the rate base; obviously, when this occurred a gain was 
realized and it then became necessary to determine to whom the benefit of that gain should inure. But no assets are here 
being removed from public service: the same assets will continue to be used to provide the same services to the same 
ratepayers, and the assets will remain subject to the same ratemaking jurisdictions of the same regulators."
542,*," * * * This result also makes sense from a practical point of view, for several reasons."
542,*," * * * Third, payment of compensation would convert what would otherwise be a tax-free transfer into a taxable exchange, thus 
exposing the Operating Companies to possibly billions of dollars in federal and state tax liabilities."" [Footnote references 
deleted.]"
542,50," As noted in section IV of one of the dissents: "". . . . the fact remains that evaluating SWBT's property rights will not become less difficult as time goes by. Indeed it will be 
more difficult because the more time that elapses between the divestiture and the determination of vital facts and resolutions of 
critical issues, the more difficult it will be to unravel further complexities wrought by constant corporate shifting of assets and 
modifications of accounting principles and procedures. The sooner the issue is resolved the better."""

requests are sometimes blamed on divestiture, but in fact they may stem from the need to raise capital for outside ventures, 
lavish advertising campaigns, and the construction of plants and the hiring of staff suitable for what the Regional Holding 
Companies consider themselves to be -- diversified conglomerates which are fast outgrowing their modest and relatively 
pedestrian telephone origins."" 592 F. Supp. at 863. The holding companies' response to this is that if the ventures are successful, the ratepayers will benefit from lower capital

subject to serious question in view of the fact that directory advertising revenue rose from $ 744 million in 1984 to $ 974.8 million 
in 1985 and then backed off some in 1986 to $ 824.1 million according to SWBC's 1986 Annual Report. Is the 1984 revenue

protect the economic well-being of SWBT."
567,62," The court discussed one aspect of this financial phenomenon in United States v. W. Elec. Co., 592 F. Supp. at 864 saying: ""Thus, to the extent that a Regional Holding Company raises funds jointly for both its competitive ventures and its regulated 
services, the cost of capital may be lower for the competitive venture (because it will be averaged with the lower capital 
costs of the regulated monopoly) but higher for the regulated telephone service. The ratepayers will then, in effect, be 
subsidizing the activities of the competitive venture by assuming, through higher interest rates, part of its cost. It follows 
that, if diversification of the Regional Holding Companies into new competitive ventures enhances their financial viability at 
all, the beneficiaries will more likely than not be those holding companies, their managers, and their unregulated affiliates, 
not the Operating Companies which provide local telephone service."""

576,76," For example, there should have been an adjustment to reflect a reduction of work force in 1985 -- a reduction of nearly 2,900 
employees which could amount to over $ 87 million given an average salary of only thirty thousand dollars plus fringe benefits, 
perks, taxes, and payroll handling expense. SWBC's 1985 Annual Report reported on page 5 that: ""The telephone company now is serving more customers with fewer employees. In 1984, the telephone company reduced 
its work force 4.2 percent [to about 68,700 employees]. In 1985, the number dropped another 3.4 percent. The telephone 
company achieved these reductions in force while gaining more than 500,000 customer lines."" And at page 7 of the report SWBC says that SWBT had 65,836 employees as of December 31, 1985. It had only 61,770 as of 
December 31, 1986, according to SWBC's 1986 Annual Report. Another substantial adjustment that should have been made is with regard to the excessive amount of expense pumped into the 
pension fund for SWBT employes in 1984 which resulted from ""assuming"" too low a rate of return on pension assets in 1984 -- 
the test year. The magnitude of this expense overstatement came to light in SWBC's 1986 annual report at page 39. Of course, 
when this matter was heard in September 1985, the major accounting standard change -- SFAS No. 87 -- had not yet been 
published. Standard No. 87 was published in December 1985 (See Financial Accounting Standards, Explanation and Analysis 
(CCH) 843) and its use was begun by SWBC effective January 1, 1986. Whether its adoption by FASB was known by SWBC's 
chief accountant or the Commission staff in September 1985 is not disclosed. If it was it should have been an important 
adjustment of the 1984 operating expenses based on an anticipated substantial decrease in the 1984 pension cost. What should 
have been determined, however, or at least considered, was why the 1984 pension cost was abnormally high and whether ""a 
higher assumed investment earnings rate"" that was being used in 1985 should have been used to reduce the 1984 pension cost 
-- and consequently effect a substantial downward adjustment of the 1984 operating expenses. But the record is silent with regard to Oklahoma's share of the pension cost except for a $ 40,638,000 operating expense 
deduction in the December 29, 1983, order. See supra note 73. Oklahoma's share should have been substantial. The modified treatment of SWBC's pension expense (a deductible operating expense) after the 1984 test year furnishes a 
dramatic example of how changes in accounting principles and altered assumptions can result in immense changes in a 
company's profit-and-loss statement. It is figure juggling at its best and is shown at page 39 of the 1986 Annual Report:"
576,1984, 
576,1985,  
577,1986,"  Pension Cost (millions) $ 190.6 $ 109.2 $ (58.9) Amount capitalized in property, plant and equipment $ 21.9"
577,11, .7 $ (5.8) Pension Cost for 1986 was broken down as follows: Service costs -- benefits earned during period (in millions) $ 90.0 Interest cost on projected benefit obligation
577,276, .6 Actual return on plan assets (878.1) Other Net
577,452," .6 Net Pension Cost $ (58.9) SWBC explained the enormous 1985 reduction in pension costs (and an even greater drop in 1986) below what was reported for 
the test year -- 1984 -- this way: ""The decline in pension cost from 1984 to 1985 was due primarily to the utilization of a higher assumed investment 
earnings rate. The higher rate reflects a change in the investment strategy for the pension plans' assets as well as 
continued increases in the actual rates of return experienced by the plans' assets. The effect of this change was to 
decrease 1985 pension cost by approximately $ 94.4. "
578,," ""Statement No. 87 requires certain disclosures to be made reconciling the fair value of the plans' assets with amounts 
reported in the Corporation's balance sheets. This comparison, while intended to provide a general indication of the 
soundness of the pension plans' financial status, can be misleading. This is because the pension plans' assets are not 
general assets of the Corporation but are instead entrusted to irrevocable trust funds to provide retirement and survivor 
benefits. ""A point in time comparison of the fair value of the plans' net assets to the estimated projected benefit obligation has certain 
limitations. This is because market conditions will result in fluctuations in the fair value of the plans' net assets while having 
no direct effect on the actual benefits to be paid. In addition, the projected benefit obligation is based on assumptions 
concerning future events, conditions and payments covering a time period equivalent to the estimated life span of the 
existing employee work force. If actual experience differs from expectations, the benefit obligation will be affected. 
Consequently, a point in time comparison of the fair market value of the plans' net assets which fluctuate with market 
conditions to an estimated projected benefit obligation which is heavily dependent upon the ability to forecast future events 
should be cautiously viewed."" (Emphasis added.)"

578,79," Sufficient capital may have been supplied by ratepayers during the 1984 test year from advance payment of monthly 
telephone bills, customer deposits, and the like, particularly when coupled with post-payment of most accounts payable to create 
a negative working capital situation. This may account for SWBT's failure to carry out the lag-time study ordered by the 
Commission's Order No. 250987, Cause No. 28002 (Dec. 29, 1983). Whether there should be a negative working capital 
allowance cannot be determined without a lag-time study. Certainly no working capital amount should be allowed until the 
Commission's order is complied with. Beyond this it would seem that the Commission must take appropriate action to see that 
the order is complied with including the potential of a negative working capital allowance after an appropriate investigation. It follows, therefore, that it was error to include $ 18 million in ""prepayments"" in the rate base. Not only was there no justifying 
lag-time study but the identity of the ""prepayment"" item remained a mystery, evidence of its legitimacy is absent and its 
allowance was specifically denied prior to its inclusion in the rate base ""summary."" "
579,80," In its December 29, 1983, order, the Commission said that it ""takes judicial notice, as did the Referee, that the use of flow 
through with accelerated depreciation would result in Southwestern Bell possibly losing its right to claim accelerated depreciation 
and being liable for back taxes since it first elected to use accelerated depreciation. Likewise, if Southwestern Bell treated 
investment tax credit (ITC) as a reduction to rate base, it would result in its possible loss of its right to claim ITC."" See Okl. Corp. 
Comm'n Order No. 250987, Cause No. 28002 at 10, 11 (December 29, 1983). Since then there have been some significant decisions relating to the problem. One is that the United States Supreme Court has 
rejected the FCC's earlier position that the exercise of its authority under the Communications Act of 1934 as amended, for 
interstate ratemaking purposes, preempted state regulatory action with regard to plant used interchangeably to provide both 
intrastate and interstate service. This includes regulations with respect to depreciation.  47 U.S.C. §§ 152(b), 220; Louisiana 
Pub. Serv. Comm'n v. F.C.C., 476 U.S. 355, 106 S. Ct. 1890, 90 L. Ed. 2d 369 (1986). In 1986 the supreme court of New Mexico held that a regulatory commission order employing the ""flow-through"" method of 
calculating state income taxes was not an arbitrary and capricious departure from past practice and that use of the 
""normalization"" method was a reasonable means of protecting ratepayers from future problems associated with divestiture of the 
parent company.  In re Rates & Charges of Mountain States Tel. & Tel. Co., 104 N.M. 36, 715 P.2d 1332 (1986). See also, Majoros, Telephone Company Deferred Taxes and Investment Tax Credits -- a Capital Loss for Ratepayers, Public

579,81," It should be noted that one of the few states to hold that income taxes are to be considered an operating expense for the 
purpose of determining fair telephone service rates and charges is Kansas. It so held in State ex rel. Hopkins v. Southwestern 
Bell Tel. Co., 115 Kan. 236,    , 223 P. 771, 781 (1924), after noting that considering ""Federal income tax as an operating 
expense is a matter of controversy. That the tax was disallowed by the commissioner, . . . . but under a recent decision of the 
United States Supreme Court in Galveston Elec. Co. v. City of Galveston, 258 U.S. 388, 399, 42 S. Ct. 351, 356, 66 L. Ed. 678 
(1922), the tax should have been allowed."" Galveston Elec. Co. is of no precedential value, or at least is not binding because it was a pre-Erie Railroad diversity suit filed in 
a Texas federal court. The trial court disallowed the income tax items as an operating expense. The basis for the high court's 
conclusion was that there ""is no difference between income taxes and others,"" a conclusion that is at war with reality. The only other decision to follow the Kansas case is a second Kansas case decided the same year, 1924, on the basis of stare 
decisis. It was Swaller v. Williamson Milling Co., 116 Kan. 329, 226 P. 1001 (1924). It evidently was in the appellate pipeline 
when State ex rel. Hopkins v. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. was decided. It is interesting to note that in Swaller an outside auditor 
examined the milling company's books to determine net income and in so doing did not include income taxes as an operating 
expense. Both the referee and the district court agreed with the auditor. A few states, including Oklahoma in Oklahoma Natural Gas Co. v. Corp. Comm'n, 90 Okl. 84, 216 P. 917 (1923), accepted the 
Galveston Elec. Co. conclusion during the pre-Erie era, noting that it was based upon the particular federal income tax laws 
concerning dividends in effect at that time. Maybe they did so feeling it was necessary as a practical matter because of stare 
decisis. This court should now make a post-Erie reappraisal of the matter and adopt the better and more realistic view that there 
is an obvious difference between operating expense and a post-operational tax on net income. It simply is not fair for the 
ratepayers of this state to be paying SWBC's income taxes or those of its stockholders. In my opinion the high court's 1922 common law view of what state substantive law should be -- that there is no difference 
between taxes paid in the course of operations, such as sale taxes, production taxes, various excise taxes, and the like paid 
during the taxable year, and post-operational taxes such as that levied on net income -- is not the better view and does not 
accord with generally accepted accounting principles. I would hold that income taxes may not be deducted as operating 
expense. "

599,26," A study of the cost and revenue relationship of broad categories of service for a prior calendar year.  The total of these 
categories includes all services provided by Southwestern Bell. direct costs = those costs which can be identified as being caused directly by provision of services within a specific 
category.  If the service had not been provided then these costs would not have been incurred. Network access = costs associated with providing access into ""the network."" This access into the network may be used 
either for local exchange service or for state or interstate message telephone service. It is economically inappropriate to 
recover these non-traffic sensitive costs through usage sensitive rates. common costs = costs which are not direct costs since they are not directly assignable to the provision of any specific group 
of products or services.  They are corporate overhead costs and as such cannot be assigned on a cost-causative basis. "
600,," Embedded Direct Analysis (EDA) assigns ""booked"" costs and revenues to the various service categories.  This enables the 
EDA to balance the books and records of the company.  Therefore for study purposes, a calendar year is chosen since 
year-end reports are available, year-end accruals are included, and clearing accounts are closed. EDA is an account-by-account analysis of operating revenues, plant investments and all expenses, wages, and capital 
costs, so that total costs equal total revenues.  The advantage of this approach is that the total result ""closes to the books"", 
that is, the EDA results are consistent with accounting and financial reports.  The revenues associated with each category 
are first identified and quantified.  Then the operating expenses taxes, and return are assigned to the various service 
categories on a cost-causative basis.  The basis for the cost assignments fall into one of the following categories: Direct 
Assignments; Investment Related; Wage or Other Cost Related; Work Unit Related; and Special Studies.  EDA DEALS 
WITH OVERALL ACCOUNTS AND IS NOT INTENDED TO SHOW REVENUE AND COSTS BY INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS 
OR SERVICE. EDA divides operating revenues into three broad categories: Local Service Revenues; Toll Service Revenues; and 
Miscellaneous Revenues.  Total Operating Revenues is the sum of these three less Total Uncollectible Operating 
Revenues.  (The individual sources are not directly identifiable.) EDA, however, has a separate logic for analyzing investments and costs.  Many costs (such as taxes, depreciation and 
return) are assigned on the basis of the related investment.  EDA assigns the fixed assets of the firm to the service 
categories -- the related investments follow.  Division of revenues is therefore difficult to ascertain.  Where a cost item can 
be attributed to several services, a cost ""factor"" is used to ""split"" the cost.  This results in near-impossibility in tracking 
investments and costs in the absence of the accounting working papers.  THIS CAN ELIMINATE COST/REVENUE 
RELATIONSHIP EFFECTIVELY. supplemental services = additional services over and above that required for basic residence exchange service.  The 
majority of costs in the category are associated with providing Touch-Tone and Custom Calling Services. Common to Firm = costs which are common to all categories and which, purportedly, are not directly assignable to specific 
services on a cost-causative basis.  Executive, Legal, Financial, and Personnel expenses are included.  This is 
impermissibly non-specific and involves cost averaging among various services, having little clarity as to the cost/revenue 
relationship. ""hot wire"" or ""pair-mile"" = the term ""hot wire"" fill factor is based on the relationship of pair miles producing revenue to total 
pair miles in plant.  Fair miles in plant per subscriber loop is based on the relationship of subscriber pair miles in plant to 
subscriber working pairs."

per se illegal; non-price restraints are subject to the rule of reason. Judge Easterbrook's inquiry under the rule of reason 
apparently reflects his hope that the Supreme Court will do away with the per se rule entirely, and subject all concerted restraints 
of trade to rule of reason analysis. See Illinois Corporate Travel, Inc. v. American Airlines, Inc., 806 F.2d at 730-31 (Flaum, J., 
concurring in the judgment). But it in no way negates McTravel's burden to establish a concerted restraint of trade in the first 
place -- the critical issue in the defendants' motions for summary judgment on all three claims. (In Business Electronics Corp. v.

plaintiff's competitors, followed by action on the part of the manufacturer, were insufficient to establish the existence of an 
agreement between the competitors and the manufacturer. Id. at 763. The Court did not say that, once such an agreement is 
shown, a complaint is insufficient to establish that the manufacturer's subsequent action against the plaintiff resulted from the 
agreement. On the contrary, the existence of an agreement followed by a complaint will always, or almost always, be enough to

obvious. See Harkins Amusement Enters., Inc. v. General Cinema Corp., 850 F.2d 477, 486 (9th Cir. 1988). Moreover, the 
Supreme Court has counseled against enlarging the ""'boycott' pigeon hole"" by invoking the per se rule. See F.T.C. v. Indiana 
Fed'n of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 458 (1986). We decline the invitation to invoke per se analysis in this case. "
649,2," In a related argument, St. Peter's complains that the instruction on the factors the jury should consider in balancing the benefits 
of the restraint against the detrimental effects inadequately described the weight the jury should assign to the short-term duration 
of the exclusive contract. St. Peter's failed to preserve this matter for appeal by objecting to the instruction before the jury retired 
for deliberations. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 51. Accordingly, we do not address it. "
661,1," Compare, HN4[
]  15 U.S.C. § 15 (Sherman Act venue section providing ""Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor in any district court . . . in which the defendant 
resides or is found or has an agent, without respect to the amount in controversy . . ."") and 15 U.S.C. § 22 (antitrust venue 
statute providing for suit against corporate defendants with same substantive breadth of venue as Section 15) with 28 U.S.C. § 
1391 (general venue statute for federal court restricting venue to judicial districts where, broadly, parties to the suit reside or are 
incorporated or are licensed to do business or in which the claim arose.) "
669,1, Defendant contests many of these allegations. 
686,1," Plaintiff's eight claims are termed "" Causes of Action."" They will be referred to as ""Counts"" herein."
686,2," As explained hereinafter, there are now only three Counts before the Court. Counts 2 and 3 actually raise a single claim under 
§ 1 of the Sherman Act, charging a conspiracy by the defendants to impose territorial restrictions on plaintiff in unlawful restraint 
of trade. Moreover, with the dismissal of defendants KKR and Beatrice, plaintiff cannot assert a Clayton Act claim. See 15 
U.S.C. § 18. "
687,3," The words ""terminate"" and ""terminated,"" which have been used frequently by counsel for plaintiff in their briefs and arguments, 
appear to be misnomers. There was never any distribution or other agreement between plaintiff and defendants which might 
have been subject to termination."
687,4," Plaintiff Purity continues to sell other juice and beverage products, as well as some Tropicana products purchased from firms 
other than defendants."
687,5," Tropicana Products does use a food broker, the Deblinger Co., to assist in the distribution of its frozen concentrate products in 
the New York metropolitan area."
687,6," According to defendants' memorandum in support of the pending motion, the A.C. Nielsen Company compiles statistical 
measures of product sales which are broken down by region. These regions are called ""Nielsen territories."""
687,7," Defendants assert that in addition to their concern about quality control, they were aware of Purity's misuse of promotional 
monies.  Defendants in their memoranda have outlined an alleged scheme by which plaintiff bought Tropicana products in 
Virginia for less than it could in Maryland under a shell corporation and then immediately offered these goods for sale in various 
East Coast cities, including New York City. It is not necessary for the Court to resolve this dispute since it is apparent that the 
essential reason for defendants' refusal to deal with plaintiff as a distributor was its insistence that it had the right to make sales 
in the New York metropolitan area. "
690,8," Mr. Goldstein took the position that he would sell Tropicana products ""any place he could make a buck."""
690,9," As Circuit Judge Murnaghan pointed out in Ottensmeyer v. Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Co., 756 F.2d 986, 992 (4th 
Cir. 1985), when antitrust allegations ""are simply thrown in as a shotgun approach for relief, we have granted a defendant's 
motion for summary judgment."" "
691,10," Defendants have presented forceful arguments that they did not have the necessary market power over the product in a 
defined geographic area to unreasonably restrain trade. They also assert that plaintiff cannot prove injury to interbrand 
competition. See Continental T.V. Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 52 n.19, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568, 97 S. Ct. 2549 (1976). In 
view of the Court's conclusion that no § 1 conspiracy can be proved, it is not necessary to address these further questions."
691,11," It is settled now that HN11[
] a corporation cannot conspire with its own officers or employees nor with a wholly owned 
subsidiary.  Copperweld Corp.  v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 769, 771, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628, 104 S. Ct. 2731 (1984). "
692,," However, independent brokers may under certain circumstances be co-conspirators within the meaning of § 1 of the Sherman 
Act. See Pink Supply Corp. v. Hiebert, Inc., 788 F.2d 1313, 1316 (8th Cir. 1986)."
692,12," The cases relied upon by defendants all addressed the question of a plaintiff's proper identification of co-conspirators in the 
context of a motion to dismiss for lack of specific allegation of the identities in question. See, e.g., Lombard's, Inc. v. Prince 
Manufacturing, Inc., 753 F.2d 974, 975 (11th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1082, 88 L. Ed. 2d 892, 106 S. Ct. 851 (1986). "
693,13," According to plaintiff, a marketing committee consisting of route distributors and Citrus Bowl management was established to 
discuss, among other topics, the sale of Tropicana products diverted from other territories. However, the so-called Diversion 
Task Force was formed after defendants stopped doing business with plaintiff."
693,14," In his letter, Mr. Maggard pointed out that Tropicana products were perishable and suffered quality degradation if improperly 
shipped and stored and that defendants did not want their products to undergo handling when not under defendants' control or 
knowledge. "
694,15," Even evidence that one distributor has solicited the replacement by a manufacturer of an existing distributor has been held not 
to constitute a § 1 violation.  Universal Lite Distributors, Inc. v. Northwest Industries, Inc., 452 F. Supp. 1206, 1216 (D. Md. 
1978), aff'd in pertinent part, 602 F.2d 1173, 1175 (4th Cir. 1979). "
695,16," Moreover, HN14[
] under Maryland law, one who, regardless of motive, causes harm to another merely by refusing to 
continue a business relationship terminable at will is not liable for that harm.  Cunningham v. A.S. Abell Company, 264 Md. 649, 
658, 288 A.2d 157, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 865, 34 L. Ed. 2d 114, 93 S. Ct. 160 (1972). "
700,*," Citizens believes that its victory at trial in state court renders the Village's request for a preliminary injunction moot. It does not. 
The district court could enjoin the ongoing state proceedings (now on appeal) and block execution of the judgment. The 
injunction in Vendo forbade implementation of a final judgment rendered by the state court. The dispute between the parties is 
live, even with respect to the request for preliminary injunctive relief. "
710,1," In both complaints Thomason also asserted a cause of action for failure to pay accrued salary, commissions and bonuses. 
Because the pending motions do not address this cause of action, the Court's order does not affect the claims raised therein. "
713,2," Busbin was followed recently in two wrongful discharge cases decided by the Georgia Court of Appeals. See Gibson v. Winn-
Dixie Atlanta, Inc., 183 Ga. App. 192, 358 S.E.2d 320 (1987) (communication of false reason for termination does not create 
cause of action for wrongful discharge); Garmon v. Health Group of Atlanta, Inc., 183 Ga. App. 587, 359 S.E.2d 450 (1987) 
(failure to follow hospital procedures regarding discipline and termination does not create cause of action for wrongful 
discharge)."
713,3," To prevail on his cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, Thomason will need to show that he suffered 
because of conduct by the defendants that goes beyond the mere fact of his termination. No matter how much pain plaintiff 
experienced, Mitsubishi's decision to fire him, without more, is insufficient to support a cause of action for intentional infliction of 
emotional distress in light of Busbin and its progeny."
713,4," In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir. 1981), the Eleventh Circuit adopted as binding precedent all cases 
decided by the Fifth Circuit before September 30, 1981. "
714,5," Because an antitrust plaintiff must suffer direct antitrust injury, ""neither an officer nor an employee of a corporation has standing 
to bring an action in his own right for an antitrust violation causing injury to the corporation and its business."" National 
Independent Theatre Exhibitors, Inc. v. Buena Vista Distribution Co., 748 F.2d 602, 608 (11th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 
1013, 88 L. Ed. 2d 473, 106 S. Ct. 544 (1985) (citations omitted). "
715,6," Thomason does not claim antitrust injury based on lost sales commissions or other diminution of his ability to serve effectively 
as a sales representative in the affected market. Thomason would face difficulty proving such injury because, as a Mitsubishi 
sales manager, any lessening of competition favoring Mitsubishi would produce corresponding gains for Thomason. See Winther 
v. DEC International, Inc., 625 F. Supp. 100 (D.  Colo. 1985) (discharged salesman not within area of economy endangered by 
breakdown of anticompetitive conditions when salesman probably benefited from alleged antitrust violations)."
715,7," The Donahue decision has been criticized for failing to recognize that ""no useful policy is served by granting standing to a 
terminated employee for a product market violation that is known to others."" P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law: An 
Analysis of Antitrust Principles and Their Application, para. 338d (Supp. 1987). Areeda and Hovenkamp argue that dealers 
restrained by a resale price maintenance scheme will know of the violation and have an incentive to sue. The same criticism 
would apply if the Court were to grant standing here. "
724,1," The analysis of whether a municipality of Wisconsin enjoys immunity from state antitrust laws thus differs from the analysis of 
whether the municipality would enjoy similar immunity from federal antitrust laws. The doctrine of state immunity from federal 
antitrust regulation was first recognized in Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341 (1943). It rests on ""general principles of federalism 
involving the relationship of the federal government to the sovereign states, and on the specific constitutional limits on federal 
power contained in the tenth and eleventh amendments."" Town of Hallie, 105 Wis. 2d at 537, 314 N.W.2d at 324. See also 324 
Liquor Corp. v. Duffy, 479 U.S. 335, 343 (1987). Municipalities are immune from federal antitrust regulation only if the challenged 
action is ""'one clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy'"" and that policy is ""'actively supervised' by the State 
itself."" Duffy, 479 U.S. at 343. Municipalities in Wisconsin thus have broader immunity from state antitrust regulation than they do 
from federal antitrust regulation. HN8[

724,2," Provisions of the General Charter Law, secs. 62.01 through 62.26, Stats., are not, with exceptions not relevant here, applicable

726,4," The trial court dismissed the antitrust claim against the ambulance companies on two grounds.  First, it held that they were 
protected from antitrust liability ""because they did nothing more than apply under that program and were successful enough in 
their program to receive certain primary designation in specific geographical districts."" Second, it held that the ambulance 
companies were protected by the doctrine that has emerged from Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor 
Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127 (1961), and United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657 (1965), which recognizes that groups 
with common interests may petition government and seek legal redress in the courts and in administrative agencies without 
incurring antitrust liability.  See California Motor Transp. Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508, 510-511 (1972). In light of our 
resolution of the antitrust claim against the ambulance companies, we need not discuss whether the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, 
which protects advocacy and not participation, see In re Airport Car Rental Antitrust Litig., 521 F. Supp. 568, 584 (N.D. Cal. 
1981, aff'd, 693 F.2d 84 (9th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 462 U.S. 1133 (1983), applies under these circumstances or whether it is 
an affirmative defense that must be pleaded.  See Rule 802.06(2). "
731,1," This section substantially incorporates the statement of facts contained in the Court's May 27, 1988 order."
731,2," It was originally contemplated that Mirviss and Nelson would be part of a small group of partners investing in the Minneapolis 
property.  Affidavit of Arthur Nelson par. 2. Ultimately, neither Mirviss nor Nelson participated as an investor in the purchase of 
the Minneapolis property.  Nelson Aff. par. 10; Affidavit of Lewis Mirviss par. 15."
731,3," The bank disputes this characterization of the circumstances surrounding its offer of credit. The bank claims that Nelson 
proposed the structure of the transaction and further contends that plaintiffs never asked the bank to finance only the purchase 
of the Minneapolis property.  The bank asserts that it never refused to finance only the purchase of the Minneapolis property 
without simultaneous purchase of the Glencoe property. "
732,4," 12 U.S.C. § 1972(1) provides in relevant part: (1) A bank shall not in any manner extend credit, lease or sell property of any kind, or furnish any service, or fix or vary the 
consideration for any of the foregoing, on the condition or requirement -- (A) that the customer shall obtain some additional credit, property, or service from such bank other than a loan, discount, 
deposit, or trust service[.] "
733,5," This claim represents the basis for the Court's exercise of subject matter jurisdiction, which plaintiffs invoke pursuant to 28 
U.S.C. § 1331 and the principles of pendent jurisdiction. No diversity exists among the parties. "
734,6," HN2[
] A tie-in arrangement has been defined as ""an agreement . . . to sell one product [the tying product] but only on the 
condition that the buyer also purchases a different . . . product [the tied product], or at least agrees that he will not purchase the 
product from any other supplier."" Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5-6, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545, 78 S. Ct. 514 
(1958)."
734,7," Title HN3[
]  12 U.S.C. § 1975 provides: Any person who is injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in section 1972 of this title may sue 
therefor in any district court of the United States in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, without regard 
to the amount in controversy, and shall be entitled to recover three times the amount of the damages sustained by him, and 
the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee."
734,8," In order to establish an unlawful tying under the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1, a plaintiff must prove that the party imposing the 
tying arrangement had sufficient economic power with respect to the tying product so as to appreciably restrain free competition "
735,," in the market for the tied product.  Fortner Enterprises, Inc. v. United States Steel Corp., 394 U.S. 495, 499, 22 L. Ed. 2d 495, 89 
S. Ct. 1252 (1969); see also Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2, 104 S. Ct. 1551 (1984). "
736,9," The only Eighth Circuit case to review 12 U.S.C. § 1972 does not reach a contrary conclusion. In Duryea v. Third Northwestern 
National Bank of Minneapolis, 606 F.2d 823 (8th Cir. 1979), the court did not reach the issue of whether a plaintiff proceeding 
pursuant to 12 U.S.C. § 1972 must show anti-competitive effect. The court in Duryea found that plaintiff had failed to allege any 
type of tying arrangement prohibited by section 1972.  Duryea, 606 F.2d at 826. Thus the court, noting generally that the BHCA 
prohibits ""anti-competitive practices which require bank customers to accept or provide some other service or product . . . in 
order to obtain the bank product or service they desire,"" affirmed dismissal of plaintiff's BHCA claim.  Duryea, 606 F.2d at 825-
26, quoting 1970 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News 5519, 5535. The court did not analyze whether a plaintiff must prove anti-
competitive effect in order to prevail under 12 U.S.C. § 1972(1)(A). "
743,1," The court arrived at this figure by multiplying the number of entries Mr. Antonow rounded to the nearest 1/2 hour (83) by the 
average error (.25 hours)."
743,2," Likewise, the secondary trial attorneys should bill their time at $ 150 per hour or less and any other non-trial staff on the case

removed by . . . the defendants, to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place where 
such action is pending. "
755,1," See Brandenburg v. Md. Savings & Loan Depositors Comm., 859 F.2d 1179 (4th Cir. 1988); Crotty v. City of Chicago Heights, 
857 F.2d 1170, 1172 n.6 (7th Cir. 1988)(""We have expressed doubt that federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over RICO

562 (5th Cir. 1987)(RICO claims can ""probably"" be brought in state court)."
755,2," Cf.  Lane v. Central Bank of Alabama, 756 F.2d 814, 817 (11th Cir. 1985)(even though Bank Holding Co. Act contains treble 
damages provision which was seen as a ""supplement to the antitrust laws,"" state courts were found to have concurrent 
jurisdiction)."
755,3," In Sedima, the RICO defendants argued that ""just as a Clayton Act plaintiff must allege an 'antitrust injury,' so a RICO plaintiff 
must allege a 'racketeering injury,'"" Sedima, 473 U.S. at 485. The Supreme Court rejected this contention, stating that borrowing 
from antitrust principles would ""create [] exactly the problems Congress sought to avoid."" Id. at 498-99."
755,4," Various statements made on the floor of the Senate support this position. Senator Hruska rejected antitrust standing parallels 
and called for a broad interpretation of RICO. See 115 Cong. Rec. 6992 (1969). Senator McClellan similarly noted ""there is . . . 
no intention here of importing the great complexity of antitrust law enforcement into this field."" Id. at 9567. See also 116 Cong. 
Rec. 607 (1970)(statement of Sen. Byrd). "
756,5," The Supreme Court's analysis in McMahon is instructive. The court specifically decided that there was no ""irreconcilable 
conflict between arbitration and RICO's underlying purposes."" 107 S. Ct. at 2344. Since no conflict exists between arbitration 
and RICO's purposes, the majority must bear a heavy burden to show why there is such conflict between state court jurisdiction 
and RICO. "
757,6," The Nordlicht court relied on the Supreme Court's decisions in Pan American Petroleum Corp. v. Superior Court, 366 U.S. 656, 
665-66, 6 L. Ed. 2d 584, 81 S. Ct. 1303 (1961) and Great Northern Railway Co. v. Merchants' Elevator Co., 259 U.S. 285, 290-

758,9," Hathorn, 102 S. Ct. at 2430. "
760,1," At oral argument, counsel for plaintiff represented to the court that Count 4 of the Third Amended Complaint which had alleged 
violations of the Franchise Practices Act, N. J. Stat. Ann. 56:10-1 - 56:10-15 (West 1964 & Supp 1988), and the various contract 
claims were being withdrawn. "
763,2," Counsel for plaintiff has argued that New York law should apply to the analysis of a joint venture. Regardless of whether this 
court applies New York or New Jersey law, the joint venture claim must fail for the reasons stated above."
763,3," At oral argument, there appeared to be some confusion as to whether the dealer agreement was signed for 1983. For the 
purposes of this motion, however, it is irrelevant as to whether an agreement was signed in 1983.  The agreements signed in 
1981 and 1982 contain language merging all other agreements. "
771,1," In New York Airlines, Inc. v. Dukes County, 623 F. Supp. 1435, 1446-47 (D.Mass. 1985), this court found, after detailed 
analysis, that 49 U.S.C. Appx. § 2210 established a privately enforcible right for which 18 U.S.C. § 1983 provided a remedy. This 
decision was followed in earlier stages of this litigation. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit subsequently decided in 
Interface that a private party does not have a right of action or remedy for an alleged violation of § 2210. Although this court's 
analysis of this issue in New York Airlines was not addressed, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit was evidently aware of 
the decision, citing it for other purposes. See, 816 F.2d at 12 and 14. In any event, this court is plainly bound to follow the 
decision of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit on this question. "
774,2," 15 U.S.C. § 15(b) provides the following: Any action to enforce any cause of action under section 4, 4A or 4C [15 U.S.C. §§ 15, 15a, 15c] shall be forever barred unless 
commenced within four years after the cause of action accrued. "
788,1," MSAs are metropolitan areas defined by the United States Department of Commerce. The Indianapolis MSA consists of Marion 
County and its seven contiguous counties. Kroger agrees that the Indianapolis MSA is the relevant geographic market."
788,2," Indiana Grocery's definition of the relevant product market excluded numerous small markets and convenience stores 
operating in the Indianapolis area. "
789,3," Section 2 of the Sherman Act provides in pertinent part that ""every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize . . . 
any part of the trade or commerce among the several states, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony."" 15 
U.S.C. § 2."
789,4," The Sherman Act distinguishes between concerted and independent action.  Copperweld, 467 U.S. at 767. In contrast to 
Section 2, Section 1 of the Act proscribes unreasonable restraints of trade effected by contracts, combinations, or conspiracies 
between separate entities, even when those agreements do not threaten actual monopolization. Id. This is because ""concerted 
activity inherently is fraught with anticompetitive risk. It deprives the market place of the independent centers of decision-making 
that competition assumes and demands. . . . Of course, such mergings of resources may well lead to efficiencies that benefit 
consumers, but their anticompetitive potential is sufficient to warrant scrutiny even in the absence of incipient monopoly. Id. at 
768-69. "
793,5," Under section 16 of the Clayton Act, private parties threatened with loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws may 
seek injunctive relief.  15 U.S.C. § 26. "
795,6," Apparently it is easy to confuse this point. It is tempting when performing an antitrust injury analysis to look first at the 
substantive antitrust provision the defendant allegedly has violated, to note next the harmful effects on competition the 
substantive provision is designed to prevent, to note further that some of those harmful effects might fall on parties such as the 
plaintiff, and to conclude, therefore, that the plaintiff should have standing to vindicate the substantive antitrust provision the 
defendant allegedly has violated. For example, both Indiana Grocery and the Ninth Circuit in USA Petroleum emphasize first that 
maximum price-fixing agreements remain illegal-indeed, illegal per se-under section 1 of the Sherman Act after the Supreme 
Court's recent decision in Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Society, 457 U.S. 332, 73 L. Ed. 2d 48, 102 S. Ct. 2466 (1982). 
Indiana Grocery next argues that because the Court in Maricopa County was concerned about the effects of fixed maximum 
prices on existing or potential competitors, see id. at 348, its claims in this case ""coincide with the very reasons maximum price 
fixing is illegal"" and ""consequently, under the Brunswick test, [it] has standing to assert [its] claims."" Similarly, the Ninth Circuit, 
after finding that the per se rules against price fixing were ""intended to give entrepreneurs and independent distributors an 'even 
playing field,'"" concluded that the purpose and policies of the antitrust laws are best effectuated by recognizing the ""standing"" of competitors to enforce 
the antitrust laws against price-fixing conspiracies. To put the same point differently, we conclude that the injury done to the 
market and to competitors by price fixing is antitrust injury-the type of injury the antitrust laws were meant to protect.  USA Petroleum, 859 F.2d at 697. In our view, both the Indiana Grocery and the Ninth Circuit approaches stand the antitrust 
injury inquiry on its head. "
800,1," The Florida Antitrust Act, Fla. Stat. § 542.01 et seq., was patterned after the Sherman Act, and was intended to complement 
and follow the federal court interpretations of the Sherman Act. Auton v. Dade City, Fla., 783 F.2d 1009, 1010 n. 1 (11th Cir. 
1986). The parties have recognized this in § 8 of the Pretrial Stipulation. Accordingly, the Court's ruling on Counts I, III, and V of 
the Third Amended Complaint, based on the Sherman Act, will apply as well to Counts II, IV, and VI of the Third Amended 
Complaint, which assert parallel, corresponding charges under the Florida Antitrust Act, Fla. Stat. §§ 542.18 and 542.19."
800,2," The Court entered an Order on April 6, 1988, which set August 1, 1988, as the last day for Court supervised discovery. "
803,3," The statutory guidance is similar to one of the general Wisconsin statutes which the Supreme Court discussed in Town of 
Hallie, 471 U.S. at 42 n. 5. "
810,*," The Honorable Raymond J. Dearie, United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, sitting by designation. "
824,1," In the case at bar, the Attorney General says Judge Sand is wrong. I think he is right. "
825,2," The Attorney General cites a number of cases for the proposition that FTC consent orders are construed as contracts. United 
States v. ITT Continental Baking Co., 420 U.S. 223, 238, 43 L. Ed. 2d 148, 95 S. Ct. 926 (1975); United States v. Armour Co., 
402 U.S. 673, 681-82, 29 L. Ed. 2d 256, 91 S. Ct. 1752 (1971); May Dept. Stores Co. v. First Hartford Corp., 435 F. Supp. 849, 
852-53 (D.Conn. 1977). These cases considered, in differing contexts, whether consent orders had been violated. They did not 
involve the question of preemption, and do not assist in its solution. Indeed, taking the contract analogy to its logical conclusion 
leads the Attorney General into constitutional shoal waters of a different sort. If the consent order at bar be viewed as a 
congressionally authorized contract between the FTC and GM, the Contract Clause of Article I, Section 10, cl. 1 prohibits state 
law from impairing the obligations arising thereunder."
825,3," Chairman Oliver's dissenting statement argues that the preemption issue need not be reached because ""the most reasonable 
interpretation of the Lemon Law is that its requirements do not apply to arbitration of disputes under the Commission's order."" 
Statement at 9. Mr. Oliver contends, with plausible citation to the statutory scheme and New York case law, that the Lemon Law 
is exclusively concerned with rights under written warranties given by the manufacturer, whereas the FTC order is not concerned 
with warranty disputes, but rather with settling charges ""that GM failed to disclose known defects""; a consumer may prevail 
under consent order arbitration, the chairman points out, ""regardless of the existence or terms of any written warranty . . . ."" Ibid. This approach has a surface appeal. Lower courts are cautioned generally to avoid reaching constitutional issues if alternative 
bases for decision lie at hand. See, e.g., Ulster County Court v. Allen, 442 U.S. 140, 154, 60 L. Ed. 2d 777, 99 S. Ct. 2213 
(1979). Furthermore, conflicts between federal and state law are to be avoided if possible: ""the proper approach is to reconcile 
the operation of both statutory schemes with one another rather than holding one completely ousted."" Merrill Lynch, Pierce, "
826,," Fenner & Smith v. Ware, 414 U.S. 117, 127, 38 L. Ed. 2d 348, 94 S. Ct. 383 (1973). But I do not believe that avenue is open 
here. GM did not offer that argument in its initial motion papers, although if sound it would as a practical matter entitle GM to all 
the relief it seeks. Predictably enough, GM expresses agreement with Mr. Oliver in a gratified but conclusory footnote in its brief 
addressing the FTC submissions (at 2 n.3). But I cannot accept the argument for failure of its basic premise: that the Lemon Law 
covers entirely different areas from the consent order, without possibility of overlap. While the initial complaint giving rise to the 
consent order dealt only with ""specified components"" in certain GM engines and vehicles, 102 F.T.C. at 1750, the consent order, 
as Chairman Oliver himself observed, ""was broader than the complaint,"" see p. 1105 supra; deals generally with all GM 
passenger cars or light trucks beginning with the 1984 model year (the FTC decision approving the order was filed November 
16, 1983); and directs GM to ""implement a nationwide third-party arbitration program to settle complaints of individual owners 
relating to powertrain components."" New car warranties traditionally cover powertrain components. Accordingly there is an 
overlap between the arbitration program directed by the consent order, and the arbitration procedures mandated by the Lemon 
Law as amended in 1986. The constitutional issue of preemption cannot be avoided. "
828,4," Judge Sand made the same point in Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association at 737: ""In determining whether the Lemon Law 
'stands as an obstacle' to the full purposes of Magnuson-Moss, HN10[
] it is not enough to say that the ultimate goal of both 
laws is consumer protection. See International Paper v. Ouellette, 479 U.S. 481, 107 S. Ct. 805, 813, 93 L. Ed. 2d 883. A state 
statute is preempted if it interferes with the methods by which Congress sought to achieve its goal."" Id. "
832,1," These defendants will be collectively referred to as ""the defendants."""
832,2," Although the plaintiff had not been contacted by the Venice hospital, VCA contacted the hospital and inquired into the 
possibility of a joint venture. The hospital declined, noting that it had already entered into a joint venture with MPAC. "
833,3," HN1[
] Section 1 of the Sherman Act declares illegal ""every contract, combination . . . or conspiracy, in the restraint of trade or commerce among the several States . . . ."" 15 U.S.C. § 1. Similarly, § 2 outlaws any activity by any ""person who shall 
monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire . . . to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the 
several States . . . ."" 15 U.S.C. § 2."
833,4," Of course, under § 1 (as opposed to § 2), it is not necessary to show that the concerted activity threatens monopolization. See 
Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. at 758. Nonetheless, there must be some unreasonable anti-
competitive, exclusionary or coercive type conduct (i.e. some restraint of trade) present before a § 1 violation may be found.  
Standard Oil v. United States, 221 U.S. at 55-64 (1911). "
835,5," See supra, p. 1517 (discussion of home health nurses' autonomy)."
835,6," Indeed, the evidence indicated that plaintiffs did not even attempt to pursue other competitive options before filing this lawsuit. 
Plaintiffs did not seek to attract more walk-in customers by relocating their store, which was then located behind a dumpster and 
next to a bar. Nor did plaintiffs shift their marketing focus to nursing homes or physicians and physical therapists. Instead, 
plaintiffs passively waited for the telephone to ring, and when it did not, they were content to compete in the courtroom instead of 
the marketplace. "
836,7," The brochure also indicates that the defendants did not refuse to deal with the plaintiff; such a refusal is another indicator of 
unlawful exclusionary or restrictive behavior not present here. See, e.g., Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 
U.S. at 602-03; Lorain Journal Co. v. United States, 342 U.S. 143, 96 L. Ed. 162, 72 S. Ct. 181 (1951)."
836,8," Although a § 2 conspiracy to monopolize claim does not require the showing of any affirmative antitrust behavior, see United 
States v. Griffith, 334 U.S. at 106-07 & n.9; 3 J. von Kalinowski, Antitrust Laws and Regulation, § 9.02(1)a (1981), such behavior 
was the only evidence plaintiffs offered in support of their conspiracy to monopolize claim. Because the Court has found above 
that the defendants' behavior did not violate the antitrust laws, the plaintiffs' § 2 conspiracy to monopolize claim must also fail. "
842,1," The USFL is currently represented by the law firm of Myerson & Kuhn, which is pursuing this fee application. The USFL was 
represented at trial by the now dissolved firm of Finley, Kumble, Wagner, Heine, Underberg, Manley, Myerson & Casey (""Finley 
Kumble""). Harvey D. Myerson, Esq., was lead counsel for plaintiffs at trial, and has personal knowledge of the billing matters at 
issue in this petition. At the filing of the application, current USFL counsel no longer had access to the computers where the Finley Kumble billing 
information was stored. Segall Affidavit para. 5. Additionally, records for work done for the USFL on this case by the law firm of 
Spenglar Carlson Gubar Brodsky & Frischling (""Spenglar Carlson"") just prior to this petition were not available. Segall Affidavit 
para. 19. Those actual records are now submitted as Exhibit D, attached to Segall Affidavit. "
843,2," See, e.g., Exhibit B to Segall Affidavit. That document is a petition for statutory fees submitted in an unrelated case by Davis 
Polk & Wardell, one of the law firms currently representing the NFL. That submission, for which full compensation was awarded, 
is substantially similar in detail to the one submitted by the USFL here. "
844,3," Other § 1988 cases cited by the NFL include, e.g., Martin v. Heckler, 773 F.2d 1145 (11th Cir. 1985); New York City 
Unemployed & Welfare Council v. Brezenoff, 742 F.2d 718 (2d Cir. 1984); Kentucky Ass'n for Retarded Citizens, Inc. v. Conn., 
718 F.2d 182 (6th Cir. 1983). The NFL also relies on cases under other discretionary fee awards provisions, similar in this respect to the Civil Rights Attorneys 
Fees Award Act of 1976. E.g., Counsel v. Dow, 849 F.2d 731 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 955, 109 S. Ct. 391, 102 L. Ed. 2d 
380 (1988) (Handicapped Children's Protection Act of 1986, 20 U.S.C. § 1415(e)(4)(b)); Martin v. Heckler, 773 F.2d 1145 (11th 
Cir. 1985) (Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2412)."
844,4," The benefits achieved by the litigation are not, of course, irrelevant in mandatory fee award schemes. Such concerns may have 
significant effect upon the determination of what a ""reasonable"" fee is. See, e.g., City of Riverside v. Rivera, 477 U.S. 561, 91 L. 
Ed. 2d 466, 106 S. Ct. 2686 (1986). See also, Part 3 below. "
845,5," A similar and corollary assertion is that an action where substantial damages are not proved is, in effect, a ""declaratory 
judgment,"" and therefore does not support attorneys' fees. See, e.g., Allen-Bradley Co. v. Local Union No. 3, 51 F. Supp. 36, 40 
(S.D.N.Y. 1943), rev'd, 145 F.2d 215 (2d Cir. 1944), rev'd, 325 U.S. 797, 89 L. Ed. 1939, 65 S. Ct. 1533 (1945)."
845,6," The cases that the NFL cites for this view do not stand for the proposition that some level of damages are required, but merely 
that an award of attorneys' fees is not proper where no injury is shown. E.g., Alden-Rochelle, Inc. v. ASCAP, 80 F. Supp. 888, 
899-900 (S.D.N.Y. 1948) (""plaintiffs have not shown any injury from defendants' violations of the antitrust laws"") (emphasis 
added)."
845,7," By only putting on television damage evidence, the USFL did not in some way ""make a deliberate choice"" to forgo its Clayton 
Act remedy, as the NFL claims. In Kelco Disposal, Inc. v. Browning-Ferris Indus. of Vermont, Inc., 845 F.2d 404 (2d Cir. 1988), 
cited by the NFL for this proposition, the plaintiff pursued state law remedies after establishing an antitrust violation, and "
846,," therefore could not get fees under the federal fee shifting statute. The USFL here is most definitely pursuing its federal remedy, 
including counsel fees."
846,8," This Court cited record proof set out in the USFL's Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Judgment 
Notwithstanding the Verdict, at pp. 5-14. That proof included extensive television-related evidence."
846,9," The NFL's general objection to fees charged for ""injunctive relief"" is misleading. No time spent on post-trial injunctive motions is 
being claimed. Affidavit of Harvey D. Myerson, Esq., sworn to on May 2, 1988 (""Myerson Affidavit""), para. 10. The few 
references to injunctive relief occur in preliminary stages of the litigation, when various alternative relief was legitimately being 
explored. "
848,10," McCann v. Coughlin, 698 F.2d 112, 129 (2d Cir. 1983). "
849,11," Certain pre-Reichman cases in this Circuit have properly rejected attempts to recoup expenses billed to clients under the ""cost 
of suit"" provision, but not the attorneys' fee provision, of 15 U.S.C § 15. See, e.g., Berkey Photo, Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 603 
F.2d 263 (2d Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1093, 62 L. Ed. 2d 783, 100 S. Ct. 1061 (1980). The federal costs statute applies 
equally to actions not brought under fee shifting provisions. No problem arises where such expenses are recovered as part of a 
fee shifting statute. As the cases noted above illustrate, the denomination of these billed expenses as recoverable fees is 
eminently sensible, and indicated by the law in this Circuit. The USFL should not be penalized for billing expenses directly, 
instead of raising its hourly rates (which have not been challenged) to cover the expenses as overhead. Again, the standards under civil rights fee provisions and 15 U.S.C. § 15 are the same with respect to the amounts awarded. 
See n. 10, supra. "
850,12," The factors properly considered in determining a reasonable amount of attorneys fees are the same for discretionary schemes 
like § 1988 and mandatory schemes like 15 U.S.C. § 15. McCann v. Coughlin, 698 F.2d 112, 129 (2d Cir. 1983). Those factors 
were set out by Congress and quoted in Hensley, 461 U.S. at 430 n.3. They are:"
850,1, . time and labor required
850,2, . novelty and difficulty of the questions
850,3, . skill required to perform the legal service properly
850,4, . preclusion of attorney's employment due to acceptance of the case
850,5, . customary fee
850,6, . whether fee is fixed or contingent
850,7, . time limitations imposed by client or circumstances
850,8, . amount involved and results obtained
850,9," . experience, reputation and ability of attorneys"
850,10," . ""undesirability"" of the case"
850,11, . nature and length of the professional relationship with the client
850,12, . awards in similar cases. 
851,13," The other cases cited by the NFL do not indicate that a nominal ""reasonable"" fee is mandated in this case. In Muraresku v. 
Amoco Oil, 648 F. Supp. 347 (E.D. Pa. 1986), the fees were requested under a statute, 15 U.S.C. § 2805(d), which explicitly 
authorizes the District Court to deny fees to plaintiffs who only recover nominal damages. Diver v. Goddard Mem. Hospital, 783 
F.2d 6 (1st Cir. 1986), was merely an affirmance of the district court's insubstantial fee award, made after application of Hensley 
factors, including the fact that liability was conceded on the only claim ""prevailed"" upon."
851,14," But see, Richards v. NYC Board of Education, No. 83 Civ. 7621 (S.D.N.Y., June 27, 1988) (Motley, J.). "
852,15," Because the time entries regarding the fee applications do not suffer the same vagueness problems as the records for the 
case in chief, the 10% reduction for those ambiguities will likewise not be deducted from the hours claimed for the fee petition."
852,16," The NFL's general contentions that no fees at all should be rewarded, because the USFL was not a ""prevailing party,"" are also 
asserted with regard to the statutory costs. For the reasons stated in this opinion, see, Part 2. above, those arguments are 
without merit. "
860,1," Keystone pricing is ""understood by all in the apparel trade to mean a markup of 50% of the retail price, or twice the wholesale 
cost."" Plaintiff's Appendix (""App."") at 15 (Aff't of Maer Bunis para. 30) (Sept. 7, 1988)."
860,2," The Profitability Plan, which will be discussed infra at pp. 9-10, is contained in the Pendleton Advantage, a book provided by 
Pendleton to its sales representatives and retailers. The book describes the Pendleton philosophy and offers advice on the best 
way to market Pendleton products. "
861,3," In fact, when Pendleton notified Maer Bunis of The Sample that its account would be terminated, Bunis wrote a note at the top 
of the letter: ""Shall we thank them or fight them?"" The comment reinforces Pendleton's contention that The Sample had been 
less successful than it had anticipated in selling the Pendleton line. Defendant's App. at 61a (Bunis Depos.) (Nov. 30, 1987). Mr. 
Bunis explained that he might have written that comment because The Sample had not been ""as profitable as we would like to 
have been."" Id. at 59a. "
862,4," According to the Second Circuit, HN11[
] to determine whether principal and agent constitute one or two entities, we need to 
examine: whether the agent performs a function on behalf of his principal other than securing an offer from a buyer for the principal's 
product; the degree to which the agent is authorized to exercise his discretion concerning the price and terms under which 
the principal's product is to be sold; and finally whether use of the agent constitutes a separate step in the vertical 
distribution of the principal's product. Id."
862,5," Moreover, The Sample's evidence of complaints is ambiguous at best. There is evidence that complaints were registered with 
Pendleton, but it is unclear about which stores these complaints were made. Madden recalled initially that ""Jenss' complained 
about Sibley's running a three-day coupon sale. And L.L. Berger complained about Sample running a three-day coupon sale."" 
Plaintiff's App. (Madden Depos. 256-57) (Mar. 27, 1987). However, Madden later said in a supplemental affidavit that he was 
actually recalling ""an L.L. Berger complaint about Sibley's, not The Sample."" Defendant's Reply App. at 20sa (Madden Aff't para. 
3) (Oct. 18, 1988). "
863,6," The Sample also asks the Court to infer a conspiracy based upon ""the dramatic rise in the gross margins of cooperating 
retailers the first year the Plan was in effect."" Plaintiff's Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Summary 
Judgment at 35. However, a rise in gross margins is not necessarily the result of a conspiracy. There could be other factors at 
work. This court, just as the court in H.L. Hayden, cannot ""make grand leaps of faith . . . . We are not willing to engage in such 
intellectual gymnastics."" 672 F. Supp. at 739."
863,7," Having found insufficient evidence that would allow a reasonable jury to infer the existence of a conspiracy, we need not reach 
the issue of cognizable injury."
863,8," The Sample refers to a § 2 claim, without actually pleading it as a separate cause of action in its complaint. See Complaint 
para. 33. In Person, supra, 427 F. Supp. at 1308, the court found a § 2 claim ""raised solely by inference"" to be "" insufficient"" and 
""thus manifestly without merit."" In H.L. Hayden, supra, 672 F. Supp. at 740, the court recognized that the § 2 claim was a 
""perfunctory add-on in a section 2 refusal-to-deal case"" and found the claim to be without merit. We make the same finding here. "
864,9," Although this court has already disposed of the federal antitrust claims raised by plaintiff, the state law claim is properly before 
this Court by virtue of the parties' diversity jurisdiction. "
865,10," Other statements that appeared in similar advertisements described Pendleton as: ""a place where value still counts""; ""a place 
where people can be counted on""; and ""a place where people still take pride."" Plaintiff's App. of Exh. at 61, 63, 65. "
879,1," Federal jurisdiction over the tort and contract claims is premised on diversity of citizenship. Fallis is domiciled in Ohio, and 
Pendleton is an Oregon corporation."
879,2," The framework developed in Province and Southaven follows the Supreme Court's analysis in Associated General Contractors 
of California v. California State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723, 103 S. Ct. 897 (1983). "
880,3," Moreover, consumer standing might be precluded by Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707, 97 S. Ct. 2061 
(1977)."
880,4," The district court for the Southern District of New York found standing under very similar facts in spite of the indirectness of the 
injury. See Donahue v. Pendleton Woolen Mills, Inc., 633 F. Supp. 1423 (S.D.N.Y. 1986). We decline to follow Donahue's 
guidance. As a leading commentator has observed: No useful policy is served by granting standing to a terminated employee for a product market violation that is known to 
others. Thus the court in Donahue was wrong in granting standing to commission salesmen who were allegedly terminated 
because they objected to their employer's resale price maintenance scheme. In such a case the impact of the violation falls 
upon the dealers upon whom resale price maintenance is imposed, and they will know of the violation and have an 
incentive to sue. Areeda & Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law para. 338d (Supp. 1986). "
883,1," Para. 4 of the complaint alleges that plaintiff R. Parker Griffith is a board certified radiation/oncologist licensed to practice 
medicine in the State of Alabama who has engaged in the practice of his specialty in Huntsville, Alabama from 1975 to the 
present time. "
884,2," Despite this allegation Dr. Griffith admittedly has retained his membership on the medical staff of the Huntsville Hospital and 
there are no discernable ""peer review"" issues in this case."
884,3," The Court has treated and considered the motion to dismiss of the Huntsville Hospital defendants as a motion under Fed.R. 
Civ.P. 12(b)(1). Use of extrinsic evidence is permissible in a motion under Fed.R. Civ.P. 12(b)(1) but not under Fed.R. Civ.P. 
12(b)(6) unless the court converts the motion into one for summary judgment with notice to the parties. "
885,4," In Parker, a raisin producer filed an action against a California state official to enjoin enforcement of the state's Agricultural 
Prorate Act, which created a program ""to restrict competition among the growers [of raisins] and maintain prices in the 
distribution of their commodities to packers."" Recognizing that the state's program was anticompetitive, the Supreme Court 
nevertheless found no violation of federal antitrust law, concluding that ""nothing in the language of the Sherman Act or in its 
history . . . suggests that its purpose was to restrain a state or its officers from activities directed by its legislature."" Thus, the 
Court interpreted the Sherman Act as not prohibiting states from imposing restraints on competition. This interpretation of the 
Sherman Act is what is known as the state action doctrine. Although Parker involved a suit against a state official, the Supreme 
Court subsequently recognized that the state action exemption may also apply in a suit against a private party. See, e.g., 
Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc. v. United States, 471 U.S. 48, 58-59, 105 S. Ct. 1721, 1727, 85 L. Ed. 2d 36 
(1985). "

891,7," First, said the Desert court, Tynberg could be considered an ""official or employee . . . acting in an official capacity, 1984 Act § 
3(a). Second, he could be considered, said the court, ""a person"" whose actions were ""based on any official action directed by a 
local government, or official or employee acting in an official capacity."" Id. § 4(a)."
891,8," The district court dismissed the Clayton Act claims for damages on the basis of the Local Government Antitrust Act of 1984, 15 
U.S.C. § 35 (Supp.II 1984). "
894,9," With the consent and concurrence of the City of Huntsville, a municipal corporation."
894,10, The Court particularly refers to § 22-21-318(a)(31) and § 22-21-318(c)((1) and (c)(2) previously referenced. Ante at p. 6.
894,11," The Local Government Antitrust Act of 1984 does not immunize these defendants from suits seeking injunctive relief because 
of alleged antitrust violations. "
897,12," The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Commuter Transportation Systems, Inc. v. Hillsborough County, 801 F.2d at 1289, 
observed: ""Harlow and Parker each provide ""immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability"" (emphasis in original), 
citing Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 521, 105 S. Ct. 2806, 2816, 86 L. Ed. 2d 411 (1985). The Harlow case referred to in this 
quotation is Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 102 S. Ct. 2727, 73 L. Ed. 2d 396 (1982). "
899,13," The Health Care Authorities Act of 1982, § 22-21-310 et seq., Code of Alabama 1975, as amended, in the opinion of the Court 
effectively and fully immunizes the Huntsville Hospital defendants with respect to plaintiff's state law claims for relief asserted if 
Counts 2-5, inclusive, of plaintiff's complaint, if any such count otherwise states a state law claim upon which relief can be 
granted. "

920,2," The seven individual plaintiffs include persons who purchase advertising in the papers and allege that advertising prices will 
rise if the JOA is approved."
920,3," The Act defines a ""joint newspaper operating arrangement"" as ""any contract, agreement, joint venture (whether or not 
incorporated), or other arrangement entered into by two or more newspaper owners for the publication of two or more 
newspaper publications, pursuant to which joint or common production facilities are established or operated and joint or unified 
action is taken or agreed to be taken with respect to any one or more of the following: printing, time, method, and field of

publication other than a failing newspaper, and that approval of such arrangement would effectuate the policy and purpose

927,10," The ALJ said: Newharth and other Gannett officials testified that without a JOA they will not raise circulation prices since they intend to 
maintain pressure on the Free Press as they seek market domination. This strategy received the endorsement of 
Applicants' retained expert. But Gannett officials and retained expert never explained how Gannett can persist in this 
strategy in the face of uncontroverted proof that neither the News nor the Free Press can become profitable so long as both 
papers continue current competitive strategies. As it happens, contemporaneous evidence indicates that absent a JOA 
Gannett may eventually initiate circulation price increases as the way to return the News to profitability. (citations omitted)."
927,11," The Attorney General wrote: The argument is made that both papers should raise prices and discontinue advertising discounts. But the Free Press is 
currently selling its daily copy at 5 cents above the News and it offers a smaller discount rate. There is thus no competitive 
advantage to be gained by Knight-Ridder from a unilateral increase in prices; that market move must be accompanied by 
parallel price increases (and discount reductions) at the News if the papers have any chance of becoming profitable. Gannett has made clear that it has no intention of embarking on such a course, either unilaterally or in conjunction with 
Knight-Ridder. While the Administrative Law Judge questioned the testimony of Gannett officials to this effect, it hardly 
reflects unsound business judgment to retain awhile longer the News' current depressed pricing practices with so many 
indications that the Free Press and Knight-Ridder have abandoned all hope of market domination. (citations omitted)."
927,12," The ALJ did predict at one point that the Free Press would ""not enter the downward spiral so long as Knight-Ridder remains in 
Detroit."" This view, however, seems to rely on the notion of a ""deep pocket"" supporting the paper, which is an impermissible 
consideration under the NPA, 43 U.S.C. § 1802(5), but see dissent at 2, and furthermore irrelevant in light of basic principles of 
economics. See Easterbrook, Predatory Strategies and Counterstrategies, 48 U. CHI. L. REV. 263, 270 (1981) (""No theory of 
predation has explained why victims should lack access to capital . . . There is no reason why the capital market should refuse to 
supply funds to the victim.""). He also projected that ""if the struggle continues, there is no convincing evidence that superior scale economies is [sic] likely to 
be determinative for the News."" The import of this theory is unclear to us, because the downward spiral that leads to the demise 
of competitors in the newspaper industry is a phenomenon quite different from the traditional concept of advantageous 
economies of scale and apparently unique to this industry. See supra at 1288. "
929,13," We need not consider the hypothetical situation where the initial and principal motivating factor behind a price war is the 
prospect of a future JOA. The Attorney General was reasonable to conclude that this record did not present such a situation. "
930,1," The Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division, in recommending that a hearing be held before an ALJ, 
stated: ""Clearly, Detroit remains one of the largest and most attractive newspaper markets in the country."" Report of the 
Assistant Attorney General, Public File No. 44-03-24-8 (July 21, 1986) [hereafter, Assistant Attorney General Report], at 3

930,2," As the Majority Opinion at 1289 reports, the Free Press lost over $ 10 million per year from 1981 to 1986, while the News lost 
over $ 50 million between 1981 and 1986."
930,3," This portrait of the competitive situation, drawn in the Antitrust Division Brief, contrasts with the majority's depiction of the Free 
Press as ""poised on the brink of the [downward] spiral."" Maj. Op. at 1292. The majority recognizes that the downward spiral is 
indicated ""once a paper loses circulation."" Id. at 1288. In this light, the Antitrust Division emphasized the precarious position of 
the News: ""The News has been unable to convert its leads into any degree of profitability; instead, its losses in 1986 increased 
as it sought to protect a daily circulation lead which it appeared to be on the verge of losing."" Antitrust Division Brief at 10."
930,4," Cf. Assistant Attorney General Report at 6-7 (executive summary) (""When a newspaper owner consciously and deliberately 
decides to sacrifice short-term profits in a quest for greater long-term profits, indeed potential monopoly profits, should a JOA be 
available as a 'second-best' alternative?""); id. at 66 (same query). "
931,5," It bears repetition that the ALJ's decision reflected the position presented to him as the decided view of the Antitrust Division, 
the very Department of Justice unit responsible for enforcing the antitrust laws. The bottom lines of the brief filed by the Division 
after the ALJ hearing state: ""The record does not warrant the conclusion that Detroit cannot support two competitive papers or 
that the Free Press is in probable danger of failure if the JOA is denied. The Antitrust Division therefore recommends that the 
application be disapproved."" Antitrust Division Brief at 29."

majority next maintains, and relegates the ""narrow construction of antitrust exemptions"" rule to cases in which Congress had a 
specific intent. See Maj. Op. at 1292. Did Chevron indeed uproot a guide (both to the executive and to the judiciary) of such "
932,," ""fundamental importance"" ( Hearst, 704 F.2d at 473) to antitrust law administration? Under Chevron, is it the Attorney General's 
prerogative to construe an ambiguously-phrased antitrust law exemption expansively? The answer to these questions, I 
believe, unless and until Higher Authority tells us unambiguously otherwise, must be ""No."" "

941,6," Specifically, Amgen asserted in the complaint filed with the Commission: Chugai imports into the United States recombinant erythropoietin manufactured in Japan by a process utilizing genetically 
engineered host cells containing DNA sequences coding for human erythropoietin. Utilization of such genetically 
engineered host cells constitutes infringement of the '008 patent claims. Chugai, therefore, is engaged in the importation of 
a product produced by a process covered by the claims of the '008 patent in violation of 19 U.S.C. sec. 1337a. . . . United States International Trade Commission Complaint Exhibit 22 at 1 (Exhibit B to the Memorandum in Support of Defendant

otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. If the adverse 
party does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against the adverse party. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e) (1988). "

seventeen years, . . . of the right to exclude others from making, using, or selling the invention throughout the United

943,10," Addressing this inquiry of determining the scope of the patent, the Supreme Court has stated: The scope of every patent is limited to the invention described in the claims contained in it, read in the light of the 
specification. These so mark where the progress claimed by the patent begins and where it ends that they have been aptly 
likened to the description in a deed, which sets the bounds to the grant which it contains. It is to the claims of every patent, 
therefore, that we must turn when we are seeking to determine what the invention is, the exclusive use of which is given to 
the inventor by the grant provided for by the statute, -- 'He can claim nothing beyond them.' Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co., 243 U.S. 502, 510, 37 S. Ct. 416, 61 L. Ed. 871 (1917). "
945,11," HN10[
] If these requirements of literal infringement are not satisfied, however, the infringement analysis does not end there. 
That is, even if the accused device does not fall within the literal reading of the patent claims, the test of equivalence -- whether 
the accused device ""performs substantially the same function in substantially the same way to obtain the same result,"" Graver 
Tank & Mfg. Co. v. Linde Air Prods. Co., 339 U.S. 605, 608, 70 S. Ct. 854, 94 L. Ed. 1097 (1950) (quoting Sanitary Refrigerator 
Co. v. Winters, 280 U.S. 30, 42, 50 S. Ct. 9, 74 L. Ed. 147 [1929]) -- is a crucial question concerning infringement. Otherwise, ""to 
allow literality alone to satisfy the infringement test would force patent law to reward literary skill and not the inventor's creativity. 
Since the law is intended to benefit the inventor's genius and not the scrivener's talent, the structures must do the same work in 
substantially the same way and accomplish substantially the same result."" 6 E. Lipscomb, Walker on Patents sec. 22:23, at 513 
(3d ed. 1987) (footnote omitted). In Graver Tank, the Supreme Court explained that ""to permit imitation of a patented invention 
which does not copy every literal detail would be to convert the protection of the patent grant into a hollow and useless thing."" Id. 
at 607. The Supreme Court continued: HN11[
] Equivalence, in the patent law, is not the prisoner of a formula and is not an absolute to be considered in a 
vacuum. It does not require complete identity for every purpose and in every respect. . . . Consideration must be given to 
the purpose for which an ingredient is used in a patent, the qualities it has when combined with the other ingredients, and 
the function which it is intended to perform. An important factor is whether persons reasonably skilled in the art would have 
known of the interchangeability of an ingredient not contained in the patent with one that was. Id. at 609. A finding of equivalence, therefore, is a determination of fact. E.g., id. at 609; Omark Indus. v. Textron, Inc., 688 F.2d 
1242, 1250 (9th Cir. 1982)."
945,12," Amgen, in its own product specification, states, ""Ultrapure erythropoietin is a homogeneous preparation. . . ."" Amgen 
Biologicals at 3 (unnumbered) (Hewick Decl., Exhibit C)."
945,13," This article, Lin, et al., Cloning and Expression of the Human Erythropoietin Gene, 82 Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA 7580 (1985) 
(attached as Exhibit F to the Declaration of J. Evan Sadler in Support of Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment of Patent 
Infringement [hereinafter, ""Sadler Decl.""]) is written, in part, by several Amgen scientists. The article states, ""[The recombinant 
erythropoietin] has an apparent [molecular weight] of 34,000 when analyzed in an electrophoretic transfer blot."" Id. at 7582."
945,14," Of course, it is well established that the nonmoving party must go beyond the pleadings, and by affidavits, depositions, 
answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, must designate specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue. See "
946,," supra at 9-10. This, Amgen has failed to do. Instead, Amgen has merely asserted these facts in its memorandum and attached 
to its memorandum a technical article about recombinant erythropoietin that fails to support specifically these assertions. Such 
arguments, without the detailed factual support required by Rule 56, are wholly inadequate. See Transurface Carriers, Inc. v. 
Ford Motor Co., 738 F.2d 42, 46 (1st Cir. 1984) (holding that ""mere assertions of counsel made in a legal memorandum are 
insufficient to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact""). "
947,15," The document containing this data is entitled ""Specification: Purified Bulk-Erythropoietin"" and appears to be an Amgen form. 
Opposition Memorandum I, Exhibit D, at 1. It bears an effective date of January 26, 1988. Amgen terms this document a 
""product specification."" Opposition Memorandum I at 9. Nowhere does Amgen explain what this document is, what its present 
status is (e.g., has it since been withdrawn or revised by Amgen?), or why the specific activity figure cited in it conflicts with other 
Amgen data. "
948,16," As a jurisdictional matter Amgen argues that, under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, this Court should stay this motion 
pending the resolution of those issues presented to the Commission. Opposition Memorandum II at 17-19. HN14[
] The 
doctrine of primary jurisdiction applies where a claim is originally cognizable in the courts, and comes into play whenever enforcement of the claim 
requires the resolution of issues which, under a regulatory scheme, have been placed within the special competence of an 
administrative body; in such a case the judicial process is suspended pending referral of such issues to the administrative 
body for its views. United States v. Western Pacific R.R. Co., 352 U.S. 59, 64, 77 S. Ct. 161, 1 L. Ed. 2d 126 (1956). Although the doctrine may be 
involved in the appropriate course under different circumstances, see Ricci v. Chicago Mercantile Exchange, 409 U.S. 289, 305-
306, 93 S. Ct. 573, 34 L. Ed. 2d 525 (1973) (upholding the stay of an antitrust suit until the Commodity Exchange Commission 
could decide whether the defendants had violated the Commodity Exchange Act rules); Meditech Int'l Co. v. Minigrip, Inc., 648 F. 
Supp. 1488, 1496 (N.D. Ill. 1986) (ruling that the doctrine of primary jurisdiction stayed the action until the International Trade 
Commission resolved whether the defendant misled the Commission), the Court need not stay action on this motion for 
summary judgment. The issue here is a preliminary one -- whether Amgen filed its complaint with the Commission in bad faith -- 
and such an issue does not necessarily require the special competence of the Commission. Moreover, in this opinion, the Court 
does not bypass the Commission; indeed, as will be explained below, the Court incorporates and relies upon a preliminary 
determination made by the Commission denying Chugai's motion for summary determination of the Commission complaint. See 
infra note 20. Thus, a stay of this motion is not required in this case. "
949,17," Although Handgards II and Argus Chem. both involved actions grounded in antitrust law rather than the doctrine of patent 
misuse, they are apposite here. The gravamen of both types of actions centers on the bad faith of the patentee. Not surprisingly, 
courts have determined that the treatment of the bad faith issue in the patent misuse context is largely the same as in antitrust 
law. See, e.g., USM Corp., 694 F.2d at 511-12."
949,18," In this context, there is a presumption that a patentee's infringement action is brought in good faith. See Handgards, Inc. v. 
Ethicon, Inc., 601 F.2d 986, 996 (9th Cir. 1979) (Handgards I), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1025, 62 L. Ed. 2d 659, 100 S. Ct. 688, 
204 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 880 (1980); Universal Athletic Sales Co. v. American Gym, 480 F. Supp. 408, 423 (W.D. Pa. 1979)."
949,19, See infra at 41.
949,20," In fact, Chugai filed a motion for summary determination in the Commission proceedings. The Administrative Law Judge, 
however, denied the motion on March 7, 1988. Thus, where the Commission has denied the motion for summary determination, 
this Court concludes that there is sufficient evidence to establish a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether the "
950,," Commission proceeding is a mere sham. Cf. Omni Resource Dev. Corp. v. Conoco, Inc., 739 F.2d 1412 (9th Cir. 1984) 
(Kennedy, J.) (holding that the defendant, the plaintiff in prior state court proceedings, is immune from antitrust liability under the 
Noerr-Pennington doctrine in part because those state court proceedings could not be considered baseless where the state 
court granted temporary and preliminary injunctions against the subsequent antitrust case plaintiff); Shepherd Intelligence 
Systems, Inc. v. Defense Tech., Inc., 702 F. Supp. 365 (D. Mass. 1988) (holding that defendants' success in obtaining 
preliminary injunctive relief in state court was insufficient to establish as matter of law that those state court suits are not 
baseless)."
950,21," The Brief Summary portion of the '008 patent describes the patent as follows: The present invention provides, for the first time, novel purified and isolated polypeptide products having part or all of the 
primary structural conformation (i.e., continuous sequence of amino acid residues) and one or more of the biological 
properties (e.g., immunological properties and in vivo and in vitro biological activity) of naturally-occurring erythropoietin, 
including allelic variants thereof. These polypeptides are also uniquely characterized by being the product of procaryotic or 
eucaryotic host expression (e.g., by bacterial, yeast and mammalian cells in culture) of exogenous DNA sequences 
obtained by genomic or DNA cloning or by gene synthesis. . . . . Novel glycoprotein products of the invention include those having a primary structural conformation sufficiently duplicative 
of that of a naturally-occurring (e.g., human) erythropoietin to allow possession of one or more of the biological properties 
thereof and having an average carbohydrate composition which differs from that of naturally-occurring (e.g., human) 
erythropoietin. . . . . Also provided by the present invention are synthetic polypeptides wholly or partially duplicative of continuous sequences of 
erythropoietin amino acid residues. . . . These sequences, by virtue of sharing primary, secondary or tertiary structural and 
conformational characteristics with naturally-occurring erythropoietin may possess biological activity and/or immunological 
properties in common with the naturally-occurring product such that they may be employed as biologically active or 
immunological substitutes for erythropoietin in therapeutic and immunological processes. United States Patent No. 4,703,008 at cols. 10-11 (Complaint, Exhibit A). "
951,22," A concern expressed by some authors and scientists is that the increased commercial incentives to protect intellectual 
property in the area of biotechnology adversely impacts the traditions of open communication with the scientific community. See 
Eisenberg, Proprietary Rights and the Norms of Science in Biotechnology Research, 97 Yale L.J. 177, 178 (1987). Some even 
regard the patent process darkly as ""a means of institutionalized secrecy. . . .  Id. at 185 n.37 (citing Commercialization of 
Academic Biomedical Research: Hearings Before the Subcomm. on Investigations and Oversight and the Subcomm. on 
Science, Research and Technology of the House Comm. on Science and Technology, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. 79 [1981]). 
Although traditional patent law doctrines restricted patent protection to applied technology, as distinguished from basic scientific 
research, Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303, 100 S. Ct. 2204, 65 L. Ed. 2d 144 (1980) and its progeny have extended 
patent protection for biotechnical innovations. Eisenberg, supra, at 185-90. Eisenberg suggests that the possibility of such 
protection poses for the inventor an apparent conflict between the scientific norms of promoting the progress of science and the 
commercial incentives created by scientific rewards. Id. at 230."

953,24," In the same letter to the Commission, Dennis Allegretti (""Allegretti""), counsel for Amgen, stated: Such claims were rejected by the [Patent and Trademark Office] under authority of In re Durden. . . . . Regardless of the hope that may have been offered for the allowance of such process claims after In re Durden and prior to 
the rejection in the Amgen application, regardless of whatever changes in rejection practice and policy by the [Patent and 
Trademark Office] may arise after that rejection, and regardless of Amgen's continuing efforts to secure process claims in 
its presently pending continuation application, I submit that the controlling fact is that Amgen's vigorous efforts to secure the 
allowance of process claims in its original application for the '008 patent, from its filing in 1984 until rejection in 1987, were 
denied under the authority of In re Durden. Allegretti Letter at 1, 2-3 (Chugai Memorandum II, Exhibit G). "

982,4," The state action doctrine as it applies to local governments exempts actions by counties or municipalities which are ""in 
furtherance or implementation of clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state policy.""@ See Community 
Communications Co. v. Boulder, 455 U.S. 40, 102 S.Ct. 835, 70 L.Ed.2d 810 (1982)."
982,5," Further evidence of this intent may be found in the General Assembly's enactments protecting counties from the reach of 
federal antitrust laws. In 1983 the General Assembly declared that ""It has been and shall continue to be the policy of the State to authorize each chartered county to displace or limit 
competition in the award of concessions on, over or under property owned or leased by the county . . . in order to utilize 
properly the assets of the county for the best public purpose; to provide necessary or desirable governmental services at 
the lowest possible cost; . . . and to promote the general welfare by utilizing public property for the benefit of the citizens of 
the community."" Maryland Code (1957, 1987 Repl.Vol.) Art. 25A, § 5A(c)(1).  See also, Code (1957, 1987 Repl.Vol.) Art. 23A, § 2A (municipal 
corporations -- power to displace competition); Art. 25, § 3D (county commissioners); Art. 25B, § 13B (code counties); Baltimore 
City Charter, Art. II, § 57. These laws were passed in response to the Boulder case (see footnote 4), and were intended to protect local governments from 
the potentially great financial burdens involved with antitrust litigation. "
989,*," The Honorable Thomas E. Fairchild, Senior United States Circuit Judge for the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh 
Circuit sitting by designation. "
992,1," Flygt argues that the jury found the existence of a single relevant product market of liquid manure pumps and hoists and that 
the finding is unsupported. In the context of the evidence and the contentions of the parties at trial, the reading we adopt seems 
appropriate. See Gallick v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 372 U.S. 108, 119, 121, 83 S. Ct. 659, 666, 9 L. Ed. 2d 618 (1963) quoting "
993,," A. & G. Stevedores v. Ellerman Lines, 369 U.S. 355, 364, 82 S. Ct. 780, 786, 7 L. Ed. 2d 798 (1962) (""Where there is a view of 
the case that makes the jury's answers to special interrogatories consistent, they must be resolved that way."")"
993,2," For a short period in 1982, H.J. promoted and sold about 12 or 13 ABS municipal submersible liquid manure pumps modified 
for agricultural use. Problems in adaptation were not solved, and it never gained acceptance by dairy farmers. Construing this 
evidence most favorably to H.J., Flygt can be considered the only meaningful manufacturer of submersible liquid manure pumps 
selling in the region during the period at issue. "
994,3," There was no deliberate effort to prove the prices of any products other than the mix hoist system. While the record contains 
scattered references to the approximate price of some of the pumps discussed, there was no systematic comparison of prices of 
the allegedly competing pumps. The question of relative cost is not merely academic; it is an essential consideration of any 
rational purchaser, here the dairy farmer, in making the decision to buy one product over another. For example, during the 
relevant period conversion from a solid to a liquid manure system would require a substantial investment in a new pump and 
containment facilities. Estimates ran as high as $ 30,000 to $ 80,000. Federal and state (at least in Minnesota) subsidies were 
available to defray the cost of conversion, but there was no evidence of these subsidies' effects, if any, on the relative costs of 
manure pumps. Converting from a long-shaft pump to a submersible involves no similar capital investment, but the only 
evidence introduced of the cost of long-shaft pumps relative to submersibles was that their prices were ""roughly equal."" "
995,4," Mr. Larsen, H.J.'s president, was himself guilty of casual use of the word ""compete,"" stating at trial that ""the pumps we had to 
compete with were the long shaft pumps that were manufactured by A. O. Smith and Hedlund."" "
996,5," The verdict question as to relevant product market left a blank space for the answer. The jury wrote ""Submersible liquid manure 
pump and mix hoist systems."" The question as to dangerous probability of success inquired whether there was a probability ""that 
defendants would succeed in gaining a monopoly in mix hoists,"" called for a yes or no answer, and was answered ""yes."" Thus 
the question whether there was a dangerous probability of successful monopolization of the pump market (a quite different 
question altogether) was neither submitted nor answered, and the reference to the pump product market is surplusage."
996,6," There has been some conflict in decisions in this circuit whether a relevant product and geographic market must be identified.  
Conoco Inc. v. Inman Oil Co., Inc., 774 F.2d 895, 904 n.6 (8th Cir. 1985). Compare National Reporting Co., 763 F.2d at 1025 
(8th Cir. 1985) with Trace X Chemical, above. Since these findings support a determination of liability for attempting to 
monopolize the sale of mix hoists even if identification of a relevant product and geographic market is required, we need not 
resolve whatever conflict may exist."
996,7," While the parties engage in considerable discussion of whether Flygt's termination of H.J.'s distributorship violates the 
Sherman Act, careful reading of the jury verdict reveals that no finding was made that Flygt maintained, or attempted to acquire, 
monopoly power by the termination; Section 2 liability rests entirely upon the finding of predatory pricing and tying. We resist the 
invitation again to address the thorny question of antitrust liability for forward integration, see Paschall, 727 F.2d at 696, when 
the special verdict does not require us to do so. Even if the jury had so found, in light of our holding that H.J. failed to properly 
define the relevant product market, there would be no support for a finding that Flygt's change in distribution alone violated 
Section 2. HN8[
] Absent monopoly power, a supplier's unilateral refusal to deal, whatever the motivation, does not violate the 
antitrust laws.  Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 761, 104 S. Ct. 1464, 1469, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775 (1984); 
United States v. Colgate & Co., 250 U.S. 300, 307, 39 S. Ct. 465, 468, 63 L. Ed. 992 (1919); Pumps & Power Co. v. Southern 
States Industries, 787 F.2d 1252, 1256 (8th Cir. 1986). "
997,8," Flygt objects to the omission of the word ""specifically"" from the special verdict question whether defendants intended to 
monopolize. This does not amount to reversible error, as the jury instructions made it clear that a finding of ""specific intent"" was 
required. "
998,9," Since the jury was not asked to make a finding identifying the specific acts allegedly in restraint of trade, we may properly 
assume the jury considered the termination of H.J.'s distributorship to be one. "
999,10," Flygt also cites Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio, 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) as 
support for additional requirements that the plaintiff must prove that the defendant ""had . . . [a] rational economic motive to 
conspire, and . . . [defendant's] conduct is [not] consistent with other, equally plausible explanations. . . ."" 475 U.S. at 596-97, 
106 S. Ct. at 1361. The Court, facing a case decided on summary judgment, concluded that ""if the factual context renders 
respondents' claim implausible -- if the claim is one that simply makes no economic sense -- respondents must come forward 
with more persuasive evidence to support their claim than would otherwise be necessary."" 475 U.S. at 587, 106 S. Ct. at 1356. 
There is no claim in this case that the supposed conspiracy makes no economic sense. Matsushita Electric does not apply. 
There is no question that the elimination of the distributor level was intended to, and did, benefit both Flygt and the dealers. "
1001,11," The district court did not decide whether the law of Connecticut (where the contract was signed) or Minnesota (where H.J. was 
located) controlled the breach of contract claims. The parties do not claim a conflict exists between the two states' laws, and we 
apply generally accepted principles of contract law. "
1002,12," The Harvestore dealers were licensees of A. O. Smith Corporation, and in addition to being customers of H.J. and Flygt, were 
also competitors since they sold other manure pumps and associated services. H.J.'s conversion claim really amounts to the "
1003,," assertion that Flygt ""stole"" its good relations with the Harvestore dealers, which can be considered nothing more than a way of 
restating its tortious interference claim."
1003,13," H.J. does not argue, in light of Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 
628 (1984), that ITT formed an antitrust conspiracy with its subsidiary Flygt. "
1004,14," The figure inserted in the antitrust part of the verdict was $ 613,800.00, but it had not been adjusted to 1986 value. $ 
671,956.00 was inserted with respect to improper interference, and it had been adjusted. "
1006,15," Because we reverse the judgment of the district court, H.J.'s cross-appeal on the question of the timeliness of its attorney fees 
application under Local Rule 6 of the District of Minnesota is moot. If H.J. does not elect a retrial, it will have 30 days from the 
entry of judgment following remand to make its application for attorney's fees and costs under 15 U.S.C. § 15(a). Such fees may 
include the costs and fees incurred in this appeal, Perkins v. Standard Oil Co., 399 U.S. 222, 90 S. Ct. 1989, 26 L. Ed. 2d 534 
(1970), as well as at trial, to be determined by the district court, limited to an amount reasonable in relation to the results 
obtained. See Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 103 S. Ct. 1933, 76 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1983); Williams v. Mensey, 785 F.2d 631 
(8th Cir. 1986); Alexander v. National Farmers Organization, 637 F. Supp. 1487 (W.D.Mo. 1986). "
1012,1," HN1[
] As a foreign corporation (CU pleads that it is incorporated in the State of Michigan), it can only be subjected to the jurisdiction of this Court if jurisdictional facts comply with the State of Louisiana Long-Arm Statute, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. 13:3201 
(West 1988). This statute extends the jurisdictional reach of Louisiana courts to the full limits established by due process 
jurisprudence.  Quasha v. Shale Development Corp., 667 F.2d 483 (5th Cir. 1982). This Court therefore determines its 
jurisdiction to entertain plaintiff's claims against CU according to this standard."
1012,2," In a document that plaintiff's attorney filed into the record of this case subsequent to the filing of his opposition to CU's Motion 
to Dismiss, plaintiff's attorney identifies Bernstein by affidavit as a resident of New York who was retained by plaintiff's attorney 
to do investigative work on plaintiff's behalf. (Doc. 31). Bernstein's calls to CU may have violated Rule 4.2 of the American Bar 
Association's Rules for Professional Conduct. This rule provides: For representing a client, a lawyer shall not communicate about the subject of representation with a party the lawyer knows to be 
represented by another lawyer in the matter unless the lawyer has the consent of the other lawyer or is authorized by law to do 
so. Comment 2 to Rule 4.2 explains clearly that Rule 4.2 prohibits such contact with persons having managerial responsibility or any 
other person whose act or omission in connection with the matter may be imputed to the corporation. As such, this Court 
believes it could refuse to consider these affidavits as gathered in blatant violation of this ethical standard. See, Coughlin v. U.S., 
391 F.2d 371, 376-77 (9th Cir. 1968)(dissent). Because of the inadequacy of plaintiff's proof of this Court's jurisdiction over CU, 
even considering the information contained in the affidavits, the Court does not decide this issue. "
1013,3," SM has moved for dismissal of all of plaintiff's claims. (Doc. 7) SM has offered no independent support for its motion; instead it 
has referred the Court to the legal authority and arguments Ford made in its memorandum supporting its motion for dismissal. 
Accordingly, we consider only those objections to plaintiff's claims raised by Ford. "
1015,4," Although plaintiff's abandonment is ambiguous in documents filed into the record in that plaintiff describes defendant's 
objection to such claims as ""moot"" (Doc. 12, p. 9), plaintiff's counsel has confirmed with the Court by telephone January 25, 
1989 his intention not to pursue these claims."
1015,5," In these Motions to Dismiss and subsequent briefing all counsel show that there is substantial disagreement over the nature of 
this agreement. For purposes of this part of the motion, this Court, as it must, construes this disputed fact most favorably for the 
plaintiff, and analyzes the viability of plaintiff's UTPA claim according to plaintiff's contentions in his amended complaint that 
defendants used information plaintiff provided under a contract in an unauthorized manner to plaintiff's detriment. "
1016,6," This limitation period is found in the La. Rev. Stat. 51:1409E which reads ""the action provided by this section shall be 
prescribed by one year running from the time of the transaction or act which gave rise to this right of action."""
1016,7," Plaintiff offers no set date for the alleged unfair acts that serve as the basis for its UTPA claims. However plaintiff claims that it 
entered into a contract with Ford in or around June 1985 (Doc. 1, p.2) and that the SM tape was published January 9, 1987. 
Plaintiff has testified that he knew of the SM tape in February, 1987 and that he stopped providing information to Ford in March 
or April, 1987. Consequently, the unfair acts alleged would have to have taken place no earlier than June, 1985 and no later 
than April, 1987. For purposes of resolution of this motion, the Court uses the last date as its reference point. "
1017,8," La. Civ. Code Art. 1901 was repealed effective January 1, 1985 and its provisions were scattered throughout the Civil Code. 
See, La. Civ. Code, Vol. 6, Disposition Table, XXI. The requirement of good faith in executing contracts is now found in La. Civ. 
Code Art. 1983 (West 1985) and Art. 1759 contains the requirement of good faith between obligors and obligees. "
1027,*," The Honorable John R. Brown, Senior Circuit Judge for the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, sitting by 
designation."
1027,1," This is a consolidated appeal of class actions commenced by Tony Downs Foods Co., A & M Moving and Storage Co. and 
Austin Products, Inc. in April 1983, by the Diocese of Winona and Butterfield Foods Co. in June 1983 and by Briggs 
Transportation Co. in July 1984. The actions have been consolidated but the classes are not yet certified."
1027,2," Defendants originally moved to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b). For the purposes of the motion the defendants conceded 
that they had ""entered into a private agreement to fix the price of workers' compensation premiums."" The Honorable Paul A. 
Magnuson, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota, ruled that the conduct at issue was the business of 
insurance and was regulated by state law. Because plaintiffs had alleged ""some level of enforcement activity,"" the motion to 
dismiss was initially denied.  In re Workers' Compensation Ins. Antitrust Litig., 574 F. Supp. 525, 535 (D.Minn. 1983)."
1027,3," After completion of discovery, the Honorable James M. Rosenbaum, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota, 
held there was not sufficient evidence of enforcement activity and that no proof of boycott existed under the 3(b) exception. He 
affirmed Judge Magnuson's earlier opinion that the conduct of the defendants was exempt from the federal antitrust laws under 
section 2(b) of the Act. In re Workers' Compensation Ins. Antitrust Litig., No. 4-45-1166 (D.Minn. July 28, 1987)."

1029,5," 440 U.S. at 224 n. 32. See also SEC v. National Sec., 393 U.S. 453, 460, 89 S. Ct. 564, 21 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1969) (""Certainly 
HN7[
] the fixing of rates is part of [the] business [of insurance]; that is what [United States v.] South-Eastern Underwriters 
[Ass'n, 322 U.S. 533, 64 S. Ct. 1162, 88 L. Ed. 1440 (1944)], was all about."")."
1029,6," Justice Brennan made the same argument, dissenting in Royal Drug, 440 U.S. at 244."
1029,7," Defendants emphasize that the plaintiffs initially concede that rate setting when authorized by the state is the business of 
insurance. Under such circumstances it makes little sense to say that cooperative rate setting, without state involvement, is not 
within the business of insurance. It is the setting of the rates which constitutes the business of insurance. This characterization is 
not dependent upon the identity of the rate setters. Plaintiffs deny such a concession. They urge, however, that the cooperative 
exchange of information among insurers within the state-sanctioned rate making process is arguably the business of insurance 
since it relates to transferring and spreading the risk. Plaintiffs argue that the ""charging"" of uniform rates before 1979 was 
exempt from the Sherman Act under the ""state action"" doctrine (relying upon Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc. v. 
United States, 471 U.S. 48, 85 L. Ed. 2d 36, 105 S. Ct. 1721 (1985)) and not under the McCarran-Ferguson Act. Although 
plausible, no authority supports this argument. "
1030,8," Minn. Stat. § 72A.25 (1984) (in force throughout the relevant time period) reads in part: Unfair competition Subdivision 1. Statement of charges; service; hearing. Whenever the commissioner has reason to believe that any 
person engaged in the business of insurance is engaged in this state in any method of competition or in any act or practice 
in the conduct of that business which is not defined in section 72A.20, that said method of competition is unfair or that said 
act or practice is unfair or deceptive and that a proceeding by him in respect thereto would be to the interest of the public, 
he may issue and serve upon that person a statement of the charges in that respect and a notice of a hearing thereon to be 
held at a time and place fixed in the notice, which shall not be less than 20 days after the date of the service thereof. Each 
such hearing shall be conducted in the same manner as the hearings provided for in section 72A.22, and the provisions of 
that section as to service are made applicable to proceedings under this section. Upon good cause shown, the 
commissioner shall permit any person to intervene, appear and be heard at such hearing by counsel or in person. The 
commissioner shall, after the hearing, make a report in writing in which he shall state his findings as to the facts and shall 
serve a copy thereof upon the person upon whom he served his statement of charges. Other subdivisions of the statute outline judicial enforcement measures to be initiated by joint action of the insurance 
commissioner and the state attorney general. "
1031,9," As Judge Feinberg observed: State power to regulate necessarily includes the discretion to prohibit, permit, or limit insurance practices as the state sees 
fit. The McCarran-Ferguson Act clearly contemplates that where a state undertakes to regulate the business of insurance, it 
has the power to permit practices which would otherwise violate federal antitrust laws; if the exemption is only to apply 
when state law squarely prohibits all acts which would, absent the exemption, violate the antitrust laws, the state regulation 
which the McCarran-Ferguson Act aims to foster, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1011, 1012(a), would be a nullity. Dexter, 527 F.2d at 236."
1031,10," Minn. Stat. § 72A.19 (1984) states in part: HN10[
] Unfair methods and unfair or deceptive acts and practices prohibited Subdivision 1. No person shall engage in this state in any trade practice which is defined in sections 72A.17 to 72A.32 * * * 
to be an unfair method of competition or an unfair or deceptive act or practice in the business of insurance. Minn. Stat. § 72A.20 (1984) HN11[
] defines unfair or deceptive methods, acts or practices. Subdivision 4 specifically defines 
boycott, coercion and intimidation as unfair method or practices: Entering into any agreement to commit, or by any concerted action committing, any act of boycott, coercion, or intimidation, 
resulting in or tending to result in unreasonable restraint of, or monopoly in, the business of insurance, shall constitute an 
unfair method of competition and an unfair and deceptive act or practice.  However, this specific prohibition does not limit unfair methods of competition solely to the use of boycotts. Cf.  Dexter, 527 F.2d 
at 236. "
1032,11," A similar argument is extended to the nonapplicability of state antitrust laws: that is, they were not passed to regulate the 
business of insurance. They therefore simply serve to accommodate rather than to preempt the federal antitrust laws under the 
McCarran-Ferguson Act. See Weller, I at 431-38. But cf.  Royal Drug, 440 U.S. at 247 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (citing SEC v. 
National Sec., 393 U.S. 453, 460, 89 S. Ct. 564, 21 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1969)) (""Statutes HN12[
] aimed at protecting or regulating 
[insurance company - policy holder] relationships, directly or indirectly, are laws regulating the 'business of insurance.'""); ""Where 
a State enacts its own antitrust laws conferring § 2(b) immunity, § 3(b) retains Sherman Act coverage for those especially 
'destructive . . . practices.'"" Barry, 438 U.S. at 566 (Stewart, J., dissenting) (citing South-Eastern Underwriters, 322 U.S. at 562)."

explained: FTC v. National Casualty Co., * * * is the only case in this Court involving [to what extent a state must regulate the ""business of 
insurance"" to pre-empt the federal antitrust laws]. There, the Court held that the state statutes ""prohibiting unfair and deceptive 
insurance practices,"" preempted Federal Trade Commission regulations ""prohibiting respondent insurance companies from 
carrying on certain advertising practices found by the Commission to be false, misleading, and deceptive, in violation of the 
Federal Trade Commission Act . . . . "" Noting that no one had alleged that the state regulation was ""mere pretense,"" the Court 
rejected the FTC's argument that the state regulation was ""too 'inchoate' to be 'regulation' until [the state's statutory] prohibition 
has been crystallized into 'administrative elaboration of these standards and application in individual cases.'"""
1032,438," U.S. at 557 n. 4 (Stewart, J., dissenting) (citations omitted). "
1034,14," The term boycott has a long tradition of usage. As stated in an early case: ""Courts differ as to what constitutes a boycott that 
may be enjoined. All hold that there must be a conspiracy causing irreparable damage to the business or property of the 
complainant."" Gompers v. Bucks Stove & Range Co., 221 U.S. 418, 437, 55 L. Ed. 797, 31 S. Ct. 492 (1911). The First Circuit 
has said: ""The classic anticompetitive 'group boycott' is a concerted action by competitors at one level to protect themselves 
from competition by non-group members who seek to compete at that level."" Allied Intl., Inc. v. International Longshoremen's 
Ass'n, 640 F.2d 1368, 1380 (1st Cir. 1981), aff'd, 456 U.S. 212, 72 L. Ed. 2d 21, 102 S. Ct. 1656 (1982) (citation omitted). The 
Third Circuit has provided another description: ""'Classic' boycotts [include those] in which a group of business competitors 
seek[s] to benefit economically by excluding other competitors from the market place. 'The crucial element' in such boycotts, 
according to Professor Sullivan, 'is an effort to exclude or cause disadvantage to one or more competitors by cutting them off 
from trade relationships which are necessary to any firm trying to compete.'"" Larry V. Muko, Inc. v. Southwestern Pa. Bldg. & 
Constr. Trades Council, 670 F.2d 421, 429-30 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 916, 74 L. Ed. 2d 182, 103 S. Ct. 229 (1982). The Supreme Court has held that the means used to restrain competition were irrelevant. See Gompers, 221 U.S. at 438. See 
also American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U.S. 781, 809, 90 L. Ed. 1575, 66 S. Ct. 1125 (1946). What is important is that 
an anti-competitive motive propel the actions. ""'In each of [the] cases [finding an illegal boycott] the aim and purpose of the 
group boycott or refusal to deal was either to compel the object of the boycott to adopt a certain standard of trade practice, or to 
exclude him from competition.'"" M & H Tire Co. v. Hoosier Racing Tire Corp., 733 F.2d 973, 979 (1st Cir. 1984) (citation omitted). 
See also American Tobacco, 328 U.S. at 809 (""It is not the form of the combination or the particular means used but the result to 
be achieved that the statute condemns.""). Similarly, it matters not whether the actions currently restrain competition, if they pose the threat of future trade restraint: ""It is the 
'contract, combination . . . or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce' which § 1 of the Act strikes down, whether the 
concerted activity be wholly nascent or abortive on the one hand, or successful on the other."" United States v. Socony-Vacuum

1050,1," Or more accurately, the question is whether the Attorney General reasonably believed that the Detroit Free Press reasonably 
believes that the News will follow that course. In that event, as we said in our opinion, the Free Press' assertion that it will shut 
down if the JOA is denied is hardly incredible."
1050,2," See C. Kaysen & D. Turner, Antitrust Policy 191 n.1 (1971) (""There are disturbing indications that newspaper publishing is 
approaching this unhappy state [of natural monopoly] in many cities and towns.""). The Attorney General never took a position on 
whether the Detroit market is a natural monopoly, and the passage on which the Chief Judge relies obviously fails to suggest 
that he did. See Statement of Chief Judge Wald, at 2 n.2. The Attorney General simply said that ""the Free Press plainly does not 
face external market forces--such as rising costs, competition from other media outlets and the siphoning off of readers from the 
metropolitan region to the suburbs--that would portend almost certain failure."" And his statement that ""the Detroit market could 
sustain two profitable newspapers if both circulations and advertising prices were increased"" is not really inconsistent with the 
possibility that the Detroit market is a natural monopoly. See P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law, § 621, at 48 (In a natural 
monopoly market, ""demand may be sufficient at some price fixed by law or cartel to cover the costs of more than one producer, 
but the cost of production will be significantly lower with a single producer.""). The ALJ did say that ""there is no convincing 
evidence that superior scale economies is [sic] likely to be determinative for the News,"" but it is by no means clear that it is only 
or chiefly scale economies that cause one-newspaper towns. That may be why the newspaper market is so puzzling. "
1051,3," The ALJ did quote the management of the Free Press as saying that the paper could become profitable if ""competitive pricing 
becomes rational and consistent with other markets around the country."" See Statement of Chief Judge Wald, at 1. But, as we 
explained in our opinion, all the Attorney General said was that some hypothetical pricing scheme could support two papers."
1051,4," Appellants merely contended (see Statement of Chief Judge Wald, at 6 n.7) that the Attorney General's interpretation of the 
NPA would allow large corporate newspaper chains to obtain JOAs by pursuing a course of aggressive competition. Only the 
amicus mentioned predation, and its concern was that approval of the Detroit JOA would lead to illegal pricing in Little Rock. 
Amicus asserted that the Arkansas Gazette had engaged in ""unprecedented"" predatory action in hopes of obtaining a JOA 
(which suggests that Little Rock might be an appropriate place to advance the Chief Judge's argument). The amicus filed no 
public comments on the Detroit JOA with the Attorney General and did not seek to intervene in that proceeding. The major 
Detroit-area newspaper unions and Mayor Young of Detroit did intervene before the Attorney General, see 28 C.F.R. § 48.11, 
but did not appeal. Moreover, appellants only barely (in one sentence) made the argument that Judge Ruth B. Ginsburg focused 
on in her dissent--that exceptions to the antitrust laws should be narrowly construed."
1051,5," Perhaps appellants did not raise the predation argument here because they knew it was not raised before the Attorney 
General. "
1052,1," The ALJ found that the Detroit situation was not one of a ""junior"" newspaper valiantly trying to retain a foothold in the market, 
see Majority Opinion at 1289, and that the characteristic elements pushing one paper into a ""downward spiral,"" see Majority 
Opinion at 1291-92 and 1295 n.12, did not exist in Detroit. See In the Matter of Detroit Free Press, Recommended Decision 95-
100 (Office of the Attorney General, No. 44-03-24-8, December 29, 1987) (""ALJ Report"") (discussing relationship between scale 
economies, downward spiral and junior paper concerns); id. at 112-113 (finding relationship not to exist in Detroit). Judge 
Silberman in his concurrence in the denial of rehearing en banc suggests that it is sufficient that the newspapers expressed a 
belief in the junior newspaper problem even if there were no facts to show this was a rational belief; the full quote from the ALJ's 
report is: ""The strategies pursued by the Free Press and News--future domination and profitability at the cost of current profits--
were perceived by management as economically rational given the history of the demise of junior papers which had entered the 
downward spiral. There is no convincing proof, however, that the economic conditions underlying this history--particularly the 
effects of scale economies--is applicable to these two large papers."" ALJ Report at 112-13 (emphasis added). The ALJ explicitly found that ""the objectives of dominance and future profitability were pursued by both papers (and their 
parents) in the belief that failure too had its reward in the form of JOA approval"" and that dominance was sought not by "
1053,," exploiting cost advantages but by cutting price below costs. Consequently, ""as one might expect, Detroit cannot sustain two 
profitable papers when both are practically being given away."" ALJ Report at 115."
1053,2," Judge Silberman in his concurrence (and in the majority opinion) appears to contest this basic factual finding. But the ALJ 
explicitly rejected the argument that there was evidence that Detroit is a natural monopoly. And the Attorney General stated: The 
Free Press ""plainly does not face external market forces -- such as rising costs, competition from other media outlets and the 
siphoning off of readers from the metropolitan region to the suburbs -- that would portend almost certain failure. Nor . . . do there 
exist marketplace declines in overall advertising and newspaper circulation in Detroit of the sort that traditionally propel a junior 
newspaper into the proverbial ""downward spiral"" that is fatal to survival."" Attorney General's Decision and Order, No. 44-03-24-8 
(August 8, 1988) at 8 (emphasis added). Moreover, Free Press management itself stated that ""one of the prerequisites to 
returning to profitability -- for both newspapers -- is restoring rational pricing in the market,""; in 1983 it ""projected from an 
economic model that under conditions of 'normalized competition' the Free Press would earn $ 1.5 million per year and the News 
$ 5 million."" ALJ Report at 85-86."
1053,3," Economists agree that predatory pricing is undertaken only if the predator expects competitors to shut down and no new entry 
into the market to occur. See, e.g., McGee, Bork, Areeda & Turner, supra. This analysis is of course crucially altered if a JOA is 
available, as the past behavior of these newspapers suggests. A JOA is precisely the type of guarantee that a potential 
monopolist needs to ensure that its rival will disappear for good. See Matsushita, infra, 475 U.S. at 591 n.15 and n.16, (barriers 
to entry can secure future profits needed to recoup losses sustained in driving competitor from market permanently). It is not at 
all ""inconsistent"" to argue that it is possible that unprofitable price-cutting will occur when a JOA protects a future monopoly but 
that such behavior is unlikely if such protection will be denied."
1053,4," Indeed, then Assistant Attorney General Douglas H. Ginsburg and Solicitor General Fried arguing for the government as 
amicus curiae urged the Court in Cargill to find predatory pricing schemes so inherently unlikely that a per se rule was justified 
""denying competitors standing to challenge acquisitions on the basis of predatory pricing theories."" 479 U.S. at 121. "
1054,5," The ALJ observed that ""predatory pricing"" was ""at least suggest[ed]"" by the record. ""To illustrate, it was a close question as to 
whether the Free Press or News would be designated the 'failing paper' for purposes of filing the JOA application. Finding 43. 
But the News's losses arose from such severe discounting that Gannett expressed concern over 'the potential problem of illegal 
advertising contracts entered into by the News and their advertisers during their war for ad volume.'"" ALJ Report at 122-123 
n.303."
1054,6," Whether the Attorney General would seek to prosecute such behavior independently under the antitrust laws is a separate 
question, which need not be answered in construing the statute."
1054,7," Judge Silberman suggests that we cannot consider this consequence of the Attorney General's decision because ""it was not 
raised by appellants."" It was, however, raised by the appellants. Appellants stated in their brief that ""as explained in more detail 
in the amicus curiae brief of Little Rock Newspapers, Inc., [the Attorney General's interpretation of the Act] would allow deep 
pocket newspaper owners to obtain a JOA almost at will . . . [A] corporation such as Gannett or Knight-Ridder that could afford 
short-term losses, could simply purchase a competing newspaper, and launch a price war by reducing circulation and 
advertising prices, which would force its competitor to do the same."" Brief for Appellants at 44. As the amicus brief explained 
further in its primary argument (certainly not limited to Little Rock) that ""The Newspaper Preservation Act Should Not Be 
Construed To Encourage Predatory Conduct:"" ""the Attorney General's approval of the JOA . . . rewards potentially predatory 
conduct."" ""The [interpretation] convert[s] the Newspaper Preservation Act from a vehicle for preserving journalistic competition 
where it would otherwise not exist into a vehicle to assist in eliminating competitive newspapers even where both newspapers 
otherwise could survive. . . . The danger evident from the Attorney General's approval of the JOA here is that it endorses the 
anticompetitive tactics used."" Brief for Amicus Curiae Little Rock Newspapers at 7; id. at 13. ""Such a result was clearly not 
intended by Congress."" Reply Brief of Appellants at 7 n.3. It hardly implicates case or controversy or separation of powers to 
point out that cutting prices to sustain current losses with the objective of eliminating a rival and securing monopoly, ""predatory 
conduct"" as it was termed by Little Rock, is presumably illegal under the antitrust laws. "
1057,1," Radiologists are licensed physicians who have completed special residency programs in radiology and have thereby become 
qualified in that particular medical specialty. The Second Amended Complaint defines radiology as ""the medical specialty 
concerned with the diagnostic and therapeutic use of X-rays, radium rays and other forms of radiant energy or its equivalent, in 
the diagnosis and treatment of disease or injury."" Second Amended Complaint, para. 5. The radiology services that plaintiffs 
seek to exclude from coverage in Blue Cross' hospital coverage contracts are non-interventional (i.e., non-surgical) inpatient 
diagnostic and therapeutic radiological services. For ease of reference, these will be referred to simply as ""radiology services."" "

1058,4," Kallstrom wrote, eleven years ago: Given the chance to run their natural courses, market incentives should draw insurance companies into the business of 
offering cost containment as a service to health care consumers. That insurance companies have not already undertaken to 
provide this service indicates that market forces have not been permitted to operate freely. At every turn in the road to cost-
control innovation insurers have been faced with barriers, often in the form of restrictive practices of organized medicine or 
of legislation created at the behest of the medical establishment. [Footnote omitted.] Kallstrom, supra, at 649. "
1059,5," Two other arguments made by the Radiologists in connection with their Section 1 claim have no basis in antitrust, and a third 
will be assumed by the Court to be correct for purposes of this motion. The argument that Blue Cross and hospitals ""are not 
legitimately concerned with physicians' fees"" has no basis in antitrust, unless it is an attack on Blue Cross' ban on direct billing, 
dealt with infra, pp. 711-13. Similarly, there is no antitrust basis for the argument that it is unreasonable for Blue Cross to buy 
radiology services from hospitals, given that Blue Cross chooses to buy no other physicians' services from hospitals; nothing in 
the antitrust laws requires buyers to be consistent. The Radiologists also argue that it is contrary to the hospitals' self interest to 
sell radiology services, given the additional administrative burden that entails; this argument is presumably made in support of 
the Radiologists' contention that Blue Cross has market power. The Court accepts as true, for purposes of this decision, the 
contention that Blue Cross has market power. See pp. 714-15 infra."
1059,6," It is difficult to tell from the Radiologists' submissions to the Court whether the Radiologists argue that Blue Cross should not be 
characterized as a ""buyer"" because it buys on behalf of subscribers. That argument would be unavailing. For antitrust purposes, 
Blue Cross is treated as a buyer where it pays the bill and seeks to set the amount to be charged. See Group Life & Health Ins.

1060,7," The only detriment to the Radiologists that is added by the hospital being an intermediary between the Radiologists and Blue 
Cross is that hospital costs are subject to governmental regulation that may have the effect of containing costs. See Affidavit of 
James Corcoran, Esq., New York State Superintendent of Insurance, July 12, 1988 (hereinafter ""Corcoran Aff.""), para. 31. This 
fact has no bearing on the analysis above."
1060,8," Blue Cross raised this argument previously in its motion to dismiss. At that time, the judge to whom the case was then assigned 
denied the motion to dismiss, holding that the contracts between Blue Cross and the hospitals in this case are expressly 
excluded from the holding in Kartell because Blue Cross was alleged to be a ""third force"" intervening in the relationship between 
the Radiologists and the hospitals. Westchester Radiological Assoc., P.C. v. Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Inc., 659 F. 
Supp. 132 (S.D.N.Y. 1987). For the reasons stated in this opinion, I believe that decision was erroneous and contrary to well-
established antitrust precedent. The Radiologists argue that the earlier decision constitutes law of the case and should not be disturbed. However, HN3[

law of the case doctrine ""merely expresses the practice of courts generally to refuse to reopen what has been decided, not a

1060,9," Counsel for the Radiologists are unaware of any case holding that an insurer acted as a ""third force"" under Kartell. Transcript of 
Oral Argument, January 5, 1989 (hereinafter ""Tr."") at 24-25. "
1061,10," The Radiologists cited no evidence in their papers or at oral argument that any of Blue Cross' competitors asked to buy from 
any hospital the same bundle of services that Blue Cross buys (Tr. at 6-7). Subsequent to oral argument, the Radiologists 
submitted the affidavits of a vice president at each of two hospitals (Affidavit of James Pierce, January 23, 1989; Affidavit of 
Sylvia Holtzberg, January 24, 1989). James Pierce attests that three health organizations sought the same terms as Blue Cross, 
and his hospital refused. Sylvia Holtzberg attests that one organization asked her hospital to include the services of hospital-
based physicians within the services provided to subscribers, and was refused. Neither affidavit explains why the hospitals 
refused, and neither affidavit claims that Blue Cross was in any way involved in the hospitals' decision."
1061,11," The Radiologists concede that when a hospital-based radiologist treats a patient who is not a Blue Cross subscriber, Blue 
Cross' contracts with the hospitals have no impact on the radiologist's ability to direct-bill that patient. Plaintiffs' Memorandum of 
Law in Opposition, p. 12. It is only when a hospital-based radiologist provides services to a Blue Cross subscriber that the 
radiologist is forbidden to direct-bill patients."
1061,12," Furthermore, although Blue Cross makes the decision to include or exclude radiology services in its Blue Cross coverage, the 
evidence is clear that Blue Cross does not unilaterally fix the price of the hospital services as the Radiologists claim; New York 
State sets the price. See pp. 714-15 infra."
1061,13," See, Brillhart, 768 F.2d at 201: The antitrust laws do not prohibit a buyer from bargaining for the best deal possible. As the district court noted, the conduct 
by Blue Shield in the present case is not the type of conduct that the antitrust laws were intended to prohibit. This 
conclusion is especially true where there is no suggestion that Blue Shield ever conspired with any other health care insurer 
to set prices, where nonparticipating doctors remain free to charge their patients whatever price that they choose, and 
where participating doctors remain free to charge non-Blue Shield subscribers whatever price they choose. In sum, the 
provider agreement in this case does not violate the antitrust laws."

1062,16," Because I hold that the alleged conduct does not violate the antitrust laws, I need not reach the issue of whether Blue Cross 
would have a valid state action defense and make no decision thereon."
1062,17," See NCAA v. Board of Regents, 468 U.S. at 107; Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 343, 99 S. Ct. 2326, 60 L. Ed. 2d

1062,18," ""The real danger for the law is less that predation will be missed than that normal competitive behavior will be wrongly 
classified as predatory and suppressed."" Bork, supra, at 157."
1062,19," The Court notes the difficulty in determining Blue Cross' market share. Blue Cross calculates its market share by determining 
the percentage of hospitals' net inpatient revenues attributable to Blue Cross; Blue Cross estimates its market share to be just 
over 20% using this calculation. Affidavit of Jerry Weissman, July 27, 1988, para. 40. Blue Cross bases its estimate on State 
Department of Health Reports, which it concedes include hospital revenues from all payors, including donations and payments 
from governments. Tr. at 46. The Radiologists counter with the deposition testimony of a few hospital administrators who 
estimate the percentage of their hospitals' total revenues attributable to Blue Cross to be approximately 30%. However, this 
figure represents Blue Cross' economic power in only a small percentage of the hospitals involved. The Radiologists deposed 
approximately six hospital administrators, only some of whom were asked about the percentage of funds attributable to Blue 
Cross; there are more than sixty hospitals in the Downstate area. The Radiologists agree that the percentage of hospital revenues is the appropriate measure of Blue Cross' economic power over 
the hospitals, but argue that the appropriate measure of Blue Cross' market power vis-a-vis its competitors is the percentage of 
persons in the Downstate region who are covered by Blue Cross, or the percentage of persons in the Downstate region with 
medical coverage who are covered by Blue Cross. Tr. at 50-52. Using this calculation, the Radiologists estimate Blue Cross' 
market share at 80% to 90%. However, as Blue Cross pointed out at oral argument, ""double counting"" is in part responsible for 
its high market share. Many consumers are covered by more than one hospital insurance policy. Tr. at 56-57, 64. For example, 
some consumers may purchase 60-day Blue Cross hospital coverage, and supplemental coverage from another company. The "
1063,," Radiologists have counted anyone who has some Blue Cross coverage as a Blue Cross subscriber. The parties have not 
produced the information regarding Blue Cross' competitors' coverage that would be required to eliminate this double-counting 
(indeed, the information may be unavailable to them). In addition, the parties disagree as to the inclusion of ""uninsurables"" in the number of persons covered by Blue Cross; there is 
no competition for these community rated subscribers. Blue Cross estimates that 45% of its subscribers are community rated 
subscribers. The parties also disagree on the propriety of including Medicare funds in the calculation of Blue Cross' market share. Tr. at 46-
47. Part A of Medicare provides hospital insurance coverage for individuals who qualify for monthly Social Security benefits as 
well as for certain disabled persons. 42 U.S.C.A. § 1395c. Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc(a)(1)(A), Part A providers agree not 
to charge individuals covered by Medicare for the inpatient services rendered to them. Instead the providers accept 
reimbursement from the trust fund, in amounts calculated under Medicare regulations by the Health Care Financing 
Administration or, at the option of the provider, by private organizations under contract with HCFA. These private parties (fiscal 
intermediaries) act as agents of HHS in administering the Medicare Program. Blue Cross is an approved Medicare fiscal intermediary. It is therefore responsible for the payment of substantial sums of 
Medicare funds to the hospitals. However, as a fiscal intermediary, Blue Cross serves only as a ""conduit,"" and cannot resolve 
policy questions. Heckler v. Community Health Services, 467 U.S. 51, 64-65, 104 S. Ct. 2218, 81 L. Ed. 2d 42 (1984). The 
Radiologists point out, however, that since Blue Cross is the conduit for these funds, Blue Cross can control the timing of 
Medicare payments to hospitals. Tr. at 53. On the other hand, no hospital is required to select Blue Cross as its fiscal 
intermediary; at least sixteen hospitals in the Downstate New York area have chosen an approved fiscal intermediary other than 
Blue Cross. Finally, the Court notes that it has been suggested that health insurers' bargaining power may not be as great as their size 
suggests, because pressure from their individual subscribers would prevent them from, e.g., disallowing reimbursement at 90% 
of the hospitals in an area. ""Joint Provider Activities Affecting Price,"" supra, at 74 n.218."
1063,20," The Radiologists point to a remark by Mr. Lovett of Blue Cross, to the effect that direct billing by radiologists would imperil Blue 
Cross' market share (presumably by making Blue Cross coverage less valuable). Minutes of Meeting of Hospital Review 
Committee of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Greater New York, April 4, 1984, at 4. Whether or not Mr. Lovett is correct, this 
statement alone is not probative of any unlawful conduct on the part of Blue Cross. Even if this remark showed an intention on 
Mr. Lovett's or Blue Cross' part to limit competition, "". . . an admitted intention to limit competition will not make illegal conduct 
that we know to be pro-competitive or otherwise immune from antitrust control."" 7 Areeda, supra para. 1506 at 391. "
1064,21," Faced with the reality that Blue Shield gets no cost advantage from Blue Cross' purchase of radiology services, the 
Radiologists attempted to reformulate their theory of injury (this new theory was raised for the first time at oral argument on this 
motion, more than three and one-half years after this litigation began). They now argue that Blue Shield is a less efficient claims 
handler than its competitors, and that Blue Cross, by shielding Blue Shield from the need to process the Radiologists' bills, 
harms Blue Shield's competitors by making radiology bills ""one area [in] which they do not get to demonstrate their competitive 
advantage, the better administration. . . ."" Tr. at 34. Thus, the Radiologists argue, Blue Shield gains a competitive advantage by 
having ""one less area to screw up in."" Id. In addition, while acknowledging that all medical insurers benefit from Blue Cross' 
purchase of radiology services, the Radiologists argue that if medical insurers had to pay radiology bills, the additional burden 
would be more costly for Blue Shield than for its competitors because Blue Shield is less efficient than its competitors; Blue 
Shield would then have to increase its premiums by a greater amount than would its competitors. The Radiologists have offered no evidence that Blue Shield is less efficient than its competitors. After oral argument, the 
Radiologists submitted three documents purporting to demonstrate Blue Shield's inefficiency. Plaintiff's Post-Argument Affidavit, 
Exs. D, E, and F. Although these documents reflect some consumer dissatisfaction with both Blue Cross and Blue Shield (eg.: 
""Both carriers draw particularly heavy criticism on the time required to process claims, . . . ."" Plaintiff's Post-Argument Affidavit, 
Ex. E at VII), none of these documents contains any data concerning Blue Shield's costs or efficiency in comparison to Blue 
Shield's competitors. Any argument based on an assumption that Blue Shield would be inefficient in handling radiology claims as 
compared to Blue Shield's competitors is pure speculation and unsupported by evidence. In addition, as with the Radiologists' original leveraging claim, there is no evidence that Blue Cross purchases radiology services 
for the purpose of denying Blue Shield this opportunity to fail."
1064,22," Even if Blue Cross decided in 1978 to persist in its long-standing policy, for the purpose of injuring Blue Shield's competitors, 
its persistence is not paying off. The number of Blue Shield subscribers has declined every year save one since its consolidation 
with Blue Cross. Defendant's Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment, p. 48. Its market share has 
declined as well. Even the Radiologists' counsel estimates that Blue Shield's market share in the medical service insurance 
market has fallen from 50% to 30% in the past five or ten years. Tr. at 32. "
1068,1," Actually, there have been four decisions, but one was so short that I won't count it. "
1069,2," All of them so moved except Bloomfield Realty, Inc., which recently filed for protection under the bankruptcy code. Market 
Force has agreed to dismiss Bloomfield without prejudice. Earlier in this litigation, Stefaniak Realty was dismissed by stipulation."
1069,3," According to a study that Market Force cites, 72% of home buyers surveyed believed that selling agents were their own agents; 
73% told these agents the highest amount they would be willing to pay, and 83% thought such information would remain 
confidential. FTC Los Angeles Regional Office, The Residential Real Estate Brokerage Industry 70, 78 (1983). "
1070,4," His concern was that listing brokers and sellers are exposed to ""additional liability"" when buyers' agents, as opposed to selling 
agents, assist buyers. In retrospect, this concern seems unfounded because neither sellers nor listing brokers are likely to be 
held responsible for the activities or representations of buyers' agents, at least not where all agents disclose the identity of their 
principals. "
1071,5," Wauwatosa Realty placed more than 4,700 listings into the MLS computer in 1987. "
1072,6," His testimony might have mentioned other companies, but I cannot tell from the limited portions of the transcript that were 
provided to me. "
1073,7," Counsel did not provide data for Century 21 Cambridge or Dean Realty. It appears from the MLS computer sheet that 
Cambridge placed 0.38% of all listings, but I cannot decipher a number for Dean Realty. "
1075,8," In this regard, it is worth noting that some home buyers employ lawyers or property inspectors to help them make their 
purchases. The buyers in such instances pay these agents directly. "
1083,1," Tomberlin also filed a counterclaim and third-party complaint against Community Hospital and HCA, alleging that they had also 
violated §§ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act and that they had committed several torts under Alabama law. Tomberlin's 
claims were dismissed prior to trial."
1083,2," As the Supreme Court went on to explain in National Collegiate Athletic Assn., The Sherman Act was designed to be a comprehensive charter of economic liberty aimed at preserving free and unfettered 
competition as the rule of trade. It rests on the premise that the unrestrained interaction of competitive forces will yield the 
best allocation of our economic resources, the lowest prices, the highest quality and the greatest material progress, while at 
the same time providing an environment conducive to the preservation of our democratic political and social institutions."
1083,468," U.S. at 104 n. 27, 104 S. Ct. at 2962 n. 27, quoting Northern Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 4-5, 78 S. Ct. 514, 
517-18, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1958). "
1084,3," At times, Tomberlin appears to suggest that anticompetitive behavior should be tolerated here simply because a hospital and a 
doctor are involved. HN2[
] The Supreme Court has, however, repeatedly ""refused to tolerate manifestly anticompetitive 
conduct simply because the health care industry is involved."" Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 25 n. 
42, 104 S. Ct. 1551, 1565 n. 42, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2 (1984)."
1084,4," Both parties agree on the definition of the job market. The parties also agree that the product involved is diagnostic -- as 
opposed to therapeutic -- radiological services. Diagnostic services include x-ray, nuclear medicine, and ultrasound procedures. Tomberlin, however, contends that the patient market should extend geographically to all of Covington County, which is served 
by three hospitals, including two in Andualusia and one just across the Florida border. See Tampa Electric Co., 365 U.S. at 327, 
81 S. Ct. at 628 (the geographic market is the area in which the consumer can practically turn for alternative supplies of the 
relevant product). Tomberlin also contends that there is no specific market for radiological services because such services 
cannot be separated from hospital services. Cf. Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2, 466 U.S. at 19, 104 S. Ct. at 1562 
(""whether one or two products are involved turns not on the functional relation between them, but rather on the character of the 
demand for the two items"").  Tomberlin also contends that the product market should include not only x-rays furnished by 
Tomberlin but x-rays furnished by family practice physicians in Andalusia as well. Since Community Hospital cannot prevail in 
this lawsuit, even under its definition of patient market, the court need not resolve this definitional dispute. "
1085,5," Since Tomberlin wants to keep his contracts exclusive, he obviously does not make this argument either. To this extent, this 
lawsuit could be considered collusive, in that neither party may be fully presenting the viewpoint of patients, the group whose 
market is being analyzed. Both Tomberlin and Community Hospital suggest that the Andalusia area is too small to support more than one radiologist. 
However, because neither of them really wants more than one radiologist in the area, their suggestion is suspect. "
1086,6," The court should not be understood as saying that length of contract is not a relevant consideration in analyzing an antitrust 
claim. For example, if Community Hospital had established an impermissible lessening of competition within the radiology job 
market due to its exclusive contract with Tomberlin, see e.g., Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. at 30 n. 
51, 104 S. Ct. at 1568 n. 51, the court could have at least two choices, depending on the circumstances: voiding the 
exclusiveness feature in the contract or reforming the contract's length to five years, as an alternative, less restructured means 
of meeting the hospital's need for an exclusive contract, assuming that need is legitimate. But in this hypothetical, unlike in the 
actual lawsuit filed by Community Hospital, the relief would specifically address the challenged market, not some other market. Also, if Community Hospital had presented some evidence that the length of Tomberlin's contract specifically affected the patient 
market, then the contract's length would be a relevant focus here. For example, the hospital might have made a showing that the 
Andalusia area could comfortably support more than one radiologist and that, but for the extreme length in Tomberlin's exclusive 
contracts with the two hospitals, other radiologists would be attracted to the area. In contrast in this lawsuit, the two factors -- 
that Tomberlin's contracts with the two hospitals are exclusive and that the market, as Community Hospital defines it, can only 
support one radiologist -- so totally and securely restricts competition within the patient market, that the length of the two 
contracts is irrelevant. "
1094,1," For purposes of this Order, all defendants will be collectively referred to as ""MSC""."
1094,2," The five employees are Nima Bakhtiary, Glen Hultgren, Raj Kansakar, Vinh Lam, and Hemant Patel. "
1095,3," The initial complaint contained eighteen counts, several of which were state law statutory and common law causes of action. 
On December 30, 1987, the Court dismissed the pendent common law claims and ordered plaintiff to amend the complaint. The 
instant complaint was filed on January 15, 1988 alleging only the federal antitrust claims. That same day, plaintiff commenced a 
companion state court action alleging the state statutory and common law claims which were originally brought in this Court. The 
state action is, of course, based upon the same alleged facts as this action."
1095,4," UAI at one point alleged that discovery was improperly restricted and that this impaired its ability to properly oppose this 
motion. However, on September 19, 1988 at a hearing on this motion, UAI waived all discovery objections. "
1097,5," UAI argues that this hearsay evidence is admissible under the co-conspirator exception. In support of this argument, UAI points 
to United States v. Hernandez, 829 F.2d 988, 993 (10th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 1013, 108 S. Ct. 1486, 99 L. Ed. 2d 
714 (1988) where the Tenth Circuit held that a Court may look at hearsay statements between alleged conspirators for the 
purpose of laying the necessary foundation to use the co-conspirator exception. Nevertheless, the hearsay statements cannot 
alone form the foundation for the application of the exception.  United States v. Gordon, 844 F.2d 1397, 1402 (9th Cir. 1988). No 
additional evidence of a conspiracy has been offered."
1097,6," The Court agrees with Professors Areeda and Turner who state in their treatise that, absent egregious circumstances, HN7[
] 
common law business torts will rarely result in the harmful effects on competition necessary to form the basis for antitrust 
liability. See generally, 3 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law, paras. 737-39, at 276-87 (1978). The remedy for such torts lies 
in state court. "
1098,7," In deposition, several of these employees expressed dissatisfaction with the treatment they received from UAI management 
and also complained about their low salary and long commute time."
1098,8," In Annot., 24 A.L.R.3d 821, 824 (1969) it is stated: HN8[
] In order to establish a defendant's liability for inducing an employee to move to a competitor, it is generally 
necessary for the plaintiff to allege and prove that the defendant has actively attempted to persuade the employee to 
change jobs; and the competitor-defendant can prevail if he is able to show that the employee, in seeking employment with 
the competitor, acted solely on his own initiative, without having been solicited either by the competitor or by anyone acting 
in the competitor's behalf, and that the competitor was merely receptive to the employee's own suggestions. See also Hollingsworth Solderless Terminal Co. v. Turley, 622 F.2d 1324, 1337 (9th Cir. 1980) (Court reverses summary 
judgment for defendant in employee solicitation case and assumes for purposes of the motion that defendant solicited the 
employees. Issue was whether defendant engaged in some concomitant unconscionable conduct); Operations Research, Inc. v. 
Davidson & Talbird, Inc., 241 Md. 550, 217 A.2d 375 (1966) (affirming trial court's findings that defendants did not solicit 
plaintiff's employees, but rather that the employees who left the plaintiff sought out the defendants, were anxious to work for 
them, and applied for employment with them without any specifications as to salary or type of work). "
1099,9," At a hearing on August 8, 1988, the Court acknowledged the confidentiality problems related to disclosure of the particular 
trade secrets allegedly misappropriated by MSC. The Court suggested that UAI may wish to disclose the nature of these alleged 
secrets to a neutral expert. UAI rejected this proposal and expressly conceded that the thrust of its case does not lie in its 
allegations regarding misappropriation of trade secrets. "
1100,10," More recently, in William Inglis & Sons Baking Co. v. ITT Continental Baking Co., 668 F.2d 1014 (9th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 
459 U.S. 825, 74 L. Ed. 2d 61, 103 S. Ct. 57 (1982), the Ninth Circuit adopted a more flexible test for predatory pricing. The 
court stated that HN12[
] ""to establish predatory pricing a plaintiff must prove that the anticipated benefits of defendant's price 
depended on its tendency to discipline or eliminate competition and thereby enhance the firm's long-term ability to reap the 
benefits of monopoly power."" Id. at 1035. Thus, it is conceivable that a claim of predatory pricing could be sustained where 
defendant's price was not below marginal or average variable cost. However, in cases where defendant's price was above 
average variable cost, the Inglis court stated that ""plaintiff bears the burden of showing defendant's pricing was predatory."" Id. at 
1035-36 (emphasis added). Plaintiff in this case has failed to produce any evidence from which the Court could determine 
whether it has made out a prima facie case of predatory pricing. Under Celotex, summary judgment is appropriate since plaintiff 
has failed to ""make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to [its] case, and on which [it] will bear 
the burden of proof at trial."" Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322. This case is analogous to Hanson, where the Ninth Circuit upheld a directed verdict for defendant on plaintiff's attempted 
monopoly claim based on allegations of predatory pricing because plaintiff ""made no effort to prove that the prices defendant 
was charging . . . were below marginal or average variable costs . . . ."" 541 F.2d at 1358. Hanson has not been overruled and 
this Court finds it persuasive."
1100,11," Specifically, UAI alleged that MSC was approached by CDC and offered over one million dollars to convert MSC/Nastran to 
operate on CDC's new computer. MSC initially declined CDC's offer. Subsequently, UAI accepted CDC's offer, and converted 
UAI/Nastran to work on the CDC computer. Thereafter, allegedly for no charge, MSC converted MSC/Nastran to work on the 
CDC computer. UAI contends that this sequence of events demonstrates that MSC acted with the intent to compete with UAI in 
its dealings with CDC. A similar series of factual allegations was made by UAI with regard to the DEC conversions. MSC initially declined to convert 
MSC/Nastran to the DEC computer. Once UAI began negotiating with DEC to perform the conversions, MSC allegedly agreed to 
convert MSC/Nastran at no charge. Once again, UAI submits that this conduct on MSC's part demonstrates a predatory intent to 
prevent UAI from competing in the Nastran market. MSC controverted many of the facts UAI submit in support of these conversion allegations. More importantly, however, is the 
undisputed fact that MSC did not accept any money for performing the conversions. They were research and development 
activities. That MSC decided to perform the conversions only after UAI had some success with the new computers cannot make 
otherwise lawful conduct unlawful. To the contrary, MSC was only increasing competition in the Nastran market by performing 
the conversions. "
1101,12," The four instances are: (1) an unidentified longtime MSC consultant stated in front of an unidentified UAI customer that UAI 
was a training ground for MSC; (2) that same unidentified consultant made sarcastic references about the instant lawsuit in front 
of the same UAI customer; (3) Raj Kansaker, while still employed at UAI, told a UAI customer that he would be leaving UAI to go 
to work at MSC; and (4) Defendant Gloudeman and/or unidentified persons made unspecified derogatory references regarding 
UAI's financial condition. "
1102,13," Whether conduct was motivated by a legitimate business purpose is not always a jury question. Oahu, 838 F.2d at 360; 
California Computer, 613 F.2d at 744."
1102,14," In their treatise, Professors Areeda and Turner state: HN15[
] Hiring talent cannot generally be held exclusionary even if it does weaken actual or potential rivals and 
strengthen a monopolist. There is a high social and personal interest in maintaining a freely functioning market for talent. It 
should flow to occupations in which it can be used most profitably, and we greatly value the individual's freedom to enjoy 
whatever employment opportunities the market offers. . . . Acquiring talent not to use it but to deny it to possible rivals is exclusionary. . . . In the absence, therefore, of the 
monopolist's proved subjective intent to hire talent preclusively or of clear non-use in fact, employment should not be held 
exclusionary. P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law, para. 702, at 109-10 (1978). As stated above, it is undisputed that MSC is using the 
former UAI employees in Nastran-related areas. The Court agrees with Professors Areeda & Turner that, in such a case, MSC's 
conduct does not violate the antitrust laws. See also Adjusters Replace-A-Car, Inc. v. Agency Rent-A-Car, Inc., 735 F.2d 884, 
894 (5th Cir. 1984) HN16[
] (""mere hiring away of employees from a rival is lawful . . . . The fact that the employee then uses 
her own skills and contacts -- and not, for example, misappropriated trade secrets -- to generate business for her new employer, 
even at the expense of her old employer, provides no basis for antitrust liability""), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1160, 105 S. Ct. 910, 83 
L. Ed. 2d 924 (1985). In opposition to this motion, UAI relies on a line of older decisions from other circuits which found that business torts, including 
employee raiding, could constitute per se violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. See, e.g., Albert Pick-Barth Co. v. Mitchell 
Woodbury Corp., 57 F.2d 96 (1st Cir. 1932); Perryton Wholesale v. Pioneer Distrib. Co., 353 F.2d 618 (10th Cir. 1965), cert. 
denied, 383 U.S. 945, 86 S. Ct. 1202, 16 L. Ed. 2d 208 (1966); Atlantic Heel Co. v. Allied Heel Co., 284 F.2d 879 (1st Cir. 1960). These cases are not persuasive for several reasons. First, they have been discredited or distinguished in later decisions of the 
courts that rendered them. See George R. Whitten, Jr. v. Paddock Pool Bldrs., 508 F.2d 547, 561 (1st Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 
421 U.S. 1004, 95 S. Ct. 2407, 44 L. Ed. 2d 673 (1975); Craig v. Sun Oil Co., 515 F.2d 221, 224 (10th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 
429 U.S. 829, 97 S. Ct. 88, 50 L. Ed. 2d 92 (1976). Second, the facts of those cases demonstrate much more egregious conduct 
than UAI has been able to attribute to MSC. Third, Professors Areeda and Turner also disapprove of those decisions. 3 P. 
Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law, para. 828, at 323 (1978). Finally, the decisions were not issued by the Ninth Circuit and, to 
the extent they remain good law, they are not binding upon this Court. "
1125,1," Since we conclude that the antitrust claims in Community Electric's complaint and its opposition to summary judgment were not

not frivolous. "
1151,1, Defendants do not claim that the amended complaint fails to allege that the other defendants violated these provisions. 
1160,2," Section 814.025, Wis. Stats, provides: (1) If an action or special proceeding commenced or continued by a plaintiff or a counterclaim, defense or cross complaint 
commenced, used or continued by a defendant is found, at any time during the proceedings or upon judgment, to be 
frivolous by the court, the court shall award to the successful party costs determined under §814.04 and reasonable 
attorney fees. "
1161,," (2) The costs and fees awarded under sub. (1) may be assessed fully against either the party bringing the action, special 
proceeding, cross complaint, defense or counterclaim or the attorney representing the party or may be assessed so that the 
party and the attorney each pay a portion of the costs and fees. (3) In order to find an action, special [*45]  proceeding, counterclaim, defense or cross complaint to be frivolous under sub. 
(1), the court must find one or more of the following: (a) The action, special proceeding, counterclaim, defense or cross complaint was commenced, used or continued in bad 
faith, solely for purposes of harassing or maliciously injuring another. (b) The party or the party's attorney knew, or should have known, that the action, special proceeding, counterclaim, defense 
or cross complaint was without any reasonable basis in law or equity and could not be supported by a good faith argument 
for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law."
1161,3," Defendants do not raise the issue of damages, but the Court would note that the plaintiff has put forth an affidavit that it spent 
more than $20,000 in legal fees in defending Case No. 84-CV-611. "
1173,1," Shortly after Judge Mukasey granted the preliminary injunction, the British Secretary of State for Trade and Industry referred 
the Minorco bid to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (""MMC"") for investigation of the takeover's potential anticompetitive 
consequences in the United Kingdom with respect to strategic metals such as titanium and zircon. During the MMC's 
investigation, Minorco was prohibited under British law from proceeding with the tender offer. On February 2, 1989, the MMC 
announced that the proposed acquisition of Gold Fields would not operate against the British public interest. The MMC decision 
leaves the District Court's preliminary injunction as the only legal obstacle to consummation of Minorco's offer. On February 21, 
Minorco announced a new offer of $ 5.65 billion for the outstanding shares of Gold Fields, an increase over its initial bid of $ 4.9 
billion. Minorco has informed us that it will not purchase shares pursuant to the new offer unless the injunction is vacated or 
modified."
1173,2," Section 7 provides in pertinent part: No corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any part of the stock or other share 
capital . . . of another corporation. . . where in any line of commerce in any section of the country, the effect of such 
acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition, or tend to create a monopoly."
1173,15, U.S.C. § 18 (1982). 
1174,3," At oral argument, appellant's counsel was asked whether Minorco wanted a remand for an evidentiary hearing. Appellant later 
informed the Court that it no longer desired a hearing. "
1175,4," Section 16 provides, in pertinent part: Any . . . corporation . . . shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief, in any court of the United States having 
jurisdiction over the parties, against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws. . . ."
1175,15, U.S.C. § 26 (1982). 
1176,5," The dissenting opinion of Judge Altimari points out that the injury complained of by Gold Fields would occur even if the total 
market share of the combining corporations were only two per cent. If suit were brought on such insubstantial facts, the target 
would still have standing to claim that it was injured by a section 7 violation, but it would lose on the merits, probably for failure to 
state a claim and surely on summary judgment. A litigant need not have a winning claim to have standing. "
1177,6," HN12[
] Although the Supreme Court requires a showing of ""antitrust injury"" in both injunction and damage cases, it has 
specifically said that ""standing analysis under § 16 will not always be identical to standing analysis under § 4."" Cargill v. Monfort 
of Colorado, Inc., supra, 479 U.S. at 111 n.6. Since section 4 allows for treble-damage recovery, courts will generally be more 
circumspect about granting relief: ""In order to protect against multiple lawsuits and duplicative recoveries, courts should examine 
other factors in addition to antitrust injury, such as the potential for duplicative recovery, the complexity of apportioning damages, 
and the existence of other parties that have been more directly harmed, to determine whether a party is a proper plaintiff under § 
4."" Id.; see also Associated General Contractors of California, Inc. v. Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 544-45, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723, 103 S. 
Ct. 897 (1983). Conversely, HN13[
] since relief is equitable under section 16 and ""'one injunction is as effective as 100, ""' Cargill v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., supra, 479 U.S. at 111 n.6 (quoting Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., 405 U.S. 251, 261, 31 L. Ed. 
2d 184, 92 S. Ct. 885 (1972)), these other factors relevant to section 4 standing analysis ""are not relevant under § 16."" Id. Thus 
Cargill supports the proposition that standing analysis under section 16 is still less rigorous than that under section 4. We 
therefore do not read Cargill to have weakened the Court's prior holding that section 16 is imbued with a special public policy 
dimension: Section 16 should be construed and applied with this purpose [enforcing the antitrust laws] in mind, and with the knowledge 
that the remedy it affords, like other equitable remedies, is flexible and capable of nice ""adjustment and reconciliation 
between the public interest and private needs as well as between competing private claims."" Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U.S.

1207,1," Defendants submitted an alternative method for computing market share which indicates that National Benefit's percentage of 
the market ranges from 6.8% to 15%. See Wyse Affidavit dated February 3, 1989. "
1210,1," The Government has apparently made previous payments of $ 825,611.25. Thus, the effect of this Order is to direct the 
payment of an additional $ 907,088.75."
1210,2," In the stipulation, Mr. Boggs stated that his hourly rate in 1978 was ""normally $ 60 per hour."" The stipulation was contained in a 
document presented to a Maryland District Court for approval of a settlement agreement relating to litigation lasting several 
years. According to Mr. Boggs' affidavit filed in this matter: "
1211,," The stipulation was not intended to suggest that at that time I had an established hourly billing rate which I charged and 
was paid by non-contingent clients. Instead, it was simply a rate selected to demonstrate that the settlement [of the Bryant 
litigation] was fair and appropriate. In selecting that rate, I did not make any effort to establish what an appropriate market 
rate would have been for an attorney of my experience and expertise. Boggs Aff. at para. 3 (Plaintiffs' Exhibit I(A))."
1211,3," See Defendant's Resp. to Plaintiffs' Supp. Mem. at 5 (July 12, 1988)(""The $ 60 hourly rate for the services of class counsel in 
1978 is the only accurate, fair, and consistent statement of the value of [Mr. Boggs] services."")."
1211,4," See Laffey, 746 F.2d at 18 (""By setting the fee award at the attorney's customary billing rate, the opportunity cost of foregone 
representations is precisely offset by a fee award in the same amount.""). "
1212,5," The Solicitor General, as amicus curiae, had argued in Blum that a cost-based standard should be adopted for calculating fee 
awards to public interest attorneys, as costs alone would be sufficient to attract such attorneys to civil rights cases. Blum, 465 
U.S. at 893 (according to the Solicitor General market rates ""include an element of profit unnecessary to attract nonprofit 
counsel""). The Supreme Court expressly rejected this position in favor of market rates for all attorneys, regardless of cupidity."
1212,6," Although the Government is somewhat unclear on this point, it apparently suggests that Mr. Boggs be compensated at a rate 
for the other years which bears the same relation to the prevailing market rate as $ 60 per hour bears to the prevailing market 
rate in 1978."
1212,7," Even if this were not the case, and if the 1978 Bryant stipulation were legally relevant, the Court finds that the stipulation 
provides insufficient evidence of Mr. Boggs' ""customary billing rate."" As the plaintiffs clearly show, the stipulation was the by-
product of a negotiated settlement of litigation which encompassed several years. By its very nature, then, the rate contained in 
the stipulation was likely not the rate Mr. Boggs would have charged an actual client, in the same way that a settlement sum 
rarely reflects either parties' estimation of the amount of damages actually incurred in a lawsuit. Instead, as with a settlement 
sum, Mr. Boggs' rate likely reflects the best that he could obtain through negotiation -- i.e., his actual estimate of the value of his 
services, discounted by the probability that his client would not be a ""prevailing party"" in the Bryant litigation. Accordingly, the 
Court is unwilling to conclude that the stipulation accurately represents Mr. Boggs' ""customary billing rate."" Furthermore, it is simply incorrect to speak in terms of a ""customary billing rate"" when referring to Mr. Boggs' practice. Unlike the 
attorneys in Laffey and Cumberland Mountains, but like the attorneys in Blum, Mr. Boggs is a ""pure"" public interest lawyer. He 
does not charge, and never has charged, any of his clients for his services. Although Mr. Boggs and his organization receive 
contributions, as well as awards of attorney's fees in successful litigation of this type, no money changes hands between Mr. 
Boggs and his clients. Thus, the concept of a ""customary"" or ""established"" billing rate is meaningless in the context of Mr. Boggs' 
practice. "
1213,8," The record in McKenzie, including the affidavits submitted in support of the reasonableness of the Hogan & Hartson rates, were 
also made part of the record in this matter."
1213,9," As with most of the proof plaintiffs have offered in this proceeding, nearly all of the affidavits were originally executed in 
connection with previous fee litigation in this Court. "
1214,10," The Government's brief quoted from the Supreme Court's seminal antitrust opinion in Brown Shoe Co., Inc. v. United States, 
370 U.S. 294, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510, 82 S. Ct. 1502 (1962), in suggesting the proper market analysis: ""The outer boundaries of a 
product market are determined by the reasonable interchangeability of use or the cross-elasticity of demand between the 
product itself and substitutes for it."" Defendant's Mem. at 13.  The Government further quoted from Brown Shoe in proposing 
that the District's pool of attorneys be further refined into submarkets for the purpose of assessing attorney's fees: Within this broad market, well-defined submarkets may exist which, in themselves, constitute product markets. . . . The 
boundaries of such a submarket may be determined by examining such practical indicia as industry or public recognition . . 
. of the product's peculiar characteristics and uses . . . distinct customers [and] distinct prices . . . . Defendant's Mem. at 14 (quoting Brown Shoe, 370 U.S. at 325)."
1214,11," The Court notes as an aside that the Government's antitrust argument, relying as it does upon the concept of submarkets, 
may well shoot the Government in the foot. The Government seeks to divide the District of Columbia attorney market into ""risk-
averse,"" elite practitioners on the one hand, and less stable and experienced contingent practitioners on the other. The 
Government would look to whatever the latter submarket requires by way of risk enhancement, if anything, and compensate the 
plaintiffs at that level. It is worth noting, however, that the plaintiffs were throughout this litigation represented by counsel which 
clearly fall within the class of established, ""risk-averse"" practitioners who require a substantial contingency enhancement. Thus, 
if we are playing the submarket game, it would seem that this case would fall within the market which the plaintiffs' proof has, in 
fact, addressed. The ""relevant market,"" given the actual facts of this case, might well be that which the plaintiffs' proof has 
effectively defined. If that is so, the Government's argument would have the unintended effect of providing a more precise and 
technical basis for awarding the plaintiffs the 100% contingency enhancement they seek. "
1215,12," Obviously, statistical invalidity and faulty sampling practices are relevant to determining whether the standard of proof has 
been met. They are not, however, as the Government seems to suggest, dispositive."
1215,13," See, e.g., Black Grievance Comm. v. Philadelphia Elec. Co., 690 F. Supp. 1393, 1401 (E.D. Pa. 1988) (rejecting contention 
that statistical invalidity of plaintiffs' random affidavit evidence bars contingency enhancement; ""while plaintiffs' evidence is not . . 
. statistically significant, it does meet the requirements of Delaware Valley II"")."
1215,14," The study evaluated billing practices by geographic location, i.e., the Northeast, and did not categorize its results in terms of 
particular metropolitan areas. Thus, although information from Washington firms is included in the survey, information specific to 
Washington is lacking."
1215,15," Justice O'Connor continued, in language worth quoting: ""Haphazard and widely divergent compensation for risk can be 
avoided only if contingency cases are treated as a class; and contingency cases can be treated as a class only if courts strive for 
consistency from one fee determination to the next."" 107 S. Ct. at 3090."
1215,16," See, e.g., King v. Palmer, slip op. at 4 (""Justice O'Connor's opinion suggests, if it does not mandate, that each court let a 
determination such as Judge Smith's control future cases such as this one.""). "
1216,17," See, e.g., Deposition of Jane Lang McGrew at 29 (""I very much enjoy my work in the Title VII area. I think I am very 
knowledgeable and an effective lawyer in this area. But I wouldn't touch one against the government because of the difficulty in 
getting paid for that work.""); Supp. Aff. of Roderic V.O. Boggs at 2 (""In 1972 and 1973, although there were at that time 
approximately 11,000 members of the District of Columbia Bar, the Lawyers' Committee had only identified approximately six 
law firms willing to consider taking class action employment discrimination cases on a contingent fee basis. The overwhelming 
majority of District of Columbia firms (and attorneys) were unwilling to handle such cases unless they were paid their normal 
hourly rates on a noncontingent basis."")."
1216,18," As the plaintiffs point out, the Government's evidence on this point proves little except that it has been a Title VII defendant 
with great frequency. Plaintiffs' Reply at 31. "
1217,19," The participation of private firms and practitioners is crucial, as they most often enjoy the resources and continuity of 
personnel to properly prosecute the action."
1217,20," The Government also implies that a contingency enhancement for the Lawyers' Committee is not necessary because of its 
status as a public interest organization; according to the Government, a public interest organization receives ""enhancement"" in 
the form of market rates, and no additional enhancement is required to attract the services of such an organization. The 
Government cites United States v. State of Washington, 626 F. Supp. 1405, 1524 (W.D. Wash. 1985)(non-profit attorneys not 
entitled to contingency enhancement because, given that they are funded through charitable contributions, they do not bear the 
same type of risk as private attorneys). The Court disagrees with the cited case. It ignores the Supreme Court's consistently stated position that, for fee purposes, no 
distinction is to be drawn between public interest attorneys and private attorneys. See Blanchard v. Bergeron, 489 U.S. 87, 109 
S. Ct. 939, 945, 103 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1989)(""That a nonprofit legal services organization may contractually have agreed not to 
charge any [emphasis in original] fee of a civil rights plaintiff does not preclude the award of a reasonable fee to a prevailing 
party in a § 1983 action, calculated in the usual way."")(emphasis added except where noted); Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886, 
894, 79 L. Ed. 2d 891, 104 S. Ct. 1541 (1984)(""Congress did not intend the calculation of fee awards to vary depending on 
whether plaintiff was represented by private counsel or by a nonprofit legal services organization.""). "
1222,1, The process is also known as sonography.
1222,2," Acuson argues in its brief that Gallit's declaration is unreliable because he had, in an earlier deposition, exercised his rights 
under the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. But Acuson has not controverted any of the specific facts from 
Gallit's declaration that we set out above. "
1223,3," Aloka had already exhibited its SSD-650 to the public on May 7, 1986, shortly before it received the Acuson 128."
1223,4," Aloka supports this claim with the declarations of engineers that examined the Acuson 128, and Acuson has offered no 
contradictory evidence. (See also fn. 14.)"
1223,5," Acuson also alleged in conclusory terms causes of action for breach of the software license agreement, unfair competition ( 
Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17200 et seq.), and fraud. Each cause of action incorporates the earlier allegations about misappropriation 
of trade secrets."
1223,6," A plaintiff who seeks relief for misappropriation of trade secrets must identify the trade secrets and carry the burden of showing 
that they exist. ( Diodes, Inc. v. Franzen  (1968) 260 Cal.App.2d 244, 250 [67 Cal.Rptr. 19].) While Acuson asserts repeatedly 
that it does have trade secrets, the voluminous record in this case contains only one attempt by Acuson in the form of admissible 
evidence to identify the trade secrets that Aloka is said to have misappropriated. And that one attempt is sorely deficient. It is 
contained in the declaration of Acuson's Director of Research, who states in conclusory fashion that the secrets “include, but are 
not limited to, information concerning both Acuson's 128 channel and doppler technology.” But it is not a secret that the Acuson 128 uses 128 channels; the product's name advertises that important feature. Nor is it a 
secret that Acuson's product makes use of the doppler effect (a shift in observed wavelength due to a reflecting object's motion) 
to provide information about the speed and direction of blood flow. Although Acuson may accomplish this in a different way from 
other manufacturers, the undisputed evidence shows that doppler capability is a standard feature. Perhaps Acuson has information related to doppler technology and the simultaneous use of 128 channels that it has not 
disclosed to the public. But, as our discussion will show, whatever can be learned through examination of a publicly available 
product is not a trade secret. Conversely, if Acuson had trade secrets which were not discoverable by examination of Acuson's 
product, they were not acquired by Aloka. (See also fn. 16.) "
1224,7," Delay in seeking relief is one factor which the trial court should take into consideration. ( Tustin Community Hospital, Inc. v. 
Santa Ana Community Hospital Assn.  (1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 889, 894-906 [153 Cal.Rptr. 76].) After learning that Aloka had an 
Acuson 128, Acuson waited 10 months to file suit and another 6 months before moving for injunctive relief."
1224,8," The injunction may be overly broad in several respects. As we have mentioned, one major flaw is that it does not refer to trade 
secrets and is not limited to preventing their exploitation. Instead, it broadly prohibits Aloka from using any “information derived 
from its study of the Acuson 128 system,” regardless whether the technology was already in the public domain or known to 
Aloka."
1224,9," In its brief Acuson makes passing references to unfair competition law but does not attempt to explain how that law would 
make Aloka liable in this case if the Acuson 128 does not contain trade secrets."
1224,10," There is no evidence that Aloka has copied the Acuson 128. But if the law permits copying, it will of necessity permit 
preparations for copying, such as detailed study. "
1225,11, Acuson's declarations do not support the assertion in any event.
1225,12," The Commissioners' Comment to the Uniform Trade Secrets Act has been adopted in California as the Legislative Committee 
comment (Senate) to Civil Code section 3426.1. "
1226,13," Of course, Aloka never signed a document containing the software license agreement.  Instead, Acuson alleged that Aloka 
had notice of license because Gallit, the president of Northeastern, had signed a two-page “Quotation” which included the 
“Terms and Conditions.” Northeastern, however, claimed that the “Quotation” was not authentic.  This factual dispute does not 
affect the disposition of this appeal since, as discussed below, the preliminary injunction is not predicated upon a finding that the 
software license was ever breached."
1226,14," Nor was there sufficient evidence finding in any event. Arguing to the contrary, Acuson's counsel calls our attention to the 
declaration of Neil Harvey, an engineer for Acuson. During this litigation Harvey examined Aloka's engineers' notes on the 
Acuson 128. He states: “In the course of that review, I detected that Aloka engineers had invested heavily in measuring what 
Acuson software does to produce certain effects, presumably with the intent of duplicating the software.” This declaration does not establish that Aloka has violated any proprietary rights of Acuson. And we must, of course, ignore the 
declarant's speculation about Aloka's future intentions. "
1227,15," In response to Aloka's explanation, Acuson suggested for the first time in oral argument that the locks are intended to detect 
attempts to reverse-engineer the system. Of course, a cut lock does not tell Acuson whether the owner's purpose was 
maintenance or reverse engineering. But even if Acuson's explanation of the locks were correct, the locks still would not convert lawful reverse engineering into a tort. 
HN8[
] Unless a buyer has made an enforceable promise not to examine the machine, a lock protects trade secrets about as 
effectively as a sign reading “Please don't look inside.” "
1228,16," There may still be secrets related to the design or manufacture of the Acuson 128 that an examination of the product itself 
does not reveal. If so, Acuson might still properly invoke trade secret law to prevent a competitor from inducing Acuson's 
employees to disclose such proprietary information. But that is not the case before us."
1228,17," It appears that only one case, Sinclair v. Aquarius Electronics, Inc.  (1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 216, 226 [116 Cal.Rptr. 654], might 
have read the Kewanee  footnote in the same way as Acuson. We discuss Sinclair  below. "
1230,18," Nor can a desire to protect local industry against competition from the outside be a legitimate goal of state trade secret law. 
This was an essential flaw of the Florida statute invalidated in Bonito : “The prospect of all 50 States establishing similar 
protections for preferred industries without the rigorous requirements of patentability prescribed by Congress could pose a 
substantial threat to the patent system's ability to accomplish its mission of promoting progress in the useful arts.” ( Bonito Boats, 
supra,  489 U.S. at p.     [103 L.Ed.2d at p. 141, 109 S.Ct. at p. 983].)"
1230,19," As the Supreme Court observed in Bonito,  prohibition of “reverse engineering of a product in the public domain” is “clearly 
one of the rights vested in the federal patent holder, but has never been a part of state protection under the law of unfair 
competition or trade secrets.” (489 U.S. at p.     [103 L.Ed.2d at p. 140, 109 S.Ct. at p. 982].) "
1231,20," The court did not discuss a more plausible basis for trade secret liability: the confidential drawings might have been trade 
secrets even if the publicly disclosed product was not. "
1232,21," The treatise also recognizes, on the same page, that “[a] product that has reached the market is open to investigation; it may 
be analyzed and studied. And once its secret has become known, the article, if unprotected by patent or copyright, may be 
copied.” (2 Callmann, supra,  § 1435, at p. 137, fns. omitted.)"
1232,22," The decision in Montegut v. Hickson, Inc.  (1917) 164 N.Y.S. 858) does not concern trade secrets at all. The court enjoined a 
clothing importer, who had substituted its own labels for a competitor's, from passing off the competitor's designs as its own. "
1244,1," Thillens' initial effort in this action had been the filing of a complaint naming Fryzel not individually but in his official capacity, 
and including a RICO claim as well as pendent state law claims. Such an official-capacity lawsuit posed obvious Eleventh 
Amendment problems (see, e.g., Alabama v. Pugh, 438 U.S. 781, 57 L. Ed. 2d 1114, 98 S. Ct. 3057 (1978)), and it failed -- "
1245,," precisely because it was framed in official-capacity terms -- to come within the area carved out by Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 
52 L. Ed. 714, 28 S. Ct. 441 (1908) as a permissible basis for suit against unlawful conduct by state officers. This Court therefore 
dismissed that original pleading. Thillens then repleaded in the way described in the text, though the Complaint leaves much to 
be desired in its failure to focus solely on Fryzel -- in his individual capacity -- as the lone defendant."
1245,2, In part Complaint para. 1 speaks of jurisdiction based directly on:
1245,1," . the Contracts Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, § 10 (because no such state-official counterpart of Bivens actions exists, any 
violation of that constitutional provision must draw upon 42 U.S.C. § 1983 as the basis for suit; see, e.g., Thomas v. Shipka, 
818 F.2d 496, 499, reh'g in part on other grounds, 829 F.2d 570 (6th Cir. 1987)); and"
1245,2," . the Fifth Amendment (but that is nonsense, because it does not apply to state actors and there is no reason to 
incorporate via the Fourteenth Amendment provisions that are already in that Amendment as direct guaranties). Thillens also alludes to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1985(2) and 1981, but any reading of those statutes and the case law construing them 
confirms their obvious and total inapplicability here."
1245,3," Familiar Rule 12(b)(6) principles require this Court to accept as true all of Thillens' well-pleaded factual allegations in the 
Complaint, drawing all reasonable inferences in Thillens' favor (Marmon Group, Inc. v. Rexnord, Inc., 822 F.2d 31, 34 (7th Cir. 
1987) (per curiam)). Paragraphs in the Complaint will be cited simply ""para. --."""
1245,4," Further citations to the Act will take the form ""Paragraph --,"" referring to the Chapter 17 numbering rather than to the Act's 
internal numbering of its sections."
1245,5," That original enactment was codified in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 16 1/2, §§ 30-56.3. After 1979 the legislation was renumbered and 
transferred to Chapter 17 as part of a legislative revision program mandated by the General Assembly. "
1246,6," Thillens alleges (paras. 13, 15) that then-Governor Adlai Stevenson vetoed a 1949 bill to that effect, and that he neither 
approved nor vetoed the nearly-identical 1951 bill that eventually became law. Like so much of the Complaint, those facts do 
nothing to advance its legal viability."
1246,7," Though those clauses directly track the language of the Fourteenth Amendment and though the Illinois Supreme Court drew on 
Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence in reaching its conclusions, the opinion did not in terms decide the issues under the 
United States Constitution. "
1247,8," Fryzel's first memorandum asserted a qualified immunity defense, apparently reading the Complaint as requesting damages as 
well as injunctive relief (that view may have been occasioned by the boilerplate inclusion, in each prayer for relief, of the 
invariable request for ""such other and further relief as law and equity allow""). Thillens' responsive memorandum acknowledged 
that only prospective relief was sought. Because qualified immunity applies only to cases involving money damages (see, e.g., 
Rodriguez v. Board of Education, 620 F.2d 362, 366 (2d Cir. 1980)), Fryzel's reply memorandum has abandoned that line of 
defense. "
1248,9," Thillens also refers to other amendments that increased statutory licensing fees, but it does not suggest those provide a basis 
for any claim of constitutional or antitrust violation. "
1251,10," Indeed, Counts III and IV refer only to the State of Illinois and DFI as alleged antitrust law violators -- they are entirely silent 
as to how Fryzel (the only defendant) has purportedly breached those statutes. That lapse is symptomatic of how, even after this 
Court had pointed out the Eleventh Amendment difficulties posed by the original complaint (see n.1), Thillens' counsel did not 
think through the question of just how Fryzel could even arguably be held liable in purely individual terms."
1251,11," This opinion has not touched at all on another factor that would appear to pose an insurmountable hurdle for Thillens -- the 
time problem. All Thillens says to meet the obvious limitations problems it must face is that it could not have known of the official 
corruption until 1979 (para. 26). Even if that is accepted as true, limitations have long since barred any claim rooted in those 
matters. And of course it is mine-run jurisprudence that the continuation of injury suffered from the same source does not give 
rise to a new cause of action. This whole problem -- even if Thillens wants only prospective relief, why did it not sue while its 
claim was still fresh in limitations terms? -- fortifies the dismissal result reached here. "
1252,12," It may be that despite the bulk of both the originally-filed complaint (90 paragraphs occupying 76 pages, exclusive of lengthy 
exhibits) and the Complaint (62 paragraphs filling 63 pages), Thillens and its counsel have withheld some undisclosed string that 
could fit (and repair!) their broken bow. If such is the case, Rule 59(e) is available to them. "
1254,1," RICO's civil liability provision states: Any person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in 
any appropriate United States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit, 
including a reasonable attorney's fee."
1254,18, U.S.C. § 1964(c) (1982).
1254,2," That section provides: It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or in the activities of which 
affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's 
affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt."
1254,18, U.S.C. § 1962(c) (1982). 
1255,3," RICO defines racketeering activity as (A) any act or threat involving murder, kidnapping, gambling, arson, robbery, bribery, extortion, dealing in obscene matter, 
or dealing in narcotic or other dangerous drugs, which is chargeable under State law and punishable by imprisonment for 
more than one year; (B) any act which is indictable under any of the following provisions of title 18, United States Code: 
Section 201 (relating to bribery), section 224 (relating to sports bribery), sections 471, 472, and 473 (relating to 
counterfeiting), section 659 (relating to theft from interstate shipment) if the act indictable under section 659 is felonious, 
section 664 (relating to embezzlement from pension and welfare funds), sections 891-894 (relating to extortionate credit 
transactions), section 1029 (relative to fraud and related activity in connection with access devices), section 1084 (relating 
to the transmission of gambling information), section 1341 (relating to mail fraud), section 1343 (relating to wire fraud), 
sections 1461-1465 (relating to obscene matter), section 1503 (relating to obstruction of justice), section 1510 (relating to 
obstruction of criminal investigations), section 1511 (relating to the obstructing of State or local law enforcement), section 
1512 (relating to tampering with a witness, victim, or an informant), section 1513 (relating to retaliating against a witness, 
victim, or an informant), section 1951 (relating to interference with commerce, robbery, or extortion), section 1952 (relating 
to racketeering), section 1953 (relating to interstate transportation of wagering paraphernalia), section 1954 (relating to 
unlawful welfare fund payments), section 1955 (relating to the prohibition of illegal gambling businesses), section 1956 
(relating to the laundering of monetary instruments), section 1957 (relating to engaging in monetary transactions in property 
derived from specified unlawful activity), section 1958 (relating to use of interstate commerce facilities in the commission of 
murder-for-hire), sections 2251-2252 (relating to sexual exploitation of children), sections 2312 and 2313 (relating to 
interstate transportation of stolen motor vehicles), section 2314 and 2315 (relating to interstate transportation of stolen 
property), section 2321 (relating to trafficking in certain motor vehicles or motor vehicle parts), sections 2341-2346 (relating 
to trafficking in contraband cigarettes), sections 2421-24 (relating to white slave traffic), (C) any act which is indictable 
under title 29, United States Code, section 186 (dealing with restrictions on payments and loans to labor organizations) or 
section 501(c) (relating to embezzlement from union funds), (D) any offense involving fraud connected with a case under 
title 11, fraud in the sale of securities, or the felonious manufacture, importation, receiving, concealment, buying, selling, or 
otherwise dealing in narcotic or other dangerous drugs, punishable under any law of the United States, or (E) any act which 
is indictable under the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act . . . ."
1255,18, U.S.C. § 1961(1) (1982 & Supp. IV 1986). 
1256,4," The analogy is particularly apt because RICO's civil remedy provision was adapted from the section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 
U.S.C. § 15(a) (1982). See generally Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 486-88, 87 L. Ed. 2d 346, 105 S. Ct. 3275 
(1985)."
1256,5," The result would be different today. Congress limited the availability of civil antitrust remedies against municipalities by 
enacting the Local Government Antitrust Act of 1984, Pub. L. 98-544, 98 Stat. 270 (codified at 15 U.S.C. §§ 34-36 (Supp. IV 
1986)). That law provides in part, ""No damages, interest on damages, costs, or attorney's fees may be recovered under sections 
4, 4A, or 4C of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 15, 15a, or 15c) from any local government, official or employee thereof acting in an 
official capacity."" 15 U.S.C. § 35(a). The House Judiciary Committee summarized the purpose of this legislation as follows: The Committee acted in response to concerns with Supreme Court decisions over the past few years that appear to have 
limited the extent that antitrust immunity applicable to the States will be accorded to local governments. Those decisions 
have spawned an increasing number of antitrust suits, and threatened suits, that could undermine a local government's 
ability to govern in the public interest. Most of the suits instituted by private parties have sought treble damages. H.R. Rep. No. 98-695, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 2, reprinted in 1978 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News 4602, 4603. Plaintiffs claim that congressional action to immunize municipalities for liability for money damages under the Clayton Act 
coupled with its failure to change the RICO civil liability provision indicates its intention that municipalities be subject to civil 
liability under RICO. The court finds the argument unpersuasive. First, the court can draw no inference from congressional 
inaction. See Alken v. Lerner, 485 F. Supp. 871, 877 (D.N.J. 1980) (""failure of Congress to enact legislation . . . is not always a 
reliable indicator of legislative intent""). Second, the analogy between civil liability under RICO and under the Clayton Act fails as 
discussed infra. "
1257,6," That section provides: It shall be unlawful for any person who has received any income derived, directly or indirectly, from a pattern of 
racketeering activity or through collection of an unlawful debt in which such person has participated as a principal within the 
meaning of section 2, title 18, United States Code, to use or invest, directly or indirectly, any part of such income, or the 
proceeds of such income, in acquisition of any interest in, or the establishment or operation of, any enterprise which is 
engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce. A purchase of securities on the open market for 
purposes of investment, and without the intention of controlling or participating in the control of the issuer, or of assisting 
another to do so, shall not be unlawful under this subsection if the securities of the issuer held by the purchaser, the 
members of his immediate family, and his or their accomplices in any pattern of racketeering activity or the collection of an 
unlawful debt after such purchase do not amount in the aggregate to one percent of the outstanding securities of any one 
class, and do not confer, either in law or in fact, the power to elect one or more directors of the issuer."
1257,18, U.S.C. § 1962(a) (1982). 
1270,1," Aside from the other opinion today, this case has also spawned the jurisdictional decisions of the Temporary Emergency Court 
of Appeals in In re Coordinated Pre-Trial Proceedings in Petroleum Products Antitrust Litigation, 761 F.2d 710 (Em. App. 1985) 
and Petroleum Products Antitrust Litigation, 830 F.2d 198 (Em. App.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 969, 108 S. Ct. 466, 98 L. Ed. 2d 
405 (1987). A breach of contract claim continues in the District Court for the Central District of California as case No. CV-86-
1771-WPG. Certain state law claims continue in litigation in California state court as case No. C587912 (L.A. County Super. Ct.)."
1270,2," Original Defendants Chevron, Arco, Texaco, Unocal, Mobil, Shell, and Exxon all signed the original agreement. Arco has 
settled with the plaintiffs, and is not a party here."
1270,3," Pauley Petroleum, Inc. and Allied Chemical Corp. were signatories to the contract but were never named as defendants. "
1271,4," The "" Field"" referred to is the Wilmington field itself."
1271,5," The ""Named Fields"" referred to are the Wilmington field and three other nearby oil fields in Southern California, Huntington 
Beach, Inglewood, and Signal Hill. "
1273,6," We note that the trial court believed that the two claims were factually identical. Due to our holding, we need not and do not 
express an opinion on the res judicata effects of the earlier federal judgment. "
1278,1," The defendants-appellees are Standard Oil Co. of California (now Chevron Corp.), Exxon Corp. (formerly Humble Oil & 
Refining Co.), Mobil Oil Corp., Shell Oil Co., Texaco, Inc., and Union Oil Co. of California. The seventh defendant, Atlantic 
Richfield Co., settled with plaintiffs and was dismissed from these suits on December 13, 1984."
1278,2," Three consolidated cases are involved in this appeal. D.C. No. CV-75-2232 was filed in June 1975 by the City of Long Beach; 
counts one and two of the second amended complaint alleged antitrust violations in the defendants' purchase of oil produced 
from lands owned in trust by the city for the benefit of the State of California. D.C. No. CV-76-2839 is a class action suit by the 
State of California on behalf of itself and its political subdivisions; the fifth cause of action of the second amended complaint 
alleged a conspiracy to depress crude oil prices and was severed and consolidated with No. 75-2232. The district court certified 
its summary judgment award on the antitrust claims as final under Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b). D.C. No. CV-82-3252 was filed by the City of Long Beach in June 1982 and alleged federal and state antitrust claims for oil 
produced from lands owned by the city in its proprietary capacity, as opposed to as trustee. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291."
1278,3," We also decide today in a separate opinion an appeal from the district court's award of summary judgment against the city on 
the pendent state contract claims included in the complaint filed in D.C. No. CV-75-2232.  City of Long Beach v. Standard Oil 
Co., 872 F.2d 1410 (9th Cir. 1989). That opinion also considers the removal of state law claims, originally filed in state court in 
1986, concerning a later time period. "
1279,4, A more detailed discussion of the pricing provisions is contained in our companion opinion on the contract claims. 
1285,5," In Petroleum Products Antitrust Litigation, 830 F.2d 198 (Em. App.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 969, 108 S. Ct. 466, 98 L. Ed. 2d 
405 (1987), the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals considered an interlocutory appeal by the city of the partial summary 
judgment dismissing the antitrust claims beginning April 12, 1972, because of the effect of federal price controls. TECA ruled 
that the issues raised were nonjusticiable until the underlying antitrust liability was resolved.  Id. at 203. TECA noted that two 
issues were potentially within its sphere of authority, and could be appealed to it if and when justiciable: A.  Whether or not 6 C.F.R. Sec. 101.34(a)(2), which exempted state and local governments from price controls under 
certain circumstances, applied to sales of ""net profits oil"" by appellants during the periods April 12, 1972 to June 13, 1973, 
and August 19, 1973 to October 25, 1973? . . . . C.  Whether or not compliance with Phase III price controls was ""voluntary"" during the period of January 11, 1973 to June 
13, 1973 so that appellees were not prohibited from making appropriate price adjustments for the crude oil sold by 
appellants during this period?  Id. at 200, 203. We did not consider the above issues, and express no opinion on the appropriate time for the parties to raise 
them with TECA. "

1293,1," Section 4 provides as follows: HN1[
] ""[A]ny person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may 
sue therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, "
1294,," without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, 
including a reasonable attorney's fee."" 15 U. S. C. § 15(a)."
1294,2," The Court noted two possible exceptions: when the direct purchaser and the indirect purchaser have entered into pre-existing 
cost-plus contracts, Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S., at 732, n. 12, and when the direct purchaser is owned or controlled by 
the indirect purchaser, id., at 736, n. 16."
1294,3," The statutes of Alabama, California, and Minnesota expressly allow indirect purchasers to sue.  See Ala. Code § 6-5-60(a) 
(1975) (allowing recovery by any person ""injured or damaged . . ., direct or indirect""); Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code Ann. § 16750(a) 
(West Supp. 1989) (allowing recovery ""regardless of whether such injured person dealt directly or indirectly with the defendant""); 
Minn. Stat. § 325D.57 (1988) (allowing recovery by any person ""injured directly or indirectly"").  A number of other jurisdictions 
have similar statutes.  Colo. Rev. Stat. § 6-4-106 (Supp. 1988); D. C. Code § 28-4509(a) (1981); Haw. Rev. Stat. § 480-14(c) 
(1985); Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 38, para. 60-7(2) (1988); Kan. Stat. Ann. § 50-801(b) (Supp. 1988); Md. Com. Law Code Ann. § 11-
209 (1983); Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 445.778 (West Supp. 1988); Miss. Code Ann. § 75-21-9 (1972); N. M. Stat. Ann. § 57-1-
3(A) (1987); R. I. Gen. Laws § 6-36-12(g) (1985); S. D. Codified Laws § 37-1-33 (1986); Wis. Stat. § 133.18 (1987-1988). The Arizona statute, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 44-1408(A) (1987), generally follows the language of the Clayton Act, but it might be 
interpreted as a matter of state law as authorizing indirect purchasers to recover.  This is appellants' position.  See Brief for 
Appellants 19, n. 6; Juris. Statement 9.  Appellees dispute this interpretation, Brief for Appellee ARC America Corp. 21, n. 14, 
and the District Court and the Court of Appeals did not pass on this question given their holdings that even if the statute was so 
interpreted it was pre-empted by federal law. We express no opinion on this question of Arizona law. "
1295,4," At the time of the enactment of the Sherman Act, 21 States had already adopted their own antitrust laws. Mosk, State Antitrust 
Enforcement and Coordination with Federal Enforcement, 21 A. B. A. Antitrust Section 358, 363 (1962).  Moreover, the Sherman 
Act itself, in the words of Senator Sherman, ""does not announce a new principle of law, but applies old and well recognized 
principles of the common law to the complicated jurisdiction of our State and Federal Government."" 21 Cong. Rec. 2456 (1890). "
1296,5," Cf. National Cooperative Research Act of 1984, 15 U. S. C. § 4303(c) (1982 ed., Supp. V); Export Trading Company Act of 
1982, 15 U. S. C. §§ 4016, 4002(a)(7)."
1296,6," In one respect, the Court of Appeals was overly narrow in its description of the congressional purposes identified in Illinois 
Brick.  In Illinois Brick, the Court was concerned not merely that direct purchasers have sufficient incentive to bring suit under the 
antitrust laws, as the Court of Appeals asserted, but rather that at least some party have sufficient incentive to bring suit. Indeed, 
we implicitly recognized as much in noting that indirect purchasers might be allowed to bring suit in cases in which it would be 
easy to prove the extent to which the overcharge was passed on to them.  See 431 U.S., at 732, n. 12. "
1297,7," Contrary to the Court of Appeals' suggestion, 817 F. 2d, at 1445, there is no contention here that the state indirect purchaser 
statutes themselves seek to limit the recovery direct purchasers can obtain under federal law. "
