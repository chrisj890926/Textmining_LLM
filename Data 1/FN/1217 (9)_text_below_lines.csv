32,1, Tribune originally filed this motion alone. Jones later joined in the motion adopting the arguments as presented by Tribune. 
37,1," There is a dispute as to whether an oral contract was created as a result of Allen's statement. However, this dispute is not a 
material one."
37,2," For the purposes of this motion, this court assumes, arguendo, that the statements would be admissible evidence at trial. "
39,3," Plaintiff's evidence that Marano Truck's bid was lower than Austin's is based solely on a contract for twenty-two trailers. Plaintiff 
has not produced any evidence that its bid would have been lower for only five trailers. Moreover, Brown's alleged outburst took 
place in the context of a lease for twenty-two trailers. It is pure speculation that Brown would have had the same reaction over a 
lease for only five trailers. "
40,4," This statement by plaintiff is inaccurate. There is no evidence that Local 500 objected to the use of Marano Truck in the Lin Pac 
incident. "
50,1," The Chesapeake Public Schools Student School Pictures Specifications provide, ""It should be noted that cost, although a 
significant factor, is secondary to quality of service and product and shall not be the sole determinant in selecting a school 
photographer and/or photograph studio."" (Plaintiffs' Book III, Ex. 14). "
52,2," In support of their claim that Granby High refused to publish a paid advertisement, the plaintiffs cite Book III, Ex. 35. Exhibit 35 
is a letter dated May 15, 1986 from Ms. Anna Marie Tarr, yearbook advisor at Granby High to plaintiff Friedman. The letter in its 
entirety states: ""We are in the process of compiling specifications for yearbook senior photos. We will relay them to you as soon 
as possible."" Book III, Exhibit 36 is a letter dated May 23, 1986 from Ms. Tarr to plaintiff Friedman which states: ""Here is the list 
of specifications for the senior photos for the coming year."" Neither of these letters appear to involve yearbook advertisements. "
62,1," Plaintiffs claim that the picketing was aimed at forcing them to replace their non-union carpentry subcontractor with 
subcontractors employing union carpenters."
62,2," HN1[
] Section 158(b) states, in pertinent part: It shall be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents -- (4)(i) to engage in, or to induce or encourage any individual employed by any person engaged in commerce or in an 
industry affecting commerce to engage in, a strike or a refusal in the course of his employment to use, manufacture, 
process, transport, or otherwise handle or work on any goods, articles, materials, or commodities or to perform any 
services; or (ii) to threaten, coerce, or restrain any person engaged in commerce or in an industry affecting commerce, 
where in either case an objective thereof is -- . . . . (B) forcing or requiring any person to cease using, selling, handling, transporting, or otherwise dealing in the products of 
any other producer, processor, or manufacturer, or to cease doing business with any other person. . . ."
62,3, Also known as § 10(l) of the National Labor Relations Act. 
63,4," HN2[
] Section 303 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. § 187 (originally enacted as the Taft-Hartley Act), allows persons injured by violations of § 158(b)(4) to sue the labor organization or other offending party for damages resulting 
from the unfair labor practice."
63,5," At oral argument on April 14, 1989, the Court inquired of counsel as to whether the defendants' present activities could be 
considered a violation of the Stipulation entered into between the NLRB and the Union and approved by this court on October 
28, 1988. At that time, both parties indicated that they had not really considered the issue but that they would address it at a later 
time. Subsequently, plaintiffs have alleged that the Union's present conduct is in violation of the October, 1988, Stipulation and 
the defendants have argued otherwise. As discussed below, the court has determined that defendants are not in violation of the 
Stipulation. Furthermore, the court feels that if such a violation were to occur, it would be up to the NLRB, under the terms of § 
10(l) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. § 160(l), and of the Stipulation itself, to petition the court for injunctive relief."
63,6," The General Counsel's decision states, in pertinent part: The appeal is denied substantially for the reasons set forth in the Regional Director's letter of March 21, 1989. . . . Further, 
with regard to your contentions about the Act's restrictions on handbilling, the United States Supreme Court held recently 
that Section 8(b)(4) of the Act [29 U.S.C. § 158(b)(4)] does not prohibit publicity, not involving picketing, urging a consumer 
boycott of neutral employers, at least where such appeals are peaceful and truthful. See Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. 
Florida Gulf Coast Building & Construction Trades Council and NLRB, 485 U.S. 568, 108 S. Ct. 1932 [1392 [99 L. Ed. 2d 
645] (1988). A review of all documents submitted by both parties, including EPA reports on the Lipari landfall [sic], State of 
New Jersey health reports, and newspaper articles thereon, did not support your contention that the brochures were so 
misleading or wrong to be untruthful within the meaning of the Act. Nor was there sufficient probative evidence to establish 
that the handbillers engaged in coercive conduct, as alleged. In these circumstances, our burden of establishing that the 
Union violated the Act as alleged could not be sustained. "
64,," The General Counsel's decision not to issue an unfair labor practice complaint is not reviewable by the courts. See Detroit 
Edison Co. v. NLRB, 440 U.S. 301, 316, 59 L. Ed. 2d 333, 99 S. Ct. 1123 (1979); NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132,

Furthermore, jurisdiction to review, set aside, or enforce orders of the NLRB is vested in the Court of Appeals, not the District 
Court. 29 U.S.C. § 160(f)."
64,7," These provisional measures were undertaken voluntarily by the Union to address the plaintiffs' and the court's concerns 
regarding traffic hazards at the entrance to Hidden Creek and the potentially false or misleading message conveyed by the suits 
and masks that Hidden Creek was imminently dangerous to human life."
64,8," Of course, HN3[

has the power and the duty, subject to review, to determine the jurisdictional issue."" Id. at § 3536 (citations omitted)."

65,11," HN7[
] Section 20 states: No restraining order or injunction shall be granted by any court of the United States, or a judge or the judges thereof, in any 
case between an employer and employees, or between employers and employees, or between employees, or between 
persons employed and persons seeking employment, involving, or growing out of, a dispute concerning terms or conditions 
of employment, unless necessary to prevent irreparable injury to property, or to a property right, of the party making the 
application, for which injury there is no adequate remedy at law, and such property or property right must be described with 
particularity in the application, which must be in writing and sworn to by the applicant or by his agent or attorney. HN8[
] And no such restraining order or injunction shall prohibit any person or persons, whether singly or in concert, from 
terminating any relation of employment, or from ceasing to perform any work or labor, or from recommending, advising, or 
persuading others by peaceful means to do so; or from attending at any place where any such person or persons may 
lawfully be, for the purpose of peacefully obtaining or communicating information, or from peacefully persuading any person 
to work or to abstain from working; or from ceasing to patronize or to employ any party to such dispute, or from 
recommending, advising, or persuading others by peaceful and lawful means so to do; or from paying or giving to, or 
withholding from, any person engaged in such dispute, any strike benefits or other moneys or things of value; or from 
peaceably assembling in a lawful manner, and for lawful purposes; or from doing any act or thing which might lawfully be 
done in the absence of such dispute by any party thereto; nor shall any of the acts specified in this paragraph be 
considered or held to be violations of any law of the United States."

66,13," HN11[
] The Act's declaration of public policy states, in part: Whereas under prevailing economic conditions, developed with the aid of governmental authority for owners of property to 
organize in the corporate and other forms of ownership association, the individual unorganized worker is commonly 
helpless to exercise actual liberty of contract and to protect his freedom of labor, and thereby to obtain acceptable terms 
and conditions of employment, wherefore, though he should be free to decline to associate with his fellows, it is necessary 
that he have full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of his own choosing, to 
negotiate the terms and conditions of his employment, and that he shall be free from the interference, restraint, or coercion 
of employers of labor, or their agents, in the designation of such representatives or in self-organization or in other concerted 
activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection. . . ."
66,29, U.S.C. § 102.
66,14," HN13[
] Among the situations when a court cannot, under any circumstances, issue a restraining order or an injunction are 
when the effect would be to: prohibit any person or persons participating or interested in [a labor] dispute . . . from . . ., whether singly or in concert . . .: (e) Giving publicity to the existence of, or the facts involved in, any labor dispute, whether by advertising, speaking, 
patrolling, or by any other method not involving fraud or violence; (f) Assembling peaceably to act or to organize to act in promotion of their interests in a labor dispute; . . . . (i) Advising, urging, or otherwise causing or inducing without fraud or violence the acts heretofore specified. . . ."
66,29, U.S.C. § 104 (emphasis added). 
67,15," HN14[
] Before a court may issue any restraining order or injunction in a case involving or growing out of a labor dispute, it 
must hear the testimony of witnesses in open court and must make the traditional findings associated with a temporary 
restraining order. 29 U.S.C. § 107. In addition, the court must file findings of fact and the restraining order must be very narrowly 
tailored. 29 U.S.C. § 109. In any event, no injunctive relief may be granted unless the complainant has made every reasonable 
effort to settle the dispute. 29 U.S.C. § 109."
67,16," The court notes that both parties have, over the course of this dispute, taken inconsistent positions as to whether this case 
""grows out of"" a labor dispute. Defendants, in their papers, claim that their purpose in distributing the handbills at the Hidden 
Creek site is to inform the public of the proximity of the development to the Lipari landfill and the resulting risks of purchasing a 
home there. Defendants' Memorandum of Law at 2. However, if this is true, then the case does not ""grow out of"" a labor dispute 
and the court's jurisdiction to enter a restraining order is not limited by the Norris-LaGuardia Act. On the other hand, plaintiffs claim in their Memorandum of Law that this case in no way involves or grows out of a labor dispute. 
Plaintiff's Memorandum of Law at 8. However, as discussed above, plaintiffs very recently filed unfair labor practice charges with 
the NLRB, claiming that the Carpenters' activities were illegal secondary picketing. Surely, plaintiffs cannot now be heard to 
argue that the same activity which they now ask this court to enjoin does not ""grow out of"" a labor dispute. Indeed, in their 
Memorandum plaintiffs claim that defendants' handbilling is aimed at forcing Johnston, Inc. ""to terminate its contract with its non-
union carpentry subcontractor, and to hire subcontractors employed by members of Local 1578."" Plaintiffs' Memorandum of Law 
at 2. Certainly, such a motive, if true, involves a controversy concerning ""terms or conditions of employment"" within the Act's 
definition of a ""labor dispute."" 29 U.S.C. § 113(c). "
68,17," See footnote 2 for the relevant text of the union unfair labor practices established by the 1947 amendment and another 
amendment in 1959."
68,18, See footnote 2.
68,19," The Regional Director also stated that the fact that the handbillers wore gas masks and cleanup suits did not make the 
conduct ""coercive"" within the meaning of the Act. See discussion infra. "
69,20," As discussed above, the court has expressed its concern over the potential falsity of the message conveyed by the suits and 
masks themselves. However, because defendants have voluntarily agreed not to wear them while handbilling at Hidden Creek, 
the court need not rule on the issue."
69,21," HN20[
] The ""publicity proviso"" of § 158(b)(4)(ii) states, in pertinent part: For the purposes of this paragraph (4) only, nothing contained in such paragraph shall be construed to prohibit publicity, 
other than picketing, for the purpose of truthfully advising the public, including consumers and members of a labor 
organization, that a product or products are produced by an employer with whom the labor organization has a primary 
dispute and are distributed by another employer. . . ."
69,22, Paragraph 2 of the Stipulation states: 
70,," The hearing on the Petition for Injunction, filed herein, presently scheduled for November 1, 1988, is continued indefinitely, 
subject to call upon notice to Respondents [the Union] or their Counsel of record, should Petitioner [the NLRB] feel that 
Respondents subsequent to the date of this Stipulation have breached the provisions hereof. It is important to note that the plaintiffs in the instant action, Johnston Development Group, et al., were not even a party to the 
Stipulation. This is the normal practice for resolving unfair labor practices under the NLRA. See, e.g., Hirsch, 530 F.2d at 307-08. "
87,1," The only new evidence which counterplaintiffs have submitted in support of their revised single-product market definition 
consists of two affidavits, one by Mr. Work himself and another by Mr. Kenneth Klarman, a discount retailer to whom Work used 
to sell Lladro figurines. The affidavits state, on the basis of the affiants' personal business experiences, that because of the 
fanatical devotion of certain consumers to Lladro figurines, most retailers who carry Lladro will accept no other brands as 
substitutes. However, as counterdefendants point out, this proves only that Mr. Work was selling to retailers, including Mr. 
Klarman, who had already decided which brand of porcelain figurines they wanted to buy. As this court previously ruled, proof of 
brand loyalty on the part of some purchasers does not establish that the favored brand constitutes its own relevant market. Moreover, the newly-submitted affidavits fly in the face of Mr. Work's own deposition testimony suggesting that Lladro figurines 
occupy the middle range of price and quality in the market for high quality porcelain figurines. See Counterdefendants' 
Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of the Motion for Summary Judgment Regarding the Antitrust Issues, Exh. I at 
p. 84-85. "
88,2," Another pertinent distinction between this case and Jennings Oil is that defendant in the latter case was accused of trying to 
eliminate existing wholesale distributors with whom it was already competing. Here, Weil is the sole distributor, no competing 
distributor exists, and no business entity is in danger of being eliminated by the continuation of Weil's exclusive distributorship."
88,3," At oral argument, counterplaintiffs cited Hayden Publishing Co. v. Cox Broadcasting Corp., 730 F.2d 64 (2d Cir. 1984) to show 
that summary judgment is inappropriate here. The court finds that the Supreme Court's opinion in Catrett casts doubt on the 
validity of Hayden Publishing. In Hayden Publishing, the district court had granted defendants' summary judgment motion on claims brought under sections 1 
and 2 of the Sherman Act. The Second Circuit reversed on the grounds that (1) the defendants had not carried their burden of 
demonstrating the absence of a factual dispute regarding definition of the relevant market, and (2) even assuming that the 
district court properly accepted the defendants' market definition, it failed to make a determination of defendants' power within 
that market. As to its first grounds for reversal, the Court of Appeals wrote: As an initial matter, we believe that the [district] court erroneously placed the burden of proof on [plaintiff] for purposes of 
the defendants' motion for summary judgment. . . . Although [plaintiff] clearly will have the burden at trial of establishing the 
relevant product market, it did not have that burden for purposes of the defendants' motion for summary judgment. Id., 730 F.2d at 68. However, Catrett makes it clear that HN4[
] the burden of persuasion on the elements of the cause of action never leaves the 
plaintiff (or counterplaintiff), even when defendants bring a motion for summary judgment. As stated in that opinion: The plain language of Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon 
motion, against a party who fails to make a showing essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the 
burden of proof at trial. In such a situation, there can be ""no genuine issue as to any material fact,"" since a complete failure 
of proof concerning an essential element of the nonmoving party's case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial. Id., 477 U.S. at 322-23 (emphasis added). "
89,," Here, the counterplaintiffs will have to prove the relevant market definition as an essential element of their case at trial. However, 
as previously noted, their papers in opposition to summary judgment indicate that they will rely on a market definition which 
verges on legal insufficiency and which is unsupported by the record evidence. Accordingly, summary judgment is warranted 
under Catrett. Accord Belfiore v. New York Times Co., 826 F.2d 177, 180 (2d Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1067, 108 S. Ct. 
1030, 98 L. Ed. 2d 994 (1988). The above-quoted language from Catrett also casts doubt upon the second ground for the holding in Hayden Publishing. Under 
Catrett, counterplaintiffs' failure of proof concerning the relevant market definition ""necessarily renders all other facts immaterial,"" 
id., 477 U.S. at 323, so that the court need not decide whether counterdefendant's market definition is correct, or whether 
counterdefendants possessed market power under that definition. "
95,1," The jury also answered that it found in favor of Ashland and Bell Fuels on their punitive damage claim against Mr. Richards, but 
fixed the amount at $ 0. "
97,2," HN1[
] Arson and ""any offense involving fraud connected with a case under title 11"" are RICO predicate acts.  18 U.S.C. §"
97,1961," (1)(A) and (D). The jury was asked whether the plaintiffs proved ""that these acts of mail fraud or wire fraud or arson or 
bankruptcy fraud as alleged in Count II constituted a pattern of racketeering activity conducted by one or more, if any, of the 
defendants."" As to Charles and Norma Arnett, and Carson Petroleum, the jury answered ""no""; as to Toy and Thomas Arnett, 
they answered ""yes."" The findings favoring Charles and Norma Arnett and Carson Petroleum do not mean the arson and 
bankruptcy fraud did not occur. The jury could have decided that the arson occurred, and that the misstatement on the 
bankruptcy filing was fraudulent, but exonerated Charles and Norma Arnett and Carson Petroleum because they only committed 
a single predicate act, not a pattern. Likewise, the finding that these defendants had not conspired to violate 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) 
could have been based on lack of evidence of an agreement. "

103,10," Contrary to the plaintiffs' assertion, the clear weight of authority does not support its position. The district courts are at best

122,2," As stated in the Plan as adopted, the Garage Lease had a 20-year term plus a 20-year renewal option through the year 2024, 
exercisable at the option of Garage Corp. The Garage Lease provided that Garage Corp. would pay to Owners Corp. a base 
rent in the amount of $ 35,000 for each of the first five years of the Lease with an increase of $ 5000 for every five years 
thereafter through the remainder of the term. The Garage Lease also required Garage Corp. to pay to Owners Corp., as 
additional rent, 4.9 percent of the increase in the real estate taxes, heating, utilities and insurance costs incurred by Owners 
Corp. over the corresponding costs incurred during the base year of 1984-85. Finally, under the Garage Lease, Garage Corp. 
was to make all structural repairs which became necessary as a result of Garage Corp.'s use of the premises. The Commercial Lease also contained a 20-year term plus a 20-year renewal option through the year 2024, exercisable at the 
option of Commercial Corp. The Commercial Lease provided that Commercial Corp. would pay to Owners Corp. base rent in the 
amount of $ 65,000 for each of the first five years of the Lease with an increase of $ 5000 for every five years thereafter through 
the remainder of the term. The Commercial Lease required Commercial Corp. to pay Owners Corp., as additional rent, 1.84 
percent of the increase in real estate taxes over the base tax year of 1984-85. As provided for in the Fifth Amendment to the Plan, the Laundry Concession Agreement had a term of 15 years. Laundry Corp. 
paid to Owners Corp. an annual concession fee of $ 18,000. "
123,," The management agreement between Owners Corp. and Parman Corp. as manager (the ""Management Agreement"") had a term 
of three years and a base fee of $ 75,000 per annum. The Management Agreement expired on October 31, 1987 at which time 
Parman Corp. ceased to be the managing agent."
123,3," Under a non-eviction cooperative conversion plan, tenants who elect not to subscribe to the offering plan have the option of 
remaining in their apartments as rent stabilized tenants. "
124,4," Under New York law the Sponsor could have converted the Building as soon as subscription agreements were obtained from 
15% of the apartments -- a number that both parties acknowledge the Sponsor could have readily obtained. The owners of the 
Building had an incentive to convince a higher percentage of Tenants to subscribe, however, because those who chose not to 
buy had the option of remaining as rent stabilized tenants. "
126,5," Defendants argue that because each tenant at the time of subscription represented to the Sponsor that he or she was a 
resident of New York State, these tenants should now be estopped from claiming that they resided outside of New York when 
they purchased their apartments. Defendants' Post-Trial Memorandum of Law at 12-13. The Court here is concerned only with 
whether, as a factual matter, defendants' alleged tying arrangement involved interstate commerce; misrepresentations tenants 
allegedly made at the time of subscription are relevant only to the extent defendants claim the tenants are presently not being 
truthful. The Court, however, credits the affidavits. Moreover, the documents that defendants claim ""contain[] an affirmative 
representation by each subscriber that he or she was a resident in the State of New York,"" Id. at 12, do not in fact show that all 
subscribers resided in New York State. See DTE TTT (Subscription Agreements of Brownstein (Pennsylvania address listed), 
Katz (Connecticut address listed), Harrari (Virginia address listed), Stockman (California address listed), Garrett (New 
Hampshire address listed)). In addition, over 40 of the subscription agreements list no address. DTE TTT."

several states, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. "
128,7," Tenants who sold their apartments within three years of the conversion were assessed a transfer fee or ""flip tax"" by Owners 
Corp. Tenant lawyer Sonnenschein testified that three to five years is the most commonly used period for such an assessment. "
129,," Recognizing that there are many reasons, both anticipated and unanticipated, that lead a homeowner to sell, the Court believes 
it is fair to assume that those who sold within three years of the cooperative conversion did not view their apartments as unique."
129,8," The Court is not persuaded by plaintiffs' claim that remaining in the Building as a rent stabilized tenant would have been 
untenable. Plaintiffs did not substantiate their bald assertion that rent-stabilized tenants living in a cooperative building receive 
substandard treatment, and their claim that the future of rent stabilization is uncertain is inconsistent with their argument that the 
""insider price"" is not a bargain price but ""merely reflects the value of the existing rent stabilized lease."" Plaintiffs' Trial 
Memorandum of Law at 7. Market forces would not result in rent stabilized tenants receiving a substantial discount on the 
purchase of their apartments if buyers and sellers viewed the right of rent stabilized tenants to remain in their apartments as so 
uncertain."
129,9," Justice O'Connor's concurrence in Jefferson Parish, in which she was joined by three other Justices, states that in order to 
succeed on a tying claim, a plaintiff must show that there is ""a substantial threat that the tying seller will acquire market power in 
the tied-product market."" 466 U.S. at 38 (emphasis added). While the Second Circuit has not adopted this more stringent 
standard (and neither does this Court), other courts have done so. See Carl Sandburg Village Condo. Assn. v. First Condo, 758 
F.2d 203, 210 (7th Cir. 1985); Will v. Comprehensive Accounting Corp., 776 F.2d 665, 674 (7th Cir. 1985); Smith Machinery Co., "

Sterling Electric, 826 F.2d 712, 719 (7th Cir. 1987)."
130,10," The Court has pendent jurisdiction over this cause of action. See United Mine Workers of America v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 16 
L. Ed. 2d 218, 86 S. Ct. 1130 (1966). "
131,11," Even if the proper inquiry were to examine the commercial lease in isolation, the court still does not find this provision 
unconscionable. See Wolowitz, 468 N.Y.S.2d at 145 (""while there may be extreme cases where a contractual term is so 
outrageous and oppressive as to warrant a finding of unconscionability irrespective of the contract formation process . . . such 
cases are the exception"")."
131,12," Plaintiffs have never requested that this Court find the Plan as a whole unconscionable nor did any plaintiff tenant indicate at 
trial that he or she made the wrong decision by subscribing to the Plan as finally offered by defendants. "
136,1," All of the individual defendants are alleged to occupy positions that involve supervision or examination of thrifts insured by the 
Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (""FSLIC""). "
137,2," In their opposition brief, plaintiffs allege that their complaint also contains the following claims: 1) negligent hiring and 
supervision of the examination staff; 2) malicious prosecution and abuse of process; 3) intentional infliction of emotional distress, 
4) violation of the criminal conflicts of interest statute and 5) some constitutional claims which appear to involve an unlawful 
delegation and a First Amendment violation. "
138,3," Such alleged improper delegation supposedly nullifies the cease-and-desist order that bars Saratoga from violating certain 
FHLBB regulations and from engaging in unsafe and unsound practices. However, after the FHLBB issued the cease-and-desist 
order, Saratoga timely appealed to the Ninth Circuit where the matter is still pending. The National Housing Act vests in the 
Courts of Appeals exclusive jurisdiction to review the FHLBB's order and further explicitly precludes federal district courts from 
taking any action other than enforcing valid and outstanding cease-and-desist orders. 12 U.S.C § 1730(j)(2). Therefore, this 
court has no jurisdiction to nullify the order."
138,4," Saratoga also alleges that the FHLBB's agents unlawfully disclosed confidential information obtained in examinations and 
seeks to enjoin the FHLBB from any release of such information. However, HN6[
] FHLBB information (such as any reports of 
examination, underlying examiners' notes and workpapers, and supervisory correspondence) has been held to be the exclusive 
property of the FHLBB. Colonial Savings and Loan Ass'n v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Insurance Co., 89 F.R.D. 481, 483 (D. Kan. 
1980). The courts have recognized the FHLBB's discretion to release or withhold such information as it sees fit. Id.; Overby v. 
United States Fidelity and Guaranty Co., 224 F.2d 158 (5th Cir. 1955). "
139,5," In addition, Count 6, alleging violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act, must be dismissed against the individual defendants. ""The 
United States, its agencies and officials, remain outside the reach of the Sherman Act."" Sea-Land Service, Inc. v. Alaska 
Railroad, 212 U.S. App. D.C. 197, 659 F.2d 243, 246 (D.C.Cir. 1981). "
141,6," The Tort Reform Act mandates substitution of the United States in place of individually-named federal officials on all claims 
except those which arise under the United States Constitution or federal statute. 28 U.S.C. § 2679(b)(2). Therefore, were these 
claims to be viable, the individual defendants would still be parties to this suit. "
150,1," In May 1983 after bifurcated trial on the damages issue, the jury eventually awarded the Raiders $ 11,550,000 and the L.A. 
Coliseum $ 4,860,000.  The court trebled those awards.  The NFL appealed.  That appeal was decided in Los Angeles Memorial 
Coliseum Com'n v. NFL (9th Cir. 1986) 791 F.2d 1356."
150,2," Klein's complaint also attempted to allege causes of action for abuse of process and intentional infliction of emotional distress.  
The court granted summary judgment favoring the Raiders and Davis on Klein's cause of action for abuse of process.  The court 
granted judgment on the pleadings favoring the Raiders and Davis on Klein's claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.  
Those rulings are not at issue on this appeal. "
151,3," As will appear, this recent Supreme Court decision clarifying the law of malicious prosecution is central to our disposition.  In 
that regard, our analytical task has been far simpler than that which faced the able trial judge who heard this complex and hard-
fought case before the Supreme Court's opinion."
151,4," We reject Klein's contention that by participating in drafting the jury instruction on probable cause the Raiders and Davis waived 
any appellate attack involving the probable cause issue.  Nothing in their participation in drafting the jury instruction suggests the 
Raiders and Davis acquiesced in the court's ruling the probable cause issue should go to the jury.  Participation by the Raiders 
and Davis in drafting the jury instruction on probable cause was not an agreement the court was right.  Instead, such 
involvement by the Raiders and Davis constituted an accommodation to the reality the litigation was at a stage where they had 
lost on their contention probable cause was a question of law. Under those circumstances the Raiders and Davis simply made a 
tactical decision to continue participating in the trial on the battleground defined by the court. "
154,5," In Brown v. Donco Enterprises, Inc., supra, 783 F.2d at page 646, the court stated: ""It is undisputed that HN8[
] a 
corporation's officers and agents may be held individually liable for corporate actions that violate the antitrust laws if they 
authorize or participate in the unlawful acts."""
154,6," An allegation corporate defendants and their agent conspired with a third party was noted without adverse judicial comment in 
Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., supra, 467 U.S. at pages 757-758, footnote 1 [81 L.Ed.2d at page 635]. "
156,7," Klein contends the federal district court's directed verdict in his favor has a res judicata or collateral estoppel effect on the issue 
of probable cause. It does not.  The directed verdict involved only an ultimate assessment of liability.  The issue before us is 
whether a reasonable attorney could think tenable the Raiders' claim Klein could be individually liable. "
157,8, The text of the jury instruction on probable cause is set out at Appendix A. 
164,1," In addition to the Verified Complaint, filed on March 16, 1989 (the ""Complaint""), several submissions -- both legal and factual -- 
have been filed in connection with plaintiffs' application for preliminary injunctive relief. These submissions, to the extent they are 
referred to herein, are identified as follows: Plaintiffs' Memorandum in Support of Application for Preliminary Injunctive Relief filed 
March 31, 1989 (""Plaintiffs' Br."") (Plaintiffs' Br. supercedes a prior moving brief, filed March 16, 1989, which prior brief has been 
withdrawn); Affidavit of John A. Fressie, filed March 16, 1989 (""Fressie Aff.""); Memorandum of Defendant Reese Finer Foods in 
Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunctive Relief, filed April 14, 1989 (""Defendants' Br.""); Affidavit of John Beers, "
165,," filed April 14, 1987 (""Beers Aff.""); Affidavit of Vernon L. Hevner (previously filed in a related ""state court action,"" defined below), 
filed April 14, 1989 (""Hevner Aff.""); Plaintiffs' Reply Memorandum in Support of Their Motion for Preliminary Injunctive Relief, 
filed April 24, 1989 (Plaintiffs' Reply Br.""); Reply Affidavit of John A. Fressie, filed April 24, 1989 (""Fressie Reply Aff."");

Reply Certification of John A. Fressie, filed May 9, 1989 (""Fressie Reply Cert.""); Affidavits of the following individual defendants 
(previously filed in the state court action), filed on May 22, 1989: Dorf, Kehe, Greenhouse, Wine and Beers (collectively, the 
""defendants' state court affidavits""); Letter Brief of Defendants, filed on May 23, 1989 (""Defendants' Letter Brief"")."
165,2," On September 30, 1988, in response to the termination, Bascom Food and Fressie filed an action against the present 
defendants in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Chancery Division, Bergen County, Docket No. C-17324-88E (the ""state court 
action""), seeking damages for breach of Bascom Food's express or implied management contract, for breach of fiduciary duties 
and for other claims."
165,3," On the issue of how the voting trust was established, and why, various defendants stated in affidavits filed in the state court 
action: Finally, after years of disenchantment with Fressie, I and other shareholder/distributors saw an opportunity to get someone 
to run Reese who would be accountable to the Reese shareholder/distributors. A group of shareholder/distributors including Jerry Kehe, Gary Greenhouse, Lee Schultz and me (sic) consulted with 
counsel as to how best to proceed with the replacement of Fressie and the termination of the Reese-Bascom management 
relationship. The method chosen was a voting trust in which one person, the trustee of the trust, would vote the shares of 
all members. See defendants' state court affidavits, paras. 6-7. "
166,4," At oral argument, counsel for defendants indicated Reese Foods was expanding its staff to some degree, the suggestion being 
that it was actually more than a paper corporation or conduit of the defendants. Reese Foods, however, continues to be owned 
entirely by a number of the distributors. "
167,5," Beers estimates that the United States pasta market share is dominated by Borden with twenty-five percent, Hershey with 
eighteen percent, CPC Int. with fifteen percent, General Foods with eight percent and Quaker Oats with three percent. These 
""giants"" in the food industry thus control sixty-nine percent of the retail pasta market. Beers Aff., para. 4."
167,6," The Reese Foods products which may well have a ""market impact,"" particularly if these products are somewhat unique, 
include: artichokes (with 1988 sales of $ 3.7 million), certain kinds of fish (with 1988 sales of $ 5.3 million), various kinds of pasta 
(with aggregate 1988 sales of several million dollars) and various Mexican food products (with 1988 sales of several million 
dollars)."
167,7," In an effort to demonstrate his autonomy and independence from the shareholders who elected him, Beers states that: ""There 
are no Reese shareholder votes or board of director actions required to confirm [his] authority to take actions in areas of [his] "
168,," CEO authority and responsibility. This CEO authority is ensured by both a two-year employment contract and by a voting trust of 
a majority of Reese corporate stock supporting [Beers'] management."" Beers Aff., para. 2."
168,8," Beers, as a justification of the decision to deny Fressie distributor status, contends, among other things, Fressie has a record of 
self dealing, Fressie sells a competitive line of products, Fressie would attempt to destroy the market position of Reese Foods, 
Fressie and Bascom Food are not full line specialty food distributors and Fressie has brought lawsuits against Reese Foods. 
Beers Aff., para. 10. It is noted that the lawsuits referred to by Beers involve the refusal of Reese Foods to deal with Fressie. Accordingly, the 
lawsuits do not logically form a separate basis for the current refusal to deal. Moreover, on the issue of the degree to which 
Fressie, through malice or inability, might cause Reese Foods' market position damage in any way, Fressie has stated: ""If, at the 
end of one year of free and open competition, Bascom is not buying and selling at least as much Reese product as the current 
lowest volume Reese distributor, I will surrender my Reese shares to the corporation for nothing."" Fressie Reply Aff., para. 27. In 
light of the absence of persuasive support for Beers' flat accusations against Fressie and the foregoing representation, it does 
not appear as though Fressie presents any particular danger to Reese Foods; the justifications advanced by Beers appear to be 
pretextual."
168,9," A copy of this December 19, 1988 memorandum from Beers to the Reese Foods shareholders was supplied at oral argument 
by counsel to plaintiffs."
168,10," As indicated, Fressie has brought the state court action to redress his termination from management of Reese Foods. The refusal by defendants to deal with Fressie as a Reese Foods distributor occurred for the first time in December of 1988. On 
December 23, 1988, Bascom Food ordered ten containers of Reese Foods' DaVinci pasta, at a cost of approximately $ 167,000. 
Bascom Food's order was confirmed by written purchase orders, #5002-5011, dated December 27, 1988. On January 26, 1989, 
Bascom Food also purchased three thousand bundles of smoked oysters from other Reese Foods distributors for resale to the 
specialty foods retail market. By memorandum, dated January 27, 1989, defendant Beers on behalf of Reese Foods, demanded 
to know what Bascom Food intended to do with the DaVinci pasta. Defendants refused to fill the order until Fressie provided that 
information. By letter, dated February 17, 1989, Beers stated to Fressie: ""Please be advised that effective March 20, 1989 
Bascom Food Products, Inc. will be discontinued as a food service distributor."" "
169,11," In this context the term ""free-rider"" refers to a market imperfection which creates a disincentive for individual distributors to 
incur the costs of promoting a product and providing extensive service to the customer. Because another distributor might incur 
the expenses to promote the product and provide customer service, ""free riders"" are able to successfully sell the product, at a 
lesser cost, by enjoying the benefit of increased demand created by the efforts of others. Because of the free-rider effect, these 
services might not be provided by distributors in a purely competitive situation. See Posner, Antitrust Policy and the Supreme 
Court: An Analysis of the Restricted Distribution, Horizontal Merger and Potential Competition Decisions, 75 Columbia L. Rev. 
282, 285 n. 13 (1975); P. Samuelson, Economics 506-507 (10th ed. 1976). The free-rider problem was invoked as a justification 
for certain territorial restrictions in the landmark decision of Continental T.V., Inc. v. G.T.E. Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 55, 53 L. 
Ed. 2d 568, 97 S. Ct. 2549 (1977), a case involving restraints in the context of vertical distribution arrangements."
169,12," While plaintiffs argue stock ownership entitles the members of Reese Foods to sell Reese Foods products, there appears to 
be no dispute that termination of such rights may occur under certain defined circumstances which are set forth in the 
shareholders' agreement. In this connection, the stock of Irving Fien, a former shareholder/distributor, was repurchased by 
Reese Foods in 1976 because he was not selling a sufficient amount of Reese Food products to adequately support the Reese 
Foods product line. Inadequate sales is a specific ground set forth in the Reese Foods uniform shareholder agreement for "
170,," repurchasing a shareholder's stock. When Fien reapplied to become a distributor in 1986, Reese Foods had decided to create 
contractual distributors, but not to issue any new shares of stock in the corporation Fressie Reply Aff., para. 6. The following observation was made by a long-time attorney for Reese Foods: ""Until Reese's present exclusion of Fressie and 
Bascom, only three shareholders whose conduct transgressed the limitations imposed by the shareholder agreement had their 
right to purchase revoked and their shares repurchased by Reese. In each instance, the shareholder had violated the 
shareholder agreement by failing to sell a sufficient quantity of Reese products."" Bennett Cert., para. 10. Counsel for the defendants made an issue at oral argument of the fact that Reese Foods' former attorney has supplied evidence 
in support of plaintiffs' application for injunctive relief. After it was noted that any irregularities should be addressed now (rather 
than in connection with the inevitable appeal in this matter), all counsel for the defendants agreed that the evidence offered by 
Mr. Bennett (particularly his opinion that the distribution restraints constituted per se violations of the antitrust laws) was not 
critical to plaintiffs' present application. While the antitrust advice of counsel over a period of years might be relevant to the 
existence of a formal distribution policy, and notice to defendants of its possible illegality, such advice does not bear on the 
conclusions to be drawn in this matter."
170,13," Moreover, while the burden rests upon the moving party to make these two requisite showings, a district court ""should take 
into account, when they are relevant, (3) the possibility of harm to other interested persons from the grant or denial of the 
injunction, and (4) the public interest."" Id. "
171,14," The standard of proof for preliminary injunction applications thus does not require conclusiveness. In re Arthur Treacher's 
Franchisee Litigation, 689 F.2d 1137 (3d Cir. 1982). See also Jackson Dairy, Inc. v. H.P. Hood & Sons, Inc., 596 F.2d 70, 72 (2d 
Cir. 1979) (application must raise sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation); 
Hamilton Watch Co. v. Benrus Watch Co., 206 F.2d 738, 740 (2d Cir. 1953) (""To justify a temporary injunction it is not necessary 
that the plaintiff's right to a final decision, after a trial, be absolutely certain, wholly without doubt . . . . it will ordinarily be enough 
that the plaintiff has raised questions going to the merits so serious, substantial, difficult and doubtful, as to make them a fair 
ground for litigation."") It has always been the rule that the movant bears the burden of persuasion to establish the situation meets the standard for a 
preliminary injunction, and must offer proof beyond the unverified allegations of the pleadings. Arthur Treacher's, supra; 
Thermex Co. v. Lawson, 25 F. Supp. 414 (E.D. Ill. 1938). HN4[
] -"
171,15," Section one of the Sherman Act provides, in relevant part: HN6[
] Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce 
among the several states, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. . . ."
171,15, U.S.C. § 1. 
173,16," Plaintiffs have claimed that the defendants have violated the Sherman Act by (1) agreeing to divide up territories on a 
horizontal basis and by (2) enforcing a group boycott against the plaintiffs. While it does not appear the success of plaintiffs' first 
claim necessarily depends upon the existence of dominant market power in various Reese Foods products, the success of the 
group boycott claim, under recent Supreme Court authority, would appear to require either market power in, or uniqueness of, 
various food products. "
174,17," Plaintiffs argue that Beers, as the CEO, was simply hired to carry out the policies and directives of the horizontal competitors 
which comprise the Reese Foods Board of Directors. Complaint para. 38; Bennett Certification para. 38. The minutes of the 
March 21, 1988 Steering Committee meeting attached to Beers' affidavit state the reason Beers was selected to replace Fressie 
as Reese Foods' CEO was to insure: (i) ""the company will be accountable to the stockholders rather than the environment now 
where [Mr. Fressie] runs things the way he wants to;"" and (ii) ""[the company] is responsive to the distributors."" Id. "
175,18," Fressie vigorously refutes the suggestion he has never functioned as a Reese Foods distributor. While he declined full 
distributorship status when he had his responsibilities and salary as CEO of Reese Foods, Fressie states that for approximately 
the past ten years, Bascom Food has sold Reese Foods products to specialty foods retail distributors in the New York 
metropolitan area and in other areas where adequate Reese Foods distributors could not be found. Bascom Food did this work 
for Reese Foods' account and turned the revenues over to Reese Foods. These sales, according to plaintiffs, have always been 
reflected in Reese Foods' gross sales. Fressie Reply Aff., para. 9. "
176,19," Another interesting issue would arise in the case where the distributors or licensees (horizontal competitors) owned less than 
""substantially all"" of the stock of the purported ""instrumentality."" Where the horizontal competitors own all of the stock, they are 
one and the same with the licensor or cooperative entity and it must be concluded that no independent third party entity exists. 
Where lesser percentages of the stock are held by horizontal competitors, however, it begins to appear as though, at least to 
some degree, a bona fide third party exists which has an influence over the terms of the distribution arrangement, but which is 
not a horizontal competitor. In short, with less than complete ownership of the stock by horizontal competitors, the arrangement 
begins to develop vertical characteristics. An analogy to the antitrust doctrine articulated in Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Co., 467 U.S. 752, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628, 
104 S. Ct. 2731 (1984), might be made. While Copperweld held that parent corporations and wholly-owned subsidiaries (which 
have complete ""unities of interest"") are to be considered one and the same party for purposes of the two person requirement for 
a conspiracy, the Court specifically declined to address whether less than wholly-owned subsidiaries would be deemed to have 
similar ""unities of interest."" As in Copperweld, the issue here is whether Reese Foods should be considered one and the same 
as the individual distributors, with all parties sharing a ""unity of interest."" Since Copperweld, there has not been a conclusive answer to the question: To what extent do dilutions in percentage ownership 
of a subsidiary cause one to conclude there is no longer a unity of interest? Compare Magnum Force Distribs. v. Bon Bon Co. of 
Am., No. 84-2629 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 9, 1984) (holding, without discussion, that a parent and its 60% owned subsidiary were 
incapable of conspiring) with Comment, The Intra-Enterprise Conspiracy Doctrine After Copperweld Corp. v. Independence 
Tube Corp., 86 Colum. L. Rev. 198 (1986) (criticizing Magnum Force and arguing that a parent corporation and less than wholly-
owned subsidiaries should not necessarily be viewed as one economic entity, and that a case by case approach should be 
adopted to determine whether parent companies and partially owned subsidiaries have a complete unity of interest). It appears that when a parent company owns less than all of the stock of a subsidiary, a closer examination must be made to 
determine whether a unity of interest exists. Similarly, it is suggested here that, in assessing whether an arrangement is vertical 
or horizontal, it is necessary to look more closely at Sealy-type entities when they are not entirely, or almost entirely, owned by 
the alleged horizontal competitors. An examination must be made, in particular, into whether an entity other than a horizontal 
competitor (or its affiliates) owns enough of the stock of the Sealy-type entity and actually exercises significant control over the 
terms of distribution."
176,20," As indicated, plaintiffs argue the real motive for defendants' refusal to allow them to sell Reese Foods products is to prevent 
them from competing against defendants in the sale of Reese Foods products. It is alleged retailers and consumers are deprived 
of Reese Foods products at competitive prices because of defendants' horizontal agreements. To the extent it is concluded defendants' conduct in this case is governed by a per se analysis, an inquiry into their purported 
good motives would not be necessary. A brief discussion of the antitrust merits of this case under a rule of reason analysis is 
nonetheless set forth below. It is suggested that, if a rule of reason analysis were to be conclusive, further evidence would have 
to be adduced concerning, among other things, the need to enforce the territorial restrictions in a way that precludes Fressie 
from selling any Reese Foods products. "
178,21," In BMI, the Supreme Court recognized that the defendants were offering a product -- the monitoring and enforcement against 
unauthorized copyright use -- which would be difficult and expensive for the copyright owners to substitute if the defendants 
were prohibited from engaging in the cooperative practice."
178,22," See Rothery Storage & Van Lines, Inc. v. Atlas Van Lines, 253 U.S. App. D.C. 142, 792 F.2d 210, 226 (D.C. Cir. 1986), cert. 
denied, 479 U.S. 1033, 93 L. Ed. 2d 834, 107 S. Ct. 880 (1987) (J. Bork) (""if Topco meant, as it seemed to, that the existence of 
a joint venture could not justify an agreement eliminating competition between the joint venturers, [those subsequent decisions] . 
. . must be read as overruling Topco to that extent.""). "
180,23," Several courts have indicated ""classic"" group boycotts remain subject to the per se rule. See Zimmerman v. Pepsico, Inc., 836 
F.2d 173, 183 (3d Cir. 1988); Charley's Taxi Radio Dispatch Corp. v. SIDA of Hawaii, Inc., 810 F.2d 869, 877-878 (9th Cir. 
1987); Goss v. Memorial Hospital System, 789 F.2d 353, 354-355 (5th Cir. 1986); Seaboard Supply Co. v. Congoleum Corp., 
770 F.2d 367, 374 (3d Cir. 1985)"
180,24," As an additional argument why Reese Foods products are competitively significant, Fressie has explained that many 
customers will not buy non-Reese Foods products from a distributor who does not carry Reese Foods products as well. Some 
customers will prefer to deal with a single distributor which carries all product lines. "
181,25," GTE Sylvania noted an important distinction between vertical nonprice and vertical price restraints. There was support for the 
proposition that vertical price restraints reduce inter brand price competition because they ""'facilitate cartelizing.'"" Id. at 51, n. 18. 
There does not appear to be a similar danger of the cartel-facilitating effect resulting from vertical nonprice restraints. "
182,26," It has been suggested that Frank's GMC should not apply with full force in this case because this case involves antitrust 
issues, which are somehow of greater public concern. While the public interest is a factor to be considered in granting injunctive 
relief, Arthur Treachers, 689 F.2d at 1143, it has been stated that in determining whether to issue a preliminary injunction under 
the antitrust laws, ""there is nothing exceptional by reason of the presence of antitrust elements; the normal principles of equity 
are applicable."" Amigo Gift Ass'n v. Executive Properties, Ltd., 588 F. Supp. 654, 657 (W.D. Mo. 1984) (citing Kay Instrument 
Sales Co. v. Haldex Aktiebolag, 296 F. Supp. 578, 579 (S.D.N.Y. 1968)). It has been concluded that defendants' apparent conduct in this matter, if it can be proved at trial, constitutes a violation of the 
Sherman Act and asserted justifications for the conduct will not be considered under the rule of reason analysis. It is noted that 
the existence of a per se violation of the antitrust laws appears to bear on the other criteria (i.e., in addition to the likelihood of 
success on the merits) for a preliminary injunction. For example, on the issue of the public interest, discussed below, it is surely 
in the public interest to prevent per se violations of the law. "
183,27," As discussed, neither Fressie nor Bascom Food have a lengthy history of operations which can be referred to in an attempt to 
measure the loss of revenues due to the defendants' refusal to deal. "
184,28," The issue of proving damages, in particular those which were purported to be speculative, was discussed in connection with 
certain state law claims."
184,29," Plaintiffs in this case have argued that there are not really comparable specialty food distributors of Reese Foods products. 
Fressie claims that he is ""Mr. Reese"" and that he has the most goodwill after devoting nearly two decades to promoting Reese 
Foods products. "
185,30," Defendants have argued that, where a distributor sells a product for only a short time prior to its termination, the distributor's 
damages are not so uncertain as to constitute irreparable harm. (Citing Jack Kahn Music v. Baldwin Piano & Organ, Inc., 604 
F.2d 755, 759 (2d Cir. 1979) (dealership terminated after one and a half years; preliminary injunction denied because dealership 
had insufficient time to build up good will); American Can Co. v. A.B. Dick, Bus. Franchise Guide (CCH) P 8097 (S.D.N.Y. 1983) 
(no good will accumulated by plaintiff after selling product for less than one month; preliminary injunction denied). Defendants' 
Brief, p. 10. In this case, however, Fressie has made a strong showing that he has been developing his good will in the Reese 
Foods products for several years. "
186,31," Plaintiffs have offered to make this undertaking a condition to the issuance of an injunction. Rule 65(c) HN22[
] requires a 
party seeking a preliminary injunction to post a security bond for the limited purpose of protecting the enjoined party from 
damages incurred as a result of the wrongful issuance of an injunction. Commerce Tankers v. National Maritime Union of 
America, 553 F.2d 793 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 923, 54 L. Ed. 2d 280, 98 S. Ct. 400 (1977). The amount of the bond is a 
matter within the discretion of the court. Similarly, the amount of damages awarded on a bond is discretionary, to be based on 
considerations of equity and justice. Kansas v. Adams, 705 F.2d 1267 (10th Cir. 1983). Courts may dispense with a bond or 
require only nominal bonds under certain circumstances. Where statutes provide that private actions be brought in the public 
interest, minimal amounts are often set by the court. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. Morton, 337 F. Supp. 167 
(D.D.C. 1971) (suit to enjoin government under National Environmental Policy Act - government asks bond of $ 750,000, bond 
set at $ 100). While the record suggests that a share of Reese Foods stock (which, when Reese Foods was founded on August 20, 1971 
Fressie paid ""a few hundred dollars"" for one share of stock) does not have a ready determinable value, there must be a way of 
determining the value. As indicated above, certain shareholders not complying with the shareholders agreement (i.e., Fien) have 
had their shares repurchased. In addition to the foregoing undertaking, plaintiffs will also post a bond in the amount of $ 50,000. The amount of a possible bond 
has not been addressed by the parties. While the amount established hereby appears to be reasonable, either side may object 
to the amount by filing a brief on or before June 9, 1989, with responsive briefs to be filed on or before June 16, 1989. If 
necessary, oral argument will be had (on the issue of the amount of the bond) on June 20, 1989. "

199,3," The district court noted that these theories were improperly pled as separate counts because the plaintiffs only have one cause

economics from North Carolina State University, and give this affidavit in the above-captioned matter."
206,2," . I have reviewed the depositions of the plaintiffs in this action, the deposition of Ronald Pelletier, the enrollment contracts 
produced by the defendants, and the deposition of Professor David Kamershen taken in the case of Edwards et al. v. BRG 
of Georgia, Inc., C.A. No. 82-13-Ath together with the exhibits thereto."
206,3," . Upon review of the depositions of the named plaintiffs and the deposition of Ronald Pelletier it is apparent that nearly all 
students at University of Georgia School of Law take the defendants' bar review course. Because the students taking the 
course are also enrolled as full-time students at the law school in Athens, it is not realistic to expect that they could "
207,," reasonable [sic] take a course offered outside the Athens area. Further, Ronald Pelletier testified that defendants 
accounted for at least eighty percent of the sales of bar review courses in the Athens area."
207,4," . I conclude that a comprehensive bar review course which includes lectures and written material offered in Athens, Georgia 
to prepare students to take the Georgia bar examination is the relevant product market and that Athens is a relevant 
geographic market for purposes of economic analysis. I further conclude that defendants have and have had the power to 
control prices in the market, and that defendants therefore have monopoly power in the relevant geographic and product 
markets. This the 12th day of May, 1986. /s/ William R. Henry Dr. William Henry"
207,1," I concur in Part II of the majority opinion (upholding district court's denial of Rule 11 sanctions). I disagree, however, with the 
majority's conclusion in Part I that the district court's denial of class certification was not an abuse of discretion. The premise of 
the district court's order was that the plaintiffs ""may lack financial commitment sufficient for adequate investigation and trial 
preparation in light of the court's ruling [granting summary judgment on all counts except the rule of reason claim]."" The record 
reflects that the plaintiffs' counsel was qualified and experienced, and prepared this case from its inception in a competent and 
professional manner. The plaintiffs' alleged lack of financial commitment was simply not a factor in their trial counsels' 
presentation of their case. I believe that the district court's misperceptions regarding the evidence necessary to establish the "
208,," asserted antitrust violations, discussed infra, resulted in the court erroneously denying class certification based on the plaintiffs' 
purported ""lack of financial commitment."" I would therefore reverse the district court on this issue."
208,2," Prior to 1979, BRG's predecessor, defendant Bar Review Group, Inc., offered the bar review course in Georgia. During 1979, 
Pelletier formed two corporations: BRG of Georgia (BRG) and BRG Publications. For purposes of this opinion, references to the 
defendant BRG includes Pelletier as well."
208,3," HBJ originally retailed its bar review courses directly to consumers but has since modified its retailing strategy to include about 
19 licensees who have the exclusive or non-exclusive right to provide HBJ bar review courses. HBJ does not concurrently offer 
its course at retail in competition with any of these licensees."
208,4," The review courses were administered in three cities, Atlanta, Athens, and Macon, where law schools were located."
208,5," Their first meeting was arranged by one of Conviser's attorneys in Chicago who had contacted Pelletier by phone. Conviser 
flew to Atlanta, Georgia and met Pelletier at the Coach & Six restaurant where they discussed ""in passing"" the possibility of 
Bar/Bri purchasing BRG or BRG buying HBJ's Georgia operations. Record, Vol. 1, Tab 2, at 10-11. Pelletier later flew to Chicago 
where he and Conviser discussed a licensing arrangement or buy-out. Id. Pelletier returned to Atlanta where a third meeting was 
held to discuss a possible licensing arrangement. Id."
208,6," The 1980 agreement contained two provisions one termed a ""Covenant Not to Compete"" and the other entitled ""Other 
Ventures."" Record, Vol. 2, Tab 13 at E10, E15. The former required HBJ not to directly or indirectly ""own, manage, operate, join, 
invest, control, or participate in or be connected as an officer, employee, partner, director, independent contractor or otherwise "
209,," with any business which is operating or participating in the preparation of candidates for the Georgia State Bar Examination."" Id. 
at E10. The latter required BRG not to compete against HBJ in states in which HBJ currently operated outside the state of 
Georgia. Id. at E15."
209,7," The nine count complaint alleges the defendants engaged in: (1) horizontal price-fixing; (2) geographic market allocations; (3) 
concerted refusals to deal; (4) an unreasonable joint venture; (5) a conspiracy to monopolize bar review written materials and 
lecture services in Georgia; (6) an attempt to monopolize bar review written materials and lecture services in Georgia; (7) 
monopolization of bar review written materials and lecture services in Georgia; (8) a conspiracy to monopolize bar review written 
materials and lecture services nationwide; and (9) an attempt to monopolize bar review written materials and lecture services 
nationwide."
209,8," In its January 9, 1987 order the court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment on counts 1-9. The court, however, 
permitted the plaintiffs to recast counts 1-4 under the rule of reason. "
210,9," The common concern in Matsushita and Monsanto is that a court's denial of summary judgment based merely on speculative 
inferences from ambiguous evidence could deter or penalize perfectly legitimate and procompetitive conduct. Because legitimate 
price-cutting is the ""very essence of competition,"" allowing ""mistaken inferences"" to result in antitrust liability chills ""the very 
conduct the antitrust laws are designed to protect."" Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 594, 106 S. Ct. at 1360 (citing Monsanto). The 
Supreme Court therefore adopted more exacting evidentiary standards to separate permissible procompetitive business 
practices from proscribed anticompetitive practices in antitrust actions based on business conduct that facially supports either 
practice. Consequently, both cases reinvigorated the use of summary judgment to summarily dismiss certain antitrust actions 
based on circumstantial evidence and speculative economic theories."
210,10," Criticism of the broad application of predatory pricing theories abounds. See, e.g., R. Blair & D. Kaserman, Antitrust 
Economics, 121-128 (1985) (predatory pricing may preserve or enhance, but cannot create, market power); R. Bork, The 
Antitrust Paradox: A Policy at War with Itself, 144-59 (1978) (debunking most predatory pricing theories); R. Posner, Antitrust 
Law: An Economic Perspective, 184-96 (1976) (narrowly limiting predation to practices designed to exclude an equally or more 
efficient competitor). Vertical price-fixing has also been severely critiqued. See, e.g., R. Blair & D. Kaserman, Law and 
Economics of Vertical Integration and Control, 157-61 (1983) (law condemns vertical price maintenance despite potentially 
beneficial economic effects); R. Blair, supra, at 280-98 (virtually all vertical restraints benefit consumers and should be lawful)."
210,11," Notably, the plaintiffs in this action allege a conspiracy between two corporations and their respective officers. This situation is 
unlike the predatory pricing scheme involving twenty-one defendants that the Supreme Court found implausible in Matsushita. "
211,12," The plaintiffs' price-fixing and market allocation claims are the types that courts and economists have long condemned as per 
se violations of the Sherman Act. Their rule of reason and monopolization claims are similarly founded upon widely accepted 
economic principles."

212,17," Both provide the same type of service, bar review courses, and both are capable of providing their services in the same 
geographic locations (absent their agreements)."
212,18," The district court stated that: Neither agreement between BRG and [HBJ] constitutes the sort of market or customer allocation agreement which has 
been recognized as a basis of per se liability. Cf.  Topco, 405 U.S. 596 [92 S. Ct. 1126, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515]. This is not a 
situation where competitors divided up a market in which both have previously done business, each taking a portion of a 
market. BRG has never done business outside the state of Georgia, and nothing in the record suggests that it ever 
intended to do so. [HBJ] as noted has done business virtually nationwide, but withdrew from the Georgia market following 
the 1980 agreement between BRG and [HBJ]. Thus, the only market ever claimed by both Defendants is the state of 
Georgia, and clearly the state of Georgia was not divided up under either the 1980 or 1982 agreements. Order, January 9, 1987 at 8 (emphasis added). "
213,19," To use the district court's parlance, BRG and HBJ divided the Georgia market by allocating 0% for HBJ and 100% for BRG 
and divided the national market by allocating 100% for HBJ and 0% for BRG."
213,20," The district court held that: the agreement is not a classic form of price fixing where two competitors agree what price they will charge for their 
products. On the contrary, neither agreement explicitly addresses the factor of price, and [HBJ] has never had any right 
under either the 1980 or 1982 agreement to be consulted about the price of the BRG course. While it is true that the 
agreement of two competitors to ""pool"" their products may exert an upward influence on price, such an agreement is not 
inherently anticompetitive, and in a given setting could actually be procompetitive. Order, January 9, 1987, at 7-8. "

terminate the practice of giving credit falls squarely within the traditional per se rule against price-fixing); National Society of Prof. 
Eng. v. U.S., 435 U.S. 679, 98 S. Ct. 1355, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1978) (agreement that interferes with setting of price by free 
market forces is illegal on its face)."

allocation agreement designed to prevent commercial rivalry and support price fixing conspiracy)."
214,24, See infra note 31. 
215,25," Because the district court erred in finding that the 1980 agreement did not constitute a per se violation, it did not address 
whether the 1982 modified agreement constituted a withdrawal from or abandonment of the conspiracy. In United States v. 
Kissel, 218 U.S. 601, 31 S. Ct. 124, 54 L. Ed. 1168 (1910), the Supreme Court held that antitrust conspiracies may continue in 
time beyond the original conspiratorial agreement until either the conspiracy's objectives are abandoned or succeed.  Id. at 608-
09, 31 S. Ct. at 126. For example, a conspiracy continues so long as one or more conspirators continue to receive payments 
under a collusive contract because the conspirators continue to realize a central and obvious objective of the conspiracy (i.e. 
illicit profits).  United States v. Dynalectric Co., 859 F.2d 1559, 1563-69 (11th Cir. 1988); United States v. Aquafredda, 834 
F.2d 915, 919 (11th Cir. 1987), cert. denied sub nom., Agostino v. United States, 485 U.S. 980, 108 S. Ct. 1278, 99 L. Ed. 2d 
489 (1988). In the absence of proof of withdrawal, the conspirators are presumed to continue in their conspiracy particularly 
where they continue to share the fruits of their conspiracy, in this case through the revenue-sharing provision in the 1980 and 
1982 agreements.  Dynalectric, 859 F.2d at 1563-69; Aquafredda, 834 F.2d at 919 (antitrust defendants' continued sharing of 
revenues and professional and social affiliations permits inference of continued conspiracy). Thus, it is an unsettled factual issue 
whether the conspiratorial objectives manifest in the 1980 agreement between HBJ and BRG have continued despite the 
supposedly ameliorative modifications made in 1982."
215,26," In Indiana Federation of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 106 S. Ct. 2009, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445 (1986) a group of dentists decided to stop 
supplying x-rays of their patients' mouths to the insurance company paying the bill. The Supreme Court held that this practice is 
an illegal horizontal agreement that withheld from dental customers a particular service the customers desired. ""Absent some 
countervailing procompetitive virtue -- such as, for example, the creation of efficiencies in the operation of a market or the 
provision of goods and services, such an agreement limiting consumer choice by impeding the 'ordinary give and take of the 
market place' cannot be sustained under the Rule of Reason."" 476 U.S. at 459, 106 S. Ct. at 2018 (citations omitted). 
Additionally, the Court reiterated that the FTC's absence of specific findings regarding market definition and market power does "
216,," not preclude, as a matter of law, a finding that the dentists unlawfully restrained trade.  Id. at 460, 106 S. Ct. at 2018-19. Instead, 
actual proof of detrimental effects, such as a reduction of output, can obviate the need for an inquiry into market power.  Id. at 
460-61, 106 S. Ct. at 2019."
216,27," Because they have shown anticompetitive effects, the plaintiffs would not have to establish a relevant market or that the 
defendants had market power."
216,28," Instead, the district court held ""it is as reasonable to assume that the price increase reflected [additional multistate] costs as it 
is to assume that the higher prices were merely to gouge the consumers."" Order, July 8, 1987 at 5. The trial court also held that 
the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the defendants' modified contractual arrangement had a ""present anticompetitive effect in 
a relevant geographic and product market."" Order, July 8, 1987, at 7 (emphasis added)."
216,29," Plaintiffs in a rule of reason case do not have to demonstrate a present anticompetitive effect in a specifically-defined product 
and geographic market if they can establish the existence of anticompetitive effects or purpose during the time period that the 
anticompetitive practices were allegedly in effect. These anticompetitive effects can be inferred from the price increases 
following the HBJ-BRG agreement (and the resulting reduction in the number of bar review courses sold), the licensing and 
revenue-sharing provisions, and the elimination of consumer choice through HBJ's withdrawal from the Georgia market. "
217,30," The district court concluded that ""under the circumstances, it is fair to conclude that the possibility of anticompetitive effect 
exists, but that such effect cannot be presumed from the contract itself."" Order, July 8, 1987, at 4."
217,31," An important factual issue is whether BRG's and HBJ's agreements are necessary for either's competitive survival. First, no 
evidence exists to explain why BRG had to use Bar/Bri's multistate materials much less have the exclusive right to the Bar/Bri 
tradename. Other sources of multistate materials existed. For instance, West Publishing's materials were still available albeit not 
free. Pelletier Deposition, at 73. Second, although HBJ would forego income by not selling its multistate materials to some other 
bar review course in Georgia, no legitimate reasons exist to explain why it was necessary for HBJ to form an agreement with its 
only rival in Georgia that contains blatantly anticompetitive licensing, revenue-sharing, and market allocation provisions. A 
plausible explanation is BRG's and HBJ's collective desire to profit by eliminating their rivalry and sharing the increased 
revenues that would result from BRG's new-found dominance in the Georgia market. "
218,32," A conspiracy to monopolize requires (1) proof of concerted action deliberately entered into with the specific intent to 
accomplish the unlawful result of achieving a monopoly; and (2) the commission of at least one overt act in furtherance of the 
conspiracy. Under a conspiracy theory, the defendants do not have to attain monopoly power nor would they have to obtain 
monopoly power if their conspiracy had been successful. L. Sullivan, Handbook on the Law of Antitrust, 132-34 (1977)."
218,33," Attempted monopolization is an offense distinct from monopolization which requires (1) a specific intent to monopolize and (2) 
a dangerous probability of success.  Lorain Journal Co. v. United States, 342 U.S. 143, 153, 72 S. Ct. 181, 186, 96 L. Ed. 162 
(1951). The most important evidence of defendants' specific intent to monopolize is anticompetitive conduct. A dangerous 
probability of success is measured by a defendant's possession of substantial market power."
218,34," The offense of monopoly under section 2 of the Sherman Act has two elements: (1) the possession of monopoly power in a 
relevant market and (2) the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or development as a 
consequence of superior product, business acumen, or historic accident.  United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 570-71, 
86 S. Ct. 1698, 1703-04, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778 (1966)."
218,35," Monopoly power is defined as the power to control price or exclude competition and is measured by reference to the relevant 
market. United States v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 351 U.S. 377, 391, 76 S. Ct. 994, 1005, 100 L. Ed. 1264. Market share 
is the traditional measure of market and monopoly power. United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 571, 86 S. Ct. 1698, 
1704, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778 (1966) (90% share of relevant market constitutes monopoly power, over 80% share a ""substantial 
monopoly""). The determination of the relevant product and geographic markets (and a defendant's market share), however, is 
not an exact science and mathematical precision may, at times, yield to administrative convenience."
218,36, The defendants submitted no evidence to rebut the plaintiffs' market structure analysis.
218,37, Kamerschen's deposition was the principal economic evidence upon which the first class action was based. 
219,38," ""The record discloses that BRG's course is marketed statewide, and is offered at various statewide locations both during the 
school year and following the close of the school year."" Order, January 1, 1987 at 12. The court however failed to consider 
whether Georgia is a relevant geographic market despite evidence suggesting such a conclusion."
219,39," The Supreme Court in United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 86 S. Ct. 1698, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778 (1966), stated that 
under Sherman section 2 ""there may be submarkets that are separate economic entities."""

228,5," A third company may also have begun to sell automatic fusion welders around this time, but there is no evidence that this 
company was active in the relevant market. "
230,6," Defendants make much in their submissions to this Court of certain newly discovered facts that they contend establish that 
Brastow practiced fraud before the Patent Office in obtaining his patent. Such facts, if true, would bring this action for damages 
within the ambit of the Walker-Process Type Case. Because, however, I specifically stated at page 10 of my opinion of January 
28, 1986, that ""in light of the evidence, the defendant has not sustained the burden of proving inequitable conduct . . ."" and 
because defendants failed to file a timely cross-appeal from this decision, this decision has become the ""law of the case"" and 
can be reopened only upon a clear showing of ""exceptional circumstances."" Robicheaux v. Radcliff Material Inc., 697 F.2d 662, 
668 (5th Cir. 1983) (""The rule is well established . . . that without the filing of a cross-appeal, an appellee 'may not attack the 
[district court] decree with a view either to enlarging his own rights thereunder or of lessening the rights of his adversary, whether 
what he seeks is to correct an error or to supplement the decree with respect to a matter not dealt with below.'"") See also United 
States v. Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, 222 Ct. Cl. 1, 612 F.2d 517, 519-22 (Ct. Cl. 1979); Gindes v. United States, 
740 F.2d 947, 949-50 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Having found that liability attaches on the basis of the facts as originally found in this 
case, I see no reason to reopen the settled question of whether plaintiff practiced fraud before the Patent Office. The only 
difference to defendants of allowing recovery under Walker rather than under Handgards would be in the method of computing 
damages. Under Walker, damages would be computed from the first day of misuse of the patent. Under Handgards, damages 
commence from the date of the institution of the litigation. However, defendants only seek damages for the litigation period, as 
provided for under Handgards. Thus this Court's finding of liability under Handgards provides defendants with all the relief they 
seek. "
234,7," The cited case and those that follow speak in terms of damages due to a Sherman Act plaintiff and arising from a defendant's 
unlawful acts. In applying the quoted materials to the case at bar, bear in mind that I am here awarding damages to defendants 
on their counterclaim. "
252,1," The Gibsons were named as plaintiffs in the original complaint, but on September 15, 1987, stipulated to a dismissal with 
prejudice of all their claims. They were not named in the first amended complaint. "
254,2," Plaintiffs refer to an eighteen page letter submitted to the court which outlines the theory of plaintiffs' claims. This is not 
plaintiffs' proposed amended complaint. The letter and its lengthy attachments focus on advocating the merits of home 
schooling, an issue not before the court. "
258,3," The injunctive relief granted in the case prevents the Michigan Board of Education from enforcing or utilizing the ""Non-Public 
School and Home School Compliance Procedures"" in any manner against any Michigan parent and declares same null and void. "
259,4," Under Count 1 of the complaint, plaintiffs fail to articulate that it is a claim brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. There is no 
direct cause of action under the fourteenth amendment and this court will treat this as being brought pursuant to § 1983. "
261,5," Clonlara states that it is a licensed school, but it has presented no evidence of licensing by the State. The Complaint speaks 
only in terms of being a state approved school. Nor is there any indication that the State has formally approved Clonlara. "
263,*," As discussed in the report at pp. 19-22, abstention is applicable to the damage claims with respect to the Bennetts and such 
claims should be stayed pending resolution of the related state case. From a case management standpoint, it is suggested that 
this be accomplished by an order of dismissal without prejudice and an order tolling the statute of limitations with respect to such 
claims, allowing plaintiffs to reactivate their claims by written notification to the court within 30 days of the resolution of the state 
court proceedings. "
269,6," The MPAAA has not initiated any legal action directly against Clonlara and there is no allegation that the policy making 
members of MPAAA have somehow controlled or directed truancy proceedings against the Kuhars."
269,7," Clearly, this statement is only relevant if offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Further, there is nothing in the record 
to show that this meets any exception to the hearsay rule such as admission by a party opponent which could be relied upon 
under F.R.E. 801(d)(2). "
270,8," It is doubtful that these allegations are sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss based upon lack of personal involvement, a 
prerequisite of liability under § 1983. Monell v. Department of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611, 98 S. Ct. 2018 
(1978). See discussion, infra, at X."
270,9," Even if the doctrine did not apply, this court would recommend dismissal of the claim against MASA for failure to adequately 
show state action. "

285,*," The Honorable Charles M. Metzner, United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation. "
286,1," The complaint alleges only an attempt, and not a conspiracy, to monopolize. Since the district court addressed the merits of 
both claims, we shall do so as well, treating the complaint as implicitly amended to add the conspiracy claim. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 
15(b)."
286,2," Siemens' first counterclaim alleged, inter alia, that Schein Dental falsely represented in its mail order catalog that Siemens' 
manufacturer's warranty applies to Siemens products purchased from Schein Dental. The district court entered a preliminary 
injunction prohibiting that representation, and the prohibition was continued by a subsequent stipulation and order. "
288,3," As to Siemens' first counterclaim, see supra note 2. "
290,4," Section one of the Sherman Act provides in pertinent part: HN6[
] Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce 
among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."

United State v. Colgate & Co., 250 U.S. 300, 63 L. Ed. 992, 39 S. Ct. 465 (1919). Sylvania determined that nonprice restrictions 
imposed upon distributors by agreements with manufacturers are to be judged under the rule of reason, rather than as per se 
illegal, for purposes of Sherman Act section one analysis.  433 U.S. at 57-59; see Borger v. Yamaha Int'l Corp., 625 F.2d 390, 
397 (2d Cir. 1980). The Court specifically noted the utility of such restrictions to curb ""free riding"" by discounters, the issue 
presented in Monsanto. See Sylvania, 433 U.S. at 55; Note, Antitrust: Business Electronics Corp. v. Sharp Electronics Corp. -- A 
Better Rule for Vertical Restraints, But Is It Legal?, 1987 B.Y.U.L.Rev. 1035, 1047-49. Colgate ruled that HN8[

291,," manufacturer has the right to deal, or refuse to deal, with whomever it likes, so long as it does so independently, and to 
announce in advance the circumstances under which it will refuse to sell.  250 U.S. at 307. "

New York Times Co., 876 F.2d 266, slip. op. at 3422 (2d Cir. 1989). "
293,7," Plaintiffs contend that Siemens (rather than dealers) was supposed to make these calls, and discriminatorily denied them to 
Schein Dental customers. "
294,8," Section two of the Sherman Act provides in pertinent part: HN19[
] Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize or combine or conspire with any other person or 
persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be 
deemed guilty of a felony. . . ."
294,15, U.S.C. § 2 (1982). 
297,9," As the district court observed, however: HN24[
] Any section 2 conspiracy to monopolize must be covered under the broader umbrella of a section 1 conspiracy in restraint of trade. The inverse, of course, would not necessarily follow. Professors Areeda and Turner have noted, ""The 
[section 2 conspiracy] prohibition is curious, because, given § 1, it seems entirely redundant."" 3 P. Areeda & D. Turner, 
Antitrust Law para. 839, at 358 (1978).  Hayden, 672 F. Supp. at 741 n. 21. It may accordingly be the case that the Monsanto-Matsushita rule extends to all section two 
conspiracies, but we need not reach that issue here."
297,10," Section two of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, provides in pertinent part: HN25[
] (a) It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, either directly or 
indirectly, to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality, where either or any 
of the purchases involved in such discrimination are in commerce, where such commodities are sold for use, consumption, 
or resale within the United States or any Territory thereof or the District of Columbia or any insular possession or other 
place under the jurisdiction of the United States, and where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen 
competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any 
person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them: 
Provided, That nothing herein contained shall prevent differentials which make only due allowance for differences in the 
cost of manufacture, sale, or delivery resulting from the differing methods or quantities in which such commodities are to 
such purchasers sold or delivered. . . ."
297,*," * * (c) It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, to pay or grant, or to receive 
or accept, anything of value as a commission, brokerage, or other compensation, or any allowance or discount in lieu 
thereof, except for services rendered in connection with the sale or purchase of goods, wares, or merchandise, either to the 
other party to such transaction or to an agent, representative, or other intermediary therein where such intermediary is 
acting in fact for or in behalf, or is subject to the direct or indirect control, of any party to such transaction other than the 
person by whom such compensation is so granted or paid."
297,*," * * (e) It shall be unlawful for any person to discriminate in favor of one purchaser against another purchaser or purchasers of 
a commodity bought for resale, with or without processing, by contracting to furnish or furnishing, or by contributing to the 
furnishing of, any services or facilities connected with the processing, handling, sale, or offering for sale of such commodity 
so purchased upon terms not accorded to all purchasers on proportionally equal terms. (f) It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, knowingly to induce or 
receive a discrimination in price which is prohibited by this section. "
298,15, U.S.C. § 13 (1982).
298,11," Section 4(a) of the Clayton Act provides in pertinent part: HN26[
] Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws 
may sue therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an 
agent, without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the 
cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee."
298,15, U.S.C. § 15(a) (1982) (emphasis added).
298,12," We note, however, that HN28[
] a violation of 15 U.S.C. § 13(a) (1982) requires not only proof of price discrimination, but a potential impact substantially to lessen competition or create a monopoly in any line of commerce. See B est Brands Beverage, 
Inc. v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., 842 F.2d 578, 586 n. 2 (2d Cir. 1987); Interstate Cigar Co. v. Sterling Drug, Inc., 655 F.2d 29, 31

300,13," Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act provides in pertinent part: HN32[
] Any person who shall affix, apply, or annex, or use in connection with any goods or services, or any container or 
containers for goods, a false designation of origin, or any false description or representation, including words or other 
symbols tending falsely to describe or represent the same, and shall cause such goods or services to enter into commerce, 
and any person who shall with knowledge of the falsity of such designation of origin or description or representation cause 
or procure the same to be transported or used in commerce or deliver the same to any carrier to be transported or used, 
shall be liable to a civil action by . . . any person who believes that he is or is likely to be damaged by the use of any such 
false description or representation."
300,15," U.S.C. § 1125(a). Section 43(a) has been amended by Pub.L. No. 100-667, Title I, §§ 132, 136, 102 Stat. 3946, 3948 
(1988), effective one year after Nov. 16, 1988. "
320,1," In one of the cases in which I believe Roppe cited in support of its position on this point, and my memory may be faulty, I 
believe it cited the case of Sustick v. Slatina, 48 N.J. Super. 134, 137 A.2d 54 (1957), in that case, if my memory is correct, the 
New Jersey court described the essence of the tort as being, as to whether the defendant played by the rules of the game. What 
I have found here is that applying Rule 56 standards on the record before me, in light of the contention made here by the "
321,," plaintiff, there is a genuine issue of material fact on this issue and the jury could reasonably find that the defendants did not play 
by the rules of the game. "
330,1," HN1[
] ORS 646.725 provides: ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce is declared to 
be illegal."" Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 USC § 1, provides, in part: ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the 
several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."" "
331,2," In 1973, Congress enacted HN2[
] the Health Maintenance Organization Act, 42 USC § 300(e), to facilitate the formation and operation of HMOs by making federal financial assistance available and preempting state laws that interferred with their 
operation.  Congress specifically authorized ""closed panel"" HMOs."
331,3," Plaintiffs concede that the HMO was formed in an effort to reduce premiums for prepaid health insurance and to compete with 
Kaiser."
331,4," In early 1986, in order to satisfy federal requirements, the owners of OPCN other than BCBSO, including Good Samaritan and 
Northwest Physicians Association, formed a new joint venture called Northwest Health, Inc.  Defendants concede that, if Good 
Samaritan and Northwest Physicians Association are enjoined from participating in a closed panel HMO, they would also be 
barred from participation in Northwest Health, Inc. "
332,5," The providers accept 80 percent of their normal fee as payment at the time of the service.  The remaining 20 percent is placed 
in the risk pool. If the providers are successful in controlling excess utilization, all or part of the risk pool is distributed to them at 
the end of the fiscal year.  If they are not successful, distribution is minimal or nonexistent.  Under the Administrative Services 
Agreement between OPCN and BCBSO, BCBSO provides ""stop loss"" coverage to OPCN, which is triggered when claims 
exceed an agreed percentage of collected premiums. For the segment of services that the stop loss covers, coverage is 
unlimited.  Losses that the stop loss does not cover become OPCN's operating deficit.  We find that, through their contribution of 
capital and participation in the risk pool, the providers were genuinely ""at risk."" "
333,6," There is no evidence concerning the percentage of the laboratory and radiology markets that the plan providers occupy.  
Although plaintiffs appeared initially to try to develop a record to support a theory of geographic restraint on trade, they did not 
follow through with it."
333,7," Plaintiffs suggest that, because we review this case de novo, we can ""reverse the trial court based on any legal theory which 
derives from the facts in the record."" We decline to consider arguments not raised on appeal. "
336,8," In his article entitled ""Hospital Joint Ventures: Charting a Safe Course Through a Sea of Antitrust Regulations,"" 13 American 
Journal of Law & Medicine, 621, 631, Jonathan M. Joseph discusses the antitrust ramifications of a health plan's decision to 
exclude certain providers from participation: ""A hospital sponsored [health plan] could be susceptible to charges of a group boycott in violation of Section 1 of the 
Sherman Act if it limits the number of providers in the plan and encourages patients to go only to those providers. Such 
exclusions should be analyzed under the rule of reason and not under the per se approach because it is unlikely that a 
single [health plan] could control the entire medical care market in a particular geographic region.  However, such 
exclusions probably should not be considered detrimental to trade as long as excluded physicians have the option of joining 
competing [health plans] or handling patients through other insurers or through Medicare or Medicaid.  In the extreme case 
where a [health plan] which is the primary health insurer in the market and is a joint venture of the only two hospitals in the 
market, excludes certain physicians, the court may probably take a per se approach. "
337,," ""* * * ""Courts analyzing charges of group boycotts in the health care industry tend to apply a rule of reason analysis instead of 
the per se approach.  To satisfy the rule of reason test, expulsion from or denial of membership to a [health plan] must be 
based on reasonable criteria, such as professional standards or operational efficiency rather than on a desire to close a 
market to a competitor. Under the rule of reason approach, a key element in a court's deliberation is a degree of market 
foreclosure which the denial or expulsion may cause a competitor. In the case of a [health plan,] the court's tendency to 
favor the rule of reason approach in group boycott cases may be influenced by the fact that group boycotts sometimes 
encourage competition by forcing other providers to operate competing [health plans] which will generally lead to lower 
health care prices."" (Footnotes omitted.) The suggestion in that discussion is that a health plan joint venture that remains small runs less risk of antitrust violations.  When 
the venture becomes large enough to constitute an important segment of the market, the exclusion of certain providers might 
have the effect of barring competitors from a market that is necessary for competition.  Many who have considered the question 
have determined that a limitation on the number of providers who participate in a health plan is pro-competitive, in that it 
encourages, rather than restrains, competition, so long as the health plan does not hold too great a share of the market.  Op

and the Maricopa Decision,"" 8 American Journal of Law & Medicine 223."
337,9," HN11[
] Where, as here, the determinination whether the arrangement is illegal per se turns in part on whether the defendant 
has closed the plaintiff off from a market necessary for effective competition and whether the defendant possesses market 
power, the discrete issue of anti-competitiveness is addressed in the per se analysis, effectively blurring the distinction between 
the per se analysis and the rule of reason. See Hassan v. Independent Practice Associates, P.C., supra."
337,10," Because we determine that there is no antitrust violation, we do not reach the question whether defendants' activities are 
exempt from ORS 646.725 under ORS 646.740(4). "
342,1," Claims under state law might be appropriate ""adversary proceedings"" in Mid-State's bankruptcy, but none of the parties 
mentions this possibility, so we let the matter drop. Likewise we bypass the fact that Mid-State's trustee in bankruptcy has not 
been named as the plaintiff. Counsel assured us at oral argument that the trustee has approved this litigation. "
348,1," There is a controversy in the reported cases as to what injury will satisfy the standing requirement for a violation under 28 
U.S.C. § 1962(a). The defendant in this case argues, and a number of reported cases in this area agree, that an injury ""by 
reason of a violation of section 1962(a)"" requires injury by investment in an enterprise, not simply an injury caused by the 
predicate racketeering acts. See Rose v. Bartle, 871 F.2d 331, 357-58 (3d Cir. 1989); Grider v. Texas Oil & Gas Corp., 868

Inc., 589 F. Supp. 1368, 1372 n. 1 (D.Mass. 1984). Contrary authority indicates that injury caused by predicate racketeering acts 
is sufficient for any type of section 1962 violation. See In re National Mortgage Equity Corp. Mortgage Pool Certificates Sec. 
Litig., 682 F. Supp. 1073, 1081-82 (C.D. Cal. 1987); Smith v. MCI Telecommunications Corp., 678 F. Supp. 823, 828-29 (D.Kan.

353,1," The enforceability of a forum selection clause in such context is a matter of federal law. See Stewart Organization, Inc. v. Ricoh 
Corp., 487 U.S. 22, 108 S. Ct. 2239, 2242-43, 101 L. Ed. 2d 22 (1988) (procedures with respect to venue are governed by 
federal law). In any event, New York law yields the same result as federal law. See, e.g., Alwinseal, Inc. v. Travelers Indemnity 
Co., 61 A.D.2d 803, 402 N.Y.S.2d 33 (2d Dep't 1978) (forum selection are enforceable)."
353,2," Although The Bremen dealt with an international forum selection clause in an admiralty action, ""its reasoning applies with much 
force to federal courts sitting in diversity. . . . Though state policies should be weighed in the balance, the authority and 
prerogative of the federal courts to determine the issue, as Congress has directed by § 1404(a), should be exercised so that a 
valid forum selection clause is given controlling weight in all but the most exceptional cases."" Stewart Organization, Inc. v. Ricoh 
Corp., 108 S. Ct. at 2250 (Kennedy, J., concurring)."
353,3," Plaintiffs' reliance on Red Bull Associates v. Best Western International, Inc., 862 F.2d 963 (2d Cir. 1988), is misplaced. In Red 
Bull, the court held that a forum selection clause should not be enforced where enforcement would contravene strong public "
354,," policy. Here, there is no public policy interest contravening the enforcement of the terms agreed by the parties as to where 
litigation will be heard. "
355,4," Explicit language creating exclusive federal jurisdictionn is illustrated in many federal statutes. See, e.g., Federal Tort Claims 
Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1346(b) (""the district courts . . . shall have exclusive jurisdictionn of civil actions""); Patent and Copyright Act, 28 
U.S.C. § 1338(a) (""such jurisdictionn shall be exclusive of the courts of the states""); Admiralty Jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1333 
(""the district courts shall have original jurisdictionn, exclusive of the courts of the States"")."
355,5," In an interview given 14 years after the passage of the statute, G. Robert Blakey, a consultant who had a major role in the 
drafting of the statute, apparently stated that ""no one even thought of the issue"" of concurrent jurisdictionn. Courts which have 
found exclusive jurisdictionn attached weight to Professor Blakey's further quoted comment that, ""Had anyone brought up the 
question of state court jurisdictionn we would have said no."" Flaherty, Two States Lay Claim to RICO - Interview with Robert 
Blakey, Nat'l L.J., May 7, 1984, at 10, col. 4; see Lou v. Belzberg, 834 F.2d at 736 n.4. To find an intent of Congress at odds with 
its utterance, based on a long subsequent speculation of a Congressional consultant, seems to be pushing the construction of 
legislative history far indeed."
355,6," The United States Supreme Court has held that the Clayton Act confers exclusive federal jurisdictionn. See Marrese v. 
American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 470 U.S. 373, 379-80, 386, 84 L. Ed. 2d 274, 105 S. Ct. 1327 (1985). "
357,7," The Supreme Court recently rejected an argument that RICO claims are ""too complex to be subject to arbitration."" Shearson 
American/Express, Inc. v. McMahon, 482 U.S. 220, 107 S. Ct. 2332, 2344, 96 L. Ed. 2d 185 (1987). The Court decided that 
there is no conflict between arbitration and RICO's purposes. Id. "
360,1," In its complaint filed on November 23, 1987, IRM seeks treble damages and injunctive relief under sections 4 and 16 of the 
Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 15 and 26, for defendants' violations of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1 and 2."
360,2," IRM has moved to strike (Docket No. 12) the affidavit of Douglass D. Gardner (Docket No. 5), pursuant to rule 56(e) on 
grounds including that it is not stated on personal knowledge and ""that it is replete with legal conclusions, ultimate facts, 
conclusions without factual bases and hearsay statements."" Docket No. 12 at 2. Thereafter, ANSAC filed a second Gardner 
affidavit (Docket No. 15) in attempt to cure the first affidavit from any defects under Rule 56(e). IRM replied to the attempts to 
cure the defects and renewed their objections, arguing that ""the Gardner affidavit is manifestly deficient under Rule 56."" Docket 
No. 17. Because the Court does not rely on any statements of Mr. Gardner that are not in conformity with Rule 56(e), IRM's 
motion will be denied as moot. "
362,3," For background and discussion of the scope of Webb-Pomerene exemption, see W.L. Fugate, The Antitrust Export Exemption: 
The Old Webb-Pomerene Act the New Export Trading Company Act, 15 Vand. J. Trans. L. 673 (1982) (section III considers 
judicial interpretation of Webb Act); 1 W.L. Fugate, Foreign Commerce and the Antitrust Laws §§ 7.1 -7.19 (3d ed. 1982 & Supp. 
1984 & Supp. 1986) (section 7.13 deals with export trade practices in general). "
363,4," As the Third Circuit explained in Horizons International v. Baldrige, 811 F.2d 154, 164 (3d Cir. 1987), ""the Senate Report notes 
that the section 303(a) [Title III of the Export Trading Company Act of 1982] standards for certification are to a large extent 'a 
codification of court interpretations of the Webb-Pomerene exemption to antitrust law.'"" 811 F.2d at 164 (quoting S.Rep. No. 27, 
97th Cong., 1st Sess. 10 (1981)). So, although similar Webb Act standards are helpful in interpreting provisions of the Export 
Trading Company Act of 1982 (""ETCA""), it is unclear to what extent interpretations of ETCA provisions aid interpretation of

the Secretary of Commerce, with the concurrence of the Attorney General, to promulgate regulations and issue guidelines. See 
15 U.S.C. § 4017(a) and § 4020. As noted by a prominent commentator, under the guidelines, ""while the definition of persons 
does not include foreign firms, U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies may apply for certificates [entitling holder to ETCA 
exemption], and foreign companies may be members of a U.S. entity applicant."" 1 W. L. Fulgate, Foreign Commerce and the

364,6," The Court credits ANSAC's argument that this claim is irrelevant: Plaintiff is not a buyer of soda ash; its claim is for injury caused by alleged fixing of rates paid for terminalling services, not 
for soda ash. Even if, after a long and complex trial, domestic soda ash price fixing were found to exist, it would not change 
the fact that the Webb-Pomerene exemption protects ANSAC's procurement of terminalling services in the course of 
exporting its goods overseas. Docket No. 21 at 4."

379,3," Ingraham, like most of our Eighth Amendment cases, involved the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, and it therefore is 
not directly controlling in this Excessive Fines Clause case. The insights into the meaning of the Eighth Amendment reached in 
Ingraham and similar cases, however, are highly instructive. We left open in Ingraham the possibility that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause might find application in some civil 
cases. See 430 U.S., at 669, n. 37. The examples we cited as possibilities -- persons confined in mental or juvenile institutions -- 
do not provide much support for petitioners' argument that the Excessive Fines Clause is applicable to a civil award of punitive 
damages. In any event, petitioners have not made any argument specifically based on the Cruel and Unusual Punishments 
Clause. LEdHN[3B][
] [3B]There is language in Carlson v. Landon, 342 U.S. 524, 546 (1952), suggesting that the Bail Clause may be implicated in civil deportation proceedings. The Court there held that ""the Eighth Amendment does not require that bail be 
allowed"" in such cases, but the opinion in that case never addressed the question whether the Eighth Amendment applied in civil 
cases: the Court held that the Bail Clause does not require Congress to provide for bail in any case, but prohibits only the 
imposition of excessive bail. Carlson provides petitioners with little support for another reason as well. Bail, by its very nature, is 
implicated only when there is a direct government restraint on personal liberty, be it in a criminal case or in a civil deportation 
proceeding. The potential for governmental abuse which the Bail Clause guards against is present in both instances, in a way 
that the abuses against which the Excessive Fines Clause protects are not present when a jury assesses punitive damages."
379,4," The same basic mode of inquiry should be applied in considering the scope of the Excessive Fines Clause as is proper in other 
Eighth Amendment contexts. We look to the origins of the Clause and the purposes which directed its Framers. ""The applicability 
of the Eighth Amendment always has turned on its original meaning, as demonstrated by its historical derivation."" Ingraham, 430 
U.S., at 670-671, n. 39. We emphasize, however, that this historical emphasis concerns the question of when the Eighth 
Amendment is to be applied; as the Court's jurisprudence under the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause indicates, its 
approach has not relied on history to the same extent when considering the scope of the Amendment. See Trop v. Dulles, 356 
U.S. 86, 101 (1958) (plurality opinion) (""The Amendment must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that 
mark the progress of a maturing society"")."
379,5," Delaware, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Virginia all had a 
Declaration of Rights or a Constitution expressly prohibiting excessive fines. See 1 B. Schwartz, The Bill of Rights: A "
380,," Documentary History 235 (Virginia), 272 (Pennsylvania), 278 (Delaware), 282 (Maryland), 287 (North Carolina), 300 (Georgia), 
343 (Massachusetts), and 379 (New Hampshire) (1971)."
380,6," A ""fine signifieth a percuniarie punishment for an offence, or a contempt committed against the king."" 1 E. Coke, Institutes 
*126b. The second edition of Cunningham's Law-Dictionary, published in 1771, defined ""fines for offences"" as ""amends, 
pecuniary punishment, or recompence for an offence committed against the King and his laws, or against the Lord of a manor."" 
2 T. Cunningham, A New and Complete Law-Dictionary (unpaginated). See also 1 T. Tomlins, Law-Dictionary 796-799 (1836) 
(same); 1 J. Bouvier, Law Dictionary 525 (4th ed. 1852) (same)."
380,7," Petitioners have come forward with no evidence, or argument, which convinces us that the word ""fine,"" as used in the late 18th 
century, would have encompassed private civil damages of any kind. Indeed, the term ""damages"" was also in use at the time the 
Eighth Amendment was drafted and ratified, and had a precise meaning limited to the civil context. Cunningham defined 
damages as follows: ""in the Common law it is a part of what the jurors are to inquire of, and bring in, when an action passeth for 
the plaintiff: . . . [Damages] comprehend a recompence for what the plaintiff or demandant hath suffered, by means of the wrong 
done to him by the defendant or tenant."" 1 Cunningham, supra; see also 1 Tomlins, at 498 (same); 1 Bouvier, at 360 (same). 
The dichotomy between fines and damages was clear. There have been cases which have used the word ""fine"" to refer to civil damages assessed by statute. As the partial dissent 
notes, two cases decided 70 years after the Excessive Fines Clause was adopted considered the term ""fines"" to include money, 
recovered in a civil suit, which was paid to government. See Hanscomb v. Russell, 77 Mass. 373, 375 (1858); Gosselink v. 
Campbell, 4 Iowa 296 (1856). These cases, however, provide no support for petitioners' argument that the Eighth Amendment is 
applicable in cases between private parties. As to the partial dissent's reliance on the Bard, post, at 290, we can only observe: Though Shakespeare, of course, Knew the Law of his time, He was foremost a poet, In search of a rhyme. "
381,8," For particular examples, see the 1683 Trial of Thomas Pilkington, and others, for a Riot, 9 State Tr. 187, and the 1684 Trial of 
Sir Samuel Barnardiston, 9 State Tr. 1333."
381,9," Justice Story was of the view that the Eighth Amendment was ""adopted as an admonition to all departments of the national 
government, to warn them against such violent proceedings as had taken place in England in the arbitrary reigns of some of the 
Stuarts."" 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States 624 (T. Cooley 4th ed. 1873)."
381,10," By 1689, the definition of ""fines"" and ""damages"" discussed in nn. 6 and 7, supra, already had taken hold. For a definition of

Flower ed. 1944). Defendants could be amerced as well. ""The justices did not hesitate to extract amercements from both parties 
when the occasion arose."" Id., at 466. For a wide variety of conduct for which amercements were assessed on parties, see

382,13," Without discussing the complex origins of civil damages in detail, see 2 Pollock & Maitland 522-525; 62 Selden Society, at 
473-479, we can say confidently that damages and amercements were not the same. In the time before Magna Carta, damages 
awards were rare, 2 Pollock & Maitland 523, the more usual relief being a fixed monetary payment or specific relief. But ""[t]he 
distinction between amercements and damages is well known. The former were payable to the crown after legal action or for an 
error or ineptitude which took place in its course; the latter represented the loss incurred by a litigant through an unlawful act. 
They were payable to [the private litigant]."" 62 Selden Society, at 463. The only overlap between the two might occur in the Assize of Novel Disseisin, in which the court could grant the recovery of 
land and chattels, and might amerce the defendant as well. Id., at 156; see generally 2 Pollock & Maitland 44-56, 523-524. But 
even in this action, the amerciable offense is one to the Crown, for every disseisin was a breach of the peace, as well as an 
improper possession of another's property. Id., at 44. Along these lines, see 62 Selden Society, at 478-479 (""In comparison with 
amercements, damages were seldom remitted, for the good reason that the king could do as he liked with his own but had to be 
careful not to show mercy at the expense of a wronged subject"")."
382,14," ""A Free-man shall not be amerced for a small fault, but after the manner of the fault; and for a great fault after the greatness 
thereof, saving to him his contenement; (2) and a Merchant likewise, saving to him his Merchandise; (3) and any other's villain 
than ours shall be likewise amerced, saving his wainage, if he falls into our mercy. (4) And none of the said amerciaments shall 
be assessed, but by the oath of honest and lawful men of the vicinage. (5) Earls and Barons shall not be amerced but by their 
Peers, and after the manner of their offence. (6) No man of the Church shall be amerced after the quantity of his spiritual 
Benefice, but after his Lay-tenement, and after the quantity of his offence."" Magna Charta, 9 Hen. III, ch. 14 (1225), 1 Stat. at 
Large 5 (1769), confirmed, 25 Edw. I, ch. 1 (1297), id., at 131-132."
382,15," See generally McKechnie 278; G. Smith, A Constitutional and Legal History of England 129, 131 (1955). Although most 
amercements were not large, see McKechnie 287; 2 Pollock & Maitland 513, being placed in the King's mercy meant, at least 
theoretically, that a man's estate was in the King's hands, and it was within the King's power to require its forfeit. See 62 Selden 
Society, at 463; McKechnie 71-72 (one called to the King's service who did not go was in mercy, and his estate was subject to "
383,," forfeiture). Amercements also resembled a form of taxation, particularly when used against entire townships. See Pleas for 
Gloucester xxxiv."
383,16," According to Pollock and Maitland, after the court found a person to be in the King's mercy, and that person obtained a pledge 
for the payment of whatever sum was to be amerced, the court would go on to other cases. At this point the person had not yet 
been amerced. ""At the end of the session some good and lawful men, the peers of the offender (two seem to be enough) were 
sworn to 'affeer' the amercements. They set upon each offender some fixed sum of money that he was to pay; this sum is his 
amercement."" 2 Pollock & Maitland 513; see also Pleas for Gloucester xxxiv. This procedure indicates that amercements were 
assessed by a ""jury"" different from that which considered the case."
383,17," See, e. g., Massey, The Excessive Fines Clause and Punitive Damages: Some Lessons from History, 40 Vand. L. Rev. 1233 
(1987); Note, The Constitutionality of Punitive Damages Under the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment, 85 Mich. 
L. Rev. 1699 (1987)."
383,18," So, for example, when the House of Lords placed certain limits on the types of cases in which exemplary damages could be 
awarded, Lord Devlin's extensive discussion mentioned neither Magna Carta or the Excessive Fines Clause of the 1689 Bill of 
Rights, nor did it suggest that English constitutional or common law placed any restrictions on the award of exemplary damages 
other than those discussed above. Rookes v. Barnard, [1964] A. C. 1129, 1221-1231. In fact, Lord Devlin recognized that his 
suggested alterations were a departure from the traditional common-law view. Id., at 1226. We find it significant that other 
countries that share an English common-law heritage have not followed the decision in Rookes, and continue to allow punitive or 
exemplary damages to be awarded without substantial interference. See, e. g., Uren v. John Fairfax & Sons, [1967] A. L. R. 25, "
384,27," (Australia) (declining to follow Rookes); Bahner v. Marwest Hotel Co., 6 D. L. R. 3d 322, 329 (1969) (Canada) (same); Fogg 
v. McKnight, [1968] N. Z. L. R. 330, 333 (New Zealand) (same)."
384,19," In Weems, Justice McKenna continued his writing for the Court: ""[Constitutions] are not ephemeral enactments, designed to 
meet passing occasions. They are, to use the words of Chief Justice Marshall, 'designed to approach immortality as nearly as 
human institutions can approach it.' The future is their care and provision for events of good and bad tendencies of which no 
prophecy can be made. In the application of a constitution, therefore, our contemplation cannot be only of what has been but of 
what may be. Under any other rule a constitution would indeed be as easy of application as it would be deficient in efficacy and 
power. Its general principles would have little value and be converted by precedent into impotent and lifeless formulas. Rights 
declared in words might be lost in reality."" 217 U.S., at 373."
384,20," Among the first cases to make explicit reference to exemplary damages was Huckle v. Money, 2 Wils. 205, 95 Eng. Rep. 768 
(K. B. 1763), where the court refused to set aside a jury award of # 300 where the plaintiff's injury would have been 
compensated by # 20. Upholding what it referred to as an award of ""exemplary damages,"" the court noted that ""the law has not 
laid down what shall be the measure of damages in actions of tort; the measure is vague and uncertain, depending on a vast 
variety of causes, facts, and circumstances,"" and declined to ""intermeddle"" in the damages determination. ""[I]t must be a glaring 
case indeed of outrageous damages in a tort, and which all mankind at first blush must think so, to induce a Court to grant a new 
trial for excessive damages."" Id., at 206-207, 95 Eng. Rep., at 768-769. Another case decided that year stated the applicable 
principle with particular clarity: ""Damages are designed not only as a satisfaction to the injured person, but likewise as 
punishment to the guilty, to deter from any such proceeding for the future and as a proof of the detestation of the jury to the 
action itself."" Wilkes v. Wood, Lofft 1, 18-19, 98 Eng. Rep. 489, 498-499 (K. B.). Other English cases followed a similar 
approach. See, e. g., Roe v. Hawkes, 1 Lev. 97, 83 Eng. Rep. 316 (K. B. 1663); Grey v. Grant, 2 Wils. 252, 253, 95 Eng. Rep. 
794, 795 (K. B. 1764); Benson v. Frederick, 3 Burr. 1846, 97 Eng. Rep. 1130 (K. B. 1766). "
385,21," In United States v. Halper, 490 U.S. 435 (1989), we held that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment places 
limits on the amounts the Federal Government may recover in a civil action, after the defendant already has been punished 
through the criminal process. While our opinion in Halper implies that punitive damages awarded to the Government in a civil 
action may raise Eighth Amendment concerns, that case is materially different from this one, because there the Government 
was exacting punishment in a civil action, whereas here the damages were awarded to a private party. We noted in Halper that 
nothing in our opinion ""precludes a private party from filing a civil suit seeking damages for conduct that previously was the 
subject of criminal prosecution and punishment. The protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause are not triggered by litigation 
between private parties."" Id., at 451 (emphasis added). We left open the question whether a qui tam action, in which a private 
party brings suit in the name of the United States and shares in any award of damages, would implicate the Double Jeopardy 
Clause.  Id., at 451, n. 11. We leave the same question open for purposes of the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause."
385,22," Because of the result we reach today, we need not answer several questions that otherwise might be necessarily antecedent 
to finding the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause applicable to an award of punitive damages, and that have not been 
briefed by the parties. We shall not decide whether the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on excessive fines applies to the several 
States through the Fourteenth Amendment, nor shall we decide whether the Eighth Amendment protects corporations as well as 
individuals."
385,23," Petitioners claim that the due process question is within the ""clear intendment"" of the objection it has made throughout these 
proceedings. Our review of the proceedings in the District Court and the Court of Appeals shows that petitioners' primary claim in 
both of those courts was that the punitive damages award violated Vermont state law. Petitioners also argued that the award 
violated the Eighth Amendment. We fail to see how the claim that the award violates due process is necessarily a part of these 
arguments. HN8[
] We shall not assume that a nonconstitutional argument also includes a constitutional one, and shall not stretch the specific claims made under the Eighth Amendment to cover those that might arise under the Due Process Clause as 
well. Although in particular cases we have applied the doctrine petitioners advance, see Braniff Airways, Inc. v. Nebraska Bd. of 
Equalization and Assessment, 347 U.S. 590, 598-599 (1954), this is not a case where a respondent is making arguments in 
support of a judgment. See Revere v. Massachusetts General Hospital, 463 U.S. 239, 244, n. 6 (1983); Dandridge v. Williams, 
397 U.S. 471, 475-476, n. 6 (1970). In the absence of a developed record on the issues relevant to this due process inquiry, we 
shall not stretch the ""clear intendment"" doctrine to include this case, as we do not think that the due process question is ""only an 
enlargement"" of the Eighth Amendment inquiry. Although the due process analysis of an award of punitive damages may track "
386,," closely the Eighth Amendment analysis suggested by petitioners, we shall not assume that to be the case and shall not attempt 
to decide the question in the absence of a record on the due process point developed in the District Court and the Court of 
Appeals."
386,24," The law of punitive damages in Vermont is typical of the law in most American jurisdictions. The doctrine has long standing. 
As far back as 1862, the Supreme Court of Vermont noted that the law on exemplary damages was ""long settled in this state."" 
Nye v. Merriam, 35 Vt. 438, 446. A Vermont jury may award punitive damages only if the evidence supports a finding that the 
defendant acted with malice, see, e. g., Appropriate Technology Corp. v. Palma, 146 Vt. 643, 647, 508 A. 2d 724, 726 (1986), or 
""malice or wantonness shown by the act,"" Rogers v. Bigelow, 90 Vt. 41, 49, 96 A. 417, 420 (1916). Punitive damages awards 
may be set aside if grossly and manifestly excessive. See Glidden v. Skinner, 142 Vt. 644, 648, 458 A. 2d 1142, 1145 (1983). 
The Vermont Supreme Court has declined to adopt a rule of proportionality between compensatory and punitive damages, 
Pezzano v. Bonneau, 133 Vt. 88, 92, 329 A. 2d 659, 661 (1974), but does not allow punitive damages to stand when an award 
of compensatory damages has been vacated, Allard v. Ford Motor Credit Co., 139 Vt. 162, 164, 422 A. 2d 940, 942 (1980). 
Once a plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence of malice, evidence of ""'the defendant's pecuniary ability may be considered in 
order to determine what would be a just punishment for him.'"" Lent v. Huntoon, 143 Vt. 539, 550, 470 A. 2d 1162, 1170 (1983), 
quoting Kidder v. Bacon, 74 Vt. 263, 274, 52 A. 322, 324 (1902). The $ 6 million in punitive damages in this case apparently is the largest such judgment in the history of Vermont; there have 
been other substantial jury awards, however, in the State. See, e. g., Coty v. Ramsey Associates, Inc., 149 Vt. 451, 546 A. 2d 
196 ($ 380,000 in punitive damages), cert. denied, 487 U.S. 1236 (1988). "
387,25," We have never held expressly that the Seventh Amendment allows appellate review of a district court's denial of a motion to 
set aside an award as excessive. Although we granted certiorari in two cases in order to consider the issue, in both instances we 
found it unnecessary to reach the question when we decided the case. See Neese v. Southern R. Co., 350 U.S. 77 (1955) (even 
assuming appellate review power under the Seventh Amendment, Court of Appeals was not justified in reversing denial of new 
trial on the particular facts of the case); Grunenthal v. Long Island R. Co., 393 U.S. 156, 158 (1968) (same). In light of the result 
we reach today, we follow the same course here."
387,26," This is particularly true because the federal courts operate under the strictures of the Seventh Amendment. As a result, we are 
reluctant to stray too far from traditional common-law standards, or to take steps which ultimately might interfere with the proper 
role of the jury. "
400,1, The Drury Inn began operations in June 1984.
400,2," Olive sold the remaining site in this development to Texian -- Colorado Springs, Ltd., which constructed and presently operates 
a Texian Inn Motel. "
402,3," In its response to Drury's motion for summary judgment, Olive stated that the parties did not contemplate that Olive would 
guarantee Super 8's room rates. Robert Drury stated he understood Olive would ""police the ingredients of the covenant."" (Ex. B)."
402,4," Because we are dealing with the sale of real property which involves different underlying legal relationships than those arising 
between a lessor and lessee, we are unpersuaded that the parties' citation of shopping center cases is entirely apposite. See, 
e.g., Harold Friedman Inc. v. Thorofare Markets Inc., 587 F.2d 127 (3d Cir. 1978); Child World, Inc. v. South Towne Centre, Ltd., 
634 F. Supp. 1121 (S.D.Ohio 1986); Optivision, Inc. v. Syracuse Shopping Center Assocs., 472 F. Supp. 665 (N.D.N.Y. 1979). 
The closer analogy is the covenant not to compete in employment contracts. For example, in Lektro-Vend Corp., 660 F.2d at 
269, the court found a covenant not to compete did not offend Section 1 because ""the main purpose of the transaction was 
legitimate, and the covenants were enforced reasonably with respect to time, geographic scope, and product."" "
407,1," Obviously, state agencies do not stand in the same political relationship to the state as municipalities do. At some point, a state 
agency becomes so closely related to the state that it is the state itself and entitled to pure Parker immunity. See, generally, "

case of state departments, for example. See Charley's Taxi Radio Dispatch Corp. v. SIDA of Hawaii, Inc., 810 F.2d 869 (9th Cir. 
1987). Although the Authority is ""within"" the State Department of Highways and its actions are subject to veto by the governor, it 
nonetheless has the qualities of an independent agency in, for example, its right to sue and be sued in its own name. Standard 
Parker immunity probably does not apply, therefore, and I will apply the Lafayette test, as modified by subsequent case law as 
discussed below. "
414,2," Although Monarch is, of course, permitted to plead in the alternative, the fact that it claims that but for the Authority's 
interference it would have built a $ 20 million alternative facility casts doubt on whether Monarch could ever show that it was 
impractical or unreasonable to duplicate the ""essential facility."""
414,3," In this particular situation, the somewhat discredited active state supervision requirement of the state-action doctrine has 
continuing viability. It ensures that the state is aware of agency actions and changing market conditions. "
416,4," Nor does the fact that the Authority is alleged to have lobbied the executive branch of state government mean that the Noerr 
doctrine is inapplicable. ""The executive process remains diverse, complex, and subject to multiple sources of information and a 
variety of influences and pressures from interested parties, legislators, and others. Dealing with the executive branch is, in 
general, as much a rough and tumble process as dealing with the legislature."" I Areeda & Turner, at para. 204 at pp. 47-48."
416,5," Monarch also requests, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f), that the court refuse the Authority's application for summary judgment 
in order that it may have additional time to conduct discovery. Since Monarch has failed to make any allegations that would 
create exceptions to the various immunity doctrines discussed throughout the opinion above, however, the discovery of 
additional facts cannot aid its case and this request is therefore denied. "
420,1," See Plaintiff's Deposition Exhibit No. 1, attached to November 20, 1986, Deposition of Ronald B. Livesay; Plaintiff's Exhibit No. 
1, attached to Deposition of Joseph Carey McHugh. ""Marketer"" is the term currently employed in the petroleum industry that 
reflects the merging of old-time distributors and retailers. A marketer generally performs a combination of some of the functions 
once performed exclusively by either a distributor or a retailer."
420,2," Pursuant to other agreements, including but not limited to Texaco S-175B agreements, plaintiff Southern distributes/markets 
other Texaco petroleum products. See November Sinkwich Deposition, p. 104."
420,3," Plaintiff relies in part upon an affidavit sworn to by Richard L. Shope and filed in a case brought in the United States District 
Court for the District of Maryland. Without ruling upon the relevancy, credibility or admissibility of that affidavit, this court notes 
that such affidavit has been read and that its references to bulk storage facilities stop far short of stating that defendant Texaco 
imposes upon its distributors a requirement to own such facilities. The court also notes that the affiant does not purport to have 
any knowledge regarding any comments made to or requirements imposed upon plaintiff Southern by defendant Texaco. See 
Rule 602 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. "
421,4," Self service gasoline stations were authorized for operation in Georgia by legislation enacted in 1971. See Georgia Laws 1971, 
pp. 683-684, §§ 1-3; O.C.G.A. § 36-60-1."
421,5," Mr. Viers is president and one of two equal shareholders in Vi-Mac, Inc., a gasoline distributorship business based in Stone 
Mountain, Georgia. He has been involved in the operation of this business since approximately 1967. See Viers Deposition, pp. 
7-17. Mr. Oglesby presently operates an Amoco gasoline distributorship in the Athens, Georgia area. He has been involved in 
the petroleum industry since 1961. See Oglesby Deposition, p. 9. Mr. Mattox has been employed by plaintiff Southern since 
1977. Since 1984, he has served as office manager of plaintiff Southern. See March Mattox Deposition, pp. 3-4. "
422,6," See November Sinkwich Deposition, pp. 204-205, where Mr. Sinkwich stated that he decided sometime in 1983 or 1984 to sell 
his business and that, based upon such decision, any major investments in convenience stores and self-service gasoline 
stations ""would have been kind of foolish."" The court notes that early in Mr. Sinkwich's career as a consignee for Texaco, he 
called upon Mr. Calvin T. Griffith, an officer of Golden Pantry Food Stores, Inc., in an unsuccessful effort to obtain a portion of 
that chain's business. See December Sinkwich Deposition, pp. 205, 233."
422,7," Mr. Griffith has been President and Chief Executive Officer of Golden Pantry since 1970. Golden Pantry is based in Athens, 
Georgia and it operates eighty-two convenience food stores in northeast Georgia and in the southwestern portions of North and 
South Carolina."
422,8," Golden Pantry owns one Texaco jobbership (marketer franchise). The franchise located in Aiken, South Carolina was 
purchased on April 29, 1985, as part of a larger transaction involving Golden Pantry's acquisition of twelve convenience stores 
under the name of Pump-N-Shop. At the insistence of the sellers, Golden Pantry was required to purchase the marketer 
franchise to acquire the stores. See Griffith-Golden Pantry Deposition, pp. 7-9; April 9, 1987, Deposition of Michael Griffith 
(""Griffith-Century Deposition""), pp. 34-35; Affidavit of Michael W. Griffith, attached to defendant Texaco's Motion for Summary 
Judgment."
422,9," Michael Griffith, though a stockholder of Century and one of its officers, is not involved in the daily operation of that concern. 
See Griffith-Century Deposition, p. 10. In addition to his ownership interest in Century, Michael Griffith is Vice-President of "
423,," Engineering of petroleum operations for Golden Pantry. Michael Griffith purchases gasoline from various distributors and re-
prices such gasoline for its resale at the eighty-two Golden Pantry stores. Id. at 4-5. "
424,10," ""Rack price"" is that price for which fuel is sold at the refiner's terminal. Griffith-Century Deposition, pp. 21-22."
424,11," In what is clearly an erroneous transcription, Michael Griffith's deposition reads as stated above. However, on pages 37-38 of 
his deposition, the matter is clarified. In a question, counsel for plaintiff states to Michael Griffith that ""you are going to pay them 
[Century] rack [price] plus a penny plus the common carrier freight."" In response, Michael Griffith answers ""the rack price plus 
freight and a penny. That's our deal."" The word ""in"" included in the text above should have read ""and."""
424,12," The statement included above was made by plaintiff's counsel, and it summed up the testimony of Calvin T. Griffith. Mr. Griffith 
responded ""that's correct"" to the statement made by plaintiff's counsel."
424,13," Plaintiff's pleadings make clear that Texaco's granting of a Texaco marketer franchise to Century which in turn makes Texaco 
gasoline available to the motoring public through Golden Pantry retail outlets is the conduct which allegedly affects competition. 
This focus upon intrabrand competition (Texaco v. Texaco) as opposed to interbrand competition (Texaco v. Gulf, Amoco or 
Exxon) is evidenced by Mr. Sinkwich's concern with credit card sales. See November Sinkwich Deposition, p. 167. Plaintiff 
contends that motorists intending to pay with Texaco credit cards drive several miles to Golden Pantry Texaco stores rather than 
purchase gasoline at Texaco outlets supplied by plaintiff Southern because gasoline can be purchased at a cheaper price at the 
Golden Pantry outlets. "
425,14," Mr. Sinkwich has stated that the Chase Street Texaco went out of business not due to competition from Golden Pantry but due 
to poor management. See December Sinkwich Deposition, p. 168."
425,15," Of course, this court is aware that Mr. Sinkwich is not an expert in economics. His statements regarding the effect upon 
competition are noted for the purposes of completeness rather than for their probative value. Dr. Kamershen has included in a 
report attached to his 1988 deposition an opinion of some of Southern's damages. Much of Dr. Kamershen's opinion focuses 
upon alleged price discrimination, an issue which this court has considered and rejected. See Southern Oil Co., Inc. v. Texaco 
Refining & Marketing, Inc., Civil Action No. 86-59-ATH (WDO) (unpublished opinion) (M.D., Ga. Dec. 23, 1987). Therein, the 
court granted defendant Texaco's motion for summary judgment on plaintiff's allegations of a violation of the Robinson-Patman 
Act. Thus, Dr. Kamershen's opinion has little relevance to the issues still present in this litigation. Furthermore, in that opinion, 
Dr. Kamershen has failed to establish any measure of damages to plaintiff Southern's business or to competition in general 
which has resulted from Century's receipt of a Texaco marketer franchise."
425,16, Neither party has deposed Mr. Upchurch.
425,17," Mr. Viers could not recall whether the quoted figure was Vi-Mac's offer or Southern's price. Id. at 99. Later in his deposition, 
however, Mr. Viers stated that Vi-Mac made the $ 735,000.00 offer to Mr. Sinkwich. Id. at 124."
425,18," Mr. Viers acknowledged in his deposition that the August 10, 1984, date noted on Defendant's Exhibit No. 3, the $ 735,000.00 
offer, contradicts to some degree some of his testimony. However, on page 132 of his testimony, he reiterated that the $ 
735,000.00 offer was Vi-Mac's initial offer; that is, the offer made prior to Mr. Viers' knowledge of a second marketer. For 
purposes of explanation, the court notes that the sale or transfer of a marketer franchise required Texaco's approval. "
426,19," Mr. Livesay explained in his deposition that Michael Bald related Texaco's willingness to approve the sale of plaintiff 
Southern's diesel fuel business to Mr. Livesay but was unwilling to approve at that time the sale of plaintiff Southern's gasoline 
business to Mr. Livesay. Id. at 99. Upon being so informed, Mr. Livesay determined not to pursue the purchase. Id. at 105. 
Michael Bald does not recall making such an offer to Mr. Livesay. See April Bald Deposition, pp. 29-33. Michael Bald recalls that 
Livesay's proposed purchase of plaintiff Southern collapsed due to problems with the credit information provided to Texaco by 
Mr. Livesay. Id. at 36-45. Mr. George O. Hawcroft, Jr., an employee of Texaco in the credit department, had informed Mr. Bald 
""that credit approval could not be given for the proposed transferee based upon the financial information provided . . . . This 
application for credit approval remained open pending the receipt of possible additional financial information concerning the 
proposed transferee, but such additional information was never received by the Credit Department."" Affidavit of George O. 
Hawcroft, Jr., pp. 1-2, attached to defendant Texaco's Motion for Summary Judgment. Mr. Sinkwich, to whom the request for 
additional credit information was made, never so advised Mr. Livesay. Livesay Deposition, p. 130. Mr. Livesay's credit has never 
been disapproved by Texaco. Id. at 129. "
429,20," The depositions of Frank Sinkwich and Michael Bald make clear that they had a disagreement about Southern's efforts to 
upgrade certain of Southern's clients. However, no evidence creates an inference that, because of this dispute, Texaco sought 
to eliminate either Southern or the stations in question. If Texaco did harbor such a desire, then it seems to this court that 
Texaco would have leaped at the opportunity to replace Mr. Sinkwich with Mr. Livesay with the hope that Mr. Livesay would have 
invested in upgrading those stations."
429,21," Plaintiff's counsel argued that this court's prior order denying defendant's motion for summary judgment precluded the court 
from reconsidering defendant's renewed motion to that effect. Thus, plaintiff's counsel filed his responses ""under protest."" The 
court notes that the development of this case illuminated many allegations that were initially ""vague"" and brought forth numerous "
430,," additional facts. As such, this court is certain that a consideration of defendant's renewed motion was proper. Additionally, the 
court notes that despite Mr. Potvin's ""protest,"" he has diligently pursued his client's interests in this matter. Plaintiff Southern has 
suffered no prejudice as a result of the court's decision to permit Texaco to renew its motion. "

437,7," The original complaint had been filed on March 16, 1983. On January 9, 1984, KCS moved to dismiss the original complaint for 
lack of standing. This motion was granted in part and denied in part on July 26, 1984. See infra note 18. Those plaintiffs who 
served in a capacity as parens patriae were dismissed. The district court, the Honorable Andrew W. Bogue presiding, held that: The State is not in the coal transportation business, and the Court sees no argument relating to harm to the State which 
would result from lack of competition in coal transportation. That claim belongs to ETSI. ETSI is not a party to this action. 
Therefore, the State's claim to anti-trust damages hinges on its demand for damages resulting from Defendants' alleged 
unlawful interference with the contract for sale of water. Janklow v. Kansas City Southern Indus., Inc., No. 83-5046, slip op. at 15 (D.S.D. July 26, 1984) (emphasis added)."
437,8, 15 U.S.C. § 1 (1982).
437,9," 15 U.S.C. § 2 (1982). South Dakota also asserted state antitrust violations of S.D. Codified Laws Ann. §§ 37-1-3.1 et seq. This 
claim, however, was not submitted to the jury."
437,10," In originally deciding these issues, the district court interpreted 15 U.S.C. § 22 (1982) to permit both personal jurisdiction and 
venue in this case. Janklow v. Kansas City Southern Indus., Inc., No. 83-5046, slip op. at 5 (D.S.D. Sept. 1, 1983) (Bogue, J.). 
Section 22 states: Any suit, action, or proceeding under the antitrust laws against a corporation may be brought not only in the judicial district 
whereof it is an inhabitant, but also in any district wherein it may be found or transacts business; and all process in such 
cases may be served in the district of which it is an inhabitant, or wherever it may be found. The district court stated that ""since Congress provided for nationwide service of process over both Defendants, it intended that 
the Court would have the authority to enforce a judgment over those same defendants. Accordingly, the Court holds that it does 
have personal jurisdiction over both Defendants."" Janklow, No. 83-5046, slip op. at 8. However, the application of section 22's 
""provision for extra-territorial service must in every case satisfy constitutional due process principles. Satisfaction of the requisite 
due process standards are [sic] tested by the familiar 'minimum contacts' analysis of International Shoe and its progeny."" 
Reynolds Metals Co. v. Columbia Gas Sys., Inc., 694 F. Supp. 1248, 1250 (E.D.Va. 1988) (original emphasis). The district court 
provided a detailed consideration of KCS' contacts with South Dakota in its determination of the venue issue. These contacts 
included the fact that KCS had injected itself, either directly or indirectly, into a number of state administrative proceedings, that 
at least three KCS employees are regularly dispatched to make sales calls in South Dakota, that as the result of its operation as 
a common carrier KCS received approximately $ 309,000 in revenue from shipments originating from or terminating in South 
Dakota in 1982, and that KCS has provided 28 of its locomotives to Burlington Northern for its regular use in South Dakota. 
Janklow, No. 83-5046, slip op. at 11-12. We believe that these contacts are sufficient to support the district court's finding of 
personal jurisdiction and venue in this case."
437,11," The Honorable John B. Jones, United States District Judge for the District of South Dakota. "
438,12," Blue Shield argued that McCready could not have standing by virtue of Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 
477, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701, 97 S. Ct. 690 (1977), because her injury ""'did not reflect the anticompetitive effect'"" of the alleged 
violation.  McCready, 457 U.S. at 482. The Court did not accept this interpretation: Brunswick is not so limiting. Indeed, as we made clear in a footnote to the relied-upon passage, a § 4 plaintiff need not 
""prove an actual lessening of competition in order to recover. Competitors may be able to prove antitrust injury before they 
actually are driven from the market and competition is thereby lessened.""  Id. (quoting Brunswick, 429 U.S. at 489 n. 14)."
438,13," The Court observed that: There is a similarity between the struggle of common-law judges to articulate a precise definition of the concept of 
""proximate cause,"" and the struggle of federal judges to articulate a precise test to determine whether a party injured by an 
antitrust violation may recover treble damages. It is common ground that the judicial remedy cannot encompass every 
conceivable harm that can be traced to alleged wrongdoing. In both situations the infinite variety of claims that may arise 
make it virtually impossible to announce a black-letter rule that will dictate the result of every case. Instead, previously 
decided cases identify factors that circumscribe and guide the exercise of judgment in deciding whether the law affords a 
remedy in specific circumstances.  Associated General, 459 U.S. at 535-37 (footnotes omitted). "
439,14," We, however, express the caveat that ""an allegation of improper motive * * * is not a panacea that will enable any complaint to 
withstand a motion to dismiss."" Associated General, 459 U.S. at 537 (footnotes omitted)."
439,15," These parties have in fact brought suit. Thus KCS' alleged anticompetitive activity has been attacked by market participants. 
ETSI and a number of the utilities have brought suit against the railroads in the United States District Court for the Eastern 
District of Texas. ETSI Pipeline Project v. Burlington Northern, Inc., No. B-84-979CA. KCS has since reached a settlement with 
the plaintiffs and has been released as a defendant in that case."
439,16," HN4[
] The antitrust laws ""were enacted for 'the protection of competition, not competitors.'"" Brunswick, 429 U.S. at 488 (quoting Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 320, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510, 82 S. Ct. 1502 (1962) (original emphasis)). This 
does not mean that the statute confines its protection solely to consumers, competitors, buyers, and sellers.  McCready, 457 
U.S. at 472 (quoting Mandeville Island Farms, Inc. v. American Crystal Sugar Co., 334 U.S. 219, 236, 92 L. Ed. 1328, 68 S. Ct. 
996 (1948)). See also Southaven Land Co. v. Malone & Hyde, Inc., 715 F.2d 1079, 1086 (6th Cir. 1983) (finding that plaintiff is 
not direct participant in relevant market not dispositive of section 4 standing issue). But see General Indus. Corp. v. The Hartz 
Mountain Corp., 810 F.2d 795, 809 (8th Cir. 1987) (citing Associated General, 459 U.S. at 539). Standing determinations must 
be made on a case by case basis.  Pocahontas Supreme Coal Co. v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., 828 F.2d 211, 219 (4th Cir. 1987); 
Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Comm'n v. National Football League, 791 F.2d 1356, 1363 (9th Cir. 1986); Crimpers 
Promotions, Inc. v. Home Box Office, Inc., 724 F.2d 290, 293 (2d Cir. 1983). Nevertheless, HN5[
] the fact that a party is not a 
participant in the relevant market must be weighed heavily against a grant of standing.  Lucas v. Bechtel Corp., 800 F.2d 839, 
844 (9th Cir. 1986). See also Feeney v. Chamberlain Mfg. Corp., 831 F.2d 93, 96 (5th Cir. 1987); Eagle v. Star-Kist Foods, Inc., 
812 F.2d 538, 540 (9th Cir. 1987). "
440,17," KCS and the State of South Dakota have engaged in extensive debates over whether SD was even a ""supplier,"" i.e., whether 
the State had any legal interest in the water it purported to sell or assign, or if the Corps of Engineers had exclusive authority to 
make such an assignment. See infra discussion at note 28. We decide the standing issue on the antitrust claim without reaching 
this issue. We simply assume for the purposes of our discussion on standing that SD did have Oahe water rights to assign to 
ETSI."
440,18," When this lawsuit was originally filed, motions were heard by the Honorable Andrew W. Bogue, then Chief Judge, United 
States District Court for the District of South Dakota. Judge Bogue found that state officials had no standing to bring a parens 
patriae suit on behalf of the citizens of South Dakota who had been deprived of a potential source of potable water from the 
proposed West River Aqueduct. Such an injury was deemed too remote from the alleged anticompetitive activities. Janklow v. 
Kansas City Southern Indus., Inc., No. 83-5046, slip op. at 14 (D.S.D. July 26, 1984). Thus, the sole injury alleged by SD was 
the loss of revenue that it would have received but for the cancellation of the SDCD/ETSI contract. Id. at 15. "
441,19," At trial Dr. John Beyer testified that SD was a participant in the coal transportation market in the same way in which the Atomic 
Energy Commission (AEC) had been a participant in the uranium market due to AEC's position as the sole source for uranium 
enrichment. In essence, this argument states that a supplier can be so unique and vital to production that its interests are the 
same as the interests of those competitors who are actually in the market. We do not believe that this model applies to this case. 
The enrichment of uranium necessarily involves a manufacturing process.  Huffman v. Western Nuclear, Inc., 486 U.S. 663, 108 
S. Ct. 2087, 2088 n. 2, 100 L. Ed. 2d 693 (1988). As our previous discussion illustrates, suppliers who are essentially 
manufacturers of a finished product are certainly more than mere suppliers. Coal slurry, on the other hand, simply describes a 
transportation process which in no way alters the natural composition of the material that is being transported. The supplier of 
the water may in no way be deemed to be the manufacturer of the coal in the way that the AEC was the manufacturer of 
enriched uranium. The supplier of the water is instead just one supplier of the many components involved in the proposed 
pipeline transportation of the coal."
441,20," Although ETSI's professed reasons for terminating the SDCD/ETSI contract related to the resources necessary to deal with 
the railroads' opposition, the record contains a number of different factors which hastened the end of the coal slurry pipeline 
project. These factors include the decline in the price of oil, the deregulation of the railroad industry, and the remaining federal, 
state, and local agency authorization that ETSI had yet to obtain. A significant hurdle which yet remained involved securing 
authorization for use of Oahe water from the Army Corps of Engineers. "
442,21," This finding alone is sufficient to bar standing because where there is no antitrust injury there can be no entitlement to 
damages.  Midwest Communications, Inc. v. Minnesota Twins, Inc., 779 F.2d 444, 450 (8th Cir. 1985). Moreover, this finding of 
course obviates the need to consider KCS' contention that SD's antitrust claim should have been dismissed because the statute 
of limitations had run."
442,22," Section 708 of the Flood Control Act states: Sale of surplus waters for domestic and industrial uses; disposition of moneys The Secretary of the Army is authorized to make contracts with States, municipalities, private concerns, or individuals, at 
such prices and on such terms as he may deem reasonable, for domestic and industrial uses for surplus water that may be 
available at any reservoir under the control of the Department of the Army: Provided, That no contracts for such water shall 
adversely affect then existing lawful uses of such water. All moneys received from such contracts shall be deposited in the 
Treasury of the United States as miscellaneous receipts."

] The Noerr-Pennington doctrine, which arose out of the United States Supreme Court's decisions in Eastern R.R. Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464, 81 S. Ct. 523 (1961), and United Mine 
Workers of Am. v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626, 85 S. Ct. 1585 (1965), exempts from the antitrust laws certain 
petitioning of courts and administrative agencies that results in anticompetitive effects.  California Motor Transp. Co. v. Trucking 
Unltd., 404 U.S. 508, 510, 92 S. Ct. 609, 30 L. Ed. 2d 642 (1972)."
443,24," This same doctrine has been applied to other areas of litigation. See, e.g., Bill Johnson's Restaurants, Inc. v. NLRB, 461 U.S. 
731, 76 L. Ed. 2d 277, 103 S. Ct. 2161 (1983) (unfair labor practices); Hufsmith v. Weaver, 817 F.2d 455 (8th Cir. 1987) 
(antitrust)."
443,25," Although National Organization for Women dealt with a political boycott, one of plaintiff's complaints alleged intentional 
infliction of harm without legal excuse.  620 F.2d at 1316. Moreover, the court cited the analysis in Sierra Club v. Butz, 349 F. 
Supp. 934 (N.D.Cal. 1972) for support of its position. Id. at 1317. Sierra Club was a nonantitrust case which applied Noerr-
Pennington to ""interference with advantageous relationship"" claims.  Sierra Club, 349 F. Supp. at 938. "
444,26," In Burlington Northern, the Fifth Circuit reviewed ETSI's claims that the railroads had committed sham petitioning and 
therefore were not entitled to first amendment protection. The court held: ""We believe that ETSI's claims, if found by the district 
court to be supported by prima facie evidence, are sufficient to deprive the railroads' defense of the window litigation of Noerr-
Pennington protection."" 822 F.2d at 532."
444,27," Indeed the trial court instructed the jury to this effect, to-wit, to consider only evidence in the tortious interference claim that 
occurred after KCS' knowledge of the contract.  However, the trial court's blanket instruction to the jury, although not excepted to 
in this regard, submitted the question of sham petitioning without attempting to distinguish between the alleged interference 
occurring before and after the date of the contract. The state urges that the evidence of sham petitioning before the contract was entered into should be considered relevant to the 
intent of KCS in the post-contract period.  Perhaps this was the reasoning behind the last paragraph in instruction 33 which did 
not attempt to distinguish between the pre-contract and post-contract period.  We do not ignore the state's argument concerning 
intent in this regard.  We rule, however, that the post-contract activity predominantly involved Andrews litigation and the 
opposition by the other states; as we discuss, infra, the railroad's interference or opposition was de minimus in the post-contract 
period and as a matter of law was not a direct cause to the cancellation of the contract."
444,28," Although we do not pass on this issue, it is clear that a condition precedent to future performance of the SDCD/ETSI contract 
required that ETSI obtain a contract with the Army Corps of Engineers to use the water in the Oahe dam. The statute, 33 U.S.C. 
§ 708, and the decisions in the Andrews litigation, make this condition clear. It is our impression that obtaining the contract from 
the Corps was a condition in fact for any future payment by ETSI to SD. The record, however, is silent as to whether the Corps' 
approval was obtainable. In the absence of such proof we think it clear that plaintiff's alleged damages are entirely speculative and not supported by 
substantial evidence. Dr. Ralph J. Brown, the economic expert retained by South Dakota to testify regarding damages, 
altogether ignored the possibility that ETSI could have invoked the cancellation rights (as it eventually did) in any of a number of 
situations. Dr. Brown instead treated the SDCD/ETSI contract as if it were a promissory note. He assumed that construction of 
the pipeline would commence on April 1, 1986, and be completed by June 1, 1988. From the date of the actual cancellation of 
the contract to Brown's projected date for the pipeline completion, he testified that SDCD would receive payments totaling $ "
445,24," ,100,000. Brown further testified that SDCD would subsequently receive $ 9,000,000 annually for the next fifty years. Brown 
added these annual payments to the future sales tax payments that would have accompanied maintenance of the West River 
Aqueduct, adjusted the entire sum for three percent inflation, and reached a present value amount of $ 210,900,000. The most important consideration relating to the determination of damages in this case is the fact that the SDCD/ETSI contract 
was terminable at ETSI's will if certain events should occur. Restatement (Second) of Torts § 766 comment g (""The fact that the 
contract is terminable at will * * * is to be taken into account in determining the damages that the plaintiff has suffered by reason 
of its breach.""). First, should the pipeline project be abandoned, ETSI could terminate the contract on thirty days notice. Even if 
ETSI were able to attain the Corps' permission to use Oahe water, the project still faced a number of obstacles in each of the 
seven states through which the pipeline was to pass. Perhaps ETSI had secured the necessary rights-of-way to avoid further 
window litigation with the railroads. Nonetheless in each of these states ETSI would have to respond to concerns that include the 
pipeline's impact on the environment, compliance with safety regulations, effect on the local work force, and proper zoning of the 
land through which the pipeline would pass. Success in these matters would require cooperation on the part of each state just as 
obtaining a water source required a great deal of cooperation from South Dakota authorities. In addition, succeeding 
occurrences in the economy such as the decline of inflation and a severe decrease in oil prices certainly made the coal slurry 
pipeline project a much less lucrative investment. Moreover, the economic experts at trial testified that the deregulation of the 
transportation industry virtually assured a market situation in which the railroads could transport coal at lower rates than a coal 
slurry pipeline. Furthermore, we find it entirely speculative that construction of the pipeline would commence by the middle or even late 1980's. 
In fact, KCS presented unrefuted testimony by its economic experts that the drastic economic changes and the deregulation of 
the railroad industry which occurred in the early 1980's made a coal slurry pipeline project infeasible. The record also reflects that, following the district court's decision to enjoin the BOR/ETSI contract, ETSI found it necessary to 
exercise its right to cancel the SDCD/ETSI contract because SD refused to postpone the payment of fees under the contract. 
We find that under the circumstances reflected by the record, the only factor that could have prolonged the existence of the 
contract would have been a decision on SD's part to postpone the payment by ETSI of fees owed under the SDCD/ETSI 
contract. We therefore find that the jury's award of damages is in no way supported by substantial evidence in the record."
445,29," This is not true here because the district court certified the question of KCS standing under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) as an issue 
where reasonable minds might differ. We find that KCS had a reasonable basis in law and fact in asserting standing in the 
Andrews litigation. "
446,30," This is not to say that successful litigation shall categorically preclude a finding of sham. The Honorable Richard A. Posner, 
Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, has aptly described a number of circumstances 
where a lawsuit may have a reasonable basis and yet be undeserving of first amendment protection: Many claims not wholly groundless would never be sued on for their own sake; the stakes, discounted by the probability of 
winning, would be too low to repay the investment in litigation. Suppose a monopolist brought a tort action against its single, 
tiny competitor; the action had a colorable basis in law; but in fact the monopolist would never have brought the suit -- its 
chances of winning, or the damages it could hope to get if it did win, were too small compared to what it would have to 
spend on the litigation -- except that it wanted to use pretrial discovery to discover its competitor's trade secrets; or hoped 
that the competitor would be required to make public disclosure of its potential liability in the suit and that this disclosure 
would increase the interest rate that the competitor had to pay for bank financing; or just wanted to impose heavy legal 
costs on the competitor in the hope of deterring entry by other firms. In these examples the plaintiff wants to hurt a 
competitor not by getting a judgment against him, which would be a proper objective, but just by the maintenance of the 
suit, regardless of its outcome.  Grip-Pak, Inc. v. Illinois Tool Works, Inc., 694 F.2d 466, 472 (7th Cir. 1982) (citations omitted). See also Westmac, Inc. v. Smith, 
797 F.2d 313, 315-18 (6th Cir. 1986); Sunergy Communities, Inc. v. Aristek Properties, Ltd., 535 F. Supp. 1327, 1331 (D.Colo.

Pennington Doctrine, 17 U.C. Davis L.Rev. 549, 576 & n.113 (1984). The instant case, however, can be distinguished from the 
circumstances described by Judge Posner in that the Andrews litigation went far beyond the pretrial stage. Moreover, there 
really is no dispute that, regardless of its motive, KCS genuinely sought judicial relief. "
453,1," Collateral Protection Insurance insures not only a bank, but also the bank's borrower against the risk of physical damage to 
collateral -- usually an automobile -- securing a bank loan, up to the amount of the borrower's outstanding loan balance. 
Participating bank's loans are matched against proof of the existence of automobile physical damage insurance supplied by 
borrowers. Computer tracking systems are used for this purpose.  Borrowers lacking insurance are notified that Collateral "

454,2," Residual Value Insurance is marketed in connection with balloon car loans. In a closed-end balloon loan, utilizing residual value 
insurance, the borrower can pay part of the loan principal in his monthly payments and satisfy the remainder (the ""balloon 
payment"") by returning the car to the lender at the end of the loan term, instead of making the balloon payments.  RVI insures 
the lender against the risk of excess depreciation of used car prices, which will cause the value of the automobile at the end of 
the loan period to be less than the balloon payment. "

] When the nonmoving party bears the burden of proof at trial, the moving party is not required to support its motion by 
producing evidence showing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. It is enough for the nonmoving party to point out 
that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case.  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 106 S. Ct.

456,4," The analysis of plaintiff's claims under Minnesota Antitrust Law is identical to the analysis of plaintiff's claims under the 
Sherman Act. The Minnesota Supreme Court has consistently held that the Minnesota Antitrust Law should be construed consistently 
with the federal courts' construction of the federal antitrust laws. See State v. Duluth Board of Trade, 107 Minn. 506, 517, 
121 N.W. 395, 399 (1909) (""the general purpose of all statutes of this kind is the same, and we may therefore properly look 
to the decisions made under federal and state statutes of a similar character for the principle by which to construe our own 
statute""). See also Christgau v. Woodlawn Cemetery Association, 208 Minn. 263, 276, 293 N.W. 619, 625 (1940) (""it would 
be anomalous to have the state and federal courts applying different rules to the same facts under identical provisions of 
law""); Campbell v. Motion Picture Machine Operators' Union, Local 219, 151 Minn. 220, 228-29, 186 N.W. 781, 783 (1922) 
(reiterating the Duluth Board of Trade rationale). Keating v. Philip Morris, Inc., 417 N.W.2d 132, 136 (Minn.App. 1987). Thus, the disposition of plaintiff's claim under Minnesota 
law will be the same as the disposition of plaintiffs' claims under the Sherman Act. "
458,5," The facts in Ryko are similar to those of the present case. There, plaintiff argued that exclusive territorial provisions in Ryko's 
distributorship contracts violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Plaintiff argued that the exclusive territorial provisions should be 
stricken as per se illegal horizontal agreements between competing distributors, because Ryko acted as its own distributor in 
territories where it had no other. The Eighth Circuit summarily rejected this argument, hold that ""the better-reasoned cases 
examine nonprice restraints in the dual distribution context under the rule of reason."" Id. "
461,6," King Agency's primary evidence concerning damages is contained in the November 1, 1987 affidavit of Andrew Whitman, one 
of plaintiff's experts.  Whitman calculated King Agency's lost commissions for potential sales of CPI at $ 350,584 for the period 
1982-1986. There is no breakdown of commissions lost yearly. Whitman made a similar calculation for lost commissions on the 
sale of RVI for the period 1984-1988 and concluded it was $ 283,875. There is no yearly breakdown of lost commissions for RVI. "
462,," Further, Whitman's calculations are based on an assumption that King Agency would have a 25 percent market share. Based 
upon the uncontradicted evidence that King Agency was unable to obtain more than a handful of sales from numerous contacts, 
the Court finds that Whitman's calculated damages are wholly speculative. "
464,7," Restatement (Second) of Torts § 769 (1977) provides: One who, having a financial interest in the business of a third person intentionally causes that person not to enter into a 
prospective contractual relation with another, does not interfere improperly with the other's relation if he (a) does not employ wrongful means and (b) acts to protect his interest from being prejudiced by the relation. By its terms, however, § 769 applies only to prospective contractual relations. Comment b to § 769 confirms that § 769 ""does not 
apply to the causing of a breach of contract,"" but further states that ""this does not imply, however, that the actor's interference is 
necessarily improper in such a case under the general principle stated in § 767."" Despite the explicit language in Comment b, 
several courts have relied upon § 769 to support their conclusion that a parent corporation may be privileged to interfere with its 
wholly-owned subsidiary's contracts. See e.g., Phil Crowley Steel Corp., 702 F.2d at 722; Geib v. Alan Wood Steel Co., 419 F. 
Supp. 1205, 1209 (E.D.Pa. 1976) (The privilege under § 769 is available to a defendant when the contract at issue is terminable 
at-will, since termination of an at-will contract does not constitute a breach of that contract). Other courts, however, have heeded 
the explicit language of Comment b and have held that, under a balancing of the factors listed in § 767, the privilege still is 
available. See e.g., Bendix, 610 P.2d at 30-31. Restatement (Second) of Torts § 767 (1977) provides: In determining whether an actor's conduct in intentionally interfering with a contract or a prospective contractual relation of 
another is improper or not, consideration is given to the following factors: (a) the nature of the actor's conduct (b) the actor's motive (c) the interests of the other with which the actor's conduct interferes (d) the interests sought to be advanced by the actor (e) the social interests in protecting the freedom of action of the actor and the contractual interests of the other (f) the proximity of remoteness of the actor's conduct to the interference and (g) the relations between the parties. Generally, each of these factors must be balanced in each case, unless judicial decisions indicate the existence of a more or 
less crystallized rule or privilege. Restatement (Second) of Torts § 767 comment j (1977). "

808, 108 S. Ct. 1515 (1988), is pertinent only to the extent that the applicable conspiracy standards may differ. Although both 
parties advance arguments concerning the sufficiency of the evidence that this is a price-fixing case (per se) or, if not, that trade 
was unreasonably restrained (rule of reason), such questions are not directly in issue. In view of our disposition of the question 
of the conspiracy standards, we need not address these arguments. "
472,4," We are aware that the Eighth Circuit has held that evidence that, following termination of a discounter after a dealer 
complained, a manufacturer reported to the dealer that ""the problem had been taken care of,"" coupled with the discounter's 
testimony that ""the only reason [a manufacturer's employee] could figure out that they were terminating me is to give [the dealer] 
some relief,"" sufficiently tended to exclude the possibility that the manufacturer and dealer were acting independently. McCabe's 
Furniture v. La-Z-Boy Chair Co., 798 F.2d 323, 328 (8th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1005, 108 S. Ct. 1728, 100 L. Ed. 2d 
193 (1988). Similarly, the Eleventh Circuit has stated that evidence that, following a complaint about a discounter, a 
manufacturer notified the complaining dealer that ""corrective action has been taken"" and requested that the dealer notify it of any 
further problems, when coupled with the dealers' ""thank you"" that created an inference that the dealer agreed to notify the 
manufacturer, met Monsanto's requirements ""precisely."" Helicopter Support Systems v. Hughes Helicopter, Inc., 818 F.2d 1530, 
1535-36 & n. 6 (11th Cir. 1987). In our view, however, those decisions have in effect misconstrued ""tends to exclude the possibility"" of independent conduct, 
Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 588, to mean something like ""arguably consistent with the possibility of a conspiracy."" "
473,5," Parkway and Rose also allege that Pennsylvania House violated the Sherman Act by inducing their participation as unwilling 
co-conspirators and by engaging in a horizontal conspiracy with other manufacturers. To prevail on the former theory, Parkway 
and Rose must show ""acquiescence in . . . firmly enforced restraints . . . induced by the communicated danger of termination."" 
Perma Life Mufflers v. International Parts Corp., 392 U.S. 134, 142, 20 L. Ed. 2d 982, 88 S. Ct. 1981 (1968) (quotation marks

2d 628, 104 S. Ct. 2731 (1984). Parkway and Rose have shown only that they complied with the policy for two weeks until it was 
suspended as to them per an agreed order. As with the section 1 conspiracy theory, ""something more"" is required, and here, 
too, Parkway and Rose failed to provide it. With respect to the horizontal conspiracy argument, Parkway and Rose have shown 
only that Pennsylvania House was aware that other manufacturers had similar policies and was aware of their terms. Parkway 
and Rose, however, have failed to demonstrate a conspiracy among the manufacturers to implement the policies. "
479,1," Allegedly, the new dealer was required to take three tractors the first year, six tractors the second year, and nine tractors the

480,3," Smith's assertion of stare decisis in the preclusion context is misplaced since that doctrine goes to the precedential value of a 
prior determination, and not to the narrow inquiry of whether a party is precluded from relitigating an issue. Cf.  Stevenson v. 
Sears, Roebuck & Co., 713 F.2d 705, 711, 218 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 969 (Fed. Cir. 1983). "
482,4," On appeal, Smith does point to deposition testimony in the record by a Hesston vice-president who admitted testifying in an 
unrelated trial that he was sure some dealers took on Hesston tractors under threat of termination, although he had no personal 
knowledge of such an occurrence. The vice-president also had admitted that Hesston had a policy of terminating dealers that 
refused to stock the tractors if a replacement dealer in the area could be found."
482,5," In this particular case, the alleged line forcing might better be termed a vertical ""arrangement"" rather than ""restraint"" since 
Smith was not prohibited from carrying the product lines of competitors as it would be under an exclusive dealing arrangement, 
the classic ""vertical restraint."" Smith was ""restrained,"" however, in the sense that it was obligated to carry a representative line of 
Hesston products and it could not refuse to do so without violating the terms of the distributorship contract. A ""horizontal 
restraint,"" on the other hand, represents ""an agreement among competitors on the way in which they will compete with one 
another"" and is often held to be unreasonable as a matter of law.  NCAA v. Board of Regents, 468 U.S. 85, 99, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70,

507,1," Weider attempts to discredit Overstreet's analysis by pointing out that Overstreet has assumed that advertising expenditures 
have a positive effect on sales and revenues. Weider notes, without record citation, that Twinlab's advertising expenditures have 
fallen during a period of explosive sales growth. Weider concludes that Overstreet's hypothesis is counterfactual, and that his 
damage calculations accordingly are worthless. Weider's analysis would be correct if Overstreet had assumed that advertising expenditures were the only variable affecting 
revenues or profits. However, Weider does not assert that that is what Overstreet has done. Although Overstreet's methodology 
is far from clear, when all reasonable doubts are resolved in Twinlab's favor, it seems to take into account more than just 
advertising expenditures. Therefore, it would be possible for revenues and profits to increase when advertising expenditures 
were decreasing, as long as other determinants of revenues and profits more than made up for the loss in revenue and profit 
occasioned by a failure to advertise. "
508,2," Weider does not challenge the implicit premise in Twinlab's argument that bodybuilding supplements must be advertised in 
magazines. If bodybuilding supplements could be promoted effectively in other ways, for example, through radio, cable 
television, point-of-sale displays, advertising in bodybuilding facilities, or sponsorship of bodybuilding competitions and 
competitors, then the importance of Muscle & Fitness, and Flex advertising conceivably would be much lower than the 66% 
market share might suggest. Similarly, Weider does not challenge the implicit assumption that every bodybuilder who buys bodybuilding magazines buys only 
one title. See Appendix to Defendants' Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment 
(Defendants' Appendix) Exhibit 42 (survey that asks what magazines, in addition to Muscle & Fitness, the respondent subscribes 
to). That is, Weider does not challenge that circulation statistics may not indicate Weider's ability to reach customers that no 
other magazine could reach. If that assumption were not made, the number of persons who rely exclusively on Muscle & Fitness 
or Flex might rise or fall. As an extreme example, if every bodybuilder bought both Weider titles and one other bodybuilding 
magazine, then Weider might have exclusive access to very few bodybuilders. As an antipodal example, if every bodybuilder 
who bought Weider magazines bought only Weider magazines, and bought only one title, and if every bodybuilder who bought 
non-Weider magazines bought six or seven different titles, then Weider would have a very large segment of the market to itself, "
509,3," With the dismissal of Twinlab's antitrust claims, there is no occasion to consider Weider's argument that Twinlab has not 
suffered antitrust injury warranting monetary or injunctive relief.  J. Truett Payne Co. v. Chrysler Motors Corp., 451 U.S. 557, 562 
(1981); Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 489 (1977); 15 U.S.C. §§ 15, 26 (1982). "
510,4," Weider also seeks dismissal of Twinlab's prima facie tort claim, alleging that Twinlab has not even pleaded special damages, 
an essential element of the tort. E.g., Curiano v. Suozzi, 63 N.Y.2d 113, 117, 469 N.E.2d 1324, 1327, 480 N.Y.S.2d 466, 469 
(1984). Twinlab concedes this defect, but seeks to amend its complaint to allege special damages. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a). In 
essence, Weider opposes the motion to amend asserting that no such damages have been proven, and Twinlab contests this 
characterization by bringing forward what it claims to be evidence of special damages. Therefore, as a practical matter, this is a 
motion for summary judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b). However, in order to remedy the pleading deficiency, Twinlab will be 
permitted to amend its complaint to allege whatever special damages are supported by the evidence.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)."
510,5," There is no other basis for finding that special damages have been proved. Twinlab executives assert that they cannot quantify 
the damages suffered as a result of Weider's conduct. E.g., Appendix to Plaintiff's Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants' 
Motion for Summary Judgment (Plaintiff's Appendix) Exhibit 10 (2 David Blechman Deposition) at 60; Exhibit 8 (2 Neil Blechman 
Deposition) at 386, 441; Defendants' Appendix Exhibit 7 (Dean Blechman Deposition) at 53-54, 288; Exhibit 8 (Brian Blechman 
Deposition) at 171; Exhibit 10 (Steve Blechman Deposition' at 191. This inability to calculate damage also reaches concrete and 
specific conduct such as inhibiting the publicity for a new Twinlab product. 2 Neil Blechman Deposition at 403, 405, 409-12. 
Outsiders have very little to add to the discussion of damages. Plaintiff's Appendix Exhibit 15 (Steven Mark Falk Deposition) at 
103-04; Exhibit 25 (Michael Triunfo Deposition) at 155. However, contrary to Weider's assertion, no Twinlab witness explicitly rules out the possibility that the firm has been harmed 
immediately. Instead, most simply do not know the amount or timing of the damage. In fact, one Twinlab executive explicitly 
defers to the determination of Twinlab's expert economist, Dr. Thomas R. Overstreet, Jr. 2 David Blechman Deposition at 61. "

517,2," The plaintiff alleges that a long term contract existed between it and IFB, which was breached by IFB. For the reasons 
discussed in section II.B., the court finds that no long term contract existed. Therefore, no discussion of its terms or alleged 
breach is necessary to the resolution of the defendants' motion. "
521,3," The parties disagree about Huelson's motivation for travelling to Indianapolis. The defendants argue that Huelson voluntarily 
went to Indianapolis, without prodding by Anania. They point to Huelson's deposition testimony, in which he states that no one 
demanded that he go to Indianapolis. See Huelson Deposition at 83-85. On the other hand, the plaintiff maintains that Huelson 
felt that he had to go to Indianapolis to prevent a supply shut-off because Anania apparently conditioned his decision about 
providing gasoline to Bi-Rite on Huelson's ability to prove that Bi-Rite was not driving the market down."
521,4," Bi-Rite also points out that IFB sold Bi-Rite misblended gasoline, which caused Bi-Rite to sustain substantial adverse tax 
consequences. IFB readily admits that it sold the misblended gasoline to Bi-Rite; however, it also states that IFB immediately 
offered to reimburse Bi-Rite for incurred expenses, which Bi-Rite refused. Thus, the defendants argue and the court agrees that 
this incident does not appear to be relevant to the plaintiff's antitrust claims. "
530,1, Cinamerica owns only one screen in New York City. 
531,2," Under the HHI, which is calculated by adding the squares of the individual market shares of all the firms in an industry, values 
of 1000 and 1800 are considered by the Justice Department to reflect moderate and high concentration, respectively. These 
numbers roughly correspond to the fifty percent and seventy percent concentration level benchmarks in the traditional ""four-firm 
concentration"" test, in which the shares of the four largest firms are simply added, the seventy percent mark indicating that the 
four largest firms in the relevant market control seventy percent of that market."
531,3," There were two responses to the notice inviting comment. The National Association of Theatre Owners sent a letter saying that 
the acquisition may create ""a potential for discrimination"" but saw no reason to expect that any would actually result; it took no 
position on the acquisition. In addition, Paul Klieman, a theatre owner in Philadelphia, a market where Cinamerica has no 
theatres, accused Warner of violating the decrees and opposed the acquisition. Judge Palmieri's opinion makes no mention of 
these responses. "

548,1," The claims against defendant, Hunt-Wesson Foods, Inc., have been settled. "
550,2," Defendant contends that Juniata lacks standing to assert a Robinson-Patman claim since it never purchased products directly 
from Serv. Rather, Feeser made the purchases and resold the products to Juniata. The Third Circuit has required a plaintiff to be 
a direct purchaser to assert a Robinson-Patman claim. See Edward J. Sweeney & Sons, Inc. v. Texaco, Inc., 637 F.2d 105 (3d 
Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 911, 101 S. Ct. 1981, 68 L. Ed. 2d 300 (1981); Klein v. Lionel Corp., 237 F.2d 13 (3d Cir. 
1956). Plaintiffs counter with cases from other jurisdictions which have permitted indirect purchasers to sue for Robinson-
Patman violations. See, e.g., Schwimmer v. Sony Corp., 637 F.2d 41 (2d Cir. 1980). We conclude that Third Circuit case law 
dictates that Juniata has no standing to assert the Robinson-Patman claim and its claim in this regard will be dismissed. "
551,3," See also Doc. No. 174, tab 22 (Blew deposition). "
552,4," The declarant would not have to include an explicit statement that the affidavit was based upon personal knowledge but it 
should at least appear from the substance of the document that it is so based. Copiers Typewriters Calculators, Inc. v. Toshiba 
Corp., 576 F. Supp. 312 (D. Md. 1983). Thus, we cannot accept Fuller's bald statement concerning the pricing at the Quality Inn 
because so much other testimony on the same issue is based upon hearsay. We note that the Thuss affidavit is acceptable but 
does not appear to be probative since all it establishes is that he had to lower his prices to make sales."
552,5," Serv submitted a subsequent affidavit from Kotsalos on its own behalf, alleging that the prices charged by Feeser on all 
products, not just Serv, were generally higher than Sky's prices. (See Doc. No. 167, Kotsalos declaration, para. 1). Not to be 
outdone, plaintiffs' obtained yet another affidavit from Kotsalos qualifying the affidavit he gave to Serv. In his third and final af 
fidavit, Kotsalos explained that the higher prices for non-Serv products were for products of a higher quality than the non-Serv 
products offered by Sky. (Doc. No. 175, Kotsalos affidavit, para. 3). Hence, Kotsalos' second affidavit has been negated and 
comparison of these products is not helpful in determining why Feeser's Serv pricing was higher than Weis' or Sky's. "
554,6," Defendant submitted the declaration of John Gardner, Gardner's Secretary Treasurer, Director and Buyer, to rebut plaintiffs' 
claim of injury to Gardner's. (Doc. No. 167, Gardner declarat@on). This affidavit does not help defendant for the same reason 
defendant has attacked plaintiff's affidavits. We are not satisfied that it is made on personal knowledge. Additionally, Gardner's 
overall growth would be irrelevant, for reasons discussed above, for a Robinson-Patman claim. "
558,7, Our own calculation is 4.35% but the difference is immaterial.
558,8, Our own calculation is 35.45%. 
559,9," We limited plaintiffs' discovery concerning Tartan and Ski to 1984. (See Doc. No. 39, Order, dated April 29, 1986 at para. (a)). 
The figures for these competitors are far more impressive. Feeser paid a higher price than Tartan 79.38% of the time and the 
same price 6.23% of the time. Feeser paid a higher price than Sky 74.72% of the time and the same price 6.18% of the time. We discount these figures because plaintiffs have not explored the other relevant years although they could have sought an 
enlargement of discovery to do so. We recall that, although the order did limit plaintiffs to 1984, it was not conclusive of further 
discovery concerning third party distributors if the initial discovery was favorable. Plaintiff could have sought a modification of our 
order. Their failure to marshal the evidence in their favor, as is their burden on a motion for summary judgment, see Celotex, 
supra, requires us to find against them on this issue."
559,10," In other respects, consistent with our discussion above, those paragraphs of Dr. Larner's affidavit relying upon salesmen 
hearsay, must be rejected."
559,11," Section I of the Sherman Act provides, in pertinent part, as follows: Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several 
states . . . is declared to be illegal . . . ."
559,15, U.S.C. § 1. 
560,12, It is therefore irrelevant that plaintiffs have not concluded discovery on their Sherman Act claim. 
561,13," No such claim had been made, however, since all sales had been intrastate. "
562,14," Certain favored customers, however, also received special allowances. Morton Salt, 334 U.S. at 42 and n.5, 68 S. Ct. at 826

581,1," Defendants have also filed a motion to strike the March 22, 1989 affidavit of Jeff Ross (Ross Aff. I), the March 22, 1989 affidavit 
of Mitchell Scott Paul, and the April 28, 1989 affidavit of Barry Sacks. Ross and Paul are two of plaintiffs' trial lawyers. As noted 
in Wright & Miller, HN1[
] ""attorneys' affidavits are governed by the same rules that apply to other affidavits under Rule 56. Thus, an attorney's affidavit is admissible only to prove facts that are within his personal knowledge and as to which he is 
competent to testify . . . ."" 10A C.Wright, A. Miller and & M. Kane, Federal Practice & Procedure: CIVIL 2d § 2738 at 495. Defendants correctly describe the Ross affidavit as eighteen pages of ""argument and hearsay."" The material contained within 
the affidavit is not within Ross' personal knowledge. Nevertheless, because plaintiffs' brief contained few cites to the record, the 
Court had to rely heavily on the cites in the Ross affidavit while doing the factual research for this decision. For that reason, 
defendants' motion will be denied despite the fact that the Court agrees that the Ross affidavit is improper. In order to sort 
through the voluminous record in this case, the Court necessarily had to consider the information in the affidavit. With respect to 
any future motions, plaintiffs are admonished not to make any similar attempts to evade the page limits set by the Court. The Paul affidavit contains detailed analysis of the figures for annual shoppe sales and square footage in an attempt to prove 
that certain of defendants' alleged representations were false. The Court does not consider it improper for detailed analysis of "
582,," documentary evidence to be presented in the form of an affidavit. Defendants have done the same with the affidavit of Jane E. 
Love, which calculates the maximum adjusted royalties called for under defendants' interpretation of the franchise agreement. Barry Sacks was a Haagen-Dazs distributor in Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C. Like plaintiff Thomas Dwyer, Sacks opened 
a Haagen-Dazs shoppe before HDF was created and the franchise system developed. Sachs states in his affidavit that he ""was 
part of several discussions concerning the development of the Haagen-Dazs dip shoppe concept."" Affidavit of Barry Sacks at 
par. 4. On that basis alone, Sacks proceeds to assert facts clearly outside his own personal knowledge and contrary to the 
requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). Some illustrations include:"
582,5," . The Mattus family was always far more interested in what the dip shoppes could do to develop new markets . . . than in 
the dip shoppes themselves. . . . ."
582,8, . I was aware that Doris Mattus knew next to nothing about franchising . . . . . . . .
582,12," . Neither the well being of franchisees, nor their competitive situation, nor the promises that had been made to 
franchisees were ever, to my knowledge, significant issues when it came to a question of making money for Doris Mattus. Sacks Aff. at 2. All of these statements are nothing more than conclusory allegations as to what the Mattus family ""was interested in,"" ""knew"" or 
did not know, or believed or did not believe. Sacks is not qualified to testify as to what the Mattus family was thinking and his 
statements to that effect are inadmissible and should be disregarded. See Camfield Tires, Inc. v. Michelin Tire Corp., 719 F.2d 
1361, 1367 (8th Cir. 1983) (affidavit of corporate officer as to reasons why another company began buying from dealers other 
than his company did not create a fact issue on motion for summary judgment because it comprised ""inferences, opinions and 
surmises"" and not facts of which he had knowledge).  Coca Cola Co. v. Overland, Inc., 692 F.2d 1250 (9th Cir. 1982) 
(employees of defendant's bar were not qualified to testify as to what their customers were thinking when they used the term 
""Coke,"" thus affidavit of employees that customers used ""Coke"" in the generic sense inadmissible on motion for summary 
judgment).  Therefore, defendants' motion to strike the Sacks affidavit will be granted."
582,2, The defendants did not move for summary judgment on the Minnesota Franchise Act claims in Dwyer. 
585,3," Footnotes to chart summarizing plaintiffs. a. Shoppe opened April 1978, before franchise agreement signed. b. Shoppe opened May 1980 before franchise agreement signed. c. This is the date Dwyer acquired ownership of a previously established shoppe. d. David Fulton and Frances Fulton are the parents of John Fulton. David Fulton and Frances Fulton were not parties to the 
original franchise agreement; however, they took over the operation of the shoppe in or about October 1985 when John Fulton 
and his wife Sharon Fulton declared bankruptcy. Although David Fulton and Frances Fulton have signed a franchise agreement, 
HDSC has not consented to the transfer of the franchise because John Fulton and Sharon Fulton refused to sign a general 
release in favor of HDSC. Affidavit of Stephen Van Velkinburgh par. 4, 5. The standing of David Fulton and Frances Fulton to 
pursue their claims is discussed at pages 155-57. e. Mark Reiff is the executor of the estate of Melvin Albaum, the named franchisee, who is deceased. f. Co-franchisee Julie Strom is not a party. g. Emry and Hines purchased their shoppes from prior franchisees who are not parties. "
586,4," A sample franchise agreement, as well as a copy of each franchise agreement signed by the plaintiffs is contained in Exhibit F 
to the affidavit of William Z. Pentelovich. "
589,5," Claims for tortious interference with economic relations, breach of fiduciary duties and various state statutory claims were 
dismissed by this Court's Order of October 13, 1988. "
592,6," Plaintiffs claim that application of the contractual choice of law provision will result in the application of Washington law for the 
Washington plaintiffs, Janet Drago and Neal Drago and Christine Curtis and Timothy Curtis. Plaintiffs base their claim on a letter 
dated August 9, 1983, from an attorney for HDSC to the Washington State Department of Licensing and an attached copy of a 
blank franchise agreement providing that Washington law applies. Affidavit of Jeffrey I. Ross Exh. 58. The six franchise 
agreements signed by the Dragos and the Curtises were, however, all signed prior to 1983 and all provided that New York law 
should apply. Nothing suggests that the blank form cited by plaintiffs constituted an amendment to those franchise agreements. 
Therefore, the Court rejects plaintiffs' argument and will apply New York law to the claims of the Washington plaintiffs."
592,7," Plaintiffs base their argument on section 187(2)(b) of the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws which states: (2) The law of the state chosen by the parties to govern their contractual rights and duties will be applied . . . unless either . . . . (b) application of the law of the chosen state would be contrary to a fundamental policy of a state which has a materially 
greater interest than the chosen state in the determination of the particular issue and which [as the state with the most 
significant relationship to the transaction], would be the state of the applicable law in the absence of an effective choice of 
law by the parties. As noted, Minnesota's choice of law test is based on Professor Leflar's five choice-influencing considerations not the 
Restatement. Nevertheless, the same issue is raised under both tests -- would application of the chosen law violate one of the 
forum state's significant governmental interests. See R. Leflar, L. McDougal, R. Felix, American Conflicts Law (4th ed. 1986) § 
106. "
593,8," HDF is a New York corporation. The plaintiffs, Dwyer and the Pinkuses, purchased their franchises from HDF with one 
exception. The exception is Dwyer's 1984 purchase of an already existing franchise. The Pinkuses were Minnesota residents at 
the commencement of this litigation. Dwyer Amended Complaint par. 5. Dwyer's corporations, which are also named as 
plaintiffs, are Minnesota corporations. Id. Dwyer himself was a Wyoming resident. July 17, 1989 Affidavit of Thomas Dwyer par. "
594,2," . The negotiations between HDF and the plaintiffs and the execution of the franchise agreements took place in Minnesota and 
New Jersey. See July 6, 1989 Letter of Sally Scoggin at 1-4 and Exh. B."
594,9," See, e.g., Minn.Stat. §§ 80C.02-80C.04; Cal.Corp.Code §§ 31110, 31111(h), 31125; Wash.Rev.Code §§ 19.100.020, 
19.100.040(8). The California Commissioner of Corporations, for example, has stated that the California Franchise Investment 
Law ""precludes franchisors and franchisees from negotiating a franchise which differs from the terms registered pursuant to 
Section 31111 of the [Franchise Investment Law]."" See March 29, 1989 Affidavit of Jonathan L. Eisenberg par. 4 and Exh. C. In 
addition, see Wash.Rev.Code § 19.100.180(2)(c) and Minn.Rules § 2860.4400(b) prohibiting discrimination between 
franchisees. "
596,10," Plaintiffs point out that in a parallel case to this one, McGowan v. The Pillsbury Co., 723 F. Supp. 530, 537 (D.Wash. 1989), 
the court refused to grant summary judgment dismissing the claims against HDSC for breach prior to Pillsbury's acquisition of 
the Mattus' companies. Ross. Aff. II Exh. 66 at 15. However, it does not appear that the court in that case considered the 
language of the purchase agreement. As explanation for its decision, the Washington court stated only that, ""HDSC does not 
explain why this acquisition should not include liability for breaches of contracts by HDF prior to the date of acquisition."" Id. See, 
however, another parallel case where no successor liability was found. Rosenberg v. The Pillsbury Co., 718 F. Supp. 1146, slip 
op. at 8-10 (S.D.N.Y. 1989)."
596,11," See this Court's Orders dated January 4, 1988 (discussing ownership of the business by the Mattus family and their 
corporations, HDI, HDF and WSC until the Pillsbury acquisition on July 11, 1983) and October 13, 1988 (discussing in detail the 
ownership of the companies before and after the Pillsbury acquisition). "
599,12," The plaintiffs who have made this allegation are Carlock, the Crawfords, the Goldfines, the Goodmans, the Pinkuses and 
Dwyer. "
600,13," In January 1985, Charles Kanan replaced Mattus-Hurley as president of HDSC."
600,14," The national marketing campaign fund promise is discussed further at pages 67-68, 109-10. "
601,15," This holding is in accord with Rosenberg v. The Pillsbury Co., 718 F. Supp. 1146, 1156-1157 (S.D.N.Y. 1989), a parallel case 
in which it held that paragraph 4 of the Haagen-Dazs franchise agreement precluded the claim that the mass distribution of 
prepackaged pints constituted a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. "
602,16," The franchisor did, of course, have the power to amend the shoppe manual. If HDF or HDSC did properly amend the shoppe 
manual by distributing the pages containing the new usage factors to franchisees prior to changing the amount of overrun, then 
there would be no breach. "
603,17," Defendants have also offered evidence that they have offered franchisees products and services which go beyond the 
minimum obligations of the franchise agreement. See Affidavit of Joseph A. Geraci par. 13. "
605,18," Although paragraph 10.1 provides for a minimum annual royalty of $4,000, adjusted in $ 100 increments according to the 
same formula quoted above, the franchisor has always collected royalties based upon the actual gallons sold by the franchisee. 
Geraci Aff. at par. 3. This is despite the fact that, during the years 1985-88, the purchases of each of the plaintiffs (with the "
606,," exception of one shoppe in one year) were such that the per gallon royalty was less than the minimum annual royalty. Id. at par. 
4."
606,19, In December of the immediately preceding year. 
608,20," Defendants argue that these letters should not be considered by the Court for two reasons. First, defendants argue that the 
May 7, 1980 letter was not produced by any of the plaintiffs in response to document production requests served upon them. "
609,," See Affidavit of Linda Olson par. 4. The only copy of the letter available is an unsigned one which defendants had produced to 
plaintiffs. Id. The January 27, 1982 letter is signed and it was produced only by one plaintiff, Janet Drago. Id. at par. 5. Second, defendants argue that the letters should not be considered for the purposes of these motions because the letters were 
submitted to the Court through an affidavit from plaintiffs' trial counsel stating that the letters were sent by Paley to the 
franchisees. See March 20, 1989 Ross Aff. at par. 5. As defendants note, whether the letters were sent to franchisees is not 
within counsel's personal knowledge. Moreover, some question exists about whether the May 7, 1980 letter offered was ever 
sent to the franchisees because not one of the plaintiffs produced it. The Court will allow the letters to be considered for the purposes of this motion. Even assuming that the May 7, 1980 letter was 
not sent to the franchisees, it is relevant evidence of how the defendants calculated the royalty adjustment. Defendants remain 
free to raise these and other objections to the admissibility of this evidence at trial. "
620,21," The Court has already held that there was no fiduciary relationship between the plaintiffs and defendants in this case. Order 
dated October 13, 1988 at 26-28. "
622,22," Plaintiffs only response to the motion for summary judgment on Dwyer's claims is contained in the March 22, 1989 affidavit of 
Jeff Ross. All plaintiffs say is: Defendants do not deny that the statements and concealment were made. The facts and circumstances surrounding this 
transaction give rise to a claim for fraud. Pillsbury ended up paying a substantial sum of money to the former shoppe 
owner. There were many promises to act by Pillsbury to mitigate the situation. It is apparent that fact questions abound. Ross Aff. I at 18. "
628,23," The Court notes that plaintiffs have failed to present responding argument regarding their claims under state price 
discrimination statutes."
628,24," See infra at slip op. at 155-59 for a discussion of the standing of John Fulton, Sharon Fulton, Frances Fulton and David Fulton."
628,25," Oregon Revised Statutes § 646.040 HN39[
] makes it unlawful for: any person . . . either directly or indirectly, to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities . . . of like 
grade and quality . . . where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a 
monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy or prevent competition with any person who either grants or 
knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them. "
630,26," Even if plaintiffs could properly state a claim for price discrimination under the California Unfair Practices Act, summary 
judgment in favor of defendants on Count X of the Carlock complaint would be appropriate in light of plaintiffs' failure to present 
evidence of price discrimination and injury to competition. "
632,27," The Court recognizes that this order does not resolve all issues with regard to the particular claims of individual plaintiffs that 
may be resolved prior to trial. The Court will consider entertaining future motions aimed at resolving these issues. "
633,28," Wash.Rev.Code Ann. § 190.100.180(2) provides in relevant part: (2) For the purposes of this chapter and without limiting its general application, it shall be an unfair or deceptive act or 
practice or an unfair method of competition and therefore unlawful and a violation of this chapter for any person to: (a) Restrict or inhibit the right of the franchisees to join an association of franchisees. (b) Require a franchisee to purchase or lease goods or services of the franchisor or from approved sources of supply 
unless and to the extent that the franchisor satisfies the burden of proving that such restrictive purchasing agreements are "
634,," reasonably necessary for a lawful purpose justified on business grounds, and do not substantially affect competition; 
Provided, That this provision shall not apply to the initial inventory of the franchise. . . . (c) Discriminate between franchisees in the charges offered or made for royalties, goods, services, equipment, rentals, 
advertising services, or in any other business dealing, unless and to the extent that the franchisor satisfies the burden of 
proving that any classification of or discrimination between franchisees is reasonable, is based on franchises granted at 
materially different times and such discrimination is reasonably related to such difference in time or on other proper and 
justifiable distinctions considering the purposes of this chapter, and is not arbitrary. (d) Sell, rent, or offer to sell to a franchisee any product or service for more than a fair and reasonable price. (e) Obtain money, goods, services, anything of value, or any other benefit from any other person with whom the franchisee 
does business on account of such business unless such benefit is disclosed to the franchisee. (f) If the franchise provides that the franchisee has an exclusive territory, which exclusive territory shall be specified in the 
franchise agreement, for the franchisor or subfranchisor to compete with the franchisee in an exclusive territory or to grant 
competitive franchises in the exclusive territory area previously granted to another franchisee. (g) Require franchisee to assent to a release, assignment, novation, or waiver which would relieve any person from liability 
imposed by this chapter. (h) Impose on a franchisee by contract, rule, or regulation, whether written or oral, any standard of conduct unless the 
person so doing can sustain the burden of proving such to be reasonable and necessary. (i) Refuse to renew a franchise without fairly compensating the franchisee for the fair market value, at the time of expiration 
of the franchise, of the franchisee's inventory, supplies, equipment, and furnishing purchased from the franchisor, and good 
will, exclusive of personalized materials which have no value to the franchisor, and inventory, supplies, equipment and 
furnishings not reasonably required in the conduct of the franchise business: Provided, That compensation need not be 
made to a franchisee for good will if (i) the franchisee has been given one year's notice of nonrenewal and (ii) the franchisor 
agrees in writing not to enforce any covenant which restrains the franchisee from competing with the franchisor: Provided 
further, That a franchisor may offset against amounts owed to a franchisee under this subsection any amounts owed by 
such franchisee to the franchisor. (j) Terminate a franchise prior to the expiration of its term except for good cause. . . ."
634,29," The corporations involved in this action are: Tivoli Enterprises, Inc.; Vanilla Chip Ice Cream Co.; Sullock Corporation; 
Sacramento Mighty Good Ice Cream Co.; Caledonia Ice Cream Co.; Foothills Ice Cream Works, Ltd.; Green Mountain Ice 
Cream Co., Inc.; Idaho Ices, Inc.; The Inside Scoop, Inc.; and ICE, Inc."
634,30," Defendants also contend that the corporate plaintiffs cannot assert antitrust claims because these plaintiffs were not 
purchasers of Haagen-Dazs ice cream for purposes of antitrust law. The Court need not decide this issue because plaintiffs' 
claims of monopolization and price discrimination brought pursuant to federal and state statutes fail on the merits, as discussed 
supra. "
636,31," Plaintiffs suggest that they were only barely aware of their claims against defendants when they filed their bankruptcy petition; 
plaintiffs intimate that this lack of knowledge somehow preserves plaintiffs' standing to assert pre-petition claims against 
defendants. The Court finds this argument to be without merit. Title 11 U.S.C. § 541 broadly states that, with a few enumerated 
exceptions, all property of a debtor passes to the bankruptcy estate. A claim about which a debtor has only vague knowledge is 
not among the enumerated exceptions, and plaintiffs cite no statutory or case authority in support of their argument. Under these 
circumstances and given the broad language of 11 U.S.C. § 541, the Court finds that plaintiffs' argument must fail. "
637,32," The general release executed by plaintiff Dwyer provided that plaintiff Dwyer, as releasor, released and discharged HDF and 
HDSC, as releasee, the RELEASEE, RELEASEE's heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns from all actions, causes of action, 
suits, debts, dues, sums of money, accounts, reckonings, bonds, bills, specialties, covenants, contracts, controversies, 
agreements, promises, variances, trespasses, damages, judgments, extents, executions, claims, and demands

administrators, successors and assigns ever had, now have or hereafter can, shall or may, have for, upon, or by reason of 
any matter, cause or thing whatsoever from the beginning of the world to the day of the date of this RELEASE, pertaining to 
a certain business known as Haagen-Dazs Shoppe, #147 located at 2906 1/2 Hennepin Avenue South, Minneapolis, Minn. 
55408 including but not limited to the Haagen-Dazs Shoppe Franchise, First Refusal Option, and Lease Assignment Option 
and all other agreement whatsoever governing the operation of that business between the parties named herein. Pentelovich Aff. Exh. G. "
638,33," The releases discussed above are limited by their terms to claims relating to a particular Haagen-Dazs franchise shoppe. 
Plaintiff Dwyer executed releases relating to his Hennepin Avenue and Ridge Square shoppes. Dwyer also operated, at certain 
times, shoppes in St. Anthony Main and downtown Minneapolis. Dwyer did not execute releases in connection with these latter 
shoppes, and accordingly any claims Dwyer asserts which arise from operation of those shoppes are not barred by a release."
638,34," Plaintiffs contend that the releases executed in connection with plaintiff Dwyer's sale of the Hennepin Avenue shoppe are 
ineffective because they were not signed by Dwyer himself. This argument is without merit as the releases were signed by Keith 
R. Mohrlant acting as Dwyer's attorney-in-fact pursuant to a written power of attorney. See Pentelovich Aff. Exh. G. "
663,1," The Warren County Rules were recently published. Both parties and the Court of Common Pleas of Warren County refer to the 
nonprosecution rule as ""Rule 37."" The newly published rules label it ""Rule L 307."" HN2[

that litigants certify a case ready for trial no later than 240 days following commencement of the action. Failure to prosecute 
within 240 days or within an extended time (where good cause was shown) results in automatic dismissal with prejudice. "
664,2," Although plaintiffs have appealed the denial of the motion for reconsideration, ""[HN3[

666,4," The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania of course is not bound by the Superior Court's decision in Camelback, but in light of the 
persuasiveness of that opinion and the absence of Pennsylvania Supreme Court intimations to the contrary, we conclude that 
Pennsylvania courts would most likely follow the rule announced in that case. See supra note 3."
666,5," Because we conclude that plaintiffs' civil RICO claims are barred by res judicata, we do not reach the question whether the civil 
RICO count should have been dismissed for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted. The state law claims in this case were brought before the state court and are also barred from further litigation. There can be no 
question that the four elements of the Pennsylvania law of res judicata (identity of the thing sued upon, the cause of action, the 
persons and parties to the action, and the quality or capacity of the parties) are met with respect to the state claims. In fact, the 
complaints in the state court and in the federal court delineating the alleged scheme and the parties are virtually identical. We 
therefore conclude that Pennsylvania's law of claim preclusion would preclude relitigation of these claims in federal court as well. "
671,1," Although, as the majority notes, this court must look to the law of Pennsylvania to determine the res judicata effect of prior 
judgments of the courts of the Commonwealth, see Marrese v. American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 470 U.S. 373, 380-
83, 84 L. Ed. 2d 274, 105 S. Ct. 1327 (1985), this court does not owe deference to opinions of the courts of the Commonwealth 
in interpreting the jurisdictional provisions of a federal statute, a question that is obviously one of federal law."
671,2," The jurisdictional provision of the Clayton Act states: Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue 
therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, 
without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of 
suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee."

677,2," Prior to its relationship with Northwest, Fischer had provided regional service for USAir in Detroit. "
678,3," The acquisition of Republic also gave the new Northwest/Republic combination overlapping regional service contracts for the 
Twin Cities area, but the regional carriers there, Express I and Mesaba, reached a mutual agreement, without incident, to divide 
routes and share the market."
678,4," Such an agreement would provide Fischer with routes that Simmons, after being granted the right of first refusal, had declined 
to serve. "
679,5," The Supreme Court has held that ""it is well accepted * * * that without filing a cross-appeal or cross-petition, an appellee may 
rely upon any matter appearing in the record in support of the judgment below."" Schweiker v. Hogan, 457 U.S. 569, 585 n. 24,

(1982)). Therefore, in this appeal, Northwest and Simmons may properly rely on the issue of antitrust injury (which the district 
court chose not to decide) in seeking affirmance of the district court's summary judgment order. We affirm the order as it relates 
to Fischer's antitrust claims on antitrust injury grounds alone. We are able to do so because antitrust injury is a threshold issue 
that plaintiffs must establish in order to have standing to sue under the antitrust laws. See Midwest Communications v. 
Minnesota Twins, 779 F.2d 444 (8th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1163, 90 L. Ed. 2d 730, 106 S. Ct. 2289 (1986) (where 
plaintiff fails to show antitrust injury, it lacks standing to sue under the antitrust laws and the court need not reach the merits of its 
antitrust claims). See generally L. A. Sullivan, Antitrust, 770, 774. In light of Midwest Communications, we affirm the dismissal of 
Fischer's antitrust claims on grounds of lack of standing, so we need not examine the merits of the claims; specifically, whether 
Northwest and Simmons conspired to monopolize the Detroit market or to terminate Fischer, or whether the Republic acquisition 
was barred by the approval of the Department of Transportation. "
680,6," HN2[
] Rule 56(c) provides that summary judgment ""shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material 
fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law."" In Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265, 106 S. Ct. 2548 (1986), the Supreme Court stated that ""one of the 
principal purposes of the summary judgment rule is to isolate and dispose of factually unsupported claims or defenses * * *."" 477 
U.S. at 323-24. Therefore, HN3[
] ""summary judgment procedure is properly regarded not as a disfavored procedural shortcut, 
but rather as an integral part of the Federal Rules as a whole * * *."" Id. at 327. Rule 56 must be construed with due regard not only for the rights of persons asserting claims and defenses that are 
adequately based in fact to have those claims and defenses tried to a jury, but also for the rights of persons opposing such 
claims and defenses to demonstrate in the manner provided by the Rule, prior to trial, that the claims and defenses have no 
factual basis. Id. The Court in Celotex then held that summary judgment must be granted where a party fails to make a sufficient factual showing 
regarding an essential element of its case: In our view, HN4[
] the plain language of Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element 
essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial. In such a situation, there can be 
""no genuine issue as to any material fact,"" since a complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the 
nonmoving party's case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial. The moving party is ""entitled to a judgment as a 
matter of law"" because the nonmoving party has failed to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of her case 
with respect to which she has the burden of proof. "

681,7," Section 4 states that ""any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the 
antitrust laws may sue therefor * * *."" We note the Second Circuit's recent observation that the United States Supreme Court has indicated that although a showing of 
antitrust injury is required from plaintiffs in both injunction and damages cases, ""standing analysis under § 16 will not always be 
identical to standing analysis under § 4."" See Consolidated Gold Fields PLC v. Minorco, S.A., 871 F.2d 252, 259 n. 6 (2d Cir. 
1989) (quoting Cargill v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 111, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427, 107 S. Ct. 484 n. 6 (1986)). The court in Gold Fields explains that: Since section 4 allows for treble-damage recovery, courts will generally be more circumspect about granting relief: ""In order 
to protect against multiple lawsuits and duplicative recoveries, courts should examine other factors in addition to antitrust 
injury, such as the potential for duplicative recovery, the complexity of apportioning damages, and the existence of other 
parties that have been more directly harmed, to determine whether a party is a proper plaintiff under § 4.""  Id.; see also Associated General Contractors of California, Inc. v. Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 544-45, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723, 103 S. Ct. 
897 (1983). In other words, the court in Gold Fields observes, ""Cargill supports the proposition that standing analysis under section 16 is * * * 
less rigorous than that under section 4."" Consolidated Gold Fields, 871 F.2d at 259 n. 6. We need not apply the extra-rigorous 
Cargill standing analysis to Fischer's antitrust claims since Fischer has failed to cross the initial threshold of proving that it 
suffered an antitrust injury. However, we note that even if it had done so, Fischer would still have had further obstacles to pass 
before it could establish that it was entitled to damages under section 4. "
682,8," We note that two of Fischer's common-law claims cite Simmons as a defendant or co-defendant. Therefore, they are arguably 
not covered by the mandatory arbitration clause in the 1985 Northwest/Fischer agreement. We take no position on that question, 
as Fischer has briefed and argued the five common-law claims as though they were either all covered by the clause or not 
covered at all. During oral argument, counsel for Fischer stated that the common-law claims against Simmons ""rise and fall 
depending on whether there is concerted action"" found between Northwest and Simmons. In addition, Argument III in Fischer's 
brief reads, ""The Trial Court Erred in Holding That the Arbitration Clause of the Fischer Bros.-Northwest Agreement Barred All 
Common Law Claims"" (emphasis added). Appellant's brief at i. In the district court, Judge Alsop dismissed the common-law 
claims against Simmons on substantive grounds, concluding that both claims were predicated on an alleged agreement between 
Northwest and Simmons to terminate Fischer and that Fischer ""simply failed to create a factual issue regarding the existence of 
an agreement to terminate [Fischer]."" Fischer v. NWA, slip op. at 21."
682,9," It is clear that Fischer chose quite early in the development of its claims to ignore the arbitration clause. On October 14, 1986, 
well within any measurement of the 120-day time period, Fischer, instead of seeking arbitration, sent a notice of default to 
Northwest. The notice alleged that Northwest had breached the 1985 agreement and threatened Northwest with legal action. "
684,1," Airlines operating on a nationwide basis have developed ""hubs,"" populous cities at which substantial numbers of an airline's

684,3," The President of Simmons candidly admitted that Northwest's representations ""were a factor"" in his thinking concerning 
whether to oppose the merger before the DOT."

Ed. 2d 538, 106 S. Ct. 1348 (1985). Plaintiff's evidence does precisely that. Cf.  In re Workers' Compensation Insurance Antitrust 
Litigation, 867 F.2d 1552, 1560-61 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 492 U.S. 920, 109 S. Ct. 3247, 106 L. Ed. 2d 593, 57 U.S.L.W. 3859

of conspiracy based upon parallel behavior and evidence of telephone conversation between two defendants). "
686,6," Northwest argued before the DOT that commuter carriers can compete effectively even without affiliation with a major carrier or 
through affiliation with a major carrier at cities where the major carrier does not operate a hub. Northwest further argued that 
there are no barriers to the creation of a hub at Detroit by a competing major airline. These, of course, are questions of fact 
which cannot be resolved on a motion for summary judgment. "

immunity provisions of section 1384 which, prior to amendment in 1978, had provided: Any person affected by any order under [the Federal Aviation Act] shall be, and is hereby, relieved from the operation of the 
""antitrust laws"" . . . and of all other restraints or prohibitions made by, or imposed under, authority of law, insofar as may be 
necessary to enable such person to do anything authorized, approved, or required by such order."
688,9," The Court overturned an award of more than $ 145 million to TWA, which the airline alleged had resulted from its control by 
Hughes Tool Co. (Toolco). In its lawsuit, TWA alleged Toolco had required TWA to purchase or lease airplanes from Toolco 
alone. The CAB had approved Toolco's control over TWA in orders issued in 1944, 1948, 1950, and 1960, and had approved 
each acquisition or lease of aircraft by TWA from Toolco. 409 U.S. at 369, 379. The CAB argued before the Court that it had 
approved the arrangements only on the basis of a lack of showing of anticompetitive effects in the airline industry, not in the 
aircraft manufacturing industry, but the Supreme Court ruled the CAB had the authority to consider all aspects of a transaction 
and found Toolco immune from suit.  Id. at 389. "
689,10," Scholars agree that the task of resolving ""those difficult situations in which antitrust enforcement appears to be coextensive 
with administrative regulation"" is not an easy one. See 16E Business Organizations, Von Kalinowski, Antitrust Laws and Trade 
Regulations § 44A.01[1] at 44A-2 (1989). Whether phrased in terms of immunity or exclusive jurisdiction, the issue in this case is 
whether Congress intended to leave judgments about whether mergers violate the antitrust laws entirely to the agency (with 
review in the court of appeals), even when the agency declines to exempt the merger from the operation of the antitrust laws. 
See Id. at §§ 44.01, 44 A. 05 (discussing exclusive jurisdiction under the rubric of exemptions and immunities to the antitrust 
laws). See also K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise § 22.9 at 116 (2d ed. 1983); P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law, para. 
223h (1978)."
689,11," ""Repeals of the antitrust laws by implication from a regulatory statute are strongly disfavored,"" and have only been found ""in

U.S. 321, 350-51, 10 L. Ed. 2d 915, 83 S. Ct. 1715 (1963)."
689,12," It is also more consistent with actual enforcement of the antitrust laws, given Congress' view of the agency's record in this 
regard. As the Senate Report noted, the CAB tended to ""identify its own success with the profitability of individual carriers"" and 
had also tended to regard mergers as ""a tool for insuring the financial well-being"" of economically ailing air carriers. S.Rep. No.

689,13," The district court dismissed plaintiff's state law claims against Simmons for lack of sufficient evidence of an agreement 
between Simmons and Northwest. Because I find sufficient evidence of such an agreement to withstand a motion for summary 
judgment, I would reverse this dismissal, notwithstanding Simmons' argument on appeal that plaintiff has abandoned its state 
law claims against Simmons. Plaintiff clearly has argued the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain its claim of an agreement 
between Simmons and Northwest, and its state law claims ""rise or fall"" on the basis of this issue. See n. 8 supra at 600. "
696,*," Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation. "
697,1," Blue Cross established the adverse selection policy in June 1986, without approval from DBR. In October 1986, DBR ordered 
Blue Cross to suspend the policy until it obtained DBR approval. On November 12, 1986, the DBR approved Blue Cross's rate 
formula, and Blue Cross resumed its use."
697,2," Here and at other points in this opinion we use the term ""Ocean State"" to refer collectively to both plaintiffs -- Ocean State itself 
and the class of participating physicians."
697,3," Under section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15 (1982), any person injured by such unlawful monopolization may bring suit 
for treble damages, and under section 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 26 (1982), any person threatened with such injury may 
sue for injunctive relief. Ocean State also claimed that Blue Cross had violated section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1 (1982), which prohibits 
contracts, combinations, and conspiracies in restraint of trade. Ocean State alleged that Blue Cross had violated section 1 by (1) 
attaining monopoly power through a merger between Blue Cross and Blue Shield in 1982, and (2) conspiring with the Rhode 
Island Group Health Association (""RIGHA""), the only HMO operating in Rhode Island before 1984, to control hospital discounts. 
At the close of the plaintiffs' case, the district court directed a verdict in favor of Blue Cross on the section 1 claims. The court 
ruled that there was no evidence that the Blue Cross-Blue Shield merger had an anticompetitive effect, and that there was no "
698,," evidence that plaintiffs were injured as a result of the agreement between Blue Cross and RIGHA. Ocean State does not 
seriously challenge this directed verdict on appeal. In a footnote to its brief, Ocean State suggests only that if this court were to 
order a new trial on antitrust matters, plaintiffs should be entitled to press their section 1 claims. At oral argument, Ocean State's 
counsel said that it had addressed the section 1 claims ""en passant."" This ""en passant"" presentation did not suffice to preserve 
the section 1 issue on appeal, and therefore we will not consider it further."
698,4," It might seem incongruous at first blush for Ocean State to allege that Blue Cross engaged in anticompetitive behavior by 
raising its rates. Such allegations of anticompetitive conduct are usually reserved for cases in which companies lower their rates, 
incurring short-term losses for the purpose of undercutting competitors and putting them out of business. Here, however, Ocean 
State argues plausibly that many employers felt committed to offer Blue Cross to their employees. Since their Blue Cross rates 
would increase if they also offered Ocean State, these employers allegedly felt pressure not to adopt (or to drop) Ocean State in 
order to keep their Blue Cross rates down. The personnel manager of one company testified to this effect at trial. "
700,5," The jury initially awarded each plaintiff, Ocean State and the physician class, compensatory damages of $ 2,693,437 and 
punitive damages of $ 250,000, undifferentiated as to claim. Noting that Ocean State and the physicians allegedly suffered 
distinct injuries, the court instructed the jury that it must award damages separately for each plaintiff and for each claim. After 
further deliberation, the jury awarded Ocean State compensatory damages of $ 947,000 and punitive damages of $ 250,000 and 
awarded the physicians compensatory damages of $ 1,746,437. But the verdict forms did not indicate whether the awards were 
for damages on the antitrust claim, the tortious interference claim, or both. The district court then instructed the jury that it must 
specify the claims upon which it awarded damages. Finally, on its third try, the jury awarded ""no damages"" on the antitrust claim 
and the same damages as on the second verdict form on the tortious interference claim. In light of the jury's evident difficulty in 
apportioning the damages between the two claims, it is altogether possible that the jury viewed the damages as stemming from 
both the antitrust violations and the tortious interference. Inasmuch as the jury had been instructed that it could not award 
damages twice for the same injury, it could not assign the damages to both claims. The jury was not instructed -- as perhaps it 
should have been -- that it could assign the same amount to each claim, with the proviso that any award reflecting the 
overlapping of the two claims was to be made once, not twice."
700,6," On this appeal Blue Cross presses its argument with respect to the use of the adverse selection factors, but not with respect to 
HealthMate. But Blue Cross raised the issue with respect to HealthMate in the court below, and Ocean State responded to the 
argument with respect to HealthMate in its appellate brief. Therefore, we do not think that the argument with respect to 
HealthMate has been waived. "
701,7," For this reason, Ocean State's observation that under Rhode Island law Blue Cross is considered not to be ""part of the 
insurance industry,"" Hospital Service Corp. v. West, 112 R.I. 164, 178, 308 A.2d 489, 497 (1973), is not dispositive. Whether or 
not Blue Cross is considered to be ""in the insurance business"" for certain purposes, the challenged activities still constitute ""the 
business of insurance."" ""The exemption is for the 'business of insurance,' not the 'business of insurers.'"" Royal Drug, 440 U.S. at 
211. "
702,8," Ocean State also argues that the adverse selection policy is not exempted by the McCarran-Ferguson Act because Blue Cross 
began using the adverse selection formula before state approval was obtained. See note 2, supra. But this lapse on Blue 
Cross's part has little bearing on whether the use of the adverse selection factors was ""regulated by state law."" It was precisely 
because of the presence of a comprehensive state regulatory system that DBR was able to order Blue Cross to suspend its use 
of the adverse selection formula, and Blue Cross did not resume its use until after DBR approval was obtained."
702,9," Much of the case law interpreting the provision focuses upon the ""boycott"" rather than the ""coercion, or intimidation"" aspect of 
the exception. See, e.g., St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Co. v. Barry, 438 U.S. 531, 57 L. Ed. 2d 932, 98 S. Ct. 2923 (1978). 
Coercion has not generally been interpreted to include situations where options have not been entirely closed off to the allegedly 
coerced parties, even though such options may have been made more expensive. In Klamath-Lake Pharmaceutical Ass'n v. 
Klamath Medical Service Bureau, 701 F.2d 1276 (9th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 822, 78 L. Ed. 2d 96, 104 S. Ct. 88 
(1983), for example, the requirement by a nonprofit provider of health insurance and health care services that its insureds use 
the provider's pharmacy to receive the pharmacy benefits under its policies did not amount to an attempt to boycott, coerce, or 
intimidate other pharmacies where the provider did not preclude its insurers from patronizing other pharmacies. See also 
Feinstein v. Nettleship Co. of Los Angeles, 714 F.2d 928 (9th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 466 U.S. 972, 80 L. Ed. 2d 820, 104 S. 
Ct. 2346 (1984) (agreement between county medical association and medical malpractice insurers to offer malpractice 
insurance only to association members was not an agreement to boycott or coerce physicians to purchase carriers' insurance)."
702,10," In any event, Ocean State has waived the coercion argument. At trial, although the district court declined to rule on whether 
Blue Cross's conduct was covered by the McCarran-Ferguson exemption, it did rule that the exception did not apply, noting that 
""there's no evidence of boycott, intimidation or otherwise."" Ocean State apparently objected to this ruling but failed to take 
exception to it in its initial brief on appeal. It made no argument that Blue Cross's conduct took the form of coercion within the 
meaning of the McCarran-Ferguson Act. Ocean State's resurrection of this argument in its reply brief comes too late. "
704,11," In the present case, Ocean State alleges that Blue Cross never actually passed along its savings to subscribers. But nothing 
turns on whether Blue Cross in fact lowered its rates. The fact remains that achieving lower costs is a legitimate business 
justification under the antitrust laws. "
705,12," Ocean State likens Blue Cross's conduct to the efforts of the A & P company, found to be illegal in United States v. New York 
Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., 173 F.2d 79 (7th Cir. 1949), ""to exert pressure on suppliers either not to deal or to alter their 
dealings with A & P's competitors"" (as summarized in Travelers Insurance, 481 F.2d at 85). We find the resemblance to be 
slight. A & P's pressure on suppliers included a refusal to buy from suppliers who sold to anyone else through brokers. This, in 
turn, closed out competitors -- presumably including smaller groceries -- who were unable to buy directly from suppliers. See A & 
P, 173 F.2d at 83. In contrast, there is no evidence that Blue Cross refused to deal with Ocean State physicians, or that it 
pressured Ocean State physicians to alter their dealings with Ocean State. "
711,*," American Stores initiated a hostile takeover bid for the Lucky chain on March 21, 1988. Pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino 
Antitrust Improvements Act, 90 Stat. 1390, 15 U. S. C. § 18a, American Stores notified the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) of 
its intentions. On May 23, American Stores increased its tender offer, and Lucky's board of directors approved the merger. On 
May 31, the FTC filed an administrative complaint alleging violations of § 7 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731, as amended, 15 U. 
S. C. § 18, and § 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 38 Stat. 719, as amended, 15 U. S. C. § 45. The FTC simultaneously 
proposed a consent order under which it would settle its antitrust complaint in exchange for American Stores' compliance with 
certain demands, including divestiture of certain supermarkets in northern California and an agreement to ""hold separate"" the 
two firms until American Stores satisfied all of the consent order's conditions. American Stores agreed to the consent order, and 
by June 9 completed its $ 2.5 billion acquisition of the outstanding Lucky stock. On August 31, the FTC gave final approval to the 
proposed consent order without modification. On September 1, applicant initiated the underlying action. "

720,2," ""If a case has progressed to or beyond a jury verdict or district court judgment, a local government defendant would need

Metzenbaum at 130 Cong.Rec. S 14368 (daily ed. Oct. 11, 1984): ""A number of Senators felt quite strongly that a plaintiff who has won a jury verdict should not have that verdict taken away 
by intervening legislation -- others disagreed. The Senate language, which was accepted by the conferees, reflects hardfought, difficult negotiations among Senators."" "
721,3," It is true that in Miami Int'l Realty Co. v. Town of Mt. Crested Butte, 607 F. Supp. 448, 454 (D.Colo. 1985), the district court 
stated that ""the legislative history clearly indicates that Congress contemplated that relevant alternative remedies would consist 
solely of Clayton Act injunctive relief against the municipal defendant, rather than damage relief from other private defendants."" 
(Emphasis supplied.) This statement is not borne out by the legislative history cited in its support, and the proposition seems to 
us to be in conflict with the plain language of the statute. The phrase ""all the circumstances"" does not, on its face, mean anything 
less than the totality of the circumstances. Even if the statute had mentioned availability of alternative relief ""from the local 
government defendant"" -- a qualification that is conspicuous by its absence -- this would not have made the listed factors 
exclusive. The Colorado district court was closer to the mark, we believe, when, at another point in its opinion, it characterized 
the statute as one ""directing that all circumstances be considered and enumerating some, but not all, of the relevant factors."" Id. 
at 452 n. 2. Opdyke itself concedes that ""other equitable considerations are generally considered by the courts in ruling on the 
applicability of the Act to a pending case."" "

742,1, This is the heading used by plaintiff in the Complaint. Docket No. 1 at 16. 
743,2," Unlike antitrust law in general and this suit in particular, the plastic bottle industry is not lacking in sex appeal. A Sewell inter-
department memorandum states that: It has now been approximately six weeks since Incon was approved to supply Coca-Cola Bottlers. Their pricing has been 
somewhat erotic [sic] with both labeled and unlabeled bottles in a 6/1 200# H-divider box being quoted at $ 315.00/m. DTX 614 (November 25, 1980)."
743,3," Plaintiff now disputes this fact, which it had previously admitted without qualification in answering a request for admission. 
Plaintiff's response, Tab 1 at 38. "
747,4," ""Equivalent cases"" is a standard measure in the soft drink industry which allows aggregation across different bottle sizes. The 
unit of measure is a 192 fluid ounce case, so that a 16 ounce bottle is.0833 equivalent cases, a two liter bottle is.3522 equivalent 
cases, a three liter bottle is.5283 equivalent cases and a one liter bottle is.1761 equivalent cases. "
749,5," Plaintiff alleged that the Bottlers specifically demanded a price of $ 200 per thousand bottles during a meeting at the Litchfield 
Beach Inn. Docket No. 102A at 10. The court accepted this allegation as a fact in the May 6, 1988, order. Docket No. 146 at 6. 
Plaintiff has renewed this allegation. Plaintiff's response, Tab 1 at 125. Defendants have urged the court to review this finding. 
Docket No. 246 at 16. The court has reviewed the material cited by plaintiff in support of its allegation. See PTX 280; Endres dep. at 401-05; 446-47; 
Maffeo dep. at 156-57; Stewart Dep. at 219-21. The evidence simply does not support the assertion that the Bottlers demanded 
a specific price of $ 200. First, there is no direct evidence, documents or testimony, about a specific price demand of $ 200. 
There is evidence that the Bottlers knew that Western Container reported a two liter manufacturing cost of $ 200 per thousand. 
PTX 280. One of Sewell's witnesses, a participant in the meeting, testified that: (1) Sewell made an initial offer which was 
rejected; (2) Sewell made a second, lower offer which was rejected; (3) he ""believe[s] that they were comparing the price [Sewell "
750,," offered] to what Western Container was manufacturing for""; and (4) Sewell's lower offer apparently was rejected because it was 
higher than Western Container's manufacturing cost. Endres dep. at 401-05. The testimony does not properly give rise to the 
inference that the Bottlers demanded that Sewell offer them a price of $ 200. Thus, the court vacates its prior finding of Sewell's 
allegation as a fact. "
755,6," Sewell also claims that a joint arrangement, which began in the fall of 1985 and lasted through approximately 1987, for 
purchasing PET resin, among Southeastern and two other companies (Western Container and Apple Container), is illegal. The 
only mention of resin purchasing in the complaint charges The Coca-Cola Company with purchasing, ""through an entity which it 
effectively controls, PET materials for Southeastern in combination with purchases for Coke's own operations, affording 
Southeastern an advantage in the purchase of PET materials which it otherwise would not enjoy."" Complaint at para. 36, 51(d). 
Sewell contends that Coke is deemed to have ""participated"" through its ownership interest in one of the entities. However, the 
parties stipulated (Stip. A para. 30) that The Coca-Cola Company did not participate in the discussions in which the agreement 
to negotiate resin purchases was reached or in any ensuing negotiations for the purchase of resin on behalf of any of these 
three entities. In the May 6, 1988, order, the court denied plaintiff's motion to declare the joint resin purchasing agreement to be illegal per se 
under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Docket No. 146. On January 17, 1989, Sewell moved that the court clarify the May 6, 1988, 
order as it related to Sewell's per se resin price-fixing claim. Docket No. 184. This motion was heard on March 1, 1989. Since the 
court was preparing to try this action for six weeks, the court decided that it would hear plaintiff's evidence at trial under the rule 
of reason approach and address the legal issues on a motion for directed verdict. See Docket No. 196 (March 3, 1989, order). 
By letter to the court dated March 6, 1989, defendants objected to that ruling. Plaintiff never moved to amend the complaint in order to allege that the joint resin purchasing agreement was illegal. Because 
resin sellers would be more directly injured by an illegal joint purchasing arrangement than other resin buyers, plaintiff may not 
have standing to pursue such a claim. See Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 111 n.6, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427, 107 
S. Ct. 484 (1986). More importantly, joint purchasing arrangements are not illegal unless the buyers collectively possess market 
power. Plaintiff has failed to set forth any facts (1) delineating the relevant product or geographic market and (2) demonstrating 
that the three entities collectively possessed market power in the relevant market. Disregarding what appear to be numerous 
valid objections by defendants, the only evidence offered by plaintiff in support of this ""claim"" simply demonstrates that after joint 
negotiations began, Southeastern obtained a lower price from a single supplier (American Hoechst) for a different type of resin 
than Sewell purchased from the same supplier from October, 1985, through February, 1986. Docket No. 235, Tab 7. Assuming 
that Sewell had standing to assert and had properly asserted a claim about the joint resin purchasing agreement, this proof is 
simply inadequate to support Sewell's ""claim."" "

773,1," Some general definitions are required to make sense of the proposition which follows. Accordingly, the court takes judicial 
notice of the McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms (4th ed. 1989) (hereinafter ""MHD"")."
773,2," Definitions relating to ""capacitor"" A capacitor is ""[a] device which consists essentially of two conductors (such as parallel metal plates) insulated from each other 
by a dielectric and which . . . blocks the flow of direct current, and permits the flow of alternating current to a degree dependent 
on the capacitor's capacitance and the current frequency."" MHD 289. See also Tr. 8-9. The ""dielectric"" material separating the capacitor's conductors is ""a material which is an electrical insulator or in which an electric 
field can be sustained with a minimum dissipation of power."" MHD 531. The ""capacitance"" of a capacitor is ""[t]he ratio of the charge on one of the conductors (there being an equal and opposite charge 
on the other conductor) to the potential difference between the conductors."" MHD 288. Capacitance is a function of the surface 
area of the capacitor's electrodes and the thickness and composition of the dielectric sandwiched between the electrodes. Tr. 9-
12. Finally, the term ""potential difference"" refers to the ""the work which must be done [between any two points] to move a unit 
charge from one point to the other."" MHD 1476."
773,3," Definitions relating to ""strip-line circuit"" A strip-line circuit is ""a circuit in which one or more strip transmission lines serve as filters or other circuit components."" MHD 
1839. A strip transmission line is ""[a] microwave transmission line consisting of a thin, narrow, rectangular metal strip that is supported 
above a ground-plane conductor or between two wide ground-plane conductors and is usually separated from them by a "
774,," dielectric material."" MHD 1839 (bracketed numbers added). Where the metal strip is between two ground planes, but is only 
separated from the upper ground plane by air, it is sometimes known as a ""microstrip."" Tr. 15, 19-20. DX 51, fig. 5. A ""microwave"" is ""[a]n electromagnetic wave which has a wavelength between about 0.3 and 30 centimeters, corresponding to 
frequencies of 1-100 gigahertz; however, there are no sharp boundaries distinguishing microwaves from infrared and radio 
waves."" MHD 1199. At trial, witness David A. Lupfer defined microwaves as having frequencies greater than 300 to 500 
megahertz. Tr. 25-26."
774,4," These disturbances are caused by impedance discontinuities between the capacitor and the strip-line. Impedance is ""[t]he total 
opposition that a circuit presents to an alternating current[.]"" MHD 614. See also Tr. 28-29."
774,5," U.S. Patent Number 4,114,120."
774,6," ATC's counterclaim for a declaration of patent invalidity was rendered moot by this court's decision finding the patent invalid, 
and ATC withdrew its conspiracy claim under § 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1, at the end of trial after DLI pointed out that 
no conspirators had been identified. Tr. 488-89. Since the same weakness would doom ATC's § 2 claim insofar as it alleges a 
conspiracy to monopolize (see ATC's antitrust counterclaim para. 18), that aspect of the § 2 claim also is deemed to have been 
withdrawn."
774,7," ATC's antitrust counterclaim incorporates by reference 6(e) of the Answer, stating that DLI obtained the patent through fraud. 
Furthermore, ATC's post-trial memorandum of law relies upon the Walker Process case. Thus, this is a Walker Process claim, 
and not a claim founded on: "
775,," (1) the filing of a patent infringement suit in bad faith but without knowledge of fraudulent patent procurement. Handgards, Inc. v. 
Ethicon, Inc., 601 F.2d 986 (9th Cir 1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1025 (1980); Lyle/Carlstrom Associates, Inc. v. Manhattan 
Store Interiors, Inc., No. CV 85-4347 (E.D.N.Y. April 22, 1986). (2) good faith prosecution of a valid patent ""in furtherance and as an integral part of a plan to violate the antitrust laws."" 
Handgards, 601 F.2d at 994 (citation omitted). (3) ""a pattern of baseless, repetitive litigation designed to prevent meaningful access to an adjudicatory tribunal."" Id., 601 F.2d at 
995; California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508 (1972). See Tr. 122, 125-26 (ATC's counsel states that ATC's counterclaims depend upon this court's previous determination that the 
patent was invalid). "
777,8," This resolution of ATC's Walker Process claim makes it unnecessary to consider whether ATC meets the special requirements 
for receiving treble damages under § 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15. See Volvo North America Corp. v. Men's International 
Professional Tennis Council, 857 F.2d 55, 66 (2d Cir. 1988)."
777,9," ATC's New York common law counterclaim states, in relevant part:"
777,22," . Plaintiff has unfairly competed with defendant in the manufacture, distribution and sale of capacitors by unlawful interfering 
with the business relationship between defendant and others not a party to this Civil Action, all to the damage of defendant."
777,23," . Plaintiff has unfairly competed with defendant in the manufacture, distribution and sale of capacitors by abusing the judicial 
process in the institution of this civil action for infringement of said Letters Patent No. 4,114,120 with knowledge of the lack of 
infringement by defendant and the unenforceability and invalidity thereof, all to the damage of defendant. Id. (emphasis added)."
777,10," Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(a) HN7[
] states that a counterclaim is compulsory ""if it arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is 
the subject matter of the opposing party's claim and does not require for its adjudication the presence of third parties of whom 
the court cannot acquire jurisdiction."""
777,11," Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(b) HN8[
] states that a counterclaim is permissive if it does ""not aris[e] out of the transaction or occurrence 
that is the subject matter of the opposing party's claim."" "
778,12," This claim ""has been referred to variously . . . as tortious interference with: prospective economic advantage, beneficial 
business relations, prospective business advantage, and business or economic relations. Regardless of the appellation 
employed, the elements necessary to establish such a claim remain constant."" PPX Enterprises, Inc. v. Audiofidelity Enterprises, 
Inc., 818 F.2d 266, 269 (2d Cir. 1987). "
779,13," New York courts recognize a cause of action for unfair competition based upon ""[t]he spreading of false, misleading and 
dishonest statements to the customers of a business competitor for the purpose of injuring the latter in its business and 
deceiving its customers[.]"" Black v. Judelsohn, 251 A.D. 559, 562, 296 N.Y.S. 860, 864 (1st Dep't 1937). Thus, New York courts 
have held that a cause of action for unfair competition existed where a defendant informed a competitor's customers that the 
competitor was infringing defendant's patent, even though the defendant knew the patent was void. Id., 251 A.D. at 561-62; 
Zenie v. Miskend, 245 A.D. 634, 284 N.Y.S. 63 (1st Dep't 1935), aff'd, 270 N.Y. 636, 1 N.E.2d 367 (1936); American Cyanamid 
Co. v. Power Conversion, Inc., 71 Misc.2d 213, 217-18, 336 N.Y.S.2d 6, 12 (Sup.Ct. Westchester Co. 1972). However, institution of a patent infringement suit without probable cause does not give rise to an action for unfair competition. 
Rather, such conduct provides a cause of action for malicious prosecution Black v. Judelsohn, 251 A.D. at 562-63, 296 N.Y.S. at 
865. Nothing in ATC's third counterclaim suggests that ATC intends to plead a cause of action for malicious prosecution; and, 
even assuming that ATC intended to so plead, this court lacks jurisdiction to entertain the claim for reasons Previously stated. "
780,14," 35 U.S.C. § 285 states, in its entirety: HN16[
] The court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party."
780,15," Lupfer testified at trial that he believed ATC was infringing upon the patent because ATC's literature displayed a test fixture for 
measuring capacitance. Tr. 60-61, 135-37. DLI has offered no explanation of how the sale of such a fixture could have directly 
infringed the patent. "
781,16," Of course, ATC would have incurred some legal expenses prior to September 15, 1980 even if DLI had not brought a direct 
infringement claim. However, it would be almost impossible to separate work done on the direct infringement claim from other 
work. Moreover, fairness and logic do not require such an apportionment. The period of time covered by this fee award -- from the date 
the suit was filed, August 29, 1979, to the date summary judgment was granted on the direct infringement claim, September 15, 
1980 -- covers less than thirteen months out of the nearly three years during which DLI's claims were litigated. Therefore, much 
of the work done in connection with claims other than direct infringement probably will not be captured by this award. Moreover, 
ATC prevailed on every claim brought by DLI. Courts have awarded fees under § 285 in connection with unsuccessful defenses 
which ""facilitated disposition of the litigation by revealing the cardinal issues,"" Chromalloy American Corp. v. Alloy Surfaces Co., 
353 F. Supp. 429, 433 (D.Del. 1973), and in connection with alternative defenses not reached by the court.  Mathis v. Spears, 
857 F.2d 749, 756 (Fed. Cir. 1988). A fortiori, the court feels justified in granting a fee award which captures some work on 
claims which may or may not have been ""exceptional"" under § 285 but which, like the ""exceptional"" claim, were actually resolved 
in ATC's favor. "
795,1," Over the course of the next year-and-a-half, about 20 GM dealers began similar efforts to market the GMPP nationwide. See 
Perlberg Affidavit Exhibit B, at P-190. "
799,2," It is worth noting that even if the plaintiff had provided sufficient evidence of a conspiracy, it is unlikely that the second condition 
has been met. Because of GM's low percentage of market share of sales of the GMPP, discussed in Part I(B), infra, it is unlikely 
that an agreement to restrict sales in the Memphis Zone would have ""adverse, anti-competitive"" effects within the relevant 
market. "
802,3," Unreasonable, capricious or bad faith actions may, in contrast, render GM liable under other legal theories. See infra Parts III-
V. "
805,4," Regency argued that GM's position that sales of the GMPP were prohibited to customers with over 12,000 miles or 12 months 
on the car was (1) contrary to the Administration Guide and (2) designed to inhibit Regency's sales efforts. Although Regency 
alleges that sales beyond 12/12 were routinely approved prior to 1985, the 1985 Administration Guide provides that such sales 
could be approved by the dealer's zone office under ""unique circumstances."" Id. at 3. Statistics on how many Plan sales of the 
type were approved by GM in a given year are not provided in the record. However, GM's position does not appear to constitute 
a major change in the administration of the program. In addition, the change applied to sales of the GMPP by all dealerships, not 
just Regency."
805,5," The following are excerpts from letters written to GM from angry customers who received Regency's postcard in the mail: I did not appreciate receiving information in the mail depicting there is an emergency situation requiring my immediate 
attention, only to receive a 'sales pitch' from one of your dealers regarding a warranty plan I have already purchased. The notice looks 'very official' and can easily be mistaken for a recall notice. Concerned about my family's safety, I 
immediately contacted the phone number as directed in the postcard, and found out very quickly that the campaign was 
nothing more than a sales pitch. I am outraged that General Motors would send a card that I, perhaps naively, believed was in regard to a recall or some 
other important matter. "
806,," Believe me at this point I'm not decided whether to put this matter in the hands of my attorney for misrepresentation or just 
resolve to stop buying General Motors cars!!! Thomas Affidavit Exhibit D. "
807,6," The parties nonetheless remain in dispute as to whether GM, in the modification and execution of its chargeback procedures, 
violated its statutory or common law obligation to act in good faith. See infra Parts III-V. "
809,7," See Twin City Sportservice, Inc. v. Charles O. Finley & Co., 676 F.2d 1291, 1300-01, 1309 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S.

American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U.S. 781, 789, 66 S. Ct. 1125, 1129, 90 L. Ed. 1575 (1946); V. & L. Cicione, Inc. v. 
C. Schmidt & Sons, Inc., 403 F. Supp. 643, 651 (E.D. Pa. 1975), aff'd without opinion, 565 F.2d 154 (3d Cir. 1977). "
810,9," In those counts Regency also alleges violations of 15 U.S.C. §§ 13 & 13a. The parties have not directly addressed the viability 
of those claims. Since they are likewise unsupported by the record, however, GM is similarly entitled to summary judgment on 
those claims. "
821,1," Plaintiffs insist that our inquiry into dismissal of the Sherman Act § 1 claim should focus on the five factor test for antitrust 
standing outlined by the Supreme Court in Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. California State Council of Carpenters, 
459 U.S. 519, 545, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723, 103 S. Ct. 897 (1983). The focus of the standing inquiry is whether a particular plaintiff is a 
proper party to seek redress under Clayton Act § 4, 15 U.S.C. § 15(a) (1982), for a violation of the antitrust laws. Exhibitors' 
Serv., Inc. v. American Multi-Cinema, Inc., 788 F.2d 574, 577-78 (9th Cir. 1986). However, whether plaintiffs would meet the 
five-factor standing test of Associated Gen. Contractors is irrelevant to this appeal. By holding that injury to competition was 
inadequately pleaded, the district court determined that no violation of the antitrust laws was stated. Thus, no party could sue on 
the basis of the allegations in the amended complaint. "
826,1," Chrysler replacement parts are parts which are actually manufactured by Chrysler or by its licensees from Chrysler dies and 
fixtures. For purposes of this opinion, all such parts shall be referred to as ""Chrysler manufactured parts."" "
827,2," See Beach v. Viking Sewing Mach. Co., 784 F.2d 746, 750 (6th Cir. 1986)(no concerted activity existed where manufacturer 
merely enforced ""uniform policy"" which it unilaterally formulated). See also Dunnivant v. Bi-State Auto Parts, 851 F.2d 1575, 
1580 (11th Cir. 1988)(where manufacturer had independent motivation for terminating plaintiff distributor and did not contact 
competitor of plaintiff until after it had reached its decision, no antitrust conspiracy was alleged); Culberson, Inc. v. Interstate 
Elec. Co., 821 F.2d 1092, 1094 (5th Cir. 1987)(no conspiracy existed where manufacturer formulated policy before it had 
contacts with dealers). "
838,1," The difficulty that CIG and Natural faced with the minimum purchase obligation was not unique. Minimum purchase obligations 
in gas contracts became a problem for the industry in the early 1980's, as a nationwide gas surplus forced many purchasers to 
curtail their takes. The huge liability incurred by purchasers forced FERC to take action on two procedural levels. First, FERC 
considered purchasers' objections to minimum purchase requirements on a case by case basis and modified service agreement 
provisions where necessary. Second, because minimum purchase obligations were widespread in the natural gas industry, 
FERC issued general orders that modified certain provisions in all gas contracts. Thus, the conflict between CIG and Natural 
was just a small part of a significant problem which required FERC's continued attention."
838,2," For purposes of this opinion we are using the term ""minimum purchase obligation"" to refer to contract terms which seek to 
insure that gas buyers purchase a minimum volume of gas. These provisions are sometimes called ""take or pay,"" ""minimum bill,"" 
or ""minimum take"" provisions. Although the precise details or mechanisms of these provisions might differ, they have similar 
effects."
838,3," Section 2 of the Service Agreement entitled ""POINTS OF DELIVERY, MAXIMUM DAILY VOLUME OBLIGATIONS, AND 
PRESSURES"" includes Natural's daily purchase obligation. It states: Variations in daily takes may be made at Buyer's election at H-1 delivery points to meet its varying load conditions, 
however, Buyer shall not request total daily volumes on any day hereunder less than 90 percent of the General Daily 
Entitlement."
838,4," Section 4 entitled ""MINIMUM BILL"" states, in relevant part: The minimum bill shall be . . . determined by multiplying the Total Annual Entitlement by a factor of 90 percent, such volume 
hereinafter referred to as ""Minimum Volume."" . . . In the event the Buyer's actual purchases for the fiscal year are less than 
the Minimum Volume, then any deficiency shall be billed at the unit fixed cost component under Rate Schedule F-1. . . . (Emphasis added.)"
838,5," Fixed costs are costs which CIG must incur regardless of the volume of gas it sells. The fixed cost component of the 
commodity charge also includes a sum representing profits on CIG's operations. The major nonfixed (variable) cost, which CIG 
was forced to eliminate from the rate it could charge Natural, was the cost of gas."
838,6," On the same day, FERC issued Order No. 380 which required gas sellers to modify their minimum bill provisions to collect only 
fixed costs for unpurchased gas. "
839,7," FERC explained that allowing CIG to collect only F-1 fixed costs for the more expensive H-1 gas would give CIG a strong 
incentive to sell H-1 gas instead of merely collecting fees for undelivered gas."
839,8," Since Order No. 380-C was a general order, it did not specify the precise value of the fixed cost CIG, or any other sellers, could 
collect for unsold gas. "
840,9," The Court in Kalo Brick & Tile emphasized that the ""commission has actually addressed the matters [the customer] wishes to 
raise in state court."" 450 U.S. at 327. The Court reserved the question of whether ""a state court suit is barred when the 
commission is empowered to rule on the underlying issues."" Id. In this case, FERC was not explicitly confronted with the 
question of whether Natural's motive for not purchasing gas would be relevant to the rate CIG could collect for that gas. "
841,10," The district court did not ask the jury to award damages separately for breach of Section 2 of the Service Agreement and 
breach of the contractual obligation of good faith and fair dealing. This is troubling because we cannot determine what damages, 
if any, the jury intended to award for each breach. Further, the jury incorrectly found that Natural breached its obligation to purchase gas under Section 2 of the Service 
Agreement. Having found that Natural deliberately breached the Service Agreement by deciding not to purchase gas, it is 
difficult to see how the jury could objectively consider the question of whether Natural acted in good faith. Thus, even if we were to find that the bad faith claim was not preempted, we would have to order a new trial. First, the jury would 
have to evaluate CIG's bad faith claim in light of the fact that Natural did not breach Section 2 of the Service Agreement. 
Second, even if the jury still found that Natural breached its contractual obligation of good faith and fair dealing, it would have to 
determine the appropriate damages for this breach."
841,11," Significantly, one seller challenged FERC's decision alleging that if buyers were permitted to sue based upon a seller's 
negligent or willful misconduct, some state courts might conclude that actions for ""breach of a good faith duty"" were not 
preempted. United Gas Pipe Line, 824 F.2d at 428. The Fifth Circuit rejected the suggestion that state courts could interpret 
FERC orders which allowed actions based upon negligence to permit actions for ""breach of a good faith duty."" Thus, at least one "
842,," other court has interpreted FERC orders prohibiting suits based upon breach of contract to also forbid suits based upon breach 
of the contractual obligation of good faith and fair dealing."
842,12," Natural also asserts the award of $ 8,000,839 in restitutionary damages was inappropriate. It argues that restitutionary 
damages are unavailable for tortious interference claims under Section 766A of the Restatement. While it cites one case to this "

§ 6, at 465 (1973)."
843,13," Natural also asserted an antitrust counterclaim against CIG. Natural alleged that CIG monopolized or attempted to monopolize 
the purchase of Wyoming natural gas by intervening and threatening to intervene in FERC proceedings in which CIG's 
competitors proposed building new pipelines leading out of Wyoming. The district court ruled that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine 
barred evidence of CIG's activities before FERC. HN3[
] The Noerr-Pennington doctrine requires that attempts to influence the government, including attempts to influence 
administrative agencies, be exempt from attack under the Sherman Act. California Motor Transp. Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 
U.S. 508, 511-12, 30 L. Ed. 2d 642, 92 S. Ct. 609 (1972); Bright v. Moss Ambulance Serv., Inc., 824 F.2d 819 (10th Cir. 1987). 
We agree with the district court that nothing in CIG's activities before FERC so corrupts the judicial or administrative process that 
those activities amount to a sham and therefore are exempt from the Noerr-Pennington doctrine.  Hydro-Tech Corp. v. 
Sundstrand Corp., 673 F.2d 1171, 1176-77 & n. 7 (10th Cir. 1982)."
843,14," It is important to distinguish between NGPL-Trailblazer, one of the defendants, and the Trailblazer System. The Trailblazer 
System is a series of three separately owned and operated pipelines joined end-to-end which stretches from Wyoming to 
Nebraska. When built in 1982, the Trailblazer System greatly expanded the capacity of producers to move their gas from 
Wyoming to eastern markets. The westernmost segment of the Trailblazer System, Overthrust, is owned by CIG and Natural, as 
well as four other companies. The middle segment, WIC, is owned by CIG alone. The easternmost and longest segment of the 
system, Trailblazer, is owned jointly by NGPL-Trailblazer and two other companies. The Trailblazer System, the alleged 
beneficiary of Natural's predatory conduct, is not even a party to this case."
843,15," The difficulty with punishing a firm for attempting to create a monopoly for a third party which does not act as a single entity, is 
that the threat to competition after the monopoly is achieved is obscure. In a more typical case in which a firm is attempting, 
through unfair means, to gain control of a market for itself, one can be quite certain the firm will not hesitate to exercise its newly 
acquired monopoly power. In this case, the alleged monopolist's (Natural's) conduct says little about its intended beneficiary's 
(the Trailblazer System's) proclivity or ability to monopolize. Section 2 of the Sherman Act does not punish the mere possession 
of monopoly power. Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States, 221 U.S. 1, 62, 55 L. Ed. 619, 31 S. Ct. 502 (1911). "
844,16," Gas can be sold on either a firm or interruptible basis. Firm sales guarantee the purchaser that he will receive the volumes of 
gas he reserves, while interruptible sales only guarantee deliveries if customers with higher priority do not demand the gas. 
Since CIG had a firm obligation to sell gas to Natural, CIG could only offer to sell interruptible service to new customers."
844,17," Several commentators have noted approvingly that the dangerous probability of success element of the attempt to monopolize 
offense prevents courts from expanding the Sherman Act into a broad unfair competition statute. For instance, Handler & Steuer 
state: There is ample reason for excluding single-firm behavior from the serious penalties of the antitrust laws when no dangerous 
probability of monopolization exists. When one firm monopolizes an economically significant market or threatens such a 
monopoly, competition is immediately and seriously jeopardized. It was largely to combat this peril that section 2 of the 
Sherman Act was passed, fortified with the formidable deterrent of treble damages and criminal penalties. Short of this 
situation, however, single firm behavior does not present so significant a threat to competition as to warrant such harsh 
consequences.  Handler & Steuer, Attempts to Monopolize and No Fault Monopolization, 129 U.Pa.L.Rev. 125, 175 (1980) (footnote omitted); 
see also 3 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law para. 833 (1978) (hereinafter Areeda & Turner); cf. Cooper, Attempts and 
Monopolization: A Mildly Expansionary Answer to the Prophylactic Riddle of Section Two, 72 Mich.L.Rev. 373, 454-55 (1974) 
(warning against expansion of the attempt provision into an unfair competition statute); but see Blecher, Attempt to Monopolize 
Under Section 2 of the Sherman Act: ""Dangerous Probability"" of Monopolization Within the ""Relevant Market,"" 38 
Geo.Wash.L.Rev. 215, 222 (1969); Note, Attempt to Monopolize Under the Sherman Act: Defendant's Market Power as a 
Requisite to a Prima Facie Case, 73 Colum.L.Rev. 1451, 1459-61 (1973). "
845,18," While the Supreme Court has refused to specify a minimum market share necessary to indicate a defendant has monopoly 
power, lower courts generally require a minimum market share of between 70% and 80%. 2 E. Kintner, Federal Antitrust Law § 
12.6 (1980); Areeda & Turner, para. 803."
845,19," The record does not clearly disclose how much of the Trailblazer System's market share gain reflected increased 
transportation volumes because CIG was unavailable as a competitor, and how much the market share gain simply resulted 
from the Trailblazer System's constant sales level in comparison with CIG's sales losses. "
846,20," We agree with the proposition that it is no defense to an attempted monopolization charge that the defendant's attempt to 
monopolize proved to be unsuccessful.  United States v. American Airlines, Inc., 743 F.2d 1114, 1119 (5th Cir. 1984). Simply 
because a plan fails to succeed does not mean there was no probability that it could have succeeded. A flipped coin which lands 
heads still had a 50% chance of landing tails before it was flipped. The capacity of the defendant to monopolize must be 
evaluated at the commencement of the predatory scheme. We also note our holding in this case does not require that in every instance where a party intends to eliminate a competitor 
through unfair means, the elimination of the competitor must give the predator a monopolistic market share. For instance, when 
a party with a substantial market share eliminates a smaller competitor through economic coercion, increased market power will 
give it even greater coercive power to eliminate other competitors. There is no reason to wait until the predator attacks a 
competitor that would put it just over the brink of monopolization before it can be stopped. See Note, Attempt to Monopolize 
Under The Sherman Act: Defendants Market Power as a Requisite to a Prima Facie Case, 73 Colum.L.Rev. 1451, 1462-63 
(1973). In this case, Natural sought to take advantage of a unique opportunity its contract afforded to temporarily harm a competitor of 
an entity in which it had an economic stake. Unlike the ordinary situation in which a firm's market share is crucial to the firm's 
ability to engage in predatory conduct and every predatory act makes future predation easier, Natural's ability to engage in 
predatory conduct would not be enhanced by conferring market share upon the Trailblazer System."
846,21," Although most courts do not explicitly discuss the persistence of a firm's ability to charge supracompetitive prices as a 
measure of a firm's market power, courts indirectly consider the potential longevity of supracompetitive pricing whenever they 
use market share to evaluate the degree of market power. HN10[
] Market share statistics are a useful measure of market 
power, in large part, because they indicate the relative durability of supracompetitive pricing capacity. The greater a firm's market 
share, the longer it will be able to charge monopoly prices because it will take longer for its small competitors to increase their 
output enough to discipline prices. See H. Hovencamp, Economics and Federal Antitrust Law § 3.1, at 58 (1985). HN11[
] The durability of a firm's ability to charge supracompetitive prices also underlies another factor used to evaluate the 
degree of market power. Barriers to entry are often used by courts to determine whether an alleged monopolist has sufficient 
market power for purposes of the monopolization offense. 2 E. Kintner, Federal Antitrust Law § 12.9 (1980). Barriers to entry 
are market characteristics which make it difficult or time-consuming for new firms to enter a market. For instance, if market entry 
requires the construction of large manufacturing plants, Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 119, 93 L. Ed. 2d 
427, 107 S. Ct. 484 (1986), or obtaining governmental approval to enter the market, United States v. Marine Bancorporation, 
Inc., 418 U.S. 602, 628-29, 41 L. Ed. 2d 978, 94 S. Ct. 2856 (1974), the market is said to have high barriers to entry. Often 
courts refuse to find a sufficient degree of market power for the monopolization offense when they determine that a market has 
low barriers to entry. See, e.g., Ball Memorial Hosp., 784 F.2d at 1335. While a firm may have the capacity to charge 
supracompetitive prices in a market with low barriers to entry, that capacity is likely to be temporary. "
847,22," Some courts and commentators label the degree of market power necessary for the monopolization offense as ""monopoly 
power."" See L. Sullivan, Antitrust § 22, at 75 (1977) (""Monopoly power can be distinguished from a lesser amount of market 
power only in degree.""); Dimmitt Agri Indus., Inc. v. CPC Int'l, Inc., 679 F.2d 516, 529 (5th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 
1082, 76 L. Ed. 2d 344, 103 S. Ct. 1770 (1983). One commentator has suggested that in the future courts might more precisely 
define monopoly power by ""focus[ing] on the permanence of market power, with mere market power suggesting that 
supranormal profits will be quickly eroded by new entry, and monopoly power suggesting significantly greater insulation from the 
long-run forces of entry."" G. Hay, Single Firm Conduct, 57 Antitrust L.J. 75, 81 (1988) (emphasis added). While we do not adopt 
this commentator's nomenclature, we do agree with his assertion that market power must be persistent to make a firm a 
monopolist for purposes of the antitrust laws."
847,23," A suggestion that unidentified market forces will eventually correct supracompetitive pricing will not suffice to show that market 
power will be temporary. Only when an alleged monopolist faces substantial competition from a known competitor who will enter 
the market in a definite period of time, ought courts to decline to find sufficient market power to satisfy the requirement for the 
monopolization offense.  Williamsburg Wax Museum, 810 F.2d at 252 (defendant did not have monopoly in the wax figure 
market because a known competitor could, within a year, begin to deliver wax figures); Metro Mobile CTS, 661 F. Supp. at 1523-
24 (defendant did not possess monopoly power for purposes of the monopolization or attempted monopolization offense even 
though it controlled 100% of the market because a known competitor had both the plans and capacity to enter the market within 
three years). Cf. Landes & Posner, Market Power in Antitrust Cases, 94 Harv.L.Rev.937, 950, n. 28 (1981) (difficulty in 
identifying potential competitors forces courts to assume that a firm's ability to charge monopoly prices will be persistent)."
847,24," The Service Agreement was to expire in 1989. Thus, the Trailblazer System would be free from competition for a longer period 
of time than the defendants in either Williamsburg Wax Museum (1 year) or Metro Mobile CTS (3 years). Yet, the actual number 
of years that the Trailblazer System would be free from competition from CIG is not the deciding factor in this case. Rather the 
certainty that the market will return to the status quo at a predetermined date and the fact that the Trailblazer System has no 
power to prevent the erosion of its market share, convince us that the market implications of Natural's conduct are not the 
subject of the antitrust laws."
847,25," There is no suggestion in the record that Natural was in danger of driving CIG completely out of the transportation business 
before the expiration of the Service Agreement. Indeed, considering CIG's financial resources and record profitability during 
Natural's tie-up, it is unlikely that Natural could have completely excluded CIG. By attacking CIG, Natural could not alter the 
competitive structure of the industry which is based on a permanent superstructure. See Cargill v. Monfort, 479 U.S. at 119, n. 
15."
847,26," One treatise has stressed that courts ought to take a long-run view when evaluating allegedly anticompetitive conduct. In 
attempting to distinguish between conduct that should be addressed by the antitrust laws and conduct which should be regulated 
by tort law, Professors Areeda and Turner state: Most important, is our doubt that the torts and other activities considered in this paragraph would very often seriously impair 
the competitive opportunities of rivals in any significant or permanent way. We must beware of the inclination to condemn a "
848,," monopolist on the basis of antisocial behavior that could possibly give him an improper advantage in the market. . . . The 
antitrust court must, therefore, insist on . . . significant and more-than-temporary harmful effects on competition. Areeda & Turner, para. 737b (emphasis added). "
851,1," Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides in pertinent part: Every contract, combination . . . or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States . . . is declared to 
be illegal. "
856,1," First Comics claims that World Color Press is the only printer to use the letterpress method, while Judge Duff, in his 
memorandum opinion of June 16, 1988, referred to other comic book printers, but did not specify whether these other printers 
also employed the letterpress method."
856,2, These figures are according to First Comics' damage expert. 
857,3," The Federal Trade Commission, however, has argued for an analysis that accounts for the practical effects of the challenged 
activity in light of the purpose and structure of the Act, ""rather than becoming preoccupied with metaphysical considerations 
about what is or is not a tangible product."" In the Matter of the Times Mirror Co., 92 F.T.C. 230, 233 (1978) (which held that 
newspaper advertising is within the ambit of Robinson-Patman; the case was later settled and dismissed). See also Kinter, 
Federal Antitrust Law: The Robinson-Patman Act 233 (1983) (discussing Times Mirror). But see Rowe, Price Discrimination 
Under the Robinson-Patman Act 61-62 (1962) (arguing in favor of the Commission's earlier opinion that newspaper advertising 
is not within Act and citing statutory history limiting Act to goods); Von Kalinowski, 4 Antitrust Laws and Trade Regulation § 
24.05 (1988 ed.) (collecting authorities)."
857,4," The dominant nature examination was first undertaken by the Sixth Circuit in General Shale Products v. Struck Construction 
Co., 132 F.2d 425 (6th Cir. 1942), certiorari denied, 318 U.S. 780, 87 L. Ed. 1148, 63 S. Ct. 857 (1945). In Shale, the Sixth 
Circuit determined that a construction contract did not include a sale of commodities within the meaning of the Robinson-Patman 
Act even though the contract listed separately the cost of the bricks and other tangible items to be supplied. See May 
Department Store v. Graphic Process Co., 637 F.2d 1211, 1215 (9th Cir. 1980). "
858,5," The court listed as significant the fact that May did not provide Graphic with any tangible ingredients. The intangible ingredient, artwork, is returned to May with a tangible product, a velox. Graphic 
has not produced any comparison between the cost of the physical components of a velox and the price charged May. 
There is no evidence that Graphic billed May separately for labor. We find, therefore, that summary judgment was 
improperly granted. We do not hold, however, that the transactions involved in this dispute were sales of goods. The 
plaintiff has the burden of proving this element at trial. "
858,637," F.2d at 1216. Although factual findings may clarify the matter, we are unconvinced that the entire issue -- whether the 
transaction was a sale of commodities -- properly belongs before a trier of fact. Rather it is for the court to decide if a given 
transaction is within the meaning of a statutory term. See Freeman, 505 F.2d at 531 n. 10. Judge Skopil dissented from the decision to reverse summary judgment, observing that ""Graphic does nothing more than 
transform May's artwork into an almost identical image. The production of a tangible item is only incidental to the service 
provided by Graphic."" Id. at 1217. "
859,6," This also relates to the Robinson-Patman Act's requirement that the commodities sold be of like grade and quality. Since the 
finished First Comics comic books are of no use to any other publisher, it is a tenuous suggestion that printed comic books, such 
as Marvel and First Comics comic books, are of like grade and quality simply because they are printed to the same 
specifications. See Kinter, Federal Antitrust Law: Robinson-Patman Act 232-233 (1983) (""it makes sense to focus principally on 
the perception of the ultimate consumer . . . if consumers view the products as being dissimilar, and prefer one or the other even 
if the prices are equal, then Robinson-Patman ought to play no role"") (emphasis in original); Vawter, Jurisdiction, Commerce and 
Exemptions; Sales, Commodities and Like Grade and Quality Requirements, 53 Antitrust L.J. 847, 860 n. 31 (1985). "
860,7," Since a substantial federal question was presented by this case and a great many judicial resources have already been 
expended, jurisdiction is proper under pendent jurisdiction. "
861,8," Of those cases that did not require consumer injury, most have either involved consumer plaintiffs or conduct from which 
consumer injury could readily be inferred. E.g., Haroco, supra (plaintiffs were commercial borrowers and alleged deceptive 
activity involved broad segment of bank's activities); M & W Gear, supra (consumer injury easily inferred in false advertising suit 
between competitors); Duncavage, supra (tenant was held consumer under Consumer Fraud Act); Tague, supra (plaintiff was 
consumer complaining about misconduct in sale of car); see also Jays Foods, 664 F. Supp. at 369; Newman-Green, 590 F. 
Supp. at 1087. "
863,9," First Comics contends, without rebuttal by World Color Press, that Judge Duff included within the $ 236,705 reduction a claim 
of $ 5,370 that the jury had already rejected (Br. 18 n. 12). If true, that $ 5,370 was not a component of the original damages 
award as assessed by the jury and should not have been offset. On remand a determination should be made as to whether the $ 
236,705 reduction did indeed include this already rejected claim."
863,10, But see note 9 supra. 
865,1," Issues of liability and injunctive relief were severed to be tried separately, pursuant to Rule 42 of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure. "
866,2," Ball's claim for fraud was dismissed for failure to state a claim. See Cartwright v. Colorado Bank of Walsh, Inc., 658 F.Supp. 
240, 247 (D.Colo. 1987); Saine v. A.I.A., Inc., 582 F.Supp. 1299, 1308 (D.Colo. 1984); Strong v. Retail Credit Company, 38 
Colo. App. 125, 552 P.2d 1025 (Colo. App. 1976); Mead & Mount Construction Co. v. Fox Metal Indus., Inc., 511 P.2d 509, 510 
(Colo.App. 1973). "
867,3," The  [*6] Noerr-Pennington doctrine holds that genuine attempts to influence the government are immune from Sherman Act 
antitrust liability by the overriding protection of the First Amendment. California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 
U.S. 508, 510-12, 92 S. Ct. 609, 30 L. Ed. 2d 642 (1971). "
871,4," Normally, upon proof of the first two factors, the burden shifts to the challenger to patentability to show that commercial 
success was due to extraneous factors like advertising, brand identification, or superior workmanship. Demaco Corp. v. F.Von 
Langsdorff Licensing, Ltd., 851 F.2d 1387, 1392-93 (Fed. Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 956, 109 S. Ct. 395, 102 L. Ed. 2d 383 
(1988). Thus it would appear that in the context of a reexamination proceeding, the burden of attributing success to extraneous 
 [*23] factors would be on the requester in its reply. In this regard, our view of the law reexamination differs from that of the 
examiner, who held Ball accountable for failing to demonstrate that success was attributable to advertising. See Id., at 1393. 
Nonetheless, our analysis in this case focuses on the type of evidence which would have material to this examiner. See infra. "
872,5, There are one million microinches in an inch. There are two hundred fifty angstroms in a microinch. 
873,6," Our analysis focuses upon malice and causation rather than the truth or falsity of Mr. Kujawa's statements to the PTO for two 
reasons. First, some of the evidence involves the proprietary design information of defendants' customers,  [*29] companies who 
are not parties to the litigation. Second, we refrain from finding one way or the other in regard to defendants' claims of 
noninfringement. On two occasions, we denied as untimely defendants' motions to bring counterclaims out of time and to stay 
litigation on the complaint pending determination of their claims of invalidity and non-infringement against the Roller patent. See 
Proctor & Gamble v. Nabisco Brands. Inc., 711 F.Supp. 759, 776-77 (D.Del. 1989). The patent itself is evidence of personal 
property and plaintiff's prima facie case did not include proof that the patent was valid. See Schenck v. Nortron Corp.., 713 F.2d 
782, 784 (Fed.Cir. 1983). The patent claims at issue in this litigation may still be preserved. While evidence analogous to 
evidence of infringement made up a part of plaintiff's case, our ruling today in no way reflects a determination that defendants' 
products do or do not infringe on claims 1 and 5 of the Roller patent. "
882,1," Count V is entitled, ""Allied's Infringement of VIL's Exclusive Territory"" (verified third am.cplt. at 25). "
883,2," In its amended counterclaim, Allied contends the market dividing agreements are unreasonable, unenforceable restraints of 
trade and requests a declaratory judgment so stating."
883,3," Allied attempts to distinguish the rights of what it calls Verson Delaware (incorporated in 1979 by VASP in Delaware as Verson 
International Ltd.) and VIL (established in 1979 by VASP in England). This contention merely further clouds an already 
complicated corporate history, and does so seemingly without justification. Allied contends Mr. Kelleher fails to explain ""how the 
allegedly enlarged rights of VIL Delaware were transferred to VIL or why VIL, VASP and VIL Delaware would abandon their 
consistent pattern of documenting the transfer of rights to technology"" (Allied Products Corp.'s reply mem. on the mo. for sum. 
jdgmt. at 3). We frankly cannot isolate exactly how this contention impacts on the motions at issue, nor can we understand why, 
if we are correctly interpreting the claim, Allied chose to wait until now to lodge its objection. We choose to ignore this issue at 
the present time, and instruct Allied to reevaluate its position in light of this opinion. Were VIL's corporate structure to remain 
relevant, Allied is hereby granted permission to submit its argument on paper. "

886,6, Case No. IV/B-2/32.315 -- Allied Products Corp./Verson International Group Ltd. 
887,7," In its fourth affirmative defense Allied argues that ""plaintiffs' claims arise out of alleged agreements that are illegal under the 
antitrust laws and Illinois common law"" (def. Allied Prod. Corp.'s verified ans. to third am.cplt., aff. defense and counterclaim at 
46). That being the fourth defense in its entirety, we are left to wonder exactly which legislative enactment the agreements 
purportedly violate. We also cannot help but note that none of the cases cited to us contain discussion of any Illinois legislation. 
They instead recite the common law principle that contracts in restraint of trade are disfavored, and subsequently evaluate 
whether the particular restraint at issue falls within one of the various exceptions to the rule. Taking our cue from the parties' own 
submissions, our discussion focuses on resolving the common law issues. While this order may well provide a sufficient legal 
basis for resolving the dispute under the relevant state antitrust legislation, we leave that decision to another day. "
890,8," By its own terms, the VASP/VIL License Agreement states: This License has been made and delivered contemporaneously with the sale by Verson of all the issued share capital of 
Licensee and thereby in effect all of the business assets and property of Licensee and subsidiary companies through which 
Licensor has operated its business outside the United States and Canada. Id. at § 6.03. "
892,9," VIL lists the following in its 12(f) statement: ""VIL (including subsidiaries acquired after the MBO) has completed at least one 
sale of some sort in all industrialized countries of the world except Ivory Coast, Kenya, Tanzania, Chile, Czechoslovakia, Syria, 
Yemen, and those to which VIL is prohibited from selling under U.S. law such as Vietnam."" VIL's Local Rule 12(1) [sic] 
Statement relating to VIL's Motion for Summary Judgment on the Sale of a Business Issue, at para. 37."
892,10, Both sides agree that Littell also had significant business within the United States and Canada.
892,11, That was the central holding of our prior order requiring the sharing of Littell technology. 
894,12," For example, were a particular event impossible without the presence of four separate variables each of which occurs 50% of 
the time, the event's frequency is much less than one would expect. In fact, the resulting probability would only be .5 4 or .0625. 
And to the extent that ""may"" represents a frequency less than .5, the probability would be reduced even further."
894,13," We see no reason to evaluate the degree to which VIL was instrumental in Littell's obtaining orders for installation of scroll 
sheeting lines in Indonesia, Taiwan, and Poland. Mr. Kelleher's affidavit notes that, for whatever reason, those orders are being 
filled by Littell. Were these purchasers only now entering the market, this court's ruling would permit both Littell and VIL to compete for the 
Indonesian and Taiwanese orders, and VIL would have a right of first refusal in Poland. "
895,14," Allied also maintains that VIL's hiring Mr. Sangerman and others renders the protection afforded by the territorial allocations 
unnecessary. That conclusion, assuming it is not only correct but also verifiable (dubious assumptions), misses the point. The 
appropriate test centers on whether the restraint was reasonable when written. To view subsequent events as determinative 
would penalize that party which exercised better business judgment. Where Allied submits no support for its position, we cannot 
adopt such an awkward holding."
895,15," Allied notes only that replacing Mr. Sangerman will be a ""challenge"" (mo. to supple. Allied Prod., Corp.'s mo. for sum.jdgmt. at 
para. 3)."
895,16," Allied's own submissions suggest the same: ""Littell is justifiably concerned that this 'brain drain' might continue and inflict 
further irreparable harm if Littell is not given the opportunity to compete in some part of the world outside of the United States 
and Canada"" (Allied Prod. Corp's repl. to VIL's resp. to Allied's mo. to supple. at 3) (emphasis added). "
896,17," Because the impact on the seller and the public directly relates to the territorial and product scope of the restrictions, we do 
not repeat that discussion from above. We invoke the above analysis of the third prong of our test -- the impact on the seller and 
the public. "
897,18," As at the preliminary injunction stage, we find Mr. Basta's testimony particularly persuasive ""since he was intimately involved 
in putting the deal together when it happened"" (rec., 8/12/88 at 5)."
897,19," We are reluctant to assign substantial legal significance to the statements of various individuals involved in the financing end 
of the MBO. For example, Mr. Neal of Citicorp Venture Capital claims that access to new VASP technology over the full 5-year 
period was a fundamental factor in the Citicorp decision to support the MBO. To the extent that financing anticompetitive 
arrangements makes good business sense, Mr. Neal's claim does little to assist our inquiry. Cf., United States v. Timken Roller 
Bearing Co., 83 F. Supp. 284, 310 (N.D. Ohio 1949) (in order for the Sherman Act to assist the free flow of commerce, good 
business purposes cannot justify restraints of trade). "
898,20," We somewhat reluctantly note that interpreting the contract was considerably more difficult due to what we can only describe 
as poor and perhaps grammatically incorrect phraseology. As written, it is not at all clear either what is ""covered"" by the Patents 
and/or by utilizing the ""Know-How"" or what is ""in the Territory."" And while we are confident that our interpretation is correct, we 
are equally certain that some other description would have more concisely conveyed the desired meaning."
898,21," The naked allegation that some patents covered by the licensing agreements might be no longer in force cannot suffice in 
rendering the product scope overbroad. At a minimum, Allied (the owner of the patents and know-how at issue in the VASP/VIL 
Licensing Agreement) would need to identify a particular patent or type of know-how which had made its way into the public 
domain. Furthermore, this focus misses the point: the License Agreements cover products, not information. And manufacturing 
even a single product most often requires the use of several patents and/or pieces of know-how. In such circumstances mere 
possession of information relating to a single component is unhelpful. Thus, Allied would need to demonstrate that, for a 
particular product, all such information had made its way into the public domain. Given that Allied is in the best position to make 
such a showing, and that it has not even attempted to isolate a single patent which has become public, its contention is without 
merit. "
913,1," For purposes of the pending motions, any genuinely disputed facts were resolved in favor of the plaintiff and all reasonable 
inferences drawn in his favor."
913,2," Before July 1975, Lehigh Corporation was called Lehigh Acres Development, Inc."
913,3," In 1970, the date of the plaintiff's contract, the annual dues were $ 10. By 1980, the dues had risen to approximately $ 35. "
914,4," The defendant asserts that although the plaintiff signed a proposed Agreement for Deed (which contained additional, 
handwritten terms suggested by the plaintiff), the form never was tendered to Lehigh; and although a Lehigh representative 
signed a form contract containing the country club proviso, the plaintiff himself never signed that form. According to the 
defendant, there never was a contract, signed by both parties, which contained the county club clause. Nevertheless, at this 
stage in the proceeding, the court will assume that such a contract did exist, especially in light of the defendant's July 1980 letter 
attempting to collect from the plaintiff delinquent country club dues. See infra p. 6. "
915,5," At that point, Judge Moran was presiding over the case."
915,6," The parties also engaged in discovery relating to the defendant's motion to transfer the case to Florida, which this court denied 
on June 30, 1982."
915,7," On that date the plaintiff moved for leave to file the amended complaint, and on October 21, 1981, Judge Moran allowed the 
plaintiff to file the amended complaint subject to the defendant's motion to strike."
915,8," The motion also requested the court to strike and dismiss Counts II and III of the amended complaint on the grounds that the 
amendments were untimely and would prejudice the defendant. The court hereby denies the motion insofar as it is based on the 
timeliness of the amended complaint, especially since, contrary to the defendant's assertions, discovery had been closed only 
with respect to the transfer issue. "
916,9," In addition, the plaintiff must satisfy the requirements of each type of prospective relief. The Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 
U.S.C. § 2201 (1982), requires the existence of an ""actual controversy."" See Foster, 798 F.2d at 242. A request for injunctive 
relief depends, in part, on a showing of irreparable harm and of the inadequacy of remedies at law. See id."
916,10," See, e.g, Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 355 n.3 (1983) (because plaintiff alleged fifteen instances of injury, which 
occurred within a period of less than two years, he had demonstrated a ""credible threat"" that he again would be subject to illegal 
conduct). "
917,11," In Lyons the Court seemed to place a limit on the ""evading review"" prong of the ""capable of repetition"" doctrine by stating that 
because the plaintiff requested damages in addition to prospective relief, his claim ""remain[ed] to be litigated in his suit for 
damages; in no sense does that claim 'evade' review."" 461 U.S. at 110. "
918,12," The Court later extended this doctrine to cases in which class certification had been denied. In Geraghty, the Court held that 
an action brought on behalf of a class did not become moot upon expiration of the named plaintiff's substantive claim, even 
though class certification had been denied. The Court reasoned that the named plaintiff still retained a personal stake to appeal 
the denial of class certification. If on appeal the denial of class certification was reversed, and the class subsequently was 
certified, then the named plaintiff would be able to press the merits of the claim. But the Court's holding was limited to the appeal 
of the denial of the class certification motion. A named plaintiff whose claim expires may not continue to press the appeal on the 
merits; rather, he must wait until the class is properly certified before he can continue litigating the claim on the merits. 445 U.S. 
at 404. "
919,13," Indeed, some Seventh Circuit cases have noted that HN11[
] a case is not mooted by the precertification mooting of the 
named plaintiff's claim only when the class claims are so inherently transitory as to evade review absent class treatment and if 
the named plaintiff's claim is ""capable of repetition, but evading review""--that is, if there is a reasonable expectation that the 
same complaining party would be subjected to the same action again. See Gotches v. Heckler, 773 F.2d 108, 115 (7th Cir. 
1985) (Posner, J., concurring); Davis v. Ball Memorial Hosp. Ass'n, Inc., 753 F.2d 1410, 1416, 1418 & n.14 (7th Cir. 1985); see 
also Willan v. Menomonee Falls School Sd., 658 F. Supp. 1416, 1420 (E.D. Wis. 1987). But see Foster, 798 F.2d at 245 
(exception to precertification mootness of named representative's claims applies even if his own claims--and those of the class--
cannot be characterized as capable of repetition, yet evading review); Trotter, 748 F.2d at 1183 (same)."
919,14," Of course, even if the court decides that the claims of the class should not be mooted, the court still must determine whether 
the named plaintiff, who no longer has a stake in the underlying merits of the case, still is an adequate class representative."
919,15," The plaintiff filed his motion for class certification on September 17, 1980, and the memorandum in support of the motion on 
September 22. Because Judge Moran had ordered discovery on the class certification issue, the defendant did not even file a 
response to the class certification motion until April 1981; and the initial briefing on the motion was not completed until July 16, 
1981. "
920,16," In fact, the only letter from Lehigh that even mentions the plaintiff'5 credit rating is the June 25, 1973, communication; that 
letter, however, dealt with the plaintiff's failure to make an installment payment for his lot, not the country club dues."
920,17," Although the plaintiff attached documents from 1977 (from Lehigh to the Land Sales Section of the Illinois Department of 
Registration and Education) indicating that failure to pay club dues could constitute a lien on the property, the plaintiff never 
presented any evidence that Lehigh, in 1980, intended to pursue such a policy against him or that Lehigh asserted liens against 
any other purchasers In fact, the defendant recorded the plaintiff's deed in the ordinary course of business, apparently without 
reserving the lien."
920,18," Even if he did have standing, the court would conclude, for the reasons stated above, that the defendant could not invoke the 
""relation back"" exception to the mootness doctrine. "
921,19," Judge Ripple also noted, however, the question of prudential standing under a statutory provision also may be viewed as a 
question of failure to state a cause of action. See 852 F.2d at 996."
921,20," In Associated General Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. California State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 535 n.31 (1983), the 
Court distinguished between ""antitrust standing"" (however defined) and constitutional standing: HN13[
] [T]he focus of the doctrine of ""antitrust standing"" is somewhat different from that of standing as a constitutional 
doctrine. Harm to the antitrust plaintiff is sufficient to satisfy the constitutional standing requirement of injury in fact, but the court 
must make a further determination whether the plaintiff is a proper party to bring a private antitrust action. "
922,21," In fact, prior to Brunswick Professor Areeda dealt with the issue of antitrust injury under the heading of damages. After 
Brunswick, however, Professor Areeda analyzes the question of antitrust injury under the heading of standing. See Areeda 
Supplement, supra, § 334, at 292. "
923,22," This requirement is at the center of a furious debate over whether tying arrangements are unlawful per se or must be analyzed 
under the rule of reason only. Traditional per se principles require only that competition in the tied-product market be 
""appreciably restrain[ed]."" Northern Pac. Ry. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 6 (1958). Under the rule of reason, however, there 
must be a ""substantial threat"" that the tying seller will acquire market power in the tied-product market. The issue has not been 
resolved definitively by either the Supreme Court or the Seventh Circuit.  Compare Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 15-18 (per se 
rule) and Parts & Elec. Motors Inc. v. Sterling Elec., Inc., 826 F.2d 712, 718-19 (7th Cir. 1987) (noting debate but following 
Jefferson Parish) with Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 33-42 (O'Connor, J., concurring in the judgment) (rule of reason analysis 
should be applied); Parts & Elec. Motors, Inc. v. Sterling Elec., Inc., 866 F.2d 228, 235 (7th Cir. 1988) (Posner, J., dissenting) 
(same); Will v. Comprehensive Accounting Corp., 776 F.2d 665, 674 (7th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1129 (1986) and Carl 
Sandburg Village Condominium Ass'n No. 1 v. First Condominium Dev. Co., 758 F.2d 203, 210 (7th Cir. 1985) (citing Justice 
O'Connors opinion in Jefferson Parish). This controversy, however, has no effect on the disposition of this case, since the court 
concludes that the plaintiff 1) has no standing to assert the tying claim, and 2) even if he did, he has shown no evidence of 
market power in the tying-product market and, therefore, cannot litigate the issue on behalf of a class. See infra parts V.C., VI.B."
923,23," Tying claims may be brought under either the Sherman Act or the Clayton Act. See 2 J. von Kalinowski, supra p. 32, at § 
6J.02[7], .03[2][d]; see also Will v. Comprehensive Accounting Corp., 776 F.2d 665, 669-70 (7th Cir. 1985) (discussing tying and 
""conspiracy"" requirement of § 1 of Sherman Act), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1129 (1986). "
924,24, See surpa note 22.
924,25," Kypta viewed this argument as one of ""fact of damage"" or ""antitrust injury"" (as opposed to the amount of damage). The court 
noted that ""the gravamen of a tie-in action"" is the ""net economic loss suffered by the plaintiff."" 671 F.2d at 1285. Thus, the buyer 
must establish that the price paid for the tied and tying products exceeded their combined fair economic value: The rationale behind this requirement is apparent: A determination of the value of the tied products alone would not indicate 
whether the plaintiff indeed suffered any net economic harm, since a lower price might conceivably have been exacted by the 
franchisor for the tying product. Unless the fair market value of both the tied and tying products are determined and an 
overcharge in the complete price found, no injury can be claimed; suit, then, would be foreclosed. Id.; see also United States Steel Corp. v. Fortner Enters., Inc., 429 U.S. 610, 618 (1977) (so long as overall price is competitive, 
no harm has occurred). "
925,26," The plaintiff's conclusory allegation that his credit rating has been damaged by his failure to pay the delinquent dues already 
has been addressed. See supra notes 16-17 and accompanying text."
925,27," At times the plaintiff argues that the damages suffered by the class are identical. This, of course, would indicate that the class 
likewise could not make out a valid tying claim."
925,28," HN23[
] Class actions under Rule 23(b)(2) are appropriate only when declaratory or injunctive relief is requested or when monetary relief is not the predominant relief requested given the availability of a treble damages remedy under the antitrust laws, 
tying class actions, like most antitrust class actions, generally are maintained under Rule 23(b)(3) See, e.g., J. Matheson, supra 
p. 34, at 874 n. 82. "
926,29," In making this finding, the court in no way indicates that Mr. Young is not a capable lawyer of excellent reputation or that his 
experienced counsel is incapable of litigating this case in a very professional and competent manner. The court merely holds 
that certification is precluded in part because Mr. Young is not a member of the class he seeks to represent. "
927,30," Suits for equitable relief are not governed by this four-year statute of limitations, though such actions may be barred by the 
doctrine of laches. See II Areeda & Turner, supra p. 32, at § 325e. "
928,31," The July 1980 final installment payment cannot be an ""overt act,"" for even if the plaintiff were the victim of an illegal tying 
arrangement, his payment for the lot involved no payment of allegedly illegal dues and, therefore, did not cause any ""antitrust 
injury."" See Kaiser, 677 F.2d at 1055 (suit brought to recover amounts owed under allegedly illegal tying contract may be overt 
act if it seeks to enforce and recover under tying provision, not under other provisions that did not embody or further 
anticompetitive practices)."
928,32," The plaintiff's conclusory allegations of threats to his credit rating already have been discussed and rejected, see supra notes 
16-17 and accompanying text, and it is difficult to see how the plaintiff suffered any monetary injury--antitrust injury--from the 
alleged dunning letter of November 30, 1980, since he was not personally liable for payment of the delinquent country club dues. 
Nor can the litigation costs incurred be considered an antitrust injury; since the statute provides for recovery of attorneys' fees for 
antitrust violations, allowing litigation costs to be considered as part of the ""antitrust injury"" would boots trap the attorneys' fees 
remedy into the plaintiff's prima facie case."
928,33," Query, though, whether there actually are two separate products in this case. As the defendant repeatedly has stated, and the 
plaintiff has not denied, the City of Lehigh Acres was envisioned not merely as a collection of real estate parcels, but as a 
community, complete with residential housing, light industry, service facilities, and recreational areas (including, of course, the 
infamous Lehigh Country Club). The Lehigh Country Club was an integral part of this concept, not a separately marketed 
product, and most likely served only to increase the value of the lots that were purchased. "
929,34, This deficiency also proved fatal to the plaintiff's antitrust standing. See supra part V.B.
929,35," If anything, the Lehigh product was unique only because of the Lehigh Country Club."
929,36," See also supra note 25. In addition, the fair market value of the lots would depend upon their size, shape, and location."
929,37," Of course, the fact that the ""amount of damage"" would vary among class members would not necessarily preclude 
certification, unless such a determination would be logistically difficult, such as when ""fact of damages"" is inextricably intertwined 
with ""amount of damage"" (as it would be in this case). Nevertheless, although a court may bifurcate the liability and damages 
issues, it may not bifurcate elements of the prima facie case; one of these elements in tying cases, of course, is the ""fact of 
damage."""
929,38," Although the plaintiff has filed a motion to certify a class on these claims as well, the parties have devoted most of their efforts 
to briefing certification of the tying claims, and the briefing on the ILSFDA and FDCPA claims therefore is inadequate. 
Accordingly, the court will not rule on the certification issue for these claims (even though proof of fraud would seem to require 
separate, individual proof for each purchaser) and will address only Mr. Young's individual claims. "
930,39," The amended statute was enacted on December 21, 1979, but was to become effective on the date the regulations 
implemented the amendment, but no later than six months after enactment--i.e., June 21, 1980. "
931,40," Contrary to the plaintiff's assertion, the defendant did not ""obtain money or property"" from the plaintiff as a result of the July 
1980 letter. 15 U.S.C. § 1703(a)(2)(B). Nor has the plaintiff requested nominal or statutory damages (as he had under the 
FDCPA). Furthermore, the plaintiff cites absolutely no support for his claim for ""rescission"" of an already performed contract, 
especially when there was no fraud at the time of the sale and when the rescission claim was raised more than one year after 
the plaintiff's deed was recorded and sent to him. "
932,41," The July 1980 letter clearly indicates that Lehigh Corporation is ""a wholly owned subsidiary of Land Resources Corporation."""
932,42," Lehigh Country Club, Inc. is not even named as a defendant. "
934,1," This case was originally filed as an appeal in both the Court of Appeals and this court. We transferred the case to this court 
pursuant to C.A.R. 50."
934,2," HN1[
] Section 6-4-101, 2 C.R.S. (1984 Supp.), states as follows: "
935,," Illegal restraint of trade. Every contract or combination in the nature of a trust or conspiracy in restraint of trade or 
commerce is declared illegal. Every combination, conspiracy, trust, pool, agreement, or contract intended to restrain or 
prevent competition in the supply or price of any article or commodity constituting a subject of trade or commerce in this 
state, or every combination, conspiracy, trust, pool, agreement, or contract which controls in any manner the price of any 
such article or commodity, fixes the price thereof, or limits or fixes the amount or quantity thereof to be manufactured, 
produced, or sold in this state, or monopolizes or attempts to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce in this state, is 
declared an illegal restraint of trade. This statute is currently codified at § 6-4-101, 2 C.R.S. (1988 Supp.)."
935,3," The MLS is a marketing service which provides current information on property for sale in El Paso County including improved 
residential real estate. It publishes weekly catalogs containing descriptive listings of such real estate, as well as quarterly ""sold 
properties"" catalogs which state the sale price, days on the market and other information about listed properties that have been 
sold. MLS publications are available to all member brokers and to all salespersons employed in a member broker's office. The 
MLS is administered by the Board."
935,4, The trial court found that membership in the Board requires payment of dues and satisfaction of the following requirements: A. Have a valid real estate license and be actively engaged in the real estate businesses [sic] and its recognized branches; B. Have a place of business within the Board's jurisdiction; C. Have a favorable business reputation in the community; 
936,," D. Have a sound credit rating; E. Complete a Board indoctrination course; [and] F. Signify an intention to abide by the Constitution, By-laws, policies and regulations of the Board[,] [Colorado Association 
of Realtors] and [National Association of Realtors]. "
937,5," In Brown v. Indianapolis Board of Realtors, 1977-1 Trade Cases (CCH) para. 71,611 (S. D. Ind. 1977), the court concluded that 
a favorable business reputation requirement for membership in the defendant Board was reasonable. The opinion does not 
indicate what evidence was presented to support that conclusion. "
945,1," Plaintiffs allege that they are ""intermediary finders,"" a term which the Complaint defines as ""a person or entity which scouts the 
business and corporate community to locate companies interested either in acquiring or being acquired or merged with another 
company; and who, upon finding same, then introduces the respective acquiring, selling, or merging companies to each other for 
that stated purpose. . . ."" Complaint, para. 20(a)."
945,2," Durbin and Lodge also moved to dismiss on the ground of insufficiency of service of process, Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(5), but 
subsequently withdrew the motion. Their request for an award of costs in making the motion is denied. "
946,3," HN4[
] Under New York law, a person subject to jurisdiction under the state long-arm statute may be served outside the state in the same manner as that person is served inside the state. See N.Y. CPLR § 313."
946,4," To the extent that plaintiffs argue that jurisdiction is premised on N.Y. CPLR § 302(a)(3), plaintiffs have failed to make a prima 
facie showing that the requirements of §§ 302(a)(3)(i) or 302(a)(3)(ii) have been satisfied. "
947,5," Considering the motions in this posture will not prejudice defendants because they addressed the amended complaint in 
briefing the motions to dismiss. "
948,6," Both parties agree that the Donnelly Act, N.Y. Gen. Bus. L. § 340, is patterned after the Sherman Act and is governed by the 
same standards. Thus, plaintiffs' claims under the Donnelly Act are dismissed for the reasons discussed in the text. "
949,7," Defendants also move to dismiss the § 1962(d) (conspiracy) claim on the ground that the underlying § 1962(a) and (c) claims 
are invalid. As the Court finds that plaintiffs have alleged a valid § 1962(c) claim, the motion to dismiss the § 1962(d) claim is 
denied."
949,8," None of the alleged predicate acts of extortion are attributable to defendants Durbin or Lodge. Moreover, the only predicate act 
of fraud attributable to Durbin or Lodge is the mailing of a letter from Lodge to Deem on May 10, 1984. In order to state a claim 
under RICO, however, a complaint must allege two predicate acts of ""racketeering activity."" See 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). In 
addition, plaintiffs cannot attribute predicate acts of fraud committed by other defendants to Durbin and Lodge through 
conclusory allegations of conspiracy. Accordingly, the RICO counts are dismissed as to Durbin and Lodge."
949,9," Defendants also move to dismiss the predicate acts of fraud on the grounds that such acts fail to meet the particularity 
requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). The Court finds, however, that the acts of fraud alleged in the amended complaint are 
pleaded with enough specificity to survive a motion to dismiss on Rule 9(b) grounds. "
950,10," The motion to dismiss the common law fraud claims, counts twelve and thirteen, is also denied for the reasons discussed in 
the text. "

U.S. 533, 88 L. Ed. 1440, 64 S. Ct. 1162 (1944), which described the conduct of defendants as consisting of coercion and 
intimidation to force non-member insurance companies into the conspiracies and to compel persons who needed insurance to 
buy only from South-Eastern Underwriters on its terms. "
972,20," At the hearing, plaintiffs argued that ISO's withdrawal of statistical support for the 1973 policy forms after regulatory approval 
had been given by the relevant states to new forms amounted to coercion. The complaints allege in relevant part: On July 1, 1987, ISO officially withdrew ""support"" of the 1973 CGL form. ""Support"" in this context includes the normal data 
collection and actuarial services performed by ISO in aid of its member companies. Without such support, most ISO 
members could not continue to use the 1973 occurrence form, because it is very difficult and expensive for any single 
company to duplicate the critical ISO support functions. (Cal. Compl't para. 99; Conn. Compl't para. 103.) The conduct alleged, termination of statistical support for a superseded policy form, is on its face reasonable conduct that one 
would expect in the normal course of business. There is nothing inherently coercive or wrongful about it. There is no allegation 
that any insurer desired to continue to write insurance on the 1973 policy form but was coerced by defendants into not doing so 
by means of this conduct, and plaintiffs did not offer to amend their complaints or conduct specific discovery on this point. The 
allegation that ""most ISO members"" would find it ""difficult and expensive . . . to duplicate the critical ISO support functions"" is not 
sufficient to warrant subjecting these defendants to an antitrust action.  See Ocean State Physicians Health Plan Inc. v. Blue 
Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island, 883 F.2d 1101, 1989 U.S. App. LEXIS 12419, at 24 n.9 (1st Cir. 1989) (""Coercion [under 
the McCarran Act] has not generally been interpreted to include situations where options have not been entirely closed off to the 
allegedly coerced parties, even though such options may have been made more expensive""). To hold otherwise would be 
somewhat ironic, for it is the McCarran Act that allows the insurance industry, including defendants, to provide through ISO the

980,28," There is some uncertainty whether the Timberlane analysis for extraterritorial application of the antitrust laws has been 
superseded by the FTAIA. It is arguable that the FTAIA codifies the standard for determining whether there is extraterritorial 
jurisdiction for all cases, not only for those cases involving non-import trade. See P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law 
para. 236, at 235 (Supp. 1988) (""The most interesting question about the new statute is whether its standard for appraising 
export restraints differs from that for appraising import restraints or whether it merely 'codifies' a general understanding of when 
American antitrust should be concerned about restraints abroad that might affect United States interests only indirectly, 
insubstantially, or unforeseeably.""); Hawk, International Antitrust Policy and the 1982 Acts: The Continuing Need for 
Reassessment, 51 Fordham L. Rev. 201, 222 (1982) (""it is . . . not clear whether the specific effect test set forth in the Act is 
limited to determining whether export transactions of purely foreign transactions have the requisite effect on United States trade. 
The test might also be used in determining whether import transactions . . . have the requisite effect on United States trade."") 
See also the dictum in McGlinchy, 845 F.2d at 813 n.8, that the FTAIA was passed ""in an effort to provide a single standard for 
the issue of extraterritorial application of the Sherman Act."" In that case, however, the FTAIA clearly applied because export and 
foreign transactions were involved. Until there is a clearer indication that Timberlane I no longer controls, however, this Court must follow it. "
981,29," The legislative history of the FTAIA states that ""if a court determines that the requirements for subject matter jurisdiction are 
met, this bill would have no effect on the courts' ability to employ notions of comity, see, e.g., Timberlane Lumber Co. v. Bank of

1004,*," New York State adopted its own version of the Sherman Act, which, over the years, has undergone numerous amendments 
and is now known as the Donnelly Act (General Business Law § 340 et seq.).  The statute, also know as the ""Little Sherman 
Act"", is construed in light of Federal precedent and is given a different interpretation than the Federal legislation only where State 
policy, divergent statutory language or legislative history warrnat that such be done ( Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v Abrams, 71 NY2d 
327, 335). HN2[
] The Donnelly Act, modeled after but broader the Sherman Act, contains no counterpart of either the Clayton 
or Robinson-Patman Act amendments prohibiting price discrimination and, thus far, our courts have been reluctant to construe 
the Donnelly Act so broadly, preferring instead to await remedial legislation ( State of New York v Mobil Oil Corp., 38 NY2d 460, 
463-464; International Serv. Agencies v United Way, 108 Misc 2d 305, 307; Givens, Practice Commentaries, McKinney's Cons 
Laws of NY, Book 19, General Business Law § 340, at 519).  Price discrimination may still be actionable under the Donnelly Act 
if its effect is to restrain competition, as was the case under the Sherman Act before the Clayton and Robinson-Patman 
amendments ( Capital Tel. Co. v Pattersonville Tel. Co., 56 NY2d 11, 19; Givens, op. cit.).  At this juncture, however, the issue of 
whether defendant has a cognizable cause of action for price discrimination under the Donnelly Act has not been raised and is 
not before the court.  Therefore, the court has not considered the underlying merits of the claimed violation of the Donnelly Act in 
this case. "
1021,1," Defendants were involved in developing the steam under Dick's land, in addition to other properties. Geothermal Resources, 
Inc. (GRI) acquired steam rights in the Dick property in 1966. In 1970, GRI transferred its rights to Resources Investment 
Company (RIC), a subsidiary of Hughes Aircraft Company. Another Hughes subsidiary, Thermogenics, Inc. (TGI), took over a 
year later. GRI reacquired rights to the Dick property in 1982. Between 1971 and 1977, TGI contracted with defendants Pacific 
Energy Corp. (PEC) and Callon Petroleum companies, both owned by John Callon, for development and management of the 
steam rights to Dick's property. Between 1973 and 1977, TGI and PEC also were joint venturers in developing the Filley 
property, which adjoined Dick's land."
1021,2," Dick filed its original complaint in 1979, alleging a horizontal conspiracy to suppress and suppression of steam production from 
Dick's land for anticompetitive purposes. Extensive pre-trial proceedings included two defense motions for summary judgment, 
which were for the most part granted. Subsequently, the judge conducted a 22-day bench trial spread over 14 months to decide 
whether Dick could prove competitive injury to the steam market. Final judgment for the appellees was entered in 1985.  R.C. 
Dick Geothermal v. Thermogenics, Inc., 619 F. Supp. 441 (C.D.Cal. 1985). The original panel handed down its decision on 
March 16, 1988. The court ordered rehearing en banc and the case was argued to this en banc panel on May 12, 1988."
1021,3," In my view, deciding the antitrust standing issue without post-briefing argument does violence to Fed.R.App.P. 34(a) and 9th 
Cir. R. 34-4. "
1022,4," Dick's action was based upon §§ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1-2 (1988). His appeal concerns only section 1 
claims."
1022,5," The majority finds that the district court made factual findings and rulings sufficient to permit a decision as to standing. Opinion 
p. 13033. However, the district court made no findings of fact or rulings of law on standing. The majority's reference to Bubar v. Ampco Foods, Inc., 752 F.2d 445, 449 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 472 U.S. 1018, 87 L. Ed. 2d 
616, 105 S. Ct. 3481 (1985), is misplaced. In Bubar, summary judgment in favor of defendants was granted on the basis that the 
plaintiffs lacked standing and this was the sole issue raised on appeal by plaintiffs. Unlike the present case, plaintiffs in Bubar 
had ample opportunity to develop the record on standing in the district court, and thus de novo review based upon the entire 
record was appropriate. Here, the district court tried only the question of anticompetitive effects in the steam market. To decide this question, Dick was 
required to show injury to the market, not injury to itself. While a plaintiff attempting to show anticompetitive effects in a market 
might begin by demonstrating injury to itself, a plaintiff knowing that antitrust laws ""were enacted for the protection of 
competition, not competitors,"" Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 488, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701, 97 S. Ct. 690 
(1977) (quotation and emphasis omitted), could reasonably decide to focus on the market as a whole. Moreover, the existing 
record fails to demonstrate as a matter of law that Dick suffered no injury. "
1023,6," To its credit, the majority does not accept appellees' assertion that Steiner and Mulvey are inconsistent with Eagle v. Star-Kist 
Foods, Inc., 812 F.2d 538 (9th Cir. 1987). Eagle cited neither Steiner nor Mulvey, and denied plaintiff workers antitrust standing 
on the ground that plaintiffs' injuries were indirect and derivative from those suffered by the employer. Eagle is a classic Illinois 
Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707, 97 S. Ct. 2061 (1977), fact situation."
1023,7," The majority characterizes Steiner and Mulvey as cases utilizing a ""target area"" approach, which it says is rejected by 
Associated General Contractors. However, the short discussion of standing in Steiner questions only whether the appellant's 
interest is sufficiently close and direct to make the plaintiffs a proper party to complain of the alleged conspiracy. The court in 
Mulvey refers to ""target area"" in restricting the right to bring an antitrust action to those persons ""within that area of the economy 
which is endangered by a breakdown of competitive conditions in a particular industry."" Mulvey, 433 F.2d at 1076. Ironically, the 
question in Mulvey was not whether this Circuit's test of standing was too broad, in light of Supreme Court decisions, but rather 
whether it was too narrow. Id. In any event, contrary to what the majority asserts, Associated General Contractors does not 
""explicitly"" reject Steiner and Mulvey, nor even cite them. Rather, the Court simply cautions against the use of any single label or 
test as black-letter law. Its pragmatic approach is far from overruling Mulvey and Steiner. See below at p. 156."
1023,8," The Court lamented the fact that the union had not alleged any specific injuries, but instead had alluded only to unspecified 
injuries in ""business activities."" Given this vague allegation, the Court attempted to hypothesize possible injuries. "
1024,9," In McCready, standing existed even though there was no showing that McCready's economic injuries -- her unreimbursed 
psychologist's fees -- resulted from the anticompetitive nature of defendants' illegal conduct. Although McCready was a 
consumer of psychotherapy, there was, as Justice Rehnquist pointed out vigorously in dissent, no allegation that ""the conspiracy 
has affected the availability of the psychological services she sought and actually obtained. Nor does she allege that the 
conspiracy affected the price of the treatment she received."" 457 U.S. at 489. Nonetheless, the majority found standing because 
plaintiff's injury was ""inextricably intertwined with the injury the conspirators sought to inflict on psychologists and the 
psychotherapy market."" Id. at 484. "
1028,10, Judge Noonan's gratuitous discussion of the per se issue does not command a majority of the en banc panel. 
1029,11," This caveat applies equally to application of per se analysis to horizontal price fixing, as demonstrated by the opinion in BMI. 
There the Court held that a particular horizontal price fixing agreement, where associations of composers sold their musical 
performance rights for a fixed fee via a collective blanket license, was so justified by unique procompetitive reasons that the per 
se rule against price fixing did not apply. See BMI, 441 U.S. at 20-24. Moreover, the Court stressed, as it did in NCAA, that the 
product being sold would not be available at all but for the horizontal agreement. Compare BMI, 441 U.S. at 22-23, with NCAA, 
468 U.S. at 101. "
1030,12," As to appellees' relationship in Dick's property, the district court was understandably uneasy about applying the label ""vertical."" 
R.C. Dick, 619 F. Supp. at 448. The sequential rights that most of the developers held were neither horizontal nor vertical. Only 
TGI's relationship with the Callon companies on Dick's property could be called vertical. However, at the same time this 
relationship existed, TGI and PEC were involved in a joint venture for production of steam from the neighboring Filley property, 
making them horizontal competitors as well. "
1031,13," Further support for the proposition that naked restraints on competition cannot survive Rule of Reason analysis absent 
procompetitive justification appears in the Court's earlier statement regarding horizontal agreements to withhold services: 
""Absent some countervailing procompetitive virtue -- such as, for example, the creation of efficiencies in the operation of a 
market or the provision of goods and services -- such an agreement limiting consumer choice by impeding the 'ordinary give and 
take of the marketplace' cannot be sustained under the Rule of Reason."" 476 U.S. at 459 (citations omitted). On its face, this 
statement indicates that a naked restraint on competition cannot survive Rule of Reason analysis solely because no 
anticompetitive effect is shown. There must be a procompetitive virtue shown. "
1032,14," It makes no difference that the customer in this case, P.G. & E., was apparently a monopsony. Courts have never permitted 
horizontal restraints to be justified by the argument that a horizontal combination is necessary to exercise countervailing 
monopoly power. The majority errs when it assumes that no conceivable anticompetitive goal or effect could be shown because 
the monopsony controlled prices. It stands to reason that restricting the supply of goods to a monopsony, particularly when that 
monopsony faces chronic unmet demand, may provide the necessary leverage to force the monopsony to raise prices. Proof 
that a restriction on supply actually raised prices is not required to show an anticompetitive evil. Indiana Fed.  of Dentists, 476

mutually satisfactory arrangements, the Commissioner may award compensation in the form of one or more players and/or draft 
choices as he deems fair and equitable."" Mackey, 543 F.2d at 609 n.1. "
1060,3," Mackey observed that the basic sources of the exemption were sections 6 and 20 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 17 and 29 
U.S.C. § 52, and the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 104, 105, and 113.  Mackey, 543 F.2d at 611."
1060,4, 
1060,5," We stated: We note that our disposition of the antitrust issue does not mean that every restraint on competition for players' services 
would necessarily violate the antitrust laws. Also, since the Rozelle Rule, as implemented, concerns a mandatory subject of 
collective bargaining, any agreement as to inter-team compensation for free agents moving to other teams, reached 
through good faith collective bargaining, might very well be immune from antitrust liability under the nonstatutory labor 
exemption. "
1061,,"  Mackey, 543 F.2d at 623."
1061,6," We differ with the dissent's argument that the logic of Mackey applied to this case would end the labor exemption at impasse. 
We believe its language referring to the ""agreement sought to be exempted,"" 543 F.2d at 614, applies to the ""product of bona 
fide arm's-length bargaining,"" id., before termination and continues afterward, whether to impasse or to some other point in time."
1061,7," Indeed, in Reynolds v. National Football League, 584 F.2d 280 (8th Cir. 1978), we affirmed the district court's approval of a 
settlement in a class action by which the Players challenged the 1977 Agreement and its ""First Refusal/Compensation"" system, 
stating that it was ""a near certainty that the collective bargaining agreement was the result of 'bona fide arms-length 
negotiations.'"" Id. at 288. "
1064,8," As the dissent suggests, there may well be no impasse at this time. The district court carefully defined its determination as to 
impasse as to the single issue of player restraint provisions, even though, as the dissent points out, negotiations continue as to 
other issues. "
1065,9," The dissent assumes that the contractually created ""Right of First Refusal/Compensation"" system is a violation of the antitrust 
law. This contractual provision was spawned in collective bargaining, and as it is the product of a labor relationship, we cannot 
agree that it should be considered a violation of antitrust laws."
1065,10," On November 17, 1988, the League delivered two proposals to the Players. The first of these modified player benefits but 
maintained the First Refusal/Compensation system for all players, and strongly resembled a management proposal of 
September 7, 1987, that the players had rejected before striking. The second proposal, which offered free agency to some 
players but retained the First Refusal/Compensation system for many others, was similar to a management proposal offered to 
the Players in September and October of 1987. After the Players had rejected both proposals, the League implemented a new 
""free agency"" system effective February 1, 1989, which was substantially identical to the terms of the second proposal."
1065,11," The dissent argues that the court's action today deprives the union of the threat of antitrust laws, ""the antitrust lever"" and 
removes this issue from the bargaining table. This is precisely the thrust of the nonstatutory labor exemption to the antitrust laws. "
1066,12," The League concedes that the Sherman Act could be found applicable, depending on the circumstances, if a challenged 
restraint related to a permissive rather than a mandatory subject of bargaining; if the restraint had been imposed on employees 
outside the collective bargaining process or had not originally been proposed in good faith; or if the affected employees ceased 
to be represented by a certified union. None of these circumstances are presented by this case."
1066,13," The dissent places great stress on Ethan Lock's article, The Scope of the Labor Exemption in Professional Sports, 1989 Duke 
L.J. 339. Much of Lock's reasoning is based upon the ""significant mismatch in relative bargaining positions"" and, in addition to 
the labor exemption, addresses other issues, such as television revenues and restriction on movement of franchises as well as 
repeal of existing antitrust exemptions. As a court, we have a limited issue before us as to the temporal extent of the 
nonstatutory labor exemption. We acknowledge the many policy issues that exist in the League/Players dispute that may be 
addressed by Congress but not by us. Interestingly, while not in the record before us, Lock states that television revenues now 
exceed gate revenues which possibly may explain the dissent's reference to the change in percentage of gross revenues that 
player salaries represent. "
1067,1," The following colloquy occurred at oral argument: THE COURT: And as to the college draft issue, Judge Doty has made a specific finding that there was no impasse; is that 
correct? COUNSEL FOR OWNERS: He has not addressed that question yet * * * and that issue is not before the court on this 
certification."
1067,2," Had I been the original factfinder, I would not have found impasse. Not only is the college draft issue still open, but it appears 
that the parties continue to meet on grievances, drug testing, and other matters of importance. See Henry Miller Spring Co., 273 
N.L.R.B. 472, 472 (1984) (no impasse where parties are still negotiating over significant issues). The NLRB, however, found the 
question of free agency to be an issue of such overriding importance that no agreement could be reached as long as there was 
disagreement on that issue. NFL Players Association, No. 2-CB-12117 (as amended), Advice Memo. at 7-8 (Apr. 28, 1988). The 
NLRB thus found impasse. See Bell Transit Co., 271 N.L.R.B. 1272, 1273 (1984) (impasse in negotiations exists if impasse 
exists on issues of supreme importance); E.I. DuPont & Co., 268 N.L.R.B. 1075, 1076 (1984) (impasse in negotiations if 
impasse exists on issue of overriding importance). Neither party asked for a review of that decision. The district court relied on 
the NLRB's decision to find impasse."
1067,3," Player restraints agreed to by the owners and the players in the 1982 collective bargaining agreement did not provide an 
opportunity for players to become free agents. In the five years during which the 1982 agreement was in effect, only one player 
received an offer from another club. Under the restraint package initiated unilaterally by the owners in February 1989, after the 
NLRB found that an impasse had occurred in negotiations, each club was permitted to protect 37 players. Thus, none of the top 
37 players on each team has had the opportunity to become a free agent and establish his worth in the open market. The 
remaining 619 players were unprotected and able to enter into the free agency market. Of that number, 229 were signed by 
other teams. Of the 229, 149 were under contract with an NFL team as of the start of this season. For a discussion of the "
1068,," application of the antitrust laws to professional football and other sports, see Monopoly Sports Leagues, 73 Minn.L.Rev. 643 
(1989)."
1068,4," I favor the impasse test even though a persuasive argument can be made for ending the exemption at the expiration of the 
collective bargaining agreement. See Lock, The Scope of the Labor Exemption in Professional Sports, 1989 Duke L.J. 
(forthcoming). The author concludes that the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement is the only endpoint that promotes 
collective bargaining and labor law principles without subverting federal antitrust policy. The test adopted in Bridgeman v. NBA, 675 F. Supp. 960 (D.N.J. 1987), that the labor exemption survives only as long as the 
employer continues to impose the restriction in question unchanged and reasonably believes that the practice or some variant 
will be incorporated in the next agreement, is impractical, is inconsistent with Mackey, and permits the labor laws to trump the 
antitrust laws without any labor law justification."
1068,5," This view of Mackey is also consistent with Supreme Court decisions addressing the scope of the labor exemption. See, e.g., 
Connell Constr. Co. v. Plumbers & Steamfitters Local 100, 421 U.S. 616, 621-22, 44 L. Ed. 2d 418, 95 S. Ct. 1830 (1975) 
(""nonstatutory exemption has its source in strong labor policy favoring the association of employees to eliminate competition 
over wages and working conditions""); Amalgamated Meat Cutters v. Jewel Tea Co., 381 U.S. 676, 689, 14 L. Ed. 2d 640, 85 S. 
Ct. 1596 (1965) (""exemption for union-employer agreements is very much a matter of accommodating the coverage of the 
Sherman Act to the policy of the labor laws"")."
1068,6," I find no support in Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, 305 U.S. 197, 83 L. Ed. 126, 59 S. Ct. 206 (1938), for the majority's 
position. In that case, the United Electrical Workers contended that Consolidated Edison was interfering with the right of "
1069,," Consolidated's employees to form, join, or assist labor organizations of their own choosing and were contributing financial and 
other support to the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. The NLRB found that the company had violated sections 
8(a)(1), (2) and (3) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 158(a)(1), (2) and (3). It entered an order designed to 
correct the effects of the unfair labor practices, including an order for the company to cease and desist giving effect to a contract 
that had been entered into by Consolidated and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. The Supreme Court 
concluded that the NLRB was without authority to enter the cease and desist order because the NLRB neither alleged nor 
proved that those persons who joined the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers did so because of the unfair labor 
practices. Thus, it reasoned that a majority of the employees may well have approved the collective bargaining agreement. Try 
as I may, I am unable to see how that case is relevant to the matter at hand."
1069,7," A judicial determination that challenged restraints are exempt from the antitrust laws by virtue of the union's existence might 
induce the players to decertify the union. Lock, The Scope of the Labor Exemption in Professional Sports, 1989 Duke L.J. 
(forthcoming)."
1069,8," See Lock, The Scope of the Labor Exemption in Professional Sports, 1989 Duke L.J. (forthcoming). Lock notes that there are 
several features that distinguish the professional athletes' unions from the great majority of industrial unions. First, professional 
athletes do not possess homogeneous skills; a wide range of ability and expertise exists among players. Thus, different players 
have dramatically different needs from a union. Second, the nature of professional sports presumes that the owners retain nearly 
complete discretion to make necessary personnel changes to produce a winning team. Typically, a professional athlete has 
virtually no job security. For example, the NFL standard player contract contains no injury protection beyond the season in which 
the injury occurs and grants the team sole discretion to terminate a player's contract at any time for lack of skill. Only five percent 
of all NFL players have been able individually to limit this discretion. In addition, the professional life of an athlete is short, 
resulting in high turnover of union members. The NFL Players Association experiences an average yearly turnover of twenty-five 
percent. Thus, a strike jeopardizes a significant portion of the career and earning potential of many athletes. Moreover, most 
professional athletes possess highly specialized skills that are rarely marketable in any other industry. As a result, players are 
extremely vulnerable to explicit and implicit management pressure. "
1070,9," In 1961, Congress passed legislation permitting the NFL to sell its television rights in a package and to allocate the revenues 
on a pro rata basis, thus authorizing what otherwise would have been a clear violation of the antitrust laws. In 1966, Congress enacted legislation sanctioning the merger between the NFL and the AFL, a merger which otherwise would 
have violated the antitrust laws. Each of these actions by Congress weakened the players and their unions in the collective bargaining process vis-a-vis the 
owners. In 1966, when the AFL was a bona fide competitor of the NFL, salaries accounted for 67% of gross revenues. In the 
years following the merger, the percentage decreased. In 1972, the percentage was 42%. In 1980, salaries accounted for 30% 
of league revenues. Certainly, the courts should not tilt the scales further in favor of the owners by permanently legalizing 
violations of the antitrust laws."
1070,1," I base my views regarding the panel majority's misinterpretation of Mackey only upon the majority's apparent but wrongful 
assumption that impasse between the union and the owners has been reached. I agree with Judge Heaney that the district court should not have found impasse on the single issue of the free agency rule. See 
Powell v. National Football League, No. 89-5091, slip op. at 21-22 (8th Cir. Nov. 1, 1989) (Heaney, J., dissenting). The parties 
are still negotiating over other terms of the contract. Impasse on overall negotiations of the contract has not been reached by the 
parties and therefore summary judgment is not ripe at this time. The parties may yet settle all their disputes in one agreement. 
The finding of impasse, prematurely acquiesced in by the panel majority, overlooks the fact that in 1976 the owners argued a 
""quid pro quo"" existed for the adoption of the Rozelle Rule in the fact that the players received increased pension rights and the 
right to negotiate their own contracts. See Mackey, 543 F.2d at 616. Such an argument illustrates that labor negotiations involve 
a give and take on many varied issues. It is impractical to reach sound legal decisions on a bifurcated bargaining subject when 
other subjects which are inherently intertwined are still pending negotiation. "
1071,," The panel majority seemingly agrees that no impasse has been reached. See Powell, slip op. at 16 n.8. If the panel majority had 
stopped there, I would have no disagreement. The suit could be dismissed on the ground that bargaining on all subjects, 
including the free agency rule, continues. But the panel majority goes on and rules, in an unprecedented decision, that the 
exemption continues beyond a hypothetical impasse. Thus, the panel majority opinion is pure dicta."
1071,2," In Mackey, we did not need to decide whether the effect of an agreement might extend beyond its formal expiration date for 
purposes of the labor exemption. Mackey, 543 F.2d at 616 n.18. We expressly acknowledged the issue, however, in recognition 
of conflicting statutory obligations that might arise given cases requiring an employer to adhere to contract terms after the 
contract's formal expiration date while the parties continue their bargaining for a new contract. See, e.g., Hinson v. NLRB, 428 
F.2d 133, 139 (8th Cir. 1970). This duty to maintain the status quo, however, ends at the point impasse is reached. At that point, 
the slate is essentially wiped clean, and the employer is free to unilaterally implement proposals which the union may have 
strongly opposed at the bargaining table. "
1072,3," The earlier agreements in Mackey containing the restraints even contained a ""zipper"" clause which read: ""This Agreement 
represents a complete and final understanding on all bargainable subjects of negotiation among the parties during the term of 
this Agreement * * *."" 543 F.2d at 613."
1072,4," This is true of course as long as the unilateral action adheres to recognized legal restraints governing the parties' conduct. One 
such legal restraint would certainly be the antitrust laws. "

1081,1," Washington Mills sells its media primarily through its network of distributors. It does sell some media directly to end-user 
customers, but it is undisputed that such sales occurred only infrequently and outside Washington Mills's usual course of 
business during times relevant in this litigation."
1081,2," DeLong has been engaged in the sale and distribution of vibratory equipment and media for over twenty years, primarily in 
Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina."
1081,3, BCS was dismissed as a party to this action after settlement. 
1082,4," Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, and eastern Arkansas comprised 
Washington Mills's southeast sales region. "
1083,5, The parties have entered into court-approved protective orders to protect confidential customer information in this litigation. 
1084,6," Section 1 of the Sherman Act, in pertinent part, provides that HN6[
] ""every contract, combination in the form of trust or 
otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be 
illegal."" 15 U.S.C. § 1. DeLong also alleged violations of section 2 of the Sherman Act and section 3 of the Clayton Act. The district court granted 
summary judgment in favor of the defendants on these claims, and DeLong has not contested that ruling on appeal."
1084,7," The Supreme Court has expressly rejected the possibility, suggested by DeLong, that this vertical conduct can be construed as 
horizontal because some of its effects may be horizontal. Business Electronics, 485 U.S. at    , 108 S. Ct. at 1523 n. 4. "
1085,8," Recent vertical restraint decisions indicate that the Supreme Court now requires a higher threshold of proof of joint action in a 
vertical price fixing case in order to invoke per se illegality, not a relaxation of the settled rule that vertical price agreements are 
per se illegal.  Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 760-61, 104 S. Ct. 1464, 1469, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775 (1984) 
(reaffirming rule that vertical price restraints are per se illegal while nonprice restrictions are subject to the rule of reason)."
1085,9," This case was decided prior to the close of business on September 30, 1981, and is binding precedent under Bonner v. City of 
Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981). "
1086,10," DeLong attempts to circumvent the factual showing of market power and diminution of competition required under the rule of 
reason by citing NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma, 468 U.S. 85, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70 (1984). 
Once an antitrust plaintiff has adduced evidence demonstrating defendants' imposition of price restraints, according to DeLong, 
NCAA stands for the proposition that the defendants must come forth with ""some competitive justification even in the absence of 
a detailed market analysis."" 468 U.S. at 109-10 n. 42, 104 S. Ct. at 2964-65 n. 42. Under this interpretation of NCAA, DeLong 
contends that because it has shown a ""naked restriction on price"" within the meaning of NCAA, it is not required to adduce 
evidence of market power. This is a tortured reading of NCAA. In NCAA, the fact that the NCAA possessed power in the collegiate sports television market 
was obvious. The thrust of the Court's discussion upon which DeLong relies is actually to the effect that where ""as a factual 
matter, it is evident that petitioner does possess market power,"" 468 U.S. at 111, 104 S. Ct. at 2965, a lengthy economic 
analysis of market power is unnecessary. DeLong has made no showing that Washington Mills's market power, if any, is 
""evident,"" and therefore DeLong's argument based on NCAA is without merit."
1086,11," A conspiracy to artifically inflate or ""pad"" the price is a conspiracy to affect ""price or price levels."" Business Electronics, 485 
U.S. at    , 108 S. Ct. at 1525; County of Oakland v. City of Detroit, 866 F.2d 839, 841, 850 (6th Cir. 1989); National Marine 
Electronic Distributors, Inc. v. Raytheon Co., 778 F.2d 190, 193 (4th Cir. 1985) (in order to conspire to restrain resale price 
competition there must be ""some agreement to set, control, fix, maintain, or stabilize prices""). Washington Mills does not argue 
otherwise."
1086,12," DeLong also alleged that Washington Mills illegally divided market territories and specific customers among its distributors, 
and that DeLong's failure to respect those divisions was another factor leading to its termination in August 1985. Territorial 
restrictions, L.A. Draper & Son v. Wheelabrator-Frye, Inc., 735 F.2d 414, 422 n. 13 (11th Cir. 1984), and exclusive dealing 
arrangements, Midwestern Waffles, Inc. v. Waffle House, Inc., 734 F.2d 705, 711 (11th Cir. 1984), are nonprice vertical 
restraints and therefore reviewed under the rule of reason. GTE, 433 U.S. at 49, 97 S. Ct. at 2557. Because DeLong concedes 
that its evidence is insufficient to sustain rule of reason scrutiny, see supra, we need not address these contentions."
1086,13," The district court assumed for summary judgment purposes, but did not decide, that DeLong presented sufficient evidence of 
joint action. District Court Order 10. It did not need to reach the issue of whether a vertical agreement existed because it 
characterized the restraints at issue as nonprice in nature and therefore applied a rule of reason analysis. Because we believe 
that the restraints at issue are more appropriately characterized as vertical price restraints, see supra, we must address the 
question whether DeLong has presented sufficient evidence of conspiracy to survive a motion for summary judgment. "
1088,14," P & W 5000, PMC 3175-1, is a 7/8 x 7/8 tetrahedron pyramid, 20 bond. P & W 6000, PMC 3179-1, is a 5/7 x 5/8 angle-cut 
triangle, 25 degrees, 20 bond. P & W 7000, PMC 3178-1, is a 5/8 x 1/4 angle-cut triangle, 25 degrees, 20 bond."
1088,15," The eighty-five cent price was the price quoted to the distributor, which then would mark up that price for resale to Pratt. 
DeLong's initial successful bid to Pratt was $ 1.11 per pound for PMC 3175-1 and 3179-1 and $ 1.13 for PMC 3178-1. The exact 
prices paid for ""special"" media during the course of DeLong's relationship with Washington Mills are a subject of dispute 
between the parties, but it is clear that at all times the media sold to Pratt was priced substantially higher than Washington Mills's 
standard media."
1088,16," DeLong contends that Washington Mills gave BCS employees, particularly Robert Biebel and William Biebel, free Caribbean 
vacations. There does not appear to be evidence in the record suggesting that Washington Mills gave trips to BCS people. "
1089,17," DeLong alleges that Lawrence W. Bates, a former Pratt employee, was a key player in the arrangement between BCS and 
Pratt. Bates worked for Pratt for 37 years, retiring in 1977. Bates then went to work for BCS as a salesman responsible almost 
exclusively for the Pratt account in Connecticut. Contrary to DeLong's assertions, Bates retired several years before the 
Washington Mills media was approved by the Columbus plant, and thus he could not have personally issued the PMCs in 
question. Undoubtedly, his contacts at Pratt were advantageous to BCS, but our review of the record indicates that his role was 
not as instrumental as DeLong suggests. Bates testified that he did not deal with the Columbus plant at all."
1089,18," Prior to 1982, William and Robert Biebel owned all of BCS's stock. In 1982, they sold their interest in BCS to Malin, Kilrea & 
Larne, a Hong Kong corporation. Malin, Kilrea and Wood & Thompson are related corporations. During the time Malin, Kilrea 
owned BCS, BCS regularly paid ""management fees"" to Malin, Kilrea, which evidently were used to fund personal annuities for 
William Biebel and Robert Biebel. The payments from Washington Mills directly to Wood & Thompson served as these fees. 
BCS also made a $ 50,000 ""loan"" to Wood & Thompson which was never repaid. "
1090,19," In addition to the evidence discussed in the text, DeLong contends that complaints by dealers other than BCS about DeLong's 
pricing practices led to its termination. After it began selling Washington Mills products in 1982, DeLong was an aggressive seller 
and converted many end-users to Washington Mills media. DeLong's aggressive sales practices also engendered complaints 
from competing Washington Mills distributors. Corrosion Specialties, Inc., Paschal Associates, Inc., and BRW Quality Metal 
Finishing, Inc. all complained to Washington Mills that DeLong was underbidding them, and BRW suggested that DeLong's 
distributorship be terminated. Washington Mills did not act immediately on this request, but rather issued an ""open letter"" to 
certain distributors detailing problems with inter-distributor selling. This evidence is not sufficient to show concerted action between Washington Mills and its other distributors to terminate DeLong. 
The Supreme Court has held that in a distributor termination case, ""something more than evidence of complaints [by other 
distributors] is needed"" for a plaintiff to survive a motion for summary judgment. Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 764, 104 S. Ct. at 1471. 
We address that ""something more"" in the text. "
1091,20," DeLong claims, but has adduced no evidence to support its claim, that this meeting was arranged by Peter Ford of 
Washington Mills. Defendants deny this. "
1092,21," This former Fifth Circuit case was decided after the close of business on September 30, 1981, and is binding precedent under 
Stein v. Reynolds Securities, Inc., 667 F.2d 33, 34 (11th Cir. 1982). "
1093,22," Section 2 of the Clayton Act, as amended by section 1 of the Robinson-Patman Act, provides in relevant part that: HN21[
] It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, either directly or 
indirectly, to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality, where either or any 
of the purchases involved in such discrimination are in commerce, where such commodities are sold for use, consumption, 
or resale within the United States or any Territory thereof or the District of Columbia or any insular possession or other "
1094,," place under the jurisdiction of the United States, and where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen 
competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any 
person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them: 
Provided, That nothing herein contained shall prevent differentials which make only due allowance for differences in the 
cost of manufacture, sale, or delivery resulting from the differing methods or quantities in which such commodities are to 
such purchasers sold or delivered. . . . "
1094,15," U.S.C. § 13(a). As this court recently has reiterated, ""the basic purpose of Section 2(a) of the Robinson-Patman Act is to 
insure that purchasers from a single seller would not be injured by the seller's discriminatory pricing policies. The complaining 
party must allege and prove that there were two sales made by the same seller to at least two different purchasers at different 
prices."" Pierce v. Commercial Warehouse, Div. of Thompson Automotive Warehouse, Inc., 876 F.2d 86, 87 (11th Cir. 1989). A 
Robinson-Patman plaintiff must also demonstrate some sort of competitive injury.  Chrysler Credit Corp. v. J. Truett Payne Co., 
670 F.2d 575, 581-82 (5th Cir. 1982); M.C. Manufacturing Co. v. Texas Foundries, Inc., 517 F.2d 1059, 1065-66 (5th Cir. 1975)."
1094,23," In the district court, DeLong also argued that Washington Mills's infrequent sales to Pratt during the times material to this 
action were at lower prices than those charged to DeLong for media which DeLong resold to Pratt, an allegation of ""primary line"" 
price discrimination under the Robinson-Patman Act. The district court held that DeLong had not presented sufficient evidence of 
market conditions showing competitive injury, nor did DeLong show the requisite predatory intent on the part of Washington 
Mills. Therefore, it granted summary judgment against DeLong on those aspects of its Robinson-Patman Act claim based on 
Washington Mills direct sales to end-users. District Court Order 19-20, 24. DeLong does not contest this district court ruling on 
appeal, so we do not address those aspects of DeLong's Robinson-Patman claim. The Robinson-Patman Act claim DeLong 
raises before us is addressed in the text."
1094,24," Defendants' brief also argues that DeLong has not demonstrated sufficient competitive injury under the Robinson-Patman Act 
with regard to the ""special"" versus stock aspect of its claims as well as on other aspects of its claims upon which the district 
court denied summary judgment. The district court did not reach the competitive injury question. Therefore, defendants' 
arguments on this point, and plaintiff's in reply, are more properly addressed to the district court in the first instance."
1094,25," For purposes of this appeal, we assume but expressly do not decide whether this circuit recognizes the availability defense. "
1096,26," DeLong's tortious interference claim has another aspect, namely that the very act of termination by Washington Mills 
constituted tortious interference because DeLong could no longer provide its customers with Washington Mills media. Because 
Washington Mills was free to terminate DeLong, see supra, any negative effect on DeLong's business resulting from that 
termination cannot constitute tortious interference. West Virginia Glass, 317 S.E.2d at 594. "

course, after the fact and at best had minimal probative effect. At best, when considered with COA's established practice of 
sometimes exchanging billboards for favors, the jury could have considered the evidence of billboard gifts in 1983 and 1984 as 
evidence of COA's continuing way of doing business. "
1177,5," He testified in relevant part: Q.  Why are they not the same type of competitor? A.  Well, in the first place in an advertising campaign an advertiser will make a decision to have several media. He may very 
well suggest television, radio. If it is a car dealer he may use both, they will also use billboards as a companion in 
advertising. "
1178,," In other words, the easiest way to explain it is one is an indoor media; television, radio, newspaper, magazines. The other

1193,1," Although these allegations form the focus of the complaint, they are not an exhaustive description of the practices with which 
defendants are charged. Monument Builders also alleges that some cemeteries require bronze monuments to be composed of a 
certain alloy, and require customers desiring to install bronze monuments purchased elsewhere to have their marker tested at an "
1194,," independent laboratory. It also charges defendants with refusing to state the prices of markers separately from the prices of 
plots; assessing recording and bookkeeping fees not assessed against other customers; depriving customers of independent 
dealers of certain services that they perform for other customers, such as providing grave locations upon request; and imposing 
a variety of other lesser burdens on customers of independent dealers."

1197,6," At this stage, we are not determining the relevant market for substantive antitrust law purposes. Monument Builders' allegation 
in its complaint that the greater Kansas City area is the relevant geographic market should be presumed correct for venue 
purposes at this early stage in the proceedings, especially absent a contrary assertion by the Missouri defendants."
1197,7," If it later becomes apparent that persons residing in Kansas do not venture to Missouri to purchase cemetery plots, nor 
Missourians to Kansas, then the complexion of the suit would change. The court would then be faced with two distinct markets 
having different relevant characteristics. Completely different sets of evidence might be applicable to an evaluation of Monument 
Builder's claims. If this indeed proves to be the case, it might to appropriate under section 1391(b) to allow this suit to proceed 
against only the Kansas defendants. See 15 C. Wright, A. Miller & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure § 3827 at 275-76 
(2d ed. 1986). At this early stage in the proceedings, we need not address this issue. "
1199,8," Defendants cite with frequency to the Supreme Court's decisions in Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Serv. Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 79

L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). Both cases held that in the face of ambiguous circumstantial evidence of agreement, an antitrust plaintiff 
must come forward with ""evidence 'that tends to exclude the possibility' that the alleged conspirators acted independently."" 
Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 588 (quoting Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 764). The Court did not intend to end reliance on circumstantial 
proof of conspiracy, but rather to avoid reliance exclusively on evidence which is ""as consistent with permissible competition as 
with illegal conspiracy."" Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 588; Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 764. In their briefs, defendants offer no reasoning by 
which we could conclude that their alleged conduct was as consistent with legitimate business purposes as with collective effort 
to close independent dealers out of the market. More importantly, Monument Builders alleges that the practices have no other 
business purpose than to stifle competition from independent dealers. Neither Monsanto nor Matsushita, which reached the Court after a full trial in one case and considerable discovery in the other, 
control fully at the pleading stage. Although the rules of those cases are ones antitrust plaintiffs must ultimately satisfy, we 
cannot conclude that Monument Builders can prove no set of facts which would support its claim of conspiracy."
1199,9," The Eighth Circuit recently reviewed dismissal of a complaint apparently almost identical to the one here, and found the 
allegations of conspiracy sufficient: ""The complaint in this case alleges that the appellee cemeteries agreed to engage in tying arrangements in order to force 
cemetery lot customers to buy their memorials and installation services from the appellee cemeteries. The nature of the 
tying devices used is set forth in detail, ranging from rules flatly requiring the lot customer to deal only with the cemetery, to 
a variety of rules allegedly designed to erect barriers to independent memorial retailers and installers. The appellee trade 
associations are alleged to have participated in the conspiracy by recommending the restrictive rules complained of.

George Sales Co. v. Cool Attic Corp., 587 F.2d 266, 273 (5th Cir. 1979). Therefore, Baxley-DeLamar satisfied the minimal

U.S. 700, 22 L. Ed. 2d 658, 89 S. Ct. 1391 (1969). The Court reversed the grant of summary judgment to the defendants in a 
case similar to this one, based on the following conduct: ""'(1) Despite the unskilled nature of the work, all of the memorial parks refuse to permit the plaintiff to install markers sold by 
it; all of them insist that the work be done by the cemeteries themselves. ""'(2) None of the memorial parks charges lot owners a separate installation fee in the case of markers purchased from the 
cemeteries. ""'(3) All of the memorial parks require the payment of an installation fee by the plaintiff for installing markers purchased from 
the plaintiff. The plaintiff plausibly maintains that the actual cost of installation comes to about $ 3. Yet, enormous 
installation fees are charged plaintiff * * *. ""'(4) All of the memorial parks require a specific alloy content in the bronze markers installed, and reserve the right to reject 
non-conforming markers. The alloy content requirement happens to be the same as manufacturer Matthews' markers and 
the same as is implicitly suggested in a pamphlet (""Modern Cemeteries"") distributed by Matthews to its customers. All of the 
memorial parks except Roosevelt are customers of Matthews. ""'(5) There is evidence that Greenlawn, Woodlawn and Princess Anne have attempted to dissuade lot owners from 
purchasing markers from the plaintiff. The affidavit of plaintiff's president states that numerous other incidents of this nature 
have occurred. ""'(6) Defendant Matthews, in its pamphlet ""Modern Cemeteries,"" suggests a number of practices which in effect erect 
competitive barriers to retailers other than the cemeteries themselves. "
1201,," ""'(7) Many of these practices have been adopted by the memorial park defendants, as evidenced by affidavits in the record, 
and by the ""rule books"" of Rosewood, Princess Anne and Greenlawn. ""'(8) There is evidence of numerous visits to and conferences with the memorial parks by sales representatives of 
Matthews.'""  Id. at 701-02 (quoting Norfolk Monument Co. v. Woodlawn Memorial Gardens, 404 F.2d 1008, 1012-14 (4th Cir. 1968) (Craven, 
J., dissenting)). Allegations of conduct identical or similar to that set out in all but paragraphs 5 and 8 are found in Monument 
Builders' complaint."
1201,11," The trial court failed to address whether, even if plaintiff's claims do not amount to a per se illegal tying arrangement, 
defendants do in fact unreasonably restrain trade, thus violating section 1 under the rule of reason. Monument Builders may 
prevail if it can satisfy this more fact-bound test. See Jefferson Parish Hosp. v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 29, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2, 104 S. Ct. 
1551 (1984). The trial court should address this issue on remand should it become necessary. "
1202,12," The district court ordered sanctions when it dismissed the complaint, but it did not set the amount of the sanctions until after 
the notice of appeal was filed. Defendants argue that because plaintiff's notice of appeal was filed before the trial court's final 
determination on sanctions, this court does not have jurisdiction over the issue. The notice of appeal was filed before this court's 
decision in Phelps v. Washburn Univ., 807 F.2d 153 (10th Cir. 1986). Therefore, the rule announced in that case does not apply 
and we may exercise jurisdiction over the trial court's award of sanctions. See Thomas v. Metroflight, Inc., 814 F.2d 1506, 1512 
(10th Cir. 1987)."
1202,13," On appeal, Monument Builders concedes that it is not entitled to antitrust damages against the City of Olathe, but challenges 
the dismissal of its claim for injunctive relief against that defendant. The City of Olathe has filed a motion for sanctions on appeal 
under Fed.R.App.P. 38, alleging that the appeal against it is frivolous. To the contrary, Monument Builders' argument with 
respect to the dismissal of its claim for injunctive relief, far from being frivolous, has prevailed on appeal. Accordingly, the motion 
for sanctions on appeal is denied. "

1214,8," Sammi America purchased all the stock of Ken Carter from Kenneth Min, Ken Carter's president and sole shareholder, for $ 
50.00. Under the terms of the acquisition, Sammi America agreed to release Min from his personal guarantee on the $ 1.6 
million debt owing to Sammi America. The acquisition also provided for the resignation of the officers and directors of Ken 
Carter. Under Sammi America's management, Ken Carter entered into a two-year employment agreement with Min, who 
became Ken Carter's marketing director. Stipulated facts 15 and 16."
1214,9," Ken Carter purchased hollowware from Sammi America on letter of credit terms until sometime in 1982. There was no

1215,11," Plaintiff relied on the declaration of Howard Kim, Ken Carter's sales manager, to prove that the Korean Metal Flatware 
Association was a non-governmental entity. Plaintiff's exhibit 783. Mr. Kim stated that the Association was a self-regulating 
organization with no governmental or legal powers and that registration of design rights did not confer any property rights on the 
holder, or entitle the holder to protection. Rather, Kim stated, ""[The Association] is merely an administrative priority for 
exporters."" Plaintiff's exhibit 783 at 3. Defendants insist that Mr. Kim's description of the Association misstates the role of the Korean government. To contradict Mr. 
Kim's declaration, defendants called Mr. Park, a member of the Association, to testify at trial. Mr. Park stated that the Korean 
Metal Flatware Association is a quasi-governmental organization: the Association was established with government approval 
and three of the thirteen representatives were government officials. Record at 11-150, 153. The remaining representatives come 
from private industry: officials of manufacturing and trading companies. Although the Court found Mr. Park's testimony more 
credible than Mr. Kim's testimony, since Mr. Park actually served on the Association board, the Court accepts, for the purpose of 
the Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict, that the Association was non-governmental."
1215,12," Plaintiff's witness Warren Kashuk, a buyer for Metro Industries, testified that Mr. Nam, a section chief in Sammi's export

Products Division, revealed that most of Vollrath's orders would not have been available until well after the Christmas shopping 
season, however, Vollrath's attorneys abandoned this argument. Record at 4B-120; Record of Proceedings on April 3, 1989 at

1217,14," Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 119-20 n.15 (1986) (""in order to succeed in a sustained campaign of 
predatory pricing, a predator must be able to absorb the market shares of its rivals once prices have been cut . . . . It is also 
important to examine the barriers to entry in the market because without barriers to entry it would presumably be impossible to 
maintain supracompetitive prices for an extended time.""); and Matsushita, supra."
1217,15," In A.A. Poultry Farms, supra, the Seventh Circuit adopted the approach that in a predatory pricing case, it is plaintiff's initial 
burden to establish that recoupment is possible. The court criticized the use of cost-price comparisons because of the 
complexity of determining what should be the appropriate measure of cost, and the difficulty of calculating costs. The court 
stated: It is much easier to determine from the structure of the market that recoupment is improbable than it is to find the cost a 
particular producer experiences in the short, middle, or long run (whichever proves pertinent). Market structure offers a way to . . 
. avoid the imponderable questions that have made antitrust cases among the most drawnout and expensive types of litigation. 
Only if a market structure makes recoupment feasible need a court inquire into the relation between price and cost."
1217,881, F.2d at 1401.
1217,16," The law of attempted monopolization in this Circuit makes it unnecessary for plaintiffs to concern themselves with 
considerations of recoupment and market power in predatory pricing cases. HN6[
] Under the law of attempted 
monopolization, a plaintiff need not offer proof of market power or of a dangerous probability of success where a defendant's "
1218,," conduct is predatory. See supra Part II. In a predatory pricing case, a plaintiff can establish that the defendant's conduct is prima 
facie predatory by showing that defendant set its prices below average variable cost."
1218,17," Both parties' economic experts defined variable costs as those costs which rise in direct proportion to sales. Record at 6-117; 
12-176. The determination as to which costs are fixed and which costs are variable is a factual determination. William Inglis, 
668 F.2d at 1038."
1218,18," HN8[
] Although the law of attempted monopolization seems to eliminate considerations of market power after plaintiff offers 
evidence of pricing below average variable cost, in order for a defendant to effectively rebut the inference of predation, 
defendant must be able to place market power, recoupment and a dangerous probability of success in issue. A price is only predatory ""if its anticipated benefits depended on its tendency to eliminate competition."" William Inglis, 668 F.2d 
at 1034 (emphasis added). Thus, the most effective way for the defendant to rebut the presumption that its below average 
variable cost pricing was predatory is by showing that no reasonable participant in the market could expect to maintain monopoly 
power long enough to reap any substantial monopoly gains."
1218,19," Despite the focus on cost-price comparisons as a method to determine the intent of the price-setting firm, the Ninth Circuit's 
predatory pricing decisions implicitly recognize that a showing of market power and the possibility of recoupment are essential to 
a predatory pricing claim. Rather than require a plaintiff to overcome the initial hurdle of proving that recoupment is possible, as 
in the Seventh Circuit, see A.A. Poultry Farms, supra, however, the Ninth Circuit has considered market power less explicitly, 
invoking the requirement in cases where a finding of predation is inconceivable given the structure of the relevant market. In Janich Bros., Inc. v. American Distilling Co., 570 F.2d 848 (9th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 829 (1978), for example, the 
court found that a defendant which priced below cost on half gallon bottles of gin and vodka did not act predatorily. Casting the 
concerns of market power in the guise of product definition, the court held that in a predatory pricing case, the product must be such that if predatorily priced, rivals are likely to be driven out of the market or excluded, allowing the 
[defendant] to raise prices. Id. at 856. Since below cost pricing of half gallon bottles was unlikely to drive competitors from the market, the court affirmed a 
directed verdict for defendant. The Ninth Circuit has occasionally recognized the importance of market power and recoupment in 
defining predatory pricing. Transamerica Computer, 698 F.2d at 1384 (""[p]redatory pricing occurs when a company that controls 
a substantial market share lowers its prices to drive out competition so that it can charge monopoly prices, and reap monopoly 
profits, at a later time."") (emphasis added). "
1219,," At least one district court in this circuit, recognizing that market power and recoupment are the keys to predatory pricing, has 
implicitly adopted the showing of market power as an essential element of a predatory pricing case. In re Air Passenger 
Computer Reservations Sys. Antitrust Litig., 694 F. Supp. 1443, 1469-70 (C.D. Cal. 1988) (allegation of predatory pricing makes 
no economic sense unless alleged would-be monopolist has a significant market share and barriers to entry in market are low). If Vollrath were required to show that Ken Carter could have maintained a monopoly over the import/distribution stage of the 
United States hollowware market long enough to recoup losses, plaintiff's predatory pricing claim would fail as a matter of law. In 
general, monopolization of the distribution stage of most markets is considered to be implausible. P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, 
Antitrust Law: 1988 Supplement 492-93 (1988). Even if Ken Carter were to succeed in driving out the several 
importer/distributors with which it competed, Ken Carter could not possibly recoup its losses and raise prices. It is undisputed 
that the retailers who were Ken Carter's customers could, and in fact did, purchase hollowware directly from Korean trading 
companies other than Sammi. These retail customers could, then, prevent any drastic increase in Ken Carter's prices. Although plaintiff's expert, Dr. Shepherd, testified that the hollowware distribution market had ""moderate"" entry barriers, Dr. 
Shepherd based his opinion on the fact that there were no new entries into the market after Vollrath's exit. Entry barriers must be 
measured at the time of supra-competitive prices. Cargill, Inc., 479 U.S. at 120, n.15."
1219,20," As evidence of the close affiliation of the parent corporations and their subsidiary, plaintiff established that the three presidents 
of Ken Carter following the acquisition -- Sil D. Kim, Won In Rhee and James Kim -- were all former Sammi employees. 
Stipulated facts 7 and 10. Also, Howard Kim, Ken Carter's import manager throughout most of 1983, had previously served as a 
sales manager for Sammi America and as the head of the export department for Sammi. Stipulated fact 8. "
1220,21," Vollrath argued that Sammi used its position as Korea's largest producer of stainless steel and as Korea's largest or second 
largest trading company to exploit the small manufacturers of hollowware in Korea. This argument represents pure speculation 
by Vollrath; there is no evidence that Sammi actually used its leverage over the small manufacturers. Assuming plaintiff's 
argument is correct, however, this fact would aid defendants', not plaintiff's case. If Sammi were able to reduce its costs for 
producing stainless steel bowls by leveraging its power as a supplier of steel and exporter of bowls, any anticompetitive harm 
would be suffered by the Korean hollowware manufacturers, not distributors such as Vollrath or American consumers. The harm 
to the small Korean manufacturers could not form the basis of an antitrust claim because ""American antitrust laws do not 
regulate the competitive conditions of other nations' economies."" Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 582. Nor could Vollrath complain of 
harm to the small manufacturers, since Vollrath would suffer no injury therefrom. Id. at 583."
1220,22," Defendants view the three corporations as separate and distinct entities whose acts cannot be attributed one to the other. 
Defendants have taken this same position in support of their argument that this Court cannot exercise personal jurisdiction over 
Sammi Corporation. Defendants have maintained throughout this litigation that Sammi does not have sufficient minimum 
contacts with California to be subject to suit here. Although this Court initially held that it did not have personal jurisdiction over 
Sammi, the Court later reversed itself. Order Granting Plaintiff Vollrath's Motion to Reinstate Defendant Sammi Corporation, 
entered February 17, 1988. "
1221,23," On every hollowware item, Dr. Buckley's figures show that the invoice cost from Sammi to Ken Carter constitutes the major 
component of average variable cost. Column ""g"" to plaintiff's exhibit 701A at 7-A to 7-E; and column ""g"" to plaintiff's exhibit 701D 
at A-9 and A-10."
1221,24," On cross-examination, Dr. Buckley testified: Q: [H]ave you tried to compute the average variable cost of Sammi Corporation's -- A: No. Q: And would the same be true of Sammi America Corporation . . . . [Y]ou never tried to compute average variable cost . . . ? A: That's correct. "
1222,, Record at 6-177.
1222,25," Dr. Shepherd testified that after buying hollowware from the Korean manufacturers, importer/distributors generally marked-up 
the price of the product 30 to 40 percent. This large mark-up suggests that the combined entity could have made money even if 
Ken Carter's mark-up was very small. Record at 8-75."
1222,26," Citing England v. Chrysler Corporation, 493 F.2d 269 (9th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 869 (1974), plaintiff argued, in 
opposition to the post-trial motions, that Sammi could be held liable under the antitrust laws for recklessly operating Ken Carter 
such that other distributors would be forced to function at an unprofitable level. In England, plaintiff Sunset Dodge -- a privately 
owned Dodge dealer -- sued Chrysler Corporation -- the manufacturer of Dodge cars -- and Van Ness Dodge -- a Dodge dealer 
wholly owned by Chrysler. Sunset argued that Chrysler operated Van Ness in an effort to increase Chrysler's share of the 
automobile market. Although Chrysler turned a profit on all its sales, Chrysler allegedly subsidized Van Ness and operated Van 
Ness regardless of Van Ness' retail profit, thereby pressuring Sunset and other independent dealers to reduce prices. The Ninth 
Circuit assumed, without deciding, that, the predominant emphasis on market penetration, which results in the deliberately reckless operation of a subsidized retailer and 
which has the inevitable effect of forcing competing and non-subsidized dealers to function at an unprofitable level, could, if 
proved, constitute an unreasonable restraint of trade. Id. at 273. The court further stated that plaintiff would have to prove that the defendant parent deliberately determined to manage 
the subsidiary regardless of retail profit. Since Sunset failed to prove that Chrysler deliberately disregarded Van Ness' profits, the 
court entered judgment for defendants. England does not aid Vollrath. First, England addressed only section 1 of the Sherman Act, stating that the reckless operation of 
a subsidiary may be an unreasonable restraint of trade. Under Copperweld, this theory is no longer valid; parents and their 
wholly owned subsidiaries cannot conspire in violation of section 1. Second, to the extent that Sammi could be accused of 
attempting to monopolize the market to distribute hollowware by reckless operation of Ken Carter, plaintiff would be required to 
establish specific intent. England, however, held that reckless operation of a subsidiary is not a per se violation of section 1, nor 
a clearly predatory act. See also Mt. Lebanon Motors, Inc. v. Chrysler Corp., 283 F. Supp. 453 (W.D. Pa. 1968). Vollrath, then, 
would not be entitled to an inference of specific intent. Having failed to prove specific intent directly, any section 2 claim based 
on the theory assumed in England must fail. See Marquis v. Chrysler Corporation, 577 F.2d 624 at 640 n.27, and 641 (9th Cir. 
1978). See also In re Coordinated Pretrial Proceedings in Western Liquid Asphalt Cases, 478 F. Supp. 785 (N.D. Cal. 1979)."
1222,27," Since Vollrath was purchasing almost all of its hollowware from other Korean trading companies -- such as Hai Dong -- and 
could have purchased from a number of others, this is not a price squeeze case. "
1223,28," The Ninth Circuit's reasoning in D&S Redi-Mix v. Sierra Redi-Mix & Contracting Co., 692 F.2d 1245 (9th Cir. 1982), also 
supports the insistence on actual costs. In D&S Redi-Mix, defendant concrete company's financial statements did not include the 
costs for equipment rental and materials used by defendant; plaintiff's economic expert, however, imputed these costs to 
calculate whether defendant had priced predatorily. The Court approved of the expert's methodology because there was no 
evidence that the actual ""costs were other than as [plaintiff's] experts assumed."" Id. at 1248."
1223,29," When asked, ""[I]mputed interest is not something that Ken Carter actually pays; is that right?"" Buckley responded, ""Well, 
somebody paid for it. Money isn't free. So if [Ken] Carter didn't pay for it, Sammi[] paid for it or Sammi America paid for it. But it's 
all part of the cost of doing business."" Record at 6-168; Plaintiff's exhibit 701C, Ref: MVCF-1 at S-4 ""Evaluation of Ken Carter 
Industries' Financial Performance,"" (recognizing that Ken Carter was not required to pay interest on loans from Sammi America, 
rather Sammi America carried the interest). "
1224,30," This case presents an even stronger case for excluding the expert's calculations than Matsushita. In Matsushita, the Court 
based its understanding of defendants' actual costs on a single affidavit of one of defendants' officers. The Court granted 
summary judgment for defendants based on the failure to show an intent to price below costs. 475 U.S. at 594 n.19, aff'g Zenith 
Radio Corp. v. Matsushita Elec. Industries Co., 505 F. Supp. 1313 (E.D. Pa. 1981). Here, the Court's understanding of the 
transactions at issue and of Ken Carter's costs are based on the full record at trial. Moreover, plaintiff's expert freely admitted 
that his cost estimates were not based upon debts Ken Carter actually incurred."
1224,31," Dr. Buckley calculated the various components of average variable cost for 18 Ken Carter products in 1983 and 19 Ken Carter 
products in 1984. Plaintiff's exhibit 701A, at 7-A to 7-E; exhibit 701D, at A-9 and A-10. To calculate average variable cost 
exclusive of imputed interest, the trier-of-fact would subtract column ""l"" from column ""m."" Comparing this figure to the average 
selling price for each item, column ""c,"" only a few items are below average variable cost: the ""CLD-13"" colander, and ""MB-2"" and 
""MB-5"" mixing bowls in 1983, and the ""5108"" five-piece bowl set in 1984."
1224,32," Harold Burgeson, a hollowware buyer for Montgomery Wards, testified that the key item in the Vollrath line in 1983 was a six-
piece mixing bowl set; Burgeson stated that he might purchase the entire line based on the price of that item. Record at 7-42 to 
43. Carol Storn, Vollrath's director of marketing, also emphasized the importance of the five-piece bowl set in securing accounts 
of retailers. Record at 4B-44, 51, 55 and 56. There was no testimony as to the amount a hollowware distributor would have to 
cut prices on a bowl set in order to win an account. "
1225,33," Vollrath has argued that Sammi's anticompetitive intent in blocking the steamers is evidence of a specific intent to price below 
cost. The argument is that if Sammi had an intent to monopolize the market for steamers, a jury could infer that Sammi had 
intent to monopolize the market for bowls as well. The argument is untenable."
1225,34," The concern in Handgards -- that an attempt to enforce patent rights is not be considered clearly predatory conduct -- stems 
from an effort to reconcile the goals of the antitrust laws and the patent laws. A holder of a patent should neither be encouraged 
to invoke a patent to dampen competition, nor discouraged from invoking a patent out of fear of a claim of attempted 
monopolization. Thus, in Handgards, Inc. v. Ethicon, Inc., 601 F.2d 986, 996 (9th Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1025 (1980), 
the court held that a patentee's infringement action is presumptively in good faith, and to prevail on a Sherman Act claim, a 
plaintiff must prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that the patentee used the patent in bad faith, knowing the patent to be 
invalid. Although this case concerns rights granted by the Korean Metal Flatware Association, not the United States Patent Office, some 
of the concerns implicated in Handgards apply here. At a minimum, as a factual matter, HN15[
] the trier-of-fact cannot infer 
bad faith from defendant's invocation of legitimate design rights."
1225,35," For example, in an effort to prove that Sammi's design rights did not cover the Daelim steamer, plaintiff cites the testimony of 
Mr. Burgeson, a hollowware buyer for Montgomery Wards. Mr. Burgeson said that he ""liked the look"" of the Daelim steamer, that 
it ""had a gourmetish flavor"" and that other steamers ""didn't appeal to [him] as much."" Plaintiff's Opposition to Motion for JNOV at 
24. Several Vollrath employees echoed Mr. Burgeson's preference for the Daelim steamer. Despite the abundant testimony as to how Vollrath's steamer was aesthetically more pleasing than Sammi's steamer, plaintiff 
failed to introduce any evidence as to why Sammi's design rights would not cover the Vollrath product. Indeed, Vollrath's 
Manager of imported products, Ernest Keppler, candidly admitted that Vollrath and Daelim ""weren't even thinking of design 
registration"" in producing the competing steamer. Record at 5-170. "
1226,36," For example, plaintiff argued that Mr. Park, a member of the Association, admitted that an ""express purpose"" of the 
Association was to ""stop price competition."" Plaintiff's Opposition to Motion for JNOV at 25. This is an outright distortion of Mr. 
Park's testimony; Mr. Park stated that the purposes of the Association were to ensure product quality and compliance with the 
laws against dumping. Record at 11-182."
1226,37," Indeed, plaintiff admits that the chairman of the Korean Metal Flatware Association during the time of the steamer blockage 
was the president of Daelim, the manufacturer of Vollrath's steamer. Record at 6-32 to 33. Yet Vollrath's attorneys insisted, 
without a shred of evidence, that Sammi's power in Korea was so great that even Daelim would collapse under Sammi's 
pressure or that Sammi controlled all of the other members of the board. Moreover, if Sammi had such power, there is no 
explanation in the record as to why Sammi relented and ultimately permitted the Daelim steamer to be shipped."
1226,38," If Sammi did have monopoly power over steel production and used that power to prevent Daelim from entering the market to 
produce stainless steel steamers, that conduct would certainly be anticompetitive in Korea. However, the ""American antitrust 
laws do not regulate the competitive conditions of other nations' economies,"" Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 582. Thus, plaintiff would 
be required to prove how the harm to Daelim affected competition in the United States. "
1227,39," P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law: 1988 Supplement 574 (1988)."
1227,40," Thus, HN18[
] the cost based test applicable to predatory pricing claims under the Sherman Act also applies to Robinson-
Patman claims. A defendant's discriminatory pricing is presumptively predatory if the lower price set by defendant is below 
defendant's average variable cost; if the lower price is above average variable cost, however, the burden remains on plaintiff to 
prove that the price is predatory. Ultimately, however, the cost based test, as with the Sherman Act, merely serves to allocate 
the burden of proof on the issue of predation. A discriminatory price is predatory only if defendant justifies the price on the 
anticipated benefit of disciplining or eliminating competition. "
1228,41," Compare Dr. Buckley's calculation of the average variable cost to Ken Carter of selling a ""5108"" set in 1983 (less imputed 
interest) -- $ 6.27 -- to the price quoted to Target -- $ 5.00. Plaintiff's exhibit 701 A at C; plaintiff's exhibit 110."
1228,42," The following is Storn's complete testimony as to these events: We had extreme pricing pressure from Target and had to lower our prices to them as a result of it. The ultimate result was that 
every time we made a shipment to Target we were losing money, and the next thing that I did -- I went to see the buyer at Target 
in Minneapolis, and one of the things that I learned is that she was not going to add any other products to the line. They were strictly going to buy mixing bowls, and in effect that meant we had no opportunity to make up lost profits [on our 
mixing bowls], so I gave her a price increase. I was informed that they would look for another supplier and buy from us only if 
they had to, because they ran out of inventory in the meantime. Record at 4B-61. "
1229,43," Defendants also argue that judgment notwithstanding the verdict should be granted because Ken Carter proved that it was 
merely meeting competition by setting its five-piece bowl price at five dollars. Defendants' Reply to Opposition to Motion for 
JNOV at 23. HN20[
] It is an absolute defense to a charge of violating section 2(a) to show that defendant's pricing ""was a good faith effort to meet price competition."" William Inglis, 668 F.2d at 1045. Although Vollrath's Carol Storn admitted that Target's buyer told her that National Silver had offered its five-piece bowl set for $ 
4.90, a price lower than Ken Carter had offered, Record at 5-4 to 5, this testimony alone does not satisfy the demanding 
requirements for JNOV. Since the record does not reveal whether Ken Carter made its offer in response to National Silver or 
vice-versa, defendants have not established the meeting competition defense as a matter of law. Id."
1229,44," Plaintiff did not, and could not, allege that Sammi's sales of hollowware to Ken Carter on D/A terms contemporaneously with 
sales of hollowware to other importer/distributors on other terms violated section 2(a); a parent corporation may set prices more 
favorably to its subsidiary than to other buyers without violating the laws against discriminatory pricing. See Russ' Kwik Car 
Wash, Inc. v. Marathon Petroleum Co., 772 F.2d 214 (6th Cir. 1985)."
1229,45, See supra Part II.A.2.a. 
1230,46," HN21[
] Section 17043 states: It is unlawful for any person engaged in business within this State to sell any article at less than the cost thereof to such vendor . 
. . for the purpose of injuring competitors or destroying competition."
1230,47," HN22[
] Section 17044 states: It is unlawful for any person engaged in business within this State to seller use any article or product as a ""loss leader"" . . HN23[
] Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17030 defines a ""loss leader"" as: any article or product sold at less than cost: (a) Where the purpose is to induce, promote or encourage the purchase of other 
merchandise; . . . (c) Where the effect is to divert trade from or otherwise injure competitors."
1230,48," HN24[
] Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17026 sets forth the relevant definition of costs as to Ken Carter: ""Cost"" as applied to distribution means the invoice . . . cost of the article or product to the distributor and vendor, plus the cost of 
doing business by the distributor and vendor."
1230,49," In fact, only one plaintiff witness even addressed California. Mr. Kashuk, an employee of Metro, a competitor of both Vollrath 
and Sammi, testified that Mervyns, a San Francisco retailer, refused to purchase hollowware from Metro because ""[Mervyns 
could] continue to buy the goods from Ken Carter at 10 percent less than the price [Metro] had offered."" Record at 3PM-84 to 86. Kashuk's testimony only shows that Ken Carter offered to sell products below Metro's costs, not Ken Carter's costs. Moreover, 
even assuming that this testimony could support a finding of injury to Metro, plaintiff Vollrath cannot rest its case on injury to a 
competitor."
1230,50," Plaintiff never attempted to identify particular sales affecting California. Rather, plaintiff claimed that since Ken Carter 
eliminated Vollrath from competition and Vollrath serviced retailers which operated nationally, California must have been 
affected. Plaintiff has failed to establish, however, that Ken Carter's anticompetitive acts eliminated Vollrath. Therefore, plaintiff 
must make a specific showing of harm to California to prevail on the pendent claims."
1230,51," Sammi's costs would differ from those of Ken Carter; HN25[
] Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17026 states: ""Cost"" as applied to production includes the cost of raw materials, labor and all overhead expenses of the producer. To the extent that Sammi and Ken Carter are treated as a single economic entity, it would be more rational to use the cost of 
production in lieu of the invoice cost applicable to distributors. "
1231,52," Vollrath seized upon the nationalistic undercurrents of the dispute to sell its case to the jury. For example, in closing, plaintiff's 
attorney argued: What we are asking you to do is to find of course for Vollrath . . . but there is another message too. What we are really asking for 
is you [to] send a message to anyone who wishes to come into our country to do business here, people even in our country. 
Korea operates differently than us. You have heard Mr. Park testify that the design registration system committee concerned 
itself with price fixing. We don't do that in this country, at least not legally. That is fine. They can do that in Korea. When Koreans 
or anyone else come into this country [--] and we want them here -- when they come here they ought to obey our laws. They 
ought to obey the laws we have here. They ought to know those laws and they ought to honor them. All we are asking is that you 
give us what we deserve, but also send a message to anyone who wants to come into this country that they better do business 
by our laws, our way, if they want to come here. And then we will have a marketplace that we are all happier with and all the 
choice and all the variety that we want. And that's what we are seeking. Record of Proceedings on April 4, 1989 at 35-36. "
1236,1," Also before the Court is Stratton's motion for leave to file a supplemental brief. The Court GRANTS the motion and notes that 
the brief was filed simultaneously with the motion. It should be mentioned, that C&A has twice moved for dismissal of Stratton's antitrust counterclaim and once for summary 
judgment prior to the instant motion. Each of those motions was denied. However, in denying C&A's prior motions, none of the 
issues with which the Court is concerned today was involved. See, Orders, of June 25, 1982; December 31, 1982, and June 28, 
1985."
1236,2," Compo also had a antitrust counterclaim against C&A. However, in 1986 Compo and C&A settled their differences and a Order 
of Dismissal was entered by this Court on February 14, 1986."
1236,3," C&A articulates an alternative ground for summary judgment namely, that Stratton can not establish the necessary elements of 
its monopolization claim. The Court does not reach this issue since it dismisses Stratton's counterclaim on First Amendment 
grounds."
1236,4," Pandel, Inc., was incorporated in 1964 under the laws of Massachusetts. Pandel became Pandel-Bradford, Inc., in 1971. In 
1977, Pandel-Bradford merged with Compo Industries, Inc., a corporation of the State of Delaware. Compo thus succeeded to 
all the rights and obligations of Pandel. For purposes of this Order the Court will refer only to Compo in an effort to avoid 
confusion. With regard to the issues before the Court there is no legal distinction between Pandel and Compo. "
1238,5," See, Bernard Zuckerman's Deposition, April 6, 1989, at 34-56. Mr. Zuckerman is president of Stratton Industries."
1238,6," Obviously, the Delaware action did not assert any allegations of patent infringement since such claims are the sole prerogative 
of the federal courts. See, 28 U.S.C. § 1338. "
1239,7," The Court is not certain, but assumes that the complaint in the Delaware action has subsequently been dismissed."
1239,8," In discussing the antitrust counterclaims the Court in 1985 made the following observations: ""It took me a long, long time to fully understand what I finally ruled to be the law in this case with reference to the 
Chancellor's decision. If I recall correctly, we had a conference shortly after his decision and both sides felt like they had . . . won the case before 
the Chancellor. And then when his written order came out, it was a long time before we entered an order here that gave 
preclusive effect to what he had done. And even after we entered a written order and we had a conference before the trial, I labored mightily with this case in 
entering the motion for a directed verdict. And I've thought that I was right, else I would not have granted the motion, but I 
say that to simply point out that it has not been a simple case from the standpoint of the issues before the court."" Transcript of August 26, 1985, in chambers conference at 6. "
1240,9," The modification theory on which the Chancellor rested his ruling was neither briefed nor argued by either side despite the 
length of the post trial proceedings. Id. at 51."
1240,10," See, Order of Judgment entered in the Chancery Court of Delaware at 2-4 July 24, 1983. "
1241,11," See supra, at note 2. "
1242,12," It should be noted that the motion for directed verdict was made twice. The motion was first made at the conclusion of C&A's 
evidence on October 18, 1984. The parties argued the motion orally for several hours. The Court then took the motion under 
advisement, and the next morning denied it. That same day--October 19, 1984--Compo's attorney requested, and the Court 
granted him the right to reargue the motion. After several more hours of argument and deliberation, the Court concluded that the 
motion should be granted."
1242,13," Burton M. Gold, Stratton's Chief Executive Officer, testified that Stratton shipped uncut carpet tile in roll form on three different 
occasions in 1983. TR at 496-97. (Footnote added) "
1243,14," Stratton was already assured of receiving its attorney's fees pursuant to the indemnity agreement which Compo and Stratton 
signed on October 10, 1980. See supra, slip op. at 7-8. "
1244,15," The arguments advanced by Stratton in opposition to C&A's motion for summary judgment are in large measure identical to 
the arguments which Stratton and Compo asserted in their petition for attorneys fees. Namely, that C&A brought the Georgia 
action without evidence of infringement. See, Stratton's Brief in Support of Attorneys Fees at 13-17 (Nov. 13, 1984). "
1245,16," For example see, Allied Tube Corp. v. Indian Head, 486 U.S. 492, 100 L. Ed 2d 497, 505-06, 108 S. Ct. 1931 (1988); Noerr 
Motor, 365 U.S. at 138-39; Pennington, 381 U.S. at 669 (""Nothing could be clearer from the Court's opinion than that

only had anti-competitive motive.""); I.T.T. Corp. v. United Telephone Co., 550 F.2d 287, 289 (5th Cir. 1977) (per curiam). "
1246,17," The confluence of antitrust law and patent law presents the Court with ""two conflicting bodies of law"" Ethicon, Inc., 601 F.2d 
at 992. On the one hand, patent law is concerned with the creation of a statutory grant of monopoly power. On the other hand, 
the antitrust law is concerned with proscribing monopolistic power. The Ethicon court fully grasped this relationship when it 
wrote: The power to exclude, which is the essence of every patent, is monopoly power. Hence, 'any action to enforce a patent is in 
a very explicit sense exclusionary . . . .' The antitrust laws . . . proscribe certain types of exclusionary conduct that threaten 
or create monopoly power . . . . It therefore is necessary to reach accommodation between the patent and antitrust laws 
whenever antitrust liability is premised on a finding regarding a patentee's intent to monopolize . . . . To determine the 
existence of section 2 liability properly requires careful distinctions between lawful patent-related exclusionary conduct . . . 
and unlawful patent-related exclusionary conduct . . .; only unlawful patent related exclusionary conduct or intent is 
evidence of an intent to monopolize . . . . The task then is to 'identify the point at which . . . [an attempt to enforce a patent], 
always exclusionary in . . . [the] literal sense, . . . becomes so intractable as to warrant its being called exclusionary in the 
sense relevant to the establishment of a Section 2 violation . . . .' Id. at note 10 (citations omitted). "
1250,1," The Honorable Stephen N. Limbaugh, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Missouri."
1250,2," Before that time, the Morgans published a monthly nature-oriented tabloid. This tabloid did not seriously compete with the 
Prospect-News. "
1251,3," Trial testimony indicated that the $ 10 sales price was paid merely for use of the newspaper's name. Plaintiffs later sold off 
some of their equipment for approximately $ 1000."
1251,4," Newspaper space is typically computed in column inches. The newspapers published by both parties contained 172 column 
inches per page."
1251,5," Although defendants testified that they considered the 48 cent rate legally binding, there is no evidence of any formal contract 
executed between the county and the defendants. No formal bidding was conducted in later years. Shortly after the 1980 
bidding, plaintiffs unilaterally submitted to the county a second bid of 50 cents. Mr. Lipps testified that this was done to keep the 
Ozark Graphic's ""foot in the door"" in the event defendants later tried to raise their rate. Plaintiffs' newspaper, however, never 
received any legal advertising from the county."
1251,6," Defendants' pre-1980 rates for legal advertising varied according to the type of notice and the entity placing the notice. They 
charged public entities such as Ripley County a rate of $ 1.22 per column inch, which the parties claim was the maximum 
allowed by Missouri law at the time. Defendants charged rates of between $ 2.00 and $ 2.50 to individuals ordered by court or 
required by law to publish notices. Finally, they charged fixed prices for some types of standard notices such as probate 
settlement and adoption. "
1252,7," This merchant was Clayton Jamison, owner of Jamison's IGA. Jamison admitted, however, that no specific price was discussed 
during that conversation. Nor did Jamison switch his advertising to the Prospector at that time. He testified that he did not switch 
his advertising over to the Prospector until July 1982, after most of the other advertisers had already switched over. Shortly after 
Jamison's switch, plaintiffs ceased publication of the Ozark Shopper."
1252,8," This witness, Fred Long of Fred's Discount Store, testified he did not typically run printed ads. Rather, he printed his own 
circulars and inserted them into the Ozark Shopper at a rate of 3.5 to 4.0 cents per copy. The only evidence of the rate Long 
actually paid the Prospector for a similar arrangement after he switched over was his testimony that he paid ""nearly the same 
price."""
1252,9," Although Henry was a price discrimination case under the Robinson-Patman Act, we acknowledged there that the same basic 
principles apply in a case under section 2 of the Sherman Act. See Henry, 809 F.2d at 1345. "
1253,10," Defendants argue that plaintiffs presented no evidence of defendants' share of the relevant market, which they argue should 
include not only newspaper advertising but also other types of advertising such as direct mail, radio, and regional and national 
publications. In addition, defendants argue that because entry barriers to starting up a competing newspaper in the area are low, 
they lack the power to maintain monopoly prices. Because our holding disposes of the case on the issue of predatory conduct, we need not decide these issues. We do note, 
however, that at least one of the grocers testified that he perceived newspaper advertising as a more effective way of advertising 
than radio. Of course, legal advertising can be done only through newspapers. Finally, one cannot ignore the small size of the 
community and its limited number of advertisers and subscribers as important factors. It would not seem unreasonable to 
conclude that Ripley County could support, at most, two newspapers. See People's Press, Inc. v. Yazoo Publishing Co., 12 
Media L.Rep. (BNA) 1249, 1250 (S.D.Miss. 1985) (finding relevant product market in small community to be newspaper 
advertising and inserts). "
1254,11," Average variable cost is the sum of all variable costs--those costs that vary with output--divided by output. Average total cost 
is the sum of all costs, fixed and variable, divided by total output. Average total cost is, by definition, higher than average 
variable cost at all outputs. See 3 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law para. 712 (1978)."
1254,12," Mr. Mitchell identified only two cost categories as variable: printing and materials. He identified two other costs--labor and 
postage--as ""semivariable."" Semivariable costs are those that vary only indirectly with the volume of advertising. As Mr. Mitchell 
explained, for instance, the mere fact that it takes 10 workers to produce a newspaper typically containing ten pages does not 
mean that an additional worker is required to produce an 11-page newspaper. Mr. Mitchell's testimony and documentary support indicate that even when both variable and semivariable costs are considered, 
the resulting average per column inch ranged from 75 cents in 1981 to 68 cents in 1983. When only the variable costs are 
considered, the average was only 34 to 38 cents during those years. J.App.Vol. II at 381. Plaintiffs did not produce evidence 
suggesting alternative variable cost figures."
1254,13," Undisputed evidence, in fact, suggests that defendants' price quote to AG Market was competitively based. The $ 269 price 
was in line with the price defendants were charging their only two-page merchant advertiser at the time, Whittom's Big Star 
Market. Mrs. Ponder testified that a $ 300 price charged to Whittom's included not only a similar two-page ad, but also weekly 
printing of handbills. Further, plaintiffs admitted that the public's only knowledge of what the Ozark Shopper was charging AG 
Market before the switch came from its rate sheet indicating a rate of $ 307. Defendants claim that their quote to AG Market was 
designed to beat that price. Plaintiffs produced no evidence whatsoever to rebut this evidence. "
1255,14," Chester Ponder testified that at the 48 cent rate, a full page of legal advertising would produce a revenue of $ 82.56, whereas 
the per page printing cost was $ 34.56. He added that there was very little layout or composition involved since the notices were 
pre-printed, and because the ads often ran for two consecutive weeks, requiring no additional layout in the second week. Mr. 
Mitchell agreed that the Prospect-News' per page printing costs were lower than those of the Prospector."
1255,15," The figures Mr. Mitchell submitted indicate that the 48 cent rate would still have been above the aggregate of those costs he 
labeled as strictly ""variable."" However, it appears to fall below the sum of the variable costs and ""semivariable"" costs."
1255,16," Although plaintiffs produced evidence suggesting that defendants reduced prices on other types of legal advertising, they have 
focused their case on the 48 cent county ad rate. They cite no evidence suggesting that the estate settlement notices rate, or 
any other legal ad rate, was below average variable cost. "
1256,17," We appreciate the difficulty that plaintiffs face in attempting to isolate variable costs that are uniquely incurred to produce the 
product alleged to have been predatorily priced. See Marsann, 788 F.2d at 615-16 (Choy, J., concurring). This case, however, is 
unlike Marsann in that it does not involve merely a portion of output of a single, undifferentiated good. See id. at 614 n. 2. 
Rather, uncontested evidence indicates not only that legal advertising is distinct from and less costly to produce than items such 
as news reporting, but that it is also distinct from other types of advertising. Professors Areeda and Turner suggest that where it is difficult to isolate variable costs of particular products due to ""joint costs"" 
attributable to more than one product (sales, labor, administrative expenses, machinery) the plaintiff should be required to prove 
across-the-board predatory pricing. See 3 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law para. 719. ""Where virtually all costs are joint, 
predation can be tested only by comparing the combined prices of the several products with their aggregate marginal costs."" Id. 
(emphasis added). Here, plaintiffs seek the best of both worlds. They single out a particular item--Ripley County legal advertising--as allegedly 
priced below cost. Yet, they attempt to rely on inferences which, at most, would establish the variable cost of operations as a 
whole. Plaintiffs should be required to show that defendants' prices as a whole are below cost, or they should be required to 
isolate the variable (or incremental) costs attributable to Ripley County's legal ads and show that below-cost pricing of these 
legal ads had a significant anticompetitive effect. Plaintiffs have made neither of these showings. "
1257,18," The nature of a bidding process for a single customer, of course, is ""winner-take-all."" This at least was the assumption upon 
which both parties submitted bids. It seems quite speculative to hypothesize as to which party would have won the bidding at 
what price had no alleged predation occurred. On the other hand, a predator should not be entitled to benefit from such an 
uncertainty. Our assumption that the plaintiffs would have received the county business at its 98 cent bid is justified on this 
ground."
1257,19," Plaintiffs' counsel, at oral argument, acknowledged the possibility that Ripley County could support only one newspaper. "
1337,1," The FCC's initial decision was not entirely clear, but it was later clarified to require substantial interconnection. AT & T claimed 
that prior to the clarification it believed in good faith that the decision allowed only minimal interconnection. That interpretation "
1338,," was not only wrong, but the jury found that AT & T's interpretation was not in good faith.  Id. 708 F.2d at 1140-41. In this case, 
the FERC has adopted Panhandle's interpretation of its tariff as a sole supplier tariff, and has only ordered changes 
prospectively. See, Opinion No. 265, supra. "

to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly."
1375,2," The modified proposed order differs from the original proposed order in that the first ordering paragraph was replaced with two 
paragraphs. Rather than restraining continued action on all aspects of the transaction, the order would restrain Gillette from 
accepting any additional title, possession, or control over all or any part of the non-EC Wilkinson Sword wet shaving razor blade 
business without giving the Court and the Government at least twenty days advance notice in writing. Additionally, the proposed 
order would restrain defendants other than Gillette from transferring to Gillette any additional title, possession or control over all 
or any part of the non-EC Wilkinson Sword wet shaving razor blade business without giving the Court and the Government at 
least twenty days advance notice in writing."
1375,3," HN3[
] In this Circuit, the standard for granting a temporary restraining order has been held to be the same as for the 
issuance of a preliminary injunction: the plaintiffs must show it is likely to prevail on the merits, that it will suffer irreparable harm 
if the motion for the temporary restraining order is not granted, that other parties to the action will not suffer substantial harm if 
the temporary restraining order is issued, and that the public interest would be served by the granting of such relief. Howard

use in its decision whether or not to issue a temporary restraining order. Under § 13(b), the Court may grant a temporary 
restraining ""upon a proper showing that, weighing the equities and considering the Commission's likelihood of success, such 
action would be in the public interest."" "

1381,1," For purposes of their motion, defendants accept as true the allegations in the Third Amended Complaint (""the complaint"") 
except where defendants claim that the allegations are not adequately pled. The facts described herein are taken from the 
complaint except where otherwise indicated. "
1382,2," Defendants seek to have the allegations relating to Gasaway stricken from the complaint because they occurred prior to the 
limitations period. The Court rejects this request because pre-limitations evidence may be relevant to plaintiffs' proof of an 
antitrust conspiracy. See United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 600 F.2d 414, 417-18 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 884, 
100 S. Ct. 175, 62 L. Ed. 2d 114 (1979). Defendants also argue that the allegations concerning Imperial are unrelated to the 
allegations concerning D.J. Electric. This is a question of fact; it is not a ground for dismissing the complaint. "
1383,3," The Court is aware that an ""offer of judgment"" is, strictly speaking, an offer by a defendant. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 68. However, the 
parties and the Court in D.J. Electric referred to a settlement offer made by the plaintiff as an offer of judgment. "
1385,4," Defendants have not argued that the reason they did not raise their claim-splitting objection earlier was that the lack of a final 
judgment made them unable to do so. On the contrary, defendants argued in their opening brief that the lack of a final judgment 
in D.J. Electric did not prevent application of the prohibition against claim-splitting. In Walton v. Eaton Corp., 563 F.2d 66, 70 (3d 
Cir. 1977), the court stated: It is clear that [the plaintiff] had no right to maintain two separate actions involving the same subject matter at the same time 
in the same court and against the same defendant. United States v. Haytian Republic, 154 U.S. 118, 123-23, 14 S. Ct. 992, 
38 L. Ed. 930 (1894); Sutcliffe Storage & Warehouse Co. v. United States, 162 F.2d 849, 851, 125 Ct. Cl. 297 (1st Cir. 
1947) (Clark, J., sitting by designation); 1A J. Moore, Federal Practice para. 0.219 at 2601 (2d ed. 1974); P. Bator, P. 
Mishkin, D. Shapiro & H. Wechsler, Hart & Wechsler's The Federal Courts and the Federal System 1232-33 (2d ed. 1973). When the district court became aware that the two actions begun by [the plaintiff] were virtually identical, it could have 
dismissed her second complaint without prejudice or it could have stayed proceedings in the second action until judgment 
was entered in the first. See also Oxbow Energy, Inc. v. Koch Industries, Inc., 686 F. Supp. 278 (D.Kan. 1988) (dismissing second action where similar 
first action was pending). "
1386,5," Petromanagement provides as much support for plaintiffs as it does for defendants, for it also holds that a plaintiff's efforts to 
consolidate the cases do not estop it from denying the application of res judicata. 835 F.2d at 1334. The procedural history in 
Petromanagement is very similar to the history of this case. The court in Petromanagement held that res judicata did apply to 
preclude plaintiff from prosecuting the second action. That decision is unhelpful here, however, because the plaintiff apparently 
did not raise, and the court did not address, the issue of acquiescence arising from failure to timely raise the res judicata 
defense."
1386,6," Accord, Kern Oil, supra, 840 F.2d at 734, 735 (9th Cir. 1988); Calderon, supra, 805 F.2d at 1087; Kendall, supra, 711 F. Supp. 
at 1181-82. Defendants' failure to raise the res judicata defense in their motion to dismiss or for summary judgment, at the latest, may also 
constitute a waiver under Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(c). Rule 8(c) provides that res judicata is an affirmative defense which must be set forth 
in pleading to the complaint. It has thus been held that failure to assert res judicata as an affirmative defense constitutes a 
waiver. See Kern Oil, 840 F.2d at 735; Evans v. Syracuse City School Dist., 704 F.2d 44, 48 (2d Cir. 1983) (failure to attempt to 
amend answer to include res judicata defense for two years and nine months after defense became available constituted 
waiver). See also Rule 12(g) (generally, ""if a party makes a motion under this rule but omits therefrom any defense or objection 
then available to the party which this rule permits to be raised by motion, the party shall not thereafter make a motion based on 
the defense or objection so omitted""). However, because plaintiff has not asserted waiver under Rule 8(c), and because the 
Court finds that defendant has acquiesced under common law principles, the Court does not reach this issue. "
1387,7," Although the Court uses the term ""defendants"" to describe the actors who allegedly performed the acts complained of (in order 
to be consistent with plaintiffs' complaint), it is not generally clear which defendants performed which acts. Indeed, the complaint 
states with typical vagueness: ""The Trades Council is alleged to be a defendant in its individual capacity as an organization and 
collectively as a group of member Local Unions each of whom is alleged to have committed the acts, individually, severally and 
as agent for each other, as set forth throughout this complaint."" (Complaint para. 9.) Defendants argue that this ""attempt to 
impute responsibility for the Local 96 and 701 picketing actions by mere membership in the Building Trades Council . . . is a 
mutated version of the 'mass action theory' of liability, expressly rejected by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Consolidation 
Coal Co. v. Local 2216 UMW, 779 F.2d 1274 (1985)."" (Mem. at 6 n.7.) It is not clear that plaintiffs are relying on the ""mass 
action"" theory, which arose in the context of the liability of local unions or union officials for strikes rather than the liability of a 
trades council for the actions of its member unions. However, even if plaintiffs are relying on a ""mass action theory,"" the Seventh 
Circuit did not reject that theory -- it merely rejected the notion of presumed agency. The court recognized that ""mass action can 
be used . . . in establishing common law agency liability,"" but it stated that it must be proven that the defendant union ""had a 
material role in precipitating the strike,"" i.e., ""it must be shown union officials encouraged or ratified the strike in some way before 
they are held liable for a strike caused by their members."" 779 F.2d at 1277. Here, plaintiffs have alleged that each defendant 
participated in every act complained of, either itself or through principles of agency. (If plaintiffs intend otherwise, they should 
once again amend their complaint.) Although this may be difficult to prove, plaintiffs are entitled to make such an allegation 
assuming they have paid heed to Fed.R.Civ.P. 11."
1387,8," For the most part, the parties do not distinguish between the three counts in presenting their arguments. Accordingly, the Court 
will not do so either. "
1388,9," For example, plaintiffs argue that the master collective bargaining agreement of the Engineers Local 150 contains the following 
provision: ""The Employer agrees that he will not contract or sub-contract any work covered by the Scope of Work of this 
Agreement and/or work coming under the Occupational Jurisdiction of the Union to be done at the site of construction, alteration, 
painting, or repair of a building, structure, or other work, except to a person, firm or corporation, party to the applicable current 
labor agreement with the Union."" (Resp. at 15 n. 14.)"
1388,10," MARBA can be read as holding simply that collective bargaining agreements concerning subjects of mandatory bargaining are 
insufficient to remove the statutory exemption without even reaching the five-part inquiry described below. The court did not 
expressly adopt the five-part inquiry, but rather stated that some courts have used it. 675 F.2d at 886-88. See also Suburban 
Tile Center, Inc. v. Rockford Bldg. and Const. Trades Council, 354 F.2d 1, 3 (7th Cir. 1965) (""A construction subcontracting 
agreement has been held to be a mandatory subject of collective bargaining.""), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 960, 86 S. Ct. 1585, 16 L. 
Ed. 2d 673 (1966). "
1392,11," In MARBA, the Seventh Circuit reviewed the history of the nonstatutory exemption and stated the test as follows: ""[A] 
complaint must allege conduct operating as a direct restraint upon the business market in order to avoid application of the 
nonstatutory exemption. Restraints operating primarily upon the business [sic: labor] market will fall within the scope of the 
exemption, regardless of any indirect effect they may be alleged to have upon commercial competition."" 675 F.2d at 893. See 
also Larry V. Muko, Inc. v. Southwestern Penn. Bldg. and Const. Trades Council, 609 F.2d 1368, 1373 (3d Cir. 1979) (""We 
understand Connell to hold, then, that an agreement between a union and a business organization, outside a collective 
bargaining relationship, which imposes a direct restraint upon a business market, and which is not justified by congressional 
labor policy because it has actual or potential anticompetitive effects that would not flow naturally from the elimination of 
competition over wages and working conditions, is not exempt from antitrust scrutiny."")."
1392,12," HN10[
] Section 8(e) provides: It shall be an unfair labor practice for any labor organization and any employer to enter into any contract or agreement, express or implied, whereby such employer ceases or refrains or agrees to cease or refrain from 
handling, using, selling, transporting or otherwise dealing in any of the products of any other employer, or to cease doing 
business with any other person, and any contract or agreement entered into heretofore or hereafter containing such an 
agreement shall be to such extent unenforceable and void: Provided, That nothing in this subsection shall apply to an agreement 
between a labor organization and an employer in the construction industry relating to the contracting or subcontracting of work to 
be done at the site of the construction, alteration, painting, or repair of a building, structure, or other work. . . .)"
1392,13," The defendant union had argued that ""the kind of agreement it obtained from [the contractor] is explicitly allowed by the 
construction-industry proviso to § 8(e) and that antitrust policy must therefore defer to the NLRA."" 421 U.S. at 626, 95 S. Ct. at 
1837. The Court rejected this argument because it found the agreement was not protected by the proviso without discussing 
whether an agreement within the scope of the proviso is automatically exempt from the antitrust laws. "
1393,14," The relevant portion of HN11[
] § 8(f) provides: It shall not be an unfair labor practice under subsections (a) and (b) of this section for an employer engaged primarily in the 
building and construction industry to make an agreement covering employees engaged (or who, upon their employment, 
will be engaged) in the building and construction industry with a labor organization of which building and construction 
employees are members (not established, maintained, or assisted by any action defined in subsection (a) of this section as 
an unfair labor practice) because (1) the majority status of such labor organization has not been established under the 
provisions of section 159 of this title prior to the making of such an agreement . . . Provided, That nothing in this subsection 
shall set aside the final proviso to subsection (a)(3) of this section: Provided further, That any agreement which would be 
invalid, but for clause (1) of this subsection, shall not be a bar to a petition filed pursuant to section 159(c) or 159(d) of this 
title. For descriptions of the background and effect of § 8(f), see Mesa Verde Const. Co. v. Northern California Dist. Council of 
Laborers, 861 F.2d 1124 (9th Cir. 1988); John Deklewa & Sons, 282 NLRB No. 184, 124 L.R.R.M. 1185 (1988), benf'd, Int'l 
Ass'n of Bridge, Structural and Ornamental Iron Workers, Local 3 v. NLRB, 843 F.2d 770 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 889, 
109 S. Ct. 222, 102 L. Ed. 2d 213 (1988). "
1394,15," This does not mean, of course, that defendants' conduct is necessarily legal as a matter of labor law. See Deklewa & Sons, 
supra, 124 LRRM at 1194 (""an employer cannot be coerced, through strikes or picketing, into negotiating or adopting an 8(f) 
agreement""). See also Donald Schriver, supra, 635 F.2d at 868."
1394,16," This factor is not determinative in itself. In A.L. Adams, supra, the court held that a construction manager may take advantage 
of § 8(f) even though it does not employ construction workers. 733 F.2d at 857-58. "
1395,17," Defendants also argue that the complaint fails to state a claim under the antitrust laws, contending that the antitrust laws do 
not govern the elimination of competition based on wages and working conditions. This argument, however, is not analytically 
distinct from the arguments based on the labor exemptions to the antitrust laws, and it does not merit separate discussion. "
1399,*," The Honorable Leonard I. Garth, Senior United States Circuit Judge for the Third Circuit, sitting by designation."
1399,1," Caswell apparently was a partner with Palermo in the Sevens Co., another oil and gas related entity. See rec. vol. I, doc. 103 
(loan application dated 3/19/82)."
1399,2," The bank was declared insolvent in July 1986, and the FDIC was appointed receiver. FDIC-Receiver, FDIC-Corporate and First 
Interstate Bank and Trust Co. entered into a purchase and assumption agreement. As part of that transaction, FDIC-Receiver 
sold the asset in question (the Palermo consolidated note) to FDIC-Corporate. "
1400,3," At the time of the consolidation the balance of the Palermo note was approximately $ 381,000 and the balance of the Cup note 
was approximately $ 260,000. "
1408,1," Other issues arising from this case and its predecessor action, Case No. 60 C 890, are pending on appeal before the United 
States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit."
1408,2," Clark objects that the surveys discussed here are inadmissible hearsay and thus cannot be considered by this court under Fed. 
R. Civ. Pro. 56(e). However, much of the relevant information from the surveys goes to whether Clark had a conscious 
commitment to a scheme to deprive its aftermarket competitors of Clark's lower prices, and thus is admissible under Fed. R. Ev. 
803(3). In any event, LPM has presented other evidence independent of the survey data from which a reasonable mind could 
infer conspiracy and which tends to exclude the possibility of independent action. "
1409,3," LPM contends in picayune fashion that the term ""will-fitter"" is derogatory because it implies that a supplier sells parts that ""will 
fit but are not really right."" (Reply of Lift Parts to Clark's Motion for Summary Judgment on LPM's Disparagement Claim, at 2.) 
Even though the court does not necessarily agree with LPM's argument, the court in this opinion will avoid the term ""will-fitter,"" 
instead referring to independent suppliers of truck parts as ""independents."""
1409,4," In one instance Clark noted that a vendor had classified LPM as an OEM, but nonetheless was selling to them at a service 
price. (Defendant's Exhibit 157, p. 64.)"
1409,5," Federal Mogul's survey form notes: ""Have requested a meeting be set up to discuss selling to LPM as O.E.M."" Another line of 
the form notes, ""Vendor has reevaluated LPM & has reclassified LPM as a [distributor] and will be handle [sic] by their 
aftermarket grp. to insure [distributor] prices."" "
1410,6," The court realizes that LPM has alleged that Clark conspired with scores of vendors in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman 
Act. In opposition to Clark's motion for summary judgment, though, LPM has failed to address individually all of these 
conspiracies. It is impossible for this court to make determinations of the sufficiency of the evidence with regard to each of these 
conspiracies at this stage. However, the court of course will entertain a motion for directed verdict by Clark at trial regarding 
conspiracies which LPM fails to prove. "
1411,7," Specifically, LPM has presented evidence which viewed in LPM's favor tends to prove that Clark and some of its vendors ""had 
a conscious commitment to a common scheme designed to achieve an unlawful objective."" Spray-Rite, 465 U.S. at 764, 104 S. 
Ct. at 1471, quoting Edward J. Sweeney & Sons, 637 F.2d 105, 111 (3rd Cir. 1980). "
1412,8," According to Clark, broad-line distributors are entities that sell a relatively wide range of Clark parts and provide technical and 
merchandising assistance. Apparently, such distributors are ""one-stop shops"" -- viz a dealer can get most of his parts at that one 
shop."
1412,9," Although LPM's counterclaim and subsequent interrogatory answers allege other markets, LPM presents evidence only with 
regard to this market, defined by its expert, Howard Kitt."
1412,10," Clark contends that these holdings are limited to cases where ""a manufacturer has market power in the primary product"" (viz. 
lift trucks) or where ""sellers of replacement parts must limit themselves to that manufacturer's brand because of distinct 
engineering problems that prevent them from selling for other brands."" (Plaintiff's Reply at 14.) However, not only does the case 
law cited by Clark fail to demonstrate such a rule with two clean exceptions, even if it did, application of these rules again would 
require this court to draw factual inferences which are inappropriate on a motion for summary judgment. "
1413,11," The copy of the Balanchuk Deposition filed by LPM with this court has no page numbers. The court hopes that LPM's counsel 
will be more careful in future submissions. Such actions, whether the result of negligence (as the court believes this is) or of 
design (as the court construes the acts discussed in footnote 12, infra), place further and needless burdens on court personnel. 
The court refers here to the 18th and 19th pages of the deposition as submitted."
1413,12," In opposition to Clark's motion for summary judgment, LPM has flooded this court with several thousand pages of documents, 
most of which LPM never argues or even refers to in its briefs. The documents referred to by LPM in its briefs are sufficient to 
withstand Clark's motion for summary judgment. The sheer volume of additional documents alone does not, as LPM may have 
hoped, convince this court that genuine issues of material fact exist in this case. To the contrary, burdening this court with an 
avalanche of additional documents to which no reference is made by any party constitutes abusive and disrespectful conduct. 
The court hopes LPM's new lead counsel, Mr. Montgomery, will put an end to such abuses toward opposing counsel and the 
court. "
1414,13," As affirmative evidence, LPM's memorandum in opposition to Clark's motion cites only three exhibits demonstrating that Clark 
distinguishes between the wholesale and retail markets (Defendant's Exhibits 307, 259, and 50). (LPM's Opposition 
Memorandum at 4-5.) Similarly, LPM's Supplemental Memorandum cites only the deposition testimony of Lawrence Mika, 
Clark's General Parts Manager for the Industrial Truck Division. Mika testified that some of the parts and categories of parts 
listed in Defendant's Exhibit 1701 were not interchangeable, some had different prices, and that some were produced by 
different suppliers. (Mika Dep. at 249-250.) This conclusory evidence is individually addressed to none of the myriad markets 
alleged by LPM, and thus falls far short of the evidence required to withstand a motion for summary judgment."
1414,14," Paragraph 37 alleges, ""Clark and its co-conspirators have falsely disparaged LPM, other independents and the parts which 
they market."" Paragraph 38 alleges, ""The acts of Clark alleged in paragraphs 26-37 are among the methods by which the 
conspiracy hereinbefore alleged was entered into and is being implemented."" Paragraph 48 alleges, ""The acts described in 
paragraphs 26-42 of these counterclaims were engaged in by Clark with the specific intent to monopolize."" "
1415,15," LPM points to only three instances of ""disparagement."" First, Clark used the term ""Gypo Joe"" to describe independents who 
do not have access to Clark's parts numbers. (Exhibit 22 slide 012424.1(37), attached to LPM's Mem. in Opposition.) The term 
""Gypo Joe"" is not a representation of fact, and never does LPM claim that the statement that independents do not have access 
to Clark's parts numbers is untrue. Second, in a letter to a Clark dealer, Harry Otis, Clark's General Parts and Service Manager, 
stated ""We must sell such things as fear that a will-fitter's part will fail and cause a liability accident. We should make cross 
sections, such as contractor tips, and show the basic differences of construction."" (Letter from Harry Otis to Paul Kindschy, 1-15-
81, attached to LPM's Mem. in Opposition.) This statement, however, is similar to ""[a]dvertising that emphasizes a product's 
strengths and minimizes its weaknesses,"" and as such ""does not, at least unless it amounts to deception, constitute 
anticompetitive conduct violative of § 2."" USFL, 1986-1 Trade Cases at 62,546. Finally, Clark referred to its independent 
competitors as ""will-fitters."" (LPM's Mem. in Opposition, at 2.) This characterization as well is not a misstatement of fact, but 
merely an allegedly unflattering epithet."
1415,16," As in the USFL case, evidence of Clark's allegedly derogatory comments about LPM may be admissible at trial as probative of 
Clark's intent, or of the purpose or character of Clark's alleged anticompetitive conduct."
1415,17," See footnote 15, supra."
1415,18," LPM notes that Clark's motion does not raise or address whether such disparagement can be evidence of some other, as yet 
undefined, conduct which itself violates the antitrust laws. (Defendant's Response, at 3.) However, because LPM has failed to 
identify such conduct, this court cannot rule on the relevance of Clark's allegedly disparaging statements to this conduct. "
1417,19," Pacific Union Conference of Seventh-Day Adventists v. Marshall, 434 U.S. 1305, 1306, 98 S. Ct. 2, 3 (1977) merely states that 
under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) a district court may certify a question for interlocutory review by the court of appeals. Texaco, Inc. v. "
1418,," Cottage Hill Operating Co., 709 F.2d 452, 453 (7th Cir. 1983) held only that the Seventh Circuit had no power to review denial of 
a particular motion to dismiss."
1418,20," For example, Diaz v. Indian Head, Inc., 686 F.2d 558, 562-563 (7th Cir. 1982) indeed states that a federal district court judge 
may correct an earlier interlocutory ruling by another district judge which he or she finds to be erroneous. However, the court 
cautioned that the second judge should do so ""when convinced that its law of the case is substantially erroneous."" Id., 686 F.2d 
at 563, quoting 1B J. Moore, J. Lucas & T. Currier, Moore's Federal Practice para. 0.404 [4.-2], at 127-129 (2d ed. 1984). 
Similarly, the district court in Alvarez v. Wilson, 600 F. Supp. 706, 708 (N.D. Ill. 1985) disturbed the ruling of a judge previously 
assigned to a case only upon presentation of ""very good reason for doing so"" -- in that case, an intervening Supreme Court 
precedent. See also Kirby v. P.R. Mallory & Co., Inc., 489 F.2d 904, 913 (7th Cir. 1973) (discovery of crucial new evidence 
warranted reconsideration); Lindsey v. Dayton-Hudson Corp., 592 F.2d 1118, 1121 (10th Cir. 1979) (""A second motion for 
summary judgment is proper after a prior motion is dismissed, if supported by new material."" [emphasis added]). "

1435,9," The FTC found: ""'The city's purchase of CJA legal services for indigents is based on competition.  The price offered by the city is based on 
competition, because the city must attract a sufficient number of individual lawyers to meet its needs at that price.  The city 
competes with other purchasers of legal services to obtain an adequate supply of lawyers, and the city's offering price is an 
element of that competition.  Indeed, an acknowledgement of this element of competition is implicit in the respondents' argument 
that an increase in the CJA fee was 'necessary to attract, and retain, competent lawyers.' If the offering price had not attracted a 
sufficient supply of qualified lawyers willing to accept CJA assignments for the city to fulfill its constitutional obligation, then 
presumably the city would have increased its offering price or otherwise sought to make its offer more attractive.  In fact, 
however, the city's offering price before the boycott apparently was sufficient to obtain the amount and quality of legal services 
that it needed.'"" 272 U.S. App. D. C., at 278, 856 F.2d, at 232. The Court of Appeals agreed with this analysis: ""The Commission correctly determined that the CJA regulars act as 'competitors' in the only sense that matters for antitrust 
analysis: They are individual business people supplying the same service to a customer, and as such may be capable, through a 
concerted restriction on output, of forcing that customer to pay a higher price for their service.  That the D. C. government, like 
the buyers of many other services and commodities, prefers to offer a uniform price to all potential suppliers does not alter in any 
way the anti-competitive potential of the petitioners' boycott. The antitrust laws do not protect only purchasers who negotiate 
each transaction individually, instead of posting a price at which they will trade with all who come forward.  Nor should any 
significance be assigned to the origin of the demand for CJA services; here the District may be compelled by the Sixth 
Amendment to purchase legal services, there it may be compelled by the voters to purchase street paving services.  The reason 
for the government's demand for a service is simply irrelevant to the issue of whether the suppliers of it have restrained trade by 
collectively refusing to satisfy it except upon their own terms.  We therefore conclude, as did the Commission, that the petitioners 
engaged in a 'restraint of trade' within the meaning of Section 1."" Id., at 281, 856 F.2d, at 235 (footnote omitted). "
1437,10," In [Claiborne Hardware] we held that the First Amendment protected the nonviolent elements of a boycott of white merchants 
organized by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and designed to make white government and 
business leaders comply with a list of demands for equality and racial justice.  Although the boycotters intended to inflict 
economic injury on the merchants, the boycott was not motivated by any desire to lessen competition or to reap economic 
benefits but by the aim of vindicating rights of equality and freedom lying at the heart of the Constitution, and the boycotters were 
consumers who did not stand to profit financially from a lessening of competition in the boycotted market.  Id., at 914-915. Here, 
in contrast, petitioner was at least partially motivated by the desire to lessen competition, and, because of petitioner's line of 
business, stood to reap substantial economic benefits from making it difficult for respondent to compete."" Allied Tube & Conduit 
Corp., 486 U.S., at 508-509. "
1438,11," LEdHN[10B][
] [10B] Respondents contend that, just as the Claiborne Hardware boycott sought to secure constitutional rights to equality and 
freedom, the lawyers' boycott sought to vindicate the Sixth Amendment rights of indigent defendants.  Claiborne Hardware, 
however, does not protect every boycott having a constitutional dimension.  Indeed, insofar as respondents seek immunity from 
prosecution on the basis of their good intent, their theory of defense ""is merely another variety of an age-old argument."" See 
United States v. Cullen, 454 F.2d 386, 392 (CA7 1971). Claiborne Hardware does not, and could not, establish a rule 
immunizing from prosecution any boycott based upon sincere constitutional concerns.  Such an exemption would authorize the 
government's contractors in nearly all areas to circumvent antitrust law on the basis of their own theory of the government's 
obligations."

rules in part is to avoid a burdensome inquiry into actual market conditions in situations where the likelihood of anticompetitive 
conduct is so great as to render unjustified the costs of determining whether the particular case at bar involves anticompetitive 
conduct.  See, e.g., Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Society, 457 U.S. 332, 350-351 (1982)."" Id., at 15-16, n. 25.  The Court 
of Appeals overlooked the words ""in part"" in that footnote, and also overlooked the statement in text that ""there must be a 
substantial potential for impact on competition in order to justify per se condemnation."" Id., at 16.  As the following paragraph 
from its opinion demonstrates, the Court of Appeals incorrectly assumed that the per se rule against price fixing is ""only"" a rule of 
administrative convenience: ""The antitrust laws permit, but do not require, the condemnation of price fixing without proof of market power; even the per se 
rule, as the Commission acknowledges in its brief, is only a rule of 'administrative convenience and efficiency,' not a statutory 
command.  FTC Brief at 39; see Jefferson Parish Hospital Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 15 n. 25 (1984). While the rule may 
occasionally be overinclusive, condemning the ineffectual with the harmful, there is no known danger that socially beneficial 
arrangements will be prohibited, for price-fixing agreements rarely, if ever, have redeeming virtues.  As for the hapless but 
harmless, as Professor Areeda has noted, defendants charged with conspiring to fix prices 'have little moral standing to demand 
proof of power or effect when the most they can say for themselves is that they tried to harm the public but were mistaken in 
their ability to do so.' VII P. Areeda, Antitrust Law para. 1509 at 411 (1986)."" 272 U.S. App. D. C., at 295, 856 F.2d, at 249. "

dangerous to society.  The conceivable social benefits are few in principle, small in magnitude, speculative in occurrence, and 
always premised on the existence of price-fixing power which is likely to be exercised adversely to the public.  Moreover, 
toleration implies a burden of continuous supervision for which the courts consider themselves ill-suited.  And even if power is 
usually established while any defenses are not, litigation will be complicated, condemnation delayed, would be price-fixers 
encouraged to hope for escape, and criminal punishment less justified.  Deterrence of a generally pernicious practice would be 
weakened.  The key points are the first two.  Without them, there is no justification for categorical condemnation."" 7 P. Areeda,

] [3F] In response to JUSTICE BRENNAN's opinion, and particularly to its observation that some concerted arrangements that might 
be characterized as ""group boycotts"" may not merit per se condemnation, see post, at 452, n. 9, we emphasize that this case 
involves not only a boycott but also a horizontal price-fixing arrangement -- a type of conspiracy that has been consistently 
analyzed as a per se violation for many decades.  All of the ""group boycott"" cases cited in JUSTICE BRENNAN's footnote 
involved nonprice restraints.  There was likewise no price-fixing component in any of the boycotts listed on pages 446-448 of 
JUSTICE BRENNAN's opinion.  Indeed, the text of the opinion virtually ignores the price-fixing component of respondent's 
concerted action."
1442,20," On remand, the Court of Appeals should review respondents' objections to the form of the order entered by the Commission.  
See 272 U.S. App. D. C., at 299, 856 F.2d, at 253."
1442,1," I join Parts I, II, III, and IV of the Court's opinion, although, as discussed further infra, I do not agree that the unreasonableness 
of the pre-boycott rates of compensation and the fact that the Trial Lawyers enjoyed no other effective means of making 
themselves heard are irrelevant to the proper analysis.  Compare ante, at 421-422. "
1443,2," I disagree with the Court that the government's interest in employing the per se rule here is a substantial one.  The per se rule's 
conceded service of the goals of administrative efficiency and judicial economy cannot justify its application to activity protected 
by the First Amendment. ""The First Amendment does not permit the State to sacrifice speech for efficiency."" Riley v. National 
Federation of Blind of N. C., Inc., 487 U.S. 781, 795 (1988). See also Schneider v. State, 308 U.S. 147, 161, 164 (1939). Insofar 
as the per se rule is thought warranted by a speculation that even relatively small boycotts or those without market power might 
nonetheless inflict some measure of economic harm, see ante, at 434-436, the rule can be applied in ordinary antitrust cases 
where First Amendment freedoms are not implicated.  In such cases, ""'the conceivable social benefits [of the conduct under 
scrutiny] are few in principle, small in magnitude, [and] speculative in occurrence.'"" Ante, at 434, n. 16 (quoting 7 P. Areeda, 
Antitrust Law para. 1509, pp. 412-413 (1986)).  But where an expressive boycott is at issue, the same cannot be said; the First 
Amendment establishes that the social benefits involved are not ""small in magnitude"" or ""speculative in occurrence."" Hence, 
even if it were possible that a boycott without market power might cause anticompetitive effects -- a dubious proposition, since "
1444,," by definition market power is the ability to alter prices -- the government still should be required to proceed under the rule of 
reason and demonstrate that such effects are actually present in the case sub judice."
1444,3," In United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968), the Court held: ""When 'speech' and 'nonspeech' elements are combined in 
the same course of conduct, a sufficiently important governmental interest in regulating the nonspeech element can justify 
incidental restrictions on First Amendment freedoms. . . .  We think it clear that a government regulation is sufficiently justified if it 
is within the constitutional power of the Government; if it furthers an important or substantial governmental interest; if the 
governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression; and if the incidental restriction on alleged First 
Amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest."" Id., at 376-377. "
1445,4," The Court quotes the finding of the FTC Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) that there was no evidence that the District 
government's decision to raise CJA compensation rates responded to the Trial Lawyers' campaign or to public pressure 
generally.  See ante, at 416-417.  The majority, however, conveniently omits the Court of Appeals' answer to this finding by the 
ALJ: ""The Commission did not reach the question and rejected the ALJ's findings except insofar as it expressly adopted them."" 
272 U.S. App. D. C., at 297, 856 F.2d, at 251. By implication, therefore, the Commission rejected the trial examiner's finding on 
this point. "
1446,5," Groups testifying in favor of the bill included the SCTLA, District of Columbia Bar, D. C. Chapter of the National Lawyers Guild, 
Public Defender Service, D. C. Chapter of the Washington Psychiatric Society, Family Law Association, National Capitol Area 
Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, and National Center of Institutional Alternatives.  See App. in No. 86-1465 
(CADC), pp. 800-801. "
1447,6," Even the criminal law, however, provides procedural safeguards to ensure that laws are not applied in an overbroad fashion to 
punish activity protected by the First Amendment. The defendant in a criminal trial is always able to raise the defense that the 
law is unconstitutional as applied to him.  See, e. g., Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989). Application of the per se rule in the 
instant case denies the Trial Lawyers even this opportunity."
1447,7," If a boycott uses economic power in an unlawful way to send a message, it cannot claim First Amendment protection from the 
antitrust laws, any more than a terrorist could use an act of violence to express his political views and then assert immunity from 
criminal prosecution.  Thus, if a cartel in a regulated industry inflicts economic injury on consumers by raising prices in order to 
communicate with the government, it still would be subject to the per se rule. The instant case is different: there is a genuine 
question whether the SCTLA boycott involved any economic coercion at all.  That is why a showing of market power is 
necessary before the boycott can be condemned as an unfair method of competition. "
1448,8," The lawyers actively courted press coverage of their strike.  They set up ""picket lines,"" distributed press kits, and granted 
interviews; the media, both local and national, responded.  No fewer than 19 newspaper articles regarding the boycott appeared 
in the Washington Post, Washington Times, USA Today, and New York Times.  The Washington Post's editorial page endorsed 
the boycott, opining that ""it is simply unfair that these fees have remained unchanged during a period when median income in 
the area has risen over 180 percent."" Washington Post, Sept. 8, 1983, p. A20, col. 1.  The New York Times reported that ""the 
unusual thing about the lawyer's . . . job action is that almost no one disagrees with their argument."" N. Y. Times, Sept. 1, 1983, 
p. B10, col. 3.  United States District Judge Harold H. Greene wrote that the Trial Lawyers ""should receive the modest increase 
they have requested."" Washington Post, Sept. 12, 1983, p. A13, col. 2.  Even the Economist of London carried a story on the 
boycott. Sept. 17, 1983, p. 25.  Nor was coverage limited to the print media.  Local television and radio stations aired numerous 
reports of the boycott, and an account of the Trial Lawyers' plight appeared on the CBS Morning News.  See App. in No. 86-
1465 (CADC), pp. 921, 923, 925, 937, 949. "
1449,9," Although ""group boycotts"" often are listed among the types of activity meriting per se condemnation, see. e. g., Silver v. New 
York Stock Exchange, 373 U.S. 341, 348 (1963); White Motor Co. v. United States, 372 U.S. 253, 259-260 (1963); Klor's, Inc. v.

U.S. 531, 543 (1978). In fact, ""'there is more confusion about the scope and operation of the per se rule against group boycotts 
than in reference to any other aspect of the per se doctrine.'"" Northwest Wholesale Stationers, Inc. v. Pacific Stationery & 
Printing Co., 472 U.S. 284, 294 (1985) (quoting L. Sullivan, Law of Antitrust 229-230 (1977)).  We have observed that ""the 
category of restraints classed as group boycotts is not to be expanded indiscriminately, and the per se approach has generally 
been limited to cases in which firms with market power boycott suppliers or customers in order to discourage them from doing 
business with a competitor."" FTC v. Indiana Federation of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 458 (1986). These considerations provide 
additional reason to analyze the instant case with great care, because the Trial Lawyers' boycott is certainly sui generis. "
1450,*," This Court's recent decision in Mallard v. United States District Court for Southern Dist. of Iowa, 490 U.S. 296 (1989), is not to 
the contrary.  In that case, the Court held that a particular federal statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1915(d), authorizing the District Court to 
""request"" that an attorney represent an indigent litigant, does not give the court power to require an unwilling attorney to serve.  
The Court expressed no opinion on ""whether the federal courts possess inherent authority to require lawyers to serve."" 490 U.S.,

1486,1," In his deposition, Edward Jackson, the president of AAS, defined a ""full-line catalog supplier"" targeting the ""school market"" as 
follows: "
1487,," [T]hey would be companies with broad catalogs which include supplies, furniture, equipment, and educational aids, usually with 
some kind of sales organization, warehouse, and office and computer where--again, where their primary emphasis is selling to 
the school market."
1487,2," An initial stock offering memorandum prepared by Jackson when he sought to market AAS to investors provides the following 
description of the pertinent market: The [National School Supply & Equipment Association] directory lists about 120 distributorship/retail members. These are the 
companies that concentrate on this market. . . . However, hundreds of other distributors and companies also sell into the school 
market which, for many of these, is only an auxiliary market--such as for office products dealers."
1487,3," BCI also submits bids in response to its customers' solicitations. Public schools often solicit such bids for contracts involving 
their supplies, especially those relating to their consumable paper products needs. In an affidavit, Jackson suggests that 50% of 
BCI's sales are on the basis of such bids."
1487,4," The parties agree that an experienced sales force (i.e. sales representatives with settled accounts) is an important factor 
affecting a company's success in the school market. Indeed, the facts in this case underscore the vitality of the phenomenon in 
which a sales representative takes a substantial portion of his or her settled accounts to a new employer--a phenomenon 
sometimes referred to as ""following"" in sales nomenclature. "
1488,5," BCI's letter to selected Ohio customers announcing the discount stated, in part: As we have anticipated might happen, a new competitor entering the Ohio market has offered extremely large discounts to lure 
our established customers away. Thus against our best wishes, we find ourselves in a price war. As you know, in any price war, 
there is only one winner--the customer! Effective immediately and throughout the balance of 1988, we are hereby authorizing a 40% discount off current catalog prices. 
This discount shall be applicable to everything in our catalog (excluding furniture & equipment). To facilitate your continuing to 
do business with Beckley-Cardy, the 40% discount will be programmed into our computer. Thus your orders will automatically 
receive this 40% discount. "
1489,6," AAS does not purport to provide any evidence supporting the allegation that BCI's discounts in Illinois, anywhere from 5% to 
12% off of their original 1988 published prices, constituted pricing below BCI s ""reasonably anticipated incremental cost."" Nor 
does it show how BCI's lowest price guarantee relates to such costs. To the extent that AAS does not show how these discounts 
and the price guarantee constituted discriminatory or predatory conduct, summary judgment on these allegations is granted on 
behalf of defendant. "
1490,7," In an affidavit submitted by defendant, the Assistant Superintendent of Public Instructions for Ohio places the 1987 figure at $ 
147,630,845 for general supplies. AAS contends that the overall school supplies market represented by either this figure or the 
National Index includes categories of items not distributed by the parties and thus do not fairly represent the relevant market for 
purposes of analyzing the antitrust claims at issue. AAS, however, fails to offer meaningful alternative figures; it merely urges the 
court to calculate the total sales generated by the larger full-line suppliers currently selling products in Ohio. According to AAS, 
this figure will yield the appropriate measure of the market (thus placing BCI's percentage of the 1987 Ohio market at 23.7%). 
The court fails to see how this latter figure constitutes a more accurate measure of the market since the parties admittedly seek 
to distribute to the larger, relatively untapped, school market as a whole. A proper analysis of AAS's attempted monopoly claim 
must take this potential market into account. See note 2, supra."
1490,8," It bears noting that the remaining jurisdictional elements for a prima facie case under § 2(a) of the statute have not been 
addressed by the parties. See generally 3 E. Kinter & J. Bauer, Kinter: Federal Antitrust Law § 20.2 (1983). "
1491,9, This restatement of plaintiff's position is not meant to suggest that AAS somehow acted improperly in its hiring policies.
1491,10," A portion of the only real sales data for Ohio provided by the was submitted by defendant. If these figures show anything, they 
merely highlight the dramatic increase in AAS's sales in 1988 and a corresponding decrease in BCI's sales: Company"

1491,1985, 
1491,1986,

1491,11," Plaintiff provides a fleeting citation to Utah Pie Co. v. Continental Baking, 386 U.S. 685 (1967) for the proposition that its 
increase in sales does not bear upon whether it suffered actual harm due to BCI's discounts. That may be so, but that does not 
free AAS from the burden of providing specific facts to support this allegation. "
1492,12," AAS points to the deposition statements of two of BCI's competitors in Ohio who stated that they believed their sales in Ohio 
were affected by BCI's discounts. These deponents stated that they could not positively determine whether this was so, nor 
could they determine the amount in sales they allegedly lost. BCI responds by pointing to the deposition testimony of two Ohio 
competitors who were unaware of any loss in sales due to BCI's discounts. The court concludes that these deposition 
statements as a whole do not raise a jury question as to whether there was substantial harm to competition. "
1495,1, Dr Pepper's response itself demonstrates that it was able to respond adequately. 
1498,2," Dr Pepper's attempts to distinguish Boat & Motor Mart v. Sea Ray Boats, Inc., 825 F.2d 1285, 1292 (9th Cir. 1987), as a case 
holding that the Franchise Act does not impose additional fiduciary duties is unconvincing. In Boat & Motor Mart the Ninth Circuit 
held both that the relationship between franchisor and franchisee is not a fiduciary relationship as a matter of common law and 
that the Franchise Act does not impose any additional fiduciary duty. "
1515,1," Former Principle 3 provided: A physician should practice a method of healing founded on a scientific basis; and he should not voluntarily associate with 
anyone who violates this principle. "
1522,2," The AMA's assertion that former Principle 3 operated to prevent the ""free-riding"" that would have occurred if physicians had 
referred patients to chiropractors misses the mark. Apparently, the AMA believes that if physicians were forced to refer patients 
to chiropractors, chiropractors would benefit (the ""free ride"") from the physicians' reputation for providing quality medical service, 
without necessarily deserving that reputation themselves. But neither this court nor the district court would require the AMA to 
endorse chiropractic, nor do we mandate that there be referrals. We simply speak to the restraint on professional association, 
and say that physicians, hospitals, and other institutions must be free to make their own uncoerced decisions on whether to 
professionally associate with chiropractors. We do not compel medical physicians to praise or sponsor chiropractors' work. See 
Schachar v. American Academy of Ophthalmology, 870 F.2d 397, 399 (7th Cir. 1989). We do not even require ""cooperation or 
friendliness."" Id. We also note that the AMA apparently misconceives the role of the free-riding analysis in antitrust law. See 
Premier Electrical Construction Co. v. National Electrical Contractors Ass'n. Inc., 814 F.2d 358, 368-70 (7th Cir. 1987) 
(explaining the concept). "
1524,3," The AMA cites United States v. Borden Co., 347 U.S. 514, 98 L. Ed. 903, 74 S. Ct. 703 (1954), for the proposition that a 
showing of class-wide injury is insufficient to support injunctive relief for an individual plaintiff. While that might be true, Borden 
does not say so. There, the Supreme Court held that in light of the differences in the interests sought to be vindicated by the 
government and by private litigants in actions under the Clayton Act, the government was not precluded from obtaining injunctive 
relief against price discrimination simply because, in an earlier private action, a decree enjoined the conduct in question. At any 
rate, the trial court here relied on more than evidence of ""class-wide injury"" in finding that these four plaintiffs were injured by the 
AMA's unlawful boycott. "
1526,4," In 1980, the AMA adopted a new set of ""Principles of Medical Ethics"" that replaced the former ""Principles"" that had been in 
place since 1957.  The 1980 ""Principles"" provide in part:"
1526,3, .00 OPINIONS ON INTERPROFESSIONAL RELATIONS
1526,3," .01. NONSCIENTIFIC PRACTITIONERS. It is wrong to engage in or to aid and abet in treatment which has no scientific 
basis and is dangerous, is calculated to deceive the patient by giving him false hope, or which may cause the patient to 
delay in seeking proper care until his condition becomes irreversible. Physicians should also be mindful of state laws which prohibit a physician from aiding and abetting an unlicensed person in 
the practice of medicine, aiding or abetting a person with a limited license in providing services beyond the scope of his 
license, or undertaking the joint medical treatment of patients under the foregoing circumstances. "
1527,," A physician is otherwise free to accept or decline to serve anyone who seeks his services, regardless of who has 
recommended that the individual see the physician."
1527,3," .02 OPTOMETRY. It is not unethical for an ophthalmologist to employ an optometrist as ancillary personnel to assist him 
provided the optometrist is identified to patients as an optometrist. A physician may send his patient to a qualified and 
ethical optometrist for optometric services. The physician would be ethically remiss, of course, if before doing so he did not 
insure that there was an absence of any medical reason for his patient's complaint, and he would be equally remiss if he 
sent a patient without having made a medical evaluation of the patient's condition. Physicians may teach in recognized schools of optometry for the purpose of improving the quality of optometric education. 
The scope of this teaching may embrace subjects within the legitimate scope of optometry which are designed to prepare 
students to engage in optometry within the limits prescribed by law. (Jt.App. 1416.) Compare the treatment of optometrists and chiropractors. One has to look in the category of ""nonscientific 
practitioners"" to learn that it is ethical to associate with chiropractors. But there is a separate section devoted to optometrists, 
about whom the AMA at one time had some very negative things to say.  671 F. Supp. at 1487. "
1528,5," Based on the language in section 16 that equitable relief is available ""when and under the same conditions and principles as 
injunctive relief . . . is granted by courts of equity. . . .,"" the AMA makes a passing argument, buried in two of its 67 footnotes (two 
footnotes, incidentally, that are separated by seven pages of text) that the district court erred by not requiring the plaintiffs to 
meet all the requirements for an injunction that traditional equity jurisprudence imposes. The AMA does not bother to say what 
those traditional equitable requirements are, in the case of a permanent injunction, except to say that the plaintiffs had to show 
they had no adequate remedy at law. Nor does the AMA cite any cases concerning the propriety of a permanent injunction under 
§ 16. The Supreme Court has stated § 16 invokes ""traditional equitable principles."" Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 
395 U.S. 100, 130, 23 L. Ed. 2d 129, 89 S. Ct. 1562 (1969); see also Roland Machinery Co.  v. Dresser Industries, Inc., 749 
F.2d 380, 386 (7th Cir. 1984). Scholarly comment has echoed this theme. E.g., 2 P. Areeda and D. Turner, Antitrust Law § 
312d (1978); Easterbrook and Fischel, Antitrust Suits by Targets of Tender Offers, 80 Mich.L.Rev. 1155, 1168-69 (1982). 
Section 16's language indicates that traditional equity principles should apply. But while it is true that the district court stated that 
the plaintiffs did not have to meet all the traditional equitable requirements for an injunction, we are not convinced that this 
misstatement affected the court's analysis. The important point is that equitable relief is discretionary, and not automatically 
available to an injured plaintiff. See Areeda & Turner, supra, § 312d at 39. The district court did exercise discretion and did not 
automatically grant the plaintiffs an injunction. The court carefully weighed the AMA's conduct, the likelihood it would recur, the 
harm it caused and might in the future cause, and we believe, implicitly in all this, the relative hardships to the parties of granting 
an injunction. See 671 F. Supp. at 1484-88. It is true that the district court did not specifically find that the plaintiffs had no adequate remedy at law. The AMA baldly asserts 
that damages would have been adequate, but does not mention how. At any rate, at this stage in the case, we are not inclined to 
reverse the district court's careful decision based on an underdeveloped argument that the AMA did not even deem worthy of 
including under a separate heading in the text of its brief. "
1529,6," For the same reason, we do not view the district court's injunction as improperly awarding class-wide relief where no class was 
certified. The AMA's argument in this regard is just a rephrasing of its argument that the injunction is overbroad. "
1530,7," The district court also held that even if JCAH were acting independently of the AMA boycott, its members (e.g., the AMA) were 
not responsible for the actions of JCAH. 671 F. Supp. at 1491-92. On appeal, plaintiffs tell us that this was unnecessary, and 
actually confused their asserted theory that JCAH was an unlawful conspiracy in its own right.  Thus, we do not pass on the 
propriety of the district court's ruling in this regard. "
1531,8," The court went on to observe that under current JCAH standards, hospitals could grant chiropractors medical staff 
membership, clinical privileges, admission privileges, and access to diagnostic services without fearing loss of JCAH 
accreditation. Authority for making individual medical staff appointments now rests with the individual hospital's governing board. "
1532,9," Plaintiffs claim, for the first time in their reply brief, that the 1983 standards themselves violate the antitrust laws. The district 
court, however, stated that plaintiffs were not claiming that the 1983 JCAH standards violated the antitrust laws. 671 F. Supp. at 
1492. Whether they did or did not raise the issue in the district court, there is no question that the plaintiffs' initial appellate brief 
did not raise this issue.  Rather, plaintiffs argued that ""The JCAH 1983 Revisions Continued The Boycott."" In this regard they 
stated, ""only one conclusion is possible: the JCAH M.D. domination standard perpetuates the boycott"" (emphasis added). We 
think it plain that plaintiffs made their claim that the 1983 revisions themselves were unlawful for the first time on reply. We thus 
will not address the argument. See Gold v. Wolpert, 876 F.2d 1327, 1331 n. 6 (7th Cir. 1989). "
1533,10," Plaintiffs make one additional claim. This case, they tell us, fits neatly within the framework of American Society of Mechanical 
Engineers, Inc. v. Hydrolevel Corp., 456 U.S. 556, 72 L. Ed. 2d 330, 102 S. Ct. 1935 (1982). They assert that because the trial 
court found the AMA manipulated the JCAH and caused it to adopt Standard X (as well as circulating the AMA's ""Right and Duty 
of Hospitals to Exclude Chiropractors""), that JCAH was liable because it allowed itself to be manipulated and used as a 
mechanism through which the AMA enforced its anti-competitive scheme.  Plaintiffs cite Hydrolevel in the portion of their 
argument dealing with JCAH's alleged knowing adherence and participation in the AMA's boycott. But Hydrolevel does not 
address the conscious parallelism issue. Hydrolevel speaks of an association's liability in its own right, not as a member of 
another's unlawful conspiracy. We thus believe Hydrolevel is inapplicable to this case. "
1534,11," Plaintiffs also argue that the district court erroneously ""excluded evidence [which] proves ACP's knowing intent to exclude 
chiropractors."" (Plaintiff's reply br. at 23.) What plaintiffs are getting at is that certain evidence was held by the district court to be 
protected under the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. The first involved a letter written to a governmental agency (the National Institute 
of Neurological Diseases and Strokes (NINDS)) in connection with a government project (the study of chiropractic). Plaintiffs 
claim this was not protected under the Noerr-Pennington doctrine because blind copies were sent to the AMA's Committee on 
Quackery and other medical societies. They ignore the fact, however, that the district court made an alternative holding with 
respect to this letter. It stated that even if the letter was not protected, it was obvious that it expressed only the author's own 
opinion as to what action the ACP's board of regents (its policy-making body) might take in the future, and that it was not the act 
of the ACP endorsing the AMA chiropractic policy statement. The court also found there was no evidence that ACP had 
knowledge of the activities of the Committee on Quackery.  Thus, we do not need to address whether or not this document was 
protected under the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, as the alternative ground is both sound and unchallenged. Plaintiffs make two perfunctory and undeveloped contentions with regard to ""exclusion"" of ""boycott activity."" But neither of these 
amounts to an ""argument"" under Fed.R.App.P. 28(a)(4). Thus, we will consider neither. "
1540,1," La.C.C. Art. 1995 HN3[
] provides that damages in a breach of contract action ""are measured by the loss sustained by the 
obligee and the profit of which he has been deprived."" "
1542,1, This court has previously decided TMR had by law the right to assign the contract. 
1560,1," Defendants contend that plaintiff's conversion claim cannot be considered because such claim is not properly asserted in 
plaintiff's complaint. Defendants, however, ""misconceive[] the nature of federal pleading which is by statement of claim, not legal 
theories."" Newman v. Silver, 713 F.2d 14, 16 n. 1 (2d Cir. 1983). Plaintiff has already alleged that defendants have wrongfully 
appropriated the Specifications. (A-15). Because this states a claim for conversion, I reject defendants' contention."
1560,2," The designation ""(A-XX)"" refers to a page in the Joint Appendix prepared on appeal from this Court's Memorandum and Order 
dated April 30, 1987. "
1561,3," Because my decision does not depend on the existence of trade secrets, I do not reach the issue whether the Specifications 
contain trade secrets. "
1563,4," Defendants also allege that plaintiff violated section 3 of the Clayton Act and section 5 of the FTC Act. Defendants now 
concede the unavailability of relief under both these sections. Accordingly, I dismiss defendants' antitrust claims relating to either 
section 3 of the Clayton Act or section 5 of the FTC Act. "
1573,1," HN1[
] Section 337 prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair acts in the importation of goods into the United States including the infringement of patents and trademarks. See 19 U.S.C. § 1337. Section 337 cases are adjudicated through an 
administrative process under the jurisdiction of the ITC. Id. § 1337(c)."
1573,2," For example, these drawings may show that the '645 patent was an obvious improvement to existing sickle guard designs. If 
the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious 
at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains, the subject 
matter is not patentable. Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1 (1965). See also 35 U.S.C. § 103. Furthermore, if these drawings were published in such a manner that they were reasonably accessible to the public prior to June 
27, 1974, one year before National's patent application was filed, the subject matter of the '645 patent may not be patentable. 
See In re Wyer, 655 F.2d 221, 226 (C.C.P.A. 1981). Furthermore, if the European manufacturer had received a patent from a "
1574,," foreign country for its sickle guard prior to June 27, 1974, the subject matter of the '645 patent may not be patentable. HN2[
] See 5 U.S.C. § 102(b) (""A person shall be entitled to a patent unless the invention was patented or described in a printed 
publication in this or a foreign country or in public use or on sale in this country, more than one year prior to the date of the 
application for patent in the United States.""). In general, Section 102 bars the patentability of subject matter previously known or 
used by others. From the materials before it, the Court cannot determine if either of the above-mentioned scenarios occurred. "
1575,3," However, HN6[
] a State's unfair competition law cannot impose liability for or prohibit the copying of an article which is not 
entitled to protection under either federal patent or copyright laws. Compco Corp. v. Day-Brite Lighting, Inc., 376 U.S. 234 
(1964); Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Stiffel Co., 376 U.S. 225 (1964). ""To allow a State by use of its law of unfair competition to 
prevent the copying of an article which represents too slight an advance to be patented [or copyrighted] would be to permit the 
State to block off from the public something which federal law has said belongs to the public."" Sears, 376 U.S. at 231-32. "
1586,1," HN4[
] ""(b) Judgment Upon Multiple Claims or Involving Multiple Parties. When more than one claim for relief is presented in 
an action, whether as a claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, or when multiple parties are involved, the court 
may direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties only upon an express 
determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment. In the absence of 
such determination and direction, any order or other form of decision, however designated, which adjudicates fewer than all the 
claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims or parties, and 
the order or other form of decision is subject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims and 
the rights and liabilities of all the parties."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 54. "
