Court for the District of New Jersey.  Zenith's complaint was"
10,3," The District Court ruled separately that petitioners were 
entitled to summary judgment on respondents' claims under 
the Antidumping Act of 1916.  Zenith Radio Corp. v. 
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., 494 F.Supp. 1190 (ED Pa. 
1980). Respondents appealed this ruling, and the Court of 
Appeals reversed in a separate opinion issued the same day 
as the opinion concerning respondents' other claims.  In re 
Japanese Electronic Products Antitrust Litigation, 723 F.2d 
319 (CA3 1983).  LEdHN[2B][
] [2B]Petitioners ask us to review the Court of 
Appeals' Antidumping Act decision along with its decision on 
the rest of this mammoth case.  The Antidumping Act claims 
were not, however, mentioned in the questions presented in 
the petition for certiorari, and they have not been 
independently argued by the parties.  See this Court's Rule 
21.1(a).  We therefore decline the invitation to review the 
Court of Appeals' decision on those claims.
"
10,4," As to 3 of the 24 defendants, the Court of Appeals affirmed 
the entry of summary judgment. Petitioners are the 21 
defendants who remain in the case."
11,6," The Sherman Act does reach conduct outside our borders, 
but only when the conduct has an effect on American 
commerce.  Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon 
Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 704 (1962) (""A conspiracy to monopolize 
or restrain the domestic or foreign commerce of the United 
States is not outside the reach of the Sherman Act just 
because part of the conduct complained of occurs in foreign 
countries"").  The effect on which respondents rely is the 
artificially depressed level of prices for CEPs in the United 
States. Petitioners' alleged cartelization of the Japanese market could 
not have caused that effect over a period of some two 
decades.  Once petitioners decided, as respondents allege, to 
reduce output and raise prices in the Japanese market, they 
had the option of either producing fewer goods or selling more 
goods in other markets.  The most plausible conclusion is that 
petitioners chose the latter option because it would be more 
profitable than the former.  That choice does not flow from the 
cartelization of the Japanese market.  On the contrary, were 
the Japanese market perfectly competitive petitioners would 
still have to choose whether to sell goods overseas, and would 
still presumably make that choice based on their profit 
expectations.  For this reason, respondents' theory of recovery 
depends on proof of the asserted price-cutting conspiracy in 
this country.
"
11,5," In addition to these inferences, the court noted that there was 
expert opinion evidence that petitioners' export sales 
""generally were at prices which produced losses, often as high 
as twenty-five percent on sales."" 723 F.2d, at 311. The court 
did not identify any direct evidence of below-cost pricing; nor 
did it place particularly heavy reliance on this aspect of the 
expert evidence.  See n. 19, infra."
12,8," Throughout this opinion, we refer to the asserted conspiracy 
as one to price ""predatorily."" This term has been used chiefly 
in cases in which a single firm, having a dominant share of the 
relevant market, cuts its prices in order to force competitors 
out of the market, or perhaps to deter potential entrants from 
coming in.  E. g., Southern Pacific Communications Co. v. 
American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 238 U. S. App. D. C. 
309, 331-336, 740 F.2d 980, 1002-1007 (1984), cert. denied, 
470 U.S. 1005 (1985). In such cases, ""predatory pricing"" 
means pricing below some appropriate measure of cost.  E. g., 
Barry Wright Corp. v. ITT Grinnell Corp., 724 F.2d 227, 232-
235 (CA1 1983); see Utah Pipe Co. v. Continental Baking Co., 
386 U.S. 685, 698, 701, 702, n. 14 (1967).  LEdHN[7B][
] [7B]There is a good deal of debate, both in 
the cases and in the law reviews, about what ""cost"" is relevant 
in such cases.  We need not resolve this debate here, 
because unlike the cases cited above, this is a Sherman Act ยง 
1 case.  For purposes of this case, it is enough to note that 
respondents have not suffered an antitrust injury unless 
petitioners conspired to drive respondents out of the relevant 
markets by (i) pricing below the level necessary to sell their 
products, or (ii) pricing below some appropriate measure of 
cost.  An agreement without these features would either leave 
respondents in the same position as would market forces or 
would actually benefit respondents by raising market prices.  
Respondents therefore may not complain of conspiracies that, 
for example, set maximum prices above market levels, or that 
set minimum prices at any level.
"
12,9," We do not consider whether recovery should ever be 
available on a theory such as respondents' when the pricing in 
question is above some measure of incremental cost.  See 
generally Areeda & Turner, Predatory Pricing and Related 
Practices Under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 88 Harv. L. 
Rev. 697, 709-718 (1975) (discussing cost-based test for use 
in ยง 2 cases).  As a practical matter, it may be that only direct 
evidence of below-cost pricing is sufficient to overcome the 
strong inference that rational businesses would not enter into 
conspiracies such as this one.  See Part IV-A, infra."
12,7," Respondents also argue that the check prices, the five 
company rule, and the price fixing in Japan are all part of one 
large conspiracy that includes monopolization of the American 
market through predatory pricing. The argument is mistaken.  
However one decides to describe the contours of the asserted 
conspiracy -- whether there is one conspiracy or several -- 
respondents must show that the conspiracy caused them an 
injury for which the antitrust laws provide relief.  Associated 
General Contractors of California, Inc. v. Carpenters, 459 U.S. 
519, 538-540 (1983); Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, 
Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 488-489 (1977); see also Note, Antitrust 
Standing, Antitrust Injury, and the Per Se Standard, 93 Yale 
L.J. 1309 (1984). That showing depends in turn on proof that 
petitioners conspired to price predatorily in the American 
market, since the other conduct involved in the alleged 
conspiracy cannot have caused such an injury."
13,10," Respondents argued before the District Court that 
petitioners had failed to carry their initial burden under Federal 
Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) of demonstrating the absence of 
a genuine issue of material fact.  See Adickes v. S.H. Kress & 
Co., 398 U.S. 144, 157 (1970). Cf.  Catrett v. Johns-Manville 
Sales Corp., 244 U. S. App. D. C. 160, 756 F.2d 181, cert. 
granted, 474 U.S. 944 (1985). That issue was resolved in 
petitioners' favor, and is not before us."
13,11," Rule 56(e) provides, in relevant part: HN1[
] ""When a motion for summary judgment is made and 
supported as provided in this rule, an adverse party may not 
rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleading, but 
his response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this 
rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a 
genuine issue for trial.  If he does not so respond, summary 
judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against him.""
"
13,12," See n. 10, supra."
15,15," Respondents offer no reason to suppose that entry into the 
relevant market is especially difficult, yet without barriers to 
entry it would presumably be impossible to maintain 
supracompetitive prices for an extended time.  Judge 
Easterbrook, commenting on this case in a law review article, 
offers the following sensible assessment: ""The plaintiffs [in this case] maintain that for the last fifteen 
years or more at least ten Japanese manufacturers have sold 
TV sets at less than cost in order to drive United States firms 
out of business.  Such conduct cannot possibly produce profits 
by harming competition, however.  If the Japanese firms drive 
some United States firms out of business, they could not 
recoup. Fifteen years of losses could be made up only by very 
high prices for the indefinite future.  (The losses are like 
investments, which must be recovered with compound 
interest.) If the defendants should try to raise prices to such a 
level, they would attract new competition.  There are no 
barriers to entry into electronics, as the proliferation of 
computer and audio firms shows.  The competition would 
come from resurgent United States firms, from other foreign 
firms (Korea and many other nations make TV sets), and from 
defendants themselves.  In order to recoup, the Japanese 
firms would need to suppress competition among themselves.  
On plaintiffs' theory, the cartel would need to last at least thirty 
years, far longer than any in history, even when cartels were 
not illegal.  None should be sanguine about the prospects of 
such a cartel, given each firm's incentive to shave price and 
expand its share of sales.  The predation recoupment story 
therefore does not make sense, and we are left with the more 
plausible inference that the Japanese firms did not sell below 
cost in the first place.  They were just engaged in hard 
competition."" Easterbrook, The Limits of Antitrust, 63 Texas L. 
Rev. 1, 26-27 (1984) (footnotes omitted).
"
15,16," The alleged predatory scheme makes sense only if 
petitioners can recoup their losses.  In light of the large"
15,13," NUE's complaint alleges that petitioners' conspiracy began 
as early as 1960; the starting date used in Zenith's complaint 
is 1953.  NUE Complaint para. 52; Zenith Complaint para. 39."
15,14," During the same period, the number of American firms 
manufacturing television sets declined from 19 to 13.  5 App. 
to Brief for Appellant in No. 81-2331 (CA3), p. 1961a.  This 
decline continued a trend that began at least by 1960, when 
petitioners' sales in the United States market were negligible.  
Ibid.  See Zenith Complaint paras. 35, 37."
16,," number of firms involved here, petitioners can achieve this 
only by engaging in some form of price fixing after they have 
succeeded in driving competitors from the market.  Such price 
fixing would, of course, be an independent violation of ยง 1 of 
the Sherman Act. United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 
310 U.S. 150 (1940).
"
16,17," The predators' losses must actually increase as the 
conspiracy nears its objective: the greater the predators' 
market share, the more products the predators sell; but since 
every sale brings with it a loss, an increase in market share 
also means an increase in predatory losses."
16,18," The same is true of any supposed excess production 
capacity that petitioners may have possessed.  The existence 
of plant capacity that exceeds domestic demand does tend to 
establish the ability to sell products abroad.  It does not, 
however, provide a motive for selling at prices lower than 
necessary to obtain sales; nor does it explain why petitioners 
would be willing to lose money in the United States market 
without some reasonable prospect of recouping their 
investment."
16,19," Respondents also rely on an expert study suggesting that 
petitioners have sold their products in the American market at 
substantial losses.  The relevant study is not based on actual 
cost data; rather, it consists of expert opinion based on a 
mathematical construction that in turn rests on assumptions 
about petitioners' costs.  The District Court analyzed those 
assumptions in some detail and found them both implausible 
and inconsistent with record evidence.  Zenith Radio Corp. v. 
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., 505 F.Supp., at 1356-1363. 
Although the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's 
finding that the expert report was inadmissible, the court did 
not disturb the District Court's analysis of the factors that 
substantially undermine the probative value of that evidence.  
See 723 F.2d, at 277-282. We find the District Court's analysis 
persuasive.  Accordingly, in our view the expert opinion 
evidence of below-cost pricing has little probative value in 
comparison with the economic factors, discussed in Part IV-A, 
supra, that suggest that such conduct is irrational."
17,20," The Court of Appeals correctly reasoned that the five 
company rule might tend to insulate petitioners from 
competition with each other.  723 F.2d, at 306. But this effect 
is irrelevant to a conspiracy to price predatorily.  Petitioners 
have no incentive to underprice each other if they already are 
pricing below the level at which they could sell their goods.  
The far more plausible inference from a customer allocation 
agreement such as the five company rule is that petitioners 
were conspiring to raise prices, by limiting their ability to take 
sales away from each other.  Respondents -- petitioners' 
competitors -- suffer no harm from a conspiracy to raise 
prices.  Supra, at 582-583.  Moreover, it seems very unlikely 
that the five company rule had any significant effect of any 
kind, since the ""rule"" permitted petitioners to sell to their 
American subsidiaries, and did not limit the number of 
distributors to which the subsidiaries could resell.  513 
F.Supp., at 1190."
18,21," We do not imply that, if petitioners had had a plausible 
reason to conspire, ambiguous conduct could suffice to create 
a triable issue of conspiracy. Our decision in Monsanto Co. v. 
Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U.S. 752 (1984), establishes 
that HN5[
] conduct that is as consistent with permissible 
competition as with illegal conspiracy does not, without more, 
support even an inference of conspiracy. Id., at 763-764. See 
supra, at 588."
19,1," The Court adequately summarizes the quite fact-specific 
holding in Cities Service.  Ante, at 587. In Monsanto, the Court held that a manufacturer's termination 
of a price-cutting distributor after receiving a complaint from 
another distributor is not, standing alone, sufficient to create a 
jury question.  465 U.S., at 763-764. To understand this 
holding, it is important to realize that under United States v. 
Colgate & Co., 250 U.S. 300 (1919), it is permissible for a 
manufacturer to announce retail prices in advance and 
terminate those who fail to comply, but that under Dr. Miles 
Medical Co. v. John D. Park & Sons Co., 220 U.S. 373 (1911), 
it is impermissible for the manufacturer and its distributors to 
agree on the price at which the distributors will sell the goods.  
Thus, a manufacturer's termination of a price-cutting distributor 
after receiving a complaint from another distributor is lawful 
"
19,," under Colgate, unless the termination is pursuant to a shared 
understanding between the manufacturer and its distributors 
respecting enforcement of a resale price maintenance 
scheme.  Monsanto holds that to establish liability under Dr. 
Miles, more is needed than evidence of behavior that is 
consistent with a distributor's exercise of its prerogatives under 
Colgate.  Thus, ""[there] must be evidence that tends to 
exclude 
the 
possibility 
that 
the 
manufacturer 
and 
nonterminated distributors were acting independently."" 465 
U.S., at 764. Monsanto does not hold that if a terminated 
dealer produces some further evidence of conspiracy beyond 
the bare fact of postcomplaint termination, the judge hearing a 
motion for summary judgment should balance all the evidence 
pointing toward conspiracy against all the evidence pointing 
toward independent action.
"
20,," coordination, and other allegedly anti-competitive practices of 
petitioners:
 ""The impact of Japanese anti-competitive practices on United 
States manufacturers is evident when one considers the 
nature of competition.  When a market is fully competitive, 
firms pit their resources against one another in an attempt to 
secure the business of individual customers.  However, when 
firms collude, they violate a basic tenet of competitive 
behavior, i. e., that they act independently.  United States 
firms were confronted with Japanese competitors who 
collusively were seeking to destroy their established customer 
relationships.  Each Japanese company had targeted 
customers which it could service with reasonable assurance 
that its fellow Japanese cartel members would not become 
involved.  But just as importantly, each Japanese firm would 
be assured that what was already a low price level for 
Japanese television receivers in the United States market 
would not be further depressed by the actions of its Japanese 
associates.
 ""The result was a phenomenal growth in exports, particularly 
to the United States.  Concurrently, Japanese manufacturers, 
and the defendants in particular, made large investments in 
new plant and equipment and expanded production capacity.  
It is obvious, therefore, that the effect of the Japanese cartel's 
concerted actions was to generate a larger volume of 
investment in the Japanese television industry than would 
otherwise have been the case.  This added capacity both 
enabled and encouraged the Japanese to penetrate the 
United States market more deeply than they would have had 
they competed lawfully."" Id., at 1628a-1629a.
 For a more complete statement of DePodwin's explanation of 
how the alleged cartel operated, and the harms it caused 
respondents, see id., at 1609a-1642a.  This material is 
summarized in a chart found id., at 1633a.
"
20,4," In holding that Parts IV and V of the Report had been 
improperly excluded, the Court of Appeals said: ""The trial court found that DePodwin did not use economic 
expertise in reaching the opinion that the defendants 
participated in a Japanese television cartel. 505 F.Supp. at 
1342-46. We have examined the excluded portions of Parts IV 
and V in light of the admitted portions, and we conclude that 
this finding is clearly erroneous.  As a result, the court also 
"
20,2," Dr. DePodwin summarizes his view of the harm caused by 
Japanese cartelization as follows: ""When we consider the injuries inflicted on United States 
producers, we must again look at the Japanese television 
manufacturers' export agreement as part of a generally 
collusive scheme embracing the Japanese domestic market 
as well.  This scheme increased the supply of television 
receivers to the United States market while restricting supply 
in the Japanese market.  If Japanese manufacturers had 
competed in both domestic and export markets, they would 
have sold more in the domestic market and less in the United 
States.  A greater proportion of Japanese production capacity 
would have been devoted to domestic sales.  Domestic prices 
would have been lower and export prices would have been 
higher.  The size of the price differential between domestic 
and export markets would have diminished practically to the 
vanishing point.  Consequently, competition among Japanese 
producers in both markets would have resulted in reducing 
exports to the United States and United States prices would 
have risen.  In addition, investment by the United States 
industry would have increased.  As it was, however, the influx 
of sets at depressed prices cut the rates of return on television 
receiver production facilities in the United States to so low a 
level as to make such investment uneconomic.
 ""We can therefore conclude that the American manufacturers 
of television receivers would have made larger sales at higher 
prices in the absence of the Japanese cartel agreements.  
Thus, 
the 
collusive 
behavior 
of 
Japanese 
television 
manufacturers resulted in a very severe injury to those 
American television manufacturers, particularly to National 
Union Electric Corporation, which produced a preponderance 
of television sets with screen sizes of nineteen inches and 
lower, especially those in the lower range of prices."" 5 App. to 
Brief for Appellants in No. 81-2331 (CA3), pp. 1629a-1630a.

21,," held the opinions to be unhelpful to the factfinder. What the 
court in effect did was to eliminate all parts of the report in 
which the expert economist, after describing the conditions in 
the respective markets, the opportunities for collusion, the 
evidence pointing to collusion, the terms of certain undisputed 
agreements, and the market behavior, expressed the opinion 
that there was concert of action consistent with plaintiffs' 
conspiracy theory.  Considering the complexity of the 
economic issues involved, it simply cannot be said that such 
an opinion would not help the trier of fact to understand the 
evidence or determine that fact in issue."" In re Japanese 
Electronics Products Antitrust Litigation, 723 F.2d 238, 280 
(1983).
 The Court of Appeals had similar views about Parts VI and VII.
"
21,5," I use the Third Circuit's analysis of the five company rule by 
way of example; the court did an equally careful analysis of 
the parts the cartel activity in Japan and the check prices 
could have played in an actionable conspiracy. See generally 
id., at 303-311. In discussing the five-company rule, I do not mean to imply 
any conclusion on the validity of petitioners' sovereign 
compulsion defense.  Since the Court does not reach this 
issue, I see no need of my addressing it.
