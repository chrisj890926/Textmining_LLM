14,2," If Congress prohibited independent action that merely 
restrains trade (even if it does not threaten monopolization), 
that prohibition could deter perfectly competitive conduct by 
firms that are fearful of litigation costs and judicial error. See 
Copperweld, 467 U.S., at 768, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 
628 (“Judging unilateral conduct in this manner reduces the 
risk that the antitrust laws will dampen the competitive zeal of 
a single aggressive entrepreneur”); cf. United States v. United 
States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422, 441, 98 S. Ct. 2864, 57 L. 
Ed. 2d 854 (1978) (“[S]alutary and procompetitive conduct . . . 
might be shunned by businessmen who chose to be 
excessively cautious in the face of uncertainty”). Moreover, if 
every unilateral action that restrained trade were subject to 
 [****15] antitrust scrutiny, then courts would be forced to 
judge almost every internal business decision. See 7 P. 
Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P1464c, p. 206 (2d"

16,5," This focus on “substance, not form,” Copperweld, 467 U.S., 
at 773, n. 21, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628, can also be 
seen in our cases about whether a company and its agent are 
capable of conspiring under § 1. See, e.g., Simpson v. Union 
Oil Co. of Cal., 377 U.S. 13, 20-21, 84 S. Ct. 1051, 12 L. Ed. 
2d 98 (1964); see also E. Elhauge & D. Geradin, 
 [****21] Global Antitrust Law and Economics 787-788, and 
n. 7 (2007) (hereinafter Elhauge & Geradin) (explaining the 
functional difference between Simpson and United States v. 
General Elec. Co., 272 U.S. 476, 47 S. Ct. 192, 71 L. Ed. 362 
(1926), in which we treated a similar agreement as beyond the 
reach of § 1)."
18,6," As discussed infra, necessity of cooperation is a factor 
relevant to whether the agreement is subject to the Rule of 
Reason. See NCAA, 468 U.S. 85, 101, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 82 L. 
Ed. 2d 70 (1984) (holding that NCAA restrictions on televising 
college football games are subject  [****29] to Rule of Reason 
analysis for the “critical” reason that “horizontal restraints on 
competition are essential if the product is to be available at 
all”)."
18,7," In any event, it simply is not apparent that the alleged 
conduct was necessary at all. Although two teams are needed 
to play a football game, not all aspects of elaborate 
interleague cooperation are necessary to produce a game. 
Moreover, even if leaguewide agreements are necessary to 
produce football, it does not follow that concerted activity in 
marketing intellectual property is necessary to produce 
football. The Court of Appeals carved out a zone of antitrust immunity 
for conduct arguably related to league operations by reasoning 
that coordinated team trademark sales are necessary to 
produce “NFL football,” a single NFL brand that competes 
against other forms of entertainment. But defining the product 
as “NFL football” puts the cart before the horse: Of course the 
NFL produces NFL football; but that does not mean that 
cooperation amongst NFL teams is immune from § 1 scrutiny. 
Members of any cartel could insist that their cooperation is 
necessary to produce the “cartel product” and compete with 
other products.

19,," Amicus Curiae 17. The Government urges that the choices “to 
offer only a blanket license” and “to have only a single 
headwear licensee” might not constitute concerted action 
under its test. Id., at 32. However, because the teams still own 
their own trademarks and are free to market those trademarks 
as they see fit, even those two choices were agreements 
amongst potential competitors and would constitute concerted 
action under the Government's own standard. At any point, the 
teams could decide to license their own trademarks. It is 
significant, moreover, that the teams here control NFLP. The 
two choices that the Government might treat as independent 
action, although nominally made by NFLP, are for all 
functional purposes choices made by the 32 entities with 
potentially competing interests.

19,10," Justice Brandeis provided the classic formulation of the Rule 
of Reason in Board of Trade of Chicago v. United States, 246

]  The true test of legality is 
whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and 
perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it is such as 
may suppress or even destroy competition. To determine that 
question the court must ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to 
the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition 
before and after the restraint is imposed; the nature of the 
restraint and its effect, actual or probable. The history of the 
restraint, the evil believed to exist, the reason for adopting the 
particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, 
are all relevant facts. This is not because a good intention will 
save an otherwise objectionable regulation or the reverse; but 
because knowledge of intent  [****37] may help the court to 
interpret facts and to predict consequences.” See also Leegin

19,9," For the purposes of resolving this case, there is no need to 
pass upon the Government's position that entities are 
incapable of conspiring under § 1 if they “have effectively 
merged

relevant 
aspect 
of 
their 
operations,
