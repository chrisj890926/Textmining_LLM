17,1," Because the parties in this case agree that the relevant 
measure of cost is average variable cost, however, we again 
decline to resolve the conflict among the lower courts over the 
appropriate measure of cost. See Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of 
Colorado, Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 117-118, n. 12, 93 L. Ed. 2d 
427, 107 S. Ct. 484 (1986); Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v.

22,2," This statement could well have referred to the rate at which 
the segment was growing relative to prior years' generic 
volume; this ""internal"" rate of growth would inevitably slow as 
the base volume against which it was measured grew."
25,1," ""It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in 
the course of such commerce, either directly or indirectly, to 
discriminate in price between different purchasers of 
commodities of like grade and quality . . . where the effect of 
such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition 
or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to 
injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any person who 
either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such 
discrimination, or with customers of either of them . . . ."" 15 
U.S. C. ยง 13(a)."
25,2," The jury gave an affirmative answer to the following special 
issue: ""1. Did Brown & Williamson engage in price discrimination that 
"
26,," had a reasonable possibility of injuring competition in the 
cigarette market as a whole in the United States?"" App. 27.
 The jury made its finding after being instructed that ""injury to 
competition"" means ""the injury to consumer welfare which 
results when a competitor is able to raise and to maintain 
prices in a market or well-defined submarket above 
competitive levels. In order to injure competition in the 
cigarette market as a whole, Brown & Williamson must be able 
to create a real possibility of both driving out rivals by loss-
creating price cutting and then holding on to that advantage to 
recoup losses by raising and maintaining prices at higher than 
competitive levels.
 ""You must remember that the Robinson-Patman Act was 
designed to protect competition rather than just competitors 
and, therefore, injury to competition does not mean injury to a 
competitor. Liggett & Myers can not satisfy this element simply 
by showing that they were injured by Brown & Williamson's 
conduct. To satisfy this element, Liggett & Myers must show, 
by a preponderance of the evidence, that Brown & 
Williamson's conduct had a reasonable possibility of injuring 
competition in the cigarette market and not just a reasonable 
possibility of injuring a competitor in the cigarette market."" Id., 
at 829-830.
"
26,3," As the majority notes, the procedural posture of this case 
requires that we view the evidence in the light most favorable 
to Liggett. Ante, at 213. On review of a judgment 
notwithstanding the verdict, the party against whom the 
judgment is entered ""must be given the benefit of every 
legitimate inference that can be drawn from the evidence."" 
See C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure ยง 
2528, pp. 563-564 (1971)."
26,4," When the Court states that ""substantial evidence suggests 
that in recent decades, the industry reaped the benefits of 
prices above a competitive level,"" ante, at 213, I assume it 
accepts the proposition that a reasonable jury could find 
abnormally high prices characteristic of this industry."
26,5," An internal B&W memorandum, dated May 15, 1984, states 
in part: ""Manufacturer's price increases generally were below the rate 
of inflation but margins improved handsomely due to favorable 
leaf prices and cost reductions associated with automation. 
For example, Brown & Williamson's variable margin increased 
from $ 2.91/M in 1972 to $ 8.78/M in 1981, an increase of over 
200%. In 1982, the industry became much more aggressive 
on the pricing front, fueled by a 100% increase in the Federal 
Excise Tax. Brown & Williamson's variable margin increased 
from $ 10.78/M in 1982 and [sic] to $ 12.61/M in 1983.
 ""The impact of these pricing activities on the smoking public 
was dramatic. The weighted average retail price of a pack of 
cigarettes increased 56% between 1980 and 1983 (from $ .63 
to $ .98)."" App. 127.
"
27,6," On June 4, 1984, B&W announced a maximum rebate of $ 
0.30 per carton for purchases of over 8,000 cases per quarter; 
a week later, Liggett announced a rebate of $ 0.20 on 
comparable volumes. On June 21, B&W increased its rebate 
to $ 0.50, and a day later, Liggett went to $ 0.43. After three 
more increases, B&W settled at $ 0.80 per carton, while 
Liggett remained at $ 0.73. See App. 327, 420-421."
27,7," That quantity discounts are covered by the Act, and 
prohibited when they have the requisite effect on competition, 
has been firmly established since our decision in FTC v. 
Morton Salt Co., 334 U.S. 37, 42-44, 92 L. Ed. 1196, 68 S. Ct. 
822 (1948)."
27,8," ""Provided, That nothing herein contained shall prevent 
differentials which make only due allowance for differences in 
the cost of manufacture, sale, or delivery resulting from the 
differing methods or quantities in which such commodities are 
to such purchasers sold or delivered."" ยง 13(a)."
27,9," ""Provided, however, That nothing herein contained shall 
prevent a seller rebutting the prima-facie case thus made by 
showing that his lower price or the furnishing of services or"
28,," facilities to any purchaser or purchasers was made in good 
faith to meet an equally low price of a competitor, or the 
services or facilities furnished by a competitor."" ยง 13(b).
 The jury gave a negative answer to the following special issue:
 ""3. Did Brown & Williamson engage in price discrimination in 
good faith with the intention to meet, but not beat, the equally 
low net prices of Liggett Group, Inc.?"" App. 27-28.
"
28,10," By offering its largest discounts to Liggett's 14 largest 
customers, App. 168-169, 174, B&W not only put its ""money 
where the volume is,"" id., at 402, but also applied maximum 
pressure to Liggett at a lesser cost to itself than would have 
resulted from a nondiscriminatory price cut."
28,11," It is also true that these same years, other major 
manufacturers entered the generic market and expanded their 
generic sales. Ante, at 217. Their entry is entirely consistent 
with the possibility that lockstep increases in the price of 
generics brought them to a level that was supra-competitive,"
28,," through lower than that charged on branded cigarettes.
"
28,12," ""Q Does this mean that the price increases, which you 
testified are happening twice a year, are used up in these 
consumer promotions? ""A Not by any stretch of the imagination. Although there has 
been an increase in the use of this type of promotional activity 
over the last four or five years, the increase in that promotional 
activity has been far outstripped by the list price increases. 
The prices go up by a lot; the promotional activity, indeed, 
does go up. But the promotional activity has not gone up by 
anywhere near the magnitude of the list price increases. 
Further, those price increases are not warranted by increasing 
costs, since the manufacturing costs of making cigarettes 
have remained roughly constant over the last five years."" App. 
509.
"
29,13," See text of statute, n. 1, supra."
29,14," One of the purposes of broadening the Clayton Act's 
competitive injury language in the Robinson-Patman Act was 
to provide more effective protection against predatory price 
cutting. As the Attorney General's National Committee to 
Study the Antitrust Laws explained in its 1955 report: ""In some circumstances, to be sure, injury to even a single 
competitor should bring the Act into play. Predatory price 
cutting designed to eliminate a smaller business rival, for 
example, is a practice which inevitably frustrates competition 
by excluding competitors from the market or deliberately 
impairing their competitive strength. The invalidation of such 
deliberate price slashes for the purpose of destroying even a 
single competitor, moreover, accords distinct recognition to the 
narrower tests of 'injury' added to the price discrimination 
provisions of the Clayton Act through the 1936 Robinson-
Patman amendments. The discrimination provisions in the 
original Clayton Act were feared by the legislators as 
"
29,," inadequate 
to 
check 
the 
victimization 
of 
individual 
businessmen by predatory price cuts that nevertheless 
created no general impairment of competitive conditions in a 
wider market. To reach such destructive price cuts 
endangering the survival of smaller rivals of a powerful seller 
was an express objective of the liberalizing amendments in the 
'injury' clause of the Robinson-Patman Act."" Report of the 
Attorney General's National Committee to Study the Antitrust 
Laws 165-166 (1955) (footnotes omitted).
"
30,15," In finding an absence of actual supracompetitive pricing, the 
Court also relies on the testimony of Liggett executives, who 
stated that industry prices were fair. Illustrative is the following 
exchange: ""Q I want to know -- yes or no -- sir, whether or not you say 
that the price you charged for branded cigarettes, which is the 
same price you say everybody else charged, was a fair and 
equitable price for that product to the American consumer.
 ""A It's what the industry set, and based on that it's a fair price."" 
App. 396.
"
31,," The problem with this testimony, and testimony like it, is that it 
relates to the period before the price war, as well as after, see 
id., at 392, when there is no real dispute but that prices were 
supracompetitive. (""The profits in the cigarette industry are the 
best of any industry I've been associated with, very much so."" 
Ibid.) Some of the testimony cited by the Court, for instance, is 
that of an outside director who served only from 1977 or 1978 
until 1980, see 64 Tr. 51-56, cited ante, at 237; his belief in the 
competitiveness of his industry must be viewed against the 
""substantial evidence suggesting that in recent decades, the 
industry reaped the benefits of prices above a competitive 
level"" to which the majority itself refers, ante, at 213.
 The jury was, of course, entitled to discount the probative 
force of testimony from executives to the effect that there was 
no collusion among tobacco manufacturers, App. 397-398, 
and that they had appeared before a congressional committee 
to vouch for the competitive nature of their industry, id., at 623-
631. The jury was also free to give greater weight to the 
documentary evidence presented, the inferences to be drawn 
there-from, and the testimony of experts who agreed with the 
textbook characterization of the industry. See App. 640-645; 
R. Tennant, American Cigarette Industry 342 (1950).

328, 339-340, 109 L. Ed. 2d 333, 110 S. Ct. 1884 (1990), for 
example, we noted that low prices benefit consumers ""so long 
as they are above predatory levels."" In Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort 
of Colorado, Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 118, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427, 107 S.
