15,4," Specifically, the Court of Appeals explained that the District 
Court had denied the request for further discovery made by 
respondents in their opposition to Kodak's summary judgment 
motion: ""For example, [respondents] requested to depose two"
15,," ISO customers who allegedly would not sign accurate 
statements concerning Kodak's market power in the parts 
market. Not finding it necessary to reach the market power

reason to grant this request."" 903 F.2d at 617, n. 4.
"
16,7," LEdHN[7B][
] [7B] The dissent suggests that parts and service are not separate 
products for tying purposes because all service may involve 
installation of parts. Post, at 494-495, n. 2. Because the record 
does not support this factual assertion, under the approach of 
both the Court and the concurrence in Jefferson Parish 
Hospital Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2, 104 S. 
Ct. 1551 (1984), Kodak is not entitled to summary judgment 
on whether parts and service are distinct markets.
"
16,8," LEdHN[8B][
] [8B] In a footnote, Kodak contends that this practice is only a 
unilateral refusal to deal, which does not violate the antitrust 
laws. See Brief for Petitioner 15, n. 4. Assuming, arguendo, 
that Kodak's refusal to sell parts to any company providing 
service can be characterized as a unilateral refusal to deal, its 
alleged sale of parts to third parties on condition that they buy 
service from Kodak is not. See 903 F.2d at 619.
"
16,5," The Court of Appeals found: ""Kodak's policy of allowing 
customers to purchase parts on condition that they agree to 
service their own machines suggests that the demand for 
parts can be separated from the demand for service."" Id., at

16,6," Amicus briefs filed by various service organizations attest to

17,10," In their brief and at oral argument, respondents argued that 
Kodak's market share figures for high-volume copy machines, 
CAR

and 
micrographic-capture

demonstrate Kodak's market power in the equipment market. 
Brief for Respondents 16-18, 32-33; Tr. of Oral Arg. 28-31. In the Court of Appeals, however, respondents did not contest 
Kodak's assertion that its market shares indicated a 
competitive equipment market. The Court of Appeals believed 
that respondents ""do not dispute Kodak's assertion that it 
lacks market power in the [equipment] markets."" 903 F.2d at 
616, n. 3. Nor did respondents question Kodak's asserted lack 
of market power in their brief in opposition to the petition for 
certiorari, although they acknowledged that Kodak's entire 
case rested on its understanding that respondents were not 
disputing the existence of competition in the equipment 
market. Brief in Opposition 8.

understanding, United States v. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 
655, 8 L. Ed. 2d 176, 82 S. Ct. 993 (1962), respondents now 
ask us to decline to reach the merits of the questions 
presented in the petition, and instead to affirm the Ninth 
Circuit's judgment based on the factual dispute over market 
power in the equipment market. We decline respondents' 
invitation. We stated in Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, 471 U.S. 808, 
816, 85 L. Ed. 2d 791, 105 S. Ct. 2427 (1985): ""Our decision 
to grant certiorari represents a commitment of scarce judicial 
resources with a view to deciding the merits of one or more of 
the questions presented in the petition."" Because respondents 
failed to bring their objections to the premise underlying the 
questions presented to our attention in their opposition to the 
petition for certiorari, we decide those questions based on the 
same premise as the Court of Appeals, namely, that 
competition exists in the equipment market.

lies in the seller's exploitation of its control over the tying 
product to force the buyer into the purchase of a tied product 
that the buyer either did not want at all, or might have 
preferred to purchase elsewhere on different terms. When 
such 'forcing' is present, competition on the merits in the

violated."" Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 12.
"
18,11," Kodak argues that such a rule would be per se, with no 
opportunity for respondents to rebut the conclusion that 
market power is lacking in the parts market. See Brief for 
Petitioner 30-31 (""There is nothing that respondents could 
prove that would overcome Kodak's conceded lack of market 
power""); id., at 30 (discovery is ""pointless"" once the 
""dispositive fact"" of lack of market power in the equipment 
market is conceded); id., at 22 (Kodak's lack of market power 
in the equipment market ""dooms any attempt to extract 
monopoly profits"" even in an allegedly imperfect market); id., 
at 25 (it is ""impossible"" for Kodak to make more total profit by 
overcharging its existing customers for service). As an apparent second-best alternative, Kodak suggests 
elsewhere in its brief that the rule would permit a defendant to 
meet its summary judgment burden under Federal Rule of 
Civil Procedure 56(c); the burden would then shift to the 
plaintiffs to ""prove . . . that there is specific reason to believe 
that normal economic reasoning does not apply."" Brief for

19,15," What constrains the defendant's ability to raise prices in the 
service market is ""the elasticity of demand faced by the 
defendant -- the degree to which its sales fall . . . as its price 
rises."" Areeda & Kaplow P342(c), p. 576.  LEdHN[15B][
] [15B]Courts usually have considered the 
relationship between price in one market and demand in 
another in defining the relevant market. Because market 
power is often inferred from market share, market definition 
generally determines the result of the case. Pitofsky, New 
Definitions of Relevant Market and the Assault on Antitrust, 90 
Colum. L. Rev. 1805, 1806-1813 (1990). Kodak chose to focus 
on market power directly rather than arguing that the 
relationship between equipment and service and parts is such 
that the three should be included in the same market 
definition. Whether considered in the conceptual category of 
""market definition"" or ""market power,"" the ultimate inquiry is 
the same -- whether competition in the equipment market will 
significantly restrain power in the service and parts markets.
"
19,16," The United States as amicus curiae in support of Kodak 
echoes this argument: ""The ISOs' claims are implausible 
because Kodak lacks market power in the markets for its 
copier and micrographic equipment. Buyers of such equipment 
regard an increase in the price of parts or service as an 
increase in the price of the equipment, and sellers recognize 
that the revenues from sales of parts and service are 
attributable to sales of the equipment. In such circumstances, 
it is not apparent how an equipment manufacturer such as 
Kodak could exercise power in the aftermarkets for parts and 
service."" Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 8."
19,17," It is clearly true, as the United States claims, that Kodak 
""cannot set service or parts prices without regard to the impact"
19,14," See, e. g., Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 
248, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202, 106 S. Ct. 2505 (1986) (""Summary

20,," on the market for equipment."" Id., at 20. The fact that the 
cross-elasticity of demand is not zero proves nothing; the 
disputed issue is how much of an impact an increase in parts 
and service prices has on equipment sales and on Kodak's 
profits.
"
20,18," Although Kodak repeatedly relies on Continental T. V. as 
support for its factual assertion that the equipment market will 
prevent exploitation of the service and parts markets, the case 
is inapposite. In Continental T. V., the Court found that a 
manufacturer's policy restricting the number of retailers that 
were permitted to sell its product could have a procompetitive 
effect. See 433 U.S. at 55. The Court also noted that any 
negative effect of exploitation of the intrabrand market (the 
competition between retailers of the same product) would be 
checked by competition in the interbrand market (competition 
over the same generic product) because consumers would 
substitute a different brand of the same product. Unlike 
Continental T. V., this case does not concern vertical 
relationships between parties on different levels of the same"
20,," distribution chain. In the relevant market, service, Kodak and 
the ISO's are direct competitors; their relationship is horizontal. 
The interbrand competition at issue here is competition over 
the provision of service. Despite petitioner's best effort, 
repeating the mantra ""interbrand competition"" does not 
transform this case into one over an agreement the 
manufacturer has with its dealers that would fall under the 
rubric of Continental T. V.
"
21,21," To inform consumers about Kodak, the competitor must be 
willing to forgo the opportunity to reap supracompetitive prices 
in its own service and parts markets. The competitor may 
anticipate that charging lower service and parts prices and 
informing consumers about Kodak in the hopes of gaining 
future equipment sales will cause Kodak to lower the price on 
its service and parts, canceling any gains in equipment sales 
to the competitor and leaving both worse off. Thus, in an 
equipment market with relatively few sellers, competitors may 
find it more profitable to adopt Kodak's service and parts policy 
than to inform the consumers. See 2 Areeda & Turner, 
Antitrust Law P404b1; App. 177 (Kodak, Xerox, and IBM 
together have nearly 100% of relevant market). Even in a market with many sellers, any one competitor may 
not have sufficient incentive to inform consumers because the 
increased patronage attributable to the corrected consumer 
beliefs will be shared among other competitors. Beales, 
Craswell, & Salop, 24 J. Law & Econ., at 503-504, 506.
"
21,19," See Craswell, Tying Requirements in Competitive Markets: 
The Consumer Protection Issues, 62 B. U. L. Rev. 661, 676

Consumer Information, 24 J. Law & Econ. 491, 509-511

21,20," In addition, of course, in order to price accurately the 
equipment, 
a 
consumer 
would 
need 
initial 
purchase 
information such as prices, features, quality, and available 
warranties for different machinery with different capabilities,

"
22,24," The dissent disagrees based on its hypothetical case of a tie 
between equipment and service. ""The only thing lacking"" to 
bring this case within the hypothetical case, states the dissent, 
""is concrete evidence that the restrictive parts policy was . . . 
generally known."" Post, at 492. But the dissent's ""only thing 
lacking"" is the crucial thing lacking -- evidence. Whether a tie 
between parts and service should be treated identically to a tie 
between equipment and service, as the dissent and Kodak 
argue, depends on whether the equipment market prevents 
the exertion of market power in the parts market. Far from 
being ""anomalous,"" post, at 492-493, requiring Kodak to 
provide evidence on this factual question is completely 
consistent with our prior precedent. See, e. g., n. 13, supra."

also Yates & DiResta, Software Support and Hardware 
Maintenance Practices: Tying Considerations, The Computer 
Lawyer, Vol. 8, No. 6, p. 17 (1991) (describing various service 
and parts policies that enhance quality and sales but do not 
violate the antitrust laws)."
23,28," Two of the largest consumers of service and parts contend 
that they are worse off when the equipment manufacturer also 
controls service and parts. See Brief for State Farm Mutual 
Automobile Insurance Co. et al. as Amici Curiae; Brief for 
State of Ohio et al. as Amici Curiae."
23,29," LEdHN[21B][
] [21B] The dissent urges a radical departure in this Court's antitrust 
law. It argues that because Kodak has only an ""inherent"" 
monopoly in parts for its equipment, post, at 489-490, the 
antitrust laws do not apply to its efforts to expand that power 
into other markets. The dissent's proposal to grant per se 
immunity to manufacturers competing in the service market 
would exempt a vast and growing sector of the economy from 
antitrust laws. Leaving aside the question whether the Court 
has the authority to make such a policy decision, there is no 
support for it in our jurisprudence or the evidence in this case.
 Even assuming, despite the absence of any proof from the 
dissent, that all manufacturers possess some inherent market 
"
23,25," Cf.  Instructional Systems, 817 F.2d at 646 (finding the 
conspiracy reasonable under Matsushita because its goals

23,26," It bears repeating that in this case Kodak has never claimed 
that it is in fact pursuing such a pricing strategy."
24,," power in the parts market, it is not clear why that should 
immunize them from the antitrust laws in another market. The 
Court has held many times that HN6[
] power gained 
through some natural and legal advantage such as a patent, 
copyright, or business acumen can give rise to liability if ""a 
seller exploits his dominant position in one market to expand 
his empire into the next."" Times-Picayune Publishing Co. v. 
United States, 345 U.S. 594, 611, 97 L. Ed. 1277, 73 S. Ct. 
872 (1953); see, e. g., Northern Pacific R. Co. v. United 
States, 356 U.S. 1, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545, 78 S. Ct. 514 (1958); 
United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 334 U.S. 131, 92 L.

302 U.S. 458, 463, 82 L. Ed. 371, 58 S. Ct. 288 (1938). 
Moreover, on the occasions when the Court has considered 
tying in derivative aftermarkets by manufacturers, it has not 
adopted any exception to the usual antitrust analysis, treating 
derivative aftermarkets as it has every other separate market. 
See International Salt Co. v. United States, 332 U.S. 392, 92 
L. Ed. 20, 68 S. Ct. 12 (1947); International Business 
Machines Corp. v. United States, 298 U.S. 131, 80 L. Ed. 
1085, 56 S. Ct. 701 (1936); United Shoe Machinery Corp. v. 
United States, 258 U.S. 451, 66 L. Ed. 708, 42 S. Ct. 363 
(1922). Our past decisions are reason enough to reject the 
dissent's proposal. See Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 
491 U.S. 164, 172-173, 105 L. Ed. 2d 132, 109 S. Ct. 2363 
(1989) (""Considerations of stare decisis have special force in 
the area of statutory interpretation, for here, unlike in the 
context of constitutional interpretation, the legislative power is 
implicated, and Congress remains free to alter what we have 
done"").
 Nor does the record in this case support the dissent's 
proposed exemption for aftermarkets. The dissent urges its 
exemption because the tie here ""does not permit the 
manufacturer to project power over a class of consumers 
distinct from that which it is already able to exploit (and fully) 
without the inconvenience of the tie."" Post, at 498. Beyond the 
dissent's obvious difficulty in explaining why Kodak would 
adopt this expensive tying policy if it could achieve the same 
profits more conveniently through some other means, 
respondents offer an alternative theory, supported by the 
record, that suggests Kodak is able to exploit some customers 
who in the absence of the tie would be protected from 
increases in parts prices by knowledgeable customers. See 
supra, at 475-476.
 At bottom, whatever the ultimate merits of the dissent's theory, 
at this point it is mere conjecture. Neither Kodak nor the 
dissent have provided any evidence refuting respondents' 
theory of forced unwanted purchases at higher prices and 
price discrimination. While it may be, as the dissent predicts, 
that the equipment market will prevent any harms to 
consumers in the aftermarkets, the dissent never makes plain 
why the Court should accept that theory on faith rather than 
requiring the usual evidence needed to win a summary 
judgment motion.

25,30," Kodak erroneously contends that this Court in Du Pont 
rejected the notion that a relevant market could be limited to 
one brand. Brief for Petitioner 33. The Court simply held in Du 
Pont that one brand does not necessarily constitute a relevant 
market if substitutes are available.  351 U.S. at 393. See also 
Boxing Club, 358 U.S. at 249-250. Here respondents contend 
there are no substitutes."
25,31," Other courts have limited the market to parts for a particular 
brand of equipment. See, e. g., International Logistics Group, 
Ltd. v. Chrysler Corp., 884 F.2d 904, 905, 908 (CA6 1989) 
(parts for Chrysler cars is the relevant market), cert. denied, 
494 U.S. 1066, 108 L. Ed. 2d 784, 110 S. Ct. 1783 (1990); 
Dimidowich v. Bell & Howell, 803 F.2d 1473, 1480-1481, n. 3 
(CA9 1986), modified, 810 F.2d 1517 (1987) (service for Bell & 
Howell equipment is the relevant market); In re General 
Motors Corp., 99 F. T. C. 464, 554, 584 (1982) (crash parts for 
General Motors cars is the relevant market); Heatransfer Corp. 
v. Volkswagenwerk A. G., 553 F.2d 964 (CA5 1977) (air 
conditioners for Volkswagens is the relevant market), cert.

26,," support its free-rider argument. Neither is applicable. In both 
Continental T. V., 433 U.S. at 55, and Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 
762-763, the Court accepted free-riding as a justification 
because without restrictions a manufacturer would not be able 
to induce competent and aggressive retailers to make the kind 
of investment of capital and labor necessary to distribute the 
product. In Continental T. V. the relevant market level was 
retail sale of televisions and in Monsanto retail sales of 
herbicides. Some retailers were investing in those markets; 
others were not, relying, instead, on the investment of the 
other retailers. To be applicable to this case, the ISO's would 
have to be relying on Kodak's investment in the service 
market; that, however, is not Kodak's argument.

26,33, Kodak claims that both Continental T. V. and Monsanto
30,1," That there exist innumerable parts and service firms in such 
industries as the automobile industry, see Brief for Automotive 
Warehouse Distributors Association et al. as Amici Curiae 2-3, 
does not detract from this point. The question whether power 
to control an aftermarket exists is quite distinct from the 
question 
whether 
the 
power 
has 
been 
exercised. 
Manufacturers in some markets have no doubt determined 
that 
exclusionary 
intrabrand 
conduct 
works 
to 
their 
disadvantage at the competitive interbrand level, but this in no 
way refutes the self-evident reality that control over unique 
replacement parts for single-branded goods is ordinarily 
available to such manufacturers for the taking. It confounds 
sound analysis to suggest, as respondents do, see Brief for 
Respondents 5, 37, that the asserted fact that Kodak 
manufactures only 10% of its replacement parts, and 
purchases the rest from original equipment manufacturers, 
casts doubt on Kodak's possession of an inherent advantage 
in the aftermarkets. It does no such thing, any more than 
Kodak's contracting with others for the manufacture of all 
constituent parts included in its original equipment would alone 
suggest that Kodak lacks power in the interbrand micrographic 
and photocopying equipment markets. The suggestion implicit 
in respondents' analysis -- that if a seller chooses to contract 
for the manufacture of its branded merchandise, it must permit 
the contractors to compete in the sale of that merchandise -- is 
plainly unprecedented."
30,2," Even with interbrand power, I may observe, it is unlikely that 
Kodak could have incrementally exploited its position through 
the tie of parts to service alleged here. Most of the ""service"" at 
issue is inherently associated with the parts, i. e., that service 
involved in incorporating the parts into Kodak equipment, and 
the two items tend to be demanded by customers in fixed 
proportions (one part with one unit of service necessary to 
install the part). When that situation obtains, ""'no revenue can 
be derived from setting a higher price for the tied product 
which could not have been made by setting the optimum price 
for the tying product.'"" P. Areeda & L. Kaplow, Antitrust 
Analysis P426(a), p. 706 (4th ed. 1988) (quoting Bowman, 
Tying Arrangements and the Leverage Problem, 67 Yale L. J."
30,19," (1957)). These observations strongly suggest that Kodak 
parts and the service involved in installing them should not be 
treated as distinct products for antitrust tying purposes. See 
Jefferson Parish Hospital Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 39, 
80 L. Ed. 2d 2, 104 S. Ct. 1551 (1984) (O'CONNOR, J., 
concurring in judgment) (""For products to be treated as 
distinct, the tied product must, at a minimum, be one that 
some consumers might wish to purchase separately without 
also purchasing the tying product"") (emphasis in original)

32,," coherence. Whether they self-service their equipment or not, 
rational foremarket consumers (those consumers who are not 
yet ""locked in"" to Kodak hardware) will be driven to Kodak's 
competitors if the price of Kodak equipment, together with the 
expected cost of aftermarket support, exceeds competitive 
levels. This will be true no matter how Kodak distributes the 
total system price among equipment, parts, and service. See 
supra, at 495. Thus, as to these consumers, Kodak's lack of 
interbrand power wholly prevents it from employing a tie 
between 
parts 
and 
service 
as 
a 
vehicle 
for 
price 
discrimination. Nor does a tie between parts and service offer 
Kodak incremental exploitative power over those consumers -- 
sophisticated or not -- who have the supposed misfortune of 
being ""locked in"" to Kodak equipment. If Kodak desired to 
exploit its circumstantial power over this wretched class by 
pressing them up to the point where the cost to each 
consumer of switching equipment brands barely exceeded the 
cost of retaining Kodak equipment and remaining subject to 
Kodak's abusive practices, it could plainly do so without the 
inconvenience of a tie, through supracompetitive parts pricing 
alone. Since the locked-in sophisticated parts purchaser is as 
helpless as the locked-in unsophisticated one, I see nothing to 
be gained by price discrimination in favor of the former. If such 
price discrimination were desired, however, it would not have 
to be accomplished indirectly, through a tie of parts to service. 
Section 2(a) of the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U. S. C. ยง 13(a), 
would prevent giving lower parts prices to the sophisticated 
customers only ""where the effect of such discrimination may 
be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a 
monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or 
prevent competition with any person who either grants or 
knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with 
customers of either of them . . . ."" Ibid.; see, e. g., Falls City 
Industries, Inc. v. Vanco Beverage, Inc., 460 U.S. 428, 434-
435, 75 L. Ed. 2d 174, 103 S. Ct. 1282 (1983). That prohibited 
effect often occurs when price-discriminated goods are sold 
for resale (i. e., to purchasers who are necessarily in 
competition with one another).  E. g., FTC v. Morton Salt Co., 
334 U.S. 37, 47, 92 L. Ed. 1196, 68 S. Ct. 822 (1948); see P. 
Areeda & L. Kaplow, Antitrust Analysis P600, p. 923 (1988) 
(""Secondary-line injury arises [under the Robinson-Patman 
Act] when a powerful firm buying supplies at favorable prices 
thereby gains a decisive advantage over its competitors that 
are forced to pay higher prices for their supplies""). It rarely 
occurs where, as would be the case here, the price-
discriminated goods are sold to various businesses for 
consumption.
"
32,3," The Court insists that the record in this case suggests 
otherwise, i. e., that a tie between parts and service somehow 
does enable Kodak to increase overall monopoly profits. See 
ante, at 479-481, n. 29. Although the Court does not identify 
the record evidence on which it relies, the suggestion, 
apparently, is that such a tie facilitates price discrimination 
between 
sophisticated, 
""high-volume"" 
users 
of 
Kodak 
equipment and their unsophisticated counterparts. The 
sophisticated users (who, the Court presumes, invariably self-
service their equipment) are permitted to buy Kodak parts 
without also purchasing supracompetitively priced Kodak 
service, while the unsophisticated are -- through the imposition 
of the tie -- compelled to buy both. See ante, at 475-476. While superficially appealing, at bottom this explanation lacks
