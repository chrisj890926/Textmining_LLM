(1) The anti-trust statute of Missouri does not infringe upon the liberty of the citizen to contract concerning his 
property and prohibit him the enjoyment of his property and impose restraints and burdens upon it without due 
process of law. Road Co. v. Sanford, 164 U.S. 592; Waters-Pierce Oil Co. v. State, 44 H. R. W. R. 938; U. S. v. 
Joint Traffic Ass'n, 171 U.S. 505. These statutes are founded upon a proper exercise of the general police authority 
of the State. Beach on Trusts and Monopolies, sec. 13; Munn v. Illinois, 94 U.S. 124; Railroad v. Beckwith, 129 U.S. 
29; State v. Moore, 104 N. C. 710; Thorp v. Railroad, 27 Vt. 140; Bertholf v. O'Rielly, 74 N. Y. 521. The State, in the 
exercise of this power in the selection of remedies looking to the suppression of evil and harm to its people, may 
apply them to the most sacred contracts and to the uses of property of every description, not in the way of an 
arbitrary spoliation or confiscation in the capricious exercise of the police power, but a useful regulation in the 
interest of the public welfare. Cooley's [***2]  Const. Lim. (6 Ed.), pp. 707-720. In enumerating subjects which are 
acted upon by the State in the exercise of its police power, a late writer on limitations of police powers names 
combinations in restraint of trade. In U. S. v. Trans-Missouri Freight Ass'n, 166 U.S. 322, the court said: ""While the 
statute prohibits all combinations in the form of trusts or otherwise, the limitation is not confined to that form alone. 
152 Mo. 1, *1; 52 S.W. 595, **595; 1899 Mo. LEXIS 201, ***1

 
All combinations which are in restraint of trade or commerce are prohibited, whether in the form of trusts or in any 
other form whatever."" Tiedeman on Lims. of Police Powers, sec. 96a; Railroad v. Mathews, 165 U.S. 16; Crowley v. 
Christenson, 137 U.S. 89. The Federal Supreme Court has decided that it was not the design of the Fourteenth 
Amendment to the Constitution of the United States to interfere with the just and proper exercise of the police power 
by the States. Barbier v. Connolly, 113 U.S. 31; Davis v. Mass, 167 U.S. 47; Oil Co. v. State, 44 S. W. Rep. 938. (2) 
If legislative authority does exist to restrain the conduct of owners of property in a particular way in the use of their 
property so as to work injury to the public welfare, and the legislature has acted [***3]  in the manner required by 
the Constitution in passing laws, then due process of law exists in so far as it is necessary to find legal authority for 
passing a statute similar to our anti-trust act, prohibiting all combinations in restraint of trade. Legal restraint 
imposed upon the use of property does not deprive the owner of it of due process of law. Railroad v. Mathews, 165 
U.S. 23; Railroad v. Hume, 115 U.S. 519; Barbier v. Connelly, 113 U.S. 31; Walston v. Nevin, 128 U.S. 582; 
Railroad v. Gibbes, 142 U.S. 387; Bertholf v. O'Reilly, 74 N. Y. 519; Mulger v. Kansas, 123 U.S. 653; Davidson v. 
New Orleans, 96 U.S. 104. (3) The anti-trust statute is not obnoxious to the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal 
constitution, as being class legislation. U. S. v. Pipe Co., 85 Fed. Rep. 285; Association v. Houck, 27 S. W. Rep. 
696; Brewing Co. v. Templeman, 38 S. W. Rep. 27; Puqua v. Chicago Milk Shippers' Ass'n, 155 Ill. 166; U. S. v. 
Trans-Missouri Freight Ass'n, 166 U.S. 299; People v. Railroad, 121 N. Y. 616; Hathaway v. State, 38 Tex. Crim. 
App. 261; People ex rel. v. American Tobacco Company (1897), 2 Chicago, L. J. Weekly, p. 249; Casualty Co. v. 
Alibone, 90 Tex. 660; Ins. Co. v. Levy,  [***4]  33 S. W. Rep. 992; Campbell v. Cook, 86 Tex. 684; Railroad v. 
Mackay, 127 U.S. 209; Railroad v. Beckwith, 129 U.S. 29; Railroad v. New York, 165 U.S. 623; Soone Hing v.

714. (4) No covenant in restraint of trade can be enforced unless the covenant embodying it is merely ancillary to 
the main purpose of a lawful contract and necessary to protect the covenantee in the enjoyment of the legitimate 
fruits of the contract or to protect him from the dangers of an unjust use of those fruits by the other party. U. S. v. 
Pipe Co., Fed. Rep. 282; Frisbie v. U. S., 157 U.S. 160; Holden v. Hardy, 169 U.S. 391; Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 
1 Wheat. 304; Blair v. Ridgely, 41 Mo. 63. (5) Insurance combines to fix, maintain and control rates of insurance 
tend to and do suppress competition and such combines violate the anti-trust statute of Missouri. Hartford Fire Ins. 
Co. v. Raymond, Ins. Com., 70 Mich. 485; Beechley v. Mulvihill, 70 N. W. Rep. 107; American Fire Ins. Co. v. State,

and Cattle Feeding Co., 156 Ill. 448; U. S. v. Addyston Pipe and Steel Co., 85 Fed. Rep. 271; Moore v. Bennett, 
140 Ill. 69; Cooke's Trade and Labor Combinations, p. 120; Greenhood on Public Policy, pp. 854-55-56-57; 3 Ins. 
Law Magazine, p. 42. (6) Agreements between insurance companies to fix and maintain rates tend to the 
suppression of competition and constitute a strict monopoly. Lawrence v. Kidder, 10 Barb. 64; Dunlop v. Gregory, 
10 N. Y. 244; Beach on Industrial Trusts, secs. 10 and 11; People v. Sugar Refining Co., 54 Hun. 354; Sandiego 
Water Co. v. Flume Co., 108 Cal. 549; California Steam Navigation Co. v. Wright, 6 Cal.259; U. S. Trans-Missouri 
Freight Ass'n, 166 U.S. 290. And monopolies are against common right. Craven v. Rodgers, 101 Mo. 243. (7) 
Where a corporation uses its franchises for the purpose of establishing a trust, or enters into a trust to create a 
monopoly and stifle competition, the State can forfeit the corporate franchise. People v. North River Sugar Refining 
Co., 121 N. Y. 582; People v. Milk Exchange, 145 N. Y. 267; State v. Standard Oil Co., 49 Oh. St.  [***6]  137; 
People v. Chicago Gas Trust Co., 130 Ill. 268; People v. Distilling and Cattle Feeding Co., 156 Ill. 448. The scheme 
inaugurated in the city of St. Joseph was intended to and did constitute a monopoly in the fixing of insurance rates 
in the hands of the respondent companies because it created a common rate and abolished competition. The 
""Social Club"" fixed the rate of insurance and dominated the business. This created a trust. Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. 
Raymond, Ins. Com., 70 Mich. 485; State v. Krebs, 64 N. C. 604; People v. Sugar Refining Co., 121 N. Y. 624;

Hyde Park, 97 U.S. 666; People v. North River Sugar Refining Co., 121 N. Y. 582. (8) The acts of the agents of the 
foreign insurance corporations, in entering into a combination to fix rates of insurance in violation of the antitrust 
law, bind the corporations where reports are made to the companies [***7]  and they accept the benefits of said 
organization. Waters-Pierce Oil Co. v. State, 44 S. W. Rep. 936; Ins. Co. v. Raymond, 70 Mich. 485; State ex rel. v. 
Aetna Ins. Co., 150 Mo. 113. (9) It is no answer to a combination of this kind to say that it should be permitted to 
exist for the reason that it has reduced the prices of insurance, even though such were true. That policy may be

necessary to crush competition. Such combinations have been frequently condemned by courts as unlawful and 
against public policy. Hoeker v. Vandewater, 4 Denio 349; Stanton v. Allen, 5 Denio 434; Coal Co. v. Coal Co., 68 
Pa. St. 186; Craft v. McConoughy, 79 Ill. 346; Hannah v. Fife, 27 Mich. 172; Alger v. Thatcher, 19 Pick. 51. In 
numerous cases restrictions have been condemned, notwithstanding they produced for a while the lowering of 
prices. Anderson v. Jett, 89 Ky. 375; Hoffman v. Brooks, 23 Am. L. Reg. 648; People v. Milk Exchange, 145 N. Y.

(1) This suit is in the nature of a public accusation, and if the State makes out its case, the judgment is penal, and in 
such case the burden of proof is upon the State to prove the charges [***8]  as alleged. 5 Thompson's Com. on 
Corps., sec. 6804; State ex. inf. v. Bland, 144 Mo. 534; High ex. Remedies, sec. 710; State ex rel. v. Talbots, 123 
Mo. 69; 2 Spell ex. Relief, secs. 1850, 1851, 1860. (2) The overwhelming weight of evidence establishes the fact 
that the Underwriters' Social Club of St. Joseph, Mo., was not created, formed or organized, conducted or carried 
on for the purpose of fixing or maintaining rates of insurance in that city, or for the purpose of controlling rates of 
insurance in any respect, and that it did not either fix, control or maintain rates of insurance according to Fetter's 
estimates. Anderson v. U. S., 171 U.S. 604. (3) None of the respondents authorized directed or acquiesced in the 
acts of their local agents, in becoming members of the Underwriters' Social Club of St. Joseph, Mo., during the 
period covered by this suit, and none of the defendants, were aware or informed at any time prior to the production 
of this suit, that said club was engaged in the business of fixing or maintaining rates of fire insurance, or in any way, 
charged with doing same, in the city of St. Joseph, Mo. (4) The information filed by relator, does not state facts 
sufficient [***9]  to constitute a cause of action. State ex inf. v. Bland, 144 Mo. 534. (5) The Act approved April 2, 
1891, as amended by the Acts of April 11, 1895, and March 24, 1897, is repugnant to the Constitution of the State 
of Missouri, for the following reasons: First. It infringes the provisions of section 28 of article IV, which provides that 
no bill shall contain more than one subject, which shall be clearly expressed in its title. State v. Schofield, 41 Mo. 
49; St. Louis v. Teifel, 42 Mo. 578; State v. Bensinger, 76 Mo. 346; State v. Blackstone, 115 Mo. 427; State ex rel. 
v. County Court, 128 Mo. 427; Witzman v. Railway Co., 131 Mo. 612; State ex rel. v. Hover, 134 Mo. 10; Paul v.

Mass. 92; Hooper v. California, 155 U.S. 655. Second. It violates section 30 of article II, which provides that no 
person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law. State v. Loomis, 115 Mo. 316; State 
v. Julow, 129 Mo. 177; Cooley, Const. Lim. (6 Ed.), 481, 483. (6) That said Act, as amended, is unconstitutional, in 
that section 1, of said Act, is violative of section [***10]  1 of the XIVth Amendment to the Constitution of the United 
States, which provides that no State shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law, 
nor deny any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the law, in this, that each of said companies 
having fully complied with the laws of the State, having paid the fees, made all the deposits, secured the necessary 
license required by law, they were each authorized to do business in this State, under the protection of the laws of 
the State, and that said Act deprives them of the right to carry on their business in a fair and just manner among 
themselves and not in any manner injurious to the public or any other person in the State, and deprives them of the 
right of making necessary and reasonable contracts relating to the business of insurance, and discriminates against 
them and in favor of other domestic and foreign fire insurance companies who are not embraced within the terms of 
said law. Duncan v. Missouri, 152 U.S. 377; Marchant v. Railroad, 153 U.S. 390; Barbier v. Connolly, 113 U.S. 27; 
Missouri v. Lewis, 101 U.S. 22. (7) Courts are extremely reluctant to adjudge a forfeiture of franchise,  [***11]  
especially in a case of this character. Topeka v. Topeka Water Co., 49 Pac. Rep. 79; State ex rel. v. Republican, 9

The clause, sec. 5, ch. 88, laws 1900, ""If such other corporation be engaged in the same kind of business and be a 
competitor therein,"" applies to both of the clauses preceding it--that is to say, it applies as well to the clause against 
a corporation, acquiring the capital stock of other corporations, as to the clause against a corporation acquiring the 
franchise, plant or equipments of other corporations. It is one entire sentence, with simply a comma before the word 
""nor."" Ordinary grammatical construction of the sentence will demonstrate this.
Bearing in mind that the law under consideration was passed to define trusts and combines, and to provide for the 
suppression thereof, and to preserve to the people of this state the benefits derived from competition; and 
remembering that a trust or combination could not be created by one corporation,  [***2]  engaged in a certain kind 
of business, acquring part or all of the capital stock of another corporation, engaged in a different kind of business, 
the unsoundness of the attorney-general's contention is apparent.
If the attorney-general's construction of this law is correct, a corporation may purchase the franchise, plant and 
equipments of a noncompetitive corporation, thereby getting absolute control of the whole thing with full power to 
dictate its full policy, and yet he would not allow the same corporation to purchase one share of stock in a 
noncompetitive corporation, in which latter event, its interest would be so small that it would have no control over its 
policy.
The effect of the construction contended for by the attorney-general will be looked to by the court in construing the 
statute. This is more extensive and far reaching than may appear at first view. Upon such construction an 
incorporated bank could not invest its surplus in the stock of any railroad company or other corporations, whose 
stock is quoted and sold every day in the stock exchanges of the country.
No insurance company could invest its surplus or earnings in the stock of any other corporation [***3]  whatever. 
Savings banks, incorporated, would be restricted in their business investments to bonds or mortgages, and the 
stock exchanges of the world would be closed against them. In a word, every corporation in this state incorporated 
by the state, would be shut out of every stock exchange in the world, so far as dealings in stocks are concerned.
The interest of the individual stockholder would be seriously and injuriously affected by such a construction. No 
stockholder could sell his stock to a Mississippi corporation, but could only sell to individuals. Nor could any 
78 Miss. 831, *831; 29 So. 514, **514; 1901 Miss. LEXIS 131, ***1

 
stockholder borrow money from any incorporated bank or financial institution in the state on his stock as collateral 
security, for no bank would take as collateral security a certificate of stock that it could not own.
The purpose to effect such extensive and radical changes in the business in the state cannot reasonably be 
attributed to the legislature.
Monroe McClurg, attorney-general, pro se.
An attorney-general, in giving his opinions to the governor as to whether a proposed charter is violative of the 
constitution and laws of the state, should resolve all doubts against the proposed charter for [***4]  the same reason 
that the courts determine doubtful questions as to whether corporations possess certain powers against the 
corporation. All grants of power by the sovereign are to be strictly construed against the grant. The best 
interpretation of the law is the law itself. Section 8 of chapter 88 of the laws of 1900 is too plain and unambiguous to 
call for aids of construction outside of its own clear and logical language and meaning. The clear purpose and intent 
of the statute, as gathered from its own language, is (1) to deny the right to any corporation, as such, to purchase or 
own any of the capital stock of any other corporation, and (2) to deny one corporation the right to purchase or to 
acquire the franchise, plant or equipments of a competing corporation.
No man can conceive of a more powerful scheme for forming the most powerful combinations than that contended 
for by appellants. A single bank or a railroad company, a telegraph, express or telephone company might subscribe 
for or in some other manner ""purchase or own"" a majority of the capital stock of every noncompeting corporation in 
the state, and allow such other corporations to share in its stocks and profits. Nor [***5]  is it easier to find a better 
illustration than the charter under consideration. A gravel company, organized for the purpose of owning and 
operating gravel pits, together with all other powers incidental thereto and necessary to the successful operation of 
the gravel pits, demands the power to ""purchase, subscribe for, take and hold, sell and deal in the stock of and 
shares of the capital stock of any corporation, joint stock company or association organized under or chartered by 
the laws of any state of the United States, or under or by the laws of the United States; Provided, Such corporation, 
association or joint stock company is not a competitor or engaged in the same kind of business."" How can such 
powers reasonably conduce to the lawful operation of a gravel pit? Who can imagine the extent of such powers? 
We must presume that full advantage will be taken of every power granted.
Section 883 of the code requires ""clear and definite statement of the purposes for which the corporation is created . 
. . and the powers to be exercised."" Here it is clearly and definitely stated that the purpose is to operate a ""gravel 
pit,"" and it may be expected that all powers necessary to the [***6]  successful operation of the pit should be 
granted, but nothing beyond that. So that, looking to this statute merely as a side light by which to read section 5 of 
the act of 1900, it is made the more evident that the power to invest in the capital stock of other noncompeting 
corporations is not within the reasonable contemplation of the powers to successfully operate a gravel pit."

A different rule prevails, however, where the party repents in due season, asks to withdraw from the contract, does 
withdraw from it, tenders back what he has received, and [**13]  asks restitution of what is his. If the repentance 
12 Ohio Dec. 386, *386; 1902 Ohio Misc. LEXIS 18, **8

 
comes in due season, and restitution can be made, courts will take jurisdiction of the matter and grant the relief.

in and had no knowledge of the transaction: Eddy Combinations, Secs. 1138, 1139, 1140; Leslie v. Lorillard, 40

charter for an illegal purpose they thereby perpetrate a fraud upon the State, on account of which the State can, in a

Any action by a corporation whereby the directors or shareholders in it are enabled to and do, through the 
corporation, effect a combination of their capital, skill, and acts for the purpose of preventing competition between 
aids to [***4]  commerce constitutes the corporation itself a trust and renders it, alike with those who under its guise 
accomplish their illegal purposes, guilty of a violation of and subjects it to the penalties prescribed by the law which 
defines trusts.  Rev. Stats., art. 5313; Const. of Texas, art. 1, sec. 26; Railway v. Baptist Church, 108 U.S., 317;

The court erred in rendering a judgment for the defendant and in failing to render a judgment for the State forfeiting 
the charter of the defendant corporation, because the evidence established the fact, as found by the court, that the 
defendant had misused and abused its powers in violation of the policy and of the Constitution [***5]  and laws of 
the State, and had usurped and exercised powers not conferred upon it, in a manner that produces injury to the 
public by affecting the welfare of the people, in this: (a) That it acquired and thereby brought under one 
management and prevented and is preventing competition between existing competing cotton compresses, the 
same being competing aids to commerce.  (b) That it acquired and thereby brought under one ownership and 
management existing competing cotton compresses, the same being competing aids to commerce, for the purpose 
of closing them down.  (c) That it acquired and thereby brought under one ownership and management existing 
competing cotton compresses, the same being competing aids to commerce, and thereby created and is now 
maintaining a monopoly in the business of compressing cotton. 
A corporate franchise is granted and held upon condition that it be exercised for the attainment of the objects 
specified, and when a corporation is guilty of acts contrary to either the statute or common law, the charter of the 
corporation may be forfeited.  Rev. Stats., art. 3528; Insurance Co. v. State, 86 Texas, 274; 1 Eddy on 
Combinations, 607; Coal Co. v. Coal Co., 68 [***6]  Pa., 186; 2 Mora. on Priv. Corp., sec. 1024; People of New 
York v. Sugar Ref. Co., 2 Law. Rep. Ann., 39; People v. Live Stock Exchange Co., 39 Law. Rep. Ann., 377. 
A corporation which exceeds its powers in any important particular commits a breach of an implied condition of the 
contract, and may be properly held subject to the penalty of a forfeiture.  Insurance Co. v. State, 86 Texas, 274; 
Debenture Co. v. Louisiana, 180 U.S., 320; 5 Thomp. on Corp., 609; 2 Cook on Corp., 633; 1 Eddy on 
Combinations, sec. 607. 
At the hearing of this case in the District Court and on its submission in the appellate court it was assumed that the 
anti-trust statutes of 1889 and 1895 were valid, but the Court of Civil Appeals, following the holding of the Supreme 
Court of the United States in the case of Connally v. Union Sewer Pipe Company, based their decision, affirming 
the judgment appealed from, upon the ground that each of these enactments were unconstitutional.  It is 
respectfully submitted that the constitutionality of the statutes referred to is not involved in this case, the sole 
purpose of which is to forfeit the charter of the defendant corporation. 
A charter of a corporation is a contract [***7]  between the sovereignty which grants it and the incorporators.  The 
State grants a charter subject to any conditions which it may see proper to impose.  It could reserve the right to 
repeal the charter at any time and for any reason, or without reason.  4 Thomp. on Corp., sec. 4512.  When the 
corporators accept the charter they accept it subject to this right, and are estopped from raising the question of the 
legality of the terms of the contract which they have made.  There is no difference in this respect between the 
charter of a domestic corporation and the permit granted to a foreign corporation authorizing it to transact business 
within the State. 
In the case of the Waters Pierce Oil Company v. State of Texas, 177 United States, 28, in which the constitutionality 
of the Texas anti-trust statutes of 1889 and 1895 were presented, the Supreme Court of the United States held that 
it was immaterial whether they were constitutional or not; that although discriminations were imposed by these 
statutes (discriminations which have since been held by the same court to have rendered the law nugatory), still the 
corporation acceded to the conditions (however reasonable or unreasonable, discriminatory [***8]  or otherwise 
they may have been) upon which the State was willing to and did grant it the desired permit, and that for the 
violation of these conditions the permit could be canceled.  If the Waters Pierce Oil Company had been a domestic 
corporation its charter could have been canceled as its permit was, and this entirely regardless of the question as to 
whether or not the statutes of 1889 and 1895 were constitutional. 
In the case of Connally v. Union Sewer Pipe Company, 184 United States, 540, it is expressly stated by the justice 
who rendered the opinion of that court, that if the defendant in that case had been a domestic corporation its charter 
could have been forfeited.  This is entirely in accord with the decision in the case of the Waters Pierce Oil Company 
v. State, and is in line with the holding of the courts, including the Supreme Court of the United States.  Doyle v.

The Legislature did not intend by the acts of 1889 and 1895, or either of them, to prohibit the organization of 
corporations for the purpose of purchasing competing properties.  That end was sought to be attained only by the 
Act of 1899, which does not include compress companies within its aims.  Anti-Trust Acts 1889; Anti-Trust Act 
1895; Anti-Trust Act 1899; Insurance Co. v. State, 86 Texas, 250. 
It is not unlawful for an individual or a corporation to merely acquire competing properties.  1 Eddy on Com., sec.

It was not unlawful for the promoters of the defendant corporation [***10]  to procure the charter in question, it being 
authorized by statutes of the State. Rev. Stats., art. 642, subdiv. 28. 
Two lawful acts committed in a lawful way, namely, the procuring of a charter in a manner authorized by law and 
the acquisition of property thereunder, do not prove a criminal conspiracy, but the intention to defraud or to restrain

or on any corporation, domestic or foreign, and can not impose any duty or inflict any penalty on any corporation.

The charter of the defendant company is a contract between it and the State, which can not be forfeited except for 
violation of the contract itself, or for the violation of a valid law of the State.  Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4

357; State v. Turnpike Co., 2 Sneed (Tenn.), 254. 
The Court of Civil Appeals having decided that there was no evidence of any combination, or any agreement in 
violation of the statute, this court is without jurisdiction to revise its ruling and to determine to the contrary, and to 
substitute its decision on a question of fact for the decision of the Court of Civil Appeals.  Const., art. 5, sec. 6; Rev. 
Stats., art. 940; Warren v. City of Denison, 89 Texas, 557; Agency Co. Case, 86 Texas, 179; Dillingham v.

Baker, Botts, Baker & Lovett, also for defendant in error. -- The anti-trust statutes of this State are in contravention 
of section 1, article 14,  [***12]  of the amendments of the Constitution of the United States, providing that no State 
shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor deny to any person within its 
jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws, and are therefore void. 
Since the statutes are in contravention of the Federal Constitution, they are absolutely void, and can not authorize 
the forfeiture of defendant's charter, or be given any effect whatever as laws.

The transactions in question are not illegal under the common law, and if they were, the penalty of forfeiture could 
not be inflicted. 
Even if the anti-trust statutes are entitled to any effect whatever in this case, they are not applicable to the 
occupation or service of compressing cotton, for there being no element of barter or sale involved, combinations 
affecting that business are not prohibited by such statutes. 
The anti-trust statutes of this State were not intended to prohibit the purchase and sale of property where the 
restriction of competition is merely an incident but not the controlling object and purpose.  An intent to suppress or 
restrict competition is the gist of the offenses denounced by the statute;  [***13]  and no such intent appears in this 
case. 
Rates for the compression of cotton are subject to regulation by the Railroad Commission, and are therefore not 
within the operation of the anti-trust statutes in any event."

Ann. 168. The acts of the managers and salesmen and agents of respondents bind the corporations. A corporation 
can only act through agents, and if the agents' acts or practices are in violation of law, the [***2]  corporation must 
suffer the consequences. A corporation can and must control its agents and must see at its peril that its agents do 
not violate the law while attending to the business of the company. 152 Mo. 38. The Supreme Court of Missouri, as 
well as the courts of other States, hold that a corporation is liable for the acts of its agents, committed while in the 
prosecution of the company's business entrusted to their care, although the act is unknown to the president or 
board of directors of the corporation. 152 Mo. 381; 47 Mo. 442; 75 Mo. 325; 48 Mo. 152; 3 Mo. App. 442; 2 Mo. 
App. 540; 55 Mo. 214; 29 Mo. 38; 62 Mo. App. 119; Cooley on Torts (2 Ed.), 119, 120; 44 S. W. 936; 70 Mich. 485; 
150 Mo. 113. The officer or agent of the corporation represents the corporation when he is acting within the scope 
of his duties, and his knowledge, while so engaged, with reference to matters pertaining to that branch of the 
business of the corporation, is the knowledge of the corporation. Elliott on Private Corporations, 247. The 
admissions and statements of an agent made while he is acting in the course of the performance of his duties as 
agent, with reference to any existing state of affairs [***3]  of the business in which he is engaged, become a part of 
the res gestae and are clearly admissible against the principal. 48 Mo. 41. In this case, however, no effort has been 
made to show that the president and board of directors and the chief officers of the corporation did not have 
knowledge of the acts of their agents in fixing, maintaining and controlling the prices of the packers' products in this 
State. In the insurance cases, the officers of the companies were put upon the stand and they testified that the acts 
of the agents were without authority from them and that they knew nothing of them, but the court held that as the 
company received the benefit of the acts of the agents and that as the agents were entrusted with the care and 
conduct of the business of the corporation in this state, their acts bound the corporation. In the case at bar, there is 
no such denial made by the president and board of directors of the corporation, and respondents stand silent in the 
face of the proof of the facts that their general managers and salesmen who were entrusted with the conduct of 
their business and the sale and disposition of their products direct to the butchers and the consuming [***4]  public 
in this State, made and entered into a combination to fix, regulate, maintain and control the prices to be paid for 
dressed beef, pork and cured meats. The acts of agents of a corporation within the scope of their employment are 
the acts of the corporation, and are evidence against it. The Supreme Court of this State in 1871, in the case of 
Northrup v. Mississippi Valley Ins. Co., 47 Mo. 442, said: ""A corporation acts through its officers; and the 
admissions of such officers made in the execution of the duties imposed upon them concerning matters in which 
they are called upon to act, and which matter is within the scope of the authority usually exercised by them, are 
evidence against the corporation."" Pitts v. Steele Mercantile Company, 75 Mo. App. 232. Declarations and 
admissions of officers and agents of a corporation are admissible in evidence against the corporation for any 
purpose for which and under the same circumstances under which declarations and admissions of a natural person 
are admissible against him, although neither expressly authorized or ratified by the corporation, if they were made 
by an officer or agent in the course of a transaction on behalf of the corporation,  [***5]  and within the scope of his 
general power. 3 Clark & Marshall on Corporations, pp. 2216, 2217, 2218; Kirkstall Brewery Co. v. Railroad, L. R.

of the packers' product is proven in this case. The proof of this express agreement as to the fresh pork is competent 
evidence against each of the respondents tending to prove the conspiracy between respondents to fix, regulate and 
control the price to be paid for dressed beef, because it proves an unlawful agreement and relationship to exist 
between respondents with reference to carrying on a portion of the business that they all engaged in, to-wit, the 
pork business. 38 Oh. St. 581; 46 [***6]  Mich. 268; 2 Day (Conn.) 205; 25 Conn. 486; 6 T. R. 527; 2 Esp. N. 719;

bound by the agents' acts. 44 S. W. 936; Elliott on Pri. Corp., sec. 247; 152 Mo. 37; 144 Mo. 420. It is [***7]  not 
necessary to invoke the provisions of section 8971, Revised Statutes 1899, making acts of a foreign corporation 
prima facie proof of the act of the corporation, and the State invokes no prima facie presumptions under this statute, 
because agency of the managers and salesmen of respondents has been proven in this case just as it would be in 
any other where the question of the fact of agency is to be determined. If a conspiracy to fix, maintain, regulate and 
control the prices to be paid for dressed pork, beef and cured meats between respondents and others has been 
proven, then the acts and declarations of one of the respondents or its agents in the conduct of the business of

Bennett, 62 Vt. 50. The res gestae was the sale to the butcher -- not as to whether the principal was in some 
combination. There was no pretense that the persons who made the statements had formed a combination, but the 
statement was that some one else higher in authority did so. (2)  [***9]  It is only fair to the commissioner to say that 
his idea must have been that the doctrine of the Insurance Cases, 152 Mo. 1, was that no corporation charged with 
a violation of the antitrust law could question the authority of any employee, and hence all statements of all 
employees could be shown. Such a rule applies to no other kind of case and would make such a discrimination as 
would deprive respondents of the protection of the fourteenth amendment to the Federal Constitution. The 
Insurance Cases teach no such doctrine, for the rule is as stated in 9 Am. and Eng. Ency. of Law (2 Ed.), 590.

Railroad v. Arnett, 111 Fed. 854; Gembel v. Adams, 54 Iowa 389; s. c., 6 N. W. 582; Corbin v. Adams, 6 Cush. 93; 
Batchelder v. Emery, 20 N. H. 165. (3) The alleged high prices in beef at the time of filing of the information was 
because of the high price of the live animals. The testimony on this subject is: The prices of the live animal 
controlled the price of the fresh meat. When the price of the live animal went up the price of the fresh meat likewise 
increased. It so happened that [***10]  in the spring of 1902 the prices were unusually large, based on the short 
supply of cattle, and the high price of grain and the drouth. The testimony of R. H. Allen is especially valuable in this 
connection and it finds strong support in the article of Fred C. Croxton, one of statisticians of the United States 
Bureau of Statistics, entitled: ""The Advance in Beef Prices,"" found in the January, 1903, number of the Review of 
Reviews (pp. 69-74.) Many of the State's witnesses expressly conceded that the advance in price was only in 
accordance with the advance in the price of the live animal. (4) The Attorney-General is insistent upon a judgment 
of ouster. A suspensive judgment of ouster was entered in the Insurance Cases and without careful thought a like 
judgment might be suggested in these cases. Unlike the case of the Insurance Companies, Swift & Company and 
Hammond Packing Company have extensive packing house plants at St. Joseph, and any kind of judgment of 
ouster would absolutely prevent the use of the property if section 8972, of the Revised Statutes 1899, be valid, or at 
least create such a cloud on the title as to render difficult any future sale of the property. (5) Even if a [***11]  
judgment of ouster should go, it should be limited to ousting respondents from the particular illegal act charged, i. 
173 Mo. 356, *356; 73 S.W. 645, **645; 1903 Mo. LEXIS 257, ***6

 
e., from fixing or maintaining prices to local butchers on the sale of fresh meats from the coolers at St. Joseph and 
St. Louis. The respondents have large and extensive packing houses; they buy millions of dollars of live stock in 
this State and ship their products to all portions of the State. These acts are separate and distinct from the mere 
sale of fresh meats to local butchers from local coolers, which was an infinitesimal part of respondents' business. 
Therefore, a judgment should go no further than to declare ""respondents are ousted from the alleged right or 
privilege of being parties to any combination to fix and maintain the prices on fresh meats sold from the coolers at 
St. Joseph and St. Louis to the local butchers in those cities."" Such is the extent of the offense or illegal right 
exercised. There is no doubt of the right to render a restricted judgment of ouster. This was decided in State ex inf. 
v. Lincoln Trust Co., 144 Mo. 599, where the court refused to enter a general ouster because of illegal acts but 
restricted the judgment to one of ouster against [***12]  the particular illegal acts. So it has elsewhere been 
decided. State ex rel. v. Portland Natural Gas & Oil Co., 153 Ind. 483; s. c., 53 N. E. 1092; State ex rel. v. Railroad, 
47 Oh. St. 130; s. c., 23 N. E. 928; State ex rel. v. Standard Oil Co., 49 Oh. St. 137; s. c., 30 N. E. 291. Such a 
course was pursued in Yore v. Superior Court, 108 Cal. 431; s. c., 41 Pac. 477; State v. Turnpike Co., 10 Conn. 
167; State v. Topeka, 30 Kan. 653; s. c., 2 Pac. 592; State v. Regents, 55 Kan. 389; s. c., 40 Pac. 656; People v. 
Railroad, 15 Wend. (N. Y.) 113; Com. v. Canal Co., 43 Pa. St. 301. These cases only apply the well-settled rule that 
in quo warranto the character of judgment rests entirely within the discretion of the court. State v. Bernoudy, 36 Mo. 
281; Weston v. Lane, 40 Kan. 479; s. c., 20 Pac. 260; 5 Thompson on Corporations, sec. 6812. So it was decided 
in State ex rel. v. Omaha & Council Bluffs Ry. & Bridge Co., 91 Iowa 517; s. c., 60 N. W. 126, a case against a 
foreign corporation failing to take out a license, and where the judgment was of ouster unless defendant should 
within sixty days qualify under the foreign corporation act. (6) No judgment of ouster should be entered. (a) 
A [***13]  general judgment of ouster would be unequal and unfair to Swift & Company and Hammond Packing 
Company. These companies have large packing houses at St. Joseph. A general judgment of ouster prevents the 
future use of this property (R. S. 1899, sec. 8972) by respondents or their assigns. Nelson Morris & Company have 
a like plant at St. Joseph. It is a copartnership, and can not be ousted, and yet it was found to be a party to the 
combination. Hence, for the same offense, Swift and Hammond lose their property and their right to do business, 
leaving their rival with its property and master of the St. Joseph business, and thus the court, by a stroke of the pen, 
creates an absolute monopoly. Armour Packing Company and Cudahy Packing Company have plants in Kansas 
City, almost adjoining the State line. They can cease doing business in this State but they still have their packing 
houses and can continue to serve the public elsewhere. They are found to have been in the same combination with 
Swift and Hammond, yet the latter must close and lose their packing houses while their lucky conspirators save 
theirs. It is, therefore, manifest that a general judgment of ouster would operate unequally,  [***14]  imposing upon 
those found equally guilty unequal penalties. (b) The following are other packers dealing in fresh meats at St. 
Joseph: Morton Gregson & Company, of Nebraska City, Nebraska; Wolff Packing Company, of Topeka, Kansas; 
Thudium Company, of Leavenworth, Kansas; and Morrell & Company, of Ottumwa, Iowa. These packers sold at the 
same prices as respondents, including the Krug Packing Company. No effort was made to charge or prove a case 
against any of them, though manifestly, if there was a combination, they, in maintaining the same prices, were privy 
to it. (c) The beef packers in St. Louis are Armour Packing Company, Swift & Company, Nelson Morris & Company, 
Cudahy Packing Company, St. Louis Dressed Beef Company, Thomas Stringer, Missouri Packing Company, Union 
Stock Yards Company, Prendeville & Brother, Steitz & Company, John Ball and William Tamme, and the evidence 
is about as strong against some of these packers as it is against any of the respondents, including that objected to 
as hearsay. No prosecution was instituted against any of them. (d) At the St. Louis coolers the following are 
engaged in pork packing and were in the alleged combination as to fresh pork: Philip [***15]  Keim, Henry Sartorius, 
John H. Belz & Company, Louis Gruensfelder, Krey Packing Company, Wissmath & Sons, Charles Heil, D. W. 
Grant and Laux & Son. Of these Laux & Son, Krey Packing Company, Wissmath & Sons, Charles P. Heil and Louis 
Gruensfelder openly concede that they were in combination held to be unlawful. No effort is made to prosecute 
them, though confessedly guilty, and even if it be claimed that they turned State's evidence, and therefore are freed 
from punishment, it is enough not to punish any of these concerns, and the State ought not to reward them by 
ousting respondents so as to permit them to do all the business without competition. As to the Krug Packing 
Company, the report states that no effort was made to press the case against it. (e) At St. Joseph the butchers say 
that, although they got great concessions in prices, they never gave any benefit thereof to any customer. (f) These 
same butchers at St. Joseph, Missouri, were in a union or voluntary organization for the purpose of fixing and 
maintaining prices to the consumers of meat as harmful to the public as anything claimed against respondents.

298,Counsel,"Counsel: Stanley, Spoonts & Thompson, for appellant, Ft. Worth & Denver City [***3]  Railway. -- Independent of 
the Act of 1903 of the Texas Legislature, commonly known as the antitrust statute, the contract between the 
defendant railway company and the Pullman Company was a valid and binding contract, not against public policy, 
and not at all in restraint of trade or commerce.  The Express Cases, 117 U.S., 1; The Pullman Cases, 139 U.S., 
89; Donovan v. Railway Co., 120 Fed. Rep., 215; Cole v. Rowen, 13 Law. Rep. Ann., 848; Atlantic Exp. Co. v. 
Railway Co., 18 Law. Rep. Ann., 393; Barney v. Steamship Co., 67 N. Y. 301; Fluker v. Railway Co., 2 Law. Rep. 
Ann., 843; Kates v. Baggage Co., 16 Am. & Eng. R. R. Cases (N. S.), 140; Lewis v. Railway Co., 81 S. W. Rep., 
111. 
The contract between the Pullman Company and the railway company is not in conflict with the Act of 1903, and the 
making or carrying out of said contract would not violate any of the provisions of said law. 
The agreement between the Pullman Company and the railway company does not create a trust, a monopoly nor a 
conspiracy in restraint of trade as prohibited by the Act of 1903. 
In order for a trust to be created under the Act of 1903 there must be a combination of capital, skill or acts, 
and [***4]  the contract between the defendant companies does not create a combination.  A combination is a 
union, -- a joining of two or more factors into one result; a blending by which the original separate identity is merged 
into a result in which each of the original factors or parties have a common and not a separate interest.  A contract 
may create a combination if it brings about a union of interest, but if it does not, and if each party is contracting at 
arm's length and seeking to secure the best results, and if after the contract is made the interest of each party in the 
performance of the contract is separate, no combination will be created and no trust formed. 
A monopoly under the Act of 1903 is a combination or consolidation of two or more corporations so as to bring them 
under the same control and create a trust as defined in said Act, or when one corporation acquires control of the 
stock of another so as to lessen or destroy competition. 
A conspiracy in restraint of trade, under said Act of 1903, results when parties engaged in buying and selling agree 
to refuse to buy or sell to some other person, or when they boycott some other person. 
Before any contract will create a [***5]  trust, it must be mutual and obligate each party thereto to grant to the other 
party rights that are exclusive.  If the Pullman Company had obligated itself not to furnish cars to any other railway 
company and the railway company had bound itself to lease cars from no other company than the Pullman 
99 Tex. 34, *34; 87 S.W. 336, **336; 1905 Tex. LEXIS 155, ***1

 
Company, the contract might be injurious to the public and unreasonable; but, in the absence of such mutual 
covenants, the obligation is unilateral and fails to create any combination. 
It is not contended that the railway company can not lawfully lease cars from the Pullman Company.  If, by reason 
of the Act of 1903, the exclusive feature of the contract became unlawful, the contract will be treated as divisible, 
and those provisions thereof which are not in conflict with the law will be binding, and those in conflict will be held to 
have been annulled.  Queen Ins. Co. v. State, 86 Texas, 250; Gates v. Hooper, 90 Texas, 563; State v. Shipper's 
Compress Co., 95 Texas, 613; 25 Am. & Eng. Enc. Law (2d ed.), 1110; Lemon v. Pullman, 52 Fed. Rep., 262. 
Andrews, Ball & Streetmann and J. D. Guinn, for appellant, Pullman Company. -- The contract in question was not 
a violation of the [***6]  antitrust law of 1903, because the Pullman Co. was not a competitor of the R. R. Co. and 
the R. R. Co. giving it the exclusive privilege to furnish cars over its line and connect with its train, it merely 
operated a part of its own business through the instrumentality which the R. R. Co. had the right to select.  Welch v. 
Windmill Co., 89 Texas, 655; Gates v. Hooper, 90 Texas, 565; Lewis v. Railway Co., 81 S. W. Rep., 111; Express 
Co. Cases, 117 U.S., 1; Wiggins Ferry Co. v. Railway Co., 27 S. W. Rep., 570; Donovan v. Railway Co., 120 Fed. 
Rep., 215; Barney v. Steamship Co., 67 N. Y., 301; Kates v. Baggage Co., 16 Am. & Eng. Ry. Cases (N. S.), 140;

Texas, 603. 
The contract in question is not a ""combination"" as defined in the acts of 1903 and the petition therefore fails to state 
the violation of the terms of that statute. 
C. K. Bell, Attorney-General, Jno. W. Brady, County Attorney, D. A. McFall and Allen & Hart, for appellee. -- 
The [***7]  allegations of plaintiff's second amended petition were sufficient to bring the case within the scope of the 
Act of 1903, and the proof was ample to sustain the judgment rendered by the court under said act.  Plaintiff's 
cause of action was complete upon such pleading and proof and it was not incumbent upon plaintiff to show 
specifically that the exclusive provisions of the contract complained of had been enforced by showing that there 
were other competing sleeping car companies, or that other sleeping car companies applied to the railroad 
company to be allowed to furnish sleeping cars to it, nor is it any excuse to say that the contract did not bind the 
Pullman Company not to lease sleeping cars to other railroads.  Bill of Rights, State of Texas, sec. 26; City of

Acts in question were intended to prohibit combination generally, which restrain trade, or suppress competition, but 
not those contracts within the purview of the Railroad Commission law.  The Commission under that law has 
exclusive power and is charged with the exclusive duty to protect the public against unjust or excessive rates on the 
part of railway and express companies, and hence the contract in question is not within the meaning of the antitrust 
laws.  Thorpe v. Adams, L. R., 6 C. P., 135; Moore v. Bell, 95 Texas, 157; Rev. Stat., arts. 4561-4584; San Diego 
Water Co. v. San Diego Flume Co., 108 Cal., 549; State v. Shippers Compress Co., 95 Texas, 603. 
The contract in question was entered into before the Antitrust Act of 1903 and plaintiff's petition does not allege that 
the exclusive feature of the contract was carried out in such a way after that Act became effective, as to violate the 
terms of the Act.  We submit that the allegations are insufficient to show a violation of the law, if it applied to the 
contract in question.  See also United States v. Dietrich, 126 [***6]  Fed. Rep., 671; Oregon Co. v. Windsor, 20 
Wal., 64; Erie Ry. Co. v. Union L. Co., 6 Vroom, 244; Stephen v. Southern P. Co., 109 Cal., 95; 9 Cyc., 575-6;

Co., 95 Texas, 607; 6 A. & E. Enc. of Law, 2d ed., 840, and note, and 864 and note. 
The contract in question was not a violation of either the Antitrust Acts of 1899 or of 1903, because the express 
company was not a competitor of the railway company, and the railway company in giving the express company the 
exclusive privilege of transporting express matter over its lines merely operated a part of its own business through 
an instrumentality which it had the right to select.  Northern Securities Case, 193 U.S., 197; Welch v. Phelps & B.

a violation of the terms of that Act.

In Addyston Pipe Co. case, 85 Fed. Rep., 271, the rule is stated to be ""where the main and controlling purpose of 
the contract is a lawful purpose and the restriction of competition is merely collateral or incidental to the main 
purpose, such incidental and contingent restraint of trade is not within the purpose of the statute."" 
In United States v. E. C. Knight, 156 U.S., 1, it was decided that ""the fact that trade or commerce might be indirectly 
affected, was not enough to entitle complainant to a decree."" To same effect is United States v. Traffic Association, 
171 U.S., 505. 
In the express cases, 117 U.S., page 1, and the Pullman Palace car cases, 139 U.S., 89, the Federal Supreme 
Court holds that the contract between the railroad company and an express company or a sleeping car company, 
whereby the latter acquire exclusive [***8]  rights on the lines of railroads is not monopolistic in its character nor 
opposed to public policy.  These utterances by the highest federal court fully establish the proposition that the 
contract in question looked at from the most extreme standpoint, was only a partial restriction in competition, and 
was not unreasonable at common law or contrary to public policy.  If it was not so at common law then it was not 
so, if our argument holds good, under the language of the Antitrust Act of 1903.  United States v. Freight 
Association, 166 U.S., 341; Hopkins v. United States, 171 U.S., 578; United States v. Workman's A. Council, 26 L. 
R. A., 158; Addyston P. & S. Co. v. United States, 175 U.S., 211, and 95 Texas, 603; Addyston Pipe Co. case, 85 
Fed. Rep., 271; 175 U.S., 211. 
We think the case is distinguishable from the cases heretofore held to violate the antitrust law, and within the 
doctrine announced in Gates v. Hooper, 90 Texas, 563. Vanderweghe v. American Brewing Co., 61 S. W. Rep., 
526. See also White Dental Co. v. Hertzberg, 51 S. W. Rep., 355. 
The contract in question is not an unreasonable restriction in trade or upon competition and is not illegal because 
the Antitrust [***9]  Act of 1903 applies only to unreasonable restraints in trade and substantial restrictions in 
competition. 
If the Antitrust Act of 1903 prohibits reasonable restrictions in trade and competition in the manufacture, making, 
transportation, sale or purchase of merchandise, produce or commodities, then it is void because it deprives the 
prohibited persons from exercising the constitutional right of making contracts.  Dobbins v. City of Los Angeles, 195 
U.S. Rep., 223; Lawton v. Steele, 152 U.S., 133; Express cases, 117 U.S., 1; Pullman cases, 139 U.S., 89. 
If the Act of 1903 prohibits reasonable restrictions upon trade and competition, then the statute takes away the 
appellees' liberty and property without due process of law, and it is an impairment of rights protected by the 
fourteenth amendment to the Federal Constitution. 
The contract in question appears from the plaintiff's petition to have been entered into before the passage of the 
Antitrust Act of 1903, and that Act is an ex post facto law and a law impairing the obligations of the contract within 
the meaning of the United States Constitution as regards their contract.  Express cases, 117 U.S., 1; Pullman 
cases, 139 U.S.,  [***10]  89. 
The Antitrust Act of 1903, the violation of which is complained of, is contrary to the fourteenth amendment to the 
Federal Constitution and denies the appellees the equal protection of the law, because in the 17th section of the 
Act, it provides that nothing in the act shall be construed to destroy any rights of the state to recover penalties or 
forfeit charters of domestic corporations, or prohibit foreign corporations from doing business in the state for acts 
committed before the Act takes effect, but does not provide for the recovery of penalties either against an individual 
or a foreign corporation for acts committed before the Act takes effect.  Connolly v. Union Pipe Line Co., 184 U.S.,

The anti-trust Act of May 25, 1899, was repealed by the anti-trust Act of March 31, 1903. Section 35, article 3,

Anti-trust law of March 31, 1903, General Laws of Texas, Twenty-eighth Legislature, p. 119; Constitution of the 
United States, and section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment thereto.
No right was reserved to the State by said Act of March 31, 1903, to recover penalties against foreign corporations 
for violations of said Act of May 25, 1899, or any other law upon said subject. Act May 25, 1899, supra; Act March 
31, 1903, supra; Collins v. Warren, 63 Texas, 315; Roberts v. Yarboro, 41 Texas, 452; 26 Am. & Eng. Enc. of Law, 
p. 680; United States v. Dickson, 15 Peters, 165.
This suit, though civil in form, is a prosecution against the defendant to recover penalties for an offense, the 
plaintiff's cause of action is criminal in [***2]  its character, and the bar of limitation of two years prescribed by article 
219 of the Code of Criminal Procedure precludes a recovery by the plaintiff of any penalties against the defendant 
under such anti-trust Act of May 25, 1899. Article 219, Code Criminal Procedure; Missouri, K. & T. Ry. Co. v. State, 
100 Texas, 420; Queen Insurance Co. v. State, 86 Texas, 250; Stooksbury v. Swan, 85 Texas, 563; Clepper v.

Ex parte Lange, 18 Wallace, 163; Bristol v. Washington County, 177 U.S., 147.
It appears from the face of the plaintiff's petition that the plaintiff's cause of action, if any it ever had, to recover 
penalties under the anti-trust Act of May 25, 1899, accrued more than two years before the institution of this suit 
and therefore if the plaintiff's cause of action is not to be regarded as criminal in its nature, and not governed by 
article 219 [***3]  of the Code of Criminal Procedure, such cause of action must be treated as civil in its character, 
and having accrued more than two years before the institution of this suit, it is barred by the statute of limitation of 
two years, as prescribed in article 3354 of the Revised Civil Statutes of Texas. Revised Civil Statutes, art. 3354; 
Buswell on Limitation, sec. 97; Stockwell v. United States, 13 Wallace, 531; Davidson v. Missouri Pacific Ry. Co., 3 
Willson's Cases, p. 216; Rockwell v. Ohio, 11 Ohio, 130; State v. Moore, 19 Tenn. (Meigs), 476.
Plaintiff's cause of action, if not regarded as criminal in its nature, is civil in its character, so much thereof as 
accrued prior to the 22d day of September, 1902, is barred by the statute of limitation of four years as prescribed in 
article 3358 of the Revised Civil Statutes of Texas. Revised Civil Statutes, art. 3358; Boswell v. Robinson, 33 N. J. 
Law, 273, and also same as above.
Any violator of said Act is guilty of a felony, and as to such violator the period of limitation for the commission of the 
felony is three years as prescribed by article 218 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the State of Texas, and 
therefore a person [***4]  prosecuted by an action, civil in form, for the recovery of the penalty of $ 50 per day for 
violating said Act is, if no other period of limitation is available to him, entitled to the protection of the statute of 
limitation of three years prescribed by said article 218 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by analogy. Pomeroy's

Section 2 of the anti-trust Act of May 25, 1899, does not sufficiently designate an offense against the laws within the 
requirement of article 3 of the general provisions of the Penal Code of the State of Texas, which declares that no 
person shall be punished for any act or omission unless the same is made a penal offense and a penalty is affixed 
thereto by the written law of this State; nor within the requirement of article 6 of the general provisions of the Penal 
Code of the State of Texas, which prescribes that whenever it appears that a provision of the penal law was 
indefinitely framed or of such doubtful construction that it can not be understood, either from the language in which 
it is expressed or from some other written law of the State, such penal law shall be regarded as wholly inoperative; 
 [***5]  nor within the requirement of article 9 of the general provisions of the Penal Code of the State of Texas, 
which prescribes that no person shall be punished for an offense not made penal by the plain import of the words of 
the law.
Section 6 of the anti-trust Act of May 25, 1899, does not sufficiently define an offense within the requirement of 
article 3 of the general provisions of the Penal Code of the State of Texas, which declares that no person shall be

written law of this State; nor does it sufficiently define an offense within the requirement of article 6 of the general 
provisions of the Penal Code of the State of Texas; nor does it sufficiently define an offense within the requirement 
of article 9 of the general provisions of the Penal Code of the State of Texas. Queen Ins. Co. v. State, 86 Texas,

of law, for each of the days between May 31, 1900, and March 31, 1903, was so grossly and shockingly excessive 
as to show passion and prejudice on the part of the jury against the defendant. Constitution of Texas, art. 1, sec.

As applied to the facts in this case, a ""trust"" is a combination of capital, skill or acts by two or more persons, to 
create or carry out restriction in trade; to prevent or lessen competition in the sale or purchase of merchandise, 
produce or commodities, and any contract or agreement creating such combination is absolutely void, and not 
enforcible in law or equity. Ch. 94, sec. 1, p. 119, Acts of the Twenty-eighth Legislature, 1903; Texas & Pac. Coal

The acquisition in 1899 by the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey of the stocks of the other companies was not a 
combination of independent enterprises.  [****8]  All of the companies had the same stockholders who in the 
various corporate organizations were carrying on parts of the one business.  The business as a whole belonged to 
this body of common stockholders who, commencing prior to 1870, had as its common owners gradually built it up 
and developed it.  The properties used in the business, in so far as they had been acquired by purchase, were 
purchased from time to time with the common funds for account of the common owners.  For the most part the 
plants and properties used in the business in 1899 had not been acquired by purchase but were the creation of the 
common owners.  The majority of the companies, and the most important ones, had been created by the common 
owners for the convenient conduct of branches of the business.  The stocks of these companies had always been 
held in common ownership.  The business of the companies and their relations to each other were unchanged by 
the transfer of the stocks of the other companies to the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey. 
The Sherman Act has no application to the transfer to, or acquisition by, the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey 
of the stocks of the various manufacturing and producing [****9]  corporations, for the reason that such transfer and 
acquisition were not acts of interstate or foreign commerce, nor direct and immediate in their effect on interstate and 
221 U.S. 1, *1; 31 S. Ct. 502, **502; 55 L. Ed. 619, ***619; 1911 U.S. LEXIS 1725, ****5

 
foreign commerce, nor within the power of Congress to regulate interstate and foreign commerce.  United States v. 
Knight, 156 U.S. 1; In re Greene, 52 Fed. Rep. 104. 
The contracts, combinations and conspiracies of § 1 of the Sherman Act are contracts and combinations which 
contractually restrict the freedom of one or more of the parties to them in the conduct of his or their trade, and 
combinations or conspiracies which restrict the freedom of others than the parties to them in the conduct of their 
business, when these restrictions directly affect interstate or foreign trade.  Purchases or acquisitions of property 
are not in any sense such contracts, combinations or conspiracies.  Contracts in restraint of trade are contracts with 
a stranger to the contractor's business, although in some cases carrying on a similar one, which wholly or partially 
restricts the freedom of the contractor in carrying on that business as otherwise he would.  Holmes, J., in Northern 
Securities Case, 193 U.S. 404; Pollock on Contracts,  [****10]  7th ed., p. 352.  Such contracts are invalid because 
of the injury to the public in being deprived of the restricted party's industry and the injury to the party himself by 
being precluded from pursuing his occupation.  Oregon Steam Navigation Co. v. Windsor, 20 Wall. 68; Alger v. 
Thacker, 19 Pick. 54. Combinations in restraint of trade are combinations between two or more persons whereby 
each party is restricted in his freedom in carrying on his business in his own way.  Hilton v. Eckersley, 6 El. & Bl. 47. 
The cases in which combinations have been held invalid at common law as being in restraint of trade deal with 
executory agreements between independent manufacturers and dealers whereby the freedom of each to conduct 
his business with respect to his own interest and judgment is restricted.  Morris Run Coal Co. v. Barclay Coal Co., 
68 Pa. St. 173; Salt Co. v. Guthrie, 35 Oh. St. 666; Arnot v. Pittston and Elmira Coal Co., 68 N.Y. 558; Craft v. 
McConoughy, 79 Illinois, 346; India Bagging Association v. Kock, 14 La. Ann. 168; Vulcan Powder Co. v. Hercules 
Powder Co., 96 California, 510; Oil Co. v. Adoue, 83 Texas, 650; Chapin v. Brown, 83 Iowa, 156. 
The cases in which trusts and [****11]  similar combinations have been held invalid as combinations in restraint of 
trade all deal with devices employed to secure the centralized control of separately owned concerns.  People v. 
North River Sugar Refining Co., 54 Hun, 354; S.C., 121 N.Y. 582; State v. Nebraska Distilling Co., 29 Nebraska, 
700; Pocahontas Coke Co. v. Powhatan Coal & Coke Co., 60 W. Va. 508. 
A conspiracy in restraint of trade is a combination of two or more to deprive others than its members of their 
freedom in conducting their business in their own way by acts having that effect.  A combination to boycott is a 
sufficient illustration. 
The Sherman Act did not enlarge the category of contracts, combinations and conspiracies in restraint of trade.  
United States v. Trans-Missouri Association, 166 U.S. 290; United States v. Joint Traffic Association, 171 U.S. 505; 
Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. v. United States, 175 U.S. 211; Montague v. Lowry, 193 U.S. 38; Swift v. United States, 
196 U.S. 375; Loewe v. Lawlor, 208 U.S. 274; Continental Wall Paper Co. v. Voight & Sons, 212 U.S. 227, all 
involved combinations, either expressly by the terms of the agreements constituting them, restricting the freedom of 
each of the [****12]  members in the conduct of his or its business, or in the nature of conspiracies to restrict the 
freedom of others than their members in the conduct of their business.  The Northern Securities Case, 193 U.S. 
197, was a combination which, through the device adopted, restricted the freedom of the stockholders of two 
independent railroad companies in the separate and independent control and management of their respective 
companies. 
Purchases and acquisitions of property do not restrain trade.  The freedom of a trader is not restricted by the sale of 
his property and business.  The elimination of competition, so far as his property and business is concerned, is not 
a restraint of trade, but is merely an incidental effect of the exercise of the fundamental civil right to buy and sell 
property freely.  The acquisition of property is not made illegal by the fact that the purchaser intends thereby to put 
an end to the use of such property in competition with him.  Every purchase of property necessarily involves the 
elimination of that property from use in competition with the purchaser and, therefore, implies an intent to effect 
such elimination.  Cincinnati Packet Co. v. Bay, 200 U.S. 179. 
 [****13]  The transfer to, and acquisition by, the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey of the stocks of the various 
corporations in the year 1899 was not, and the continued ownership of those shares with the control which it 
221 U.S. 1, *1; 31 S. Ct. 502, **502; 55 L. Ed. 619, ***619; 1911 U.S. LEXIS 1725, ****9

 
confers is not, a combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade declared to be illegal by the first section of the 
Sherman Act.  Because of the common ownership of the different properties in interest they were not independent 
or competitive but they were the constituent elements of a single business organism.  This situation was not 
affected by the transfer to the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, who had the same body of stockholders and 
had controlled the separate companies and continued to control them through the Standard Oil Company of New 
Jersey.  These considerations differentiate the present case from the Northern Securities Case, 193 U.S. 197. The 
Northern Securities Case dealt with a combination of diverse owners of separate and diverse properties which were 
bound by the law of their being as quasi-public corporations invested with public franchises to continue separate, 
independent and competitive, creating through the instrumentality of the holding company [****14]  a common 
control which would necessarily prevent competitive relations. 
There is no warrant for the assumption that corporations engaged in the same business are naturally or potentially 
competitive regardless of their origin or ownership.  If the same body of men create several corporations to carry on 
a large business for the economical advantages of location or for any other reason, and the stocks of these 
corporations are all in common ownership, it is a fiction to say that they are potentially competitive or that their 
natural relation is one of competition. 
The common owners of the Standard Oil properties and business had the right to vest the properties and business 
in a single corporation, notwithstanding that such a transaction might tend to prevent the disintegration of the 
different properties into diverse ownerships.  The Sherman Act does not impose restrictions upon the rights of joint 
owners. 
The acquisitions prior to 1882 were lawful and their effect upon competition was incidental.  The purpose of the trust 
of 1879 was to bring the scattered legal titles to the joint properties then vested in various individuals into a single 
trusteeship.  The purpose of the Trust [****15]  Agreement of 1882 was to provide a practicable trusteeship to hold 
the legal title to the joint properties, an effective executive management and a marketable symbol or evidence of the 
interest of each owner.  The only question raised in the case of State v. Standard Oil Company, 49 Oh. St. 137, was 
whether it was Ultra vires for the Standard Oil Company of Ohio to permit its stock to be held by the trustees 
instead of by the real owners.  The method of distribution adopted on the dissolution of the trust was the only 
feasible plan of distribution.  Each certificate-holder was given an assignment of his proportionate interest in all the 
companies.  All being parts of the common business there was no basis for separate valuations.  The value of the 
interest of every owner was dependent upon its being kept together as an entirety.  The transaction of 1899 was 
practically an incorporation of the entire business by the common owners through the ownership of the Standard Oil 
Company of New Jersey.  That was the plain purpose, object and effect of the transaction. 
The first section of the Sherman Act deals directly with contracts, combinations and conspiracies in restraint of 
trade.  The [****16]  second section deals directly with monopolizing and attempts to monopolize.  Monopolizing 
does not enlarge the operation of the first section nor does its absence restrict the operation of that section. 
The first section deals with entities, a contract, combination, a conspiracy; and the entities themselves are expressly 
declared to be illegal, and may be annulled or destroyed.  The second section deals with acts. 
At common law monopoly had a precise definition.  Blackstone, Vol. 4, p. 160; Butchers' Union Co. v. Crescent City 
Co., 111 U.S. 756. Monopoly imports the idea of exclusiveness and an exclusiveness existing by reason of the 
restraint of the liberty of others.  With the commonlaw monopoly the restraint resulted from the grant of the 
exclusive right or privilege.  Under the Sherman Act there must be some substitute for the grant as a source of the 
exclusiveness and restraint essential to monopolizing.  The essential element is found in the statement of Judge 
Jackson ( In re Greene, 52 Fed. Rep. 116) that monopolizing is securing or acquiring ""the exclusive right in such 
trade or commerce by means which prevent or restrain others from engaging therein."" Exclusion by 
competition [****17]  is not monopolizing.  Pollock on Torts, 8th ed., p. 152; Mogul Case, L.R. 23 Q.B.D. 615; (1892) 
App. Cas. 51. Monopolizing within the act is the appropriation of a trade by means of contracts, combinations or 
conspiracies in restraint of trade or other unlawful or tortious acts, whereby ""the subject in general is restrained from 
that liberty of . . . trading which he had before."" In the absence of such means or agencies of exclusion, size, 
aggregated capital, power, and volume of business are not monopolizing in a legal sense. 
221 U.S. 1, *1; 31 S. Ct. 502, **502; 55 L. Ed. 619, ***619; 1911 U.S. LEXIS 1725, ****13

 
 Swift v. United States, 196 U.S. 375, was the case of a combination of corporations, firms and individuals 
separately and independently engaged in the business, together controlling nearly the whole of it, to monopolize it 
by certain acts and course of conduct effective to that end when done and pursued by such a combination. 
 Richardson v. Buhl, 77 Michigan, 632; People v. North River Sugar Refining Co., 54 Hun, 354; State v. Standard 
Oil Co., 49 Oh St. 137; State v. Distillery Co., 29 Nebraska, 700; Distilling Co. v. People, 156 Illinois, 448, and 
Anderson v. Shawnee Compress Co., 209 U.S. 423, rest upon special grounds and are not applicable to this case. 
 [****18]  See on the other hand, In re Greene, 52 Fed. Rep. 104, Jackson, J.; Trenton Potteries Co. v. Oliphant, 58 
N.J. Eq. 507; Oakdale Co. v. Garst, 18 R.I. 484; State v. Continental Tobacco Co., 177 Missouri, 1; Diamond Match 
Co. v. Roeber, 106 N.Y. 473; Davis v. Booth & Co., 131 Fed. Rep. 31; Robinson v. Brick Co., 127 Fed. Rep. 804. 
The acquisition of existing plants or properties however extensive, though made to obtain their trade and eliminate 
their competition, is not a monopoly at common law or monopolizing under the Sherman Act, in the absence of the 
exclusion of others from the trade by conspiracies to that end or contracts in restraint of trade on an elaborate and 
effective scale, or other systematic, wrongful, tortious or illegal acts.  When such monopolizing is present the 
remedy of the act is to prohibit the offending conspiracies, contracts, and illegal acts or means of exclusion, leaving 
the individual or corporation to pursue his or its business with the properties and plants that have been acquired or 
created shorn of the monopolizing elements in the conduct of the business. 
The acquisition of competing plants and properties cannot be rendered unlawful by imputing to [****19]  such 
acquisitions an intent to monopolize.  The acquisition of plants and properties does not exclude anyone from the 
trade and therefore the intent to monopolize cannot be attributed to such acquisitions.  The proposition that an 
acquisition of property is rendered invalid because of a collateral intent to monopolize is not sustained by the 
authorities relied upon to support it.  Addyston Pipe Case, 85 Fed. Rep. 291, and cases there cited.  The substantial 
acquisitions made by the owners of the Standard Oil business antedated the Sherman Act and they resulted from 
separate transactions extending over a long period of years.  They were in all cases accretions to an existing 
business.  They formed an insignificant part of the business as it now exists.  The Sherman Act is intended to 
prevent present monopolizing or attempts to monopolize.  Whether acquisitions made many years ago were or 
were not associated with an attempt to monopolize has no relation with the present attempt at monopolizing. 
The Standard Oil Company of New Jersey was not monopolizing, or attempting to monopolize, or combining with 
anyone else to monopolize, interstate and foreign trade in petroleum and its products [****20]  when this proceeding 
was instituted, or at any time. 
The ownership of the pipe lines has not been a means of monopolizing.  Substantially all of the pipe lines owned by 
the Standard Oil companies have been constructed by those companies.  There has never been any exclusion of 
anyone from the oil fields either in the production of oil, or its purchase, or its storage, or its gathering or 
transportation by pipe lines.  Ownership of the pipe lines does not give the Standard companies any advantages in 
dealing with the producers which are not open to others. 
The decree erroneously includes and operates upon several of the appellant companies. 
The sixth section of the decree is unwarranted and impracticable in various of its provisions. 
It was error to deny the motion of the appellants to vacate the order permitting service upon them outside of the 
Eastern Division of the Eastern District of Missouri, and to set aside the service upon them of the writs of subpoena 
issued thereunder; and error to overrule the pleas of the appellants to the jurisdiction of the court over them.  The 
appellants were not residents of the Eastern District of Missouri nor were they found therein when the [****21]  
order was made authorizing the service of process upon them outside of the district.  There was no proceeding 
pending in that district involving a controversy for the determination of which the appellants were necessary parties. 
Mr. D. T. Watson, also for appellants: 
The Government has failed to maintain the affirmative of the issue made by the pleadings.  Brent v. The Bank, 10 
Pet. 614; The Siren, 7 Wall. 154; United States v. Stinson, 197 U.S. 200, 205. 
221 U.S. 1, *1; 31 S. Ct. 502, **502; 55 L. Ed. 619, ***619; 1911 U.S. LEXIS 1725, ****17

 
The transfer in 1899 to the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey of the various non-competitive properties jointly 
used by them as one property was not a restriction of interstate trade, or an attempt to monopolize, or a violation of 
the Sherman Act. 
The Sherman Act permits trusts, combines, corporations and individuals to enter into and compete for interstate 
trade so long as they act lawfully.  It does not seek to regulate the methods nor forbid those who enter into trade 
from doing their business in the form of a trust, corporation or combine, provided they carry it on lawfully. 
The Standard Oil Company of New Jersey after 1899 might legitimately and properly compete for interstate trade, 
notwithstanding the combination [****22]  of the group of properties gave it a great power, only provided it did not 
restrain such trade or by unlawful means seek to gain a monopoly contrary to the provisions of the Sherman Act. 
There is nothing in this case to show that after 1899 the combination did unlawfully compete, restrict or seek to 
monopolize interstate trade; yet such evidence was indispensable to prove that the combination was violating the 
Sherman Act in 1906.See the Calumet & Hecla Case, Judge Kanappen, 167 Fed. Rep. 709, 715; Judge Lurton, 
167 Fed. Rep. 727, 728; Judge Gray in United States v. Reading Co., decided December 8, 1910. 
There is a great difference between the Northern Securities Case and the case at bar. 
On the question of potential competition, the idea of competition between properties all owned by the same persons 
is a novelty.  The idea that properties themselves compete, and that if one man owns two or more he must compete 
with himself, is startling.  Competition between joint owners is also novel.  Fairbanks v. Leary, 40 Wisconsin, 642, 
643; Whitwell v. Continental Tobacco Co., 125 Fed. Rep. 454. 
Competition is the striving of two or more persons, or corporations, either individually [****23]  or jointly, for one 
thing, i.e., trade; it is personal action; the strife between different persons.  Properties do not compete.  Their 
relative locations may more readily enable their owners to use them in competition, but of themselves and as 
against each other, they do not compete. 
This idea makes the Sherman Act read that the same person or group of individuals shall not own and operate two 
or more sites for refineries or for stores or for any kind of manufactories which might be used by different owners in 
competition.  Joint Traffic Association Case, 171 U.S. 505, 567. 
The words ""potential"" or ""naturally competitive"" are not in the Sherman Act.  Cascade Railroad Co. v. Superior 
Court, 51 Washington, 346. The rule of potential competition refers only to the ownership of the physical properties 
which produce the oil which goes into interstate commerce, and not to the oil itself.  United States v. E.C. Knight 
Co., 156 U.S. 1; Northern Securities Co. v. United States, 193 U.S. 407. 
The Sherman Act is a highly penal one.  In a criminal prosecution under the act the degree of proof is beyond a 
reasonable doubt.  In a civil suit under it, the degree is not so great, but the proof [****24]  must be direct, plain and 
convincing.  United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Assn., 58 Fed. Rep. 77; Northern Securities Co. v. United 
States, 193 U.S. 197, 401; State v. Continental Tobacco Co., 177 Mississippi, 1. 
There is a distinction between private traders and railroad companies; and see also distinction under Sherman Act 
between quasi-public corporations and private traders.  Trans-Missouri Case, 166 U.S. 290. 
The mere method in which stocks are held is not prescribed by the Sherman Act; all methods are lawful if not used 
to restrict trade or gain an unlawful monopoly.  Under the court's ruling the effectiveness of a large business 
organization may, by reason of that very fact, bring it under the Sherman Act. 
The decree below was not justified by the facts found by the court; or by the Sherman Act; after the court in § 5 
permitted the distribution among the shareholders of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey of the stocks held by 
that company, it did without lawful authority so to do, define and limit the method of that distribution; restrict the 
distributees in the future sale, use and disposal of their stocks; restrict the distributees in the sale, use and 
disposal [****25]  of their properties; and in the contract relations thereafter to exist, as well as the use and 
disposition of the different properties in such a drastic manner as to greatly injure and destroy the value of the same 
221 U.S. 1, *1; 31 S. Ct. 502, **502; 55 L. Ed. 619, ***619; 1911 U.S. LEXIS 1725, ****21

 
and render their future profitable use practically impossible.  The decree disintegrates properties built with 
appellants' moneys for joint use so as to create units that never before existed and compels these units separately 
to carry on business and compete with other units, directly contrary to the purpose of their creation.  It allows the 
future operation and use of the refineries, pipe lines, and other properties of the appellants only under the vague 
and indefinite, but broad and comprehensive, terms of § 6 of the decree, by subjecting those who in the future 
operate them to attachment for contempt for unwittingly violating vague and indefinite terms.  It prohibits appellants 
from engaging in all interstate commerce until the discontinuance of the operation of the illegal combination, thus 
inflicting a new penalty for an indefinite and uncertain period. 
All of such restrictions are unauthorized by the Sherman Act, are in violation of the settled rules governing [****26]  
injunctions, and are contrary to the provisions of the different decrees heretofore approved by this court under the 
Sherman Act, and especially the one in the Northern Securities Case. 
The decree authorized by the Sherman Act is wholly negative, and one that merely enjoins -- stops an illegal thing 
in operation when the petition is filed or which then is foreseen.  Lacassagne v. Chapius, 144 U.S. 124; E.C. Knight 
Co. Case, 156 U.S. 1, 17; Harriman v. Northern Securities Co., 197 U.S. 244, 289; Swift & Co. v. United States, 196 
U.S. 375, 402; United States v. Reading Co., decided by Circuit Court of the Third Circuit, December 8, 1910. 
The Sherman Act prescribes certain specific methods of relief which are exclusive of all others.  Noyes on 
Intercorporate Relations, 2d ed., 1909, § 406; Greer, Mills & Co. v. Stoller, 77 Fed. Rep. 1, 3; Minnesota v. Northern 
Securities Co., 194 U.S. 48, 71; Barnet v. National Bank, 98 U.S. 555, 558; East Tennessee R.R. Co. v. Southern 
Tel. Co., 112 U.S. 306, 310; Farmers' Bank v. Dearing, 91 U.S. 29, 35; United States v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., 
98 U.S. 569. 
The decree hampers and greatly injures the value of the stock of the stockholders,  [****27]  though they are not 
parties to the bill. 
A corporation, when party to a bill in equity, does represent its stockholders, but only within the scope of corporate 
power, and not as to the individual rights of the stockholder to do with his property as he chooses.  Taylor & Co. v. 
Southern Pacific Co., 122 Fed. Rep. 147, 153, 154. A corporation has no right to conclude or affect the right of any 
shareholder in respect of the ownership or incidents of his particular shares.  Brown v. Pacific Mail Steamship Co., 
Fed. Cas. No. 2025; 5 Blatch. 525; Morse v. Bay State Gas Co., 91 Fed. Rep. 944, 946; Harriman v. Northern 
Securities Co., 197 U.S. 244, 288-290. 
The decree follows the appellants and their properties after the dissolution. 
The Sherman Act closely limits and defines the power of the court on a petition filed to give equitable relief.  The 
petition must pray that such violations shall be enjoined or otherwise prohibited; and it is these violations of the act 
that the court may now enjoin, and only such violations.  Past unlawful competition does not deprive parties of their 
right to conduct lawful competition.  New Haven R.R. Case, 200 U.S. 361, 404. 
The Sherman Act does not [****28]  give power to the courts to strike down and disintegrate a non-competing group 
of physical properties used to manufacture an article of trade.  These physical properties are bought and held and 
used under state laws; they do not enter into interstate commerce and hence are not under Federal control.  New 
Haven R.R. Co. v. Interstate Com. Comm., 200 U.S. 361, 404; State v. Omaha Elevator Co., 75 Nebraska, 637. 
The effect of the decree is ruinous.  For instance, these companies jointly own 54,616 miles of pipe lines, of which 
the seven individual defendants and their associates built over 50,000 miles, in which they have an investment of 
over $61,000,000. 
The decree splits up this pipe line system into eleven parts, takes away from the owners, who jointly built the pipe 
lines and who created the sub-companies, all control over the different sub-companies, and compels the eleven 
different parts to stand alone, independently of their principal and of each other, to be hostile to and to compete with 
their principal and with one another. 
221 U.S. 1, *1; 31 S. Ct. 502, **502; 55 L. Ed. 619, ***619; 1911 U.S. LEXIS 1725, ****25

 
Pipe lines are never parallel but always continuous, and each line has a value which depends wholly upon its 
connection with other parts of the system,  [****29]  and whether all are used together as one whole.  The carrying 
out of the decree would cut the pipe line system into isolated segments, prevent such use, and make the successful 
operation of the pipe lines impossible. 
The decree would especially destroy the value of the stock of all shareholders who each had five shares or less.  
The stockholders on August 19, 1907, holding from one to four shares each numbered 1,157, and the stockholders 
owning five shares each numbered 439, out of a total number of 5,085 stockholders. 
Considering the case de novo, and not on the findings of the court below, it is not true that when the petition in this 
case was filed in 1906, the seven individual appellants and their associates, private traders in oil, were, contrary to 
the provisions of the Sherman Act, carrying on a conspiracy to restrain interstate and foreign trade in oils, and to 
gain by illegal means a monopoly thereof. 
The Federal law allowed and allows each of the individuals to compete freely for the interstate and foreign traffic in 
oil and its products.  He may use all the weapons that his ingenuity and skill can suggest, to wage a successful 
warfare.  His rights to compete are not [****30]  limited to merely such means as are fair or reasonable, but are only 
limited to such as are unlawful and directly tend to the violation of the Sherman Act.  The Federal law also allows 
and assures to each competitor whatever share, however large, of the interstate or foreign trade in oil he or they 
may win provided his means are not unlawful.  The Sherman Act was passed to protect trade and further 
competition.  It makes such restraint and monopoly a crime and inflicts, on conviction, severe penalties for such 
offense.  It permits one set of competitors to purchase the property of other competitors solely to avoid further 
competition.  The mere size of the competing corporations or combinations is immaterial. 
The monopoly of a trade at common law was forbidden because, and only because, it excluded all others from 
practicing such trade, and seems to have been then limited to a royal grant, as, for example, giving the exclusive 
right to manufacture playing cards.  It was and is a distinct thing from engrossing, regrating or forestalling the 
market, all of which were based on the prevention of artificial prices for the necessaries of life.  No one of these falls 
under Federal jurisdiction,  [****31]  but each is subject to state control only. 
The present litigation is between the Federal Government and certain of its citizens.The questions involved are 
solely the rights of these Federal citizens and the effect upon those rights of the Sherman Act, and whether these 
Federal citizens have violated the provisions of that act. 
There was and is no such thing as a Federal crime, aside from express congressional acts, and as no such act was 
in existence prior to 1890, as to the matters charged in the petition, all the matters and things done by the 
defendants prior thereto are immaterial. 
This case involves, and only involves, the question of the restraint and monopolization of interstate and foreign 
trade in oil in November, 1906, when the petition was filed; it does not involve any alleged restraint or monopoly of 
the oil industry in any of the States. 
The appellants were lawfully entitled to so hold and use in interstate trade all of its combined properties. 
To succeed in this case, the Government must also show that the said Standard Oil Company was then in 1906 
using its power to actually restrain interstate or foreign trade in oil, or was then in 1906 excluding or 
attempting [****32]  to exclude by illegal means others from said trade and attempting to monopolize the same, or a 
part thereof. 
The Sherman Act does not compel private traders, however organized, to compete with each other.  The character 
of the oil business was and is such that a great corporation was and is an economic necessity for carrying on that 
industry.  The growth and success of the Standard Oil Company was the result of individual enterprise and the 
natural laws of trade.  It was not the result of unlawful means, but of skill, unremitting toil, denials and hardships, 
and is an instance of where the continuous use for forty years of skill, labor and capital reached a great success. 
To prove a violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act the Government must clearly show that when the petition was filed 
appellants were then actually restraining interstate trade in oil.

To prove a monopoly under § 2 of the Sherman Act, the Government must show that the appellants were, when the 
petition was filed, then using unlawful means to maintain their control of the industry and that the appellants were 
then by unlawful means excluding others from said industry. 
The Attorney General and Mr. Frank B. Kellogg,  [****33]  with whom Mr. Cordenio N. Severance was on the brief, 
for the United States: 
It is immaterial that this conspiracy had its inception prior to the enactment of the Sherman Law, or that many of the 
rebates and discriminations granted by the railroads which enabled the defendants to monopolize the commerce in 
petroleum antedated the enactment of the Interstate Commerce Act; the principles of the common law applied to 
interstate as well as to intrastate commerce.  Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Call Pub. Co., 181 U.S. 92; Murray v. 
C. & N.W.R. Co., 62 Fed. Rep. 24; Interstate Com. Comm. v. B. & O.R. Co., 145 U.S. 263; Bank of Kentucky v. 
Adams Express Co., 93 U.S. 174; National Lead Co. v. Grote Paint Store Co., 80 Mo. App. 247; People v. Chicago

700; Distilling & Cattle Feeding Co. v. People, 156 Illinois, 448. 
From the earliest date these various corporations were held together by trust agreements which were void at 
common law.  But whether they were void or not, the combination was a continuing one; there was no vested right 
by reason of the acquisition of these stocks [****34]  by the trustees, and when the Sherman Act was passed the 
continuance of the combination became illegal.  United States v. Freight Association, 166 U.S. 290, cited and 
approved in Waters-Pierce Oil Co. v. Texas, 212 U.S. 86; Thompson v. Union Castle Steamship Co., 166 Fed. Rep. 
251; United States v. American Tobacco Co., 164 Fed. Rep. 700; Finck v. Schneider Granite Co., 86 S.W. Rep. 
221; Ford v. Chicago Milk Assn., 155 Illinois, 166. 
The Standard Oil Company, through various defendant subsidiary corporations is engaged in producing and 
purchasing crude petroleum in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Oklahoma, Kansas and 
California; in transporting the same by pipe lines from the States in which the same is produced into the various 
other States to the manufactories of the various defendants; in manufacturing the same into the products of 
petroleum and transporting those products, largely in the tank cars of the Union Tank Line Company (controlled by 
the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey) to the various marketing places throughout the United States, and in 
selling and disposing of the same.  This clearly makes the defendants engaged in interstate commerce.

The amalgamation of the stocks of all these companies in 1899 in the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey as a 
holding corporation was a combination in restraint of trade within § 1 of the Sherman Act.  United States v. Northern 
Securities Co., 193 U.S. 197; Harriman v. Northern Securities Co., 197 U.S. 244; Shawnee Compress Co. v.

Co., 79 Kansas, 371; International Harvester Co. v. Commonwealth, 124 Kentucky, 543; State v. Creamery 
Package Mfg. Co., 126 N.W. Rep. 126. 
The Northern Securities Case and other authorities [****36]  cited under this head are conclusive of the proposition 
that this is a combination in restraint of trade.  The court held that the inhibitions of the Sherman Act were not 
limited to those direct restraints upon trade and commerce evidenced by contracts between independent lines of 
railway to fix rates or to maintain rates, or manufacturing or other corporations to limit the supply or control prices; 
that the power of suppression of competition and therefore of restraint of trade exercised or which could be 
exercised by reason of stock ownership and control of the various corporations, was as much in violation of the 
Anti-trust Act as direct restraint by contract.  There is nothing in the act which can be construed to prohibit the 
suppression of competition by reason of stock control of railways and at the same time to permit it in manufacturing 
221 U.S. 1, *1; 31 S. Ct. 502, **502; 55 L. Ed. 619, ***619; 1911 U.S. LEXIS 1725, ****32

 
industries, pipe line companies, or car line companies engaged in the manufacture and transportation of oil.  The 
contracts, combinations in the form of trusts or otherwise, or conspiracies in restraint of trade, which are inhibited by 
the first section of the act as applied to these classes of corporations cannot be distinguished from those [****37]  
contracts, combinations in the form of trusts or otherwise, or conspiracies in restraint of trade, when applied to 
railway companies.  The thing inhibited is the restraint of interstate commerce.  The thing to be accomplished is the 
maintenance of the freedom of trade.  The inhibition against the suppression of competition by any instrumentality, 
scheme, plan or device, to evade the act, applies to all corporations and all devices.  The real point is not the 
instrumentality or the scheme used to suppress the competition, but whether competition is thus suppressed and 
trade restrained and monopolized.  Nowhere in the decisions of this court is there authority for the proposition that 
combinations by stock ownership or the purchase of competing properties is invalid as to railroads but valid as to 
trading and manufacturing companies.  The act of Congress and the decisions of this court, so far as the principle 
goes, places them upon the same plane.  In the argument of the Freight Association cases it was urged by counsel 
that the inhibitions of the Sherman Act in this regard did not apply to railroads, but only included trading companies.  
It is now urged that they apply to railroads [****38]  and do not apply to manufacturing and trading companies.  But 
this court in the Freight Association cases clearly laid down the rule that while there are points of difference existing 
between the two classes of corporations, yet they are all engaged in interstate commerce, that the injuries to the 
public have many common features, and that the inhibitions apply to all.  166 U.S. 322. 
The transfer of the stocks of these companies in 1899 to the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey had no greater 
legal sanctity than the transfer to the trustees in 1882, nor was it different from the transfer of the stocks of the 
Northern Pacific and Great Northern Railways to the Northern Securities Company in 1901, two years after the 
organization of the present corporate Standard Oil combination.  It is the usual course of reasoning urged in all of 
these trust cases -- because a person has a right to purchase property, he may therefore purchase a competitor, 
and because he may purchase one competitor he may purchase all of his competitors, and what an individual may 
do a corporation may do.  These were the identical arguments pressed with great ability by counsel in the Northern 
Securities Case and [****39]  in the subsequent case of Harriman v. Northern Securities Co., 197 U.S. 291; but this 
court held to the contrary.  The position is also contrary to the almost universal trend of the American decisions both 
Federal and state.  The exercise of an individual right disconnected from all other circumstances may be legal, but 
when taken together with the other circumstances may accomplish the prohibited thing. 
The second section of the act prohibits a person or a single corporation from monopolizing or attempting to 
monopolize any part of the commerce of the country by any means whatever, and also from conspiring with any 
other person or persons to accomplish the same object.  The two sections of the act were manifestly not intended to 
cover the same thing; otherwise the second section would be useless.  Any contract or combination in the form of a 
trust or otherwise, or conspiracy in restraint of trade which tends to monopoly is prohibited by the first section.  
Addyston Pipe Case, 175 U.S. 211; United States v. Northern Securities Co., 193 U.S. 334. 
The question then is: What is the meaning of the word ""monopoly,"" as used in the second section of the act?  Of 
course Congress did not [****40]  have in mind monopoly by legislative or executive grant.  National Cotton Oil Co. 
v. Texas, 197 U.S. 129; Burrows v. Inter. Met. Co., 156 Fed. Rep. 389, opinion by Judge Holt.  Such monopolies 
could not exist in this country except by grant of Congress or the States, and it has been held that exclusive grants 
to pursue an ordinary legitimate business are void.  Butchers' Union Co. v. Crescent City Co., 111 U.S. 754. Neither 
did Congress have in mind an absolute monopoly.  This can only be obtained by legislative grant.In a country like 
ours, where everyone is free to enter the field of industry, no absolute monopoly is probable.It is sufficient to bring it 
within the act if the combination or the aggregation of capital ""tends to monopoly . . . or are reasonably calculated to 
bring about the things forbidden."" Waters-Pierce Co. v. Texas, 212 U.S. 86. Originally monopoly meant a grant by 
sovereign power of the exclusive right to carry on any employment.  The only act of exclusion was the grant itself.  If 
the grant was void, then there was no monopoly.  These monopolies were common in all monarchial countries.  
Monopoly, however, came to have a broader meaning under the common law in [****41]  the later days, and 
expecially in the United States, and in order to arrive at what Congress intended by the act of 1890 it is important to 
understand the history of the times and the general understanding of monopoly as defined by the courts and the 
political economists, and the monopolies which were known to the people generally and against which Congress 
was legislating.  Prior to the passage of this law, the various trust cases had been decided, in which trusts, like the 
221 U.S. 1, *1; 31 S. Ct. 502, **502; 55 L. Ed. 619, ***619; 1911 U.S. LEXIS 1725, ****36

 
Standard Oil of 1882, had been held illegal because they tended to create a monopoly.  People v. North River 
Sugar Refining Co., 54 Hun, 354; State v. Nebraska Distilling Co., 29 Nebraska, 700; State v. Standard Oil Co., 49 
Oh. St. 137. Various other decisions had defined monopoly as known in this country, -- such cases as Alger v. 
Thacher, 19 Pick. 51; People v. Chicago Gas Trust, 130 Illinois, 268; Salt Co. v. Guthrie, 35 Oh. St. 666; Craft v. 
McConoughy, 79 Illinois, 346; Central R.R. Co. v. Collins, 40 Georgia, 582. 
These cases were decided before the Sherman Act was passed, and defined monopoly at common law as it was 
understood and existed in this country.  They embrace trusts like the Standard Oil trust;  [****42]  agreements fixing 
prices, dividing territory, or limiting production, thereby tending to enhance or control the price of products; general 
agreements restraining individuals from engaging in any employment except as incident to the sale of property; 
purchases by corporations of all or a large proportion of competing manufacturing or mechanical plants; 
combinations of separate businesses in the form of partnership but really for the purpose of controlling the trade; 
and various other forms of acquiring monopoly.There was no unlawful exclusion of anyone else from doing 
business in these cases.  They show that the term ""monopoly"" as applied in American jurisprudence meant 
monopoly acquired by mere individual acts, as distinguished from grant of government, although the individual act 
in and of itself was not illegal; the concentration of business in the hands of one combination, corporation, or 
person, so as to give control of the product or prices; as said by Mr. Justice McKenna, in the Cotton Oil Case, ""all 
suppression of competition, by unification of interest or management."" 
The case of Craft v. McConoughy, supra, well illustrates this argument.  The pretended copartnership 
formed [****43]  between the dealers of the town of Rochelle, while carrying on the business separately, enabled 
them to control the prices to the detriment of the surrounding country.  It was therefore a monopolizing or an 
attempt to monopolize a part of the commerce of the State; and the monopolization would have been just as 
effective had these separate business enterprises been stock corporations and the stock placed in the hands of a 
holding company.  A similar illustration was the case of Smiley v. Kansas, 196 U.S. 447 (affirming 65 Kansas, 240), 
in which an attempt to control the grain trade of a particular station was held illegal under a state statute.  The 
Standard combination is an attempt to control and monopolize a vast commerce of the entire country, as these 
people undertook to control and monopolize a local commerce. 
The term ""monopoly,"" therefore, as used in the Sherman Act was intended to cover such monopolies or attempts to 
monopolize as were known to exist in this country; those which were defined as illegal at common law by the 
States, when applied to intrastate commerce, and those which were known to Congress when the act was passed.  
The monopoly most commonly known in this [****44]  country, and which the debates in Congress 1 show were 
intended to be prohibited by the act, were those acquired by combination (by purchase or otherwise) of competing 
concerns.  The purchase of a competitor, as a separate transaction standing alone, was the exercise of a lawful 
privilege, not in and of itself unlawful at common law nor prohibited by statute, yet in the Northern Securities Case 
the purchase of stock in a railway was held to be illegal when done in pursuance of a scheme of monopoly. 
It is not necessary in this case, and we doubt whether in any case it is possible, to make a comprehensive definition 
of monopoly which will cover every case that might arise.  It is sufficient if the case at bar clearly comes within the 
provisions of the act.  We believe that the defendants have acquired a monopoly by means of a combination of the 
principal manufacturing concerns through a holding company; that they have, by reason of the very size of the 
combination, been able to maintain this monopoly through unfair [****45]  methods of competition, discriminatory 
freight rates, and other means set forth in the proofs.  If this act did not mean this kind of monopoly, we doubt if 
there is such a thing in this country.  The men who framed the Constitution of this country were familiar with the 
history of monopolies growing out of acts of the Government.  They guarded the people against these by 
constitutional provisions, but they left open the widest field for the exercise of individual enterprise, and it was the 
abuse of these personal privileges, made easy by state laws permitting unlimited incorporation, which gave rise to 
the evils that convinced the people of the necessity for the passage of the Sherman Anti-trust Act.  It was not 
monopolies as known to the English common law, but monopolies such as were commonly understood to exist in 
this country which that act prohibited.

As a natural conclusion from the foregoing definition of monopoly by appellants' counsel they claim that the 
inhibitions of the second section are against the unlawful means used to acquire the monopoly, but that acquired 
monopoly is not illegal; therefore that the court can only restrain the means by which the monopoly was acquired, 
 [****46]  leaving the monopoly to exist.  We believe this to be an altogether too refined construction of the act.  If 
such be the true interpretation, the result would be that one could combine all the separate manufactures in a given 
branch of industry in this country by use of unlawful means such as discriminatory freight rates, but, if not attacked 
by the Government before it had obtained complete control of the business, its very size, with its ramifications 
through all the States, would make it impossible for anyone else to compete, and it could control the price of 
products in the entire country and would be beyond the reach of the law.  It could, by selling at a low price where a 
competitor was engaged in business and by raising the price where there was no attempt at competition, absolutely 
control the business without itself suffering any loss; and yet the Government would be powerless to destroy the 
monopoly because the unlawful means had been abandoned. 
If the court finds this combination to be in restraint of trade and a monopoly, it is authorized by § 3 to enjoin the

The maintenance of free competition among railways has become the settled-policy of the Nation. 
 [****7]  The Interstate Commerce Act, in its provisions against contracts, agreements, or combinations between

The Government's brief contains a synopsis of the constitutional and statutory provisions of the several States and 
Territories on the subject of parallel and competing lines. 
Mr. N. H. Loomis and Mr. P. F. Dunne for appellees: 
The object which the Union Pacific had in view in acquiring an interest in the Southern Pacific, was not to suppress 
competition or to obtain a monopoly, but to secure a permanent relationship with the Southern Pacific [****13]  
which would insure for it a perpetual through line to San Francisco, as contemplated by Congress, and give to it as 
well, an entrance into all the traffic producing centers of California. 
As to the conception which Congress and the public had, of a single, indivisible line of railroad extending from the 
Missouri River, with continuous rails to the Pacific Ocean, see act of July 1, 1862.  Not only did Congress provide 
226 U.S. 61, *61; 33 S. Ct. 53, **53; 57 L. Ed. 124, ***124; 1912 U.S. LEXIS 2131, ****9

 
for the permanent physical continuity of the proposed railroads, but gave power to any two or more of them to 
consolidate and thus place themselves under a single management.  §§ 10, 12, 16, act of July 1, 1862, 12 Stat. 
497; § 16, act of July 2, 1864, 13 Stat. 362.  See Ames v. Kansas, 111 U.S. 449. 
The hope and expectation of a single, indivisible line of railroad from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean could 
not be fully realized as long as the ownership was vested in separate corporations and the operation in different 
managements. 
It is clear from the testimony that the officials of the Union Pacific regarded the Southern Pacific not as a 
competitive, but as a connecting line. 
The testimony of the witnesses and the surrounding circumstances demonstrate [****14]  that the object and intent 
of purchasing the stock of the Southern Pacific, was to protect the integrity of the through line from the Missouri 
River to the Pacific coast and to procure for the Union Pacific a permanent entrance into interior California points; it 
was not to obtain a competing line or to stifle competition. 
This intent was shown by betterments.  As to deducting intent from actions of the parties see United States v. 
American Tobacco Company, 221 U.S. 106. 
The Southern Pacific was not bound to agree to joint tariffs under any law in force when the stock purchase was 
made. 
There was no law in 1901 by which that company could be forced to grant other than local rates between Ogden 
and San Francisco on traffic tendered to it by the Union Pacific; nor did the Pacific Railroad Act of July 2, 1864, 
which required the Union Pacific and the Central Pacific, as well as the other roads included therein, to be operated 
and used for all purposes of communication and travel so far as the public and Government are concerned as one 
continuous line extend to requiring joint tariffs.  L.R. &c.  R.R. Co. v. E.T. Va. & G., 2 I.C.C. Rep. 456, and 3 I.C.C. 
Rep. 1, 6. 
This court has [****15]  held that the fixing of rates is a legislative power which cannot be exercised by the courts.  
The Express Cases, 117 U.S. 1, 28; Central Stock Yards v. Louisville &c.  Ry. Co., 192 U.S. 568, 571; Oregon 
Short Line & U.N. Ry. Co. v. Northern Pacific R. Co., 51 Fed. Rep. 465, 474; Little Rock & M.R. Co. v. St. Louis 
S.W. Ry. Co., 63 Fed. Rep. 775. 
The want of power to compel railroads to enter into such agreements led to the adoption of the Hepburn Act, §§ 15, 
34 Stat. 590, and the Interstate Commerce Commission was authorized to establish through routes, fix rates and to 
determine the division of the through rate between connecting carriers; but as to the law prior thereto, see Southern 
Pacific v. Int. Com. Comm., 200 U.S. 536, 553; Chicago & N.W. Ry. v. Osborne, 52 Fed. Rep. 915. 
The want of legal power on the part of the Union Pacific to compel the Southern Pacific to recognize the usual 
incidents of a through route and the discretion possessed by the Southern Pacific to do as its own welfare might 
dictate with respect to through rates, gave to that company additional advantages, and made it possible for the 
Southern Pacific to more effectively control the situation. 
The so-called [****16]  Portland route to San Francisco is not a practicable one.  Union Pacific officials had 
frequently considered the opening of the Portland gateway for San Francisco traffic, but had always concluded that 
it would be an unprofitable move and therefore it was not done.One serious objection was the length of the line.  
Portland is substantially the same distance from Omaha as San Francisco is, and the rate to San Francisco through 
Portland would have to be the same as the rate via the short, direct line through Ogden; and the rate to Portland 
was the same as the rate to San Francisco.  The Union Pacific would receive no greater revenue for hauling freight 
through Portland to San Francisco than it would for the same freight delivered at Portland. 
As a matter of fact the Portland route to San Francisco has never been used, although it has been open, physically, 
since 1884. 
The most conclusive point, showing that the Portland route to San Francisco is and always has been, an 
impracticable one, is the fact that the Northern rail lines terminating at Seattle, Tacoma and Portland have never 
been able to carry any substantial amount of transcontinental traffic to or from San Francisco. 
226 U.S. 61, *61; 33 S. Ct. 53, **53; 57 L. Ed. 124, ***124; 1912 U.S. LEXIS 2131, ****13

 
 [****17]  The Government's argument is that the Portland route to San Francisco could have been used by the 
Union Pacific, in view of the successful operation of the Sunset line between New York and San Francisco via New 
Orleans by the Southern Pacific.  The conditions surrounding the operation of the Sunset route are so dissimilar, 
however, that it cannot be regarded as a parallel case.  In the first place it is operated under a single management 
from New York to San Francisco and California business is given preferred attention.  The freight is carried by boat 
from New York to New Orleans without stop, the California freight quickly transferred to cars waiting upon the 
wharves and transported in trainload lots to Los Angeles and San Francisco.  It is a service which cannot be 
duplicated by any other broken water and rail line. 
The traffic upon which complainant mainly relies to establish competitive relations between the Union Pacific and 
the Southern Pacific in 1901, was traffic between the Atlantic seaboard and the middle west on the one hand and 
California points on the other.  As to all this traffic the Union Pacific and Southern Pacific were not competitors, but 
connections, and in [****18]  a sense, partners. 
A railroad is not a competitor of its connections on business handled by them jointly under a through tariff.  
Southern Pacific v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 200 U.S. 536. 
In the Standard Oil Case, 221 U.S. 1, 80, this court recognized the legality of combining various pipe lines, in order 
to make a continuous line, and declared that an agreement or combination so to do would not be repugnant to the 
Sherman Act. 
Some of the reasons why Union Pacific was not a competitor of Southern Pacific's Sunset route are that it was a 
connection of the Southern Pacific, handling through business on a joint tariff, to which the Southern Pacific had 
voluntarily agreed.  In entering upon this relationship and agreeing to the joint tariff, the Union Pacific knew that the 
Southern Pacific possessed another line via New Orleans and that it would endeavor to route traffic that way and 
get the long haul whenever circumstances permitted it.  But notwithstanding that fact the Union Pacific was willing 
to continue the relationship.  As a matter of fact it had no choice about the matter; it was compelled to submit to 
these conditions.  The Southern Pacific was not only a partner [****19]  but a dominant partner -- a partner with 
which the Union Pacific was required to associate or go out of business.  With no rails of its own into California and 
no other railroad but the Southern Pacific to handle its California traffic, it was impossible for it to occupy the 
position of an independent, hostile competitor. 
The same principle is also controlling when we consider that as between the Union Pacific and the Southern 
Pacific, San Francisco is a local non-competitive point on the Southern Pacific, situated eight hundred miles distant 
from the western terminus of the Union Pacific. 
In the next place, the Government's argument assumes that two parts of the same railroad can compete with each 
other; that is to say, that that portion of the Southern Pacific Railroad extending from San Francisco to Ogden can 
compete with that portion thereof extending from San Francisco to New York. 
This assumption cannot be correct, as it is obvious that a railroad company cannot compete with itself. 
Furthermore, the Union Pacific was a constituent member of the Ogden route before the purchase, and it continued 
as such thereafter.  If the Ogden route, including the Union Pacific, competed [****20]  with the Sunset route before 
the purchase, it still competes with it; if it did not compete with it before the purchase, it does not compete with it 
now.  Competitive conditions between the two routes have not been changed by placing the Union Pacific and the 
Southern Pacific under a common management. 
As the Southern Pacific controlled the routing of California business, and the Union Pacific could obtain the 
business through the friendly interposition of that company only, it cannot be maintained that the Union Pacific was 
a competitor of the company it was dependent upon to get the business. 
If the Southern Pacific was a competitor of the Union Pacific on California business, because of the Sunset route, 
and the Union Pacific cannot own the stock of the Southern Pacific, then it will be impossible for any of the large 
railroads of the country to extend their lines by purchase or consolidation.  Every railroad with more than one 
226 U.S. 61, *61; 33 S. Ct. 53, **53; 57 L. Ed. 124, ***124; 1912 U.S. LEXIS 2131, ****16

 
gateway is in the same predicament.  If the Government were devising a scheme to prevent the consolidation of all 
railroads, regardless of whether they were parallel or connecting lines, a better one could not have been concocted 
than the theory adopted [****21]  in this case. 
Another reason why the Union Pacific should not be considered as a competitor of the Southern Pacific on 
transcontinental business to and from California points is that it is but one link in the all-rail through line from the 
Atlantic seaboard to San Francisco, while the Southern Pacific has a continuous line from New York to San 
Francisco, under a single management.  The Union Pacific is dependent not only on the Southern Pacific on the 
west, but on its eastern connections as well, to fix a through rate or to maintain a through service; in itself it could do 
nothing without the voluntary cooperation of the lines extending east from Omaha or Kansas City. 
If one line is the competitor of another merely because both of them happen to be links in systems of through routes 
which compete with each other, practically every railroad in the United States is a competitor of every other railroad 
in the United States, and under those conditions not one line could purchase or consolidate with another line 
because of its being a competitor. 
Complainant's testimony as to the existence of separate soliciting agencies and of the consolidation of certain of 
those agencies subsequent [****22]  to 1901 does not prove that the Southern Pacific and Union Pacific were in 
competition with each other. 
All the large railroad systems in the United States have several gateways, representing different routes, through 
which their traffic may be handled; for instance, the New York Central, Pennsylvania and Baltimore & Ohio railroads 
have among others, their St. Louis and Chicago gateways; the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul, its Omaha, Kansas 
City and St. Paul gateways; the Missouri Pacific, its Pueblo and El Paso gateways; the Southern Railway, its 
Memphis and New Orleans gateways; the Louisville & Nashville, its St. Louis, Memphis and New Orleans 
gateways. 
It is the effort of soliciting agents to secure business through these different gateways, as varying circumstances 
require them to solicit in favor of the one or the other, which induces the belief that there is competition between the 
routes represented by them, even though the agents may be working in the interests of the same carrier.  A brief 
consideration of the proposition will disclose its fallacy. 
Complainant's witnesses who expressed the opinion that the Union Pacific and Southern Pacific were competing 
upon California [****23]  business did so entirely upon the assumption that the rivalry of soliciting agents was the 
competition of railroads.  The testimony shows, however, how fallacious such testimony is and demonstrates that 
the strife for business may merely be the competition which is constantly going on between agents in the service of 
the same principal. 
As the work of soliciting agents against each other may be in pursuance of a common employment and the results 
of their labors for the benefit of the same railroad or combination of connecting railroads, testimony as to the rivalry 
of soliciting agents cannot be used to show the existence of competition between the routes which they represent. 
The fact that two railroads have separate soliciting agents does not necessarily prove that the railroads they 
represent are competitors. 
The Government itself asserts that the Union Pacific and Southern Pacific are not competing at the present time 
and yet it appears that there are separate soliciting agencies representing those companies at New York and San 
Francisco and other points. 
The other alleged competitive routes of minor importance did not make the Union Pacific and the Southern Pacific 
competitors [****24]  in any direct and substantial sense. 
In order to bring the competition within the inhibition of the Sherman Act, it must be direct and substantial.  
Competition which is indirect and remote is not competition within the meaning of the statute; traffic unsubstantial in 
amount is not included within the terms of the law.  When the Government seeks to set aside transactions as in 
restraint of trade and commerce, the burden rests upon it not only to prove the restraint of commerce, but the 
restraint of a substantial volume of commerce.  It must affirmatively show that the competition was of some practical 
importance and that the restraint of commerce involved was unreasonable.

The Sherman Act was not intended to apply to combinations whose effect upon interstate commerce was indirect or 
incidental only, or which might remotely affect that commerce.  United States v. Joint Traffic Assn., 171 U.S. 505, 
568. 
This court puts contracts which only indirectly and incidentally restrain interstate commerce upon the same basis 
with respect to validity as legislation of the States, of which there are numerous examples, which incidentally and 
indirectly affect interstate commerce and yet are [****25]  valid because it is not a direct regulation of such 
commerce.  Anderson v. United States, 171 U.S. 604, 615, and Addyston Pipe and Steel Co. v. United States, 175 
U.S. 211, 229. 
This court held in one of the most important and farreaching decisions ever announced by it, that the Sherman Act 
does not prohibit every contract, combination, etc., in restraint of trade, but only those which unreasonably restrain 
trade and commerce.  Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 221 U.S. 1; United States v. Am. Tobacco Co., 221 U.S. 
106; Cincinnati Packet Co. v. Bay, 200 U.S. 179; Phillips v. Cement Co., 125 Fed. Rep. 594; Kimball v. Atchison &c.  
Ry. Co., 46 Fed. Rep. 888; State v. Cent. of Ga. Ry., 109 Georgia, 716. 
Treating all of the traffic over the various routes of minor importance as competitive and considering it in the 
aggregate, it is a mere bagatelle when compared with the entire traffic of the Union Pacific and the Southern 
Pacific.  It amounts to only 0.88 per cent of the tonnage of the Southern Pacific and to only 3.10 per cent. of the 
tonnage of the Union Pacific, while the revenue of the Southern Pacific from this traffic aggregates only 1.25 per 
cent of its total revenue, an amount [****26]  which it is not conceivable that the Union Pacific would have cared to 
invest millions in Southern Pacific stock to suppress.  See Rogers v. Nashville &c.  Ry. Co., 91 Fed. Rep. 299, and 
cases supra. 
The purchase of the stock of the Northern Pacific and the Santa Fe by defendants, and the settlement of right of 
way controversies with the Clark interests, which resulted in the joint construction and ownership of the San Pedro 
road, were not acts performed with the object of suppressing competition or of acquiring a monopoly, nor did they 
have that effect. 
A review of the entire record demonstrates that a monopoly has not been created, that there has been no 
suppression of competition, and that there was no conspiracy to effectuate either purpose.  The record shows, on 
the other hand, that the interest which the Union Pacific acquired in the Southern Pacific has been of direct and 
substantial benefit to trade and commerce. 
The Union Pacific ownership of Southern Pacific stock was not a control, and did not import, as a matter of law, the 
power in any view of the case to restrict competition.  The Union Pacific merely became a minority stockholder, 
having by its first purchase acquired [****27]  only about 37 1/2 per cent of the stock and never acquired a majority.  
While the Union Pacific may have been able to keep control with less than a majority of stock there was always a 
possibility that it could not do so.  Stock control condemned by this court has been of an actual majority.  Pearsall v. 
Great Northern Ry., 161 U.S. 671; Northern Securities Case, 120 Fed. Rep. 726; S.C., 193 U.S. 106; Noyes on 
Intercorporate Relations, § 294; and see Pullman Co. v. Mo. Pac. R.R., 115 U.S. 578. 
The acquisition and ownership by the Union Pacific of the Huntington stock by out and out sale to it by a 
stockholder in the market, is not, as such, within the power of Congress to regulate, under the commerce clause of 
the Constitution.  United States v. Knight Co., 156 U.S. 1. 
The acquisition and ownership of property by a corporation or citizen of a State is not interstate commerce.  The 
Union Pacific is a Utah corporation and had power to purchase stock of the Southern Pacific.  Nat. Bank v. 
Matthews, 98 U.S. 628; St. Louis R.R. v. Terre Haute R.R., 145 U.S. 407; Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168. 
A state corporation is subject to regulation by Congress only to the extent and by the measure [****28]  of its 
engagement in interstate commerce.  Employers' Liability Cases, 207 U.S. 463, 499. See Ashley v. Ryan, 153 U.S. 
436, 442; Louisville & Nashville Case, 161 U.S. 677; Mobile &c.  R.R. Co. v. Mississippi, 210 U.S. 187, 202.

The authority of the several States to permit railroads within their respective territory to consolidate on terms 
prescribed by each is inconsistent with the assertion of a power of Congress to the same effect, as it could only 
prescribe a uniform rule. 
The purchase by the Union Pacific of the Huntington stock by out and out sale is not within the purview of the 
Sherman Law.  An out and out sale is quite distinguishable from a collateral stipulation or covenant running with the 
sale. 
The combination or conspiracy prohibited by the Sherman Law is essentially a process terminable in future.  It is not 
like a sale completed when made.  Mitchell v. Reynolds, 1 P. Wms. 181. For some of these collateral agreements to 
sales see Diamond Match Co. v. Roeber, 106 N.Y. 473; Nordenfeldt v. Maxim, App. Cas., 1904, 535; Bancroft v. 
Embossing Co., 72 N.H. 407; Packet Co. v. Bay, 200 U.S. 179. 
Something more than the acquisition of a competing property is necessary to [****29]  bring the purchaser and

(1) The trial court erred in overruling the demurrer because of the defect of parties plaintiff. The State would be the 
only authorized plaintiff, yet the petition in no manner alleges that the State brings the suit or is plaintiff. R.S. 1909, 
sec. 10322; Patterson v. Temple, 27 Ark. 202; U. S. v. Dougherty, 7 Blatchf. 424. (2) The trial court erred in not 
sustaining the demurrer, for defects in not alleging the necessary party plaintiff to be the State, and the body of the 
petition alone demonstrates the party moving. State v. Matson, 38 Mo. 489; Higgins v. Railroad, 36 Mo. 418; 
Proctor v. Railroad, 42 Mo. App. 124; Headlee v. Cloud, 51 Mo. 301. (3) The demurrer should have been sustained 
because of defect of parties plaintiff, in that the action should be ""for the use"" of the city of St. Louis, in accord with 
the Constitution, since all such fines and penalties go direct to the school fund. The provision (Sec. 10304) in this 
law for payment into the State Treasury is unconstitutional. Constitution of Missouri, art.  [***2]  11, sec. 8; In re 
Stead, 116 Mo. 537; R.S. 1909, sec. 3030; State v. Land Co., 97 Mo. App. 226. (4) The trial court erred in 
overruling the demurrer because there is no allegation in the petition that defendant ever had any connection with 
any contract or understanding or other agreement illegal under the law against pools, trusts and monopolies. The 
omission to file the affidavit of innocence, without such allegations and proof, is no ground to forfeit the charter of 
defendant. R.S. 1909, sec. 10304. While the terms of section 10322 may appear at first glance to warrant forfeiture, 
they are to be read along with section 10304 in pari materia, and together the paramount intent is to forfeit for 
breach of the law. Want of affidavit warrants beginning of suit (if the requirement be valid) but that alone is not 
249 Mo. 702, *702; 156 S.W. 967, **967; 1913 Mo. LEXIS 97, ***1

 
sufficient to forfeit the charter. R.S. 1909, sec. 10298; Taylor v. Taylor, 10 Minn. 107; Edelstein v. U. S., 149 Fed. 
636. The entire chapter on pools, trusts and conspiracies should be included and considered in reaching the intent 
of section 10322, and the literal terms of the latter (or rather its implication) as to forfeiture should be narrowed in 
order to harmonize with section [***3]  10304, which defines the controlling purpose of the whole enactment. That is 
necessary according to established rules for interpretation of statutes. State v. Emerson, 39 Mo. 89; State v. King, 
44 Mo. 283; State v. Diveling, 66 Mo. 375; State v. Hemen, 70 Mo. 441; Cole v. Skrainka, 105 Mo. 303; Kane v. 
Railroad, 112 Mo. 34. (5) The trial court erred in not sustaining the demurrer (on the last ground thereof) because 
the required statutory affidavit of innocence (recited in the petition) cannot lawfully be demanded of any officer of 
defendant, in that the statement exacted therein that the company has not, ""at any time within one year"" from the 
date of the affidavit, participated in any of the forbidden agreements, is ex post facto and makes the requirement 
inconsistent with section 10304, as well as unconstitutional and void. Constitution of Mo., art. 2, sec. 15; State ex 
rel. v. Hardware Co., 109 Mo. 118. (6) The trial court erred in not sustaining the demurrer because the petition does 
not state a cause of action, in that a proceeding by quo warranto, either ancient, original, or by information of that 
nature, is essential to obtain forfeiture of franchise of a business corporation.  [***4]  R.S. 1909, sec. 2631. Section 
10322 does not conflict with or repeal section 2631, nor authorize any other proceeding than by quo warranto to 
forfeit such a charter. (7) The trial court erred in not sustaining the demurrer to the petition because the form of the 
affidavit demanded of innocence by the officers of defendant could only be made in a county, and no authority to 
alter the form in any respect is given by the law to company officers in St. Louis City. Hence, they could not swear 
to same in its procrustean form without being penalized under section 10324. R.S. 1909, sec. 10322. (8) The trial 
court, by refusing the peremptory instruction for defendant, denied to defendant and its officers the equal protection 
of the laws guaranteed to them by the 14th Amendment to the Federal Constitution, and denied to defendant and 
its officers their rights and immunities thereby secured, in that it is unreasonable and oppressive to require 
corporate officers to make such an affidavit of innocence, and yet to leave every ""partnership, individual or 
association of individuals"" (also within the law against monopolies, sections 10299, 10303) in the same situation 
and circumstances immune from [***5]  such requirement. Railroad v. Ellis, 165 U.S. 150; Paddock v. Railroad, 155 
Mo. 524. (9) The trial court erred in not finding for defendant because the requirement of the affidavit of innocence 
is not validated by the supposed immunity defined in section 10325, because as to the affidavit the immunity is not 
complete and not commensurate with the constitutional guaranty to the officers of the defendant against the giving 
of a self-incriminating affidavit. State ex rel. v. Hardware Co., 109 Mo. 118; Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U.S. 547;

(1) The requirement in Sec. 10322, R.S. 1909, that an affidavit be made is not void as violative of the Constitution 
which provides that ""no person shall be compelled to testify against himself in a criminal cause,"" because that 
section provides that ""no person shall be subject to any criminal prosecution on account of any matter or thing 
truthfully disclosed by the affidavit."" The immunity afforded by the statute is coextensive [***6]  with the 
constitutional privilege of silence, and it is sufficient. R.S. 1909, sec. 10325; People ex rel. v. Foundry and Iron Co., 
201 Ill. 236; State v. Jacks, 69 Kan. 387; Jack v. Kansas, 199 U.S. 272; State ex inf. v. Standard Oil Co., 218 Mo. 
375; Brown v. Walker, 161 U.S. 596; Hale v. Henkel, 201 U.S. 43. (2) Section 10322 does not deny to appellant 
corporation the ""equal protection of the laws,"" although it applies only to corporations and exempts individuals and 
partnerships. People ex rel. v. Foundry Co., 201 Ill. 236; State ex inf. v. Oil Co., 218 Mo. 368; Land & Fruit Co. v. 
Curry, 103 Pac. (Cal.) 341; Constitution, art. 12, sec. 5. (3) The Legislature had the power by this statute to require 
the affidavit to be filed, and to provide that a failure in that regard should subject the offending party to a penalty to 
be adjudged against it by the courts. People ex rel. v. Foundry Co., 201 Ill. 236; Kaiser Land Co. v. Curry, 103 Pac. 
341. This is a proceeding under article 3 of chapter 98, R.S. 1909, not under article 1 of said chapter. Section 
10304, by its terms, applies only to violations of the provisions of article 1, and section 10322 does not refer to 
section 10304. (4)  [***7]  This is a proceeding authorized and provided by statute (section 10322) to enforce a 
statutory requirement. A statement of the facts under the statute is all that is required of the pleading. (5) This 
proceeding was brought by the circuit attorney ""in the name of the State and at the relation of the circuit attorney,"" 
as required by statute, and the petition is sufficient in its allegations as to parties. R.S. 1909, secs. 10322, 1794,

It is sufficient if there was an injury or threat to cause a loss to another's business. Door Co. v. Fuelle, 215 Mo. 
4221. (4) ""The rule of reason"" is excluded by our statutes, and any combination which tends to limit or control or 
lessen trade or competition, no matter how little, falls within the condemnation of the antitrust laws of this State. 
State v. People's Ice Co., 246 Mo. 221. (5) As a matter of law an agreement between defendants or between them 
and other members of the traders exchange not to buy from or sell to the plaintiff's customers through the plaintiff, 
was a combination,  [***3]  agreement, trust, pool, association and conspiracy, etc., to restrain and limit trade and 
competition at this great cattle market at the stockyards in Kansas City, and whether such limitation or restraint of 
trade was ""great or small,"" the law was violated. State ex rel. v. People's Ice Co., 246 Mo. 221. (6) ""It is the 
combination or agreement that results in restraint of trade that the statute denounces, whether the result is 
accomplished by the act of each individual on his own account, doing as he agreed to do, or by the joint action of 
all. . . . It is the combination to accomplish that result that the statute is aimed to prevent."" State ex rel. v. Live Stock 
Exchange, 211 Mo. 193; State ex rel. Barker v. Assurance Co., 158 S. W. 644. (7) All the sections and articles of 
our antitrust statutes are in pari materia and must be construed as if contained in one act. Hence it follows that 
section 8981 in article 2 of chapter 143, relating to pools, trusts and conspiracies, Revised Statutes 1899, which 
gives triple damages to any person injured in his property or business arising from any violation of that article, also 
gives such triple damages arising from any violation of any provisions [***4]  of article 1 of said chapter 143. State 
v. Oil Co., 218 Mo. 354; State v. Elevator Co., 106 N. W. 983; Brewing Co. v. Belinder, 97 Mo. App. 64. (8) It is too 
late to challenge the constitutionality of our antitrust statutes for the alleged reason that they interfere with the right 
to contract or take property without compensation, or due process of law, or deny any person the equal protection 
of the law. All these questions have long since been foreclosed and settled by this court. Standard Oil Case, 218 
Mo. 378. (9) The case of Anderson v. United States, 171 U.S. 604, so much relied on by the defendants, is not in 
point. All that case decided, as has been held by the Court of Appeals of this State and the Supreme Court of 
Kansas, was that the members of the traders exchange were not engaged in interstate commerce; and therefore 
the Sherman Act did not apply. Brewing Co. v. Belinder, 97 Mo. App. 64; State v. Wilson, 84 Pac. 737. Furthermore 
as pointed out in State ex rel. v. Live Stock Exchange, 211 Mo. 197, and State v. Aikens, 83 Kan. 792, all the rules 
of the traders exchange were not before the court in the Anderson case, especially the rule requiring the payment of 
a thousand [***5]  dollar entrance fee, and the approval of two-thirds of the members before any person could enter 
the portals of the exchange and be a trader on the yards with none to molest or make him afraid. Besides, it may be 
said that when the Anderson case was decided this antitrust legislation was a sort of a ""Mysterious Stranger"" -- to 
be kept at a dignified and perfectly proper distance -- and did not meet with the cordial reception and hearty 
welcome which its great virtues entitled it to, and which it has since, upon better acquaintance, been accorded, 
especially by the Supreme Court of this State. (10) The statutes so far as they provide for a civil suit to recover triple 
damages are not penal. Atlanta v. Foundry & Pipe Works, 127 F. 23; Casey v. Transit Co., 116 Mo. App. 250. (11) 
It is settled in this State that the enforcement and construction of these antitrust statutes is not to be ""approached 
with a sour face,"" but these statutes are remedial and must be liberally construed, so as to advance the remedy for 
the great wrongs therein denounced. It is the policy and purpose of the law that these statutes shall be rigidly 
enforced against all wrongdoers, and that the guilty shall not escape [***6]  through any astute or artificial 
construction which subverts the general intent of the lawmakers -- which was to destroy the whole brood of trusts 
and combines against trade in this State, from the least unto the greatest. State v. Oil Co., 218 Mo. 359; State ex 
inf. v. Ins. Co., 152 Mo. 43. (12) The antitrust laws apply to commission merchants. The learned counsel for the 
appellants, neither at the trial of the case below nor in their briefs in this court, made any claim or point that the 
antitrust statutes did not apply to combines or boycotts against commission merchants, and therefore we did not 
argue that point or submit any authorities. In State ex rel. v. Live Stock Exchange, 211 Mo. 181, this court passed 
upon the very question, and held that the statute did apply to commission merchants, members of the Kanass City 
Live Stock Exchange. See, also, State v. Wilson, 73 Kan. 334. So the record in this case shows that all the live 
stock -- cattle, hogs and sheep -- which comes to Kansas City is sent to commission merchants and sold by them. It 
is true that they sell on commission and do not own the stock, but they are the parties who actually sell it on the 
market, and for the most [***7]  part the owners never know for what the stock is sold until after a report of the sales 
is made. The commission men represent the owners, stand in the place of the owners and they are certainly bound 
and controlled by the antitrust laws of this State. And they can enter into an agreement and combine for the 
purpose of restraining trade and competition, or of lessening or raising prices, or doing anything which the owner 
himself could do in violation of the antitrust law. The antitrust law was primarily enacted for the purpose of 
protecting the producers and the consumers of farm products and other necessaries of life from combinations or 
260 Mo. 324, *324; 168 S.W. 934, **934; 1914 Mo. LEXIS 120, ***2

 
monopolies which affect the prices or which tend to lessen competition in the trade. It is well known that nearly all of 
the food products, both raw material and finished, are for the most part handled by commission men, who, of all 
others, are in a position to enter into combines affecting the prices and trade and competition in the same. Butter, 
eggs, cheese, potatoes, flour, sugar, apples, oranges, lemons, fruits of all kinds, live stock -- cattle, hogs, sheep, 
goats -- poultry are bought and sold, and the prices are fixed, as a matter of fact,  [***8]  by commission merchants. 
And this antitrust statute was passed mainly, for the very purpose of protecting the producers and consumers of 
these food stuffs -- the farmers and the town people -- from combines and trusts formed by commission men. 
Therefore, to read them out of the benefits or the penalties of these statutes, would be to defeat the primary 
purpose of the law. There is nothing in the statutes saying that the combines or contracts or agreements in restraint 
of trade, condemned by the statutes, can only be or must be made by the owners of the products. But the statute 
says, ""If any two or more persons or corporations who are engaged in buying or selling any article of commerce,"" 
Sec. 8978, R. S. 1899; that ""all arrangements, contracts, agreements or combination between persons or 
corporations, or between persons or any association of persons or corporations, designed or made with a view to 
lessen, or which tend to lessen, full and free competition,"" Sec. 8966, R. S. 1899; and ""Any person who shall 
create, enter into, become a member of or participate in any pool, trust, agreement, combination, confederation or 
understanding with any person or persons in restraint of trade [***9]  or competition,"" Sec. 8965. The same 
language is used in the revised law of 1907. So that it is nowhere suggested or implied in any section of the statute, 
or in any of the language used, that a vicious agreement in restraint of trade can only be made by the owners of the 
produce; but it is assumed that such agreements may be made by others, to-wit, by their agents and other persons 
engaged in the actual business of buying or selling or fixing the prices, such as commission merchants. To hold 
otherwise would be to expose the producers of food stuffs (the farmers) and the consumers (the town people) to all 
the evils which the statute so clearly intended to prevent. This cannot be the law. The section of the statute 
providing the remedy says that ""any person injured in his business"" by a violation of the statute shall have a cause 
of action. He does not have to be the owner of anything, but if his business is injured or destroyed by an illegal 
combine, he can recover his damages. These statutes are highly salutary and remedial in their purpose, and are 
not to be destroyed or repealed by a strict or hostile construction. State v. Oil Co., 218 Mo. 359, 384, 460; State ex 
inf. v. Ins. Co.,  [***10]  152 Mo. 43; State ex inf. v. Oil Co., 194 Mo. 148; State ex inf. v. Packing Co., 173 Mo. 356. 
All who are engaged in trade must be embraced in these antitrust laws, otherwise they are void as discriminatory 
and invading the equal protection of the law provisions of the Federal Constitution. The first Illinois antitrust law 
was declared void because it exempted ""live stock while in the hands of the raiser."" Connolly v. Pipe Co., 184 U.S.

(1) The information in this cause is sufficient and specifically charges facts which show, if true, that respondents 
have violated the antitrust statutes of this State. There is no misjoinder of parties respondent. State ex inf. v. 
Railroad, 240 Mo. 35; State ex rel. v. Grimm, 220 Mo. 483; State ex inf. v. Standard Oil Co., 218 Mo. 1; Sec. 10310, 
R. S. 1909. (2) This action is not barred by the Statutes of Limitation. In this State we have no Statute of Limitations 
against the State instituting suits by the Attorney-General by information, in the nature of quo warranto, such as the 
suit at bar. Besides, at the time of filing this information respondents were still members of and participating in the 
unlawful pool and combination. High on Extraordinary Legal Remedies (3 Ed.), sec. 621; State ex rel. v. Westport, 
116 Mo. 595; State ex rel. v. Huff, 105 Mo. App. 634; State ex rel. v. Vandalia, 119 Mo. App. 424; Commonwealth v. 
Birchett, 2 Va. Cas. 51; State ex rel. v. Turnpike Co., 8 R. I. 521. (3) The commissioner who heard [***2]  the 
testimony and had the witnesses before him reports that from the evidence adduced the National Packing Company 
was organized for the express purpose of limiting and destroying free competition, and that respondents have been 
265 Mo. 121, *121; 176 S.W. 382, **382; 1915 Mo. LEXIS 9, ***1

 
and are maintained by the National Packing Company solely in furtherance of that unlawful purpose. Unless the 
findings of a commissioner appointed by the court to report on the facts are affirmatively and clearly shown to be 
wrong, the court will accept same as correct. State ex rel. v. Tobacco Co., 177 Mo. 38; State ex rel. v. Standard Oil 
Co., 194 Mo. 164; Tufts v. Latshaw, 172 Mo. 371; Bank v. Donnell, 172 Mo. 402. (4) The National Packing 
Company was organized as a means and instrumentality through which to continue and perpetuate the various 
methods of combination which existed prior to its organization and through which methods the large packing 
interests of the United States were brought into an unlawful combine. This being true, various decisions of appellate 
courts herein cited, condemn respondents herein as being members of an unlawful pool. Sections 10298, 10299,

369. (5) Independent of whether the National Packing Company was organized as a part and in pursuance of a 
former pool and combine, it was organized for the purpose, or, at least, provides a means through which the 
Armour Packing interests, the Swift Packing interests, the Morris Packing interests and the various subsidiary [***5]  
concerns, including the respondents, can and do lessen competition. Respondents are therefore guilty of the 
charges contained in the information. Cases cited under Point 4; United States v. Tobacco Co., 164 Fed. 700;

Oil Co., 49 Ohio St. 137. (6) Independent of the means which the National Packing Company affords, the Armour 
interest, the Morris interests, and the Swift interests meeting together with the representatives of respondents and 
jointly agreeing upon the affairs of these various interests, it is an unlawful combine, to which respondents are 
parties, in that it effectively destroys all competition and removes all incentive for competition among the various 
corporations, including the respondents, owned and controlled by the [***6]  National Packing Company. Cases 
cited under Points 4 and 5, supra; State ex rel. v. Jockey Club, 200 Mo. 32; Terrett v. Taylor, 9 Cranch, 51; 
Commonwealth v. Bank, 28 Pa. St. 389; People v. Refining Co., 54 Hun, 354. (7) The various objections of 
unconstitutionality raised by respondents in their answer to these statutes are untenable, having all been foreclosed 
by prior decisions of this court and the United States Supreme Court. They are no longer open questions in this 
State. State ex inf. v. Ins. Co., 150 Mo. 113; State ex inf. v. Ins. Co., 152 Mo. 1; State ex inf. v. Tobacco Co., 177

(A) The information is in nowise supported by the proofs. (1) Where, as here, quo warranto proceeds against a 
corporation for a violation of the antitrust law, the information must charge the specific wrong-doing, and the proofs 
must show that which is thus specifically pleaded. State ex rel. v. Talbot, 123 Mo. 71; State ex rel. v. Grimm,  [***7]  
220 Mo. 490; State ex rel. v. Railroad, 240 Mo. 35; State ex rel. v. Railroad, 241 Mo. 11. If the evidence does not 
show the specific wrong-doing so alleged, there is not simply a variance but a complete failure of proof. Waldhier v. 
Railroad, 71 Mo. 514; Reed v. Bott, 100 Mo. 62; McManamee v. Railroad, 135 Mo. 440; Huston v. Tyler, 140 Mo. 
263; Chitty v. Railroad, 148 Mo. 75; Richardson v. Busch, 198 Mo. 174. (2) If a material fact be pleaded as 
unknown to the pleader, there is a complete failure of proof if it appear that such fact was either known or could 
have been discovered by the exercise of reasonable diligence. State v. Stowe, 132 Mo. 208; State v. Thompson, 
137 Mo. 623; State v. Moses, 139 Mo. 217; State v. Burke, 151 Mo. 145; State v. Nunley, 185 Mo. 109; Naftzger v. 
United States, 118 C. C. A., 200 Fed. 501. (3) The specific charge in the information was this: Respondents, not as 
passive instruments, but as active conspirators, with unknown parties, conspired to take over, own and control all 
the packing companies in Missouri and the United States, the names of which were unknown, and pursuant to the 
scheme the National Company acquired the stock and assets of corporations [***8]  whose names were likewise 
unknown. Both the proofs and the commissioner's report clearly showed: (a) There was never any purpose of 
obtaining control of all of such packing houses; (b) the alleged conspirators were Swift & Company, Armour & 
Company, Morris & Company and the companies actually acquired by the National Company, and (c) the names of 
these companies were actually disclosed at a preliminary hearing had under the statute (R. S. 1909, secs. 10332-
10338) by the Attorney-General to see whether there was any reason for filing the information. Moreover, if such 
examination did not disclose the facts in every detail, they could have been ascertained by his asking for the 
production of the officers and directors and the books and papers of the companies doing business in Missouri. (B) 
The proofs were insufficient to make a case. (1) The commissioner's mere conclusion, in the teeth of findings to the 
contrary and his statement that there was no direct evidence to that effect, was that respondents were in a 
combination with Swift & Company, Armour & Company and the National Company. (2) Such a conclusion cannot 
be warranted by strong suspicions or probabilities, but can only be drawn [***9]  upon a clear showing of (a) either a 
criminal intent to violate the law, or (b) a combination of such magnitude as to create a monopoly. State ex inf. v. 
Tobacco Co., 177 Mo. 37; United States v. Naval Stores Co., 172 Fed. 460; Bigelow v. Mining Co., 167 Fed. 709, 
94 C. C. A. 13. (3) Here, both the findings and proofs clearly show there was no monopoly, while the facts do not 
warrant a finding of bad intent. (4) There not being a monopoly guilt cannot be found from the size of the business 
unaccompanied by improper acts or oppressive methods towards competitors. United States v. Naval Stores Co., 
172 Fed. 458; Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 221 U.S. 1; Tobacco Co. v. United States, 221 U.S. 106; State ex 
inf. v. Harvester Co., 237 Mo. 394. (5) There was individual ownership of the stock of the National Company by G. 
F. Swift, J. O. Armour and Edward Morris, heads of Swift & Company, Armour & Company and Morris & Company. 
The National Company in turn owned the stock of respondents. From this alone the commissioner concluded not 
that there was any, but that there might be an abuse of the power flowing from such ownership, hence guilt. This 
was contrary to the law. State ex inf. v. [***10]  Tobacco Co., 117 Mo. 37; State ex inf. v. Standard Oil Co., 194 Mo. 
155, 218 Mo. 403; State ex inf. v. Railroad, 241 Mo. 1, 11; Bigelow v. Mining Co., 167 Fed. 721, 94 C. C. A. 13; U. 
S. v. Reading Co., 183 Fed. 427. (6) The proposed but abandoned consolidation of 1902 would have controlled not 
more than fifty-two per cent of the packing business. Its size alone, regardless of its abuse of its power, would not 
have made it illegal. United States v. Naval Stores Co., 172 Fed. 458; Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 221 U.S. 
1; Tobacco Co. v. United States, 221 U.S. 106; State ex inf. v. Harvester Co., 237 Mo. 369, 394. The plan having 
been abandoned, it was not evidence of a combination thereafter. U. S. v. Reading Co., 183 Fed. 427. (7) The 
conclusions of the commissioner are not only contrary to the proofs, but they are inconsistent with the specific facts 
found. (8) The claim of violation of law is too stale to warrant a prosecution. A State, by lapse of time, wholly 
irrespective of any Statute of Limitation, loses its right to proceed in quo warranto, not only as against municipal 
(State ex rel. v. Westport, 116 Mo. 582; People ex rel. v. Alturas Co., 6 Idaho, 418; State v. School [***11]  District, 
85 Minn. 230; Cooley, Const. Lim. [5 Ed.] 311), but also private corporations. State v. Carr, 112 C. C. A. 477, 191

In comprehensive terms the substance of the charge is: (1) That between 1898 and 1900 combinations were 
formed in various branches of the iron and steel trade, not as an incident of normal growth, but with the purpose 
and effect of unduly restricting competition, and that they still exist, contrary to the Anti-Trust Act of July 2, 1890.  
(2) That in 1901, by means of a holding company, these several illegal combinations, each dominant in its 
respective field, and other powerful units, were all brought together in one super-combination of overwhelming 
power,  [****5]  which, augmented by further acquisitions, still exists, unduly restricting competition in the iron and 
steel trade as a whole and in practically every important branch thereof, contrary to the same act of Congress. 
1 At the former hearing the case was argued by Mr. Solicitor General Davis, Mr. Assistant to the Attorney General Todd and Mr. 
Henry E. Colton, Special Assistant to the Attorney General.  Mr. Attorney General Gregory and Mr. Robert Szold also were on 
the brief, from which the argument is abstracted.

The several combinations formed during the period 1898-1900 greatly increased prices in almost every instance, 
especially the combinations affecting the lighter finished products, such as tubes, wire nails, tin plates, etc.  Prices 
of pig iron, semi-finished products and rails also were increased.  But notwithstanding the concentration of control in 
particular lines resulting from these combinations, competition was still able to make itself felt, taking the industry 
as [****6]  a whole, and as the year 1900 drew to a close was threatening to become very active, and, with the 
revival of active competition, prices, which had been enormously increased, underwent substantial declines.  Then 
was formed the present corporation -- a holding company, which controls the important acts and policies of the 
constituent combinations, and, among other things, generally determines the prices which they may charge for their 
finished products.  As the proposal for the super-combination began to take form, prices, which had receded with 
the revival of competition in the latter half of 1900, began to rise again.  The upward movement became marked as 
the organization of the combination was perfected.  While some have since fallen, these prices have nevertheless 
been maintained by the combination at a substantially higher level than prevailed during competitive periods prior to 
its formation. 
Except for the internal alterations and further acquisitions, which increased the control, the several combinations 
above described and the super-combination in which they were all united have continued down to the present time 
without change of substance.  Their proportion of the trade,  [****7]  whilst not quite so great as at first, is still 
overwhelmingly preponderant. 
Congress was moved to pass the Anti-Trust Act by two main considerations: (1) The desire to preserve the 
competitive system of industry.  (2) The conviction that that system was threatened by the undue concentration of 
commercial power resulting chiefly from the unrestricted exercise of the right of combination. 
Every combination which by its necessary effect or because of the character of the means employed threatens the 
normal operation of the law of competition, in other words, unduly restricts competition, is therefore within the 
purview of the act. 
It was not intended, however, to set a limit to the enlargement of a business by normal growth, the competitive 
system being in no danger from that quarter. 
The purpose of the parties is important in determining the question of normal growth, but, that out of the way, it is of 
no further consequence where the necessary effect of the combination is unduly to restrict competition. 
Except as throwing light on the purpose of the parties, it is immaterial how the combination is created, whether 
through simple agreement, through the old from of trust, through [****8]  a holding company, or through the actual 
purchase and consolidation of plants. 
Competition may be unduly restricted through voluntary combinations of competitive traders and trade units no less 
than by combinations to exclude one or more such from their right to trade. 
Whether restriction of competition through voluntary combinations is undue depends primarily upon the extent of 
the restriction.  Without attempting to draw the exact line, the restriction is certainly undue where the combination 
embraces units which together occupy a preponderant position in a given industry. 
What constitutes a preponderant position must be determined in the light of conditions in the particular branch of 
trade affected.  The principal factors to be considered are (1) the portion of the trade engrossed by the combination 
as compared with the portion possessed by each of its competitors as well as with the whole, and (2) the extent of 
the control, if any, acquired by the combination over raw materials or over the agencies of transportation and of 
distribution or over the reserve supply where the article of trade is one the supply of which is limited by nature. 
At the time they were combined under [****9]  the control of the United States Steel Corporation the American Steel 
& Wire Company, the American Tin Plate Company, the American Sheet Steel Company, the American Steel Hoop 
Company, the National Tube Company and the American Bridge Company were severally combinations in restraint 
of trade, each being a combination of formerly competitive units together occupying an overwhelmingly 
preponderant position in a distinct branch of the iron and steel trade and each having been organized for the 
purpose of suppressing competition and increasing prices.

It has never been doubted that combinations of this type, embracing a dominant proportion of those engaged in a 
particular industry and formed for the express purpose of suppressing competition between them, are combinations 
in restraint of trade.  Addyston Pipe Co. v. United States, 175 U.S. 211; Swift & Co. v. United States, 196 U.S. 375, 
394; Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. Park & Sons Co.; 220 U.S. 273, 408. Nor is it material, their purpose and effect being 
what they were, that the combinations here assailed were created in corporate form instead of by loose agreement.  
United States v. American Tobacco Co. [****10]  , 221 U.S. 106, 176, 181. Indeed, where, as here, corporations 
simply exchange their plants and businesses for stock in a consolidated corporation, the resulting combination is in 
no respect different in principle from a combination in the form of trust which the statute specifically prohibits.  
Northern Securities Co. v. United States, 193 U.S. 197, 326, 327; United States v. Reading Co., 226 U.S. 324, 352-
363; s.c. 183 Fed. Rep. 427, 470; Patterson v. United States, 222 Fed. Rep. 599, 619, 620 Noyes, Intercorporate 
Relations, § 354; Eddy, combinations, § 622.  Wherefore we submit that the illegality of these combinations is not 
merely debatable, as the defendants themselves admit as to some, but is conclusive as to all.  They were still 
occupying the illegal position thus acquired in various branches of the steel trade when united under the control of 
the United States Steel Corporation in 1901. 
The Steel Corporation is a combination in restraint of trade, because it is not the result of natural trade growth but is 
a mere instrumentality for combining competing corporations which together occupy an overwhelmingly 
preponderant position in trade and [****11]  commerce in iron and steel products generally.  The group of 
independent plants and businesses combined under on control through the corporation included the largest and 
most powerful competitors in practically every branch of the iron and steel industry in rails; plates; structural shapes; 
wire rods and wire products; hoops, bands, and cotton ties; skelp; wrought pipe and tubular goods; seamless tubes; 
bars; billets and sheet bars.  And not only were the competitors united under the control of the Corporation the 
largest and most powerful units in practically every branch of the iron and steel industry, but generally speaking 
they were splendidly grounded as regards the production of the basic products -- ore, pig iron, ingots.  This is 
sustained by the findings of Woolley and Hunt, JJ., in the court below and by the investigation made by the Bureau 
of Corporations. 
The preponderant position and the dominance of this combination is manifested by its capital as compared with that 
of competitors; its proportion of the total production; its proportion of the total production as compared with that of 
each of its principal competitors; its proportion of ore reserves; its control over [****12]  transportation of ore; its 
effect upon prices; concerted maintenance of prices under its leadership; and opinion evidence as to its power. 
Whilst in our view of the law a combination of able competitors occupying an overwhelmingly preponderant position 
in a given trade, such as the combination embodied in the Corporation, unduly restricts competition by its necessary 
effect, and therefore is unlawful regardless of purpose, nevertheless it is appropriate to show a wrongful purpose as 
a matter of aggravation.  It is elementary, of course, that the purposes of illegal combinations are seldom capable of 
proof by direct testimony, but must be inferred from circumstances.  Eastern States Retail Lumber Dealers' Assn. v. 
United States, 234 U.S. 600, 612; Reilley v. United States, 106 Fed. Rep. 896; United States v. Sacia, 2 Fed. Rep. 
754, 757; Regina v. Murphy, 8 C. & P. 397, 404. The considerations going to show that the controlling purpose of 
this super-combination was not the legitimate development of trade, but suppression of competition and exploitation 
of the public, are: the form of the combination -- a holding company not itself engaged in trade at [****13]  all; the 
union of so many competitors controlling so large a proportion of the trade; the general competitive situation, falling 
prices, etc., immediately before the formation of the combination; increase in prices immediately following formation 
of the combination; gross overcapitalization of the combination in anticipation of excessive profits; enormous 
promoters' profits; cancellation by the combination of contracts for extensions, etc., previously entered into by 
constituent companies; and subsequent acquisitions.  (See the findings of Woolley and Hunt, JJ., and of the bureau 
of Corporations.) 
We are dealing here with a combination of competitors in the truest sense and not with the mere purchase by one 
competitor of the business of another as an incident of normal development.  The distinction between a mere 
purchase of a competing business and a combination of competing businesses clothed in the form of purchases is 
sharply drawn in Shawnee Compress Co. v. Anderson, 209 U.S. 423. See Noyes, Intercorporate Relations, § 354.  
If the vast aggregation of competing businesses here involved occupying an overwhelmingly preponderant position 
in practically every branch of [****14]  the iron and steel industry had been combined by executory agreement or in 
251 U.S. 417, *417; 40 S. Ct. 293, **293; 64 L. Ed. 343, ***343; 1920 U.S. LEXIS 1630, ****9

 
the old form of trust there would be none to dispute the illegality of the transaction.  The legal situation is not 
changed by substituting a holding company as the instrument of combination.  The vesting in such a company of 
the capital stocks of a group of able competitors for the purpose of centralizing control is no more lawful, is no more 
a normal method of business development, than the similar centralization of control in common trustees under the 
old form of trust.  In such case, indeed, the holding company is but the old trust in corporate form.  Northern 
Securities Co. v. United States, supra; Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 221 U.S. 1; Temple Iron Co. v. United 
States, 226 U.S. 324; s. c.  183 Fed. Rep. 427. It is literally a case, therefore, of the stockholders of a group of 
competing corporations transferring the control of each into the hands of a committee of trustees -- a form of 
combination in restraint of trade which has ever been regarded as peculiarly obnoxious.  If competitors controlling 
half the trade not alone in one product or in two but in an entire series [****15]  of products constituting one of the 
grand divisions of industry may thus combine through a holding company, to what lengths can the process go 
without offending the law??  If one-half of the steel industry may be thus combined through one holding company, 
certainly those controlling the other half would have the right to combine through another holding company.  And of 
course if it be lawful to centralize control of the steel industry in two holding companies it would be equally lawful to 
centralize control of every other industry in two holding companies.  Such undue concentration of control over 
industry was the very evil which the act was intended to prevent.  United States v. Reading Co., 226 Fed. Rep. 229, 
272. 
The Corporation is also an instrumentality for uniting and enlarging the power of a group of combinations of 
competitive units in particular branches of the iron and steel trade, each in and of itself unlawful.  There is no 
likeness between this case and United States v. Winslow, 227 U.S. 202, 217. This case presents a parallel to the 
American Tobacco Case, supra, where there was a combination in restraint of trade not in cigarettes alone, nor in 
smoking [****16]  tobacco alone, nor in chewing tobacco alone, but in the whole tobacco industry. 
This is not a case where the purpose was ""integration."" Integration consists in combining supplementary, 
noncompetitive trade units.  An illustrative case is United States v. Winslow, supra. If, therefore, we were successful 
in showing that the corporations combined in this case through the holding company are either competitors 
themselves or illegal combinations of competitive businesses, the idea of integration is at once excluded. You can 
not centralize control of an entire industry by first separately combining competitors in the various branches thereof 
and then uniting them in one super-combination and hope to escape the prohibitions of the law by calling what was 
done ""integration."" Moreover, the units combined in 1901 through the Corporation were already, for the most part, 
highly integrated.  No one, of course, denies the advantage of concentrating under one management the various 
stages of steel manufacture from the ore mine to the finishing mill.  This can be done, however, and can be best 
done, just as economical size can be attained, without setting up in every branch of trade a combination [****17]  of 
competitors with power to exercise substantial dominance over the rest. 
The contention that a combination of such size and power was a necessary means to attain efficiency and to 
promote foreign trade is irrelevant in law.  It is but another way of saying that good intentions can save the 
combination from illegality.  Thomsen v. Cayser, 243 U.S. 66; United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Assn., 166 
U.S. 290, 341; Addyston Pipe Co. v. United States, 175 U.S. 211, 234, 243; Swift & Co. v. United States, 196 U.S. 
375, 396. The intent to violate the law implied from doing what the law prohibits renders immaterial every other 
intent, purpose, or motive. Bishop, New Criminal Law, § 343; Holmes, The Common Law, p. 52.  Applying this 
principle, this court from the very beginning has held that a contract or combination by its own ""inherent nature or 
effect,"" without more may ""restrain trade within the purview of the statute."" Any other construction would require 
courts to decide not only whether a given combination prevents the existence of effective competition or constitutes 
a virtual monopoly, but whether in their opinion monopoly would not be, on the [****18]  whole, a better policy than 
competition -- i.e., would compel them to act on frankly legislative grounds.  Park & Sons Co. v. Hartman, 153 Fed. 
Rep. 24, 46. Congress rightly believed that the advantages of large business units, in so far as they are real and 
substantial, would inevitably assert themselves by normal growth.  It closed the short cut to those advantages -- 
monopolistic combination -- because danger lies that way.  ""If there is evil in this it is accepted as less than that 
which may result from the unification of interest, and the power such unification gives."" National Cotton Oil Co. v. 
Texas, 197 U.S. 115, 129. ""Competition is worth more to society than it costs."" Vegelahn v. Guntner, 167 
Massachusetts, 92, 106. Furtheremore, even if it would have been lawful for the many independent businesses 
251 U.S. 417, *417; 40 S. Ct. 293, **293; 64 L. Ed. 343, ***343; 1920 U.S. LEXIS 1630, ****14

 
combined through this holding company to unite to some extent to develop foreign trade -- by joint selling agencies, 
for example -- that can not justify the complete and permanent suppression of competition between them in 
domestic trade.  United States v. Corn Products Refining Co., 234 Fed. Rep. 964, 1016; United States v. Union 
Pacific  [****19]   R. R. Co., 226 U.S. 61, 93. 
The contention that such was the purpose is also unfounded in fact. 
As for the contention that competition has increased while the combination's proportion of the trade has decreased, 
it is true that as regards the proportion of the trade in steel products possessed by the combination there has been 
some decline from the highwater mark reached shortly after its formation, but there has been no such decline as to 
curtail the power of the combination. 
It is rather the usual thing in such cases for the combination to be able to show some relative decline in its 
proportion of the trade.  It was so held with the Standard Oil Company and with the American Tobacco Company.  
In fact, it is so uniformly the case as to excite the suspicion that combinations of this character, having found they 
can dominate the trade with a smaller proportion of it than they started with, voluntarily yield a part in the belief that 
they thereby put themselves in a better position to face the law.  But be this as it may, where, as here, the decline 
still leaves the combination in an overwhelmingly preponderant position, it is of no legal consequence whatever.  In 
such a case [****20]  the original vice persists and the combination is a ""continually operating force,"" restraining 
trade within the meaning of the first section of the act, Standard Oil Co. v. United States, supra; United States v. 
Union Pacific R. R. Co., 226 U.S. 61, 96; United States v. Kissel, 218 U.S. 601; and a ""perennial violation of the 
second section"" prohibiting monopoly, Standard Oil Co. v. United States, supra, 74; Patterson v. United States, 222 
Fed. Rep. 599, 625; United States v. Corn Products Refining Co., 234 Fed. Rep. 964, 1018. 
The present bill charges a combination to suppress competition between the parties to the combination themselves.  
In such a case the only question is whether the combination embraces competitors in sufficient number and of 
sufficient importance to make the resulting restriction of competition a substantial or undue restriction.  Whether 
such a combination is also attempting to hinder the competition of those outside the combination is of no weight 
except as a matter of aggravation. 
The contention that the combination is not unlawful because its power though great is yet not great enough to 
enable it alone to [****21]  fix and maintain prices would require a combination of competitors to amount to a 
monopoly to fall within the prohibition.  This theory was rejected by this court in the first case under the Anti-Trust 
Act which came before it.  United States v. E. C.Knight Co., 156 U.S. 1, 16. To the same effect is the language of 
Mr. Justice Day, then a circuit judge, in Chesapeake & Ohio Fuel Co. v. United States, 115 Fed. Rep. 610, 624. 
Furthermore, neither the circumstance that the Corporation combined with competitors to maintain the higher prices 
established by the combinations whose stocks it acquired, nor that in ten years while increasing its trade 
enormously its relative proportion suffered a small decline, justifies the inference that the Corporation could not 
have maintained the higher prices by the exertion of its own power alone.  It would be a strange result if the 
combination of competitors embodied in the Corporation should escape condemnation because of their illegal 
conduct in agreeing upon prices with outside manufacturers. 
The contention that the case must fail because the combinations have not increased prices, or limited production, or 
degraded the [****22]  quality of product, or decreased wages, or decreased the price of raw materials, or 
oppressed competitors, loses sight of the broader policy of the act, which was, not to wait until the evils enumerated 
are already upon us, but to prevent their occurrence by striking at their underlying cause -- undue concentration of 
commercial power through the process of combination.  The test of the legality of a combination, therefore, is not its 
present effect upon prices, wages, etc., nor its present conduct toward the remaining competitors, but its effect 
upon competition.  If its effect is unduly to restrict competition, then it is immaterial that for the time being the 
combination may exercise its power benevolently.  This defense of good conduct has been interposed in many 
cases of this character, and as many times rejected.  Nor is forbearance by a combination from the exercise of its 
power to drive the remaining competitors from the field, or to prevent new ones from entering, on any different 
footing from good conduct of any other sort.  The cases make no such distinction.  Obviously, where a combination 
takes in so large a proportion of the competitors or competitive units that effective [****23]  competition no longer 
251 U.S. 417, *417; 40 S. Ct. 293, **293; 64 L. Ed. 343, ***343; 1920 U.S. LEXIS 1630, ****18

 
exists, it can be no defense to say that the combination is doing nothing to prevent the restoration of competitive 
conditions. 
This contention is based on a construction of the law impracticable in execution. 
Mr. Richard V. Lindabury, Mr. David A. Reed and Mr. Cordenio A. Severance, with whom Mr. Raynal C. Bolling was 
on the brief, for United States Steel Corporation et al., appellees, cited and discussed the following, as revealing 
what the Anti-Trust Act means by ""restraint of trade"": Senator Hoar, Autobiography of Seventy Years, vol. II, p. 364; 
United States v. Du Pont De Nemours & Co., 188 Fed. Rep. 127, 150; United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight 
Assn., 166 U.S. 290; Gibbs v. Baltimore Gas Co., 130 U.S. 396, 408; Northern Securities Co. v. United States, 193 
U.S. 197, 337, 361; Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 221 U.S. 1, 58, 60, 61; United States v. American Tobacco 
Co., 221 U.S. 106, 179; United States v. Terminal Railroad Assn., 224 U.S. 383, 394; Nash v. United States, 229 
U.S. 373, 376. 
Whether, or to what extent, the Standard Oil and Tobacco Cases modify the [****24]  rule laid down by Mr. Justice 
Peckham in the Freight Association Case as applicable to public service corporations is not of account in the 
present case.  That they do make a distinction between restraint of competition and restraint of trade in the case of 
private trading and manufacturing companies, and do hold that as to such companies the restraint of competition in 
order to amount to restraint of trade must be undue or unreasonable, is entirely clear, and is recognized in the 
subsequent cases.  These cases also hold, as pointed out by Judge Lanning in the Du Pont Case, that whether the 
restraint of competition in the case of such companies amounts to restraint of trade must be determined upon the 
facts and circumstances of each particular case. 
Applying these principles, the direct and necessary effect of the organization of the Steel Corporation was neither to 
restrain trade nor create a monopoly, viewed either from the standpoint of competition suppressed or from that of 
the extent of control acquired over production or raw materials.  Swift & Co. v. United States, 196 U.S. 375; United 
States v. Standard Oil Co., 173 Fed. Rep. 177, 183; United States [****25]  v. American Tobacco Co., 164 Fed. 
Rep. 700, 719; 221 U.S. 157, 182; United States v. Reading Co., 226 U.S. 324, 370. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing cases, the Govenment insists that, as a matter of law, the suppression of competition 
is undue whenever the combination controls units which together occupy a preponderant position in a given 
industry, and this without regard to the intentions of those who form it or the after conduct of the combination.  We 
submit that no such test is warranted either by the language of the Anti-Trust Act or by the decisions of this court.  
Whether restraint is unreasonable, and therefore undue, is declared in United States v. Terminal Railroad Assn., 
supra, to depend upon three things: (1) the extent of such control; (2) the method by which such control was 
brought about; and (3) the manner in which such control has been exercised.  This is but a formulation of the rule 
laid down in the Tobacco Case. But we submit that a priori reasoning as to the direct or necessary effect of the 
organization of the Steel Corporation or as to the result produced by its preponderant position in the industry, if it 
has such a position, is uncalled [****26]  for in the present case.  When the evidence in the case was closed, 
thirteen years of the active life of the Corporation had passed. If restraint of trade or monopoly necessarily resulted 
from its formation or from its so-called preponderant position in the industry, evidence of such restraint or monopoly 
would appear somewhere in its history; and if such evidence does not appear, it is reasonably safe to conclude that 
no such result inhered in its organization or position.  That the organization did not so result at any time or as to any 
article of steel production, is, we submit, conclusively shown by the testimony in the case, as pointed out in both 
opinions of the court below.  And not only is this shown by the testimony, but it is also shown that the Corporation 
never acquired the power either to monopolize or to restrain trade.  And this too was found by all the judges of the 
court below. 
No intent to monopolize or to restrain trade is shown by the circumstances which led up to and surrounded the 
organization of the Corporation.  The organization was but a natural and normal development from existing trade 
and manufacturing conditions and was only notable because of the largeness [****27]  of the conception which 
underlay it and the courage exhibited in undertaking to carry it out.  But ability to think large and courage to execute 
251 U.S. 417, *417; 40 S. Ct. 293, **293; 64 L. Ed. 343, ***343; 1920 U.S. LEXIS 1630, ****23

 
the thought are not condemned by the law.  Indeed, the future prosperity of our country must depend in large 
measure upon the encouragement given to these attributes of the American business man. 
Nor is an intent to monopolize or restrain trade evinced by the after-conduct of the Corporation.  Throughout its 
whole career the Corporation has pursued the objects declared by its founders at the time of its formation, 
decreasing the cost of production, increasing wages, decreasing prices, and greatly extending trade in steel 
products both at home and abroad.  Its treatment of both competitors and consumers has been fair and just; it has 
neither attempted to oppress the one nor to coerce the other.  The few plants which it has purchased were offered 
to it, and with a single exception they were purchased only because they were needed in the development of the 
Corporation's business.  That exception was the plant of the Tennessee Company, and this was purchased with the 
approval of the Government for the purpose of preventing the spread of a dangerous [****28]  financial panic.  
Instead of promoting pools and combinations, the Corporation destroyed them as early as 1904.  Although the 
manufacturers met together from time to time after the breaking up of the pools, they went no further at their 
meetings than to mutually exchange information and make declarations of purpose which the petition admits they 
had a lawful right to do.  The Gary dinner movement amounted to nothing more than an endeavor to prevent 
reckless price-cutting and general demoralization at a time of great industrial peril, and this was sought to be 
accomplished simply by an appeal to reason and the establishment of a relation of mutual respect and confidence, 
by which it was hoped to secure open and fair dealing and prevent the misunderstandings out of which nearly all 
the trade wars of the past had grown.  Instead of monopolizing the manufacture of steel, the Corporation's 
percentage of the country's production has steadily decreased; instead of monopolizing the supply of ore, the 
Corporation has confined its purchases to two or three localities, and in the locality where its holdings are largest it 
has relatively less than many of its competitors and less than its own [****29]  experts and the experts of its 
competitors testify that it ought to have.  We respectfully submit that by this record the Corporation has proved the 
bona fides of the claim made for it at the time of its organization, that its purpose was the development of a great 
business along legitimate and permissible lines, and not monopoly or restraint of trade.  If, however, the 
circumstances surrounding the organization left the matter of intent in doubt to be established by the after-conduct 
of the parties, we now have such after-conduct extending over the long period of thirteen years, and we submit that 
it completely rebuts any presumption (if any there was) of intent to restrain trade or to acquire a monopoly, and as 
completely establishes the contrary intent. 
Whatever, therefore, may have been the purpose or immediate effect of the organization of the Steel Corporation, it 
goes for nothing unless it be found that at the time the petition was filed the Corporation was offending or 
threatening to offend against the Anti-Trust Act.  This results from the fact that the action is brought under the third 
section of that act which authorizes the Attorney General to institute proceedings [****30]  in equity to prevent or 
restrain violations of the act.  The appeal is to the injunctive power of the court which is never exercised to redress 
alleged wrongs which have been committed already, but only to restrain those which are still existing or are 
threatened.  High on Injunctions, § 23; Pomeroy's Equitable Remedies, vol. I, § 262. 
The Corporation had no monopoly and was not restraining trade when the petition was filed, nor was it threatening 
to acquire a monopoly or to restrain trade.  It has not the power to do either. 
We insist that the acquisition of a preponderant position in a trade or manufacture (whether this means size or 
power) without unlawful intent and without excluding practices, does not constitute restraint of trade or monopoly 
either at common law or under the Federal Anti-Trust Act when no actual monopoly or actual restraint of trade 
results therefrom.  How could it?  Size in itself is nothing as we have already shown.  And power to do wrong 
cannot be confounded with wrongdoing itself without leading to hopeless confusion.  We are dealing with a criminal 
statute.  If the acquisition of power to violate a statute is the equivalent of its violation, then [****31]  all men are 
guilty, for all have acquired the power to violate not one but many statutes.  In the opinions in some of the railroad 
cases ( United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Assn., 166 U.S. 290, 334; Northern Securities Co. v. United States, 
193 U.S. 197, 373; United States v. Union Pacific R.R. Co., 226 U.S. 61, 88) are to be found expressions to the 
effect that it is the scope of combinations of the kind there under consideration and the power to suppress 
competition and create monopoly which results therefrom that determines the applicability of the Anti-Trust Act. In 
those cases, however, the corporations combining were under a duty to compete, and any substantial suppression 
of competition between them was, therefore, illegal -- the scope of the combinations (i. e., what they embraced) 
251 U.S. 417, *417; 40 S. Ct. 293, **293; 64 L. Ed. 343, ***343; 1920 U.S. LEXIS 1630, ****27

 
alone determining their illegality.  No such rule has ever been applied to private trading or manufacturing 
companies, and this for the obvious reason that such companies are under no duty to compete.  Meredith v. 
N.J.Zinc & Iron Co., 55 N.J. Eq. 212, 221. In the Tobacco Case the combination was condemned because the court 
thought the conclusion of wrongful [****32]  purposes and illegal combination was overwhelmingly established by 
the circumstances surrounding the organization and the after-conduct of the company, showing an ever present 
intent to drive competitors out of the field and to monopolize the tobacco trade.  Nothing, we submit, could be more 
unreasonable than to condemn every corporation, without regard to its purposes or practices, which happens to 
exceed in size or trade power any other competitor in the field.  A rule which would lead to that result, instead of 
protecting commerce -- which was the object of the Anti-Trust Act -- would tend to throttle and destroy it by driving 
or keeping out of the competitive field all but the incompetents and inefficients. 
 International Harvester Co. v. Missouri, 234 U.S. 199, was decided under the Missouri statute which prohibited any 
combination that lessened or tended to lessen competition. 
The elimination of competition between the units combined by the Steel Corporation did not amount to an undue 
restriction of competition in the steel trade and so produce a restraint thereof.

been reasonable, not excessive, ""monopoly"" prices. 
There are in the case three charges: alleged violation of the commodities clause; alleged monopoly in the Schuylkill 
region; alleged combination in restraint of trade resulting in the Reading's purchase of control of the Jersey Central. 
The tests to be applied to determine whether the Reading Railway Company is violating the commodities clause in 
transporting coal owned by the Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Company at the time of transportation are those 
laid down in United States v. Lehigh Valley R.R. Co., 220 U.S. 257, and United States v. Delaware, Lackawanna & 
Western R.R.  [****9]   Co., 238 U.S. 516. These tests are also buttressed by the court's declaration of the general 
object of the statute to have been to put an end to the carrier's ""opportunity to discriminate in favor of itself against 
other shippers in the rate charged, the facility furnished or the quality of the service rendered."" Delaware, 
Lackawanna & Western R.R. Co. v. United States, 231 U.S. 363. 
The court is not concerned with the question of who ultimately receives the profit from the sale of the commodity, 
because it has repeatedly held that the carrier might legally own all of the stock of the corporation which owned the 
commodity at the time of transportation and thereby receive all the profits from the sale of the same.  United States 
v. Delaware & Hudson Co., 213 U.S. 366, 413, 414. 
Furthermore, this court, recognizing the fact that in the legislative progress of the commodities clause in the Senate, 
where it originated, an amendment in specific terms providing that the enactment should embrace common 
ownership of stock in railroad companies and coal companies by the same stockholders, was rejected (40 Cong. 
Rec., pt. 7, pp. 7011-7014), has also unequivocally held that [****10]  such common ownership ""cannot be used as 
a test by which to determine the legality of the transportation of such [a coal] company's coal by the interstate 
carrier."" United States v. Delaware, Lackawanna & Western R.R. Co., 238 U.S. 516, 526. 
The Reading Companies were in existence long prior to the time the commodities clause went into effect -- two of 
them for 37 years and the third for 12 years.  The Reading Railway has never had any title to coal lands, has never 
undertaken any mining operations and has never been engaged in merchandising coal; and the Reading Railway 
and the Reading Coal Company have never been parties to any sales agency contract of the kind condemned in 
the Lackawanna Case. These factors, which are the converse of those presented in the Lackawanna Case, 
differentiate the two cases completely. 
The present state of the law places upon the Government the burden of showing, by a preponderance of the proof, 
that the affairs of the Railway Company and the Coal Company have been so commingled and the distinctions 
between them so obliterated, as to disregard the fact that they were separate juridical beings; cause them to be one 
and inseparable,  [****11]  making their affairs indistinguishable; destroy the entity of the Coal Company; and make 
it a mere puppet subject to the control of the Railway Company and a mere department thereof. 
The origin of the holding of the capital stocks of the Coal Company and the Railway Company by the Reading 
Company cannot be treated as a ""mere subterfuge and sham to defeat the commodities clause."" The lower court 
was correct in finding that the reorganization was carried out with scrupulous regard for the law, in entire good faith, 
and without subterfuge or sham.  It was right in its conclusion that the validity of the charter powers of the Reading 
Companies cannot be impeached; that their right to exist cannot be denied; that complete legislative authority to do 
the acts they have done cannot be gainsaid, and never has been questioned by the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania, and that the charters of the three companies gave the undoubted right to issue the securities and 
make the conveyances described. 
The ownership of railroad equipment by the Reading Company and the lease thereof to the Railway Company have 
not been shown to have resulted in giving the latter as a corporation, for its own corporate [****12]  purposes, 
253 U.S. 26, *26; 40 S. Ct. 425, **425; 64 L. Ed. 760, ***760; 1920 U.S. LEXIS 1488, ****7

 
""complete power over the affairs of the Coal Company, as if the Coal Company were a mere department of the 
railroad."" 
The purchase money mortgage of the Railway Company scrupulously observes the fact that the Railway Company 
and the Reading Company are separate juridical beings and in no manner commingles the affairs of the Railway 
and Coal Companies so as to cause both such corporations to be one for all purposes. 
The general mortgage of the Reading Company does not obliterate the distinctions between the Railway Company 
and the Coal Company and cause them to be one and inseparable. 
The Government's evidence and arguments on the extent to which the Coal Company and the Railway Company 
have officers and offices in common are largely iteration in the past tense of conditions existing more than a decade 
ago, not only prior to this court's illuminating decision in 1911 in United States v. Lehigh Valley R.R. Co., 220 U.S. 
257, but even before the commodities clause itself went into effect on May 1, 1908.  That evidence is clearly 
immaterial and irrelevant as to conditions now existing.  Equitable decrees normally speak in the present tense and 
are applied to remedy [****13]  existing evils and not to characterize or condemn past wrongs.  Even in an action 
under the Sherman Act an opportunity might well be afforded for a locus poenitentioe.  United States v. Lehigh 
Valley R.R. Co., 225 Fed. Rep. 399, 403, 404. 
The foregoing facts fully justified the court below in finding that there was a bona fide separate administration of the 
affairs of the Coal Company.  United States v. Lehigh Valley R.R. Co., 220 U.S. 257, 274. 
Attention is directed to the fact that the two companies employ the same counsel and treasurer, and also have the 
majority of directors in common.  Probably no two employees of modern industrial organizations could do less 
toward the commingling of the administrative and other affairs of two corporations than the counsel and the 
treasurer.  These incidents are of minor importance and do not affect the question of whether the businesses of the 
companies are rendered indistinguishable.  That was an issue of fact and the record conclusively establishes that 
no such result has followed from the joint employment of these two individuals.  It is repeatedly shown that the 
funds and accounts of the two companies are scrupulously [****14]  kept distinct, and there is no evidence whatever 
of a commingling of the affairs of the two corporations by their counsel. 
The proof of the complete autonomy of the Coal Company and the Railway Company was uncontroverted, and 
conclusive.  An excellent summary of the salient features of the testimony appears in Judge McPherson's opinion 
below. 
In view of the entire autonomy of the three Reading Companies, there is no ground for the contention that the 
Railway Company is transporting in interstate commerce anthracite coal mined or produced by it, or under its 
authority, or which it owns in whole or in part, or in which it has any interest, direct, or indirect. 
As to the alleged monopoly in the Schuylkill Region: 
The Government does not raise the issue as to whether the Coal Company in and of itself is a combination in 
restraint of interstate commerce or a monopolization thereof.  That company was created May 18, 1871, and by its 
charter it was lawful for any railroad company existing under the laws of the State to subscribe for or purchase its 
stock, or to purchase or guarantee its bonds.  The corporation then owning the Reading Railroad properties 
immediately purchased all the [****15]  stock of the Coal Company.  The latter then immediately set about the 
purchase and lease of coal lands, acquiring 80,000 acres before the end of 1872.  By the year 1881 the Coal 
Company controlled 98,500 acres of coal land (or slightly in excess of the acreage alleged in the petition).  Shortly 
afterwards, in 1885, the stockholders deliberately adopted a policy opposed to all further acquisition.  Thus on the 
government theory the close relations alleged to exist between the mining and transportation properties and their 
owners have existed for almost half a century (or 20 years before the passage of the Anti-Trust Act); and the Coal 
Company's title to its present holdings of coal lands was vested in it almost 40 years ago, or 9 years antecedent to 
the passage of that act.  The mining and marketing of coal on the one hand and its transportation on the other are 
not competitive businesses.  The court below, with these factors before it, dismissed the petition in respect of this 
branch of the case, and this court, on its precedents, we believe, will affirm this action because it holds ""the 
disintegration aimed at by the statute does not extend to reducing all manufacture to isolated [****16]  units of the 
253 U.S. 26, *26; 40 S. Ct. 425, **425; 64 L. Ed. 760, ***760; 1920 U.S. LEXIS 1488, ****12

 
lowest degree.  The combination was not unlawful so far as it did no more than put the different groups of non-
competing [enterprises] into one control."" United States v. Winslow, 227 U.S. 202, 217, 218. 
The Government does not contend that the Coal Company is an unlawful combination or a monopoly, and it cannot 
be contended that the transportation is competitive with the mining and marketing; the transportation is intermediate 
between the two and supplements them. 
This court, like the court below, will be repelled by the consequences of holding with the Government's contentions.  
United States v. United Shoe Machinery Co., 247 U.S. 32, 45, 46. 
There was no secrecy indicating a guilty plan or conspiracy.  It was all done pursuant to notices to investors all over 
the world, in the open, and to meet the financial exigencies of the situation.  The plan was adopted by Edward M. 
Paxson, the receiver, who had just resigned as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and the writer 
of that court's decision in Commonwealth v. New York, Lake Erie & Western R.R. Co., 132 Pa. St. 591. The 
resulting reorganization was declared valid by the [****17]  Attorney General of the Commonwealth, January 2, 
1897.  The legality of the plan was approved by eleven eminent counsel.  The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, by 
its statutory policy from 1818, had declared to be normal, and affirmatively encouraged, the close inter-relation of 
mining, transporting and selling anthracite coal.  (Const. 1874, Art. XVII, § 5, adopted in convention, of which Judge 
Dallas was a member.) It was approved by Judge Dallas and Judge Acheson, of the Circuit Court for the Eastern 
District of Pennsylvania, contemporaneously with the reorganization.  It was regarded as entirely legal by Judges 
Gray, Lanning and Buffington ten years later.  United States v. Reading Co., 183 Fed. Rep. 427, 457, 459, 490. It 
was declared to be lawful by Judges McPherson, Hunt and Buffington twenty years later.  United States v. Reading 
Co., 226 Fed. Rep. 229, 266-276. 
The facts do not indicate monopoly or combination in restraint of trade.  The Coal Company is not charged with 
such guilt.  It produces less than 15 per cent. of tonnage.  In the Schuylkill region it has 35 operations and one-half 
the tonnage.  Other producers have 53.  On the Reading Railway it does [****18]  not monopolize production or 
sales.  Of production it has only 65 per cent.  In sales it must compete with 116 other shippers on 8 other railroads 
and 60,000,000 tons of competitive tonnage because the Pennsylvania Railroad reaches every community reached 
by the Reading Railway and makes joint rates with every other anthracite railroad.  At tidewater and all distant 
points it meets the competition of the entire production.  The court below unanimously supports the foregoing 
conclusion.  226 Fed. Rep. 270-271. 
The Reading Railway cannot be treated as a monopoly.  Its transportation status in the Schuylkill region has been 
practically the same for 50 years.  The Government alleges no acquisition of other carriers there since 1870.  Its 
share of total anthracite transportation is less than 19 per cent; the Lehigh Valley Railroad's is greater.  It does not 
monopolize the Schuylkill region.  It serves 63 collieries, 11,500,000 tons; other railroads serve 34 collieries, 
7,000,000 tons.  It does not monopolize the collieries it serves.  Built in 1833, it has the natural advantages of a 
pioneer -- occupation of passes, and possession of best grades.  It serves the region admirably.  It 
encounters [****19]  the competition of the total tonnage in all markets as does the Coal Company. 
The Reading Company is not a monopoly or combination in restraint of trade.  It merely coordinates and integrates 
the non-competitive and complementary businesses of mining, transporting and merchandising anthracite coal, 
thereby promoting and stimulating interstate trade and commerce.  No vice exists in including transportation, 
because its chief competitors enjoy a like advantage, and government regulations preclude abuse in employing 
transportation facilities. 
There is no basis for the decree requested by the Government, tearing down an investment of $ 300,000,000, made 
originally 50 years ago, when the titles vested, and upon the stability of which investors have justifiably relied for a 
generation, -- authorized by state statutes, approved by state officers and courts, reorganized under supervision of 
federal courts 23 years ago, and approved unanimously by circuit judges in 1915. 
The purchase of the Jersey Central stock was a normal industrial development -- a defensive measure with no 
intent to unduly suppress competition. 
253 U.S. 26, *26; 40 S. Ct. 425, **425; 64 L. Ed. 760, ***760; 1920 U.S. LEXIS 1488, ****16

 
The railroads combined were not competing in the sense of Mr. Justice [****20]  Day's definition in the Union Pacific 
Case.  One was never striving for traffic which the other was seeking to gain.  226 U.S. 87. They did not render 
service to the same shipper, id. 87, nor cater to demands of identical patrons.  Id. 88. They were not engaged in the 
same carrying trade from the same point of origin to the same destination.  Id. 99. They were, on the contrary, 
complementary and supplementary, one to the other, in the sense described in this court's opinion respecting the 
form of decree permitting the combination of the Union Pacific and Central Pacific.  If, as a fact, they are thus 
supplementary the Government concedes the propriety of their combination. 
Even if the Government's theory, that the two roads are competitive because both transport anthracite, be indulged; 
nevertheless their unification was valid because ""the extent of the control thereby secured over instrumentalities 
which commerce is under compulsion to use,"" under the tests laid down in United States v. St. Louis Terminal, 224 
U.S. 383, 394, 395, ""left the competitive conditions in the coal carrying business very slightly affected by the 
elimination of competition between [****21]  the Central and the Philadelphia and Reading."" 183 Fed. Rep. 488, 
490. 
The Government's theory of competition is unsound.  It makes all carriers competitive, and is contrary to the 
settlement in the Union Pacific Case. Its theory of competition is impossible of application.  No court can discover 
the necessary directness of relationship of cause and effect to enable it to say that the abatement of competition of 
such an intangible character necessarily results in a case of unlawful restraint.  This impossibility arises from the 
factors of uncertainty, speculation and remoteness, illustrated by the extent of competition of anthracite coal with 
other fuels; by the situation in the New England market, where 70,000,000 tons are in potential competition, and 
there are numerous uncontrolled rail and water routes, the Reading handling only 3 1/2 per cent. of the potential 
supply; and by similar conditions at New York and elsewhere -- even on the Reading Railway itself. 
But even according to the government theory, competition was unaffected.  The Central did not reach the Reading 
territory, and competition was continued by eight other lines in close proximity to the Central and Reading.  [****22]  
See 183 Fed. Rep. 457, 488, 490. The vital question is not the amount of competition suppressed, but the amount 
remaining.  If, as here, the competitors remaining are numerous, large, and powerful the restriction of competition 
cannot be deemed undue.  The issue is one of fact and not of law and must be decided on the evidence, not on 
theory or speculation.  The evidence covering the period since 1901 when this combination was formed shows the 
facts to be that the Reading's powerful competitors have increased their anthracite traffic by much greater 
percentages than has the Reading; that any diminution of the Reading's service to the public or attempted restraint 
on interstate trade would be frustrated immediately by the preponderant competitive power of its eight powerful 
rivals; that the public has been benefited for any loss of competition resulting from the combination by the more 
than compensating advantage derived from the upbuilding of the half dozen through routes for freight and 
passenger traffic competing with the Pennsylvania Railroad.  This court would not be justified in destroying these 
routes and their advantage to the public merely to guard against a speculative possibility [****23]  of injury which the 
evidence shows cannot ensue.  In view of its decision in the St. Louis Terminal Case, this court should hold the 
lower court's view of the evidence, -- considering the lessons of the war as to what restrains trade, the joint 
operation of railroads, and the provisions of impending railroad legislation. 
As for the Coal Companies, the Reading Company's influence over the Wilkes-Barre Company was only incidental 
and negligible.  There is no evidence of a motive to control production.  Competition was practically unaffected, and 
the management of the two companies was not amalgamated. 
The Reading Company did not create a monopoly or combination in restraint of the anthracite trade in 1901.  The 
trade as a whole has expanded; the number of employees, their employment and earnings have increased; and 
production has kept pace with population. 
The Reading did not acquire in 1901 sufficient power to monopolize or restrain the trade had it sought to do so.  
The combined business of the two coal companies was then only one-fourth of the total business, and in the interim 
has shrunk until now it is only one-fifth.  It does not now possess the power to monopolize or [****24]  restrain the 
trade even if it wished to do so. 
253 U.S. 26, *26; 40 S. Ct. 425, **425; 64 L. Ed. 760, ***760; 1920 U.S. LEXIS 1488, ****19

 
If the Government's most extravagant contention had been sustained by proof, their criticism of the coal land 
holdings makes no case presently calling for the interposition of the action of this court.  It will be time enough to 
destroy such a monopoly when it appears and when it has gained power to injure the public.  Now the court should 
deal only with the present actualities.  By the time that such a monopoly arises, if it ever does, it may be that the 
public policy will foster it, or we may have a nationalization of all mines. 
Finally, the Government's contentions now are inconsistent with its attitude in the Harvester Case.  On November 2, 
1918, the Department of Justice consented to a decree in that case in and by which, in order to ""restore competitive 
conditions and bring about a situation in harmony with law,"" the company was only required to sell such of its lines 
of harvesting machines as would leave it at least 66 per cent. of the industry."

Defendants are voluntary associations and corporations engaged upon a vast scale, involving the investment of 
millions of dollars, in the business of providing, by the transportation from State to State of baseball teams and their 
necessary attendants and equipment, exhibitions of professional baseball.  The court is not concerned with whether 
the mere playing of baseball, that is the act of the individual player, upon a baseball field in a particular city, is by 
itself interstate commerce.  That act, it is true, is related to the business of the defendants, but it can no more be 
said to be the business than can any other single act in any other business forming a part of interstate commerce. 
The question with which the court is here concerned is whether the business in which the defendants were engaged 
when the wrongs complained of occurred, taken as an entirety, was interstate commerce, or more accurately, 
whether the monopoly which they had established or attempted to establish was a monopoly of any part of 
interstate commerce. 
At the foundation of the business of one of these leagues -- in its primary conception -- is a circuit embracing seven 
different [****3]  States.  No single club in that circuit could operate without the other members of the circuit, and 
accordingly in the very beginning of its business the matter of interstate relationship is not only important but 
predominant and indispensable. 
Each game symbolizes a contest of skill between the two cities that have been brought together by means of 
interstate communication and travel.  Each team of each club in the league carries with it, and it is essential to the 
profit of the enterprise that it should carry with it, its representative character; it symbolizes the great city that it 
represents to those assembled to witness the contest. 
259 U.S. 200, *200; 42 S. Ct. 465, **465; 66 L. Ed. 898, ***898; 1922 U.S. LEXIS 2475, ****1

 
In addition to this representative city and state aspect, there is also the element of intersectional rivalry.  Experience 
has shown that the game is most largely patronized when clubs are so located as to provide a contest for 
supremacy between the Eastern and Western sections of the country. 
It is necessary to distinguish between baseball as a sport, that is, where it is played merely as a means of physical 
exercise and diversion, and this business of providing exhibitions of professional baseball.  The business of 
Organized Baseball represents [****4]  and has represented for many years, an investment of colossal wealth.  
Defendants who dominate Organized Baseball are not engaged in a sport.They are engaged in a money-making 
business enterprise in which all of the features of any large commercial undertaking are to be found.When the 
teams of the National or American Leagues or of any other league are sent around the circuit of the league, they go 
at the direction of employers whose business it is to send them, and whose profits are made as a result of that 
business operation. 
When the profit-making aspect of the business is examined, it will be found that the interstate element is still further 
magnified.  The vast investment of capital which has been made in it is required, among other things, in ofder to 
provide a place at which the teams in the league may play their contests.  Each club has a ball park, with stands 
erected upon them, sometimes, as in the case of a major league club, costing several millions of dollars.  Every 
club in the league earns its profit not only by the drawing capacity of its team at home, but also by that of the teams 
of the clubs which its team visits in the various cities in the league.  The gate [****5]  receipts in all of the cities in 
which the clubs are located are divided according to a definite proportion, fixed by agreement between the club of 
the city in which the game is played and the club employing the visiting team. 
In no other business that can now be recalled is there such a close interrelationship and interdependence between 
persons in one State and persons in another.  The personality, so to speak, of each club in a league is actually 
projected over state lines and becomes mingled with that of the clubs in all the other States.  The continuous 
interstate activity of each is essential to all the others.  The clubs of each league constitute a business unit 
embracing territorially a number of different States.  While each club has, of course, a local legal habitat, yet from a 
practical business standpoint it is primarily an ambulatory organization. 
It is difficult to perceive the relevancy of any discussion about an article of commerce in this case.  Commerce may 
be carried on in one of its forms by traffic in articles of merchandise, but there are countless forms in which it may 
be carried on without traffic in such articles.  Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 189. 
It is [****6]  also difficult to discern the relevancy of the contention that personal effort is not an article of commerce.  
Personal effort, while it may not be an article of commerce, is often commerce itself, but we are not concerned with 
any such question here.  It may be passed by saying taht it has been adjudicated by this court in the Hoke Case, 
227 U.S. 308, that interstate commerce may be created by the mere act of a person in allowing himself to be 
transported from one State to another, without any personal effort; and further that it is very difficult to see how 
International Textbook Co. v. Pigg, 217 U.S. 91, could have been decided as it was, except upon the principle that 
the mere exchange of instruction and information, which is about as purely a matter of personal effort as anything 
that can be imagined, may be a subject of interstate commerce. 
If transactions in interstate commerce were to be judged by their isolated ultimate results, as the defendants seek to 
separate the act of a player in throwing a ball upon a ball field from all the steps which are taken to bring the ball 
player in the due course of business from other States, of course their interstate character could be [****7]  
plausibly argued away.  By such a process of reasoning the American Tobacco Company, for instance, might have 
removed its gigantic monopoly from the operation of the Sherman Act.  See United States v. American Tobacco 
Co., 221 U.S. 106, 184; Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 221 U.S. 1, 68; Swift & Co v. United States, 196 U.S. 
375. 
In the business now under consideration throughout the playing season the ball teams, their attendants and 
paraphernalia, are in constant revolution around a preestablished circuit.  Their movement is only interrupted to the 
extent of permitting exhibitions of baseball to be given in the various cities.  When exhibitions in one city are 
completed the clubs resume, according to the agreement made, and plan of business long established, their course 
of travel on to another city, and thus on and on until the schedule of exhibitions is completed.  The interruption in 
259 U.S. 200, *200; 42 S. Ct. 465, **465; 66 L. Ed. 898, ***898; 1922 U.S. LEXIS 2475, ****3

 
interstate movement is nothing like as great as that in the Swift Case, supra. The constant movement of the teams 
from State to State during a period of over five months each year, is under a single direction and control and in 
pursuance of one object. 
See Champion v. Ames, 188 U.S. 321; Pensacola [****8]  Telegraph Co. v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 96 U.S. 
1; United States v. Patten, 226 U.S. 525; Loewe v. Lawlor, 208 U.S. 274; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Foster, 
247 U.S. 105. See particularly Marienelli v. United Booking Offices, 227 Fed. 165, where the question was 
presented as to whether a company engaged in booking vaudeville performers for a circuit embracing theatres in 
cities in different States was engaged in interstate commerce within the Sherman Act.  Also, Motion Picture Patents 
Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co., 235 Fed. 401. 
It is common knowledge that baseball is the preeminent American sport.  Millions of people follow the daily reports 
of the results of the games in the press, and in the large cities gather in the afternoons around the newspaper 
offices to see the bulletin reports of the scores.  Not only so, but vast numbers of people travel from one city to 
another for the purpose of witnessing the games.  Telegraph facilities are installed at all the ball parks in the Major 
Leagues, and in those of the more important Minor Leagues, where reports of the games are sent out and are 
received throughout the country. 
Each league contracts for a uniform type of baseball,  [****9]  which is used in tremendous numbers and shipped by 
the manufacturer from time to time as they are needed by the various clubs. 
These incidents, while in themselves not determinative of the question of whether or not the business is interstate in 
character, yet, when considered in connection with its main features, emphasize the truth of what has before been 
said, that there is scarcely any business which can be named in which the element of interstate commerce is as 
predominant as that in which defendants are engaged. 
The agreement and combination entered into and maintained by defendants whereby the entire business in the 
United States of providing exhibitions of professional baseball was brought under the control of defendants and 
their confederates in Organized Baseball, amounted in law to a conspiracy in restraint of trade among the several 
States and a monopoly or an attempt to monopolize a part of commerce among the several States within the 
meaning of the Sherman Act. 
There is no testimony in this case legally sufficient to show that the plaintiff has waived its right to recover damages 
under the Sherman Act. 
Mr. George Wharton Pepper, with whom Mr. Benjamin S. Minor [****10]  and Mr. Samuel M. Clement, Jr., were on 
the brief, for defendants in error. 
Organized Baseball is not interstate commerce and does not constitute an attempt to monopolize within the 
Sherman Act. 
Personal effort, not related to production, is not a subject of commerce; and the attempt to secure all the skilled 
service needed for professional baseball contests is not an attempt to monopolize commerce or any part of it.  
Clayton Act, § 6; Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168; Hooper v. California, 155 U.S. 648; Metropolitan Opera Co. v. 
Hammerstein, 147 N.Y.S. 532; In re Duff, 4 Fed. 519; In re Oriental Society, 104 Fed. 975; People v. Klaw, 106 
N.Y.S. 341. The Department of Justice has ruled that the business conducted by Organized Baseball was not in 
violation of the Sherman Act; and also that the business of presenting theatrical entertainments is not commerce.  
Distinguishing: International Textbook Co. v. Pigg, 217 U.S. 91; and Marienelli v. United Booking Offices, 227 Fed. 
165. The only case in which the question whether Organized Baseball is within the Sherman Act has been directly 
passed upon is that of American Baseball Club of Chicago v. Chase, 149 N.Y.S. 6; in which the court [****11]  
answered the question in the negative. 
Congress has not imposed a penalty upon the transportation of players for baseball purposes, and therefore Hoke 
v. United States, 227 U.S. 308, is not point.  While Congress may regulate the movement of persons in interstate 
commerce, when it has not regulated movement as such, the doing of an act essentially local is not converted into 
an interstate act merely because people came from another State to do it.

Pending the trial of an action, the court has power, upon such terms as may be just, to permit a second amended 
complaint to be filed, which embodies substantially the same allegations as the original complaint. ( Riverside Land 
Co. v. Jensen, 73 Cal. 550, 15 P. 131.)
Where the facts stated in the complaint constitute a sufficient cause of action, other unnecessary matter may be 
stricken, but an entire pleading cannot be stricken out as irrelevant or redundant. ( Benedict v. Dake, 6 How. Pr. (N. 
Y.) 352; Jackson v. Lebar, 53 Cal. 255.)
C.S., secs. 2531 and 2532, describe the scope of the act, and this action being for damages to the plaintiff by 
reason of the violation of the act by the defendant, it is only necessary to support an action under the act that 
complainant's business or property has in some way been injured by reason of defendant's illegal scheme. ( 
Monarch Tobacco Co. v. American Tobacco Co., 165 F. 774.)

 
Plaintiff [***2]  must be given liberal latitude under the act. ( Ware Kreamer Tobacco Co. v. American Tobacco Co., 
178 F. 117; Buckeye Powder Co. v. Dupont Powder Co., 196 F. 514.)
The contracts, combinations, etc., in restraint of trade or commerce which are declared to be illegal by the act, 
include all contracts, etc., operating to restrain trade or commerce whether legal or illegal at common law or 
whether the restraint is reasonable or unreasonable. ( United States v. Trans-Missouri F. Assn., 166 U.S. 290, 17 S. 
Ct. 540, 41 L. Ed. 1007, and note; United States v. United States Steel Co., 223 F. 55.)
The system and scheme established and put in force by the defendants controlled the entire issue of stock in the 
Monumental Mercury Mining Company, and is necessarily a general restraint of trade in the stock of said 
corporation and therefore illegal. ( Oliver v. Gidmore, 52 F. 562; Miles Medical Co. v. John Parks & Son, 220 U.S. 
373, 31 S. Ct. 376, 55 L. Ed. 502.)
The second amended complaint stated a cause of action under the law and the court had no right to strike it from 
the files by reason of any pleading, motion or suggestions made by the respondents. They not having filed a 
demurrer,  [***3]  the complaint to be had must be wholly insufficient; if to any extent, on any reasonable theory, it 
presents facts sufficient to justify a recovery, it will be sustained. (21 R. C. L. 466.)
S. L. Tipton and Gustave Kroeger, for Respondents.
The pooling of stock is not unlawful. ( Weber v. Della Mountain Mining Co., 14 Idaho 404, 94 P. 441.)
Under the anti-trust act it is not sufficient to frame the declaration in the words of the statute, but it is essential that 
the substance of the contract in restraint of trade or the substantial facts which constitute the attempt to monopolize 
should be set forth therein. ( Cilley v. United Shoe Machine Co., 152 F. 726.)
Under the statute, in order to recover damages, a plaintiff must have been injured in his person or property and the 
injury sustained must be charged in the complaint by proper averment. ( Meeker v. Lehigh Valley R. Co., 162 F.

The question raised is whether the contract as sued on was ""In violation of the provisions of chapter 88 and chapter 
119 of the Laws of Mississippi, 1908, on trusts and combines, and particularly in violation of sections 3281-3283, 
Hemingway's Code as contrary to the public policy of the state of Mississippi.""
I. The appellant's contention is that the contract here sued on is in violation of the provisions of the Anti-Trust 
Statutes, as shown by the terms of said contract, and expressed in the following language: ""The quantity of 'Royal 
Cement' mentioned on the reverse side hereof is sold and delivered for use in the work described, and if buyer shall 
sell or otherwise dispose of any portion of said cement, or use any portion thereof in any work other than that 
described, or assign this contract or any part thereof, or fail to comply with the terms of payment, or any of the 
conditions and limitations of this contract, or if the [***2]  buyer's credit becomes impaired, then in any such event or 
events, seller may, at his option, decline to make further deliveries hereunder, buyer remaining liable for all unpaid 
accounts.""
If such a contract as this is not in restraint of trade; if it does not hinder and prevent the selling and exchanging of 
personal property, or an article or commodity of trade that is in every day use, and in this day a necessary and 
indispensable article of commerce, we are at a loss to understand what kind of an agreement or contract would be 
in restraint of trade. If said contract, we submit in candor and frankness, is not for the fixing, maintaining and 
restricting of prices unlawfully and arbitrarily, we cannot conceive of one that would be. 24 R. C. L., sec. 655, page 
364; McCall v. Pearson-May-Pberschmidt Co., 107 Miss. 865, 66 So. 274; McCall v. Hughes, 102 Miss. 375, 59 So. 
794, 42 L. R. A. (N. S.) 63.
So far as we have been able to find there is an unbroken line of decisions from Coke, cited above, to this day, both 
in England and this country, that any attempted restriction as to the use of personal property bought and paid for, 
will not be recognized by the court, unless it [***3]  be with reference to some particular item or article of personal 
property of which the intrinsic value thereof is not the real consideration, but refers specifically to heirlooms and 
articles akin to them. Elijah & Winne v. Mottinger, 142 N.W. 1030, 161 Iowa 361; Brown v. Staple Cotton Co-Op.

85 Miss. 528, 37 So. 942.
Under the common law and the expressed terms of the statute and under the decisions cited above, as to the 
construction and applicability, it is manifest that the contract here sued on is within the rule as announced by the 
common law, and in violation of the anti-trust statute. It is in violation of each of the sub-divisions of the statute 
enumerated in the demurrer. It is in restraint of trade in that it requires the public work to be constructed with but 
one specified brand of cement, furnished by a specified person and from a specified manufacturer, and prohibits the 
appellant from procuring cement of equal quality from other sources than through the buyer, the appellee herein, 
even though the shipper, the Dixie-Portland Cement Company, could [***4]  not supply same according to the 
requirements of appellant, whereby the public work would suffer and the business of the county and the appellant. 
As further authorities on this point, see Universal Film Co. v. Copperman, 218 F. 577, and Waltham Watch Co. v. 
Keene, 212 F. 225.
II. It is stipulated in the contract that the cement should be furnished by the Dixie Portland Cement Company, 
subject to contingencies of manufacturing and shipping and other causes beyond control of shipper and seller, and 
cement to be delivered as nearly as practicable to meet the necessities of the work upon reasonable notice of time 
for deliveries; and that shipments are to be at ""the market price of Royal cement at the date of shipment."" ""But not 
higher than the price named therein;"" that prices quoted are ""based on freight rates in effect on date of quotation 
and are subject to revision if freight rates are changed.""
In Hart v. Gardner, 74 Miss. 153, 20 So. 877, it is stated that the purpose of all rules of construction is to effect the 
intention of the parties to the instrument. In Wall v. DeJet, 76 Miss. 104, 23 So. 437, it is held that it is the duty of 
the court in construing a contract to [***5]  place itself in the situation of the parties at the time the contract was 
made, and to ascertain their intention from the contract, in the light of the situation and looking also to the subject-
matter. See also Pratt v. Canton Cotton Oil Co., 51 Miss. 470; Tufts v. Greenwald, 66 Miss. 360, 6 So. 156.
Manifestly the intention of the parties was that the market price of the cement to be shipped under the contract 
would be such as would prevail at the plant of the Dixie Portland Cement Company, the point of shipment, plus 
freight to the point of delivery. It is in the testimony and undisputed that the price of Royal Cement in New Orleans, 
La., at the time that appellant refused to accept cement from the appellee, was two dollars and eighty-two cents per 
barrel, and that said cement was shipped from the point of manufacture, a point near Chattanooga, Tenn., to New 
Orleans, by way of the Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co., through the very points or by the very stations where three 
dollars and thirty cents and later three dollars and twenty cents per barrel was demanded.
It is further shown by the undisputed testimony of the appellant that he did go into the open market and buy [***6]  
cement of a quality and grade equal to the Royal Cement for the price of two dollars and eighty-two cents per 
barrel, delivered at the points called for in the contract, and that the price of two dollars and eighty-two cents which 
the appellant paid for the cement delivered to him at points mentioned in the contract here sued on was the same 
price that prevailed at New Orleans, for the cement. 16 Cyc. 1143. See Paxton v. Myer, Weis & Company, 58 Miss. 
445.
If, however, we should be in error in our contention that ""market price"" in this case is price at the manufactory plus 
freight to the point of delivery, then we earnestly beg to submit that the determination of ""market price"" of Royal 
Cement at points of delivery is not to be settled by the arbitrary fiat of the Dixie Portland Cement Company to its 
exclusive dealer, Delmas, but by what was its market value. That is to say, when ""market price"" is not discoverable 
by proof of free sales of the commodity in the open market, then its ""market value,"" if discoverable, becomes its 
""market price."" See especially McGarry v. Superior Portland Cement Company, et al. (1917), 95 Wash. 412, 163 P. 
928, American and English Annotated Cases,  [***7]  Vo. 1918A, p. 578 and note. This case holds that justice can 
be done only by interpreting the phrase. in this contract, ""market price,"" by its true meaning, which is ""market 
value,"" the facts of the case considered.
It is our contention, therefore, that the term ""market price"" used in the Delmas-Gano contract was not in the 
intention of the parties and cannot be held in law, a price such as the manufacturers chose to maintain at the points 
140 Miss. 323, *323; 105 So. 535, **535; 1925 Miss. LEXIS 265, ***3

 
mentioned in the contract, under a contract already made by his exclusive dealer, and with which the manufacturer 
was familiar; but was intended by the parties, and will be held in law, to be the price such as that quality of cement 
could actually be purchased and delivered for. This view is fully sustained by a note to the foregoing case, in Ann. 
Cas. 1918 A at 575.
We now sum up our contentions, as follows: The demurrer should have been sustained, holding that the contract 
was in restraint of trade in violation of the statutes of Mississippi and the Sherman Anti-Trust Law; or the contract 
had been breached by the plaintiff in that he refused to reduce the price of Royal Cement to keep pace with the 
reduction of cements of similar quality.  [***8]  Wherefore, we submit that the judgment of the lower court should be 
reversed, and this case dismissed.
White & Ford, for appellee.
The question presented is whether Delmas is entitled to recover profits he would have made had the contract been 
carried out. The proof fixed it at ten cents per barrel. The authorities generally hold that profits may be recovered 
where definite. Delta, etc., v. Yazoo, etc., 105 Miss. 861; Ice Company v. Holliday, 106 Miss. 714; Stevenson v. 
Morris, 69 Miss. 234.
While our friends on the other side have cited no case holding or tending to hold that Delmas' contract with Gano 
would have been met by his furnishing cement other than Royal, yet that was one of the principal contentions in the 
court below, and out of an abundance of precaution, we cite a few cases showing the fallacy of this contention. 
Shackelford v. Sloss Iron & Steel Co., 36 So. 1005, 140 Ala. 329; Daggy v. Cox, 19 Ind. 142; Hiatt v. Harris, 28 Ind. 
379; King v. City of Rochester, 38 A. 256, 67 N. H. 310; Lowry v. Cooper, 21 Ind. 269; Clark v. Wright, 5 Phila. 432.
Looking at the contract to get the intention of the parties as to what market price was contemplated, 
manifestly [***9]  market price at points of delivery was intended. There is nothing whatever in the contract to 
warrant the conclusion that New Orleans price was thought of. Furthermore, Gano knew how and where Delmas 
was to get his supply of cement, because the contract between them gave notice that Delmas had a contract with 
the Dixie Portland Cement Company for the furnishing of the contract supply, and this contract is also in evidence. 
The law on market price in a case of this sort is clear, and the following may be noted: Gray Harbor v. Turnbull, 163 
Ill. App. 231; Pugh v. Porter & Co., 50 P. 772; Parish & Co. v. Y. & M. V. R. R. Co., 103 Miss. 288.
Applying the reasoning of the above cases to the facts here, we find that in the testimony of Delmas that Royal 
cement was sold at Pascagoula to other persons other than Gano at the same price that Gano was charged, and, 
furthermore, that this commodity was largely used at Pascagoula, other cements having been sold there, as well as 
Royal. Manifestly, the New Orleans price was not thought of, as it is not mentioned in the contract. Even if Delmas 
had sought to obtain his supply of Royal cement in New Orleans, the proof is that it would have cost [***10]  him 
about two dollars and eighty-two cents plus forty cents freight to Pascagoula, and this would have been in line with 
the price that Gano charged. It follows from the foregoing, we submit, that Delmas' right to recover was abundantly 
clear. The contract must be enforced as the parties made it.
Defendant complains of what he conceives to be monopolistic or trust features of the contract. While there has 
been much loose talk about the provisions of the state and federal anti-trust laws, fortunately the courts have set at 
rest some of the leading phases of the subject. The authorities generally hold that a contract is not invalidated, 
which is in reasonable restraint of trade. In Houck v. Wright, 77 Miss. 476, this court held that a wholesaler can 
confine his sale of goods to one dealer in any given territory, and not thereby violate the antitrust law. The Dixie 
Portland Cement Company had the right to select Delmas as its exclusive dealer in Jackson county territory, 
according to that decision. In Telephone Co. v. State, 100 Miss. 102, the court held: ""That contracts in reasonable 
restraint of trade are valid, and are not void unless unreasonable and inimical to public welfare.  [***11]  ""
The same is held in Brown v. Staple Cotton Oil Co., 132 Miss. 859. The supreme court of the United States has 
frequently passed on this anti-trust question. While authorities might be multiplied, the following cases dispose of 
the contentions made by appellant in this regard: United States v. Colgate & Co., 63 L. Ed. 993; United States v. 
Schrader, 64 L. Ed. 471; R. R. v. Pullman Car Co., 35 L. Ed. 97, 139 U.S. Sup. Court Rep. 79.
140 Miss. 323, *323; 105 So. 535, **535; 1925 Miss. LEXIS 265, ***7

 
In Cotton Oil Co. v. State, 121 Miss. 615, the court held that it was not unlawful for a ginning company to attempt to 
destroy competition by putting the price of ginning cotton below the actual cost. There is nothing invalid about the
