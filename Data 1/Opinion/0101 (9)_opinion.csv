189,Counsel,"Counsel: Sanford Robert Shapiro and Warren B. Rosenbaum for appellant.  I. The application of the minimum fee 
schedule may not avoid a test of ""reasonability"" in determining a lawyer's compensation.  ( Matter of Levy, 19 A D 
2d 413; Matter of Snell, 17 A D 2d 490; Matter of Robinson, 202 Misc. 231; Burnett v. Graves, 230 F. 2d 49, 351 
U.S.  984.) II. Primary reliance on a minimum fee schedule is per se unreasonable where direct testimony as to 
services is available.  ( Matter of Martin, 21 A D 2d 646, 16 N Y 2d 594; Matter of Young, 52 Misc 2d 398.) III.  
Section 340 of the General Business Law (Donnelly Act) applies to pricing practices in the furnishing [****4]  of legal 
services.  ( Maxine Gerard, Inc. v. May & Co., 51 Misc 2d 711, 27 A D 2d 922; Manhattan Stor. & Warehouse Co. v. 

 
Movers' & Warehousemen's Assn., 262 App. Div.  332, 289 N. Y. 82; State of New York v. Milk Handlers & 
Processors Assn., 52 Misc 2d 658.) IV. The Monroe County Bar Association's ""minimum fee schedule"" is a 
regulated arrangement under the Donnelly Act.  ( Matter of Davies, 168 N. Y. 89; People v. Epstean, 102 Misc. 476; 
Purofied Down Prods. Corp. v. National Assn. of Bedding Mfrs., 201 Misc. 149; Pleaters, Stitchers & Embroiderers 
Assn. v. Jaffe Pleating Co., 176 Misc. 411; New York Clothing Mfrs.' Exch. v. Textile Furnishers Assn., 238 App. 
Div. 444; People v. Sheldon, 139 N. Y. 251; Alexander's Dept. Store v. Orhbach's, 266 App. Div. 535; Straus v. 
American Publishers' Assn., 85 App. Div. 446, 177 N. Y. 473; People v. Masiello, 177 Misc. 608.) V. The effect of 
the Monroe County Bar Association's minimum fee schedule is to unreasonably fix, establish, stabilize and maintain 
price levels for legal services in all of Monroe County.  ( Barns v. Dairymen's League Co-op. Assn [****5]  ., 220 
App. Div. 624.) VI. The consumer beneficient policy of the Donnelly Act empowers the court to determine whether 
computation of legal fees pursuant to a minimum fee schedule is illegal.  VII. The Bar's exclusive franchise to 
render legal services to the public impresses it with a public trust that the courts must closely supervise to protect 
the public interest.  ( Whitaker v. Kilby, 55 Misc. 337, 122 App. Div. 895.) VIII. The fee in the instant case, computed 
by use of the minmum fee schedule, is unreasonable per se and should not be allowed.
Luther Ira Webster for respondent.  I. The ""reasonableness"" of the fee of respondent's counsel was a question of 
fact.  ( Matter of Sewell, 32 Misc. 604; Matter of Potts, 213 App. Div. 59, 241 N. Y. 593; Matter of Brehm, 37 A D 2d 
95; Matter of Lipsit, 21 A D 2d 509, 15 N Y 2d 588; Matter of Wheeler, 25 Misc 2d 933; Matter of Krasner, 12 Misc 
2d 814; Matter of Smith, 4 Misc 2d 620; Matter of Krooss, 200 Misc. 1003; Matter of Mackenzie, 155 Misc. 822.) II. 
It is the policy of this State to establish schedules for commissions of fiduciaries.  ( Matter of Burroughs, 155 Misc. 
237; Matter of  [****6]   Lester, 172 App.  Div. 509.) III. The interpretation of section 340 of the General Business 
Law is for the courts of this State.  ( New York Bank Note Co. v. Hamilton Bank Note Engraving & Print. Co., 180 N. 
Y. 280; Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 355 F. Supp. 491; People ex rel. Rice v. Graves, 242 App.  Div. 128; 
Johnston v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 242 N. Y.  381; People ex rel. Central Park, North & East Riv. R. 
R. Co. v. Wilcox, 194 N. Y. 383; American Med. Assn. v. United States, 317 U.S.  519; United States v. Real Estate 
Bds., 339 U.S. 485; United States v. Oregon Med. Soc., 343 U.S. 326; Barns v. Dairymen's League Co-op.  Assn., 
220 App. Div. 624; State of New York v. Milk Handlers & Processors Assn., 52 Misc 2d 658, 28 A D 2d 971.) IV. 
There is no proof of injury to the public.  ( McAvoy v. Harron, 26 A D 2d 452.)
Michael J. Beyma, Elliott Horton and Alan Illig for Monroe County Bar Association, amicus curiae.  I. The legality of 
fee schedules is not in issue in the present controversy.  ( Matter of Gilman, 251 N. Y.  265; Matter of Lewis, 278 
App. Div. 888,  [****7]  308 N. Y. 795; Hannahs v. Hannahs, 68 N. Y. 610; Matter of Snell, 33 Misc 2d 1044, 17 A D 
2d 490; Matter of Richards, 5 A D 2d 124; Matter of De Graff, Foy, Conway & Holt-Harris v. McKesson & Robbins, 
31 N Y 2d 862.) II. The law is a noble and ancient profession, the members of which are subject in all aspects of 
their conduct and ethics to regulation by the courts.  ( Matter of Rouss, 221 N. Y. 81; Matter of New York County 
Lawyers' Assn. v. Dacey, 28 A D 2d 161, 21 N Y 2d 694; Lavanant v. Lovelace, 71 Misc 2d 974; Matter of Cohen, 9 
A D 2d 436; Matter of Cooper, 22 N. Y. 67; Erie County Water Auth. v. Western N. Y. Water Co., 304 N. Y. 342; 
Matter of Flannery, 212 N. Y. 610; Matter of Percy, 36 N. Y. 651; Matter of Ushkow, 34 A D 2d 159; Matter of 
Hughes, 35 A D 2d 440.) III. The absence of Bar Association fee schedules might lead to solicitation of clients 
which could be harmful to the legal profession and the public generally.  ( Matter of Clark, 184 N. Y. 222; Matter of 
Anonymous, 32 A D 2d 37; Matter of Connelly, 18 A D 2d 466; Matter of Pouker, 203 App. Div. 520; People v. 
Meola [****8]  , 193 App. Div. 487; People v. Schneider, 20 A D 2d 408; People ex rel. Karlin v. Culkin, 248 N. Y. 
465.) IV. The Donnelly Act applies to the regulation of trade and of services related to trade while the Judiciary Act 
applies to the conduct of lawyers; each is exclusive of the other.  ( Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 355 F. Supp. 491; 
Matter of Carey v. Cruise, 246 N. Y. 237; New York Clothing Mfrs.' Exch. v. Textile Finishers Assn., 238 App. Div. 
444; Emmons v. Smitt, 58 F. Supp. 869; Hillside Housing Corp. v. Eisenberger, 173 Misc. 75; Matter of New York 
County Lawyers Assn. [Roel], 4 Misc 2d 721; Rozell v. Rozell, 281 N. Y. 106; People v. Banks, 168 Misc. 515.) V. 
Antitrust laws do not apply to fees which are determined by a court.  ( Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657; 
Eastern R. R. Conference v. Noerr Motors, 365 U.S. 127; Schenley Ind. v. N. J. Wine & Spirit Wholesalers Assn., 
272 F. Supp.  872; California Transp. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508; Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341.) VI. 
Numerous Legislatures and courts have found Bar Association fee schedules [****9]  to be in the public interest.  ( 

 
Matter of Snell, 33 Misc 2d 1044, 17 A D 2d 490; Matter of O'Donnell, 28 Misc 2d 1040; Matter of Robinson, 202 
Misc. 231; Matter of Lewi, 199 Misc. 99; Matter of Felton, 199 Misc. 507.) VII. Bar Association fee schedules are an 
indispensable aid to attorneys in determining customary charges so that a particular fee is not exorbitant.  ( Matter 
of Snell, 17 A D 2d 490; Gair v. Peck, 6 N Y 2d 97.) VIII. Bar Association fee schedules generally discourage unduly 
high charges and provide a standard against which unreasonably high charges may be recognized, challenged and 
corrected.  ( Matter of McCullough, 14 Misc 2d 769, 10 A D 2d 634, 9 N Y 2d 993.) IX. Legal services performed for 
an estate are of a similar nature to the services rendered by fiduciaries whose fees are uniformly set as a 
percentage of estate assets.  ( Matter of Snell, 33 Misc 2d 1044, 17 A D 2d 490.) X. The Sherman Act similarly 
should not be considered applicable to the conduct of lawyers.  ( Citizen Pub. Co. v. United States, 394 U.S. 131; 
United States v. General Motors, 384 U.S. 127; Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. United States [****10]  , 356 U.S. 1; 
United States v. United States Steel Corp., 233 F. Supp. 148; United States v. Container Corp., 393 U.S. 333; 
United States v. Socony Mobil Oil Co., 356 U.S. 925; Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341; Washington Brewers Inst. v. 
United States, 137 F. 2d 964.)"
