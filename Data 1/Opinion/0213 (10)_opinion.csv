 658 ,Counsel    ,"Counsel:
                  . . . promptly pursuant to bills submitted periodically . . . for all reasonable advanced costs, including but not
                  limited to, service fees, filing fees, deposition expenses, reproduction costs, travel, restaurant and lodging
                  expense, fees of experts and the costs and expenses [**30]  of any associated counsel, and similar costs
                  which are reasonably necessary for the effective prosecution of Arizona's claims.
                  It appears that in many instances expense claims were not presented promptly and/or periodically.  Prompt
                  presentation of claims is an indication that the claims are reasonable and that the client would be expected to make
                  reimbursement without disagreement.  On the other hand, there is a natural tendency to delay claim submissions
                  which are excessive or which may meet client resistance.
                  (7) Time limitations imposed by the client or circumstances. This factor does not have particular relevance in this
                  case.
                  (8) The amount involved and the results obtained.
                  Here again, the parties are in serious disagreement.  The State's contention is fulsomely stated in Special
                  Counsel's Memorandum of November 16, 1982, pg. 19:
                  It is no overstatement or exaggeration to say that in the present case counsel overcame overwhelming odds to
                  accomplish an extremely difficult task and that the result of this victory will work a fundamental change in an
                  industry representing 10 percent of our gross national product.  The injunction will save consumers tens of
                  millions [**31]  of dollars annually.
                  Defendants respond that ""the only tangible 'success' plaintiff will have achieved is  [*1274]  the elimination of a
                  desirable and cost-effective health care insurance alternative."" Defendants also contest Special Counsel's
                  assertions that this action ""introduc[ed] competition into a major section of the economy that had previously been
                  characterized by cartels and monopolistic practices.""
                  I believe the answer to this particular guideline is dictated by the position taken by the U.S. Supreme Court:
                  The impact of the foundation fee schedule on medical fees and on insurance premiums is a matter of dispute.
                  The State of Arizona contends that the periodic upward revisions of the maximum fee schedules have the
                  effect of stabilizing and enhancing the level of actual charges by physicians, and that the increasing level of
                  their fees in turn increases insurance premiums.  The foundations, on the other hand, argue that the schedules
                  impose a meaningful limit on physicians' charges, and that the advance agreement by the doctors to accept the
                  maxima enables the insurance carriers to limit and to calculate more efficiently the risks they underwrite and
                  therefore [**32]  serves as an effective cost containment mechanism that has saved patients and insurers
                  millions of dollars.  Although the Attorneys General of 40 different States, as well as the Solicitor General of the
                  578 F. Supp. 1262, *1273; 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20198, **28
                  
                  
                  United States and certain organizations representing consumers of medical services, have filed amicus curiae
                  briefs supporting the State of Arizona's position on the merits, we must assume that the respondents' view of
                  the genuine issues of fact is correct.
                  102 S. Ct. at 2472.
                  The Supreme Court recognized that its acceptance of the per se rule did not constitute a determination that the
                  business practices at issue were unreasonable:
                  The costs of judging business practices under the rule of reason, however, have been reduced by the
                  recognition of per se rules.  Once experience with a particular kind of restraint enables the Court to predict with
                  confidence that the rule of reason will condemn it, it has applied a conclusive presumption that the restraint is
                  unreasonable.  As in every rule of general application, the match between the presumed and the actual is
                  imperfect.  For the sake of business certainty and litigation efficiency, we have tolerated the invalidation [**33]
                  of some agreements that a fullblown inquiry might have proved to be reasonable.
                  102 S. Ct. at 2473.
                  If the injunction entered in this case will save consumers ""tens of millions of dollars annually"", the practices enjoined
                  must have been costing the public to the same extent.  The way is open for any concerned entity -- including the
                  State of Arizona -- to file a damage action and thus resolve this contention.  If successful, the (plaintiffs) and
                  counsel would then be compensated from the common fund developed through that action and their efforts on
                  behalf of the public. 4
                  (9) The experience, reputation and ability of attorneys. Defendants [**34]  agree that the services of plaintiff's
                  counsel were of the ""highest caliber"".  They argue, however, that allowing hourly rates in the range requested by
                  plaintiff's counsel is sufficient recognition of their skill and expertise.
                  In my opinion, the hourly rates which I have approved for each counsel fully compensate them for their expertise in
                  the antitrust area.  These rates are also more than adequate to compensate them based on their experience,
                  reputation and ability as attorneys in this community.
                  (10) The ""undesirability"" of the case. Again, this does not seem to be a decisive guideline. The Attorney General
                  determined to file the action under statutory authority.  The complaint did not seek a  [*1275]  damage award.  Reed
                  was the Antitrust Division Chief when the case was filed.
                  There is no evidence that the prosecution of other antitrust actions was delayed or suffered as a result of the filing
                  of this action.
                  (11) The nature and length of the professional relations with the client. This guideline only involves Reed.  He was a
                  member of the Attorney General's staff for a number of years.  When he left that office and went into private
                  practice, he was awarded [**35]  a contract to handle this case as special counsel.  Several of the individuals with
                  Reed's firm had previously been with the Attorney General's office.
                  Reed had an ongoing relationship with the Attorney General's office after November, 1980 in other cases.  He has
                  appeared as Special Counsel for the State in at least two other antitrust cases.  In re Cement and Concrete
                  Antitrust Litigation, Civ 78-271-72; In re Arizona Escrow Fee Antitrust Litigation, Cic 80-840A.  Both of these cases
                  were filed while he was a member of the Attorney General's staff and were progressing while he was involved in the
                  instant case.  He has received fee awards in the two named cases out of settlement funds.  The Cement case is
                  now scheduled for trial in April, 1984.
                  4  The $1.8 million dollar monthly damage figure Plaintiff seeks to utilize was not developed by Defendants.  Rather, it originated
                  with Plaintiff in its Motion filed January 12, 1979 to Vacate or Modify Stay Order of December 27, 1978.  (Document 74, p. 17)
                  Maricopa Foundation later referred to Plaintiff's calculation as ""grossly inflated"".  (Document 103, p.6).
                  578 F. Supp. 1262, *1274; 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20198, **32
                  
                  
                  (12) Awards in other cases. It is difficult to draw any overall conclusions as to the totality of an award to be made in
                  a particular case, by looking at awards in other cases.  The circumstances of cases differ widely.  The variables
                  include, among others, issues, extent of discovery, court appearances, the time period over which the case
                  extended, the number of individuals involved and their functions in the proceeding,  [**36]  results obtained, total
                  hours claimed, hourly rates and whether the award was made in an adversarial situation.
                  I have considered other awards in this district in fixing the hourly rates for attorneys and paralegals in this
                  proceeding.
                  I have also reviewed the innumerable cases called to my attention through memoranda.  There is something for
                  everyone in those cases.  The final award in those cases was a discretionary judgment, just as mine will be in this
                  instance.  An adherence to the Moore requirements should provide a reasonable award in each individual case,
                  with appellate court review available to a dissatisfied claimant.
                  Special Counsel cites a fee order (Settlement Order No. 6) in In re Arizona Escrow Fee Antitrust Litigation, Civ. No.
                  80-840A, in support of its claim as to hourly fees, counsels' expertise and the substantial multiplier requested.  My
                  review of that order confirms that it was prepared by a fee committee of plaintiffs' counsel, of which Mr. Reed was a
                  member.  I consider that order and others prepared by similar committees in common fund cases, as limited
                  authority.  At best, they should be regarded in the same way as the circuit courts consider findings [**37]  of fact
                  prepared by counsel and entered verbatim by a trial court.  Photo Electronics Corp., v. England, 581 F.2d 772, 777
                  (9th Cir. 1978); Griffen v. Big Spring Indep. School Dist., 706 F.2d 645, 656 (5th Cir. 1983). (on appeal).

                  [*1276]  Defendants object, contending that time for these purposes is customarily disallowed.  As plaintiff points
                  out, the authorities relied on by defendants are cases involving a common fund, whereas it is almost uniformly held
                  that reasonable time claimed for fee issues is allowed the prevailing party in non-fund cases.
                  The [**38]  reasons for this dichotomy are: The prevailing attorneys in a common fund case will be the recipients of
                  an award based on the lodestar calculation, with almost inevitable enhancement after a nonadversarial
                  consideration by a court of Kerr type guidelines. Compensating the attorneys for preparing their fee petitions cannot
                  arguably benefit the class and/or increase the fund.  Ergo, those types of fee petitions are regularly disallowed.
                  Here, there is no fund out of which counsel may be compensated. HN7[
                  ] If the prevailing party is to suffer no loss
                  through bringing the action, and others are to be encouraged to bring similar public interest actions, the
                  unsuccessful party may be required to pay a reasonable attorney fee.  The extent to which a fee petition is
                  contested necessarily adds to the time logged by counsel for the prevailing party. The opposition may be pedantic
                  or it may result from the nature or extent of fees sought by the other party.
                  A losing party in an antitrust action would be well-advised to contest only those attorney fee issues, factual or legal,
                  as to which there is grounds for fair dispute.  Otherwise, the successful party is afforded the opportunity to
                  expand [**39]  the basic fee dispute itself into a substantial fee generating proceeding.
                  One proposition is evident: A multiplier should not be applied to the hours spent on an application for attorneys
                  fees.  The ""risks"" incident to prevailing in the proceeding on the merits are gone.  Any delay in the resolution of the
                  fee application should be no different than that occasioned in resolving an attorneys fee claim in any other action
                  where an application is permitted.  In re Equity Funding Corp. of Am. Securities Litigation, 438 F. Supp. 1303, 1330,
                  C.D. Cal. 1977; Weiss v. Drew Nat. Corp., 465 F. Supp. 548 (S.D.N.Y. 1979). I do not regard the opinion in Kooistra
                  v. Phoenix Newspapers, Inc., Civ 82-946-Phx, cited by Reed, as persuasive authority to the contrary.  This issue
                  was not expressly dealt with in the Court's opinion.  It did not discuss cases which considered the issues and
                  denied a multiplier.
                  For the same reasons stated in Vulcan Soc. of Westchester Cty v. Fire Department, 533 F. Supp. 1054, 1966
                  (S.C.N.Y. 1982) "". . . even assuming the Court has discretion to apply the multiplier to the time spent on this motion,
                  it declines to do so.""
                  The Attorney General and Special [**40]  Counsel each submitted separate fee applications, with opening
                  memoranda and extensive memoranda in response to Defendants' objections.
                  Three Hundred sixty-two hours (362.6) are claimed for preparation and presentation of the two fee petitions.  Using
                  that time and hourly rates approved by the Court, would result in an award to the Attorney General of $7,657.50,
                  with an award to Special Counsel of $34,169.50.
                  I find the time claimed for fee petition purposes is excessive and unwarranted.  The separate memoranda are
                  duplicative and unnecessarily prolix.  A single, coordinated presentation could easily have been utilized. Rather,
                  each set of counsel embarked on an independent research and drafting project, with a seeming lack of expertise or
                  experience in fee petition matters.  Special Counsel even found it necessary to employ five of the firm members on
                  the project.  This is a type of luxurious law practice which I do not believe exists generally in the private practice of
                  law, and certainly not for purposes of preparing a fee petition.  It is inevitable that this number of persons on a
                  project spawn wasted hours and propagate duplication of time. 5
                  [**41]   [*1277]  Counsels' prior involvement in antitrust cases is the only basis upon which I approved their hourly
                  rates.  That activity necessarily encompassed fee applications in those kindred cases.  I have reviewed the fee
                  petitions in other cases involving the Attorney General's office and Reed.  I found essentially the same cases cited
                  and similar -- if not identical arguments advanced as in this proceeding.  Stated most directly, I find that the time
                  5  The fee hearing on December 20, 1982 is an example.  Four Reed attorneys charged time for attending this hearing.  The time
                  for two attorneys was deleted in a supplemental filing in October, 1983.
                  578 F. Supp. 1262, *1275; 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20198, **37
                  
                  
                  entries here (as elsewhere in this case) demonstrate an excessive belaboring of research and preparation of
                  memoranda.  As the Court stated in Ramos v. Lamm, 539 F. Supp. 730, 741 (D.Colo. 1982), ""One should not have
                  to pay for the building of a clock in order to find out the time of day."" Continuing with that analogy, assuming the
                  cost of building the clock is relevant, the time necessary to build additional clocks should be less after the initial
                  invention.
                  The rule which I have followed is well-stated in Lund v. Affleck, 587 F.2d 75, 77, (1st Cir. 1978):
                  . . .  It would be inconsistent with the purpose of the Fees Act to dilute a fees award by refusing to compensate
                  the attorney for the time reasonably spent in [**42]  establishing and negotiating his rightful claim to the fee
                  [citations omitted].  On the other hand, if the attorney's initial claims are exorbitant, or the time spent advancing
                  them unreasonable, the district court should refuse the further compensation.  The same point we have
                  emphasized in all fee situations applies here: HN8[
                  ] it is not enough for the court to multiply a fixed rate by
                  the number of hours claimed.  The court must satisfy itself of the overall fairness and reasonableness of the fee
                  under all the circumstances. . . .
                  The only practical way that I can resolve these claims is by an across the board reduction to correct for what I find
                  to be excessive and redundant hours.  It is my best estimate, based on a review of the hours claimed and the
                  issues involved, that a total time of 175 hours would be reasonable for fee petition purposes.  This time covers
                  preparation of the petition and responding to objections of defendants, as well as providing supplemental
                  information requested by the Court.  Perkins v. Standard Oil Company of California, 474 F.2d 549 (9th Cir. 1973),
                  cert. denied, 412 U.S. 940, 37 L. Ed. 2d 400, 93 S. Ct. 2778 (1973); Gagne v. Maher, 594 [**43]  F.2d 336, 345 (2d
                  Cir. 1979), affirmed, 448 U.S. 122, 100 S. Ct. 2570, 65 L. Ed. 2d 653 (1980). Again, it should be recalled that the
                  hourly rates allowed counsel are intended to compensate them for their special expertise. Otherwise, these rates
                  would be significantly lower.
                  My earlier findings with respect to the Kerr guidelines are applicable to this determination.
                  Fifty of the one hundred seventy-five hours will be allocated to the Attorney General, with the balance to Special
                  Counsel.  For purposes of determining the awards in this instance, I will use average hourly rates of $105 and $120,
                  respectively:
                  Attorney General
                  50 hours x $105
                  $5,250
                  Special Counsel
                  125 hours x $120
                  $ 15,000
                  Quality and Risk Considerations
                  The appropriate procedure in this Circuit for calculating a fee award is described in Moore, 682 F.2d at 840, as a
                  ""blended"" approach, utilizing the ""straight lodestar analysis"" and the ""Kerr guidelines."" The result of this blended
                  approach is a determination ""whether to augment or decrease the award based on quality or contingency
                  considerations."" These two considerations will be considered separately.  [**44]
                  Quality -- The Court in Lindy Bros. Builders, Inc., v. Am. Radiator, Etc., 540 F.2d 102, 117 (3rd Cir. 1976) (Lindy II)
                  pointed out:
                  [*1278]  . . . that a consideration of 'quality' inheres in the 'lodestar' award: counsel who possess or who are
                  reputed to possess more experience, knowledge and legal talent generally command hourly rates superior to
                  those who are less endowed.  Thus, the quality of an attorney's work in general is a component of the
                  reasonably hourly rate; this aspect of 'quality' is reflected in the 'lodestar' and should not be utilized to augment
                  or diminish the basic award under the rubric of 'the quality of an attorney's work.' (Emphasis in original)
                  578 F. Supp. 1262, *1277; 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20198, **41
                  
                  
                  The Lindy II Court emphasized that HN9[
                  ] an increase or decrease in the lodestar is to reflect ""exceptional
                  services only"" and:
                  . . .  The heavy burden of proving entitlement to such an adjustment is on the moving party.
                  Plaintiff's counsel handled the case to a successful conclusion, i.e., they prevailed on its per se position.  I find no
                  reasonable basis for concluding however, that they did so with a ""minimum of time invested"", or that they should be
                  rewarded because they [**45]  secured a ""substantial benefit"" for the public.  Accordingly, a quality multiplier will not
                  be allowed.
                  I have considered applying a negative multiplier because of what I perceive to be a practice of overstaffing,
                  duplication of effort and the accumulation of excessive time throughout this antitrust proceeding.  In Re Fine Paper
                  Antitrust Litigation, 98 F.R.D. 48, 84 (E.D.Pa. 1983). I did not employ this type of multiplier in view of the time which
                  I disallowed.  If additional time was allowed, a substantial negative multiplier would be utilized.
                  Risk
                  Lindy II instructs, 540 F.2d at 117:
                  Under the rubric of 'the contingent nature of success' HN10[
                  ] the district court should appraise the
                  professional burden undertaken -- that is, the probability or likelihood of success, viewed at the time of filing
                  suit.
                  Three factors, with various elements were suggested as particularly relevant:
                  1. Analysis of plaintiff's burden.  Subsumed in this category are the following considerations: (a) the complexity
                  of the case, -- legally and factually; (b) the probability of defendant's liability, -- whether it is clear or dubious;
                  whether it has been previously suggested by other civil [**46]  or criminal proceedings; whether it is asserted
                  under existing case law or statutory interpretation, or is advanced as a novel theory; (c) an evaluation of
                  damages, -- whether the claims would be difficult or easy to prove.
                  2. Risks assumed in developing the case.  This category subsumes consideration of: (a) the number of hours
                  of labor risked without guarantee of remuneration; (b) the amount of out-of-pocket expenses advanced for
                  processing motions, taking depositions, etc.; (c) the development of prior expertise in the particular type of
                  litigation; recognizing that counsel sometimes develop, without compensation, special legal skills which may
                  assist the court in efficient conduct of the litigation, or which may aid the court in articulating legal precepts and
                  implementing sound public policy.
                  3. The delay in receipt of payment for services rendered.
                  The Kerr guidelines are essentially an iteration of the Lindy II criteria.
                  One fact not previously mentioned is worth noting here.  The Attorney General was able, under statutory authority,
                  to engage in prefiling discovery.  Antitrust staff members also discussed the prefiling investigation with Department
                  of Justice [**47]  personnel.  Plaintiff is being compensated for all of this time.
                  The Attorney General was at risk for a much longer period of time than Special Counsel.  Having initiated the
                  action, the State had an ethical obligation to proceed to a final conclusion.
                  The State was responsible for advancing all costs and expenses incident to the case.  Special Counsel's contract,
                  as noted earlier, enabled him to obtain reimbursement on a timely basis for reasonable amounts advanced for a
                  myriad of purposes.  The fact  [*1279]  that he failed to seek reimbursement is not a risk incident to this litigation.
                  Special Counsel's contract to represent the State was secured through what was stated at the Fee hearing to be
                  some type of bidding process.  This occurred within weeks of Reed leaving his position as Chief of the Attorney
                  General's Antitrust Division. He was certainly aware of, and from a supervisory standpoint, responsible for prior
                  proceedings and the status of the case when he signed on.  The Attorney General's Office on December 12, 1980,
                  578 F. Supp. 1262, *1278; 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20198, **44
                  
                  
                  was then, or soon to be, a several times client of Reed.  To read Special Counsel's Fee Petition Memorandum one
                  would conclude that he boarded a derelict [**48]  ship hopelessly adrift in the Sargasso Sea and miraculously
                  brought it into harbor, refurbished and resplendent.  And without any assistance from its earlier crew.  I say
                  nonsense.
                  Special Counsel and Defendants' counsel engage in a spirited exchange as to the relative possibilities of the United
                  States Supreme Court taking the case on certiorari when Reed became Special Counsel.  I do not regard this
                  statistical exercise as a meaningful measure of risk.  Reed, within the parameters of his experience, could readily
                  estimate the number of hours necessary to brief the case if certiorari was granted.  I suspect that most lawyers and
                  particularly those of the antitrust bar, would welcome the opportunity to prepare and argue any antitrust case before
                  the Court.  Particularly so, where prior to the lawyer being engaged, the Court had invited the Solicitor General to
                  file an amicus brief regarding the merits of the certiorari petition.
                  Probably as good an assessment as any of the Supreme Court taking the case, was that expressed by H. Robert
                  Halper, in 49 Antitrust Law Journal 17, 26-27 (1980), in an article titled ""The Health Care Industry and the Antitrust
                  Laws: Collision Course?"":  [**49]
                  . . .  The Ninth Circuits two-to-one decision on March 20, 1980 produced three opinions and an almost certain
                  ticket to the Supreme Court.  At stake is whether the pro se approach or the rule of reason approach should
                  apply to what was conceded to be an agreement by the county medical society physicians on the maximum
                  fees they would be reimbursed by a health insurance plan they had established.
                  Multiplier
                  After considering the varying risk considerations of the State Attorney General and Special Counsel, I have
                  concluded to use a risk multiplier of 1.4 for each.  This multiplier will be applied against the lodestar calculations,
                  exclusive of Fee Petition time.
                  I recognize that on occasion, courts have not applied the multiplier to time spent subsequent to the date that the risk
                  was substantially eliminated by a favorable decision on the merits.  Here, that would be sometime in mid-1982,
