This matter comes before the Court on motions by defendants — Gerber Products Company; H.J. Heinz Company; 
Ralston Purina Company; and Nestle Food Company, BNNC Corporation, and BNC Corporation — for summary 
judgment dismissing the Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint of plaintiffs, Jacob Blinder & Sons 
and others. Oral argument was heard on the motion on December 5, 1996, and the parties thereafter provided the 
Court with additional submissions. For the reasons outlined herein, defendants' motions for summary judgment are 
GRANTED and plaintiffs' Complaint is hereby DISMISSED.
STATEMENT OF FACTS
This action arises out of the allegation that defendants engaged in an unlawful conspiracy in violation of Section 1 
of the Sherman Act to fix, raise, maintain, and stabilize wholesale prices and price levels of baby foods in the United 
States market. Plaintiffs generally contend  [*3] that each of the defendants received information regarding each 
other's intention to increase prices prior to the time the entire trade market received it. Plaintiffs assert that the 
exchange of such information resulted in higher transaction prices and, ultimately, resulted in parallel price fixing.
Defendants are four entities incorporated and existing under the laws of the state as indicated: Gerber Products 
Company, Michigan (""Gerber""); H.J. Heinz Company, Pennsylvania (""Heinz""); Ralston Purina Company, Missouri 
(""Ralston/Beech-Nut""); and Nestle Food Company, BNNC Corporation, and BNC Corporation, Delaware 
(collectively referred to as ""Nestle/Beech-Nut""). All defendants market a variety of baby foods. ""Baby food"" refers to 
various processed and prepared foods for infants and children up to three years of age.
Plaintiffs combine general allegations and specific allegations against each independent defendant. Due to the 
multiple defendants and proffered claims set forth by plaintiffs, the Court will first address the general claims against 
all named defendants and subsequently address the specific assertions against each individual defendant.
Though the factual recitation is comprehensive,  [*4] it is appropriate in this case. Plaintiffs' first claim is that 
defendants conspired with one another in an attempt to influence prices and future sales plans. Plaintiffs contend 
that there was a continuous exchange of information between field sales representatives of defendants. Plaintiffs 
claim that defendants had the opportunity to exchange information regarding price increases, future sales plans, 
and future marketing plans at various trade shows, conventions, and national, regional, and local association 
meetings.
Plaintiffs maintain that defendants advised their employees and brokers to make ""every effort""  [*5] to elicit 
competitive information. It is alleged that once the competitive information was communicated to the broker or sales 
representative's superiors, the same superiors did not inquire into the source of such information. Plaintiffs claim 
that any competitive information received was typically disseminated by word of mouth as opposed to a written 
report being filed. According to plaintiffs, in those few cases where a written report was filed, the report was 
generally sent to the broker's immediate supervisor, who later communicated the information to his or her superiors.
Plaintiffs assert that defendants did not have legitimate business reasons for informing competitors of price 
increases prior to the public announcement of such price increases and, instead, were economically motivated to 
conspire. The effect of the exchange of such information, according to plaintiffs, was an increase in defendants' list 
prices and actual transaction prices of baby food in the United States.
1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24488, *2

 
Plaintiffs set forth the proposition that throughout the period of January 1, 1989, to December 31, 1992, defendants' 
list prices and actual transaction prices were higher than they would have been if defendants  [*6] had not engaged 
in price fixing. Plaintiffs also claim that defendants' list prices and transaction prices moved in a ""parallel fashion.""
Plaintiffs note that the year 1984 marked the end to a trade war in the baby food business. As a result, plaintiffs 
allege, defendants agreed to refrain from entering each other's markets in particular parts of the country where all 
three major defendants had a ""presence."" It is plaintiffs' claim that defendants' customers would choose to stock 
only two brands at one time. 1 Therefore, plaintiffs allege that such conduct is anticompetitive and indicative of 
collusion.
Plaintiffs' second theory is economically based. Plaintiffs begin the analysis by addressing defendants' economic 
arguments individually. First, plaintiffs claim that defendants had a strong motive for engaging in a conspiracy 
because their profits would be greater than if they acted independently. Therefore, even if defendants locked 
themselves into market shares of 15% each, such a scheme would be economically beneficial.
Furthermore, plaintiffs contend that it is not possible that defendants,  [*7] other than Gerber, simply followed 
Gerber's price increases and subsequently also obtained an economic benefit. Plaintiffs instead argue that if 
defendants had set their sales independently, the result would be that the total sales of baby food would be lower 
than the alleged ""agreement"" prices.
It is alleged that there was a partial weakening in the alleged conspiracy in December 1992. Plaintiffs rely upon the 
transaction price data for the last quarter of 1992 to show that prices for First Foods and Cereals decreased. 
Plaintiffs contend that such weakenings indicate a ""small window"" which depicts what the actual prices would have 
been absent the conspiracy.
Plaintiffs third theory of liability is a claim for fraudulent concealment. Plaintiffs claim that defendants engaged in 
self-concealing of the conspiratorial acts and, thus, no information was available for the pursuing party. Plaintiffs 
rely upon the testimony of Marshall A. Gibbs, a former Heinz District Sales Manager, who testified that he and the 
sales representatives regularly received competitive information from sales representatives who represented other 
product manufacturers.
Plaintiffs further rely upon Gibbs's testimony  [*8] that he exchanged competitive information, including pricing 
information, with representatives of other product manufacturers. Finally, plaintiffs claim that ""defendants' SEC 
filings and press releases, and price announcements to customers contained false and misleading explanations 
with respect to the competitive nature of the baby food industry and false and misleading explanations for 
defendants' price increases.""
In light of the foregoing general allegations toward all defendants, plaintiffs proffer additional specific allegations 
against each individual defendant.
GERBER PRODUCTS COMPANY
Plaintiffs contend that Gerber is a baby food manufacturer which sold its baby food through a direct sales force 
everywhere except Alaska, where the same products were sold through a broker. Plaintiffs assert that Gerber's 
direct sales forces included approximately 300 sales representatives in the field who, along with the remaining 
defendants' sales representatives, attended the retail store resets, national, regional, and local association 
meetings, conventions, and trade shows, and had the opportunity to exchange competitive information.
Plaintiffs specifically allege that Gerber received monthly  [*9] reports from the New York District Manager, George 
Voll, regarding the competitive activities of Beech-Nut. Such information, plaintiffs claim, was received from Beech-
1 It is alleged that the choice was to stock Gerber and either Heinz or Beech-Nut baby foods.
1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24488, *5

 
Nut employee Ernest Hemmann, a Beech-Nut Sales Representative with whom Voll had been acquainted for a little 
under twenty years.
Plaintiffs also assert that Brian Anderson, a Heinz sales representative from May 1966 to April 1986, was informed 
by his immediate supervisor, Area Manager Fred Runk, that Gerber and Beech-Nut were going to implement 
wholesale list price increases with respect to baby food products.
Anderson further testified that he did, in fact, exchange information regarding future price increases from both 
Gerber and Beech-Nut prior to any official announcement to the trade. Plaintiff also contends that Vincent Martelli, 
Beech-Nut's Director of Sales Planning and Administration for the Metropolitan New York/New Jersey area, testified 
that information was received by Beech-Nut salespeople and reported to their superiors.
Plaintiffs allege that between April 1, 1987, and November 1993, Albert Gorsky, at one time Gerber's Vice President 
of Sales and later Vice President of Sales/Service, held weekly conference  [*10] calls with other regional 
managers. Plaintiffs contend that these telephone calls specifically discussed competitive information. Essentially, 
plaintiffs' claims against Gerber center upon the premise that Gerber participated in the alleged price-fixing 
conspiracy to increase baby food revenues and profits, to minimize the absolute and relative differences between 
the Gerber list prices and those of any other defendants, and to minimize the absolute and relative differences 
between the Gerber actual transaction prices and those of the other defendants.
Plaintiffs further indicate that collusion existed among defendants by referencing four distinct years which plaintiffs 
suggest is evidence of a conspiracy. First, plaintiffs reference the simultaneous announcement by Gerber and 
Beech-Nut of a baby food price increase on December 10, 1984, and the fact that Heinz raised its prices shortly 
thereafter, allegedly based upon advance knowledge of the Gerber price increase.
Secondly, plaintiffs note that Beech-Nut increased its prices in September 1986, expecting that Gerber and Heinz 
would follow suit. Plaintiffs reference a Beech-Nut 1987 budget, dated December 31, 1986, wherein Beech-Nut's 
 [*11] President, Neils Hoyvald, stated that ""We anticipate a Gerber price increase of 2 cents per jar, sometime in 
the first quarter of 1987, which has yet been announced."" There was no response from either Gerber or Heinz, 
however, despite plaintiffs' contentions that Gerber was in possession of a September 4, 1986 National Price 
Advance announcement. Plaintiffs note that both Gerber and Heinz ultimately announced an increase of the same 
amount.
Third, plaintiffs, citing a letter from Richard Theuer (President of Beech-Nut Nutrition Corp.) to James Biggar 
(Chairman of Nestle Enterprises), dated February 6, 1989, allege that Beech-Nut obtained confidential information 
regarding a Gerber price increase effective February 13, 1989.
Finally, plaintiffs assert that Beech-Nut also had knowledge about Gerber's planned February 1990 price increase 
well before its official announcement to the trade. Plaintiffs point to an October 13, 1989 memorandum to Beech-
Nut from Joseph Gaeto (Vice President of Marketing) to Theuer and a December 20, 1989 memo issued by Mick 
Humbarger to regional and zone managers as evidence that Beech-Nut knew about Gerber's planned February 
1990 price increase prior to the  [*12] official announcement.
Plaintiffs attempt to substantiate the former propositions with additional testimony that ""rumors"" were received from 
competitors' informing Beech-Nut's employees about the competitor's future plans.
Plaintiffs also contend that Gerber received advanced knowledge of Beech-Nut's pricing plans in other instances. 
Plaintiffs cite the following specific instances in support of their position that there was an exchange of information 
between defendants resulting in anticompetitive conduct:
1. Two 1985 Beech-Nut internal bulletins from Martelli to all full-time Beech-Nut sales representatives notifying 
the Beech-Nut sales force of future couponing programs which were produced by Gerber.
2. A September 15, 1987 Heinz memorandum which circulated a confidential internal Gerber memorandum 
referring to future promotional strategies and plans.
3. A 1989 Gerber electronic mail message reported a meeting in which a Heinz sales representative informed a 
Gerber sales representative of Heinz's future plans to come out with a six-pack of juice.
1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24488, *9

 
4. A July 7, 1989 Beech-Nut Competitive Activity memorandum prepared and distributed by Joe Higgins in Fort 
Washington, Pennsylvania, which  [*13] contained a Gerber internal electronic mail message dated May 18, 
1989, announcing promotional programs to be implemented in August 1989.
5. A January 1990 Heinz memorandum which accounted for direct contact with a Gerber broker regarding the 
discontinuance of the Gerber wet baby food program.
6. In May 1990, Mick Humbarger's April status report to Beech-Nut's President, Jim Nichols, reflected that he 
had received a rumor from Gerber that it was planning to discontinue its eight-ounce juice and juice in plastic 
four-packs. Additionally, Humbarger indicated to Nichols that Gerber wanted to discontinue the shelf-stocking 
allowance in New Jersey.
7. In August 1990, Gerber circulated an internal Heinz memorandum regarding promotional strategy.
8. In a May 20, 1991 Gerber memorandum, Charles Fanning, Boston District Manager, indicated to Jerri 
Wilson, Gerber Director of Field Communication, that his area manager met with a Beech-Nut representative 
who indicated that Beech-Nut would not downsize their Stages 1 and 2 jars to four ounces at that time.
9. A  [*14] January 3, 1992 Competitive Activity Report from Wilson to Gerber distribution detailed information 
regarding Beech-Nut's future sales activities.
10. A July 29, 1992 Gerber memorandum from Gorsky to Lewis Ammirati, Senior Vice President for Sales, U.S. 
Gerber Products Division, reflected Gerber's knowledge of Beech-Nut's ""target date for removing starch and 
flour from a number of their items, the target date for conversion of Stage 1 and 2 foods to 4 ounce containers, 
and the upcoming tropical line.""
11. In December 17, 1992, Wilson received information from Voll regarding Beech-Nut's plans for the following 
year.
12. In a September 12, 1986 weekly posting letter by Richard Seitter, Beech-Nut Regional Manager, it is noted 
that there was a conversation with Gerber salesmen where it was determined that Gerber's new products ""are 
strained and whipped to provide a different and more uniform texture"" and that the ""peaches contain no added 
sugar, and the bananas contain no modified starch.""
13. In a September 13, 1986 weekly posting letter by Martelli from Beech-Nut, it is stated that Gerber plans to 
""mail a sample jar of their Starter food to all new mothers.""
14. A February 4, 1987 memorandum  [*15] by Howard Pratt, Beech-Nut Vice President of Sales, to the 
Executive Committee of Beech-Nut addresses Gerber's plans to nationally market eight-ounce juices in four-
packs in addition to a twenty-five-ounce juice in plastic bottles.
15. An internal Gerber memorandum in 1988 discussing its planned February 1989 price increase 
acknowledges Heinz's ability to increase its prices at that time.
16. A June 17, 1991 memorandum from Jack McPadden, Beech-Nut Bronx Area District Manager, to 
Humbarger indicates that McFadden conversed with a Gerber supervisor with regard to whether Beech-Nut 
would have any more in-ad coupons.
17. A September 26, 1989 Gerber memorandum indicates that Gerber employees in Detroit met with Ralston 
personnel regarding Ralston's future business plans.
Plaintiffs contend that in light of the foregoing exchange of information, Gerber was aware that it could not raise its 
prices unless there was a clear understanding that Heinz or Beech-Nut would also raise their prices. Therefore, 
plaintiffs contend that a conspiracy existed between all defendants which resulted in anticompetitive activity.
H.J. HEINZ COMPANY
Plaintiffs also proffer specific allegations against defendant H.J.  [*16] Heinz Company. Plaintiffs maintain that 
Heinz participated in the conspiracy to increase its baby food revenues and profits, to decrease or eliminate large 
competitive counteroffers (promotional allowances and discounts), and to stabilize and maintain their respective 
market shares.
Plaintiffs first contend that Heinz participated in a ""truce"" with all defendants which provided that they would not 
enter one another's markets and would, at a minimum, reduce promotional allowances. Although plaintiffs reference 
1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24488, *12

 
a March 1, 1984 memorandum wherein Ron Coble, Heinz's Area Manager for the Carolinas, refers to a ""truce,"" 
plaintiffs acknowledge that there is a dispute as to the meaning of ""truce."" 2
Plaintiffs refer to various actions and inactions by Heinz over the years and deem such decisions to be consistent 
with the ""truce"" theory. Plaintiffs contend that Heinz's decision in August 1984 and March 1985 not to pursue 
business in Miami was attributed to the truce. Plaintiffs also contend that Heinz contemplated  [*17] entering the 
Gerber/Beech-Nut dominated Chicago market in 1988 but later declined due to the same truce.
Plaintiffs next contend that Heinz exchanged a ""significant"" amount of information with Gerber and Beech-Nut 
regarding future price increases prior to any announcements to the trade. In the same light in which plaintiffs set 
forth their allegations against Gerber, plaintiffs simply contend that various individuals from both Beech-Nut and 
Gerber spoke with Heinz on several occasions regarding future price increases and promotions.
Plaintiffs contend that the exchange of competitive information was an essential part of the lower-level employee's 
job. Plaintiffs maintain that such communications were through Heinz Sales Representative Brian Anderson. The 
allegations set forth against Heinz essentially mirror the claims set forth against Gerber.
NESTLE/BEECH-NUT
Plaintiffs also allege that Nestle/Beech-Nut participated in the conspiracy to increase its baby food revenues and 
profits, to decrease or eliminate large competitive counteroffers (promotional allowances and discounts), and to 
stabilize and maintain the defendants' respective markets. Plaintiffs allege that Nestle exchanged and 
 [*18] communicated information to the other companies with respect to future price increases prior to any 
announcement to the trade via sales representatives. It is also alleged that Nestle, through direct communication 
between company representatives and receipt of competitor's internal memoranda, obtained confidential 
information regarding the other defendants' future promotional programs and future sales and marketing plans.
Finally, plaintiffs contend that Nestle participated in the ""truce.""
RALSTON PURINA COMPANY
Plaintiffs claim that the motivation for Ralston to participate in the alleged conspiracy in November 1989 was to 
reverse the Nestle-Ralston/Beech-Nut market share erosion resulting from the sale of adulterated and misbranded 
Beech-Nut apple juice, to stabilize and maintain Ralston's market share, and to increase the Ralston/Beech-Nut 
baby food revenues and profits. Plaintiffs allege that Ralston's price lists were not ""new and different"" but, instead, 
were in compliance with the conspiracy. Plaintiffs' remaining claims against Ralston are centered upon the 
preceding allegations against Gerber, Heinz, and Nestle.
DISCUSSION
Summary Judgment
The standard governing summary judgment  [*19] motions is set forth in Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c), which provides in 
pertinent part:
[t]he judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and 
admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material 
fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.
2 Ron Coble testified via deposition that the term ""truce"" had nothing to do with Beech-Nut, but instead involved an internal 
dispute between Heinz's marketing and sales departments.

974 F.2d 1358, 1362 (3d Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 912, 113 S. Ct. 1262, 122 L. Ed. 2d 659 (1993). ""This is 
true even in antitrust cases, 'where motive and intent play leading roles, the proof is largely in the hands of the 
alleged conspirators, and hostile witnesses thicken the plot.'"" Id. (quoting Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting Sys., 
Inc., 368 U.S. 464, 473, 82 S. Ct. 486, 7 L. Ed. 2d 458 (1962)). A nonmovant's burden in defending against a 
summary judgment motion in an antitrust case is no different than that in any other case. Id. at 1363.
In this case, plaintiffs have failed to provide any evidence from which a reasonable inference may be drawn that 
defendants  [*21] engaged in an antitrust violation. Although it is not necessary that plaintiffs eliminate every 
possible independent justification by the manufacturers so that only evidence of concerted action remains in the 
record, plaintiffs must at least produce ""evidence that tends to exclude the possibility of independent action by the 
manufacturer and distributor."" See Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Serv. Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 768, 104 S. Ct. 1464, 79 
L. Ed. 2d 775, reh'g denied, 466 U.S. 994, 104 S. Ct. 2378, 80 L. Ed. 2d 850 (1984). It should always be 
remembered that there is often a fine line separating unlawful concerted action from legitimate business practices. 
""Care must be taken to ensure that inferences of unlawful activity drawn from ambiguous evidence do not infringe 
upon the defendants' freedom."" Big Apple, 974 F.2d at 1363.
Antitrust law limits the ""range of permissible inferences from ambiguous evidence in a § 1 case."" Matsushita, 475 
U.S. at 588. More particularly, ""conduct as consistent with permissible competition as with illegal conspiracy does 
not, standing alone, support an inference of antitrust conspiracy."" Id. This is because ""mistaken inferences in such a 
context 'are especially costly'"" and ""'chill the very conduct the antitrust laws are designed  [*22] to protect.'"" Alvord-
Polk, Inc. v. F. Schumacher & Co., 37 F.3d 996, 1001 (3d Cir. 1994) (quoting Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 594), cert. 
denied, 514 U.S. 1063, 115 S. Ct. 1691, 131 L. Ed. 2d 556 (1995).
The evidence must be analyzed as a whole, and not taken piecemeal, in determining whether an inference of 
concerted action is supported. See Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 82 S. Ct. 
1404, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1962). Plaintiffs in antitrust cases must be afforded the ""full benefit of their proof without 
tightly compartmentalizing the various factual components and wiping the slate clean after scrutiny of each."" Id. at 
699.
Sherman Act Claims
Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides that ""[e]very contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or 
conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be 
illegal."" 15 U.S.C. § 1.
1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24488, *19

 
In order to prove a claim brought under section 1 of the Sherman Act, a plaintiff must prove:
(1) that the defendants contracted, combined or conspired among each other; (2) that the combination or 
conspiracy produced adverse anti-competitive effects within the relevant product and geographic markets; (3) 
that the objects of and conduct pursuant  [*23] to the contract or conspiracy were illegal; and (4) that the 
plaintiffs were injured as a proximate result of that conspiracy.
Tunis Bros. Co. v. Ford Motor Co., 952 F.2d 715, 722 (3d Cir. 1991) (quoting Tunis Bros. Co. v. Ford Motor Co., 
763 F.2d 1482, 1489 (3d Cir. 1985)), cert. denied, 505 U.S. 1221, 112 S. Ct. 3034, 120 L. Ed. 2d 903 (1992).
There are certain types of violations which the Supreme Court has held constitute per se violations of the Sherman 
Act.
[T]here are certain agreements or practices which because of their pernicious effect on competition and lack of 
any redeeming virtue are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and therefore illegal without elaborate 
inquiry as to the precise harm they have caused or the business excuse for their use.
United States v. General Motors Corp., 384 U.S. 127, 146, 86 S. Ct. 1321, 16 L. Ed. 2d 415 (1966) (quoting 
Northern Pac. Ry. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5, 78 S. Ct. 514, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1958)). Per se violations of 
the Sherman Act include price-fixing, market division agreements, and group boycotts. See, e.g., Greene County 
Memorial Park v. Behm Funeral Homes, Inc., 797 F. Supp. 1276, 1288-89 (W.D. Pa. 1992), aff'd, 993 F.2d 876 (3d 
Cir.), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 866, 114 S. Ct. 187, 126 L. Ed. 2d 146 (1993). Whether conduct violates the Act is 
determined on a  [*24] case-by-case application of the Rule of Reason if it is not a per se case. Business 
Electronics Corp. v. Sharp Electronics Corp., 485 U.S. 717, 723, 108 S. Ct. 1515, 99 L. Ed. 2d 808, cert. denied, 
486 U.S. 1005, 108 S. Ct. 1727, 100 L. Ed. 2d 192 (1988).
Although explicit agreement is not necessary to prove a Sherman Act conspiracy, a conspiracy is evident where 
there is ""joint and collaborative action"" which is ""pervasive in the initiation, execution, and fulfillment of the plan."" 
General Motors, 384 U.S. at 143. The circumstantial evidence necessary to prove the agreement is often referred to 
as ""plus factors.""
Plaintiffs in this case have come forward with various pieces of correspondence and memoranda regarding the 
price increases and product/marketing changes of certain defendants which other defendants had in their 
possession. There is also evidence that sales representatives from each defendant met at certain times over the 
years and talked about upcoming price increases or promotional activities. What is sorely lacking, however, is any 
evidence which points to an agreement between defendants that they would fix prices.
It is not unlawful for a company to follow a competitor's price increase absent an agreement to do so. Additionally, it 
is sheer folly to  [*25] believe that manufacturers and distributors do not attempt to determine what their competitors 
are doing. As John D. Rockefeller once said, ""The growth of a large business is merely a survival of the fittest."" W.J. 
Ghent, Our Benevolent Feudalism 29 (1902).
Plaintiffs contend that the mere exchange of pricing information, without more, has been held to allow the defeat of 
summary judgment by the United States Supreme Court. See United States v. Container Corp. of America, 393 
U.S. 333, 89 S. Ct. 510, 21 L. Ed. 2d 526 (1969). In Container Corp., however, the price information which was 
disseminated dealt with pricing to individual customers, something which is not present in the case sub judice.
More importantly, however, is the fact that plaintiffs are unable to show that defendants' prices moved in a parallel 
fashion. This is true both for list prices and transaction prices. 3 See infra. On this basis alone, plaintiffs' case fails.
Even if plaintiffs were to show parallel pricing, this in itself is not enough for a court to infer that defendants had 
conspired. Plaintiffs must also show that there are  [*26] ""plus"" factors, or circumstantial evidence of a conspiracy. 
3 Plaintiffs merely contend that the parallel increase in list prices caused the transaction prices to increase as well.
1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24488, *22

 
Showing parallel behavior and hoping that something more expansive can be developed at a later point in time is 
insufficient to warrant a trial. The Court notes that the discovery in this case has been exhaustive.
Evidence of parallel pricing alone is ambiguous, because it is as consistent with permissible competition as with a 
conspiracy.
A firm in a concentrated industry typically has reason to decide (individually) to copy an industry leader. After 
all, a higher-than-leader's price might lead a customer to buy elsewhere, while a lower-than-leader's price 
might simply lead competitors to match the lower price, reducing profits for all.. One does not need an 
agreement to bring about this kind of follow-the-leader effect in a concentrated industry.
Clamp-All Corp. v. Cast Iron Soil Pipe Inst., 851 F.2d 478, 484 (1st Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 1007, 109 S. 
Ct. 789, 102 L. Ed. 2d 780 (1989). Even the evidence of plus factors must still tend to exclude the possibility of 
independent conduct. See Petruzzi's IGA Supermarkets, Inc. v. Darling-Delaware Co., 998 F.2d 1224, 1232 (3d 
Cir.), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 994, 114 S. Ct. 554, 126 L. Ed. 2d 455 (1993). More specifically, the plaintiff must 
 [*27] establish that the defendants had an economic motivation to enter the alleged agreement and that the 
defendants acted contrary to their own economic interests. Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587.
Here, the only evidence presented is as consistent with competition as with illegal conspiracy. More specifically, 
plaintiffs point to sporadic, individuated contacts among a discrete group of low-level employees without pricing 
authority. Additionally, plaintiffs' expert economists engage in statistical exercises predicated on the assumption 
that a price-fixing conspiracy existed.
Parallel Pricing
Plaintiffs have contended all along that this case is a conscious parallelism case. In their postargument 
supplemental submissions, however, plaintiffs claim that plus factors alone, even absent parallel pricing, are 
sufficient to defeat a summary judgment motion. This Court does not agree. Any allegation of an unlawful price 
fixing agreement must be supported by some observable impact on prices. Where there is no impact on prices, 
there is no price fixing agreement. 4 This is simply common sense. To establish a conspiracy ""based on consciously 
parallel behavior, a plaintiff must show: (1) that the defendants'  [*28] behavior was parallel."" Petruzzi's at 1242-43. 
The very notion of ""plus"" factors is that they are ""plus,"" or in addition to, evidence of parallel pricing. 5
In looking at the charts presented at oral argument which used pricing information extrapolated from the report of 
plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Albert Mandasky, it is clear that defendants' prices were not parallel. See, e.g., Exhibit C-2
