                  Following certification, Bradburn sought to apply estoppel to many of the liability findings of the LePage's jury, with
                  some success. In our Order of March 30, 2005, we granted collateral estoppel to Bradburn on several issues (the
                  ""Estoppel Order""). Bradburn Parent Teacher Store, Inc. v. 3M, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5315, 2005 WL 736629 (E.D.
                  Pa. Mar. 30, 2005). Following a Motion for Reconsideration by 3M pertaining to the Estoppel Order, which we
                  granted [**6]  in part and denied in part, we deemed the following issues to be established for the purposes of this
                  action: (1) for the time period from June 11, 1993 to October 13, 1999, the relevant market in this matter is the
                  market for invisible and transparent tape for home and office use in the United States; and (2) for some time period
                  from June 11, 1993 to October 13, 1999, 3M possessed monopoly power in the relevant market, including the
                  power to control prices and exclude competition in the relevant market, 3M willfully maintained such monopoly
                  power by predatory or exclusionary conduct, and 3M's predatory or exclusionary conduct harmed competition (the
                  ""Amended Estoppel Order""). Bradburn Parent Teacher Store, Inc. v. 3M., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11375, 2005 WL
                  1388929 (E.D. Pa. June 9, 2005). 3M then sought leave to file an interlocutory appeal of the Amended Estoppel
                  Order. We certified the issue for interlocutory appeal. Bradburn Parent Teacher Store, Inc. v. 3M, 2005 U.S. Dist.
                  LEXIS 15815, 2005 WL 1819969 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 2, 2005). However, the Third Circuit denied 3M's petition to allow
                  an interlocutory appeal on September 27, 2005.
                  Following the class and estoppel proceedings, the parties proceeded to full fact [*326]  and [**7]  expert discovery,
                  including dozens of depositions and production and review of more than 1 million pages of documents from 3M and
                  third parties. (Pl. Corr. Mem. in Support at 4-5.) The parties participated in mediation with Jonathan Marks on
                  November 8-9, 2005, but were unable to reach agreement. (Id. at 5.) As trial was scheduled to begin on May 30,
                  2006, the parties filed pretrial memorandum, witness lists, exhibit lists, deposition designation, and motions in
                  limine; and conducted the last round of depositions of experts on the opinions set forth in their supplemental
                  reports. (Id. However, on May 5, 2006, they reached a settlement agreement after another mediation session with
                  Mr. Marks. (Id.
                  On September 8, 2006, Bradburn filed a Motion for Preliminary Approval of Settlement. We preliminarily approved
                  the Settlement on October 24, 2006. This Order also authorized the dissemination of Notice of Proposed
                  513 F. Supp. 2d 322, *325; 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35899, **3
                  
                  
                  Settlement, scheduled a Final Approval Hearing for April 18, 2007, and set February 7, 2007 as the deadline for
                  objections to the Settlement.
                  On January 18, 2007, Bradburn filed the instant Motion for Final Approval of the Settlement and Class Counsel's
                  ""Application [**8]  for Attorneys' Fee, Expenses, and Class Representative Incentive Award."" The Motion and
                  Application were supported by the following: Declaration of Charles G. Hunter (""Hunter Declaration""); Declaration of
                  Richard Bithell (""Bithell Declaration""); Declaration of Gregory Baruch (""Baruch Declaration""); and Declaration of
                  Geoffrey C. Hazard (""Hazard Declaration""). Bradburn subsequently filed a Corrected Memorandum in Support of
                  Motion for Final Approval of Settlement (""Pl. Corr. Mem. in Support""); Class Counsel's Corrected Application for
                  Attorneys' Fee, Expenses, and Class Representative Award (""Corr. Application""); Memorandum in Further Support
                  of the Motion and Application (""Pl. Mem. in Further Support""); Second Declaration of Gregory Baruch (""Second
                  Baruch Decl.""); Second Declaration of Bithell (""Second Bithell Decl.""); and Third Declaration of Bithell (""Third Bithell
                  Decl."").
                  B. The Settlement Agreement
                  1. The Class Definition
                  The Class certified by the Court, and clarified in the Preliminary Approval Order as to the time period for the Class
                  is defined as follows:
                  all persons who directly purchased invisible or transparent tape from 3M Company between October 2, 1998
                  and [**9]  February 10, 2006, who have not purchased, for resale under the Class Member's own label, any
                  ""private label"" invisible or transparent tape from 3M Company or any of 3M Company's competitors at any time
                  from October 2, 1988 to February 10, 2006; but excluding the following: (i) 3M Company, its subsidiaries,
                  affiliates, officers, directors, and employees; (ii) those Persons that timely and validly requested exclusion from
                  the Class in response to the Notice of Pendency of Class Action dated November 29, 2004, provided pursuant
                  to the Court's November 12, 2004 Order; and (iii) any other Person that may be excluded by order of the Court.
                  2. Terms of the Settlement Agreement
                  The Settlement Agreement provides for payment into a common fund of $39,750,000.00 in cash (the ""Settlement
                  Consideration""). Following payment of the attorneys' fees, expenses, and any class representative incentive award
                  from the Settlement Consideration, all of the remaining funds are to be distributed to the Class. The Settlement
                  Agreement does not require class members to file [*327]  proof of claim forms. Therefore, all class members that
                  can be located will receive a distribution from the common fund. The Settlement [**10]  Consideration equals
                  between 41 and 48 percent of the damages calculated by Plaintiff's expert Dr. Morton Kamien. (Pl. Corr. Mem. in
                  Support at 7.) The Settlement Consideration results in an award of more than 18.5 percent of the Class's
                  transparent tape purchases during the more than seven year damage period. (Id.) In return for the Settlement
                  Consideration, the parties agree to dismiss the case with prejudice and the Class members agree to release and
                  discharge 3M from any and all claims asserted, or which could have been asserted, in the litigation. The release
                  includes all claims and potential claims concerning any 3M discount, rebate, offer, promotion or other sales program
                  or practice (including, without limitation, programs claimed to involve the bundling of products or volume growth
                  rebates) relating in any way to the sale, promotion, or distribution of invisible or transparent tape for home or office
                  use in effect from January 1, 1993 to the Settlement Agreement Date, September 5, 2006.
                  C. Final Approval Hearing
                  On April 18, 2006, we held a Final Approval Hearing to address the Motion for Final Approval and the Application
                  for Fees, Expenses, and Class Representative [**11]  Incentive Award. At the Final Approval Hearing, Class
                  Counsel reported that no objections or requests for entry of appearance through separate counsel have been filed,
                  and no correspondence has been received that would indicate a Class Member's interest in raising an objection in
                  response to the Notices mailed before or after the original objections deadline. The parties agreed to an extension
                  until May 3, 2007 to allow time for 71 Class Members, whose addresses had only recently been identified and who
                  were sent a Notice of the proposed Class Settlement on or before April 9, 2007, to file any objections. Class
                  513 F. Supp. 2d 322, *326; 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35899, **7
                  
                  
                  Counsel subsequently reported to the Court on May 3, 2007, that no objections have been filed by these 71
                  remaining Class Members.
                  II. MOTION FOR FINAL APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT
                  HN1[
                  ] ""The decision of whether to approve a proposed settlement of a class action is left to the sound discretion
                  of the district court."" Girsh v. Jepson, 521 F.2d 153, 156 (3d Cir. 1975). ""While the law generally favors settlement
                  in complex or class action cases for its conservation of judicial resources, the court has an obligation to ensure that
                  any settlement reached protects [**12]  the interests of the class members."" In re Aetna Inc. Sec. Litig., MDL No.
                  1219, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68, 2001 WL 20928, at *4 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 4, 2001) (citing In re General Motors Corp.
                  Pick-Up Truck Fuel Tank Prods. Liab. Litig., 55 F.3d 768, 784 (3d Cir. 1995)). Consequently, prior to approving a
                  settlement, the Court must determine whether the notice provided to class members was adequate. Id. (citations
                  omitted). The Court must also ""scrutinize the terms of the settlement to ensure that it is 'fair, adequate and
                  reasonable.'"" Id. (quoting In re General Motors, 55 F.3d at 785).
                  A. Adequacy of Notice
                  HN2[
                  ] The due process demands of the Fifth Amendment and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require
                  adequate notice to class members of a proposed settlement. In re Aetna, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68, 2001 WL
                  20928, at *5. ""In the class action context, the district court obtains personal jurisdiction over the absentee class
                  members by providing proper notice of the impending class action and providing the absentees with the opportunity
                  to be heard or the opportunity to exclude themselves from the class."" In re Prudential [*328]  Ins. Co. of Am. Sales
                  Practice Litig., 148 F.3d 283, 306 (3d Cir. 1998) [**13]  (citing Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U.S. 797, 811-
                  12, 105 S. Ct. 2965, 86 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1985)). The due process requirements of the Fifth Amendment are satisfied
                  by the ""combination of reasonable notice, the opportunity to be heard and the opportunity to withdraw from the
                  class."" Id. The notice must be ""'reasonably calculated under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of
                  the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.'"" Lachance v. Harrington, 965
                  F. Supp. 630, 636 (E.D. Pa. 1997) (quoting Mullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 314, 70 S.
                  Ct. 652, 94 L. Ed. 865 (1950)).
                  Moreover, HN3[
                  ] ""in a settlement class maintained under Rule 23(b)(3), class notice must meet the requirements
                  of both Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(c)(2) and 23(e)."" In re Diet Drugs (Phentermine, Fenfluramine,
                  Dexfenfluramine) Prod. Liab. Litig., 226 F.R.D. 498, 517 (E.D. Pa. 2005) (citing Carlough v. Amchem Prods., Inc.,
                  158 F.R.D. 314, 324-25 (E.D. Pa. 1993)). Rule 23(c)(2) provides that class members must receive the ""best notice
                  practicable under the circumstances, including [**14]  individual notice to all members who can be identified through
                  reasonable effort."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(B). Rule 23(c)(2) also requires that ""the notice indicate an opportunity to
                  opt out, that the judgment will bind all class members who do not opt out and that any member who does not opt
                  out may appear through counsel."" In re Diet Drugs, 226 F.R.D. at 517 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)).
                  HN4[
                  ] In addition to the requirements of Rule 23(c)(2), Rule 23(e) ""requires that notice of a proposed settlement
                  must inform class members: (1) of the nature of the pending litigation; (2) of the settlement's general terms; (3) that
                  complete information is available from the court files; and (4) that any class member may appear and be heard at
                  the Fairness Hearing."" Id. at 517-18 (citation omitted). The court should consider both ""the mode of dissemination
                  and its content to assess whether notice was sufficient."" Id. Although the ""notice need not be unduly specific . . . the
                  notice document must describe, in detail, the nature of the proposed settlement, the circumstances justifying it, and
                  the consequences of accepting and opting out of it."" Id. at 518 [**15]  (citing In re Diet Drugs
                  (Phentermine/Fenfluramine/Dexfenfluramine) Prods. Liab. Litig., 369 F.3d 293, 308-10 (3d Cir. 2004)).
                  We find that the Notice provided in this case satisfies the requirements of due process and the Federal Rules of
                  Civil Procedure. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement and the Court's Preliminary Approval Order, Poorman-
                  Douglas Corp. (""PDC"") was authorized and appointed to serve as Settlement Administrator in this matter, and was
                  responsible for assisting with the administration of the Settlement by, among other things, mailing the Class Notice
                  to Class Members, and identifying Class Members whose initial Notices were returned as undeliverable. (Bithell
                  Decl. P 4.) The Settlement Class consists of 3,574 Class Members identified in the 3M data provided to Plaintiff and
                  513 F. Supp. 2d 322, *327; 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35899, **11
                  
                  
                  PDC. (Second Bithell Decl. P 5.) PDC mailed the Notice of the Proposed Class Settlement to each Class Member
                  on the Class Member list on January 8, 2007. (Bithell Decl. P 6.) Included in the notice was a special insert sheet
                  that calculated each class member's approximate percentage share of the Net Settlement Amount. (Id.) For
                  undeliverable Notices, PDC performed a database [**16]  search for a new address for the Class Members using
                  an address search database owned and operated by Lexis/Nexis. (Second Bithell Decl. P 6.) New
                  addresses [*329]  were found for 952 Class Members, and a Notice was re-mailed to them on or before January 18,
                  2007. (Bithell Decl. P 7.) PDC performed additional searches using the Internet and telephone contacts for those
                  Class Members whose Notices were undeliverable and who had award amounts of $1,000 or more. (Second Bithell
                  Decl. P 7.) Ninety-three Class Members met this criteria. (Id. PDC located a new address for 48 of them and mailed
                  Notices to them on or before March 30, 2007. (Id. Finally, PDC performed additional searches using the Internet
                  and telephone contact for those Class Members whose Notices were undeliverable and who had award amounts of
                  $100 or more. (Third Bithell Decl. P 4.) One hundred and sixty-four Class Members met this criteria. (Id. PDC
                  located a new address for 71 of them and mailed Notices to them on or before April 9, 2007. (Id. PDC also hosted a
                  website, www.bradburntapesettlement.com, as well as a dedicated toll free telephone line for claimant access. As a
                  result of PDC's efforts to locate valid [**17]  addresses for the Class Members, the total number of Class Members
                  for whom Notice was undeliverable is just 257 out of the 3,574 Class Members identified in 3M's sales data. (Id. P
                  8). The percentage of tape sales during the damage period (and the percentage of proposed settlement funds)
                  represented by these undeliverable Notices in 2.86 percent. (Id. We find that these efforts to disseminate notice
                  were the best practicable. See Zimmer Paper Prods., Inc. v. Berger & Montague, 758 F.2d 86, 90 (3d Cir. 1985)
                  (noting that HN5[
                  ] ""in the usual situation first-class mail and publication in press fully satisfy the notice
                  requirements of both Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 and the due process clause"").
                  We also find the content of the Notice to be adequate under the due process clause and Rule 23. The Notice
                  describes the nature and background of this action and defines the Class, Class claims, and consequences of
                  Class Membership. (Pl. Corr. Mem. in Support, Ex. B.) It summarizes the terms of the Settlement, including
                  information relating to the size of the Settlement Fund; the release provisions of the Settlement; and the attorneys'
                  fees, expenses, and incentive award for which [**18]  Bradburn may apply. (Id. The Notice also describes the
                  proposed Distribution Plan. (Id. The Notice informs Class Members of the time and date of the Final Approval
                  Hearing, and advises them of the nature and purpose of the Hearing, of their rights to object to the Settlement and
                  appear at the Hearing, and of the procedure for asserting those rights. (Id. The Notice includes the contact
                  information of the relevant attorneys and of the Settlement Administrator, and also directs Class Members to the
                  dedicated website where additional information pertaining to the case maybe found. (Id. After reviewing the Notice,
                  we conclude that the substance, like the method of dissemination, is sufficient to satisfy the concerns of due
                  process and Rule 23. See In re Prudential, 148 F.3d at 328; In re Aetna, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68, 2001 WL
                  20928, at *5 (citing In re Ikon Office Solutions, Inc. Sec. Litig., 194 F.R.D. 166, 175 (E.D. Pa. 2000)).
                  B. Presumption of Fairness
                  HN6[
                  ] Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires that the Court must approve any settlement of
                  a class action and states that the Court may only approve a settlement ""after [**19]  a hearing and on finding that
                  the settlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise is fair, reasonable, and adequate."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(1). The
                  Third Circuit has determined that a court should accord a presumption of fairness to a settlement if the court finds
                  that: ""(1) the negotiations occurred at arms length; (2) there was sufficient [*330]  discovery; (3) the proponents of
                  the settlement are experienced in similar litigation; and (4) only a small fraction of the class objected."" In re Cendant
                  Corp. Litig., 264 F.3d 201, 232 n.18 (3d Cir. 2001) (citing In re General Motors, 55 F.3d at 785).
                  The Settlement in this case is entitled to a presumption of fairness. The Settlement resulted from arm's-length
                  negotiations that occurred both during the Court-suggested mediation and in the months following mediation. (Pl.
                  Corr. Mem in Support at 8.) This case was settled only after all discovery, lasting more than one year, was
                  completed. (Hazard Decl. P 11.) Class Counsel has extensive experience litigating complex actions such as the
                  one at hand. (Baruch Decl. P 3.) Lastly, no Class Members filed objections to the Settlement. Accordingly, we will
                  apply a presumption [**20]  of fairness in analyzing the Settlement.
                  C. The Girsh Factors
                  513 F. Supp. 2d 322, *328; 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35899, **15
                  
                  
                  HN7[
                  ] The Third Circuit developed a nine factor test in Girsh, ""which provides the analytic structure for
                  determining whether a class action settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate under Rule 23(e)."" In re Cendant,
                  264 F.3d at 231 (citation omitted). The nine factors are:
                  (1) the complexity, expense, and likely duration of the litigation; (2) the reaction of the class to the settlement;
                  (3) the stage of the proceedings and the amount of discovery completed; (4) the risks of establishing liability;
                  (5) the risks of establishing damages; (6) the risks of maintaining the class action through the trial; (7) the
                  ability of the defendants to withstand a greater judgment; (8) the range of reasonableness of the settlement
                  fund in light of the best possible recovery; and (9) the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund in light of
                  all the attendant risks of litigation.
                  Id. at 232 (citing Girsh, 521 F.2d at 157). Upon consideration of these factors, we find that the proposed Settlement
                  is fair, reasonable, and adequate.
                  1. Complexity, expense,  [**21]   and likely duration of the litigation
                  HN8[
                  ] ""This factor captures 'the probable costs, in both time and money, of continued litigation.'"" Id. at 233
                  (quoting In re General Motors, 55 F.3d at 812). An antitrust class action, such as this one, is ""arguably the most
                  complex action to prosecute"" as ""[t]he legal and factual issues involved are always numerous and uncertain in
                  outcome."" In re Linerboard Antitrust Litig., 296 F. Supp. 2d 568, 577 (E.D. Pa. 2003) (citations and internal
                  quotation marks omitted).
                  The parties to this action have spent nearly four years litigating these claims. This litigation has included two class
                  certifications, several hearings on the court's estoppel rulings, more than a full year of discovery, and virtually
                  complete trial preparation. Whatever the disposition of the case on the merits, litigation likely would have continued
                  for some time thereafter through post-trial motions and appeal. See In re Ikon, 194 F.R.D. 166, 179 (E.D. Pa. 2000)
                  (""[T]he extremely large sums of money at issue almost guarantee that any outcome, whether by summary judgment
                  or trial, would be appealed.""). The time [**22]  and resources saved by the avoidance of these costs benefit all
                  parties. See In re Warfarin, 391 F.3d at 536 (""[I]t was inevitable that post-trial motions and appeals would not only
                  further prolong the litigation but also reduce the value of recovery to the class.""); In re Aetna, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
                  68, 2001 WL 20928, at *6 (noting that ""[t]he risk of delay could have deleterious effects on any future recovery due
                  to the time value of [*331]  money""). Thus we find that the complexity, expense, and likely duration of the litigation
                  favor settlement. See In re Prudential, 148 F.3d at 318 (""[T]he trial of this class action would be a long, arduous
                  process requiring great expenditures of time and money on behalf of both the parties and the court. The prospect of
                  such a massive undertaking clearly counsels in favor of settlement."").
                  2. The reaction of the class
                  HN9[
                  ] This factor ""attempts to gauge whether members of the class support the settlement."" Id. As stated above,
                  Notice of this Settlement was disseminated thoroughly by means of publication and first-class mail, and informed
                  potential Class Members of their rights to object to the Settlement and to request [**23]  exclusion from the Class.
                  The deadline for filing objections and requesting exclusion was originally February 7, 2007. As of the Final Approval
                  Hearing on April 18, 2007, no objections had been filed. (Pl. Mem. in Further Support at 7.) At the Final Approval
                  Hearing, the parties suggested and we agreed to extend the deadline for the filing of objections until May 3, 2007
                  for the additional 71 Class Members who had recently been sent their Notices of Settlement. As of May 6, 2007,
                  Class Counsel reported to the Court that no objections have been filed.
                  This total absence of objections argues in favor of the proposed Settlement. See Sala v. Nat'l R.R. Passenger
                  Corp., 721 F. Supp. 80, 83 (E.D. Pa. 1989) (""HN10[
                  ] The utter absence of objections from the class itself militates
                  strongly in favor of approval of the settlement.""). The lack of objections is also particularly notable in this case as
                  ""these are sophisticated businesses with, in some cases, large potential claims, and they could be expected to
                  object to a settlement they perceived as unfair or inadequate."" In re Warfarin Sodium Antitrust Litig., 212 F.R.D.

                  Class in this case strongly favors approval of the Settlement.

                  3. Stage of proceedings and amount of discovery completed
                  HN11[
                  ] This factor enables the Court to ""'determine whether counsel had an adequate appreciation of the merits
                  of the case before negotiating.'"" In re Cendant, 264 F.3d at 235 (quoting In re General Motors, 55 F.3d at 813). This
                  case was on the eve of trial, with all discovery having been completed, when settlement was reached through
                  arm's-length negotiations with the assistance of a mediator. (Pl. Corr. Mem. in Support at 11.) All of the pertinent
                  liability and damages issues had been analyzed by Plaintiff's counsel and experts. (Id. Prior to agreeing to a
                  settlement, the parties had taken 42 depositions, completed expert reports, and conducted extensive partial
                  summary judgment motion practice. (Id. 3M had also produced more than one million pages of documents for
                  review and copying; produced large amounts of computer date on tape sales, rebates, and margins covering at
                  least a seven year period, all of which was analyzed an used to support the expert reports submitted by
                  Bradburn's [**25]  testifying expert; and responded to several sets of Bradburn's interrogatories. (Id.) Third party
                  discovery in this matter took more than one year due to motions to compel and for protective orders filed in several
                  other district courts by third parties and 3M. (Id. In total, more than 60,000 pages of documents were produced by
                  third parties, and 3M and Bradburn took 10 depositions of third party witnesses. (Id. Moreover, prior to reaching the
                  Settlement, the parties had engaged in several face-to-face settlement negotiations, during which each side's
                  potential strengths and weaknesses [*332]  were presented and evaluated. (Id. We conclude, therefore, that the
                  parties had ""an adequate appreciation of the merits"" of this case at the time they negotiated the Settlement. In re
                  Cendant, 264 F.3d at 235 (citation omitted).
                  4. Risks of establishing liability
                  HN12[
                  ] This factor enables the Court to examine ""'what the potential rewards (or downside) of litigation might
                  have been had class counsel decided to litigate the claims rather than settle them.'"" In re Cendant, 264 F.3d at 237
                  (quoting In re General Motors, 55 F.3d at 814). ""When [**26]  considering this factor, the court should avoid
                  conducting a mini-trial. Rather the court may 'give credence to the estimation of the probability of success proffered
                  by class counsel, who are experienced with the underlying case, and the possible defenses which may be raised to
                  their causes of action.'"" In re Aetna, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68, 2001 WL 20928, at *9 (quoting In re Ikon, 194 F.R.D.
                  at 181).
                  Antitrust actions are among the most high risk, complex cases to litigate. Stop & Shop Supermarket Co. v.
                  Smithkline Beecham Corp., Civ. A. No. 03-4578, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9705, 2005 WL 1213926, at *11 (E.D. Pa.

                  Makers Antitrust Litig., 187 F.R.D. 465, 475 n.10 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) (""Recurrently, when some of the largest members

                  ] In order to succeed on its claim
                  that 3M violated § 2 of the Sherman Act, Bradburn ""must establish that [3M] possessed monopoly [**27]  power in
                  the [relevant] market and that it willfully acquired or maintained that power as distinguished from achieving growth
                  or development as a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident."" In re Warfarin, 391
                  F.3d at 529 n.11 (citing United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 570-71, 86 S. Ct. 1698, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778
                  (1966)).
                  Bradburn's risks of establishing liability in this case are diminished by the LePage's verdict and the Amended
                  Estoppel Order. However, the Amended Estoppel Order left many issues unresolved and Bradburn, therefore, still
                  faced numerous challenges in establishing 3M's liability in this case. For example, the Amended Estoppel Order left
                  intact Bradburn's obligation to prove injury and damages. Even if 3M had monopolized the market and harmed
                  competition for some period between 1993 and 1999, 3M could still argue that this did not affect purchases of
                  transparent and invisible tape. Additionally, the market definition rulings extended only into 1999. Therefore, the
                  market definition could be re-litigated for the period from October 13, 1999 to the present, and 3M had argued that
                  the market had substantially [**28]  changed since the time of the LePage's trial, and had become international. (Pl.
                  Corr. Mem in Support at 13-14.) Thus, while the Amended Estoppel Order provided some potential efficiencies at
                  trial, substantial trial risk remained for the Bradburn class. We concluded that, given these challenges, this factor
                  favors settlement.

                  5. Risks of establishing damages
                  ""Like the fourth factor, HN14[
                  ] 'this inquiry attempts to measure the expected value of litigating the action rather
                  than settling it at the current time.'"" In re Cendant, 264 F.3d at 238-39 (quoting In re General Motors, 55 F.3d at
                  816). In conducting this inquiry, we consider the ""potential damage award if the case were taken to trial against the
                  benefits of immediate settlement."" In re Warfarin, 212 F.R.D. at  [*333]  256 (citing In re Prudential, 148 F.3d at
                  319). Plaintiff's damage expert, Dr. Kamien, calculated overcharge damages to be in the range of $82,693,181 to
                  $96,449,176. (Pl. Corr. Mem. in Support at 15.) 3M's experts, however, contended that, contrary to Class Plaintiff's
                  overcharge damage theory, prices were declining or stable in real terms, and also [**29]  challenged other aspects
                  of Class Plaintiff's damage methodology. (Id. at 16.) Particularly in complex antitrust actions, the parties' efforts to
                  dispute damages at trial undoubtedly would result in a ""'battle of the experts,' with each side presenting its figures to
                  the jury and with no guarantee whom the jury would believe."" In re Cendant, 264 F.3d at 239. For these reasons,
                  we conclude that the risks of establishing damages weigh in favor of settlement in this case.
                  6. Risks of maintaining class action status through trial
                  HN15[
                  ] This factor allows the Court to weigh the possibility that, if a class were certified for trial in this case, it
                  would be decertified prior to trial. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) provides that ""a district court may decertify
                  or modify a class at any time during the litigation if it proves to be unmanageable, and proceeding to trial would
                  always entail the risk, even if slight, of decertification."" In re Cendant, 264 F.3d at 239 (citation and internal
                  quotations omitted). In this action, class certification was denied initially. See Bradburn Parent/Teacher Store, Inc.
                  v. 3M, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3347, 2004 WL 414047, at *1.  [**30]  The class was certified only after a second
                  motion for class certification. See Bradburn Parent/Teacher Store, Inc. v. 3M, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16193, 2004
                  WL 1842987, at *1. ""There will always be a 'risk' or possibility of decertification, and consequently the court can
                  always claim this factor weighs in favor of settlement."" In re Prudential, 148 F.3d at 321. Consequently, we find that
                  this factor weighs in favor of approving the Settlement.
                  7. Ability of defendants to withstand greater judgment
                  HN16[
                  ] This factor ""is concerned with whether the defendants could withstand a judgment for an amount
                  significantly greater than the Settlement."" In re Cendant, 264 F.3d at 240. As we noted in the Meijer case, ""3M, with
                  2005 annual net sales of $21.2 billion (3M 2005 Annual Report), likely can withstand a judgment significantly
                  greater than the Settlement Amount [of approximately $28 million]. Even so, this determination in itself does not
                  carry much weight in evaluating the fairness of the Settlement."" Meijer, Inc. v. 3M, Civ. A. No. 04-5871, 2006 U.S.
                  Dist. LEXIS 56744, 2006 WL 2382718, *16 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 14, 2006) (citing Perry v. FleetBoston Fin. Corp., 229
                  F.R.D. 105, 116 (E.D. Pa. 2005) [**31]  (""Fleet could certainly withstand a much larger judgment as it has
                  considerable assets. While that factor weighs against approving the settlement, this factor's importance is lessened
                  by the obstacles the class would face in establishing liability and damages."")). Accordingly, we find that this factor
                  disfavors settlement, albeit very slightly.
                  8 & 9. Range of reasonableness (in light of best possible recovery and risks of litigation)
                  HN17[
                  ] The eighth and ninth Girsh factors ""ask whether the settlement is reasonable in light of the best possible
                  recovery and the risks the parties would face if the case went to trial."" In re Aetna, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68, 2001
                  WL 20928, at *11 (citing In re Prudential, 148 F.3d at 322). In making this assessment, we compare ""'the present
                  value of the damages plaintiffs would likely recover if successful, appropriately discounted for the risk of not
                  prevailing'"" with ""'the amount of the proposed settlement.'"" In [*334]  re General Motors, 55 F.3d at 806 (quoting
                  Manual for Complex Litigation 2d § 30.44). The damages estimates should ""generate a range of reasonableness
                  (based on size of the proposed award and the uncertainty [**32]  inherent in these estimates) within which a district
                  court approving (or rejecting) a settlement will not be set aside."" Id. (citation omitted). ""The primary touchstone of
                  this inquiry is the economic valuation of the proposed settlement."" Id. ""In making this assessment, the evaluating
                  court must recognize that settlement represents a compromise in which the highest hopes for recovery are yielded
                  in exchange for certainty and resolution and guard against demanding too large a settlement based on the court's

                  own view of the merits of the litigation."" In re Aetna, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68, 2001 WL 20928, at *11 (citing In re
                  General Motors, 55 F.3d at 806).
                  Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, Class Members will receive immediate monetary relief in accordance with
                  their relevant purchases of 3M tape, without undertaking the risks, costs, and delays of further litigation. The
                  proposed Settlement provides between approximately 41 and 48 percent of the damages calculated by Plaintiff's
                  expert economist. (Pl. Corr. Mem. in Support at 19.) This result is significantly above the typical antitrust settlement,
                  and courts routinely grant approval to settlements that involve [**33]  recoveries that represent a much lower
                  percentage of the actual damages. See Stop & Shop Supermarket Co., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9705, 2005 WL
                  1213926, *9 (holding that a recovery of 11.4 percent of actual damages ""compares favorably with the settlements
                  reached in other complex class action lawsuits""); Nichols v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., Civ. A. No. 00-6222, 2005
                  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7061, 2005 WL 950616, *16 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 22, 2005) (approving settlement for between 9.3 and
                  13.9 percent of actual damages); In re Ravisent Techs., Inc. Sec. Litig., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6680, 2005 WL
                  906361, *9 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 18, 2005) (finding that 6 to 12 percent of potential recovery generally reasonable); Lazy

                  percent of potential recovery).
                  The Settlement Consideration also represents more than 18.5 percent of 3M sales to Class Members. (Pl. Corr.
                  Mem. in Support at 19.) This is also far above settlements approved in other cases. See Meijer Inc. v. 3M, Civ. A.
                  No. 04-5871, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56744, 2006 WL 2382718, *20 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 14, 2006) (approving settlement
                  where the settlement fund represented [**34]  2% of the sales to class members, and which the Court observed
                  ""compares favorably with other class action antitrust settlements""); In re Auto. Refinishing Paint Antitrust Litig., 2004
                  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29161, 2004 WL 1068807 at *2 (settlement approved for 2% of sales). Moreover, there is no
                  indication that this Settlement Amount has been reached inappropriately, or should otherwise be considered
                  suspect; both parties have demonstrated willingness and ability to litigate this action, have engaged in mediation,
                  and have reached an agreement that provides Class Members with monetary relief that is immediate, significant,
                  and in line with or better than other comparable settlements. See In re Aetna, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68, 2001 WL
                  20928, at *11 (""Additionally, the hallmarks of a questionable settlement are absent. Plaintiffs will receive a
                  significant monetary settlement, and there is no suggestion of collusion between Defendants and Plaintiffs'
                  counsel."") (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, we find that the Settlement represents a reasonable
                  compromise in light of both the best possible recovery and the risks of litigation.
                  Thus, of the nine Girsh factors, we find that only factor seven (the [**35]  ability of 3M to withstand greater
                  judgment) weighs against approving the Settlement. This [*335]  one factor is outweighed by the other Girsh factors
                  favoring the Settlement. We, therefore, conclude that the Settlement Agreement is fair, adequate, and reasonable.
                  D. Fairness of the Distribution Plan
                  In addition to analyzing the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the Court must also examine the fairness of the
                  proposed Distribution Plan. HN18[
                  ] ""'Approval of a plan of allocation of a settlement fund in a class action is
                  governed by the same standards of review applicable to approval of the settlement as a whole: the distribution plan
                  must be fair, reasonable and adequate.'"" In re Ikon, 194 F.R.D. at 184 (quoting In re Computron Software Inc., 6 F.
                  Supp. 2d 313, 321 (D.N.J. 1998)). ""Courts generally consider plans of allocation that reimburse class members
                  based on the type and extent of their injuries to be reasonable."" In re Aetna, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68, 2001 WL
                  20928, at *12 (citing In re Ikon, 194 F.R.D. at 184).
                  The proposed Distribution Plan allocates the Settlement Fund among Class Members based upon their pro rata
                  share of the Class's [**36]  total transparent tape purchases from 3M during the damage period, net of invoice
                  adjustments and rebates paid as of the date of the settlement. (Hunter Decl. PP 8-10.) The Distribution Plan
                  provides a straightforward method for determining each Class Member's pro rata share of the net Settlement Fund.
                  The calculations and distribution methodology were overseen by the Leaf Group, consulting experts on computer
                  data and damages issues throughout this litigation, as well as Class Counsel and PDC. (Hunter Decl. P 2, Bithell
                  Decl. P 6.) We find that the proposed distribution methodology is fair, reasonable, and adequate. See In re
                  Remeron Direct Purchaser Antitrust Litig., Civ. A. No. 03-0085, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27013, 2005 WL 3008808,

                  inherently reasonable.""); see also In re Corel Corp. Inc. Securities Litig., 293 F. Supp. 2d 484, 493 (E.D. Pa.  Jan. 4.

                  type and extent of their injuries to be reasonable."").
                  In sum, we find that the content and dissemination of Notice in this case satisfies the requirements of due process
                  and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and we also find that the Settlement Agreement is fair, adequate and
                  reasonable in light of all relevant considerations. We therefore grant final approval to the Settlement. We further find
                  that the proposed Distribution Plan is fair, reasonable and adequate, and approve the Plan.
                  III. APPLICATION FOR ATTORNEYS' FEES, EXPENSES, AND INCENTIVE AWARD
                  Class Counsel request that the Court grant the following, to be distributed from the common fund established by the
                  Settlement: (1) a class representative incentive award of $75,000 to Bradburn/Teacher Store; (2) an award of
                  attorneys' fees of $13,912,500, or 35% of the Settlement common fund; and (3) an award of costs and expenses of
                  $1,011,375 for reimbursement of expenses incurred by counsel on behalf of the class.

                  HN19[
                  ] ""Attorneys who create a common fund for the benefit of a class are [**38]  entitled  [*336]  to
                  reimbursement of reasonable litigation expenses from the fund."" In re Aetna, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68, 2001 WL
                  20928, at *13 (citing In re Ikon, 194 F.R.D. at 192). Class Counsel request reimbursement for expenses in the
                  amount of $ 1,011,375. This consists of $ 983,463 for expenses that have been incurred since the beginning of this
                  litigation in 2002, and includes costs incurred in connection with the prosecution and settlement of the litigation for
                  items such as: expert fees; travel; document production; depositions and transcripts; settlement administration;
                  mediation; document storage; on-line legal research; and class notice. (Baruch Decl. P 6). The remainder of the
                  requested expenses, i.e. $27,912, represents estimated future expenses. (Baruch Decl. PP 6-8, Second Baruch
                  Decl. PP 2-3.) The estimated future expenses consist of $23,662 for claims administration, $3,500 in travel
                  expenses for the April 18, 2007 Hearing, and $750 in off-site document storage through June 2007. (Baruch Decl. P
                  8.) As Class Counsel notified Class Members that they would seek reimbursement of up to $1,400,000 in litigation
                  and settlement expenses, (Pl. Corr. Mem. in Support, Ex.  [**39]  B at 3.), the total amount of expenses for which
                  they now seek reimbursement is within that amount. Moreover, no objections have been filed in response to this
                  request for reimbursement. Accordingly, we find that the litigation expenses enumerated by Class Counsel are
                  reasonable and we grant Class Counsel's request for reimbursement. See In re Remeron End-Payor Antitrust Litig.,
                  Civ. A. No. 02-2007, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27011, at *92 (D.N.J. Sept. 13, 2005) (approving reimbursement of
                  expenses which ""reflect costs expended for purposes of prosecuting this litigation, including substantial fees for
                  experts; substantial costs associated with creating and maintaining an electronic document database; travel and
                  lodging expenses; copying costs; and the costs of deposition transcripts"").
                  B. Attorneys' Fees
                  HN20[
                  ] ""District courts approving class action settlements must thoroughly review fee petitions for fairness.
                  Although the ultimate decision as to the proper amount of attorneys' fees rests in the sound discretion of the court,
                  the court must set forth its reasoning clearly."" In re Aetna, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68, 2001 WL 20928, at *13
                  (citations omitted). Thorough review of fee [**40]  arrangements is critical in the context of a class action settlement
                  because of ""'the danger . . . that the lawyers might urge a class settlement at a low figure or on a less-than optimal
                  basis in exchange for red-carpet treatment for fees,'"" In re General Motors, 55 F.3d at 820 (quoting Weinberger v.
                  Great N. Nekoosa Corp., 925 F.2d 518, 524 (1st Cir. 1991)), and because the parties to the action might lack
                  sufficient incentive to object to the arrangement. In re AT&T Corp. Sec. Litig., 455 F.3d 160, 168 (3d Cir. 2006).

                  HN21[
                  ] Courts typically use one of two methods for assessing attorneys' fees, either the percentage of recovery
                  method or the lodestar method. In re Rite Aid Corp. Sec. Litig., 396 F.3d 294, 300 (3d Cir. 2005). We utilize the
                  percentage of recovery method in this case as it is ""generally favored in common fund cases because it allows
                  courts to award fees from the fund 'in a manner that rewards counsel for success and penalizes it for failure.'"" Id.
                  (quoting In re Prudential, 148 F.3d at 333). As the Third Circuit recommends, however, we use the lodestar method
                  ""to 'cross-check' the [**41]  percentage fee award,"" in order to verify that the fee award is not excessive. Id. at 305
                  (citing In re Prudential, 148 F.3d at 333).
                  Class Counsel have requested attorneys' fees of $ 13,912,500, or 35% of the Settlement  [*337]  Fund. HN22[
                  ]
                  When a district court uses the percentage of recovery method, it ""first calculates the percentage of the total
                  recovery that the proposal would allocate to attorneys fees by dividing the amount of the requested fee by the total
                  amount paid out by the defendant; it then inquires whether that percentage is appropriate based on the
                  circumstances of the case."" In re Cendant, 264 F.3d at 256. ""The percentage will be based on the net settlement
                  fund after deducting the costs of litigation."" In re Aetna, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68, 2001 WL 20928, at *14 (citing In
                  re Ikon, 194 F.R.D. at 193); see also Meijer, Inc., 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56744, 2006 WL 2382718, at *19
                  (calculating the percentage recovery based on the net settlement fund). In this case, Class Counsel appear to have
                  erroneously calculated the requested award based on the gross settlement amount, rather then the net settlement
                  amount. Because Class Counsel [**42]  argue in their Corrected Application for Attorneys' Fee, Expenses, and
                  Class Representative Award that 35% of the settlement amount is reasonable under the percentage of recovery
                  method of assessing attorneys' fees, we will consider whether the requested attorney award of 35% of the net
                  settlement amount (i.e. $ 13,558,518) is reasonable.
                  In Gunter v. Ridgewood Energy Corp., 223 F.3d 190 (3d Cir. 2000), HN23[
                  ] the Third Circuit directed district
                  courts to consider the following seven factors when determining whether a percentage of recovery fee award is
                  reasonable:
                  (1) the size of the fund created and the number of persons benefitted;
                  (2) the presence or absence of substantial objections by members of the class to the settlement terms and/or
                  the fees requested by counsel;
                  (3) the skill and efficiency of the attorneys involved; (4) the complexity and duration of the litigation; (5) the risk
                  of nonpayment;
                  (6) the amount of time devoted to the case by plaintiffs' counsel; and
                  (7) the awards in similar cases.
                  Id. at 195 n.1; see also In re Rite Aid, 396 F.3d at 301. ""Since this is a flexible and fact-driven determination,  [**43]
                  "" In re Aetna, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68, 2001 WL 20928, at *14, district courts are not limited to the Gunter factors
                  in their analysis of the fee request's reasonableness. As the Third Circuit recently noted:
                  HN24[
                  ] This list [of Gunter factors] was not intended to be exhaustive. . . . In Prudential, we noted three other
                  factors that may be relevant and important to consider: (1) the value of benefits accruing to class members
                  attributable to the efforts of class counsel as opposed to the efforts of other groups, such as government
                  agencies conducting investigations; (2) the percentage fee that would have been negotiated had the case been
                  subject to a private contingent fee agreement at the time counsel was retained; and (3) any 'innovative' terms
                  of the settlement. . . . In reviewing an attorneys' fees award in a class action settlement, a district court should
                  consider the Gunter factors, the Prudential factors, and any other factors that are useful and relevant with
                  respect to the particular facts of the case.
                  In re AT&T Corp. Secs. Litig., 455 F.3d 160, 2006 WL 2021033, at *4 (citing In re Prudential, 148 F.3d at 338-340).
                  While the district courts should ""engage in [**44]  robust assessments of the fee award reasonableness factors
                  when evaluating a fee request,"" In re Rite Aid, 396 F.3d at 302, these factors ""'need not be applied in a formulaic
                  way' because each case is different, 'and in certain cases, one factor may outweigh the rest.'"" In re AT&T, 455 F.3d
                  160, 2006 WL 2021033, at *4 (quoting In re Rite Aid, 396 F.3d at 301); see also In re Cendant Corp. PRIDES Litig.,

                  243 F.3d 722, 736 (3d Cir. 2001) (""[A] district court may not rely on a formulaic application of the appropriate [*338]
                  range in awarding fees but must consider the relevant circumstances of the particular case."").
                  1. Size of fund created and number of persons benefitted
                  Class Counsel have obtained for the class a common fund of $39,750,000 in cash, less expenses, attorneys' fees,
                  and incentive award, benefitting more than 3000 Class Members. As discussed above, the Settlement
                  Consideration represents 18.5 percent of what Class Members paid to 3M for invisible and transparent tape during
                  the damage period, and amounts to 41 to 48 percent of the total single damages claimed by the class. As the
                  Settlement does not require Class Members [**45]  to file proof of claim forms, all Class Members that can be
                  located will receive a distribution from the common fund. Therefore, this factor weighs in favor of finding that the
                  percentage of the settlement fund requested is appropriate.
                  2. Presence or absence of substantial objections by members of the class
                  There have been no objections either to the Settlement Agreement or to the requested attorneys' fees. The
                  absence of objections to the requested attorneys' fees in this case is particularly notable given the sophisticated
                  nature of the absent Class Members. See In re Remeron Direct Purchaser Antitrust Litig., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
                  27013, 2005 WL 3008808, at *13 n.1 (""When a class is comprised of sophisticated business entities that can be
                  expected to oppose any request for attorney fees they find unreasonable, the lack of objections 'indicates the
                  appropriateness of the [fee] request.'"" (alteration in original) (quoting Cimarron Pipeline Constr., Inc. v. National
                  Council on Compensation Ins., Civ. A. Nos. 89-822, 89-1186, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19969, 1993 WL 355466, at

                  is relatively small and consists of sophisticated businesses, not one member of the Settlement Class objected to the
                  requested fee""). We find that the total absence of objections to the requested fees weighs in favor of finding that the
                  percentage of the settlement fund requested is appropriate. See In re Linerboard Antitrust Litig., MDL No. 1261,
                  2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10532, 2004 WL 1221350, at *5 (E.D. Pa. June 2, 2004) (""The absence of objections
                  supports approval of the Fee Petition.""); In re Rent-Way Secs. Litig., 305 F. Supp. 2d 491, 515 (W.D. Pa. 2003)

                  reasonableness of Lead Counsels' request.""); In re Aetna, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68, 2001 WL 20928, at *15 (""[T]he
                  Class members' view of the attorneys' performance, inferred from the lack of objections to the fee petition, supports
                  the fee award."").
                  3. Skill and efficiency of the attorneys involved
                  HN25[
                  ] The skill and efficiency of Class Counsel are ""measured by the quality of the result achieved, the
                  difficulties faced, the speed and efficiency of the recovery,  [**47]  the standing, experience and expertise of the
                  counsel, the skill and professionalism with which counsel prosecuted the case and the performance and quality of
                  opposing counsel."" In re Ikon, 194 F.R.D. at 194 (citation omitted). Class Counsel are experienced in complex class
                  action litigation (Baruch Decl. P 3), and have obtained a significant settlement for the Class despite the complexity
                  and challenges of this case. Accordingly, this factor favors finding that the percentage of the settlement fund
                  requested is appropriate.
                  4. Complexity and duration of the litigation
                  As mentioned above, courts have stated that antitrust class action are perhaps the  [*339]  most complex cases to
                  litigate. Stop & Shop Supermarket Co., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9705, 2005 WL 1213926, *11; In re Linerboard
                  Antitrust Litig., 296 F. Supp. 2d 568, 577 (E.D. Pa. 2003). This action was filed more than four years ago, and
                  involved litigation over class certification and collateral estoppel, expert testimony on both class certification and the
                  merits, and numerous depositions. At the time of settlement, the parties had submitted pretrial memoranda,
                  completed expert depositions, and were ready [**48]  for trial. Though Plaintiff benefitted from our estoppel ruling,
                  there remained complex challenges in establishing liability and damages in this case, as discussed above.
                  Accordingly, this factor weighs in favor of finding that the percentage of the settlement fund requested is
                  appropriate.
                  513 F. Supp. 2d 322, *337; 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35899, **44
                  
                  
                  5. Risk of nonpayment
                  Class Counsel's compensation for their services in this case was wholly contingent on the success of the litigation.
                  (Hazard Decl. P 25.) Given the risks of establishing liability and damages discussed above, the possibility of non-
                  payment has been present throughout this litigation. Accordingly, this factor weighs in favor of finding that the
                  percentage of the settlement fund requested is appropriate.
                  6. Amount of time devoted to the case by Plaintiffs' counsel
                  Class Counsel spent more than four years, more than 9,000 hours in attorney time, and approximately 2,000 hours
                  in paralegal time working on this case. (Baruch Decl. P 2.) Due to the significant number of hours devoted to this
                  litigation and the duration of this litigation, this factor weighs in favor of finding that the percentage of the settlement
                  fund requested is appropriate.
                  7. Awards in similar  [**49]   cases
                  HN26[
                  ] This factor requires the Court to compare the percentage of recovery requested as a fee in this case
                  against the percentage of recovery awarded as a fee in other common fund cases in which the percentage of
                  recovery method, rather than the lodestar method, was used. In re Cendant Corp. PRIDES Litig., 243 F.3d at 737.
                  Class Counsel request attorneys' fees that produce a percentage of recovery of 35%. This percentage of recovery
                  is slightly above the typical range of common fund attorneys' award in securities and antitrust litigation. See 4
                  Herbert B. Newberg & Alba Conte, Newberg on Class Actions § 14:6 (4th ed. 2006) (""In the normal range of
                  common fund recoveries in securities and antitrust suits, common fee awards fall in the 20 to 33 per cent range."").
                  In In re Rite Aid, the Third Circuit noted three studies which found that fee awards ranging between 25-33% of the
                  common fund were not unusual. In re Rite Aid, 396 F.3d at 303 (""[O]ne study of securities class action settlements
                  over $10 million . . . found an average percentage fee recovery of 31%; a second study by the Federal Judicial
                  Center of all class actions resolved [**50]  or settled over a four-year period . . . found a median percentage
                  recovery range of 27-30%; and a third study of class action settlements between $100 million and $200 million . . .
                  found recoveries in the 25-30% range were 'fairly standard.'"") (citations omitted). Several decisions have awarded
                  one-third of the fund as a fee though the settlements in those cases were substantially less successful than here.
                  See Ravisent Technologies, Civ. A. No. 001014, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6680, 2005 WL 906361, *9, *10-*12 (E.D.
                  Pa. Apr. 18, 2005) (granting one-third of the settlement fund in attorneys' fees where the settlement fund totaled
                  12.2% of the maximum possible damages); In re Gen. Instrument Sec. Litig., 209 F. Supp. 2d 423, 431, 433-
                  34 [*340]  (E.D. Pa. 2001) (granting one-third of settlement fund in attorneys' fees where settlement fund totaled
                  11% of damages). Because the requested fee percentage is only slightly higher than the percentages awarded in
                  those cases and the settlement in this case provides a common fund that represents a much higher percentage
                  share of the Class Members' damages than did the common funds in those cases, this factor supports a finding that
                  the [**51]  percentage of the settlement fund requested is appropriate.
                  We conclude that each of the seven Gunter factors favors the requested award of attorneys' fees in this case.
                  Accordingly, we find that, under the Gunter analysis, the percentage of recovery requested as attorneys' fees in this
                  case is reasonable.
                  8. The Prudential factors
                  Our assessment of Class Counsel's request for attorneys' fees in light of the three Prudential factors is consistent
                  with our finding of reasonableness under the Gunter factors. HN27[
                  ] The first Prudential factor is intended to
                  measure whether ""the entire value of the benefits accruing to class members is properly attributable to the efforts of
                  class counsel,"" In re AT&T, 455 F.3d 160, 2006 WL 2021033, at *11, or if some of those benefits are more properly
                  attributed ""to the efforts of other groups, such as government agencies conducting investigations."" 455 F.3d 160,
                  [WL] at *4 (citing In re Prudential, 148 F.3d at 338). While Class Counsel were not aided in their prosecution of this
                  case by a government investigation, Class Counsel did have the benefit of prior litigation which assigned liability to
                  3M for the same sort of [**52]  anti-competitive conduct that has been alleged here. Compare Stop & Shop
                  Supermarket Co., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9705, 2005 WL 1213926, at *12 (""[T]his action was riskier than many
                  other antitrust class actions because there was no prior government investigation, or prior finding of civil or criminal
                  513 F. Supp. 2d 322, *339; 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35899, **48
                  
                  
                  liability based on antitrust violations, in this case.""). However, in comparison to the Meijer litigation, which similarly
                  benefitted from the prior litigation and settled for an amount equaling 2 percent of the class members purchases,
                  the proposed Settlement Consideration in this action represents 18.5 percent of the Class Members purchases.
                  Consequently, we find that this factor supports the conclusion that the percentage of recovery requested by Class
                  Counsel for attorneys' fees in this case is reasonable.
                  As for the second Prudential factor, we find that a percentage of recovery of 35 percent is comparable to the likely
                  ""percentage fee that would have been negotiated had the case been subject to a private contingent fee agreement
                  at the time counsel was retained."" In re AT&T, 455 F.3d 160, 2006 WL 2021033, at *4 (citing In re Prudential, 148
                  F.3d at 340). See  [**53]   In re Remeron, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27013, 2005 WL 3008808, *16 (""Attorneys
                  regularly contract for contingent fees between 30% and 40% with their clients in non-class, commercial litigation."");
                  see also In re Ikon, 194 F.R.D. at 194 (""[I]n private contingency fee cases, particularly in tort matters, plaintiffs'
                  counsel routinely negotiate agreements providing for between thirty and forty percent of any recovery."").
                  With respect to the third Prudential factor, the Settlement Agreement here contains no particularly ""innovative""
                  terms to argue in favor of the requested award of attorneys' fees. In re AT&T, 455 F.3d 160, 2006 WL 2021033, at
                  *4 (citing In re Prudential, 148 F.3d at 339).
                  In sum, we find that both the Prudential factors and the Gunter factors support our conclusion that the percentage of
                  recovery requested by Class Counsel for attorneys' fees in this case is reasonable.
                  [*341]  9. Lodestar cross-check
                  HN28[
                  ] The Third Circuit has suggested that, in addition to reviewing the fee award reasonableness factors, ""it is
                  'sensible' for district courts to 'cross-check' the percentage fee award against the 'lodestar' method."" In re Rite Aid,
                  396 F.3d at 305 [**54]  (citing In re Prudential, 148 F.3d at 333). The lodestar is calculated by ""multiplying the
                  number of hours worked by the normal hourly rates of counsel. The court may then multiply the lodestar calculation
                  to reflect the risks of nonrecovery, to reward an extraordinary result, or to encourage counsel to undertake socially
                  useful litigation."" In re Aetna, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68, 2001 WL 20928, at *15 (citing In re Ikon, 194 F.R.D. at
                  195). ""The lodestar cross-check serves the purpose of alerting the trial judge that when the multiplier is too great,
                  the court should reconsider its calculation under the percentage-of-recovery method, with an eye toward reducing
                  the award."" In re Rite Aid, 396 F.3d at 306. The cross-check, however, ""does not trump the primary reliance on the
                  percentage of common fund method."" Id. at 307. Moreover, ""[t]he lodestar cross-check calculation need entail
                  neither mathematical precision nor bean-counting. The district courts may rely on summaries submitted by the
                  attorneys and need not review actual billing records. . . . [T]he resulting multiplier need not fall within any pre-
                  defined range, provided [**55]  that the District Court's analysis justifies the award."" Id. at 306-07 (footnotes and
                  citations omitted). It is appropriate for the court to consider the multipliers utilized in comparable cases. Id. at 307
                  n.17.
                  The total lodestar amount submitted to the Court by Class Counsel in this case is $5,476,800 for 10,957.5 hours of
                  attorney and paralegal time. (Baruch Decl. P 2.) The lodestar amount covers work done from the inception of the
                  claims in this action through January 18, 2007 and is calculated at current rates. (Id. The hours worked were
                  recorded contemporaneously in the books and records that the firms maintained in the ordinary course of business.
                  (Id. P 5.) The lodestar amount, taken against the requested fee award, results in a lodestar multiplier of
                  approximately 2.5.
                  HN29[
                  ] The Third Circuit has recognized that multipliers ""'ranging from one to four are frequently awarded in
                  common fund cases when the lodestar method is applied.'"" In re Cendant PRIDES, 243 F.3d at 742 (quoting In re
                  Prudential, 148 F.3d at 341). A multiplier of 2.5 is within this range of normal awards. See In re Linerboard, 2004
                  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10532, 2004 WL 1221350, at *16 [**56]  (noting that ""during 2001-2003, the average multiplier
                  approved in common fund class actions was 4.35""). Moreover, the lack of objections by this Class of sophisticated
                  parties to Class Counsel's request for fees supports the resulting multiplier. See Stop & Shop Supermarket Co.,
                  2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9705, 2005 WL 1213926, at *18 (noting that ""the high lodestar multiplier (15.6) which results
                  513 F. Supp. 2d 322, *340; 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35899, **52
                  
                  
                  from the Court's award of attorneys' fees in this case is neutralized . . . by the extraordinary support Plaintiffs have
                  shown for counsels' request for fees. Not one member of the Settlement Class, which is made up of approximately
                  90 sophisticated businesses, objected.""). Accordingly, we find that, given the facts of this case, the requested
                  lodestar multiplier of approximately 2.5 is acceptable and does not call for a reduction in Class Counsel's requested
                  attorneys' fees award.
                  Having thoroughly reviewed Class Counsel's request for attorneys' fees, we conclude that the percentage of
                  recovery requested by Class Counsel is reasonable, and that the lodestar cross-check is consistent with a finding of
                  reasonableness. Accordingly, we approve Class Counsel's request, and award Class Counsel [*342]  $
                  13,558,518 [**57]  in attorneys' fees to be paid from the Settlement Fund.
                  C. Incentive Award to Representative Plaintiffs
                  Bradburn has asked the Court to approve an incentive award in the amount of $75,000 to be paid from the
                  Settlement Fund, because Bradburn has spent a significant amount of its own time litigating this case for the absent
                  members of the Settlement Class. HN30[
                  ] ""'Courts routinely approve incentive awards to compensate named
                  plaintiffs for the services they provided and the risks they incurred during the course of the class action litigation.'""
                  Cullen v. Whitman Med. Corp., 197 F.R.D. 136, 145 (E.D. Pa. 2000) (quoting In re S. Ohio Corr. Facility, 175 F.R.D.
                  270, 272 (S.D. Ohio 1997)). It is particularly appropriate to compensate named representative plaintiffs with
                  incentive awards when they have actively assisted plaintiffs' counsel in their prosecution of the litigation for the
                  benefit of the class. See Tenuto v. Transworld Sys., Civ. A. No. 99-4228, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1764, 2002 WL
                  188569, at *5 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 31, 2002); see also In re Linerboard, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10532, 2004 WL 1221350,
                  at *18 (""Like the attorneys in this case, the class representatives [**58]  have conferred benefits on all other class
                  members and they deserve to be compensated accordingly."") (citing In re Plastic Tableware Antitrust Litig., Civ. A.
                  No. 94-3564, 2002 WL 188569 (E.D. Pa. Dec. 4, 1998)).
                  Bradburn has worked closely with Class Counsel throughout the four years of investigation, prosecution and
                  settlement of the claims in this litigation. (Corr. Application at 6.) Although it is a small business, Bradburn's
                  representatives underwent nine depositions, in addition to providing testimony at the class certification hearing, and
                  at the time of settlement, Bradburn's representatives were preparing to attend and give testimony at the trial. (Id. In
                  opposing class certification, 3M interrogated Bradburn at length on internal family quarrels and allegations of
                  misconduct, and claimed that these allegations disqualified Bradburn from being an adequate representative. (Id.
                  Furthermore, the Notice advised Class Members that Bradburn would apply for an incentive award up to this
                  amount and there were no objections to the award. See In re Remeron, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27013, 2005 WL
                  3008808, at *18. Accordingly, we approve the requested incentive award.
                  [**59] IV. CONCLUSION
                  For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the Settlement Agreement and Distribution Plan are fair, adequate and
                  reasonable, and we approve them. The Court further concludes that Class Counsel's requested reimbursement of
                  expenses in the amount of $1,011,375 and requested award of attorneys' fees representing 35 % of the Settlement
                  Fund (or $13,558,518) are fair and reasonable, and we approve them. Lastly, the Court approves Bradburn's
                  request to be paid an incentive award in the amount of $75,000.
                  An appropriate Order follows.

                  FINAL APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT
                  3.1. In its Order dated August 18, 2004, as confirmed and updated in the Preliminary Approval Order dated October
                  24, 2006, the Court certified the following Class which it now reconfirms:
                  all persons who directly purchased invisible or transparent tape from 3M Company between October 2, 1998
                  and February 10, 2006, who have not purchased, for resale under the Class Member's own label, any ""private
                  label"" invisible or transparent tape from 3M Company or any of 3M Company's competitors at any time from
                  October 2, 1988 to [**68]  February 10, 2006.
                  3.2 Attached hereto as Exhibit 1 is the list of Persons that have timely excluded themselves from the Class, in
                  response to  [*346]  the Notice of Pendency of Class Action dated November 29, 2004, which was provided
                  pursuant to the Court's Order dated November 12, 2004, and for which this Final Approval Order and Judgment has
                  no force or effect.
                  513 F. Supp. 2d 322, *344; 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35899, **64
                  
                  
                  3.3 The Court finds that the Notice and the Notice Plan were reasonably calculated to apprise the Class of all
                  material elements of the proposed settlement, constituted the best notice practicable under the circumstances, and
                  constituted due and sufficient notice. The Court finds that all Class Members were afforded the opportunity to object
                  to or comment on the Settlement, and to appear at the Final Approval Hearing. Accordingly, the Court determines
                  that all Class Members that have not excluded themselves from this Litigation are bound by this Final Approval
                  Order and Judgment.
                  3.4 The terms of the Settlement Agreement are hereby approved. The Court finds that the Settlement is fair,
                  reasonable and adequate and in the best interests of Plaintiff and the Class as a whole. The Settlement is the
                  product of arm's-length, serious [**69]  and informed negotiations among experienced and knowledgeable counsel.
                  The Settlement Agreement has the full force and effect of an order of this Court, and the Settling Parties are
                  directed to implement the Settlement Agreement in accordance with its terms and conditions.
                  3.5. The Distribution Plan is adjudged to be fair, reasonable and adequate and is hereby approved. Class Counsel
                  are directed to proceed with the implementation of the Distribution Plan.
                  3.6 No objections have been filed with respect to the Settlement and/or the Distribution Plan.
                  3.7. No part of the Settlement Consideration to be provided by 3M pursuant to the Settlement Agreement shall
                  constitute, nor shall it be construed or treated as constituting, a payment in lieu of treble damages, fines, penalties,
                  forfeitures or punitive recoveries under any state or federal laws, rules or regulations, or any other applicable statute
                  or provision.
                  IV.
                  DISMISSAL OF ACTION AND RELEASES OF CLAIMS
                  4.1. This action is dismissed with prejudice and, except as provided in paragraph 5.1 of this Order, without costs.
                  4.2. The Court hereby finds that the Released Claims which Plaintiff and the Class Members, on behalf [**70]  of
                  themselves and, with respect to individuals or individually owned businesses, on behalf of each of their heirs,
                  predecessors, successors, representatives or assigns, and, with respect to corporate entities, on behalf of each of
                  their parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, assignees, predecessors, successors, officers, directors, employees and
                  agents, shall fully and forever release, relinquish and discharge, by operation of this Final Approval Order and
                  Judgment are as defined in paragraph 2.13 of this Order, i.e.,
                  the release and discharge of 3M and each of its parents, subsidiaries, divisions, affiliates, assignors,
                  assignees, predecessors, successors, officers, directors, employees, agents and attorneys from any and all
                  claims asserted, or which could have been asserted, in the Litigation and any and all claims and potential
                  claims, demands, rights, liabilities and causes of action which have arisen or could arise hereafter, whether
                  known or unknown, whether asserted or that could have been or could hereafter be asserted by any Class
                  Member or any parent, affiliate or subsidiary of any of such Class Member against 3M and any of its
                  subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, officers,  [**71]  employees and/or [*347]  agents, concerning or relating in
                  any way to or arising in any way from any 3M discount, rebate, offer, promotion or other sales program or
                  practice (including without limitation, programs claimed to involve the bundling of products or volume or growth
                  rebates) concerning, including or relating in any way to the sale, promotion or distribution of invisible or
                  transparent tape for home or office use in effect from January 1, 1993 to September 5, 2006, including without
                  limitation claims arising under any federal and/or state antitrust laws, unfair competition laws, consumer
                  protection laws or deceptive trade practices acts or any similar statutory or common law provisions, but
                  excluding from this release claims relating to any alleged product defect, personal injury or breach of contract.
                  With the exception of claims relating to any alleged product defect, personal injury or breach of contract, this
                  release is a ""general release"" as that term is used in Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California
                  513 F. Supp. 2d 322, *346; 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35899, **68
                  
                  
                  and all Class Members that have not opted out will expressly waive any rights under that statute or any similar
                  law of any state or territory of the United States [**72]  or any principle of common law that is similar,
                  comparable, or equivalent to Section 1542 of the California Civil Code.
                  4.3. Upon the Effective Date, each Class Member, on behalf of itself and, with respect to individuals or individually
                  owned businesses, on behalf of each of their heirs, predecessors, successors, representatives or assigns, and, with
                  respect to corporate entities, on behalf of each of their parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, assignees, predecessors,
                  successors, officers, directors, employees and agents, shall have, shall be deemed to have and by operation of this
                  Judgment shall have fully, finally and forever released, relinquished and discharged 3M and its attorneys from any
                  and all Released Claims and shall be deemed to have covenanted and agreed not to sue 3M or its attorneys with
                  respect to the Released Claims.
                  4.4. Upon the Effective Date, 3M shall be deemed to have, and by operation of the Final Judgment shall have fully,
                  finally and forever released, relinquished and discharged each and all of the Plaintiff and Class Counsel from all
                  claims arising out of, relating to, or in connection with the institution, prosecution, assertion, settlement or
                  resolution [**73]  of the Litigation, other than claims for breach of the Settlement Agreement.
                  V.
                  FEES AND EXPENSES AND PLAINTIFF INCENTIVE AWARD
                  5.1 The Court approves the award of $13,558,518 to pay Class Counsel's fees plus $1,011,375 to reimburse Class
                  Counsel for payment of costs and expenses reasonably incurred in prosecuting and settling this action.
                  5.2 The Court approves the award of $75,000 as an incentive award for Plaintiff Bradburn Parent Teacher Store,
                  Inc.
                  5.3 No objections have been filed with respect to attorneys' fees and/or costs and expenses or with respect to
                  Plaintiff's incentive award.
                  5.4 The fee award represents a multiplier of approximately 2.5 of Class Counsel's lodestar of $5,476,800, which
                  multiplier is reasonable under the circumstances.
                  VI.
                  FINALITY OF JUDGMENT
                  6.1 The Court finds that this Final Approval Order and Judgment adjudicates all the claims, rights and liabilities of
                  the parties to the Settlement Agreement and is [*348]  final and shall be immediately appealable. Neither this Order
                  nor the Settlement Agreement shall constitute any evidence or admission of liability by 3M, nor shall either
                  document or any other document relating to the [**74]  Settlement be offered in evidence or used for any other
                  purpose in this or any other matter or proceeding except as may be necessary to consummate or enforce the
                  Settlement Agreement or the terms of this Order or if offered by 3M in responding to any action purporting to assert
                  Released Claims.
                  VII.
                  RETENTION OF JURISDICTION
                  513 F. Supp. 2d 322, *347; 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35899, **71
                  
                  
                  7.1. Without affecting the finality of this Order, the Court retains jurisdiction for the purposes of enforcing the terms
                  of the Settlement Agreement, to supervise the Settlement and to bar class members that have not opted out from
                  instituting, maintaining or otherwise pursuing claims encompassed within the Released Claims. The Court also
                  retains jurisdiction to allow any of the Settling Parties to apply to this Court at any time for such further orders and
                  directions as may be necessary and appropriate for the construction or carrying out of the Settlement Agreement
                  and this Final Approval Order and Judgment, for the modification of any of the provisions of this Final Approval
                  Order and Judgment, and for the enforcement of compliance herewith.
                  7.2. If this Settlement is terminated or reversed or overturned on appeal (except as to attorneys' fees,  [**75]
                  expenses, or incentive awards), then: (a) this Final Approval Order and Judgment will have no force or effect, and
                  all negotiations, proceedings, and statements made in connection with the Settlement Agreement will be without
                  prejudice to the right of any persons or entities, and shall not be deemed admissions as to any issue; (b) the
                  Settling Parties expressly reserve all of their rights and preserve all applicable defenses; and (c) the Settling Parties
                  shall be restored to their respective positions in this Litigation as of May 5, 2006, and proceed as if the Settlement
                  Agreement, and all other related orders and papers, had not been executed.
                  7.3. Under Rule 54 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court, in the interests of justice, there being no just
                  reason for delay, expressly directs the Clerk of the Court to enter this Final Approval Order and Judgment, and
                  hereby decrees that upon entry, it be deemed a final judgment and appealable with respect to all claims by Class
                  Members, in accordance with the terms of the Settlement Agreement.
                  7.4. The Court directs the Clerk of the Court to maintain for a period of five (5) years the record of those members
                  of the Class listed [**76]  on Exhibit 1 that timely excluded themselves from the Class.
                  So Ordered.
                  Dated this 14th day of May, 2007.

                  Reconsideration is proper where the moving party demonstrates one of three grounds: (1) an intervening change in
                  the controlling law; (2) the availability of new evidence that was not available when the court granted the motion for
                  summary judgment; or (3) the need to correct a clear error of law or fact or to prevent manifest injustice.

                  Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.S. § 2, sanctions those who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or
                  combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the
                  several states, or with foreign nations. Conduct that constitutes a ""price squeeze"" may violate the Sherman Act § 2.
                  It is generally accepted that a price squeeze involves a defendant who as a monopolist supplies the plaintiff at one
                  level (e.g., wholesale), competes at another (e.g., retail), and seeks to destroy the plaintiff by holding up the
                  wholesale price to the plaintiff while depressing the retail price to common customers.

                  ]  Filed Rate Doctrine, Public Utilities & Telecommunications Carriers
                  The filed rate doctrine bars antitrust suits based on rates that have been filed and approved by federal agencies
                  and state agencies. Under the filed rate doctrine, a plaintiff may not sue the supplier of electricity based on rates
                  that, though alleged to be the result of anticompetitive conduct, were filed with the federal agency responsible for
                  overseeing such rates. The doctrine operates as a defense to both federal and state law actions based on the
                  regulated rates. The form or details of the filed rate are not relevant to the application of the doctrine; the rate need
                  only be filed with an agency responsible for overseeing such rates.

                  There can be no doubt about the proposition that the federal antitrust laws are applicable to electrical utilities, and
                  past precedent cautions that the courts should be reluctant to imply antitrust immunity.

                  The United States Supreme Court has held that an implied exemption from the antitrust laws by regulatory
                  legislation would be found only if the exemption is necessary in order to make the regulatory act work and even
                  then only to the minimum extent necessary. Thus the filed rate doctrine may only apply as an exemption to the
                  antitrust laws to the minimum extent necessary for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the state Public
                  Utility Commission to fulfill their functions.

                  The United States Supreme Court has found that electric utilities that are regulated by the Federal Energy
                  Regulatory Commission are not immune from the antitrust laws, largely on the grounds that the regulation is not
                  sufficiently ""pervasive.""

                  ]  Antitrust & Trade Law, Exemptions & Immunities
                  A court's determination that a defendant is immune from the antitrust laws is an assertion of jurisdiction that is
                  separate from the calculation of damages, at which point the court has already determined that it has jurisdiction.
                  An award of damages in an antitrust suit based on a court's estimate of what a hypothetical rate would have been if
                  there had been no anticompetitive behavior does not prevent the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or the
                  Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission from performing its regulatory duties of approving or proscribing rates that a
                  regulated entity may charge. Additionally, such a justification for the filed rate doctrine is offset by the specifics
                  raised by a price squeeze claim where the alternative is to have no regulatory agency with the power to affect an
                  anticompetitive rate differential. Nothing indicates that a court should not fill in the gap created in such a situation.

                  Wholesale electricity rates are controlled by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC); the retail rates
                  are controlled by the state Public Utility Commission (PUC). Neither FERC nor the PUC has jurisdiction over the
                  interaction between wholesale and retail rates; each agency has authority over only one end of the alleged price
                  squeeze. Though FERC can take the possibility of a price squeeze into account when reviewing the
                  reasonableness of a rate, it can do nothing to force a state commission to change the retail electricity rates. The
                  same truth exists for the PUC. Plus, the federal and state regulatory systems do not work in perfect harmony, so it
                  is possible for a utility to time or manipulate its rate filings in a way that causes a price squeeze. Even though FERC
                  and the PUC might review rates for the possibility of a price squeeze, because simultaneous approval of retail and
                  wholesale rates by the agencies is not required and rates can change with a later filing, it is very difficult for the
                  agencies to predict a price squeeze.

                  There is no indication that district court antitrust review of rates, at least with regard to price squeeze allegations
                  involving the interaction of state and federally approved rates, is repugnant to any regulatory scheme. Though the
                  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission may lower wholesale rates and the the Pennsylvania Public Utility
                  Commission may raise retail rates to compensate for a price squeeze, neither entity has the power to adjust both
                  rates at the same time. Nor does the court have the power to revise agency-approved rates. Applying antitrust
                  review to the interaction between these two rates is not inconsistent with the federal and state regulatory regimes
                  because the resulting interaction falls outside the regulatory scheme."
