                  The Selling Debtors further reserve the right, in their reasonable business judgment, at any time after the Bid
                  Deadline and prior to the conclusion  [*292] of the Auction, to invite parties that have not previously submitted
                  written offers to do so such that they may be considered pursuant to the procedures set forth herein.
                  The Selling Debtors shall provide counsel to the Creditors' Committee, Second Lien Group and DIP Lenders with
                  copies of bids, and a list of parties submitting bids, as soon as is reasonably practicable after the Bid Deadline.
                  7. Determination of Qualifying Bids.
                  The Selling Debtors shall, by no later than 5:00 p.m. (prevailing eastern time), August 10, 2007 (the ""Bid
                  Determination Deadline""):
                  (a) determine in their reasonable business judgment whether a written offer is a Qualifying Bid;
                  (b) notify each party submitting a written offer whether that written offer is a Qualifying Bid; and
                  (c) provide copies of each Qualifying Bidders' APA to the Stalking Horse Bidder and all Qualifying Bidders.
                  The Selling Debtors shall consult with the Creditors' Committee regarding their determination of Qualifying Bidders.
                  The Selling Debtors will provide to counsel for the Creditors' Committee, Second Lien Group and DIP Lenders the
                  list of Qualifying Bidders as soon as is reasonably practicable after the Bid Determination Deadline.
                  The  [*293] Selling Debtors reserve the right, at any time after the Bid Deadline and prior to the commencement of
                  the Auction, to request parties submitting written offers that were determined not to be Qualifying Bids to amend
                  their written offers such that those amended written offers may be considered as Qualifying Bids. The Selling
                  Debtors will consult with the Creditors' Committee regarding any such requests.
                  8. Auction Procedures.
                  In the event that the Selling Debtors receive one or more Qualifying Bids, the Auction shall take place at 10:00 a.m.
                  (prevailing eastern time), August 14, 2007, at the offices of Kirkland & Ellis LLP, Citigroup Center, 153 East 53rd
                  Street, New York, New York 10022, or at any such other place, date and time as may be designated in writing by
                  the Selling Debtors. Subject to § 15 hereof, the Auction shall be governed by the following procedures:
                  (a) the Stalking Horse Bidder and each Qualifying Bidder shall appear in person or by telephone, or through a
                  duly authorized representative;
                  (b) the Stalking Horse Bidder and each Qualifying Bidder shall be required to confirm that it has not engaged in
                  any collusion with respect to the bidding or the sale (except for joint  [*294] bidding arrangements disclosed to
                  the Selling Debtors pursuant to § 5(n));
                  (c) only the Stalking Horse Bidder and Qualifying Bidders shall be entitled to submit bids;
                  (d) bidding shall commence at the amount of the highest Qualifying Bid submitted prior to the Auction;
                  (e) the Selling Debtors reserve the right to determine, in their reasonable business judgment, whether a bid
                  constitutes a higher and better offer than previous bids, based upon factors including, but not limited to, the
                  amount of the purchase price, the form of consideration being offered, the likelihood of the bidder's ability to
                  close a transaction and the timing thereof, the number, type and nature of any changes to the APA requested,
                  and the net benefit to the Selling Debtors' estates;
                  (f) bids must be at least $ 750,000 (the ""Auction Bid Increment"") higher than the outstanding highest bid
                  (though, as discussed in § 15 hereof, the Selling Debtors retain the right to modify, in their business judgment,
                  the bid increment during the Auction); provided however, that any further bid made by the Stalking Horse
                  Bidder shall include a credit (or Purchase Price reduction) equal to the Breakup Fee plus the Maximum
                  Expense Reimbursement  [*295] (the sum of which is the ""Credit Bid Amount""), such that any such bid by the
                  Stalking Horse shall result in an increase in value to the Selling Debtors equal to the Auction Bid Increment. 3
                  3 For example, if a Qualifying Bidder bids $ 200,000,000, the Stalking Horse may then bid $ 200,750,000, which includes the
                  Credit Bid Amount, and which will result in an increase in value to the Selling Debtors equal to the Auction Bid Increment.
                  
                  
                  This same Credit Bid Amount shall reduce the Purchase Price in the event that the Stalking Horse Bidder is the
                  Prevailing Bidder;
                  (g) the Stalking Horse Bidder and Qualifying Bidders may make additional modifications to the Stalking Horse
                  APA, APA or Modified APA, as applicable, during the Auction, provided, however, that any such modifications,
                  on an aggregate basis, shall not be less favorable to the Selling Debtors as determined by the Selling Debtors
                  in their reasonable business judgment;
                  (h) the Selling Debtors intend to continue the Auction until there is only one bid that, in their reasonable
                  business judgment, is the highest or best offer, as the case may be (the ""Prevailing Bid""--the bidder submitting
                  such Prevailing Bid, the ""Prevailing Bidder,"" shall have such rights and responsibilities as set forth in the
                  applicable APA or Modified APA); provided that the Debtors will consult with the Creditors' Committee
                  regarding the selection of the Prevailing Bidder;
                  (i) the Selling Debtors may, at  [*296] any time prior to the commencement of the Sale Hearing (defined below),
                  continue the Auction from time to time, adjourn the Auction, and re-open the Auction; and
                  (j) the Stalking Horse Bidder and each Qualifying Bidder participating in the Auction shall be deemed to have
                  consented to the core jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court.
                  9. No Qualifying Bids.
                  If no Qualifying Bid is submitted by the Bid Deadline, the Selling Debtors may, but are not required, in their
                  reasonable business judgment, cancel the Auction and accept the Stalking Horse Bid (in which case, the Prevailing
                  Bid shall be the Stalking Horse Bid, and the Prevailing Bidder shall be the Stalking Horse Bidder). Prior to
                  announcing any such cancellation, the Selling Debtors shall consult with the Creditors' Committee regarding that
                  cancellation.
                  10. Announcement of Prevailing Bidder and Execution of Agreements.
                  The Selling Debtors reserve the right to announce the identity of the Prevailing  [*297] Bidder at any time prior to
                  the commencement of the Sale Hearing. Within one (1) calendar day after the announcement of the identity of the
                  Prevailing Bidder by the Selling Debtors, the Prevailing Bidder shall complete and execute all agreements,
                  contracts, instruments or other documents evidencing and containing the terms and conditions upon which the
                  Prevailing Bid was made.
                  11. Selling Debtors' Acceptance of Prevailing Bid Subject to Bankruptcy Court Approval.
                  The Prevailing Bid will be subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court at the Sale Hearing. The Selling Debtors
                  shall be deemed to have accepted the Prevailing Bid only when the Prevailing Bid has been approved by the
                  Bankruptcy Court. The Selling Debtors shall use reasonable efforts to obtain Bankruptcy Court approval of the
                  Prevailing Bid in the form of the sale order attached as Exhibit I to the APA (the ""Sale Order"").
                  12. Sale Hearing.
                  A hearing (the ""Sale Hearing"") will be held to approve the sale of the Sale Assets to the Prevailing Bidder before the
                  Honorable Kevin J. Carey in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, 824 North Market
                  Street, 5th Floor, Wilmington, Delaware 19801, at 1:30 p.m. (prevailing  [*298] eastern time), August 15, 2007, at
                  such time thereafter as counsel may be heard, or at such other time as the Bankruptcy Court may determine. The
                  Sale Hearing may be adjourned from time to time without further notice to creditors or parties-in-interest other than
                  by announcement of the adjournment in open court on the date scheduled for the Sale Hearing. The Prevailing
                  Bidder and Backup Bidder (defined below), if any, should be represented by counsel at the Sale Hearing.
                  13. Consummation of the Purchase.
                  (a) Closing Deadline.
                  
                  
                  The Prevailing Bidder shall, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Prevailing Bidder's APA,
                  consummate the sale transaction contemplated by the Prevailing Bid (the ""Purchase"") on or before the Closing
                  Deadline (defined in § 5(d) above). Consistent with APA § 8.4, the Prevailing Bidder and the Selling Debtors shall
                  each use their commercially reasonable best efforts to: (i) take all actions necessary or appropriate to consummate
                  the transactions contemplated by the APA and (ii) cause the fulfillment at the earliest practicable date of all of the
                  conditions to their respective obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
                  [*299] The Selling Debtors and Prevailing Bidder (in consultation with the Creditors' Committee) may agree to
                  extend the Closing Deadline from time to time in their reasonable business judgment.
                  If the Prevailing Bidder's APA is terminated in accordance with the terms thereof, the Selling Debtors may, in their
                  reasonable business judgment, close the Backup Purchase with the Backup Bidder pursuant to § 13(b), and the
                  Selling Debtors reserve all of their rights under the APA to obtain damages from the Prevailing Bidder.
                  (b) Backup Purchase.
                  At the conclusion of the Auction, the Selling Debtors shall determine in the exercise of their reasonable business
                  judgment, and in consultation with the Creditors' Committee, which bidder submitted the ""highest or best"" offer, as
                  the case may be, immediately preceding the making of the Prevailing Bid (the ""Backup Bid""). The bidder making the
                  Backup Bid (the ""Backup Bid"") shall be required to keep the Backup Bid open and irrevocable until the earlier of: (i)
                  the Offer Expiration Date; or (ii) the consummation of the sale transaction contemplated by the Prevailing Bid. In the
                  event the Stalking Horse Bidder becomes the Backup Bidder pursuant to this § 13(b),  [*300] and the Backup Bid
                  expires pursuant to § 13(b)(ii), the amount of the Breakup Fee shall increase by $ 500,000.
                  Upon termination pursuant to the APA, the Selling Debtors will be authorized, but not required, to consummate a
                  sale transaction with the Backup Bidder on the terms and conditions of the Backup Bid (the ""Backup Purchase"")
                  without further order of the Bankruptcy Court. The Selling Debtors shall consult with the Creditors' Committee in
                  determining whether to consummate the Backup Purchase.
                  For purposes of consummating the Backup Purchase, the Closing Deadline shall be extended for the number of
                  days between Sale Hearing and the date the Selling Debtors notify the Backup Bidder that they intend to
                  consummate the Backup Purchase plus twenty (20) additional days.
                  The Backup Bidder shall be subject to the provisions of § 13(a).
                  14. Return of Deposits.
                  Except as otherwise provided herein, all Deposits (including interest or investment income accrued thereon - if any)
                  shall be returned to bidders not selected by the Selling Debtors as the Prevailing Bidder or Backup Bidder no later
                  man five (5) business days following the conclusion of the Auction. The Deposit (including interest or investment
                  [*301] income accrued thereon - if any) of the Backup Bidder shall be returned on or prior to the earlier of: (i) one
                  (1) business day following the consummation of the sale transaction contemplated by the Prevailing Bid; and (ii)
                  one (1) business day following the Offer Expiration Date.
                  15. Reservation of Rights: Deadline Extension.
                  Consistent with these Bidding Procedures, the Selling Debtors reserve their rights to modify these bidding
                  procedures and auction procedures at any time before and during the Auction, including, without limitation,
                  extending the deadlines set forth herein (with the exception of the Backup Bid-related Deadlines), modifying bidding
                  increments, adjourning the Auction at the Auction and/or adjourning the Sale Hearing in open court without further
                  notice, re-opening the Auction at any time prior to the Sale Hearing, canceling the Auction, and rejecting all
                  Qualifying Bids if, in the Selling Debtors' business judgment, no submitted bid is for a fair and adequate price. The
                  Selling Debtors will consult with the Creditors' Committee regarding their exercise of the rights reserved in the
                  foregoing sentence.

                  Jointly Administered
                  LEASE OR EXECUTORY CONTRACT ASSUMPTION AND CURE NOTICE
                  PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that, on July 3, 2007, the Debtors filed a Motion for Entry of an Order: (a) Approving
                  Bidding Procedures with Bid Protections: (b) Approving Form and Manner of Notice of Sale by Auction; (c)
                  Authorizing  [*303] Sale of Assets Free and Clear of All Liens, Claims, Encumbrances and Other Interests; (d)
                  Authorizing Assumption and Assignment of Executory Contracts; and (e) Approving Procedures for Noticing and
                  Determining Cure Amounts (the ""Sale Motion"") [Docket No.    ] with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the
                  District of Delaware (the ""Bankruptcy Court""). The Debtors seek, among other things, to sell their Atwood Mobile
                  Products division (the ""Sale Assets"") to the successful bidder at an auction (the ""Prevailing Bidder""), free and clear
                  of all liens, claims, encumbrances and other interests pursuant to section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, and to
                  assume and assign to the Prevailing Bidder certain executory contracts (the ""Executory Contracts"") pursuant to
                  section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code.
                  PLEASE TAKE FURTHER NOTICE that, on [   ], 2007, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order [Docket No.    ] (the
                  ""Bidding Procedures Order"") approving the following cure procedures (the ""Cure Procedures""):
                  (i) Notice of Cure Objection Deadline: Within five (5) business days following entry of the Bidding Procedures
                  Order (the ""Initial Cure Notice Date""), the Debtors shall serve the Cure Notice by regular mail  [*304] on each
                  counterparty to an Executory Contract (a ""Contract Counterparty""), notifying such Contract Counterparty of the
                  Debtors' intent to assume and assign the applicable Executory Contract and of the cure amount determined by
                  the Debtors to be necessary for such assumption and assignment. If Schedule 2.1(c) of the APA is
                  subsequently amended to add executory contracts or unexpired leases, the Debtors shall serve the Cure
                  Notice via overnight courier within three (3) business days of such amendment.
                  (ii) Cure Objections: Any Contract Counterparty seeking to (a) assert a Cure Amount based on defaults,
                  conditions or pecuniary losses under an Executory Contract different from that set forth on the applicable Cure
                  Notice, or (b) object to the potential assumption and assignment on any other grounds, shall be required to file
                  and serve a written objection (a ""Cure Objection"") setting forth with specificity (i) any and all cure amounts that
                  the Contract Counterparty asserts must be cured or satisfied respecting an Executory Contract and/or (ii) if the
                  objection to the potential assignment of such Executory Contract is based on adequate assurance issues, what
                  information with respect to the  [*305] Purchaser such Contract Counterparty requires to satisfy its adequate
                  assurance concerns.
                  (iii) Cure Objection Deadline: To be considered timely, a Cure Objection must be filed with the Bankruptcy
                  Court no later than 4:00 p.m. (prevailing Eastern time) on August 8, 2007 (the ""Cure Objection Deadline""). If,
                  after the Initial Cure Notice Date, the Debtors subsequently amend Schedule 2.1(c) of the APA to add
                  executory contracts or unexpired leases, the Cure Objection Deadline with respect to such Executory Contracts
                  shall be the earlier of (i) fourteen (14) calendar days from the date of service of a Cure Notice or (ii) August 15,
                  2007, at 11:00 a.m. (prevailing Eastern time).
                  (iv) Failure to File Cure Objection: Unless a Cure Objection is timely filed by the Cure Objection Deadline, the
                  Bankruptcy Court shall enter an order authorizing or effecting the assumption and assignment of the applicable
                  1 The ""Debtors"" comprise the entities set forth in the Order Pursuant to Rule 1015(b) of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy
                  Procedure Directing Joint Administration of the Debtors' Chapter 11 Cases, entered on October 31, 2006 [Docket No. 68].
                  
                  
                  Executory Contract at the Sale Hearing or otherwise without regard to any objection such party may have or
                  any provisions to the contrary in the applicable Executory Contract.
                  (v) Waiver of Cure Objection: Contract Counterparties that fail to file Cure Objections as provided above shall
                  be deemed  [*306] to have waived and released any and all Cure Obligations and shall be forever barred and
                  estopped from asserting or claiming against the Debtors, the Prevailing Bidder or any other assignee of the
                  relevant Executory Contract that any additional amounts are due or defaults exist, or prohibitions or conditions
                  to assignment exist or must be satisfied, under such Executory Contracts for the period prior to the
                  consummation of the APA. The Sale Order shall provide that the Prevailing Bidder's promise to perform under
                  the Executory Contracts is deemed, absent objection, adequate assurance of future performance under the
                  Executory Contracts.
                  (vi) Reservation of Rights: The Debtors and Prevailing Bidder each reserve the right to exclude or add any
                  Executory Contracts from or to Schedule 2.1(c) of the APA and to withdraw the request to assume and assign
                  any Executory Contract pursuant to the terms of the APA.
                  (vii) Unresolved Cure Objections:  [*307] Any Cure Objections, if not consensually resolved, will be heard by
                  the Bankruptcy Court at the Sale Hearing, where the Debtors will demonstrate facts to establish the Prevailing
                  Bidder's capability and willingness to perform under the Executory Contracts.
                  PLEASE TAKE FURTHER NOTICE that the Debtors may seek, in connection with the sale of the Sale
                  Assets, to assume or assign the unexpired lease(s) and/or executory contract(s) identified on Exhibit A
                  attached hereto. The cure amount(s) the Debtors believe is/are due and owing, within the meaning of
                  section 365(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, for those contracts, based on the Debtors' books and records, is
                  set forth in Exhibit A. Such Cure Amount includes any and all outstanding pre-petition amounts.
                  PLEASE TAKE FURTHER NOTICE that a hearing will be held to approve the assumption and assignment of the
                  Executory Contracts and sale of the Sale Assets to the Prevailing Bidder (the ""Sale Hearing"") before the Hon. Kevin

                  IN THE UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE
                  In re DURA AUTOMOTIVE SYSTEMS, INC., et al., 1 Debtors.
                  Chapter 11
                  Case No. 06-11202 (KJC)
                  Jointly Administered
                  SALE OF DEBTORS' ATWOOD MOBILE PRODUCTS DIVISION
                  ORDER: (A) APPROVING BIDDING PROCEDURES WITH BID PROTECTIONS; (B) APPROVING FORM AND
                  MANNER OF NOTICE OF SALE BY AUCTION; AND (C) APPROVING PROCEDURES FOR NOTICING AND
                  DETERMINING CURE AMOUNTS
                  THIS MATTER is before the court on the motion (the ""Motion"") 2 [Docket No.    ] dated July 3, 2007, of the Debtors
                  for entry of an order approving, among other things: (a) bidding procedures with bid protections; (b) the form and
                  manner of notice of sale by auction; and (c) procedures for noticing and determining cure amounts. After due
                  deliberation and having determined that the relief requested in the Motion is in the best interests of the Debtors and
                  their estates,
                  THE  [*314] COURT HEREBY FINDS THAT:
                  3
                  1 The ""Debtors"" comprise  [*313] the entities set forth in the Order Pursuant to Rule 1015(b) of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy
                  Procedure Directing Joint Administration of the Debtors' Chapter 11 Cases, entered on October 31, 2006 [Docket No. 68].
                  2 Unless otherwise stated, all capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the same meaning as set forth in the APA and the
                  Motion, and to the extent of any inconsistency, the APA shall govern.
                  3 The findings and conclusions set forth herein constitute the court's findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to
                  Bankruptcy Rule 7052, made applicable to this proceeding pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 9014. To the extent that any of the
                  following findings of fact constitute conclusions of law, they are adopted as such. To the extent any of the following conclusions
                  of law constitute findings of fact, they are adopted as such.
                  
                  
                  A. This court has jurisdiction over the Motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1334. This proceeding is a core proceeding
                  pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(2)(A), (N) and (O). Venue is proper in this district and in this court pursuant to 28
                  U.S.C. §§ 1408 and 1409.
                  B. The statutory predicates for the relief requested herein are sections 105(a), 363(b) and (f), 365, 503 and 507 of
                  title 11 of the United States Code (the ""Bankruptcy Code"") and Rules 2002(a)(2), 6004(a), (b), (c), (e) and (f),
                  6006(a) and (c), 9007 and 9014 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure (the ""Bankruptcy Rules"").
                  C. Notice of the Motion having been given to the Notice Parties (as defined below) is sufficient in light of the
                  circumstances and the nature of the relief  [*315] requested herein.
                  D. The Debtors have articulated good and sufficient reasons for this court to grant the relief requested in the Motion
                  regarding the sales process, including, without limitation: (i) approval of the Bidding Procedures with bid protections;
                  (ii) the form and manner of notice of sale by auction; and (iii) procedures for noticing and determining cure amounts.
                  E. The Breakup Fee and Expense Reimbursement to be paid under the circumstances described herein and in the
                  APA to the Purchaser are: (i) actual and necessary costs and expenses of preserving the Debtors estates within the
                  meaning of sections 503(b)(1) and 507(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code; (ii) commensurate to the real and substantial
                  benefit conferred upon the Debtors' estates by the Purchaser, (iii) reasonable and appropriate, in light of the size
                  and nature of the proposed sale transaction and comparable transactions, the commitments that have been made
                  and the efforts that have been and will be expended by the Purchaser; and (iv) necessary to induce the Purchaser
                  to continue to pursue the sale transaction and to continue to be bound by the APA.
                  F. The Breakup Fee and Expense Reimbursement also induced the Purchaser  [*316] to submit a bid that will serve
                  as a minimum floor bid on which the Debtors, their creditors and other bidders may rely. The Purchaser has
                  provided a material benefit to the Debtors and their creditors by increasing the likelihood that Debtors receive the
                  best possible price for the Sale Assets. Accordingly, the Bidding Procedures, Breakup Fee and Expense
                  Reimbursement are reasonable and appropriate and represent the best method for maximizing value for the benefit
                  of the Debtors' estates.
                  G. The Sale Notice (attached hereto as Exhibit A) is reasonably calculated to provide all interested parties with
                  timely and proper notice of the Sale, Sale Hearing and Auction.
                  H. The Cure Notice (attached hereto as Exhibit B) is reasonably calculated to provide all counterparties to the
                  Executory Contracts (the ""Contract Parties"") with proper notice of the potential assumption and assignment of their
                  executory contract or unexpired lease and any cure amounts relating thereto.
                  IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED THAT:
                  1. The Bidding Procedures, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C, are hereby approved. The
                  Debtors are authorized to take any and all actions necessary or appropriate  [*317] to implement the Bidding
                  Procedures.
                  2. All objections to the relief requested in the Motion that have not been withdrawn, waived, or settled as announced
                  to the court at the hearing on the Motion or by stipulation filed with the court, are overruled except as otherwise set
                  forth herein.
                  3. Within five (5) business days of this order, the Debtors (or their agent) shall serve by first class mail, postage

                  Purchaser becomes entitled to receive the Breakup Fee and Expense Reimbursement in accordance with the terms

                  LEASE OR EXECUTORY CONTRACT ASSUMPTION AND CURE NOTICE
                  PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that, on July 3, 2007, the Debtors filed a Motion for Entry of an Order: (a) Approving
                  Bidding Procedures with Bid Protections; (b) Approving Form and Manner of Notice of Sale by Auction; (c)
                  Authorizing Sale of Assets Free and Clear of All Liens, Claims, Encumbrances and Other Interests; (d) Authorizing

                  Delaware (the ""Bankruptcy Court""). The Debtors seek, among other things, to sell their Atwood Mobile Products
                  division (the ""Sale Assets"") to the successful bidder at an auction (the ""Prevailing Bidder""), free and clear of all
                  liens, claims, encumbrances and other interests pursuant to section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, and to assume
                  and assign to the Prevailing Bidder certain executory contracts (the ""Executory Contracts"") pursuant to section 365
                  of the Bankruptcy Code.
                  PLEASE TAKE FURTHER NOTICE that, on [   ], 2007, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order [Docket No.    ] (the
                  ""Bidding Procedures Order"") approving the following cure procedures (the ""Cure Procedures""):
                  (i) Notice of Cure Objection Deadline: Within five (5) business days following entry of the Bidding Procedures
                  Order (the ""Initial Cure Notice Date""), the Debtors shall serve the Cure Notice by regular mail on each
                  counterparty to an Executory Contract (a ""Contract Counterparty""), notifying such Contract Counterparty of the
                  Debtors' intent to assume and assign the applicable Executory Contract and of the cure amount determined by
                  the Debtors  [*328] to be necessary for such assumption and assignment. If Schedule 2.1(c) of the APA is
                  subsequently amended to add executory contracts or unexpired leases, the Debtors shall serve the Cure
                  Notice via overnight courier within three (3) business days of such amendment.
                  (ii) Cure Objections: Any Contract Counterparty seeking to (a) assert a Cure Amount based on defaults,
                  conditions or pecuniary losses under an Executory Contract different from that set forth on the applicable Cure
                  Notice, or (b) object to the potential assumption and assignment on any other grounds, shall be required to file
                  and serve a written objection (a ""Cure Objection"") setting forth with specificity (i) any and all cure amounts that
                  the Contract Counterparty asserts must be cured or satisfied respecting an Executory Contract and/or (ii) if the
                  objection to the potential assignment of such Executory Contract is based on adequate assurance issues, what
                  information with respect to the Purchaser such Contract Counterparty requires to satisfy its adequate
                  assurance concerns.
                  (iii) Cure Objection Deadline: To be considered timely, a Cure Objection must be filed with the Bankruptcy
                  Court no later than 4:00 p.m. (prevailing  [*329] Eastern time) on August 8, 2007 (die ""Cure Objection
                  Deadline""). If, after the Initial Cure Notice Date, the Debtors subsequently amend Schedule 2.1(c) of the APA
                  to add executory contracts or unexpired leases, the Cure Objection Deadline with respect to such Executory
                  Contracts shall be the earlier of (i) fourteen (14) calendar days from the date of service of a Cure Notice or (ii)
                  August 15, 2007, at 11:00 a.m. (prevailing Eastern time).
                  (iv) Failure to File Cure Objection: Unless a Cure Objection is timely filed by the Cure Objection Deadline, the
                  Bankruptcy Court shall enter an order authorizing or effecting the assumption and assignment of me applicable
                  Executory Contract at the Sale Hearing or otherwise without regard to any objection such party may have or
                  any provisions to the contrary in the applicable Executory Contract.
                  (v) Waiver of Cure Objection: Contract Counterparties that fail to file Cure Objections as provided above shall
                  be deemed to have waived and released any and all Cure Obligations and shall be forever barred and
                  estopped from asserting or claiming against the Debtors, the Prevailing Bidder or any other assignee of the
                  
                  
                  relevant Executory Contract that any additional  [*330] amounts are due or defaults exist, or prohibitions or
                  conditions to assignment exist or must be satisfied, under such Executory Contracts for the period prior to the
                  consummation of the APA. The Sale Order shall provide that the Prevailing Bidder's promise to perform under
                  the Executory Contracts is deemed, absent objection, adequate assurance of future performance under the
                  Executory Contracts.
                  (vi) Reservation of Rights: The Debtors and Prevailing Bidder each reserve the right to exclude or add any
                  Executory Contracts from or to Schedule 2.1(c) of the APA and to withdraw the request to assume and assign
                  any Executory Contract pursuant to the terms of the APA.
                  (vii) Unresolved Cure Objections: Any Core Objections, if not consensually resolved, will be heard by the
                  Bankruptcy Court at the Sale Hearing, where the Debtors will demonstrate facts to establish the Prevailing
                  Bidder's capability and willingness to perform under the Executory Contracts.
                  PLEASE TAKE FURTHER NOTICE that the Debtors may seek, in connection with the sale of the Sale
                  Assets, to assume or assign the unexpired lease(s) and/or executory contract(s) identified on Exhibit A
                  attached hereto. The cure amount(s) the Debtors  [*331] believe is/are due and owing, within the meaning of
                  section 365(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, for those contracts, based on the Debtors' books and records, is
                  set forth in Exhibit A. Such Cure Amount includes any and all outstanding pre-petition amounts.

                  2. Stalking Horse Bidder.
                  On July 3, 2007, the Selling Debtors and Atwood Acquisition Co. LLC (the ""Stalking Horse Bidder"") entered into an

                  Auction and Bankruptcy Court approval; and (ii) the Selling Debtors agreed, in the event that the Bankruptcy Court
                  approves the purchase of the Sale Assets by another entity (an ""Alternative Transaction""): (a) to pay to the Stalking

                  agreement attached hereto as Exhibit A (the ""APA""), which agreement is identical to the Stalking Horse APA (defined herein) in
                  all material respects except for the exclusion of Section 4.6(c) of the Stalking Horse APA and all other references therein to the
                  Breakup Fee (defined herein).

                  administrative expense of the Selling Debtors under Sections 503(b)(1) and 507(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code,
                  respectively; and (y) have priority over any and all claims of holders with existing liens on proceeds of an Alternative

                  The Selling Debtors further reserve the right, in their reasonable business judgment, at any time after the Bid
                  Deadline and prior to the conclusion of the Auction, to invite parties that have not previously submitted written offers
                  to do so such that they may be considered pursuant to the procedures  [*341] set forth herein.
                  The Selling Debtors shall provide counsel to the Creditors' Committee, Second Lien Group and DIP Lenders with
                  copies of bids, and a list of parties submitting bids, as soon as is reasonably practicable after the Bid Deadline.
                  7. Determination of Qualifying Bids.
                  The Selling Debtors shall, by no later than 5:00 p.m. (prevailing eastern time), August 10, 2007 (me ""Bid
                  Determination Deadline""):
                  (a) determine in their reasonable business judgment whether a written offer is a Qualifying Bid;
                  (b) notify each party submitting a written offer whether that written offer is a Qualifying Bid; and
                  (c) provide copies of each Qualifying Bidders' APA to the Stalking Horse Bidder and all Qualifying Bidders.
                  The Selling Debtors shall consult with the Creditors' Committee regarding their determination of Qualifying Bidders.
                  The Selling Debtors will provide to counsel for the Creditors' Committee, Second Lien Group and DIP Lenders the
                  list of Qualifying Bidders as soon as is reasonably practicable after the Bid Determination Deadline.
                  The Selling Debtors reserve the right, at any time after the Bid Deadline and prior to the commencement of the
                  Auction, to request parties submitting written  [*342] offers that were determined not to be Qualifying Bids to amend
                  their written offers such that those amended written offers may be considered as Qualifying Bids. The Selling
                  Debtors will consult with the Creditors' Committee regarding any such requests.
                  8. Auction Procedures.
                  In the event that the Selling Debtors receive one or more Qualifying Bids, the Auction shall take place at 10:00 a.m.
                  (prevailing eastern time), August 14, 2007, at the offices of Kirkland & Ellis LLP, Citigroup Center, 153 East 53rd
                  Street, New York, New York 10022, or at any such other place, date and time as may be designated in writing by
                  the Selling Debtors. Subject to § 15 hereof, the Auction shall be governed by the following procedures:
                  (a) the Stalking Horse Bidder and each Qualifying Bidder shall appear in person or by telephone, or through a
                  duly authorized representative;
                  (b) the Stalking Horse Bidder and each Qualifying Bidder shall be required to confirm that it has not engaged in
                  any collusion with respect to the bidding or the sale (except for joint bidding arrangements disclosed to the
                  Selling Debtors pursuant to § 5(n));
                  (c) only the Stalking Horse Bidder and Qualifying Bidders shall be entitled to  [*343] submit bids;
                  (d) bidding shall commence at the amount of the highest Qualifying Bid submitted prior to the Auction;
                  (e) the Selling Debtors reserve the right to determine, in their reasonable business judgment, whether a bid
                  constitutes a higher and better offer than previous bids, based upon factors including, but not limited to, the
                  amount of the purchase price, the form of consideration being offered, the likelihood of the bidder's ability to
                  close a transaction and the timing thereof, the number, type and nature of any changes to the APA requested,
                  and the net benefit to the Selling Debtors' estates;
                  (f) bids must be at least $ 750,000 (the ""Auction Bid Increment"") higher than the outstanding highest bid
                  (though, as discussed in § 15 hereof, the Selling Debtors retain the right to modify, in their business judgment,
                  the bid increment during the Auction); provided, however, that any further bid made by the Stalking Horse
                  Bidder shall include a credit (or Purchase Price reduction) equal to the Breakup Fee plus the Maximum
                  Expense Reimbursement (the sum of which is the ""Credit Bid Amount""), such that any such bid by the Stalking
                  Horse shall result in an increase in value to the Selling  [*344] Debtors equal to the Auction Bid Increment 3
                  3 For example, if a Qualifying Bidder bids $ 200,000,000, the Stalking Horse may then bid $ 200,750,000, which includes the
                  Credit Bid Amount, and which will result in an increase in value to the Selling Debtors equal to the Auction Bid Increment.
                  
                  
                  This same Credit Bid Amount shall reduce the Purchase Price in the event that the Stalking Horse Bidder is the
                  Prevailing Bidder;
                  (g) the Stalking Horse Bidder and Qualifying Bidders may make additional modifications to the Stalking Horse
                  APA, APA or Modified APA, as applicable, during the Auction, provided, however, that any such modifications,
                  on an aggregate basis, shall not be less favorable to the Selling Debtors as determined by the Selling Debtors
                  in their reasonable business judgment;
                  (h) the Selling Debtors intend to continue the Auction until there is only one bid that, in their reasonable
                  business judgment, is the highest or best offer, as the case may be (the ""Prevailing Bid""--the bidder submitting
                  such Prevailing Bid, the ""Prevailing Bidder,"" shall have such rights and responsibilities as set forth in the
                  applicable APA or Modified APA); provided that the Debtors will consult with the Creditors' Committee
                  regarding the selection of the Prevailing Bidder;
                  (i) the Selling Debtors may, at any time prior to the commencement of the Sale Hearing (defined below),
                  continue the Auction from time to time, adjourn the Auction, and re-open  [*345] the Auction; and
                  (j) the Stalking Horse Bidder and each Qualifying Bidder participating in the Auction shall be deemed to have
                  consented to the core jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court.
                  9. No Qualifying Bids.
                  If no Qualifying Bid is submitted by the Bid Deadline, the Selling Debtors may, but are not required, in their
                  reasonable business judgment, cancel the Auction and accept the Stalking Horse Bid (in which case, the Prevailing
                  Bid shall be the Stalking Horse Bid, and the Prevailing Bidder shall be die Stalking Horse Bidder). Prior to
                  announcing any such cancellation, the Selling Debtors shall consult with the Creditors' Committee regarding that
                  cancellation.
                  10. Announcement of Prevailing Bidder and Execution of Agreements.
                  The Selling Debtors reserve the right to announce the identity of the Prevailing Bidder at any time prior to the
                  commencement of the Sale Hearing. Within one (1) calendar day after the announcement of the identity of the
                  [*346] Prevailing Bidder by the Selling Debtors, the Prevailing Bidder shall complete and execute all agreements,
                  contracts, instruments or other documents evidencing and containing the terms and conditions upon which the
                  Prevailing Bid was made.
                  11. Selling Debtors' Acceptance of Prevailing Bid Subject to Bankruptcy Court Approval.
                  The Prevailing Bid will be subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court at the Sale Hearing. The Selling Debtors
                  shall be deemed to have accepted the Prevailing Bid only when the Prevailing Bid has been approved by the
                  Bankruptcy Court. The Selling Debtors shall use reasonable efforts to obtain Bankruptcy Court approval of the
                  Prevailing Bid in the form of the sale order attached as Exhibit I to the APA (the ""Sale Order"").
                  12. Sale Hearing.
                  A hearing (the ""Sale Hearing"") will be held to approve the sale of the Sale Assets to the Prevailing Bidder before the
                  Honorable Kevin J. Carey in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, 824 North Market
                  Street, 5th Floor, Wilmington, Delaware 19801, at 1:30 p.m. (prevailing eastern time), August 15, 2007, at such
                  time thereafter as counsel may be heard, or at such other time as the Bankruptcy Court may  [*347] determine. The
                  Sale Hearing may be adjourned from time to time without further notice to creditors or parties-in-interest other than
                  by announcement of the adjournment in open court on the date scheduled for the Sale Hearing. The Prevailing
                  Bidder and Backup Bidder (defined below), if any, should be represented by counsel at the Sale Hearing.
                  13. Consummation of the Purchase.
                  (a) Closing Deadline.
                  
                  
                  The Prevailing Bidder shall, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Prevailing Bidder's APA,
                  consummate the sale transaction contemplated by the Prevailing Bid (the ""Purchase"") on or before the Closing
                  Deadline (defined in § 5(d) above). Consistent with APA § 8.4, the Prevailing Bidder and the Selling Debtors shall
                  each use their commercially reasonable best efforts to: (i) take all actions necessary or appropriate to consummate
                  the transactions contemplated by the APA and (ii) cause the fulfillment at the earliest practicable date of all of the
                  conditions to their respective obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
                  Selling Debtors and Prevailing Bidder (in consultation with the Creditors' Committee) may agree to extend the
                  Closing Deadline  [*348] from time to time in their reasonable business judgment.
                  If the Prevailing Bidder's APA is terminated in accordance with the terms thereof, the Selling Debtors may, in their
                  reasonable business judgment, close the Backup Purchase with the Backup Bidder pursuant to § 13(b), and the
                  Selling Debtors reserve all of their rights under the APA to obtain damages from the Prevailing Bidder.
                  (b) Backup Purchase.
                  At the conclusion of the Auction, the Selling Debtors shall determine in the exercise of their reasonable business
                  judgment, and in consultation with the Creditors' Committee, which bidder submitted the ""highest or best"" offer, as
                  the case may be, immediately preceding the making of the Prevailing Bid (the ""Backup Bid""). The bidder making the
                  Backup Bid (the ""Backup Bid"") shall be required to keep the Backup Bid open and irrevocable until the earlier of: (i)
                  the Offer Expiration Date; or (ii) the consummation of the sale transaction contemplated by the Prevailing Bid. In the
                  event the Stalking Horse Bidder becomes the Backup Bidder pursuant to this § 13(b), and the Backup Bid expires
                  pursuant to § 13(b)(ii), the amount of the Breakup Fee shall increase by $ 500,000.
                  Upon termination pursuant  [*349] to the APA, the Selling Debtors will be authorized, but not required, to
                  consummate a sale transaction with the Backup Bidder on the terms and conditions of the Backup Bid (the ""Backup
                  Purchase"") without further order of the Bankruptcy Court. The Selling Debtors shall consult with the Creditors'
                  Committee in determining whether to consummate the Backup Purchase.
                  For purposes of consummating the Backup Purchase, the Closing Deadline shall be extended for the number of
                  days between Sale Hearing and the date the Selling Debtors notify the Backup Bidder that they intend to
                  consummate the Backup Purchase plus twenty (20) additional days.
                  The Backup Bidder shall be subject to the provisions of § 13(a).
                  14. Return of Deposits.
                  Except as otherwise provided herein, all Deposits (including interest or investment income accrued thereon - if any)
                  shall be returned to bidders not selected by the Selling Debtors as the Prevailing Bidder or Backup Bidder no later
                  than five (5) business days following the conclusion of the Auction. The Deposit (including interest or investment
                  income accrued thereon - if any) of the Backup Bidder shall be returned on or prior to the earlier of: (i) one (1)
                  business day  [*350] following the consummation of the sale transaction contemplated by the Prevailing Bid; and (ii)
                  one (1) business day following the Offer Expiration Date.
                  15. Reservation of Rights: Deadline Extension.
                  Consistent with these Bidding Procedures, the Selling Debtors reserve their rights to modify these bidding
                  procedures and auction procedures at any time before and during the Auction, including, without limitation,
                  extending the deadlines set forth herein (with the exception of the Backup Bid-related Deadlines), modifying bidding
                  increments, adjourning the Auction at the Auction and/or adjourning the Sale Hearing in open court without further
                  notice, re-opening the Auction at any time prior to the Sale Hearing, canceling the Auction, and rejecting all
                  Qualifying Bids if, in the Selling Debtors' business judgment, no submitted bid is for a fair and adequate price. The
                  Selling Debtors will consult with the Creditors' Committee regarding their exercise of the rights reserved in the
                  foregoing sentence.

                  D. The Court entered the Bidding Procedures Order on    , 2007 [Docket No.    ].

                  G. In the absence of a stay pending appeal, the Prevailing Bidder will be acting in good faith pursuant to section

                  entry of this Sale Order, and cause has been shown as to why this Sale Order should not be subject to the stay

                  15. counsel to Atwood Acquisition Co., LLC (the ""Stalking Horse Bidder"");

                  all environmental reports set forth in AP A Schedule 5.11.
                  D. In accordance with the provisions of the Bidding Procedures Order, the Debtors have served notice (the ""Cure
                  Notice"") upon Prevailing Bidder and the Contract CounterParties: (i) that the Debtors seek to assume and assign
                  certain executory contracts (the ""Executory Contracts"") on    , 2007, (the ""Closing Date""): and (ii) of the relevant
                  cure amounts. The service of such Cure Notice was good, sufficient and appropriate under the circumstances and
                  no further notice need be given in respect of establishing a cure amount for the Executory Contracts. Prevailing
                  Bidder and the Contract CounterParties have had an opportunity to object to the cure amounts set forth in the Cure
                  Notice.
                  E. The Debtors have articulated good and sufficient reasons for the Court to grant the relief requested in the Motion

                  determination of final cure amount; and (iii) approval and authorization to serve the Final Sale Notice (as defined in
                  the Bidding Procedures Order).
                  F. The Debtors' Final Sale Notice provided all interested parties with timely and proper notice of the Sale, Sale
                  Hearing and Auction.
                  G. The Cure Notice provided Prevailing Bidder and the Contract CounterParties with proper notice of the potential
                  assumption and assignment of the Executory Contracts and any cure amount relating thereto, and the procedures
                  set forth therein with regard to any such cure amount to satisfy the provisions of 11 U.S.C. § 365.
                  H. As evidenced by the affidavits of service previously filed with the Court, proper, timely, adequate, and sufficient
                  notice of the Sale Motion, Auction, Sale Hearing, and Sale has been provided in accordance with sections 102(1),
                  363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code and Bankruptcy Rules 2002, 6004, 6006 and 9014. The Debtors also have
                  complied with all obligations to provide notice of the Auction, Sale Hearing, and Sale required by the Bidding
                  Procedures Order. The notices described in paragraphs A to G above were good, sufficient  [*359] and appropriate
                  under the circumstances, and no other or further notice of the Sale Motion, Auction, Sale Hearing, Sale, or
                  assumption, assignment and sale of the Executory Contracts is required.
                  I. The disclosures made by the Debtors concerning the Sale Motion, APA, Auction, Sale, and Sale Hearing,
                  including but not limited to the Affidavit of Alexander Tracy of Miller Buckfire & Co., LLC in Support of the Debtors'
                  Motion for an Order (a) Approving the Bidding Procedures, (b) Approving the Form and Manner of Notice of the
                  Auction and Sale, (c) Approving Procedures for Determining Cure Amounts in Connection with the Assumption and
                  Assignment of the Executory Contracts, (d) Approving the Assumption of the Executory Contracts, and (e)
                  Approving the Sale of the Sale Assets (the ""Affidavit"") and the Supplemental Affidavit of Alexander Tracy of Miller
                  Buckfire & Co., LLC in Support of the Debtors' Motion for an Order (a) Approving the Bidding Procedures, (b)
                  Approving the Form and Manner of Notice of the Auction and Sale, (c) Approving Procedures for Determining Cure
                  Amounts in Connection with the Assumption and Assignment of the Executory Contracts, (d) Approving the
                  Assumption of the Executory  [*360] Contracts as Amended, and (e) Approving the Sale of the Sale Assets (the
                  ""Supplemental Affidavit""), were good, complete and adequate.
                  III. Good Faith of Prevailing Bidder
                  A. The prevailing bidder(s) for the purchase of the Sale Assets (the ""Prevailing Bidder"") is not an ""insider"" of the
                  Debtors, as that term is defined in section 101(31) of the Bankruptcy Code.
                  
                  
                  B. Prevailing Bidder is purchasing the Sale Assets in good faith and is a good faith buyer within the meaning of
                  section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code, and is therefore entitled to the full protection of that provision, and
                  otherwise has proceeded in good faith in all respects in connection with this proceeding in that, inter alia: (a)
                  Prevailing Bidder recognized that the Debtors were free to deal with any other party interested in acquiring the Sale
                  Assets; (b) Prevailing Bidder complied with the provisions in the Bidding Procedures Order; (c) Prevailing Bidder
                  agreed to subject its bid to the competitive bidding procedures set forth in the Bidding Procedures Order; (d)
                  Prevailing Bidder in no way induced or caused the chapter 11 filing by the Debtors or any other Debtors; (e) all
                  payments to be made by the Prevailing Bidder  [*361] and other agreements or arrangements entered into by the
                  Prevailing Bidder in connection with the Sale have been disclosed; (f) Prevailing Bidder has not violated section
                  363(n) of the Bankruptcy Code by any action or inaction; (g) no common identity of directors or controlling
                  stockholders exists between the Prevailing Bidder and any of the Debtors; and (h) the negotiation and execution of
                  the final purchase agreement (""Final APA,"" which is attached hereto as Exhibit A, and which is based upon the
                  APA attached to the Motion, but incorporates changes brought about by the competitive nature of the Auction) and
                  any other agreements or instruments related thereto were at arms' length and in good faith.
                  IV. Highest or best Offer
                  A. Prior to selecting Atwood Acquisition Co., LLC as the stalking horse bidder, the Debtors solicited offers to acquire
                  the Sale Assets from a wide variety of parties. In addition to such solicitations, as set forth in the Supplemental
                  Affidavit, the Debtors also conducted an auction in accordance with the provisions of the Bidding Procedures Order.
                  This auction, which was conducted in compliance with the process set forth in the Bidding Procedures Order,
                  afforded  [*362] a full, fair and reasonable opportunity for any person or entity to make a higher or otherwise better
                  offer to purchase the Sale Assets. The Auction was duly noticed and conducted in a noncollusive, fair and good
                  faith manner and a reasonable opportunity has been given to any interested party to make a higher and better offer
                  for the Sale Assets.
                  B. The Final APA constitutes the highest or best offer for the Sale Assets, and will provide a greater recovery for the
                  Debtors' estate than would be provided by any other available alternative. The Debtors' determination that the Final
                  APA constitutes fee highest or best offer for the Sale Assets constitutes a valid and sound exercise of the Debtors'
                  business judgment.
                  C. The Final APA represents a fair and reasonable offer to purchase the Sale Assets under the circumstances of
                  these chapter 11 cases. No other person or entity or group of entities has offered to purchase the Sale Assets for
                  greater economic value to the Debtors' estate than the Prevailing Bidder.
                  D. Approval of the Sale Motion and the Final APA and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby
                  is in the best interests of the Debtors, its creditors, its estate and  [*363] other parties in interest.
                  E. The Debtors have demonstrated compelling circumstances and a good, sufficient, and sound business purpose
                  and justification for the Sale prior to, and outside of, a plan of reorganization.
                  V. No Fraudulent Transfer
                  A. The consideration provided by the Prevailing Bidder pursuant to the Final APA is fair and adequate and
                  constitutes reasonably equivalent value and fair consideration under the Bankruptcy Code and under the laws of
                  the United States, any state, territory, possession, or the District of Columbia.
                  VI. Validity of Transfer
                  A. The Debtors have full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver the Final APA and all other
                  documents contemplated thereby, and no further consents or approvals are required for die Debtors to
                  consummate the transactions contemplated by the Final APA, except as otherwise set forth in the Final APA.
                  
                  
                  B. The transfer of each of the Sale Assets to the Prevailing Bidder will be as of me Closing Date a legal, valid, and
                  effective transfer of such assets, and vests or will vest the Prevailing Bidder with all right, title, and interest of the
                  Debtors to the Sale Assets free and clear of all liens (and Claims (as defined below)  [*364] (collectively, ""Liens""))
                  accruing, arising or relating to any time prior to the Closing Date, except for any permitted liens and assumed
                  liabilities (the ""Assumed Liens"" and ""Assumed Liabilities"") under the Final APA.
                  VII. Section 363(f) Is Satisfied
                  A. The Prevailing Bidder would not have entered into the Final APA and would not consummate the transactions
                  contemplated thereby (by paying the Purchase Price and assuming the Assumed Liabilities) if the sale of the Sale
                  Assets to the Prevailing Bidder, and the assumption, assignment and sale of the Executory Contracts to the
                  Prevailing Bidder, were not, except as otherwise provided in the Final APA with respect to the Assumed Liabilities
                  and Permitted Liens, free and clear of all Liens and Claims (as defined below) of any kind or nature whatsoever, or
                  if the Prevailing Bidder would, or in the future could (except and only to the extent expressly provided in the Final
                  APA and with respect to the Assumed Liabilities and the Permitted Liens), be liable for any of such Liens or Claims,
                  including, but not limited to, Liens or Claims in respect of the following: (1) any labor agreements; (2) all mortgages,
                  deeds of trust and security interests;  [*365] (3) any pension, welfare, compensation or other employee benefit
                  plans, agreements, practices and programs, including, without limitation, any pension plan of any Debtor; (4) any
                  other employee, worker's compensation, occupational disease or unemployment or temporary disability related
                  claim, including, without limitation, claims that might otherwise arise under or pursuant to (a) the Employee
                  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, (b) the Fair Labor Standards Act, (c) Title VII of the Civil
                  Rights Act of 1964, (d) the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973, (e) the National Labor Relations Act, (f) the Worker
                  Adjustment and Retraining Act of 1988, (g) the Age Discrimination and Employee Act of 1967 and Age
                  Discrimination in Employment Act, as amended, (h) the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, (i) the Consolidated
                  Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, (j) state discrimination laws, (k) state unemployment compensation
                  laws or any other similar state laws, or (l) any other state or federal benefits or claims relating to any employment
                  with any of the Debtors or any of their respective predecessors; (5) any bulk sales or similar law; (6) any tax
                  statutes or ordinances,  [*366] including, without limitation, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; (7)
                  any Environmental Law(s) (as defined in the Final APA), including, without limitation, any environmental Liens or
                  Claims arising out of, or related to, the reports referenced in APA Schedule 5.11; and (8) any theories of successor
                  liability.
                  B. The Debtors may sell the Sale Assets free and clear of all Liens and Claims against the Debtors, its estate or any
                  of the Sale Assets (except for any Permitted Liens and Assumed Liabilities under the Final APA) because, in each
                  case, one or more of the standards set forth in section 363(f)(1)-(5) of the Bankruptcy Code has been satisfied.
                  Those holders of liens or Claims against the Debtors, its estate or any of the Sale Assets who did not object, or who
                  withdrew their objections, to the Sale or the Sale Motion are deemed to have consented pursuant to section
                  363(f)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code. Those holders of such Liens or Claims who did object fall within one or more of
                  the other subsections of section 363(f) and are adequately protected by having their Liens and/or Claims, if any, in
                  each instance against the Debtors, its estate or any of the Sale Assets, attach  [*367] to the cash proceeds of the
                  Sale ultimately attributable to the Sale Assets in which such creditor alleges an interest, in the same order of
                  priority, with the same validity, force and effect that such creditor had prior to the Sale, subject to any claims and
                  defenses the Debtors and its estate may possess with respect thereto.
                  VIII. Assumption and Assignment of the Executory Contracts
                  A. The assumption and assignment of the Executory Contracts pursuant to the terms of this order is integral to the
                  Final APA and is in the best interests of the Debtors and its estate, creditors and other parties in interest, and
                  represents the reasonable exercise of sound and prudent business judgment by the Debtors.
                  
                  
                  B. The amount set forth on Exhibit B annexed hereto are the sole amounts necessary under sections 365(b)(1)(A)
                  and (B) and 365(f)(2)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code to cure all monetary defaults and pay all actual pecuniary losses
                  under the Executory Contracts (the ""Cure Amounts"").
                  C. Pursuant to the terms of the Final APA, Prevailing Bidder will: (i) cure and/or provide adequate assurance of cure
                  of any monetary default existing prior to the Closing Date under any of the Executory Contracts, within  [*368] the
                  meaning of section 365(b)(1)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code; (ii) provide compensation or adequate assurance of
                  compensation to any party for actual pecuniary loss to such party resulting from a default prior to the Closing Date
                  under any of the Executory Contracts, within the meaning of section 365(b)(1)(B) of the Bankruptcy Code; and (iii)
                  provide adequate assurance of its future performance under the relevant Executory Contracts within the meaning of
                  sections 365(b)(1)(C), 365(b)(3) (to the extent applicable) and 365(f)(2)(B) of the Bankruptcy Code.
                  IX. Compelling Circumstances for an Immediate Sale
                  A. To enhance the Debtors' level of liquidity, to reduce the amount of postpetition debtor-in-possession financing
                  borne by the Debtors, and to maximize the amount of funding available to provide for a timely exit from these
                  chapter 11 cases, it is essential that the Sale of the Assets occur within the time constraints set forth in the Final
                  APA. Time is of the essence in consummating the Sale.
                  B. Given all of the circumstances of these chapter 11 cases and the adequacy and fair value of the purchase price
                  under the Final APA, the proposed Sale of the Sale Assets to Prevailing Bidder constitutes  [*369] a reasonable
                  and sound exercise of the Debtors' business judgment and should be approved.
                  C. The consummation of the transaction is legal, valid and properly authorized under all applicable provisions of the
                  Bankruptcy Code, including, without limitation, sections 105(a), 363(b), 363(f), 363(m), 365(b) and 365(f), and all of
                  the applicable requirements of such sections have been complied with in respect of the transaction.
                  X. Use of Sale Proceeds
                  A. The Debtors shall use a portion of the Sale Proceeds to pay the Stalking Horse Bidder a Breakup Fee and
                  Expense Reimbursement. The Stalking Horse Bidder's willingness to provide a minimum floor bid and asset
                  purchase agreement facilitated the Auction process and promoted competitive bidding, leading to the highest or
                  best offer from the Prevailing Bidder. Without the Stalking Horse Bidder's initial bid, the Debtors may never have
                  obtained the favorable terms of the Final APA from the Prevailing Bidder. Payment of the Breakup Fee and
                  Expense Reimbursement is therefore appropriate pursuant to section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code.
                  B. The  [*370] Debtors shall also use a portion of the Sale Proceeds to pay down their postpetttion debtor-in-
                  possession financing.
                  XI. Objections
                  A. [As necessary]
                  NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED THAT:

                  included therein, are hereby overruled on the merits or the interests of such objections have been otherwise
                  satisfied or adequately provided for.
                  Approval of the Final APA
                  4. The Final APA and all other ancillary documents, and all of the terms and conditions thereof, are hereby
                  approved.
                  5. Pursuant to section 363(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors are authorized and empowered to take any and
                  all actions necessary or appropriate to (i) consummate the  [*371] Sale of each of the Sale Assets to the Prevailing
                  Bidder pursuant to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Final APA, (ii) close the Sale as

                  necessary or desirable to implement the Final APA and the Sale, including any other ancillary documents, or as
                  may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to the performance of the obligations as contemplated by the Final
                  APA and such other ancillary documents.
                  6. This order shall be binding in all respects upon the Debtors, including the Debtors, their estates, all holders of
                  equity interests in any Debtor, all holders of any Claim(s) (whether known or unknown) against any Debtor, any
                  holders of Liens or Claims against or on all or any portion of the Sale Assets, all Contract CounterParties, the

                  Bankruptcy Code of any of the Debtors' cases. This order and the Final APA shall inure to the benefit of the
                  Debtors, its estates, its creditors, the Prevailing Bidder and their respective successors and assigns.
                  Transfer of the Sale Assets
                  7. Pursuant to sections 105(a), 363(b), 363(f), 365(b) and 365(f) of the Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors are
                  authorized to transfer the Sale Assets on the Closing Date. Such Sale Assets shall be transferred to the Prevailing
                  Bidder upon and as of the Closing Date and such transfer shall constitute a legal, valid, binding and effective
                  transfer of such Sale Assets and, upon the Debtors' receipt of the Purchase Price, shall be free and clear of all liens
                  and claims, including, without limitation, all ""claims"" within the meaning of section 105 of the Bankruptcy Code, and
                  all interests, encumbrances, rights of setoff, recoupment, netting and deductions (""Claims""), except any Permitted
                  Liens and Assumed Liabilities under the Final APA. Upon the Closing, the Prevailing Bidder shall take title to and
                  possession of the Sale Assets subject only to the Permitted Liens and Assumed Liabilities. Pursuant to section
                  363(f) of the Bankruptcy Code, the transfer  [*373] of title to the Sale Assets and the Executory Contracts shall be
                  tree and clear of (a) any and all Liens except for Permitted Liens; (b) any and all Liabilities except for Assumed
                  Liabilities; and (c) any and all Claims including, without limitation, any and all claims pursuant to any successor or
                  successor-in-interest liability theory; provided, however, that the Prevailing Bidder shall not be relieved of liability
                  with respect to the Assumed Liabilities, including any obligations accruing under the Executory Contracts from and
                  after the Closing. All liens and/or Claims shall attach solely to the proceeds of the Sale with the same validity,
                  priority, force and effect that they now have as against the Sale Assets, subject to any claims and defenses the
                  Debtors and their estates may possess with respect thereto.
                  8. Except as expressly provided by the Final APA with respect to Permitted Liens and Assumed Liabilities, all
                  persons and entities holding Liens, Claims or interests in all or any portion of the Sale Assets arising under or out
                  of, in connection with, or in any way relating to the Debtors, the Sale Assets, the operation of the Debtors' business
                  prior to the Closing Date or the  [*374] transfer of the Sale Assets to the Prevailing Bidder, hereby are forever
                  barred, estopped and permanently enjoined from asserting against the Prevailing Bidder or its successors or
                  assigns, their property or the Sale Assets, such persons' or entities' Liens or Claims in and to the Sale Assets. On
                  the Closing Date, each creditor is authorized and directed to execute such documents and take all other actions as
                  may be deemed by the Prevailing Bidder to be necessary or desirable to release Liens (except Permitted Liens) or
                  
                  
                  Claims on the Sale Assets, if any, as provided for herein, as such Liens or Claims may have been recorded or may
                  otherwise exist.
                  9. All persons and entities are hereby forever prohibited and enjoined from taking any action that would adversely
                  affect or interfere with the ability of the Debtors to sell and transfer the Sale Assets to the Prevailing Bidder in
                  accordance with the terms of the Final APA and this order.
                  10. All persons and entities that are in possession of some or all of the Sale Assets on the Closing Date are
                  directed to surrender possession of such Sale Assets to the Prevailing Bidder or its assignee at the Closing.
                  11. A certified copy of this order may  [*375] be filed with the appropriate clerk and/or recorded with the recorder to
                  act to cancel any of the Liens, Claims and other encumbrances of record except the Permitted Liens.
                  12. If any person or entity which has filed statements or other documents or agreements evidencing Liens on,
                  Claims or interests in, all or any portion of the Sale Assets shall not have delivered to the Debtors prior to the
                  Closing, in proper form for filing and executed by the appropriate parties, termination statements, instruments of
                  satisfaction, releases of liens and easements, and any other documents necessary or desirable to the Prevailing
                  Bidder for the purpose of documenting the release of all Liens or Claims, which the person or entity has or may
                  assert with respect to all or any portion of the Sale Assets, the Debtors are hereby authorized and directed, and the
                  Prevailing Bidder is hereby authorized, to execute and file such statements, instruments, releases and other
                  documents on behalf of such person or entity with respect to the Sale Assets.
                  13. This order is and shall be binding upon and govern the acts of all persons and entities, including, without
                  limitation, all filing agents, filing officers, title  [*376] agents, title companies, recorders of mortgages, recorders of
                  deeds, registrars of deeds, administrative agencies, governmental departments, secretaries of state, federal and
                  local officials, and all other persons and entities who may be required by operation of law, the duties of their office,
                  or contract, to accept, file, register or otherwise record or release any documents or instruments, or who may be
                  required to report or insure any title or state of title in or to any lease; and each of the foregoing persons and entities
                  is hereby directed to accept for filing any and all of the documents and instruments necessary and appropriate to
                  consummate the transactions contemplated by the Final APA.
                  Executory Contracts
                  14. Upon the Closing of the Sale, the Debtors are authorized and directed to assume and assign the Executory
                  Contracts to the Prevailing Bidder free and clear of all Liens and Claims, as described herein. The payment of the
                  applicable Cure Amounts (if any) by the Prevailing Bidder shall (a) effect a cure of all defaults existing thereunder
                  as of the Closing Date, (b) compensate for any actual pecuniary loss to such non-Debtor party resulting from such
                  default, and (c) together  [*377] with the assumption of the Executory Contracts by the Prevailing Bidder, constitute
                  adequate assurance of future performance thereof. The Prevailing Bidder shall then have assumed the Executory
                  Contracts and, pursuant to section 365(f) of the Bankruptcy Code, the assignment by the Debtors of such Executory
                  Contracts shall not be a default thereunder. After the payment of the relevant Cure Amounts by the Prevailing
                  Bidder and the ""Outstanding Accounts Payable"" by the Debtors, neither the Debtors nor the Prevailing Bidder shall
                  have any further liabilities to the Contract CounterParties other than the Prevailing Bidder's obligations under the
                  Executory Contracts that accrue and become due and payable on or after the Closing Date.
                  15. Any provisions in any Executory Contracts that prohibit or condition the assignment of such Executory Contracts
                  or allow the party to such Executory Contracts to terminate, recapture, impose any penalty, condition on renewal or
                  extension or modify any term or condition upon the assignment of such Assigned Agreement, constitute
                  unenforceable anti-assignment provisions that are void and of no force and effect. All other requirements and
                  conditions under sections 363  [*378] and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code for the assumption by the Debtors and
                  assignment to the Prevailing Bidder of the Executory Contracts have been satisfied. Upon the Closing, in
                  accordance with sections 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, the Prevailing Bidder shall be fully and irrevocably
                  vested with all right, title and interest of the Debtors under the Executory Contracts.
                  
                  
                  16. Upon the Closing and the Debtors' payment of the relevant Cure Amounts, if any, the Prevailing Bidder shall be
                  deemed to be substituted for the Debtors as a party to the applicable Executory Contracts and the Debtors shall be
                  relieved, pursuant to section 365(k) of the Bankruptcy Code, from any further liability under the Executory Contracts
                  other than payment of the Outstanding Amounts Payable.
                  17. Upon the payment of the applicable Cure Amount, if any, the Executory Contracts will remain in full force and
                  effect, and no default shall exist under the Executory Contracts nor shall there exist any event or condition which,
                  with the passage of time or giving of notice, or both, would constitute such a default.
                  18. There shall be no rent accelerations, assignment fees, increases (including advertising rates) or any
                  [*379] other fees charged to Prevailing Bidder or the Debtors as a result of the assumption and assignment of the
                  Executory Contracts.
                  19. Pursuant to sections 105(a), 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, all Contract CounterParties are forever
                  barred and permanently enjoined from raising or asserting against Prevailing Bidder any assignment fee, default,
                  breach or claim or pecuniary loss, or condition to assignment, arising under or related to the Executory Contracts
                  existing as of the Closing Date or arising by reason of the Closing.
                  Other Provisions
                  20. Effective upon the Closing Date and except as otherwise provided by stipulations filed with or announced to the
                  Court with respect to a specific matter, all persons and entities are forever prohibited and permanently enjoined
                  from commencing or continuing in any manner any action or other proceeding, whether in law or equity, in any
                  judicial, administrative, arbitral or other proceeding against the Prevailing Bidder, its successors and assigns, or the
                  Sale Assets, with respect to any (a) Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) or Claim arising under, out of, in connection
                  with or in any way relating to the Debtors, the Prevailing Bidder, the Sale  [*380] Assets, or the operation of the
                  Sale Assets prior to the Closing of the Sale, or (b) successor liability, including, without limitation, the following
                  actions: (i) commencing or continuing in any manner any action or other proceeding against the Prevailing Bidder,
                  its successors or assigns, assets or properties; (ii) enforcing, attaching, collecting or recovering in any manner any
                  judgment, award, decree or order against the Prevailing Bidder, its successors, assets or properties; (iii) creating,
                  perfecting or enforcing any Lien or Claim against the Prevailing Bidder, its successors or assigns, assets or
                  properties; (iv) asserting any setoff, right of subrogation or recoupment of any kind against any obligation due the
                  Prevailing Bidder or its successors or assigns; (v) commencing or continuing any action, in any manner or place,
                  that does not comply or is inconsistent with the provisions of this order or other orders of the Court, or the
                  agreements or actions contemplated or taken in respect thereof; or (vi) revoking, terminating or failing or refusing to
                  renew any license, permit or authorization to operate any of the Sale Assets or conduct any of the businesses
                  operated with the  [*381] Sale Assets.
                  21. Except for the Permitted Liens and the Assumed Liabilities or as otherwise expressly set forth in the Final APA,
                  the Prevailing Bidder shall not have any liability or other obligation of the Debtors arising under or related to any of
                  the Sale Assets. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and except for the Permitted Liens and Assumed
                  Liabilities provided in the Final APA, the Prevailing Bidder shall not be liable for any claims against the Debtors or
                  any of its predecessors or affiliates, and the Prevailing Bidder shall have no successor or vicarious liabilities of any
                  kind or character, including, but not limited to, any theory of antitrust, environmental, successor or transferee
                  liability, labor law, de facto merger or substantial continuity, whether known or unknown as of the Closing Date, now
                  existing or hereafter arising, whether fixed or contingent, with respect to the Debtors or any obligations of the
                  Debtors arising prior to the Closing Date, including, but not limited to, liabilities on account of any taxes arising,
                  accruing or payable under, out of, in connection with, or in any way relating to the operation of any of the Sale
                  Assets prior to the  [*382] Closing. The Prevailing Bidder has given substantial consideration under the Final APA
                  for the benefit of the holders of any Liens or Claims. The consideration given by the Prevailing Bidder shall
                  constitute valid and valuable consideration for the releases of any potential claims of successor liability of the
                  Prevailing Bidder, which releases shall be deemed to have been given in favor of the Prevailing Bidder by all
                  holders of Liens or Claims against or interests in the Debtors or any of the Sale Assets.
                  
                  
                  22. The transactions contemplated by the Final APA are undertaken by the Prevailing Bidder without collusion and
                  in good faith, as that term is defined in section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code, and accordingly, the reversal or
                  modification on appeal of the authorization provided herein to consummate the Sale shall not affect the validity of
                  the Sale (including the assumption and assignment of the Executory Contracts), unless such authorization and such
                  Sale are duly stayed pending such appeal. The Prevailing Bidder is a good faith buyer within the meaning of section
                  363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code and, as such, is entitled to the full protections of section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy
                  Code.
                  23.  [*383] Nothing contained in any plan of reorganization or liquidation, or order of any type or kind entered in (i)
                  these chapter 11 cases, (ii) any subsequent chapter 7 case into which any such chapter 11 case may be converted,
                  or (ii) any related proceeding subsequent to entry of this order, shall conflict with or derogate from the provisions of
                  the Final APA or the terms of this order.
                  24. Pursuant to Bankruptcy Rules 7062, 9014, 6004(h) and 6006(d), this order shall be effective immediately upon
                  entry and the Debtors and Prevailing Bidder are authorized to close the Sale immediately upon entry of this order.
                  25. As provided in the Final APA, this order approves and provides for the transfer to Prevailing Bidder of all
                  avoidance claims (whether under chapter 5 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise) of the Debtors' estates related to,
                  or arising from, any Assumed Contract or any Assumed Lease or relating to any Assumed Liability.
                  26. No bulk sales law or any similar law of any state or other jurisdiction applies in any way to the Sale.
                  27. There are no brokers involved in consummating the Sale and no brokers' commissions are due.
                  28. The failure specifically to include any particular provision  [*384] of the Final APA in this order shall not diminish
                  or impair the effectiveness of such provision, it being the intent of the Court that the Final APA be authorized and
                  approved in its entirety.
                  29. The Final APA and any related agreements, documents or other instruments may be modified, amended or
                  supplemented by the parties thereto and in accordance with the terms thereof, without further order of the Court,
                  provided that any such modification, amendment or supplement does not have a material adverse effect on the
                  Debtors' estate.
                  30. The Court shall retain jurisdiction to, among other things, interpret, implement, and enforce the terms and
                  provisions of this order and the Final APA, all amendments thereto and any waivers and consents thereunder and
                  each of the agreements executed in connection therewith to which the Debtors are a party or which has been
                  assigned by the Debtors to the Prevailing Bidder, and to adjudicate, if necessary, any and all disputes concerning or
                  relating in any way to the Sale.
                  31. All time periods set forth in this order shall be calculated in accordance with Bankruptcy Rule 9006(a).
                  32. To the extent that this order is inconsistent with any prior order or pleading  [*385] with respect to the Sale
                  Motion in these chapter 11 cases, the terms of this order shall govern.

                  This TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT (the ""Agreement"") is made as of the     day of July, 2007, by and
                  between [DURA OPERATING CORP.], a Delaware corporation, (""Dura""), and [   ], a     (""Purchaser"").
                  BACKGROUND
                  WHEREAS, Atwood Mobile Products, Inc., an Illinois corporation and direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Dura
                  (""Atwood"") and certain Selling Affiliates of Atwood (together with Atwood, the ""Sellers"") on the one hand, and
                  Purchaser, on the other hand, have entered into a certain Asset Purchase Agreement dated July 3, 2007 (the
                  ""APA""), pursuant to which Sellers agreed to sell, transfer and assign to Purchaser certain assets and liabilities to
                  the extent used in or connected with the Business, pursuant to sections 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code;
                  WHEREAS, the Closing is occurring on me date hereof;
                  WHEREAS, Dura has, up to the date of the Closing, been performing certain corporate and  [*386] administrative
                  services for the Business;
                  WHEREAS, Dura uses certain of the facilities to be transferred to Purchaser pursuant to the APA (the ""Transferred
                  Facilities"") for activities unrelated to the Business;
                  WHEREAS, following the Closing, Purchaser wishes to receive from Dura certain services of the same quality
                  which Dura provided to the Business prior to Closing, and Dura is willing to provide such services to Purchaser for a
                  limited period, all subject to the terms and conditions hereof; and
                  WHEREAS, following the Closing, Dura desires to lease space in the Transferred Facilities for a limited period of
                  time and Purchaser is willing to provide Dura with access to such space.
                  NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein, the parties hereto (the ""Parties"")
                  intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:
                  1. Definitions. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have the same meanings ascribed to them in the
                  APA, unless separately defined herein.
                  2. Transition Services; Payment.
                  a. Following the Closing, Dura shall provide, and Purchaser shall accept and pay for, those transition services
                  which are specified in Exhibits A through G (each a ""Dura Service""  [*387] and collectively, the ""Dura
                  Services"") attached hereto and made a part hereof. Purchaser agrees to be bound by any additional
                  conditions, covenants and obligations for a specific Service as set forth in the relevant Exhibit describing such
                  Service.
                  
                  
                  Following the Closing, and for a period of nine (9) months, Purchaser shall provide, and Dura shall accept and
                  pay for, office space for certain employees of Dura, the terms of such arrangement are as set forth on Exhibit G
                  hereto (the ""Purchaser Services"" and collectively with the Dura Services, the ""Services"").
                  b. Each Service shall be provided for the period specified in the relevant Exhibit describing such Service,
                  provided that such Services provided during the (i) Initial Transition Period shall be provided at cost, (ii)
                  Services provided during the Second Transition Period shall be provided at cost plus 25% and (iii) Services
                  provided during the Third Transition shall be provided at cost plus 50%; provided, however, that the (i) the
                  Purchaser Services set forth on Exhibit G (relating to office space) and (ii) the Dura Services set forth on
                  Exhibit B (Human Resources Shared Services) and Exhibit D (Legal Services) shall be provided at  [*388] cost
                  for the duration of this Agreement and shall not be subject to the step-ups set forth in (ii) and (iii) above. As
                  compensation for the Services, the party receiving the applicable Service (the ""Receiving Party"") agrees to pay
                  to the party providing the applicable Service (the ""Providing Party"") the fees for each Service specified in the
                  relevant Exhibit describing such Service. Costs for Services provided by third parties which the Providing Party
                  arranges or incurs on behalf of the Receiving Party (""Pass Through Costs"") shall be charged at the direct third-
                  party cost.
                  c. The Providing Party shall invoice the Receiving Party at the beginning of each month for the fixed Services
                  to be provided during the succeeding month. In the case of any Services which are to be provided only upon
                  request, such Services shall be itemized and included in a monthly invoice issued following the rendering of the
                  Services. Pass Through Costs shall also be included in the monthly invoice issued following the date on which
                  they were incurred. All such invoices shall be paid within 30 days after receipt by the Receiving Party. Any
                  invoice that is not paid in accordance with the foregoing terms shall  [*389] be subject to a service charge of
                  1.5% for each month or portion thereof that such invoice remains unpaid.
                  d. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Closing Date and shall continue for an initial period of six
                  (6) months (the ""Initial Transition Period"") after me Closing Date; provided that the Receiving Party may, by
                  written notice delivered to the Providing Party, request that particular Services provided during the Initial
                  Transition Period be extended as set forth in the table below (the ""Initial Transition Period"", the ""Second
                  Transition Period"" and the ""Third Transition Period"" are collectively referred to as the ""Transition Period"").

                  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, any and all such Services provided hereunder may be
                  earlier terminated pursuant to this Section. Any and all of the Services provided by the Providing Party are
                  terminable earlier than the termination dates set forth in the Exhibits by the Receiving Party upon thirty (30) days'
                  prior written notice to the Providing Party. For termination  [*390] of Services which occur other than month-end (or
                  the applicable billing cut-off date), the Receiving Party shall pay the pro-rated fees through the date such Services
                  were ceased.
                  e. With respect to the aggregate fee for bundled Dura Services provided hereunder as set forth in the Exhibits
                  hereto, Dura shall reduce the aggregate blended fee, on a proportionate basis, to the extent such Dura Service is
                  terminated early by Purchaser.
                  f. Dura shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such assistance as Purchaser may reasonably request
                  to assist Purchaser in transitioning the Dura Services in-house such that Purchaser no longer must rely on Dura to
                  perform the Dura Services hereunder; provided, however, that Dura shall not be obligated to expend any out of
                  pocket costs for expenses to third parties associated with providing such assistance.
                  3. [Reserved.]
                  4. Representations and Warranties; Liability.
                  
                  
                  a. Dura shall use reasonable efforts to ensure that all Dura Services are of a quality that is consistent with the
                  quality of those comparable services that were rendered to the Business by Dura prior to Closing.
                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, except in the case of Dura's gross negligence  [*391] or willful misconduct,
                  Purchaser's sole remedy for any defects in performance of the Dura Services shall be for Dura to correct any
                  such defects, where reasonably possible, whether the defects are caused by Dura's breach of the foregoing
                  warranty or negligence. In addition, except in the case of Purchaser's gross negligence or willful misconduct,
                  Dura's sole remedy for any defects in performance of the Purchaser Services shall be for Purchaser to correct
                  any such defects, where reasonably possible.
                  b. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Providing Party makes no representations or warranties, express
                  or implied, under this Agreement, including, without limitation, any warranty of merchantability or warranty of
                  fitness for a particular purpose as to the Services performed hereunder. Except as otherwise provided herein,
                  and except in the case of the Providing Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct, without limiting the
                  general nature of the foregoing, the Providing Party shall have no liability for any losses (including lost time or
                  data), damages, expenses or costs resulting from delays in providing any Services (including any emergency
                  response services), or any utility  [*392] outages, errors in transmission, unavailability, delays or any other
                  failure of the computer or communications systems or support utilized in the provision of the Services, whether
                  such delays, outages, errors or other failures are caused by the Providing Party's breach of warranty or
                  negligence.
                  c. If the Providing Party is or will be unable to deliver the Services, or any of them, in whole or in part, (whether
                  or not such inability was foreseeable or within the contemplation of either party to this Agreement), the
                  Providing Party shall notify the Receiving Party, in writing, as soon as practicable of such inability and its best
                  assessment of its likely duration and the Providing Party's ability to continue to provide such affected Services
                  at a reduced level during the continuation of such event. In such event, the Providing Party shall make all
                  reasonable efforts to remove such disruption of Services in accordance with its standard operating procedures.
                  In the event that the Providing Party shall be able to supply some continuing level of affected Services during
                  the duration of the event, it shall allocate such affected Services among the Receiving Party and its internal
                  customers  [*393] for such Services on such basis as is fair and reasonable.
                  d. In no event shall the Providing Party be liable for any total or partial failure to deliver Services if such failure
                  is due to any circumstance or event beyond the reasonable control of the Providing Party (""Force Majeure
                  Event""). Further, even in the absence of a Force Majeure Event, except as otherwise provided herein, in no
                  event shall the Providing Party be liable to the Receiving Party in an amount greater than the monthly fee in
                  respect of the Service which is judged to be deficient. In no event shall either Party be liable for any indirect,
                  incidental or consequential damages flowing from any breach of its obligations in this Agreement.
                  e. The Receiving Party shall indemnify, and hold harmless, the Providing Party, its Affiliates, and their
                  respective directors, officers and employees, against all losses which might arise or result from the Receiving
                  Party's use of the Services, including, without limitation, any third party claims resulting from the performance
                  of such Services. Upon written request from the Providing Party, the Receiving Party shall assume the defense
                  of any action or proceeding which is subject to  [*394] indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this
                  paragraph; provided that no such action shall be settled without the prior written consent of the Providing Party,
                  unless the settlement involves only the payment of monetary damages which are solely discharged by the
                  Receiving Party. Notwithstanding the obligations of the Receiving Party pursuant to this Section 4, the
                  Receiving Party shall not be required to indemnify the Providing Party for any claims resulting from the
                  Providing Party's failure to obtain any required consent for Services provided hereunder.
                  5. Confidentiality.
                  a. In the process of providing and receiving the Services or otherwise in connection with this Agreement, a
                  Party may have access to Confidential Information (as hereinafter defined) of the other Party. Without limiting
                  the applicability of any other obligation of confidentiality to which the Parties or their Affiliates may be bound,
                  each Party agrees to keep (and cause its Affiliates to keep) any Confidential Information of the other Party
                  strictly in confidence, not to disclose it to any third party without prior written approval of the other Party and to
                  
                  
                  use it only for the purpose of this Agreement, except  [*395] (a) as required by law, in which case the receiving
                  Party shall notify the other Party prior to disclosing such Confidential Information and shall use its best efforts
                  to obtain a protective order or otherwise prevent or minimize disclosure of such Confidential Information, or (b)
                  with the express prior written approval of the other Party.
                  b. For purposes of this Agreement, ""Confidential Information"" means any confidential information with respect
                  to, including, without limitation, methods of operation, customers, customer lists, Products, prices, fees, costs,
                  Technology, inventions, trade secrets, know-how, software, marketing methods, plans, personnel, suppliers,
                  competitors, markets or other specialized information or proprietary matters. The obligation of confidentiality set
                  forth in Section 5.a above shall not extend to: (a) information that at the time of disclosure was in the public
                  domain or thereafter comes into the public domain through no fault of the receiving Party; (b) information that
                  was known to the receiving Party prior to disclosure by me disclosing Party as substantiated by dated
                  documentation in the files of the receiving Party; and (c) information that becomes  [*396] known to the
                  receiving Party from a source other than the disclosing Party without breach of this Agreement by the receiving
                  Party and not otherwise in violation of the disclosing Party's rights.
                  6. Independent Contractor. The Providing Party shall be deemed to be an independent contractor of the Receiving
                  Party, and not an employee, agent, partner or joint venture partner of the Receiving Party in the performance of its
                  obligations hereunder. The Receiving Party shall be responsible for payments to third party vendors, subject to any
                  reimbursement of costs as set forth in the Exhibits hereto, as well as compensation and benefits to its personnel
                  assigned to perform the Services hereunder, including, but not limited to, worker's compensation, disability benefits,
                  unemployment insurance and withholding, employment or any other taxes imposed or assessed on such
                  employees.
                  7. Entire Agreement Amendment. This Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between me Parties concerning
                  the subject matter of this Agreement. It supersedes all previous representations, negotiations, warranties,
                  understandings and agreements in respect of me provision of services by Dura or Purchaser, as applicable,
                  [*397] to the other Party. No modification of this Agreement or waiver of any of its terms or conditions shall be of
                  any force or effect unless made in writing and signed by both Parties hereto. No modification of this Agreement
                  shall be effected by the acknowledgment or acceptance of a purchase order or other standard form of either Party
                  (or Affiliate thereof) or any other document containing terms and conditions at variance with or in addition to those
                  set forth herein, all such varying or additional terms being hereby objected to.
                  8. Waiver. The failure of either Party to require the performance of any term or condition of this Agreement or the
                  waiver by either Party of any breach under this Agreement shall not prevent a subsequent enforcement of such
                  term or condition nor be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach.
                  9. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code
                  and to the extent not consistent with the Bankruptcy Code, the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts
                  made and performed in such State.
                  10. Notices. All notices and other communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed
                  given (i)  [*398] when delivered personally by hand (with written confirmation of receipt), (ii) when sent by facsimile
                  (with written confirmation of transmission) or (iii) one Business Day following the day sent by overnight courier (with

                  To prevail on an application for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction, a plaintiff must demonstrate
                  (1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) that he will suffer irreparable harm absent the relief
                  requested; (3) that other interested parties will not be harmed if the requested relief is granted; and (4) that the
                  public interest supports granting the requested relief. These four factors should be balanced, and a particularly
                  strong showing in one area can justify an injunction even if the showings in other areas are rather weak. However, if
                  a plaintiff has no likelihood of success on the merits, inquiry into the remaining factors is unnecessary, for the
                  injunctive relief must be denied on that ground alone.

                  Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(2) provides that an attorney for the government must not disclose a matter occurring before
                  the grand jury. The phrase ""matters occurring before the grand jury"" encompasses not only what has occurred and
                  what is occurring, but also what is likely to occur, including the identities of witnesses, the strategy or direction of
                  the investigation and the like.

                  The mere possibility that an individual is a subject of a grand jury investigation -- a matter that is unknown -- does
                  not, under the law of United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, prohibit the government from disclosing
                  his name in other contexts, for disclosure of information that is only coincidentally before the grand jury (i.e, the
                  name of a person of interest) is not prohibited by Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e) as long as it does not elucidate the inner
                  workings of the grand jury.

                  ]  Grand Juries, Secrecy
                  The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has never read Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e) to require that a veil
                  of secrecy be drawn over all matters occurring in the world that happen to be investigated by a grand jury. The
                  disclosure of information coincidentally before the grand jury which can be revealed in such a manner that its
                  revelation would not elucidate the inner workings of the grand jury is not prohibited. The purposes of R. 6(e), as well
                  as the text of the Rule itself, reflect the need to preserve the secrecy of the grand jury proceedings themselves. It is
                  therefore necessary to differentiate between statements by a prosecutor's office with respect to its own
                  investigation, and statements by a prosecutor's office with respect to a grand jury's investigation, a distinction of the
                  utmost significance upon which several circuits have already remarked. Information actually presented to the grand
                  jury is core R. 6(e) material that is afforded the broadest possible protection from disclosure. Prosecutors'
                  statements about their investigation, however, implicate the Rule only when they directly reveal grand jury matters.

                  A discussion of actions taken by government attorneys or officials -- e.g., a recommendation by the Justice
                  Department attorneys to department officials that an indictment be sought against an individual -- does not reveal
                  
                  
                  any information about matters occurring before the grand jury. Nor does a statement of opinion as to an individual's
                  potential criminal liability violate the dictates of Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e).

                  HN7[
                  ]  Procedural Due Process, Scope of Protection
                  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment protects an individual from governmental accusations of criminal
                  misconduct without providing a proper forum for vindication. Where the state attaches a badge of infamy to the
                  citizen, due process comes into play. The more typical case involves an aggrieved person seeking to expunge an
                  indictment revealing his identity as an unindicted co-conspirator; courts generally have found such disclosures to
                  violate the due process rights of the person revealed. However, due process protection is not limited to accusations
                  against the uncharged in an indictment, but rather extends to other criminal accusations made by a government
                  attorney, including accusations in factual proffers and other court memoranda."
