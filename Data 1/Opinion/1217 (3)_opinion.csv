I concur in the result, since the challenged order is one sustaining special exceptions to the pleading of the State of 
Texas. I find nothing in such pleadings which support the trial court's conclusion that the Texas statute is 
unconstitutional. Any determination of the validity or invalidity of the Texas statute necessarily rests on the facts of 
the case. I would make no sweeping declarations concerning the validity [**17]  of the statute in the absence of 
evidence establishing the effect of the challenged transaction as applied to the facts of this case. It is not the office 
of a special exception to obtain a ruling based on facts not established by the challenged pleading. The Texas 
statute is not unconstitutional on its face, and the pleaded facts are insufficient to support a finding of 
unconstitutionality.

]  Motions to Dismiss, Failure to State Claim
A complaint should not be dismissed unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in 
support of his claim which would entitle him to relief. This rule applies with no less force to antitrust claim.

Section 4 of the Clayton Act provides in relevant part: Any person who is injured in his business or property by 
reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefore . . . and is permitted to recover three-fold the 
damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee.  15 U.S.C.S. § 15.

Section 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.S. § 26, concerns equitable relief, stating in relevant part: Any person, firm, 
corporation, or association is entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief . . . against threatened loss or damage by 
a violation of the antitrust laws . . . when and under the same conditions and principles as injunctive relief against 
threatened conduct that will cause loss or damage is granted by courts of equity, under the rules governing such 
proceedings.

In each antitrust case plaintiff's alleged injury must be analyzed to determine whether it is of the type that the 
antitrust statute was intended to forestall.
Antitrust & Trade Law > ... > Private Actions > Standing > General Overview
Civil Procedure > ... > Justiciability > Standing > General Overview
HN6[
]  Private Actions, Standing
All antitrust lawsuits require a tripartite standing analysis which considers the following: (a) the harm suffered by the 
plaintiff; (2) the alleged wrongdoing by the defendants; and (3) the relationship between them.

HN7[
]  Private Actions, Standing
The focus of the doctrine of ""antitrust standing"" is somewhat different from that of standing as a constitutional 
doctrine. Harm to the antitrust plaintiffs is sufficient to satisfy the constitutional standing requirement of injury in fact, 
but the court must make a further determination whether the plaintiff is a proper party to bring a private antitrust 
action.
Antitrust & Trade Law > ... > Private Actions > Standing > General Overview
HN8[
]  Private Actions, Standing
""Relevant"" factors which support defendants' claim that unions lack standing to sue include: the tenuous and 
speculative character of the relationship between the alleged antitrust violation and the unions' alleged injury; the 
potential for duplicative recovery or complex apportionment of damages; and the existence of more direct victims of 
the alleged conspiracy.

The existence of an identifiable class of persons whose self-interest would motivate them to vindicate the public 
interest in antitrust enforcement diminishes the justification for allowing a more remote party such as the unions to 
perform the office of a private attorney general.

Where ""labor interests"" predominate, an alleged antitrust injury is simply not of the type that the antitrust statute 
was intended to forestall.

HN11[
]  Private Actions, Remedies

 
The United States Supreme Court notes two factors whose presence causes antitrust damage claims to be 
speculative: (1) where an identifiable class of persons more directly injured by the complained of activity exists; and 
(2) where the alleged damages may have been produced by independent factors.
Antitrust & Trade Law > ... > Private Actions > Standing > General Overview
HN12[
]  Private Actions, Standing
Where unions are neither participants in the relevant market as competitors or consumers nor direct victims of the 
alleged restraint, they lack standing to sue under the antitrust laws, even though the unions allege that the 
defendants have in fact caused their injuries and have intended to harm them.

Equitable relief under Section 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.S. § 26, is characteristically available even though 
the plaintiff has not yet suffered actual injury. The plaintiff need only demonstrate a significant threat of injury from 
an impending violation of the antitrust laws or from a contemporary violation likely to continue to recur.

Section 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.S. § 26, should be construed and applied with the knowledge that the 
remedy it affords, like other equitable remedies, is flexible and capable of nice adjustment and reconciliation 
between the public interest and private needs as well as between competing private claims. Its availability should 
be conditioned by the necessities of the public interest which Congress seeks to protect.

It is clear that standing under § 16 of the Clayton Act is less restrictive than under § 4. It remains, however, 
necessary for an antitrust litigant to sufficiently demonstrate that the threatened harm is of the type that the antitrust 
statute was intended to forestall."
