9,2," 181 U. S. App. D. C. 41, 555 F.2d 978 (1977). When the 
District Court's original judgment was entered, petitioner was 
entitled to appeal directly to this Court.  We vacated the 
District Court's judgment for reconsideration in the light of our 
then recent decision in Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 
773. 422 U.S. 1031. After reconsideration, the District Court 
re-entered its original judgment, 404 F.Supp. 457 (DC 1975), 
and petitioner then appealed to the Court of Appeals."
9,1, 389 F.Supp. 1193 (DC 1974).
10,3," That section, which remained in effect at the time of trial, 
provided: ""Section 11 -- The Engineer will not compete unfairly with 
another engineer by attempting to obtain employment or 
advancement or professional engagements by competitive 
bidding . . . .
 ""c.  He shall not solicit or submit engineering proposals on the 
basis of competitive bidding. Competitive bidding for 
professional engineering services is defined as the formal or 
informal submission, or receipt, of verbal or written estimates 
of cost or proposals in terms of dollars, man days of work 
required, percentage of construction cost, or any other 
measure of compensation whereby the prospective client may 
compare engineering services on a price basis prior to the 
time that one engineer, or one engineering organization, has 
been 
selected 
for 
negotiations. 
The 
disclosure 
of 
recommended fee schedules prepared by various engineering 
societies is not considered to constitute competitive bidding. 
An Engineer requested to submit a fee proposal or bid prior to 
the selection of an engineer or firm subject to the negotiation 
of a satisfactory contract, shall attempt to have the procedure 
changed to conform to ethical practices, but if not successful 
he shall withdraw from consideration for the proposed work.  
These principles shall be applied by the Engineer in obtaining 
the services of other professions."" App. 9951.
"
10,4," 389 F.Supp., at 1206. In addition to § 11 (c) of the Society's 
Code of Ethics, see n. 3, supra, the Society's Board of 
Directors 
has 
adopted 
various 
""Professional 
Policy"" 
statements.  Policy statement 10-F was issued to ""make it 
clear beyond all doubt"" that the Society opposed competitive 
bidding for all engineering projects.  389 F.Supp., at 1206. 
This policy statement was replaced in 1972 by Policy 10-G 
which permits price quotations for certain types of engineering 
work -- in particular, research and development projects."
10,5," Although the Society argues that it has never ""enforced"" its 
ban on competitive bidding, Reply Brief for Petitioner 15-18, 
the District Court specifically found that the record ""[supports] 
a finding that NSPE and its members actively pursue a course 
of policing adherence to the competitive bid ban through direct 
and indirect communication with members and prospective 
clients."" 389 F.Supp., at 1200. This finding has not been 
challenged as clearly erroneous."
10,6," Having been selected, the engineer may then, in accordance 
with the Society's canons of ethics, negotiate a satisfactory fee 
arrangement with the client.  If the negotiations are 
unsuccessful, then the client may withdraw his selection and 
approach a new engineer. Id., at 1215."
11,7," The entire defense pleaded in the answer reads as follows: ""18.  (a) The principles and standards contained in the NSPE 
Code of Ethics, particularly those contained in that part of the 
NSPE Code of Ethics set out above, are reasonable, 
necessary to the public health, safety and welfare insofar as 
they are affected by the work of professional engineers, and 
serve the the public interest.
 ""(b) Experience has demonstrated that competitive bidding for 
professional engineering services is inconsistent with securing 
for the recipients of such services the most economical 
projects or structures.  Testing, calculating and designing the 
most economical and efficient structures and methods of 
construction is complex, difficult and expensive.  It is cheaper 
and easier to design and specify inefficient and unnecessarily 
expensive 
structures 
and 
methods 
of 
construction.  
Consequently, if professional engineers are required by 
competitive pressures to submit bids in order to obtain 
employment of their services, the inevitable tendency will be to 
offer professional engineering services at the lowest possible 
price.  Although this may result in some lowering of the cost of 
professional engineering services it will inevitably result in 
increasing the overall cost and decreasing the efficiency of 
those structures and projects which require professional 
engineering design and specification work.
 ""(c) Experience has also demonstrated that competitive 
bidding in most instances and situations results in an award of 
the work to be performed to the lowest bidder, regardless of 
other factors such as ability, experience, expertise, skill, 
capability, learning and the like, and that such awards in the 
case of professional engineers endanger the public health, 
welfare and safety.
 ""(d) For the aforesaid reasons, the provisions of the NSPE 
Code of Ethics set out above are not, in any event, in 
unreasonable restraint of interstate trade or commerce."" App. 
21-22.
"
11,8," The Court of Appeals struck down the portion of the District 
Court's decree that ordered the Society to state that it did not 
consider competitive bidding to be unethical.  181 U. S. App. 
D. C., at 47, 555 F.2d, at 984. The court reasoned that this 
provision was ""more intrusive than necessary to achieve 
fulfillment of the governmental interest."" Ibid.  The Government 
has not petitioned for review of that decision."
12,9," Section 1 of the Sherman Act, as set forth in 15 U. S. C. § 1 
(1976 ed.), provides: HN2[
] ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or 
otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce 
among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared 
to be illegal. . . .""
"
12,10,"   LEdHN[2B][
] [2B]""But the legality of an agreement or 
regulation cannot be determined by so simple a test, as 
whether it restrains competition.  Every agreement concerning 
trade, every regulation of trade, restrains. To bind, to restrain, 
is of their very essence."" Chicago Board of Trade v. United 
States, 246 U.S. 231, 238.
 See also United States v. Topco Associates, 405 U.S. 596, 
606:
 ""Were § 1 to be read in the narrowest possible way, any 
commercial contract could be deemed to violate it.""

Sherman); see generally H. Thorelli, Federal Antitrust Policy 
228-229 (1955)."
12,12," ""4thly, The fourth reason is in favour of these contracts, and 
is, that there may happen instances wherein they may be 
useful and beneficial, as . . . in case of an old man, who 
finding himself under such circumstances either of body or 
mind, as that he is likely to be a loser by continuing his trade, 
in this case it will be better for him to part with it for a 
consideration, that by selling his custom, he may procure to 
himself a livelihood, which he might probably have lost, by 
trading longer."" 1 P. Wms., at 191, 24 Eng. Rep., at 350."
13,15," ""Without going into detail and but very briefly surveying the 
whole field, it may be with accuracy said that the dread of 
enhancement of prices and of other wrongs which it was 
thought would flow from the undue limitation on competitive 
conditions caused by contracts or other acts of individuals or 
corporations, led, as a matter of public policy, to the prohibition 
or treating as illegal all contracts or acts which were 
unreasonably restrictive of competitive conditions, either from 
the nature or character of the contract or act or where the 
surrounding circumstances were such as to justify the 
conclusion that they had not been entered into or performed 
with the legitimate purpose of reasonably forwarding personal 
interest and developing trade, but on the contrary were of such 
a character as to give rise to the inference or presumption that 
they had been entered into or done with the intent to do wrong 
to the general public and to limit the right of individuals, thus 
restraining the free flow of commerce and tending to bring 
about the evils, such as enhancement of prices, which were 
considered to be against public policy."" 221 U.S., at 58."
13,16," Throughout the Court's opinion the emphasis is on 
economic conceptions.  For instance, the Court's description 
of the common-law treatment of engrossing and forestalling 
statutes noted that contracts which had been illegal on their 
face were later recognized as reasonable because they 
tended to promote competition.  Id., at 55. As was pointed out 
in the Report of the Attorney General's National Committee To 
Study the Antitrust Laws 11 (1955):  LEdHN[8B][
] [8B]""While Standard Oil gave the courts 
 discretion in interpreting the word 'every' in Section 1, such 
discretion is confined to consideration of whether in each case 
the conduct being reviewed under the Act constitutes an 
undue restraint of competitive conditions, or a monopolization, 
or an attempt to monopolize.  This standard permits the courts 
to decide whether conduct is significantly and unreasonably 
anticompetitive in character or effect; it makes obsolete once 
prevalent 
arguments, 
such 
as, 
whether 
monopoly 
arrangements would be socially preferable to competition in a 
particular industry, because, for example, of high fixed costs or 
the risks of 'cut-throat' competition or other similar unusual 
conditions.""
"
13,13," 85 F., at 293. See also United States v. Trans-Missouri 
Freight Assn., 166 U.S. 290, 340-342."
13,14," Congress has exempted certain industries from the full 
reach of the Sherman Act. See, e. g., 7 U. S. C. §§ 291-292 
(1976 ed.) (Capper-Volstead Act, agricultural cooperatives); 
15 U. S. C. §§ 1011-1013 (1976 ed.) (McCarran-Ferguson Act, 
insurance); 49 U. S. C. § 5b (Reed-Bulwinkle Act, rail and 
motor carrier rate-fixing bureaus); 15 U. S. C. § 1801 (1976 
ed.) (newspaper joint operating agreements)."
14,19," The Society also points out that competition, in the form of 
bargaining between the engineer and customer, is allowed 
under its canon of ethics once an engineer has been initially 
selected.  See n. 6, supra.  It then contends that its prohibition 
of competitive bidding regulates only the timing of competition, 
thus making this case analogous to Chicago Board of Trade, 
where the Court upheld an exchange rule which forbade 
exchange members from making purchases after the close of 
the day's session at any price other than the closing bid price.  
Indeed, petitioner has reprinted the Government's brief in that 
case to demonstrate that the Solicitor General regarded the 
exchange's rule as a form of price fixing. Reply Brief for 
Petitioner A1-A28.  We find this reliance on Chicago Board of 
Trade misplaced for two reasons.  First, petitioner's claim 
mistakenly treats negotiation between a single seller and a 
single buyer as the equivalent of competition between two or 
more potential sellers. Second, even if we were to accept the 
Society's equation of bargaining with price competition, our 
concern with Chicago Board of Trade is in its formulation of 
the proper test to be used in judging the legality of an"
14,17," In Continental T. V., Inc., the Court explained the Rule of 
Reason standard as follows: ""Under this rule, the factfinder weighs all of the circumstances 
of a case in deciding whether a restrictive practice should be 
prohibited as imposing an unreasonable restraint on 
competition."" 433 U.S., at 49.
 The Court then analyzed the ""market impact"" of vertical 
restraints, noting their complexity because of the potential for 
a simultaneous reduction of intrabrand competition and 
stimulation of interbrand competition.  Id., at 50-51. 
""Competitive 
impact"" 
and 
""economic 
analysis"" 
were 
emphasized throughout the opinion.
"
14,18," See generally Attorney General's Report, supra n. 16, at 10-
11; Bork, The Rule of Reason and the Per Se Concept: Price 
Fixing and Market Division, 74 Yale L. J. 775 (1965); L. 
Sullivan, Law of Antitrust 165-197 (1977)."
15,," agreement; that formulation unquestionably stresses impact 
on competition.  Whatever one's view of the application of the 
Rule of Reason in that case, see Sullivan, supra n. 18, at 175-
182, the Court considered the exchange's regulation of price 
information as having a positive effect on competition.  246 
U.S., at 240-241. The District Court's findings preclude a 
similar conclusion concerning the effect of the Society's 
""regulation.""
"
15,20," We, of course, express no view on the truth of this assertion, 
although it might be noted that the Society has allowed 
competitive bidding for some types of engineering projects in 
this country, see n. 4, supra, and, at one time, allowed 
competitive bidding for all engineering work in foreign 
countries ""as required by the laws, regulations or practices of 
the foreign country."" App. 6487.  This rule, called the ""When-
in-Rome"" clause, was abolished in 1968.  Id., at 6344."
15,21," Indeed, Congress has decided not to require competitive 
bidding for Government purchases of engineering services."
15,," The Brooks Act, 40 U. S. C. §§ 541-544 (1970 ed., Supp. V), 
requires the Government to use a method of selecting 
engineers similar to the Society's ""traditional method."" See n. 
6, supra.  The Society relies heavily on the Brooks Act as 
evidence that its ban on competitive bidding is reasonable.  
The argument is without merit.  The Brooks Act does not even 
purport to exempt engineering services from the antitrust laws, 
and the reasonableness of an individual purchaser's decision 
not to seek lower prices through competition does not 
authorize the vendors to conspire to impose that same 
decision on all other purchasers.
"
16,25," LEdHN[14B][
] [14B]Petitioner contends the judgment is 
both an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech and an 
unconstitutional prohibition against free association."
16,26," Thus, in Goldfarb, although the bar association believed that 
its fee schedule accurately reflected ethical price levels, it was 
nonetheless 
enjoined 
""from 
adopting, 
publishing, 
or 
distributing any future schedules of minimum or suggested 
fees."" Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 355 F.Supp. 491, 495-
496 (ED Va. 1973). See also United States v. National Assn. 
of Real Estate Boards, 339 U.S. 485."
16,22," Courts have, for instance, upheld marketing restraints 
related to the safety of a product, provided that they have no 
anticompetitive effect and that they are reasonably ancillary to 
the seller's main purpose of protecting the public from harm or 
itself from product liability.  See, e. g., Tripoli Co. v. Wella 
Corp., 425 F.2d 932 (CA3 1970) (en banc); cf.  Continental T. 
V., 433 U.S., at 55 n. 23."
16,23," See n. 8, supra."
16,24, See App. 9974-9980.
17,27," For instance, the Society argues that the injunction can be 
read as prohibiting it from opposing repeal of statutes such as 
the Brooks Act, see n. 21, supra, and that such a prohibition 
would violate the principles of the Noerr-Pennington doctrine.  
See Eastern Railroad Presidents Conf. v. Noerr Motor Freight, 
Inc., 365 U.S. 127; Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 
657. By its terms the injunction contains no such prohibition, 
and indeed the Government contends that ""[nothing] in the 
judgment prevents NSPE and its members from attempting to 
influence governmental action . . . ."" Brief for United States 60."
18,*," This Court has not always applied the Rule of Reason with 
such rigor even to commercial businesses.  See Appalachian 
Coals, Inc. v. United States, 288 U.S. 344 (1933); Chicago 
Board of Trade v. United States, 246 U.S. 231 (1918); L. 
Sullivan, Law of Antitrust 175-182 (1977); R. Bork, The 
Antitrust Paradox 41-47, 56 (1978).  I intimate no view as to 
the correctness of those decisions."
