American Airlines, Inc., as amicus curiae urging reversal."
6,," provides the downhill skiing services at Highlands Mountain. 
Throughout this opinion we refer to both the respondent and 
its mountain as Highlands.
"
6,4," In 1958, Friedl Pfeiffer and Arthur Pfister began developing 
the ranches they owned at the base of Buttermilk Mountain 
into a third ski area.  Pfeiffer, a former Olympian, was the 
director of the ski school for Ski Co., and the runs he laid out 
were primarily for beginners and intermediate skiers. More 
advanced runs have since been developed.  The base area of 
Buttermilk is located approximately 2 1/4 miles from the village 
of Aspen.  Id., at 152, 1471-1472, 1526; Deposition of Paul 
Nitze 6-7."
6,5," In the early 1960's William Janss, a former ski racer, and his 
associates had acquired three ranches in the Snowmass 
Valley, and had secured Forest Service permits for a ski area.  
The developer sold the company holding the permits to Ski 
Co. to allow it to develop a downhill skiing facility for the 
project, leaving him to develop the land at the base of the site.  
A fairly balanced mountain was developed with a mixture of 
beginner, intermediate, and advanced runs.  Id., at 14-16; Tr. 
1475-1476.  The base area of Snowmass is eight miles from 
the village of Aspen."
6,6," Id., at 378-379, 638, 2040-2051, 2069-2070, 2078-2082."
6,7," Friedl Pfeiffer, one of the developers of Buttermilk, initiated 
the idea of an all-Aspen ticket at a luncheon with the owner of 
Highlands and the President of Ski Co.  Pfeiffer, a native of 
Austria, informed his competitors that ""'[in] St. Anton, we have 
a mountain that has three different lift companies -- lifts owned 
by three different lift companies. . . .  We sell a ticket that is"
6,1," The statute provides, in relevant part: HN1[
] ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to 
monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or 
persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce 
among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be 
deemed guilty of a felony . . . ."" 15 U. S. C. § 2.
"
6,2," Ski Co. developed Ajax in 1946.  The runs are quite steep 
and primarily designed for expert or advanced intermediate 
skiers. The base area of Ajax is located within the village of 
Aspen."
6,3," In 1957, the United States Forest Service suggested that 
Ajax ""was getting crowded, and . . . that a ski area ought to be 
started at Highlands."" Tr. 150.  Whipple V. N. Jones, who 
owned an Aspen lodge at the time, discussed the project with 
Ski Co. officials, but they expressed little interest, telling him 
that they had ""plenty of problems at Aspen now, and we don't 
think we want to expand skiing in Aspen."" Id., at 150-151. 
Jones went ahead with the project on his own, and laid out a 
well-balanced 
set 
of 
ski 
runs: 
25% 
beginner, 
50% 
intermediate, 25% advanced.  The base area of Highlands 
Mountain is located 1 1/2 miles from the village of Aspen.  Id., 
at 154. Respondent Aspen Highlands Skiing Corporation"
7,8," Id., at 167.  Highlands' share of the total market during those 
seasons, as measured in skier visits was 15.8% in 1973-1974, 
17.1% in 1974-1975, 17.4% in 1975-1976, and 20.5% in 1976-
1977.  Record Ex. No. 97, App. 183."
7,9," In 1975, the Colorado Attorney General filed a complaint 
against Ski Co. and Highlands alleging, in part, that the 
negotiations over the 4-area ticket had provided them with a 
forum for price fixing in violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act and 
that they had attempted to monopolize the market for downhill 
skiing services in Aspen in violation of § 2. Record Ex. X.  In 
1977, the case was settled by a consent decree that permitted 
the parties to continue to offer the 4-area ticket provided that 
they set their own ticket prices unilaterally before negotiating 
its terms.  Tr. 229-231."
7,10," About 15-20% of each company's ticket revenues were 
derived from sales to tour operators at a wholesale discount of 
10-15%, while 80-85% of the ticket revenues were derived 
from sales to skiers in Aspen.  Id., at 623, 1772."
7,," interchangeable.' It was good on any of those lifts; and he 
said, 'I think we should do the same thing here.'"" Id., at 153.
"
8,12," Ski Co. circulated another advertisement to national 
magazines labeled ""Aspen, More Mountains, More Fun."" App. 
184.  The advertisement depicted the four mountains of 
Aspen, but labeled only Ajax, Buttermilk, and Snowmass.  
Buttermilk's label is erroneously placed directly over Highlands 
Mountain. Tr. 860, 1803."
8,13," Highlands' owner explained that there was a key difference 
between the 3-day, 3-area ticket and the 6-day, 3-area ticket: 
""with the three day ticket, a person could ski on the . . . Aspen 
Skiing Corporation mountains for three days and then there 
would be three days in which he could ski on our mountain; 
but with the six-day ticket, we are absolutely locked out of 
those people."" Id., at 245.  As a result of ""tremendous 
consumer demand"" for a 3-day ticket, Ski Co. reinstated it late 
in the 1978-1979 season, but without publicity or a discount off 
the daily rate.  Id., at 622."
8,14," In the 1977-1978 negotiations, Ski Co. previously had 
refused to consider the sale of any tickets to Highlands, noting"
8,11," The 1976-1977 season was ""a no snow year."" There were 
less than half as many skier visits (529,800) in that season as 
in either 1975-1976 (1,238,500) or 1977-1978 (1,273,400).  
Record Ex. No. 97, App. 183.  In addition, Highlands opened 
earlier than Ski Co.'s mountains and its patrons skied off all 
the good snow.  Ski Co. waited until January and had a better 
base for the rest of the season. Tr. 228."
9,17," See Record Ex. No. 91; Tr. 488, 571-572, 692-694, 698, 
701-702.  Highlands' ski school had an outstanding reputation, 
and its share of the ski school market had always 
outperformed Highlands' share of the downhill skiing market.  
Id., at 1822.  Even some Ski Co. officials had sent their 
children to ski school at Highlands.  Id., at 560-570, 588.  After 
the elimination of the 4-area ticket, however, families or 
groups purchasing 3-area tickets were reluctant to enroll a 
beginner among them in the Highlands ski school when the 
more experienced skiers would have to leave to ski at Ajax, 
Buttermilk, or Snowmass.  Id., at 571."
9,18," Highlands also alleged that Ski Co. had conspired with 
various third parties in violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act. The 
District Court allowed this claim to go to the jury which 
rendered a verdict in Ski Co.'s favor.  App. 189."
9,19," In United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 570-571 
(1966), we explained: HN2[
] ""The offense of monopoly under § 2 of the Sherman 
 Act has two elements: (1) the possession of monopoly power 
in the relevant market and (2) the willful acquisition or 
maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or 
development as a consequence of a superior product, 
business acumen, or historic accident.""
"
9,," that it was ""obviously not interested in helping sell"" a package 
competitive with the 3-area ticket. Record Ex. No. 16; Tr. 269-
270.  Later, in the 1978-1979 negotiations, Ski Co.'s vice 
president of finance told a Highlands official that ""[we] will not 
have anything to do with a four-area ticket sponsored by the 
Aspen Highlands Skiing Corporation."" Id., at 335.  When the 
Highlands official inquired why Ski Co. was taking this position 
considering that Highlands was willing to pay full retail value 
for the daily lift tickets, the Ski Co. official answered tersely: 
""we will not support our competition."" Ibid.
"
9,15," Of course, there was nothing to identify Highlands as the 
source of these instruments, unless someone saw the skier 
""taking it out of an Adventure Pack envelope."" Id., at 505.  For 
the 1981-1982 season, Ski Co. set its single ticket price at $ 
22 and discounted the 3-area, 6-day ticket to $ 114.  
According to Highlands, this price structure made the 
Adventure Pack unprofitable.  Id., at 535."
9,16," In these seasons, Buttermilk Mountain, in particular, 
substantially increased its market share at the expense of 
Highlands.  Record Ex. BB; Tr. 1806."
10,21," It answered this interrogatory affirmatively: ""Willful Acquisition, Maintenance or Use of Monopoly Power: 
Do you find by a preponderance of the evidence that the 
defendants willfully acquired, maintained or used monopoly 
power by anticompetitive or exclusionary means or for 
anticompetitive or exclusionary purposes, rather than primarily 
as a consequence of a superior product, superior business 
sense, or historic accident?"" Id., at 189.
"
10,22," Counsel also appears to have argued that Ski Co. was 
under a legal obligation to refuse to participate in any joint 
marketing arrangement with Highlands: ""Aspen Skiing Corporation is required to compete.  It is 
required to make independent decisions.  It is required to price 
its own product.  It is required to make its own determination of 
the ticket that it chooses to offer and the tickets that it chooses 
not to offer."" Tr. 1454.
 In this Court, Ski Co. does not question the validity of the joint 
marketing arrangement under § 1 of the Sherman Act. Thus, 
we have no occasion to consider the circumstances that might 
permit such combinations in the skiing industry.  See generally 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Board of Regents of Univ. 
"
10,20," The jury found that the relevant product market was 
""[downhill] skiing at destination ski resorts,"" that the ""Aspen 
area"" was a relevant geographic submarket, and that during 
the years 1977-1981, Ski Co. possessed monopoly power, 
defined as the power to control prices in the relevant market or 
to exclude competitors. See App. 187-188."

(1979); Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 
36, 51-57 (1977).
"
11,23," The District Court also entered an injunction requiring the 
parties to offer jointly a 4-area, 6-out-of-7-day coupon booklet 
substantially identical to the ""Ski the Summit"" booklet 
accepted by Ski Co. at its Breckenridge resort in Summit 
County, Colorado.  See n. 30, infra. See also supra, at 589.  
The injunction was initially for a 3-year period, but was later 
extended through the 1984-1985 season by stipulation of the 
parties.  Highlands represents that ""it will not seek an 
extension of the injunction."" Brief for Respondent 1, n. 1.  No 
question is raised concerning the character of the injunctive 
relief ordered by the District Court."

11,25," See Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 
370 U.S. 690, 699 (1962); Associated Press v. United States, 
326 U.S. 1, 14 (1945)."
11,26," Highlands also contends that Ski Co.'s present contentions 
were not properly raised in the District Court.  In that court, Ski 
Co. primarily questioned whether the evidence supported a 
finding that it possessed monopoly power in a properly defined 
market.  In this Court, on the other hand, Ski Co.'s entire 
argument relates to the question whether it misused that 
power.  Nevertheless, we agree with the Court of Appeals' 
conclusion, 738 F.2d, at 1517-1518, that Ski Co.'s motion for a 
directed verdict did raise the question whether the judgment 
improperly rested on an assumption that § 2 required a 
monopolist to cooperate with its rivals."
12,28," ""In order to fall within § 2, the monopolist must have both the 
power to monopolize, and the intent to monopolize. To read 
the passage as demanding any 'specific,' intent, makes 
nonsense of it, for no monopolist monopolizes unconscious of 
what he is doing.  So here, 'Alcoa' meant to keep, and did 
keep, that complete and exclusive hold upon the ingot market 
with which it started.  That was to 'monopolize' that market, 
however innocently it otherwise proceeded."" United States v. 
Aluminum Co. of America, 148 F.2d, at 432."

it likes, as long as it does so independently."" Monsanto Co. v.

"
13,29," R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 160 (1978) (hereinafter 
Bork)."
13,30," Ski Co. itself participates in interchangeable ticket programs 
in at least two other markets.  For example, since 1970, Ski 
Co. has operated the Breckenridge resort in Summit County, 
Colorado.  Breckenridge participates in the ""Ski the Summit"" 4-
area interchangeable coupon booklet which allows the skier to 
ski at any of the four mountains in the region: Breckenridge, 
Copper Mountain, Keystone, and Arapahoe Basin.  Tr. 188, 
590, 966, 1070-1081.  In the 1979-1980 season Keystone and 
Arapahoe Basin -- which are jointly operated -- had about 40% 
of the Summit County market, and the other two ski mountains 
each had a market share of about 30%.  Id., at 1100.  During 
the relevant period of time, Ski Co. also operated Blackcomb 
Mountain, northeast of Vancouver, British Columbia, which 
has an interchangeable ticket arrangement with nearby 
Whistler Mountain, an independently operated facility.  Id., at 
369, 873-874.  Interchangeable lift tickets apparently are also 
available in some European skiing areas.  See n. 7, supra; Tr. 
720."
13,31," ""In any business, patterns of distribution develop over time;"
13,," these may reasonably be thought to be more efficient than 
alternative patterns of distribution that do not develop.  The 
patterns that do develop and persist we may call the optimal 
patterns.  By disturbing optimal distribution patterns one rival 
can impose costs upon another, that is, force the other to 
accept higher costs."" Bork 156.
 In § 1 cases where this Court has applied the per se approach 
to invalidity to concerted refusals to deal, ""the boycott often cut 
off access to a supply, facility or market necessary to enable 
the boycotted firm to compete, . . . and frequently the 
boycotting firms possessed a dominant position in the relevant 
market."" Northwest Wholesale Stationers, Inc. v. Pacific 
Stationery & Printing Co., ante, at 294.
"
13,32," ""Thus, HN6[
] 'exclusionary' comprehends at the most 
behavior that not only (1) tends to impair the opportunities of 
rivals, but also (2) either does not further competition on the 
merits or does so in an unnecessarily restrictive way."" 3 P."
14,35," ""Our philosophy is that . . . to offer [Aspen] as a premier ski 
resort, our clients should be offered all of the terrain.  
Therefore, we would never consciously consider offering a 
three-mountain ticket if there were a four-mountain ticket 
available."" Id., at 1026."
14,36," Id., at 356, 492, 572, 679, 1001-1002.  For example, the 
marketing director of Highlands' ski school reported that one 
frustrated consumer was a dentist from ""the Des Moines area 
[who] came out with two of his children, and he had been told 
by our base lift operator that he could not board.  He became 
somewhat irate and she had referred him to my office, which is 
right there on the ski slopes. He came into my office and 
started out, 'Well, I want to go skiing here, and I don't 
understand why I can't.' When we got the situation slowed 
down and explained that there were two different tickets, well, 
what came out is irritation occurred because he had intended 
when he came to Aspen to be able to ski all areas . . . ."" Id., at 
356."
14,37," The refund policy was cumbersome, and poorly publicized.  
Id., at 994, 1044, 1053."
14,," Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law 78 (1978).
"
14,33, Bork 138.
14,34," Highlands' expert marketing witness testified that visitors to 
the Aspen resort ""are looking for a variety of skiing 
experiences, partly because they are going to be there for a 
week and they are going to get bored if they ski in one area for 
very long; and also they come with people of varying skills.  
They need some variety of slopes so that if they want to go out 
and ski the difficult areas, their spouses or their buddies who 
are just starting out skiing can go on the bunny hill or the not-
so-difficult slopes."" Tr. 765.  The owner of a condominium 
management company added: ""The guest is coming for a first-
class destination ski experience, and part of that, I think, is the 
expectation of perhaps having available to him the ability to ski 
all of what is there; i. e., four mountains vs. three mountains. It 
helps enhance the quality of the vacation experience."" Id., at 
720. See also id., at 685."
15,39," ""The law can usefully attack this form of predation only when 
there is evidence of specific intent to drive others from the 
market by means other than superior efficiency and when the 
predator has overwhelming market size, perhaps 80 or 90 
percent.  Proof of specific intent to engage in predation may 
be in the form of statements made by the officers or agents of 
the company, evidence that 
the conduct was 
used 
threateningly and did not continue when a rival capitulated, or 
evidence that the conduct was not related to any apparent 
efficiency.  These matters are not so difficult of proof as to 
render the test overly hard to meet."" Bork 157 (emphasis 
added)."
15,40," Under the Ski Co. system, each skier's ticket, whether a 
daily or weekly ticket, is punched before he goes out on the 
slopes for the day.  Revenues are distributed between the 
mountains on the basis of this count.  Tr. 650-651.  Ski Co.'s 
vice president for finance testified that Ski Co. ""would never 
consider"" a system like that for monitoring usage on a 4-area 
ticket: ""it's fine to approximate within your own company."" Id., 
at 599.  The United States Forest Service, however, required 
the submission of financial information on a mountain-by-
mountain basis as a condition of the permits issued for each 
mountain. Id., at 643, 945.  A lift operator at Ajax conceded 
that the survey count during the years of the 4-area ticket was 
""generally pretty close"" to the count made by Ski Co.'s staff.  
Id., at 1627."
15,38," In considering the competitive effect of Ski Co.'s refusal to 
deal or cooperate with Highlands, it is not irrelevant to note 
that similar conduct carried out by the concerted action of 
three independent rivals with a similar share of the market 
would constitute a per se violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act. 
See Northwest Wholesale Stationers, Inc. v. Pacific Stationery 
& Printing Co., ante, at 294.  Cf. Lorain Journal Co. v. United 
States, 342 U.S. 143, 154 (1951)."
16,41," Lorain Journal Co. v. United States, 342 U.S., at 149 
(quoting opinion below, 92 F.Supp. 794, 796 (ND Ohio 1950))."
16,42," ""[Why] didn't they buy an individual daily lift ticket at Aspen 
Highlands? . . .  For those who had bought six-day tickets, I 
think despite the fact that they are all relatively affluent -- a lot 
of them are relatively affluent when they go to Aspen -- they 
are all sort of managerial types and they seem to be pretty 
cautious.  Certainly the comments that I have had from 
individual skiers and from the tour operators, club people that I 
have talked to -- they are pretty careful with their money and 
they would feel -- these are the people who will buy the six-
day, three-area ticket that giving up one of those days and 
going over to ski at Aspen Highlands would mean spending 
extra money."" Tr. 777."
16,43," The Ski Co. advertising that conveyed the impression that 
there were only three skiing mountains in Aspen, supra, at"
16,593," , and n. 12, is consistent with this conclusion, even though 
this evidence would not be sufficient in itself to sustain the 
judgment."
16,44," Given our conclusion that the evidence amply supports the 
verdict under the instructions as given by the trial court, we 
find it unnecessary to consider the possible relevance of the 
""essential facilities"" doctrine, or the somewhat hypothetical 
question whether nonexclusionary conduct could ever 
constitute an abuse of monopoly power if motivated by an 
anticompetitive purpose.  If, as we have assumed, no 
monopolist monopolizes unconscious of what he is doing, that 
case is unlikely to arise."
