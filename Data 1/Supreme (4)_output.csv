9,9," At CBS's suggestion, the Court of Appeals held that the 
challenged conduct constituted misuse of copyrights solely on 
the basis of its finding of unlawful price fixing. Id., at 141 n. 29."
9,10," The Court of Appeals went on to suggest some guidelines 
as to remedy, indicating that despite its conclusion on liability 
the blanket license was not totally forbidden.  The Court of 
Appeals said: ""Normally, after a finding of price-fixing, the remedy is an 
injunction against the price-fixing -- in this case, the blanket 
license. We think, however, that if on remand a remedy can be 
fashioned which will ensure that the blanket license will not 
affect the price or negotiations for direct licenses, the blanket 
license need not be prohibited in all circumstances.  The 
blanket license is not simply a 'naked restraint' ineluctably 
doomed to extinction.  There is not enough evidence in the 
present record to compel a finding that the blanket license 
does not serve a market need for those who wish full 
protection against infringement suits or who, for some other 
business reason, deem the blanket license desirable.  The 
blanket license includes a practical covenant not to sue for 
infringement of any ASCAP copyright as well as an 
indemnification against suits by others.
 ""Our objection to the blanket license is that it reduces price 
competition among the members and provides a disinclination 
to compete.  We think that these objections may be removed if 
ASCAP itself is required to provide some form of per use 
licensing which will ensure competition among the individual 
members with respect to those networks which wish to engage 
in per use licensing."" Id., at 140 (footnotes omitted).

represents the most convenient method of fixing the business 
value of the privileges granted by the licensing agreement. . . .

12,22," National Broadcasting Co. did, in 1971, request an annual 
blanket license for 2,217 specific ASCAP compositions most 
frequently used on its variety shows.  It intended to acquire the 
remaining rights to background and theme music through 
direct transactions by it and its program packagers.  See 
United States v. ASCAP (Application of National Broadcasting 
Co.), supra."
12,23," 1950-1951 Trade Cases para. 62,595, p. 63,756."
12,24," Cf. Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S., at 
50 n. 16. Moreover, unthinking application of the per se rule 
might upset the balancing of economic power and of 
procompetitive and anticompetitive effects presumably worked 
out in the decree."
13,25," See cases cited n. 18, supra.  Those cases involved 
licenses sold to individual movie theaters to ""perform"" 
compositions already on the motion pictures' soundtracks.  
ASCAP had barred its members from assigning performing 
rights to movie producers at the same time recording rights 
were licensed, and the theaters were effectively unable to 
engage in direct transactions for performing rights with 
individual copyright owners."
14,26," Certain individual television and radio stations, appearing 
here as amici curiae, argue that the per se rule should extend 
to ASCAP's blanket licenses with them as well.  The television 
stations have filed an antitrust suit to that effect.  Buffalo 
Broadcasting Co. v. ASCAP, 78 Civ. 5670 (SDNY, filed Nov. 
27, 1978)."
14,27," See n. 10, supra.  The Court of Appeals would apparently 
not outlaw the blanket license across the board but would 
permit it in various circumstances where it is deemed 
necessary or sufficiently desirable.  It did not even enjoin 
blanket licensing with the television networks, the relief it 
realized would normally follow a finding of per se illegality of 
the license in that context.  Instead, as requested by CBS, it 
remanded to the District Court to require ASCAP to offer in 
addition to blanket licensing some competitive form of per-use 
licensing. But per-use licensing by ASCAP, as recognized in 
the consent decrees, might be even more susceptible to the 
per se rule than blanket licensing. The rationale for this unusual relief in a per se case was that 
""[the] blanket license is not simply a 'naked restraint' 
ineluctably doomed to extinction."" 562 F.2d, at 140. To the 
contrary, the Court of Appeals found that the blanket license 
might well ""serve a market need"" for some.  Ibid.  This, it 
seems to us, is not the per se approach, which does not yield 
so readily to circumstances, but in effect is a rather bobtailed 
application of the rule of reason, bobtailed in the sense that it 
is unaccompanied by the necessary analysis demonstrating 
why the particular licensing system is an undue competitive 
restraint.
"
14,28," Surely, if ASCAP abandoned the issuance of all licenses 
and confined its activities to policing the market and suing 
infringers, it could hardly be said that member copyright 
owners would be in violation of the antitrust laws by not having 
a common agent issue per-use licenses. Under the copyright 
laws, those who publicly perform copyrighted music have the 
burden of obtaining prior consent.  Cf. Zenith Radio Corp. v. 
Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U.S., at 139-140."
14,29," In its complaint, CBS alleged that it would be ""wholly 
impracticable"" for it to obtain individual licenses directly from 
the composers and publishing houses, but it now says that it 
would be willing to do exactly that if ASCAP were enjoined 
from granting blanket licenses to CBS or its competitors in the 
network television business."

14,31," See Koenigsberg, The 1976 Copyright Act: Advances for the 
Creator, 26 Cleve. St. L. Rev. 515, 524, 528 (1977)."
15,32," Cf.  Silver v. New York Stock Exchange, 373 U.S. 341 
(1963). Because a musical composition can be ""consumed"" by many 
different people at the same time and without the creator's 
knowledge, the ""owner"" has no real way to demand 
reimbursement for the use of his property except through the 
copyright laws and an effective way to enforce those legal 
rights.  See Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken, 422 U.S. 
151, 162 (1975). It takes an organization of rather large size to 
monitor most or all uses and to deal with users on behalf of 
the composers. Moreover, it is inefficient to have too many 
such organizations duplicating each other's monitoring of use.
"
15,33," The scrutiny occasionally required must not merely subsume 
the burdensome analysis required under the rule of reason, 
see National Society of Professional Engineers v. United 
States, 435 U.S. 679, 690-692 (1978), or else we should apply 
the rule of reason from the start.  That is why the per se rule is 
not employed until after considerable experience with the type 
of challenged restraint."

new marketing techniques might also undercut the justification 
for the practice."

Final Judgment of 1950, 23 Bull. Copyright Soc. 119, 149 
(1975) (""no performing rights are licensed on other than a 
blanket basis in any nation in the world"")."
16,40," Moreover, because of the nature of the product -- a 
composition can be simultaneously ""consumed"" by many 
users -- composers have numerous markets and numerous 
incentives to produce, so the blanket license is unlikely to 
cause decreased output, one of the normal undesirable effects 
of a cartel.  And since popular songs get an increased share of 
ASCAP's revenue distributions, composers compete even 
within the blanket license in terms of productivity and 
consumer satisfaction."

217 (distinguishing Chicago Bd. of Trade v. United States, 246

challenged rule there ""was the creation of a public market"");

(distinguishing Chicago Bd. of Trade on the ground that it did 
not involve ""a price agreement among competitors in an open

16,35," The District Court found that CBS would require between 
4,000 and 8,000 individual license transactions per year.  400 
F.Supp., at 762."
16,36," To operate its system for distributing the license revenues to 
its members, ASCAP relies primarily on the networks' records 
of which compositions are used."
16,37," See Timberg, The Antitrust Aspects of Merchandising 
Modern Music: The ASCAP Consent Judgment of 1950, 19 
Law & Contemp. Prob. 294, 297 (1954) (""The disk-jockey's 
itchy fingers and the bandleader's restive baton, it is said, 
cannot wait for contracts to be drawn with ASCAP's individual 
publisher members, much less for the formal acquiescence of 
a 
characteristically 
unavailable 
composer 
or 
author"").  
Significantly, 
ASCAP 
deals 
only 
with 
nondramatic 
performance rights.  Because of their nature, dramatic rights, 
such as for musicals, can be negotiated individually and well in 
advance of the time of performance.  The same is true of 
various other rights, such as sheet music, recording, and 
synchronization, which are licensed on an individual basis."
16,38," Cf.  United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 572-573 
(1966); United States v. Philadelphia Nat. Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 
356-357 (1963)."
17,43," It is argued that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should 
nevertheless be affirmed on the ground that the blanket 
license is a tying arrangement in violation of § 1 of the 
Sherman Act or on the ground that ASCAP and BMI have 
monopolized the relevant market contrary to § 2.  The District 
Court and the Court of Appeals rejected both submissions, 
and we do not disturb the latter's judgment in these respects, 
particularly since CBS did not file its own petition for certiorari 
challenging the Court of Appeals' failure to sustain its tying 
and monopolization claims."
17,44," The Court of Appeals did not address the rule-of-reason 
issue, and BMI insists that CBS did not preserve the question 
in that court.  In any event, if the issue is open in the Court of 
Appeals, we prefer that that court first address the matter.  
Because of the United States' interest in the enforcement of 
the consent decree, we assume it will continue to play a role in 
this litigation on remand."
17,42," ""CBS does not claim that the individual members and 
affiliates ('sellers') of ASCAP and BMI have agreed among 
themselves as to the prices to be charged for the particular 
'products' (compositions) offered by each of them."" 400 
F.Supp., at 748."
18,5," 400 F.Supp. 737, 753 (SDNY 1975)."
18,6," ASCAP responded in a letter from its general counsel, stating 
that it would consider the request at its next board of directors 
meeting, and that it regarded it as an application for a license 
consistent with the decree. The letter from BMI's president 
stated: ""The BMI Consent Decree provides for several 
alternative licenses and we are ready to explore any of these 
with you."" Id., at 753-754."

v. ASCAP, 1940-1943 Trade Cases para. 56,104, p. 404 
(SDNY).  Analytically, however, there is little difference 
between the two.  A per-program license also covers the entire 
ASCAP repertoire; it is therefore simply a miniblanket license. 
As is true of a long-term blanket license, the fees set are in no 
way dependent on the quantity or quality of the music used.

royalties under a deferred plan which provides additional 
compensation based on length of membership and the 
recognized status of the individual's works.  See United States

22,31," The risks involved in such a venture appear to be 
substantial.  One significant risk, which may be traced directly 
to ASCAP and its members, relates to music ""in the can"" -- 
music which has been performed on shows and movies 
already in the network's inventory, but for which the network 
must still secure performing rights.  The networks accumulate 
substantial inventories of shows ""in the can."" And, as the 
Government has pointed out as amicus curiae: ""If they [the networks and television stations] were to 
discontinue the blanket license, they then would be required to 
obtain performance rights for these already-produced shows.  
This attempt would create an opportunity for the copyright 
owners, as a condition of granting performing rights, to attempt 
to obtain the entire value of the shows 'in the can.' It would 
produce, in other words, a case of bilateral monopoly. 
Because pricing is indeterminate in a bilateral monopoly, 
television networks would not terminate their blanket licenses 
until they had concluded an agreement with every owner of 
copyrighted music 'in the can' to allow future performance for 
an identified price; the networks then would determine whether 
that price was sufficiently low that termination of the blanket 
license would be profitable.  But the prospect of such 
negotiations offers the copyrights owners an ability to misuse 
their rights in a way that ensures the continuation of blanket 
licensing despite a change in market conditions that may 
make other forms of licensing preferable."" Brief for United 
States as Amicus Curiae 24-25.
 This analysis is in no sense inconsistent with the findings of 
the District Court.  The District Court did reject CBS's coercion 
argument as to music ""in the can."" But as the Government 
again points out, the District Court's findings were addressed 
essentially to a tie-in claim; ""the court did not consider the 
possibility that the copyright owners' self-interested, non-
coercive demands for compensation might nevertheless make 
the cost of CBS' dropping the blanket license sufficiently high 
that ASCAP and BMI could take this 'termination penalty' into 
account in setting fees for the blanket license."" Id., at 25 n. 23.

22,30," For an individual user, the transaction costs involved in 
direct dealing with individual copyright holders may well be 
prohibitively high, at least in the absence of any broker or 
agency routinely handling such requests.  Moreover, the 
District Court found that writers and publishers support and 
prefer the ASCAP system to direct dealing.  Id., at 767. While 
their apprehension at direct dealing with CBS could be 
overcome, the District Court found, by CBS's market power 
and the importance of television exposure, a similar 
conclusion is far less likely with respect to other users."
