7,1," RCA at that time was the dominant firm with as much as 60% 
to 70% of national television sales in an industry with more 
than 100 manufacturers."
7,2," The number of retailers selling Sylvania products declined 
significantly as a result of the change, but in 1965 there were 
at least two franchised Sylvania retailers in each metropolitan 
center of more than 100,000 population."
7,3," Sylvania imposed no restrictions on the right of the 
franchisee to sell the products of competing manufacturers."
7,*," Briefs of amici curiae urging affirmance were filed by 
Lawrence T. Zimmerman for the Associated Equipment 
Distributors; by Lloyd N. Cutler, James S. Campbell, William T.

Manufacturers Assn.; and by Philip F. Zeidman and John A. 
Dienelt for the International Franchise Assn."
8,4," Sylvania's market share in San Francisco was approximately 
2.5%-half its national and northern California average."
8,5," There are in fact four corporate petitioners: Continental T.V. 
Inc., A & G Sales, Sylpac, Inc., and S. A. M. Industries, Inc. All 
are owned in large part by the same individual, and all 
conducted business under the trade style of ""Continental T. 
V."" We adopt the convention used by the court below of 
referring to petitioners collectively as ""Continental."""
8,6," Sylvania had achieved exceptional results in Sacramento, 
where its market share exceeded 15% in 1965."
8,7," In its findings of fact made in conjunction with Continental's 
plea for injunctive relief, the District Court rejected Sylvania's 
claim that its actions were prompted by independent concerns 
over Continental's credit.  The jury's verdict is ambiguous on 
this point.  In any event, we do not consider it relevant to the 
issue before us."
8,8," Although Sylvania contended in the District Court that its 
policy was unilaterally enforced, it now concedes that its 
location restriction involved understandings or agreements 
with the retailers."
9,9," The jury also found that Maguire had not conspired with 
Sylvania with respect to this violation.  Other claims made by 
Continental were either rejected by the jury or withdrawn by 
Continental.  Most important was the jury's rejection of the 
allegation that the location restriction was part of a larger 
scheme to fix prices.  A pendent claim that Sylvania and 
Maguire had willfully and maliciously caused injury to 
Continental's business in violation of California law also was 
rejected by the jury, and a pendent breach-of-contract claim 
was withdrawn by Continental during the course of the 
proceedings.  The parties eventually stipulated to a judgment 
for Maguire on its claim against Continental."
9,10," There were two major dissenting opinions.  Judge Kilkenny 
argued that the present case is indistinguishable from Schwinn 
and that the jury had been correctly instructed.  Agreeing with 
Judge Kilkenny's interpretation of Schwinn, Judge Browning 
stated that he found the interpretation responsive to and 
justified by the need to protect ""'individual traders from 
unnecessary restrictions upon their freedom of action.'"" 537

11,12," The distinctions drawn by the Court of Appeals and 
endorsed in MR. JUSTICE WHITE's separate opinion have no 
basis in Schwinn. The intrabrand competitive impact of the 
restrictions at issue in Schwinn ranged from complete 
elimination to mere reduction; yet, the Court did not even hint 
at any distinction on this ground.  Similarly, there is no 
suggestion that the per se rule was applied because of 
Schwinn's prominent position in its industry.  That position was 
the same whether the bicycles were sold or consigned, but the 
Court's analysis was quite different.  In light of MR. JUSTICE 
WHITE's emphasis on the ""superior consumer acceptance"" 
enjoyed by the Schwinn brand name, post, at 63, we note that 
the Court rejected precisely that premise in Schwinn. Applying 
the rule of reason to the restrictions imposed in nonsale 
transactions, the Court stressed that there was ""no showing 
that [competitive bicycles were] not in all respects reasonably 
interchangeable as articles of competitive commerce with the 
Schwinn product"" and that it did ""not regard Schwinn's claim of 
product excellence as establishing the contrary."" 388 U.S.., at 
381, and n. 7. Although Schwinn did hint at preferential 
treatment for new entrants and failing firms, the District Court 
below did not even submit Sylvania's claim that it was failing to 
the jury.  Accordingly, MR. JUSTICE WHITE's position 
appears to reflect an extension of Schwinn in this regard.  
Having crossed the ""failing firm"" line, MR. JUSTICE WHITE 
attempts neither to draw a new one nor to explain why one"
12,15," One of the most frequently cited statements of the rule of 
reason is that of Mr. Justice Brandeis in Chicago Bd. of Trade 
v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 238 (1918): ""The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is 
such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes 
competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even 
destroy competition.  To determine that question the court 
must ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the business to 
which the restraint is applied; its condition before and after the 
restraint was imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, 
actual or probable.  The history of the restraint, the evil 
believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular 
remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, are all 
relevant facts.  This is not because a good intention will save 
an otherwise objectionable regulation or the reverse; but 
because knowledge of intent may help the court to interpret 
facts and to predict consequences."" 
"
12,16," HN3[
] Per se rules thus require the Court to make broad 
generalizations about the social utility of particular commercial 
practices.  The probability that anticompetitive consequences 
will result from a practice and the severity of those 
consequences must be balanced against its procompetitive 
consequences.  Cases that do not fit the generalization may 
arise, but a per se rule reflects the judgment that such cases 
are not sufficiently common or important to justify the time and 
expense necessary to identify them.  Once established, per se 
rules tend to provide guidance to the business community and 
to minimize the burdens on litigants and the judicial system of 
the more complex rule-of-reason trials, see Northern Pac. R. 
Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5; United States v. Topco 
Associates, Inc., 405 U.S. 596, 609-610 (1972), but those 
advantages are not sufficient in themselves to justify the 
creation of per se rules.  If it were otherwise, all of antitrust 
law would be reduced to per se rules, thus introducing an 
unintended and undesirable rigidity in the law."
12,14," Indeed, as one commentator has observed, many courts 
""have struggled to distinguish or limit Schwinn in ways that are 
a tribute to judicial ingenuity."" Robinson, supra, n. 13, at 272.  
Thus, the statement in Schwinn that post-sale vertical 
restrictions as to customers or territories are ""unreasonable 
without more,"" 388 U. S., at 379, has been interpreted to allow 
an exception to the per se rule where the manufacturer proves 
""more"" by showing that the restraints will protect consumers 
against injury and the manufacturer against product liability 
claims.  See, e.g., Tripoli Co. v. Wella Corp., 425 F.2d 932, 
936-938 (CA3 1970) (en banc).  Similarly, the statement that 
Schwinn's enforcement of its restrictions had been ""'firm and 
resolute,'"" 388 U. S., at 372, has been relied upon to 
distinguish cases lacking that element.  See, e.g., Janel Sales 
Corp. v. Lanvin Parfums, Inc., 396 F.2d 398, 406 (CA2 1968). 
Other factual distinctions have been drawn to justify upholding 
territorial restrictions that would seem to fall within the scope 
of the Schwinn per se rule. See, e.g., Carter-Wallace, Inc. v. 
United States, 196 Ct. Cl. 35, 44-46, 449 F.2d 1374, 1379-
1380 (1971) (per se rule inapplicable when purchaser can 
avoid restraints by electing to buy product at higher price); 
Colorado Pump & Supply Co. v. Febco, Inc., 472 F.2d 637 
(CA10 1973) (apparent territorial restriction characterized as 
primary responsibility clause).  One Court of Appeals has 
expressly urged us to consider the need in this area for 
greater flexibility.  Adolph Coors Co. v. FTC, 497 F.2d 1178, 
1187 (CA10 1974). The decision in Schwinn and the 
developments in the lower courts have been exhaustively 
surveyed in ABA Antitrust Section, Monograph No. 2, Vertical 
Restrictions Limiting Intrabrand Competition (1977) (ABA 
Monograph No. 2)."
13,17," After White Motor Co., the Courts of Appeals continued to 
evaluate territorial restrictions according to the rule of reason. 
Sandura Co. v. FTC, 339 F.2d 847 (CA6 1964); Snap-On 
Tools Corp. v. FTC, 321 F.2d 825 (CA7 1963). For an 
exposition of the history of the antitrust analysis of vertical 
restrictions before Schwinn, see ABA Monograph No. 2, pp. 6-
8."
13,18," As in Schwinn, we are concerned here only with nonprice 
vertical restrictions.  The per se illegality of price restrictions 
has been established firmly for many years and involves 
significantly different questions of analysis and policy.  As MR. 
JUSTICE WHITE notes, post, at 69-70, some commentators 
have argued that the manufacturer's motivation for imposing 
vertical price restrictions may be the same as for nonprice 
restrictions.  There are, however, significant differences that 
could easily justify different treatment.  In his concurring 
opinion in White Motor Co. v. United States, MR. JUSTICE 
BRENNAN noted that, unlike nonprice restrictions, ""[r]esale 
price maintenance is not only designed to, but almost 
invariably does in fact, reduce price competition not only 
among sellers of the affected product, but quite as much 
between that product and competing brands."" 372 U.S. 268. 
Professor Posner also recognized that ""industrywide resale 
price maintenance might facilitate cartelizing."" Posner, supra, 
n. 13, at 294 (footnote omitted); see R. Posner, Antitrust: 
Cases, Economic Notes and Other Materials 134 (1974); E. 
Gellhorn, Antitrust Law and Economics 252 (1976); Note, 10 
Colum. J. L. & Soc. Prob., supra, n. 13, at 498 n. 12.  
Furthermore, Congress recently has expressed its approval of 
a per se analysis of vertical price restrictions by repealing 
those provisions of the Miller-Tydings and McGuire Acts 
allowing fair trade pricing at the option of the individual States.  
Consumer Goods Pricing Act of 1975, 89 Stat. 801, amending"
13,15," U.S.C.  §§ 1, 45(a).  No similar expression of congressional 
intent exists for nonprice restrictions."
13,19," Interbrand competition is the competition among the 
manufacturers of the same generic product - television sets in 
this case - and is the primary concern of antitrust law.  The 
extreme example of a deficiency of interbrand competition is 
monopoly, where there is only one manufacturer. In contrast, 
intrabrand competition is the competition between the 
distributors - wholesale or retail - of the product of a particular 
manufacturer. The degree of intrabrand competition is wholly independent of 
the 
level 
of 
interbrand 
competition 
confronting 
the 
manufacturer. 
Thus, 
there 
may 
be 
fierce 
intrabrand 
competition among the distributors of a product produced by a 
monopolist and no intrabrand competition among the 
distributors of a product produced by a firm in a highly 
competitive industry.  But when interbrand competition exists, 
as it does among television manufacturers, it provides a 
significant check on the exploitation of intrabrand market 
power because of the ability of consumers to substitute a 
different brand of the same product.
"
13,20," The Court did not specifically refer to intrabrand competition, 
but this meaning is clear from the context."
13,21," The Court also stated that to impose vertical restrictions in 
sale transactions would ""violate the ancient rule against"
14,," restraints on alienation."" 388 U. S., at 380. This isolated 
reference has provoked sharp criticism from virtually all of the 
commentators on the decision, most of whom have regarded 
the Court's apparent reliance on the ""ancient rule"" as both a 
misreading of legal history and a perversion of antitrust 
analysis.  See, e.g., Handler, supra, n. 13, at 1684-1686; 
Posner, supra, n. 13, at 295-296; Robinson, supra, n. 13, at 
270-271; but see Louis, supra, n. 13, at 276 n. 6.  We quite 
agree with MR. JUSTICE STEWART's dissenting comment in 
Schwinn that ""the state of the common law 400 or even 100 
years ago is irrelevant to the issue before us: the effect of the 
antitrust laws upon vertical distributional restraints in the 
American economy today."" 388 U. S., at 392. 
 We are similarly unable to accept Judge Browning's 
interpretation of Schwinn. In his dissent below he argued that 
the decision reflects the view that the Sherman Act was 
intended to prohibit restrictions on the autonomy of 
independent businessmen even though they have no impact 
on ""price, quality, and quantity of goods and services,"" 537 
F.2d, at 1019. This view is certainly not explicit in 
Schwinn,which purports to be based on an examination of the 
""impact [of the restrictions] upon the marketplace."" 388 U. S., 
at 374. Competitive economies have social and political as 
well as economic advantages, see e.g., Northern Pac. R. Co. 
v. United States, 356 U. S., at 4, but an antitrust policy 
divorced from market considerations would lack any objective 
benchmarks.  As Mr. Justice Brandeis reminded us: ""Every 
agreement concerning trade, every regulation of trade, 
restrains.  To bind, to restrain, is of their very essence."" 
Chicago Bd. of Trade v. United States, 246 U.S., at 238. 
Although MR. JUSTICE WHITE's opinion endorses Judge 
Browning's interpretation, post, at 66-68, it purports to 
distinguish Schwinn on grounds inconsistent with that 
interpretation, post, at 71.  
"
14,22," In that regard, the Court specifically stated that a more 
complete 
prohibition 
""might 
severely 
hamper 
smaller 
enterprises resorting to reasonable methods of meeting the 
competition 
of 
giants 
and 
of 
merchandising 
through 
independent dealers."" 388 U. S., at 380. The Court also 
broadly hinted that it would recognize additional exceptions to 
the per se rule for new entrants in an industry and for failing 
firms, both of which were mentioned in White Motor as 
candidates for such exceptions.  388 U.S., at 374. The Court 
might have limited the exceptions to the per se rule to these 
situations, which present the strongest arguments for the 
sacrifice of intrabrand competition for interbrand competition.  
Significantly, it chose instead to create the more extensive 
exception for nonsale transactions which is available to all 
businesses, regardless of their size, financial health, or market"
14,," share. This broader exception demonstrates even more clearly 
the Court's awareness of the ""redeeming virtues"" of vertical 
restrictions.
"
14,23," Marketing efficiency is not the only legitimate reason for a 
manufacturer's desire to exert control over the manner in 
which his products are sold and serviced.  As a result of 
statutory and common-law developments, society increasingly 
demands that manufacturers assume direct responsibility for 
the safety and quality of their products.  For example, at the 
federal level, apart from more specialized requirements, 
manufacturers 
of 
consumer 
products 
have 
safety responsibilities under the Consumer Product Safety Act, 15 
U.S.C.  § 2051 et seq. (1970 ed., Supp. V), and obligations for 
warranties under the Consumer Product Warranties Act, 15 U. 
"
15,," assumption that a large part of the promotional efforts 
resulting from vertical restrictions will not convey socially 
desirable information about product availability, price, quality, 
and services.  Nor is it clear that a per se rule would result in 
anything more than a shift to less efficient methods of 
obtaining the same promotional effects.
"
15,26," We also note that per se rules in this area may work to the 
ultimate detriment of the small businessmen who operate as 
franchisees. To the extent that a per se rule prevents a firm 
from using the franchise system to achieve efficiencies that it 
perceives as important to its successful operation, the rule 
creates an incentive for vertical integration into the distribution 
system, thereby eliminating to that extent the role of 
independent businessmen.  See, e.g., Keck, The Schwinn 
Case, 23 Bus. Law. 669 (1968); Pollock, supra, n. 13, at 608-
610."
15,27," Continental's contention that balancing intrabrand and 
interbrand competitive effects of vertical restrictions is not a 
""proper part of the judicial function,"" Brief for Petitioners 52, is 
refuted by Schwinn itself.  United States v. Topco Associates, 
Inc., 405 U.S., at 608, is not to the contrary, for it involved a 
horizontal restriction among ostensible competitors."
15,," S. C.  § 2301 et seq. (1970 ed., Supp. V).  Similar obligations 
are imposed by state law.  See, e.g., Cal. Civ. Code § 1790 et 
seq. (West 1973).  The legitimacy of these concerns has been 
recognized in cases involving vertical restrictions.  See, e.g., 
Tripoli Co. v. Wella Corp., 425 F.2d 932 (CA3 1970).
"
15,24," ""Generally a manufacturer would prefer the lowest retail 
price possible, once its price to dealers has been set, because 
a lower retail price means increased sales and higher 
manufacturer revenues."" Note, 88 Harv. L. Rev. 636, 641 
(1975). In this context, a manufacturer is likely to view the 
difference between the price at which it sells to its retailers and 
their price to the consumer as its ""cost of distribution,"" which it 
would prefer to minimize.  Posner, supra, n. 13, at 283."
15,25," Professor Comanor argues that the promotional activities 
encouraged 
by 
vertical 
restrictions 
result 
in 
product 
differentiation and, therefore, a decrease in interbrand 
competition.  This argument is flawed by its necessary"
16,28," There may be occasional problems in differentiating vertical 
restrictions 
from 
horizontal 
restrictions 
originating 
in 
agreements among the retailers. There is no doubt that 
restrictions in the latter category would be illegal per se, see, 
e.g., United States v. General Motors Corp., 384 U.S. 127 
(1966); United States v. Topco Associates, Inc., supra, but we 
do not regard the problems of proof as sufficiently great to 
justify a per se rule."
16,29," The location restriction used by Sylvania was neither the 
least nor the most restrictive provision that it could have used.  
See ABA Monograph No. 2, pp. 20-25.  But we agree with the 
implicit judgment in Schwinn that a per se rule based on the 
nature of the restriction is, in general, undesirable.  Although 
distinctions can be drawn among the frequently used 
restrictions, we are inclined to view them as differences of 
degree and form.  See Robinson, supra, n. 13, at 279-280; 
Averill, Sealy, Schwinn and Sherman One: An Analysis and 
Prognosis, 15 N. Y. L. F. 39, 65 (1969). We are unable to 
perceive significant social gain from channeling transactions 
into one form or another.  Finally, we agree with the Court in 
Schwinn that the advantages of vertical restrictions should not 
be limited to the categories of new entrants and failing firms.  
Sylvania was faltering, if not failing, and we think it would be 
unduly artificial to deny it the use of valuable competitive tools."
16,30," The importance of stare decisis is, of course, unquestioned, 
but as Mr. Justice Frankfurter stated in Helvering v. Hallock, 
309 U. S. 106, 119 (1940), ""STARE DECISIS is a principle of 
policy and not a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest 
decision, however recent and questionable, when such 
adherence involves collision with a prior doctrine more"
16,," embracing in its scope, intrinsically sounder, and verified by 
experience.""
"
17,2," Given the Government's emphasis on the inhibiting effect of 
the Schwinn restrictions on discounting activities, the Court 
may well have been referring to this effect when it condemned 
the restrictions as ""obviously destructive of competition."" 388 
U. S., at 379. But the Court was also heavily influenced by its 
concern for the freedom of dealers to control the disposition of 
products they purchased from Schwinn.  See infra, at 66-69.  
In any event, the record in Schwinn illustrates the potentially 
greater threat to intrabrand competition posed by customer as 
opposed to location restrictions."
17,1," The franchised retailers would be prevented from engaging in 
discounting themselves if, under the Colgate doctrine, see 
infra, at 67, the manufacturer could lawfully terminate dealers 
who did not adhere to his suggested retail price."
18,3," Relying on the finding of the District Court, the Government 
argued: ""[T]he declared purpose of the Schwinn franchising system 
[was] to establish and exploit a distinctive identity and superior 
consumer acceptance for the Schwinn brand name as the 
Cadillac of bicycles, thereby enabling the charging of a 
premium price….  This scheme could not possibly succeed, 
and doubtless would long ago have been abandoned, if in the 
consumer's mind other bicycles were just as good as 
Schwinn's."" Brief for United States, O.T. 1966, No. 25, p. 36.  
"
18,4," See, e.g., F. Scherer, Industrial Market Structure and 
Economics Performance 10-11 (1970); P. Samuelson, 
Economics 485-491 (10th ed. 1976)."
18,5," Schwinn's national market share declined to 12.8% in the 10 
years following the institution of its distribution program, at 
which time it ranked second behind a firm with a 22.8% share.  
388 U. S., at 368-369. In the three years following the 
adoption of its locations practice, Sylvania's national market"
19,," share increased to 5%, placing it eighth among manufacturers 
of color television sets.  Ante, at 38-39.  At this time Sylvania's 
shares of the San Francisco, Sacramento, and northern 
California markets were respectively 2.5%, 15%, and 5%.  
Ante, at 39 nn. 4, 6.  The District Court made no findings as to 
Schwinn's share of local bicycle markets.
