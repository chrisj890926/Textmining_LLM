automobile manufacturing company and the Manufacturer 
shall not obtain from any finance company any money or other 
thing of value as a bonus or commission on account of retail 
time sales paper acquired by the finance company from 
dealers of the Manufacturer. The Manufacturer shall not make 
any loan to or purchase the securities of Respondent Finance 
Company or any other finance company, and if it shall pay any 
money to Respondent Finance Company or any other finance 
company with the purpose or effect of inducing or enabling 
such finance company to offer to the dealers of the 
Manufacturer a lower finance charge than it would offer in the 
absence of such payment, it shall offer in writing to make, and 
if such offer is accepted it shall make, payment upon 
substantially similar bases, terms and conditions to every 
other finance company offering such lower finance charge; 
provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph contained 
shall be construed to prohibit the Manufacturer from acquiring 
notes, bonds, commercial paper, or other evidence of

finance company in the open market. ""It is an express condition of this decree that notwithstanding 
the provisions of the preceding paragraph of this paragraph 12

order or decree not subject to further review shall not have 
been entered on or before January 1, 1941, requiring General 
Motors Corporation permanently to divest itself of all 
ownership and control of General Motors Acceptance

nothing in this decree shall preclude the Manufacturer from 
acquiring and retaining ownership of and/or control over or 
interest in any finance company, or from dealing with such

in this decree or in any order of modification or suspension 
thereof entered pursuant to paragraph 12a.  The court, upon 
application of the respondents or any of them, will enter an 
order or decree to that effect at the foot of this decree, and the 
right of any respondent herein to make the application and to 
obtain such order or decree is expressly conceded and 
granted.

 ""(1) If the proceeding now pending in this court against 
General Motors Corporation instituted by the filing of an 
indictment by the Grand Jury on May 27, 1938, No. 1039, or 
any further proceeding initiated by reindictment of General 
Motors Corporation for the same alleged acts, is finally 
terminated in any manner or with any result except by a 
judgment of conviction against General Motors Corporation 
and General Motors Acceptance Corporation therein, then and 
in that event every provision of this decree except those 
contained in this sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph 12a of 
this decree, shall forthwith become inoperative and be 
suspended, until such time as restraints and requirements in 
terms substantially identical with those imposed herein shall 
be imposed upon General Motors Corporation and General 
Motors Acceptance Corporation and their subsidiaries either 
(a) by consent decree, or (b) by final decree of a court of 
competent jurisdiction not subject to further review, or (c) by 
decree of such court which although subject to further review 
continues effective.  The court reserves jurisdiction upon 
application of any party to enter orders at the foot of this 
decree in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph.
 ""(2) A general verdict of guilty returned against General Motors 
Corporation in said proceeding, followed by the entry of 
judgment thereon, shall be deemed to be a determination of 
the illegality of any agreement, act or practice of General 
Motors Corporation which is held by the trial court, in its 
instructions to the jury, to constitute a proper basis for the 
return of a general verdict of guilty.  A special verdict of guilty 
returned against General Motors Corporation in said 
proceeding, followed by the entry of judgment thereon, shall 
be deemed to constitute a determination of the illegality of any 
agreement, act or practice of General Motors Corporation 
which is the subject of such special verdict of guilty.  A plea of 
guilty or nolo contendere by General Motors Corporation, 
followed by the entry of judgment of conviction thereon, shall 
be deemed to be a determination of the illegality of any 
agreement, act or practice which is the subject matter of such 
plea.  The determination, in the manner provided in this 
clause, of the illegality of any agreement, act or practice of 
General Motors Corporation shall (for the purposes of clause 
(3) of this paragraph) be considered as the equivalent of a 
decree restraining the performance by General Motors 
Corporation of such agreement, act or practice, unless or until 
such judgment is reversed, or unless such determination is 
based, in whole or in part, (a) upon the ownership by General

Motors Corporation, or after the entry of a litigated decree, not 
subject to further review, against General Motors Corporation

after the entry of a judgment of conviction against General 
Motors Corporation in the proceeding hereinbefore referred to,

this paragraph 6,
 ""(i) the Manufacturer shall not establish any practice, 
procedure or plan for the retail or wholesale financing of 
automobiles for the purpose of enabling Respondent Finance 
Company or any other finance company or companies to

the Manufacturer pursuant to such practice, procedure or plan 
"
10,3," ""It is not unreasonable for the General Motors Company to 
have a finance company.  It is not unreasonable for the 
General Motors Company to have contracts with its dealers for 
a year or to have a cancellation clause in them.  They have a 
perfect right to have a finance company and to recommend its 
use.  They have a perfect right to cancel a contract from their 
dealer as long as they are not performing any unreasonable 
act. ""They have a right to determine whom they will sell their cars 
to, and they have a right to determine whom they will not sell 
their cars to because cars are their product and they are their 
property and no law compels them to sell them to any man 
they don't want to sell them to; but that is not the charge in this 
case.  The charge is not that by having difficulty in contracts in 
itself, these defendants did anything wrong; it is not charged 
here that to recommend the use of GMAC there is anything 
wrong; it is not charged here that cancellation for cause is 
anything wrongful; but the Government's theory in this case is 
irrespective of these contracts and independent of them and 
outside of them the conditions have been asserted that they, 
under the designation of those to the grand jurors unknown, 
the actions have been such that the possibility, the ability to 
cancel, the ability to refuse to renew a contract, have been 
used as clubs upon the dealers to force them to use GMAC 
and that these acts that are complained of were acts that were 
used to force the dealers to use GMAC, the Government 
insists that these acts inspired by that motive have been such 
as to result in cancellations that otherwise would not have 
occurred; in discriminations that would not otherwise have 
occurred in the shipment of cars in interstate commerce and in 
refusals to renew that would not otherwise have occurred, and 
in the use of GMAC when it otherwise would not have been 
used.
 ""In other words, the Government has no right to complain, and 
it may not complain of the defendants' right to limit its sales of 
cars to persons whom it may select, its right to determine who 
it shall sell to, its rights to determine upon what terms it will 
sell, its right to pick its own dealers.
 ""It can only complain if the defendants do sufficient of these 
acts charged in the indictment as constitute duress upon the 
dealer to accomplish a result that would have otherwise not 
have been accomplished, and to make a dealer do something 
that he would not have done of his own free will.
 ""That, almost, is the question in this case -- whether the dealer 
could act as a free man; whether he could act of his own free 
will.
 ""The defendants say:
 ""'We never imposed any restrictions upon that freedom of 
action.'
 ""The Government says it did and there is that question.  If it

 ""(d) Shall not, except upon written request of the dealer or 
prospective dealer, arrange or agree with the Manufacturer 
that an agent of the Manufacturer and an agent of Respondent 
Finance Company shall together be present with any dealer or 
prospective dealer for the purpose of influencing the dealer or 
prospective 
dealer 
to 
patronize 
Respondent 
Finance 
Company; provided, however, that it shall not be a violation of 
this decree for Respondent Finance Company by joint 
conference with a dealer or prospective dealer and a 
representative of the Manufacturer to agree to furnish to such 
dealer or prospective dealer, because of his financial situation 
or requirements, special facilities or services (such term not 
including only the financing of the shipment or delivery of 
automobiles to such dealer or prospective dealer and/or only 
the purchase or acquisition of retail time sales paper from him 
in the regular course of business) and in part consideration of 
such special facilities or services to arrange for the dealer or

11,," did -- if the defendants did that sort of thing -- and if it resulted 
in an unreasonable restriction and unreasonable restraint of 
interstate commerce, then you would have a right to find them 
guilty.
 ""If they did not do it, this lawsuit is at an end, and that is a 
question which you have got to decide.
 ""You know, you have heard of the terms:
 ""Exposition;
 ""Persuasion;
 ""Argument;
 ""Coercion.
 ""They are different steps.  They are graduated steps that I 
suppose every salesman goes through, except perhaps the 
last.
 ""In Exposition one may expound the merits of that which he 
has to sell; he may explain its nature and by his exposition 
make a clear picture of what he has.
 ""By persuasion he may endeavor to persuade the person to 
whom he is talking to accept that which he has to offer.
 ""There is little advancement in his further progress, to argue.
 ""Persuasion means something softer than argument, perhaps, 
but he may argue with him, and argue with him the respective 
merits of his product and other products being offered to the 
person to whom he makes his offer.
 ""All of these are proper.
 ""He may not go beyond that and use something that is within 
his power to use as a club to coerce the person to accept that 
which he has to offer.
 . . . .
 ""You must remember that, after all, this coercion, if you find 
that coercion exists, then the ultimate question is; Has that 
resulted in unreasonable restraint of interstate commerce?  
And that is a question for you to determine from all of the 
evidence.""
