22,1," The ""Flying J Plaintiffs"" include Flying J, Inc., TCH LLC, Transportation Alliance Bank, Inc., and TON Services, Inc."
22,2," Earlier  [*3] in the case, the Flying J Plaintiffs agreed to dismiss all claims against Defendants TA Operating Corporation and 
TravelCenters of America LLC. The order granting their joint motion for dismissal was entered on May 5, 2008 (see Dkt # 335). 
Accordingly, the Defendants now consist of the Pilot Defendants (Pilot Travel Centers LLC and Pilot Corporation) and Comdata."
22,3," Comdata moves to strike under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f), which allows the court to ""strike from a pleading an 
insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter."""
22,4," The Pilot Defendants did file a Reply, but it is, at least in part, improper because it relies on responses to interrogatories, which 
are not appropriate for consideration on a motion to dismiss. The court disregards those materials outside the pleadings that are 
presented by the Pilot Defendants."
22,5, The first five claims for relief also name the Pilot Defendants.
22,6," Because the First Amended Complaint refers to the Settlement Agreement (indeed both Comdata and Flying J attach it to their 
respective briefs), its contents may be considered part of the allegations the court considers when determining whether to grant "
23,," the 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. See GFF Corp. v. Associated Wholesale Grocers, Inc., 130 F.3d 1381, 1384 (10th Cir. 1997) 
(holding that where a written contract is referred to in a complaint and is central to a breach of contract claim, but is not 
submitted for judicial review, an indisputably  [*6] authentic copy of the contract may be considered on a motion to dismiss 
without converting motion to one for summary judgment)."
23,7," Flying J does not allege violations under each of the other forty-five state antitrust acts. It simply provides the citation to each 
statute. Because the court should apply the law of the forum in which it sits (Utah), Flying J cannot maintain its alternative claims 
under other states' statutes. Indeed, the Plaintiffs say they ""alleged alternative claims under the applicable statute of each state 
that prohibits the unlawful conduct complained of in the FAC as protection in the event that this Court finds that the antitrust law 
of Utah is not the governing state law applicable  [*8] to Defendants' conduct. While Plaintiffs realize that applying the law of 
every one of these states to the claims in this case is not feasible (and Plaintiffs have no intention of attempting to proceed to 
trial under each of these state statutes), asserting alternative state law claims ensures that Plaintiffs will have recourse to state 
antitrust law if this Court were to find that the law of Utah does not apply."" (Pls.' Opp'n at 38.) Accordingly, the court dismisses 
those causes of action that do not arise out of Utah or federal antitrust laws. "
26,8," The Clayton Act provides the private cause of action  [*18] to sue under the Sherman Act and allows for monetary and 
injunctive relief. See 15 U.S.C. ยง 12 (called the Clayton Act, it nevertheless defines ""Antitrust Laws"" to include the Sherman Act); 
ยง 15 (Clayton Act Section 4) (allowing for damages to person injured by antitrust violation); ยง 26 (Clayton Act Section 16) 
(allowing injunctive relief for private parties). "
27,9," ""Truck Fleets"" does not include local truck fleets and local truck drivers whose routes do not require an overnight stay away 
from home. "
28,10," Flying J notes that Comdata's request to dismiss any claim relating to the POS Systems Market is moot because the Plaintiffs 
do not allege harm to competition in that market. "
37,1," In the caption of the notice of appeal and appellate briefs, plaintiff did not include any reference to Corsaw Log & Lumber, Inc., 
or Illinois River Holdings, Inc. Accordingly, we consider Edwards, as the sole appellant. "
43,2," In the petition for reconsideration filed with this court on October 6, 2008, Edwards admits ""this action was brought by Kenin 
Edwards individually and as sole stockholder of his corporate entities."" (Emphasis added) "
50,1," Apple requests that the Court take judicial notice of several documents. For the reasons that follow, this order resolves Apple's 
motion without recourse to those documents. The request is therefore moot. "
51,2," Psystar's tying claim arises under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. It is unclear how Section 1 is applicable, as Psystar alleges 
only single-firm anticompetitive conduct. Apple, however, does not challenge the counterclaim on this basis. In any event, courts 
also allow tying theories under Section 2, at least where there is monopolization or attempted monopolization. "
53,3," Psystar's only other example of a single-brand market is Digidyne Corp. v. Data General Corp., 734 F.2d 1336 (9th Cir. 1984). 
There, Data General manufactured a computer system called NOVA, which included a copyrighted NOVA operating system 
called RDOS. Plaintiffs sued on various antitrust theories, alleging that the RDOS operating system constituted its own relevant 
market. The Ninth Circuit agreed. The decision relied on the per se rule in tying cases and a presumption of market power when 
the tying product is copyrighted or patented. Id. at 1339-41. It also emphasized the presence of market imperfections such 
switching costs and customer ""lock in."" Id. at 1342-43. That decision, however, was implicitly overruled by Illinois Tool Works v. 
Independent Ink, Inc., 547 U.S. 28, 126 S. Ct. 1281, 164 L. Ed. 2d 26 (2006),  [**17] which rejected the per se rule in tying cases 
and the presumption of market power for copyrighted or patented products. Moreover, as explained below, unlike the situation 
addressed in Digidyne, Psystar's pleadings do not suggest market imperfections such as switching costs and customer ""lock in."" "
55,4," Newcal further explained that ""in determining whether the defendant's market power falls in the Queen City Pizza category of 
contractually-created market power or in the Eastman Kodak category of economic market power, the law permits an inquiry into 
whether a consumer's selection of a particular brand in the competitive market is the functional equivalent of a contractual 
commitment, giving that brand an agreed-upon right to monopolize its consumers in an aftermarket. The law permits an inquiry 
into whether consumers entered into such 'contracts' knowing that they were agreeing to such a commitment."" Id. at 1048-49. 
Here, no such functional-equivalent analysis is necessary: not only did customers purchase the alleged primary- and 
aftermarket-products at the same time, as a package, they entered and express agreement that the former could not be used 
beyond the latter. "
57,5," For example, ""[t]he District Court found that consumers would not switch from Windows to Mac OS in response to a substantial 
price increase because of the costs of acquiring the new hardware needed to run Mac OS (an Apple computer and peripherals) 
and compatible software applications, as well as because of the effort involved in learning the new system and transferring files 
to its format."" Id. at 52."
57,6," For example, ""[t]he court also found the Apple system less appealing to consumers because it costs considerably more and 
supports fewer applications."" Ibid. "
65,1," Am. Tobacco, 328 U.S. at 794-96 (setting out market data demonstrating that that Liggett, along with American Tobacco 
Company and R.J. Reynolds, were the ""Big Three"" tobacco manufacturers during the 1930s). "
66,2," Generic ""black and white"" cigarettes were supplemented by other varieties of discount cigarettes, including branded discount 
cigarettes such as R.J. Reynolds's ""Doral,"" and ""Value-25s"" (a 25-cigarette pack sold at the same price of a conventional 20-
cigarette pack). In the late 1980s, Liggett introduced subgeneric (or deep discount) cigarettes priced even lower than discount 
cigarettes. The industry often refers to discount and deep discount cigarettes as ""value for money"" or ""VFM"" products. "
70,3," ""Turner, who had a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard as well as a law degree from Yale, taught for many years at Harvard Law 
School and was head of the Justice Department's antitrust division for several years during the 1960s. He was the nation's 
foremost antitrust scholar from the mid-1950s to the late 1970s and one of the first to make economic analysis the lodestar of his 
approach to antitrust law."" Richard A. Posner, Antitrust Law 55 n.4 (2d. ed. 2001). "
73,4," Our understanding of Plaintiffs' theory of the case does not necessarily require that each subsequent increase have been 
expressly coordinated by the conspirators. Once an agreement to raise prices of discount and premium cigarettes in tandem 
was in place, the decision to implement subsequent increases could be left to traditional price leadership."
73,5," Assume, by way of example, that discount cigarettes sell at retail for $ 1.00 per pack and that premium cigarettes sell for $ 2.00 
per pack. At this point, a pack of discount cigarettes has a two to one price advantage over a pack of premiums. Assume that the 
industry adopts a $ .50 increase in the price of each type of cigarette and that discount cigarettes now sell at retail for $ 1.50 per 
pack and that premium cigarettes sell for $ 2.50 per pack. The absolute price difference between discount and premium 
cigarettes remains $ 1.00, but the proportional price advantage of discount cigarettes has been reduced."
73,6," Because the conspiracy contemplated supracompetitive profits from both premium and generic cigarettes, pre-Marlboro Friday 
profits would be realized even before the prices of premium cigarettes reached pre-Marlboro Friday levels."
73,7," In other words, the competition that occurred in the course of the conspiracy was among products all of which were priced 
supracompetitively as a consequence of the conspiracy. "
75,8," Indeed, at this point it is not entirely clear whether Dr. Leffler's  [****44] opinions are being offered as scientific or as non-
scientific expert opinion evidence. "
86,1," A copy of the relevant filing is attached as Exhibit A to the Memorandum of Law of Defendants MasterCard International 
Incorporated and MasterCard Incorporated in Support of Their Motion to Dismiss Class Plaintiffs' First Supplemental Class 
Action Complaint. "
88,2," The plaintiffs do not object to this conclusion, and I agree with Judge Orenstein's reasoning on this point. "
90,3," MasterCard correctly observes that regulations implementing the Hart-Scott-Rodino amendments to the Clayton Act provide 
that securities are not considered assets of another person when valuing an asset acquisition to determine whether it triggers 
certain notification requirements. MC's Obj. 11 n.8 (citing 16 C.F.R. ยง 801.21(b)). But this regulation also underscores the 
proposition that stock would normally constitute an asset -- the regulation merely serves to identify a specific situation in which 
the conventional meaning of the ""assets"" should not control. "
93,4," In Brunswick Corp., the operators of several bowling centers alleged antitrust  [*37] injury based on the acquisition of rival, 
financially distressed bowling centers by a leading manufacturer of bowling equipment. 429 U.S. at 479-80. Their alleged injury 
was the ""loss of income that would have accrued had the acquired centers gone bankrupt"" and ceased operations. Id. at 487. 
The Supreme Court observed that plaintiffs ""would have suffered the identical 'loss' but no compensable injury had the acquired "
94,," centers instead obtained refinancing or been purchased by 'shallow pocket' parents . . . ."" Id. Because this loss bore ""no 
relationship to the size of either the acquiring company or its competitors,"" the Court held that plaintiffs' injury ""was not of the 
type that the statute was intended to forestall."" Id. at 487-88 (internal quotation marks omitted). In Bayou Bottling, plaintiff Bayou Bottling, which sold Pepsi-Cola products, sought to acquire the franchise rights to distribute Dr. 
Pepper products from Wilcox, a franchisee who was retiring. 725 F.2d at 302. Defendant Dr. Pepper, for unexplained ""business 
reasons,"" urged Wilcox to sell his franchise to a bottler of Coca-Cola products, and he did so. Id. Plaintiff claimed that it suffered 
antitrust injury as a result of  [*38] Dr. Pepper's conduct ""because it was prevented from acquiring Wilcox's franchise, an 
acquisition which would have improved its business position and increased its profits."" Id. at 304. Because plaintiff ""would have 
suffered the identical loss of sales, and economies of scale if Wilcox had retained his operation or if he had sold to a third party,"" 
the Fifth Circuit held that this theory of antitrust injury was ""foreclosed by the holding in Brunswick."" Id."
94,5," However, the issue appears to be an open question in the Second Circuit, and there is dicta from that court, in a case decided 
after my order in Meehan, suggesting  [*40] that an argument may not be waived for appellate review unless a party fails to raise 
it before both the magistrate and the district judge. See Grace v. Rosenstock, 228 F.3d 40, 54 (2d Cir. 2000) (finding waiver only 
after noting that plaintiffs failed to raise issue both before the magistrate judge and in their objections to his report and 
recommendation). "
112,1," See generally United States v. James, 590 F.2d 575 (5th Cir.1979). "
113,2," The court previously concluded that plaintiff had demonstrated the existence of a genuine issue of material fact as to whether 
the Established Distributors entered into a conspiracy, a different question than that which must be decided now. July 27, 2007, 
Order, p. 6. "
114,3," Champagne Metals, 458 F.3d at 1087."
114,4," The Tenth Circuit concluded that ""Champagne's theory makes sense-it is certainly economically rational for a group of 
established firms to attempt to keep an aggressive competitor out of the market, whether they are doing so to protect profits or 
simply to guard market share."" Champagne Metals, 458 F.3d at 1087."
114,5," The Circuit found that the statement by Phil Wiley of AFCO to Matt Zundel of Commonwealth that ""'himself and other potential 
customers โฆ would cause other' service centers to remove their business from Commonwealth if Commonwealth continued 
selling to Champagne,"" viewed in the light most favorable to Champagne Metals, constituted direct evidence of ""an agreement 
among service centers to take collective action."" Champagne Metals, 458 F.3d at 1083-84. However, the court also concluded 
that a reasonable jury could not find defendants had entered into an illegal agreement on the basis of Wiley's statement, alone. 
Id. at 1084. The court recognizes that plaintiff is not entitled, in conjunction with the James hearing, to the same deferential 
summary judgment standard of review, but finds  [*12] nonetheless that the cited statement amounts to direct evidence of 
collusive action."
114,6," As ""the alleged conspiracy is economically rational, โฆ restrictions on the inferences drawn from Champagne's circumstantial 
evidence are not warranted."" Champagne Metals, 458 F.3d at 1085."
114,7," Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 553, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (""'[T]he crucial question' is 
whether the challenged anticompetitive conduct 'stem[s] from independent decision or from an agreement, tacit or express.'"" 
(quoting Theatre Enterprises, Inc. v. Paramount Film Distributing Corp., 346 U.S. 537, 540, 74 S. Ct. 257, 98 L. Ed. 273 (1954))."
114,8," The court finds that, at least with respect to plaintiff, the conspiracy began in 1996 and continued if not to date, close to a 
decade. Commonwealth's participation was brief, limited essentially to the time period surrounding its refusal to honor its initial 
contracts with the plaintiff."
114,9," While the court generally found Mike Champagne and most of plaintiff's other witnesses to be credible, it was not persuaded by 
the testimony of several defense witnesses. For example, the testimony of the Samuel's representative purporting to explain his 
email suggesting that Samuel's president contact the president of Ormet  [*13] was not credible. Similarly, the testimony of 
Debbie Veale, which recounted with complete assurance and certainty what she did not say during a conversation that occurred 
several years previously, appeared rehearsed and less than persuasive. In addition, the testimony of one of the defendant's 
CEO's to the effect that not only had he not discussed whether a mill should sell to Champagne Metals with another service 
center, but that no one in his organization had done so, struck the court as going beyond what any CEO would plausibly know 
about the acts of lower level employees in these large and sometimes far-flung corporations."
114,10," The evidence, though disputed, persuaded the court that Samuel had attempted to buy Champagne Metals for a million 
dollars before the company was even established. This evidences the industry's view of plaintiff's potential impact on the 
marketplace. "
115,11," Mike Champagne had worked in the aluminum industry for approximately 13 years before he started Champagne Metals. 
While employed at EMJ, Champagne had discussions with management about forming a company which essentially would take 
over EMJ's horse trailer business, as it appeared EMJ was not interested in continuing that part of its operations. Champagne 
had proposed buying the equipment needed, a cut-to-length line, from EMJ and been virtually assured EMJ would sell it to him.."
115,12," References to the James hearing transcript will be to ""James Tr., p.    ."" References to the James Hearing Exhibits will be 
""James Exhibit P-   "" (plaintiff's) and ""James Exhibit D-   "" (defendants'). References to exhibits submitted with plaintiff's proffer 
will be to ""Proffer Exhibit"" and to exhibits submitted with defendants' response to the proffer will be to ""Response Exhibit."""
115,13," The distributorships clearly did not operate in a vacuum, but were cognizant of their competitor's activities. E.g., James Exhibit 
P-63 (in an email he sent to Samuel's president, Paul Sutcliffe, a sales vice president for the company, wrote that ""[r]umour has 
it that Mike Champagne contacted Emmett Boyle directly trying to secure a distributorship.""); James Tr., pp. 179-80 (RASCO "
116,," and Ryerson employees were found in plaintiff's buildings); Response Exhibit 11, pp. 67-68. Employees also moved within the 
industry from competitor to competitor."
116,14," Once EMJ was no longer in the horse trailer business, these mills would not, by selling the same metal to Champagne Metals 
that it had sold to EMJ for the same customers, be taking pounds away from another distributorship. Proffer Exhibit 1, P16."
116,15," Despite its desire to reenter the horse trailer business, Kaiser refused to sell extrusions to plaintiff, not wanting to""get in 
between [Champagne Metals] and EMJ."" James Tr., p. 135. Ormet also refused to sell to plaintiff even when it needed the 
business. James Tr., pp. 177-79. See id., p. 137 (Ormet called on Mike Champagne monthly  [*19] when he worked at EMJ, 
trying to sell it metal)."
116,16," See James P-Exhibit 1, ALC 0020, (In a memo summarizing a visit to Champagne Metals in June, 2000, John Guest wrote 
that the company ""ha[s] an excellent reputation for the processing of aluminum coil."")."
116,17," In this email from Keith Forniss, an Ormet salesman to Harry Sneigle, Ormet's sales manager, Forniss states that Ormet ""must 
thoroughly assess the long-term ramifications against anticipated  [*21] or projected dividend of recognizing this account. 
Brenda [Mcinnis], Regional VP of Purchasing [of Samuels] has been quite candid and clear in expressing concerns with Ormet 
selling this account. In past as well as during recent conversations that included Mr. Champagne she was most emphatic that 
our selling this account would be looked at negatively by the Samuels โฆ. In no way am I suggesting that we allow Samuels 
Specialty or anyone dictate our marketing efforts, however I am only suggesting we weigh the significant tonnage generated by 
the Texas facilities and Ms. McInnis consistent support of Ormet against expectations of significant business from this account."" 
James Exhibit P-50. See generally James Exhibit P-27(When asked if increasing the pounds purchased from one-half to one 
million would persuade Ormet to sell to Champagne Metals, Sneigle responded: ""10 million pounds wouldn't help."")."
116,18," The higher prices paid by plaintiff were due, in part, to cost reductions and rebates ""Tier 3"" distributors received because of the 
volume of their purchases. James Tr., pp. 674-77. "
117,19," Matthew Zundel testified that the reference to ""others in that geographic region"" was generally understood to be ""the Rascos 
and the Vincent Metal Goods, and the Ryersons, and the other people in that general geographic region."" James Tr., pp. 991-
92."
117,20," Zundel assumed, based on his conversation with Phil Wiley and other customers within that geographic region, that, while the 
distributors were not in direct communication with each other, that the ""others understood โฆ how the game is played โฆ that 
there are โฆ written and, quote, unwritten  [*23] rules of how you should be going to market, and who you should be selling as a 
mill supplier to distribution โฆ [and that Commonwealth] would be punished by the industry as a result of doing business with 
Champagne at that time."" James Tr., pp., 992-93. For obvious reasons, particularly when dealing with sophisticated 
businessmen or women acquainted with the antitrust laws, the proof in an anti-trust case usually is circumstantial. See James P-
Exhibit 28, CM 19412 (Commonwealth employees were trained on antitrust)."
117,21," Plaintiff established that defendants believed Champagne Metals had disrupted the marketplace, see e.g. James Tr., pp. 793, 
795 and had or would negatively affect prices. See id. at pp. 793; 990-91; 1019."
117,22," Garry Pierce, a Commonwealth sales representative testified that, while other service centers might be upset for a month or 
two when Commonwealth (or its predecessor) recognized a new distributor, the negative reactions to Commonwealth's 
recognition of Champagne Metals five years out were unique. James Tr., pp. 796-97. An obvious distinction for the lingering 
anger with respect to Champagne Metals was it was a new, versus an already existing, competitor/service center."
117,23," See Standard Roofing, 156 F.3d at 469(""Evidence that plaintiff's competitors/defendants] had actively considered  [*25] fixing 
prices and allocating customers"" prior to alleged conspiracy ""to boycott and exclude [the plaintiff] from the market"" was 
""sufficient to permit the inference that [the competitors] may have had a long-standing intent to stabilize prices in the roofing 
distribution business."")"
117,24," The comments of John Guest, an Alcoa manager, that ""[r]elative to market coverage, [Champagne Metals] do[es] compete 
with Ryerson, Rasco, VMG and we risk losing more than we would gain"" and that Champagne Metals ""would be a location to 
recognize, if one of our existing distributors acquired them,"" James Exhibit P-1, evidence the mills' recognition of the distributors' 
desire to retain their market share."
117,25," Evaluation of the testimony in this case is complicated by the fact that virtually every witness is potentially affected by self-
interest. A current employee of plaintiff or a service center has an obvious interest in not jeopardizing his or her employment. Mill 
representatives may, due to concern with preserving service center or other client relationships, shade their testimony. "
118,26," In light of the absence of any objection to it by any party, the court assumes, without deciding, the industry practice of 
""incumbency,"" which protects in most circumstances a service center's relationship with a mill as to a particular customer, is 
unobjectionable in and of itself."
118,27," As noted above, Commonwealth initially was a member, but withdrew at some point, as indicated by its conduct relative to 
plaintiff."
118,28," Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., 509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1993)."
118,29," Rule 702 now substantially incorporates the principles set out in Daubert, which interpreted an earlier version of Rule 702."
118,30," Transcript references to testimony at the hearing are identified as ""Daubert Tr., p.    ""."
118,31," Plaintiff has sought leave to submit a post-hearing surreply brief [Doc. # 631]. However, as the court does not view the 
submissions at the hearing as materially changing the issues already joined, the court concludes further briefing is unnecessary. "
119,32," Report of Steve L. Wilsey dated April 22, 2008 (the ""Wilsey Report""), p. 16."
119,33," It may be that there are certain data compilations or other matters to which Mr. Wilsey might properly testify notwithstanding 
this order. However, his opinions as to the amount of lost profits must be excluded."
119,34," His curriculum vitae identifies two cases in this court in which he has performed a damages analysis in connection with 
antitrust or similar claims. Wilsey Report, Appendix 10."
119,35," Mr. Wilsey's c.v. lists a variety  [*33] of businesses which he has dealt with in his business valuation or accounting practice; 
none reference the aluminum or metals industry specifically. Wilsey Report, Appendix 10, p. 1. He does indicate he has 
undertaken substantial efforts to acquaint himself with the aluminum distribution industry for purposes of this case and the court 
is persuaded he has done so. "
120,36," The evidence does not suggest (or at least there is a factual question as to whether) any mill gave plaintiff a ""final"" refusal to 
deal in the sense discussed in Kaw Valley Elec. Coop. Co. Inc. v. Kansas Elec. Power Coop. Inc., 872 F.2d 931 (10th Cir. 1989). "
121,37," As noted in Craftsmen Limousine Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 363 F.3d 761, 771 (8th Cir. 2004): ""Because defendants typically 
cannot be relied on to confess that they have entered into an unlawful agreement, conspiracy cases usually must be proved by 
circumstantial evidence."""
121,38," The evidence indicated that, among other things, Mr. Wilsey interviewed some customers of plaintiff, completed an intensive 
review of plaintiff's financial and other information, and tested the accuracy of certain of the information given to him by 
comparing it to actual facts as they later became known. Under the circumstances, this was a sufficient effort to verify the 
accuracy of the information provided so as to warrant his using it in forming his opinions."
121,39," Wilsey Report, Schedule A-1."
121,40," Wilsey made some offsetting adjustments  [*41] in later years. In years 2004 through 2007, Wilsey reduced the projected 
sales otherwise indicated for those years by adjusting for what he termed ""catch up sales"" in the years when plaintiff had more 
extensive mill access. Wilsey Report, Schedule A-1."
121,41," Wilsey Report, Schedules A (lost profits due to sales) and F (profit margin calculations). "
122,42," Though somewhat unclear from the context, it appears from Mr. Wilsey's testimony that non-aluminum sales constitute the 
bulk of plaintiff's sales. Daubert Tr., p. 70. If that is the case, the inclusion of steel sales in the calculation plainly has a major 
impact on the projections."
122,43," For example, paragraph 58 of the Wilsey Report states, in part: ""I have estimated projected sales for Champagne Metals. The 
projection begins with 10% higher sales in 1998. This estimate is primarily due to the lost customers list, pricing, limited alloy 
breadth, and Commonwealth incumbency. The next year 1999, I project 50% growth (up from Champagne's actual 17% growth 
or approximately $ 7mm in lost sales) based upon Champagne's actual growth, pricing, lost sales, MetalWest's performance, the 
incumbency of Commonwealth, limited alloy breadth, and Champagne's history of success later when having the ability to sell 
from multiple domestic mills."""
122,44," Daubert Tr., pp. 43-44. Mr. Wiley explained how he tested his estimates of annual percentage increases this way (at 44): ""I 
looked at several different sets of data that told me that this is in the ballpark, that my projection is in the ballpark, and it's 
reasonable. I compared it to Champagne's own projections, and we spoke earlier about that, that were made in 1997. I 
compared it to Champagne's later experience, the experience that Champagne had from '04 through '07."" "
123,45," As was suggested at the hearing, a jury would have little or no way to determine whether an estimate by Mr. Wilsey of, say, 
60% growth in a particular year was more or less reliable  [*46] than a competing expert's estimate of, hypothetically, 20% 
explained or justified in the same way."
123,46," HN15[
] The factors referenced in Daubert are non-exclusive and not a checklist, but are helpful to varying degrees in assessing the testimony at issue here."
123,47," If intoning ""professional judgment"" was enough to otherwise justify an opinion in this context, the fact that Mr. Wilsey's 
familiarity  [*47] with the aluminum distribution industry was acquired for purposes of this case and that he lacks prior experience 
with it would be more problematic. However, the 702 standards require more in any event."
123,48," The various authorities recognize at least three common approaches to measuring antitrust damages: (1) the before and after 
approach, (2) a yardstick or benchmark approach, and (3) regression analysis. See generally, Conwood Co. L.P. v. U.S. 
Tobacco Co., 290 F.3d 768, 793 (6th Cir. 2002). Mr. Wilsey's analysis most closely approximates the ""before  [*48] and after"" 
approach."
123,49," The evidence suggests Mr. Wilsey initially used the experience of MetalWest as a basis for comparison, but later concluded it 
was not a useful ""benchmark."" The retreat may have been unwise. Though differences no doubt exist between the Champagne 
and MetalWest experiences, a more systematic comparison to MetalWest might have at least provided an identifiable baseline 
from which adjustments could be made."
123,50," The failure to use or consider other recognized methods of analysis cuts against plaintiff's suggestion that Bigelow requires 
allowing the proffered testimony. Although the wide variety of market factors and other considerations present here make the 
application of any theory or method complex and difficult, there is no apparent reason to assume that application of one or more 
of them would be any more difficult than in other antitrust cases or that any difficulty was specially attributable to the acts of 
defendants. "
124,51," The comparisons involved differences both in the per pound price paid by plaintiff for product and in the ""adders"" for width and

the metal and the like). Its overall service to customers appears to have been exceptional."
124,56," Recognition also gives heightened access to depot stock (product maintained in inventory by the mill and hence more readily 
available  [*52] to the distributor, without the distributor having to bear the capital cost of maintaining the inventory) and to price 
rebates. "

Wilsey Report, Schedule A-1. Thus, even if its purchases were grouped with a single mill (an assumption somewhat inconsistent 
with those underlying the sales projections), Champagne could not have achieved Tier 3 status with any mill until 2004. (It is 
unclear to what extent the inclusion of steel sales in overall sales numbers might impact this comparison.)"
125,60," It is reasonably clear that the entire reference to Mr. Thomas' ""tier"" testimony reflected an after-the-fact scramble by Mr. 
Wilsey to solve a problem (the impact of volume) insufficiently addressed in his  [*56] earlier work. The deposition testimony of 
Mr. Thomas discussing the tier system occurred after Mr. Wilsey prepared his report. Daubert Tr., p. 74. "

differences, you could look at volumes and you could try to account for volume in determining the purchase prices difference 
after adjusting for volume, aren't there? A. Yes. Q. And you did not investigate those methods, did you? A. I felt like it was 
inappropriate, because like I say, there are numerous other factors that affect pricing by a mill, volume is one of them."""
126,63," Daubert Tr., p. 73, referencing Wilsey's 2008 deposition testimony: ""Q. So it's fair to say that with the one exception of 
Metalwest, if we look at every single price comparison in your price damages, as far as you know it might be entirely due to 
volume differences? A. I don't know."""
126,64," While the parties appear to differ as to how quickly Champagne's fortunes changed once it received recognition from 
additional mills, it appears reasonably clear that plaintiff now has mill access to a degree comparable with other service centers. "
129,1," Each Defendant filed its own motion to dismiss, except for Colgate and Henkel who submitted a joint motion. Each Defendant

152,4, Plaintiffs do not identify the number or the names of any of these entities.
152,5," For example, Plaintiffs allege ""Dr. Charles Nemeroff, the presenter for the 2007 CME presentation entitled Add On Atypical 
Antipsychotics Efficacious in Short Term for Unipolar Depression, references the ARISE-RD study, which was an attempt to "

Risperdal improved sexual functioning, when the effects of treatment on sexual functioning were not mentioned in the ARISE-RD 
study. Additionally, Dr. Nemeroff claimed that the study showed Risperdal demonstrates efficacy over placebo, which the 
ARISE-RD study in fact did not. . . . Dr. Nemeroff has been a long time key opinion leader for Defendants and has participated in 
a Janssen-financed journal supplement in 2005."" Id. P 96."
153,6," In Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indemnity Co., 553 U.S. 639, 128 S.Ct. 2131, 2139, 170 L. Ed. 2d 1012 (2008), the Supreme 
Court recently determined that HN1[
] first-party reliance is not an element in civil RICO claims. See Part III.A.2., infra. "
155,7," As the facts alleged apply to both the RICO and NJRICO claims and the RICO and NJRICO statutes are intended to have the 
same reach, the Court addresses these claims together under the RICO analysis."
155,8," In Plaintiffs' causation argument, they also allege that damage models will demonstrate the effect of Defendants' scheme, 
contending that they have pled a cognizable injury and that Defendants were the cause of the injury. Pl. Opp. at 17. In that 
connection, the Court notes that this is not a viable approach. Plaintiffs essentially concede that they cannot identify any 
ascertainable concrete injury, since they assert that Defendants' ""arguments [that Plaintiffs lack a cognizable injury or that they 
were the cause] are especially inappropriate at this early stage of the litigation, when the damage models that Plaintiffs will use "
156,," to demonstrate the effect of Defendants' scheme have yet to be presented, let alone tested."" Pl. Opp. at 17. HN6[
] Some sort 
of damage model, yet to be presented, does not substitute for adequately pleading an injury or causation. See Steamfitters Local 
Union No. 420 Welfare Fund v. Philip Morris, Inc., 171 F.3d 912, 929 (3d Cir. 1999) (rejecting the use of  [*24] ""aggregation and 
statistical modeling"" to satisfy burden of pleading causation). Thus, Plaintiffs' only identified injury is their alleged economic loss 
from ""overpayment."""
156,9," The Maio  [*26] court, in analyzing the plaintiffs' claim that ""they need not plead and prove allegations concerning the level of 
care that they received to establish the fact of damage,"" which was their RICO injury to property theory, determined that the 
plaintiffs did not have standing. Maio, 221 F.3d at 494. It was under this analysis that the court found that insofar as the plaintiffs' 
argument was predicated ""exclusively on the possibility that future events might occur [and that the quality of care administered 
may suffer in some undefined way], rather than on the actual occurrence of those events and their present effect on the value of 
the health insurance"" received, the plaintiffs' theory of present economic loss was too speculative and was insufficient to support 
a cause of action under RICO. Id. at 494-95. Thus, in this case, Plaintiffs plead past and present injury due to the alleged injury 
of overpaying for the ""inferior"" product they purchased. But similarly, here, Plaintiffs do not identify any present injury to their 
insured or beneficiaries. Maio's analysis of injury based on the economic loss of the product allegedly marketed and that an 
inferior product was allegedly received is  [*27] pertinent."
156,10," The Third Circuit noted that if the product ""simply was different  [*28] than that which was promised to appellants, then there 
would be no factual basis for an argument that they overpaid, inasmuch as a 'different' but equally good health insurance 
package would have an equivalent economic value."" Id. at 484 n. 11 (emphasis in original). The court determined that the 
defendants' health insurance ""could not be characterized as 'worth less' in monetary value unless it was inferior in some respect"" 
to the product that had been contracted for. Id. "
158,11," Defendants also note, and this Court agrees, that the Supreme Court, in Bridge, stated that ""none of this is to say that a RICO 
plaintiff who alleges injury 'by reason of' a pattern of mail fraud can prevail without showing that someone relied on the 
defendant's misrepresentations."" 128 S.Ct. at 2144 (internal citations omitted) (emphasis in original). Therefore, as the Supreme 
Court said, it will be unlikely that Plaintiffs will be able ""to establish even but-for causation if no one relied on the 
misrepresentation"" and ""the  [*34] complete absence of reliance may prevent the plaintiff from establishing proximate cause."" Id. 
""Accordingly, it may well be that a RICO plaintiff alleging injury by reason of a pattern of mail fraud must establish at least third-
party reliance in order to prove causation."" Id."
158,12," Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' ""inflated price"" theory of causation is ""a quintessential fraud-on-the-market theory"" of 
causation. Plaintiffs assert they do not allege such a theory. Pl. Opp. 9 n. 3. The Court notes, however, that if indeed that is what 
Plaintiffs are pleading, HN13[
] this theory is not recognized in the RICO context, and thus, not a viable theory here. See, e.g., McLaughlin, 522 F.3d at 228; Sikes v. Teleline, Inc., 281 F.3d 1350, 1362-63 (11th Cir. 2002), abrogated on other grounds,

] ""To set out a prima facie showing of a civil RICO violation under 18 U.S.C. ยง 1964(c), a plaintiff must have been injured by 'racketeering activity,' 18 U.S.C. ยง 1962(c)-(d). 'Racketeering activity' is defined as a violation of certain enumerated 
statutes - commonly known as 'predicate acts' - in 18 U.S.C. ยง 1961(1)."" Breslin v. Brainard, 128 Fed. Appx. 237, 240 (3d Cir.

1961(1) to include a long list of state and federal crimes, among them the wire fraud alleged here.""); see generally 18 U.S.C. ยงยง 
1341, 1343. The Third Circuit permits federal common law or ""garden variety""  [*40] fraud, including mail and wire fraud. Tabas

160,14," Plaintiffs  [*42] also allege bribery as a predicate act. See Part III.A.4, infra. "
162,15," Defendants argue that even if Shearin could be read as permitting a finding that a corporation and its subsidiaries may 
conspire under RICO, it would only be actionable  [*50] if ""the relationship between the parent corporation and its subsidiaries 
were established solely for the purpose of committing fraud."" Def. Reply at 13 (citing Glessner v. Kenny, 952 F.2d 702, 714 (3d 
Cir. 1991), overruled on other grounds by Jaguar Cars, Inc. v. Royal Oaks Motor Car Co., 46 F.3d 258 (3d Cir. 1995)). This, 
however, was not the finding in Glessner or Shearin. First, Shearin did permit a RICO conspiracy where the facts disclosed an 
intra-corporate relationship, nonetheless, Shearin did not address whether a corporation could conspire with its wholly owned 
subsidiaries under ยง 1962(d) to violate ยง 1962(c) of RICO. See 885 F.2d at 1166-67. Second, in Glessner, the Third Circuit 
merely reiterated that RICO conspiracy claims must allege an ""agreement to commit predicate acts and knowledge that the acts 
were part of a pattern of racketeering activity."" 952 F.2d at 714. The court then pointed out that, since the plaintiffs in Shearin 
pled that the relationship between the parent corporation and its subsidiaries was established solely for the purpose of 
committing fraud, the plaintiffs adequately pled the required inference that the defendant companies allegedly agreed to commit 
 [*51] predicate acts and knew that they were part of a pattern of racketeering activity. Glessner, 952 F.2d at 714. Glessner did 
not hold that this fraudulent creation of a subsidiary is a necessary requirement for pleading RICO conspiracy, as Defendants 
appear to assert, but rather Glessner used the Shearin facts to distinguish Shearin from the case before the court and to explain 
why the plaintiffs in Glessner failed to provide a similar reasonable inference of adequately pleading RICO in their complaint. Id."
162,16," In Curley, the District Court stated that Third Circuit's ruling in Shearin on ""intra-corporate conspiracies is more faithful to the 
broad remedial purpose of RICO than a narrow reading which is model[ed] on antitrust law."" Curley, 728 F. Supp. 1123, 1135 
(D.N.J. 1990) (citing Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1984)). 
The Curley court also stated that ""while antitrust law seeks to encourage inter-corporate competition even at a cost to intra-
corporate competition, RICO seeks to eliminate all racketeering activity, both intercorporate and intra-corporate."" Id. (citing 
Continental T.V. Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 97 S. Ct. 2549, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568 (1977))."
162,17," The Eighth Circuit determined where the plaintiffs alleged that the only participants in the conspiracy were the parent 
corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries, the plaintiffs ""fail[ed] to allege a conspiracy, because as a matter of law a parent 
corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries are legally incapable of forming a conspiracy with one another."" Fogie v. Thorn 
Americas, Inc., 190 F.3d 889, 898 (8th Cir. 1999). Applying Copperweld's principle that ""[i]n any conspiracy, two or more entities 
that previously pursued their own interests separately are combining to act as one for their common benefit,"" 467 U.S. at 769, 
the Fogie court found that the identical conclusion was required when it is applied to alleged parent-subsidiary RICO civil 
conspiracies. Fogie, 190 F.3d at 898. In Fogie, the court stated that an alleged conspiracy between a parent and a subsidiary 
lacks this crucial element because these entities ""have a complete unity of interest."" Id. The Eighth Circuit criticized the Seventh 
and Ninth Circuits for failing ""to  [*54] explain why, when two entities are under common control and there is no distinctiveness 
or independence of action, an agreement or understanding between them creates any of the special dangers ยง 1962(d) targets."" 
Id. "
163,18," The Ninth Circuit, relying on the Seventh Circuit's decision in Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Arnett, 875 F.2d 1271 (7th Cir. 1989), 
extended ยง 1962(d) liability to a wholly intra-corporate conspiracy. See Webster v. Omnitrition International, Inc., 79 F.3d 776, 
787 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 865, 117 S. Ct. 174, 136 L. Ed. 2d 115 (1996)."
163,19," The Seventh Circuit distinguished the Supreme Court's holding that a parent corporation could not conspire with its wholly-
owned subsidiary for purposes of ยง 1 of the Sherman Act, as a barrier for relief in RICO claims ""because the Sherman Act is 
premised, as RICO is not, on the 'basic distinction between concerted and independent action.'"" Haroco, Inc. v. American Nat. 
Bank and Trust Co. of Chicago, 747 F.2d 384, 403 n. 22 (7th Cir. 1984) (citing Copperweld, 104 S.Ct. at 2740-44), cert. granted, 
469 U.S. 1157, 105 S. Ct. 902, 83 L. Ed. 2d 917 (1985), aff'd on other grounds, 473 U.S. 606, 105 S. Ct. 3291, 87 L. Ed. 2d 437 
(1985). Further, in Haroco, the court stated that  [*55] ""[t]he policy considerations discussed in Copperweld[] therefore do not 
apply to RICO, which is targeted primarily at the profits from patterns of racketeering activity."" Id. The Seventh Circuit 
determined that the Sherman Act's theoretical ""community of interest"" that causes a parent and subsidiary to pose ""no threat to 
the goals of antitrust law-protecting competition"" differs from RICO conspiracies because ""intracorporate conspiracies do 
threaten RICO's goals of preventing the infiltration of legitimate businesses by racketeers and separating racketeers from their 
profits."" Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Arnett, 875 F.2d 1271, 1281 (7th Cir. 1989) (citing Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 26-28, 
104 S. Ct. 296, 78 L. Ed. 2d 17 (1983)). The Eighth Circuit criticized the Seventh Circuit's findings because its ""recent decisions 
regarding intracorporate liability under ยง 1962(c) . . . appear to undercut the conclusions it reached in Ashland Oil."" Fogie, 190 
F.3d at 897 n. 4 (noting that ""[m]ore recently . . . the Seventh Circuit has indicated that related business entities may not serve 
as both the person and enterprise). "
175,1, The chain of time extensions was based on the parties' dispute as to the validity of Plaintiff's international service of process. 
176,2," As of the date of entry of the Order accompanying this Opinion, Defendants Xiyang Group, Xiyang Import & Export Ltd. Co., 
Xiyang Refractory Materials Ltd. Co., Xiyang Fireproof Material Co. Ltd., Liaoning Foreign Trade General Co., Liaoning Jinding 
Magnesite Group, Dalian Golden Sun Import & Export Co. did not make appearances in this matter."
176,3," In addition, HN3[
] entry of a default judgment is an inappropriate use of judicial discretion where there has been insufficient 
service. See First American Bank, N.A. v. United Equity Corp., 89 F.R.D 81 (D.D.C. 1981); see also Dahl v. Kanawha Inv. 
Holding Co., 161 F.R.D. 673, 685 (N.D. Iowa 1995) (where it appears that plaintiffs ""have never properly served the defendants, 
 [**9] โฆ neither entry of default nor entry of default judgment would be proper""). Thus, if there is a challenge to the adequacy of "
177,," service, the party who seeks default judgment and, allegedly, served the complaint bears the burden of establishing its validity 
when a challenge to its effectiveness is made."" Adams v. American Bar Association, 400 F. Supp. 219, 222 (E.D. Pa. 1975)."
177,4," HN7[
] Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. Thus, a federal court shall presume lack of jurisdiction, and the party 
seeking to invoke the court's  [**12] jurisdiction bears the burden of proving that subject matter jurisdiction exists. See Kokkonen 
v. Guardian Life Ins. Co., 511 U.S. 375, 377, 114 S. Ct. 1673, 128 L. Ed. 2d 391 (1994). While the court is obligated to test 
subject matter jurisdiction sua sponte, Rule 12(b)(1) also authorizes a party to move to dismiss a claim for lack of subject matter 
jurisdiction. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). A party challenging the court's jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) may do so by raising 
either a facial attack or a factual attack. In contrast, a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) 
tests only the legal sufficiency of a claim. "
178,5," HN9[
] The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit clarified that, ""in the Sherman Act context, jurisdictional facts are often 
closely intertwined with the merits of the claim,"" Carpet Group Int'l v. Oriental Rug Importers Ass'n, 227 F.3d 62, 73 (3d Cir. 
2000) (citing Mortensen v. First Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n, 549 F.2d 884, 892 (3d Cir. 1977)), hence, requiring the party invoking 
the court's jurisdiction to produce sufficient evidential proof. Defining the sufficiency of such proof, the Court of Appeals observed 
that ""it is incumbent upon the trial judge to demand less in the way of jurisdictional proof than would be appropriate at a trial 
stage."" Id. "
180,6," It is unclear, from the face of the Complaint, whether the CMA assumed an ""underground"" name ""China Magnesite Forum"" or it 
was officially so renamed."
180,7," The Court is not entirely clear as to the purpose of this elaboration. While it appears plausible that Plaintiffs included these 
statements in their Complaint to address the issue of statute of limitations (or the common law doctrine of laches), the Complaint 
is silent as to when and how Plaintiffs discovered the alleged conspiracy. See generally, Compl. Similarly, whilst these 
statements might be construed as Plaintiffs' attempt to elaborate on their allegations  [**23] that the CMA's unspecified members 
met during an unspecified number of meetings conducted at unspecified destinations ""in China and elsewhere,"" the excerpt 
quoted above does not provide any specific information as to these alleged meetings. See Compl. P 59. "
181,8," The Strategic Report merely informs the reader that ""[a] combination of primary and secondary research has been used for all 
findings. The usage of obtained information is based on the perceived reliability of the source by the researcher. In many cases, 
a combination of such sources was used."" Strategic Report at I-1"
181,9," The Strategic Report provides conclusions virtually identical  [**26] to those made in the Complaint, PP 37, 45-48: Magnesium Product Producers and Marketing Enterprises established Huaxia Magnesium Products Export Group in China. 
. . . This Group was formed to counter the problems of intense competition and low export prices. . . . Magnesite producing 
companies established [another] magnesite export group, in order to reach unified selling prices. The setting up of this 
group with 13 companies result[ed] in additional revenues of US$ 50 million per annum. . . . The group members agreed 
upon unifying prices and curb underselling practices thus enhancing magnesite revenues by US$ 50 million every year. . . . 
The China Magnesite Export Association was formed in February 2001 from two other groups, which were set up in 2000. . 
. . The primary goals of [this new association was] stabilizing export prices of magnesite. . . . Strategic Report, at 11-106; III-123. And, just as Plaintiffs, the Strategic Report asserts that China is estimated to have 80 
percent of global magnesite reserves, see Strategic Report, at II-109; III-123 (""China is home to about 80% of the global 
magnesite reserves. . . . About 80% of world's total magnesite resources are found in China"").  [**27] However, these 
observations notwithstanding, the very same Strategic Report opens with the following statement: China, the world's leading supplier of magnesite, boasts around 27% of the global magnesite resources. Other leading 
producers of magnesite include Russia, North Korea and Slovakia. Together, these four countries account for nearly 83% 
of the overall global magnesite resources. Strategic Report, at II-5 (emphasis supplied). It appears self-evident that HN12[
] a litigant's claims cannot be based on a 
source containing unverifiable and, in addition, mutually exclusive data. See, e.g., Ohio Midland, Inc. v. Proctor, 2006 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 85888, at *15 (S.D. Ohio Nov. 28, 2006) (plaintiff's allegations cannot be based on mutually exclusive facts); accord 
Twombly, 127 S. Ct. at 1965-69 (the complaint will survive only if it contains enough factual heft rather than conjecture); Kumho "
182,," Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 147, 119 S. Ct. 1167, 143 L. Ed. 2d 238 (1999) (clarifying that judicial gatekeeping 
obligations apply to all technical testimony and providing a checklist of factors the courts should use in assessing the reliability of 
technical evidence)."
182,10," For the purposes of final disposition, either on merits or on procedural grounds, a federal court may take judicial notice of facts 
""capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned."" See Fed. 
R. Evid. 201(b). However, at the instant juncture, the Court finds it premature to discuss whether judicial notice shall  [**31] be 
taken of any Government Survey."
182,11," The Court's discussion does not detail the shifts in production from the cheaper CCM to the more expensive DBM and EFM, 
although these shifts affected the average price per ton."
182,12," It appears self-evident that the data contained in the Government Surveys contradicts many of Plaintiffs' allegations. For 
example, while China accounted for up to 77% of Processed Magnesite exportation into the United States, such importation did 
not reach 650,000 metric tons even by the end of the Relevant Period: rather, it ranged from 493,000 metric tons to 637,000. "
183,," Similarly, while Chinese annual gross profit from Processed Magnesite ranged from US$ 42,550,000 to US$ 90,290,000, the 
prices did not ""increase during 2000 by over 45 percent compared to 1999,"" as Plaintiffs assert: rather, the prices decreased by 
11%, falling from $ 82 per ton in 1999 to $ 68 per ton in 2000. Analogously, contrary to Plaintiffs' assertion that ""[t]he president of 
[one of the alleged original, i.e., smaller cartels] reported that the cartel's efforts . . . generate[d] an additional 50 million U.S. 
dollars [presumably, for the cartel, per annum]"" the Government Surveys indicate that the entire  [**32] Chinese exportation of 
Processed Magnesite over all six years of the Relevant Period grew from US$ 42,550,000 to US$ 90,290,000, that is, less than 
50 million U.S. dollars."
183,13," Turning to the venue of the instant action, Plaintiffs assert that the matter is properly before this Court, because Plaintiffs, that 
is, Animal Science, a Texas corporation, and Resco, a Pennsylvania corporation, are suing seventeen Defendants, one of 
which, that is, Minmetal, is a New Jersey corporation (with the remaining sixteen Defendants being Chinese entities). See 
Compl. PP 5-7.>"
183,14," The ""commerce with foreign nations"" component of the statute is no more self-explanatory than its domestic counterpart. Just 
as the federal courts developed, over the time, a body of federal case law interpreting the Sherman Act for the purposes of 
domestic antitrust  [**35] cases, see State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U.S. 3, 20-21, 118 S. Ct. 275, 139 L. Ed. 2d 199 (1997); Phillip 
E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P 103 (2d ed. 2000) (federal courts have been invested ""with a jurisdiction to 
create and develop an 'antitrust law' in the manner of the common law courts""), the courts also developed common-law-like 
tests for determining when the Act applies to foreign conduct. See Part V(B) of this Opinion for discussion of the ""foreign 
conduct"" antitrust regime. "
186,15," The ""effects test"" has prevailed consistently since Alcoa, and by 1993 the Supreme Court declared that the law  [**44] is ""well 
established by now that the Sherman Act applies to foreign conduct that was meant to produce and did in fact produce some 
substantial effect in the United States."" See Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. California, 509 U.S. 764, 796, 113 S. Ct. 2891, 125 L. Ed. 
2d 612 (1993)."
186,16," Section 6a of the FTAIA provides, in relevant part, that: HN20[
] [The Sherman Act] shall not apply to conduct involving trade or commerce (other than import trade or import 
commerce) with foreign nations unless- (1) such conduct has a direct, substantial and reasonably foreseeable effect- (A) [on domestic, i.e., interstate] trade or commerce, or on import trade or import commerce with foreign nations . . . (2) such effect gives rise to a claim under the provisions of Sections 1 to 7  [**45] of [the Sherman Act]."
186,15," U.S.C. ยง 6a. The Court notes, in passing, that the three-prong inquiry discussed in the instant Opinion reflects solely the 
aspects of FTAIA pertinent to the case at hand: in light of the complexities of FTAIA, the Court finds it prudent to omit from the 
discussion an alternative FTAIA scenario not implicated by the case at bar, i.e., that of effects ""on export trade or . . . commerce 
with foreign nations"" by an entity exporting goods or services from the United States. 15 U.S.C. ยง 6a(1)(A) and (1)(B). "
188,17," HN25[
] The term ""comity"" describes a theory for accommodating conflicting legal policies of territorial sovereigns; it was 
developed by scholars in 17th-century by Dutch scholar Ulrich Huber to resolve conflicts between the laws of the various Dutch 
provinces. See Davies, The Influence of Huber's de Conflictu Legum on English Private International Law, 18 Brit. Y.B. Int'l L. 
49, 52 (1937). Huber summarized his analysis into three now well-known axioms: (1) the laws of every sovereign authority have 
force within the boundaries of its state, and bind all subject to it, but not beyond; (2) those are held to be subject  [**54] to a 
sovereign authority who are found within its boundaries, whether they be there permanently or temporarily; (3) those who 
exercise sovereign authority so act from comity, that the laws of every nation having been applied within its own boundaries 
should retain their effect everywhere so far as they do not prejudice the powers or rights of another state and another state's 
courts. See id. at 26. Thus, the legal doctrine of international comity is not a rule of public international law but a judicial tradition 
based on respect for sovereignty, a discretionary power of the court to decline jurisdiction in international cases out of respect for 
the actions and laws of another nation, which are weighed against United States international convenience and duties. See 
Bodner v. Banque Paribas, 114 F. Supp. 2d 117, 129 (E.D.N.Y. 2000) (citing Societe Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale, 482 
U.S. at 555). "
189,18," Specifically, the plaintiffs named, as defendants, five Malaysian companies, two Indonesian, two Thai, as well as three United 
States wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Malaysian companies and two United States independent distributors used by other 
producers. See Dee-K Enters., 299 F.3d at 283-84. In other words, the scenario examined in Dee-K presented substantially 
more ties to the United States market than  [**60] the case at bar, where the sole connection is the existence of a single United 
States subsidiary of one of sixteen other Defendants. "
190,19," This Court finds the holding of Dee-K Enterprises both insightful and sensitive to the realities of the modern, progressively 
globalized world trade: any holding otherwise risks creating a judicial rule undermining the legislative rationale of the FTAIA. To 
illustrate, if one is to presume that there is a cartel of producers-importers of a certain merchandise which: (a) operates world-
wide, without focusing on the United States market; and (b) sell its merchandise in the United States at the cheapest prices, 
comparing to those charged for comparable merchandise by domestic producers and other importers (as it is the case with 
Chinese Processed Magnesite), a blind application of United States antitrust law to such cartel could, inadvertently, create an 
effect diametrically opposite to the goal of the Sherman Act. Specifically, such blind application of United States antitrust law 
could cause the United States a self-imposed ""quasi-embargo,"" in the sense that the cartel -- after being found in violation of the 
Sherman Act --might elect not to change its  [**61] pricing practices but rather to avoid the reach of the United States law by 
simply selling all its merchandise in non-United States markets. Such self-imposed quasi-embargo would, in turn, create a dire 
shortage of the merchandise in the United States and, hence, an incentive for numerous intermediaries to profiteer from this 
shortage by re-selling the cartel's merchandise in the United States purchased in foreign markets: this scenario would result in 
higher prices paid by United States consumers -- even if the intermediaries diligently compete against each other within the 
meaning of the Sherman Act -- since the intermediaries would sell the merchandise in the United States at prices necessarily 
exceeding those paid by them to the cartel (simply because the intermediaries would have no business incentive to import the 
merchandise in order to sell it at the price below those that they themselves paid, or at cost). "
191,20," In a centrally planned economy, the state government controls all (or, at least, all major) sectors of the economy and 
formulates all decisions about their use, i.e., the government decides what should be produced, as well as the quantities and 
situs of production, and sets the prices at which the products are to be sold. Planned economies are in contrast to unplanned 
economies, such as a market economy, where production, distribution, pricing, and investment decisions are made by the 
private owners of the factors of production based upon their own and their customers' interests rather than upon furthering some 
overarching governmental macroeconomic plan. See Daniel Myers, Construction Economics 288 (2004); Bertell Ollman, Market 
Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists 12 (Routledge, 1997); Alec Nove, Planned Economy, in The New Palgrave: A 
Dictionary of Economics, vol. 3 at 879 (1987); <<http://www.enotes.com/biz-encyclopedia/centrally-planned-economy>>; 
<<http://dictionary.reference. com/browse/planned%20economy>>. "
192,21," The Court notes, in passing, that Plaintiffs' claims are based on Defendants' activities that started, allegedly, around April of 
2000 and continued, at least, to the date of Plaintiffs' filing of the Complaint, i.e., until September 7, 2005 (""Complained Period""). 
See Compl. PP 45, 62. However, since Chinese privatization processes started in 1978 and, according to Public Perspectives at 
32, kept at least one-third of Chinese industry owned by the State, it is entirely  [**68] plausible that all (or some) of the 
seventeen Defendants were State-owned enterprises at the beginning of the Complained Period but changed their juridical 
status and became non-State-owned entities by the end of the Complained Period and -- in addition -- might have experienced 
intermittent regulatory and non-regulatory sub-periods since they became privately owned."
192,22," Indeed, the Complaint does not assert that Minmetals, an alleged arm of its parent Defendant, operated as an importer of any 
Chinese goods, or as an importer of Chinese Processed Magnesite in particular. See Compl. at 3. "
193,23," For the time being, the Court will not consider Plaintiffs' allegation that Defendants were ""controlling export sale volumes of 
[Processed Magnesite] offered  [**71] for sale . . . in the United States and elsewhere,"" since the export quotas of Processed 
Magnesite were typically established by the Chinese government through a licensing mode, where licences are purchased by 
Chinese entities with respect to the particular goods the entity desires to export. See, e.g., Government Surveys - Citations. 
Therefore, any challenge to the Chinese government's decisions as to exportation quotas clearly implicates provision, judicially-
create doctrine or public policy related to a foreign sovereign's action. Moreover, the fact that China became a member of the 
WTO in 2001 affected Chinese licencing policies, and any allegations as to the illegality of Chinese export quotas qualify as 
claims of China's violations of its WTO obligations: such allegations are not properly before this Court and should be entertained 
pursuant to the WTO dispute resolution mode incorporated into the treaty. That said, Plaintiffs are indeed free to state in an 
amended complaint any allegations against Defendants based on Defendants' agreements to control the volume of Processed 
Magnesite exportation on the bases other than those ensuing from the governmental licensing scheme."
193,24," The Court notes, in passing, that -- while not substituting for Plaintiffs' facts -- Plaintiffs' statements that Defendants' actions 
had a ""substantial and adverse impact"" and that Defendants ""substantially and foreseeabl[y] restrain[ed]"" U.S. commerce appear 
indicative of Plaintiffs' awareness that the case at hand is governed by the FTAIA, since: (a) the ""direct, substantial and 
reasonably foreseeable effect"" test is never implicated by the Sherman Act, see Carpet Group, 227 F.3d at 72 (citing 54 Am. Jur. 
2d ยง 18, at 77); and (b) even the less rigorous analysis of effects that the restraint allegedly had on the competition should be 
wholly inapplicable to Plaintiffs' claim based on the ""violation per se"" theory, see Compl. P 1, since any ""effects"" analysis is 
relevant only to the ""rule of reason"" claims. See Pace Elecs., Inc., 213 F.3d at 123 (if a restraint is per se illegal, further 
examination of the practice's impact on the market is unnecessary). "
194,25," Since, short of this single reference to ""market allocation activity,"" see Compl. P 57, the Complaint is entirely silent as to any 
market allocation actions, the Court will not presume that Plaintiffs' single reference to ""market allocation activity"" was a result of 
a conscious desire to assert allocation of markets."
194,26," At the outset, it shall be noted that HN29[
] activities of a foreign producer fall outside the reach of the Sherman Act since a 
""producer"" is neither an ""importer""  [**77] into the United States nor an entity engaged in ""trade or commerce"" for the purposes 
of the FTAIA (i.e., not an importer into markets other than the United States). See Carpet Group, 227 F.3d at 72. In light of 
Plaintiffs' systemic conflation of the terms ""producer"" and ""importer,"" the Court presumes that Plaintiff intended to assert that 
every Defendant was a producer, as well as an importer, of Processed Magnesite."
194,27," Here, Plaintiffs appear to concede that Chinese imports of Processed Magnesite were the cheapest (or among the cheapest) 
available at the market, be it the United States market or world  [**79] market, and be it in comparison with the products of 
developed or developing nations. See Compl. P 53 (""Chinese producers . . . set a floor below which other producers cannot 
compete). "
195,28," The principle of increased opportunity cost (also known as the principle of diminishing marginal returns) provides that, in a 
production system operating with both fixed and variable factors of production, there invariably comes a point when each 
additional unit of variable input yields less output per each input unit. See Robert S. Pindyck, Daniel L. Rubinfeld, 
Microeconomics 194-97, 218-19 (6th ed. 2005). E.g., a pizza store having an oven capable of baking, at maximum 1,000 pizzas 
per day cannot bake 1,001st pizza even if the owner keeps hiring employees capable of preparing more that 1,000 pies per day: 
all that owner would incur with these new hires is less pizzas per employee, i.e., his profit would decrease because the output 
would remain the same but the overhead would keep increasing. A business entity might invest in fixed asset (also known as 
property, plant and equipment, or ""PPE"") to remedy  [**81] the above scenario e.g., buy an additional pizza oven to allow the 
additional employees produce more pizzas. See, e.g., Charles T. Horngren, et al., Introduction to Financial Accounting 336-49 
(9th ed. 2005). However, since PPE cannot easily be converted into cash (plus, equipment and plant are also subject to 
depreciation), a fixed asset investment might recoup itself only in the long run or, in the event of an unfavorable economic turn 
(e.g., a decline of pizza-consumption) or regulatory change (e.g., an ordinance prohibiting two ovens in one pizzeria as in 
violation of the local fire code), might even result in capital loss. Therefore, in industries where PPE investment is necessarily 
substantial (such as in mining and processing of minerals industries), the considerations related to long-term investment 
recoupment and uncertainties about the legal and economic regime often outweigh the discounted-to-their-current-value 
potential future profits. Here, the Complaint indicates that production of Processed Magnesite requires extensive labor and 
substantial 
investments 
in 
plant 
and 
equipment. 
See 
Compl. 
PP 
38-41; 
see 
also <<http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/magnesium/mgcmyb2001.pdf>>  [**82] (discussing a Chinese-Japanese 
joint venture launched in 2001 aiming to build a plant producing Processed Magnesite in Liaoning Province, China, at the 
construction cost of $ 3.65 million)."
195,29," The discussion of CCM, DRB and EFM production provided in the Complaint suggests production of Processed Magnesite is 
a labor-intensive process. See Compl. PP 38-41. "
196,30," The peg was widely discussed in American academic and periodic literature since, when U.S. dollar was depreciating against 
other major currencies (which was rendering U.S. exports more competitive), the fact that the renminbi was pegged to the dollar 
automatically caused the value of renminbi to go down in foreign markets, hence minimizing the advantage U.S. products were 
gaining in world markets. See Wayne M. Morrison & Marc Labonte, CRS Report for Congress,  [**86] China's Currency Peg: A 
Summary of the Economic Issues, at 4 (2005). Moreover, because of the peg, Chinese goods entered the United States market 
at significantly lower prices than other imports (making Chinese goods attractive to American consumers), while American goods 
were entering China's domestic markets at much higher costs (rendering these goods less attractive to Chinese consumers), 
thus increasing United States trade deficit. See id."
196,31," While Australia was the second leading, that is, volume-wise, United States importer of DBM and EFC during 1999-2003, 
Austria surpassed Australia and became the second leading importer of DBM and EFM in 2004 and 2005. China remained the 
largest importer of CCM, DBM and EFC through the entire Relevant Period. See Government Surveys -- Citations. "
197,32," To illustrate, if tomato growers who previously sold their crop for $ 1.00 to $ 2.00 per pound are faced with a market decline, 
the growers who were selling at $ 2.00 per pound would have to lower their prices in order to compete for the shrunk market (or 
to leave the business if they cannot afford reduction in price), while the growers who were selling at $ 1.00 per pound would still 
be in the position to keep increasing their prices until the decline in demand becomes such that even these growers cannot sell 
their entire crop (at which point, these growers would have to either compete with each other by lowering their sale prices or 
reduce their production). "
198,33," Since the prices on Chinese-produced CCM imported into the United States increased from $ 106 per metric ton in 1999 to $ 
142 per metric ton in 2005 (that is, by 34%), while the prices on Chinese-produced DBM and EFM imported into the United 
States increased from $ 126 in 1999 to $ 212 in 2005 (that is, by 68%), the 25% increase in prices of magnesite in the United 
States animal feed industry does not appear to correspond to the changes in prices charged by importers of Chinese Processed 
Magnesite."
198,34," As noted supra, the amount of Processed Magnesite exported from China to the United States ranged from 11% to 26% of 
Chinese production: 21% in 1999; 26% in 2000; 13% in 2001; 11% in 2002 and 2003; and 12% in 2004 and 2005. See

200,36," Notably, Plaintiffs assert that the alleged meetings of conspirators were ""coordinated,"" presumably, time- and location-wise, 
with legitimate ""trade association meetings for associations in which [D]efendants [were]  [**102] members."" Compl. P 51. 
Plaintiffs' assertion suggests that even if Plaintiffs offered the Court facts indicating the presence of Defendants' representatives 
at locations where the alleged cartel meetings took place during the time of these alleged cartel meetings, these facts would still 
be insufficient to allege Defendants' participation in an illegal conspiracy, since this presence might equally be attributed to 
Defendants' attendance of their legitimate trade association meetings. See Twombly, 127 S. Ct. at at 1966 n.5 (the line ""between 
the factually neutral and the factually suggestive . . . must be crossed""). "
201,37," The content of Plaintiffs' submissions made in opposition to various Defendants' motion or as reply to Defendants' opposition 
to Plaintiffs' motion causes the Court additional concern, since: (a) Defendants' submissions did raise, albeit without extensive 
discussion, the entire panoply of issues detailed or touched upon in the instant Opinion, such as the FTAIA, FSIA, abstention 
doctrines, the degree of precision required by Rule 8 and the particularity of requirement of Rule 9, etc., but (b) Plaintiffs' 
responsive submissions failed to state either Plaintiffs' facts or Plaintiffs' legal position as to any of these issues. "
202,38," While the FTAIA and Rule 9(b) pleading standards were well established at the time of Plaintiffs' filing of their Complaint, the 
Court is mindful of the fact that the Complaint was drafted without the benefit of the Supreme Court's clarifications provided later 
in Twombly."

is peculiarly appropriate when the issues involved are common to the class as a whole and when they turn on questions of 
law applicable in the same manner to each member of the class. For in such cases, the class-action device saves the 
resources of both the courts and the parties by permitting an issue potentially affecting every [class member] to be litigated

] ""Generally, when the prices for some customers are 
going up while the prices  [**26] of other customers are not, there is reason to doubt that the different customers (class 
members) are experiencing a common impact."")."
229,13," Before the District Court, both parties agreed Fed. R. Evid. 702 and Daubert should be applied to assess whether Beyer's 
testimony should be admitted for consideration. On appeal, neither party argues otherwise, and defendants do not now 
challenge the District Court's denial of the Daubert motion. (The District Court stated that ""because the evidence is here offered 
for the limited purpose of class certification, our inquiry is perhaps less exacting than it might be for evidence to be presented at 
trial."") As we explain, however, HN25[
] a district court's conclusion that an expert's opinion is admissible does not necessarily 
dispose of the ultimate question--whether the district court is satisfied, by all the evidence and arguments including all relevant 
expert opinion, that the requirements of Rule 23  [**27] have been met. "
230,14," The burden of proof rests on the movant. See Unger v. Amedisys Inc., 401 F.3d 316, 320 (5th Cir. 2005) (HN27[

class action machinery is expensive and in our view a court has the power to test disputed premises early on if and when the 
class action would be proper on one premise but not another.""). In Szabo, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit offered 
this persuasive explanation: The reason why judges accept a complaint's factual allegations when ruling on motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) is 
that a motion to dismiss tests the legal sufficiency of a pleading. Its factual sufficiency will be tested later--by a motion for 
summary judgment under Rule 56, and if necessary by trial. By contrast, an order certifying a class usually is the district 
judge's last word on the subject; there is no later test of the decision's factual premises (and, if the case is settled, there 
could not be such an examination even if the district judge viewed the certification as provisional). "

232,20," The Advisory Committee's note explains: HN42[
] Time may be needed to gather information necessary to make the certification decision. Although an evaluation 
of the probable outcome on the merits is not properly part of the certification decision, discovery in aid of the certification 
decision often includes information required to identify the nature of the issues that actually will be presented at trial. In this 
sense it is appropriate to conduct controlled discovery into the ""merits,"" limited to those aspects relevant to making the 
certification decision on an informed basis. Active judicial supervision may be required to achieve the most effective 
balance that expedites an informed certification determination without forcing an artificial and ultimately wasteful division 
between ""certification discovery"" and ""merits discovery."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 advisory committee's note, 2003 Amendments. "
233,," As the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure explained in its  [**42] report proposing this amendment, HN43[ ] the new language authorizes the more flexible approach many courts take to class-action litigation, recognizing the important consequences 
to the parties of the court's decision on certification. The current rule's emphasis on dispatch in making the certification 
decision has, in some circumstances, led courts to believe that they are overly constrained in the period before certification. 
A certain amount of discovery may be appropriate during this period to illuminate issues bearing on certification, including 
the nature of the issues that will be tried; whether the evidence on the merits is common to the members of the proposed 
class; whether the issues are susceptible to class-wide proof; and what trial-management problems the case will present. Report of the Judicial Conference Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure to the Chief Justice of the United States and 
Members of the Judicial Conference of the United States 10 (2002) [hereinafter Committee Report]."
233,21," Although the language 21 allowing for ""conditional"" certification has been removed, Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1)(C) provides that 
""[a]n order that grants or denies class certification may be altered or amended before final judgment."""
233,22," As the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has explained, [Some] circuits' HN51[
] use of the term 'findings' in this context should not be confused with binding findings on the 
merits. The judge's consideration of merits issues at the class certification stage pertains only to that stage; the ultimate 
factfinder, whether judge or jury, must still reach its own determination on these issues. "

""Critical evaluation of an expert's opinion  [**55] as to what conclusions the evidence supports will frequently bring courts close

253,3," Congress began deregulating the industry in the late 1970's, first with the enactment of the Railroad Revitalization and 
Regulatory Reform Act of 1980, followed shortly thereafter by the Staggers Rail Act of 1980. See City of Auburn v. United 
States, 154 F.3d at 1029 & n.6. Congress enacted ICCTA in order to complete the railroad  [**25] deregulation that the earlier 
statutes had begun. See S. REP. No. 104-176, at 5 (1995) (""the bill continues the deregulation theme of the past 15 years by 
providing further regulatory reductions in the surface transportation industries."")."
253,4," Plaintiffs argue that HN11[
] there is always a presumption against finding preemption. Certainly this is true when Congress 
has legislated in a field the states have traditionally occupied. See Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U.S. 470, 485, 116 S. Ct. 2240, 
135 L. Ed. 2d 700 (1996). Conversely, the federal government's historic regulation of the railroad system counsels against such 
a presumption in this case. See CSX Transp. v. Williams, 365 U.S. App. D.C. 331, 406 F.3d 667, 673 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (""the case 
for preemption is particularly strong where, as here [rail transportation], 'the State regulates in an area where there has been a 
history of significant federal presence'"") (quoting United States v. Locke, 529 U.S. 89, 108, 120 S. Ct. 1135, 146 L. Ed. 2d 69 
(2000)); see also Fla. E. Coast Ry. Co. v. City of W. Palm Beach, 266 F.3d at 1327-28. "
256,5," Nor need the Court decide whether a dismissal on preemption grounds is a dismissal for want of subject matter jurisdiction 
under Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6)."
256,6," The AGC factors include: (1) the nature of the plaintiff's alleged injury; (2) the directness of the injury; (3) the risk of duplicative

Carpenters (""AGC""), 459 U.S. at 542-44. "
257,7," Defendants' reliance on O.K. Sand & Gravel v. Martin Marietta Technologies for the required amount of factual detail that must 
be pled for antitrust standing is misplaced. The court there considered whether the plaintiff had produced enough evidence at 
trial to support the verdict, not what a plaintiff must plead to make the initial showing  [**42] of standing. See O.K. Sand & Gravel

272,125," Amended Complaint (D.I. 115), pp. 11-13. "
274,1," This court issued an Ex Parte Order granting Plaintiff a Temporary Restraining Order and Order of Seizure (ECF No. 10). 
Pursuant to that Order, on May 12, 2005, counsel for the Plaintiff carried out a seizure at Action's place of business, recovering 
233 Studio A DVDs that were not yet sold."
274,2," To support its claim that this industry practice exists, Defendants cite to the expert report of John Ban. This court, in a previous 
Order (ECF No. 170), struck John Ban's expert report in its entirety. The court again reaffirmed this decision in (ECF No. 175), in 
which the court denied Defendants' Motion for Reconsideration of the Order striking this report. The court, therefore, will not 
consider his report for the purpose of this Order, and an issue remains as to whether this industry practice indeed exists. "
276,3," Defendants also argue that Plaintiff failed to state any specific cause of action against either Action Software or Belfer. 
However, the First Amended Complaint clearly names them as Defendants and asserts each claim against ""Defendants,"" which 
would therefore include Action Software and Belfer. (First Amended Compl. ยถยถ 9, 14, 21, ECF No. 158.) The court, therefore, 
finds this argument unpersuasive."
276,4," Plaintiff attached the copyright registrations (ECF No. 157-5.) for 20 of the 21 DVD titles that demonstrate Studio A's 
ownership. For the remaining title, Plaintiff demonstrated that it was owned by another company, which was controlled by Studio 
A's president, Paul Nevitt. The registration was transferred to Studio A by oral agreement in 1996, and was confirmed in writing 
by the parties in March 2007. "
277,5," Plaintiff submitted the statement of Richard Breene as a lay witness and not an expert witness. However, many of the 
statements made by Breene in his declaration are based on his scientific knowledge within the graphics and printing field. 
Pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 701, the court is prohibited from considering this testimony without Plaintiff first 
establishing him as an expert witness. The court, however, is permitted to consider those statements that are based on Breene's 
personal knowledge as the owner of the printing company used by Studio A. See e.g. Lightning Lube, Inc. v. Witco Corp., 4 F.3d 
1153 (3d Cir. 1993) (finding that the district court did not err in permitting the plaintiff's owner to give lay opinion testimony as to 
damages as it was based on his knowledge and participation in the business.) The court will therefore consider only those 
statements made by Breene with personal knowledge and not those that are opinions derived from his potential expertise in the 
printing field. "
280,6," Plaintiff also provides evidence of the origin of these unauthorized copies. This evidence, however, is based in part on the 
testimony of Kyriazoglou, the owner of Active Distributors, who sold these DVDs to Action. Kyriazoglou, however, was not 
deposed in the instant case and was instead deposed in another case, in which Defendants were not a party. Plaintiff argues 
that the court should consider this deposition and claims that it could not compel his testimony as Kyriazoglou is a Canadian 
citizen. Because he was not deposed in the instant suit, his testimony from another case is hearsay. Furthermore, Plaintiff has 
not demonstrated that the deposition testimony falls within the unavailability hearsay exception for former testimony under Fed. 
R. Evid. 804(b)(1), as it has not shown that Defendants or ""a predecessor in interest had an opportunity and similar motive to 
develop the testimony"" of Kryriazoglou. Therefore, the court will not rely on this testimony. "
295,1," After these motions were filed, but before the plaintiff filed its responses, the plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint (""Am. 
Compl.""). The parties concede that the motions to dismiss apply equally to the Complaint (DE 1) and the Amended Complaint 
(DE 234). The court therefore addresses its attention to the Amended Complaint."
295,2," The court will take the plaintiff's factual allegations as true for purposes of this motion to dismiss. See Erickson v. Pardus, 551 
U.S. 89, 94, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 2200, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (2007) (noting, HN1[
] ""when ruling on a defendant's motion to dismiss, 
a judge must accept as true all of the factual allegations contained in the complaint"" (citations omitted))."
295,3," These companies were Philip Morris, Inc. (""Philip Morris""), R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. (""Reynolds""), Brown & Williamson 
Tobacco Corp. (""B&W""), and Lorillard Tobacco Co. (""Lorillard.""). Reynolds subsequently acquired B&W. Am. Compl. P 3 n.3."
295,4," The Settling States include 46 states (all states except Florida, Minnesota, Mississippi, and Texas), five territories (American 
Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands), and  [**13] the District of Columbia."
295,5," The Master Settlement Agreement was attached as Exhibit A to the plaintiff's amended complaint. It is also available on the 
website of the National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG) at http://www.naag.org/backpages/naag/tobacco/msa/msa-
pdf/1109185724_103246 8605_cigmsa.pdf. "
296,6," The defendant Attorney General of Kentucky has provided the following explanation for how the mechanism worked: Every Participating Manufacturer makes a single annual settlement payment based on its total shipments or sales of 
cigarettes in the United States during the previous year. That payment is allocated among Settling States according to 
percentages for each State (""Allocable Share""), which Allocable Share bears no relationship to the PM's actual sales in the 
State. The original Escrow Statutes, however, allowed each NPM to obtain an immediate release of any excess (a) of its 
annual escrow deposit  [**16] for sales in a State over (b) what would have been the State's Allocable Share of the 
hypothetical MSA payment the NPM would have made for those sales had it been an SPM. This could effectively eliminate 
an NPM's escrow obligation. For example, an NPM that made 50 percent of its cigarette sales in Kentucky could obtain a 
release of the difference between (a) an escrow deposit based on 50 percent of its sales and (b) Kentucky's Allocable 
Share of 1.7611586% of the NPM's total sales, which difference would result in a release of about 96.5 percent of the 
NPM's escrow deposit in Kentucky. DE 149, p. 7 n.9. "
297,7," In pertinent part, the LMFN clause provides: (b) Limited Most-Favored Nation Provision. (2) If any Settling State resolves by settlement Claims against any Non-Participating Manufacturer after the  [**20] MSA 
Execution Date comparable to any Released Claim, and such resolution includes overall terms that are more favorable to such 
Non-Participating Manufacturer than the terms of this Agreement (including, without limitation, any terms that relate to the 
marketing or distribution of Tobacco Products and any term that provides for a lower settlement cost on a per pack sold basis), 
then the overall terms of this Agreement will be revised so that the Original Participating Manufacturers will obtain, with respect 
to that Settling State, overall terms at least as relatively favorable (taking into account, among other things, all payments 
previously made by the Original Participating Manufacturers and the timing of any payments) as those obtained by such Non-
Participating Manufacturer pursuant to such resolution of Claims. The foregoing shall include but not be limited: (a) to the 
treatment by any Settling State of a Future Affiliate, as that term is defined in agreements between any of the Settling States and 
Brooke Group Ltd., Liggett & Myers Inc. and/or Liggett Group, Inc.(""Liggett""), whether or not such Future Affiliate is merged with, 
or its operations combined with, Liggett or any Affiliate  [**21] thereof; and (b) to any application of the terms of any such 
agreement (including any terms subsequently negotiated pursuant to any such agreement) to a brand of Cigarettes (or tobacco-
related assets)as a result of the purchase by or sale to Liggett of such brand or assets or as a result of any combination of 
ownership among Liggett and any entity that manufactures Tobacco Products. Provided, however, that revision of this 
Agreement pursuant to this subsection (2) shall not be required by virtue of the subsequent entry into this Agreement by a 
Tobacco Product Manufacturer that has not become a Participating Manufacturer as of the MSA Execution Date. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection XVIII(j), the provisions of this subsection XVIII(b)(2) may be waived by (and only 
by) unanimous agreement of the Original Participating Manufacturers. [. . . .] "
298,," (4)  [**22] If at any time any Settling State agrees to relieve, in any respect, any Participating Manufacturer's obligation to make 
the payments as provided in this Agreement, then, with respect to that Settling State, the terms of this Agreement shall be 
revised so that the other Participating Manufacturers receive terms as relatively favorable. MSA ยงXVIII(b)."
298,8," The OPMs include: Philip Morris USA, Inc., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., and Lorillard Tobacco Co."
298,9," The ""grandfathered"" SPMs include: Commonwealth Brands, Inc., Liggett Group LLC, Vector Tobacco Inc., Imperial Tobacco 
Limited/ITL (USA), Japan Tobacco International USA, Inc., King Maker Manufacturing, Inc., Lane Limited, Lignum-2, Inc., M/S 
Dhanraj, P.T. Djarum, Premier Manufacturing, Inc., Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Co., Societe National D'Exploitation Industrielles 
des Tobacs et Allumettes (SEITA) Sherman's 1400 Broadway N.Y.C., Inc., and Top Tobacco, L.P. Defendant SPMs M/S 
Dhanraj and SEITA did not join the other SPMs in their motion  [**23] to dismiss. See DE 156. "
299,10," Defendant manufacturers filed two separate motions, one by the three OPMs and one by thirteen of the SPMs. Their motions 
are almost identical substantively. "
300,11," The plaintiff has attempted to distinguish its claims from those made in the cited cases based on differences between itself 
and the other plaintiffs. As the relevant conduct at issue in this case, that is, the conduct of the defendant PMs in negotiating and 
executing the settlement, is identical, the differences in the situations of the plaintiffs is of no relevance to the court's reasoning."
300,12," Given the court's reliance on Noerr-Pennington, the court need not determine whether the plaintiff  [**33] has stated a claim 
under the ""essential facilities"" doctrine, although the court briefly addresses the elements of that doctrine in n.18, infra. "
301,13," As a result, it is not actually clear that the wrong alleged even falls within the scope of the Sherman Act. See section II(A)(1), 
infra, for a discussion of the state action doctrine, also known as Parker immunity, and its applicability to the instant case. 
However, to whatever extent the  [**34] wrong alleged does fall within the scope of the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, the defendant 
manufacturers are immune from liability. See City of Columbia, 111 S. Ct. at 1355 (""As we have described, HN5[
] Parker and 
Noerr are complementary expressions of the principle that the antitrust laws regulate business, not politics; the former decision 
protects the States' acts of governing, and the latter the citizens' participation in government."")."
301,14," At the hearing on the motions, the plaintiff also argued that the defendants were not immune because the MSA is a 
commercial agreement between the defendant PMs and the states. HN6[
] ""[N]o such 'commercial exception' exists to the 
Noerr-Pennington doctrine."" PTI, Inc., 100 F.Supp.2d at 1193 n.12 (citing In re Airport Car Rental Antitrust Litigation, 693 F.2d 
84, 88 (9th Cir. 1982)); see also Greenwood Utilities Comm'n v. Mississippi Power Co., 751 F.2d 1484, 1505 (5th Cir. 1985). "
302,15," The court will attempt to address thoroughly such claims, although it is not entirely clear that the plaintiff intended to make 
them. At the hearing on the motions, plaintiff's counsel apparently disavowed such claims, stating that ""[t]he antitrust conspiracy 
here is not state action."" TR 55, In 14-15. He added, ""So we're not challenging state action here. We're challenging the inability 
 [**38] of the states to act as they want to act with us, because the Defendant manufacturers have banded together and they're 
preventing the states from acting."" TR 58, In 2-5. Furthermore, in the plaintiff's response to the defendants' motions to dismiss, 
the plaintiff did not specifically address the argument of the defendant Attorneys General that state-action immunity applies to 
any antitrust claim against the states. At the hearing, however, the court asked the plaintiff whether counts one and eight were 
alleged against the states, to which counsel for the plaintiff replied: ""Count 1 is against the states. Count 8 is not."" TR 51, 18-19. 
The only antitrust claim that at all implicates the states is count one of the plaintiff's complaint. Am. Compl. PP 195, 196, 199, 
200, 203. What follows is the court's attempt to reconcile these inconsistencies. "
303,16," According to Midcal, ""First, the challenged restraint must be one articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy; 
second, the policy must be actively supervised by the State itself."" Tritent, 467 F.3d at 555 (quoting Midcal, 445 U.S. at 105)."
303,17," The cited material also discusses Fisher v. City of Berkeley, California, 475 U.S. 260, 106 S. Ct. 1045, 89 L. Ed. 2d 206 
(1986), which established the concept of a ""hybrid restraint."" A ""hybrid restraint"" ""exists when the state passes laws that enforce 
companies' decisions to collude on prices, to dictate prices by which other companies must abide, or to otherwise violate the 
Sherman Act."" Sanders, 504 F.3d at 918. Plaintiff's counsel vaguely alluded to the ideas of Fisher at the hearing on the motions, 
in the context of the plaintiff's claims against the PMs. See TR 146, In 18-19. Because the court does not understand the plaintiff 
to have alleged that the MSA is a hybrid restraint, it will not address Fisher or any relevance it may have to the present dispute."
303,18," The court here attempts to address any confusion on this point. At the hearing on the motions, in response to the court's question as to whether the plaintiff was alleging that the MSA or any 
portion of it constituted an antitrust violation, plaintiff's counsel stated, ""We are alleging that the disparate payment terms for 
Subsequent Participating Manufacturers under the Master Settlement Agreement constitutes an antitrust violation."" TR 54, In 10-
12. Counsel then elaborated, ""The case law says that . . . an essential facilities claim . . . is a per se violation of the antitrust 
laws."" TR 54, In 14-16. HN10[
] When a state authorizes an antitrust violation by private actors in all situations, that law is pre-empted by the Sherman 
Act. See Tritent, 467 F.3d at 554-56. In Tritent, the plaintiff alleged that Kentucky's complementary legislation violated the 
Sherman Act. 467 F.3d at 548-49. Finding that the case was a ""typical preemption case,"" the Sixth Circuit sought to determine 
""whether there exist[ed] an irreconcilable conflict between the federal and state regulatory schemes."" Id. at 554 (quoting Rice, 
458 U.S. at 659). Guided by Rice, the Tritent court concluded  [**44] that the state legislation was not pre-empted by the 
Sherman Act. Id. at 556-58. The court emphasized that for such pre-emption to exist, a statute must mandate illegal activity ""in 
all cases,"" and ultimately held that Kentucky's statute was not pre-empted because it did not do so. Id. 554-56. Count one is the only count that the plaintiff asserts is against the states, and so any claim that the states have acted wrongfully 
because the MSA authorizes antitrust violations would have to come from this count. Count one concerns the plaintiff's 
""essential facilities"" allegations. HN11[
] The basic elements of an ""essential facilities"" antitrust violation are that a competitor 
has denied the plaintiff reasonable access to some facility the competitor controls and that is necessary to compete in their 
shared market. See, e.g., Ohio Bell Telephone Co. v. CoreComm Newco, Inc. 214 F.Supp.2d 810, 818 (N.D.Ohio, 2002) (citing 
Ideal Dairy Farms, Inc. v. John Labatt, Ltd., 90 F.3d 737, 748 (3d Cir.1996)) (describing the ""elements necessary to establish an 
essential facilities claim""). The court will assume for the sake of argument that the MSA and its provisions are a ""regulatory scheme"" created by a state 
 [**45] and capable of being pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiff has not alleged that the MSA authorizes its competitors to 
deny it access to the MSA. Rather, the plaintiff has argued that the state Attorneys General have allowed themselves, 
unnecessarily, and in violation of the rights actually created by the LMFN clause, to be influenced by the PMs' threats to invoke "
304,," their LMFN rights. Even when the court construes all facts in favor of the plaintiff, the plaintiff has not argued that the MSA itself 
authorizes what the PMs have done. See Am. Compl. P 197, 198, 199, 203. And it certainly has presented no facts to show that 
the MSA authorizes a violation ""in all cases."" On the contrary, the plaintiff admits that the MSA does not give the plaintiff's competitors the ability to decide whether or on what 
terms a company will have access to the MSA. Counsel for the plaintiff analogized the MSA to a bridge to the market, with the 
""Attorneys General . . . sitting in the tollbooth controlling the gate. But standing over their shoulders . . . [are] the manufacturers"" 
influencing the decision-making of the Attorneys General. TR 130, In 17-24. The facts of the present case, as presented by the 
plaintiff,  [**46] are simply that the states have allowed the PMs to influence their decision. And that decision, as indicated 
above, is direct state action for which the state remains immune. Thus, the plaintiff's ""essential facilities"" claim cannot constitute 
an allegation that the MSA should be pre-empted by the Sherman Act, nor would it succeed."
304,19," The state is not incapable of entering into an agreement, or passing a law, that presents constitutional problems. The alleged 
constitutional defects of the agreement, however, do not implicate the Sherman Act and will be addressed by the court in a 
subsequent section of this opinion. "
305,20," The plaintiff does not argue that the Settling States' refusal to enact the Amended Adherence Agreement violated its 
constitutional rights. All of the plaintiff's constitutional claims pertain to the MSA itself."
305,21," The court does not sit in diversity jurisdiction for this action and therefore applies federal choice-of-law rules. HN17[
] 
Federal choice-of-law rules dictate that the court must apply the law of the jurisdiction having the most significant relationship 
with the action. See, e.g., In re Gaston & Snow, 243 F.3d 599, 605 (2d Cir. 2001). Neither party has suggested that it matters for 
the resolution of this issue which state's law of contract interpretation the court uses. The court therefore will be guided by 
Kentucky law on contracts. "
307,22," The plaintiff's Equal Protection challenge to the requirement that it make payments into the escrow account on a quarterly 
basis does not challenge a provision of the MSA; rather, it attacks a requirement that is specific to the plaintiff and is detailed in 
the Adherence Agreement, which makes the MSA run against the plaintiff. See Am. Compl., Exhibit B, P 10. Even if the plaintiff 
had not waived such a constitutional challenge, it would fail on its merits. The parties agree that HN19[
] any Equal Protection 
claim calls for rational-basis review. The defendant Attorneys General have stated a rational basis for requiring quarterly, rather 
than annual, payments into escrow: ""[T]he States have learned since the signing of the MSA that quarterly deposits of both 
escrow and MSA payments encourage compliance."" DE 149, p.25. The plaintiff's factual allegations do not contradict the 
soundness  [**58] of this rationale. The claim is therefore without merit. "
310,23," The nonresident Attorneys General requested this court to dismiss the claims against them pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 
12(b)(2) and 12(b)(3) and contingently joined the Attorney General of Kentucky's motion to dismiss pursuant to lack of subject-
matter jurisdiction and Rule 12(b)(6). DE 208. Given the court's conclusion as to the plaintiff's constitutional claims, the court 
finds it unnecessary to reach the issues of whether venue in this district is appropriate and whether it has personal jurisdiction 
over the nonresident Attorneys General. Regardless of how the court chose to rule on that motion, the claims against the 
nonresident Attorneys General would be dismissed because the plaintiff has failed to state any claim under the U.S. Constitution 
for which the court can grant relief, and so all of its constitutional claims against all defendant Attorneys General will be 
dismissed. Defendant attorney general Peter Nickles (District of Columbia) has represented to the court through plaintiff's 
counsel that he received process, so his motion to dismiss for improper service, as well  [**70] as the remaining motion to 
quash, will be denied as moot."
310,24," And, indeed, no party has claimed that they do not. The court makes this point merely to distinguish between the applicability 
of the sovereign-immunity doctrine to this claim by the plaintiff and not to its other claims against the states. "
316,*," The Honorable George Wu, United States District Judge for the Central District of California, sitting by designation. "
317,1," This regulation was promulgated in response to a constitutional  [**4] challenge to LSC restrictions on recipients using non-
LSC funds for otherwise constitutional activities. Shortly after the restrictions were amended in 1996 to prohibit certain legal 
activities, a district court in Hawaii enjoined the LSC from enforcing them ""to the extent that they relate to the use of Non-LSC 
Funds."" Legal Aid Soc'y of Haw. v. Legal Servs. Corp. (LASH), 961 F. Supp. 1402, 1422 (D. Haw. 1997). The district court found 
that the plaintiffs had a significant likelihood of success in arguing that the restrictions constituted unconstitutional conditions on 
the receipt of a federal subsidy. Id. at 1416-17. The new rule, codified at ยง 1610.8, allows recipients to affiliate with organizations that use non-federal funds to engage in 
restricted activities, subject to preserving ""objective integrity"" between the two organizations. In so doing, it overcame the 
constitutional concerns raised in LASH. See Legal Aid Soc'y of Haw. v. Legal Servs. Corp. (LASH II), 145 F.3d 1017, 1021-
23 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1015, 119 S. Ct. 539, 142 L. Ed. 2d 448 (1998)."
317,2," These regulations were designed to mirror the program integrity rule promulgated pursuant to Title X of the Public Health 
Service Act, which withstood  [**5] constitutional attack in Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 111 S. Ct. 1759, 114 L. Ed. 2d 233 
(1991). See 62 Fed. Reg. 27,695-97 (May 21, 1997). LSC's current regulations have also withstood constitutional challenges. 
See LASH II, 145 F.3d at 1031; Velazquez v. Legal Servs. Corp. (Velazquez II), 164 F.3d 757, 773 (2d Cir. 1999). "
318,3," Neither the district court nor the parties alluded to any possible jurisdictional problem with Oregon's prosecution of this action. 
We therefore asked, at oral argument, for supplemental briefing on Oregon's standing to pursue this action. "

the MSA, like the OPMs' waiver of their First Amendment advertising and lobbying rights. New York v. Philip Morris, 686 
N.Y.S.2d at 568 & 569 n.6; see Freedom Holdings III, 447 F. Supp. 2d at 250."
329,3," The annual payment obligations of grandfathered SPMs and non-grandfathered SPMs are calculated differently. See MSA Art. 
IX(i). If a grandfathered SPM's sales increase, it pays a portion of the total SPM adjusted base payment (which is a volume-
adjusted  [**10] version of the total OPM base payment). This portion is determined by dividing the increase in the grandfathered 
SPM's market share by the current aggregate market share of OPMs. Thus: "
330,," (current market share) -- (greater of 1998 market share or 125% of 1997 market share) current aggregate market share of OPMs A non-grandfathered SPM also pays a portion of the total SPM adjusted base payment, but regardless of whether its market 
share increased, remained flat, or decreased. This portion is determined by dividing its actual market share (not just the 
increase) by the current aggregate market share of OPMs. See MSA Art. IX(i)(4). "
331,4," ""Tr."" refers to the transcript of the evidentiary hearing held on November 18-20, 2008."
331,5," General Tobacco, the largest NPM to become a non-grandfathered SPM, joined the MSA in July 2004, which accounts for the 
fact that the SPMs' total market share has expanded slightly at the NPMs' expense in the years since. Tr. 268-76, 314-15; Def. 
Exh. W, tbl. 1b. "

332,7," This column represents the average payment for all cigarettes sold by grandfathered SPMs--that is, sales both below and 
above the grandfathered threshold."
332,8," For cartons sold above the SPMs' grandfathered thresholds, the marginal per-carton payment was $ 5.07 in 2007, matching 
 [**18] the average per-carton payment of non-grandfathered SPMs. See Def. Exh. H, tbl. 3."
332,9," Def. Exh. W, tbl. 1 a; Def. Exh. E, tbl. 1. "
334,12," Accepting as proved the Complaint's allegation that the challenged statutes grant regulatory power to private actors, the Court 
of Appeals ruled that the Escrow and Contraband Statutes were not merely unilateral acts of state government, but ""hybrid 
restraint[s]"" vulnerable to preemption by the federal antitrust laws. Id. at 223; see 324 Liquor Corp. v. Duffy, 479 U.S. 335, 345-
46 n.8, 107 S. Ct. 720, 93 L. Ed. 2d 667 (1987). "
335,13," The Court of Appeals summarized Plaintiffs' allegations: ""[T]he combination of the MSA, the Escrow Statutes, and the 
Contraband Statutes, allows OPMs to set supracompetitive prices that effectively cause other manufacturers either to charge 
similar prices or to cease selling. . . . NPMs are forced to charge these prices to cover the costs imposed by the Escrow and 
Contraband Statutes or go out of business in New York."" Freedom Holdings I, 357 F.3d at 226. "
336,14," Plaintiffs also contend that the decline in cigarette consumption began before the MSA, but no one can say that the MSA did 
not provide a major impetus to cause the decline to continue and accelerate. "
337,15," The Court of Appeals credited Plaintiffs' argument that the MSA's SPM payment formula penalizes SPMs that gain market 
share from OPMs, which allegedly compels SPMs to follow OPM price increases to avoid gaining market share at their expense. 
Freedom Holdings II, 363 F.3d at 153. It is true that the denominator  [**35] of the ratio used in the formula causes the collective 
market position of the OPMs to affect what an individual SPM must pay, and that, as a result, if an SPM's share of the total 
market increases, the increase in the amount that it must pay is not directly proportional to its increase in market share, 
especially if the aggregate total market share of OPMs decreases in the same year. See Freedom Holdings III, 447 F. Supp. 2d 
at 235-36. However, the proofs show that SPMs target the ""deep discount"" market, and so would be unlikely to follow OPM price 
increases. See Tr. 94. Moreover, even if SPMs did follow OPM price increases, doing so would create a market opportunity for 
NPMs, not a competitive disadvantage. "
340,16," Kevin Altman, who worked for two NPMs, testified that NPMs receive their credit very soon after they make their payment into 
escrow. Tr. 24. "
341,17," Polishook Decl., Exh. G, at 11. Because these figures suggest that cigarettes represent a per-stick net drain on the public fisc, 
they undercut the notion that New York's ""goals of serving public health and enhancing revenue conflict."" Contra Freedom 
Holdings I, 357 F.3d at 230. "
343,18," NPM witnesses in this case testified to the same effect, that their prices were set internally and not dictated by OPM or SPM 
prices. Tr. 87-88, 109-10."
343,19," One commentator suggests that the coordinated, nationally-oriented character of state action resulting from the MSA might 
raise constitutional concerns under the Interstate Compact Clause, U.S. Const. art. I ยง 10, cl. 3; see generally Michael S. Greve, 
Compacts, Cartels, and Congressional Consent, 68 Mo. L. Rev. 285 (2003). The claim is not before me, and at least one court 
of appeals has rejected it. See Star Scientific, Inc. v. Beales, 278 F.3d 339, 360 (4th Cir. 2002). "
354,1," In addition to being certified as a PDP, insurers could also obtain certification as a Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug Plan 
(""MAPD""), which functions as an HMO in addition to providing prescription drugs. For 2006, 72% of Part D enrollees were 
enrolled in standalone PDPs, while 28% were enrolled in MAPDs. (Ex. A to Rubinfeld Decl. P 33, Attach. to Mem. in Opp'n.) 
Among LTC enrollees, MAPDs were even less common. (Id.) "
355,2," Companies considering a merger frequently share ""significant quantities of competitively sensitive information regarding their 
respective businesses in the course of investigatory 'due diligence'"" in order for each party to determine whether the business 
deal makes sense. See ANTITRUST ADVISER ยง 3:74, at 3-270 (Irving Scher ed., 4th ed. 2007)."
355,3," The June 9 meeting included, from PacifiCare, Jacqueline Kosecoff (Executive Vice President), Greg Scott (CFO), and Chris 
Karkenny (official in Corporate Development); from UnitedHealth, officials included Ed Lagerstrom (head of Corporate 
Development), Jerry Knutson (CFO of Ovations, UnitedHealth's senior business component), Rick Jelinek (President of 
Ovations' Senior and Retiree Services), and Tom Paul (CEO of a UnitedHealth subsidiary). (Due Diligence Summary--Point Part 
D, Ex. 38 to Mem. in Opp'n; Omnicare's Resp. to Defs.' 56.1 P 23.)"
355,4," In the parties' submissions, the acronym ""AWP"" is alternatively used to refer to both an ""Any Willing Provider"" contract and a 
recognized industry rate known as ""Average Wholesale Price."" To avoid confusion, the court uses ""AWP"" only to refer to 
""Average Wholesale Price,""  [**12] and will write out the phrase ""Any Willing Provider."" "
356,5," The June 28 meeting consisted mostly of the same personnel involved in the June 9 meeting. A few additional individuals 
participated on June 28, however,  [**14] including Lois Quam (CEO of Ovations), Peter Frank (outside counsel for 
UnitedHealth), and Howard Phanstiel (CEO of PacifiCare). (Due Diligence Summary--Point Part D, Ex. 38 to Mem. in Opp'n; 
Omnicare's Resp. to Defs.' 56.1 P 23.)"
356,6," The record does not reflect whether UnitedHealth's attorneys did in fact see the report or whether the attorneys made any 
changes to it."
356,7," Specifically, the Merger Agreement states that PacifiCare may not enter into contracts (other than those required in the 
ordinary course of business) in excess of $ 3 million prior to the completion of the merger, ""except as required by applicable Law 
. . . or provided in Section 5.01(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter and except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement."" 
(Merger Agreement ยง 5.01(a), Ex. 72 to Mem. in Opp'n.) "
357,8," Omnicare suggests that Ms. Infante's conclusions were actually written as an advocacy piece prepared in response to 
UnitedHealth's request for the ""strongest legal arguments"" in favor of a finding that the Protections are unlawful. (Omnicare's 
Resp. to Defs.' 56.1 P 41; Ex. 163 to Mem. in Opp'n.) An e-mail from Infante to Tobin does state that Infante ""decided to use the 
statutory framework because it provided the simplest way to outline your strongest legal arguments."" (Ex. 163 to Mem. in Opp'n 
(emphasis added).) The memorandum itself nowhere suggests that it was written with a predetermined result, however (""As 
requested, I have reviewed the Pharmacy Network Agreement . . . and conclude, for the reasons outlined below, that the 
prescription drugs provided under this agreement would not qualify for reimbursement under Medicare Part D."" [Infante Memo at 
1, App. 133 to Mem. in Supp.]), and both Infante and Tobin maintain that Infante's conclusions were not dictated by 
UnitedHealth. (Tobin Dep. 333:14-17, Ex. 159 to  [**20] Mem. in Opp'n; Infante Dep. 96:2-17, Ex. 164 to Mem. in Opp'n.) "
359,9," The record does not reflect when or how Bien and Omnicare learned of the merger. Even if neither of the merging parties 
informed Omnicare of the merger prior to the signing of the Merger Agreement, Omnicare surely learned of  [**29] the merger 
shortly thereafter, as news of the merger was widely reported, including on the front page of the Wall Street Journal. Vanessa 
Fuhrmans et al., Two Health Plans Agree on a Deal for $ 8.1 Billion--UnitedHealth Adds Heft in California and Medicare with 
Move on PacifiCare, WALL ST. J., July 7, 2005, at A1. "
360,10," Several separate e-mails attached to Omnicare's brief contain copies of this memorandum. (E.g. Ex. 25; Ex. 44; Ex. 45; Ex. 
211; Ex. 215; Ex. 216.) The basic document is the same in each exhibit, although some differences, including the precise 
placement of the ""stalking horse"" language, do appear. However, neither party appears to consider those differences material, 
and the court agrees that no substantive  [**34] changes altered the meaning of this memorandum in any of the exhibits "
361,," provided by Omnicare. (See Quam Dep. 207:16-21, Ex. 8 to Mem. in Opp'n (witness had same understanding of ""stalking horse"" 
language when it was repositioned in the memorandum).) None of these copies clearly state who originally authored the memorandum, but it circulated among several officials responsible 
for pharmacy network management at the two entities, including Lois Quam and Peggy Olson at UnitedHealth; Howard 
Phanstiel, CEO of PacifiCare; and Jacqueline Kosecoff, an Executive Vice President at PacifiCare. (Exs. 44, 45 to Mem. in 
Opp'n.)"
361,11," It is not altogether clear whether other PDP sponsors covered by the terms of the WHI-Omnicare Agreement also had 
concerns that the Agreement was inconsistent with federal regulations. At her deposition, Simenson expressed no opinion as to 
whether the WHI-Omnicare Agreement was noncompliant with Medicare regulations as to other PDP sponsors covered by the 
Agreement, but stated that part of the problem as it specifically related to UnitedHealth was that the Agreement allowed for more 
expansive benefit design than UnitedHealth's own policies did. (Simenson Dep. 44:3-16, App.135 to Mem. in Supp.) Even after 
UnitedHealth was dropped from the WHI-Omnicare Agreement, WHI continued to seek to make changes to that Agreement 
(presumably on behalf of other PDPs), although these changes appear to have been motivated by business reasons rather than 
concerns about illegality. (Defs.' 56.1 P 141.) The WHI-Omnicare Agreement continued  [**37] in effect with respect to the other 
PDPs covered by it until December 31, 2008, the end of the initial term originally contemplated in the Agreement. (Ex. 19 to 
Mem. in Opp'n; Omnicare's Supplemental Statement of Undisputed Material Facts P 39.) "
366,12," The clear and unequivocal language of the Company Disclosure Letter makes it unnecessary to consider Defendants' 
arguments that two other provisions of the Merger Agreement demonstrate that the approval provision does not apply to 
PacifiCare's Part D contract with Omnicare."
366,13," Omnicare has not provided any evidence that UnitedHealth in fact would have backed out of the merger if CMS did not certify 
PacifiCare's PDP. "
367,14," According to Bien, Omnicare's ""shift in thinking"" in agreeing to PDP form contracts after August 1 was caused by Omnicare's 
desire to protect its patients' interests by ensuring they would be covered under Part D, and not the result of a reduction in 
Omnicare's bargaining power. (Omnicare's Resp. to Defs.' 56.1 P 82; Bien Dep. 127:12-128:4, Ex. 79 to Mem. in Opp'n.) "
371,15," At his deposition, Frank said that disqualification would have been unnecessary if he knew what PacifiCare was going to tell 
him. (Frank Dep. 127:15-23, App. 21 to Mem. in Supp.) "
372,16," Omnicare also suggests that this strategy to impermissibly use RxSolutions was discussed at the June 28, 2005 due diligence 
meeting between UnitedHealth and PacifiCare. A memorandum prepared after the meeting shows that the parties discussed 
ways to combine resources, and UnitedHealth concluded that ""[t]he combined entities would be advantaged through the . . . 
[c]onsolidation and leverage of resources in regard to Pharmacy benefit administration (PBMs) [and] Pharmacy Network 
contracting . . . ."" (Due Diligence Summary-Point Part D, Ex. 38 to Mem. in Opp'n, at UN282570.) The court sees no impropriety 
in this comment. UnitedHealth was considering ways to achieve better economies of scale after the merger and suggested that 
the PBM area was one area where this was possible. Omnicare's argument that this memorandum provides  [**79] direct or 
indirect evidence of a conspiracy is unpersuasive. "
375,17, Defendants do not appear to dispute the materiality of the e-mail. 
376,18," In the case of Ann Tobin, UnitedHealth claimed attorney-client privilege to prevent her from answering. (Tobin Dep. 220:11-15, 
Ex. 109 to Mem. in Opp'n.) Omnicare does not appear to have challenged the assertion that communications with  [**97] Tobin 
were privileged. "
377,19," Of course, UnitedHealth may have declined to answer such a detailed question, to the extent that it had an answer at this 
point prior to the closing  [**99] of the deal. Whether UnitedHealth would or could have answered such a question is, of course, 
a question the record does not answer. "
380,1," Plaintiff Claire C. Haggarty in the related, and practically identically-pled suit, Haggarty v. Stryker, C08-160 JSW, underwent hip 
replacement surgery as well and her case is adjudicated by this Order. To the extent the  [*3] facts differ, the Court will so note 
throughout. "
381,2," To the extent Plaintiff relies on the Congressional testimony, it is not clear that such testimony actually referenced Stryker, as 
opposed to the other four hip and knee replacement products manufacturers. (See Supplemental Declaration of William M. 
Goodman, testimony of Gregory E. Demske, at 4.) "
382,3," Plaintiff Haggarty, in the related suit, alleges that she incurred $ 3,600 in out-of- pocket expenses for her surgeries. (Haggarty 
Complaint at P 30.)"
382,4," The Court is not persuaded by Stryker's argument that the Court should abstain from adjudicating whether an injunction would 
be appropriate relief for a well-drafted claim under California's unfair competition law. The Court does not find the issue mooted 
as a matter of law. "
396,1," St. Tammany Pearl River Salvage was terminated from the case on October 30, 2006. (R. Doc. 86). "
399,2," The other defendants, George Carmouche, James Huey, and the Levee District, have also filed motions for summary 
judgment. Because plaintiffs have yet to oppose those motions, the Court will consider them in a separate motion."
399,3," Plaintiffs' memoranda suggest that they made claims under the Sherman Act as well as state antitrust statutes. Plaintiffs did not 
make these claims in any of their complaints, and thus the Court will not consider them. "
400,4," Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 15 (1997) states in part: [A]ny person who shall be injured  [*17] in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws 
may sue therefor in any district court of the United States . . . and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, 
and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee. "
408,1," Plaintiffs assert that the ""going"" rate is six or seven percent on pre-existing properties, while plaintiffs offer five percent on such 
properties. As discussed in my previous  [**4] opinions, other realtors are affected by Hackman's rate because under the 
Multiple Listings Service (""MLS"") rules, the buyer's and seller's agents typically split equally the commission earned on a sale. 
See Hackman I, at 957."
408,2, Only Counts III and IV are asserted against IAR. 
409,3," Plaintiffs allege in P 26 that Hall was also present for a similar conversation in late 1999, but these allegations are less specific."
409,4," I understand from the allegations as a whole that these actions are related to the alleged illegal boycott, and that RAAR 
exercised some adjudicatory function with respect to these actions. "
410,5," In Hackman I, I dismissed this claim against RAAR (it was not then asserted against Hall) on the ground that the original 
complaint failed to allege that RAAR ""agreed or conspired with other defendants to monopolize the market, only that other 
defendants used their position in RAAR to obtain a monopoly."" Hackman I, 520 F.Supp.2d, at 965."
410,6," Oddly, RAAR does not raise  [**13] this argument, but I find it applicable to RAAR nevertheless. "
411,7," The Illinois Act provides: HN8[
] ยง 3. Every person shall be deemed to have committed a violation of this Act who shall: (1) Make any contract with, or engage in any combination or conspiracy with, any other person who is, or but for a prior 
agreement would be, a competitor of such person: a. for the purpose or with the effect of fixing, controlling, or maintaining the price or rate charged for any commodity sold or 
bought by the parties thereto, or the fee charged or paid for any service performed or received by the parties thereto; . . . (2) By contract, combination, or conspiracy with one or more other persons unreasonably restrain trade or commerce; or (3) Establish, maintain, use, or attempt to acquire monopoly power over any substantial part of trade or commerce of this 
State for the purpose of excluding competition or of controlling, fixing, or maintaining prices in such trade or commerce."
411,8," I previously rejected RAAR's argument that it is not subject to liability under Section 3(2) of the Illinois Act based on its non-
profit status, Hackman I, at 966, and I reject it again here. "
412,9," Plaintiffs cite only state authority in support of their claim for declaratory judgment. Regardless of whether state or federal law 
governs this claim, ""a case of actual controversy"" is required by the Constitution. See Wisconsin Central, Ltd. V. Shannon 539 
F.3d 751, 759 (7th Cir. 2008) (ability to seek preemptive relief under Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. ยง 2201, does not 
vitiate constitutional requirement)."
412,10," I note in passing that plaintiffs do not allege that the Manual creates any individual rights at all, or that it provides an individual 
right of judicial action to enforce its provisions. In fact, there appears to be merit to RAAR and IAR's claim that plaintiffs waived 
their right to judicial recourse for alleged non-compliance with the Manual, absent a claim that wilful or wanton conduct by RAAR 
or IAR resulted in a violation of some legally cognizable interest. "
413,11," Because I find these  [**21] allegations sufficient to state plaintiffs' claim against Hall and RAAR, I need not address whether 
any of the other allegations against them also supports their claim. "
420,1," Although the complaint never explicitly identifies maintenance of large-frame SL machines as a relevant ""tying market,""  [*15] it 
repeatedly alleges that 3DS ""condition[ed] the sale and/or maintenance of its large-frame SL machines on the purchase of its 
own SL resins."" Am. Compl. PP 80, 90, 94."
420,2," The complaint suggests that there are at least a few third-party maintenance contractors who could provide service to Viper Pro 
owners independent of 3DS. While one such contractor has allegedly agreed with 3DS not to provide service to Viper Pro 
owners who use Desotech resins, the court is unable to assess a maintenance/resin tying claim absent further factual detail 
about the market for SL machine service."
420,3," Although 3DS submitted along with its motion to dismiss a copy of the memorandum of understanding, the court finds 
Desotech's allegations inadequate even without consideration of the submitted exhibit and, therefore, will not consider it at this 
time."
420,4," In its response  [*17] brief, Desotech asserts that the complaint alleges that ""AP Proto, Lockheed and Tangible Express were 
required to purchase their resins exclusively from 3DS as a condition to buying their Viper Pro machines."" Pl.'s Resp. at 14 
(emphasis in original). Desotech did not, however, include such an assertion in its amended complaint. Furthermore, even if that 
language had been included in the amended complaint, it is not clear that such a ""conclusory allegation,"" without more factual 
specificity as to each of the three customers, would be sufficient under Twombly, 127 S. Ct. at 1966. "
421,5," According to the complaint, 3DS has stopped manufacturing its older lines of SL machines, including the SLA 500. "
422,6," Whereas the Seventh Circuit has long been comfortable defining monopoly power in simple terms--e.g., ""power over price"" or 
""the ability to cut back the market's total output and so raise prices,"" Indiana Grocery, 864 F.2d at 1414--it commented in a 
recent opinion that ""'market power' is key, but its meaning requires elucidation."" Sheridan v. Marathon Petroleum Co. LLC, 530 
F.3d 590, 594 (7th Cir. 2008). "
433,1," Profits need not be actually ""solely"" expected from the efforts of a third party in the literal sense, but the ""efforts made by those 
other than the investor [must be] the undeniably significant ones, those essential managerial efforts which affect the failure or 
success of the enterprise."" Hocking, 885 F.2d at 1455. "
435,2," References to ""enterprise"" in ยงยง 1962(a) and (b) are aimed not at the overarching ""associated-in-fact"" enterprise through which 
the pattern of racketeering is perpetrated, but a different enterprise which can be said to be the victim of the racketeering. Nat'l 
Org. For Women v. Scheidler, 510 U.S. 249, 257-59, 114 S. Ct. 798, 127 L. Ed. 2d 99 (1994). For instance, ยง1962(a) makes it 
illegal for ""any person"" to ""invest . . . any part of such income [derived from racketeering activities] . . . in acquisition of any 
interest in, or the establishment or operation of, any enterprise [engaged in interstate commerce."" Similarly, ยง 1962(b) reads ""It 
shall be unlawful for any person [engaged in racketeering activity] to acquire or maintain [] any interest [] or control of any 
enterprise [engaged in interstate commerce."" "
436,3," Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint references as many as nine Idaho corporations or limited liability companies wholly owned 
by one or both of the Callies, which they allege constituted an ""enterprise"" for the purposes of RICO. (First Amended Complaint 
at 24-27.)"
436,4," In another contextโfederal antitrust lawโthe Supreme Court has stated exactly the opposite: a wholly owned entity cannot 
conspire with its owner. Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 776, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628 "
437,," (1984). However, the Copperweld Court was careful to limit the decision to the peculiar context of the Sherman Act, clarifying 
that it was not addressing ""whether the term 'conspiracy' will bear a literal construction that includes parent corporations and 
their wholly owned subsidiaries."" Id. Additionally, many circuit courts have stated that neither a corporation nor its officers or employees can conspire in the context 
of a 42 U.S.C. ยง 1985 civil rights conspiracy cases unless the employees act in their individual capacities or outside the scope of 
their employment. See Portman v. County of Santa Clara, 995 F.2d 898, 910 (9th Cir. 1993) (collecting cases from eight circuits 
applying the so-called ""intracorporate conspiracy doctrine""). However, the Ninth Circuit has never so ruled, instead reserving the 
issue. Id.; United States v. Hughes Aircraft Co., 20 F.3d 974, 979 (9th Cir. 1994). "
438,5," Plaintiffs attempt to apply Idaho Code ยง 30-6-902, which revises ยง 53-659. ยง 30-6-902 states that ""A member [of an L.L.C.] may 
maintain a derivative action to enforce a right of a limited liability company if: (1) The member first makes a demand on the other 
members . . . and the other members do not bring the action within a reasonable time; or (2) A demand under subsection (1) 
would be futile."" However, a subsequent section of the same chapter, ยง 30-6-1104 states that ยง 30-6-902 ""governs only . . . [a] 
limited liability company formed on or after July 1, 2008,"" and thus does not apply to Auroresky."
438,6," The Court notes that its research did not yield any published Idaho trial, appellate, or Supreme Court opinion applying the 
statute either. "
439,7," Because Idaho Code ยง 53-659 is dispositive, the Court need not address Defendants' diversity jurisdiction arguments. "
448,1," Federal  [**9] Circuit law governs this inquiry because the underlying merits of the action involve patent infringement. See 
Microchip Tech. Inc. v. The Chamberlain Group, Inc., 441 F.3d 936, 940 (Fed. Cir. 2006). "
458,1," Bayside and Expro are the remaining Plaintiffs. Two other initial plaintiffs (Weeks Marine, Inc. and Shipyard Supply, LLC) have 
voluntary dismissed their claims. [See D.E. 172.]"
458,2," Marine Hose is a flexible rubber hose used primarily to transport oil between ships, terminals, buoys and tanks."
458,3," Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides, in pertinent part, that ""every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or 
conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."" 15 
U.S.C. ยง 1."
458,4," The allegations at issue in the First Amended Complaint were also the subject of separately filed criminal complaints against 
numerous corporations and individuals as further discussed herein."
458,5," The following Defendants answered the First Amended Complaint: Yokohama Rubber Co. Ltd. [D.E. 197], Misao Hioki [D.E. 
212], Bridgestone Corporation [D.E. 214] and Jacques Cognard [D.E. 207]. The record also reveals that the Manuli Defendants "
459,," also filed answers to the First Amended Complaint [see D.E. 200 and 201], but later joined in the instant motion to dismiss on 
jurisdictional grounds [D.E. 242]."
459,6," Because certain entities were served later in the litigation and have only recently filed their pleadings, the motions to dismiss by 
certain Defendants are not yet ripe. The record also reveals that Defendants Peter Whittle and PW Consulting have failed to 
answer or otherwise respond while Defendant Uwe Bangert has yet to be served. [See D.E. 340.]"
459,7," Defendants have largely joined in each others motions and many raise substantially the same issues, which the Court will 
address in turn."
459,8," In addition to the Manuli Defendants, the Motion to Dismiss [D.E. 242] initially included Defendants Parker Hannifin 
Corporation, Parker S.r.l and Giovanni Scodeggio (collectively, the ""Parker Defendants""). Significantly, however, the Parker 
Defendants executed a settlement agreement with Plaintiffs and withdrew from the motion to dismiss. [See D.E. 296.] 
Consequently, the Court's ruling herein is inapplicable to the Parker Defendants. The record also reflects that other Defendants filed notices of adopting the motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter 
jurisdiction, including Defendants Scaglia, Northcutt and Furness (the ""Adopting Defendants""). Consequently, for ease of 
reference, the discussion refers to the Manuli Defendants, but also includes the Adopting Defendants as noted herein. "
460,9," At this juncture of the litigation, the Court stresses that it does not purport to make conclusive factual findings on the merits. 
Rather, the factual discussion herein is made to the extent necessary for purposes of the Court's jurisdictional analysis and to 
evaluate the motions to dismiss."
460,10," The FTAIA expressly states: Section 1 to 7 of this title shall not apply to conduct involving trade or commerce (other than import trade or import commerce) 
with foreign nations unless - (1) such conduct has a direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect - (A) on trade or commerce which is not trade or commerce with foreign nations, or on import trade or import 
commerce [*15]  with foreign nations; or (B) on export trade or expert commerce with foreign nations, of a person engaged in such trade or commerce in the United 
States; and (2) such effect gives rise to a claim under the provision of sections 1 to 7 of this title, other than this section. If sections 1 to 7 of this title apply to such conduct only because of the operation of paragraph (1)(b), then sections 1 to 7 of this 
title shall apply to such conduct only for injury to export business in the United States."

461,11," Bayside's claims are not challenged under the FTAIA. Notably, Bayside is an Alabama corporation with its principal place of 
business in Mobile, Alabama. [See D.E. 180 ยถ 9.]"
461,12," Plaintiff filed their response under seal although the Manuli Defendants maintain that the motion need not remain under seal. 
[See D.E. 242 at 1 n1.] Consequently, the references herein are to docket entry 257 which will be unsealed within ten (10) days 
of this Order unless the parties otherwise advise. "
462,13," Plaintiffs do not argue the exception under section 6a(1)(A) (concerning domestic import trade or import commerce) and the 
Court finds no basis to consider section 6a(1)(A) applicable to the facts of this case."
462,14," While it is possible for an exporter of services to meet the export trade exception, see e.g., Access Telecom, Inc. v. MCI 
Telecomms. Corp., 197 F.3d 694, 712 (5th Cir. 1999) (concluding that claims of exporter of telecommunications were not barred 
by FTAIA), this case is not about exporting services. See also Emag Sols., LLC v. Toda Kogyo Corp., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
44512, 2005 WL 1712084, *11 (N.D. Cal. 2005) (granting a motion to dismiss antitrust claims where plaintiffs failed to allege that 
foreign plaintiffs were American export competitors). "
464,15," Mr. Gatlin also states that although he has attempted to locate invoices for the purchases, he has been unable to do so and 
that in the normal course of business, invoices from the mid-to-late 1980's were not retained by Bayside. [See D.E. 257 at Exh. 
B.]"
464,16," While a trier of fact may later conclude otherwise with respect to Mr. Gatlin's statements, at this stage of the litigation, this 
Court has no reason to doubt Mr. Gatlin's submissions and declines to do so solely because Bayside has been unable to locate 
invoices for transactions going back more than twenty years."
464,17," The Manuli Defendants alternatively move for summary judgment on Bayside's claims. [See D.E. 242 at 17 n.6.] Because the 
Court finds that Bayside has satisfied standing for purposes of the motion to dismiss, the Court declines to reach the summary 
judgment arguments."
464,18," Bayside is the sole remaining Plaintiff. Notably, however, Plaintiffs have separately filed a motion for class certification under 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 that may impact the ultimate number of plaintiffs in this action. The Court will separately 
dispose of that motion in due course."
464,19," Defendant Scaglia also joined in the Manuli Defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction [D.E. 243], 
which was disposed of in Section A of this Order."
464,20," According to Defendant Scaglia, although initially arrested in Houston, Texas, he was ordered to appear in this District for 
proceedings in the antitrust criminal prosecution. [See D.E. 7.] "
465,21," Having found Defendant Scaglia was properly served via personal service under Florida statute section 48.031, the Court 
concludes that it has obtained personal jurisdiction over him. Campo, 704 So.2d at 732. Consequently, the Court need reach the 
alternative arguments concerning jurisdiction pursuant to Florida's long arm statute, section 48.193. [See D.E. 98 at 10-12 and 
D.E. 114 at 7-12.]"
465,22," Plaintiffs also allege that Defendant Scaglia was criminally charged with conspiring to suppress and eliminate competition for 
Marine Hose in the United States. [See D.E. 77]. The Court finds that a general allegation of a criminal indictment without 
underlying details as to the specific acts purported taken by the Defendant is of no consequence to the sufficiency of the 
complaint. "
466,23," Defendant Northcutt also joined in the Manuli Defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction [D.E. 297], 
which was disposed of in Section A of this Order. The record also indicates that Defendant Northcutt incorporated by reference 
the arguments of other Defendants seeking dismissal on various grounds. [See D.E. 106-109, 297.] To the extent not addressed 
in this section, the relevant issues are disposed of as discussed in connection with other Defendants in this action."
466,24," According to the notice of supplemental authority [D.E. 267], Defendant Northcutt was found not guilty in the antitrust criminal 
proceedings, Case No. 07-60220-CR-HURLEY (S.D.Fla. Nov. 10, 2008)."
466,25," Defendant Northcutt is alleged to be an ""executive at Defendant Manuli Rubber Industries,"" [D.E. 180 ยถ 38] who was indicted 
by the government and charged with conspiring to suppress and eliminate competition for Marine Hose in the United States 
[D.E. 180 ยถ 77]."
466,26," Plaintiffs specifically allege, inter alia, that the Defendants did the following: (i) in 1999, authorized and directed PW Consulting 
and Whittle to coordinate the Defendants' conspiratorial activities, paying them approximately $300,000 [D.E. 180 ยถ 58]; (ii) 
devised code names to conceal their involvement in the conspiracy . . .referring to the cartel as ""the club or the ""Technical 
Committee-Marine Hose"" and (iii) held meetings in June 2000 (Key Largo), December 2000 (Bangkok), July 2002 (London) and 
May 2007 (Houston, Tx). "
467,27," In opposing the Comital Defendants motion to dismiss, discussed infra in section G, Plaintiffs attempt to distinguish the ruling 
in In re TFT-LCD (Flat Panel) Antitrust Litig., 586 F. Supp. 2d 1109, 2008 WL 3916309, *4 (N.D. Cal. 2008) as against the weight 
of authority [see D.E. 322 at 7-8]. Because the standard for antitrust pleadings at the motion to dismiss stage is still developing, 
the Court does not find the In re TFT-LCD decision entirely off the mark and, on the facts of this case, finds it persuasive."
467,28," Defendant Furness also joined in the Manuli Defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction [D.E. 298], 
which was disposed of in Section A of this Order. Defendant Furness also incorporates by reference the arguments raised by 
other defendants. [See D.E. 219 at 3 and D.E. 298.] To the extent not addressed in this section, the relevant issues are disposed 
of as discussed in connection with the motions of other Defendants."
467,29," Although the First Amended Complaint is misnumbered, paragraph 83 refers to that appearing on page 17 of docket entry 
180."
467,30," Defendant Gillespie also joined in the Manuli Defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction [D.E. 262 at 
2], which was disposed of in Section A of this Order. "
468,31," The Settling Defendants include the following: (i) Dunlop Oil & Marine, Ltd., Bryan Allison and David Brammar; (ii) Trelleborg 
Industries S.A. and Jacques Cognard; (iii) The Yokohama Rubber Co, Ltd.; (iv) Parker ITR S.R.L., Parker Hannifin and Giovanni 
Scodeggio; and (v) Bridgestone Corporation, Bridgestone Industrial Products America and Misao Hioki. [See D.E. 319.] "
478,1," The Rule 12(b)(6) ""plausibility standard"" established in Twombly unquestionably applies to plaintiff's antitrust claims, since that 
was the legal context from which the standard arose. However, the courts are not universal in accepting the Twombly standard 
for cases that do not involve antitrust claims. See Total Benefits Planning Agency, Inc. v. Anthem BCBS, No. 07-4115, 
December 22, 2008, 552 F.3d 430, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 25810, * 8-9 n.2 (also citing Note, Much Ado About Twombly, 83 
NOTRE DAME L. REV. 1811 (2008)).  [**8] Regardless, the Court does not find that any distinction would alter the disposition 
with respect to any particular claim in this case. "
479,2, There appears to be no dispute that CAA is classified as a municipality/local government entity. 
481,3," Riverview Invs., Inc. v. Ottawa Cmty. Improvement Corp., 769 F.2d 324 (6th Cir. 1985) (""Riverview I""); Riverview Invs., Inc. v. 
Ottawa Cmty. Improvement Corp., 774 F.2d 162 (6th Cir. 1985) (""Riverview II""); Riverview Invs., Inc. v. Ottawa Cmty. 
Improvement Corp., 899 F.2d 474 (6th Cir. 1990) (""Riverview III""). "
484,4," Plaintiff also alleges violations of the Clayton Act. ""The Clayton Act proscribes certain specific activities in commerce and also 
provides for private enforcement of the federal antitrust laws."" 17 MCQUILLIN MUN. CORP. ยง 49:97 (3rd ed.) (footnote omitted). 
Because plaintiff's substantive claims fall under the prohibitions of the Sherman Act, the parties' arguments and the Court's 
analysis are directed to the Sherman Act."
484,5," For purposes of the Motions to Dismiss, the Court accepts defendant SMG's statement of the general elements of claims under 
ยง 1 and ยง 2 of the Sherman Act. However, the Court recognizes that the precise showing required to prove a claim under these 
sections may ultimately depend on the specific nature and category of the antitrust claim. See, e.g., J.B.D.L. Corp. v. Wyeth-
Ayerst Labs., Inc., 485 F.3d 880, 887 (6th Cir. 2007) (referring to antitrust law specific to the Sixth Circuit); see also HOLMES, 
supra, ยง 2:2, pp. 104-05 and ยง 3:2, pp. 402-03 (identifying and differentiating categories of antitrust claims). "
493,1," We note that two district courts in our Circuit have found class action waivers in mandatory arbitration clauses to be 
enforceable. In Sherr v. Dell, Inc, No. 05cv10097, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51864, 2006 WL 2109436 (S.D.N.Y. July 27, 2006), a 
consumer brought a putative class action suit against Dell alleging that certain of the latter's products had a dangerous tendency 
to overheat. The plaintiff asserted claims under the statutory and common law of New York. 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51864, [WL] 
at *1. Dell moved to compel arbitration and for the enforcement of a class action waiver contained in its sales contract, the terms 
of which were not even available to the consumer before purchase short of his calling a special telephone number or visiting a 
Dell internet site. Id. The district court granted the motion to compel, holding that the ""plaintiff is not entitled to a class action suit 
or class-wide arbitration to vindicate the rights of everyone else with a similar problem. The [Federal Arbitration Act's] primary 
purpose is not to create a right to sue as a class. Its main purpose is to ensure that private agreements to arbitrate are enforced 
according to their terms."" 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51864, [WL] at *7 (quotation marks omitted). The case  [**5] was decided 
according to the law of Texas, which, the district court found, had incorporated the Federal Arbitration Act as part of its 
substantive law. Id. Dumanis v. Citibank (South Dakota), N.A., No. 07cv6070, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81586, 2007 WL 3253975 (W.D.N.Y. Nov. 2, 
2007), was an action involving credit card interest rates brought under the federal Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 1601 et 
seq., and the New York General Business Law. The contract at issue had a South Dakota choice of law clause, and the decision 
was based upon the law of that state, not the federal law of arbitration. 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81586, [WL] at *2-*3. The district 
court enforced the class action waiver contained in the contract's mandatory arbitration clause, both because the plaintiff could 
have ""opt[ed] out"" of the arbitration clause by not renewing his credit card and because the plaintiff had not been stripped of any 
substantive remedies; he merely could not pursue them ""in the arguably more-favorable context of a class action."" Id. We note that in neither Sherr nor Dumanis does it appear that the plaintiff made a substantial demonstration -- which we hold 
that the plaintiffs have made here -- to the effect that an inability to pursue arbitration on a  [**6] class basis would be tantamount 
to an inability to assert their claims at all."
493,2," Two commentators have suggested that this is particularly so in the credit card industry: ""Credit card companies have shown 
themselves to be even less enthusiastic about classwide arbitration than about class action litigation. The 'devil you know' 
phenomenon is compounded by the uncertainty of judicial review of class certification in arbitration and the concomitant fear of a 
'renegade arbitrator' certifying a class and exposing a company to massive liability."" Samuel Issacharoff & Erin F. Delaney, 
""Credit Card Accountability,"" 73 U. Chi. L. Rev. 157, 179 (2006). "
494,3," Interestingly, when it enacted the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, Congress itself found both utility and danger in the use of 
the class action device. Compare Pub. L. No. 109-2, ยง 2(a)(1), 119 Stat. 4 (2005) (""Class action lawsuits are an important and 
valuable part of the legal system when they permit the fair and efficient resolution of legitimate claims  [**10] of numerous parties 
by allowing the claims to be aggregated . . . ."") with id. at ยง 2(a)(2) (""Over the past decade, there have been abuses of the class 
action device that have -- (A) harmed class members with legitimate claims and defendants that have acted responsibly; (B) 
adversely affected interstate commerce; and (C) undermined public respect for our judicial system.""). "
495,4," Amex confirmed at oral argument that this $ 10 million figure relates to purchases made with Amex products, not to purchases 
made by credit cards generally. "
496,5," The plaintiffs make no challenge to this preemption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure by the rules of the various 
arbitration firms listed in the Card Acceptance Agreement. We note, however, that some commentators have argued that 
plaintiffs are placed at a distinct disadvantage by class arbitration rules of these firms. See Daniel R. Higginbotham, ""Buyer 
Beware: Why the Class Arbitration Waiver Clause Presents a Gloomy Future for Consumers,"" 58 Duke L.J. 103, 123 (2008) 
(""Regarding many important issues . . . the rules [of arbitration firms] are either silent or diverge significantly from the Federal 
Rules of Civil Procedure, raising serious questions as to the ability of class arbitration to adequately resolve disputes.""). "
497,6," In a definition that has become classic, the Supreme Court has defined a tying arrangement as ""an agreement by a party to sell 
one product but only on the condition that the buyer also purchases a different (or tied) product, or at least agrees that he will not 
purchase that product from any other supplier."" Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5-6, 78 S. Ct. 514, 2 L. Ed. 
2d 545 (1958). A tying arrangement will violate Section 1 of the Sherman Act if ""the seller has appreciable economic power in 
the tying product market and if the arrangement affects a substantial volume of commerce in the tied market."" Eastman Kodak 
Co. v. Image Technical Servs., 504 U.S. 451, 462, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). "
499,7," It is apparent that ""[c]lass arbitration is a swiftly growing phenomenon. In late 2003, the American Arbitration Association 
(""AAA"") introduced procedures for class arbitrations . . . . As of September 27, 2007, the AAA was administering more than 190 
class arbitrations, and from July 10, 2006 until September 27, 2007 alone, the number of AAA-administered class arbitrations 
increased by more than 50%."" David S. Clancy & Matthew M.K. Stein, ""An Uninvited Guest: Class Arbitration and the Federal 
Arbitration Act's Legislative History,"" 63 Bus. Law. 55, 56 (2007). Clancy and Stein  [**28] go on to argue that when Congress 
passed the Federal Arbitration Act, in 1925, it specifically envisioned arbitration as ""something inherently prompt, inexpensive, 
and streamlined,"" and ""did not expect that arbitrators would adjudicate anything like the modern class action . . . ."" Id. at 61, 67. 
Although the argument that class proceedings in arbitration are incompatible with the Federal Arbitration Act is an intriguing one, 
we are presented with no such argument on this appeal."
499,8," The principle was limited by the Court itself in Hall Street which held that parties are not free to compose arbitration 
agreements which provide for a greater scope of federal court review of arbitral awards than that set forth in the Federal 
Arbitration Act (""FAA""), 9 U.S.C. ยง 1 et seq, because this would be at odds with the FAA's ""substantiat[ion of] a national policy 
favoring arbitration with just the limited review needed to maintain arbitration's essential virtue of resolving disputes 
straightaway."" 128 S. Ct. at 1405. "
500,9," The plaintiffs' challenge to the enforceability of the class action waiver is distinct from any contention to the effect that Amex's 
alleged tying arrangement renders the entire Card Acceptance Agreement invalid. See Amex Brief at 49. The latter issue is not 
before us."
500,10," In Green Tree Financial Corp. v. Bazzle, 539 U.S. 444, 123 S. Ct. 2402, 156 L. Ed. 2d 414 (2003), the Supreme Court was 
faced with an arbitration agreement which was ambiguous as to whether it permitted arbitration proceedings to be conducted on 
a class basis. The Court concluded that this was a matter of contract interpretation which ""should be for the arbitrator, not the 
courts, to decide."" Id. at 453. Here, we do not face an issue of contract interpretation; the Card Acceptance Agreement is 
unambiguous in forbidding arbitration to proceed on a class basis. "
503,11," HN7[
] ""We review . . . mixed questions of law and fact either de novo or under the clearly erroneous standard depending on 
whether the question is predominantly legal or factual."" United States v. Selioutsky, 409 F.3d 114, 119 (2d Cir. 2005) 
 [**45] (internal citations omitted). The plaintiffs' estimated expert witness fees were essentially undisputed. We review de novo 
the district court's application of the Clayton Act to undisputed facts. See Village of Grand View v. Skinner, 947 F.2d 651, 656 
(2d Cir. 1991) (""Because the issues presented on this appeal involve the application of a statutory standard to undisputed facts, 
the appropriate standard of review is de novo.""). We note, however, that our ruling would not be different under a clearly 
erroneous standard. "
505,12," Quoting Paschall v. Kansas City Star Co., 695 F.2d 322, 338-39 (8 Cir. 1982), Amex suggests that if an expert's findings prove 
""to be so 'crucial' and 'indispensable' that an arbitrator determines that the case absolutely could not have been pursued without 
them, the arbitrator might award such costs."" Amex Brief at 28 We are skeptical, however, that an arbitrator might follow 
Paschall because it appears unlikely that its holding survives Crawford Fitting Co. See Gilbert v. City of Little Rock, Ark., 709 F. 
Supp. 856, 862 (E.D. Ark. 1987)  [**52] (holding that Paschall is inconsistent with the holding of Crawford Fitting to the effect that 
expert witness fees are to be determined solely in accordance with 28 U.S.C. ยง 1821(b))."
505,13," The plaintiffs' counsel has submitted a detailed affidavit which estimates that the cost of depositions and document 
management would exceed $ 300,000."
505,14," One of the amici makes the following suggestion: ""Whatever costs the Merchant Plaintiffs might ultimately bear in procuring 
expert testimony in this case, those costs may be offset by the cost savings of conducting an arbitration proceeding, rather than 
an all-out federal trial."" Brief of Business Roundtable at 16. But this misses the point. While it may be true that an individual 
arbitration brought by a plaintiff will likely cost less than a trial in federal district court, the fact remains that the plaintiffs have 
demonstrated to our satisfaction that neither an individual arbitration, nor an individual litigation would make any economic sense 
in  [**54] light of the likelihood that expert fees far in excess of any likely individual recovery would need to be expended in either 
action. "
507,15," We note that the Fourth Circuit, in In re Cotton Yarn Antitrust Litigation, has upheld the enforcement in an antitrust action of a 
collective action ban contained in a contract between commercial parties. The case presented a claim of antitrust conspiracy, 
and the court pointed out that a bar upon joining the two defendants, who were jointly and severally liable, did not preclude the 
arbitrability of the claim because ""co-conspirators are not necessary parties; a plaintiff can prove the existence of a conspiracy in 
an action against just one of the members of the conspiracy."" 505 F.3d at 284. The court also noted ""[t]he absence of an 
evidentiary record on . . . the actual cost of individual proceedings and . . . about the ability of the corporate plaintiffs to bear 
those speculative costs."" Id. at 285. Again, such a record exists in the instant case. "
514,1," HN1[
] The Court accepts the truthfulness of facts properly alleged by a plaintiff when considering a defendant's motion to 
dismiss. Gantler v. Stephens, 965 A.2d 695, 2009 Del. LEXIS 33, 2009 WL 188828, at *5 (Del. Jan. 27, 2009). These facts are 
as alleged in the Plaintiff's Amended Complaint."

that induced BAE to enter into the Transaction. See BAE's Answering Br. at 23, 47. BAE, although not bringing a claim based on 
that representation, has suggested that Lockheed has waived, or is estopped from, arguing that the MOA is too vague to be 
enforced. Id. at 23-24. Waiver and estoppel are truly not responsive to Lockheed's indefiniteness argument. Even if Lockheed 
may fully and fairly be charged with the consequences of both waiver and estoppel, that would not resolve BAE's dilemma if the 
MOA is indefinite. If the MOA is indefinite and, thus, no one can figure out the contractual duty that it imposed on Lockheed, then 
there is nothing for the Court to enforce. Waiver and estoppel, wonderful doctrines that they may be, cannot fill the void resulting 
from the absence of a definitive contractual undertaking."

Class Certification be granted and the following  [*20] Class certified: All persons or entities who have purchased K-Dur 20 directly from Schering at any time during the period November 20, 
1998, through September 1, 2001. Excluded from the proposed class shall be: Defendants and their officers, directors, management and employees, subsidiaries and affiliates, as well as federal 
government entities. Also excluded are persons or entities who have not purchased generic versions of K-Dur 20 after the 
introduction of generic versions of K-Dur 20. (April 14 R&R, Doc. No. 636). On December 30, 2008, Judge Greenaway overruled the objections of Defendants and DP 
Plaintiffs to the April 14 R&R and adopted the R&R as the opinion of the Court. (Dec. 30, 2008 Order, Doc. No. 731)."
554,10," On January 24, 2005, Judge Greenaway granted final approval of a settlement between DP Plaintiffs and Wyeth. (Jan. 24, 
2005 Order, Doc. No. 226). As part of the settlement, DP Plaintiffs agreed to the release and dismissal with prejudice of all 
claims against Wyeth and its related entities, including ESI. (DPP/Wyeth Settlement Agreement, Doc. 170-3)."
554,11," In the interest of brevity, the record citations herein regarding the factual background refer to the parties' statements filed 
pursuant to Local Rule 56.1 and, unless necessary, do not separately identify each exhibit cited by the parties in their statements 
of fact. In addition, because the DPP Upsher Facts and the DPP ESI Facts restate each paragraph of Defendants' Upsher Facts 
and EST Facts, it is not necessary to cite separately to Defendants' Upsher Facts and ESI Facts. "
556,12," Upsher's  [*28] Patent Certification Notice also stated that ""the KLOR-CON(c) M product does not contain magnesium stearate 
of polyvinylpyrolidone."" (Id. at 9). "
557,13," The five other Upsher products were KLOR CON(c) 8, KLOR CON(c) 10, KLOR CON(c) M20, PREVALITE(c), and 
Pentoxifylline. (Upsher Mem., Ex. 61 (June 17 Agreement) at PP 7-10)."
557,14," The Agreement also provided for milestone  [*32] and royalty payments contingent upon Schering's sales of Niacor-SR(c). 
Subsequent to the June 17 Agreement, Schering decided not to pursue the Niacor-SR(c) opportunity, and Schering never 
marketed the drug. However, the facts regarding the reasons for Schering's decision are disputed. (DPP Am. Compl., P 74; 
Schering Ans. to Am. Compl., P 74). "
558,15," In their Statement of Disputed Facts, DP Plaintiffs have asserted that certain of the statements cited in Defendants' Statement 
of Facts regarding the ESI Settlement are inadmissible hearsay. In this regard, I note that hearsay statements may be 
considered on summary judgment if the statements are capable of being admissible at trial. Shelton v. Univ. of Med. & Dentistry, 
223 F.3d 220, 223 n.2 (3d Cir. 2000). Moreover, to the extent that the statements are offered not to show the truth of the matter 
asserted, but to demonstrate their effect on the listener, they may be admissible. See Marks v. Marina, 213 Fed. Appx. 147, 
2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 479, at *10-11 (3d Cir. Jan. 10, 2007) (court properly admitted evidence offered not for its truth, but to 
show the effect on the listener); Faulkner v. Super Valu Stores, Inc., 3 F.3d 1419, 1434 (10th Cir. 1993) (""statements offered for 
the effect on the listener [*37] . . . are generally not hearsay.""). "
559,16," The Agreement defined a ""Referencing Product"" as an ESI KCI Product, a potassium chloride product that is the subject of an 
ANDA or NDA that references a Key NDA, or a potassium chloride product marketed by ESI as equivalent to, or otherwise 
substitutable on a generic basis for, K-Dur. (ESI Mem., Ex. 24 (Settlement Agreement) at P 1.2). An ESI KCI Product was 
defined as the 20 Meq extended release potassium chloride tablet described in Key's ANDA. (Id.). "
560,17," Although the FTC found both the Upsher and ESI Agreements unlawful, it noted the limited evidence presented regarding the 
ESI settlement and stated that ""[a]s a matter of prosecutorial discretion, we might not have brought a stand-alone case based on 
such relatively limited evidence."" Schering-FTC, 2003 FTC LEXIS 187, at *166. "
563,18," The opinion in Tamoxifen II amended and superseded In re Tamoxifen Citrate Antitrust Litig., 429 F.3d 370 (2d Cir. 2005) 
(""Tamoxifen I""). Tamoxifen II predominantly made changes and corrections to the citations in the Tamoxifen I opinion, but did not 
modify the court's analysis or holding. "
565,19," Abbott had multiple patents relating to terazosin hydrochloride, the active ingredient in Hytrin. Id. The patents covered various 
forms of the terazosin hydrochloride compound and methods for using it. Id."
565,20," On remand, the district court still applied a per  [*62] se analysis and found the agreements at issue in Valley Drug to be per 
se illegal. See In re Terazosin Hydrochloride Antitrust Litig., 352 F. Supp. 2d 1279 (S.D. Fla. 2005). However, in its subsequent 
decision in Schering, the Eleventh Circuit found the agreements in Valley Drug to be ""wholly different"" from the Upsher and ESI 
Agreements. Schering, 402 F.3d at 1066, n.14. The court noted that the ""critical difference"" is that the agreements in Valley Drug 
did not involve final settlements of the patent litigation, and did not permit the generic company to market its product before 
patent expiration. Id. "
566,21," The Eleventh Circuit also rejected the FTC's conclusion that the Niacor license was not worth $ 60 million, but was a payment 
to keep Upsher off the market, and stated that the FTC's conclusion was ""not supported by law or logic."" Id. at 1070. "
567,22," Zeneca refers collectively to Imperial Chemical Industries, PLC (""ICI"") and its former subsidiaries, Zeneca, Inc., AstraZeneca 
Pharmaceuticals LP, and Astra Zeneca PLC, which succeeded to ICI's rights to the patent at issue. Tamoxifen II, 466 F.3d at 
190, 193."
567,23," The case was before the Second Circuit on plaintiffs' appeal of the district court's dismissal of their antitrust claims pursuant to 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Id. "
571,24," As Judge Greenaway noted, his opinion addressed a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss and was decided under the framework 
of that rule, which treats all of Plaintiffs' allegations as true and draws all inferences in Plaintiffs' favor. Id. at 527 (noting that 
Plaintiffs' alleged that but for the reverse payments, Upsher and ESI would have settled on different terms and entered the 
market sooner); 528 (noting the standard for 12(b)(6) and 12(c) motions); 529 (noting that there is no heightened pleading 
standard in antitrust cases); 533 (stating that Plaintiffs had sufficiently pled anti-competitive conduct and noting that, at pleading 
stage, court must consider defendants' pro-competitive justifications as unproven). "
572,25," Contrary to DP Plaintiffs' argument, Judge Greenaway did not decide that the terms of the Upsher and ESI Settlements 
exceeded the exclusionary scope of Schering's patent. Rather, he merely concluded that Plaintiffs had alleged that the 
settlement agreements exceeded the scope of the patent. In re K-Dur, 338 F. Supp. 2d at 532."
572,26," The record in Schering included the ALJ's factual finding that the quoted language was included in the settlement so that 
""Upsher-Smith could continue to market its Klor Con 8 and Klor Con 10 wax matrix tablets without any restrictions,"" and because 
""Schering wanted to prevent Uphser-Smith from simply renaming its Klor Con M 20 product to get around the language and 
intent of the settlement agreement."" Schering-ALJ, 2002 FTC LEXIS 40, at *62-63 (P 158). The ALJ found that ""no other 
restrictions on any of Uphser-Smith's  [*90] other products were intended by the settlement agreements."" Id. "
573,27, DP Plaintiffs do not contend that Schering's '743 Patent was procured by fraud on the PTO. 
578,1," The parties have stipulated to the dismissal of claims relating to the two patents owned by Albion. (D.I. 69 at 41). Indeed, 
Lannett struck all references to the '925 and '814 patents in its proposed Second Amended Complaint (D.I. 77, Ex. A ยถยถ 23). 
Therefore, KV's motion to dismiss claims relating to these patents is moot. "
580,2," I disagree with Lannett's argument that the Second Amended Complaint is currently under the Court's consideration, and as a 
consequence, that there is a live controversy between the parties because KV had asserted counterclaims by the time that it 
filed the Second Amended Complaint (D.I. 98 at 3-4) (citing Prasco). In Prasco, the Federal Circuit explained that the district 
court accepted the declaratory judgment plaintiff's Amended Complaint. 537 F.3d at 1337. Here, the Court has not accepted the 
Second Amended Complaint. The Second Amended Complaint is merely an exhibit to a motion for leave to file. Moreover, while "
581,," Rule 15(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows supplemental pleadings to cure defects in the original pleadings, the 
Second Amended Complaint does not supplement the pleadings with regard to jurisdiction โ Latnnett fails to plead the filing of 
the counterclaim. The Second Amended Complaint still claims that ""Where is a reasonable likelihood that the KV Defendants will 
assert a claim for patent infringement against Lannett once its product, Multivitamin With Mineral Capsules, enters the 
marketplace."" (DI 77, Ex. A ยถ11) (emphasis added). Thus, Lannett did not ""mislabel"" its amended complaint. Prasco, 537 F.3d at 
1337 (explaining that ""[p]arties and courts occasionally confuse supplemental pleadings with amended pleadings and 
mislabeling is common.""). The amended complaint is not actually a supplemental complaint, at least with regard to the 
infringement, invalidity, inequitable conduct, antitrust and unfair trade practices claims. But even if Lannett had actually 
supplemented the Amended Complaint, it is within the Court's discretion to decide whether to allow the supplemental pleading. 
Prasco, 537 F.3d at 1337 at n.5. I decline to recommend the exercise of such discretion. Lannett has a remedy to obtain 
adjudication on the patents asserted in this suitโKV's counterclaim. Accordingly, the Amended Complaint is the proper 
complaint under consideration on Lannett's invalidity, non-infringement and inequitable conduct claims."
581,3," Lannett cites Micron Tech., Inc. v. Mosaid Techs., Inc., 518 F.3d 897, 901-02 (Fed. Cir. 2008) for the proposition that ""evidence 
that the declaratory judgment defendant would sue the declaratory judgment plaintiff soon"" creates a case or controversy (D.1. 
69 at 9). There is no quarrel with that statement, which is wholly consistent with the cases requiring an affirmative act by the 
patentee in order to establish the necessary controversy for declaratory judgment jurisdiction. However, the affirmative acts by 
the patentee in Micron (a warning letter strongly suggesting that the plaintiff should license patentee's technology, and three 
follow-up letters) occurred prior to the filing of the complaint, unlike the counterclaim filed by KV here."
581,4," According to Lannett, KV's public statement that it would vigorously enforce its patents was issued on the same day that 
Lannett filed the Amended Complaint, and KV's similar statement to its customers was made ""at or about th[e] same time."" (D.I. "
582,82," ). These assertions are vague about the actual timing of KV's alleged statements, and thus do not satisfy Lannett's burden of 
proving that they were made prior to the filing of the Amended Complaint."
582,5," In granting KV's motion to strike Lannett's affirmative defenses of inequitable conduct regarding the '846 and '666 patents, I 
also dismissed without prejudice Lannett's request to file a second amended complaint, ""insofar as it seeks to add new claims of 
inequitable conduct with respect to the '846 and the '666 patents."" Had the jurisdictional issue been presented at that time, I may 
have recommended that the motion for leave to amend be denied with prejudice. "
583,6," Because Lannett cannot plead the minimum level of enforcement necessary to sustain a Walker Process claim, I need not 
address the other elements of the claim: whether KV's patents issued because it defrauded the PTO; enforcement of KV's 
patents harmed competition in the relevant market; and Lannett suffered antitrust damages. I address the monopolization issues 
for purposes of evaluating Lannett's other antitrust claim in Count Eleven."
583,7," Even if Lannett is bringing an attempted monopolization claim, as opposed to a monopolization claim, it must define a relevant 
market, which it has not done. Nor has Lannett pled any facts that KV has a ""dangerous probability"" of achieving monopoly 
power. Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan, 506 U.S. 447, 456, 113 S. Ct. 884, 122 L. Ed. 2d 247 (1993). "
584,8," ""[I]n most cases, proper market definition can be determined only after a factual inquiry into the commercial realities faced by 
consumers."" Queen City Pizza, Inc. v. Domino's Pizza, Inc., 124 F.3d 430, 436 (3d Cir. 1997) (citing Eastman Kodak Co. v. 
Image Technical Services, Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 482, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265, (1992)). However, there is no per se rule 
against dismissal for failure to define a relevant market under Rule 12(b)(6). Id. "
586,9," I note that Counts Six through Ten of the Second Amended Complaint allege supplemental facts that occurred after the 
Amended Complaint was filed. "
587,10," There is no common law tort of commercial disparagement in Delaware. Rather, it is subsumed by DTP A, and as discussed 
previously, Lannett does not state a DTPA claim."
587,11," Delaware law applies because Delaware has the most significant relationship to the instant action. ""The relevant factors a 
court must consider when determining the state with the most significant relationship to the action include 1) the place where the 
injury occurred, 2) the place where the conduct causing the injury occurred, 3) the place of incorporation and principal place of 
business of the parties, and 4) the place where the relationship between the parties is centered."" Corning Inc. v. SRU 
Biosystems, LLC, 292 F. Supp.2d 583, 585 (D. Del. 2003) (citing Restatement (Second) of Conflicts ยง 145 (1971)). Because 
Lannett filed this action in Delaware and both parties are incorporated in Delaware, I conclude for purposes of the pending 
motions that Delaware has the most significant relationship to the action. "
589,12, Counts Six through Ten of the Second Amended Complaint should be deemed counterclaims. 
590,13," Because the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the inequitable conduct claim related to the '609 patent, I need not 
reach the merits of that claim. Accordingly, Lannett's affirmative defense of inequitable conduct on that issue remains intact. "
591,14," Lannett has already taken eleven depositions, and has already been granted leave to take two more: that of Albion and 
Accucaps Industries, Ltd. "
592,15," Larmett also filed a motion to take an additional 30(b)(6) deposition, but at oral argument, Lannett stated that Dr. Bortz' 
deposition and the additional 30(b)(6) deposition ""could be combined."" (Transcript of Hearing on Jan. 21, 2009 at 96). 
Accordingly, Lannett's 30(b)(6) motion is denied as well. "
595,1," Section 5(2) provides that the Commission ""has the power to:"" ""(gg) Require additional insurance coverage and limitations by rule for certificate holders which coverages may not be less than 
those required by general law or by this act."" ""(jj) Fix or approve zones, rates, fares, and charges for public vehicles other than taxicabs."""
595,2," Section 5(a) provides that the Commission ""shall:"" ""(g) Perform the duties required by this action and any rules adopted in accordance with this act relating to the application for 
and approval, modification, or rejection of certificates, permits, and public vehicle drivers' licenses."" Section 7(2) sets for the requirements for an application for a certificate. "

Opposition to the ESI Motion (""DPP ESI Facts""), and the above-referenced 10/31/2008 letter brief."
613,4," In support of the Framework Motion, DPPs submitted an opening Memorandum of Law (accompanied by four exhibits) 
(""Framework Mem.""), a Statement of Undisputed Facts (""DPP Framework Facts""), and a Reply Brief (accompanied by two 
appendices with a total of two exhibits) (""Framework Reply""). In response, Defendants submitted a Brief in Opposition to the

613,5," In support of the '743 Motion, DPPs submitted an opening Memorandum of Law (accompanied by 15 exhibits (""'743 Mem.""), a 
Statement of Undisputed Facts (""DPP '743 Facts""), and a Reply Brief (accompanied  [*14] by two exhibits) (""'743 Reply""). In 
response, Defendants' submitted a Brief in Opposition to the '743 Motion accompanied by seven exhibits ('""743 Opp.""), and a 
Counterstatement of Material Facts a (""Def. '743 Facts""). "
614,6," The parties' summary judgment submissions include more than 400 pages of briefs and factual statements and a total of more 
than 400 exhibits. "
615,7," Prior to 2000, this was calculated from a ""final judgment from which no appeal can be or has been taken."" 21 C.F.R. ยง 
314.107(e)(1) (1999). Now, a district court decision is sufficient. Mylan Pharms., Inc. v. Shalala, 81 F. Supp. 2d. 30 (D.D.C. 
2000). Also, prior to 1998, FDA regulations had required that ANDA filers would not get the 180-day exclusivity unless they had 
successfully defended the patent infringement suit. See 59 Fed. Reg. 50,338,367 (Oct. 3, 1994). The ""successful defense"" 
requirement was subsequently found to be unreasonable, Mova Pharm. Corp. v. Shalala, 140 F.3d 1060, 1069-70, 329 U.S. 
App. D.C. 341 (D.D.C. 1998), and the FDA dropped the requirement in 1998. See 63 Fed. Reg. 59,710,711 (Nov. 5, 1998)."
615,8," The facts pertinent to the current motions are drawn primarily from the parties' pleadings and their respective statements filed 
pursuant to Local Rule 56.1 Unless otherwise indicated, the facts set forth below are not in dispute. "
616,9," On April 14, 2008, I issued a Report and Recommendation (the ""April 14 R&R"") recommending that DP Plaintiffs' Motion for 
Class Certification be granted and the following Class certified: All persons or entities who have purchased K-Dur 20 directly from Schering at any time during the period November 20, 
1998, through September 1, 2001. Excluded from the proposed class shall be: Defendants and their officers, directors, management and employees, subsidiaries and affiliates, as well as federal 
government entities. Also excluded are persons or entities who have not purchased generic versions of K-Dur 20 after the 
introduction of generic versions of K-Dur 20. (April 14 R&R, Doc. No. 636). On December 30, 2008, Judge Greenaway overruled the objections of Defendants and DP 
Plaintiffs to the April 14 R&R and adopted the R&R as the opinion of the Court. (Dec. 30, 2008 Order,  [*23] Doc. No. 731)."
616,10," On January 24, 2005, Judge Greenaway granted final approval of a settlement between DP Plaintiffs and Wyeth. (Jan. 24, 
2005 Order, Doc. No. 226). As part of the settlement, DP Plaintiffs agreed to the release and dismissal with prejudice of all 
claims against Wyeth and its related entities, including ESI. (DPP/Wyeth Settlement Agreement, Doc. 170-3)."
616,11," In the interest of brevity, the record citations herein regarding the factual background refer to the parties' statements filed 
pursuant to Local Rule 56.1 and, unless necessary, do not separately identify each exhibit cited by the parties in their statements 
of fact. In addition, because the DPP Upsher Facts and the DPP ESI Facts restate each paragraph of Defendants' Upsher Facts 
and ESI Facts, it is not necessary to cite separately to Defendants' Upsher Facts and ESI Facts. "
618,12," Upsher's Patent Certification Notice also stated that ""the KLOR-CON(c) M product does not contain magnesium stearate of 
polyvinylpyrolidone."" (Id. at 9). "
619,13," The five other Upsher products were KLOR CON(c) 8, KLOR CON(c) 10, KLOR CON(c) M20, PREVALITE(c), and 
Pentoxifylline. (Upsher Mem., Ex. 61 (June 17 Agreement) at PP 7-10)."
619,14," The Agreement also provided for milestone and royalty payments contingent upon Schering's sales of Niacor-SR(c). 
Subsequent to the June 17 Agreement, Schering decided not to pursue the Niacor-SR(c) opportunity, and Schering never 
marketed the drug. However, the facts regarding the reasons for Schering's decision are disputed. (DPP Am. Compl., P 74; 
Schering Ans. to Am. Compl., P 74). "
620,15," In their Statement of Disputed Facts, DP Plaintiffs have asserted that certain of the statements cited in Defendants' Statement 
of Facts regarding the ESI Settlement are inadmissible hearsay. In this regard, I note that hearsay statements may be 
considered on summary judgment if the statements are capable of being admissible at trial. Shelton v. Univ. of Med. & Dentistry, 
223 F.3d 220, 223 n.2 (3d Cir. 2000).  [*39] Moreover, to the extent that the statements are offered not to show the truth of the 
matter asserted, but to demonstrate their effect on the listener, they may be admissible. See Marks v. Marina, 213 Fed. Appx. 
147, 213 Fed. Appx. 147, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 479, at *10-11 (3d Cir. Jan. 10, 2007) (court properly admitted evidence offered 
not for its truth, but to show the effect on the listener); Faulkner v. Super Valu Stores, Inc., 3 F.3d 1419, 1434 (10th Cir. 1993) 
(""statements offered for the effect on the listener . . . are generally not hearsay.""). "
621,16," The Agreement defined a ""Referencing Product"" as an ESI KCI Product, a potassium chloride product that is the subject of an 
ANDA or NDA that references a Key NDA, or a potassium chloride product marketed by ESI as equivalent to, or otherwise 
substitutable on a generic basis for, K-Dur. (ESI Mem., Ex. 24 (Settlement Agreement) at P 1.2). An ESI KCI Product  [*44] was 
defined as the 20 Meq extended release potassium chloride tablet described in Key's ANDA. (Id.). "
622,17," Although the FTC found both the Upsher and ESI Agreements unlawful, it noted the limited evidence presented regarding the 
ESI settlement and stated that ""[a]s a matter of prosecutorial discretion, we might not have brought a stand-alone case based on 
such relatively limited evidence."" Schering-FTC, 2003 FTC LEXIS 187, at * 166. "
625,18," The opinion in Tamoxifen II amended and superseded In re Tamoxifen Citrate Antitrust Litig., 429 F.3d 370 (2d Cir. 2005) 
(""Tamoxifen I""). Tamoxifen II predominantly made changes and corrections to the citations in the Tamoxifen I opinion, but did not 
modify the court's analysis or holding. "
626,19," Abbott had multiple patents relating to terazosin hydrochloride, the active ingredient in Hytrin. Id. The patents covered various 
forms of the terazosin hydrochloride compound and methods for using it. Id. "
627,20," On remand, the district court still applied a per se analysis and found the agreements at issue in Valley Drug to be per se 
illegal. See In re Terazosin Hydrochloride Antitrust Litig., 352 F. Supp. 2d 1279 (S.D. Fla. 2005). However, in its subsequent 
decision in Schering, the Eleventh Circuit found the agreements in Valley Drug to be ""wholly different"" from the Upsher and ESI 
Agreements. Schering, 402 F.3d at 1066, n.14. The court noted that the ""critical difference"" is that the agreements in Valley Drug 
did not involve final settlements of the patent litigation, and did not permit the generic company to market its product before 
patent expiration. Id. "
628,21," The Eleventh Circuit also rejected the FTC's conclusion that the Niacor license was not worth $ 60 million, but was a payment 
to keep Upsher off the market, and stated that the FTC's conclusion was ""not supported by law or logic."" Id. at 1070. "
629,22," Zeneca refers collectively to Imperial Chemical Industries, PLC (""ICI"") and its former subsidiaries, Zeneca, Inc., AstraZeneca 
Pharmaceuticals LP, and Astra Zeneca PLC, which succeeded to ICI's rights to the patent at issue. Tamoxifen II, 466 F.3d at 
190, 193."
629,23," The case was before the Second Circuit on plaintiffs' appeal of the district court's dismissal of their antitrust claims pursuant 
 [*72] to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Id. "
633,24," As Judge Greenaway noted, his opinion addressed a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss and was decided under the framework 
of that rule, which treats all of Plaintiffs' allegations as true and draws all inferences in Plaintiffs' favor. Id. at 527 (noting that 
Plaintiffs' alleged that but  [*89] for the reverse payments, Upsher and ESI would have settled on different terms and entered the 
market sooner); 528 (noting the standard for 12(b)(6) and 12(c) motions); 529 (noting that there is no heightened pleading 
standard in antitrust cases); 533 (stating that Plaintiffs had sufficiently pled anti-competitive conduct and noting that, at pleading 
stage, court must consider defendants' pro-competitive justifications as unproven). "
634,25," Contrary to DP Plaintiffs' argument, Judge Greenaway did not decide that the terms of the Upsher and ESI Settlements 
exceeded the exclusionary scope of Schering's patent. Rather, he merely concluded that Plaintiffs had alleged that the 
settlement agreements exceeded the scope of  [*92] the patent. In re K-Dur, 338 F. Supp. 2d at 532."
634,26," The record in Schering included the ALJ's factual finding that the quoted language was included in the settlement so that 
""Upsher-Smith could continue to market its Klor Con 8 and Klor Con 10 wax matrix tablets without any restrictions,"" and because 
""Schering wanted to prevent Uphser-Smith from simply renaming its Klor Con M 20 product to get around the language and 
intent of the settlement agreement."" Schering-ALJ, 2002 FTC LEXIS 40, at * 62-63 (P 158). The ALJ found that ""no other 
restrictions on any of Uphser-Smith's other products were intended by the settlement agreements."" Id."
634,27, DP Plaintiffs do not contend that Schering's '743 Patent was procured by fraud on the PTO. 
641,1," Counts 12 (state law anticompetitive claims) and 14 (misappropriation of trade secrets) have been dismissed by stipulation of 
the parties, along with all allegations of misappropriation of plaintiffs' trade secrets by Trans Union and VantageScore Solutions. 
See June 23, 2008 Order [Docket No. 373]. "
642,2," On November 5, 2008, the Court issued the Sixth Amended Pretrial Scheduling Order that gave Fair Isaac until January 23, 
2009 to depose expert Robert Anderson and defendants the right to depose by this same date any expert who submitted a 
report on behalf of Fair Isaac in response to the Anderson report. See Docket No. 434. "
645,3," Included the ""antitrust"" category of counterclaims is Experian's California Unfair Competition claim. See Prop. Experian Answer 
and Counterclaims at pp. 86, ยถยถ 73-75."
645,4," Fair Isaac did not object to the addition of the agree-upon trademark cancellation counterclaim. See See Plaintiffs' 
Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion to Strike Defendants' Filings on December 4, 2008 (""Pls.' Strike Mem."") at p. 2. "
648,5," This Court notes that while the Amended Complaint was in effect during the January 17, 2007 First Set of Document Requests, 
the Amended Complaint already contained essentially the same allegations as those found in the Second Amended Complaint 
pertaining to unreasonable and illegal restraint of trade claim under Section One of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C ยง 1, and attempt 
and conspiracy to monopolize the market for credit scoring in violation of Section Two of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 2. See 
Amended Complaint [Docket No. 9] at pp. 56-62, ยถยถ 166-203. "
652,6," In its November 3 decision, the Court summarized defendants' rationale for obtaining the projections considered by Fair Isaac 
in entering into the agreement with Equifax, despite a finding that they constituted work product: Defendants claim that they have substantial need of the revenue projections and analyses, uniquely in the possession of 
Fair Isaac, because they are ""highly relevant"" to Fair Isaac's claim in its Second Amended Complaint that it will be driven 
from the scoring industry due to a lack of access to credit data and distribution. See Defs.' Mem. at p. 22. According to 
defendants, it is unfair for Fair Isaac's witnesses to contend that the agreement with Equifax will not prevent harm to Fair 
Isaac's scoring business while at the same time not producing the facts, [*49]  including the projections that the witnesses 
considered in entering into the agreement with Equifax. Id. at pp. 22-23. In other words, defendants' assertion of substantial 
need is that the documents are ""highly relevant"" and could provide useful impeachment material as to Greene, Campbell 
and Nelson. In opposition, Fair Isaac submitted that defendants' experts, armed with Fair Isaac's agreements with Equifax, 
have all of the data necessary to perform their own analysis of what Fair Isaac's revenue might be under the agreements. November 3, 2008 Order [Docket No. 431] at p. 17. The Court notes that defendants never represented they needed the 
material to support a potential antitrust or tortious interference with contract counterclaims."
652,7," Motions to amend under Rule 15(a) and motions to supplement under Rule 15(d) are subject to the same standard. See Glatt 
v. Chicago Park District, 87 F.3d 190, 194 (7th Cir. 1996) (standard under Rule 15(d) is the same as under Rule 15(a)) (citations

central among the factors, which should be considered in the exercise of the court's broad discretion in deciding whether to allow 
a complaint to be supplemented, is whether ""the supplementation would hinder judicial efficiency, prejudice the rights of other 
parties to the action, or would insert a frivolous claim.""). "
654,8," Pursuant to Rule 42(a), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court has broad discretion to consolidate actions that ""involve a 
common question of law or fact."" Enterprise Bank v. Saettle, 21 F.3d 233, 235 (8th Cir. 1994). Rule 42(a) allows a court to ""1) 
join for hearing or trial any or all matters at issue in the actions; (2) consolidate the actions; or (3) issue any other orders to avoid 
unnecessary cost or delay."" The purpose of consolidation is to encourage convenience and economy of administration of cases 
and avoid unnecessary cost or delay, and in considering such a motion, a court should weigh: Whether the specific risks of prejudice and possible confusion [are] overborne by the risk of inconsistent 
adjudications [*57]  of common factual and legal issues, the burden on parties, witnesses and available judicial resources 
of common factual and legal issues, the length of time required to conclude multiple suits as against a single one, and the 
relative expense to all concerned of the single-trial, multiple-trial alternatives. Fratzke v. IC System, Inc., Civil Nos. 05-1115 (JRT/RLE), 06-232 (PJS/RLE), 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27750, 2007 WL 1114155

economy."" Powell v. National Football League, 764 F. Supp. 1351, 1359 (D. Minn. 1991)."
654,9," Presumably any future motion to consolidate will address how a consolidation is merely not an attempt to contravene this Order 
or the ability of the Court to manage the cases brought before it. "
655,10," This Court notes that defendants' motion [Docket No 485] did not make a request to add affirmative defenses and therefore, 
the Court does not consider any proposed amendment to allow those defenses to be added to VantageScore's Answer and 
Counterclaims to the Third Amended Complaint. "
660,1," BG was served in compliance with the Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extra-Judicial Documents in 
Civil and Commercial Matters. "
661,2," See, e.g., Richards v. Lloyd's of London, 135 F.3d 1289, 1295 (9th Cir. 1998) (""Without question this case would be easier to 
decide if this  [**9] footnote in Mitsubishi had not been inserted. Nevertheless, we do not believe dictum in a footnote regarding

applicable law.""); Haynsworth v. The Corporation, 121 F.3d 956, 968 (5th Cir. 1997) (""We do not read Mitsubishi so broadly.

667,3," Manighalam also asserts several other bases for standing, claiming he is aggrieved as sole shareholder, and is a party of 
record as one who filed a motion to vacate and as a cross-defendant. However, inasmuch as he professes to pursue the claims 
as the assignee of ASA, we need not address the significance of these other matters."
667,4, See Brandt v. Superior Court (1985) 37 Cal.3d 813. 
668,5," Given our ultimate conclusions in this case, we need not decide whether the treble damages awards made available by statute 
should be divisible into assignable and nonassignable portions -- that is, whether one-third of the statutory damages 
 [*16] should be assignable as the compensatory portion and the remaining two-thirds of the statutory damages should be 
nonassignable as the penal portion. "
672,6," See now Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (p)(2). "
673,7," For informational purposes, in framing the second cause of action, ASA, in the third amended complaint, stated: ""ASA alleges 
that . . . defendants . . . would only provide marketing on their own website for customers . . . who purchased T3 lines. Plaintiff 
alleges that there is no technical reason for doing so; defendants could just as easily provide website marketing for customers 
purchasing T1 lines. Plaintiff further alleges that most ISPs, including ASA, neither need nor want the additional speed of a T3."" 
The court held that there was no triable issue  [*31] of fact regarding the second cause of action. It stated, inter alia, that 
advertising is a service, so no cause of action lies under section 16727, which does not support a cause of action when the tying 
item is a service. "
674,8," While not disputing any of the statements, ASA did object to the relevancy of some of them. The evidentiary objections were 
overruled, and Manighalam does not challenge the evidentiary ruling on appeal. "
675,9," Although ASA objected to the declarations, its objections were overruled in the order granting summary judgment. On appeal, 
Manighalam does not challenge the order overruling ASA's objections. Moreover, he concedes  [*38] the one point we note from 
the declaration of Drew Armbruster, concerning control over the equipment. "
680,1," Consistent with Magistrate Judge Griffin's assessment, the court considers Dr. Savarirayan to be the lone plaintiff in this case. 
As the R&R notes, ""[t]he caption of the complaint lists both the plaintiff and the Commission on Quality Health Care in America 
(""CQHCA""), which is described as a 'Federal entity set up under Title IV of Public Law 99-660-The Health Care Quality 
Improvement Act of 1986.' โฆ However, the CQHCA  [*4] is not specifically named as a plaintiff in the body of the complaint and 
all references to 'plaintiff' in the complaint are clearly intended to mean the plaintiff."" (Docket No. 101 at 5.) "
681,2," In a response to defendant Pekalo's motion to dismiss, the plaintiff attached another amended Complaint, which added a Title 
VII claim directed against defendant Pekalo. (Docket No. 35 Ex. 1.) There was no motion for leave to amend filed, and defendant 
Pekalo has been dismissed, without prejudice, from this litigation. Therefore, consistent with Magistrate Judge Griffin's 
assessment, the court views the Docket No. 6 Amended Complaint as the plaintiff's operative Complaint."
681,3," Formally, Judge Griffin recommended that (1) defendant Allen's First Motion to Dismiss (Docket No. 28) be granted and his 
Second Motion to Dismiss (Docket No. 47) be denied; (2) the Hospital, CHS, and Newsome's Motion for Summary Judgment 
and their two Motions to Dismiss (Docket Nos. 30, 53, 55) be granted; (3) defendant Griffin's Motion for Summary Judgment 
(Docket No. 42) be granted and his Motion to Dismiss (Docket No. 46) be denied; and that (4) Barnett and Blue Cross' Motion for 
Summary Judgment (Docket No. 59) be granted. According to the R&R, the denial of Allen and Griffin's second motion to 
dismiss would be technical, and the Magistrate recommended that the plaintiff's claims be dismissed against these defendants 
on the basis of their respective initial dispositive motion. Judge Griffin also noted that the counterclaims of the Hospital, CHS, 
Newsome, Barnett, and Blue Cross were not affected by the R&R. (Docket No. 101 at 17.) Since the R&R was issued, the 
parties have provided no further briefing on any counterclaims, and, therefore, this court's opinion does not bear on  [*9] any 
counterclaims either. "
682,4," The Hospital's Motion to Strike cites a provision in the Tennessee Rules of Court -- Federal and the Health Insurance Portability 
and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for the notion that the private information about certain patients disclosed on page 15 of the 
plaintiff's 44-page filing contained in Docket No. 146 should be stricken. (Docket No. 147.) While the Hospital has failed to show 
its standing to enforce these patients' HIPAA rights, it is inappropriate and unnecessary for the private medical information of 
patients not remotely involved in this proceeding to be part of the publicly available case file or to be posted on the ECF. The 
court will order the page removed  [*12] from the case file and the ECF but will not sanction the plaintiff, as the Hospital also 
requested. (Id.)"
682,5," Apparently, the Tennessee state court never issued a final order on the plaintiff's  [*13] legal malpractice claim against Allen, 
and, therefore, the R&R concluded that this claim is not barred by res judicata principles. (See Docket No. 145 Ex. 1.) "
683,6," As mentioned in the factual discussion, following Judge Griffin's R&R, the plaintiff has continued to file various materials, 
motions, and responses, and, in one of those responses, the plaintiff specifically challenges the res judicata finding by arguing 
that the finding is ""irrelevant"" because the Tennessee court was not ""fair and impartial"" and a federal court should not be 
""subservient"" to a state court. (Docket No. 134.) This argument is not supported by anything more than the plaintiff's rampant 
speculation and innuendo. Further, it is a well-settled principle of comity that the forum in which the civil plaintiff must complain 
about any unfair treatment at the state court trial level is the state court of appeals, not the federal district court."
683,7," Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) provides that summary judgment shall be granted if ""the pleadings, the discovery and 
disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is 
entitled to judgment as a matter of law."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  [*18] To prevail, the moving party must meet the burden of "
684,," proving the absence of a genuine issue of material fact as to an essential element of the opposing party's claim. See Celotex 
Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); Logan v. Denny's, Inc., 259 F.3d 558, 566 (6th 
Cir. 2001). "
685,8," As noted above, in his R&R objections, the plaintiff asked to be provided with notice and an opportunity to cure from this court if 
there are any ""magic words"" that he failed to use in his briefing that might make a difference in the outcome of the litigation, and 
the plaintiff asked that his R&R objection serve as a notice of appeal to the Sixth Circuit if this court rejected his arguments 
therein. (Docket Nos. 112 and 125.) The request for ""notice of magic words"" is unsupported by any law of which this court is 
aware. Also, importantly, the plaintiff's R&R objections do not serve as a notice of appeal to the Sixth Circuit. The plaintiff must 
make a formal appeal based on the relevant rules of procedure."
685,9," The court does not view the plaintiff's receiving some kind of advice from a lawyer in Illinois who has not entered an 
appearance of record in this case on behalf of the plaintiff as a reasonable excuse for the delay. "
686,10," The rest of the ""fraud"" claim is a lengthy discussion of what the plaintiff perceives as a ""fraudulent liaison"" between the 
defense attorneys in this case and the Tennessee judicial system to get his case transferred to favorable, hand-picked judges. 
(Id.) The court does not view this allegation as helpful to the plaintiff's fraud claim against the defendants in this case. "
697,1," The State may ""commence an action on behalf of the state to recover a forfeiture of not less than $ 50 nor more than $ 500 for 
the first violation  [**12] and not less than $ 200 nor more than $ 2,500 for each subsequent violation."" ยง 100.30(4). The State 
may also issue a ""special order"" requiring a retailer (such as Flying J) to cease and desist sales in violation of the Unfair Sales 
Act, under penalty of forfeiture ""not less than $ 200 nor more than $ 5,000 for each violation."" ยง 100.30(5)(a). "
700,2," As the FTC observed, the Act employs ""one of the steepest minimum markups on retail fuels in the country. . . . [T]he Act's use 
of the 9.18% measure -- as well as the 3% and 6% measures -- appears completely arbitrary. . . In fact, the minimum markup 
percentages do not, as the Act suggests they should, accurately reflect a 'proportionate part of the cost of doing business.'"" D. 
35-4 at 5. "
706,1," An exception may still exist for below-tariff pricing. See Cost Mgmt. Servs. v. Washington Natural Gas Co., 99 F.3d 937, 954 
(9th Cir. 1996) (""[I]n [a] particular, narrow set of circumstances, 'below-tariff pricing may serve as a surrogate for below-cost 
pricing . . .' [Citation]."") (discussing cases)."
706,2," The dominance of the ""average variable cost"" standard in predatory pricing cases reflects the influence of the classic law 
review article by Professors Areeda and Turner. See Cascade Health Solutions, 515 F.3d at 909; see generally Phillip Areeda 
& Donald F. Turner, Predatory Pricing and Related Practices Under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 88 Harv. L. Rev. 697, 712 
(1975). Areeda and Turner wrote that marginal cost is the optimal measure of a firm's costs. Areeda & Turner, supra, at 716. 
""Marginal cost is the increment to total cost that results from producing an additional increment of output."" Id.at 700. This cost, 
however, is often difficult to determine. ""Thus, the professors adopted average variable cost as a surrogate for marginal cost."" 
Cascade Health Solutions, 515 F.3d at 909. Average variable cost is defined as follows: Variable costs, as the name implies, are costs that vary with changes in output. They typically include such items as 
materials, fuel, labor directly used to produce the product, indirect labor such as foremen, clerks, and custodial help, 
utilities, repair and maintenance, and per unit royalties and license fees. The average variable [*11]  cost is the sum of all 
variable costs divided by output. Areeda & Turner, supra, at 700. "
708,3," Although not germane to the instant motion to dismiss, it is noted that these claims are governed by a one-year statute of 
limitations. See G.H.I.I. v. MTS, Inc., 147 Cal. App. 3d 256, 277, 195 Cal. Rptr. 211 (1983) (""[T]he settled rule in California is that 
statutes which provide for recovery of damages additional to actual losses incurred, such as double or treble damages, are 
considered penal in nature and thus governed by the one-year period of limitations stated in section 340, subdivision (1)."") 
(citations omitted). "
709,4," The California statute expressly defines cost as the full cost of doing business, including overhead, depreciation and interest 
cost. Cal. Bus. & Prof Code ยงยง 17026, 17029, 17073; Murphy Tugboat Co. v. Crowley, 454 F. Supp. 847, 857 (N.D. Cal. 1978). "
719,1," The factual background about the EPDM industry is drawn primarily from the Second Amended Consolidated Complaint. These 
facts are not material for purposes of this motion and are included for informational purposes only. "
720,2," Oil extended elastomer EPDM is created by adding petroleum-based extender oil during the manufacturing process, which 
alters the properties of the polymer and lowers the manufacturing cost. Asher Report at P 22. "
721,3," Analogizing the Rule 23 inquiry to the preliminary injunction process,  [**17] the Court held that HN3[
] any findings on the 
merits at the class certification stage would not be binding for the ultimate fact-finder -- ""[a] trial judge's finding on a merits issue 
for purposes of a Rule 23 requirement no more binds the court to rule for the plaintiff on the ultimate merits of that issue than 
does a finding that the plaintiff has shown a probability of success for purposes of a preliminary injunction."" Id. at 39 (emphasis 
in original)."
721,4," In addition, Rule 23(b)(3) considers the following factors relevant when determining whether common issues predominate and 
whether class certification is a superior method of adjudication: (A) the class members' interests in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions; (B) the extent and 
nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already begun by or against class members; (C) the desirability or 
undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum; and (D) the likely difficulties in managing a 
class action. "
725,5," As discussed above, the Court held this requirement applies with ""equal force to all Rule 23 requirements."" In re IPO, 471 F.3d 
at 33 n.3. "
728,6," Dr. Leffler is the opt-out plaintiffs' (Parker Hannifin Corporation, PolyOne One Corporation, and The Goodyear Tire & Rubber 
Company) expert. Although those plaintiffs are not party to the class certification motion, I will include Leffler's analysis of the 
EPDM market because the defense experts address Leffler's analysis in an expert report submitted in this action. "
733,7," Beyer's regression technique is described as ""Ordinary Least Squares"" (""OLS"") and uses ""fixed effects."" Id. at P 38. Beyer 
explains that using ""fixed effects"" enables the considerations of customer buying power, negotiating strength, and the like to be 
taken into consideration. Id."
733,8," ""P[EPDM]"" stands for the price of EPDM, ""D[EPDM]"" stands for the demand of EPDM, ""S[EPDM]"" stands for the supply of 
EPDM. ""Cons"" stands for the conspiracy variable."
733,9," According to Beyer, Platts is a ""leading global supplier of energy and metals related information."" P 40 n.56. "
736,10," The  [**69] ""fraud-on-the-market"" doctrine established in Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 245-37, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. 
Ed. 2d 194 (1988), creates a rebuttable presumption that (1) an issuer's misrepresentations will affect the price of securities that 
are traded on the open market, and (2) investors rely on market price to reflect an accurate value for that security. Id. (citing 
Hevesi v. Citigroup, Inc., 366 F.3d 70, 77 (2d Cir. 2004)). "
738,11," The facts of Hydrogen Peroxide are distinguishable from the present case. At the 11 class certification stage, the plaintiffs' 
expert -- the same Dr. Beyer employed by plaintiffs in this case - merely asserted that he could create an economic model using 
proof common to the class, but never actually completed his proposed models/analyses. Hydrogen Peroxide, 552 F.3d at 313, 
315. The defendants' expert, on the other hand, contended that Beyer's modeling would fail. Id. at 313-14. In this case, Beyer 
has actually presented an econometric model that purports to show that antitrust impact is susceptible to common proof. 
Although the defense experts claim to dispute the feasibility of constructing an econometric model using proof common to the 
class, their reports are better characterized as disputing the results of the plaintiffs' modeling. To resolve this dispute would be to 
place myself in the role of the ultimate factfinder by choosing which expert's econometric model or theory is ""correct."" Therefore, 
having presented a working econometric model that demonstrates class-wide  [**75] impact and injury using proof common to 
the class, the plaintiffs here have gone further than the plaintiffs in Hydrogen Peroxide in establishing that the requirements of 
Rule 23 have been met. "
750,1," Others involved in the events surrounding the inequitable conduct stated in depositions that they had no recollection of any 
relevant facts. Id. at 988 n.17. "
753,2, These and all subsequent paragraph citations refer to the SAC.
753,3," Amphastar filed the SAC under seal, with this allegation redacted in the public version. Amphastar's ground was that it obtained 
the information in ยถ 45(e) earlier in this case and that this information was subject to the Court's protective order. Aventis did not 
seek to keep this allegation confidentialโin fact, it was discussed in open  [*18] court at the hearingโbut neither did Aventis 
oppose Amphastar's motion to file it under seal. See, e.g. Hearing Tr. at 46, 1-3 (Jan. 26, 2009) (statement of counsel for 
Amphastar). See also Letter from Stephen A. Campbell, Senior VP, Regulatory Affairs, Amphastar Pharm., Inc. to Lester M.

records show Aventis' process has changed at least seventeen times in eight years). "
754,4," Some SAC allegations trigger Rule 9(b)'s heightened standard for pleading fraud. Rule 9(b) is discussed below where it 
applies."
754,5," HN5[
] The minimum required injury for standing is ""some damage flowing from the unlawful [antitrust misconduct]; inquiry 
beyond this minimum point goes only to the amount and not the fact of damage."" Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, 
Inv.., 395 U.S. 100, 114 n.9, 89 S. Ct. 1562, 23 L. Ed. 2d 129 (1969)  [*22] (emphasis in original). Standing also requires that the 
antitrust violation be a ""material cause"" of that damage. Id. Material causation and injury in fact are jurisdictional issues; even if 
they are satisfied at the pleading stage, the requirements must continue to be satisfied at all stages of the case. Contrary to Aventis' implications, these jurisdictional requirements are not the same as antitrust injury. HN6[
] The antitrust 
injury element (4) of the substantive antitrust offense asks whether the injury in fact is the type the antitrust laws remedy; not 
whether there has been injury in fact. PHILLIP E. AREEDA ET AL., ANTITRUST LAW, ยถยถ 335b, e-f (3d ed. 2007) (emphasizing that the 
standing test remains the same at all stages and clarifying that antitrust injury is not the same as standing). "
756,6," Amphastar also alleges that Aventis also fraudulently listed Patent No. 4,692,435 (""the '435 patent"") in the Orange Book, but 
that patent expired in 2001. See ยถ 45(b). Because the '435 patent had expired, it was not the subject of a Paragraph IV 
certification and did not trigger a Hatch-Waxman stay. Further, there is no allegation that this  [*27] patent was ever asserted 
against Amphastar. Nor is there any allegation that the patent caused Amphastar any harm not caused by the Lovenox patent. 
Therefore, the '435 patent is immaterial. Cf. In re Buspirone Patent Litig., 185 F. Supp. 2d 363 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (fraudulently 
listing a patent in the Orange Book and bringing an enforcement action after a Paragraph IV certification regarding that patent 
may constitute enforcement conduct). See also HOVENKAMP, IP & ANTITRUST ยง 74.e1 (discussing antitrust concerns about Orange 
Book patent listing). "
757,7," A Court in the Northern District recently observed a similar problem with the type (c) theory. It held that otherwise protected 
conduct could be included in the antitrust analysis if a court ""first find[s] that the other aspects of the scheme independently 
produce anticompetitive harms."" Hynix Semiconductor, Inc. v. Rambus, Inc., 527 F. Supp. 2d 1084, 1090-91 (N.D. Cal. 2007). 
Hynix was decided before Kaiser, where the Ninth Circuit's approach is incompatible with the Hynix test. Further, the Hynix test 
conflates Noerr-Pennington immunity with the substantive ยง 2 element of antitrust injury. Not only is that doctrinally incorrect, it 
may not be necessary: if, in the but-for world, the patent could not have been enforced, damages flowing from enforcement may 
be recoverable, even if the substance of the petitioning activity cannot be used to plead or  [*31] prove an antitrust violation. Cf. 
HOVENKAMP, IP AND ANTITRUST ยง 11.4f (approving Hynix's damages outcome but not the doctrine). "
758,8," For purposes of this motion, the Court assumes that Amphastar's attorney fee award did not negate all damages flowing from 
Aventis' patent enforcement conduct. "
763,9," Even giving Amphastar the benefit of inferences from its Walker Process claim, the SAC still has not made this non-Walker 
Process conduct any more than conceivable."
763,10," To the extent Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Ben Venue Lab., 90 F. Supp. 2d 540, 544-46 (D.N.J. 2000), may suggest that 
Hatch-Waxman requires a different approach, it is disapproved in light of the 2003 decision in Bourns and the 2001 in decision in "
764,," Andrx. However, the better reading of Bristol-Myers is that the plaintiff there had adequately shown on summary judgment that 
the Hatch-Waxman automatic thirty-month stay may have been a material cause of the approval delay and that, in light of the 
automatic stay, requiring further indicia of preparedness was unreasonable. Id. at 546 (rejecting the proposed legal standard that 
a company subject to the Hatch-Waxman stay must be ""fully prepared to enter the market"" and emphasizing the automatic 
nature of the stay (emphasis added)). "
769,1," We decline Christy's request to take judicial notice of newspaper stories reporting that airlines have made it more difficult and 
costly for passengers to transport their skis. Whether or not such materials would be admissible in district court, this is an appeal 
of an order dismissing the complaint at the pleading stage. The question before this court is whether the complaint states a claim 
upon which relief may be granted. For that purpose, we assume that the factual allegations of the complaint are true, and are not 
concerned with evidence that the parties might bring supporting or challenging those allegations. "
771,2," We should not be misread as suggesting the implausibility of a rental ski product market within a reasonably well-defined 
geographic area. We simply hold implausible Christy's attempt to suggest a product market exists in rental skis for destination 
skiers, disaggregated from the full destination ski experience. "
797,1," The USDA considered placing a fence around its facilities adjacent to the Fresno State campus, but declined to do so. 
Although the USDA purportedly told employees that they were not to take or distribute plant materials from new varieties, the 
USDA made no efforts to examine materials removed from the USDA facility to ensure that persons entering  [**19] the facility 
did not remove plant material for these varieties. (Complaint, P 51). "

licensee did not halt an infringement on the patent, it had the right to bring an infringement action. This right was found ""illusory"" 
by the court because the licensee could grant a royalty-free sublicense to an alleged infringer under the license agreement, 
thereby making the licensor's right to sue nugatory. Here, the USDA does not have such an ""illusory"" right."

(3) Invalidity of the patent or any claim in suit for failure to comply with any requirement of sections 112 or 251 of this title, (4) Any other fact or act made a defense by this title."
810,35, U.S.C. ยง 282. 
812,15," The law of the circuit in which the district court sits governs the antitrust law issues. HN48[
] ""[W]hether conduct in 
procuring or enforcing a patent is sufficient to strip a patentee of its immunity from the antitrust laws is to be decided as a 
question of Federal Circuit law."" Nobelpharma, 141 F.3d at 1068. HN49[
] ""Whenโฆthe courts consider a patentee's behavior "
813,," under Federal Circuit law and determine that it involved either an inappropriate attempt to procure a patent or an inappropriate 
attempt to enforce a patent, the remainder of the antitrust inquiry must proceed under the law of the regional circuit."" "
818,16," Plaintiffs cite several cases which do not support a patent misuse claim pre-issuance patent, including a Texas Court of 
Appeals case, Reich v. Reed Tool Co., 582 S.W.2d 549 (Tex.App. 1970), which is not applicable in the Ninth Circuit. And none 
of these cases addresses whether collecting royalties per-issuance of patent on its own constitutes a ""rule of reason"" patent 
misuse claim."
818,17," Plaintiffs also argue in response to Defendant's motion  [**94] to dismiss its' sixth claim that the Commission restricts third 
party distribution that extends into foreign territories and cite Extractol Process v. Hiram Walker & Sons, 153 F.2d 264 (7th Cir. 
1946). Extractol is an older Seventh Circuit decision that does not address patent misuse. Neither party fully briefed this issue, 
which cannot be resolved as the arguments are unclear. "
832,1," Petitioners consist of several corporate entities and subsidiaries, and their names and corporate structures have changed 
frequently over the course of this litigation.  For simplicity, we will refer to all the petitioners as ""AT&T."" "
835,2," The Court of Appeals assumed that any duty to deal arose only from FCC regulations, 503 F.3d 876, 878-879, n 6(CA9 2007), 
and the question on which we granted certiorari made the same assumption.  Even aside from the District Court's reasoning, 
App. to Pet. for Cert. 77a-85a, it seems quite unlikely that AT&T would have an antitrust duty to deal with the plaintiffs.  Such a 
duty requires a showing of monopoly power, but--as the FCC has recognized, In re Appropriate Framework for Broadband 
Access to Internet Over Wireline Facilities, 20 FCC Rcd. 14853, 14879-14887 --the market for high-speed Internet service is 
now quite competitive; DSL providers face stiff competition from cable companies and wireless and satellite providers. "
836,3," Like the Court of Appeals, 503 F.3d at 880, amici argue that price-squeeze claims have been recognized by Courts of Appeals 
for many years, beginning with Judge Hand's opinion in United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, 148 F.2d 416 (CA2 1945) 
(Alcoa).  In that case, the Government alleged that Alcoa was using its monopoly power in the upstream aluminum ingot market 
to squeeze the profits of downstream aluminum sheet fabricators.  The court concluded:  ""That it was unlawful to set the price of 
'sheet' so low and hold the price of ingot so high, seems to us unquestionable, provided, as we have held, that on this record the 
price of ingot must  [****26] be regarded as higher than a 'fair price.'""  Id., at 438.  Given developments in economic theory and 
antitrust jurisprudence since Alcoa, we find our recent decisions in Trinko and Brooke Group more pertinent to the question 
before us. "
838,4," We note a procedural irregularity with this case:  Normally, an amended complaint supersedes the original complaint.  See 6 C. 
Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure ยง 1476, pp 556-557 (2d ed. 1990).  Here, the District Court addressed the 
amended complaint in its 2005 order, App. to Pet. for Cert. 36a-52a, but the court only certified its 2004 order--addressing the 
original complaint--for interlocutory appeal,  [****32] id., at 56a-57a.  Both parties, as well as the Solicitor General, have 
expressed confusion about whether the amended complaint and the 2005 order are properly before this Court.  See Brief for 
Petitioners 9, n 6 (noting ""some ambiguity"" about which order was certified); Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 17 (""[I]t is 
unclear whether the 2005 Order and the amended complaint are properly at issue in this interlocutory appeal""); Brief for 
Respondents 8-10.  The Court of Appeals majority did not address any of the District Court's holdings from the 2005 order, so 
we decline to consider those issues at this time. "

agency; (2) knowledge of such acts by the parties sought to be held; and (3) reliance on the apparent agency consistent with 
ordinary care and practice."" Id. at 739. Here, Plaintiffs have presented no evidence of any express manifestation from REI to RES that RES may act as REI's agent in 
Wisconsin. As to apparent agency, Plaintiffs have presented evidence that REI permitted RES to use the ""Reliant"" name and 
logo in marketing natural gas in Wisconsin. However, Plaintiffs have presented no evidence that anyone relied on an apparent 
agency relationship between REI and RES. Plaintiffs do not identify any evidence in the record supporting such reliance. None

consumer. 392 U.S. 481, 487-89 (1968). Thus, the defendant argued that the plaintiff suffered no injury. Id. The Court rejected

defendant] had overcharged it during the damage period and showed the amount of the overcharge . . . ."" Id. at 494. Similarly, in Illinois Brick Co., the Court rejected the plaintiffs' attempt to use the ""passing on defense"" offensively. 431 U.S. 720,

charged by the defendant were passed through the intermediaries to the plaintiffs. Id. at 727. Therefore, the plaintiffs asserted

921,3," Throughout this order, the court refers to specific  [**14] patents by the patent's last three digits, i.e., U.S. Patent No. 5,915,105 
is referred to as ""the '105 patent."" "
923,4," Rambus moved in limine to prelude presentation of the Manufacturers' fraud claims to a jury because, according to Rambus, 
the Manufacturers had no evidence that they had suffered damages as the result of the alleged fraud. The court found that 
Nanya had not offered any evidence of fraud damages but nevertheless let the fraud issue as to Nanya go to the jury for an 
advisory verdict. Sufficient evidence was offered to support a claim for fraud damages by Hynix and Micron. Hynix 
Semiconductor Inc. v. Rambus, Inc., 527 F. Supp. 2d 1084 (N.D. Cal. 2007). "
927,5," On cross-examination, Mr. Rhoden wavered, testifying that JEDEC's patent policy was ""written down."" Tr. 627:25-628:20. 
 [**25] Mr. Rhoden then backed off, suggesting he believed that he understood JEDEC's patent policy more as something that 
was explained at meetings to the engineers present. Id. 628:22-25. Incidents like this one, and other conflicts in his testimony 
described below, as well as an obvious pro-JEDEC, anti-Rambus bias, undermined Mr. Rhoden's credibility. "
936,6," The Manufacturers took this approach to avoid opening the door to evidence about Micron's litigation with Mosaid in which 
Micron makes similar allegations that Mosaid breached JEDEC's disclosure duty by failing to disclose information about its 
patent portfolio. Tr. 2376:25-2378:20; 2381:16-22. The Manufacturers argued in their new trial motion that such an inference cannot ethically be drawn because  [**55] Mr. Allan's 
expert report suggests that he understood the disclosure obligation at JEDEC to extend to applications and the intent to file 
patent applications. The court disagrees, as stated in its denial of the new trial motion. Hynix Semiconductor Inc. v. Rambus Inc., 
2008 WL 2951341, *9-*10 (N.D. Cal. Jul. 24, 2008). Neither Mr. Allan's report, nor the reason the Manufacturers did not question Mr. Allan, is in evidence. The court is left with 
evidence that someone with first hand knowledge about the disclosure policy was not asked about it. This permits the inference 
drawn by the court and the court sees no ethical problem in drawing that inference. However, it is not an inference on which the 
court places much weight in light of the testimony of Messrs. Crisp and Grossmeier. "
939,7," ""RDRAM"" or ""Rambus DRAM"" refers to Rambus's proprietary memory architecture that it developed in the early 1990s and that 
competed with JEDEC's standards and SLDRAM throughout the 1990s. "
941,8," Min Kwon Yoo, the Hynix employee  [**72] responsible for memory technical marketing and for negotiating with Rambus three 
years later in 1998, admitted that at that time ""I myself didn't quite understand as to what 'Other DRAMs' was in reference to, so I 
asked the folks at Rambus about that, but didn't really get a straight answer."" Docket No. 3322, 12:1-13:3; 43:2-43:8 (video 
testimony). "
942,9," Various trial exhibits corresponding to documents used in Mr. Yoo's depositions were admitted into evidence. See Tr. 2177:5-
2179:8. "
946,10," Any claim by Nanya that the PTO issued patents to Rambus which Rambus knew were invalid but yet attempted to enforce 
was not included in the trial and reserved by Nanya for later resolution. "
951,11," The latest patent-in-suit was U.S. Patent No. 6,751,696 issued June  [**105] 15, 2004."
951,12," Nanya's patent misuse defense base upon Rambus's alleged procurement of the patents-in-suit by fraud on the patent office 
was not tried in this phase of the lawsuit Rambus brought against Nanya and is reserved for later resolution. "
967,1," The motion to amend was set for hearing on March 6, 2009. However, defendants' opposition to the motion to amend centers 
on the same issues which are decided in this order. Hence, the March 6, 2009 hearing on the motion to amend is VACATED and 
the motion will be decided in this order."
967,2," The Court will issue a separate order on Tatung Company of America, Inc.'s motion to dismiss the direct purchaser plaintiffs' 
first amended consolidated complaint. "
968,3," Notwithstanding their entry of guilty pleas to felony violations of 15 U.S.C. ยง 1, defendants LG Display Co. Ltd., LG Display 
America, Inc., and Sharp Corporation have joined in the motions to dismiss the amended complaints for failure to meet the 
notice pleading requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. "
970,4," Defendants have also moved to dismiss direct purchaser plaintiff Phelps Technology Inc. on the ground that Phelps' claims 
arise out of pre-2001 purchases of TFT-LCD panels. Because the Court finds that the complaint's pre-2001 allegations are 
sufficient, the Court denies defendants' motion to dismiss Phelps Technology Inc. on this ground. "
973,5," Indeed, defendants strenuously argue that plaintiffs' lower court authority should be disregarded because A&M was issued by 
the highest court in Michigan. "
974,6," Defendants contend -- and plaintiffs do not disagree -- that plaintiffs do not have standing to seek relief under HN18[
] 
Arkansas antitrust law because that law only permits predatory pricing claims alleging that items were sold ""at less than cost"" 
and does not create a private right of action for an alleged conspiracy to raise prices. See Ark. Code Ann. ยง 4-75-310; see also 
FTC v. Mylan Labs, Inc., 62 F. Supp. 2d 25, 44-45 (D.D.C. 1999). "
975,7," As previously indicated, plaintiffs have agreed to dismiss their Florida unjust enrichment claims. Therefore, the Court need not 
address the issue of exhaustion of remedies as to Florida law. "
985,1," The motion to amend was set for hearing on March 6, 2009. However, defendants' opposition to the motion to amend centers 
on the same issues which are decided in this order. Hence, the March 6, 2009 hearing on the motion to amend is VACATED and 
the motion will be decided in this order."
985,2," The Court will issue a separate order on Tatung Company of America, Inc.'s motion to dismiss the direct purchaser plaintiffs' 
first amended consolidated complaint."
985,3," Notwithstanding their entry of guilty pleas to felony violations of 15 U.S.C. ยง 1, defendants LG Display Co. Ltd., LG Display 
America, Inc., and Sharp Corporation have joined in the motions to dismiss the amended complaints for failure to meet the 
notice pleading requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. "
987,4," Defendants have also moved to dismiss direct purchaser plaintiff Phelps Technology Inc. on the ground that Phelps' claims 
arise out of pre-2001 purchases of TFT-LCD panels. Because the Court finds that the complaint's pre-2001 allegations are 
sufficient, the Court denies defendants' motion to dismiss Phelps Technology Inc. on this ground. "
990,5," Indeed, defendants strenuously argue that plaintiffs' lower court authority should be disregarded because A&M was issued by 
the highest court in Michigan. "
992,6," Defendants contend -- and plaintiffs do not disagree -- that plaintiffs do not have standing to seek relief under Arkansas 
antitrust law because HN21[
] that law only permits predatory pricing claims alleging that items were sold ""at less than cost"" and does not create a private right of action for an alleged conspiracy to raise prices. See Ark. Code Ann. ยง 4-75-310; see also 
FTC v. Mylan Lab., Inc.., 62 F. Supp. 2d 25, 44-45 (D.D.C. 1999). "
993,7," As previously indicated, plaintiffs  [*38] have agreed to dismiss their Florida unjust enrichment claims. Therefore, the Court 
need not address the issue of exhaustion of remedies as to Florida law. "
1024,1," In accordance with the standard of review for motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(2) and Rule 12(b)(6), the court will present 
the facts as alleged in the amended complaints. See infra Parts II.A, III.A."
1024,2," As used in this memorandum, ""chocolate candy"" and ""chocolate confectionary products"" refer to chocolate bars and other 
mass-produced chocolate confections manufactured and packaged for sale to retail consumers. Examples of these products 
include Nestle Crunch(R), Hershey's Kisses(R), M&M's(R), and Cadbury Creme Eggs(R). "
1025,3," Cadbury Holdings and Hershey Global have executed three separate agreements. Pursuant to an asset purchase agreement, 
dated July 22, 1988, Hershey Global's predecessor in interest purchased all assets owned by the then-existing U.S. division of 
the Cadbury business portfolio. (See Doc. 478 at 14.) Two trademark licensing agreements, both dated August 25, 1988, 
granted Hershey Global the exclusive right to sell Cadbury-branded products in the U.S. (See Doc. 478-4 at 24; Doc. 478-7 at 
21.) The parties have submitted all three agreements,  [**35] which span eleven separate docket entries. (See Docs. 478 "
1026,," through 478-11.) For ease of identification, the court will cite the agreements by referencing the document and page numbers 
assigned by the Electronic Case Filing system."
1026,4," Hershey simultaneously raised prices for king-size bars and ten-packs by 13.6% and 15.4%. (Doc. 418 P 61; Doc. 420 P 94.a; 
Doc. 422 P 46; Doc. 448 P 80.)"
1026,5," Prices for other Nestle sizes also jumped, including a 14.5% increase on king-size bars and a 16.8% increase on ten-packs. 
(Doc. 418 P 62; Doc. 422 P 47; Doc. 448 P 81.) "
1027,6," Hershey implemented price increases on other products at the same time: its king-size bars surged  [**39] by 4.7%, its six-
packs by 8.5%, and its variety packs by 5.5%. (Doc. 418 P 66; Doc. 420 P 94.b; Doc. 422 P 50; Doc. 448 P 84.)"
1027,7," Nestle contemporaneously raised prices by 4.8% on its king-size bars and 7.7% on six-packs. (Doc. 418 P 67; Doc. 420 P 
94.b; Doc. 422 P 51; Doc. 448 P 85.)"
1027,8," Mars also raised prices for packages of Dove brands by 15% during the third round of increases. (Doc. 418 P 69; Doc. 422 P 
53; Doc. 448 P 87.) "
1028,9," Exhibits D and E to Docket Entry No. 173 are the sworn statements that Daniel Wilcock, an attorney for the Canadian 
Competition Bureau, prepared in furtherance of the Bureau's investigation into alleged price-fixing  [**42] activities in Canada. 
Plaintiffs' amended complaints rely upon these statements to describe defendants' alleged price-fixing activities, and defendants 
do not dispute the authenticity of these documents. (Doc. 477 at 30 n.7.) The court may therefore consider them when ruling on 
the motions to dismiss. See In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1426 (3d Cir. 1997)."
1028,10," The cooperating party is widely presumed to be Cadbury Canada, (see, e.g., Doc. 420 P 108), though the current record does 
not confirm its identity.  [**44] The court has retained the anonymous descriptors utilized in Wilcock's sworn statements to 
identify the company and employees who participated in the Canadian antitrust investigation."
1028,11," Cooperating Individual 1 did not recall the precise words that Leonidas used during the encounter but informed Canadian 
antitrust authorities that Leonidas stated, ""I want you to hear it from the top--I take my pricing seriously"" or ""We are going to take 
a price increase and I want you to hear it from the top"" or language to similar effect. (Doc. 418 P 101; Doc. 420 P 109.c; 
 [**45] Doc. 448 P 123.) "
1029,12," The court commends counsel for the insightful advocacy contained in their briefs and displayed at oral argument. Counsels' 
written submissions thoroughly canvassed pertinent areas of law, and these materials clearly represent the collaborative work of 
many capable attorneys. The court expresses its appreciation to all counsel involved in these efforts. "
1030,13," The court is aware of case law suggesting that plaintiff may not rely on the pleadings alone but  [**51] must produce affidavits 
or other affirmative evidence to overcome a jurisdictional challenge under Rule 12(b)(2). See, e.g., Rodi v. S. New Eng. Sch. of 
Law, 255 F. Supp. 2d 346, 348 (D.N.J. 2003). However, this misstates plaintiff's burden. HN4[
] If the moving party fails to 
submit evidence contravening the allegations of the complaint, the court is bound to accept plaintiff's allegations regardless of 
whether plaintiff presents further evidence in support thereof. See Miller Yacht Sales, Inc. v. Smith, 384 F.3d 93, 97 (3d Cir. 
2004) (observing that, unless the court hears evidence on the jurisdictional issues, all allegations must be taken as true for 
purposes of assessing whether the plaintiff has established a prima facie case of jurisdiction); Carteret Sav. Bank, 954 F.2d at 
142 n.1 (stating that the ""plaintiff need only plead [a] prima facie case to survive the initial [Rule 12(b)(2)] motion, but must 
eventually establish jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence""). In other words, although the burden of persuasion always 
lies with the non-moving party, the burden of production rests initially with the party moving for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(2)."
1030,14," HN7[
] Section 12 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 22, authorizes nationwide service of process in antitrust cases, including those brought under ยง 1 of the Sherman Act. "
1031,15, See supra note 14.
1031,16," HN14[
] While minimum contacts alone are insufficient  [**57] to support personal jurisdiction, a defendant that possesses 
minimum contacts ""must make a compelling case that litigation in [the forum state] would be unreasonable and unfair"" to prevent 
jurisdiction from attaching. O'Connor, 496 F.3d at 325 (internal quotation omitted). "
1032,17," During oral argument, counsel for Nestle S.A., Nestle U.S.A., and Nestle Canada observed that the amended complaints 
muddle the jurisdictional inquiry by referring to parent and subsidiary corporations collectively as ""Mars,"" ""Nestle,"" and 
""Cadbury."" (Doc. 571 at 32.) The court agrees. This pleading practice--while permissible under the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure--disadvantages plaintiffs when responding to the HN16[
] Rule 12(b)(2) motions, which require that plaintiffs establish personal jurisdiction as to each particular corporate defendant. See Miller Yacht Sales, Inc. v. Smith, 384 F.3d 93, 101 
(3d Cir. 2004) (""[T]he specific jurisdiction determination is both claim-specific, . . . and defendant-specific."" (citations omitted)). 
Plaintiffs will be required to demonstrate that each of the moving defendants individually possesses sufficient contacts with the 
United States to warrant exercise of personal jurisdiction regardless of whether their corporate families, considered as a whole, 
possesses such contacts."
1032,18," In this regard, a Rule 12(b)(2)  [**60] motion differs significantly from one under Rule 12(b)(6), which requires the court to 
adopt plaintiffs' allegations regardless of defendants' contrary evidence. See Time Share Vacation Club v. Atl. Resorts, Ltd., 735 
F.2d 61, 66 n.9 (3d Cir. 1984); Eagle Computer Assocs. v. Chesapeake Software Servs., Inc., No. 99-CV-2583, 1999 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 17509, 1999 WL 1030441, at *1 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 12, 1999). The court thus credits plaintiffs' averments of fusion between 
the U.S. and Canadian chocolate markets for purposes of the Rule 12(b)(6) motions. The jurisdictional challenges, in contrast, 
require plaintiffs to rebut the Rule 12(b)(2) defendants' affidavits with evidence reflecting in-forum contacts. In the absence of 
such evidence, the court must espouse the facts described in defendants' evidentiary submissions. See supra Part II.A. "
1033,19," Many of the cases cited by the parties as applicable to the conduct of Mars Canada and Nestle Canada apply stream-of-
commerce doctrine rather than a pure purposeful availment analysis. The present discussion addresses only purposeful 
availment and minimum contacts concerns. The stream-of-commerce doctrine is considered at infra Part II.B.1.b."
1033,20," This conclusion results from the paucity of record evidence about the product transfers. The record does not outline the 
distribution system by which Mars Canada and Nestle Canada move products into the U.S., nor does it explain the terms of the 
transactions. Such evidence is highly relevant to Mars Canada and Nestle Canada's participation in the American chocolate 
candy market and could demonstrate that these entities possess more extensive contacts with the U.S. than the current record 
reveals. The  [**63] court will therefore grant plaintiff jurisdictional discovery to explore the precise contours of these 
transactions. See infra Part II.B.3."
1033,21," Plaintiffs rely upon MM Global Services v. The Dow Chemical Co., 404 F. Supp. 2d 425 (D. Conn. 2005) for the proposition 
that ""manufacturing chocolate products sold throughout the United States [is] undoubtedly relevant to Plaintiffs' claims."" (Doc. 
523 at 26; see also Doc. 520 at 35-36; Doc. 521 at 33.) MM Global, however, is inapposite. In MM Global, the plaintiffs produced 
evidence that foreign defendants purchased products worth several million dollars from U.S. suppliers via American 
communication facilities and distribution networks. 404 F. Supp. 2d at 430-31. The defendants then fixed prices for these 
products in resale transactions conducted abroad and arbitrarily refused to accept orders from the plaintiffs. Id. at 431. The court 
concluded that the foreign defendants in-forum purchases ""were part and parcel"" of subsequent resales at anticompetitive price 
levels and provided appropriate grounds for purposeful availment jurisdiction. Id. at 435. In the present matter, by contrast, 
plaintiffs have produced no evidence that either Mars Canada  [**64] or Nestle Canada participated in the anticompetitive sales 
underlying their claims. Rather, the record suggests that these defendants are remote suppliers who possess no U.S. pricing 
authority, and their absence from the allegedly suspect American pricing scheme places them beyond MM Global's reach. Emerson Electric Co. v. Le Carbone Lorraine, S.A., No. Civ.A. 05-6042, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72705, 2008 WL 4126602 
(D.N.J. Aug. 27, 2008) is likewise unavailing to plaintiffs. In Emerson Electric, a foreign defendant moved to dismiss for lack of 
personal jurisdiction. The court denied the motion because the defendant allegedly exerted pricing control in the American 
market by dictating prices to its American subsidiaries and by acquiring an American corporation to eliminate market 
competition. 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72705, [WL] at *3-4. In the instant matters, plaintiffs allege no such conduct on the part of 
Mars Canada or Nestle Canada. A similar distinction exists with regard to In re Isostatic Graphite Antitrust Litig., No. 00-CV-
1857, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21656, 2002 WL 31421920, at *3 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 19, 2002) (concluding that exercise of personal 
jurisdiction over foreign defendants was proper because ""[p]laintiffs have presented evidence which suggests that the allegedly 
 [**65] anticompetitive actions of the American subsidiaries were directed, at least in part, by their foreign parent corporations""). "
1034,22," Asahi was decided by a vote of 4-4-1. The perspectives articulated by Justices O'Connor and Brennan represent the two 
pluralities. Justice Stevens joined neither plurality and posited a third jurisdictional analysis. "
1036,23," Plaintiffs apparently do not assert stream-of-commerce jurisdiction over Nestle Canada. Even if the court were to infer such an 
argument, the ratio decidendi set forth above applies with equal force to Nestle Canada."
1036,24," In re Bulk [Extruded] Graphite Products illustrates the evidentiary showing that a plaintiff must proffer to acquire jurisdiction 
under the Calder effects test. In Bulk [Extruded] Graphite, a foreign defendant moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. 
Plaintiffs introduced deposition testimony confirming that the moving defendant  [**77] had attended meetings concerning price 
fixing in foreign graphite markets. Bulk [Extruded] Graphite, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54906, 2007 WL 2212713 at *6. During these 
meetings, a co-conspirator recommended that the defendant ""establish contacts"" with the co-conspirator's American company in 
order to exert upward pressure on U.S. prices. 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54906, [WL] at *7-8. In furtherance of this 
recommendation, the defendant informed the co-conspirator that he desired to implement a global price-fixing scheme to prevent 
arbitrage across markets. 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54906, [WL] at *8-9. The court concluded that although the co-conspirator ""did 
not expressly state [that the defendant] acted to fix prices in the United States, [the co-conspirator] clearly did state that a 
conspiracy to fix prices in Europe must necessarily involve the fixing of prices in other markets, including the United States."" 
2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54906, [WL] at *9. Plaintiffs therefore marshaled ""thin"" evidence that the defendant ""expressly directed 
acts in furtherance of price fixing in the United States."" Id. In the instant matter, plaintiffs' evidentiary proffer is more diaphanous than that provided in Bulk [Extruded] Graphite. Plaintiffs 
have not submitted evidentiary support for their contentions that the American and  [**78] Canadian confectionary markets are 
interwoven or that arbitrage opportunities exist across international boundaries. Absent an evidentiary showing consistent with 
that advanced in Bulk [Extruded] Graphite, plaintiffs have failed to establish a prima facie case of Calder effects jurisdiction. "
1037,25," Plaintiffs' briefs do not address Calder's applicability to Cadbury plc, Cadbury Holdings, or Nestle Canada."
1037,26," At oral argument, counsel sparred over the variety of adjectives used to describe the type of contacts that are prerequisite to 
an exercise of general jurisdiction, including systematic, continuous, substantial, significant, extensive, and pervasive. (Doc. 571 
at 75-76, 91.) To allay lexical concerns, the court will confine its discussion to the analysis of systematic and continuous contacts 
upon which the Supreme Court predicated general jurisdiction in Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining Co., 342 U.S. 437, 445, 72 
S. Ct. 413, 96 L. Ed. 485, 63 Ohio Law Abs. 146 (1952). The court notes that Helicopteros later reaffirmed ""continuous and 
systematic"" contacts as the standard for exercise of general jurisdiction. 466 U.S. at 414-15 & n.9 (quoting Perkins, 342 U.S. at 
438, 445)."
1037,27," ADRs are investment devices that allow American investors to trade shares of foreign corporations in the same manner as 
those of domestic companies. ADRs are issued by intermediary banks that acquire  [**82] securities from foreign corporations 
and repackage them as instruments that investors can freely trade on U.S. exchanges. See Pinker, 292 F.3d at 367. "
1038,28," Rejection of ADRs as the foundation for general jurisdiction is consistent with Pinker, which held only that ADRs, standing 
alone, may provide a basis for specific jurisdiction in a securities fraud case. See Pinker, 292 F.3d at 372-73. The Pinker court 
declined to address the relationship between ADRs and general jurisdiction, id. at 368 n.1. To be clear, the court considers 
Nestle S.A.'s ADRs relevant to the general jurisdiction analysis but not sufficient in isolation to bring Nestle S.A. before the court. 
See Allen, 522 F. Supp. 2d at 195; accord Newport Components, Inc. v. NEC Home Elecs. (U.S.A.), Inc. 671 F. Supp. 1525, 
1540 (C.D. Cal. 1987) (relying upon ADRs as one of several contacts supporting general jurisdiction in a case decided prior to 
Pinker)."
1038,29," Plaintiffs have cited no case in which a court invoked general jurisdiction over a holding company as the result of acquisitions 
or ""due diligence"" activity undertaken in the relevant forum, and the court will not announce such a rule in this case. See, e.g., 
Helicopteros, 466 U.S. at 418  [**83] (""HN35[
] [M]ere purchases, even if occurring at regular intervals, are not enough to 
warrant a State's assertion of in personam jurisdiction over a nonresident corporation in a cause of action not related to those 
purchase transactions.""); BP Chems., 229 F.3d at 261, 263 (HN36[
] ""[A] non-resident's contracting with a forum resident, 
without more, is insufficient to establish the requisite minimum contacts"" for specific or general jurisdiction.). HN37[
] A holding 
company's acquisition of a domestic entity may confer specific jurisdiction in actions related to the transaction, but they do not 
support general jurisdiction in the absence of additional contacts with the forum. See, e.g., Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining 
Co., 342 U.S. 437, 438, 445, 72 S. Ct. 413, 96 L. Ed. 485, 63 Ohio Law Abs. 146 (1952) (documenting activities sufficient to 
support exercise of general jurisdiction, such as maintaining files, conducting business correspondence, distributing checks, 
opening bank accounts, and implementing management decisions within the forum); cf. Telcordia Techs., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
10194, 2005 WL 1268061, at *7 (""[I]ncorporating a subsidiary in the United States does not give rise to jurisdiction unless the 
litigation is related to the act of incorporation . . . .""); compare Ross v. Altria Group, Inc., No. C 04-01453, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
18558, 2004 WL 2055712, at *4 (N.D. Cal. 2004)  [**84] (declining to exercise general jurisdiction over a holding company that 
engaged in national advertising campaigns but conducted no operations in the forum and maintained no physical presence 
there); with Shepherd Inv. Int'l v. Verizon Commc'ns, Inc., 373 F. Supp. 2d 853, 864-67 (E.D. Wis. 2005) (subjecting a holding 
company to general jurisdiction based upon its solicitation of in-forum capital, direct mailings to shareholders, promotional 
activities, interactive website for the sale of stock, and business relationships with 140 in-forum banks). The court also rejects plaintiffs' assertion that Nestle S.A.'s retention of counsel in the U.S. establishes general jurisdiction. 
Plaintiffs have identified several U.S. law firms hired by Nestle S.A. to undertake its acquisitions. (Doc. 520, Exs. 11-15.) 
However, HN38[
] it is illogical to predicate general jurisdiction upon Nestle S.A.'s employment of attorneys to effectuate 
transactions that fail ex proprio vigore to establish such jurisdiction. A decision to the contrary would suggest that any retention 
of counsel could give rise to general jurisdiction, including hiring attorneys for purposes of litigation. The court does not suggest 
that the  [**85] activities of a defendant's legal representatives in a forum are irrelevant. Indeed, a defendant's propensity for 
litigation may result in the conferrence of general jurisdiction. The cases sub judice, however, do not present such a scenario."
1038,30," Plaintiffs assert that general jurisdiction over Nestle S.A. is appropriate because Nestle S.A. has consented to submit disputes 
arising under a 1989 joint venture contract to the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota. (Doc. 520, Ex. 36 P 
5(b)). Plaintiffs have identified no precedent in which a court predicated exercise of general jurisdiction upon such a fleeting 
contact with a forum. The court finds that this minimal contact is entitled to little weight in the analysis of general jurisdiction. See 
infra p. 41. Sterling Merchandising, Inc. v. Nestle S.A., No. Civ. 06-1015, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31938 (D.P.R. Apr. 15, 2008) is also 
unavailing to plaintiffs' jurisdictional quest. In Sterling Merchandising, Nestle S.A. mounted a jurisdictional defense against the 
plaintiff's claim that it monopolized the Puerto Rican ice cream market through various corporate acquisitions. The court 
determined that it possessed specific jurisdiction over Nestle  [**86] S.A. and, consequently, did not address the issue of general 
jurisdiction. (Id. at 5, 15.) "
1039,31," In re Automotive Refinishing Paint Antitrust Litigation, No. 1426, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15099, 2002 WL 31261330 (E.D. Pa. 
July 31, 2002) and Newport Components, 671 F. Supp. 1525, cited by plaintiffs, do not dictate a contrary result. In both cases, 
the court concluded  [**88] that plaintiffs had established a prima facie case of jurisdiction based upon systematic contacts with 
the United States, including extensive activity in furtherance of direct sales. See Auto. Refinishing Paint, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
15099, 2002 WL 31261330, at *9 (allowing plaintiffs to engage in jurisdictional discovery after establishing that the foreign 
defendant moving for dismissal had directly sold products worth $ 1.5 billion to its U.S. subsidiary); Newport Components, 671 F. 
Supp. at 1538-1540 (predicating general jurisdiction upon defendant's use of federal courts to assert legal claims, issuance of 
ADRs, in-forum advertising, and domestic television sales). As Nestle S.A. does not sell products, maintain personnel, or 
advertise in the U.S., these cases are factually dissimilar."
1039,32, The value of these exports is calculated in Canadian dollars.
1039,33," Plaintiffs submitted fifty-nine bills of lading, many of which appear to be duplicative. "
1040,34," HN43[
] Courts evaluate alter egos in the veil-piercing context by reference to factors such  [**94] as undercapitalization of 
the subsidiary, ""failure to observe corporate formalities, nonpayment of dividends, insolvency of [the] debtor corporation, 
siphoning of funds from the debtor corporation by the dominant stockholder, nonfunctioning of officers and directors, absence of 
corporate records, and whether the corporation is merely a facade for the operations of the dominant stockholder."" Action Mfg., 
375 F. Supp. 2d at 421-22; see also Pearson v. Component Tech. Corp., 247 F.3d 471, 484-85 (3d Cir. 2001). These factors 
also affect the alter ego jurisdictional analysis but do not preclude consideration of other indicia of corporate control. Action Mfg., "
1041,375," F. Supp. 2d at 421 n.13 (observing that HN44[
] ""the factors considered in deciding whether to pierce the corporate veil for 
liability purposes are similar to the factors considered in deciding whether to pierce the corporate veil in the jurisdictional context"" 
but that a court should address ""all relevant factors"" when resolving questions of jurisdiction); Arch, 984 F. Supp. at 837 (""[The 
court] should examine all relevant factors that relate to the intimacy of the relationship between the parent and subsidiary."")."
1041,35," Plaintiffs rely upon defendants' websites as a component of their jurisdictional arguments. HN45[
] A website may support 
exercise of jurisdiction if the defendant ""intentionally interacts with the forum . . . via the web site."" Toys ""R"" Us, 318 F.3d at 452. 
Websites that passively furnish information do not confer jurisdiction over the defendant, whereas sites that allow  [**96] users to 
purchase goods or services generally provide a jurisdictional anchor. Id. A defendant's ""conscious choice to conduct business 
with residents of a forum state"" via its website is pivotal to this inquiry. Id. (quoting Zippo Mfg. Co. v. Zippo Dot Com, Inc., 952 F. 
Supp. 1119, 1126 (W.D. Pa. 1997)). The Rule 12(b)(2) defendants maintain centralized corporate websites that provide basic 
information about defendants' history, brands, and market development. They inform visitors of the current price of defendants' 
stock and ADRs, provide links to annual reports and press releases, and allow prospective employees both in the U.S. and 
abroad to search open positions and submit online applications. None of the websites offers products for sale. None of the 
websites allows visitors to purchase stock or ADRs online. Although the websites contain information about defendants' activities 
within the U.S., they are not customized for an American audience, and they treat the U.S. market no differently than other 
global markets. The court concludes that these websites are properly considered as a contact for purposes of general 
jurisdiction. However, the court also concludes that they are broad  [**97] resources designed for an international audience. 
They do not reflect a particularized intent to conduct business with American residents and therefore receive relatively little 
weight in the jurisdictional analysis."
1041,36," Plaintiffs advance alter ego jurisdiction  [**99] over Cadbury plc and Cadbury Holdings by virtue of alleged control over their 
American subsidiary, Cadbury Adams USA LLC, which is not a party to this matter. (Doc. 571 at 21-23.) Plaintiffs have identified 
no case law addressing whether a court may obtain alter ego jurisdiction over a holding company by virtue of its relationship with 
a non-party subsidiary. The court will defer consideration of this issue until completion of jurisdictional discovery. If plaintiffs wish 
to pursue this argument, counsel will be expected to address it in supplemental briefing. "
1042,37," HN48[
] Alter ego jurisdiction does not attach merely because a parent corporation participates in its subsidiary's business. 
In Savin Corp. v. Heritage Copy Products, Inc., a parent corporation appointed six of the subsidiary's directors, five of which 
were officers or directors of the parent. 661 F. Supp. 463, 469 (M.D. Pa. 1987). One of the parent's officers conducted weekly 
business visits to the subsidiary's premises to oversee the parent's investment in the subsidiary, and the parent covered a 
portion of the subsidiary's operating costs. Id. at 470. The parent also consolidated the subsidiary's earnings in its financial 
statements  [**100] (as required by the law of the country of its incorporation) and utilized the subsidiary's office space. Id. at 
471. Despite this extensive interaction between two corporations, the court declined to assert alter ego jurisdiction. The court 
observed that the two entities engaged in different lines of business, maintained separate corporate books, did not implement 
common marketing strategy, and had complied with all legal formalities. Id. Moreover, the plaintiff failed to ""convince the court 
that [the parent corporation] exercised the type of control over [the subsidiary's] day-to-day operations which would evidence an 
alter-ego relationship."" Id. at 470. Plaintiffs in the instant case have identified significantly fewer interactions between Nestle S.A., Mars Global, Cadbury Holdings, 
and Cadbury plc, and their respective subsidiaries. The annual reports, websites, and corporate value statements offered by 
plaintiffs do not describe the day-to-day operational relationship that exists among these corporations, and this evidentiary 
deficiency subverts plaintiffs' arguments in favor of alter ego jurisdiction."
1042,38," As a non-exclusive guide for 38 counsel, the court suggests exploration of the following issues: "
1043,," . Do representatives of Hershey Global and Cadbury plc or Cadbury Holdings regularly confer as contemplated in the asset 
purchase and trademark agreements? If so, what information do they discuss? . Which party to the Cadbury--Hershey agreements prosecutes and defends trademark infringement actions under the 
Lanham Act? . What benefits, if any, does Nestle S.A. receive under the Societe--Hershey trademark  [**104] license agreement? . Have the Rule 12(b)(2) defendants filed any lawsuit(s) in any court in the United States? . Do the Rule 12(b)(2) defendants transact business in the United States, e.g., by purchasing raw materials, retaining 
consultants, maintaining sales agents, or recruiting employees? . Have the Rule 12(b)(2) defendants executed service contracts with U.S. companies, e.g., for shipment of their products, 
design or manufacture of machinery, or development of promotional materials? . Did the Rule 12(b)(2) defendants increase or reduce the volume of products shipped into the United States during the 
putative class period. If so, what were the reasons for the change? . What form of compensation do Mars Canada and Nestle Canada receive from the transfer of their products to Mars 
Snackfood and Nestle U.S.A.? Are the transfers booked as direct sales or in some other fashion? . Does Nestle S.A. market securities, solicit capital, or entice investors in the United States in furtherance of its merger 
activity? . Does Mars Canada possess autonomy to determine to whom it sells its products, i.e., does Mars Canada sell its products 
to non-Mars entities? . Do Mars Canada and Nestle Canada exercise  [**105] independent control over their marketing, sales, and distribution 
systems, or are they required to utilize systems that interconnect with other members of their corporate families? The court emphasizes that these issues are only illustrative of those to which the court will turn when resolving the jurisdictional 
challenges. Plaintiffs may pursue additional areas of inquiry insofar as it elucidates the Rule 12(b)(2) defendants' contacts with 
the United States."
1043,39," As currently worded, several 39 of plaintiffs' requests exceed the scope of the jurisdictional issues implicated by the Rule 
12(b)(2) motions. For example, Request No. 4 (pertaining to corporate officers' responsibilities), Request No. 7 (pertaining to 
sales data), Request No. 8 (pertaining to pricing letters and announcements), and Request No. 11 (pertaining to per-unit 
manufacturing and distribution costs) likely solicit information beyond the realm of personal jurisdiction. The court expects that 
the parties will meet and confer to tailor all jurisdictional discovery to the issues raised in this memorandum."
1043,40," The court will not impose specific limits on the aggregate number of depositions on jurisdictional issues. However, the 
 [**106] court suggests that the parties attempt to address these issues predominantly through written discovery. Absent 
compelling circumstances, the court suggests a limit of two depositions per defendant."
1043,41," Defendant-intervenor Government of Canada initially opposed certain of these requests. (See Doc. 495 at 9-13.) All parties 
affected by the requested documents successfully negotiated a resolution of defendant-intervenor's objections and submitted a 
proposed order memorializing their agreement via facsimile on December 12, 2008. The court will incorporate this joint 
resolution into the Case Management Order that will govern jurisdictional discovery. "
1044,42," These defendants 42 are Cadbury Canada, Hershey Global, Hershey Canada,  [**107] Mars Global, Mars Snackfood, and 
Nestle U.S.A. "
1045,43," Although Flat Glass was decided in a summary judgment posture, this court has previously concluded that its circumstantial 
analysis of anticompetitive conduct is relevant to the plausibility analysis under Twombly. See Labelstock II, 566 F. Supp. 2d at 
372-73 (HN63[
] ""[A]llegations  [**113] of observed conduct--actual forbearance from competition for customers, parallel price 
increases, and excess production capacity--are placed among other factual allegations that plausibly suggest a preceding 
agreement.""). "
1046,44," HN64[
] The Foreign 44 Trade Antitrust Improvement Act of 1982 (""FTAIA""), 15 U.S.C. ยง 6a, does not foreclose consideration of defendants' conduct in Canada for purposes of the Rule 12(b)(6) motions. The FTAIA places foreign 
anticompetitive conduct beyond the reach of the Sherman Act if it ""adversely affect[s] only foreign markets."" F. Hoffmann-La 
Roche Ltd. v. Empagran S.A., 542 U.S. 155, 161, 124 S. Ct. 2359, 159 L. Ed. 2d 226 (2004) (emphasis added). It does preclude 
a Sherman Act claim based upon foreign conduct that has a ""direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect"" on domestic 
commerce. Id. at 161 (quoting 15 U.S.C. ยง 6a(1)); Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. v. Intel Corp. (In re Intel Corp. Microprocessor 
Antitrust Litig.), No. Civ.A. 05-1717, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3407, 2007 WL 137152, at *11 (D. Del. Jan. 12, 2007) (observing that 
the FTAIA does not prohibit inquiry into foreign conduct that is relevant  [**116] to domestic claims.) Hence, the Act permits 
assessment of the Canadian conduct, which allegedly constitutes an integral component of the instant price-fixing scheme. See 
Intel Corp., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3407, 2007 WL 137152, at *11; cf. In re Aspartame Antitrust Litig., No. 2:06-CV-1732, 2008 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 109670, 2008 WL 2275531, at *3 (E.D. Pa. May 13, 2008) (concluding that the FTAIA does not limit discovery 
requests directed abroad if they are related to an antitrust matter properly before a federal court)."
1046,45," Of course, defendants contest the connectivity between the U.S. and Canadian chocolate confectionary markets and have 
produced evidence that the Canadian defendants do not interact with the U.S. See supra p. 23. HN65[
] Unlike Rule 12(b)(2) challenges, however, a Rule 12(b)(6) motion restricts the court's review to the face of the complaint and documents upon which 
it relies. See supra note 18; Part III.A. Accordingly, the court has considered only the facts contained in the amended complaints 
for purposes of the instant motions notwithstanding defendants evidence to the contrary."
1046,46," In re Elevator Antitrust Litigation, 502 F.3d 47 (2d Cir. 2007), does not compel a contrary conclusion. The plaintiffs in Elevator 
alleged a price-fixing conspiracy in the U.S. market for elevators based upon evidence that defendants fixed prices in European 
markets. Id. at 51-52. As to the American market, plaintiffs advanced only conclusory allegations that defendants ""(a) 
[p]articipated in meetings in the United States and Europe to discuss pricing and market divisions; (b) [a]greed to fix prices for 
elevators and services; (c) [r]igged bids for sales and maintenance; (d) [e]xchanged price quotes; (e) [a]llocated markets for 
sales and maintenance; (f) [c]ollusively required customers to enter long-term maintenance contracts; and (g) [c]ollectively took 
actions to drive independent repair companies out of business."" Id. at 51 n.5. (internal quotation omitted). The court upheld 
dismissal of the plaintiff's allegations because ""[a]llegations of anticompetitive wrongdoing in Europe--absent any evidence of 
linkage between such foreign conduct and conduct here--is merely to suggest . . . that if it happened there, it could  [**118] have 
happened here."" Id. at 52 (emphasis added, internal quotation omitted). The court noted that the outcome may have differed had 
the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants engaged in global marketing, produced fungible products, monitored prices in other 
markets, or raised prices successfully in the United States. Id. The instant complaints do not suffer from the same Twombly infirmities. They assert that defendants instituted three 
contemporaneous and nearly identical price increases and monitored pricing in both the United States and Canada. They 
describe a market ripe for collusion, punctuated by declining demand and product saturation. They also detail significant "
1047,," interaction between similarly structured markets the U.S. and Canada, where authorities have identified strong evidence of price 
fixing. These allegations are sufficient to ""nudge [plaintiffs'] claims across the line from conceivable to plausible,"" and render 
Elevator inapposite to defendants' motions. Id. at 52 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570, 127 S. Ct. 1974)."
1047,47," The IEU plaintiffs advance antitrust claims under the laws of the following states: Arizona, California, the District of Columbia, 
Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, 
Tennessee, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. (Doc. 420 PP 136-156.) They also allege claims under the following state 
consumer protection statutes: Arkansas, California, the District of Columbia, Florida, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Nebraska, 
Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin. (Id. PP 161-176.) 
The IPR plaintiffs maintain antitrust claims under the laws of Alabama, Arkansas, California, the District of Columbia, Florida, 
Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, 
Tennessee, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. (Doc. 422 P 102.) The  [**120] IEU and IPR plaintiffs have withdrawn their claims under the antitrust statutes of Hawaii, HAW. REV. STAT. ยงยง 480-
1 to -24, and New York, N.Y. GEN. BUS. LAW ยงยง 340-47. (Doc. 525 at 22 n.24; Doc. 526 at 1 nn.1-2.) The IEU plaintiffs have 
likewise withdrawn their claim under New Jersey law, N.J. STAT ANN. ยงยง 56:9-1 to -19, as have the IPR plaintiffs with respect to 
their claims under Illinois law, 740 ILL. COMP. STAT. ยงยง 10/1-/12. (Id.) The court is cognizant of defendants' request for 
dismissal ""with prejudice,"" (Doc. 540 at 3), but declines to foreclose reassertion of these claims given the vast potential for 
changes in the litigation landscape. Hence, the court will deny the motion to dismiss (Doc. 469) these claims as moot."
1047,48," Defendants request dismissal of the state antitrust claims on the same basis that they seek dismissal of the Sherman Act 
claim, which constitutes a prerequisite to liability under state law. The court's ruling with respect to Twombly renders this 
argument moot. See supra Part III.B.1."
1047,49," The putative class of IPR plaintiffs 49 currently possesses one named plaintiff that does business in Kansas. Defendants seek 
dismissal on standing grounds of all of the IPR plaintiffs' claims except those brought under Kansas law. The IPR plaintiffs 
propose to resolve defendants' objection by filing a second amended complaint that (1) describes the named plaintiff's business 
activities in Iowa and Nebraska and (2) adds parties from each of the other states whose law the IPR plaintiffs invoke. The court 
will permit the IPR plaintiffs to pursue a second amended complaint in accordance with the order accompanying this 
memorandum. "
1048,50," Defendants also challenge 50 the IPR plaintiffs' claims under these state statutes and under Alabama and Mississippi law. The 
IPR plaintiffs have not responded to defendants' challenge to their state antitrust claims. This omission appears to be an 
oversight resulting from the IPR plaintiffs' anticipation of a second amended complaint naming additional parties to cure the 
alleged standing defects. See supra Part III.B.2.a. Defendants' motion to dismiss the claims under Alabama and Mississippi 
antitrust statutes will be denied without prejudice to their right to renew the motion after the IPR plaintiffs have filed a second 
amended complaint. See supra note 49."
1048,51," Defendants move to dismiss claims brought by the IEU plaintiffs under the monopolization statutes of the District of Columbia, 
Michigan, and Minnesota. The IEU plaintiffs respond that their amended complaint erroneously cited these statutes. The motion 
will therefore be granted with respect to the monopolization  [**126] claims, and the IEU plaintiffs may file a motion for leave to 
amend their complaint to rectify this deficiency. "
1049,52," The IEU plaintiffs also advance a claim under N.Y. GEN. BUS. LAW ยง 349, which is not affected by the motion to dismiss 
(Doc. 469)."
1049,53," In re Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) Antitrust Litigation (DRAM I), 516 F. Supp. 2d 1072 (N.D. Cal. 2007) is 
factually distinguishable. DRAM I dismissed a South Dakota claim because the plaintiffs alleged merely ""that defendants' "
1050,," activities had 'a substantial effect on the foreign and interstate commerce'"" without describing the effects within South Dakota. Id. 
at 1099. In the instant matter, however, the IPR and IEU plaintiffs allege that defendants' sold products in South Dakota, (Doc. 
420 PP 49-63, 76; 422 PP 9-23), that they suppressed competition in the Indirect Purchaser States, which include South Dakota, 
(Doc. 420 P 157; Doc. 422 P 107.a), and that they maintained prices at ""noncompetitive levels throughout the United States and 
in the Indirect Purchaser States."" (Doc. 422 P 107.b (emphasis added); see also Doc. 420 P 157). Plaintiffs have therefore 
alleged anticompetitive effects in South Dakota, and DRAM I does not require dismissal of the amended complaints."
1050,54," Defendants rely upon Medison America, Inc. v. Preferred Medical Systems, 548 F. Supp. 2d 567 (W.D. Tenn. 2007) for the 
proposition that ""[b]are allegations that prices were raised as a result of conduct is insufficient to establish that Tennessee 
commerce was substantially affected."" Id. at 585.  [**131] In Medison America, plaintiff alleged that defendants made 
disparaging statements about plaintiff's financial stability and customer service, which reduced competition for plaintiff's 
products. Id. However, Medison America did not involve price fixing or Sherman Act claims, and plaintiff failed to establish that 
defendants engaged in any anticompetitive conduct that raised prices in Tennessee. Id. In contrast, the IEU and IPR plaintiffs 
have alleged price-maintenance conduct that elevated the cost of chocolate products in Tennessee and nationwide. See supra 
Part III.B.1. Plaintiffs' alleged injury is therefore cognizable under the TTPA."
1050,55," HN77[
] Although West Virginia looks to federal law when interpreting the WVAA, the prohibition against indirect purchaser 
recovery announced in Illinois Brick does not apply to claims under the WVAA. See California v. Infineon Techs. AG, 531 F. 
Supp. 2d 1124, 1154 (N.D. Cal. 2007); DRAM I, 516 F. Supp. 2d at 1097; NMV, 350 F. Supp. 2d at 173-75. "
1051,56," HN79[
] All of these consumer protection statutes 56 prohibit, inter alia, fraudulent or deceptive conduct. However, statutory 
prohibitions on consumer deception do not subsume conduct violative of the Sherman Act. NMV, 350 F. Supp. 2d at 177 n.22; 
see also, e.g., Intel Corp., 496 F. Supp. 2d at 417-18 (allowing consumer protection claims to proceed alongside antitrust 
allegations because plaintiffs alleged that defendant actively concealed incompatibilities between its products and those of its 
competitors). Consequently, the court will address each state consumer protection claim to determine: (1) whether 
anticompetitive conduct falls within the ambit of the statutory language or (2) whether the IEU plaintiffs have alleged those 
additional facts necessary to plead a cause of action thereunder."
1051,57," Bryant, which challenged an allegedly 57 usurious contract, applied contract law principles of unconscionability. 985 S.W.2d at 
302 (stating that unconscionability in contract law requires analysis of ""whether there is a gross inequality of bargaining power 
between the parties to the contract and whether the aggrieved party was made aware of and comprehended the provision in 
question""). However, Bryant provides little guidance on the ADTPA outside of the contract arena. Federal courts addressing 
antitrust claims have therefore relied upon broader definitions of unconscionability. DRAM I, 516 F. Supp. 2d at 1109; NMV, 350 
F. Supp. 2d at 178. Defendants contend that application of broad unconscionability principles is inappropriate under In re 
Graphics Processing Units Antitrust Litigation (GPU), 527 F. Supp. 2d 1011 (N.D. Cal. 2007), which relied exclusively upon 
Bryant's contract law analysis. Id. at 1029-30. The court concludes that the broader views of NMV and DRAM I represent the 
most reasonable  [**136] interpretation of the Arkansas statute in the antitrust context, particularly in light of Bryant's admonition 
that a ""liberal construction of the [A]DPTA is appropriate."" Bryant, 985 S.W.2d at 302. "
1052,58," Equitable Life compared the KCPA to the Kansas antitrust treble-damages statute, previously codified at KAN. STAT. ANN. ยง 
50-801(b). In 2000, the statute was re-codified at KAN. STAT. ANN. ยง 50-161(b) without substantive change."
1052,59," In NMV, the United States District Court for the District of Maine concluded that Tungate's consumer inducement criterion 
applies exclusively to claims brought under the MUTPA's prohibition on ""unfair or deceptive acts"" but not to ""[u]nfair methods of 
competition."" NMV, 350 F. Supp. 2d at 187 n.40 (quoting ME. REV. STAT. ANN. tit. 5 ยง 207). The court declines to adopt NMV's 
construction of Tungate. Although Tungate did not involve price fixing, it nevertheless provides a fitting analysis for cases involving collusive pricing. 
Tungate addressed the legality of artificially elevated prices resulting from sales commissions that the defendant added to a "
1053,," product's purchase price without disclosure. The court did  [**141] not parse the statutory language in the manner suggested by 
NMV. Rather, it assessed whether consumers changed their behavior as a result of the defendant's pricing tactics. Tungate, 714 
A.2d at 797 (""The higher price . . . does not operate to induce customers to purchase [products] they would not otherwise 
purchase if no commission were paid and prices were 20% lower. . . .""). The decisions cited by Tungate confirm that HN90[
] a change in consumer conduct forms the marrow of a MUTPA violation. 
For example, Tungate relied upon Kazmaier v. Wooten, 761 F.2d 46 (1st Cir. 1985), in which the court applied Massachusetts's 
equivalent of the MUTPA. Kazmaier, 761 F.2d at 51; see also MASS. GEN LAW. ch. 93A ยง 2. Kazmaier determined that 
unfairness requires a detrimental change in consumer behavior as a result of confusion fomented by the defendant. Id. at 51 
(concluding that customers suffered no unfairness when their ""compulsion to buy or not buy[] would scarcely be altered by any 
mistake"" resulting from the defendant's conduct). The remaining cases cited in Tungate conducted a similar analysis. See FTC 
v. World Travel Vacation Brokers, Inc., 861 F.2d 1020, 1029 (7th Cir. 1988) (affirming grant of  [**142] a preliminary injunction 
against unfair trade practices in which customers were induced to purchase products through advertisements reflecting 
inaccurately low prices); Resort Car Rental Sys. v. FTC, 518 F.2d 962, 963 (9th Cir. 1975) (concluding that a defendant violated 
the Federal Trade Act by soliciting customers through a deceptively low price). HN91[
] A pricing claim under the MUTPA 
therefore requires proof that the defendant induced consumers to alter their behavior to their detriment. Except in unusual circumstances, higher prices do not induce consumers to purchase products. TFT-LCD, 586 F. Supp. 2d at 
1126; GPU, 527 F. Supp. 2d at 1031. Accordingly, the court adopts the position of those tribunals that have dismissed MUTPA 
claims in price-fixing cases. See TFT-LCD, 586 F. Supp. 2d at 1126; GPU, 527 F. Supp. 2d at 1031."
1053,60," Defendants rely upon GPU, which dismissed claims under the consumer protection statutes of Arkansas, the District of 
Columbia, Kansas, and New Mexico on the ground that price fixing does not constitute unconscionable conduct. 527 F. Supp. 2d 
at 1030. GPU, however, failed to address the decisions of other federal courts that permitted price-fixing claims to proceed under 
the statutes of Arkansas, the District of Columbia, and New Mexico. See, e.g., DRAM I, 516 F. Supp. 2d at 1109; NMV, 350 F. 
Supp. 2d at 178, 183, 196. The court adopts the reasoning of the latter cases, which evince a compelling trend favorable to 
consumer protection claims in price-fixing actions. "
1054,61," This conclusion resonates with ERI Max Entertainment, Inc. v. Streisand, 690 A.2d 1351 (R.I. 1997), which defendants invoke 
in support of their motion to dismiss. ERI considered, inter alia, claims under the RIUTPCPA and for unfair competition under 
Rhode Island common law. The defendants misapprehend the holding in ERI. Addressing the unfair competition claim, the court 
held that ""a finding of unfair competition must be predicated upon conduct . . . that reasonably tended to confuse and mislead 
the general public into purchasing [the defendant's] product when the actual intent of the purchaser was to buy the product of 
[another]."" Id. at 1354 (quoting George v. George F. Berkander, Inc., 92 R.I. 426, 169 A.2d 370, 371 (1961)). Contrary to the 
defendants' contention, the court imposed no similar restriction on claims under HN98[
] the RIUTPCPA, which is ""intended to 
declare unlawful a broad variety of activities that are unfair or deceptive."" Park v. Ford Motor Co., 844 A.2d 687, 692 (R.I. 2004). 
Moreover, the restrictive language in ERI regarding unfair competition derives from George, which was decided approximately 
eight years before the enactment of the RIUTPCPA  [**147] and addressed a common law unfair competition claim. George, 
169 A.2d at 371. HN99[
] While the RIUTPCPA provides a statutory remedy for such claims, its reach is not limited to the 
common law, see Park, 844 A.2d at 692, and the IEU plaintiffs may invoke it as a basis for the instant claim, DRAM II, 536 F. 
Supp. 2d at 1144-45."
1054,62," To the extent plaintiffs 62 rely upon federal common law, Illinois Brick precludes the claim. Ill. Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 
720, 744-47, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977); NMV, 350 F. Supp. 2d at 211. "
1061,1," Tantalum is a rare, very hard,  [**2] and highly corrosion-resistant metal. It occurs naturally in the mineral tantalite. The 
chemical inertness of tantalum makes it a valuable substance for laboratory equipment. It is almost completely immune from 
chemical attack at temperatures below 150[degree]C, and is permeable only by hydrofluoric acid, acidic solutions containing the 
fluoride ion, and free sulphur trioxide. The element has a melting point exceeded only by tungsten and rhenium. Tantalum's main 
use is in the manufacture of electrolytic capacitors. "

States, 345 U.S. 594, 73 S. Ct. 872, 97 L. Ed. 1277 (1953), the Court held that advertising space in a morning newspaper was 
the same product as advertising space in the evening edition of the same newspaper as advertisers had no reason to distinguish 
 [**8] between morning and afternoon readers. By contrast, in Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Servs., 504 U.S. 451, 
462, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1992), the Court observed that servicing and related parts can constitute distinct

1065,10," In its briefing, AVX states that the product over which Cabot is alleged to have market power is ""flake"" tantalum powder (which 
is designated as the ""tying product""). The products that are associated with that product are the ""tied products,"" in this case, 
""nonflake products, nodular powder and KTaF."" AVX Opposition Memorandum at 4 n.3. Cabot counters that AVX's ""belated 
attempt"" to include semi-refined tantalum ore or KTaF as a tied product must fail as the Complaint references non-flake 
powders, which cannot include raw materials such as KTaF. Moreover, Cabot notes that AVX's economic expert Dr. Steven 
Schwartz testified in a February 2008 deposition that he ""no longer makes the assertion that [AVX's] purchases of flake were 
conditioned on [its] purchases of KTaF."" Schwartz Dep. at 50. The injection of KTaF at this stage of the litigation is illustrative of

Complaint, including but not limited to the complete nature and amount of such damages, and the precise means by which AVX 
calculated such damages."" Collis was unable to articulate any method of calculating damages. When asked if he had any 
understanding of the monetary value of AVX's alleged damages, Collis stated that AVX had ""monitored the market price of 
material and compared that with what we ended up paying in the contract when we used the material as against what the market 
price was at the time, and passed that to our expert."" When asked how he would calculate AVX's damages he responded that

[is that] it simply means nothing other than likelihood of success on the merits."" Parker, Tr. (2/17 p.m.) at 41:24-42:3 (Mitchell). 
While Defendants' statement is literally true, precedents irrefutably teach that in this context ""likelihood of success on the merits"" 
has a less substantial meaning than in other preliminary injunction cases. Heinz not only emphasized this point but Whole Foods 
makes clear that Heinz remains good law. The analysis of likelihood of success ""measure[s] the probability that, after an 
administrative hearing on the merits, the Commission will succeed"" in proving that the effect of a merger ""may be to substantially 
lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly."" Heinz, 246 F.3d at 714 (emphasis added). "
1107,12," The Merger Guidelines provide an analytical tool for determining interchangeability and cross-elasticity of demand. The

these two are in the same market [for repair facilities] although obviously, people can move back and forth between 
communicating and non-communicating Estimatics systems""). Communication is required to work with the major insurance 
companies as part of a repair shop network, so all insurance companies and virtually all DRP repair facilities must use 
communicating products. See PX 1020 P 12 (Hayes Prelim. Report); DX 644, App. 2 P 7 (Ordover Coordinate Interaction 
Report). There also is a considerable cost differential between communicating and non-communicating Estimatics products. See 
PX 760 (Applied Computer Resources has two non-communicating Estimatics products that retail for $ 99 per month and $ 135 
per month); PX 173 (CCC's ""Competitive Comparison Chart""); PX 1407 (CCC). Nonetheless, while communicating Estimatics 
products may make up a relevant sub-market,  [**30] that analysis is unnecessary here as it would only further limit the product 
market definition and minimally enhance the market concentration in the relevant market to a legally insignificant degree. The 
Court therefore will define the relevant market to include all Estimatics products."

1109,15," Mitchell argued in closing argument that 15 it thinks the nine insurers who do some in-house total loss valuations account for 
about 20% of the total loss claims market, and that the FTC failed to include those in-house valuations in its HHI calculations. 
Prior to closing argument, however, there seemed to be a consensus that the Books consumed about 10% of the total loss 
valuation market. See PX 548-007 (Mitchell) (chart showing that ""book values"" account for 10% of all total loss claims). This 
figure must include internal calculations performed by insurance companies because only insurance companies (and

points. Stanton Dep. at 26-27 (NADA); Dibble, Tr. (1/23 a.m.) at 38:23-40:4 (Infinity Ins. Co.). Thus, the true ""cost"" of using the

1116,26," Defendants argue that statements 26 such as these are of little value because the industry representatives who made them

1116,27," CCC's CEO, Mr. Ramamurthy, expressed concern that this draft presentation may not accurately reflect the final version of its

FTC in discovery, it was appropriate for the agency to rely on statements in the draft. Furthermore, considering  [**64] the 
overwhelming number of references to barriers in other documents, it seems highly unlikely that the final version omitted any 
reference to ""high barriers to entry."""

1130,44," Defendants argue that Dr. Hayes's opinions are not based in reality because the combined CCC/Mitchell could not 
""conceivably get away with the sort of price increase that"" his Bertrand model predicts. CCC, Tr. (1/21 p.m.) at 179:22-25. But 
Dr. Hayes admits that he puts ""less weight on the precise numbers than the general directional indications that come out of the 
analyses. . . . [W]hether it's going to be 40 percent or 20 percent at each particular supplier, I wouldn't stake my reputation on 
that."" Hayes, Tr. (1/21 p.m.) at 161:24, 177:10-12; see also Hayes, Tr. (1/21 p.m.) at 164:11-12 (""The world is complex[;] we 
can't capture everything in a model that we might like to.""). Thus, it is not particularly troublesome that the extraordinary price 
increases predicted in the model may not accord with ""economic realities."" See Ordover, Tr. (1/23 p.m.) at 151:20-25."
1130,45," Specifically, Dr. Hayes analyzed the price effects on sales of Estimatics to insurers using ""an independent private values 
English auction with no reserve price. The key role of the 'independent private values' assumption is to acknowledge that while 
bidders may know something about their rivals' costs, they do not know more about those costs than their rivals know. The 
absence of a reserve price (i.e., a maximum acceptable bid set by the insurer) is justified by the fact that there are no good 
substitutes for estimatics software . . . ."" PX 1020 P 78 n. 123 (Hayes Prelim. Report)."
1130,46," In addition to inferring from the price increase that the non-merging firm is a more distant third choice, the model also assumes 
a more distant third. This is because the auction model always predicts some unilateral price increase, which, under economic 
theory, can occur only where  [**122] the non-merging firm is a more distant third choice; and because the model was calibrated 
to generate the 80% price-cost margin exhibited in these markets, which, in combination with the high incumbent winning 
percentage and market share data, produces a significant price increase. See DX 644 P 24 (Ordover Report) (lowering the 
economic margin in the model makes ""the gap between the challeng[ing bidders] . . . small[er],"" which, in Dr. Ordover's view, is 
an ""assumption [that] more accurately reflects the business realities""). "
1131,47," Notably, Dr. Hayes's auction model predicts that Audatex will have to reduce prices for Estimatics by approximately 15% when 
it is the incumbent bidder, i.e., when it has a nearly 90% chance of winning, even though the combined CCC/Mitchell will be able 
to raise prices. PX 1059, Ex. S-7 (Hayes Suppl. Report). Defendants make much of the fact that Audatex has aggressively 
attempted to impede this merger, arguing that Audatex's opposition to the merger is evidence in itself of the merger's likely 
competitive effects. See, e.g., Defs.' Post-Trial Brief at 1. "
1132,48," The Court does not conclude that the predictions of Dr. Hayes's Bertrand model are necessarily wrong or that the diversion 
ratios he used are necessarily incorrect. The Court merely concludes that it cannot rely upon such a limited amount of data. Dr. 
Ordover concluded that ""the diversion ratios that [Dr. Hayes] is putting into his model are not robust, I don't think they're sound, I 
don't understand them, and I don't believe that they necessarily match up with the economic realities of the repair facilities in the 
marketplace."" Ordover, Tr. (1/23) at 151:20-25  [**127] (emphasis added)."
1132,49," Even if Audatex were a distant third for some percentage of the market, a unilateral price increase would be profitable for the 
merged firm only if it were unlikely that  [**130] Audatex could reposition itself to replace CCC or Mitchell should they raise 
prices to supracompetitive levels. See Merger Guidelines ยง 2.21. Because the only evidence in the record regarding customer 
preference is that a few insurance companies lack familiarity with Audatex's products, there is no reason to believe that Audatex 
would not be a suitable replacement for CCC or Mitchell. See Hall, Tr. (1/8 a.m.) at 89:11-21 (GMAC does not ""know anything 
about Audatex,"" but it ""plan[s] to learn something about [it]"" if the merger is consummated). "
1135,50," If the two factors always merged, then there would be 50 no need for a public equities analysis when the FTC shows a 
likelihood of success on the merits. The D.C. Circuit's plurality decision in Whole Foods indicated that a separate equities 
analysis is necessary. Whole Foods, 548 F.3d at 1035 (Brown, J.) (""The district court did not apply  [**142] the sliding scale, 
instead declining to consider the equities. . . . If, and only if, the district court's certainty [that the FTC would not succeed on the

2d 306 (1987) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment)."
1139,2," Plaintiffs submit, in opposition to Defendants' motion, certain evidence that is not relevant to the Court's analysis of its subject 
matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' RICO claims. For instance, Plaintiffs' evidence regarding the proportion of Nigeria's foreign 
revenue that is earned from the oil that Nigeria exports, (see Pls.' Opp'n 19), does not help establish the effect Defendants' 
alleged racketeering activity had on the United States. The Court does not consider or discuss here evidence irrelevant to 
determining the Court's jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' RICO claims. Unless otherwise noted, facts discussed herein are undisputed."
1139,3," The exact  [*7] nature of SPDC's relationship with Defendants is at issue in this case. Plaintiffs contend that Defendants (1) 
control SPDC, (2) can be held liable for SPDC's actions; and (3) share SPDC's intent. (Pls.' Opp'n 15-19.) Defendants contend 
that they cannot be held liable for SPDC's actions, and that SPDC's intent cannot be imputed to them. (See, e.g., Defs.' Reply 8-
9.) For the purposes of this motion, the Court assumes, without deciding, that Defendants control SPDC in the way that Plaintiffs 
allege. Documents that Defendants produced to Plaintiffs use the term the ""Shell Group"" to refer to the international network of Shell-
related companies. (See, e.g., Pls.' Opp'n, Ex. 1-17 at 289.) For the purposes of this motion, the Court attributes evidence 
generated by Shell Group companies to Defendants."
1139,4," In a letter to Plaintiffs, Defendants contend that oil SPDC shipped from Nigeria destined for the United States did not 
necessarily arrive in the United States because the oil cargo could, and frequently did, change ownership and/or destination en 
route. (Pls.' Opp'n Ex. 3-22.) However, Defendants do not provide any evidence to support this contention. Accordingly, for the 
purposes of this Order, the Court will assume that the amount of oil SPDC exported that was destined for the United States 
equals the amount of SPDC oil the United States imported. "
1140,5," For the purposes of this order, the Court does not consider or weigh Plaintiffs' evidence regarding Defendants' alleged 
racketeering activity as this evidence is not essential to deciding the jurisdictional question before the Court."
1140,6," Plaintiffs mistakenly state that Defendants made this determination in 1998, (see Pls.' Opp'n 2 n.4). The exhibit that they cite as 
support is actually dated 1996. (See id. at Ex. 1-9.) "
1141,7," When the Court denied Defendants' prior facial challenge to the Court's jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' RICO claims, it noted that 
""plaintiffs' allegations are perhaps less explicit than they could be."" Wiwa, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3293, 2002 WL 319887, at *22. 
Plaintiffs' evidence must now provide the specificity lacking in their pleadings."
1141,8," The Court notes that, in light of the Supreme Court's decision in Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. 
Ed. 2d 1097 (2006) (holding that only those statutory requirements that ""the Legislature clearly states [are] . . . a threshold 
limitation on a statute's scope shall count as jurisdictional""), there is some doubt whether analyzing if a particular claim falls 
within the RICO statute's extraterritorial reach is, in fact, a jurisdictional inquiry. See Norex Petroleum Ltd. v. Access Indus. Inc., 
540 F. Supp. 2d 438, 440-41 (S.D.N.Y. 2007); Republic of Colom. v. Diageo N. Am. Inc., 531 F. Supp. 2d 365, 381-82 (E.D.N.Y. 
2007); Ayyash v. Bank Al Madina, No. 04 Civ. 9201, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9677, 2006 WL 587342, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. March 9, 
2006). Neither party, however, raises this question. Accordingly, the Court does not address it."
1141,9," The Second Circuit has suggested that the antitrust-based effects test may be ""more appropriate"" for RICO claims than the 
securities-based effects test because of the significant similarities between the RICO statute and the antitrust laws. Specifically, 
""the civil action provision  [*15] of RICO was patterned after the Clayton Act"" and both the RICO and antitrust statutes provide 
for treble damages. North South Fin., 100 F.3d at 1052 (internal quotations omitted). "
1142,," However, because neither party objects to the applicability of the securities-based effects test, and because the Court finds that 
Plaintiffs fail to meet either test, the Court need not resolve this issue."
1142,10," Defendants urge the Court, (Defs.' Mem. L. 10-11), to follow its sister court and further require that, in order to meet the 
securities-based effects test, plaintiffs establish that they, themselves, were harmed in the United States by Defendants' alleged 
racketeering activity. See, Norex, 540 F. Supp. 2d at 446. Plaintiffs urge the Court not to follow this approach because the 
Second Circuit has not adopted the United States injury requirement. (Pls.' Opp'n at 22). As explained infra part II.C.1, Plaintiffs have not provided sufficient evidence that Defendants' racketeering activity affected 
anyone in the United States substantially and directly. Accordingly, the Court need not reach the question of whether Plaintiffs 
must particularly demonstrate that they, themselves, were harmed in the United States by Defendants' alleged racketeering 
activity. "
1143,11," Previously, Plaintiffs alleged that Defendants engaged in their racketeering activity in order to (1) prevent MOSOP and Mr. 
SaroWiwa's protests from interfering with Defendants' oil production in Ogoni, (see, e.g., Pls.' RICO Statement, 96-D.E. 10, at 
20-22), or (2) prevent the Ogoni protests from spreading to Defendants' other oil producing areas in Nigeria, (see Order, 
November 6, 2008, 96-D.E. 283, at 5). Plaintiffs do not make the former argument in response to this motion; the evidence they 
cite does not support the latter argument. Accordingly, the Court does not consider them herein. However, the Court notes that 
these alternate purposes  [*21] would not change the Court's analysis of the effect of Defendants' alleged racketeering activity 
on the United States."
1143,12," Plaintiffs make no claims, nor do they offer any evidence, regarding how Defendants' oil affected the United States, e.g. by 
being sold at lower prices. They seem to assume that the fact that Defendants' oil entered the United States is, in and of itself, 
evidence that it affected the United States sufficiently for the Court to assume jurisdiction  [*22] over Plaintiffs' RICO claims. It is 
not. The closest Plaintiffs come to suggesting a theory of how Defendants' oil affected United States commerce is Plaintiffs' assertion 
that Defendants were able to produce oil at a lower cost than other Nigerian producers. (See Pls.' Opp'n 1-2.) Perhaps Plaintiffs 
mean to suggest, although they do not state, that, to the extent that the United States imported these other Nigerian producers' 
oil, Defendants had a competitive advantage in the United States over these other Nigerian producers. If so, Plaintiffs provide no 
evidence to support this contention. These other producers (1) may not have made any costly investments that Defendants 
avoided, and/or (2) may have also benefitted from Defendants' alleged racketeering activities. "
1144,," Accordingly, Plaintiffs offer evidence only that Defendants' oil entered the United States market. They do not allege or establish 
how, or how substantially, it affected United States commerce."
1144,13," Plaintiffs characterize this as a ""competitive advantage"" but they do not identify any person or entity against whom Defendants 
enjoyed this competitive advantage. (Pls.' Opp'n 3.) Plaintiffs appear to assume that, if Defendants lowered  [*23] their costs of 
producing oil in Nigeria by engaging in the alleged racketeering activity rather than meeting protesters' demands, Defendants 
were able to translate these lower costs into higher profits. However, Plaintiffs do not specify how, or document that, Defendants 
were actually able to do so. See infra, pt. II.C.1.b."
1144,14," Because the Court finds that Plaintiffs do not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Defendants' alleged racketeering 
activity had sufficient effects in the United States to justify the Court's jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' RICO claims, the Court does not 
reach Defendants' argument that principles of comity bar its assumption of jurisdiction.  [*24] (Defs.' Mot. 14-15.) "
1145,15," The Court notes that this may not be a necessary assumption. Faced with protests, Defendants could have chosen to neither 
suppress the protests nor meet the protesters' demands. For instance, they might have instead chosen to launch a public 
relations campaign against the protesters, or do nothing at all."
1145,16," The other evidence Plaintiffs cite in support of the proposition that ""[a]ny costs Defendants incurred as a result of violence or 
instability in the region did not substantially affect their business"" do not support this proposition. (Pls.' Opp'n 4 n.6.) Specifically, 
to the extent that the 1994 internal Shell memorandum Plaintiffs provide mentions the state of SPDC's business, it reports that 
the company's production was dropping and that it was ""taking a lot of pain"" because of changes in the Nigerian economy. (See 
id. at Ex. 1-22 at 10084.) The cited page of the ""1995 Country Business Plan,"" also does not provide any relevant information. 
(See id. at Ex. 1-25 at 665.) "
1146,17," The Court cannot use the other evidence Plaintiffs provide regarding United States effects. Plaintiffs provide evidence that, at 
some point in time, nearly half of Nigeria's oil was exported to the United States, most of it oil that had been produced by SPDC. 
(Id. Ex. 2-2 at 105: 15-18.) This evidence does not help establish the Court's jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' RICO claims because (1) 
this proportional measure does not help the Court quantify the impact of Defendants' oil in the United States, and (2) even if the 
Court could use this information to quantify the impact of Defendants' alleged racketeering activity in the United States, Plaintiffs 
do not indicate for what years this information was true. Plaintiffs also provide a news article that states that Shell accounts for nearly half of Nigerian oil output and that Nigerian oil 
accounts for almost  [*31] ten percent of United States oil imports. (See Pls.' Opp'n Ex. 3-23 at b-2.) However, the Court cannot 
use the article to help determine the impact of Defendants' alleged racketeering activities on the United States, in part because 
the article, which was published in 2002, does not state for which years these facts hold true."
1146,18," The Court does not decide whether these types of evidence are necessary or sufficient. They are listed only as examples of 
how Plaintiffs might have sought to prove United States effects. The Court's decision rests on Plaintiffs' lack of any evidence 
other than the gross number of barrels of Defendants' Nigerian oil that the United States imported. Regardless of what evidence 
would suffice, this evidence does not suffice."
1146,19," Plaintiffs' theory of a United States effect involves Defendants' racketeering activities  [*32] leading to cost savings that in turn 
lead to higher investment returns in the United States. The Court notes that this theory, in addition to being too speculative, may 
also be too indirect to meet the securities-based effects test. See Boyd, 544 F. Supp. 2d at 252 (holding effects on United States 
prices too indirect where the racketeering activity was only ""one factor among many"" determining those prices)."
1146,20," The Court notes that Plaintiffs' theory of intent, that Defendants engaged in racketeering activity to minimize the expense of 
extracting Nigerian oil so as to affect the United States, also is not sufficiently supported by evidence. First, as explained above, 
Plaintiffs have not established that Defendants' alleged racketeering activity actually did lower their costs. Second, Plaintiffs have 
not established with sufficient specificity the proportion of Defendants' Nigerian oil that was exported to the United States. See 
supra note 17. Such evidence is necessary to support Plaintiffs' claim that enough of Defendants' Nigerian oil was exported to "
1147,," the United States to establish that Defendants undertook their alleged racketeering activity in order to affect the United States, in 
addition to, or as opposed to, other countries. (Pls.' Opp'n 20.) "
1150,1," Plaintiffs note that Scottsdale Health Corporation already filed an answer to a previous iteration of the Complaint. (Pls.' Mem. of 
 [*8] Law in Opp'n to Defs.' Mot. (""Pls.' Opp'n"") at 6 n.1.) However, as Scottsdale Health Corporation has not answered Plaintiffs' 
Third Amended Complaint (""Compl.""), they may join in the Moving Defendants' Motion to Dismiss. "
1153,2," As such, the Court will not address the parties' arguments about market definition in this Order. "
1156,3," The instant case is also very different from a situation wherein a subcontractor  [*32] purchases materials from a seller, then 
charges a general contractor, who charges his customer, as in Illinois Brick. "
1159,4," Because the Court determines that the Complaint does not allege a valid business expectancy, it will not reach the parties' 
arguments about whether the harm must involve a third party. "
1161,5," Defendant Carondelet also argues that Jane Doe's request to withdraw is nothing more than a ploy to avoid complying with 
discovery requests, including sitting for a deposition. (Def. Carondolet Health Network's Resp. to Pl.'s Mot. (""Def.'s Resp."") at 2.) 
Defendant contends that the information provided about Doe ""offered tantalizing glimpses of the truly individual and unique work 
patterns that characterize the nurses who make up the proposed class."" (Id. at 8.) This argument goes to issues of class 
certification, which are not at issue in this Motion and will not be addressed at this time. "
1170,1," For purposes of this opinion, the Court defines ""OTBs"" as off-track betting sites that do not allow for advanced deposit 
wagering. Typically then, an OTB is a racetrack such as Churchill or Calder."
1170,2, The host racing association is the host racetrack. 15 U.S.C. ยง 3002(9).

by agreement of the parties."
1171,5, The purses receive 51% of the post-tax Signal Fee revenue.
1171,6," Horsemen's groups at over 40 tracks, which account for more than 65% of wagering on thoroughbred horseracing in the United 
States, have joined THG. The alliance includes the Arkansas Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Association, the Delaware 
Thoroughbred Horsemen's Association, the Florida Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Association, the Indiana Horsemen's 
Benevolent and Protective Association, the KTA, the Ky HBPA, the Louisiana Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective 
Association, the Maryland Thoroughbred  [**10] Horsemen's Association, the Minnesota Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective 
Association, the Mountaineer Park Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Association (in West Virginia), the Ohio Horsemen's 
Benevolent and Protective Association, the Oklahoma Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Association, the Pennsylvania 
Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Association, the Tampa Bay Downs Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Association, 
the Texas Horsemen's Partnership, the Thoroughbred Owners of California, and the Virginia Horsemen's Benevolent and 
Protective Association."
1171,7," The Licensing Agreement would create a contractual obligation for the ADW to pay THG. The License Fee would be allocated 
through THG to the horsemen's groups directly, bypassing the track entirely. "
1172,8, This presumes that the current Purse Share is not equal to or greater than 1/3 of the Takeout.
1172,9," The horsemen's groups who have withdrawn their consent include the Delaware Thoroughbred Horsemen's Association, the 
Ky HBPA, the Maryland Thoroughbred Horsemen's Association, and the Ohio Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective 
Association."
1172,10," Florida law permits off-track wagering within the state only on race signals that are imported by Florida tracks presently 
hosting live races, which at this time only includes Calder."
1172,11," Defendants obviously characterize the facts and claims in a different light. They deny that the horsemen's groups can be 
engaged in a group boycott because the horsemen's groups do not compete against one another for the sale of signals. "
1173,," Defendants say that the horsemen's groups play no role in controlling the pricing of the signals because the Ky HBPA contract 
with Churchill states that Churchill and the ADWs will establish the signal  [**15] price. In fact, Defendants contend that the 
horsemen's groups cannot be appropriately viewed as sellers of signals since they only provide their consent to the racetrack, 
which independently negotiates the signal sale. Further, Defendants deny that horsemen's groups can be considered 
competitors since each horsemen's group only has the power to withhold their consent from their respective racetrack's sales. Their characterization focuses on describing the horsemen's groups actions as merely ensuring the horsemen's groups' 
allocation of the revenues from ADW wagering. In so focusing, the Defendants attempt to divorce the allocation of revenues from 
the price of the signal, despite the Licensing Agreement's fee structure, which explicitly entwines revenue allocation with the 
Signal Fee. Finally, Defendants dispute whether a group boycott exists because Plaintiffs did not identify a target of the boycott 
and claim that the only potentially injured party would be the ADWs, who do not compete with the horsemen's groups."
1173,12," Plaintiffs allege that the horsemen's groups are at least indirectly competing with each other through their host racetrack. They 
explain that the host racetracks compete with each other to get ADWs, and other OTB operators, to buy their signal. 
Accordingly, the racetracks have an interest in selling their signal to as many OTB or ADW operators as possible, for the best 
price possible. The horsemen's groups benefit from this by way of their purses. Since they must consent to the sale of the signal, 
Plaintiffs contend that they are a party to the sale. Plaintiffs further contend that the horsemen's  [**17] groups and tracks are 
actually joint sellers of the right to accept wagers on races since both must consent to the contracts. In that respect, the 
horsemen's groups may also be seen as direct competitors in their joint seller capacity. See Section VI for additional discussion 
of how the horsemen's groups participate in the market for signals."
1173,13," As a threshold requirement, Plaintiffs must have Article III standing. HN5[
] Article III standing requires the plaintiff allege that 
he or she has suffered an actual injury, that is fairly traceable to the defendant's conduct, and that can likely be redressed by a 
favorable decision by the court. Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 167, 117 S. Ct. 1154, 137 L. Ed. 2d 281 (1997). Plaintiffs do not 
have standing if it is purely speculative whether their injury resulted from Defendants' conduct or whether it resulted from 
decisions made by third parties. Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 42-43, 96 S. Ct. 1917, 48 L. Ed. 2d 450 
(1976).  [**19] Churchill and Calder's injuries, the inability to sell their signals, result from the collective behavior of the 
horsemen's groups and ADWs, who are not defendants in this lawsuit. However, Plaintiffs do provide indication that if the Court 
removed the obstruction caused by the antitrust violation, Churchill and Calder could sell their signal to ADWs. Similarly, the 
allegations indicate the tracks would sell signals to Twinspires. Since the complaint alleges that Churchill and Calder have "
1174,," negotiated contracts for the 2008 season with several ADWs, which Defendants have vetoed as part of the alleged antitrust 
violation, remedying that violation could result in the contracts being approved. Plaintiffs provide the Court sufficient support to 
conclude that in this case victory would be substantially likely to result in Churchill and Calder being able to sell their signals to 
ADWs and Twinspires being able to purchase signals. Plaintiffs have Article III standing based on an alleged loss of wagering 
opportunities and an increased signal price caused by supposed anti-competitive behavior."
1174,14," Defendants' arguments regarding the application of the ""rule of reason"" and per se rule to the alleged violation are misplaced 
with regards to standing. That analysis is properly applied to determine whether an antitrust violation occurred since both 
standards assess whether the restraint on trade is unreasonable. See Bassett, 528 F.3d at 432. Since standing is determined 
under the assumption that Plaintiffs have pled an antitrust violation, analysis regarding the existence of a violation is irrelevant."
1174,15, The Court will directly address the issue of the nature of the an antitrust violation in Section VI of this opinion. 
1176,16," Defendants cite no other convincing authority to support this avenue of argument. The Fifth, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuit have 
found implied immunity arising from the Amateur Sports Act (""ASA""). Eleven Line, Inc. v. N. Tex. State Soccer Ass'n, Inc., 213 
F.3d 198 (5th Cir. 2000); Behagen v. Amateur Basketball Ass'n, 884 F.2d 524, 526 (10th Cir. 1989); JES Props., Inc. v. USA "
1177,," Equestrian, Inc., 458 F.3d 1224, 1231 (11th Cir. 2006).  [**30] The ASA authorizes the United States Olympic Commission 
(""USOC"") ""to recognize one national governing body (""NGB"") for each sport included in the program of the Olympic games."" Jes 
Props., Inc., 458 F.3d at 1229. To be recognized, the NGB must satisfy a number of requirements. Id. Although the NGBs enjoy 
a great deal of autonomy, ""the ASA provides for ongoing review of the NGB by the USOC in order to ensure compliance with the 
ASA."" Id. at 1229 (citing Behagen, 884 F.2d at 528). Not only does the ASA provide for regulatory supervision, but the circuits 
have rested their finding of immunity on the grounds that the activity at odds with antitrust law is ""necessary to implement 
Congress' intent."" Id. at 1231 (citing Behagen, 884 F.2d at 527) (emphasis in original). For the reasons explained in this 
Memorandum Opinion, the Court concludes that the antitrust activity alleged here is not so at odds with Congressional intent of 
the IHA."
1177,17," Defendants cite Washington Trotting Ass'n v. Pennsylvania Harness Horsemen's Ass'n to support the proposition that 
concerted action amongst individual horsemen could violate antitrust laws. 428 F. Supp. 122 (W.D. Pa. 1977). Although the case 
holds that individual horsemen acting together could violate antitrust laws, the case did not involve the IHA. Id. at 126. At issue 
was whether one horsemen's group could  [**33] be recognized as the sole representative of the horsemen at the track. Id. at 
124. To persuade the track to only deal with one horsemen's group, individual horsemen refused to enter their horses in races. 
Id. at 124-25. The Western District of Pennsylvania concluded that individual horsemen could independently choose not to 
participate in any track's races, but to do so in concert would violate the antitrust laws. Id. at 126. However, the Washington 
Trotter Ass'n case did not involve action under the IHA and this difference is critical. The IHA authorizes only the acts of a group, 
not an action of any individual. "
1178,18," The Supreme Court has recognized a ""'nonstatutory' labor exemption from the antitrust laws,"" implied from federal labor 
statutes. Brown, 518 U.S. at 235-36 (citing Connell Constr. Co. v. Plumbers, 421 U.S. 616, 622, 95 S. Ct. 1830, 44 L. Ed. 2d 418 
(1975); Meat Cutters v. Jewel Tea Co., 381 U.S. 676, 85 S. Ct. 1596, 14 L. Ed. 2d 640 (1965); Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 
U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965))."
1178,19," Sunkist does not clearly stand for the principle of extending individual immunity to group activity, but instead seems only to 
support the premise that legally separate entities may in reality only constitute one entity for purposes of the Capper-Volstead 
Act."
1178,20," The Court also notes that Ore-Ida only provides non-binding Ninth Circuit precedent, which for the reasons discussed it does 
not find supportive or persuasive. "
1179,21," Although the Western District of Pennsylvania concluded that some horsemen actions may be antitrust violations, its logic 
does not extend to this case."
1179,22," Defendants cite to a decision of Judge Charles Simpson of this district in which he found in open court that the IHA confers 
implied immunity from antitrust regulation. TRO Hr'g Tr., 69:16 to 69:21, Choctaw Racing Srvs., LLC v. Ky. Horsemen's 
Benevolent and Protective Ass'n, Inc., No. 07-237 (W.D. Ky. May 3, 2007) (citing JES Properties v. U.S.A. Equestrian, 458 F.3d 
1224 (11th Cir. 2006)). The activity at issue in Choctaw was  [**39] whether an individual horsemen's group's use of its veto with 
regard to a single OTB violated the antitrust laws. Compl. PP 2-3, 33, Choctaw Racing Srvs., LLC v. Ky. Horsemen's Benevolent 
and Protective Ass'n, Inc., No. 07-237 (W.D. Ky. May 5, 2007). Judge Simpson concluded that in that circumstance there was 
clear repugnancy between the IHA and anti-trust laws. TRO Hr'g Tr., 67:6 to 67:7. The implied repeal, he said, was the only way 
to ensure that the IHA's grant of the horsemen's veto to protect the entire sport of horseracing could work effectively. Id. 68:21 to 
68:23, 69:7 to 69:11, 69: 16 to 69:2. This Court agrees with the result in these circumstances, but not the analysis. For the reasons stated in the foregoing section, 
individual horsemen cannot be liable under the antitrust laws for exercising their IHA veto as part of an authorized group. Nor 
can an authorized group be liable for independently exercising its IHA veto right. Thus, neither an individual nor a group require 
immunity for their acts under the IHA. See also, Hialeah, Inc. v. Fla. Horsemen's Benevolent & Protective Ass'n, 899 F.Supp. 
616, 622 (S.D. Fla. 1995) (holding the IHA provides no antitrust immunity). Judge  [**40] Simpson relied heavily on Congressional intent in reaching his conclusion. Id. 69:2 to 69:6. He cites to Hialeah, 
899 F.Supp. at 616 and Saratoga Harness Racing v. Veneglia, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3566, 1997 WL 135946 (N.D.N.Y. 1997). 
Id. 67:6 to 68:4. However, Hialeah makes a convincing case from the legislative history on the House bill, which stated the 
""legislation in no way modifies or affects the scope or application of antitrust laws,"" that the IHA does not provide immunity from 
antitrust liability. Hialeah, 899 F. Supp. at 621. Saratoga questions that conclusion. But, the Senate did not make any mention of 
antitrust concerns and this Court is not persuaded that Congress expressed any intent to apply or repeal the antitrust laws 
through its enactment of the IHA. "
1180,23," Since Twombly expressly disavowed the previous pleading standard set forth in Conley v. Gibson courts have wrestled with its 
appropriate application. The Sixth Circuit has only addressed the issue of Twombly's pleading standard and antitrust litigation in 
a handful of decisions. Those decisions do not suggest a departure from the concept of notice pleading, but instead suggest that 
Twombly is best read as clarifying notice pleading. See e.g., Bassett v. Nat'l Collegiate Athletic Ass'n, 528 F.3d 426, 430 (6th 
Cir. 2008)  [**43] (stating Twombly does not require heightened fact pleading); Ferron v. Zoomego, Inc., 276 Fed. Appx. 473, 
2008 WL 1988587, *2 (6th Cir. 2008); Mich. Div.-Monument Builders of North America v. Mich. Cemetery Assoc., 524 F.3d 726, 
731 (6th Cir. 2008). The Second Circuit agrees that Twombly's plausibility standard does not significantly alter notice pleading. 
Weisbarth v. Geauga Park Dist., 499 F.3d 538, 542 (6th Cir. 2007) (citing Iqbal v. Hasty, 490 F.3d 143, 157-58 (2d Cir. 2007)). 
Although the Sixth Circuit has not given such an explicit analysis, at least two Sixth Circuit judges have explicitly stated such an 
understanding in dissents. Judge Martin has stated ""the key distinction is between a bare-bones complaint asserting only the 
elements of a claim and a complaint asserting not only legal elements, but also facts to support those elements."" NicSand, 507 
F.3d at 460 (Martin, dissenting) (dismissed for lack of antitrust standing). Judge Clay similarly stated, ""In other words, Twombly 
was a case where the plaintiff invoked a statute banning collusion, but failed to actually state any facts suggesting collusion."" 
Midwest Media Prop., L.L.C. v. Symmes Twp., Ohio, 503 F.3d 456, 472 n.3 (6th Cir. 2007)  [**44] (Clay, dissenting) (dismissed 
for lack of standing under redressability and the overbreadth doctrine). "
1181,24," This includes the Delaware THA, Ky HBPA,  [**50] Maryland THA, and Ohio HBPA. (Am. Compl. P 70.) "
1182,25," The Court need not address Defendants' motion to dismiss on the grounds that Hiles and Maline are immune from antitrust 
liability under the Volunteer Protection Act since those defendants have been dismissed, pursuant to 12(b)(6) and Twombly, for 
failure to state a claim. "
1183,26," The Court focuses on the per se analysis at this time given the pleadings and the Court's Twombly analysis. Since a boycott 
for the purpose of price-fixing has consistently been held as a per se illegal horizontal agreement, the Court only addresses the 
viability of that contention. If it proves  [**56] unviable, the Court may perform a rule of reason analysis following discovery."
1183,27," If Plaintiffs had pled a market for consent only, no anti-trust violation could exist. Since each horsemen's group can only give 
consent to their track, there is no market for consents. The horsemen's groups are not competitors in regards to giving their 
consent to the track because the horsemen's groups cannot offer their consent to different tracks for a different price. "
1184,28," Plaintiffs concede Defendants have not violated the anti-assignment provision by their own admission in their response brief. 
The Court will therefore dismiss any claim for breach of the anti-assignment contract provision. "
1190,1," Haines moved to amend her complaint after VeriMed filed its motion to dismiss. For reasons discussed during oral argument, I 
will grant Haines' motion to amend the complaint and will treat VeriMed's motion as though it relates to the newly amended 
pleading. "
1192,2," At oral argument the Court noted that Haines' case is seemingly indistinguishable from, for example, that of a home healthcare 
worker who works for an agency. Such a worker is not allowed to go around the agency and provide services to clients directly. 
Haines' relationship with VeriMed is functionally equivalent to this type of situation."
1192,3," VeriMed further argues in its motion to dismiss that Haines' antitrust claims must fail because Haines is unable as a matter of 
law to define a relevant geographic market for her employment services. Under proper rule of reason analysis, a court must 
make ""an inquiry into market power and market structure to assess the actual effect of the restraint."" Double D, 136 F.3d at 560 
(quoting Copperweld Corp v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 768, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1984). 
 [**12] Here, the market exists over the Internet and is, by definition, worldwide. In theory, any person anywhere is capable of 
providing to VeriMed or THCN the type of website content that these companies seek. Moreover, individual actors are always 
free to publish on the Internet by themselves. Therefore, argues VeriMed, it is not possible for any one actor to assert market 
dominance. Defendant's argument is an interesting one, but it is not a theory I need consider. Because I conclude that Haines' 
antitrust claims fail for other reasons stated here, I will not consider VeriMed's arguments relating to geographic market. "
1200,1," The parties agreed that the district court would resolve first the vertical price fixing claims with respect to only one of Bayer's 
and BASF's distributors, Univar, and that the court's resolution of the claims regarding Univar would ""set the framework for 
resolution of Plaintiffs' claims against Defendants with regard to all of their individual distributors.""  [**8] J.A. 430. Accordingly, in 
our subsequent analysis of the claims we discuss only the facts related to the agreements with Univar. "
1206,2," Because we conclude that there was no substantive ยง 1 violation, we need not reach defendants' argument that plaintiffs failed 
to prove injury as required by ยง 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 15. "
1211,1," ""Restraints imposed by agreement between competitors have traditionally been denominated as horizontal restraints, and 
those imposed by agreement between firms at different levels of distribution as vertical restraints."" Business Elecs. Corp. v. 
Sharp Elecs. Corp., 485 U.S. 717, 730, 108 S. Ct. 1515, 99 L. Ed. 2d 808 (1988). "
1213,2," Green hem-fir lumber is an inexpensive, durable wood that is often used for homebuilding. See E & L Consulting, 472 F.3d at 
26. "
1214,3," Citing Geneva Pharms., 386 F.3d 485, the Circuit noted that it has ""never held that all exclusive arrangements are reasonable 
as a matter of law."" 472 F.3d at 30. However, plaintiff has not argued, nor could it, that Geneva Pharms. is applicable to its case. 
See id. (distinguishing Geneva Pharms. as a case involving ""an allegation of two temporary, related monopolies in different 
products, a drug and its active ingredient[;] Moreover, the two firms, which had overlapping ownership, were jointly involved in 
predatory practices designed to extend their respective temporary monopolies by deterring entry by competitors."")."
1214,4," Although Plaintiff's Complaint can be construed as alleging the relevant market to be both the faux antique furniture market in 
Suffolk County as well as only Oly furniture in Suffolk County, in its opposition papers, Plaintiff limits the relevant market to the 
latter. In essence, Plaintiff argues that Oly furniture is a market in and of itself due to its uniqueness. In moving to dismiss, 
Defendants argue that not only does the Complaint fail to allege an adverse effect on competition in the relevant market, but that 
it also fails to adequately define the relevant market. Because the Court finds the Complaint deficient with respect to the former 
argument, it need not, and does not, address whether Plaintiff's market allegations are sufficient. "
1216,5," The Shields decision was superseded by statute on other grounds, Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 78u-4, 
as recognized in In re Paracelsus Corp. Sec. Litig., 61 F. Supp. 2d 591, 595 (S.D. Tex. 1998). "
1228,1," Having received proposed findings of fact from both parties, the court will not enter separate findings of fact, but will incorporate 
its findings in this memorandum."
1228,2, Section 271(d) states that: 
1229,," (d) No patent owner otherwise entitled to relief for infringement or contributory infringement of a patent shall be denied relief 
or deemed guilty of misuse or illegal extension of the patent right by reason of his having done one or more of the following: 
(1) derived revenue from acts which if performed by another without his consent would constitute contributory infringement 
of the patent; (2) licensed or authorized another to perform acts which if performed without his consent would constitute 
contributory infringement of the patent; (3) sought to enforce his patent rights against infringement or contributory 
infringement; (4) refused to license or use any rights to the patent; or (5) conditioned the license of any rights to the patent 
or the sale of the patented product on the acquisition of a license to rights in another patent or purchase of a separate 
product, unless, in view of the circumstances, the patent owner has market power in the relevant  [*6] market for the patent 
or patented product on which the license or sale is conditioned."
1229,3," Although  [*10] there are sixteen different licensees, Shure's claims actually encompass nineteen license agreements. Two of 
the licensees -- Aloft Technologies, Inc. and Antonio Precise Products Manufactory, Ltd. -- entered into multiple license 
agreements with HCI. "
1231,4," The '076 patent expired in December 2006. Shure alleges that the license agreements HCI entered into after that date with six 
new licensees -- all licensees with an ""N/A"" in this column except Aloft Technologies, Inc. and Antonio Precise Products 
Manufactory, Ltd. -- licensed the '076 patent after it had expired. "
1234,5," Mr. Crompton testified during the bench  [*15] trial that the Korean equivalent does not expire until 2013. This may have been a 
misstatement, as Dr. Ugone cites earlier testimony and e-mails from Mr. Crompton in which he states that the foreign 
equivalents expire in 2010 or 2011, depending on the country. No matter which date is used, the point is that Shure does not 
dispute that the foreign equivalents of the patents-in-suit have not yet expired. "
1235,6," The analogy is apt, since patent misuse and antitrust violations, while not identical, are related causes of action. See, e.g., 
Bard, 157 F.3d at 1372 (""Patent misuse is viewed as a broader wrong than antitrust violation because of the economic power 
that may be derived from the patentee's right to exclude. Thus, misuse may arise when the conditions of antitrust violation are 
not met. . .The key inquiry is whether, by imposing conditions that derive their force from the patent, the patentee has 
impermissibly broadened the scope of the patent grant with anticompetitive  [*17] effect."")"
1235,7," Perhaps marking a product with United States patent numbers gives a certain cachet in some foreign countries, just as the 
word ""French"" seems to increase sales of perfume here. It is up to that country, rather than this court, to decide whether using 
an expired United States patent number harms its citizens. "
1238,8," Brulotte, which only states that requiring payment of royalties after the last of the licensed patents expired is patent misuse, is 
not to the contrary and in fact specifically distinguishes the situation where only some of the licensed patents have expired. 
Brulotte, 379 U.S. at 33, 85 S. Ct. at 179; see also Hull v. Brunswick Corp., 704 F.2d 1195 (10th Cir. 1983) (""Although the royalty 
rate does not change, the base for that rate changes. . .The lack of diminution in royalty rate for the use of one patent without 
another and the provisions for termination do not of themselves establish coercion."") (internal quotation omitted); In re Yarn 
Processing Patent Validity Litigation, 541 F.2d 1127, 1141-42 (5th Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 433 U.S. 910, 97 S. Ct. 2976, 53 
L. Ed. 2d 1094 (1977) (provision that escalated royalties for one patent in package after expiration of another patent did

2000) (""the royalty rate need not diminish as patents included in a package license expire, as long as the licensee is not

1254,1," The EMMC's motion is one for partial summary judgment as it does not seek summary judgment at this time on plaintiffs' 
claims for monopolization, attempted monopolization or claims under Section 7 of the Clayton Act."
1254,2," The following defendants are included as ""certain defendants"" in the EMMC's motion: Eastern Mushroom Marketing 
Cooperative, Inc.; Kaolin Mushroom Farms, Inc.; To-Jo Fresh Mushrooms, Inc.; Cardile Mushrooms, Inc.; Mario Cutone 
Mushroom Co., Inc.; Cardile Bros. Mushrooms, Packaging; Monterey Mushrooms, Inc.; Phillips Mushrooms Farms, LP; Modern

Mushroom Sales, Inc.; United Mushroom Farms Cooperative, Inc.; and Country Fresh Farms, Inc. The following defendants joined  [**26] in the motion filed by the EMMC defendants: M.D. Basciani & Sons, Inc.; Mushroom 
Alliance, Inc.; Kitchen Pride Mushrooms; JM Farms; and Franklin Farms."
1255,3," Defendants Masha & Toto, Inc., T/A M&T Mushrooms and W&P Mushroom Inc. have not joined in or filed separate motions for 
summary judgment."
1255,4, The motion to strike is to exclude the portions of defendants' motions that are beyond the scope of Phase One discovery. 
1256,5," Some defendants rely on the final judgment of the DOJ in asserting that the EMMC is properly formed under the Capper-
Volstead Act. However, the Competitive Impact Statement specifically states that ""the Final Judgment has no prima facie effect 
in any subsequent lawsuits that may be brought against the Defendants."" "
1258,6," Defendants Mushroom Alliance, Kitchen Pride, Basciani & Sons, Inc., JM Farms, Michael Pia, John Pia, Giorgio Foods Inc., 
Gaspari Bros. Inc., and LRP Mushroom Inc. claim that regardless of the exemption determination their motions for summary 
judgment on plaintiffs' claims against them should be granted. Because Phase One discovery was narrowly focused on facts 
implicating the Capper-Volstead exception, I will dismiss without prejudice all of defendants' arguments not pertaining to Capper-
Volstead because resolution at this stage would be premature.  [**38] While some of the discovery may have allowed for 
plaintiffs to discover facts relating to defendants' individualized arguments, the nature of the Capper-Volstead exemption did not 
require plaintiffs to do so at this stage and I find sufficient their Rule 56(f) affidavit stating that discovery on such issues is still 
necessary. "
1259,7," Plaintiffs also argue that the Capper-Volstead immunity is destroyed because (1) defendants fail to satisfy the 50% rule to 
qualify as a valid cooperative for Capper-Volstead exemption; (2) defendants entered into multiple agreements  [**41] with 
persons or entities not engaged in agricultural production in addition to their actions of fixing prices; and (3) defendants engaged 
in the types of anticompetitive and predatory practices that fall outside the legitimate objects of an agricultural cooperative. As 
plaintiffs need only prove one defect that deprives defendant of exemption under Capper-Volstead and genuine issues of 
material fact exist as to many of these arguments, I need not address each argument and the legal issues they raise if I find one 
sufficient to destroy the exemption."
1259,8," HN9[
] Specifically, defendants must establish that the EMMC is a valid Capper-Volstead cooperative by showing all of the 
following: 1) all of the members of the cooperative are producers of agricultural products; 2) each member of the cooperative 
only gets one vote regardless of its size; 3) the cooperative ""does not pay dividends on stock or membership capital in excess of 
8 per centum per annum;"" and 4) at least 50% of the products dealt with by the cooperative are products of its members. 7 
U.S.C. ยง 291. The last element is commonly referred to as the 50% Rule."
1259,9," Thus, some defendants' arguments that they are proper members of the EMMC are irrelevant."
1259,10," Defendants claims that Ripplemeyer should be read in full. In Ripplemeyer, both the parent and subsidiary were members of 
the agricultural cooperative and the court found that inclusion of the non-grower processor as a member destroyed Capper-
Volstead immunity but that the two entities could not conspire because their parent-subsidiary relationship meant that they were 
not separate entities capable of conspiring. Ripplemeyer, 807 F. Supp. at 1459. I find M. Cutone to be an improper member of 
the EMMC for the same reason that the processor in Ripplemeyer destroyed immunity. And here, unlike in Ripplemeyer, the 
grower entity affiliated with M. Cutone, M & V Enterprises, was not a member of the cooperative. "
1260,11," The Alexander Court noted that the NFO was exactly the kind of ""populist farm organization contemplated by the Capper 
Volstead Act."" Alexander, 687 F.2d at 1186-87. The court cited Justice Brennan's concurrence in Nat'l Broiler, noting that the 
Capper-Volstead Act was designed to allow farmers to band together ""in order to survive against the economically dominant 
manufacturing, supplier, and purchasing interests with which they had to interrelate"" Nat'l Broiler, 436 U.S. at 830, and that it 
would be ""cruelly ironic to exempt large co-ops [that are] professionally managed  [**47] and operated by many non-farmers-
while denying exemption to the farmers who banded together in NFO."" Alexander, 687 F.2d at 1186-87. However, the EMMC appears to be exactly the kind of cooperative foreseen in Justice Brennan's concurrence and discussed in 
United States v. Hinote, 823 F. Supp. 1350, 1358 (S.D. Miss. 1993): HN12[
] a cooperative made of ""fully integrated 
producer[s] of agricultural products performing its own processing . . . and which hence does not associate for purposes of 
common handling, processing, and marketing is nevertheless 'engaged in the production of agricultural products as [a] farme (r]' 
for purposes of ยง 1's exemption . . . if also engaged in traditional farming activity."" Nat'l Broiler, 436 U.S. at 834. I will discuss 
below whether members of the EMMC are properly integrated so as to be considered a single entity that produces and 
distributes. It is troubling that the EMMC appears to have been organized for the benefit of mushroom distributors, whether fully integrated 
or whether affiliated, rather than for the benefit of the grower members. This is demonstrated by the fact that dues were based 
not on the pounds grown by the member growers but by the total number  [**48] of pounds sold by the affiliated or integrated 
distributors. Under this system, some small growers contributing under 25% of the total pounds of mushrooms sold by their 
affiliated distributor paid dues based on the distributors' sales, not their own. This cannot but harm growers. Additionally, the 
price fixing in which the EMMC admits it participated was applied to integrated and affiliated distributors' sales and not at the 
growers level. Additionally, the EMMC did not have pure growers unaffiliated with a distributor as members; instead, it helped 
them to organize the EMMCGA which was to benefit pure growers. In combination, these undisputed facts show that protecting 
true growers was not the purpose of the organization. While the cooperative ""give[s] the set-up the color of a producer rather "
1261,," than a handler[,] [t]he plan adopted was ingenious but transparent."" See United States v. Elm Spring Farm, Inc., 38 F. Supp. 
508, 511 (D. Mass. 1941)."
1261,12," Defendants also suggest that the Nat'l Broiler line of cases does not apply to distributors like M. Cutone but merely to 
processors. However, Nat'l Broiler includes both processors and distributors in its conception of the middlemen from whom 
 [**49] Capper-Volstead and related exemptions to anti-trust laws were created to protect farmers and producers. Nat'l Broiler, 
436 U.S. at 825-826, noting that the Capper-Volstead Act was passed because ""[f]armers were seen as being caught in the 
hands of processors and distributors who, because of their position in the market and their relative economic strength, were able 
to take from the farmer a good share of whatever profits might be available from agricultural production. By allowing farmers to 
join together in cooperatives, Congress hoped to bolster their market strength and to improve their ability to weather adverse 
economic periods and to deal with processors and distributors,"" emphasis added."
1261,13," As I have found that the EMMC is not exempt under Capper-Volstead  [**50] by including M. Cutone as a member when it is 
not a grower, it was not necessary that I extend my analysis to other members of the EMMC which plaintiffs allege have 
problematic memberships including Leone Pizzini and Son, Inc., Brownstone Mushroom Farms, Inc., and LRP-M Mushrooms 
LLC, I make no determination at this time as to whether genuine issues of material fact exist as to these members"
1261,14," Plaintiffs also argue that defendants engaged in price fixing with affliated distributors Masha and Buona. I will not consider the 
issue of whether a conspiracy exists with these entities because it appears that genuine issues of material fact may exist. I need "
1262,," not make such a determination at this time, however, because the relevant facts with regard to with Kaolin/South Mill distribution 
centers and Manfredini Enterprises are undisputed."
1262,15," Defendants also claim that they are a proper cooperative because they are set up to allow some of their growers to have the 
packaging and sale of their produce done through wholly-owned affiliates as was the case in the re-organized Sunkist 
cooperative examined in Case--Swayne Co. v. Sunkist Growers, Inc.., 355 F. Supp. 408 (C.D. Cal. 1971) and the lettuce 
producer cooperative in N. Cal. Supermarkets Inc. v. Cent. Cal. Lettuce Producers' Coop., 413 F. Supp. 984 (N.D. Cal. 1976). 
However, these cases are distinguishable. First, the reorganized Sunkist cooperative's structure eliminated the non-grower members that were at issue in Sunkist II. 
Sunkist, 355 F. Supp. at 413, 415. Instead these entities became licensed packing houses with contracts with the growers or 
local cooperative to provide packaging services. Id. Some growers had their own packaging facilities. Id. However, the licensed 
packing houses had no vote, control or property rights in Sunkist. Id. at 415. While mushroom  [**56] growers sold their 
mushrooms to the distributors who resold them at the cooperative's fixed price, the growers in Sunkist did not sell their product 
to these packagers. The growers in Sunkist sold their produce through the cooperative. Id. at 412. Additionally, in N. Cal. Supermarkets Inc. the facts provide no indication that varying ownerships existed in the case and the 
analysis did not involve the issue of conspiracy and status as a single entity; thus the case was not helpful in my analysis of the 
organizational structures in this case. N. Cal. Supermarkets Inc., 413 F. Supp. at 985-94. Instead, it appears the member 
defendants involved were all ""growershippers."" Id. at 986. "
1263,16," The common economic goals included the franchisor acting to minimize  [**60] competition and promote uniformity between 
franchises, each franchise benefitting from an enhanced reputation for uniformity in quality results and economic unity of interest 
continuing beyond the payment by the franchisee of the licensing fee to the franchisor receiving a royalty fee and a marketing 
fee based upon a percentage of the restaurants' gross sales. Williams, 794 F. Supp. at 1032. "
1265,17," The argument that Kaolin contracted with the distribution centers to sell at EMMC prices does not change the facts that these 
entities were selling at EMMC prices and that the owners of the member grower were advocating for the benefit of the 
distribution centers they also partly owned instead of at a level that benefitted their grower entity."
1265,18," Although I do not so conclude, holding that these entities are a single entity would permit cooperatives to avoid  [**66] the 50 
% rule by counting only the mushrooms of the member growers in the calculations rather than using the affiliated distributors' 
mushrooms. This would create a loophole to benefit distributors contrary to the Capper-Volstead exemption's stated purpose of 
benefitting growers. Although in this case the defendants appear to have included affiliated distributor sales in their 50% 
calculation, the treatment of these entities as a single unit with the member grower for purposes of the 50% rule does not alter 
the analysis of whether they legally are a single unit. "
1268,1," WPMCA cites Baude v. Heath, 538 F.3d 608 (7th Cir. 2008) for the proposition that ""an economic interest is by itself enough to 
allow a trade association to intervene."" Baude contains no discussion of the interest required for mandatory intervention under 
Rule 24(a)(2). Judge Easterbrook  [*7] merely mentioned in passing that a trade association ""intervened to protect its economic 
interest."" Id. at 612. "
1269,2," Because WPMCA does not have a an interest sufficient to allow intervention as of right, it is unnecessary to consider whether 
WPMCA has standing to intervene in this case. ""Some disagreement remains among the circuits about how Article III standing 
rules intersect with the requirements for Rule 24 intervention. . . . From a pragmatic standpoint, this court has observed that 
'[a]ny interest of such magnitude [as to support Rule 24(a) intervention of right] is sufficient to satisfy the Article III standing 
requirement as well.'"" Sokaogon Chippewa Community v. Babbitt, 214 F.3d 941, 946 (7th Cir. 2000)  [*10] (internal citations 
omitted). "
1270,3," See Fuchs v. Rural Electric Convenience Cooperative, 858 F.2d 1210 (7th Cir. 1988). The Court does not agree that Fuchs is 
controlling. "
1273,1," For purposes of Defendants' motion to dismiss, the Court assumes as true all well-pleaded allegations set forth in the 
complaint. See, e.g., Killingsworth v. HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A., 507 F.3d 614, 618 (7th Cir. 2007). "
1274,2," Tying claims typically are brought under Section 3 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. ยง 14), whose language explicitly deals with 
tying, but also may be brought under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Will v. Comprehensive Accounting Corp., 776 F.2d 665, 669 
(7th Cir. 1985). "
1275,3," Indeed, it is far from clear, for instance, that Harley-Davidson dealers sell only Harley-Davidson motorcycles, have ""Harley-
Davidson"" in their names, or use Harley-Davidson logos. See, e.g., Compl. P 11 (describing the custom-printed bags as 
containing the dealership's logo). "
1277,4," For example, tying sales of right shoes to left shoes generally cannot be said to reduce consumer welfare or restrain trade. 
See, e.g., HERBERT HOVENKAMP, FEDERAL ANTITRUST POLICY: THE LAW OF COMPETITION AND ITS PRACTICE ยง 
10.2 at 399 (West Publishing Co. 2005) (describing the role of judicial tests as devices for producing ""an inference that a 
particular tying arrangement injures consumers as a group""); see also Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 25 (observing that ""there is 
nothing inherently anticompetitive about packaged sales"")."
1277,5," The tying formulation in Reifert might be viewed as retrenching from the earlier formulation in Carl Sandburg, which some 
commentators have questioned. See HOVENKAMP ยง 10.4a at 412 & nn.14-16 (concluding that requiring proof of market power 
in the tied market ""seems to be a castoff of [a] generally discredited"" economic theory of tying harm). But see Sheridan, 530 F.3d 
at 592 (""The traditional antitrust concern with [tying] is that * * * the result [of the tie] will be  [*17] a second monopoly""); A.O. 
Smith Corp. v. Lewis, Overbeck & Furman, 979 F.2d 546, 549 (7th Cir. 1992) (per Carl Sandburg, substantial danger of 
acquisition of market power over the tied product must be proved in a tying case). "
1278,6," See Illinois Tool Works Inc. v. Independent Ink, 547 U.S. 28, 126 S. Ct. 1281, 164 L. Ed. 2d 26 (2006) (plaintiff must 
demonstrate market power over the tying product)."
1278,7," Defendant also argues that Plaintiff has failed to allege what the ""tied market"" is. Def.'s Mem. at 9. It is true that ""any inquiry 
into the validity of a tying arrangement must focus on the market or markets in which the two products are sold."" Jefferson 
Parish, 466 U.S. at 18. However, Harley-Davidson has presented no authority for the proposition that Plaintiff's complaint must 
define the market. Part of the confusion on the matter, and accompanying lack of precision in Plaintiff's complaint, seemingly 
stems from the fact that Plaintiff does not know whether Harley-Davidson makes customized merchandise bags or only non-
customized merchandise bags. "
1285,1," Xerox also argues that Media Sciences's antitrust counterclaims are barred by the specific release provision also contained in 
P 18 of the Settlement Agreement, which provides: ""[Media Sciences] specifically releases any claims it may have against 
XEROX . . . in any way arising out of or related to . . . XEROX's Peak marketing program[] as currently written."" (Xerox Mem. 
Supp. Mot. S.J. at 7; Ko Decl. Exh. A at P 18.) However, in its Amended Reply and Affirmative Defense, Xerox alleges only that 
Media Sciences's cannot bring its antitrust counterclaims under P 18 of the Settlement Agreement so long as Xerox continues to 
have a good faith belief that Media Sciences's ink causes failures and material problems in Xerox solid ink printers. (Xerox 
Amend. Reply at P 57.) Because the Court decides Xerox's motion on the only ground alleged in  [**14] its Amended Reply, the 
Court does not further address the specific release provision of P 18."
1285,2," As noted above, P 25.1 provides: The only issue to be resolved in any such arbitration is whether during the six months period prior to the date of the 
arbitration demand, and taking into account the proportionate volume of ink sold, such ink has caused failures or material 
problems in XEROX solid ink [printers] at a materially higher proportionate rate than such problems or failures were caused, 
if at all, by use of XEROX solid ink in the applicable models of printers at issue. The factual determination of the arbitration 
shall be final and binding on the parties and thepparty demanding the arbitration shall have the burden of proof. (Ko Decl. Exh. A at P 25.1.) Thus, contrary to Media Sciences's suggestion, the arbitration does not concern Xerox's subjective 
state of mind, but rather an objective determination of product performance. "
1286,3," Citing In re Currency Conversion Fee Antitrust Litig., 361 F. Supp. 2d 237, 258 (S.D.N. Y. 2005), Media Sciences also argues 
in one paragraph that ""if Xerox truly believed  [**17] that an arbitration of its good faith belief was a precondition to any suit, 
Xerox was required to demand such an arbitration,"" and request a stay in the current litigation to do so. (MS Opp. at 9.) Because 
the plain language of the Settlement Agreement does not permit Xerox to demand arbitration until nine months after Media 
Sciences prevailed in a previous arbitration initiated by Media Sciences as provided in P 25, (see Ko Decl. Exh. A at P 25, 25.3), 
which Media Sciences has admittedly not done, (see MS Opp. at 8), the Court rejects this argument. "

certain antitrust actions), that market share of 90 percent ""is enough to constitute a monopoly; it is doubtful whether sixty or 
sixty-four percent would be enough; and certainly thirty-three per cent is not."" Our Circuit subsequently held that a market share 
of 20 percent, standing alone, is presumptively inadequate to permit a finding of dangerous probability of success and that even 
a share of 30 percent might be insufficient. H.L. Hayden Co. of N.Y. v. Siemens Med. Systs., Inc., 879 F.2d 1005, 1018 (2d Cir.

1336,3," Rule 19 no longer uses the word ""necessary,"" but rather refers to parties who should be joined if feasible. See Provident

1337,," version (of the Rule) emphasizes the pragmatic consideration of the effects of the alternatives of proceeding or dismissing, the 
older version tended to emphasize classification of parties as 'necessary' or 'indispensable.'""); Janney, 11 F.3d at 404 n. 4 (""The 
term necessary in referring to a Rule 19(a) analysis harks back to an earlier version of Rule 19. It survives in case law at the 
price of  [*25] some confusion.""). The parties, however, discuss Royo's joinder in this action in terms of whether he is 
""necessary"" and ""indispensable."" "
1339,4," Royo's non-compete agreement with Graco ended on February 9, 2008. Compl. P 72. Thus, there is no current bar to his 
employment in the IPPE group of products. Hence, Garraf may continue to employ Royo so long as he works in a lawful manner, 
and does not disclose Graco trade secrets, if any."
1339,5," However, even if Royo is necessary under Rule 19(a), he is not indispensable under Rule 19(b). In this case, the parties agree 
that there is no personal jurisdiction over Spanish employee Royo, see Pl. Opp. at 52-54; therefore, joinder is not feasible and 
the Court ""determine[s] whether, in equity and good conscience, the action should proceed among the existing  [*34] parties or 
should be dismissed"" pursuant to Rule 19(b). Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(b). The Rule lists four non-exhaustive factors that the Court 
should weigh, including: ""(1) the extent to which a judgment rendered in the person's absence might prejudice that person or the 
existing parties; (2) the extent to which any prejudice could be lessened or avoided by: (A) protective provisions in the judgment; 
(B) shaping the relief; or (C) other measures; (3) whether a judgment rendered in the person's absence would be adequate; and 
(4) whether the plaintiff would have an adequate remedy if the action were dismissed for nonjoinder."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(b); see 
Gardiner v. Virgin Islands Water & Power Authority, 145 F.3d 635, 640, 39 V.I. 519 (3d Cir. 1998). With respect to the first factor, PMC Defendants claim that Royo would be prejudiced by exposure to inconsistent obligations if 
judgment were rendered in his absence. Plaintiffs, however, contend that resolution of ""this action would not subject Royo to 
inconsistent obligations due to the action pending in Spain against him[ because: (1)] the Spanish action deals only with Royo's 
obligations under his severance agreement with Graco/Gusmer and not whether his  [*35] company used Graco's trade secrets 
or violated the rights at issue in this lawsuit[; and (2)] Rule 19 is simply not supported by 'the real possibility that one court could 
find [Defendants] liable while another court was finding [the absent party] not liable in separate proceedings to which the rules of 
claim or issue preclusion do not apply.'"" Pl. Opp. at 52-53 (quoting General Refractories Co. v. First State Ins. Co., 500 F.3d 
306, 318 (3d Cir. 2007) (internal quotations and citations omitted)). Plaintiffs, however, do not provide the Court with a copy of 
the Complaint or Certification with regard to the subject matter of the Spanish action. The Court cannot rely on Plaintiffs' limited 
allegations in its Opposition. Therefore, the Court is unaware of what the implications are of the Spanish action. In addition, PMC Defendants contend that Royo's and Garraf's interests may or may not align, so ""there is no certainty that the 
interests of [Royo] will be adequately represented"" if this litigation proceeds. See Home Am. Credit, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
19561, 1997 WL 793047, at *4. However, if a potential defendant does not wish to intervene and be a party to the suit, this fact 
""strongly suggest[s] that its interests  [*36] will not be impeded if the suit goes forward without [him]."" Gardiner, 145 F.3d at 641. 
Royo has not sought to intervene here. Accordingly, ""there is little danger of prejudice to [Royo]."" Id. Thus, the first factor weighs 
against indispensability. With respect to the second and third factors, Graco asserts that it is interested in obtaining relief against the named parties, 
including ""Royo's company"" in the form of an injunction and monetary relief. Graco contends this remedy will be adequate. PMC 
Defendants, however, argue that an injunction against Garraf would similarly enjoin Royo, without providing him the opportunity 
to defend himself with regard to any disclosed trade secrets. Defendants rely on Home Am. Credit for support. If, however, Royo "
1340,," finds that he needs to ""defend himself"" in this action with respect to disclosing any alleged trade secrets, he may intervene. 
Gardiner, 145 F.3d at 641. Otherwise, the Court can shape the relief here, because Royo's agreement not to compete ended on 
February 9, 2008. Compl. P 72. Therefore, proceeding here will not affect Royo's employment on these grounds. Therefore, the 
second and third factors weigh against indispensability. With respect  [*37] to the fourth factor, the Plaintiff argues that when there is a lack of a practical ""assurance that the plaintiff, if 
dismissed, could sue effectively in another forum where better joinder would be possible,"" this consideration ""counsels strongly 
against dismissal."" Gen. Refractories Co. v. First State Ins. Co., 500 F.3d at 306, 321 (3d Cir. 2007) (citing Gardiner, 145 F.3d at 
642). In this case, there are multiple parties domestic and foreign, who have contracted to apply New Jersey law, and thus, it 
appears that there is not another more effective, appropriate, or practical forum where better joinder would be possible. This 
factor weighs strongly against dismissal and against indispensability. See Id. Moreover, PMC Defendants fail to put forth any persuasive arguments for a finding that Royo is indispensable. In light of Third 
Circuit precedent, the Court agrees that the indispensability factors pursuant to Rule 19(b) weigh against dismissal for failure to 
join an indispensable party. Accordingly, because the action can proceed in equity and good conscience, Royo is not necessary 
or indispensable under Rule 19(a) or 19(b), respectively, the Court denies PMC Defendants' motion to dismiss  [*38] Plaintiffs' 
Complaint pursuant to Rule 19."
1340,6," Garraf asserts that allegations that Garraf is an ""affiliate"" of Gama, that PMC Europe has an ownership or other financial 
interest in Garraf, or that PMC Europe is a partial owner of the real estate where Garraf's headquarters is located, insufficient to 
establish an agency relationship. Compl. PP 7, 57. "
1342,7," Defendants also argue that any attempt to restrain Commette should be summarily rejected because a ""former employee 
cannot be enjoined from using his or her experience in the industry as a basis for earning a living."" Subcarrier Communications, 
Inc. v. Day, 299 N.J. Super. 634, 643, 691 A.2d 876 (App. Div. 1997). This argument, however, is irrelevant to Count One of 
Plaintiff's Complaint. "
1343,8," When a plaintiff's claims are based upon documents that are expressly relied upon or integral to the complaint, the court may 
consider such documents on a motion to dismiss. See Adamson v. Ortho-McNeil Pharm., Inc., 463 F. Supp. 2d 496, 500 (D.N.J. 
2006) (citing In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1426 (3d Cir. 1997)). "
1344,9," PMC Defendants' arguments that goodwill was not part of the contract is a defense that will not be entertained by the Court on 
a motion to dismiss. "
1345,10," Defendants also claim that the Court is not ""constrained to accept the allegations of the complaint in respect of the 
construction of the Agreement."" Int. Audiotext Network, Inc. v. AT&T Co., 62 F.3d 69, 72 (2d Cir. 1995). Plaintiffs correctly argue, 
however, that Int. Audiotext Network holds only that a court has the ability to review a document mentioned in -- but not attached 
to -- the complaint, without converting the motion to dismiss into a summary judgment action. Id."
1345,11," Because the Court does not dismiss this claim, PMC Defendants request a more definite statement pursuant to Rule 12(e). 
PMC Defendants claim that the documents Plaintiffs expressly rely on are integral to their claims, and without these documents, 
Plaintiffs' allegations are too vague and ambiguous for Commette and other PMC Defendants to respond. Defendants request 
that Plaintiffs clearly state which contracts are valid or in effect, which contracts have been superseded or void, and which 
contracts it is seeking to enforce because in their Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that  [*59] there were contracts with Commette and 
Royo from 2003 and 2004, and a subsequent contract with Commette in 2006. PMC Dfs. Mot. at 9; Compl. PP 26, 47. In their 
Opposition, Plaintiffs make clear that their claim against Commette for breach of his nondisclosure agreement is based on the 
May 16, 2006 Non-Disclosure Agreement. See Pl. Opp. at 18. The Court denies PMC Defendants' request at this time because these records can be provided in discovery. ""It is not the 
function of 12(e) to provide greater particularization of information alleged in the complaint or which presents a proper subject for 
discovery. The basis for granting such a motion is unintelligibility, not lack of detail."" MK Strategies, LLC v. Ann Taylor Stores 
Corp., 567 F. Supp. 2d 729, 737 (D.N.J. 2008) (internal citations and quotations omitted). In this case, Graco sufficiently alleges 
a claim of breach of a non-disclosure agreement and its allegations are not so vague, ambiguous or unintelligible that PMC 
Defendants cannot respond in good faith. Accordingly, Defendants' request pursuant to Rule 12(e) is denied. "
1346,12," Graco asserts that after Commette's employment with it ended in March 2007, Commette visited Gusmer's Lakewood, New 
Jersey facility and asked a Graco employee about the status of the inventory of Gusmer's ""Mighty Mite"" products, which Graco 
had acquired from PMC Global. Id. P 50. PMC Global and Graco allegedly had an agreement in which PMC Global was to 
reimburse Graco for any inventory not sold in three years. Id. P 51. Commette allegedly told a Graco employee that he was 
interested in the status of this inventory because PMC Global owed him compensation for it. Id. P 52. Graco asserts that any 
agreement by Commette to sell the Mighty-Mite inventory was 'contrary to the interests of Graco.'"" Pl. Opp. at 20-21 (quoting 
Compl. P 99). Plaintiffs do not allege that Commette actually had an agreement with anyone during his employment with Graco 
nor that he intended to purchase this inventory while he was employed. Rather its allegations that Commette was acting as a 
speculator  [*63] for this inventory in March 2007 was well after he stopped working for Graco on October 20, 2006."
1346,13," Graco argues that PMC Defendants do not dispute its tortious interference with contract claim, specifically, Commette's 
alleged non-disclosure agreement, and therefore it should be deemed admitted. Pl. Opp. at 21 n. 6. Thereafter, however, in their 
Reply, PMC Defendants clearly dispute the sufficiency of the allegations for this claim. They do not request dismissal of this 
claim on its own. Rather they dispute that Graco sufficiently pled the existence of the underlying agreement with which they 
allegedly interfered. PMC Dfs. Reply at 8 n. 3. "
1347,," On the other hand, Garraf outrightly disputes that Plaintiffs have sufficiently pled a claim for tortious interference with a contract. 
Garraf Mot. at 7-8. However, Garraf contends that Plaintiffs do not address why this claim should be dismissed with respect to 
Garraf. See Garraf Reply at 8 n. 3. The Court will address the sufficiency of Plaintiffs' tortious interference claims, with respect to 
both a contractual relationship and prospective  [*65] economic advantage, as to all Defendants."
1347,14," The Court notes that the Third Circuit has rejected a heightened evidentiary requirement for tortious interference claims, and it 
follows that there would be no heightened pleading standard for such claims. See Fineman, 980 F.2d at 186-87. "
1349,15," Garraf disputes  [*75] Graco's assertion that Royo, former Gusmer employee, co-founded Gama. Further Garraf asserts the 
PMC Defendants' statement to that effect in their brief, PMC Dfs. Mot. at 2, is inaccurate and is not binding on it. See Garraf 
Reply at 2 n. 1. Garraf also contends that Graco's claim that Royo and Commette's attendance at trade shows was improper does not support 
Graco's claims against them. Garraf Reply at 6 n. 2; Compl. PP 61-62, 66-71."
1349,16," Citing Sun Dial Corp. v. Rideout, 25 N.J. Super. 591, 598, 96 A.2d 788 (N.J. Super. Ch. 1953), rev'd, 29 N.J. Super. 361, 365, 
102 A.2d 90 (App. Div. 1954), aff'd, 16 N.J. 252, 108 A.2d 442 (1954), Garraf argues that the ""knowledge and skill which is 
obtained through experience is not a trade secret, that sound public policy favors employees bettering themselves, and that 
employees may carry away and use the skill acquired during the course of an employment either in business for themselves or 
in the service of other employers."" Plaintiffs, however, contend that its ""desire to protect its trade secrets and confidential 
information is not an attempt to hold its former employees 'hostage' because they are 'cursed' with the skill and knowledge of 
being competent at their chosen profession."" Pl.  [*76] Opp. at 28 (quoting Garraf Mot. at 6). Rather, Graco's claims against 
Commette (and other employees working for Defendants) are based on more than disclosure of ""mere skill and knowledge of the 
trade generally, but technical and business trade secrets imparted to them in confidence,"" which Defendants are obliged to 
honor. Pl. Opp. at 28-29 (citing Sun Dial Corp., 16 N.J. at 260-61). Because these arguments go beyond sufficiency of the 
pleadings and are not appropriately addressed on a motion to dismiss, the Court will not consider them here. "
1350,17," Plaintiffs contend that despite Garraf's suggestion that a preliminary injunction may not be available to Plaintiffs because they 
did not move for such relief at the outset of the case, see Garraf Mot. at 3, this should not be addressed at this time because it is 
not currently moving for that relief. See Pl. Opp. at 29-30. The Court agrees and will not address this issue at this time. Further, Garraf discusses the relief available when relying on the inevitable disclosure doctrine. See Garraf Reply at 7. In this 
case, Graco does not assert or plead reliance on a theory of inevitable discovery to satisfy its pleading requirement, see Pl. 
 [*78] Opp. at 29, and thus, such a discussion is unnecessary."
1350,18," Graco states that despite Defendants' allegations, it does not claim that the price of steel, see Garraf Mot. at 5, the pending 
patent on the Hybrid Heater, see Id. at 3-4; PMC Dfs. Mot. at 12, or customer information posted on the Internet, see PMC Dfs. 
Mot. at 13, are trade secrets or the bases of Plaintiffs' trade secret claim. Pl. Opp. at 27."
1350,19," Moreover, at least one court in this District has held that ""[i]n appropriate circumstances, information on pricing, discounts and 
other relevant customer data may enable an agent to take unfair advantage of its principal and therefore  [*81] constitute 
protectible trade secrets."" See Apollo Techs. Corp. v. Centrosphere Indus. Corp., 805 F. Supp. 1157, 1204 (D.N.J. 1992) 
(internal citations omitted). In addition, in Global Transp. Logistics, Inc. v. Dov Transp., the court denied summary judgment 
where the facts were ""hotly controverted"" and the plaintiff claimed that its ""pricing, customer preferences, customer contacts, "
1351,," profit margin, vendors and 'methods of operation' [we]re proprietary and confidential."" No. BER-C-79-05, 2005 WL 1017602, at 
*1-5 (N.J. Super. Ct. Apr. 5, 2005)."
1351,20," Problematically, Plaintiffs do not clearly allege pursuant to which provisions of the Lanham Act they are suing citing generally 
to 15 U.S.C. ยง 1125(a)(1). See Compl. PP 118-123. The Court looks to its Opposition for clarity, but relies on Plaintiffs' 
Complaint to determine the sufficiency of Graco's allegations."
1351,21," Garraf states that it does not analyze Plaintiffs' claims under the New Jersey Fair Trade Act and common law unfair 
competition separately because under New Jersey law the pleading requirements for these claims are the same as the analysis 
for unfair competition under the Lanham Act. See Garraf Mot. at 8 n. 3 (citing Primepoint, L.L.C. v. PrimePay, Inc., 545 F. Supp. 
2d 426, 431-32 (D.N.J. 2008)). "
1352,22," Plaintiffs argue that the Honorable Joel A. Pisano, U.S.D.J., in Wellness and Trans USA incorrectly required an intermediate 
standard for allegations of false statements under the Lanham Act and, for support, cites to district court cases outside of the 
Third Circuit. Pl. Opp. 36-38. Plaintiffs also contend that Garraf cites to ""unreported decisions [that] are at odds with 
contemporaneous published opinions [from district courts in other circuits] that categorically reject the suggestion that Lanham 
Act claims must contain more detail than would be required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)."" Pl. Opp. at 36-37. This distinction, however, 
is irrelevant. None of  [*87] these decisions, cited by Plaintiffs or Defendants, are binding on this Court. Thus, in conducting its 
own analysis, the Court finds the decisions in the district courts within the Third Circuit, which are post-Twombly, are persuasive, 
and the Court applies an intermediate pleading standard here."
1352,23," Plaintiffs argue that a liberal interpretation of the ""commercial advertising or promotion"" requirement applies under Rule 
12(b)(6), and therefore, their pleadings regarding Defendants' concerted, intentional, and false marketing communications is 
sufficient ""advertising."" Pl. Opp. at 32-33 & n. 9 (citing to cases which found that even a single promotional statement suffices as 
an advertisement for purposes of the Lanham Act). The crux of Defendants' argument, however, is not that Plaintiffs have 
insufficiently plead an advertisement, but that Plaintiffs fail to sufficiently allege that any false or misleading statements were 
ever made by Defendants. And even if there were such statements, there are no allegations that they caused deception or had a 
tendency to deceive. See, e.g., Garraf Reply at 13. "
1355,24," As both parties refer to Commette and Gama as Gama on this motion, the Court does the same."
1355,25," Counterclaimants also allege conspiracy to monopolize the IPPE market, however, the Supreme Court has clearly held that 
under the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 1, a parent company and its wholly owned subsidiary are incapable of conspiring with each 
other. See Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 776-77, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1984). In 
Copperweld,  [*99] the Court determined that ""[a] parent and its wholly owned subsidiary have a complete unity of interest. Their 
objectives are common, not disparate; their general corporate actions are guided or determined not by two separate corporate 
consciousnesses, but one."" Id. at 771. As the parent and subsidiary always have a ""unity of purpose or a common design,"" Id., 
the Court held that a parent corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary are incapable of conspiring with each other for purposes 
of ยง 1 of the Sherman Act. Id. at 777. Similarly, Counterclaimants fail to state a claim of conspiracy because Graco Inc. and its 
wholly-owned subsidiary Graco Minnesota cannot conspire with each other because they too have a unity of purpose or a 
common design. See Id. Gama, however, argues that it did adequately plead a conspiracy claim under the Sherman Act because Graco's boycott 
conspiracy implicates both Graco and its top-tier American distributors who effectively became coerced coconspirators against 
Gama. Otto, 388 F.2d at 797. However, I find that Gama's allegations that ""Graco and Graco Minnesota and/or others . . . 
conspired to monopolize the IPPE market"" are too vague under Twombly. Counterclaim  [*100] P 50. Because counterclaimants 
fail to allege with specificity that any other conspirator was involved, the Court dismisses Gama's claims of conspiracy to violate 
antitrust laws. Moreover, Gama lacks standing to bring its antitrust claims. See Part III.B.1., infra."
1355,26," Graco argues that as an agent of Gama, Commette's injury and standing are necessarily derivative of Gama's. Thus, if Gama 
lacks antitrust standing, then Commette also lacks standing. See Sw. Suburban Bd. of Realtors, Inc. v. Beverly Area Planning 
Ass'n, 830 F.2d 1374, 1378 (7th Cir. 1987) (denying a corporate officer of the plaintiff company challenging anticompetitive 
conduct standing); Midwestern Waffles, Inc. v. Waffle House, Inc., 734 F.2d 705, 710-711 (11th Cir. 1984).  [*101] Gama does 
not dispute this. "
1358,27," With regard to Gama's alleged antitrust  [*110] injury, depending on how Gama defines the relevant market, Gama may be 
able to demonstrate that it, at least at times, directly competes with Graco, as Graco admits that sometimes it acts as a 
distributor selling to end-users. In addition, Gama may be able to show that it forges the link between Garraf and the top-tier 
American distributors and competes directly with Graco, which sells its products directly to the same distributors, and thus 
Gama's harm is inextricably intertwined with Graco's alleged refusal to deal and its forced group boycott. See Carpet Group Int'l 
v. Oriental Rug Importers Ass'n Inc., 227 F.3d 62, 77 (3d Cir. 2000). Even if, however, Gama adequately defines the relevant 
market and demonstrates Gama's alleged injury is of the type for which the antitrust laws were intended to provide redress, 
balancing the five factors in Associated General Contractors, Gama will have to demonstrate that it has standing with regard to 
the factors of directness of the injury, the existence of more direct victims, and, most troubling, the potential for duplicative 
recovery or complex apportionment of damages."
1358,28," The Court notes that this argument contradicts Graco's claim that Gama has successfully entered the market as evident from 
""Gama's own website [that] identifies at least 12 distributors  [*112] for Garraf products, acquired in Gama's one year of 
business."" Pl. Mot. at 25 n. 12. "
1359,29," Graco argues that Gama ""implicitly conceded that it has failed to 'establish with reasonable certainty a prospective economic 
relation."" Pl. Reply at 8-9. However, Gama states that it intends to amend its counterclaims with the actual dollar amount it 
allegedly lost due to Graco's conduct. Gama Opp. at 23 & n. 4. Because a plaintiff must only allege that the injury caused 
damages to state a tortious interference cause of action, and need not specify what the actual damages were at this stage of 
litigation, Graco's argument is unavailing. Matrix, 870 F. Supp. at 1249."

(3d Cir. 1966) (holding that under New Jersey law an automobile manufacturer could be held liable for tortious interference with 
prospective economic relations, where an auto maker wrote to DeSoto purchasers and recommended that buyers have their 
cars serviced at dealerships that did not handle DeSoto in an effort to phase out dealerships of discontinued DeSoto model),

architects had maliciously advised board of education to accept a higher bid for construction of new high school). "
1360,31," The Court notes that such defenses are inappropriate at this stage of litigation -- on a motion to dismiss when all factual 
allegation are accepted as true. "
1363,1," Title 24 L.P.R.A. ยง334(e) defines a Certificate of Necessity and Convenience as: A document issued by the Secretary of Health authorizing a person to carry out any of the activities covered by ยงยง334-334j 
of this title, certifying that the same is necessary  [*2] for the population it is to serve and that it will not unduly affect the 
existing services, thus contributing to the orderly and adequate development of health services in Puerto Rico. "
1364,2," The memorandum of law was filed separately (docket entry 21). In support of its motion, defendants have also included as 
exhibits the Department of Health's Notice of Resolution, Resolution, and the Report from Hearing Examiner (docket entry 20). 
(See, also, English translation (docket entry 26)). Inasmuch as the motion is one for dismissal and not summary judgment, only 
 [*4] their existence, and not the specific content, has been considered."
1364,3, The Motion Joining and Supplementing Request for Dismissal (docket entry 28) is NOTED. 
1365,4," Guimerfe, in its memorandum in opposition, refers to the spirit of Clarke v. Securities Industry Ass'n, 479 U.S. 388, 107 S. Ct. 
750, 93 L. Ed. 2d 757 (1987) to convince us that intrastate players are reliable plaintiff that may raise dormant Commerce 
Clause challenges where there the discriminatory ordinance harms both intrastate and interstate commerce. This argument, 
however, still fails to overcome the absence of a case or controversy that is ripe for adjudication. "
1381,1," Although Defendants have filed joint motions to dismiss, the following Defendants have filed their own motions to dismiss: 
Sandisk (Docket 370); Hitachi (Docket 372); Renesas (373); Hynix (Docket 376); and  [**22] Toshiba (Docket 382). "
1382,2," These facts are taken from both the Direct Purchaser Complaint and Indirect Purchaser Complaint filed on February 7, 2008. 
For purposes of the Background section, the references are to the Direct Purchaser Complaint only. "
1383,3," On January 5, 2007, Plaintiff Trong Nguyen, on behalf of himself and others similarly situated, sued Defendants for violating 
section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 1. The Court later related and consolidated 23 cases with the Nguyen action. The 
Court appointed interim lead counsel for the Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs and Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs on November 15, 
 [**27] 2007. (Docket 256, 257.)"
1383,4," The Indirect Purchaser Complaint adds Hitachi America, Ltd. and Hitachi Semiconductor America as defendants. (Indirect 
Purchaser (""IP"") Compl. PP 60-61.) "
1384,5," Two weeks after issuing Twombly, the Supreme Court clarified in Erickson that  [**30] Twombly did not signal a switch to fact-
pleading in the federal courts. Erickson reaffirmed that HN2[
] under Rule 8 ""[s]pecific facts are not necessary; the statement need only 'give the defendant fair notice of what the โฆ claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.'"" 127 S.Ct. at 2200 (quoting 
Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555); see also Airborne Beepers & Video, Inc. v. AT&T Mobility LLC, 499 F.3d 663, 667-668 (7th Cir. 
2007) (""[t]aking Erickson and Twombly together, we understand the Court to be saying only that at some point the factual detail 
in a complaint may be so sketchy that the complaint does not provide the type of notice of the claim to which the defendant is 
entitled under Rule 8.""). "
1385,6," The references to ""Complaint"" and ""Plaintiffs"" in this section refer to the Direct Purchaser Complaint and the Direct Purchaser 
Plaintiffs, respectively."
1385,7," In addition  [**34] to the joint motion to dismiss, Toshiba, Mitsubishi, Hitachi, SanDisk and Hynix filed their own, separate 
motions to dismiss. The arguments adduced in those motions overlap with those presented in the joint submission. Their central 
point of contention appears to be the lack of specific allegations directed at their particular company. This argument fails. HN6[ ] For pleading purposes, allegations of antitrust conspiracy need not be detailed on a ""defendant by defendant"" basis. See SRAM, 580 F. Supp. 2d at 903-907 (rejecting argument plaintiffs must allege each defendant's specific role in an antitrust 
conspiracy); accord In re Fine Paper Antitrust Litig., 685 F.2d 810, 822 (3rd Cir. 1982); In re Market-Makers Antitrust Litig., 894 
F. Supp. 703, 712 (S.D.N.Y. 1995). Defendant Hitachi America Ltd.'s separate argument that Plaintiff's claims are time-barred is 
unsupported by any evidence which, in any event, would be impermissible on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. "
1387,8," The Court notes that the Complaint does not allege that market shares among the Defendants were ""rapidly shifting."" That 
simply is Defendants' characterization of some of the data alleged in the pleadings. "
1389,9," For example, the Complaint alleges that as early as 2002, industry participants called for cooperation among competitors to 
""prevent a price war,"" and that Defendants heeded these suggestions. (DP Compl. PP 91-92.) It further is alleged that consistent 
with this strategy, Renesas was created in 2003 as a joint venture by Defendants Hitachi, Ltd. and Mitsubishi. (Id. P 64.) It thus 
is plausible to conclude that the formation  [**49] of Renesas was itself a conspiratorial act to control prices and supply. See 
Petruzzi's IGA Supermarkets, Inc. v. Darling-Delaware Co., Inc., 998 F.2d 1224 (3rd Cir. 1993) (noting that a range of 
circumstantial evidence can show collusion; ""'[f]or example, have they attended meetings or conducted discussions at which 
they had the opportunity to conspire; have they acted against their own economic best interests; have they engaged in parallel 
behavior that is economically irrational unless an agreement exists; has at least one participant expressly invited common action 
by the other'"") (emphasis added). "
1390,10, It also is noteworthy that nearly all of the Defendants in this case sell DRAM and NAND flash memory. (DP Compl. P 66-69.)
1390,11," In their Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that the Department of Justice (""DOJ"") has begun investigating Defendants for price-fixing 
flash memory. (DP Compl. PP 115-118.) Plaintiffs suggest that this development may be used to create an inference of anti-
competitive activity. However, as noted by Defendants, the mere fact that an investigation is under way is not by itself an 
appropriate consideration for purposes of determining the adequacy of the pleadings. See SRAM, 580 F. Supp. 2d at 903 (""The 
Court agrees that the existence of the investigation [regarding SRAM] does not support Plaintiffs' antitrust conspiracy claims""); 
GPU, 527 F. Supp. 2d at 1024 (finding  [**56] that it would be sheer speculation to infer anti-competitive behavior from a mere 
investigation, as opposed to a proceeding which results in charges or civil or criminal penalties). "
1391,12," All references to ""Plaintiffs"" and ""Complaint"" in this section are to the Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs and the Indirect-Purchaser 
Plaintiffs' Consolidated Class Action Complaint, respectively."
1391,13," It bears noting that the Indirect Purchasers Plaintiffs are comprised of those who purchased (1) flash memory as a ""stand-
alone product' and (2) products where flash memory is a ""substantial component"" of a finished product. (IP Compl. P 12.) 
Defendants' motion to dismiss is limited specifically to the latter category, i.e., ""Flash Memory-based products."" (Mot. at 12.) "
1395,14," As noted, Defendants have not demonstrated that AGC applies to Plaintiffs' antitrust claims based on the laws of Arizona, 
 [**75] Kansas, Maine, Michigan, North Carolina, South Dakota, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, West Virginia and Wisconsin, 
and they have not advanced any other ground for dismissing these particular claims at this time. "
1396,15," Defendants do not specifically address the consumer protection laws of Arkansas, the District of Columbia or New Mexico, but 
present  [**76] a single argument that each of these three jurisdictions requires a showing of unequal bargaining power. (Mot. at 
17; Reply at 17.) Because the statutes of each of these jurisdictions differ, the Court addresses each separately. "
1399,16," Although Plaintiffs contend that they, in fact, have made the requisite allegations, the cited paragraphs of the Complaint do not 
support their assertion. (Opp'n at 46 (citing Compl. PP 174, 219.) "
1400,17," Aggrieved purchasers are not without a remedy, as the Defendants' actions may be subject to  [**92] the state's antitrust 
provisions. R.I. Gen. Laws ยง 6-36.2(b). However, indirect purchasers lack standing to bring a private claim under that statute. 
See Siena v. Microsoft Corp., 796 A.2d 461, 464-65 (2002) (holding that the state attorney general has standing as parens 
patriae to protect the rights of indirect purchasers in antitrust matters since they cannot bring such actions themselves directly). "
1401,18, The bulk of Plaintiffs' argument also is set forth in a lengthy string cite in a footnote. (Opp'n at 48 n.47.) 
1409,1," Defendants moved to dismiss plaintiff's ten-count Complaint in its entirety pursuant to FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to 
state a claim upon which relief can be granted and in an Opinion and Order dated September 27, 2006, (""Mahmud I"") the Court 
dismissed plaintiff's third cause of action under NYSHRL and her eighth and tenth causes of action for prima facie tort. Mahmud 
v. Kaufmann, 454 F. Supp. 2d 150, 164 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (Conner, J.). Defendants  [**3] then moved for reconsideration of the 
First Opinion, and in an Opinion and Order dated June 27, 2007, (""Mahmud II"") the Court dismissed plaintiff's first cause of 
action under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981, her fourth cause of action under NYSHRL, and her seventh cause of action under the NYGBL. 
Mahmud v. Kaufmann, 496 F. Supp. 2d 266, 278 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (Conner, J.). During a telephone conference before this Court 
on October 15, 2008, plaintiff withdrew her second cause of action under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981 and her ninth cause of action for 
interference with prospective economic advantage. (Pl. Mem. Opp. Summ. J. at 2.) Plaintiff's ninth cause of action for interference with prospective economic advantage was based on defendants' alleged 
intentional disruption of plaintiff's relationships with her patients by making certain comments to those patients. Plaintiff's fifth 
cause of action, also for interference with prospective economic advantage, is based on defendants' alleged ""actions . . . 
toward[] [p]laintiff"" in ""driving away [her] patients, or forcing patients to consult other doctors with Hospital privileges, through 
unlawful and/or improper means."" (Am. Complt. P 51.)"
1409,2," Mercy Hospital was later renamed Bon Secours Community Hospital.  [**5] Mahmud I, 454 F. Supp. 2d at 153 n.2."
1409,3," HN1[
] Local Rule 56.1 provides that upon motions for summary judgment the moving party shall submit ""a separate, short and concise statement, in numbered paragraphs, of the material facts as to which the moving party contends there is no 
genuine issue to be tried."" (alteration in original). Although it appears that defendants' initial Rule 56.1 Statement meets these "
1410,," requirements,  [**6] defendants' Supplemental Rule 56.1 Statement does not contain any numbered paragraphs. Therefore, the 
Court's citations to this Statement include only the relevant page number. HN2[
] Local Rule 56.1 also provides that the papers opposing a motion for summary judgment ""shall include a correspondingly numbered paragraph responding to each numbered paragraph in the statement of the moving party, 
and if necessary, additional paragraphs containing a separate, short and concise statement of additional material facts."" 
(alterations in original). Plaintiff has not provided any statement corresponding to either of defendants' Rule 56.1 Statements. 
Instead, plaintiff directs the Court to her 84-paragraph declaration, to her own Rule 56.1 Statement, which, according to plaintiff, 
""is also a brief summary of the material facts,"" and to two exhibits which, together, contain approximately 185 documents. (Pl. 
Mem. Opp. Summ. J. at 3.) Plaintiff also includes a seven-page ""Partial Statement of Facts"" in her Memorandum of Law in 
Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment. (Id. at 4-12.) Plaintiff's counsel explains: ""Instead of attempting to 
summarize this substantial body of evidence, I have arranged  [**7] the documents . . . so that they tell the story."" (Id. at 3.) The 
Court notes that not only is it an attorney's job to attempt to summarize the evidence, but it is the attorney's job to actually do so. 
By barraging the Court with documents in this manner, plaintiff not only fails to comply with Rule 56.1's requirements of ""short 
and concise"" statements, but also undermines the purpose of Rule 56.1 ""to streamline the consideration of summary judgment 
motions by freeing the district courts from the need to hunt through voluminous records without guidance from the parties."" 
Rodriguez v. Morton, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12470, 2009 WL 414033, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 13, 2009) (citing Holtz v. Rockefeller 
& Co., 258 F.3d 62, 74 (2d Cir. 2001) (internal quotation marks omitted))."
1410,4," Plaintiff does not specify the nature of her complaints with particularity, although she states that she was concerned about ""the 
level and quality of care provided by the [Hospital],"" that ""[p]atients' lives were at stake and too many deaths were happening 
without accountability"" and that her complaints concerned ""deficiencies [she] saw in BSCH conditions, nursing services and 
even practices by some doctors."" (Mahmud Decl. PP 34, 35, 75.)"
1410,5," Plaintiff avers that she started recording her concerns in the charts because her oral complaints did not result in any remedy of 
the complained-of deficiencies. (Mahmud Decl. P 75.) By recording the deficiencies in the patients' charts, she would ""force 
[them] to be addressed and corrected"" and she also would be protecting herself from blame for ""unacceptable quality of care."" 
 [**9] (Id.)"
1410,6," The documents plaintiff cites in support of this proposition concern plaintiff's qualifications, conduct and medical care; they do 
not corroborate or address the validity of plaintiff's complaints about hospital conditions. (See Mahmud Decl. PP 84A-84N; 
Person Decl., Ex. P at 11, 76.)"
1410,7, None of these employees are named defendants in the instant litigation. 
1411,8," The CPH, a division of the Medical Society of the State of New York, provides ""non-disciplinary, confidential assistance to 
physicians . . . experiencing problems from stress and difficult adjustment, emotional, substance abuse and other psychiatric 
disorders."" (Defs. Suppl. R. 56.1 Stmt. at 2 n.2.) Plaintiff contends that defendants ""communicated with the Physicians Health Committee and induced them to request that 
[plaintiff] undergo psychiatric evaluation, when in fact she was functioning  [**11] properly and in no need of treatment, 
evaluation or diagnosis."" (Pl. R. 56.1 Stmt. P 9.) It appears plaintiff relies on her own sworn statements to support the proposition 
that defendants ""induced"" the CPH to request her evaluation."
1411,9," Plaintiff does not identify what relationship, if any, exists between Bon Secours Charity Health System and BSCH. (See, e.g., 
Mahmud Decl. P 9.)"
1411,10," At some point, Dr. Smits Kittur (""Kittur""), a neurologist, performed a neurological examination of plaintiff. (Mahmud Decl. P 43; 
Lasch Decl., Ex. A at 256.) Kittur also reviewed the charts and concurred in Strain's conclusion. (Mahmud Decl. P 43.) "
1414,11," To support the proposition that defendants desired that ORMC rely on the documents ""created"" by them to deny admitting 
privileges to plaintiff, plaintiff relies only upon her own declaration. (See Pl. R. 56.1 Stmt. P 17 (citing Mahmud Decl. PP 50, 53).) "
1415,12," To support this proposition, plaintiff cites her own declaration and directs the Court to over 100 ""ORMC documents,"" without 
 [**27] providing any citations to page numbers. She also provides the citation ""Ex. R, PX B-E in depositions of Defendants"" 
however it is unclear to which parts of defendants' deposition testimony she intends to refer. (Pl. R. 56.1 Stmt. P 8.)"
1415,13," Although plaintiff cites Auerbach's deposition testimony, nothing in that testimony indicates any intent on the part of 
defendants to cast plaintiff in a bad light."
1415,14," However, the record reflects that, while the MEC typically kept written minutes of regular meetings, it did not keep such 
minutes at executive sessions in the interest of maintaining the confidentiality of those meetings, ""[s]o that things that are being 
discussed [are] not [] used to harm any individual or part of the hospital as it's being processed."" (Person Decl., Ex. H 
(Kaufmann Dep. at 16:6-17:17).)"
1415,15," In support of this proposition, plaintiff explains that defendants requested that the report be adverse ""through failure to confront 
[Tatelbaum] with Strain letter . . . or the report of nuerologist Dr. Kitur [sic] who concurred with [] Strain."" (Pl. R. 56.1 Stmt. P 19.) 
Her citations to the record do not indicate whether defendants shared the reports prepared by Strain and Kittur with 
 [**28] Tatelbaum."
1415,16," As noted above, plaintiff has admitting privileges at Ellenville Regional Hospital, Catskill Regional Medical Center and St. 
Anthony Community Hospital. (Mahmud Decl. P 30.) "
1417,17," As noted in Mahmud I, ""[a]lthough plaintiff does not specifically allege a claim under the Clayton Act, HN15[
] sections 4 and"
1417,16," of that Act, 15 U.S.C. ยงยง 15, 26, permit a private party to recover damages and seek injunctive relief for any violation of the 
Sherman Act. . . . As plaintiff is seeking damages and injunctive relief, we therefore treat plaintiff's suit as seeking recovery 
under the Sherman Act through the private right of action provided for in the Clayton Act."" 454 F. Supp. 2d at 159 n.13 (internal 
citations omitted)."
1417,18," It is not clear from the Amended Complaint whether plaintiff intends to assert her antitrust claim under section 1, section 2 or 
both sections of the Sherman Act. She states that defendants' conduct was ""contrary to 15 USC 1 et seq."" (Am. Complt. P 57.) 
Her opposition papers cite both section 1 and section 2. (See, e.g., Pl. Mem. Opp. Summ. J. at 13, 17.) However, it is not 
necessary to determine this issue for the discussion below as the analyses is applicable to both sections. "
1418,19," We presume that plaintiff intends to define the relevant service market as emergency cardiac services. She has presented no 
evidence to indicate that individuals  [**42] within her defined geographic market would not travel to a hospital other than BSCH 
for non-emergency cardiac services and, thus, she has not demonstrated that the provision of such services at BSCH are not 
reasonably interchangeable with similar services provided at other hospitals. Rather, plaintiff argues that the relevant market is 
Port Jervis and the surrounding geographic area ""stretching outward to a distance halfway between the nearest hospital in any 
direction,"" because ""obtaining medical care within the first 10 minutes of a life-threatening event is critical for the recovery 
prospects"" and because when an individual suffers a stroke, he or she is taken to the nearest hospital. (Pl. Mem. Opp. Summ. J. 
at 15-16.) Thus, it appears that she intends to argue that, because of the need for expediency, emergency cardiac services at 
BSCH are not reasonably interchangeable with similar services at a hospital located farther away. To the extent that plaintiff argues that individuals that are taken to the nearest hospital for emergency services are entitled to be 
seen by their physician of choice (in this case, plaintiff), we reject this proposition. A contrary finding would lead to  [**43] the 
absurd result that any physician would be entitled to admitting privileges at any hospital located anywhere merely because that 
physician's patients may require emergency services at that hospital at some point in the future. "
1419,20," Plaintiff also submits her own sworn statement that Kaufmann ignored her suggestions to upgrade the ""equipment and 
cardiology services at BSCH"" and that after she left, ""various specialized equipment for cardiac patients remains unused, to the 
detriment of the cardiac patients at BSCH."" (Mahmud Decl. P 80.) Plaintiff's own speculation as to the impact of the level of "
1420,," equipment and cardiology services on patient care after she left BSCH is insufficient to create a genuine issue of fact as to 
whether patients were harmed by defendants' alleged actions."
1420,21," Plaintiff provides her sworn statement that ""[t]he ability of . . . patients [] in the market area to select from competing providers 
of . . . specialized services has been severely limited, if not eliminated, by [defendants'] alleged activities."" (Mahmud Decl. P 62.) 
This general conclusory allegation is insufficient to create a genuine issue of fact as to whether patient choice was in fact 
reduced."
1420,22," It appears from the record that plaintiff last worked at BSCH in May 2002, at which point she requested a leave of absence."
1420,23, We note that these positions may not permit plaintiff to render emergency cardiac services in the relevant geographic market. 
1421,24," Plaintiff explained in her papers opposing defendants' motion to dismiss that ""[r]ather than debate the necessity of so pleading, 
[p]laintiff has, in her Amended Complaint . . ., identified half-a-dozen patients with whom [d]efendants interfered."" (Pl. Mem. Opp. 
Mot. Dismiss (Document # 12).)"
1421,25," Plaintiff states that her claims that defendants made derogatory statements about her to her patients ""are no longer part of the 
case."" (Pl. Mem. Opp. Summ. J. at 12.) She does not argue that defendants interfered with her relationships with patients in 
some other manner. Thus, it appears that she has abandoned entirely this theory of liability and has not submitted any evidence 
in support of the claim as alleged in her Amended Complaint. "
1422,26," We note that, although BSCH suspended plaintiff's admitting privileges, nothing in the record indicates that it even rejected an 
application by plaintiff to renew her privileges. Rather, the record indicates that plaintiff took a leave of absence in May 2002, 
during which time her application to renew her privileges was deferred indefinitely. Brunelle contacted her in November 2002 to 
inquire as to whether she wanted to pursue her application, to which plaintiff responded that she did not. However, plaintiff states 
that her reason for not renewing her privileges was that she felt ""traumatized"" by the physicians that comprise the MEC. 
Although plaintiff technically was not denied privileges, she claims that defendants' activities prohibited her from seeking to 
renew them. We need not decide here whether this distinction has significance for a tortious interference  [**58] claim."
1422,27," Although plaintiff contends that defendants ""deviated from their custom and practice of dealing with physician issues in 
executive session without any writings to record the events,"" (Pl. R. 56.1 Stmt. at 11), this proposition is not supported by the 
record. Even if we accept the proposition as true, it would not establish that defendants were acting outside the scope of their 
authority as agents for BSCH. "
1423,28," Plaintiff argues that defendants interfered with her relationship with the OPMC and the CPH. Plaintiff has not identified any 
""business relationship"" with the CPH or the OPMC that was injured. These two entities are committees and plaintiff has not 
demonstrated any potential for economic advantage with either. Furthermore, neither party addresses whether plaintiff's 
relationship with either of these committees has been injured by any action by defendants. Rather, it appears that the OPMC 
closed its investigation of plaintiff's case without any adverse finding and the CPH ""found no basis to take or recommend 
 [**60] any action against [plaintiff]."" (Mahmud Decl. P 47.) "
1425,1," The facts set forth below are gleaned from Plaintiff's Complaint (Doc. 1), because in consideration of a motion to dismiss, the 
Court must accept all of Plaintiff's well pleaded allegations as true. See infra pp. 6-7. "
1427,2," The Crosby Court noted that the terms ""municipality"" and ""political subdivision"" were used interchangeably within the opinion. 
Crosby, 93 F.3d at 1522 n. 10. "
1428,3," Here, OCGA ยง 31-7-75(7) authorizes Defendant Authority to lease hospitals to others and the lease agreement at issue here 
authorizes Authority to revoke the lease for certain enumerated reasons. It appears from Plaintiff's complaint and argument in 
response to Defendant Authority's Motion to Dismiss that the challenged conduct in this case is Defendant Authority's ""refusal to 
terminate the lease and reassume control over the hospital because of the illegal behavior that began in 2000 and continues to 
this day."" (Docs. 1, 17)."
1428,4," It is likely that this would be an issue of first impression for the Eleventh Circuit as well, as the Court cannot find any caselaw 
from this circuit that is directly on point. "
1431,5," Decisions of the Fifth Circuit rendered on or before September 30, 1981, are binding precedent in the Eleventh Circuit. Bonner 
v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc)."
1431,6," To the extent that Plaintiff alleges Defendant Authority also conspired with the other defendants under Counts III and IV, the 
Court's discussion supra Part I.A.1 is applicable here as well. "
1432,7," This includes patients insured by any of the insurance providers who have exclusivity contracts with Phoebe; in that instance, 
Plaintiff would merely be an ""out-of-network"" provider. "
1433,8," This requirement makes this issue particularly well suited for consideration on a motion to dismiss, as the Court must accept a 
plaintiff's well pleaded allegations as true anyway."
1433,9," The Court notes here that at this point in the present litigation, Plaintiff is required to do no more than put forth well pleaded 
allegations. The Court's decision at this stage, on the existence of the necessary antitrust injury, therefore does not preclude a 
different decision if the Court reviews this matter under a more developed recordโfor example, upon consideration of a motion 
for summary judgment. "
1434,10," This only references the tied-product services and does not account for the fact that Phoebe is the only area hospital with the 
requisite C.O.N. for the alleged tying-products. Therefore, Palmyra could not offer these serves unless and until it is able to gain 
a C.O.N. for acute-care obstetrics, neonatology, and cardiovascular services."
1434,11," The Court notes here that despite Plaintiff's contention on the one hand that BCBSGA, and other insurers, are the party whom 
Defendant Phoebe contracted with to violate Section 1 of the Sherman Act and that BCBSGA is one of the entities/persons 
injured by Defendant's illegal conduct, Plaintiff has made no attempt to name BCBSGA as either a defendant or enlist them as a 
plaintiff (which appears to violate Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a)). "
1435,12," Under Section 4, a pleader must show actual injury to business or property, however, under Section 16 a pleader need only 
show a ""threat"" of loss or damage. "
1443,1," Although this action was originally brought against numerous defendant entities, several of the defendants have since been 
dismissed, or filed withdrawals. Those defendant entities who currently remain in the case and bring the current motions are: 
Hynix Semiconductor, Inc., and Hynix Semiconductor America, Inc. (collectively ""Hynix""); Nanya Technology Corporation, and 
Nanya Technology Corporation USA (""NTC"" and ""NTC USA,"" respectively). "
1444,2," Notwithstanding the ACC's allegation, there is a dispute between the parties as to the actual amount and percentage of DRAM 
purchases made by third-party external manufacturers. Using the 34% alleged in the complaint and plaintiff's own expert report 
as to damages, defendants contend that there are $ 1.05 billion in DRAM purchases made by external manufacturers at issue in 
the case. See Def. MSJ re Ext. Manuf. Purch. at 4:8-11. Plaintiff, however, contends in their opposition that external 
 [**8] manufacturer purchases amount to approximately $ 179 million worth of DRAM purchases, or around 6% of Sun's total 
DRAM purchases. See Pl. Opp. Re MSJ re Ext. Manuf. Purch. at 1:5-6. "
1446,3," On many occasions, the DRAM suppliers kept track of which DRAM delivered to the EMs was intended for use in Sun 
products. In these instances, the suppliers' sales records identified  [**12] Sun as the end-purchaser. See, e.g., Cross EM Opp. 
Decl., Exs. 1-19."
1446,4," The ""single worldwide DRAM price"" established by Sun's California-based global procurement team applied equally to Sun's 
foreign subsidiaries and its third-party external manufacturers. See id. at P 5. "
1448,5," The first five of these motions are addressed herein, while the latter two motions filed by NTC and NTC USA are addressed via 
separate order, to be filed by the court. "
1450,6," In Hanover Shoe, Inc., v. United Machinery Corp., the Supreme Court generally held that a pass-on defense cannot be relied 
on by defendants who seek to prove that a direct purchaser plaintiff was not actually injured by a violation of the antitrust laws, if 
the plaintiff has passed on some or all of the illegal overcharge to other subsequent purchasers. See 392 U.S. 481, 491-493, 88 
S. Ct. 2224, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1231 (1968). The court adhered there to the ""general  [**27] principle"" that the victim of an overcharge 
""is damaged within the meaning of [the antitrust standing statute] to the extent of the overcharge"" only. Id. at 491. "
1454,7," Defendants' motion also targets all claims based on purchases made by Sun's foreign external manufacturers. Thus, 
defendants seek dismissal of claims based on an aggregate total purchase amount of ""more than $ 762 million between August 
1998 and June 2002 and more than $ 732 million between April 1999 and June 2002."" See Cross FTAIA Opp. Decl., Ex. 1 at P 
4. However, in view of the court's grant of summary judgment with respect to all claims based on DRAM purchases made by 
external manufacturers -- both domestic and foreign -- this additional ground is now moot for purposes of the instant motion to 
dismiss."
1454,8," It should be noted that defendants' moving papers also seek dismissal based on Sun's inability to demonstrate subject matter 
jurisdiction over the claims at issue pursuant to an alter ego theory. However, as Sun states in its opposition brief and conceded 
at the hearing, it is not pursuing an alter ego theory in arguing for subject matter jurisdiction. See MTD Opp. Br. at 10:15-11:3 
(the ""alter ego and veil piercing analyses addressed by defendants are materially different"" from the single enterprise theory 
being argued by Sun)."
1454,9," Plaintiff also initially contends ""[a]s a threshold matter,"" that defendants have stipulated that the only transactions at issue in 
this motion are deliveries of DRAM to Sun's foreign facilities, and not deliveries of DRAM to Sun's external manufacturers. The 
court has already decided that the latter issue is moot for purposes of this motion. Even if it had not so decided, however, the 
court would nonetheless find that the stipulation at issue lends no support for plaintiff's argument. See Cross FTAIA Opp. Decl., 
Ex. 1. "
1457,10," The court observes that the concept of 'control,' as employed for purposes of the traditional agency test, is distinct from the 
legal test  [**59] for 'control' that applies in connection with the well-recognized control exception to Illinois Brick (discussed 
supra in connection with defendants' motion challenging external manufacturer purposes). This is so even if, as defendants 
pointed out at the hearing, the underlying arguments going to both are similar. "
1458,11," Defendants have objected to the Declaration of Peter Wilson, on grounds that the information contained therein constitutes 
""new"" evidence not previously disclosed, and that its disclosure now violates Sun's earlier obligation to supplement all discovery 
responses by June 30, 2008. The court overrules this objection, however, in light of defendants' failure to set forth an adequate 
showing as to what evidence contained in the declaration is actually ""new."" "
1459,12," To the extent defendants also seek dismissal of plaintiff's state claims in addition to the Sherman  [**67] Act claim, the court 
declines to reach this issue based on nothing more than defendants' cursory footnote (citing two out-of-circuit district cases) 
suggesting that plaintiff's state law claims are subject to the same FTAIA analysis as is undertaken here. "
1460,13," There were originally three defendant Mitsubishi entities named as defendants in the present action: Mitsubishi Electric 
Corporation, Mitsubishi Electric and Electronics USA, Inc., and Mitsubishi Electric Europe B.V. All, however, were dismissed 
from the action with prejudice on November 21, 2008, pursuant to a stipulation entered by the parties."
1460,14," Defendants also make the argument that, to the extent plaintiff's evidence of Mitsubishi's participation in the conspiracy relies 
on conduct committed at a time that plaintiff's experts finds no damages to plaintiff, defendants cannot be liable. This is similar to 
the argument made by the direct purchaser defendants on summary judgment, which the court rejected. For similar reasons, the 
court also rejects the argument here. In sum, there is no support for the principle that particular activities of a conspiracy can be 
excluded from consideration simply because they do not lead to actual damages. Rather, the question in regards to the 
conspiracy is simply whether plaintiff suffered some damage flowing from the unlawful conspiracy throughout the overall 
conspiracy period. "
1463,15," Specifically, defendants Infineon, Hynix, Samsung and Elpida, as well as certain of their employees, pled guilty to participation 
in a DRAM price-fixing conspiracy that targeted numerous large original equipment manufacturers. See, e.g., Cross Omnibus 
Opp. Decl., Exs. 1-19. "
1467,16," The primary difference between Dr. Marshall's testimony and Dr. White's testimony is that, while Dr. Marshall was asked to 
determine whether defendants' unlawful conduct had an effect on plaintiff's purchase of DRAM (i.e., caused an injury to plaintiff), 
Dr. White was asked to determine the actual extent of that effect (i.e., the amount of damage). Thus, Dr. Marshall's testimony 
goes purely to the causation issue, while Dr. White's testimony is primarily directed at the damages issue, but is nonetheless 
relevant to causation to the extent it necessarily proves the fact of injury. "
1484,1," Both parties frequently reference documents without providing a citation to the record or even making clear what document is 
being referenced. This sloppy citing makes it even more time-consuming for the Court to review the record. If the parties wish 
the Court to review the documents in future briefings, they must take the time to ensure that their citations are correct. "
1485,2," The two Agreements are essentially identical in all material ways, except as noted in the Order."
1485,3," The Court approved the dismissal of Rotondo on May 21, 2007 (Order [66]) and of Chambers, Koestner, Parker, Reed, and 
Randel on June 18, 2008 (Stipulation of Dismissal [231]). Therefore, the remaining individual defendants are Kaplan, Solomon, 
and Strauss. "
1487,4," (See also Pls.' Opp'n to Defs.' Mot. for Summ. J. [235] at 14 (""[T]he franchises in issue were sold and operated in California 
and Illinois, which law applies."").)"
1487,5, Plaintiffs do not assert claims of fraud against any of the individual defendants.
1487,6," In their response brief concerning the fraud claim, plaintiffs again observe that California and Illinois law apply, but they don't 
explain why that is so, given a contrary provision in the contract that provides that Georgia law applies. Likewise, they cite no 
cases to help the Court understand why they believe that California or Illinois law applies to the fraud claim, or why, even if those "
1488,," states' laws apply, plaintiffs could withstand a motion for summary judgment. See Pls.' Opp'n to Defs.' Mot. for Summa J. [235] 
at 14(""[T]he franchises in issue were sold and operated in California and Illinois, which law applies."") "
1489,7," A merger clause is only insufficient to defeat a fraud claim when the party has sought to rescind the contract. City Dodge, Inc. 
v. Gardner, 232 Ga. 766, 770, 208 S.E.2d 794 (1974). Plaintiff has not sought rescission of the agreement."
1489,8," The language in Trident's Compliance Checklist has a few insignificant differences, but it is essentially the same. (See Solomon 
Aff. [191-6], Ex. D at 1-2.) "
1491,9," See ยถ 45 (""Great Wraps knew that it was virtually impossible to build a store within ten months of signing of [Trident's] Area 
Development Agreement""); ยถ 53 (""Great Wraps knew it would take much longer to find potentially good sites in Southern 
California because its commercial real estate market was in huge demand and competition for food locations among various

Agreement"")."
1491,10," See ยถ 22 (Great Wraps provided costs to American in February 2004); ยถ 23 (Great Wraps sent a letter to American with costs

months of the signing of the Agreement). Paragraph 199 states merely that ""[p]laintiffs reasonably relied on the 
misrepresentations made by Great Wraps."" "

damages in an amount in excess of $75,000"")."
1492,12," Defendants do not address Counts Four or Six in their Motion for Summary Judgment [232], but rather refer the Court to the 
arguments in the February 11, 2008 Brief of [Previous] Defendants Kevin Parker, Dan Reed, Kenneth Chambers, Jonathan 
Randel and Christina [Koestner] in Support of Summary Judgment [186]."
1492,13," See Cal. Corp. Code ยง 31303 (""No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under Section 31300 [which 
allows a person to sue for a violation of Cal. Corp. Code ยง 31200 if the offer or sale of a franchise contains misleading or untrue 
required statements] unless brought before . . . the expiration of one year after the discovery by the plaintiff of the fact 
constituting the violation""); Cal. Corp. Code ยง 31304 (""No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under 
Section 31301 [which allows a person to sue for a violation of Cal. Corp. Code ยง 31201 if a person purchases a franchise while 
relying on the false or misleading statements] unless brought before the . . . expiration of one year after the discovery by the 
plaintiff of the facts constituting such violation""). "
1493,14," Plaintiffs state that they ""did not know they possessed claims against the defendants until they consulted with counsel."" (Pls.' 
Opp'n to Defs.' Mot. for Summ. J. [200] at 8.) Unfortunately for plaintiffs, the HN13[
] claims must be brought before the 
""expiration of one year after the discovery by the plaintiff of the facts constituting such violation,"" not after the plaintiffs' 
knowledge of the violation. Cal. Corp. Code ยง 31304 (emphasis added). "
1494,15," Additionally, the Cal. Corp. Code provides a defense if the ""defendant exercised reasonable care and did not know"" of the 
untruth ""or, if he or she had exercised reasonable care, would not have known."" Cal. Corp. Code ยง 31300. At the time they 
prepared the UFOCs for Trident and American, neither Solomon nor Kaplan, who wrote the UFOCs, had any knowledge or 
reasonable grounds to believe the UFOCs had incorrect information. They were specifically unaware of Saade's filing for 
bankruptcy when they prepared the UFOC. (Kaplan Aff. [191-5] at ยถยถ 7-9; Solomon Aff. [191-6] at ยถยถ 27-29.) Therefore, even if 
the statements were material, defendants would have a defense under Cal. Corp. Code ยง 31300. "
1495,16," See also Am.'s Favorite Chicken Co. v. Cajun Enters., Inc., 130 F.3d 180, 183 (5th Cir. 1997) (""the disclaimer clause in the 
franchise agreements states that [plaintiff] was not induced to execute the agreements by any extra-contractual representations"" 
and that therefore ""'[t]he misrepresentations and omissions upon which [plaintiff] bases its CFIL claims thus could not have been 
'material'""). "
1499,17," Plaintiffs have not returned any money either, and neither Trident nor American ever asked for the return of their money prior 
to filing suit against Great Wraps. (Solomon Aff. [191-6] at ยถ 25; Second Solomon Aff. [238-2] at ยถ 13.)"
1499,18," Decisions of the former Fifth Circuit filed prior to October 1, 1981 constitute binding precedent in the Eleventh Circuit. Bonner 
v. City of Prichard, Ala., 661 F.2d 1206, 1207 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc). "
1500,19," Defendants incorrectly argue that antitrust law does not apply to private disputes over a franchise contract (Defs.' Mot. for 
Summ. J. [232] at 5), and in fact cites several cases where courts do apply antitrust law in such instances."
1500,20," In Queen City Pizza, Inc. v. Domino's Pizza, Inc., 124 F.3d 430, 443 (3d Cir. 1997), the court concluded that the franchisee 
plaintiffs had to purchase products from Domino's not because of Domino's market power, but because they were contractually 
bound to do so. "
1501,21," See Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 7, 27, 104 S. Ct. 1551, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2 (1984), abrogated on other 
grounds by Ill. Tool Works, Inc. v. Indep. Ink, Inc., 547 U.S. 28, 31, 126 S. Ct. 1281, 164 L. Ed. 2d 26 (2006) (defendant 
hospital's thirty percent share of market showed that it lacked the ""kind of dominant market position that obviates the need for 
further inquiry into competitive conditions"")."
1501,22," Plaintiffs argue that Chicken Delight supports the proposition that a trademark gives a franchisor sufficient market power to 
violate antitrust laws, but this position has been strongly criticized and rejected. See Tominaga, 682 F. Supp. at 1494 (stating 
that Chicken Delight's analysis has been under ""crippling attack"" because ""[i]t makes no economic sense to attribute significant 
market power to the Chicken Delight trademark""); Principe v. McDonald's Corp., 631 F.2d 303, 309 (4th Cir. 1980) (stating that 
""[f]ranchising has come a long way"" since Chicken Delight and concluding that emphasis ""upon the trademark as the essence of 
a franchise is too restrictive""). "
1502,23," The top eighteen sandwich chains had sales of over $92 billion in 2005. Quizno's, another sandwich shop, had sales of over 
$1.7 billion, but a market share of only 2.29% of the top 100 restaurant chains. Great Wraps had sales of approximately $32 
million, meaning that its market share was less than .04%. (Solomon Aff. [191-6] at ยถยถ 21-22.) "
1503,24," Prathipati claimed that he asked Great Wraps for a food vendor in Chicago, but he never put the request in writing and has no 
evidence for that claim. (Prathipati Dep. [184] at 123.3-11.) Kapur also stated that he was ""forbidden to look for alternate sources 
of supplies,"" but he likewise gave no evidence to support that claim. (Kapur Dep. [185] at 204.20-22.)"
1503,25," O.C.G.A. ยง 13-6-11 states in relevant part: The expenses of litigation generally shall not be allowed as a part of the damages; but where the plaintiff has specially 
pleaded and has made prayer therefor and where the defendant has acted in bad faith, has been stubbornly litigious, or has 
caused the plaintiff unnecessary trouble and expense, the jury may allow them. "
1504,26," While plaintiffs say that defendants admitted ""to their knowing violation of the law"" (Pls.' Opp'n to Defs.' Mot. for Summ. J. 
[235] at 18), they provide no citation to the record alleging where defendants made this admission. Plaintiffs also say that they 
are entitled to expenses of litigation because defendants ""engaged in a series of improper actions in refusing to provide proper 
discovery."" Id. Regardless of whether this statement is true, HN27[
] expenses of litigation relate only ""to the transaction upon 
which the underlying action is based and refers to a time prior to the institution of suit, not defendant's conduct in defending the 
case."" M & H Constr. Co., Inc. v. N. Fulton Dev. Corp., 238 Ga. App. 713, 715, 519 S.E.2d 287 (1999)' (citations omitted). 
Therefore, actions during discovery are irrelevant to a court's determination of expenses of litigation."
1504,27," Plaintiffs did not move for summary judgment on Counts Seven, Eight, or Nine. (See (Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J. [236]; Pl.'s Mot. 
for Summ. J. [237].) "
1506,28," (See Pls.' Resp. to Defs.' Great Wraps, Mark Kaplan, Robert Solomon and Henry Strauss' Statement of Undisputed Facts 
[200-4] at ยถ 17.) "
1507,29," Though he is no longer a defendant, plaintiffs also sued Rotondo, who did not begin working for Great Wraps until over 
fourteen months after Trident signed its Agreement. (Rotondo Dep. [211] at 33.20) This sloppy and promiscuous naming of 
uninvolved defendants provides another reason to sanction plaintiffs' behavior. "
1510,1," The complaint at issue here is the First Amended Complaint, which CBC filed in August 2007. "
1514,1, All further statutory citations are to the Business and Professions Code unless otherwise indicated. 
1530,1," Section 1324a(h)(3)  [**16] defines an unauthorized alien as, ""with respect to the employment of an alien at a particular time, 
that the alien is not at that time either (A) an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, or (B) authorized to be so 
employed by this chapter or by the Attorney General."" 8 U.S.C. 1324a(h)(3)."
1530,2," The relevant section of the statute provides: HN14[
] It is unlawful for a person or other entity-- "
1531,," (A) to hire, or  [**17] to recruit or refer for a fee, for employment in the United States an alien knowing the alien is an 
unauthorized alien (as defined in subsection (h)(3) of this section) with respect to such employment, or (B) (i) to hire for employment in the United States an individual without complying with the requirements of subsection (b) 
of this section or (ii) if the person or entity is an agricultural association, agricultural employer, or farm labor contractor (as defined in 
section 1802 of title 29), to hire, or to recruit or refer for a fee, for employment in the United States an individual 
without complying with the requirements of subsection (b) of this section. (2) It is unlawful for a person or other entity, after hiring an alien for employment in accordance with paragraph (1), to 
continue to employ the alien in the United States knowing the alien is (or has become) an unauthorized alien with respect to 
such employment."
1531,8, U.S.C. ยง 1324a(a)(1)-(2). 
1534,3," If Commercial Cleaning had reached such a result, this Court would be bound by the Circuit's decision. However, Commercial 
Cleaning reached the opposite result--the Circuit ruled that the plaintiffs had not alleged a violation of section 273(a)(3). I 
suspect that, in 2002 or 2003, the Second Circuit, confronted by a pleading like plaintiffs' here, might well have concluded that it 
was sufficient at the motion to dismiss stage. But no such ruling was ever made, to my knowledge, and Twombly changes the 
landscape considerably. "
1535,4, The amended complaint would be improved if defendants were able to allege that this occurred on more than one occasion. 
1548,1," Defendants are: Infineon Technologies AG, and Infineon Technologies North America Corp. (collectively ""Infineon""); Hynix 
Semiconductor, Inc., and Hynix Semiconductor America, Inc. (collectively ""Hynix""); Mosel-Vitelic Inc., and Mosel-Vitelic 
Corporation (collectively ""Mosel-Vitelic""); Nanya Technology Corporation, and Nanya Technology Corporation USA (""NTC"" and 
""NTC USA,"" respectively); Winbond Electronics Corporation, and Winbond Electronics Corporation America (collectively 
""Winbond""); Elpida Memory, Inc., and Elpida Memory (USA) Inc. (collectively ""Elpida""); Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, 
Mitsubishi Electric and Electronics USA, Inc., and Mitsubishi Electric Europe B.V. (collectively ""Mitsubishi""). Since the filing of the 
complaint, however, several of these defendant entities have been dismissed.  [**6] Accordingly, only two sets of defendant 
entities remain in the case: the Hynix and Nanya entities. "
1549,2," There are also five additional motions filed by defendants in the Sun case, all of which are addressed via separate order filed 
by the court on March 31, 2009."
1549,3," Several of the named defendants in this Sun action were also named as defendants in the related MDL litigation pending 
before the court, including the Nanya defendants. As part of those MDL proceedings, the court had occasion to hear and decide 
several defendants' dispositive motions addressing issues raised by the direct purchaser plaintiffs' claims. "
1553,4," This absence of authority on the precise question before the court reflects the generally confusing state of the law on this point. 
As the Supreme Court itself has noted: ""The whole problem of the relation between parent and subsidiary corporations is one 
that is still enveloped in the mists of metaphor. Metaphors in law are to be narrowly watched, for starting as devices to liberate 
thought, they end often by enslaving it."" First Nat'l Bank v. Banco Para El Comercio Exterior de Cuba, 462 U.S. 611, 623, 103 S. 
Ct. 2591, 77 L. Ed. 2d 46 (1983)(considering analogous questions of liability among differing foreign governmental entities)."
1553,5," This ruling is consistent with the conclusion reached by the court in its March 31, 2009 order granting defendants' motion to 
dismiss certain of plaintiff's claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the FTAIA (among other motions). Plaintiff there 
made the same agency arguments as here, but for the purpose of seeking a ruling that its third party relationships supported an 
agency finding for purposes of jurisdiction under the FTAIA. Here, as noted, plaintiff seeks an agency finding with respect to 
defendant's relationship with a subsidiary for liability purposes. "
1556,6," The court also notes that, as was the case in connection with the direct purchaser motions, NTC USA declines here to focus on 
any evidence of a supply reduction. This makes sense, as NTC USA did not manufacture DRAM; it simply sold the DRAM 
manufactured by NTC. It bears repeating, however, that even if NTC USA did not itself engage in a reduction in DRAM output, it 
may nonetheless be held liable for the actions of other co-defendants in reducing their DRAM output, if it is proven that NTC 
USA otherwise participated in an unlawful conspiracy with those defendants. See, e.g., BBD Transp. Co., Inc. v. Southern Pac. 
Transp. Co., 627 F.2d 170, 173 (9th Cir. 1980)(""To be liable as a co-conspirator for the anticompetitive acts of [other co-
conspirators], the railroads need not have known of or participated in those acts themselves.""). "
1557,7," As did the direct purchaser plaintiffs, Sun also relies on economic evidence relating to the structure of the DRAM market for 
proof that it makes economic sense for NTC USA to have participated in the alleged conspiracy. Specifically, plaintiff relies on 
the report by its expert, Dr. Robert Marshall. See Cross MSJ Opp. Decl., Ex. 96 at 71. However, even assuming that Dr. 
Marshall's testimony is capable of successfully refuting defendants' evidence as to whether the DRAM market would be 
receptive to a defendant's participation in the underlying conspiracy, the testimony does not opine that the market would have 
been receptive to NTC USA itself (as opposed to the defendants collectively)  [**40] engaging in a conspiracy, as NTC USA 
points out. For that reason, this type of economic evidence, standing alone, cannot support an inference of NTC USA's 
participation in any underlying conspiracy. "
1558,8," Defendant is, of course, free to renew its hearsay  [**45] objections at trial, to the extent such exhibits are relied upon in the 
future."
1558,9," The court also notes that certain of the email correspondence relied on by plaintiff fails to distinguish between NTC and NTC 
USA, referring only generically to ""Nanya."" This is problematic, since it makes it impossible for the court to determine which 
 [**47] of the Nanya entities the information contained therein should be deemed admissible against. However, many of these "
1559,," emails can readily be sourced to an NTC USA employee or origin. Moreover, when viewed in the aggregate with the totality of 
the evidence submitted by plaintiff, the affected emails do not justify the court's wholesale rejection of plaintiff's evidence or 
arguments. "
1567,1," HN4[
] The determination of whether an agreement unreasonably restrains trade can be based upon per se condemnation or 
under a rule of reason analysis. See Texaco Inc. v. Dagher, 547 U.S. 1, 5-7, 126 S. Ct. 1276, 164 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2006) (noting that 
a per se claim and a rule of reason claim are distinct). Courts will condemn as per se illegal only those agreements that are ""so 
plainly anticompetitive  [**10] that no elaborate study of the industry is needed to establish their illegality."" Nat'l Soc'y of Prof'l 
Eng'rs v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 692, 98 S. Ct. 1355, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1978). For example, ""[p]rice-fixing agreements 
between two or more competitors, otherwise known as horizontal price-fixing agreements,"" are condemned as per se illegal. 
Dagher, 547 U.S. at 5."
1567,2," HN5[
] For a rule of reason claim, ""the finder of fact must decide whether the questioned practice imposes an unreasonable 
restraint on competition, taking into account a variety of factors, including specific information about the relevant business, its "
1568,," condition before and after the restraint was imposed, and the restraint's history, nature, and effect."" State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 
U.S. 3, 10, 118 S. Ct. 275, 139 L. Ed. 2d 199 (1997)."
1568,3, Neither party disputes that the exchange agreements affect interstate commerce. 
1569,4," We note that the decision in Aguilar concerned a summary judgment, not a dismissal for failure to state a claim. "
1575,1, The allegations against the other defendants are similar to the allegations against Chevron.
1575,2," For example, the SAC sets forth a 1994 individual exchange agreement between Chevron and Tosco and alleges: "
1576,," Chevron's intent and purpose in entering into this agreement with Tosco was to place its surplus CARB gas with other 
branded refiners to maximize returns. Chevron intended to and did rearrange its CARB gas supply to avoid a market 
imbalance caused by CARB gas flowing to independent marketers. If Chevron and Tosco agreed to restrain the production of gas, the individual exchange agreement might well be a contract to 
restrain trade pursuant to ยง 1 of the Sherman Act. The paragraph, however, does not say that the parties agreed. Instead, it only 
addresses Chevron's intent and purpose. This purpose and intent would presumably motivate Chevron to act independently or 
interdependently without any agreement as to purpose or intent with Tosco."
1576,3," For example, the SAC alleges that ""[t]hrough the use of  [**39] these exchange agreements, coupled with its own refining 
capacity and that of its contracting partners, Chevron has obtained sufficient market power to limit the supply of CARB gas to 
unbranded marketers and to raise the price at which it sells CARB gas."" This implies a conspiracy and does not allege that there 
was a meeting of the minds of the parties to any of the individual exchange agreements to raise the price of gasoline."
1576,4," For example, the SAC alleges that ""Tosco's intent and purpose in entering into this agreement with Chevron was [to] join the 
'club' of major branded refiners and to give Chevron the opportunity to place its surplus CARB gas with other branded refiners to 
maximize returns."" This is confusing, as it indicates that Tosco's intent was to give Chevron ""the opportunity"" to maximize its 
return. This seems to suggest that the individual exchange agreement facilitated, but did not in itself provide for, the 
maximization of Chevron's return."
1576,5," The Court went on to disapprove the language in Conley that ""a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim 
unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief."" 
Twombly, 127 S. Ct. at 1968 (quoting Conley, 355 U.S. at 45-46). The Court held that: [t]he phrase is best forgotten as an incomplete, negative gloss on an accepted pleading standard: once a claim has been 
stated adequately, it may be supported  [**42] by showing any set of facts consistent with the allegations in the complaint. Twombly, 127 S. Ct. at 1969. "
1577,6," The Court noted: We think that nothing contained in the complaint invests either the action or inaction alleged with a plausible suggestion of 
conspiracy. As to the ILECs' supposed agreement to disobey the 1996 Act and thwart the CLECs' attempts to compete, we 
agree with the District Court that nothing in the complaint intimates that the resistance to the upstarts was anything more 
than the natural, unilateral reaction of each ILEC intent on keeping its regional dominance. The 1996 Act did more than just 
subject the ILECs to competition; it obliged them to subsidize their competitors with their own equipment at wholesale rates. 
The economic incentive to resist was powerful, but resisting competition is routine market conduct, and even if the ILECs 
flouted the 1996 Act in all the ways the plaintiffs allege, . . . there is no reason to infer that the companies had agreed 
among themselves to do what was only natural anyway; so natural, in fact, that if alleging parallel decisions to resist 
competition were enough to imply an antitrust conspiracy, pleading a ยง 1 violation against almost  [**43] any group of 
competing businesses would be a sure thing."
1577,127, S. Ct. at 1971.
1577,7," The district court explained: Even if a single defendant and all of the defendants who contracted with that defendant cumulatively had sufficient market 
power to substantially impair competition, Plaintiffs would need to make the further showing that all of these defendants 
worked together through the use of the exchange agreements and strategic shutdowns or decreased production to stabilize 
the spot market and avoid the depression of gasoline prices. . . ."
1577,8," In Griggs v. Pace Amn. Group, Inc., 170 F.3d 877, 880 (9th Cir. 1999), we held that the ""district court determines the propriety 
of a motion to amend by ascertaining the presence of any of four factors: bad faith, undue delay, prejudice to the opposing party, 
and/or futility."" Generally, ""this determination should be performed with all inferences in favor of granting the motion."" Id. 
Nonetheless, ""we have noted that a district court does not abuse its discretion in denying a motion to amend a complaint . . . 
when the movant presented no new facts but only new theories and provided no satisfactory explanation for his failure to fully 
develop his contentions originally."" Nunes v. Ashcroft, 375 F.3d 805, 808 (9th Cir. 2004) (quoting Vincent v. Trend W. Technical 
Corp., 828 F.2d 563, 570-71 (9th Cir.1987)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, assuming that Gilley could, in the abstract, 
amend his complaint to state a claim that is not precluded by Aguilar, his repeated failure to do just that suggests  [**46] that it 
would be futile to offer him another chance to do so. "
1585,1," See, e.g., AT & T Corp. v. JMC Telecom, LLC, 470 F.3d 525, 531 (3d Cir. 2006) (agreement involving dual distributor 
arrangement remained ""vertical"" and analyzed under the rule of reason); Electronics Communications Corp. v. Toshiba America 
Consumer Products, Inc., 129 F.3d 240, 243 (2d Cir. 1997) (same); Glacier Optical, Inc. v. Optique du Monde, 46 F.3d 1141

Fed. 387 (8th Cir. 1987), (same). "
1597,1," The March 4 Memorandum provides a comprehensive description of plaintiffs' averments. The court recounts only those 
allegations necessary to facilitate disposition of the instant motion. "
1598,2," These defendants include Cadbury Adams Canada, The Hershey Company, Hershey  [**28] Canada, Mars, Mars Snackfood 
U.S., and Nestle U.S.A. The remaining defendants filed simultaneous motions contesting personal jurisdiction, and the court 
deferred their Rule 12(b)(6) motions pending a period of jurisdictional discovery and resolution of threshold jurisdictional issues. 
(See Doc. 582 at 54.) "
1599,3," This question effectively merges the two issues identified by defendants into a single inquiry and reflects the court's duty to 
evaluate the amended complaints in toto. "
1601,4," The parties are currently engaged in a period of limited jurisdictional discovery to facilitate disposition of certain defendants' 
challenges to personal jurisdiction. See supra note 2; (Doc. 582 at 50-53)."
1601,5," The parties dispute the need to separate discovery into class certification and merits phases. The identification of these two 
forms of discovery does not constitute the court's endorsement of a bifurcated discovery schedule. The court has separately 
identified these types of discovery to illustrate the incipient nature of this matter."
1601,6," The parties submitted proposed schedules for class certification discovery via facsimile on January 14, 2009."
1601,7," Defendant Cadbury Adams Canada has filed a motion for reconsideration (Doc. 590) of the March 4 Memorandum on Twombly 
grounds. The motion will be denied as moot pending the outcome of proceedings under ยง 1292(b). Cadbury Adams Canada will 
be permitted to reassert the motion in the event that the Third Circuit declines an appeal or that an appellate decision fails to 
resolve the issues raised therein. "
1611,1," All facts were considered in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, the non-moving parties. Additionally, all facts in this section 
were taken from Plaintiffs' opposition to defendant's motion to dismiss, unless stated otherwise."
1611,2," In 2007, after the citizens petitions in this case were filed, Congress passed a law that allows the FDA to dismiss citizens 
petitions summarily in order to prevent pharmaceutical companies from using this process to unlawfully extend their monopolies. "
1616,3," For example, the Supreme Court of Tennessee held that to maintain an unjust enrichment claim under Tennessee law, the 
plaintiffs must provide more than a bare assertion that attempting to exhaust their remedies against the party with whom they are 
in privity would be futile (in the case at hand this would be the direct purchasers). Freeman Indus., LLC v. Eastman Chem. Co., 
172 S.W.3d 512, 525-26 (Tenn. 2005). "
1622,1," The appellants seek to represent a class of plaintiffs. No action has been taken on class certification, and this appeal does not 
involve any class certification issues. "
1623,2," The Minnesota Legislature has provided that all public utility schedules, rules, and service agreements will be filed with the 
MPUC: HN2[
] Subdivision 1. Public rate filing. Every public utility shall file with the commission schedules showing all rates, 
tolls, tariffs, and charges which it has established and which are in force at the time for any service performed by it within 
the state, or for any service in connection therewith or performed by any public utility controlled or operated by it. Subd. 2. Schedule and rules filing. Every public utility shall file with and as a part of the filings  [**6] under subdivision 1, 
all rules that, in the judgment of the commission, in any manner affect the service or product, or the rates charged or to be 
charged for any service or product, as well as any contracts, agreements, or arrangements relating to the service or product 
or the rates to be charged for any service or product to which the schedule is applicable as the commission may by general 
or special order direct; provided that contracts and agreements for electric service must be filed as required by subdivision 
2a. Subd. 2a. Electric service contract. A contract for electric service entered into between a public utility and one of its 
customers, . . . must be filed for approval by the commission pursuant to the commission's rules of practice. Minn. Stat. ยง 216B.05 (2008). "
1625,3, The district court declined to certify the third issue regarding whether the tariff is ambiguous. 
1626,4," Our discussion  [**19] of appellants' claim for injunctive relief applies equally to the claim for specific performance of tariff 
obligations."
1626,5," Where the legislature provides for exclusive agency jurisdiction, the separation of powers principles that underlie the filed rate 
doctrine may bar the judiciary from acting. But we need not resolve that question in this case because, as discussed below, the 
legislature did not provide for exclusive jurisdiction in the MPUC. "
1628,6," The concurrence contends that we should decline to answer the certified question as to the claim for injunctive relief because 
""[u]nder appellants' interpretation of the tariff, the claim for injunctive relief can go forward; [but] under NSP's interpretation of the 
tariff, the claim is barred by the filed rate doctrine."" The question certified, however, assumes precisely the conflicting 
interpretations  [**25] the concurrence cites, and asks whether the filed rate doctrine bars the court from proceeding when the 
tariff is open to those conflicting interpretations. This case therefore presents a situation appropriate for certification because ""the 
record is developed to the point where the question is relevant and presents a substantive issue."" Thompson v. State, 284 Minn. 
274, 277, 170 N.W.2d 101, 103 (1969). The certified question presented here is not similar to the question certified in the cases 
the concurrence cites where we determined that the question posed was not appropriate for certification. The result in Staples v. 
Zinn, 302 Minn. 149, 152-53, 223 N.W.2d 415, 416-17 n.2 (1974), illustrates this difference. The question certified there was 
whether res judicata applies to a judgment entered in conciliation court. Because the judgments that had been entered in 
conciliation court had been vacated, the question certified was merely hypothetical and thus not appropriate for certification. See 
also F. & H. Invest. Co. v. Sackman-Gilliland Corp., 305 Minn. 155, 158, 232 N.W.2d 769, 772 (1975) (""[T]he question [of the 
constitutionality of the foreclosure by advertisement statute as applied]  [**26] is not appropriate for certification because of the 
outstanding issues of fact which must necessarily be determined and, as well, because certified questions of law must be 
brought to this court after having been decided by the lower court. The mere denial of a motion for judgment because of a broad 
allegation of unconstitutionality is not the kind of question contemplated for certification within the rule.""); Thompson, 284 Minn. 
at 277, 170 N.W.2d at 103 (holding that certification was not appropriate because question presented was ""abstract [and] 
unnecessarily general""); Rude v. Rude, 283 Minn. 524, 525, 166 N.W.2d 719, 719 (1969) (per curiam) (holding that question as 
to ""the 'standard of care required by a plaintiff in the act of rescuing personal property'"" would not be considered under appellate 
rule allowing for certified questions because the standard of care ""has already been fully stated"" (quoting Henjum v. Bok, 261 
Minn. 74, 77, 110 N.W.2d 461, 463 (1961))). "
1629,7," Some courts have recognized that the filed rate doctrine does not bar every  [**31] claim for damages that must be measured 
with respect to the filed rate. For example, in Brown v. MCI Worldcom Network Servs., Inc., 277 F.3d 1166, 1171-72 (9th Cir. 
2002), the Ninth Circuit concluded that the filed rate doctrine would not bar an award of damages in the amount that the 
customer was overcharged above the enforceable rate. Brown is distinguishable from this case because appellants do not allege 
that they paid more than the specific rate set forth in the tariff. Instead, appellants allege that their damages arise from a 
deficiency of services. Appellants' claim suggests that the filed rate is too high if, in fact, NSP did not perform the services that 
the tariff prescribes. A court may not entertain such a claim without implicating rate reasonableness under the filed rate doctrine. 
See, e.g., Wegoland Ltd., 27 F.3d at 21-22 (filed rate doctrine barred RICO action that would require the court to determine a 
reasonable rate absent the fraud because court was incompetent to evaluate rate reasonableness); H.J., Inc., 954 F.2d at 493 
(dismissing RICO action because damages sought to compensate for excessive service charges constituted a retroactive rate 
adjustment); Taffet v. Southern Co., 967 F.2d 1483, 1491-92 (11th Cir. 1992)  [**32] (same); Gulf States Utilities Co. v. Alabama 
Power Co., 824 F.2d 1465, 1472 (5th Cir. 1987) (en banc) (filed rate doctrine barred breach of contract claims seeking ""relief 
based on a rate different from the filed rate,"" but did not bar fact question about the quantity of electrical power sold, where 
contract was between two utilities and not filed with agency). "
1630,8," Other courts have examined the doctrine using these factors: (1) the traditional experience of judges; (2) agency expertise and 
prerogative for discretion; (3) the likelihood that the court's ruling will differ from the agency and erode uniformity; and (4) 
whether the parties have already applied for agency adjudication. AT&T v. MCI Commc'ns Corp., 837 F. Supp. 13, 16 (D.D.C. 
1993); see also MCI Commc'ns Corp. v. AT&T, 496 F.2d 214, 223 (3d Cir. 1974) (assuming that questions raised were ""within 
the ordinary experience of the judiciary,"" but staying the action under the primary jurisdiction doctrine for additional prudential 
considerations). "
1633,9," In reviewing a ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, we accept appellants' factual allegations in the pleading as 
true. Lorix v. Crompton Corp., 736 N.W.2d 619, 623 (Minn. 2007). We are not required to accept appellants' allegations with 
respect to the construction of the tariff. See Int'l Audiotext Network, Inc. v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 62 F.3d 69, 72 (2d Cir. 1995) (but "
1634,," noting that courts ""strive to resolve any contractual ambiguities"" in favor of the nonmoving party in reviewing the dismissal of a 
complaint). "
1639,1, Garrard also sued Gateway. Gateway settled and was dismissed as a party to the suit.
1639,2, Granite Furniture  [**5] Company did not participate in this appeal. 
1647,1," Plaintiffs refer to the clause as a ""waiver,"" but the Court believes that it is more properly labeled a class action ""bar"" because, 
as shown below, Plaintiffs do not have a substantive right to proceed as a class, and, therefore, have not really ""waived"" 
anything. "
1648,2," A ""target area"" is Quiznos' slang for a franchisee's particular geographic area of responsibility."
1648,3," This lawsuit is not the first time Quiznos has dealt with this type of allegation in court. See, e.g., RHC, LLC v. Quizno's 
Franchising, LLC, No. 04CV985, 2005 WL 1799536 (Dist.  [*12] Ct., City and County of Denver July 19, 2005) (lawsuit by former 
Quiznos franchisee against Quiznos for failure to provide real estate assistance)."
1648,4," Plaintiffs also requested an evidentiary hearing, but to their credit, between Plaintiffs' personal declarations and the Quiznos 
documents, Plaintiffs describe the Quiznos franchise sales program with reasonable particularity. "
1649,5," At various points in their briefing, Plaintiffs resort to rhetorical and inflammatory language to describe Quiznos' sales practices, 
e.g., ""charade,"" ""dupe,"" calling Quiznos personnel ""hucksters,"" etc. These discretions from legal civility do not help Plaintiffs' 
case and the Court encourages counsel to pause a moment before resorting to the computer  [*13] thesaurus tool when writing 
their briefs. "
1650,6," In his declaration, Plaintiff Klatt's last name is spelled ""Klatt."" (Doc. # 152.) However, the case caption refers to Plaintiff ""Clatt."" 
The Court assumes this the same person and will refer to Plaintiff Klatt as his named is spelled in his declaration."
1650,7," Plaintiffs have submitted numerous additional descriptions of how they came to sign a Quiznos franchise agreement, but none 
of them differ in any meaningful way from the Bonannos, Mr. Sliwowski or Mr. Klatt's experience --  [*19] each allege that 
Quiznos pressured them into purchasing a franchise without properly explaining the duties that accompanied franchise 
ownership or the one-year deadline. (See, e.g., Docs. # 223, 224, 225 & 226.)"
1650,8," Quiznos argues that failure of Plaintiffs to open a restaurant was not a result of any fraud, but because Plaintiffs failed to 
propose suitable restaurant sites pursuant to the terms of the franchise agreement or, as in the case of Plaintiff Whitehall, they 
failed to  [*20] propose any site at all. (Doc. # 259 at 14.) "
1651,9," Plaintiffs made similar arguments against enforcement of the venue selection clause that they make here against enforcement 
of the class action bar. However, Judge Cavanaugh rejected each of Plaintiffs' arguments. First, he found that Quiznos had not 
fraudulently induced Plaintiffs into agreeing to the venue selection clause. (Doc. # 23 at 5-6.) He held that to avoid application of 
the clause Plaintiffs must show that the venue selection clause itself, as opposed to the entire contract, had  [*24] been 
fraudulently induced and Plaintiffs failed to meet that burden. (Id.) Judge Cavanaugh further rejected Plaintiffs' contention that 
the unequal bargaining power between Quiznos and prospective franchisees rendered the venue selection clause 
unenforceable. (Id. at 6-7.) Judge Cavanaugh also rejected Plaintiffs' claim that the franchise agreement was unreasonable or 
unconscionable because Quiznos presented it on a ""take-it-or-leave-it"" basis. (Id. at 9-10.) "
1652,10," The Counterclaim pleads a breach of contract claim against Plaintiffs for failing to open their restaurants within one-year. (Doc. 
# 255.)"
1652,11," The parties have filed other motions since the Motion for Class Certification, including Plaintiffs' Motion for a Protective Order 
to Enjoin Improper Communications with the Putative Class (Doc. # 268), Plaintiffs' Motion for Rule 11 Sanctions (Doc. # 270), 
and,  [*26] most recently, Quiznos' Motion for Summary Judgment. (Doc. # 312.) The Court will address the other outstanding 
motions in separate orders. "
1655,12," The parties refer to class certification as a ""right,"" so the Court will use this terminology as well. However, as discussed below, 
this terminology is questionable. At most, the ""right"" to proceed as a class is procedural rather than substantive. "
1656,13," Alternatively, if Quiznos did have to show that Plaintiffs knowingly and voluntarily waived their ability to proceed as a class, 
Quiznos has met that burden for many of the same reasons the Court finds that the waiver is not unconscionable under 
Colorado law. See infra. For example, the following facts indicate that Plaintiffs knowingly and voluntarily agreed to ""waive"" their 
right to proceed as a class: Plaintiffs understood what the language in Section 21.4 meant, Quiznos allowed and encouraged 
prospective franchisees to consult with an attorney before signing the franchise agreement, and many Plaintiffs had previous 
business experience, if not previous franchise experience. Moreover, as noted below in the discussion on unconscionability, the 
waiver was printed in normal typeface, and  [*41] was not hidden from other contract terms. Contrary to Plaintiffs' position that 
prospective franchisees should be treated with deference because Quiznos offered them the franchise agreement on a take-it-
or-leave-it basis, this fact alone does not render a waiver unenforceable. See Postnet Int'l Franchise Corp. v. Amercis Int'l, Inc. 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42794, 2006 WL 1775599 (D. Colo. June 26, 2006)."
1656,14," The ""vindication of statutory rights"" argument stems from the Supreme Court case of Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler 
Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U.S. 614, 637, 105 S. Ct. 3346, 87 L. Ed. 2d 444 (1985). In Mitsubishi, the Supreme Court enforced 
a contractual arbitration provision and forced the counterclaimant to arbitrate its antitrust claims. See generally id. The Court 
held that a clause requiring arbitration of statutory claims was valid ""so long as the prospective litigant effectively may vindicate 
its statutory cause of action in the arbitral forum."" Id. (emphasis added). "
1658,15," Kristian acknowledged that ""there are striking similarities between the vindication of statutory rights analysis and the 
unconscionability analysis."" 446 F.3d at 63. However, this similarity notwithstanding, Kristian explicitly declined to analyze state 
unconscionability law."
1658,16," Although, in some cases, the amount was lower and, in some cases, Plaintiffs paid multiple fees, by far the most common 
amounts were either $ 20,000 or $ 25,000."
1658,17," Moreover, Plaintiffs can recover the attorneys fees pursuant to the CCPA and they can recover their costs pursuant to Federal 
Rule 54(d). "
1659,18," The contract clause in Yahoo! was a pure class action bar, similar to the clause in Section 21.4 of the franchise agreement 
 [*55] in this case, as distinguished from the arbitration provisions at issue in nearly all of the other cases that have addressed 
the class action bar. See 251 F.R.D. at 468-69. "
1660,19," Nor does it appear that a court applying Colorado law has addressed the issue of unconscionability in the 
franchisor/franchisee context. "
1661,20," Likewise, although it is not directly applicable to the facts of this case, the U.C.C. recognizes that a contract term's 
""commercial setting, purpose, and effect"" may aid the court in determining whether a term is unconscionable. See C.R.S. ยง 4-2-
302(2). "
1662,21," The DAS was a form that each franchisee signed to acknowledge Quiznos' compliance with federal franchise law. By signing 
the DAS, each franchisee theoretically verified that Quiznos made the appropriate disclosures and allowed the franchisees to 
review those disclosures prior to executing the franchise agreement. "
1663,22," Other individual Quiznos franchisees have brought at least thirty lawsuits against Quiznos for the return of the franchise fee 
after they failed to open a restaurant within one year. (Doc. # 259 at 18.) Interestingly, counsel for Plaintiffs has represented at 
least some of the previous franchisee litigants in individual suits against Quiznos for the return of the franchisee fee. (Id.) "
1664,23," Plaintiffs repeatedly characterize Quiznos' sales strategy as ""aggressive,"" as if repeating the word enough times and adding 
emphasis in their briefs somehow equates it with ""fraudulent."" (See, e.g., Docs. # 235 at 2; 299 at 2.)"
1664,24," In so holding, the Court echoes Judge Cavanaugh's analysis of the venue selection provision. See supra. "
1669,1," Philips contends that in addition to the joint licenses, it also offered a package consisting of only the Philips patents. The 
Commission found otherwise, however, determining as a factual  [**5] matter that Philips-only package licenses did not become 
available until 2000. In addition, in 2001 Philips added additional options by offering packages including only patents that Philips 
deemed ""essential"" to the manufacture of Orange Book compliant compact discs. "
1671,2," ""Absolute time"" refers to the fact that the laser's location is expressed in terms of the time required to scan the spiral groove 
from the start of the disc to the current position."
1671,3," Although the Lagadec patent primarily describes a digital solution, as will be seen, Claim 6 of that patent is arguably not limited 
to digital modulation."
1671,4," The record on appeal is unclear as to whether the Lagadec patent was included in the standard CD-R joint license before 2001, 
when it was expressly listed by Philips in the package of ""essential"" CD-R patents. "
1672,5," The Commission's independent Investigative Attorney (""IA""), whose role as defined in 19 C.F.R. ยง 210.3 is to ""engage in 
investigatory activities in an investigation or a related proceeding,"" did not support any of Princo's per se misuse theories below. 
The IA agreed, however, that inclusion of Lagadec supported a finding of patent misuse under the rule of reason. The IA argued, 
inter alia, that ""Philips included the Lagadec patent"" to ""secure[] Sony's adherence to the . . . Orange Book standard"" and to 
""forestall competition from Sony."" Final Determination at 96, 2007 ITC LEXIS 185. [***1678]"
1672,6," Congress has created a safe harbor in 35 U.S.C. ยง 271(d)(5) for certain types of conduct by patentees lacking market power. 
See III. Tool Works Inc. v. Indep. Ink, Inc., 547 U.S. 28, 41-42, 126 S. Ct. 1281, 164 L. Ed. 2d 26 (2008). In the present case, 
""the Commission found that Philips has market power in the relevant market and that section 271(d)(5) is therefore inapplicable."" 
Philips I, 424 F.3d at 1186. "
1674,7," In full, Claim 6 of the Lagadec patent is as follows:"
1674,6," . A disc-shaped recording medium capable of having a data signal optically recorded thereon and optically reproduced 
therefrom, said recording medium comprising: a substrate layer having first and second surfaces, said first surface having formed thereon a substantially spiral 
pregroove which is wobbled in a radial direction of said disc-shaped recording medium and formed by a control signal 
consisting of a first signal that has a predetermined frequency and that has been modulated by a second signal that 
contains coded information and that has a frequency at least an order of magnitude lower than said predetermined 
frequency; a recording layer formed on the first surface of said substrate layer and adapted for subsequent optically recording the 
data signal thereon; and a protective layer formed on said recording layer. '565 Patent col. 10 ll.14-31. "
1675,8," In its reply brief, Princo argues that because the Commission did not determine whether Lagadec is a blocking patent, we may 
not uphold its decision on this alternative legal ground. This argument misunderstands the holding of S.E.C. v. Chenery Corp., 
318 U.S. 80, 87, 63 S. Ct. 454, 87 L. Ed. 626 (1943). The relevant facts concerning the underlying Orange Book technology are 
undisputed, and whether the patent claims could reasonably be construed to cover that technology is a legal matter well within 
 [**29] the competence of an appellate tribunal to decide. See id. at 88. "
1676,9," See, e.g., Toro Co. v. White Consol. Indus., Inc., 199 F.3d 1295 (Fed. Cir. 1999); Wang Labs., Inc. v. Am. Online, Inc., 197 
F.3d 1377 (Fed. Cir. 1999)"
1676,10," See,  [**30] e.g., Comark Commc'ns, Inc. v. Harris Corp., 156 F.3d 1182, 1186 (Fed. Cir. 1998); Electro Med. Sys., S.A. v. 
Cooper Life Scis., Inc., 34 F.3d 1048, 1054 (Fed. Cir. 1994). "
1677,11," Because we conclude that the licensing practice alleged by Princo would, if proven, violate the rule of reason, we need not 
determine whether it should be evaluated under a per se rule. "
1678,12," As noted by Philips, even when blocking patents are not involved, pooling may in some cases have procompetitive benefits, 
such as enabling licensees to obtain access to alternative  [**39] technologies through one negotiation without determining at 
the outset which technology is the most efficient. Intervenor's Br. 36-37 (citing Andewelt, supra, at 616). "
1680,13," The Commission based its statement that Lagadec's commercial potential was ""doubtful"" on the testimony of a Philips expert 
that the Lagadec method was ""prone to errors,"" ""unreliable,"" and ""unworkable."" Final Determination at 24 n.20, 2007 ITC LEXIS 
185. These statements, however, appear to have been volunteered by the expert during testimony related to the  [**45] validity 
of the Raaymakers '825 and '856 patents, not in the context of whether Lagadec could have been a competitive alternative to the 
Orange Book technologies. "
1681,14," The record appears to contain competing evidence as to Lagadec's potential. On the one hand, both the Commission and 
Philips recognize that Lagadec provided  [**49] an alternative to the Orange Book method. See Final Determination at 24, 2007 
ITC LEXIS 185 (""Lagadec constitutes, at best, a substitute technology. . . .""); Intervenor's Br. 35 (noting that Princo had 
""point[ed] to evidence suggesting that the digital modulation method taught by the Lagadec patent was a technological 
alternative to the analog method of the [Raaymakers] patents""). On the other, Philips's witness suggested that commercial 
development might be difficult. However, the record contains a 1986 Sony memorandum describing the Lagadec proposal that 
suggests potential solutions existed to some of the problems identified by Philips's expert even at that early date. For example, 
the expert stated that the Lagadec encoding method would cause unwanted interference at the low and high ends of the 
frequency spectrum. The memorandum indicates that interference caused by the Lagadec method at high frequencies could be 
reduced by ""simple audio oversampling"" and that interference at low frequencies could be reduced with ""[a] simple digital 
highpass filter."" The patent as issued reflects these solutions. E.g. '565 Patent col.6 ll.47-52; id. col.7 ll.54-58 (discussing band-
limitation to eliminate disturbance  [**50] at high and low frequencies). "
1682,15," Princo points out that when asked if he was ""aware of any separate license agreements between a licensee and Philips 
whereby only certain patents that are identified in the CD-R disc license were licensed,"" a Philips witness testified ""I'm not aware 
of any such license agreements."" J.A. 1934. Such ""business behavior is admissible circumstantial evidence from which the fact 
finder may infer agreement."" Theatre Enters., Inc. v. Paramount Film Distrib. Corp., 346 U.S. 537, 541, 74 S. Ct. 257, 98 L. Ed. 
273 (1954). [***1688] "
1684,1," The parties spend some time debating whether Princo has waived this argument. The Commission and the intervenor contend 
that the ""Zenith"" argument has been waived because neither Princo nor the Investigative Attorney argued that the tying 
arrangement in this case constituted per se patent misuse. Because the Supreme Court's analysis in Zenith is inapplicable here 
in any event, I agree with the majority that it is unnecessary to resolve the waiver question. "
1685,2," The majority asserts that the Commission ""did not determine that Lagadec was fundamentally incapable of being 
commercialized as part of an alternative standard, but merely that it was not workable within the context of existing Orange Book 
technology."" I do not interpret the Commission's statements to be so limited. The expert who testified that the Lagadec approach 
was ""prone to errors""  [**66] (and whose testimony was credited by the administrative law judge) identified several problems with 
Lagadec's approach that were not restricted to the viability of Lagadec as a component of the Orange Book platform. For 
example, the expert noted that ""from basic physics, you can just see that [Lagadec's approach] is not a good solution, and it 
really wouldn't work well."" Thus, while the Commission noted that Lagadec ""does not work well according to the Orange Book 
standards,"" it added, separately, that Princo had ""pointed to no evidence that the Lagadec approach is a commercially viable 
technological alternative to the technology of Philips's '825 or '856 patents,"" and that ""the commercial viability of a method that is 
prone to errors, unreliable, and unworkable is doubtful."" Final Determination 24, 2007 ITC LEXIS 185. Moreover, the burden was 
on Princo to show that pool licensors would have competed in the technology licensing market, and the Commission found that 
Princo did not point to any evidence that Lagadec represented a commercially viable approach, either inside or outside the 
context of the Orange Book standards. "
1694,1," In the instant motions, TCO argues that Plaintiffs' unjust enrichment claims ""are untenable for the same reasons that the 
antitrust claims are untenable, i.e. the rule of Credit Suisse."" TCO's Memorandum in Support, at p. 14. In light of the Court's 
findings regarding the antitrust claims and Credit Suisse, discussed below, this argument does not behoove TCO. However, 
because the Court finds Plaintiffs' unjust enrichment claims untenable for reasons more fully discussed in the Court's order 
addressing Defendants' comprehensive motions for summary judgment, the Court grants summary judgment to TCO as to 
Plaintiffs' unjust enrichment claims."
1694,2," TCO also claims that Verizon Communications, Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP, 540 U.S. 398, 124 S. Ct. 872, 157 
L. Ed. 2d 823 (2004), precludes Plaintiffs' antitrust claims  [**13] because that case ""showed that violations of a regulatory 
regime aimed at promoting competition cannot also transgress antitrust law unless they would have done so in the absence of 
the regulatory regime."" TCO's Memorandum in Support, at p. 8. However, the Court continues to believe, as it explained in its 
denial of Defendants' motion to dismiss, that ""Defendants [including TCO] have not demonstrated that this case involves the 
same level of regulatory overlay and unique market found in Trinko."" June 14, 2005 Memorandum Opinion and Order, 2:04-cv-
867, doc. 371, at p. 16. Thus the Court rejects TCO's contention that Trinko compels summary judgment as to Plaintiffs' antitrust 
claims. To the contrary, the Court continues to ""find[] Otter Tail [Power Co. v. United States, 410 U.S. 366, 93 S. Ct. 1022, 35 L. 
Ed. 2d 359 (1973),] more closely on point."" See id. at p. 16-17. "
1701,1," The parties have declined the jurisdiction of the magistrate judge. Because no Article III judge has been assigned to this case, I 
have assumed jurisdiction over the case temporarily to resolve the parties' current disputes. "
1708,1," Although two entities affiliated with the Clear Channel family have been released from this case after personal jurisdiction was 
found lacking, two other affiliated entities, InstantLive and NextTicketing, remain. They will continue to be referred to as the CCD 
Defendants."
1708,2, The facts described are taken from Plaintiffs' Complaint and are assumed to be true for the purposes of this motion only.
1708,3," An earlier Complaint was filed on February 15, 2006, but was never served. "
1709,4," It is unclear whether the individual partners were ever served with the Third Amended Complaint. Plaintiff appears to argue that 
constructive notice was sufficient, since the CLL firm was itself served with the Amended Complaint on June 5, 2006. The Court 
need not, however, reach the constructive notice argument, since the relevant claims are time-barred whether they are 
measured from the Amended Complaint or the TAC."
1709,5," Plaintiff argues that the May 5 article did not ""disclose"" the misappropriated trade secret, but only ""addressed its practical 
application."" (Opp'n at 11.) However, the TAC itself is clear in stating that disclosure of Plaintiff's ""entire confidential business 
models"" occurred on in that article, on that date."
1709,6," Plaintiff has failed to establish that the earlier Complaint should operate to bring these claims against these Defendants within 
the applicable period. "
1710,7," The TAC attempts to state claims under both section 2 of the Sherman Act and ""the antitrust laws of the states of New York, 
Texas, and California."" (TAC para. 140.) It is unclear from the TAC precisely which state antitrust statutes and  [*10] provisions 
Plaintiff refers to. Based on the TAC and the parties' papers pursuant to this motion, however, there do not appear to be any 
substantive differences amongst the various antitrust claims brought by Plaintiff. "
1711,8," One particularly relevant section of the TAC is in fact entitled ""Defendants Live Nation and Clear Channel Pass Off as Their 
Own The Trade Secrets Misappropriated from Plaintiff."" (TAC s.H.) "
1712,9," Although the parties further submit arguments concerning the statute of limitations applicable to this cause of action, the TAC's 
allegations on this cause are too vague to determine when, precisely, Plaintiff alleges that the tortious interference occurred. 
Because this same vagueness disposes of Plaintiff's  [*16] claim under the Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the Court need not make a 
final conclusion on the issue of timeliness. "
