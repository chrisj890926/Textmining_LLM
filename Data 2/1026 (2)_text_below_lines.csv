Texas against some or all of the Owners involving charges of anti-competitive conduct within the parcel tanker industry. See  
Odfjell ASA v. Celanese AG, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13151, No. 04 Civ. 1758, 2004 WL 1574728, at *1 n. 1 (S.D.N.Y. July 14,

29,4," The appeal of Tokyo Marine Co., Ltd. (Docket No. 03-7913 (CON)) was filed separately from the appeal of Stolt-Nielsen SA, 
Stolt-Nielsen Transportation Group Ltd., Odfjell ASA, Odfjell USA, Inc., Jo Tankers B.V., and Jo Tankers, Inc. (Docket No. 03-

other defendants in their appeal. "
31,5," Even if we were to find that JLM's argument concerned the arbitration term alone, making the question one for the court, there 
is no indication that the arbitration clause itself is an unconscionable or oppressive term of adhesion. HN7[
] ""For an arbitration 
provision to be stricken as a contract of adhesion there must be a showing of unfairness, undue oppression, or 
unconscionability.""  David L. Threlkeld & Co. v. Metallgesellschaft Ltd., 923 F.2d 245, 249 (2d Cir. 1991) (internal quotation 
omitted). See also  Klos, 133 F.3d at 168-69 (""The concept of adhesion . . . may not be invoked to trump the clear language of 
the agreement unless there is a disturbing showing of unfairness, undue oppression, or unconscionability.""). JLM is a large and 
sophisticated commercial enterprise that was familiar with and well understood the ASBATANKVOY's terms. Even where there 
is some disparity in bargaining power, there is no inherent unfairness or unconscionability in an arbitration clause if both parties 
are bound by it and know of its existence. See, e.g.,  Desiderio v. Nat'l Ass'n of Sec. Dealers, Inc., 191 F.3d 198, 207 (2d Cir. 
1999) (holding arbitration clause in form contract on which employment was conditioned not unconscionable contract of 
adhesion because it bound both parties);  Doctor's Assocs., Inc. v. Jabush, 89 F.3d 109, 113 (2d Cir. 1996) (holding franchisees 
who accepted form arbitration agreement as condition of purchasing franchise not unfairly surprised or oppressed). "
36,6," We also note JLM's suggestion that ""this Court's articulation of definitive phraseology"" occurs in our opinion in  Collins & 
Aikman Products Co. v. Building Systems, Inc., 58 F.3d 16 (2d Cir. 1995). Specifically, JLM argues that the following statement 
in Collins & Aikman supports its assertion that the district court properly restricted the scope of the arbitration clause: ""Claims 
that present no question involving construction of the contract, and no questions in respect of the parties' rights and obligations 
under it, are beyond the scope of the arbitration agreement.""  Id. at 23. This, says JLM, is ""the definitive legal standard"" in this 
Circuit regarding the scope of arbitration clauses. But Collins & Aikman also quotes with approval the following passage from 
Genesco: ""If the allegations underlying the claims 'touch matters' covered by the parties' agreements, then those claims must be 
arbitrated, whatever the legal labels attached to them.""  Id. at 21 (quoting  815 F.2d at 846; emphasis and ellipsis omitted). The 
case also presents a clearly distinguishable factual situation in that the Court was faced with claims arising from two distinct 
agreements between the parties; one (""the 1977 agreement"") which contained an arbitration clause and one (""the 1988 
agreement"") which did not. The Court held that only claims arising out of or related to the 1977 agreement would be ""grist for the 
arbitration.""  Id. at 21-22. But even with respect to claims that explicitly sought relief under the 1988 agreement, the Court held 
that it would ""look to the conduct alleged and determine whether or not that conduct is within reach of the 1977 arbitration 
clause.""  Id. at 20. "
37,7," JLM also argues that the ASBATANKVOY's arbitration clause cannot be invoked to compel arbitration of any claim that a given 
Owner is jointly and severally liable for the Sherman Act violations of another Owner. This argument necessarily fails for related 
reasons. The principles of estoppel we have just discussed are not limited to relations among corporate parents and their 
signatory subsidiaries. See, e.g.,  Choctaw, 271 F.3d at 403 (estopping building owner from avoiding arbitration of claim against 
signatory builder's surety);  MS Dealer, 177 F.3d at 948 (estopping car buyer from avoiding arbitration with service company that 
allegedly conspired with signatory car dealership). Each claimed injury under the Sherman Act arises from the fact that JLM 
entered into a charter with a given Owner or its subsidiary; each such charter included the ASBATANKVOY's broad arbitration 
clause. Because, as JLM asserts in its amended complaint, all of the Owners conspired, each with the others, to inflate the 
freight terms of any one such contract, any claim against an Owner jointly liable for the injury caused by that contract is 
inextricably intertwined with the arbitrable claim against the Owner liable under that contract. We do not, in so holding, mean to 
suggest that a claim against a co-conspirator of a party alleged to have engaged in antitrust violations will always be intertwined 
to a degree sufficient to work an estoppel. The inquiry remains a fact-specific one. See, e.g.,  In re Managed Care Litig., 132 F. 
Supp. 2d 989, 995 (S.D. Fla. 2000) (finding that nonsignatory defendants, alleged to be aiders and abettors and co-conspirators 
of signatories, did not have the requisite ""close relationship"" on the facts there present), modified on other grounds,  143 F. 
Supp. 2d 1371 (S.D. Fla. 2001). Cf.  Acquaire v. Canada Dry Bottling, 906 F. Supp. 819, 838 (E.D.N.Y. 1995) (finding that 
claims against ""myriad entities and individuals who . . . participated in and benefitted from the alleged price-fixing"" were 
""peripheral to"" the arbitrable claims). On the facts of this case, however, we easily conclude that non-signatory Owners ""have a 
close relationship with the parties bound to arbitrate,"" that a claim of joint and several liability ""concerns that relationship,"" and 
that ""the dispute is closely linked to a dispute that is subject to arbitration in the underlying contract.""  Choctaw, 271 F.3d at 405. "
38,8," Indeed, following Mitsubishi, several Circuit Courts of Appeals have held that antitrust disputes involving purely domestic 
markets are arbitrable as well. See  Seacoast Motors of Salisbury, Inc. v. DaimlerChrysler Motors Corp., 271 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir. 
2001) (collecting cases). A number of district courts in our Circuit have reached the same conclusion. See  Acquaire, 906 F. 
Supp. at 837 (collecting cases)."
38,9," JLM's comments regarding the wisdom of arbitrating the claims of ""500 to 700 customers"" are purely speculative. Although this 
case is brought as a class action, no class has been certified and, as yet, JLM represents no party but itself. We also note that 
we do not understand JLM to be making any argument to the effect that its assertion of class claims should serve as a bar or 
deterrent to sending the instant case to an arbitral panel. We would likely view such an argument skeptically because HN16[
] 
""federal courts have . . . consistently enforced arbitration provisions in the context of class action lawsuits when federal statutory 
claims have been at issue.""  Lewis Tree Serv., Inc. v. Lucent Techs. Inc., 239 F. Supp. 2d 332, 338 (S.D.N.Y. 2002). "
42,1," In 1999, the Insurance Commissioner was Chuck Quackenbush. The current Commissioner is the appellant John Garamendi."
42,2," The five insurance companies or groups are (1) State Farm General Insurance Company and State Farm Fire and Casualty 
Company (State Farm), (2) 21st Century Insurance Company and 21st Century Casualty Company (21st Century), (3) Allstate 
Insurance Company and Allstate Indemnity Company (Allstate), (4) Fireman's Fund Insurance Company (Fireman's Fund) and 
(5) Farmers Insurance Exchange (Farmers). We refer to these parties collectively as the ""insurers."""
42,3, The facts that we recite are not in dispute. The issues we resolve are entirely issues of law.
42,4," In connection therewith, DOI simultaneously executed a formal Order stating that ""it is understood that the [stipulation] and this 
Order resolve all of those issues identified in the [stipulation] . . . ."""
42,5," For example, State Farm agreed to ""notify . . . all policyholders who made earthquake claims under . . . homeowners single 
limit earthquake policies arising out of the Northridge earthquake [of possible additional action on their claims]."" State Farm also 
agreed to ""review the claim files of responding policyholders to verify . . . that each responding policyholder has received the 
benefits under the earthquake policy to which that policyholder is entitled."" DOI does not dispute that (1) State Farm sent out 
35,000 notices to claimants; (2) approximately 1,400 claimants responded; (3) State Farm made approximately $ 3 million in "
43,," additional payments to policyholders who responded; and (4) State Farm presented the results of its claims review process to 
DOI."
43,6," We note that the trial court expressly found that the stipulation was intended to ""conclude all regulatory action"" and the letter 
agreement relating to the $ 2 million contribution to CRAF were ""two separate and independent agreements."""
43,7," According to 21st Century, the $ 550,000 was to have been allocated $ 200,000 to DOI's ""Public Education/Outreach Fund,"" $ 
100,000 to a fine charged to 21st Century (allegedly, it was the only one of the five insurers subjected to a fine) and $ 250,000 to 
be spent on matters ""relating to seismic studies and other earthquake-related issues."" This allocation is reflected in 
correspondence to DOI from the president of 21st Century. At the conclusion of the negotiations, however, an agreement was 
apparently reached providing that the $ 550,000 sum was simply to be generally allocated without the specific earmarking 
proposed by 21st Century."
43,8, DOI makes no claim that Fireman's Fund did not fully perform this commitment. 
44,9," It should be noted that CIEP is a different public benefit corporation than CRAF. Farmers was the only insurer that made its 
contribution to CIEP; the other four all made their contributions directly or indirectly to CRAF. "
45,10," The Legislature's investigation also led to the resignation of Commissioner Quackenbush. It is apparently the view of the 
current Commissioner that the agreements made with the several insurers were not in the public interest and he has expressed 
his desire to revisit the market conduct issues that were purportedly resolved by the several settlement agreements."
45,11," Neither the Attorney General nor DOI has ever alleged that any of the insurers had any knowledge of, much less participated 
in, or were responsible for, the subsequent misuse of money by individuals associated with the DOI or CRAF. Indeed, DOI 
concedes that the insurers have engaged in no unlawful conduct in settling their administrative cases."
45,12," In support of his application for a preliminary injunction, the Attorney General alleged that (1) ""the settlements between DOI 
and insurance companies . . . were solicitations for contributions for specific purposes . . . related to earthquake education, 
earthquake relief, seismic research, and other earthquake-related issues."" (2) ""CRAF was created specifically to address 
earthquake-related issues . . . . The directors of CRAF had a fiduciary duty to use the funds obtained in connection with the 
settlement agreements for the purposes for which the insurance companies were told such funds would be used . . . ."" (3) ""The 
contributions [to CRAF] were solicited for specific earthquake-related purposes."" In support of his complaint for injunctive relief, 
the Attorney General: (1) claimed that ""the settlement monies were solicited by DOI for use in addressing topics relating to 
earthquake study and education and to provide financial relief to earthquake victims;"" (2) solicited and submitted to the Superior 
Court a declaration by State Farm's Associate General Counsel, who had participated in the settlement negotiations. Said 
counsel declared, in support of the Attorney General's claim, that CRAF's funds were restricted to earthquake-related purposes, 
and that ""State Farm understood its contribution would be used for the purpose of engaging in seismic safety research and 
public education;"" and (3) objected to evidence offered by the CRAF defendants and argued that there was ""no foundation"" for 
testimony that ""CRAF was free to dedicate funds to worthy non-earthquake-related charities."" Those objections were sustained."
45,13," We presume that the Attorney General's announcement of such ""potential legal actions"" had reference to the proceedings that 
are now before us. "
46,14," As we explain below, no such requirement was in fact included in any of the settlement agreements and the Attorney 
General's argument to us misconstrues and misapplies his opinion."
46,15, DOI does not argue that this prospective legislation is applicable in this case.
46,16," We specifically note that these allegations are directly contrary to the position taken by the Attorney General earlier in the 
CRAF action (the Sacramento Superior Court proceeding discussed above) where he successfully asserted that the court 
should enjoin the expenditure of funds by CRAF because the settlement agreements pursuant to which funds were delivered to 
CRAF did prohibit the use of funds for any purpose unrelated to earthquake issues. While these circumstances might arguably 
raise the issue of judicial estoppel in this action (and the trial court in fact so held), we do not reach or further discuss such issue. 
We can and do decide this case on the other two grounds relied upon by the trial court."
46,17," The Attorney General did not appeal from the entry of judgment in favor of the insurers. He, however, does appear in this 
matter as counsel for DOI. Thus, DOI is the only remaining appellant. "
47,18," As already indicated (see fn. 16, ante), we do not reach or discuss this argument. "
48,19," In its briefs on appeal, the DOI concedes that the Commissioner had a broad discretionary authority to enter into settlement of 
the administrative disputes with the insurers."
48,20," Unless otherwise indicated, all statutory references are to the Government Code. "
49,21, Nothing in the authorities relied upon by the DOI compels a contrary conclusion. 
51,22," Similarly, in the fall of 1994, the then and present Commissioner Garamendi settled a pending rate application dispute with 
21st Century. Among the terms of the settlement were the requirements that 21st Century ""expend no less than $ 50,000"" on 
community action programs in the Oakland-San Francisco area and ""invest $ 1,000,000"" in banks in the Oakland-San Francisco 
areas, with the particular institutions to be selected by a consumer group."
51,23," As already noted, the subsequent Legislative enactment, in September of 2000, of amendments to the Insurance Code to 
prohibit settlements by the Insurance Commissioner that provide for a respondent to contribute or deposit any money to a 
nonprofit agency or to pay any fine or assessment except in accordance with Insurance Code Section 12975.7 (Stats. 2000, c. 
1091 (S.B. 2107 (Sen. Speier)) (amending Ins. Code, §§ 12921 & 12975.)), cannot establish, retrospectively, a public policy 
applicable to transactions taking place one year earlier. DOI does not otherwise contend. "
54,1," Plaintiff's initial response rested largely upon the contention that it could not meaningfully address the issues raised in 
Defendants' motion absent its (and, more importantly, its expert's) opportunity to review various documents sought from non-
party BCBSM. Following its resolution of this discovery dispute, the Court granted both sides an opportunity to file a 
supplemental brief and supporting exhibits addressing the matters uncovered in this last round of discovery. Both sides elected 
to take advantage of this offer, with Plaintiff filing a supplemental brief and expert's affidavit on April 21, 2004, and Defendants 
filing a supplemental reply and supplemental expert's affidavit on May 26, 2004. "
55,2," Plaintiff also refers occasionally to the Northwood/NPN (""NNPN"") network, which apparently is the administrative counterpart to 
Defendant ABP for certain health benefit plans offered to General Motors employees and retirees. Although the record 
somewhat unclear on this point, Plaintiff apparently alleges that the NNPN network is administered as a joint venture between 
Defendant W&F and one of its competitors, Binson's Home Health. Neither Binson's nor NNPN has been named as a party, 
however, and Plaintiff's complaint does not specifically refer to either the NNPN network or any General Motors health benefit 
plans."
55,3," ""SUPPORT"" is an acronym for ""Select Utilization of Providers for Prosthetic, Orthotic and Rehabilitative Technology."""
55,4," As explained by Defendants, HMO-based plans were excluded from the SUPPORT program because an HMO essentially is an 
across-the-board ""carve-out,"" consisting of an exclusive set of providers for all health care services. "
56,5," The proposal estimated that this ""capitated arrangement"" would result in a 22 percent cost savings over the existing fee-for-
service methodology, which ""translates into $4,729,354 million in projected savings to Chrysler and the UAW over a two year 
period for DME/P&O benefits,"" (Defendants' Motion, Ex. 7, Ruloff Aff., Ex, U, Sept. 1991 SUPPORT Proposal at 1.)"
56,6," This sanction was defined as 20 percent of the fee negotiated by W&F with the out-of-network provider, up to a calendar-year 
maximum of 5500 that a plan participant would have to pay out of his or her own pocket for services from out-of-network 
vendors. "
57,7," ""[T]aken together, these three cases signal to the lower courts that summary judgment can be relied upon more so than in the 
past to weed out frivolous lawsuits and avoid wasteful trials."" 10A Charles A, Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary K. Kane, Federal 
Practice & Procedure, § 2727, at 468 (1998) (footnote omitted). "
58,8," As Defendants point out, the alleged combination must involve entities other than W&F and ABP, because a parent and its 
wholly owned subsidiary have a ""complete unity of interest,"" and thus cannot form an unlawful agreement within the reach of § 1 
of the Sherman Act. Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Com., 467 U.S. 752, 771-74, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 2741-43 (1984)."
58,9," As noted earlier, while the initial pleadings are silent on the subject, Plaintiff has suggested in its more recent submissions that 
a conspiracy might exist among Defendants and Binson's Home Health, another DME/P&O vendor, to exclude B&H from the 
NNPN network that serves General Motors employees and retirees. As will become clear, any such additional conspiracy would 
not affect the disposition of Plaintiff's claims in this case. "
59,10," In any event, Plaintiff' would have some difficulty in making such a showing, as its business has experienced strong growth 
despite its exclusion from the SUPPORT network. "
62,11," Even less tenable is the relevant market definition proposed in Dr. Pisarkiewief's most recent affidavit — namely, a market 
consisting solely of ""the ABP and Northwood NPN networks."" (Plaintiff's Suppl. Br., Ex. 2, Pisarkiewicz 4/20/2004 Aff. at ¶ 31.) 
As pointed out by Defendants' expert, this tautological approach would invariably lead to the conclusion that every exclusive 
dealing arrangement results in an unlawful monopoly, because the suppliers who are shut out of this arrangement plainly have 
been excluded from 100 percent of this ""market."" (See Defendants' Motion, Ex, 14, Lynk 11/21/2003 Aff. al, ¶ 19.) Moreover, 
this market definition is impossible to square with Plaintiff's own business records, which reflect strong sales performance — 
and, indeed, impressive growth - despite Plaintiff's exclusion from the SUPPORT and NNPN networks. Plainly, at least some 
DME/P&O customers remain available to Plaintiff despite its exclusion from these networks. "
63,12," As noted, Plaintiff suggests that the market is further foreclosed by virtue of the exclusive NNPN network that (presumably) 
captures most or all of the DME/P&O sales to the ""large"" group of General Motors employees and retirees. Plaintiff further 
suggests that this foreclosure is chargeable to Defendants, as W&F apparently is involved in a joint venture with Binson's Home 
Health to administer the NNPN network. Leaving aside the lack of allegations or evidence as to the precise nature of this 
arrangement or its effect on the relevant market, and leaving aside the possible concern that only one of the two joint venturers 
has been named as a party, the potential significance of the NNPN network is overcome by Plaintiffs larger failure, discussed 
below, to put forward any tenable theory of substantial market foreclosure."
63,13," With regard to the NNPN network, this claim of ""control"" necessarily rests upon Defendant W&F's purported status as a joint 
venturer with non-party Binson's Home Health. No evidence has been provided, however, regarding the precise nature of this 
joint venture or the respective powers possessed by W&F and Binson's over the composition of this network."
63,14," Giving Plaintiffs expert the benefit of the doubt, perhaps Dr. Pisarkiewicz's discussion of outlets was intended primarily to rebut 
the references to outlets in the initial affidavit of Defendants' expert, Dr. Lynk, Yet, immediately following his review of Defendant 
W&F's share of the overall number of retail DME/P&O outlets in Michigan and in the Detroit metropolitan area, Dr. Lynk carefully 
emphasizes: Using a count of retail outlets is a fairly crude way of estimating DME market shares, since different outlets can and do 
differ substantially in their amount of DME sales. The principal value of these DME [outlet] tabulations is that they are based 
entirely upon public data. But the best way to estimate shares in this market is by sales revenue. (Defendants' Motion, Ex. 14, Lynk 11/21/2003 Aff. at ¶ 36.) Dr. Pisarkiewicz's affidavit notably lacks any such qualifying language. In any event, even if he understands the limited value of 
an outlet-based analysis, his client evidently does not. In particular, Plaintiff relies broadly and substantially upon this approach "
64,," in its most recent brief in opposition to Defendants' motion, stating at a number of points that Dr. Pisarkiewicz's analysis 
demonstrates a market foreclosure rate of 46 percent. (See Plaintiff's Supp. Br. at i, 9-, 11, 12-13, 19-20.)"
64,15," Beyond asserting that some of Defendants' figures are wrong, Dr. Pisarkiewicz repeatedly complains of his inability to make 
sense of Dr. Lynk's or Defendants' underlying financial data. The customary way to resolve such uncertainty, of course, is to 
depose the Opposing party's expert and its corporate officials with knowledge of the company's finances. It appears that Plaintiff 
has taken the depositions of at least some of Defendants' corporate officers. However, while Plaintiff apparently issued a notice 
scheduling the deposition of Dr. Lynk for September 25, 2003, it appears that this deposition did not go forward. No motion has 
ever been filed concerning this matter, and Plaintiff did not otherwise seek the Court's assistance in securing Dr. Lynk's 
attendance at a deposition. Thus, Plaintiff cannot properly complain about any inability to explore Dr. Lynn reasoning, where it 
failed to properly pursue this matter in accordance with the usual discovery rules and this Court's orders. "
65,16," Lynk also derives a comparable, 15.43 percent market foreclosure rate using figures obtained solely from Plaintiff and its 
expert. Specifically, Dr. Lynk notes that B&H reported revenues of $3,589,213 for 2003, and that, according to Dr. Pisarkiewicz's 
calculations, B&H would have attained additional revenues of $654,893 if it had been admitted into the SUPPORT network. 
Adding these two figures results in a hypothetical total of $4,244,106, of which the ""denied"" revenues of $654,893 comprises 
15.43 percent. This calculation, while inferior to a direct determination of the SUPPORT network's share of the overall DME/P&O 
market, at least tends to confirm that Plaintiff's exclusion from the SUPPORT network has not thwarted an abundance of sales 
opportunities that Plaintiff otherwise would have enjoyed. "
66,17," Indeed, Plaintiff elsewhere concedes that ""there is no easy method to measure quality of DME."" (Plaintiff's Suppl, Br, at 13.) 
Regardless of the difficulty of proof on this issue, the brute fact remains that the record is devoid of any evidence that plan 
participants or DME/P&O consumers generally have suffered a reduction in quality as a result of the SUPPORT program. "
68,18," Notably, in light of this apparent absence of barriers to entry, Plaintiff's ""price control"" evidence is even less probative on the 
issue of Defendants' monopoly power over the DME/P&O market. As Defendants' expert correctly points out, ""[i]f a would-be 
local 'monopolist' finds that an attempt to profit by raising price significantly above the competitive level is defeated by the entry 
of new competitors who are attracted by the high prevailing prices, then the 'monopolist' lacks monopoly power."" (Defendants' 
Motion, Ex. 14, Lynk 11/21/2003 Aff at ¶ 45.) As applied here, if Defendants' capitation rates are artificially high, this presumably 
would attract competitors who would seek to challenge their hold on the DME/P&O business generated through the SUPPORT 
program — and BCBSM would be free, of course, to turn to these competitors when the SUPPORT contract came up for 
renewal, "
69,19," Indeed, Defendants correctly observe that Plaintiff's theory of damages is apparently at odds with any claim of injury to 
competition as a whole. If the violation here stems from the exclusive nature of the SUPPORT program, the obvious cure would 
be to open the SUPPORT network to all DME/P&O providers. In this event, or course, B&H would not be the only beneficiary of 
an open market, but would have to compete in this marketplace against all other DME/P&O vendors that previously were 
excluded from the SUPPORT network, Yet, Plaintiffs computation of its damages seemingly fails to account for, or even 
address, the significantly increased field of DME/P&O competitors if the SUPPORT network were no longer exclusive. In 
Defendants' view, Plaintiff's theoretical increased revenues would be quite modest, amounting to perhaps only 1.5 percent of its 
overall revenues, if the SUPPORT network were open to all DME/P&O providers, "
75,1," Defendants' Motion for Clarification was held in abeyance pending final approval of the Plaintiffs' settlement with E.I. DuPont de 
Nemours and Company, and DuPont Performance Coatings, Inc. (collectively ""DuPont""); and BASF Aktiengesellschaft, BASF 
Coatings AG, and BASF Corporation (collectively ""BASF"")."
75,2, We do not discuss the relevant time frame for production of documents as our prior Order was clear on that point. 
79,3," Defendants suggest that In re Vitamins is inapplicable because that case dealt with an alleged global conspiracy to control the 
market. Despite the fact that a global conspiracy was alleged, the court in that case limited Plaintiffs claims to those injuries ""with 
a sufficient United States nexus,"" making that case quite analogous to the instant matter. In re Vitamins Antitrust Litig., 2001 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8904, 2001 WL 1049433, at *11. "

91,3," I excluded consideration of the Kotz brochure for purposes of § 102 because of the lack of evidence that it had been printed or 
distributed before August 15, 1985. But even if it were prior art, while Zimmer's argument with respect to the Kotz Brochure is 
that it was well-known in the industry, it provides no evidentiary support for that statement. Inventors Bolesky and Smith testified 
that they did not see the Kotz Brochure until after the '706 Patent issued. Zimmer notes that inventor Charles Whitcraft, in his 
deposition, stated that he had seen the Kotz brochure sometime ""in the past."" Mr. Whitcraft's deposition was taken November 
20, 2002. While his statement proves he saw the Kotz brochure before the date of the deposition, it does not prove that he saw it 
prior to the issuance of the '706 Patent. Finally, Zimmer points out that attorney William R. Coffey stated in his deposition that if 
he had known about the Kotz brochure, he would have submitted it. This statement certainly does not prove that Mr. Coffey 
knew of the brochure and intentionally failed to submit it; if anything, it tends to prove the opposite. "
92,4," Zimmer styles its patent misuse pleading as a counterclaim. However, HN15[
] patent misuse is an affirmative defense, not, a 
counterclaim. See, e.g., B. Braun Med., Inc. v. Abbott Labs, 124 F.3d 1419, 1427-28 (Fed. Cir. 1997)."
92,5, Emphasis added.
92,6," Answer and Affirmative Defenses filed June 27, 2002; Answer and Amended Affirmative Defenses filed July 16, 2002; and 
Amended Answer, Affirmative Defenses and Counterclaims filed October 22, 2002. "
93,7, Zimmer claims that the relevant geographic market is the United States; DePuy does not challenge that claim.
93,8," The relevance of these experts' reports is questionable, as neither expert analyzed a relevant market for antitrust purposes. 
See Berlyn, Inc. v. Gazette Newspapers, 223 F. Supp. 2d 718, 729 (D. Md. 2002). Mr. Weidenbenner's testimony is also of 
questionable value, as his comments are from the perspective of marketing efforts, not antitrust analysis. See Independent Ink, 
Inc. v. Trident, Inc., 210 F. Supp. 2d 1155, 1170 (C.D. Cal. 2002). "
99,1," Section 2(a) indicates, in relevant part: HN3[
] It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, either directly or 
indirectly, to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality … where the effect 
of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or 
to injure, destroy or prevent competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such 
discrimination, or with customers of either of them."
99,15, U.S.C. § 13(a). 
100,2," Section 2(d) states: It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce to pay or contract for the payment of anything of value to or for the 
benefit of a customer of such person in the course of such commerce as compensation or in consideration for any services 
or facilities furnished by or through such customer in connection with the processing, handling, sale, or offering for sale of 
any products or commodities manufactured, sold, or offered for sale by such person, unless such payment or consideration 
is available on proportionally equal terms to all other customers competing in the distribution of such products or 
commodities."
100,15, U.S.C. § 13(d).
100,3," Section 2(d) provides: It shall be unlawful for any person to discriminate in favor of one purchaser against processing, by contracting to furnish or 
furnishing, or by contributing to the furnishing of, any services or facilities connected with the processing, handling, sale, or 
offering of sale of such commodity so purchased upon terms not accorded to all purchasers on another purchaser or 
purchasers of a commodity bought for resale, with or without proportionally equal terms."
100,15, U.S.C. § 13(e).
100,4," Plaintiffs have failed to present any case where a similar group of plaintiffs has been permitted to group plead their claims 
under the Clayton Act. Instead, Plaintiffs invest their efforts in attempting to distinguish the instant case from Mountain View and 
Chawla. "
101,5," Notably, Defendant has cited persuasive authority indicating that Robinson-Patman Act claims, such as the case at bar, are 
inherently unsuited for class treatment. See Mekani v. Miller Brewing Co., 93 F.R.D. 506, 511 (E.D.Mich. 1982) (""Each class 
member's proof as to competitive injury and thus to liability will be highly individualistic. For this reason the courts have generally 
denied class action motions in Robinson-Patman Act cases.""). Plaintiffs appear to concede this point by recommending that this 
litigation be split up into groups of ten plaintiffs and tried one at a time. "
102,*," After an examination of the briefs and the record, we have concluded that oral argument is unnecessary. Thus, the appeal is 
submitted on the briefs and the record. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2). "
115,1," Under Indiana law as summarized in Sedona Development Group, Inc. v. Merrillville Road Ltd. P'ship, 801 N.E.2d 1274, 1278 
n.1 (Ind. App. 2004), the defense of accord and satisfaction requires proof that: (1) there is a good faith dispute; (2) the sum in 
dispute is not liquidated; (3) there is consideration; (4) there is a meeting of the minds or evidence that the parties intended to 
agree to an accord and satisfaction; and (5) there is a performance of the contract. Plaintiffs' response to the motion for 
summary judgment challenges Funeral Depot's ability to satisfy the fourth element, upon which Funeral Depot has the burden of 
proof."
115,2," Plaintiffs continue to seek damages for the earlier use of their photographs on the funeraldepot.com and casketsnow.com 
websites, though Funeral Depot's alleged infringement seems not to have damaged plaintiffs at all and Funeral Depot's sales of 
Batesville caskets were modest (gross revenues in the five-figures). As a result of these modest claims for damages, the license 
and linking issues discussed below based on the Veterans Society links could not resolve the entire case. "
120,3," For purposes of deciding this issue on defendant's motion for summary judgment, the court must assume that the Veterans 
Society's use of plaintiffs' photographs is not authorized by plaintiffs. "
122,4," Regulations have included special provisions that do not always require that complete copies of computer programs be 
submitted with the copyright registration. See 37 C.F.R. § 202.20(c)(2)(vii). "
124,5," If Funeral Depot were creating links to independent dealer websites that display plaintiffs' copyrighted photographs of caskets, 
the case might be closer to the Ticketmaster case discussed above, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4553, 2000 WL 525390. Instead, 
however, it is offering links to the Veterans Society website with pages that Funeral Depot designed, with prices that Funeral 
Depot selected, and with Funeral Depot's telephone number. "
127,1," Defendants filed the instant Motion in response to Plaintiff's Original Complaint of February 18, 2004. Plaintiff's Amended 
Complaint of May 28, 2004 added two new defendants, but made no changes to the antitrust claim. The Court treats the instant 
motion as addressed to the antitrust claim in the Amended Complaint. "
136,1," Xerox also argues that, even if there is an aftermarket for Xerox high volume copiers, that does not explain the various 
restrictions put on CCS's definition, such as the requirement that the copiers' weight exceed 1,000 pounds. I agree that the more 
narrowly tailored a market specification is, the more difficult it will be to justify, but, I am unclear whether all the elements in 
CCS's definition are restrictive, or if some are merely descriptive. For example, I am not clear whether CCS means to define the 
market as high volume copiers that weigh more than 1,000 pounds, or, if it merely means, high volume copiers, which weigh 
more than 1,000 pounds. Because this is a motion to dismiss, I assume CCS intends the less restrictive form. "
137,2," Of course the existence of a bona fide short-term profit motivation may be strong, or even conclusive, evidence that the 
challenged conduct is not anticompetitive, but that is a question for summary judgment or trial, not a motion to dismiss. "
138,3," To the extent that CCS is alleging that because some of Xerox's price increases violated the terms of its prior settlement 
agreement they are necessarily anticompetitive, the argument is without merit. Xerox's prior settlements did not alter the antitrust 
laws."
138,4," Xerox argues that this allegation does not allege an antitrust injury, but simply an injury to CCS, i.e., harm to a competitor not 
competition. I am not persuaded. One could infer from CCS's allegations that Xerox was effectively prohibiting customers from 
buying machines if the customers indicated a desire to use an ISO for service. Ultimately CCS may not be able to prove such 
general activity, but that does not matter at this stage."
138,5," This is in contrast to CCS's other allegations where it is, in part, alleging that Xerox charged too high a price - not that Xerox 
charged some price. It is certainly possible to lose profit by charging too high a price, but it is difficult to see how it could be less 
profitable to charge some price than to charge no price. Even if such a situation exists, CCS has not alleged facts that support 
the inference that this is such a situation. "
148,1," The parties dispute the reasons for the IMPI dismissal. InterCorp's complaint states that IMPI dismissed the charges ""based on 
Defendants' due process violations and clear and convincing evidence exonerating InterCorp on all charges."" (Docket Entry No. 
1, P 20). According to the defendants, ""The government investigator who conducted the May 2000 inspection of InterCorp's 
offices (and determined that InterCorp was using unlicensed software) had failed to properly document his findings."" (Docket 
Entry No. 11, p. 2, n. 1). The dispute as to the reasons for the dismissal does not affect the analysis of limitations. "
157,2," Even if the substantive law of other jurisdictions applied to InterCorp's claims in this case, those other jurisdictions often apply 
statutes of limitations identical to or shorter than Texas. Both Texas and the District of Columbia set a one-year limit on 
malicious prosecution claims. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 16.002; D.C. CODE ANN. § 12-301(4) (2001). The District 
of Columbia and the state of Washington apply the same or shorter statutes of limitation than Texas for business disparagement 
claims. See D.C. CODE ANN. § 12-301(4) (2001) (one-year limit for defamation); WASH. REV. CODE ANN. § 4.16.100(1) 
(West 2004) (two-year limit for defamation). A three-year statute of limitations, shorter than the Texas four-year statute, applies 
to breach of contract actions in the District of Columbia and to breach of oral contracts under Washington law. See D.C. CODE 
ANN. § 12-301(7) (2001) (three years on simple contract); WASH. REV. CODE ANN. § 4.16.080(3) (West 2004) (three-year 
limitations on unwritten contract). Taking into account only those claims to which other jurisdictions apply a longer limitations period than Texas leaves: (1) 
malicious prosecution under Washington law with a three-year limitations period; (2) abuse of process, tortious interference, and 
negligence under the District of Columbia or Washington's three-year limitations periods; and (3) breach of contract under 
Washington's six-year limitation for written contracts. As discussed, as to these claims, the Texas limitations period would apply. One point is worth noting on the breach of contract claim. Nothing is known about the specifics of any licensing agreement. If a 
hypothetical, unpleaded written licensing agreement contained a valid choice-of-law provision selecting Washington law, 
InterCorp might argue that this court should apply the law of the states chosen by the parties to govern their contractual rights 
and duties. See RESTATEMENT 2D CONFLICT OF LAWS, § 187(1) (""The law of the state chosen by the parties to govern their 
contractual rights and duties will be applied if the particular issue is one which the parties could have resolved by an explicit 
provision in their agreement directed to that issue.""). Even this argument would not allow InterCorp to avoid limitations. HN27[

Under Texas law, ""if the action is barred by the statute of limitations of the forum court in which the lawsuit is pending, no action 
can be maintained even if the action is not barred in the state where the cause of action arose."" Hollander v. Capon, 853 S.W.2d 
723, 727 (Tex. App. -- Houston [1st Dist.] 1993) (rejecting arguments that New York's six-year statute of limitations should apply 
to avoid Texas's four-year limitation on an action on a debt). "
182,1," At the time of the complaint's filing, Alan Gardner, M.D. (Dr. Gardner), a board certified anesthesiologist employed by 
ProMedica West, was included as a plaintiff in the action. Dr. Gardner dismissed his claims on July 20, 2004. (Doc. 99.)"
182,2," Specifically, the complaint named four physicians, John J. Racciato, M.D., William H. Richter, M.D., John W. Shaw, M.D., and 
Jeffrey A. Pruitt, M.D., and four nurse anesthetists, TerryHowarth, CRNA, Douglas Lee, CRNA, John Yeoman, CRNA, and 
Kathryn Schwindl Watson, CRNA."
182,3," Plaintiffs also seek a declaratory judgment that the exclusive anesthesia contract between Defiance Hospital and ProMedica 
West is ""reasonable and appropriate in light of the circumstances confronting plaintiffs, that it does not violate any legal rights of 
defendants, and that plaintiffs are not liable to defendants in any way for or in relation to their implementation of said contract."" 
(Doc. 35, at 16.) Neither party has sought summary judgment on this claim, and therefore, I will not address the merits of Count 
Seven of plaintiffs' complaint. "
183,4," Chad Peter subsequently informed the Hospital that the Clinic CRNAs would no longer provide anesthesia services to Dr. 
Shehata's patients and stated: ""If an emergency should arise with a physician not contracted with Clinic, we would not allow our 
CRNAs to perform services unless the surgery is performed by a physician who has a contract with us or a Clinic surgeon."" 
(Doc. 113, 115, at 7.) "
186,5," I decline to require the Hospital to expose its patients to the threat of physical harm for the mere purpose of giving patients 
standing to bring this litigation. "
188,6, Another CRNA practiced only at Community Memorial Hospital in Hicksville.
188,7," In Brader, the court listed the following cases as illustrative: Collins v. Associated Pathologists, Ltd., 844 F.2d 473, 480 n.5 (7th Cir.) (physician was ""slicing the geographic market 
much too thin"" in limiting market to one hospital), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 852, 102 L. Ed. 2d 110, 109 S. Ct. 137 (1988); 
Seidenstein v. National Medical Enterprises, Inc., 769 F.2d 1100, 1106 (5th Cir. 1985) (no evidence that the hospital ""is

Cuneo-Cabrini Medical Ctr., 684 F.2d 1346, 1353 (7th Cir. 1982) (noting that ""we have reason to doubt whether the 
relevant market can be sliced so small as to embrace only a single hospital""); Flegel v. Christian Hosp. Northeast-

Memorial Hosp., 672 F. Supp. 171, 195 (E.D. Pa. 1987), aff'd, 849 F.2d 600 (3d Cir. 1988). "
189,64, F.3d at 878.
189,8," See e.g. Collins v. Associated Pathologists, Ltd., 844 F.2d 473, 474 (7th Cir. 1988) (antitrust suit by pathologist against a 
hospital and a physicians' group providing pathology services to the hospital challenging an exclusive arrangement for the 
provision of such services); cert. denied, 488 U.S. 852 (1988); Seidenstein v. National Med. Enters., Inc., 769 F.2d 1100, 1101 
(5th Cir. 1985) (antitrust claim by physician against hospital and other physicians arising from the suspension of the physician's 
medical staff privileges at the hospital); Dos Santos v. Columbus-Cuneo-Cabrini Med. Ctr., 684 F.2d 1346, 1347 (7th Cir. 1982) 
(antitrust suit by an anesthesiologist challenging an exclusive dealing contract for the provision of anesthesia services at a 
hospital); Flegel v. Christian Hosp. Northeast-Northwest, 804 F. Supp. 1165, 1167 (E.D. Mo. 1992) (antitrust suit against a

suit by physician against hospital arising out of the revocation of the physician's staff privileges), aff'd, 849 F.2d 600 (3d Cir. 
1988)."
189,9," The fact that the Hospital can recruit anesthesia service providers from all across the nation, or for that matter, from all over the 
world, is also irrelevant. Once that recruit arrives and takes residence within a twenty-minute radius of the Hospital, the rural 
nature of the area limits that physician to administering anesthesia only at the Hospital, and thereby competing with defendants 
for the limited number of independent physicians' patients who require anesthesia services. "
190,10," No competitors successfully entered the market from 1991 to 2000, until Dr. Gardner did so in 2000. Although no competitors 
entered the market, plaintiffs have failed to present any evidence of any attempted entry into the market. Plaintiffs have no 
evidence showing that any person or entity attempted to enter the market to establish an anesthesia practice, but were unable to 
do so as a result of defendants' exclusionary behavior. "

211,7," Defendants argue that Beneficial Nat'l Bank v. Anderson demonstrates the Supreme Court's willingness to apply the complete 
preemption doctrine to new contexts. (Defs.' Joint Consolidated Opp'n to Mot. for Remand 24). In Beneficial, the Supreme Court 
held that the National Bank Act provided the exclusive cause of action for usury claims against national banks and therefore had 
the ""requisite pre-emptive force to provide removal jurisdiction."" Beneficial Nat'l Bank, 539 U.S. at 11. Unlike the National Bank 
Act, Congress did not demonstrate an express intention in the NGA, the NGPA, or the FPA to pre-empt the regulatory field of

218,16," In T&E Pastorino, the court notes that the context of the allegations in Mirant are identical to the claims in T&E Pastorino in 
that they both predicated their claims on violations of the ISO Tariff. See T&E Pastorino, 268 F. Supp. 2d at 1246 (""Thus, in the 
context of allegations identical to those included in Plaintiffs' complaint here, Judge Walker found that federal law created the

240,3," The plaintiffs asserted two other challenges to the application of Noerr-Pennington, neither of which requires extended 
discussion. Eon first contended that Noerr-Pennington immunity ""stems from an interpretation of the Sherman Act,"" and as such, 
does not apply to state law claims. Eon's Noerr-Pennington Opp'n at 4-6. As was largely true of the plaintiffs' Sherman Act 
claims, however, Eon's remaining state law claim was premised on SmithKline's initiation and prosecution of patent infringement 
lawsuits. Because Eon's state law claim thus implicated significant First Amendment and patent law concerns, the Court 
assumed, for purposes of this analysis, that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine applied with equal force to Eon's state law claim. See 
Globetrotter Software, Inc. v. Elan Computer Group, Inc., 362 F.3d 1367, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2004); cf. BE & K Constr. Co. v.

Noerr-Pennington is a ""First Amendment doctrine""). In addition, the end payor plaintiffs challenged the application of Noerr-Pennington to claims based on SmithKline's listing 
the'639 patent with the FDA. End Payor Pls.' Noerr-Pennington Opp'n at 25-26 (arguing that in listing the '639 patent, SmithKline 
did not ""petition"" the FDA, but rather, secured its merely ministerial action). While this challenge was not without force, see In re 
Buspirone Patent Litig., 185 F. Supp. 2d 363, 372-73 (S.D.N.Y. 2002), the Court considered SmithKline's initiation and 
prosecution of patent infringement lawsuits to be the more direct cause of the complained-of generic delay. See 21 U.S.C. § 
355(j)(5)(B)(iii) (providing that approval of an ANDA for a generic version of a patented drug ""shall be made effective 
immediately unless, before the expiration of 45 days . . . , an action is brought for infringement of the patent"")."

the district courts""). Citing an unpublished opinion raises a number of difficult questions. See Anastasoff v. United States, 223

243,7," The disputed issue of SmithKline's knowledge distinguished the present action from Professional Real Estate Investors. There, 
the defendant's knowledge was not material. The relevant ""predicate facts"" included only the defendant's copyright and the 
""unsettled condition of the law."" 508 U.S. at 63-64; see James B. Kobak, Jr., Professional Real Estate Investors and the Future 
of Patent-Antitrust Litigation, 63 Antitrust L.J. 185, 187 (1994) (explaining that the underlying action in Professional Real Estate 
Investors ""turned on a pure question of law""). The existence of probable cause would have been far less plain, however, if the 
plaintiffs had alleged, for example, that the defendant knew that its copyright was invalid. See Stewart, 98 U.S. at 194 
(recognizing that probable cause may present a factual question for the jury ""when the question of the defendants' belief of the 
facts relied upon to prove want of probable cause is involved""); cf. Wyatt v. Cole, 504 U.S. 158, 173-74, 118 L. Ed. 2d 504, 112

244,8," Although Federal Circuit law applies to ""antitrust claims premised on the bringing of a patent infringement suit,"" Nobelpharma,

247,10," In addition to their claims as assignees, the drugstore plaintiffs asserted claims as ""but for"" direct purchasers of generic 
nabumetone. See Drugstore Pls.' Illinois Brick Opp'n at 5. As conceded by the drugstore plaintiffs, these additional claims -- and "
248,," SmithKline's vigorous opposition to them -- were ""rendered largely moot"" by the Court's decision regarding the assigned claims. 
Id. at 4."
248,11," SmithKline suggested that the ""wholesalers themselves have acknowledged that their alleged damages will have to be 
reduced."" Defs.' Illinois Brick Mem. at 5 n.3. The acknowledgments cited, however, were those of experts retained by the direct 
purchaser class. See id., Exs. 3-4. As stated above, the national wholesalers opted out of this class and thus were in no way 
bound by the views of class experts. Moreover, at least one expert stated that he adjusted his damages estimate to be 
""consistent with the court's opinion In re Cardizem CD Antitrust Litigation, [200 F.R.D. 297, 317 (E.D. Mich. 2001)]."" Id., Ex. 3, at 
62-63. Respectfully, this Court did not consider Cardizem conclusive. "
251,1," The statute states, in relevant part: It is unlawful for a person, firm, or corporation holding . . . a beer distributor's license, a domestic brewer's license, a 
microbrewer's license, a beer importer's license, a beer distributor's license, a domestic winery license, a wine importer's license, 
or a wine distributor's license within the state of Washington to modify any prices without prior notification to and approval of the 
board. . . . "
252,," (2) Beer and wine distributor price posting. (a) Every beer or wine distributor shall file with the board at its office in Olympia a price posting showing the wholesale prices at 
which any and all brands of beer and wine sold by such beer and/or wine distributor shall be sold to retailers within the state. . . . (c) No beer and/or wine distributor may sell or offer to sell any package or container of beer or wine to any retail licensee at a 
price differing from the price for such package or container as shown in the price posting filed by the beer and/or wine distributor 
and then in effect, according to rules adopted by the board. (d) Quantity discounts are prohibited. No price may be posted that is below acquisition cost plus ten percent of acquisition cost. 
However, the board is empowered to review periodically, as it may deem appropriate, the amount of the percentage of 
acquisition cost as a minimum mark-up over cost and to modify such percentage by rule of the board, except such percentage 
shall be not less than ten percent. . . . (f) The board may reject any price posting that it deems to be in violation of this section or any rule, or portion thereof, or that 
would tend to disrupt the orderly sale and distribution of beer and wine. . . . (g) Prior to the effective date of the posted prices, all price postings filed as required by this section constitute investigative 
information and shall not be subject to disclosure . . . . (h) . . . (ii) Beer and wine sold as provided in this section shall be delivered by the distributor or an authorized employee either to 
the retailer's licensed premises or directly to the retailer at the distributor's licensed premises. A distributor's prices to retail 
licensees shall be the same at both such places of delivery. (3) Beer and wine suppliers' price filings, contracts, and memoranda. (a) Every brewery and winery offering beer and/or wine for sale within the state shall file with the board at its office in Olympia a 
copy of every written contract and a memorandum of every oral agreement which such brewery or winery may have with any 
beer or wine distributor, which contracts or memoranda shall contain a schedule of prices charged to distributors . . . . Whenever 
changed or modified, such revised contracts or memoranda shall forthwith be filed with the board as provided for by rule. The 
provisions of this section also apply to certificate of approval holders, beer and/or wine importers, and beer and/or wine 
distributors who sell to other beer and/or wine distributors. . . . (b) Prices filed by a brewery or winery shall be uniform prices to all distributors on a statewide basis less bona fide allowances 
for freight differentials. Quantity discounts are prohibited. No price shall be filed that is below acquisition/production cost plus ten 
percent of that cost . . . . . . . (d) No brewery or winery may sell or offer to sell any package or container of beer or wine to any distributor at a price differing 
from the price for such package or container as shown in the schedule of prices filed by the brewery or winery and then in effect, 
according to rules adopted by the board. (e) The board may reject any supplier's price filing, contract, or memorandum of oral agreement, or portion thereof that it deems 
to be in violation of this section or any rule or that would tend to disrupt the orderly sale and distribution of beer or wine. . . . (f) Prior to the effective date of the posted prices, all prices, contracts, and memoranda filed as required by this section constitute 
investigative information and shall not be subject to disclosure . . . . RCWA 66.28.180 (2004). "
256,2," When this case had been before the Ninth Circuit before at a different stage in its proceedings, the Ninth Circuit noted that 
even though the state could reject any posted price if it violated the state's rules, ""the effect of that rule is simply to effectuate the 
price posting and the prohibitions on quantity discounts and transportation allowances. It does not provide for government 
establishment or review of the prices themselves."" Miller v. Oregon Liquor Control Comm'n, 688 F.2d 1222, 1227 (9th Cir. 1982). "
257,3," Defendants maintain that the Court must give separate consideration to each of the challenged statutory and regulatory 
provisions and, pursuant to state law, sever any that are found unlawful. Costco disputes this, citing Continental Ore Co. v. 
Union Carbide & Carbon Co., 370 U.S. 690, 82 S. Ct. 1404, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1962), which held that ""the character and effect of a 
conspiracy are not to be judged by dismembering it and viewing its separate parts, but only by looking at it as a whole."" Id. at 
699 (quotation and citation omitted). Defendants reply that Continental Ore does not apply in this case because it involved 
private parties that allegedly engaged in an unlawful conspiracy in violation of the Sherman Act, whereas this case involves a 
state regulatory scheme. This argument is not persuasive. There is no reason why the same principle should not apply when the 
allegation is the state law amounts to a hybrid restraint on trade. In fact, the Supreme Court implicitly did just what Continental 
Ore required in Midcal and 324 Liquor Corp. - the Court looked at the state regulatory scheme as a whole to determine whether 
it amounted to a hybrid restraint on trade that was a per se violation of the Sherman Act."
257,4," In contrast, the court did discuss this aspect of the regulatory scheme in addressing whether it constituted a per se violation of 
the Sherman Act. TFWS, 242 F.3d at 209-10. However, whether the Washington regulatory scheme is a per se violation is a 
separate issue, discussed below. "
260,5," Contrary to Costco's suggestion otherwise, if the claim is dismissed, Costco cannot still assert it against the Wholesalers 
because the state is an indispensable party in determining the validity of its own statutes under its own constitution. "
265,1," Because we determine GFRS's conduct was not wrongful, we do not address whether Brooks had a contractual or economic 
relationship with a specific third party for purposes of his interference with an economic relationship claims."
265,2," The Supreme Court has referred to Business and Professions Code section 17200 et seq., as the ""unfair competition law,"" 
even though it has no official name. (Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. (1999) 20 Cal.4th

284,2," The expert report of John C. Beyer concerning statute of limitations issues stated: Before their merger, Northwest and Republic were, respectively, the eighth and ninth largest airlines in the United States. 
Both firms had substantial operations at the Minneapolis/ St. Paul airport (""MSP"") and were, by far, the largest airlines 
serving MSP. The firms competed with one another for passengers on the routes in which they overlapped. And, each firm 
constrained the ability of the other to charge supracompetitive prices on the routes in which they did not overlap because 
each could readily adjust their flight schedules and operations to take advantage of a profit opportunity on city-pair routes 
they were not serving at the time. App. 20."
284,3," At the time of the merger, the financial press reported that the merger would result in Northwest controlling 75-80% of the gates

airlines that started after deregulation as having competition limited by constraints in gaining access to gates""; requirement of 
subleasing gates to gain entry to Minneapolis was ""key factor"" in Southwest's decision not to serve Minneapolis); Ohanian 
Report, App. 153 (""A key barrier to entry in the airline market is access to gates.""). A General Accounting Office report from 1999

Airfares, Service Quality, and Barriers to Entry 17 (March 4, 1999). See also Minnesota Planning, supra, at 3 (""The U.S. General 
Accounting Office found in 1996 that long-term, exclusive-use gate leases seriously inhibit competition at Minneapolis-St. Paul.

287,22,"  Proponents of deregulation believed that airline markets were ""contestable,"" that is, new carriers could easily enter markets

include capacity ""dumping"" of low fare seats and flight frequencies, ""bracketing"" of flights, restrictive controls over gates at 
its fortress hub airports, targeted frequent flyer and travel agent incentive programs. These practices serve to make 
sustained competition much more difficult for low-fare carriers, especially new entrants who do not have the size or network 
operations of Northwest or the financial resources to withstand prolonged periods of such anticompetitive behavior. "
288,," Strong Report, App. 203 (footnote omitted). Strong's list of Northwest's techniques to drive new entrants out of the market 
included some actions that were directly dependent on controlling facilities at Minneapolis (""Restrictions on gates or facilities 
(e.g., counters, operations offices) that prevent a new entrant from being able to launch competing service"") and others that 
capitalize on Northwest's ability to offer more flights (""Scheduling departures in close proximity to the new entrant's flights, 
known as 'bracketing.'""). This technique was described in an article by Michael Levine: ""Add frequency where possible, to

337,3," The plaintiffs cited section 28-4503 of the District of Columbia Code rather than section 28-4502, section 445.773 of the 
Michigan Compiled Laws rather than section 445.772 and section 325D.52 of the Minnesota Statutes rather than section 
325D.51. "
338,4," The plaintiffs also cite Louisiana ex rel. Ieyoub v. Borden, Inc., 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1921, Civ. A. No. 94-3640, 1995 WL 
59548 (E.D. La. Feb. 10, 1995). That earlier federal trial court decision is obviously superseded by the Fifth Circuit's more recent 
decision in Free."
338,5," The plaintiffs cite Daniel R. Karon, ""Your Honor, Tear Down That Illinois Brick Wall!"" The National Movement Toward Indirect 
Purchaser Antitrust Standing and Consumer Justice, 30 Wm. Mitchell L. Rev. 1351, 1377-78 (2004), to support their claim that 
Louisiana permits indirect purchaser suits. Pls.' Opp'n at 3 n.4. This article contains no persuasive Louisiana authority to support 
the plaintiffs' position."
338,6," For example, the price discrimination provision is directed at price differentials between localities within the state, Miss. Code 
Ann. § 75-21-3(d), and venue lies ""in the county where the trust and combine was formed, or where it exists or is carried on . . . 
or in any county in which either of the defendants may have a domicile, or where an officer or agent of any defendant 
corporation may be found,"" id. § 75-21-21. "
339,7," The defendants point out correctly that the plaintiffs ""do not allege state-specific activities, nor do they allege that the conduct in 
furtherance of the purported conspiracy was directed at the commerce of any specific state."" Defs.' Mot. at 4. As I have already 
noted, such detail certainly would have been helpful, but its absence is not fatal in light of the reasonable inferences to be drawn 
from the Second Amended Complaint."
339,8," The plaintiffs confirm this reading in their legal memorandum, which describes the Second Amended Complaint as detailing a 
""scheme to force American consumers in all fifty states to pay artificially inflated prices for new automobiles."" Pls.' Opp'n at 1."
339,9," United Nuclear Corp. v. General Atomic Corp., 96 N.M. 155, 629 P.2d 231, 270 (N.M. 1980), does not support the defendants' 
contention that the reach of the New Mexico antitrust statute is limited to intrastate commerce. United Nuclear addressed the 
constitutionality of applying New Mexico's antitrust law to interstate commerce, and applied the standard established in Pike v. 
Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S. 137, 142, 25 L. Ed. 2d 174, 90 S. Ct. 844 (1970). United Nuclear, 629 P.2d at 270. According to 
this standard, HN11[
] state regulation is constitutional as long as the state has a ""legitimate local public interest"" in the 
regulation and the regulation is evenhanded and only incidentally affects interstate commerce. Id. at 270-72. The defendants 
have not argued that the application of New Mexico's antitrust act in this case would unconstitutionally infringe on interstate 
commerce. Moreover, New Mexico has a legitimate local interest in the regulation of motor vehicle sales in the state, and the 
defendants have not suggested that the state law affects interstate commerce more than incidentally or that it is discriminatory in 
its application. "
340,10," HN14[
] The Supreme Court of Tennessee has held that ""unpublished intermediate court opinions have persuasive force,"" 
and noted that, ""unfortunately, many of the best opinions of our intermediate appellate courts are unpublished."" Allstate Ins. Co. 
v. Watts, 811 S.W.2d 883, 886 n.2 (Tenn. 1991)."
340,11," In doing so, the Tennessee Court of Appeals cogently explained the significance of the early case of Standard Oil Co. v. State, 
117 Tenn. 618, 100 S.W. 705, 709 (1907), and its statements that Tennessee antitrust law, ""when properly construed, does not 
apply to interstate commerce"" and that ""the sole object and purpose of the enactment of it was to correct and prohibit abuses of 
trade within the state."" See Sherwood, 2003 Tenn. App. LEXIS 539, 2003 WL 21780975, at *9, *21. "
342,12," Moreover, HN24[
] unlike the federal antitrust laws, West Virginia antitrust statutes do not provide for injunctive relief. Thus, if 
indirect purchasers cannot sue for damages, they have no recourse, not even the injunctive recourse available to indirect 
purchasers under federal law. That is hardly a ""harmonization"" outcome."
342,13," West Virginia Code section 47-18-3 provides: HN26[
] ""every contract . . . or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce in 
this State shall be unlawful."""
342,14," I recognize that HN27[
] this unpublished decision has limited authority under the law of West Virginia. See State v. Myers,"
342,216," W. Va. 120, 602 S.E.2d 796, 802 n.10 (W. Va. 2004). Nevertheless, ""given the dearth of published opinions dealing with the 
issue before [me], [I] necessarily rely on [this] unpublished opinion []."" Id."
342,15," The plaintiffs make no consumer protection claim for Alabama, Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, 
South Carolina, Wisconsin and Wyoming."
342,16," The defendants state in a footnote that they ""are moving to dismiss . . . thirty-five of plaintiffs' forty consumer-protection 
claims."" Defs.' Mot. at 1 n.1. However, the text and exhibits to the defendants' motion to dismiss make arguments to dismiss only 
thirty-four of the plaintiffs' consumer protection claims. Defs.' Mot. at 7-17; id. Ex. A at 3."
342,17," The plaintiffs concede Illinois, Oregon, Texas and Washington. Pls.' Opp'n App. C at 2. "
343,18," I do not address whether the plaintiffs' indirect purchaser status bars their claims in the District of Columbia, Idaho, Maine, 
Montana, New Hampshire, Utah and Vermont (jurisdictions for which I have denied the motion to dismiss) because the 
defendants have not argued that these jurisdictions impose a direct purchaser requirement."
343,19," The defendants argue that Georgia, Kentucky, Montana, New York, Ohio and Utah consumer protection statutes prohibit class 
actions. Defs.' Mot. at 15 n.15. (In the context of the state antitrust claims, the defendants also contend that Mississippi prohibits 
class actions altogether. Id. at 4 n.2.) I find these arguments premature because I have not yet been asked to rule on whether a 
class can be certified."
343,20," Paragraph 112 of the Second Amended Complaint states in a conclusory fashion that ""as a direct result of Defendants' 
anticompetitive, deceptive, unfair, unconscionable, and fraudulent conduct, Plaintiffs and members of the Class were denied 
access to an alternative channel of distribution of new motor vehicles and forced to pay artificially high prices."" However, there is 
no description anywhere of the ""deception."" The defendants do not challenge the Second Amended Complaint for failure to state 
allegations of fraud with particularity as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)."
343,21," The plaintiffs do say that the defendants ""refused to honor . . . warranties, disseminate safety recall information, or install 
properly calibrated odometers in the United States"" for consumers who purchased vehicles in Canada. Pls.' Opp'n at 8; See also 
Second Am. Compl. PP 65-66. These allegations, however, do not involve deception."
343,22," The defendants correctly observe that HN28[
] ""if failure to disclose participation in a purported antitrust conspiracy were sufficient to state a consumer-protection claim, then any Section 1 antitrust case would automatically become a consumer-
protection case. That is not the law."" Defs.' Resp. to Pls.' Hr'g Submission at 5. "
344,23," HN33[
] Harmonization provisions appear in both consumer protection and antitrust statutes. A harmonization provision in a 
state antitrust statute might narrow potential recovery to direct purchasers, following the United States Supreme Court's 
interpretation of federal antitrust law in Illinois Brick. In contrast, a harmonization provision in a state consumer protection 
statute, which would harmonize the interpretation of the state statute with interpretations of the FTC Act, might allow for more 
expansive recovery to parallel the scope of the FTC Act's broad prohibitions on unfair methods of competition and unfair or 
deceptive acts. See 15 U.S.C. § 45(a)(1). "
345,24," HN39[
] I do not look to the Uniform Consumer Sales Practices Act for guidance in interpreting the ADTPA because, 
although both statutes prohibit enumerated deceptive and unconscionable practices, the language of the two statutes differs 
considerably. Compare Ark. Code Ann. § 4-88-107 with Unif. Consumer Sales Practices Act §§ 3-4."
345,25," Little Rock Electrical Contractors v. Entergy Corp., 79 Ark. App. 337, 87 S.W.3d 842 (Ark. Ct. App. 2002), cited by the 
defendants, does not support dismissal of the plaintiffs' ADTPA claim. That case involved a claim of deception, and the court did 
not comment on the types of behaviors that constitute ""unconscionable practices"" in violation of the ADTPA. Id. at 845-46."
345,26," FTC v. Mylan Laboratories, Inc., 62 F. Supp.2d 25, 44 (D.D.C. 1999) (""Mylan I""), cited by the defendants, does not support 
dismissal of these indirect purchaser claims. The court in Mylan I dismissed the Arkansas Attorney General's ADTPA claims 
brought on behalf of indirect purchasers for damages and restitution because the ADTPA did not expressly authorize such relief. 
Id. The court reconsidered that decision in FTC v. Mylan Laboratories, Inc., 99 F. Supp.2d 1, 5 (D.D.C. 1999) (""Mylan II""), and 
reinstated the Arkansas Attorney General's claim for restitution on behalf of indirect purchasers. The Mylan II court did hold that 
the ADTPA does not allow the Attorney General to recover damages on behalf of indirect purchasers, id., but it seems that the 
parties did not direct the court's attention to section 4-88-113(a)(2)(A) of the ADTPA, which permits the Attorney General to seek 
""other damages sustained"" by purchasers. In any event, unlike Mylan I and Mylan II, this case is brought by individual indirect purchasers, rather than state attorneys 
general. HN41[
] The ADTPA explicitly authorizes a private cause of action for damages. Section 4-88-113(f) provides: HN42[ ] ""Any person who suffers actual damage or injury as a result of an offense or violation as defined in this chapter has a cause of action to recover actual damages, if appropriate, and reasonable attorney's fees."" Ark. Code Ann. § 4-88-113(f). As noted 
above, the language of the ADTPA does not limit this cause of action to direct purchasers. See id. "
346,27," HN46[
] The Colorado Consumer Protection Act is not patterned directly on the FTC Act and does not contain a harmonization provision. According to Professor Pridgen, Colorado ""prohibits only certain itemized practices, without a catch-all' 
prohibition against unspecified unfair or deceptive practices."" Pridgen, Supra, § 3:5 & n.4."
346,28," I observe that HN47[
] both Hall, 969 P.2d at 234, and Rhino Linings, 62 P.3d at 148, state that one element of the five- element standard for bringing a private action under the CCPA is a showing ""that the defendant engaged in an unfair or 
deceptive trade practice."" (Emphasis added). Likewise, the court in U.S. West, Inc. v. Business Discount Plan, Inc., 196 F.R.D. 
576, 591 (D. Colo. 2000), noted that the CCPA prohibits ""'unfair trade practices' as defined in C.R.S. § 6-1-105."" Although the 
word ""unfair"" appears in these decisions, I have found no Colorado case where the court applied the term substantively to 
broaden the CCPA's reach to unfair, in addition to deceptive, practices. (Hall adopted the five-element test, including the ""unfair"" 
language, from the Supreme Court of Washington. See Hall, 969 P.2d at 234 (citing Hangman Ridge Training Stables, Inc. v. 
Safeco Title Ins. Co., 105 Wn.2d 778, 719 P.2d 531 (Wash. 1986)). The Supreme Court of Washington developed the standard 
based on Washington's consumer protection act, which, unlike the CCPA, broadly prohibits, in language closely tracking the 
FTC Act, ""unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices,"" Wash. Rev. Code § 19.86.020.) I also note 
that Colorado has a separate statute regulating unfair practices, Colo. Rev. Stat. §§ 6-2-101 to -117, labeled the ""Unfair 
Practices Act."" It is devoted to discriminatory and below-cost pricing and is not at issue here."
346,29," The plaintiffs also have not alleged that the withholding of information about the conspiracy ""was intended to induce the 
consumer to enter into a transaction,"" another requirement of subsection (u)."
346,30," The plaintiffs' reliance on U.S. West, 196 F.R.D. at 591, and May Department Stores Co. v. Colorado, 863 P.2d 967 (Colo. 
1993), in support of their Colorado consumer protection claim is misplaced because neither case addresses the issue whether a 
plaintiff must allege fraudulent or deceptive conduct to establish a CCPA claim. The issue addressed in U.S. West was whether 
the plaintiff had alleged an injury resulting from the defendant's alleged consumer protection violations. 196 F.R.D. at 591. In 
May, the Supreme Court of Colorado reviewed the civil penalties imposed by the lower courts in a case where the trial court had 
found that the defendant engaged in deceptive practices in violation of the CCPA. 863 P.2d at 971. "
347,31," Multiple recovery problems exist because the alleged conspiracy could have harmed the dealers by preventing them from 
buying and selling the less-expensive Canadian vehicles. See In re New Motor Vehicles, 307 F. Supp.2d at 140; Second Am. 
Compl. P 44. Even if the dealers participated in the conspiracy, as the plaintiffs allege, the dealers may sue the defendant 
automobile companies so long as the dealers are not parties to this lawsuit. See In re New Motor Vehicles, 307 F. Supp.2d at 
140. Discount distributors who would otherwise buy vehicles in Canada and sell them to United States consumers may also be 
able to recover. Id. at 142. Additionally, Canadian dealers may have a cause of action against the defendants because the 
conspiracy and its attendant restrictions on Canadian dealers may have restricted their customer base. Id."
347,32," HN51[
] The DCFA does not track the language of the FTC Act prohibiting unfair competition and unfair acts, nor does it contain a provision harmonizing the DCFA with the FTC Act. See Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, §§ 2511 to 2527. The plaintiffs have not 
specified whether they are bringing their Delaware consumer protection claim under Delaware's Consumer Fraud Act, Del. Code 
Ann. tit. 6, §§ 2511 to 2531, or Deceptive Trade Practices Act, Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, §§ 2532 to 2536. See Second Am. Compl. 
P 119 (citing only ""6 Del. Code § 2511, et seq.""). In any event, I note that the plaintiffs fail to state a claim under HN52[
] the Deceptive Trade Practices Act, which prohibits only enumerated deceptive trade practices, none of which encompasses the 
plaintiffs' allegations. "
348,33," The DCFA states that its purpose is ""to protect consumers . . . from unfair or deceptive merchandising practices in the conduct 
of any trade or commerce in part or wholly within this State."" Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, § 2512 (emphasis added). The Court of 
Chancery of Delaware has held that ""relief can be granted under the DCFA only as to those unlawful practices occurring or 
performed partly or wholly within Delaware."" Goodrich v. E.F. Hutton Group, Inc., 542 A.2d 1200, 1203 (Del. Ch. 1988). 
Apparently, the offending conduct itself (not merely the trade or commerce) must occur in Delaware."
348,34," The plaintiffs allege that CADA and NADA represent Canadian and United States new motor vehicle dealers, and that NADA 
acts as the ""eyes, ears, and voice of franchised car and truck dealers in the nation's capitol, developing positions that are 
presented as the collective view of dealers to Congress, courts, federal agencies and the public."" Second Am. Compl. PP 36-37 
(quotations omitted). The plaintiffs allege that CADA and NADA facilitated communication about the conspiracy, helped the 
manufacturers enforce the conspiracy and promoted the creation of a list of practices that Canadian dealers could use to stop 
export sales. Id. P 2. These allegations, if true, show only that CADA and NADA worked with the dealers in a representative 
capacity, not that they were connected to the ""supply side"" of the consumer transaction. "
349,35," HN57[
] The statute also directs that it ""shall be construed and applied liberally to promote its purpose."" D.C. Code Ann. §"
349,28," -3901(c). and states that one of its purposes is to ""assure that a just mechanism exists to remedy all improper trade practices 
and deter the continuing use of such practices,"" id. § 28-3901(b)(1)."
349,36," HN58[
] The United States District Court for the District of Columbia has applied the heightened pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) to allegations of deceptive trade practices under the DCCPPA. Witherspoon v. Philip Morris, 
Inc., 964 F. Supp. 455, 463-64 (D.D.C. 1997). Although the plaintiffs have not met this heightened pleading standard with regard 
to their argument that the failure to reveal the conspiracy constituted a deceptive practice, the defendants have not raised the 
issue. Moreover, given the DC. court's broad interpretations of the DCCPPA, I conclude that the alleged antitrust violation may 
violate the DCCPPA without being a deceptive practice, the criterion that triggers the Rule 9(b) pleading requirements. "
351,37," The plaintiffs did not include Kentucky in the state antitrust count of the Second Amended Complaint. But the exhibit 
introduced by the plaintiffs at oral argument argues that under Kentucky Laborers, 24 F. Supp.2d 755, the plaintiffs should be 
able to assert an antitrust violation under section 367.175. Pls.' Oral Argument Ex. The defendants did not address this 
argument in their response to the plaintiffs' hearing submission. See Defs.' Response to Pls.' Hr'g Submission (Docket Item 
154)."
351,38," HN68[
] Because the Kentucky Supreme Court has held that the application of section 446.070 is ""limited to where the statute is penal in nature, or where by its terms the statute does not prescribe the remedy for its violation,"" Grzyb v. Evans, 700 
S.W.2d 399, 401 (Ky. 1985), section 446.070 may be applied to violations of the antitrust provision (section 367.175), but not to 
violations of the consumer protection provision (section 367.170)."
351,39," See Arnold v. Microsoft Corp., 2001 Ky. App. LEXIS 1311, 2001 WL 1835377 at *7 (Ky. Ct. App. 2001) (indirect purchasers 
cannot bring suit for a violation of section 367.175 of the KCPA); In re Microsoft Corp. Antitrust Litig., 241 F. Supp.2d 563, 565 
(D. Md. 2003) HN71[
] (indirect purchasers cannot sue for antitrust violations under the KCPA) (citing Arnold, 2001 Ky. App. LEXIS 1311, 2001 WL 1835377). The Arnold decision is unpublished and thus has limited precedential value in Kentucky, See 
Ky. R. Civ. P. 76.28(4)(c), but it is the only Kentucky guidance available. (The defendants also cite Potter v. Bruce Walters Ford 
Sales, Inc., 37 S.W.3d 210, 213 (Ky. Ct. App. 2000), in support of a direct purchaser requirement under the KCPA. Defs.' Reply 
Ex. B, App. IIR, at 2. The court in Potter addressed the privity requirement under section 367.170, which I discussed above, but 
did not address indirect purchaser standing for a claim under section 367.175. 37 S.W.3d at 213.). "
352,40," The defendants contend that, according to Tungate v. MacLean-Stevens Studios, Inc., 1998 ME 162, 714 A.2d 792, 797 (Me. 
1998), ""in pricing cases under the Act the inquiry is whether the price has the effect of deceiving the consumer."" Defs.' Mot. App. 
I. A at 3. The issue in Tungate was whether an undisclosed commission was an unfair or deceptive act. Tungate, 714 A.2d at 
797. The relevant provision in this case is not the prohibition on ""unfair or deceptive acts,"" but rather the ban on ""unfair methods 
of competition,"" which was not implicated in Tungate. Tungate's standards for establishing deception are therefore not pertinent."
352,41," The defendants have not argued that they do not advertise, offer, sell or distribute services, the relevant statutory definition of 
""trade or commerce."" 5 M.R.S.A. § 206(3). "
353,42," HN81[
] The language of the MCPA does not follow the FTC Act. See Pridgen, supra, § 3:5. The MCPA forbids only unfair and deceptive acts, and does not include the FTC Act's prohibition on ""unfair methods of competition."" Compare Md. Code 
Ann., Com. Law II, § 13-301 with 15 U.S.C. § 45(a)."
353,43," The plaintiffs' reliance on Towne v. North End Isuzu, Inc., 1999 Mass. Super. LEXIS 302, No. 982708B, 1999 WL 674140 
(Mass. Super. June 21, 1999) (""Towne II"") (cited in Pls.' Opp'n at 12-13), to support this contention is inapposite. The court in 
Towne II noted that in Towne v. North End Isuzu, Inc., No. 98-0895A (Worcester Sup. Ct.) (""Towne I""), the Worcester Superior 
Court denied the plaintiffs' request to amend the complaint after the plaintiffs sent the required demand letter, so the plaintiffs 
filed a new action including thechapter 93A claim. 1999 Mass. Super. LEXIS 302, [WL] at *1. The court in Towne II held that 
although the ruling of Towne I precluded the plaintiffs from amending their complaint, the plaintiffs could file a separate chapter 
93A complaint after sending the required letter. 1999 Mass. Super. LEXIS 302, [WL] at *2. This case is also unlike Latino v. Ford 
Motor Co., 403 Mass. 247, 526 N.E.2d 1282, 1284 (Mass. 1988), where the court held that Massachusetts General Laws 
chapter 90, section 7N 1/2 (""section 7N 1/2"") allowed a state-certified arbitration award to serve the purpose of the written 
demand required under chapter 93A. A violation of section 7N 1/2 also violates chapter 93A, and section 7N1/2 expressly "
354,," provides that ""for the purposes of [chapter 93A], the timely delivery by a manufacturer of a refund or acceptable replacement, 
pursuant to a finding by state-certified arbitration, shall constitute the granting of relief upon demand."" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 90, § 
7N1/2 (7) . The court in Latino interpreted this provision to permit the arbitration award to serve as the ""statutorily designated 
equivalent of a [chapter] 93A demand letter"" when the manufacturer did not provide the required relief. 526 N.E.2d at 1284. The 
plaintiffs have not cited and I am not aware of any such statutory provision authorizing the use of a previous complaint to fulfill 
the chapter 93A demand requirement."
354,44," The only itemized violation that possibly relates to the plaintiffs' allegations is the HN86[
] prohibition on ""charging the consumer a price that is grossly in excess of the price at which similar property or services are sold."" Mich. Comp. Laws § 
445.903(1)(z). The plaintiffs, however, have not argued that the defendants' alleged practices violate this provision. Even if the 
plaintiffs had made this argument, the applicability of this provision is questionable given that it was the dealers, and not the 
defendant automobile companies, who charged the plaintiffs allegedly inflated prices for motor vehicles."
354,45," It is unclear which Minnesota statute provides the basis for the plaintiffs' Minnesota consumer protection claim. In paragraph 
129 of their Second Amended Complaint, the plaintiffs cite ""Minn. Stat. § 8.31, et seq."" Section 8.31 HN89[
] delineates the 
rights and duties of the attorney general and provides a private right of action for a violation of various statutes including the 
unfair discrimination and competition statute, Minn. Stat. §§ 325D.01-.07; the Unlawful Trade Practices Act, Minn. Stat. §§ 
325D.09-.16; the antitrust statute, Minn. Stat. §§ 325D.49-.66; and the Prevention of Consumer Fraud Act, Minn. Stat. §§ 
325F.68-.70. The plaintiffs have brought a separate claim for relief for a violation of the Minnesota antitrust statute, Second Am. 
Compl. P 99. The Minnesota unfair discrimination and competition statute and the Unlawful Trade Practices Act do not apply to 
the plaintiffs' allegations. See Minn. Stat. §§ 325D.01-.07 (forbidding price discrimination between different areas of the state, 
selling below cost, or considering bankrupt sales in fixing costs); Minn. Stat. §§ 325D.09-16 (prohibiting misrepresentation of the "
355,," nature of a business or its merchandise and the sale of merchandise other than that handled in the regular course of business). I 
will thus address the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act, Minn. Stat. §§ 325D.43-.48, and the Prevention of Consumer 
Fraud Act, Minn. Stat. §§ 325F.68-.70, the Minnesota consumer protection statutes that appear relevant to the plaintiffs' 
allegations."
355,46," The plaintiffs cite Robinson v. EMI Music Distribution, Inc., CIV. A. No. L-10462, 1996 WL 495551 (Tenn. Cir. July 8, 1996), 
and State v. Philip Morris Inc., 551 N.W.2d 490 (Minn. 1996), to support their Minnesota consumer protection claims. The court 
in Robinson certified a class under statutes including Minnesota's Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act, Minn. Laws § 
325D.44.  1996 WL 495551, at *2. Robinson did not address the issue whether a conspiracy or omission such as the plaintiffs 
allege in this case would constitute a deceptive practice under Minnesota consumer protection law. See id.  Philip Morris is 
inapposite, because the plaintiffs' claims there that the defendants ""illegally conspired to suppress research on the deleterious 
effects of smoking and to manipulate nicotine levels in cigarettes in order to induce nicotine addiction in smokers"" did involve 
allegations of fraudulent or deceptive conduct. See 551 N.W.2d at 492."
355,47," Section 407.145 HN93[
] authorizes the attorney general ""to promulgate . . . all rules necessary to the administration and enforcement of the provisions of this chapter."" Mo. Rev. Stat. § 407.145. "
356,48," The defendants contend that a plaintiff must allege fraud or deception to recover under the MMPA, citing Willard v. Bic Corp., 
788 F. Supp. 1059, 1071 (W.D. Mo. 1991), and Kiechle v. Drago, 694 S.W.2d 292, 293-94 (Mo. Ct. App. 1985) (both cited in 
Defs.' Mot. App. I.A, at 4). Willard involved an allegation that the defendant ""concealed, suppressed, or omitted material facts 
regarding the dangerous and/or defective character of its lighters. . . ."" 788 F. Supp. at 1070. The court noted that a common fact 
pattern of cases brought under the MMPA involves deceptive representations or omissions but did not address whether fraud or 
deception is required under the ""unfair practices"" provision of the MMPA. See id. at 1071-71. The plaintiff in Kiechle sued the 
defendant for fraud and for damages under the MMPA, and the court held that the evidence showed breach of contract but not, 
as the plaintiff contended, any false promise or deception. 694 S.W.2d at 293-94. Kiechle HN94[
] does not require a plaintiff 
to allege fraudulent or deceptive activity to state an MMPA claim. The court also stated that it is up to the court deciding an 
MMPA claim ""in each particular instance to declare whether fair dealing has been violated."" Id. at 293."
356,49," In Ports Petroleum Co. v. Nixon, the Supreme Court of Missouri limited the reach of the attorney general's broad definition of 
""unfair practice."" 37 S.W.3d 237, 241 (Mo. 2001) (en banc). The court held that a sale of motor fuel below cost, a violation of the 
Missouri Motor Fuel Marketing Act (""MFMA""), Mo. Rev. Stat. §§ 416.600-.640, was not an unfair practice under the MMPA. Id. 
The court distinguished the purpose of the MMPA, to protect consumers ""who are the actual buyers in a sale,"" from the MFMA's 
purpose of protecting competition. It concluded that the MMPA did not apply because, although the sale of motor fuel below cost 
ultimately harmed competition, the buyer actually benefited from the lower price at the point of sale. Id. This case is 
distinguishable from Ports Petroleum because the alleged conspiracy did harm the plaintiffs, actual buyers, at the point of sale 
by maintaining high prices for motor vehicles. The alleged conspiracy could thus constitute an unfair practice in violation of the 
MMPA because it not only purportedly hindered competition but also immediately harmed the actual buyer. Contra Robert H. 
Dierker & Richard J. Mehan, 34 Missouri Practice Series: Personal Injury and Torts Handbook, § 29.2(2)(d) (2004) (""Ports 
Petroleum seems to stand for the proposition that an unfair practice under the Merchandising Practices Act must actually 
mislead a consumer to his or her detriment, to be actionable."")."

357,51," Contrary to the defendants' contention, Defs.' Mot. App. I.A, at 5, I do not read Matthews v. Berryman, 196 Mont. 49, 637 P.2d 
822 (Mont. 1981), as requiring allegations of fraud, duress or undue influence for the Montana consumer protection statute to 
apply. Unlike this case, the plaintiffs in Matthews did not allege unfair methods of competition, but rather alleged and failed to 
prove fraud, duress, coercion and undue influence. See Matthews, 637 P.2d at 823-25. The claims in Matthews thus only 
involved fraud or deception, and the court did not need to address the reach of the statutory prohibitions on unfair practices and 
unfair methods of competition. See id. at 826."
357,52," The defendants concede that HN101[
] ""the FTC Act explicitly applies to antitrust violations."" Defs.' Reply at 3."
357,53," HN102[
] Montana courts, unlike courts in Maryland, discussed Supra, and Oklahoma, discussed infra, have not held that an antitrust violation cannot also violate the consumer protection statute. "
358,54," HN108[
] The Supreme Court of New Jersey has stated that the NJCFA's ""remedial purpose [is], namely, to root out 
consumer fraud."" Lemelledo v. Beneficial Mgmt. Corp. of Am., 150 N.J. 255, 696 A.2d 546, 551 (N.J. 1997). I do not read this 
statement as limiting the applicability of the NJCFA solely to cases involving consumer fraud. This conclusion is bolstered by the 
Supreme Court of New Jersey's statement that ""the [NJCFA] should be construed liberally in favor of consumers."" See Cox v. 
Sears Roebuck & Co., 138 N.J. 2, 647 A.2d 454, 461 (N.J. 1994)."
358,55," Although I do not reach the issue, I note that the Law Division of the New Jersey Superior Court, in  Kieffer v. Mylan 
Laboratories, No. BER-L-365-99-EM, 1999-2 Trade Cas. (CCH) P 72,673 (N.J. Super. Ct. Law Sept. 9, 1999), stated that "
359,," allegations must involve ""inherently misleading or fraudulent conduct"" to state a claim under the NJCFA, and thus held that the 
NJCFA did not encompass allegations of anticompetitive conduct. See id."
359,56," Rule 1:36-3 of the New Jersey Rules of Court HN111[
] prevents me from relying on the unpublished New Jersey opinions 
cited by both sides. See N.J. Rules of Court 1:36-3 (stating that HN112[
] ""no unpublished opinion shall constitute precedent or 
be binding upon any court"" and that ""no unpublished opinion shall be cited by any court""). For what it is worth, my conclusion is 
consistent with the reasoning of the Law Division of the New Jersey Superior Court in Island Mortgages of New Jersey v. 3M, 
373 N.J. Super. 172, 860 A.2d 1013, 2004 WL 2332135, at *4 (N.J. Super Ct. Law Div. June 30, 2004); Wilson v. General 
Motors Corp., No. L-1287-03, at 2 (Defs.' Mot. Ex. F) (N.J. Super Ct. Law Div. Oct. 3, 2003), a parallel New Jersey case 
involving the same facts alleged by the plaintiffs in this lawsuit; and  Kieffer v. Mylan Laboratories, Inc., 1992 Trade Cas. (CCH) 
P 72,673. In these cases, cited by the defendants, New Jersey courts held that indirect purchaser plaintiffs could not undermine 
the Antitrust Act's ban on indirect purchaser suits by bringing their claims for alleged antitrust violations under the NJCFA. See 
id. The plaintiffs cite one case to the contrary, Cement Masons Local Union No. 699 Health & Welfare Fund v. Mylan 
Laboratories, Inc., Docket No. MER-L-000431-99 (N.J. Super. Ct. Law Div. April 18, 2000) (Pls.' Opp'n Palmer Decl. Ex. E), 
which allowed indirect purchasers to recover under the NJCFA for their claims of alleged antitrust violations."
359,57," For a definition of unconscionable, the defendants cite Guthmann v. La Vida LLena, 709 P.2d 675, 680 (N.M. 1985). Defs.' 
Mot. App. I.B at 12. Guthman, however, did not involve an NMUPA claim. (It addressed procedural and substantive 
unconscionability in contract terms. 709 P.2d at 679-80.) I rely on the NMUPA's definition of ""unconscionable."" N.M. Stat. Ann. § 
57-12-2(E). "
360,58," The defendants cite Thompson v. Youart, 109 N.M. 572, 787 P.2d 1255, 1259 (N.M. Ct. App. 1990), to support their 
contention that a plaintiff must allege a deceptive misrepresentation to state a claim under the NMUPA. Defs.' Mot. App. I.B., at 
12. Thompson, however, describes (as the defendants themselves note in their explanatory parenthetical for the case) the 
standard for a claim of unfair or deceptive practices and not unconscionable trade practices. 787 P.2d at 1259. The standard 
announced in Thompson and cited by the defendants is actually a restatement of the statutory definition of ""unfair or deceptive 
trade practice"" in N.M. Stat. Ann. § 57-12-2(D)."
360,59," The defendants claim that ""it is well established that indirect purchasers in New Mexico do not have standing to assert claims 
under any New Mexico statute unless specifically authorized by the statute."" Defs.' Mot. at 11 n.10. The cases the defendants 
cite to support this contention, Marchman v. NCNB Texas National Bank, 120 N.M. 74, 898 P.2d 709, 715-19 (N.M. 1995), and 
Delta Automatic Systems, Inc. v. Bingham, 1999 NMCA 29, 126 N.M. 717, 974 P.2d 1174, 1177 (N.M. Ct. App. 1999) (both cited 
in Defs.' Mot. App. II, at 19), hold only that corporate shareholders and other indirectly injured parties may not assert a cause of 
action on behalf of the directly injured corporation unless the shareholder or other indirectly injured party has suffered a separate 
injury or is owed a special duty by the wrongdoer. I do not read these shareholder cases as limiting the right of indirect 
purchasers to bring an NMUPA claim in other contexts. "
361,60," The plaintiffs cite a number of cases where courts have held that an alleged antitrust violation is also a violation of section 349. 
Pls.' Opp'n at 7 & n.14; Pls.' Oral Argument Ex. In all these cases, the courts determined that the antitrust violations involved, or 
the plaintiffs separately alleged, deceptive acts or practices prohibited by section 349. See Excellus Health Plan, Inc. v. Tran, 
287 F. Supp.2d 167, 179-180 (W.D.N.Y. 2003) (noting that the allegations of a group boycott and other antitrust violations 
included claims of misleading statements made with an intent to deceive); New York v. Feldman, 210 F. Supp.2d 294, 302 
(S.D.N.Y. 2002) (finding that allegations that defendants colluded to rig auction bids constituted a deceptive practice under 
section 349); Cox v. Microsoft Corp., 8 A.D.3d 39, 778 N.Y.S.2d 147, 148 (App. Div. 2004) (holding that plaintiffs had sufficiently 
alleged ""purposeful, deceptive monopolistic business practices"" to survive a motion to dismiss their section 349 claim)."
361,61," The plaintiffs cite the Tennessee Circuit Court case of  Robinson v. EMI Music Distribution, Inc., 1996 WL 495551, to support 
their consumer protection claims in North Dakota and other states. The court in Robinson addressed a motion for class 
certification, based on a claim of price-fixing, under a variety of state statutes, including the North Dakota consumer protection 
statute. Id. The court in Robinson certified the class but did not reach the merits of the plaintiffs' claims, and thus did not consider 
whether the North Dakota statute requires allegations of fraud or deception. "
362,62," Claiming that the OCSPA is one of a number of state consumer protection statutes ""substantially modeled"" on the FTC Act, 
the plaintiffs urge me to follow the FTC's definition of ""unfair acts"" in interpreting the OCSPA. Pls.' Opp'n at 7. Section 
1345.02(A) of the OCSPA HN124[
] is similar to the FTC Act in that it forbids unfair or deceptive acts or practices, but the OCSPA notably does not contain the FTC Act's prohibition on ""unfair methods of competition."" Compare Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 
1345.02(A) with 15 U.S.C. § 45(a)(1). The OCSPA does contain a harmonization provision, which provides: ""In construing 
division (A) of this section, the court shall give due consideration and great weight to federal trade commission orders, trade 
regulation rules and guides, and the federal courts' interpretations of subsection45(a)(1) of the [FTC Act]. . . ."" Ohio Rev. Code 
Ann. § 1345.02(C). Nevertheless, I follow the Ohio courts' definition of ""unfair or deceptive act or practice"" rather than the FTC 
Act's definition of ""unfair acts."""
362,63," Section 1345.03(B) of the OCSPA provides: HN126[
] In determining whether an act or practice is unconscionable, the following circumstances shall be taken into 
consideration: (1) Whether the supplier has knowingly taken advantage of the inability of the consumer reasonably to protect his interests 
because of his physical or mental infirmities, ignorance, illiteracy, or inability to understand the language of an agreement; (2) Whether the supplier knew at the time the consumer transaction was entered into that the price was substantially in 
excess of the price at which similar property or services were readily obtainable in similar consumer transactions by like 
consumers; (3) Whether the supplier knew at the time the consumer transaction was entered into of the inability of the consumer to 
receive a substantial benefit from the subject of the consumer transaction; (4) Whether the supplier knew at the time the consumer transaction was entered into that there was no reasonable 
probability of payment in full of the obligation by the consumer; (5) Whether the supplier required the consumer to enter into a consumer transaction on terms the supplier knew were 
substantially one-sided in favor of the supplier; (6) Whether the supplier knowingly made a misleading statement of opinion on which the consumer was likely to rely to his 
detriment; (7) Whether the supplier has, without justification, refused to make a refund in cash or by check for a returned item that was 
purchased with cash or by check, unless the supplier had conspicuously posted in the establishment at the time of the sale 
a sign stating the supplier's refund policy. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 1345.03(B). "
363,64," FTC v. Mylan Laboratories, Inc., 99 F. Supp.2d 1 (D.D.C. 1999) (cited in Pls.' Opp'n at 10), does not help the plaintiffs. In that 
case, Judge Hogan reinstated the Oklahoma Attorney General's claim for restitution on behalf of indirect purchasers under 
section 756.1(C)(2) of the OCPA. Id. at 8. HN130[
] Private plaintiffs like those in this lawsuit must seek recovery under section"
363,761," .1 of the OCPA. I find the reasoning of Major, 2002 OK CIV APP 120, 60 P.3d 511, discussed above, persuasive in 
anticipating what the Supreme Court of Oklahoma will do when called upon to rule on whether indirect purchasers may sue for 
antitrust violations under the OCPA. "
364,65," Pirozzi v. Penske Olds-Cadillac-GMC, Inc., 413 Pa. Super. 308, 605 A.2d 373 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1992) (cited in Pls.' Oral 
Argument Ex.), does not save the plaintiffs' Pennsylvania consumer protection claim. The allegations in Pirozzi, that the 
defendant automobile dealership failed to reveal that a vehicle had been damaged and repaired before sale, involved allegations 
of fraudulent conduct, unlike the allegations in this case. See id. at 377."
364,66," HN135[
] The motor vehicle regulation statute applies to ""any person who engages directly in purposeful contacts within this 
state in connection with the offering or advertising for sale of, or has business dealings with respect to, a motor vehicle within the 
state."" R.I. Gen. Laws § 31-5.1-2. The statute thus applies to all the defendants, including the dealer associations, because all 
the defendants allegedly conspired to keep Canadian motor vehicles out of the United States (presumably including Rhode 
Island) and maintain artificially high prices for motor vehicles sold throughout the United States (including motor vehicles within 
Rhode Island). Second Am. Compl. PP 1-2, 39. "
365,67," The relevant provision of Rhode Island General Laws section 8-2-14(a) gives the superior court ""concurrent original jurisdiction 
with the district court in all other actions at law in which the amount in controversy exceeds the sum of five thousand dollars ($ 
5,000) and does not exceed ten thousand dollars ($ 10,000)."" "
366,68," HN141[
] The TCPA is similar to the FTC Act in that it prohibits unfair or deceptive acts; however, the TCPA, unlike the FTC Act, does not prohibit unfair methods of competition. Compare Tenn. Code Ann. § 47-18-104(a) with 15 U.S.C. § 45(a)(1)."
366,69," HN142[
] In determining whether a practice is ""unfair"" under the FTC Act, the Federal Trade Commission considers ""(1) 
whether the practice . . . offends public policy as it has been established by statutes, the common law, or otherwise . . . (2) 
whether it is immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous; (3) whether it causes substantial injury to consumers."" FTC v. 
Sperry & Hutchinson Co., 405 U.S. 233, 244 n.5 (1972). Given that the conduct at issue is an alleged antitrust violation, the 
applicability of this definition is questionable because the Federal Trade Commission only considers these factors ""in 
determining whether a practice that is neither in violation of the antitrust laws nor deceptive is nonetheless unfair."" Id. (emphasis 
added)."
366,70," Moreover, HN143[
] there is authority for the assertion that the TCPA does not apply to anticompetitive behavior. See Sherwood v. Microsoft Corp., 2003 Tenn. App. LEXIS 539, No. M2000-01850-COA-R9-CV, 2003 WL 21780975, at *31-*33 
(Tenn. Ct. App. July 31, 2003) (concluding, based on the failure of the Tennessee General Assembly to include a prohibition on 
unfair competition in the TCPA, ""that claims based upon anticompetitive conduct are not cognizable under the TCPA""). "
367,71," Section 2453(a) of the VCFA HN151[
] also prohibits ""unfair methods of competition in commerce,"" and in paragraph 107 in 
Count III of the Second Amended Complaint the plaintiffs have pleaded the Vermont antitrust violation under this section. Since 
2000, section 2465 of the VCFA has authorized suit by ""any person who sustains damages or injury as a result of any violation 
of state antitrust laws, including section 2453 of this title."" The defendants have not moved to dismiss the plaintiffs' Vermont 
antitrust claims. Consequently, I address here only the viability of the plaintiffs' claims under the ""unfair or deceptive acts or 
practices"" prong of section 2453(a). "
368,72," Elkins was an antitrust case, but at the time of the objected-to conduct, in February 1999, 817 A.2d at 10, there was no 
remedy for an antitrust violation except the ambiguous language of section 2461. Thus, HN153[
] by allowing an antitrust remedy under section 2461, the court permitted a plaintiff to proceed in the absence of fraud. (Thereafter, section 2465 was 
added, providing a specific private right of action for a violation of state antitrust laws.)"
368,73," Likewise, in Russell v. Atkins, the Supreme Court of Vermont permitted a claim for anticompetitive behavior under the VCFA to 
survive a motion for summary judgment on facts that did not include allegations of fraud. 165 Vt. 176, 679 A.2d 333, 336-37 (Vt. 
1996). Like Elkins, the events giving rise to the claim in Russell occurred before section 2465 was enacted."
368,74," Blanchette v. Toll Bros., Inc., 1999 Va. Cir. LEXIS 102, No. 176526, 1999 WL 370585, at *2 (Va. Cir. Ct. Apr. 6, 1999) (cited in 
Pls.' Oral Argument Ex.), does not help the plaintiffs. The issue in Blanchette was whether the plaintiffs' Virginia consumer 
protection claim was regulated by the Federal Consumer Credit Protection Act and thus excluded from the VCPA. Id. Blanchette 
did not address whether the VCPA requires allegations of fraud or misrepresentation. See id. "

369,76," I doubt that a constructive trust is the appropriate remedy. As the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit stated 
in Williams Electronics Games, Inc. v. Garrity: HN159[
] When restitution is sought in a law case and the plaintiff is not seeking to impress a lien on particular property, 
but just wants an award of profits, he cannot obtain a constructive trust, because there is no res (that is, no fund or other 
specific piece of property) for the trust to attach to. He can still get restitution in such a case, but as a legal remedy for a 
legal wrong, not as an equitable remedy for a legal or an equitable wrong."

369,77," Professor Rendleman states: HN161[
] Restitution is divided into two branches. First is restitution for breach, which occurs after the defendant 
breaches a non-restitution substantive standard by, for example, committing a tort or breaching a contract. Here the plaintiff 
may choose restitution as an alternative to compensatory damages. Second is freestanding restitution, which the court 
bases on the defendant's unjust enrichment without finding any other violation of substantive law. Doug Rendleman, When is Enrichment Unjust? Restitution Visits an Onyx Bathroom, 36 Loy. L.A. L. Rev. 991, 993 (2003). 
Professor Gergen identifies three categories: unjust enrichment, restitution for wrongs and policy-based restitution. Mark P. 
Gergen, What Renders Enrichment Unjust?, 79 Tex. L. Rev. 1927, 1929 (2001). Professor Laycock also identifies three 
categories: unjust enrichment, disgorgement of the defendant's gains and specific restitution. Douglas Laycock, The Scope and 
Significance of Restitution, 67 Tex. L. Rev. 1277, 1284 (1989) "

370,81," Using restitution in this way apparently is a growing phenomenon. The plaintiffs cite eight other cases where a similar strategy 
has been pursued for indirect purchaser claims against the pharmaceutical industry. Pls.' Opp'n at 1 n.1."
370,82," The plaintiffs say that their restitution claim flows from the defendants' ""unlawful acts."" Second Am. Compl. P 155; See also id.

(stating that ""Plaintiffs here allege that, as a result of Defendants' unlawful conspiracy . . . [Plaintiffs] conferred a benefit . . . that 
it would be unjust under the circumstances for Defendants to retain""); id. at 18 (stating the same basis for the unjust enrichment 
claims)."
370,83," Generally, the plaintiffs do not differentiate between the two bases for restitution. Among the statements supporting the 
conclusion that they advance the autonomous claim as well are the following: ""Plaintiffs here . . . pursue an independent, long 
recognized, available claim for unjust enrichment,"" Pls.' Opp'n at 20 n.34; ""plaintiffs need not show . . . even that Defendants' 
conduct was illegal under the laws of any state,"" id. at 16."
370,84," For states that do permit indirect purchasers to make antitrust claims, the defendants also argue that the ""plaintiffs have no 
need of an unjust enrichment claim because they have an adequate legal remedy,"" and that ""courts do not impose equitable 
remedies where plaintiffs have an adequate remedy at law."" Defs.' Mot. at 25. This argument is not pertinent to the statutory 
interpretation undertaking. Indeed, HN162[
] several state antitrust statutes explicitly permit equitable relief. See, e.g., Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 44-1408(B) (""A person threatened with injury or injured in his business or property by a violation of this article may 
bring an action for appropriate injunctive or other equitable relief. . . .""); D.C. Code Ann. § 28-4508 (""Any person who is injured in 
that person's business or property by reason of anything forbidden by this chapter may bring a civil action for damages, for 
appropriate injunctive or other equitable relief, or for both.""); S.D. Codified Laws § 37-1-14.3 (""A person injured in his business or 
property by a violation of this chapter may bring an action for appropriate injunctive or other equitable relief. . . .""). To the extent "
371,," that I am dealing with a court-created remedy, I observe that the United States Supreme Court has recognized that HN163[
] 
restitution is often a legal, rather than an equitable, remedy: ""The kind of restitution that petitioners seek . . . is not equitable -- 
the imposition of a constructive trust or equitable lien on particular property -- but legal -- the imposition of personal liability for 
the benefits they conferred upon respondents."" Great-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson, 534 U.S. at 214. To be sure, the 
plaintiffs here have requested a constructive trust, but that probably is not the kind of remedy to which they will ultimately be 
entitled if they prevail."
371,85," See Rendleman, Supra, at 993."
371,86," Because the plaintiffs do not elaborate upon the basis for a freestanding claim, I must deduce what their argument would be."
371,87," See Rendleman, Supra, at 1002-03 (suggesting ""that HN166[

of Appeals of Tennessee allowed a restitution claim based on antitrust violations to proceed even though the plaintiff could not 
recover under the Tennessee antitrust statute. The plaintiff was an indirect purchaser in New York and one of the defendants 
conducted its business in Tennessee. The court ruled that the Tennessee antitrust statute, because of its geographic limit, would "
373,," not permit the New York plaintiff to recover under the statute. See 2004 Tenn. App. LEXIS 321, [WL] at *1, *7-*8, *10. In 
permitting the Tennessee unjust enrichment claim nevertheless to proceed, the court did not address the inconsistency in 
prohibiting direct recovery under the Tennessee statute (because of its geographic limit), while potentially allowing restitutionary 
recovery to the same plaintiff in the same location for the same Tennessee statutory violation. See 2004 Tenn. App. LEXIS 321, 
[WL] at *9-*10. (The court ruled that factual issues would determine whether New York or Tennessee law applied to the unjust 
enrichment claim. See 2004 Tenn. App. LEXIS 321, [WL] at *10.)"
373,92," See Porter v. Warner Holding Co., 328 U.S. 395, 398, 90 L. Ed. 1332, 66 S. Ct. 1086 (1946) (stating that HN176[

statute confers equity power, a court can order restitution unless the statute contains clear language to the contrary); In re 
Terazosin, 160 F. Supp.2d at 1380 HN177[
] (allowing unjust enrichment claims in jurisdictions that allow statutory indirect 
purchaser claims, but not in jurisdictions that disallow statutory indirect purchaser claims). In fact, some state antitrust statutes 
explicitly permit restitutionary relief as a measure of recovery. See, e.g., N.C. Gen. Stat. § 75-15.1 (allowing the court, in a suit 
instituted by the Attorney General, to ""order the restoration of any moneys or property . . . obtained by any defendant as a result 
of such violation"")."
373,93," See, e.g., Williams Elecs. Games, Inc. v. Garrity, 366 F.3d at 576 (Restitution is available in any intentional-tort case in which 
the tortfeasor has made a profit that exceeds the victim's damages (if the damages exceed the profit, the plaintiff will prefer to 
seek damages instead). . . .""); Laycock, Supra, at 1286 HN178[
] (""For substantive claims not dependent on the law of 
restitution -- such as those based in ordinary torts and breaches of contract -- plaintiff generally has an election. Plaintiff can 
always claim his own damages; alternatively, he can usually claim defendant's gain."")."
373,94," See, e.g., Daniel Friedmann, Restitution for Wrongs: The Measure of Recovery, 79 Tex. L. Rev. 1879, 1880 (2001) (noting 
that HN179[
] the plaintiff's loss and the defendant's gain ""ordinarily represent two sides of the same coin"")."
373,95," On the other hand, if any class that is ultimately certified is narrow, the plaintiff class may see disgorgement of all the ill-gotten 
gains as potentially more generous than damages."
373,96," See State ex rel. Kidwell v. Master Distribs., Inc., 101 Idaho 447, 615 P.2d 116, 124 (Idaho 1980) HN180[

provide for restitution or that have been interpreted by state courts as providing such relief; States with [antitrust] statutes that 
provide for equitable relief and courts that have held the concept of equitable relief to include restitution; and States with 
[antitrust] statutes that provide, without explicit limitation, for any other equitable relief the court may order, have authority to 
seek restitution and disgorgement. . . .""). (The plaintiffs in Mylan I were state attorneys general, not private plaintiffs. Id. at 32.) 
HN181[
] To the extent that Mylan I allows restitutionary recovery for indirect purchasers in states where antitrust and consumer protection statutes prohibit damages for indirect purchasers, I do not follow it. See id. at 46, 49, 56 app. A (dismissing 
damages claims but not restitution claims brought on behalf of indirect purchasers in Idaho and Missouri); See also FTC v. 
Mylan Lab., Inc., 99 F. Supp.2d 1, 11 app. A (D.D.C. 1999) (""Mylan II"") (evaluating motion to reconsider Mylan I and retaining

Chrysler Plymouth, Inc., 82 Wn.2d 265, 510 P.2d 233, 241 (Wash. 1973) (reaching the same conclusion regarding Washington's 
consumer protection statute)."
374,99," Statutory interpretation will determine whether the residents of State X can recover statutory remedies from defendants who 
violate the statutory laws of State Y. Generally, I expect that such recovery is unlikely, See, e.g., Freeman Indus., 2004 Ten. 
App. LEXIS 321, 2004 WL 1102435, at *7 (affirming the trial court's ruling that a plaintiff who made purchases in New York could 
not recover under Tennessee's antitrust statute because the statute does not apply to transactions outside Tennessee), but 
because the parties have not addressed the particular statutes in these terms, I do not decide the issue."
374,100," This is not the same as the controversial notion of ""umbrella liability."" (Under a theory of umbrella liability, an antitrust plaintiff 
seeks damages for purchases from the defendants' competitors because the defendants, as a result of their conspiracy, created 
a ""price umbrella"" under which nonconspiring competitors could charge artificially high prices. See In re Coordinated Pretrial 
Proceedings in Petroleum Prods. Antitrust Litig., 691 F.2d 1335, 1338-41 (9th Cir. 1982); Mid-West Paper Products., Inc. v.

Cir. 1979).)"
374,101," See Freeman Indus., 2004 Tenn. App. LEXIS 321, 2004 WL 1102435, at *10 (affirming trial court's denial of summary 
judgment on unjust enrichment claim because the issue of which state's law should apply (that of New York, where the 
transaction occurred, or Tennessee, whose laws the plaintiff claimed the defendant violated) was a fact question ""inappropriate 
for summary judgment"")."
374,102," The argument still would not permit a restitutionary claim against the dealer associations, however, because there is no 
assertion that the associations have received a benefit from any increased revenues to the automobile companies. "
375,103," I have not addressed one of the arguments the defendants make, that a plaintiff seeking restitution for unjust enrichment must 
have conferred a benefit directly upon the defendant. That topic has divided the courts. A number of courts have held that 
indirect purchasers cannot recover restitution/disgorgement. See In re Relafen Antitrust Litig., 221 F.R.D. 260, 286-87 (D. Mass. 
2004) (interpreting North Carolina law); In re Vitamins Antitrust Litig., 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9585, MDL 1285, 2001 WL 849928, 
at *9 (D.D.C. April 11, 2001) (construing Tennessee law); Mylan I, 62 F. Supp.2d at 43-54 (analyzing unjust enrichment claims 
brought under Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, 
Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Washington, 
and West Virginia law); Stutzle, 2003 Phila. Ct. Com. Pl. LEXIS 74, 2003 WL 22250424, at *1 (interpreting Pennsylvania law). 
Other courts, however, have concluded that a direct benefit is not required for an unjust enrichment claim. See In re K-Dur, 338 
F. Supp.2d at 544-45 (evaluating ""claims under the unjust enrichment laws of fifty states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto 
Rico""); In re Cardizem, 105 F. Supp.2d at 668-71 (reviewing plaintiffs' Alabama, California, District of Columbia, Illinois, 
Michigan, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Tennessee and Wisconsin unjust enrichment claims); State, Dep't of Human 
Servs. ex rel. Palmer v. Unisys Corp., 637 N.W.2d 142, 155 (Iowa 2001); Cox v. Microsoft Corp., 8 A.D.3d 39, 778 N.Y.S.2d 
147, 149 (App. Div. 2004); Freeman Indus., 2004 Tenn. App. LEXIS 321, 2004 WL 1102435, at *10 (analyzing Tennessee law). I 
do not resolve its application in this case because I have dismissed the plaintiffs' freestanding unjust enrichment claim. Perhaps I 
will ultimately have to decide it in dealing with the ""parasitic"" restitution claims that remain, but I will first want to see the parties' 
arguments on the specific language of the individual states' statutory remedies. "

required before WUTC would transfer a Certificate. See TR at 51. The court requested that Waste Management-Washington's 
counsel provide a transcript of the WUTC proceedings regarding the transfer of the Certificate concerning the Fairchild AFB 
area. See TR at 52. Subsequently, Waste Management-Washington advised the court that it could not provide such a transcript,

404,11," Waste Management-Washington also argues that Blue Dot cannot be deemed ""responsible,"" because Waste Management-
Washington has an outstanding judgment against Blue Dot. See Waste Management-Washington Brief at 17-18. Although the

Dot's counsel indicated that Blue Dot's pursuit of that matter is far from over. See TR at 55. At any rate, the Administrative 
Record contains no information concerning whether that judgment is final or whether the time for appeal of the matter has

410,14," It is a matter of public record that the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice filed four complaints during the period 
February 15, 1996 to October 14, 2003 in federal district courts alleging that Waste Management-Washington's parent and 
affiliated corporations in other states have engaged in actions that violated federal antitrust law, including monopolization in 
violation of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2. In three of these actions, State Attorneys General also were plaintiffs. See United 
States v. Waste Management of Georgia, Inc., No. CV496-35 (S.D. Ga. Feb. 15, 1996) (complaint alleging monopolization in 
violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2, in small containerized hauling services in the states of Georgia and 
Louisiana); United States v. Waste Management, Inc., No. 98CV1768-FB-MDG (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 17, 1998) (complaint alleging 
that the acquisition of Eastern Environmental Services Inc. will lessen competition substantially and tend to create a monopoly in 
violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 7, in municipal solid waste in the states of New York, Pennsylvania, and 
Florida); United States v. Waste Management, Inc., No. 1:03CV01409 (D. D.C. June 27, 2003) (complaint alleging that the

412,15," The record also does not establish that the WUTC ""actively supervised"" compliance with local solid waste management plans. 
As discussed above, Waste Management-Washington's current Sole-Source Contract incorporates a subcontracting plan that 
provides that Olgoonik is providing collection of source separated recycling materials from residences at Fairchild AFB. See AR 
at 887-88. HN48[
] Under Wash. Rev. Code § 81.77, source separated recycling materials from residences requires a WUTC Certificate. The Administrative Record does not evidence that Olgoonik has such a Certificate and, therefore, appears to have 
been performing services at Fairchild AFB in violation of Wash. Rev. Code § 81.77. "

439,8," Suppliers were offered the process patent authorization both separately and in a package with instrument patent licenses. 
Applera's initial offer for the process rights was a $ 30,000 upfront issuance fee plus a fee of $ 400 per instrument, plus an 
additional $ 25/96 wells for instruments with greater than 96 wells. Some of the SAP agreements included a lower per-cycler fee. "
440,9," See, e.g., Letter from Jospeh H. Smith, Vice President, Intellectual property, PE Applied Biosystems, to Michael J. Finney [Doc. 
# 1168, Ex. 15] at PE 011719 (""We do not seek to influence whether you charge an authorization fee, to whom you charge an 
authorization fee, or how much you charge for an authorization fee. You could, for example, charge $ 500 to those who need it 
and $ 5 to those customers who might need it only for resale of their instrument. Or you could charge any other amount. That is 
strictly up to you. Our only concern is that you, and in turn, your customers, properly respect PE's intellectual property."")."
440,10," Professor Almarin Phillips, MJ's antitrust expert, concluded that ""an individual supplier of thermal cyclers, paying PE a uniform 
fee under the SAP on all of the thermal cyclers it sells, would also find it impossible profitably to price differentially, charging 
customers who require authorization to perform PCR in PE's field a higher price than it charges those who do not need that 
authorization."" Affirmation of Almarin Phillips [Doc. # 914] at P4; see also id. at PP3-9. "
441,11," While the parties dispute each others' statistics on the use of thermal cyclers to perform PCR in Applera's fields, it remains 
undisputed that a large majority of thermal cyclers are used for PCR. See, e.g. Letter from Joseph Smith, PE to Michael Finney, 
MJ, Jan. 30, 1998 [Doc. # 1168, Ex. 15] at PE 011718 (stating that ""worldwide, at least 93% of thermal cyclers need 
authorization""). MJ states that this percentage is misleading, because it was calculated on the usage pattern of PE/Applera's 
thermal cyclers, which were all ""authorized,"" so end users had no incentive to segregate out some thermal cyclers for non-PCR 
use. See Deposition of Murray S. Anderson, Jun. 20, 2000 [Doc. # 922, Ex. 45] at 186. See also Trial Transcript of Dr. Gerald 
Ford [Doc. # 1108] at 2198-2199 (testifying that study showed that 95.75% of all MJ Research thermal cyclers in the United 
States have been used to perform PCR in a Perkin-Elmer [Applera] field). MJ's evidence suggests a higher percentage of thermal cyclers are used for non-PCR purposes than Applera calculates. See, 
e.g. Videotaped Deposition of Michael Finney, Oct. 7, 1998 [Doc. # 559, Ex. 2] at 176 (""I would guess of the thermal cyclers that 
we are currently selling at this point, perhaps 20 percent are never used to perform PCR""); Declaration of Michelle Lizotte-
Waniewski, Feb. 13, 2004, PP7, 9 (stating that Human Genome Project was completed using cycle sequencing, not PCR, and "
442,," estimating that PCR has accounted for 40-50% of all reactions on thermal cyclers over the last ten years); Affidavit of Richard K. 
Wilson, Mar. 5, 2001, PP15-17 (stating that 90% of thermal cyclers in his genome sequencing lab are devoted to the 
performance of cycle sequencing). Applera argues, however, that MJ's evidence from sequencing labs, where cycle sequencing 
is concentrated, does not dispute that most thermal cyclers are used at least once for PCR. See Plaintiff's Submission in 
Response to Defendant's Supplemental Brief in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motions in Limine [Doc. # 937] at 6 n. 10."
442,12," Section 4 of the Clayton Act provides: ""Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything 
forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefore . . . without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover three-fold 
the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee."" "
443,13," Gypsum is a mineral used in construction material. ""Gypsum board is made by taking the crushed and calcined mineral, 
adding water, and spreading the gypsum slurry between two paper liners. When the gypsum hardens, the mineral adheres to the 
paper and the resulting product is used in construction."" U.S. Gypsum, 333 U.S. at 368."
443,14," The Court found that ""the provision in the license contracts that royalties should be paid on the production of unpatented board 
is strongly indicative of an agreement not to manufacture unpatented board, and the testimony of the witnesses is ample to show 
that there was an understanding, if not a formal agreement, that only patented board would be sold. Such an arrangement in 
purpose and effect increased the area of the patent monopoly and is invalid."" U.S. Gypsum, 333 U.S. at 397."
443,15," The licensing agreements defined ""jobbers"" as ""those who do not manufacture but buy and sell plasterboard or gypsum 
wallboard in straight cars or in mixed cars with other building material and who do not sell at retail."" U.S. Gypsum, 333 U.S. at 
385."
443,16," The Court concluded, ""since the defendants entered into a common scheme to stabilize the industry, and since the elimination 
of jobbers was undertaken by United States Gypsum in furtherance of that purpose, a finding of specific intent as to each 
licensee is not necessary. Nor do we agree that the elimination of jobbers falls within the protection of the patent grant when the 
purpose, as here, is to prevent competition by uncontrolled resale prices. The inference we draw from the uncontradicted 
evidence is that the defendants acted in concert to eliminate an important class of jobbers."" U.S. Gypsum, 333 U.S. at 397-98. "
444,17," US Gypsum issued a bulletin provision prohibiting the reduction of price on unpatented products, which the Supreme Court 
viewed as an attempt ""to stabilize plaster prices (an unpatented product), and the fact that plaster prices were stabilized only 
when plaster was sold in conjunction with board appears to us to be immaterial."" U.S. Gypsum, 333 U.S. at 399. "
445,18," See also Cummer-Graham Co. v. Straight Side Basket Corp., 142 F.2d 646 (5th Cir. 1944) (finding unlawful price-fixing 
conspiracy where the owner of a patent covering an attachment for a basket-making machine not only licensed the use of these 
attachments by charging a royalty of 2 1/2 % of the gross sales of baskets produced and sold, or five cents per dozen baskets, 
at the licensor's option, but also gave the patent holder the right to fix the selling price of the baskets themselves, as well as the 
terms and conditions of sale. Id. at 646. The Fifth Circuit found that the patent covering the use of the attachment on the basket-
making machine did not provide the patent holder with the right to ""fix, to the detriment of competition in commerce, the price of 
the articles made by using the machine. . . . Licensors of patented machines have no right to interfere with free competition in 
the sale of the unpatented products."" Id. at 647."
445,19," See Amended Report of Dr. Almarin Phillips, Oct. 17, 2000 [Doc. # 1168, Ex. 3] at 38 (""Under [Applera's] Supplier 
Authorization Program, the authorized thermal cycler manufacturers are still free to set their own prices for thermal cyclers. 
However, the payment of fees and royalties to [Applera] increases the minimum prices at which other authorized suppliers can 
profitably sell.""). "
446,20," Further, because Applera was entitled to seek to license its competitors in the thermal cycler market, MJ's evidence that some 
suppliers exited the market rather than joining the SAP or maintaining their business in a manner that did not induce 
infringement of Applera's patents fails to demonstrate impropriety. Appligene, for example, was accused by Applera of 
infringement and, upon exiting the thermal cycler market, entered into a monetary settlement agreement for claims of past 
infringement. See Settlement Agreement [Doc. # 1140, Ex. 47]."
446,21," Moreover, MJ has presented no evidence that SAP had as its objective the increase in cost of thermal cyclers for end users 
who did not want or need a PCR process license. The SAP itself imposed no restrictions on how suppliers could allocate the 
licensing fees, and the evidence in the record shows that Applera believed MJ or other suppliers retained the freedom to 
differentially price their thermal cyclers. See, e.g. Letter from Joseph H. Smith, Vice President, Intellectual property, PE Applied 
Biosystems, to Michael J. Finney [Doc. # 1168, Ex. 15] at PE 011719 (""We do not seek to influence whether you charge an 
authorization fee, to whom you charge an authorization fee, or how much you charge for an authorization fee. You could, for 
example, charge $ 500 to those who need it and $ 5 to those customers who might need it only for resale of their instrument. Or 
you could charge any other amount. That is strictly up to you. Our only concern is that you, and in turn, your customers, properly 
respect PE's intellectual property.""). "
447,22," MJ states in a footnote in its Memorandum of Opposition to Plaintiffs' Cross Motion and Reply Memorandum in Further 
Support of Summary Judgment determining that Plaintiffs Have Engaged in Price Fixing [Doc. # 1193] at 11 n. 19, that its 
argument regarding the ""most favored"" clauses in the SAP was meant only to demonstrate the existence of a horizontal 
understanding among the suppliers, not to challenge the ""most favored"" clause as itself per se illegal. As MJ had earlier argued 
that the most favored licensee clauses in the SAP agreement constituted an unlawful agreement to ""fix the SAP at an anti-
competitive rate"", see Motion in Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion in Limine to Preclude and Objection to Defendant's Evidence on 
Horizontal Price Fixing at 8, in the interest of completeness the Court will address the argument on its merits."
447,23," The Most Favored Licensee clause read as follows: ""11.1 If after signature of this Agreement, Perkin-Elmer grants to any 
unrelated third party, other than Roche a license of substantially the same scope as granted to Thermal Cycler Supplier herein 
but under more favorable royalty rates . . .Thermal Cycler Supplier shall have the right and option to substitute such more 
favorable royalty rates for the royalty rates contained herein . . .conditioned on Thermal Cycler Supplier's acceptance of all the 
same conditions, favorable or unfavorable . . . ."""
447,24," In 1991, Roche and Applera entered into a Distribution Agreement, in which Roche granted Applera exclusive rights to exploit 
the PCR Process Patents in such fields as research and development, and Roche retained exclusive rights to exploit the PCR 
Process Patents in such fields as diagnostics. See Distribution Agreement [Doc. # 402, Ex. 8]."
447,25," Applera's Marketing Plan for FY '95 states its intention to license competing manufacturers of thermal cyclers, and states, ""If 
accepted by our competitors this will result in a stabilization in the cycler market, will probably discourage any other suppliers 
from entering the market and will probably increase base prices for competitive instruments. This will result in an even stronger "
448,," price/product perception of PE by the customer base and our market share/unit numbers will increase."" FY'95 Marketing Plan 
[Doc. # 1140, Ex 2] at PE 205390. "
453,1," On June 28, 2002, Applera Corporation and Perkin-Elmer (""PE"") Corporation, its wholly owned subsidiary, entered into an 
agreement and liquidation plan in which PE Corporation was liquidated and the entirety of its assets, including intellectual 
property rights, was transferred to Applera Corporation. On June 3, 2003, this Court granted plaintiff's motion to amend the 
caption in this lawsuit to reflect the official change in Plaintiff's identity from ""PE Corporation"" to ""Applera Corporation."" See 
[Docs. # 664, 674]. For consistency, this Court will refer to plaintiff as Applera, even when referring to pre-2002 events."
453,2," Applera's '188 patent (U.S. Patent No. 4,965,188) covers ""the performance of PCR using a thermostable enzyme, in which the 
heating and cooling steps required by PCR . . . are automated by a machine that controls temperature levels, transitions from 
one temperature to another, and the timing of the temperature levels."" Joint Stipulation Regarding Claim Construction of the 
'202, '195, and '188 Patents [Doc. # 640] at P4. In other words, the patent covers the performance of PCR on a thermal cycler. "
454,3," MJ asked in its letter the following questions: ""If a user's authorized thermal cycler fails under warranty and is replaced, free of charge, with a new machine, must a 
second license fee be paid for the new machine? If the notice or serial number of a user's authorized thermal cycler is destroyed in an accident, can it be replaced? If a user's authorized thermal cycler is destroyed in an accident and replaced, must a new license be paid? If an authorized thermal cycler is stolen and replaced, must a new license fee be paid? If the stolen cycler is seized by the 
police and sold at an auction, along with the notice, is the license valid for the new owner? The proposed agreement states that transfer of a thermal cycler without serial number or notice terminates the license. But 
can a user sell the license without the thermal cycler? If a user owns both an authorized thermal cycler and an unauthorized thermal cycler, can the user transfer the license 
between them? If a user owns an unauthorized thermal cycler that is never used for PCR, must that user pay a license fee? If a user owns an unauthorized thermal cycler that is used for PCR only in a field not licensed to Perkin-Elmer, must that 
user pay a license fee? Can a thermal cycler supplier sell a thermal cycler to a user who does not plan to do any PCR with it, or who plans to do 
PCR only outside of Perkin Elmer's licensed fields, without either user or supplier having to pay a license fee?"" See Letter of Michael Finney to Hanna Fischer, Jan. 31, 1995 [Doc. # 1124, Ex. 3]. "
455,4," ""By averaging across all thermal cyclers, all of which carry the up-front PCR license rights, Perkin-Elmer's licensing and 
administrative costs are greatly reduced. We pass that savings along. The manufacturer's rate offered ($ 400.00 per 96-sample 
capacity thermal cycler used for PCR) permits manufacturers to recover their payments to Perkin-Elmer and their other costs at 
a fee price to PCR users equal to Perkin-Elmer's direct fee price to PCR users ( $ 1000.00 per 96-sample capacity thermal 
cycler used for PCR). Manufacturers are solely responsible for their own pricing and distribution systems and are totally free to 
charge different prices to PCR users and users who will not perform PCR. A further advantage is that manufacturers can legally 
promote and support their instruments for PCR and advertise them as 'Authorized for PCR', because they are."" Letter of Hanna 
Fischer to Michael J. Finney, Oct. 4, 1996 [Doc. # 1124, Ex. 9]."
455,5," ""[For each thermal cycler that is not authorized for PCR], MJ Research will obtain from the customer, in advance of purchase 
and annually until 2004 a written statement that the thermal cycler (a) will not be and, after purchase has not been, used for 
PCR, or (b) will be used for PCR but not in Research or another Perkin-Elmer Field, or (c) will be used in a country where no 
PCR process claims are issued or pending, as the case may be. Perkin-Elmer will initially provide MJ Research with the 
statement form to be used. MJ Research will provide Perkin-Elmer with a copy of all statements. . . ."" Letter of Hanna Fischer to 
Michael J. Finney, Oct. 4, 1996 [Doc. # 671, Ex. 5]."
455,6," ""The decision to purchase an ""authorization"" license is solely at the discretion of the thermal cycler user. Since there are many 
possible uses of thermal cyclers, including cycle sequencing and applications of PCR for which Perkin-Elmer has no rights, it is 
not the place of a thermal cycler manufacturer or vendor to enforce the purchase of any type of license. As a service to those of 
our customers who wish to purchase an authorization license, we wish to make available pre-licensed thermal cyclers. Certainly 
the onerous enforcement requirements of the offer you have sent us are not worth a 10% discount on the price already available "
456,," to us for the licenses [as Applera sold end user licenses for $ 1000 per cycler]."" Letter from Michael Finney to Hanna Fischer, 
Dec. 12, 1996 [Doc. # 1124, Ex. 10]."
456,7," See Letter from Hanna Fischer to Michael Finney, Aug. 15, 1997 [Doc. # 1124, Ex. 12] at PE 011750 (""I am returning with this 
letter your company's check for $ 23,450 which I understand was intended to be for the up-front PCR license fee you wish to 
include with 23 thermal cyclers being sold to PCR Users. As recently reiterated in my July letters, 'PCR User' agreements are 
not for manufacturers, and we will not accept them from MJ Research.""); see also Letter from Hanna Fischer to Michael Finney, 
Jul. 2, 1997 [Doc. # 1124, Ex. 11] at PE 011767 (""Very recently your company sent in a few PCR End User TC Authorization 
Agreements, which your company executed as the 'PCR User'. We were somewhat apprehensive that MJ Research might be 
obtaining these agreements on behalf of others outside your company, effectively acting as our agent which we had already 
rejected. We, therefore, emphasized to your employees that these are PCR User agreements, not agreements for instrument 
manufacturers . . . It is now quite clear that you are doing the very thing Perkin-Elmer refused to allow you to do. Your recent 
advertisement, ""The MJ Research Notebook"" for Summer 1997, states to the scientific community that your company is Perkin-
Elmer's agent for the purpose of issuing stickers that a PCR User obtains when s'he receives an Authorization Agreement. This 
is untrue! Perkin-Elmer demands that the ad be recalled and that such misrepresentation cease immediately."")"
456,8," While MJ asserts that the January 1998 proposal differed from the October 1996 offer in that it immunized MJ from suit, as the 
Court reads the two proposals offered to MJ, both the 1996 and the 1998 versions provided that ""MJ Research may promote its 
thermal cyclers for PCR and advertise its thermal cyclers as ""Authorized for PCR"", which will not be considered to be 
inducement of infringement if the remaining terms are complied with."" See Fischer Letter, Oct. 4, 1996 [Doc. # 1124, Ex. 9] at PE 
011791; Fischer Letter, Jan. 15, 1998 [Doc. # 1124, Ex. 14] at PE 011687. "
458,9," Further, MJ asserts that the SAP requires royalties on unpatented equipment, pointing to seven SAP agreements that require 
payment of royalties on ""all modules and components."" MJ argues that such components include spare parts used merely in lieu 
of the existing blocks for which a royalty had already been paid, and therefore the royalty fee would be unnecessary to protect 
Applera's patent rights."
458,10," See, e.g. Trial Transcript of Dr. Gerald Ford [Doc. # 1108] at 2198-2199 (testifying that study showed that 95.75% of all MJ 
Research thermal cyclers in the United States have been used to perform PCR in a Perkin-Elmer [Applera] field). MJ challenges 
this survey on grounds that the survey asked to speak with the person most knowledgeable about how thermal cyclers in the lab 
were used, which would not necessarily limit the respondents to persons with first-hand knowledge of the facts of interest; and 
that the survey did not adequately ascertain whether the respondents were familiar with the technical distinctions among the 
""fields"" of use (which comprised the study because Applera's patent rights extended only to certain fields). See id. at 222933, 
2234-39. See also Letter from Joseph Smith, PE to Michael Finney, MJ, Jan. 30, 1998 [Doc. # 1124, Ex. 15] at 1 (stating that 
""worldwide, at least 93% of thermal cyclers need authorization"" and offering to discount the royalty to reflect the 7% of thermal 
cyclers not used for PCR). MJ states that this percentage is misleading, because it was calculated on the usage pattern of 
PE/Applera's thermal cyclers, which were all ""authorized,"" so end users had no incentive to segregate out some thermal cyclers 
for non-PCR use. See Deposition of Murray S. Anderson, Jun. 20, 2000 [Doc. # 922, Ex. 45] at 186. In addition, MJ states that 
PE/Applera did not discount based on use outside of its fields, or outside of the United States. See id. at 180. MJ's evidence suggests a higher percentage of thermal cyclers are used for non-PCR purposes. See, e.g. Videotaped 
Deposition of Michael Finney, Oct. 7, 1998 [Doc. # 559, Ex. 2] at 176 (""I would guess of the thermal cyclers that we are currently 
selling at this point, perhaps 20 percent are never used to perform PCR""); Declaration of Michelle Lizotte-Waniewski, Feb. 13, 
2004, PP7, 9 (stating that Human Genome Project was completed using cycle sequencing, not PCR, and estimating that PCR 
has accounted for 40-50% of all reactions on thermal cyclers over the last ten years); Affidavit of Richard K. Wilson, Mar. 5, 
2001, PP15-17 (stating that 90% of thermal cyclers in his genome sequencing lab are devoted to the performance of cycle 
sequencing). Applera argues, however, that MJ's evidence from sequencing labs, where cycle sequencing is concentrated, does 
not dispute that most thermal cyclers are used at least once for PCR. See Plaintiff's Submission in Response to Defendant's 
Supplemental Brief in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motions in Limine [Doc. # 937] at 6 n. 10. "
459,11," Moreover, MJ asserts that even if the discount to the supplier matches the number of thermal cyclers used for PCR, 
purchasers of thermal cyclers would still pay a fee for the PCR process rights regardless of whether they need them. However, 
Applera expressly stated to MJ that Applera played no role in suppliers' decisions about what to charge its customers and the 
SAP does not require the suppliers to impose its royalty fee on all thermal cycler buyers. Thus, MJ, like all suppliers, would be, 
at least in theory, free to determine which of its customers need the patent license, and which do not, and charge them 
accordingly. See, e.g. Letter of Joseph H. Smith to Michael J. Finney, Jan. 30, 1998 [Doc. # 671, Ex. 2] at 1-2. MJ rejoins that 
the supplier ""would still be compelled by market dynamics to collect a fee from every customer."" See Supplemental Brief in 
Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motions in Limine [Doc. # 924] at 26; see also Almarin Phillips Affirmation, Feb 13, 2004 [Doc. # 914], at 
PP3-9 (stating that differential pricing is not possible in the thermal cycler market in the case where the manufacturer is paying a 
royalty on each instrument regardless of where it is licensed)."
459,12," MJ's offer to distribute end user licenses was not such an alternative, because under such an arrangement MJ would not be 
the licensee at all. A supplier license would allow suppliers to promote their thermal cyclers for PCR use without risking liability 
for inducing infringement of Applera's process patents. "
460,13," Applera's November 25, 1995 letter to Protean states that it ""has already licensed three thermal cycler suppliers and, 
therefore, the financial terms of the Thermal Cycler Supplier Agreement are already set and no longer negotiable."" Id."
460,14," In addition, suppliers who ultimately did not participate in the SAP expressed concerns to Applera. See, e.g. Letter of Hubert 
Wagner, Barnstead/Thermolyne, to Hanna Fischer, Oct. 19, 1995 [Doc. # 922, Ex. 43] (""The terms which B/T thinks are onerous 
and would like amended are as follows: . . . The purchasers of B/T's units should have the option of purchasing either a unit 
which has been licensed for the PCR process or one that does not provide the user such a license. The units sold without a 
license would be clearly marked as 'Not Licensed for use in performing the PCR process.' B/T would not of course have to pay 
Perkin-Elmer for units sold without a license.""). The Court can find nothing in the record indicating Applera's response to this 
letter, or showing that Applera refused to consider actual use proposals or to license B/T if B/T did not accept the terms of 
Applera's initial SAP proposal. MJ also notes that other suppliers protested the SAP because the thermal cyclers they sold had multiple uses not simply PCR. 
See Letter from Richard Coy, Coy Corp. to Hanna Fischer, July 7, 1994 [Doc. # 1124, Ex. 28] (stating that Coy's ""instruments 
have multiple uses, not just for the PCR process,"" and that in its view its manufacture and sale of these products did not 
constitute inducement of infringement.""); Letter from Kirk Ririe, Idaho Technology, Sept. 9, 1994 [Doc. # 1124, Ex. 29] (stating 
that its thermal cyclers were not suitable for PCR and that it did not believe it was infringing Applera's process patents). Neither 
Coy nor Idaho technology specifically object to the total sales royalty aspect of the licensing program, however, instead 
challenging their need for a license of any kind. Moreover, there is no record evidence of Applera's response to these letters or 
of any further negotiations between Applera and these suppliers."
460,15," In these notes, Constantine writes: ""SJC explained that he wanted to set out the basis behind our offer of 6.6.96. . . "" $ 300 a 
command module accepted, will be added to our invoices with the customer allowed not to pay it if either they do not use it for 
PCR or they are licensed in some other way. . .HF responded "" $ 300 is a weighted average and takes account of the fact that 
some sites are authorised already in some disciplines. It is a charge on the manufacturer, rather than on the customer, who 
would have to pay $ 1,000 per instrument otherwise. This is the first I have heard of such an argument."" Notes of Simon 
Constantine of Meeting with Hanna Fischer, Oct. 4, 1996 [Doc. # 922, Ex. 42]. The Court's record does not include any evidence 
that Constantine pursued the actual use offer after hearing Fisher's explanation for the $ 300 per cycler fee for ""the first time."" 
Soon after, in December 1996, Hybaid joined the Supplier Authorization Program. An earlier file note reflecting Hybaid's 
negotiation with Applera states that Constantine told Hanna Fisher that a ""process fee at $ 300 a control module OK but not to 
customers who already have a license. Hanna said there were not many of these."" Affidavit of Simon Constantine, attached to 
Supplemental Brief in Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motions in Limine [Doc. # 924, Ex. B] at MJ8057674. In February 1996, 
Constantine wrote to Applera that ""I believe we should either take out a license under the PCR process patent for all our 
instruments or for none. On re-reading the Thermal Cycler Supplier Agreement, however, I note that the define Fields in 
paragraph 1.5 exclude human diagnostics. We have various other technologies within the Group which may be developed in 
conjunction with Hybaid and for which we may need a wider agreement."" Id. at Ex. C, MJ8058119. "
461,16," For example, the thermal cycler supplier Protean proposed to Applera a discounted per-cycler price on a total sales basis 
under the existing Supplier Authorization Program, not an alternative to the total sales approach. See Letter from GR Rampton, 
Protean LLC to Hanna Fischer, Aug. 18, 1995 [Doc. # 470, Ex. 50](""Techne will pay $ 300 per unit for a license under the 
process patents for products sold in those territories where Perkin-Elmer owns or is licensed to convey rights equivalent to the 
US patents identified in the agreement."")."
461,17," For example, the thermal cycler supplier Stratagene, which was already participating in Applera's Supplier Authorization 
Program, wrote to Applera stating, ""so that Stratagene will no longer be competitively disadvantaged, Stratagene may consider 
offering two lines of thermal cyclers, one with a PCR process license provided by Stratagene and one with the PCR process 
license to be obtained by the customer."" Letter from Brent Keller to Hanna Fischer, July 8, 1998 [Doc. # 1124, Ex. 37]. In 
response, Applera agreed to an actual use royalty, stating that ""the changes you proposed are not permitted under your current 
agreement"" and that they would need to negotiate a new agreement, which ""would be under different financial terms and would 
require Stratagene to implement a customer compliance program."" Letter from Hanna Fischer to Brent Keller, July 31, 1998 
[Doc. # 1124, Ex. 38]."
461,18," This argument is somewhat perplexing, as it implies that the alternative was, on its face, permissible under the antitrust laws, 
which is inconsistent with MJ's core argument that the terms of Applera's alternative proposal themselves constituted patent 
misuse. "
462,19," Applying this standard, MJ's evidence that suppliers' acceptance of the SAP was slow and that suppliers joined the SAP in the 
expectation that all other competitors would also join is not material to the total sales royalty issue. Nor is it relevant that the 
jury's Phase I award of damages for MJ's inducement of infringement was less than the estimated royalty rate under the SAP. 
The key issue is whether Applera conditioned its license grant on a licensee's acceptance of a total sales royalty. "
463,20," In contrast to John Finney's detailed declaration, prepared on February 15, 2004 for the third round of briefing on this subject, 
the record of MJ's contemporaneous communications with Applera reveal only a generalized concern that MJ did not want to 
police its customers. See Letter of Michael Finney to Hanna Fischer, Dec. 12, 1996 [Doc. # 1124, Ex. 10] (""Certainly the onerous 
enforcement requirements of the offer you have sent us are not worth a 10% discount on the price already available to us for the 
licenses.""); Letter of Michael Finney to Michael W. Hunkapiller, Sept. 30, 1997 [Doc. # 1124, Ex. 13]. Because MJ did not 
contemporaneously inform Applera about the basis for its concerns about the burdens imposed by Applera's actual use 
proposal, an examination of Applera's subjective intent would require asking whether Applera designed the requirements to 
ensure MJ's rejection of the alternative. The evidence MJ has presented in this regard is limited. There is evidence that Applera 
strongly preferred the SAP over other approaches. John Finney, moreover, states in his declaration his conclusion that Applera 
""well knew"" that one condition of Applera's alternative proposal -- disabling the PCR software in thermal cycler machines -- 
would be problematic. There are no facts in the record establishing how Applera would have such knowledge. Applera 
subsequently amended its proposal to remove the requirement that MJ disable its software for PCR use."
463,21," A core factual dispute in Phase I of this case was whether MJ's disclaimers informing its customers about the need for a 
license from Applera were sufficient to establish that they lacked the intent required for liability for inducing infringement under 
35 U.S.C. § 271(b). See, e.g. Cote Decl. [Doc. # 787] Ex. 61 at PE 079513 (MJ Research Notebook Autumn 1994) (""… PCR is a 
process covered by patents owned by Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc. Users should obtain license to perform the reaction.""); Stern "

a process covered by U.S. Patent 4,683,195. A license to perform PCR in any thermal cycling equipment is available from either 
Roche Molecular Systems of Branchburg NJ, or Perkin Elmer of Norwalk CT.""). But see MJ Memorandum dated June 1998 
[Doc. # 670, Ex. 10] at MJ 7002391 (""In spite of everything we are dealing with regarding PE and the stickers, the truth is most 
people don't bother to pay PE and get the sticker [i.e. end user license].""); E-mail from Michael Mortillaro to John Hanson, Jun.

are telling the customer that 'authorization' is important. I have lost sales to researchers who deem it important that they need 
authorized cyclers. The more we feed into the paranoia of cycler 'authorization,' the fewer instruments we will sell.""). The jury 
returned a verdict that MJ and Michael and John Finney willfully induced infringement of Applera's process patents."
464,22," The parties agree that royalties would be paid on replacement machines and loaners. Applera, notes, however, that it 
expressed flexibility about waiving a second authorization fee where a thermal cycler quickly failed and needed to be replaced.

performance of PCR on a thermal cycler, after its prior practice of licensing MJ to perform PCR internally. Applera has offered as 
its justification for these refusals its concern that MJ was trying to transfer those end user licenses to MJ's customers and not 
simply using them for internal use. In any event, given that Aspen Skiing was not concerned with intersection of patent and 
antitrust law, and the Supreme Court's later caution that Aspen Skiing represents the ""outer boundary"" of Sherman Act Section

479,12," As discussed in the Ruling on Motion in Limine to Exclude MJ's Evidence and Arguments Claiming PCR Rights are Tied to

unwanted thermal cyclers."

] whether a 
producer's combined products should be considered as separate can be decided only by looking at consumer behavior. It is the 
relationship of the producer's selling decision to market demand, not the physical characteristics of the products alone, that 
determines the existence of legally separable products.'"" (quoting Klamath-Lake Pharmaceutical Assoc. v. Klamath Medical 
Service Bureau, 701 F.2d 1276, 1289 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 822, 78 L. Ed. 2d 96, 104 S. Ct. 88 (1983) (emphasis in 
original). Thus, a finding that thermal cyclers had substantial non-infringing uses, while relevant to the issue of consumer 
demand, does not resolve the demand question. The fact that thermal cyclers preceded the development of the PCR process, 
for example, does not create any inferences about the nature of the market for thermal cyclers after the development of PCR. 
Nor does a finding that Applera's cycle sequencing kit sales approached 70% of the annual sales of the PCR business require 
the conclusion that those thermal cyclers used for cycle sequencing were not also used for PCR; thermal cyclers might 
commonly be used for both PCR and cycle sequencing. Among the unanswered but relevant questions to market demand are 
whether new thermal cycler manufacturers entered the market, whether their output has increased, or whether it would be 
efficient for manufacturers to produce only thermal cyclers that did not need PCR authorization rights. "
480,14," MJ argues that end user licenses were unavailable, and cites the following deposition testimony from Joseph Smith, Applera's 
in-house counsel: Q. Okay. So at least until your supplier authorization program [SAP] went into effect, is it correct to say that the only way 
someone could get a license to do PCR was to use an [Applera] thermal cycler and buy an authorized reagent? A. In our field. Deposition Transcript of Joseph Smith, Jan. 11, 2000 [Doc. # 783, Ex. 23] at 95. MJ also relies on the trial testimony of Dr. Michael Hunkapiller, who stated that he was not aware of any end user getting an 
authorization for a non-PE thermal cycler in 1993. See Trial Tr. Vol. II [Doc. # 1299] at 452. Applera disputes the contention that end-user licenses were unavailable before 1994. The evidence in the record that Applera 
points to includes (1) deposition testimony from its licensing director, Hannelore Fischer, stating that Applera's basic licensing 
structure was in place when she joined the firm in 1993, see Deposition Transcript of Hannelore Fischer, Nov. 4, 1999 [Doc. # 
811, Ex. 2] at 296, 392; (2) MJ's disclaimers in its pre-1994 advertisements that stated ""users must obtain a license to perform

[Applera] of Norwalk, Connecticut,"" see Letter of John Hanson, Director of Special Projects, MJ Research to John Warner,

from John Warner to John Hanson, Oct. 15, 1992 [Doc. # 811, Ex. 7] at PE 012386;"" (4) the terms of Applera's 1991 Distribution

asserted acts designed to maintain its monopoly, the statute of limitations is restarted, provided that the subsequent acts fall 
within the definition of independent predicate acts,"" that is, an act that is ""not merely a reaffirmation of a previous act and that 
inflicts new and accumulating injury on the plaintiff."" II Areeda & Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law, P320c4 (2000) at 219, 221 (citation

that the SAP introduced by Applera in 1994 represented a departure from the previous licensing system, and therefore was an 
independent predicate act. "
481,17," MJ raised the pre-1994 tying issue in its Motion in Limine by MJ Research Inc. and Michael and John Finney to Preclude

Fields and Thermal Cyclers are Not Separate Products and That the Plaintiffs' Licensing Program was Not a Tie Before 1994 
[Doc. # 781]. "
482,18," MJ's evidence of anticompetitive intent consists of Applera's FY'95 Marketing Plan, which stated its intention to ""re-establish 
[Applera's] dominant position,"" and indicated that its SAP was expected to result in a ""stabilization in the cycler market, will 
probably discourage any other suppliers from entering the market and will probably increase base prices for competitive 
instruments."" See FY '95 Marketing Plan: PCR Instruments and Consumables [Doc. # 1140, Ex. 2] at PE 025390. MJ also 
proffers an Applera document prepared for a 1995 planning meeting, stating its intention to ""continue to use patent position to 
stabilize market, generate income, and gain access to complementary technologies."" See PCR Products: FY95 Planning 
Meeting, Feb. 16, 1994 [Doc. # 1140, Ex. 1] at PE 026132. MJ asserts that Applera has never offered a business justification for 
its change in licensing program to require ""authorized"" thermal cyclers when prior to 1992, end users could become fully 
licensed to perform PCR through the purchase of licensed reagents. MJ also argues that Applera's delay in producing four 1992 documents concerning Applera's consideration of licensing 
alternatives should result in the sanction of precluding Applera from denying that the intent behind the SAP was the 
monopolization of the market for thermal cyclers. The Court previously granted MJ's motion to exclude these documents. Given 
the Court's finding that intent alone cannot support MJ's monopolization claim, and that the SAP has not been shown to be 
exclusionary, the sanction MJ seeks would not impact the result in this case, and thus it is not necessary to reach the issue. "

design and understanding, or a meeting of minds in an unlawful arrangement,'"" Michelman v. Clark-Schwebel Fiber Glass Corp., 
534 F.2d 1036, 1043 (2d Cir. 1976) (quoting American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U.S. 781, 810, 90 L. Ed. 1575, 66 S. 
Ct. 1125 (1946)), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 885, 50 L. Ed. 2d 166, 97 S. Ct. 236, (1976). Plaintiff has not attempted this showing 
and without more facts than the record contains it is not plausible to infer that the third party payers participated in a conspiracy 
to limit the number a patients that used RASC. Both payers benefitted from RASC's presence by way of lower prices and in 
using it as a negotiating tool against the Hospital. "
511,10," ""Defendant Rome Hospital has, through the anticompetitive, exclusionary and predatory conduct described above, used its 
power in the market for general inpatient acute care hospital services to obtain monopoly power in the market for outpatient 
surgery."" Second Amended Complaint P198. "
514,11," In short, this method amounts to designating the smallest geographic are a from which a certain percentage of defendants' 
patients originate. This is the competitor's ""service area."" The requisite percentage is in dispute, but the range is between 75 and 
90%. The second step is to determine the substitutes available within that market to those original patients. The third step 
consists of considering the additional patients that those competitors serve. The thinking is that if part of the competitor's market 
can or would use the alternatives available than they all might use them in response to a price increase or quality decrease. The 
geographic market is then redrawn to include a threshold percentage of the substitute suppliers' originating patients. The 
number of patients in the total market is found according to that second drawing. The number of the patients the competitor 
serves is placed (in the numerator) over the number of patients served by both the competitor and the substitutes combined (the 
denominator) to arrive at the competitor's market share. "
515,12," The second amended complaint does not allege that the third party payers were part of this conspiracy. As explained in 
footnote No. 8 above, where Conspiracy to Restrain Trade (Fifth Cause of Action) was discussed, MVP and BCBS will not be 
considered under this cause of action.."
515,13," HN36[
] The Sherman Act requires proof of conspiracies that are ""reciprocally distinguishable from and independent of each 
other although the objects of the conspiracies may partially overlap."" American Tobacco Co., 328 U.S. at 788. "
516,14," Defendants argue that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine would apply here to insulate them from suit based on their protected 
right to petition the government despite any antitrust implications of their acts. Plaintiff argues that a ""sham"" exception to the 
doctrine applies to allow suit. The activities taken in opposition to RASC's CoN are one of several facts listed as background to 
support the inference of a conspiracy, not the subject of the action. A decision on the application of immunity, or any exception, 
is not required for purposes of this summary judgment motion as plaintiff has set forth sufficient facts regardless. "
527,1," The Act provides in relevant part: HN5[
] Sec. 1. Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal. . . . Sec. 2. Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or 
persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be 
deemed guilty of a felony. . . . 15 U.S.C. §§ 1-2 "
535,1," The Court has noted that antitrust standing is somewhat different from constitutional standing because it requires additional 
considerations, but both share the same basic requirements. See Associated Gen. Contractors, 459 U.S. at 535 n.31. "
540,1, Perhaps it might be appropriate to observe at this point that law of the case is a doctrine you only need when you're wrong. 
546,1," The Noerr-Pennington doctrine, which originates from a ""trio of federal antitrust cases, California Motor Transport Co. v. 
Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508, 92 S. Ct. 609, 30 L. Ed. 2d 642 (1972), United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85

concerted effort to influence public officials regardless of intent or purpose."" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Zeller v. 
Consolini, 59 Conn. App. 545, 550, 758 A.2d 376 (2000). HN1[
] ""The Noerr-Pennington doctrine has evolved from its antitrust 
origins to apply to a myriad of situations in which it shields individuals from liability for petitioning a governmental entity for 
redress."" Id., 551. The doctrine is applicable to ""claims which [seek] to assign liability on the basis of the defendant's exercise of 
its first amendment rights."" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id."
546,2," The defendant asserts that the withdrawal was based on a review of the costs, and the facts that Clinton Crossing was fully 
operational and that potential recovery was limited. "
548,3," At the time the bankruptcy petition and the adversary proceeding were filed, rule 9011 (a) provided: HN7[
] ""Signature. Every 
petition, pleading, motion and other paper served or filed in a case under the Code on behalf of a party represented by an 
attorney, except a list, schedule, or statement, or amendments thereto, shall be signed by at least one attorney of record in the 
attorney's individual name, whose office address and telephone number shall be stated. A party who is not represented by an 
attorney shall sign all papers and state the party's address and telephone number. The signature of an attorney or a party 
constitutes a certificate that the attorney or a party has read the document; that to the best of the attorney's or party's 
knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry it is well grounded in fact and is warranted by existing law or 
a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law; and that it is not interposed for any improper 
purpose, such as to harass or cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation or administration of the 
case. If a document is not signed, it shall be stricken unless it is signed promptly after the omission is called to the attention of 
the person whose signature is required. If a document is signed in violation of this rule, the court on motion or on its own 
initiative, shall impose on the person who signed it, the represented party, or both, an appropriate sanction, which may include 
an order to pay to the other party or parties the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred because of the filing of the 
document, including a reasonable attorney's fee."" (Emphasis in original.) Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9011 (a) (1994). The rule was 
amended significantly on December 1, 1997. "
549,4," Cf. Couloute v. Hunt, Leibert, Chester & Jacobson, LLC, 295 B.R. 689, 692 n.1 (D. Conn. 2003) (remarking that plaintiff's 
CUTPA, slander claims arising out of violation of bankruptcy stay were properly heard in Bankruptcy Court); see also Gonzales 
v. Parks, 830 F.2d 1033 (9th Cir. 1987); Glannon v. Garrett & Associates, Inc., 261 B.R. 259 (D. Kan. 2001); Koffman v.

549,5," In its memorandum of decision, the court stated: ""Count one alleges that [the defendant's] conduct relating to the filing of the 
adversary proceeding violated CUTPA . . . ."" "
561,1," In the submissions before me, Mr. Maddaloni is variously identified as Luigi Maddaloni, Louis Maddaloni, and Lou Maddaloni. I 
refer to him as Lou Maddaloni based on the prevailing usage in the plaintiff's opposition papers, and the need to distinguish him 
from both the plaintiff and Laura Maddaloni, whose deposition testimony is cited herein. "
563,2," N.Y. Penal L. § 180.08 states: HN11[
] ""An employee, agent or fiduciary is guilty of commercial bribe receiving in the first 
degree when, without the consent of his employer or principal, he solicits, accepts or agrees to accept any benefit from another 
person upon an agreement or understanding that such benefit will influence his conduct in relation to his employer's or 
principal's affairs, and when the value of the benefit solicited, accepted or agreed to be accepted exceeds one thousand dollars 
and causes economic harm to the employer or principal in an amount exceeding two hundred fifty dollars."" "
564,3," Plaintiff's counsel speculated at oral argument that its customers sometimes purchased vintage or used Rolexes, therein 
depriving Rolex of the proceeds it would have received from the sales of new watches. (Transcript, Dec. 10, 2004, at 5-6) The 
speculation does not address whether the same number of new Rolex watches would have been sold, albeit by different 
retailers. "
565,4," In his affidavit, Mr. Maddaloni states that Mazzeo said, ""it [the money] feels like you'll be getting 1.3 million in product this year."" 
(Maddaloni Affidavit P26) Although not material to the disposition of the summary judgment motion, Mazzeo denies that the 
encounter took place. (Deposition of Lawrence Mazzeo, Nov. 3, 2003, at 229-30, attached at Def. 56.1 Ex. I) "
567,5," Assuming arguendo that Maddaloni Jewelers had proffered evidence that Rolex suffered the requisite monetary loss, and, 
hence, that the conduct violated N.Y. Penal Law § 180.08, plaintiff nevertheless would have failed to establish two distinct 
predicate acts. See Polycast Technology Corp. v. Uniroyal, Inc., 728 F. Supp. 926, 945 (S.D.N.Y. 1989) (a single 
misrepresentation that violated two securities laws established only a single predicate act for RICO purposes) (citing U.S. v. 
Walgren, 885 F.2d 1417 (9th Cir. 1989); U.S. v. Kragness, 830 F.2d 842, 861 (8th Cir. 1987)). "
578,1, JamSports took Mays' deposition on video during the course of discovery. 
581,2," The Court strongly urges JamSports to carefully think through its strategy. In the Court's experience, the use of a deposition, 
even a videotaped deposition, tends to take a good deal of the ""punch"" out of the presentation of evidence, even with regard to 
an adverse witness, and risks boring the jury. "
583,3," Clear Channel suggests in passing that the venue managers are ""impartial,"" but that is not necessarily so: they, or at least 
some of them, have had ongoing business relationships with Clear Channel. But in any event, a claim of impartiality does not 
substitute for Rule 703's requirement that inadmissible data be of the type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular 
field. "
585,4," JamSports says that even after the original non-production of the Ticketmaster rebate records became known, Clear Channel 
still refused to produce complete records in this regard. It argues that it would be unfair for Clear Channel to imply in questioning 
Siwek or in argument that Siwek's analysis cannot be believed because he is unaware of how the revenues are calculated. 
Ruling on this point will have to await the Court's final determination of JamSports' renewed motion for sanctions and other relief, 
see supra at 8-9, which involves the disclosure of the Ticketmaster information."
585,5," The Court also notes that our ruling made it clear we perceived Clear Channel's arguments about the deficiencies in 
JamSports' essential facilities claims to address only the claims other than Count 15. See JamSports and Entertainment, 336 F. 
Supp. 2d at 837 (""Counts 5, 6 and 12 … are based on the essential facilities doctrine""). Clear Channel did not seek 
reconsideration on the ground that the Court had overlooked application of these same arguments to Count 15. "
587,6," In addressing the parties' summary judgment motions, the Court was not required to address the legitimacy of the particular 
business tactics of Clear Channel that are the subject of these in limine requests. The Court stated in a footnote that if Clear 
Channel ""wishes to seek an order excluding [these] matters at trial,"" it should do so by way of a motion in limine. JamSports and 
Entertainment, 336 F. Supp. 2d at 845 n. 9. What the Court was inviting was a motion to exclude evidence if proper grounds 
existed. But Clear Channel has not moved to exclude the evidence in question. Rather, as noted in the text, it seeks only to 
prevent certain characterizations of the evidence. "
588,7," It is conceivable that the e-mail communications that are incorporated into the diary may be admissible on some basis. Our 
discussion focuses on the diary's rendition of Mickelson's conversations with venue managers. "
603,1," HN1[
] Rule 56.1 of the Local Civil Rules of the Southern District of New York requires parties moving for summary judgment to submit ""a separate, short and concise statement of the material facts as to which the moving party contends there is no 
genuine issue to be tried."" Local Civil Rule 56.1(a) (2003). The facts set forth in a moving party's statement ""will be deemed to 
be admitted for purposes of the motion unless controverted"" by the opposing party's statement. Local Civil Rule 56.1(c). All 
statements ""must be followed by citation to evidence which would be admissible"" under the Federal Rules of Evidence. Local 
Civil Rule 56.1(d). The Booking Agency Defendants have moved to strike all Plaintiffs' Local Civil Rule 56.1 Statements as not in compliance with 
the Local Civil Rules, as well as Plaintiffs' affidavits not in compliance with Rule 56(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. 
(Booking Agency Defs.' Mem. in Supp. of Mots. to Strike, dated May 23, 2003 (""Joint Mem. Supp. Mot. Strike"").) The Court 
issued orders on May 30, 2003, and June 2, 2003, notifying Plaintiffs that their responses were not in compliance with Local Civil 
Rule 56.1, together with an instructing memorandum. Plaintiffs amended their Local Civil Rule 56.1 Statements on June 16, 
2003. (E.g., Pls.' Am. Local Rule 56.1 Stmt. of Disputed Facts in Supp. of Pls.' Opp'n to Booking Agency Defs.' Joint Mot. for 
Summ. J., dated June 16, 2003 (""Pls.' Am. Joint 56.1 Stmt."").) Because these statements are still argumentative and conclusory, 
and often not supported by citations to evidence, the Court will strike for failure to comply with Local Civil Rule 56.1 the portions 
of the Plaintiffs' Rule 56.1 Statements and supporting affidavits that constitute argument and conclusory statements not shown 
to be made on an affiant's personal knowledge. See Hollander v. American Cyanamid Co., 172 F.3d 192, 198 (2d Cir. 1999). 
The Court will also disregard all statements in the affidavits that do not meet the standard of response required by Rule 56(e) of 
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Holtz v. Rockefeller & Co., Inc., 258 F.3d 62, 73 (2d Cir. 2001) HN2[
] (""A district 
court has broad discretion to determine whether to overlook a party's failure to comply with local court rules."")."
603,2," Plaintiffs move to strike the affidavit of Geraldine G. Papa, dated May 23, 2003. This affidavit by a paralegal consists of her 
itemization of misrepresentations contained in Plaintiffs' Response to the Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment and her 
interpretation of the correct interpretation of the underlying deposition testimony. As Plaintiffs point out, the filing of the affidavit "
604,," gave the Defendants fifteen extra pages to reply to Plaintiffs' opposition papers, in violation of the Court's instructions on the 
length of memoranda to be submitted to the Court. On the other hand, Plaintiffs have used smaller type size, larger margins and 
different spacing than the Court's rules contemplate to comply with the page limitations. The Court has found that there have 
been numerous misrepresentations of testimony or half truths in the Plaintiffs' responsive papers, which would derogate from the 
Defendants' flow of argument and Defendants had little choice but to supplement their legal argument in this fashion. In point of 
fact, as one can discern from the length of this opinion and the time elapsed since argument, the Court has laboriously 
concluded an intensive review of the mountain of unorganized materials presented in those motions and did not rely on the Papa 
affidavit for its determinations. Nevertheless, because the Papa affidavit constitutes an unauthorized briefing, the Court grants 
the Plaintiffs' motion."
604,3," Originally, BAB Productions, Inc. and Bernard Bailey were named as Plaintiffs (Am. Compl. P13), but these Plaintiffs voluntarily 
discontinued their claims during discovery."
604,4," Three additional booking agencies are named as ""talent agent conspirators"" but are not named as defendants. (Id. P28.)"
604,5," Three additional concert promoters are named as ""concert promoter co-conspirators"" but are not named as defendants. (Id. 
P57.)"
604,6," Plaintiffs have acknowledged that ultimate approval of the selection of a promoter rests with the artists and the artists' 
managers. (Dep. of Mario Gonzalez, dated Feb. 13, 2003 (""Gonzalez Dep.""), in Booking Agency Defs.' J.A. in Supp. of Mots. for "
605,," Summ. J., dated Feb. 28, 2003 (""J.A.""), Vol. IV, at 233 (containing statement by Ms. Sperando, counsel for Plaintiffs, ""agreeing 
that the final approval of a promoter rests with the manager . . . or the artist"").)"
605,7," In Mr. Jones's declaration, dated February 25, 2003, he states that Summitt ""has been in existence since 1986."" (Decl. of Fred 
Jones, dated Feb. 25, 2003 (""Jones Beaver Decl.""), attached as Ex. 1 in Exs. Pls. Resp. in Opp'n to Beaver's Mot. for Summ. J., 
dated Mar. 13, 2003 (""Pls.' Beaver Exs.""), P2.) In Plaintiffs' other papers, however, they cite 1984 as the founding date. (Pls.' 
Am. Joint 56.1 Stmt. P122; Dep. of Fred Jones, dated May 7, 2001 (""Jones Dep.""), in J.A., Vol. IV, at 19.) Accordingly, for the 
purposes of this opinion, the Court will consider 1984 as the correct date. "
606,8," Plaintiffs dispute Beaver 56.1 Stmt. P4 in part, but present no disagreement to this part of the paragraph. (Pls.' Resp. to 
Beaver's ""Undisputed Facts"", dated June 11, 2003 (""Pls.' Resp. Beaver 56.1 Stmt.""), P4.)"
606,9," Beaver uses the term plurality, but if majority is substituted for plurality, then this statement is undisputed. (Id. P6.)"
606,10," Plaintiffs dispute WMA 56.1 Statement P5, citing the affidavit of Richard Johnson, a former WMA employee, to refute WMA's 
assertion that it forwards all bona fide offers to artists or their managers. (Pls.' Am. Local Rule 56.1 Stmt. of Disputed Facts in 
Supp. of Opp'n to WMA's Mot. for Summ. J., dated June 16, 2003 (""Pls.' Am. WMA 56.1 Stmt.""), P4 (citing Aff. of Richard 
Johnson, dated Jan. 19, 2001 (""R. Johnson Aff.""), attached as Ex. 9 in Exs. Pls.' Resp. in Opp'n to WMA's Mot. for Summ. J., 
undated (received May 5, 2003) (""Pls.' Resp. WMA Exs.""), P3).) However, Mr. Johnson was employed in the music division of 
Defendant WMA as a booking agent from 1982 to 1986, twelve years before the filing of this complaint, and has been employed 
in an unrelated economic area ever since. (R. Johnson Aff., Pls.' Resp. WMA Ex. 9, P1.) The cited evidence is insufficient to 
controvert WMA 56.1 Statement P5, and this statement is considered as if undisputed."
606,11," Plaintiffs dispute WMA 56.1 Statement P6. However, the evidence cited by Plaintiffs does not controvert the statement that the 
artists or their managers make the final decision. (Pls.' Am. 56.1 Stmt. P6.) Thus, WMA 56.1 Statement P6 is considered as if 
undisputed. Additionally, Plaintiffs have admitted that this assertion is true. See supra note 6. "
607,12," Plaintiffs assert that Renaissance and Evolution are substantially the same companies. (Pls.' Resp. Renaissance's Stmt. 
Pursuant to Local Rule 56.1, dated June 13, 2003 (""Pls.' Resp. Renaissance 56.1 Stmt.""), PP3-4.)"
607,13," Under the form contracts negotiated by the Defendant Booking Agency Defendants and submitted on these motions, the 
expense amounts are agreed upon and, if they exceed that amount, are born by the promoter. In accounting for the net concert 
revenues, the promoters are required to show that the agreed upon expenses were incurred in promoting the concert. (Report of 
Mario Gonzalez, Esq., undated (""Gonzalez Report""), in J.A., Vol. I, P10(d).) "
608,14," Plaintiffs state that Joint 56.1 Statement P1 is disputed. (Pls.' Am. Joint 56.1 Stmt. P1.) Plaintiffs' reply, however, is 
unresponsive and does not controvert the statement of material fact provided by Booking Agency Defendants, as required by 
Local Rule 56.1(d). Joint 56.1 Statement P1 is considered as if undisputed."
608,15," Plaintiffs dispute this statement, but as their reply is non-responsive (Pls.' Am. Joint 56.1 Stmt. P5), Joint 56.1 Statement P5 is 
considered as if undisputed."
608,16, Plaintiffs' reply is non-responsive (Pls.' Am. Joint 56.1 Stmt. P6); Joint 56.1 Statement P6 is considered as if undisputed.
608,17," Plaintiffs' reply is non-responsive and relies on conclusory remarks included in Mr. Rowe's affidavit and deposition. Plaintiffs 
have submitted no evidence demonstrating that Mr. Rowe is an expert in the concert promotion business and when he speaks "
609,," on matters beyond his personal knowledge, these statements are inadmissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence. See Fed. 
R. Evid. 602 (""A witness may not testify to a matter unless evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that the witness 
has personal knowledge of the matter.""); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e) (""Supporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on 
personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is 
competent to testify to the matters stated therein.""). Accordingly, Joint 56.1 Statement P9 is considered as if undisputed."
609,18, Plaintiffs' reply is non-responsive; Joint 56.1 Statement P10 is considered as if undisputed.
609,19, Plaintiffs' reply is non-responsive; Joint 56.1 Statement P16 is considered as if undisputed.
609,20," Plaintiffs' reply is non-responsive; Joint 56.1 Statement P17 is considered as if undisputed. The Court does not rely on 
Defendants' citation to the Billboard Magazine article, ""Black Promoters Say They're Excluded From Top R&B Gigs."" Under the 
Federal Rules of Evidence, the article is inadmissible hearsay to prove the truth of the statements contained in it."
609,21," Plaintiffs' reply relies on conclusory remarks and statements not based on personal knowledge; Joint 56.1 Statement P18 is 
considered as if undisputed."
609,22, Plaintiffs' reply is non-responsive; Joint 56.1 Statement P19 is considered as if undisputed. 
610,23," Plaintiffs' reply is non-responsive and admits the facts asserted in Defendants' statement; Joint 56.1 Statement P20 is 
considered as if undisputed."
610,24, Plaintiffs' reply is non-responsive; Joint 56.1 Statement P21 is considered as if undisputed.
610,25, Plaintiffs' reply is non-responsive; Joint 56.1 Statement P22 is considered as if undisputed.
610,26," Other promoters testify that they have been aggressive and proactive in seeking out promotion opportunities. (Dep. of 
Brandon Phillips, dated June 19, 2002 (""Phillips Dep.""), in J.A., Vol. V, at 168.)"
610,27, Plaintiffs' reply is non-responsive; Joint 56.1 Statement P23 is considered as if undisputed.
610,28, Plaintiffs' reply is non-responsive; Joint 56.1 Statement P24 is considered as if undisputed.
610,29," To the contrary, Alan Haymon, a successful black promoter, testified that ""there is no barrier to submitting an offer that exists 
in our business"" and that ""it is impossible to my knowledge for anyone to prevent anyone from submitting a bid."" (Haymon Dep., 
McCabe Decl. Ex. 11, at 189, 252.) In general, bids are submitted directly from the promoter to an agency. For this process, ""you 
don't have to have anything other than a telephone and a fax machine."" (Id. at 48-49.) "
611,30, Plaintiffs' reply is non-responsive and cites to inadmissible evidence; Joint 56.1 Statement P25 is considered as if undisputed.
611,31, Plaintiffs' reply is non-responsive and cites to inadmissible evidence; Joint 56.1 Statement P26 is considered as if undisputed.
611,32, Plaintiffs' reply is non-responsive; Joint 56.1 Statement P29 is considered as if undisputed.
611,33," Plaintiffs' reply admits the facts in question and relies on statements not shown to be based on personal knowledge; Joint 56.1 
Statement P30 is considered as if undisputed."
611,34," Plaintiffs' reply admits the facts in question and relies on statements not shown to be based on personal knowledge; Joint 56.1 
Statement P31 is considered as if undisputed."
611,35," Plaintiffs' reply relies on statements not shown to be based on personal knowledge; Joint 56.1 Statement P33 is considered as 
if undisputed."
611,36," Plaintiffs' reply misuses the King deposition, using it for a proposition it does not support. (See Pls.' Am. Joint 56.1 Stmt. P34; 
King Dep., in J.A., Vol. V, at 293 (agreeing that the artist, manager, or the booking agent can make the decision of which concert 
promoter to use).) Joint Statement P34 is considered as if undisputed. Witnesses from non-party booking agencies and artist managers state that the artists and the artists' managers make the 
decision. (Dep. of Phil Casey, dated May 22, 2002 (""Casey Dep.""), in J.A., Vol. III, at 77-78 (stating that the decision about what 
promoter will promote a particular event is made by either the artist or the manager in consultation with the artist, but not by the 
agent); Phillips Dep., in J.A., Vol. V, at 103 (explaining that as manager for Rod Stewart, Mr. Phillips and a partner made the 
final decision on which concert promoters to use); Weisner Dep., in J.A., Vol. VI, at 8, 12, 26-27, 29 (stating that in Mr. Weisner's 
fifteen to seventeen years as a manager for acts such as The Jacksons, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Earth Wind & Fire, Gladys 
Knight & the Pips, Steve Winwood and John Mellencamp, decisions about promoters have always been made by the manager

been planned, it [was] common for both [he] and the artists [he] represented to state preferences for particular concert promoters "
612,," depending upon the local market place for each concert. . . . The final decision as to the acceptance of a particular concert 
promoter's offer [was] made by [him] and the artist."").) Many black promoters agree that the artists and artists' managers make the final decision on the selection of the promoter. (Dep. 
of Lionel Bea, dated Apr. 26, 2002 (""Bea Dep.""), in J.A., Vol. III, at 24 (stating that the manager might discuss promoter selection 
with the artist or the agent, but then the manager and artist make a decision and tell the agent which promoter they want to use); 
Brooks Dep., in J.A., Vol. III, at 43-44 (stating that decisions as to what vendors or promoters to work with are made by the artist 
or the manager); Dep. of Fredrick Luster, dated May 6, 2002 (""Luster Dep.""), in J.A., Vol. V, at 74-75 (stating that managers and 
artists choose whether to use a certain promoter or play a certain market); Dep. of William Sparks, dated Mar. 13, 2002 (""Sparks 
Dep.""), in J.A., Vol. VI, at 129-130 (stating that managers have the final word and are ""absolutely"" the ones who pick the 
promoters and that it's always been that way); Haymon Dep., in J.A., Vol. IV, at 44-45 (agreeing that some artists decide 
themselves who their concert promoters will be, while some artists rely on their manager to be the primary decision-maker).) Some promoters are of the opinion that the booking agent may influence the selection of a concert promoter. (King Dep., in J.A., 
Vol. V, at 293 (stating that in some instances, agents may be a part of the selection process); Dep. of Jesse Boseman, dated 
Aug. 7, 2001 (""Boseman Dep.""), in J.A., Vol. III, at 775-776 (stating that the decision on which promoter to use may be made by 
a ""combination"" of people, including the artist, his or her manager and the agent); Haymon Dep., in J.A., Vol. IV, at 44-45 
(stating that some artists are influenced by their agent or family members).) Non-defendant booking agencies and artists 
acknowledge that the agents' recommendations are often influential. (See Casey Dep., in J.A., Vol. III, at 346 (""On a scale of 1-
to-10, . . . [the influence of the agent's recommendation is] probably in the 7 range.""). Plaintiffs cite Mr. Cosby's deposition on 
page fifty-three, stating he ""testified that his agency, [WMA], selected 90% of his promoters"" (Pls.' Am Joint 56.1 Stmt. P37), but 
the Court could not find this page of Mr. Cosby's deposition in the excerpts submitted to the Court."
612,37, Plaintiffs' reply is non-responsive; Joint 56.1 Statement P41 is considered as if undisputed.

] A claim under section 1 of the Sherman Act must be ""commenced within four years after the cause of action has accrued."" 15 U.S.C.A. 15b. ""In the context of a continuing conspiracy to violate the antitrust laws, . . . each time a plaintiff is 
injured by an act of the defendants a cause of action accrues to him to recover the damages caused by that act and . . . as to 
those damages, the statute of limitations runs from the commission of the act."" Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 
401 U.S. 321, 338, 28 L. Ed. 2d 77, 91 S. Ct. 795 (1971). "
615,39," Plaintiffs also claim that this conspiracy creates a ""negative ripple effect throughout the black community"" because white 
promoters ""rarely retain the services of black-owned businesses servicing concerts."" (Am. Compl. P83.) This allegation is not 
relevant to the determination of whether there is actual injury to competition in the relevant market under § 1. Additionally, 
Plaintiffs have provided no evidence relating to the use of black-owned businesses by white or black concert promoters. "
616,40," Pollstar Magazine is the ""weekly industry periodical reporting concert and tour information."" (Am. Compl. P65.)"
616,41," Defendants' expert, Dr. Williams, however, shows in Exhibit 7 to his expert report that ""acts represented by non-defendant 
booking agencies performed 54 percent of all shows performed [at such venues] during 1993-2000."" (Williams Report, in J.A., 
Vol. I, P31, Ex. 7.) Exhibit 7 shows also that ""major acts represented by non-defendant booking agencies performed 40 percent 
of the shows performed by all major acts during 1993-2000."" (Id.)"
616,42," Most of the Promoter Defendants have been dismissed from the case or were acquired by SFX and, pursuant to agreement 
with Plaintiffs, the claims against them have been dismissed with prejudice. Although the Sherman Act claim against Jam was 
dismissed with prejudice by the Court, Plaintiffs were granted leave to amend the Amended Complaint pursuant to Rule 15(a) of 
the Federal Rules of Procedure, if during discovery they found evidence to support the dismissed claim and could make a 
showing that there was sufficient evidence to proceed with the claim. Rowe Entertainment, Inc. v. William Morris Agency, Inc., 
2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9256, No. 98 Civ. 8272 (RPP), 2000 WL 896929 (S.D.N.Y. June 30, 2000)). Plaintiffs have not sought 
leave to amend the Amended Complaint. However, because Plaintiffs' arguments seem to assume that their antitrust claims 
against Jam are valid, the Court will address the lack of evidence against Jam on Plaintiffs' antitrust claims."
616,43," In the test period, there were 2,460 such concerts of which Plaintiffs claim 1,625 or 65% were concerts promoted or co-
promoted by the originally named promoter defendants or uncharged promoter co-conspirators. (Am. Compl. PP66-67.) 
However, Exhibit 6 of Dr. Williams's expert report shows that ""non-defendant promoters promoted 72 percent of all shows and 
58 percent of shows by major acts during the 1993-2000 period."" (Williams Report, in J.A., Vol. I, P31, Ex. 6.)"
616,44," Additionally, the Pollstar information is apparently incomplete as Mr. Haymon, a major concert promoter, testified he did not 
report his concert results to Pollstar. (Haymon Dep., in J.A., Vol. IV, at 38.)"
616,45," The statistics calculated from the Pollstar data by Plaintiffs' former counsel do not show that Beaver or Jam are dominant in 
the national market. Plaintiffs rely on the data from Pollstar to conclude that in the test period Beaver promoted 72% of the major 
concerts in New Orleans and 81% in Memphis and that Jam promoted 85% of the major concerts in Chicago and 74% in 
Minneapolis. (Pls.' Rev. Jam Mem. Ex. 3 (Dominant Promoter Table); see also Aff. of Christine Lepera, dated Jan. 19, 2001 
(""Lepera Aff.""), in Pls.' Beaver Ex. 10, P6.) "
617,," Additionally, Plaintiffs rely on Mr. Rowe's declaration to assert that Jam has dominated Chicago since the late 1970s or early 
1980s (Aff. of Leonard Rowe, dated Feb. 27, 2003 (""Rowe Jam Aff. I""), Pls. Rev. Jam Ex. 1, P11) and that Beaver has been 
dominant in New Orleans since at least the early 1980s (Decl. of Leonard Rowe, dated Feb. 27, 2003 (""Rowe Beaver Decl.""), 
Pls. Beaver Ex. 6, P9). Mr. Rowe is not an expert, and Plaintiffs have not presented evidence of his particular familiarity with 
these markets. His assertions are not shown to be within the scope of his personal knowledge or supported by other evidence. Because Plaintiffs have not presented any evidence raising an inference of any agreement among these allegedly dominant 
regional promoters and booking agencies, these claims of territorial dominance are irrelevant. Plaintiffs have not brought a 
section 2 claim under the Sherman Antitrust Act against any of the Defendants."
617,46," Defendant Renaissance, formed in 1996, entered the booking agency market with top acts in 1997. (Declaration of David 
Zedeck, dated Feb. 27, 2003 (""Zedeck Decl. I""), P2.) Plaintiffs do not dispute Renaissance's entry with top acts or approximate 
date of entry. Additionally, the expert report of Dr. Darrell Williams contains two other examples of ""successful entrants"" into the 
promotion market, one of which, Magic Johnson Productions, is owned by an African-American. (Williams Report, in J.A., Vol. I, 
P66; see also Decl. of Earvin Johnson, Jr. (Magic Johnson), dated May 27, 2002 (""E. Johnson Decl.""), attached as Ex. 3 to 
McCabe Decl., P4.)"
617,47," In their Joint Memorandum, Plaintiffs cite the expert report of Dr. Gerald Jaynes to support the proposition that promotion 
costs could be 5% if competition existed. (Pls.' Joint Mem. at 14.) Dr. Jaynes's report, however, does not discuss whether 
promotion costs could be lowered. (Expert Report of Dr. Gerald Jaynes, dated July 31, 2002 (""Jaynes Report""), attached as Ex. 
36 to Pls.' Joint Mem. Exs., Vol. II.) The Jaynes Report calculated damages to Plaintiffs from racial discrimination based on data, 
which was found to be unreliable, provided by Plaintiffs. (Id. at 5-7; see also Rowe Entertainment, Inc. v. The William Morris 
Agency, Inc., 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15976, No. 98 Civ. 8272 (RPP), 2003 WL 22124991 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 15, 2003).) Dr. Jaynes 
also testified that he was offering no opinion on the alleged conspiracy's effect on competition. (Dep. of Professor Gerald 
Jaynes, dated Sept. 13, 2002 (""Jaynes Dep.""), in J.A., Vol. IV, at 12, 15-16.) "
618,," Additionally, Defendants have presented the expert report of Dr. Williams to show that the total exclusion of the four plaintiffs 
would not have any impact on competition in the market. (William Report P45 (stating Plaintiffs constituted less than 0.3% of the 
combined market share during 1994 to 2001).)"
618,48," Plaintiffs also allege that as part of the conspiracy, the Promoter Defendants receive more favorable contract terms (Pls.' Joint 
Mem. at 8-9) and that Booking Agency Defendants gave the Plaintiffs inaccurate, misleading, and false information about 
different concerts and tours (id. at 11). These allegations are discussed in the discrimination section. Although the Promoter 
Defendants often receive more favorable terms than those initially offered in contracts on booking agency forms, Defendants' 
have presented evidence supporting their contention that these favorable terms are the result of bargaining between the booking 
agencies and Promoter Defendants. See infra pp. 83-86, 104-07. Additionally, Promoter Defendants do not consistently receive 
these more favorable terms. See infra pp. 83-86, 104-07. This conduct is at least as consistent with permissible competition as 
with an illegal conspiracy and is insufficient standing alone to support an inference of an illegal conspiracy in restraint of trade. 
See Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 588."
618,49," The Amended Complaint also alleges that Beaver, Jam and the Booking Agency Defendants committed specific overt acts in 
furtherance of the conspiracy. (Am. Compl. P87; see also Pls.' Joint Mem. at 4-6, 8-11, 24-26 (alleging overt acts involving an 
exclusive contract at Mud Island and certain concert tours of Janet Jackson, Kenny G, Toni Braxton, Maxwell, Lauryn Hill and 
Erykah Badu).) These specific overt acts are reviewed in the discrimination section. Plaintiffs have provided no evidence to 
support their claims that these alleged acts were in furtherance of any conspiracy in restraint of trade."
618,50," As stated supra p. 27, this extrapolation is not supported by expert testimony and apparently contains incomplete information. "
619,51," Plaintiffs did not depose Mr. Johnson. He is not an expert witness designated pursuant to Rule 26(a)(2) of the Federal Rules 
of Civil Procedure and his affidavit does not comply with the requirements of Rule 56(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure. It is accepted only insofar as the statements contained in it are based on his personal knowledge of actions taken by 
booking agents of WMA from 1982 to 1986. WMA operates out of offices in New York, California, and Tennessee. Mr. Johnson 
does not state which office he was in. "
620,52, Mr. Kapp has also not been designated as an expert pursuant to Rule 26(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
620,53, Plaintiffs have stipulated to dismiss their claims against Bill Graham Presents.
620,54," At oral argument, Plaintiffs asserted that Bill Graham Presents finally booked the Culture Club concert. (Hrg. Tr. 10/17/03 at 
70-71; see also, Pls.' WMA Ex. 181 (Memo from Lee Smith of Bill Graham Presents to Shelly Schultz of WMA, dated Oct. 5, 
1998 (discussing postponement of Culture Club concert)).)"
620,55, Plaintiffs have stipulated to dismiss their claims against Delsener/Slater. 
621,56," For example, Exhibit E to Plaintiffs' Joint Memorandum contains artists' contracts with Beaver (New Orleans) on Defendant 
CCA's form contract for concerts in: (1) Fort Worth and Dallas, Texas (Pace Concerts) (Am. Compl. P51 (stating that Pace 
Concerts is the ""dominant concert promoter is Texas"")); (2) St. Louis (Contemporary Productions) (id. P42 (""Contemporary 
Productions is the predominant concert promoter operating in the region surrounding St. Louis . . . ."")); (3) Worcester, 
Massachusetts, and Portland, Maine (Don Law Productions) (id. P45 (""Don Law Company is the predominant concert promoter 
in the New England region . . . ."")); (4) Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, New York (Delsener-Slater) (id. P43 (""Delsener/Slater 
Enterprises is the predominant concert promotion company operating in the New York City metropolitan area . . . ."")); and (5) 
Atlanta, Georgia (Concert/Southern Promotions) (id. P41 (""Concert/Southern Promotions is concert promoter, operating primarily 
in the Southeastern United States . . . ."")). Also Exhibit 12 to Plaintiffs' Joint is an artist contract with Beaver Productions on a 
WMA contract form for a concert in St. Louis, Missouri (Contemporary Productions) (id. P42). Furthermore, Exhibit 9 of Plaintiffs' 
Hearing Exhibits contains an artist contract with Beaver on CAA's contract form for a concert in Houston, Texas (Pace) (id. P51). Also, Mr. Kapp testified that to his knowledge Jam Productions promoted concerts in San Francisco (Bill Graham Enterprises) 
(id. P31 (""Bill Graham Enterprises is the predominant concert promoter in the San Francisco Bay/Northern California area."")), 
Philadelphia (Electric Factory) (id. at P46 (stating that Electric Factory ""is the predominant concert promoter in Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania."")) and Boston (Don Law) (id. P45). (Kapp Dep., Pls.' CAA Dep. Tr., Vol. I, at 238-41) Mr. Leff testified that Beaver 
promoted concerts in Memphis, Mid-South Concerts' territory, prior to 1998. (Leff Dep., Pls.' Beaver Ex. 4, at 56.) Exhibit A to the 
affidavit of Don Fox, dated March 13, 2003 (""Fox Aff.""), (which is attached as Exhibit 2 to Beaver's Reply Memorandum.) shows 
that alleged dominant promoters Pace Concerts (Texas), Contemporary Productions (St. Louis), and Cellar Door promoted 
concerts in New Orleans, Lakefront Arena, Beaver's area. (See also Beaver's Reply Mem. in Support of Mot. for Summ. J., 
dated Mar. 13, 2003 (""Beaver Reply Mem.""), at 9.) In view of these examples, the Court will not set forth all the other contracts 
Plaintiffs offered as exhibits on this motion which are additional evidence of no horizontal conspiracy to divide markets between 
the Promoter Defendants."
621,57," There is evidence that WMA and CAA have contacted ""dominant promoters,"" as much as a year in advance, asking them to 
hold venues on specific dates for artists whose tours they are planning. (Pls.' Hrg. Ex. 8.) These venue holds are obviously 
competitive attempts to preempt other booking agencies, and promoters in contact with them, from putting holds on the desired 
venue on the same date for other artists, and are not supportive of the Plaintiffs' antitrust claims as they reflect competition 
among booking agencies. Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 588 HN15[
] (""Conduct as consistent with permissible competition as with 
illegal conspiracy does not, standing alone, support an inference of antitrust conspiracy."") These venue holds are not proof of the 
Plaintiffs' claim of a horizontal conspiracy among the concert Promoter Defendants to divide the U.S. market or evidence from 
which a reasonable jury could find that the Booking Agency Defendants are members of a conspiracy with all the concert 
Promoter Defendants to exclude Plaintiffs from the concert promotion business throughout the United States or to restrain 
competition in that market. "
622,58," Plaintiffs' allegation assumes that the Booking Agency Defendants not only have the ability to make, but also to keep these 
""assurances"" to Promoter Defendants. The record is clear and unambiguous that the artist or the artist's manager enters into a 
contract with the concert promoter for a concert at a specified venue, generally for a guaranteed amount and an artist/promoter 
split of gross revenues after deducting specified expenses. The booking agency is not a party to the contract, although the 
contract is generally on the booking agency's form. Accordingly, a contract's terms are not determinative of the terms of any 
agreement between the promoters and the booking agency. Booking agencies are only agents of the artists. The booking 
agency, on instructions from the artist or the artist's manager, arranges the routing of an artist's tour and the venue of each 
appearance and may state on behalf of the artist the terms of the concert contract with the promoters. "
623,59," In his declaration dated February 27, 2003, Mr. Rowe cites the above exhibits as evidence supporting the Plaintiffs' conspiracy 
theory. (Rowe Beaver Decl. P7.) Mr. Rowe states that his credentials are that he has worked as a concert promoter in the United 
States for twenty-eight years and has been president of the Black Promoters Association for eight years. (Id. P3.) While that 
experience might give him some knowledge about the activities of a concert promoter, the overwhelming weight of the evidence "
624,," is that he has not been active as a concert promoter since the 1970s. His experience, in any event, is insufficient to permit the 
conclusion that these contracts raise an inference of an agreement between the booking agencies and the promoters regarding 
as rewards for promoting certain artists."
624,60," Mr. Richard Johnson's affidavit is insufficient to demonstrate any action of the booking agencies that would be against their 
economic interests since his testimony at most relates to a business practice by WMA from 1982 to 1986."
624,61, See supra note 47. 
625,62," HN18[

626,63," HN25[
] To establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination in the employment context under Title VII, the plaintiff must 
prove by a preponderance of the evidence: (i) that he belongs to a racial minority; (ii) that he applied and was qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking 
applicants; (iii) that, despite his qualifications, he was rejected; and (iv) that, after his rejection, the position remained open 
and the employer continued to seek applicants from persons of complainant's qualifications. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. However, ""this standard is not inflexible, as 'the facts necessarily will vary in Title VII cases, and the specification above of the 
prima facie proof required from [plaintiff] is not necessarily applicable in every respect in differing factual situations.'"" Burdine, 
450 U.S. at 254 n.6 (quoting McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802 n.13). The second element in the employment promotion context generally requires that a plaintiff show that he or she applied for a 
specific position or positions and was rejected, rather than generally requested promotion. Petrosino v. Bell Atlantic, 385 F.3d 
210, 227 (2d Cir. 2004) (citing Brown v. Coach Stores, Inc., 163 F.3d 706, 710 (2d Cir. 1998)). To be excused from the specific 
application requirement, an employee must demonstrate ""that (1) the vacancy at issue was not posted, and (2) the employee 
either had (a) no knowledge of the vacancy before it was filled or (b) attempted to apply for it through informal procedures 
endorsed by the employer."" Id. "
627,64, Plaintiffs' reply is non-responsive; Joint 56.1 Statement P54 is considered as if undisputed.
627,65," Plaintiffs' reply is non-responsive; Joint 56.1 Statement P60 is considered as if undisputed. Mr. Rowe produced no concert 
files prior to 1997. (Rowe Dep., in J.A., Vol. VI, at 838.) Mr. Rowe testified that the files of any concerts he did with Mr. Haymon 
from 1984 to 1997 were retained by Mr. Haymon, and before 1984, his concert files were mistakenly thrown away. (Id.)"
627,66," Mr. Rowe submitted an offer to CAA for the Janet Jackson tour in 29 cities in 1998. (Joint 56.1 Stmt. P59; Rowe Dep., in J.A., 
Vol. VI, at 134-35.) Mr. Rowe also submitted an offer to WMA for certain markets on the 1998 Maxwell tour. (Letter from Mr. 
Rowe to Jeff Frasco of WMA, dated July 20, 1998 (""Rowe 1998 Maxwell Offer""), Pls.' Rev. Jam Mem. Ex. 1A, at 1) Mr. Rowe's 
letter did not include venues, dates, artist's split or other key terms for a specific concert that would allow an artist or an artist's 
manager to compare his offer to other promoters' offers for these cities. However, it will be considered, as WMA acknowledges, 
an offer for the 1998 Maxwell tour. (Mem. of Law in Supp. of WMA's Mot. for Summ. J., dated Feb. 28, 2003 (""WMA Mem.""), at 8 
n.5.) Plaintiffs cite to Mr. Rowe's testimony that he had submitted a written bid for concerts by Lauryn Hill. (Pls.' Am. Joint 56.1 
Stmt. P59 (citing Rowe Dep., in J.A., Vol. VI, at 1172-74).) Plaintiffs did not supply the Court with a copy of Mr. Rowe's Lauryn 
Hill bid. The testimony suggests it was only an expression of interest. (Rowe Dep., in J.A., Vol. VI, at 1174.)"
627,67, Plaintiffs' reply is non-responsive and admits the facts in question; Joint Statement P61 is considered as if undisputed.
627,68, Plaintiffs' reply is non-responsive and admits the facts in question; Joint Statement P63 is considered as if undisputed. 
628,69, Co-promoters generally do not conduct the financial negotiations for a concert.
628,70," Mr. Rowe testified that Mr. Haymon takes financial responsibility for the tours, but that he would ""sometimes put up the 
expense for"" the advertising he undertook. (Rowe Dep., in J.A., Vol. VI, at 697.)"
628,71," Plaintiffs dispute this statement, asserting that ""Mr. Rowe testified he promoted many live music performances outside of the 
state of Georgia."" (Pls.' Am. Joint 56.1 Stmt. P55.) Plaintiffs, however, cite only to the same deposition testimony of Mr. Rowe as 
cited in Joint 56.1 Statement P55, in which the only concerts Mr. Rowe mentions specifically are concerts on: (1) the Kenny 
G/Toni Braxton tour, which he asserts he ""sharecropped,"" did no work, and was paid for his silence (Rowe Jam Aff. I, Pls.' Rev. 
Jam Mem. Ex. 1, P22); (2) a Sugar Daddy tour, a gospel (non-contemporary) music tour; and (3) the Puff Daddy tour (no further 
explanation provided). (Rowe Dep., in J.A., Vol. VI, at 202-03). As Plaintiffs have failed to provide citation to evidence 
controverting Joint 56.1 Statement P55, that paragraph is considered as if undisputed."
628,72," Plaintiffs state that Joint Statement P56 is disputed, citing to Mr. Rowe's promotion of the ""Sugar Daddy national tour."" (Pls.' 
Am. Joint 56.1 Stmt. P56.) Sugar Daddy, however, was a ""gospel musical play"" (Rowe Dep., in J.A., Vol. VI, at 336), not a 
concert performance of contemporary music within the scope of the Amended Complaint in this litigation. As Plaintiffs' reply is 
non-responsive, Joint Statement P56 is considered as if undisputed."
628,73," In this period, Mr. Rowe has only once been made responsible for part of the artist's guarantee. (Id. at 295.) During the 1998 
Janet Jackson Tour, promoted by Magicworks, $ 100,000 of the monies due Mr. Rowe from concert ticket sales as a co-
promoter were held as a deposit until after the show. (Id.)"
628,74, Plaintiffs' reply is non-responsive and admits the facts in question; Joint Statement P68 is considered as if undisputed. 
629,75," But see infra note 115. In 1997, Mr. Rowe obtained a contract for a portion of concert promotion for concerts on the Toni 
Braxton tour, but he did not perform any services. (Rowe Jam Aff. I, Pls. Rev. Jam Ex. 1, P22.)"

56.1 Stmt. P186.) Joint 56.1 Statement P186 is considered as if undisputed. "
633,97," Defendant Jam asserts that Plaintiffs have provided no evidence that they have ""ever submitted a bid in competition with 
Jam."" (Jam 56.1 Stmt. P42.) In response, Plaintiffs assert that Mr. Rowe submitted a bid on the 1998 Maxwell tour in competition 
with Jam. (Pls.' Counter Jam 56.1 Stmt. P42.) However, as stated infra note 146, Mr. Rowe's letter to WMA did not contain the 
particulars to be a concert bid and is considered an offer for the Maxwell tour in 1998. The 1998 tour was cancelled. Plaintiffs 
also assert that Mr. Boseman submitted a bid for a Kenny G/Braxton concert in competition with Jam. (Id.) However, as stated 
infra pp. 76-78, the evidence shows that Mr. Boseman and Mr. Rowe only discussed the possibility of promoting this concert 
after the concert had been awarded to Jam. No party testified or presented any document about such a bid. Plaintiffs also make 
reference to a concert by Seal, but provide no evidence that any bid was even submitted, let alone in competition with Jam. (Id.) 
Plaintiffs present no evidence showing that Plaintiff King submitted a bid in competition against Jam. (Id.) Defendant Beaver asserts that Plaintiffs have never submitted a bid in competition with Beaver. (Beaver 56.1 Stmt. P14 (citing 
Fox Decl., Beaver Ex. 1, P7).) Plaintiffs' reply is unresponsive and claims that Beaver submits no bids. (Pls.' Resp. Beaver 56.1 
Stmt. P14.) The latter assertion is refuted infra p. 62. Plaintiffs have also provided no evidence that they submitted bids for concerts to the Booking Agency Defendants, aside from 
two tour offers for Maxwell and Janet Jackson by Mr. Rowe, prior to the bringing of this lawsuit. (See Rowe Dep., in J.A. Vol. VI, 
at 138-39; Boseman Dep., in J.A., Vol. III, at 465-66; King Dep., in J.A., Vol. V, at 175, 217-18, 813-15, 1065-66; Jones Dep., in 
J.A., Vol. IV, at 208-13.)"
633,98," Plaintiffs argue also that ""by the time black promoters, including the Plaintiffs, find out about the fact that a white artist or 
superstar black artist is touring, the dates have been sold to white promoters,"" there is no opportunity to bid. (Decl. of Leonard "
634,," Rowe, dated Feb. 27, 2003, attached as Ex. 6 to Pls.' Joint Mem. Exs., Vol. I, P18.) However, promoters may learn of an 
opportunity to promote by calling booking agents, or artists' managers. (Joint Stmt. 56.1 PP20-21.)"
634,99, Plaintiffs' reply is non-responsive; Joint 56.1 Statement P201 is considered as if undisputed.
634,100," Plaintiffs also assert that ""the facts when taken as a whole demonstrate that Beaver in fact prevented the Plaintiffs and other 
black promoters from submitting a bid to promote or co-promote concerts."" (Pls' Resp. Beaver 56.1 Stmt. P18 (emphasis 
added).) Plaintiffs do not provide any evidentiary support to show that any defendant, including Beaver or Jam, has taken any 
action to prevent them from submitting a bid to promote a concert."
634,101," The record shows that Plaintiffs' former counsel (along with other attorneys and paralegals), Mr. Rowe and Mr. King 
examined the files. (See Decl. of Laura L. Mall, Esq., dated Apr. 22, 2003, attached as Ex. 7 to Pls.' Resp. Mem. in Opp'n to 
Defs.' Mot. to Exclude Pls.' Expert Witness Dr. Gerald D. Jaynes's Affidavit, dated Apr. 24, 2003, PP9-10.) There is no showing 
that Mr. Rowe examined all files. This statement that Defendant Promoters are not required to submit written bids is conclusory. 
Nor have Plaintiffs requested any Defendant to admit Mr. Rowe's conclusion. "
636,102," The Black Promoters Association (""BPA"") is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of Georgia, with its offices 
located in Atlanta, Georgia. (Am. Compl. P17.) BPA is a ""trade association of black concert promoters"" organized ""to promote 
the interests of black concert promoters, to open the industry to free competition, and to eliminate racial discrimination."" (Id.) 
BPA was formed sometime between 1995 and 1997 by Plaintiffs Rowe, King and Boseman. (Joint 56.1 Stmt. P239.) The BPA 
operates out of Mr. Rowe's office and has no independent funding. (Id. P240.) There are seven members of the BPA, including 
Plaintiffs Rowe, Boseman and King. (Id. P241.) Al Haymon is a member but has attended only one BPA meeting since 
becoming a member. (Id.) Plaintiff Jones, non-party Larry Bailey and non-party Bill Washington were all members of the BPA for 
a period before they resigned. (Id. PP247-49; L. Bailey Dep., in J.A., Vol. III, at 44, 48-49; Washington Dep., in J.A., Vol. VI, at 
212.) In the period from 1995 to 2001, there were 50 black concert promoters in the United States. (Expert Report of Ali Saad, 
dated May, 21, 2003 (""Saad Report""), in J.A., Vol. I, at 5.) "
637,103, WMA admits that this letter was an offer for the 1998 Maxwell tour by Mr. Rowe. See infra note 146.
637,104," Mr. Rowe's counter-affidavit, dated February 27, 2003 (Rowe Jam Aff. I, Pls.' Rev. Jam Mem. Ex. 1), is misleading. In it, Mr. 
Rowe states that Magic Johnson's ""insertion as a co-promoter occurred only after I had made threats of going public regarding 
race discrimination in the concert industry and only after I had filed the instant lawsuit."" (Id. P16 (emphasis in original).) This 
lawsuit was filed on November 19, 1998. Mr. Rowe's ""threat of going public"" was contained in a letter to Randy Hoffman, 
Maxwell's manager, dated September 3, 1998. (Letter from Leonard Rowe, as President of the BPA, to Randy Hoffman, dated 
Sept. 3, 1998 (""Maxwell Letter from BPA to Mr. Hoffman""), attached as Ex. 1G to Pls.' Rev. Jam Mem. Exs.) Mr. Rowe, however, 
clearly knew that MJP had been ""assigned exclusive rights to promote the upcoming Maxwell tour"" before August 24, 1998, 
because on that date he wrote a letter to Mr. Johnson congratulating him on this assignment. (Letter from Leonard Rowe, as 
President of the BPA, to Irvin ""Magic"" Johnson, dated Aug. 24, 1998 (""Maxwell Letter from BPA to Mr. E. Johnson""), attached as 
Ex. 1F to Pls.' Rev. Jam Mem. Exs., at 1.) Additionally, Exhibit E attached to Mr. Rowe's counter-affidavit, the Maxwell Letter from WMA to MJP as of September 1, 1998 
shows that a formal retention of Mr. Johnson for the Maxwell tour occurred on or about that date. (Pls.' Rev. Jam Mem. Ex. 1E.) 
Exhibit A to that affidavit includes a WMA tour schedule for the 1998 Maxwell tour, which shows that ""Magic"" as well as certain 
local promoters had been scheduled for a 1998 tour by WMA by August 5, 1998, some three months before the lawsuit was filed 
and four weeks before Mr. Rowe's letter dated September 3, 1998 containing a ""threat of going public."" (WMA Tour Schedule for 
the 1998 Maxwell Tour, dated Aug. 8, 1998, Pls.' Rev. Jam. Mem. Ex. 1A.) Exhibit B to Mr. Rowe's counter affidavit, a WMA 
Maxwell tour schedule dated August 18, 1998, also lists MJE as a promoter for virtually every venue. (WMA Tour Schedule for 
1998 Maxwell Tour, dated Aug. 18, 1998, Pls.' Rev. Jam Mem. Ex. 1B.)"
637,105," Plaintiffs' Counter Jam 56.1 Statement P42 misidentifies Exhibit 16 (which is the same as Pls.' Rev. Mem. Ex. 1A) as ""WMA 
statement of 8/5/99 listing bids on the 1999 Maxwell Tour"" as dated August 5, 1999 when, in fact, it is dated 8/5/98 and lists bids 
for the 1998 tour. "
638,106, Plaintiffs present only argument to the contrary.
638,107," Plaintiff Fred Jones had been scheduled as a promoter in Dallas/New Orleans on WMA's September 11, 1998 schedule for 
the Maxwell 1998 tour. (Pls.' Rev. Jam Mem. Ex. 1C at 2.) "
639,108," See also Berman v. Parco, 986 F. Supp. 195, 200 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) HN27[
] (""Simple hope that a jury will not believe the 
testimony of defendants that has been submitted in support of a summary judgment motion will not defeat the motion where 
there has been no affirmative evidence submitted to counter the defendants' evidence."") (citing Goldhirsh Group, Inc. v. Alpert, 
107 F.3d 105, 109 (2d Cir. 1997) (""If all of the witnesses deny that an event essential to the plaintiff's case occurred, the plaintiff 
cannot get to the jury simply because the jury might disbelieve these denials. There must be some affirmative evidence that the 
event occurred."") (citations and quotations omitted))."
639,109," As stated earlier, Mr. Rowe's letter of July 20, 1998 does not make a bid for a concert, but is considered as a bid for the tour 
of seven or more cities. "
640,110," In his deposition on August 14, 2001, Mr. Rowe placed the time of the call in October or November 1996. (Rowe Dep., in J.A., 
Vol. VI, at 1384.)"
640,111," In his deposition, Mr. Rowe states he called Mr. Piranian because he had received phone calls from black promoters saying 
that they had been excluded from the Kenny G/Braxton tour and he was calling on their behalf. (Rowe Dep., in J.A., Vol. VI, at 
1377.) He states that the black promoters were not invited to bid or able to participate in the bidding process. (Id. at 1379.) 
However, Mr. Rowe contradicts his claim of no opportunity to bid in this same deposition when he states that after his initial 
conversation with Mr. Piranian, he spoke with Mr. Haymon about the quoted prices, and they did not discuss making a 
counteroffer because ""that's what the promoter was paying."" (Id. at 1384.) In his affidavit, dated April 24, 2003, submitted in Opposition to Defendant CAA's Motion for Summary Judgment, Mr. Rowe also 
contradicts his deposition testimony that black promoters were not invited to bid or able to participate in the bidding process. He 
states: "
641,," In 1996, Al Haymon called me and told me that Kenny G and Toni Braxton were going to tour in 1997. Mr. Haymon told me 
that the guarantee was about $ 250,000 to $ 275,000 depending on the city, and that it was his opinion that the guarantee 
was too high. I then called Mike Piranian, the responsible CAA agent for the tour, to discuss the possibility of involvement in 
the tour. (Rowe CAA Aff., Pls.' CAA Ex. 1, P215.)"
641,112," According to his deposition testimony, Mr. Rowe learned that the Kenny G/Braxton dates were selling for much less than the 
$ 225,000 to $ 275,000 Mr. Piranian originally quoted him after he had spoken with Mr. Piranian for the first time and spoke with 
Mr. Haymon about those terms, but before threatening to protest. (Rowe Dep., in J.A., Vol. VI, at 1386.) Thus, he did not learn of 
the ""minimum guarantees of between $ 150,000 to $ 175,000 after his protest or after Jam allowed him to partner on the Kenny 
G/Toni Braxton shows. Mr. Rowe's deposition is the evidence with conclusory effect on points of difference. Bickerstaff, 196 F.3d 
at 455."
641,113," Corroborating these early terms, CAA presents contracts showing that on August 16, 1996, Radio City Music had agreed to 
promote six Kenny G/Braxton concerts for a per show guarantee of $ 280,000, revised by Dennis Turner, Kenny G's manager, in 
January 1997 to $ 232,597 per show. (Decl. of Robert Light, dated May 20, 2003 (""Light Decl. II""), Exs. 1-4.) On October 25, 
1996, Nederlander Theatres agreed to a minimum artist guarantee of $ 225,000 and a 90/10 artist split for the auditorium in 
Anaheim, California. (Light Decl. I Ex. 5.)"
641,114," As stated supra p. 73, Mr. Rowe's and Mr. Boseman's claims of having promoted Toni Braxton previously were based on 
having been employed in Mr. Haymon's promotion of Toni Braxton. "
643,115," Although Mr. Rowe states he ""was permitted to sharecrop"" and did nothing to promote the Chicago Kenny G/Braxton show 
(Rowe Jam Aff. I, Pls.' Rev. Jam Mem. Ex. 1, P22), Mr. Boseman testified that he also shared in the co-promotion fee and that 
he did make several calls to Chicago radio stations on behalf of the Braxton concert (Boseman Dep., McCabe Decl. Ex. 8, at 
1015). Plaintiffs received 1/3 of the promoter's profits on both shows promoted by Jam. (Rowe Dep., McCabe Decl. Ex. 6, at 
767.)"
643,116," Although Plaintiffs state that a court may draw an inference of pretext from more general comparative evidence, citing Sweat 
v. Miller Brewing Co., 708 F.2d 655, 658 (11th Cir. 1983) and Furnco Construction Corp. v. Waters, 438 U.S. 567, 580, 57 L. Ed. 
2d 957, 98 S. Ct. 2943 (1978), those cases relate to the hiring of a workforce required to perform a service, not a situation where 
the promoter already has the work force necessary to provide the service and only enters into co-promotion contracts, which 
reduce its profit, in order to avail itself of knowledge or expertise which it does not possess to promote a particular concert."
643,117," In their brief, Plaintiffs state that ""Jam has co-promoted every black act it has ever done with black promoters,"" (Pls.' Rev. 
Jam Mem. at 6 (citing Dep. of Jerry Mickelson, undated (""Mickelson Dep.""), Pls.' Rev. Jam Mem. Ex. 9, at 111) but then, only a 
page later in their brief, inconsistently state that ""Jam's refusal to co-promote black acts with black promoters except under "
644,," threat of public outcry (one of many statements not supported by the evidence) is evidence of Jam's intent to discriminate 
against the Plaintiffs"" (id. at 7)."
644,118," A co-promoter's familiarity with a particular genre of music, e.g., R&B, hip hop, or pop can lead to an agreement to co-
promote. (Joint 56.1 Stmt. P41.)"
644,119," Paragraph 5 does not relate to the claim made by Plaintiffs here. Paragraph 3, however, relates to the claimed 
competiveness of the market."
644,120," Plaintiffs also assert that the evidence shows the Booking Agency Defendants and the Promoter Defendants have conspired 
to exclude black promoters from the Promoter Defendants geographically assigned territories. (Pls.' Counter Jam 56.1 Stmt. P44 
(citing R. Johnson Aff., Pls.' Counter Jam. Ex. 15, PP3, 5).) As stated supra p. 32 in the antitrust section, this affidavit does not 
support the allegation of territorial allocation or a conspiracy to exclude by the Promoter Defendants. "
645,121," Plaintiffs have submitted no evidence demonstrating that Mr. Rowe is an expert in the concert promotion business, and when 
he speaks on matters, such as the industry standard, Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that he has sufficient qualifications to 
state these conclusions. These statements are inadmissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence. See Fed. R. Evid. 602"
645,122," In paragraph 87(f) of the Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs claim that in regards to the 1997 Kenny G/Braxton concert, ""No white 
promoter, including any of the promoter defendants promoting this tour, was required to submit a deposit of any more than 0-
10% of the $ 150,000-1575,000 guarantee."" CAA has submitted copies of contracts, however, which show that the promoters, 
including JAM, agreed to pay a deposit of 50% of the guarantee. (Armand Decl., Light Decl. II, Ex. A.) "
646,123," Also, this contract form is only signed by Jam, not the artist Lauryn Hill, and therefore, does not reflect the final terms."
646,124," Among the contracts in Exhibit 15, the Court finds a contract on a CAA form between Wonder Production (Stevie Wonder) 
and Haymon Entertainment/Jam Productions, Ltd., dated December 15, 1994, requiring each promoter to pay a 25% deposit. 
Stevie Wonder is a major black artist. "
647,125," Plaintiffs also repeat the claim that Jam dominates the Chicago market and is awarded contracts automatically, and thus, a 
jury could conclude that Jam knew of the conspiracy. As stated supra pp. 83-86, there is no evidence of Jam's dominance or 
Jam's being automatically awarded contracts. Nor do Plaintiffs offer any evidence that Jam knew that it was automatically 
awarded contracts or that the contracts were awarded free from competition. Also, Plaintiffs do not cite to evidence explaining 
how the awarding of contracts to Jam by the booking agencies would give Jam knowledge of a conspiracy to exclude Plaintiffs 
due to their race. "
648,126," As alleged in paragraph 87(f) of the Amended Complaint, Kenny G is a white artist. "
649,127," The 1996 contracts for the Kenny G concerts between the concert promoters and Turner Management provided that Kenny G 
would provide the services of Toni Braxton and that she would receive 34% of the net revenues. (Light Decl. II, Ex. 6.) (The 
Court could not find Beaver's contract with Turner Management.) Ms. Braxton's manager testified that Ms. Braxton saved the 
expense of her agent (WMA) by allowing Kenny G, his manager and CAA to negotiate the concerts for her. (Phillips Dep., in Pls. 
CAA Dep. Tr., Vol. II, at 33-34.)"
649,128," Mr. Rowe's affidavit, dated April 21, 2003, also confirms that he learned about the lower guarantees on the 1997 Kenny 
G/Toni Braxton tour after it ""had been sold to the dominant white promoters."" (Rowe Jam Aff. II, Pls.' Counter Jam 56.1 Stmt., 
P29; but see supra pp. 76-78.) "
650,129," Additionally, Plaintiffs have not submitted any evidence showing that they submitted a bid to co-promote this concert."
650,130," QBQ is a former Booking Agency Defendant, against whom Plaintiffs have dismissed their claims."
650,131," Mr. Rowe's testimony about Mr. Arfa's statement is hearsay. Since Plaintiffs offer no testimony that Don Fox said he would 
not allow Mr. Rowe, or any other black promoter, to co-promote Vandross, Mr. Rowe's testimony must be disregarded."
650,132," Again, Plaintiffs fail to present evidence showing they submitted bids to promote or co-promote on the Luther Vandross 
concert. Although Plaintiffs assert that they did not submit bids because of the futility of this action, Plaintiffs have failed to 
present evidence supporting this theory. "
652,133," Copies of the letter indicate that copies were sent to CAA and WMA but not to Renaissance. (Pls.' Beaver Ex. 1A, 1B 
(documents P00719, P007196, P007197, POO7201, POO720, P007194, and P007195).) Copies were also sent to the media. 
(Id. (document P00720).) "
653,134," This letter from Mr. Schultz to Ms. Green is also dated three days prior to: (1) Mr. Jones's press release about his Mud Island 
exclusive to booking agencies and the media; (2) Mr. Leff's letter to Mr. Boyer, urging the Memphis Board not to grant an 
exclusive contract at Mud Island; and (3) the Board of the Memphis Park Commission's approval of the Summitt agreement."
653,135," The Leff letter of April 20, 1998, also mentions Beaver's hiring of Susan Green the previous Friday, which was April 17, 1998. "
654,136," Mr. Leff testified he wrote Mr. Boyer without prompting by anyone (Leff Dep., Pls.' Beaver Ex. 4, at 12-13) and that his 
statement about the top talent agencies requesting Beaver to open a Memphis office was misworded (id. at 20). He testified he 
wrote this at an emotional time, after Bob Kelley's suicide, and he should have written ""many people."" (Id. at 20-22.)"
654,137," Plaintiffs again cite the article ""Black Promoters Say They're Excluded From Top R&B Gigs"" from the June 21, 1997 issue of 
Billboard Magazine (Pls.' Beaver Ex. 6K) as evidence to show that Beaver was aware of discrimination against black promoters. 
(Pls.' Resp. Beaver 56.1 Stmt. P19) As with this claim against Jam, discussed supra p. 87, this article provides no basis for an 
inference of Beaver's knowledge of a conspiracy to exclude black promoters. As in the Jam section, even if the article provided 
notice of a conspiracy in violation of § 1985, the evidence presented does not show that Beaver had any knowledge of that white 
promoters were members of a conspiracy to discriminate against black promoters. Thus, this claim must fail. See Buck, 536 F.2d 
at 524 (holding that defendants' knowledge of allegedly discriminatory acts is a prerequisite to suit under § 1986)."
654,138," Although Plaintiffs assert that ""Fox has never involved any black promoter as a co-promoter when a white artist was the 
featured act,"" (Pls.' Resp. Beaver Mem. at 11), Fox has co-promoted black artists with Al Haymon, an African-American 
promoter, and has co-promoted Kenny G, a white artist, with Larry Bailey, also African-American, in nineteen separate concerts 
(Fox Beaver Decl., Beaver Ex. 1, PP14-15; Beaver 56.1 Stmt. P11). Plaintiffs claim that the only reason Larry Bailey was 
involved in co-promoting Kenny G with Beaver was Mr. Bailey's long standing friendship with Kenny G and base this claim on 
paragraph 29 of Mr. Rowe's declaration. (Pls.' Resp. Beaver 56.1 Stmt. P11 (citing Rowe Beaver Decl., Pls.' Beaver Ex. 6, P29.) 
Mr. Rowe provides no evidentiary basis for this conclusion, which is beyond the scope of his personal knowledge and therefore 
inadmissible. "
655,139," Plaintiffs allege that Beaver has not produced any bids, citing paragraph 26 of Rowe's declaration. (Pls.' Resp. Beaver Mem. 
at 19.) In his affidavit, dated March 13, 2003, Steven Mark Grishman, the Chief Financial Officer for Beaver, stated that ""every 
individual concert file in the possession of Beaver Productions, Inc., without exception, contains a bid sheet."" (Grishman Aff., 
attached as Ex. 1 to Beaver Reply Mem., P6 (emphasis in original).) Mr. Grishman also stated that he ""personally reviewed . . . 
[the] documents that were produced to the plaintiffs, and contained therein were ninety-seven (97) separate and distinct bid 
sheets, for different shows"" and then listed the specific numbers of these sheets. (Id. P8.) Beaver presented these bid sheets at 
the hearing. (Court Ex. A.)"
655,140," In Plaintiffs' Memorandum, they support these allegations by citing to paragraphs 3 and 5 of Mr. R. Johnson's affidavit and the 
Pollstar data. (Pls.' Resp. Beaver Mem. at 20-21.) As stated supra p. 32 in the antitrust and Jam section, this information does 
not support Plaintiffs' claim that Beaver, or any Promoter Defendant, has territorial dominance. Nor does it support the existence 
of a conspiracy among defendants to exclude black promoters. Plaintiffs also misleadingly cite testimony by Brad Wavra, vice president of Clear Channel Touring's music division, stating that 
""there is a predominant promoter in every market, one that does the majority of dates"" (citing Dep. of Brad Wavra, dated Feb. 
28, 2002 (""Wavra Dep.""), attached as Ex. 11 in Pls.' Beaver Exs., at 56, 84) and that ""'primarily concert promoters were 
regionally oriented, and . . . their primary interest was just playing specific acts in their regions, and that seemed to be how the 
business was primarily structured'"" [quoting id. at 56]. (Pls. Resp. Beaver Mem. at 21 (emphasis added).) However, Mr. Wavra 
testified that there is a ""predominant promoter in many markets"" and that that this came about based on performance and how a 
promoter built relationships, not a conspiracy to exclude black promoters. (Wavra Dep., Pls.' Beaver Ex. 11, at 84.) Mr. Wavra 
also does not list Jam or Beaver as a predominant promoter in his testimony. (Id. at 56.) Plaintiffs cite other testimony by Brad Wavra as support for the alleged conspiracy, specifically that there is a ""concert promoting 
fraternity,"" which included Mr. Fox, and that Mr. Wavra did not initially include any black promoters as members of the fraternity. 
(Pls.' Resp. Beaver Mem. at 23 (citing Wavra Dep., Pls.' Beaver Ex. 11, at 39-40.) Mr. Wavra, however, testified that he was 
using the term fraternity ""loosely,"" that if a person was ""in the music business then they would be part of that fraternity"" and that 
the fraternity included black promoter Al Haymon. (Wavra Dep., in Joint Reply Appendix Filed in Further Supp. of Booking 
Agency Defs.' Mot. for Summ. J., undated (received May 29, 2003) (""J. Reply A.""), at 42-43.) Plaintiffs also cite the testimony of Mr. Alex Cooley as support for the alleged conspiracy, specifically that ""(a) there is a 'good 
ole boy network . . . and yes, racism very well in some cases could raise its head in there,' (b) he knows of no black promoters 
who are a part of the good ole boy network, and (c) racism plays a part in the concert promotion industry today with regard to 
black promoters not promoting white acts."" (Pls. Resp. Beaver Mem. at 23 (quoting and citing Dep. of Alex Cooley, dated Mar. 
20, 2003 (""Cooley Dep.""), attached as Ex. 12 to Pls.' Beaver Exs., at 96-97, 105.) Mr. Cooley, however, also testified that racism 
was not ""an overriding pervasive major thing in the industry"" (Cooley Dep., in J. Reply A., at 96), that ""the business has changed 
so drastically that [race] is not much of a factor"" (id. at 98), that the ""good ole boy network"" was ""not a conspiracy kind of a thing"" 
(id. at 101), and that the ""good ole boy network"" consists of ""friendships and business working relationships"" (id. at 104)."
655,141," For example, a contract (without a signature line for Beaver) on a WMA form for the artist Protein to perform as a special 
guest at Howlin' Wolf in New Orleans on April 15, 1997, for $ 100 flat guarantee with no deposit (Pls.' Beaver Ex. 6A) and a 1999 
contract (with Beaver) with Celine Dion on a CAA form with a deposit of 10% of artists' guarantee and a 92.5% artist split of 
gross receipts after deduction of expenses. (Pls.' Beaver Ex. 6B (document BEA 006410).) "
656,142," Since the contracts generally reflect that the booking agency did not offer better terms to the concert promoter the changes in 
contract terms strongly reflect negotiation by the promoters as claimed by Jam in the hearing. (Hrg. Tr. 10/20/03 at 207-11.) The 
successful concert promoters often end up with better terms than are offered by the Booking Agency Defendants. The only 
inference to be drawn is that due to their standing in the market or relationship with a desirable concert venues or relationship 
with the artists they can negotiate better contract terms. Indeed, a concert promoter who owns a desirable venue (Nederlander 
Theaters) may refuse to pay deposits. (See Fax from Nancy Vance of WMA to Billie Bullock, dated June 28, 1995 (stating 
""Nederlander does not pay deposits (never has, never will)""), Pls.' Hrg. Ex. 15.) "
657,143," In Plaintiffs' Opposition to the Booking Agency Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment, Plaintiffs cite to Exhibit 31 as 
evidence of WMA's and CAA's ""unvarnished racial animus."" (Pls.' Joint Mem. at 15.) Exhibit 31 is an unidentified and 
unauthenticated document, not produced by Plaintiffs in discovery, which Plaintiffs reference in support of the allegation in their 
opposition brief that ""the racial epithet 'nigger' was used 349 times in e-mails of employees of CAA and WMA."" (Id.; Declaration 
of Beverly R. Frank, Esq. in Support of Booking Agency Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment, dated May 23, 2003 
(""Frank Decl.""), PP3-4.) Despite repeated requests by CAA and WMA, Plaintiffs' new counsel refused to provide the Defendants with any foundational 
information regarding Exhibit 31 or to produce a hard copy of the underlying e-mails referenced in Exhibit 31. In the first half of 2001, Plaintiffs' former counsel had sought production of Defendants' e-mails, including e-mail data stored on 
thousands of CAA and WMA back up tapes and computer hard drives. Magistrate Judge Francis granted the request by order 
dated January 16, 2002 (the ""Order""), but required Plaintiffs' former counsel, among other things, to: (1) notify Defendants' 
counsel of the search procedure to be used by Plaintiffs in identifying responsive e-mails, including specific word searches; (2) 
identify any e-mails they considered ""material"" to this litigation; and (3) produce them to Defendants in ""hard copy with Bates 
Stamp."" Rowe Entertainment, Inc. v. The William Morris Agency, Inc., 205 F.R.D. 421, 433 (S.D.N.Y. 2002). Until the materiality 
of the e-mails had been agreed upon by counsel, this discovery was to be for attorney eyes only. Id. Plaintiffs' counsel, 
thereafter, notified Defendants that only the e-mails of certain named employees of the Defendant agencies would be searched. 
Defendants complained that Exhibit 31 demonstrates that the Plaintiffs thereafter conducted searches of mailbox users who 
were not among those agreed upon employees, and that Plaintiffs' counsel have not produced the hard copies of actual e-mails 
identified in Exhibit 31 as required by the Order. Plaintiffs' new counsel, thereafter, agreed that the number of uses of ""nigger"" 
referred to in their brief should have been 76 times, not 349 times, but due to Plaintiffs' failure to comply with Judge Francis's 
Order, Defendants have been unable to determine whether the racial epithet was used by an employee or by a correspondent to 
the employee or was contained in song lyrics, scripts, screen plays or spam. (Frank Decl. PP32-33.) In view of Plaintiffs' new counsel's breaches of Magistrate Judge Francis's Order, and Plaintiffs' failure to present any evidence 
or argument to show that the e-mails constituted utterances by employees of Defendants whose actions were material to the 
issues in this case, the Court is disregarding Exhibit 31 in its entirety as irrelevant material."
657,144, The facts related to the 1997 Kenny G/Braxton tour are reviewed supra pp. 73-76. 
658,145," In their Response in Opposition, Plaintiffs attempt to inculpate WMA in the Plaintiffs' complaint about Kenny G/Braxton tour 
pointing out that WMA issued contracts for Ms. Braxton's performances to a former concert Promoter Defendant. (Pls.' Resp. 
WMA Mem. at 21 n.45 (citing Pls.' WMA Ex. 43, a fax from Nick Caris of WMA to Rich Engler of Dicesare-Engler Productions, 
dated Jan. 17, 1997 (requesting the forwarding of a signed contract).) This fax was sent after Mr. Rowe and Mr. Boseman 
reached their agreement with Mr. Light for co-promotion of Ms. Braxton on January 6, 1997. (See Letter from Mr. Light to Mr. 
Rowe and Mr. Boseman, dated Jan. 6, 1997, attached as Ex. 14 to Pls.' Counter Jam 56.1 Stmt.) Plaintiffs also cite Exhibits 44 
to 48, containing contracts on WMA forms with Ms. Braxton as a party, to demonstrate that WMA required only 10% or no 
deposit from dominant promoters whom it awarded ""the Braxton concerts"" or required a 50% deposit only a few days before her 
scheduled performance. (Pls.' Resp. WMA Mem. at 21 n.46.) Review of these contracts shows that they are not the subject of 
Plaintiffs' complaint, which involved the original awarding of contracts to promote concerts on the 1997 Kenny G/Braxton tour by 
CAA's Mike Piranian in the fall of 1996. These contracts on WMA forms appear to provide remuneration for Ms. Braxton and 
assure her performance, but do not add terms to the original contract between Kenny G's manager and the promoter. (See 
Armand Decl., attached to Light Decl. II, Ex. A (contract on CAA form between Contemporary Productions and Turner 
Management, dated Nov. 12, 1996, for a concert at Kiel Auditorium in St. Louis on Jan. 16, 1997) and Pls.' Resp. WMA Ex. 47 
(contract on WMA form between Contemporary Productions and Madam Ashley, Inc., Ms. Braxton's manager, dated Dec. 16, 
1996 for this same concert).) Contemporary Productions' WMA contract form merely secures Ms. Braxton's services for the 
same concert on the terms required under Contemporary Productions contract with Turner Management. The evidence provided 
does not show WMA had any involvement in the scheduling or choosing of lead promoters for concerts on the Kenny G/Braxton 
tour. "
659,146," Exhibit 18 lists no venues, dates, artist's split or other key terms for a specific concert that would allow an artist or an artist's 
manager to compare this offer to other promoters' offers for specific concerts. This letter, however, will be considered an offer for 
part of the national tour for the purposes of this opinion, as is admitted by WMA. (See Mem. of Law in Supp. of WMA's Mot. for 
Summ. J., dated Feb. 28, 2003 (""WMA Mem.""), at 8 n.5.)"
659,147," Minneapolis, Detroit, New York and Los Angeles are not listed as ""Magic."" (Pls.' Resp. WMA Ex. 19.)"
659,148," On September 4, 1998, Mr. Frasco of WMA sent a memo to all promoters informing them that Magic Johnson Promotions 
would be a 50% promoter on all Maxwell deals, that tickets would read ""Magic Johnson Productions in association with local 
promoter Presents,"" that the Black Entertainment Network would be the tour sponsor, and that Billy Sparks, a black promoter, 
would approve all radio and media advertising. (Pls.' WMA Resp. Ex. 22.) "
660,149," Plaintiffs dispute this statement, but only cite the affidavit of Mr. R. Johnson, who worked as a booking agent at WMA from 
1982 to 1986, to support this contention. (Pls.' Am. Local Rule 56.1 Stmt. of Disputed Facts in Supp. of Opp'n to WMA's Mot. for 
Summ. J., dated June 16, 2003 (""Pls.' Am. WMA Stmt.""), P57 (citing R. Johnson Aff., Pls.' WMA Ex. 9, P3).) As stated 
previously, Mr. R. Johnson's testimony is admitted as far as it relates to his personal knowledge, which does not extend to the 
1998 Maxwell tour. WMA 56.1 Statement P57 is considered as if undisputed."
660,150," Even if Plaintiffs had shown a prima facie case of discrimination, Mr. Frasco's testimony sets forth a valid business reason, a 
decision by the principal to reject the Plaintiffs' offers. See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804. Plaintiffs do not offer any 
evidence to show that the reasons for choosing MJP were pretextual."
660,151," Mr. Frasco also testified that Mr. Hoffman decided that Mr. Jones would be involved as a co-promoter if Maxwell played in 
any of the cities Mr. Jones ""normally plays."" (Frasco Dep., in J.A., Vol. IV, at 127.)"
660,152," Exhibit 19 is dated 8/5/98, not 8/5/99."
660,153," Guarantees cover the artist in the event the concert is not successful. The artist promoter split, venue capacity, and ticket 
prices allow the artist to benefit from a successful concert."
660,154," Plaintiff King testified he did not submit a bid to promote the 1999 Maxwell tour. (King Dep., in J.A., Vol. V, at 1101.) "
661,155," In his deposition Mr. Boseman refers to the Theatre as a venue relating to the Paramount, but all further references by 
Plaintiffs to this conversation refer to the Theatre at Madison Square Garden. (Boseman Dep., in J.A., Vol. III, at 721-22.)"
661,156," Mr. Boseman said that the conversation between Mr. Slater and Ms. Lewis couldn't have been more than a week or two after 
a conversation he had had with Ms. Lewis and that he may have spoken to Ms. Lewis in both January 1997 and March 1997. 
(Boseman Dep., in J.A., Vol. III, at 733.)"
661,157," The Amended Complaint alleges that Mr. Delsener made the call, not Mr. Slater, as Mr. Boseman states in his deposition. "
662,158," What Mr. Delsener and Mr. Slater said Ms. Lewis told them is hearsay as to the truth of the statements made and must be 
disregarded for purposes of this motion. Plaintiffs offer no testimony from Mr. Delsener or Mr. Slater to support this attribution to 
Ms. Lewis."
662,159," Ms. Lewis's uncontradicted affidavit states that, although she has specialized in urban, contemporary music (primarily R&B, 
hip hop and rap music) for eleven years at Norby Walters and for the past thirteen years at WMA, has a 99% client base of 
African American artists, and had business relationships with numerous black promoters, she had had virtually no contact with 
any of the four Plaintiffs until 1997. (Lewis Decl. PP3-8.) Prior to 1997, none of the Plaintiffs had expressed an interest in 
promoting any of the clients she has represented over the last 20 years, and Mr. Boseman has never submitted a bid for any of 
the artists she has represented. (Id. PP6, 8.)"
662,160," It is the Court's understanding that industry functions hire their own promoters, and independent promoters do not compete to 
be hired by the artist or the artist's manager."
662,161," Delsener/Slater did promote Ms. Badu at the Supper Club. (Lewis Decl. Ex. 1.) During the oral argument, Defendant's 
counsel asserted without contradiction that Delsener/Slater ""controlled"" the Supper Club and any artist wishing to perform in that 
venue would have to go through Delsener/Slater. (Hrg. Tr. 10/16/03 at 113.)"
662,162," Even if Mr. Boseman argued that he was exempt from the specific bid requirement his claim would fail. Assuming that the 
standards for exemption from the specific bid requirement set forth in Brown v. Coach Stores and Petrosino, both cases "
663,," concerning failure to promote in the employment context, apply in the contract discrimination context, Mr. Boseman has failed to 
present evidence to qualify for these exemptions. Under Brown v. Coach Stores, Mr. Boseman must present pattern and 
practice evidence showing that bidding would have been futile and identify a specific position (in this case, venue) he would 
have applied for ""had the alleged discriminatory practice not existed."" Brown v. Coach Stores, 163 F.3d at 711. Mr. Boseman 
has presented no evidence demonstrating a pattern or practice of discrimination by WMA, and he has not identified any specific 
venue for which he would have applied. Under Petrosino, Mr. Boseman must demonstrate ""that (1) the vacancy at issue was not 
posted, and (2) the employee either had (a) no knowledge of the vacancy before it was filled or (b) attempted to apply for it 
through informal procedures endorsed by the employer."" Petrosino, 385 F.3d at 227. Mr. Boseman had knowledge that Ms. 
Badu was playing smaller venues, and thus, had the opportunity to submit a bid to WMA for Ms. Badu concerts at such venues."
663,163," Attached to Ms. Lewis's declaration is a press release, which she states the BPA disseminated in 1998 to the media, stating 
that Ms. Badu was ""allowing herself to be prostituted and exploited by the White Music Establishment,"" that ""her White Booking 
Agency refused to let her work for Black Promoters"" and calling for a boycott of her recording products and concert 
appearances. (Lewis Decl. Ex. 3 (BPA Press Release).) "
664,164, Plaintiff Boseman also speaks of the venue Radio City Music Hall when referring to this concert. 
665,165," Plaintiffs contend that Mr. Haymon sold his business to SFX in May of 1999 and thus, did not promote the tour. (Pls.' Resp. 
WMA Mem. at 24 n.53.) However, SFX only acquired 50% of Mr. Haymon's business in May 1999 and a year later increased 
their ownership to 80%. (Haymon Dep., Ex. 86 in Pls.' Resp. WMA Exs., at 23.) Mr. Haymon stated that after the purchases by 
SFX, he ran the business in the same way. (Haymon Dep., in J. Reply A., at 162-163.) "
666,166," Mr. Schultz states that he only spoke with Mr. Kelley or his employees at Mid-South Concerts, including Ms. Green, when his 
clients wished to play at Mud Island and that all concert related matters were handled by Mid-South employees. (Schultz Aff. 
P5.) "
667,167," Plaintiffs dispute Joint 56.1 Statement P189, but cite no evidence rebutting this claim as to this artist. This statement is 
considered as if undisputed."
667,168," Plaintiffs dispute this statement, but their response is unresponsive. Joint 56.1 Statement P201 is considered as if 
undisputed."
667,169," Furthermore, Plaintiffs have failed to present any evidence supporting its claims that WMA has ""granted market domination to 
a small fraternity of dominant white promoters"" (Pls.' Resp. WMA Mem. at 2) and has ""unlawfully nurtured the dominant white 
promoters to great financial success"" (id. at 7). To the contrary, Mr. Kapp's testimony, on which Plaintiffs rely as support for this 
conclusion, does not mention WMA. Mr. Kapp testified that the individual concert promoters, by purchasing venues and 
promoting as many shows as possible, have achieved dominant positions in each of their territories. (Kapp Dep., Pls.' Joint 
Mem. Ex. 12, at 230-33.) "
668,170," In this same footnote in their responsive memorandum, Plaintiffs cite a number of other letters that they claim demonstrate 
that WMA only contacted an ""elite group of dominant white promoters to inform them of upcoming promotional opportunities and 
[to] make arrangements for their participation."" (Pls.' Resp. WMA Mem. at 7-8, n.19.) Plaintiffs base their assertion that ""none of 
these letters was sent to a single black promoter"" on Mr. Rowe's affidavit. (Id.) Plaintiffs have chosen not to gather testimony 
relating to the circumstances relating to those letters and, thus, deprived the Defendants of the opportunity to present a 
legitimate business reason for contacting those particular promoters. Nor do those letters, selected from thousands of 
documents, raise an inference of racial discrimination since those letters were also not sent to the over 1,000 of the 1,042 
independent white promoters identified in the Saad Study. (Saad Report, J.A., Vol. I, at 14.)"
668,171, Plaintiffs chose not to depose management of Culture Club to challenge Mr. Schultz's sworn testimony as pretextual.
668,172," As stated supra pp. 105-06, Plaintiffs have not shown that their selection of contracts is representative. Rather, the evidence 
shows that Plaintiffs choose the contracts that looked interesting to them."
668,173," Plaintiffs, in their Memorandum in Response to WMA's motion, cite a number of exhibits containing contracts on WMA forms 
between artists and the alleged dominant promoters or letters from WMA to the alleged dominant promoters, which Plaintiffs 
claim are evidence of the ""more onerous contractual terms"" required of black promoters by WMA. (Pls.' Resp. WMA Mem. at 9-
10.) Plaintiffs cannot show a prima facie case of discrimination underMcDonnell Douglas using these exhibits, as they have not 
submitted any evidence showing they bid on any concerts related to the documents contained in the exhibits. Nor can Plaintiffs 
use these documents to demonstrate a pattern and practice of discrimination because they have selected these letters and 
contracts from thousands of documents. Additionally, Plaintiffs do not cite to any testimony relating to the circumstances relevant to these exhibits by the parties involved 
or by any WMA employees. Instead, Plaintiffs rely solely on Mr. Rowe's affidavit to assert that ""there is no legitimate business 
reason which can justify these disparate contractual terms WMA requires of black and white promoters."" (Pls.' Resp. WMA Mem. "
669,," at 9.) Plaintiffs evidently chose not to explore the facts and circumstances surrounding these exhibits. Plaintiffs' failure to inquire 
about these ""disparate contract terms"" and exhibits during oral discovery deprived the Defendants of the opportunity to show 
that a valid business reason existed for these disparate terms."
669,174," Mr. Grosslight also states that WMA has written polices setting forth its commitment to equal opportunity and non-toleration of 
racial discrimination ""in any form at [their] company whether it is by WMA employees, vendors or clients."" (Grosslight Decl. I 
P12.)"
669,175," The two promoters that Mr. Grosslight remembered were not so designated were in Tupelo, Mississippi and Lafayette, 
Louisiana, not cities allegedly controlled by the dominant promoter defendants, and that in one case, he recommended a black 
promoter and in the other a Caucasian. (Grosslight Decl. I P9.)"
669,176," Additionally, Plaintiffs evidently chose not to make the documents upon which they base their claim the subject of 
interrogation during depositions. Thus, there is no testimonial support for their interpretation of the documents. Review of the 
documents suggests that Plaintiffs' interpretation is misleading. Furthermore, these claims seem to be subject to Magistrate 
Francis's order of preclusion dated July 8, 2002. (J.A., Vol. II, Ex. 43.) "
670,177," In the Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs additionally assert: In or about May 1999, after this lawsuit was filed, CAA recently hired the first black agent in the history of the concert 
business to participate in booking white contemporary music acts. Dennis Ashley telephoned plaintiff Rowe and thanked 
him for bringing this lawsuit because, he said, it was the reason he was hired. He told Rowe that he was being treated like a 
king. (Am. Compl. P87(o).) In their motion papers, Plaintiffs cite this statement and other instances involving CAA's hiring policy and work environment as 
evidence that ""bolsters the plaintiffs' allegations of racial discrimination against CAA."" (Pls.' Response in Opp'n to CAA's Mot. for 
Summ. J., dated Apr. 25, 2003 (""Pls.' CAA Mem.""), at 21-22.) Mr. Ashley, however, testified that he did not know Mr. Rowe prior 
to his employment at CAA and never called Mr. Rowe to thank him for this lawsuit or his job. (CAA 56.1 Stmt. P121.) In any 
event, CAA's hiring of a black agent to participate in booking white contemporary music acts is not evidence of any 
discriminatory action by CAA against Plaintiffs. Additionally, CAA has a policy of equality and equal opportunity. (Dep. of Richard 
Lovett, dated Feb. 26, 2002 (""Lovett Dep.""), in Pls.' CAA Dep. Tr., Vol. I, at 99-100.) CAA has a strict policy against 
discrimination in employment and in all dealings with clients, vendors and the public. (Light Decl. I P5.) "
671,178, Plaintiffs' reply is non-responsive; CAA 56.1 Stmt. P115 is considered as if undisputed. 
672,179," This claim is connected to Plaintiffs' general allegation that even when Plaintiffs have promoted black artists in the past, they 
are not given opportunity to promote these artists once they reach ""star status."" (See Am. Compl. P4.) Plaintiffs, however, have 
provided no evidence showing they in fact ever served as ""promoters"" for Toni Braxton previously. See supra p. 73."
672,180," This contract was revised by Dennis Turner, Kenny G's manager, in January 1997 to $ 232,597 per show. (Light Decl. II Ex. 
4.)"
672,181, Mr. Rowe does not state to which concert he refers. 
673,182," Jam's contract, dated November 25, 1996, with Kenny G and other contracts for the Kenny G/Toni Braxton concerts are on 
CAA's form contract and require the promoters to provide deposits based on the guarantees for Kenny G and do not provide 
separate guarantees for Toni Braxton. (See Armand Decl. Ex. A.) Plaintiffs have presented contracts on WMA forms that do not 
require the promoters to pay deposits for Ms. Braxton. See supra note 145. From the Court's review of these documents, the 
contracts on WMA forms secure Ms. Braxton's appearances at the Kenny G concerts, as required by the promoters' contracts 
with Turner Management. Although many of the contracts presented by CAA provide for guarantees below the initial guarantee requested, Ms. Braxton's 
manager testified that many promoters felt that the initial guarantees were too high and submitted lesser bids. (Phillips Dep., in 
J.A., Vol. V, at 50.) Additionally, the evidence shows that black promoter Larry Bailey received a contract with $ 65,000 
guarantee and 85/15 split with a $ 16,250 (25%) deposit by company check on March 11, 1997 (Armand Decl. Ex. B) and a 
contract for another venue with approximately the same terms on April 11, 1997 (Armand Decl. Ex. C)."
673,183," Unless otherwise noted, the following facts are undisputed by testimony, affidavits or declarations of Plaintiffs, which are 
based on personal knowledge. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(b). "
674,184," Plaintiffs claim that the alleged discrimination against them in relation to the 1998 Janet Jackson concert is connected to 
Plaintiffs' general allegation that even when Plaintiffs have promoted black artists in the past, they are not given opportunity to 
promote these artists once they reach ""star status."" (See Am. Compl. P4.) Al Haymon was lead promoter for the 1994 Janet 
Jackson tour, and Ms. Jackson was a CAA, Inc. client at that time. (Haymon Dep., in J.A., Vol. IV, at 123-24.) At his deposition, 
Plaintiff Rowe stated that he didn't know which Janet Jackson concerts he co-promoted in 1994 (Rowe Dep., in J.A., Vol. VI, at 
541), but in his affidavit submitted in response to CAA's motion, Mr. Rowe states that he co-promoted Janet Jackson in 1994 
with Mr. Haymon in Atlanta and Detroit (Rowe CAA Aff., Pls.' CAA Ex. 1, P271). In his deposition, Mr. Boseman stated he co-
promoted Ms. Jackson in 1994 in New York, put up a guarantee on the show, and provided services such as advertising and 
street production. (Boseman Dep., in J.A., Vol. III, at 1255-57.)"
674,185," Plaintiffs dispute this statement, but cite the affidavit of Mr. Rowe for support. (Pls.' Resp. CAA 56.1 Stmt. P71.) Mr. Rowe 
has not been shown to have personal knowledge regarding this statement and does not cite any other source for this statement. 
(Rowe CAA Aff., Pls.' CAA Ex. 1, P230.) Thus, CAA's 56.1 Statement P71 is considered as if undisputed."
674,186," Plaintiffs dispute this statement in part, but only cite Mr. Rowe's affidavit submitted in response to this motion. (Pls.' Resp. 
CAA 56.1 Stmt. P72.) Mr. Rowe has not been shown to have personal knowledge regarding this statement and does not cite any 
other evidence for this statement. (Rowe CAA Aff., Pls.' CAA Ex. 1, P231.) Thus, CAA's 56.1 Statement P72 is considered as if 
undisputed."
674,187," Plaintiffs dispute this statement based on Mr. Rowe's affidavit stating that he was not told Ms. Jackson insisted on black 
promoter involvement. (Pls.' Resp. CAA 56.1 Stmt. P73 (citing Rowe CAA Aff., Pls.' CAA Ex. 1, P232).) However, in the letter 
Mr. Light sent Mr. Rowe on March 4, 1998, Mr. Light mentioned that there must be black involvement in each date. (Letter from 
Rob Light to Leonard Rowe, dated Mar. 4, 1998, Light Decl. I Ex. 13.) CAA's 56.1 Statement P73 is accepted as if undisputed."
674,188," Brad Wavra of Magicworks testified that someone at CAA raised the concern of involving black promoters on the 1998 Janet 
Jackson tour with him during negotiation of the Magicworks/Jackson contract, but he could not remember when, or whether they 
specified Ms. Jackson's concern about this. (Wavra Dep., in J.A., Vol. VI, at 135-36.) Prior to the 1998 Janet Jackson tour, Mr. 
Wavra had not included black promoters when he promoted black artists. (Id. at 141.)"
674,189," Plaintiffs dispute this statement as based on inadmissible hearsay. The statement is offered only for the fact that it was made 
and therefore is not hearsay. See infra note 197. If admissible, Plaintiffs do not dispute that $ 300,000 was the amount, but 
dispute that Mr. Light was instructed about this. (Pls.' Resp. CAA 56.1 Stmt. P74.) Plaintiffs base this objection on Mr. Rowe's 
affidavit. Plaintiffs present no evidence to show that Mr. Rowe has personal knowledge of instructions given to Mr. Light, and, 
thus, Mr. Light's statement is considered as if undisputed."
674,190," Plaintiffs dispute this statement in part. Specifically, Plaintiffs deny that Mr. Light ""encouraged"" Mr. Rowe to send in a bid, but 
they admit Mr. Light provided information about the tour to Mr. Rowe. (Pls.' Resp. CAA 56.1 Stmt. P75 (citing Rowe CAA Aff. 
P325).) "
675,191, Plaintiffs dispute this statement in the same manner they dispute CAA's 56.1 Statement P74.
675,192, Mr. Rowe in his deposition refers to white promoters as Pop promoters.
675,193," The letter constitutes an offer to produce a tour for Janet Jackson but does not contain dates or information relating to 
proposed financing, ticket prices or other items included in written offers for individual concerts. (Light Decl. I P36.) The total of 
this offer is $ 8.7 million."
675,194," Plaintiffs dispute this statement, citing Mr. Rowe's affidavit stating that Mr. Rowe has not seen any document demonstrating 
that Mr. Light forwarded his offer. (Pls.' Resp. CAA 56.1 Stmt. P79 (citing Rowe CAA Aff. P234).) Plaintiffs claim that the ""truth of 
Mr. Light's testimony is a question of fact for the jury."" (Id.; see also Pls. CAA Mem. at 14 n.22.) Ms. Kinzel states in her 
declaration, dated May 20, 2003, that Mr. Light forwarded her Mr. Rowe's letter and that she wrote ""fax Gillian and Rusty"" on the 
letter as an instruction to her assistant, who then faxed the letter to Rusty Hooker, who worked with Mr. Davies. (Kinzel Decl. 
P5.) Ms. Kinzel attaches a copy of the letter with a note, undisputedly in her handwriting, to her declaration. (Kinzel Decl. Ex. 2.) 
Plaintiffs have presented no evidence to contradict the testimony of Mr. Light or Ms. Kinzel, and, thus, the truth of statement is 
not controverted. See Berman, 986 F. Supp. at 200."
675,195," Mr. Rowe's letter of February 20, 1998, (Light Decl. I Ex. 11), demonstrates that Mr. Rowe's statement in paragraph 236 of 
his responsive declaration is untrue. "
676,196," The head of CAA's Music Department recommended to Don Passman, Ms. Jackson's attorney, that Ms. Jackson would be 
better served by using individual promoters rather than a national tour promoter such as Magicworks. (Dep. of Thomas Ross, 
dated Jan. 29, 2002 (""Ross Dep.""), in J. Reply. A, at 152-54.)"
676,197," Plaintiffs claim that Mr. Davies's instructions to Mr. Light are hearsay is rejected. Mr. Light's declaration states it is based on 
personal knowledge (Light Decl. I P2), and statements of instructions received are admissible in evidence, not to prove the truth 
of the statements contained in those instructions, but rather to prove the fact that the instructions were received. Fed. R. Evid. 
801(c); see Advisory Committee's Notes Subdivision (c) (""If the significance of an offered statement lies solely in the fact that it 
was made, no issue is raised as to the truth of anything asserted, and the statement is not hearsay. Emich Motors Corp. v. 
General Motors Corp., 181 F.2d 70 (7th Cir. 1950), rev'd on other grounds, 340 U.S. 558, 95 L. Ed. 534, 71 S. Ct. 408."") "
677,198," Plaintiffs also claim that Mr. Light's March 4, 1998 letter was duplicitous because CAA had already sold the tour to 
Magicworks. (Pls.' CAA Mem. at 15; Rowe CAA Aff., Pls.' CAA Ex. 1, P243.) It appears that on March 3, 1998, Ms. Jackson and 
Mr. Davies still wanted a letter of credit for the balance of the guarantee from Magicworks. On March 3, 1998, Don Passman of 
Gang, Tyre, Ramer & Brown, Inc. (attorneys for Ms. Jackson and Mr. Davies) (Light Dep., in J.A., Vol. V, at 130) sent a draft 
deal memo to Ms. Kinzel of CAA, the cover letter to which states, ""we have to resolve the letter of credit/guarantee issue before 
we can finalize. I need your input on a few points as well."" The draft deal memo was for finalization ""tomorrow."" (Pls.' CAA Ex. 
53.) However, the evidence submitted on this motion demonstrates that the tour had not already been sold to Magicworks on March 
4, 1998, as alleged by Mr. Rowe. On the afternoon of March 6, 1998, CAA received a copy of a letter from Gang, Tyre, Ramer & 
Brown, Inc., Ms. Jackson's attorneys, to Magicworks's attorneys, attaching an execution draft of the deal memo containing the 
provision for letters of direction, not letters of credit. (Light Decl. I Ex. 14.) So as of that date, the deal memo had not been 
executed. The formal contract with Magicworks was dated April 7, 1998. Mr. Rowe states that the final contract between Janet "
678,," Jackson and Magicworks does not provide either for an irrevocable letter of credit or letter of direction. (Rowe CAA Aff., Pls.' 
CAA Ex. 1, P246 (citing Pls.' CAA Ex. 47); Pls.' CAA 56.1 Stmt. P357.) The Court's review of Plaintiffs' CAA Exhibit 47 shows 
that in fact letters of direction were required. (Pls.' CAA Ex. 47 at 4, 11.)"
678,199," Although Mr. Rowe's answering affidavit states that Mr. Light told him that the total guarantee was $ 12 million, in his 
deposition, Mr. Rowe testified that the total guarantee he had to meet was $ 11 million, all cash up front with no letter of credit. 
(Rowe Dep., in J.A., Vol. VI, at 1441-45.) By his declaration in April 24, 2003, Mr. Rowe cannot, by stating another amount 
contradicting his deposition testimony in 2001 and the terms contained in the March 4, 1998 letter to Mr. Rowe from Mr. Light, 
create a triable issue of fact on that issue. Bickerstaff, 196 F.3d at 455."
678,200," In his deposition, Mr. Rowe stated that this conversation occurred sometime after February 20, 1998, but did not specify a 
date. (Rowe Dep., in J.A., Vol. VI, at 1440.)"
678,201," Plaintiffs dispute this statement by stating that ""whether [this] is true requires a credibility determination by the jury"" (Pls.' 
Resp. CAA 56.1 Stmt. P96) and claim that Mr. Rowe's statement that Mr. Light never told Mr. Rowe he could offset his risk by 
partnering supports that Mr. Light's assertion is not true (id. (citing Rowe CAA Aff. P258).) The Court finds that this is not a 
genuine issue of material fact. Mr. Rowe's bids for 29 cities with a $ 300,000 guarantee per city totaling $ 8.7 million would lead 
one to assume he would partner with local promoters to offset this risk. In fact Mr. Rowe states, ""We are also open to the idea of 
co-promoting with Pop Promoters in some markets."" (Light Decl. I Ex. 10.) As stated supra note 194, Plaintiffs must cite 
evidence to controvert Defendants' assertion, not merely claim credibility issues. Berman, 986 F. Supp. at 200. "
679,202," Mr. Rowe maintains that the ""only reason Mr. Light informed Magicworks that [he] had expressed an interest in the tour and 
'recommended' that Magicworks consider involving him was because [Mr. Rowe], in a letter dated March 31, 1998, on behalf of 
the Black Promotion [sic] Association had threatened to boycott and picket."" (Rowe CAA Aff., Pls.' CAA Ex. 1, P259; Pls.' Resp. 
CAA 56.1 Stmt. P97; see Pls.' CAA Ex 54; Light Decl. I, Ex. 17.) However, Mr. Rowe does not demonstrate he has personal 
knowledge of when Mr. Light recommended to Mr. Wavra that he involve Mr. Rowe. Mr. Rowe's claim is conclusory and 
argumentative and must be disregarded. The rest of Mr. Light's declaration, that he had also suggested that Magicworks 
consider involving black promoters, Billy Sparks and Quentin Perry on the tour, is confirmed by these gentlemen. (Light Decl. I 
P50; Sparks Dep., in J.A., Vol. VI, at 33-34; CAA 56.1 Stmt. P98.)"
679,203," Plaintiffs do not dispute the above statement, although they dispute CAA 56.1 Statement P101 in part."
679,204," Plaintiffs dispute that Mr. Perry and Mr. Sparks were hired as promoters and cite Plaintiffs' CAA Exhibit 55, which states ""we 
have hired Quinton [sic] Perry and Billy Sparks as our tour-marketing consultants,"" and the deposition of Mr. Sparks at page 96. 
(Pls.' Resp. CAA 56.1 Stmt. P103.) However, Mr. Sparks's statement on page 96 is in relation to Prince, not Janet Jackson, and 
at page 37 of this deposition he states he did promotions for the 1998 Janet Jackson tour. Additionally, Mr. Rowe admits that Mr. 
Perry co-promoted Janet Jackson concerts in Washington D.C. and Los Angeles. (Rowe CAA Aff., Pls.' CAA Ex. 1, P266.) "
680,205," Plaintiffs dispute this statement, but cite only paragraph 264 of Mr. Rowe's affidavit submitted in opposition to this motion. Mr. 
Rowe has not been shown to have personal knowledge as to what Mr. Light asked Mr. Perry and Mr. Sparks and, thus, CAA 
56.1 Statement P264 is considered as if undisputed."
680,206," Plaintiffs dispute this only to add that they were given different terms by Magicworks than Magicworks received from CAA. 
However, Magicworks contract was with Ms. Jackson's management and drafted by her attorneys. "
681,207," As discussed earlier, Mr. Rowe did submit two letters of interest for the 1998 Janet Jackson tour. (Light Decl. I Exs. 10, 11.) 
Also, Mr. Rowe did submit written bids to Magicworks for Janet Jackson concerts in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. (Light 
Decl. Ex. 21; see also Rowe CAA Aff., Pls.' CAA Ex. 1, P262).)"
681,208," Mr. Boseman did submit a bid to Magicworks for 50% involvement in a New York concert on the 1998 Janet Jackson tour. 
(Boseman CAA Aff., Pls.' CAA Ex. 3, P19; see also Light Decl. Ex. 19.)"
681,209," Mr. Light has made another attempt to solicit bids from Plaintiffs. On June 27, 2002, Mr. Light forwarded Mr. Rowe a list of 
CAA clients who might be touring and invited Mr. Rowe to call him or submit offers for any artist. (CAA 56.1 Stmt. P38.) This 
statement is undisputed by Plaintiffs. (Pls.' Resp. CAA 56.1 Stmt. P38.) In the June 27, 2002 letter to Mr. Rowe, Mr. Light stated 
that the enclosed list ""is an internal document which we do not normally send out to buyers [but] . . . is being provided as a 
springboard for discussion."" (Light Decl. I Ex. 1 (emphasis in original).) Mr. Rowe has not submitted any bids in response to this 
letter. (Id. P17.)"
681,210, Plaintiffs' reply is non-responsive; Joint 56.1 Statement P201 is considered as if undisputed. 
682,211," Almost half of Plaintiffs' CAA 56.1 Statement is based on Rowe's testimony. (See Pls.' CAA 56.1 Stmt. PP1-5, 11-17, 19-37, 
41, 43-44, 46-48, 50-51, 53, 55-56, 58-59, 61-62, 145, 151-243, 261-65, 272-73, 276, 282-85, 287, 299, 300-02, 304-5, 307-08, 
312-13, 318, 323-24, 326-27, 329-30, 332-33, 336-37, 340-42, 345-47, 349, 351-53, 355-56, 358-61, 363, 366, 370, 372, 376-
78, 421-23 (relying solely on Mr. Rowe's CAA Aff. for evidentiary support).)"
682,212," See, e.g., Pls.' CAA 56.1 Stmt. PP8, 13-37, 39, 41, 44, 47, 49-70, 72-127, 129-41, 144-50, 244-45, 251-59, 312-13."
682,213," Plaintiffs make additional allegations against CAA, but submit no evidence to support these statements beyond Rowe's 
affidavit, consisting of conclusory or irrelevant allegations. (See, e.g., Pls.' Resp. CAA 56.1 Stmt. P9 (""CAA often allows the 
dominant white promoters to cut a side deal with Ticketmaster whereby the price of the ticket is increased by several dollars.""); 
Pls.' Resp. CAA 56.1 Stmt. P9 (alleging that CAA contracts with corporate sponsors, such as The Coca-Cola Company, to the 
detriment of its artists).) "
683,214," CAA is a Delaware limited liability company that was created on or about August 18, 1995. (CAA 56.1 Stmt. P1.) On or about 
October 1, 1995, CAA acquired certain assets of Creative Artists Agency, Inc., a California corporation now known as OMH, and 
commenced conducting a talent agency business. (Light Decl. I P3.) CAA's motion papers state, ""CAA acquired certain assets of 
Creative Artists Agency, Inc."" (CAA 56.1 Stmt. P2; Light Decl. I P3 (emphasis added).) Plaintiffs cite to CAA's Answer to the 
Amended Complaint, in which CAA stated that they ""acquired the assets of Creative Artists Agency, Inc. … as of October 1, 
1995."" (Answer and Defenses of CAA to the Am. Compl., dated Aug. 15, 2000, P19 (emphasis added).) Since neither statement 
indicates that CAA, LLC acquired the liabilities of CAA, Inc. or merged with CAA, Inc., and since there is no showing that the 
owners of CAA, Inc. even became part of CAA, LLC, this argument over language is meaningless. "
684,215," Plaintiffs dispute when Renaissance began active operations, asserting that active operations began in 1996. Plaintiffs cite 
some hearsay and the deposition of Mr. Zedeck to support their contention. Mr. Zedeck did testify that he booked dates for a few 
artists in 1996. (Zedeck Dep., in Pls.' Renaissance Ex. 25, at 36, 44-46.)"
684,216, Pls.' Resp. Renaissance's 56.1 Stmt. P8 is rejected as based on third party hearsay relating to Zedeck's earlier activities.
684,217," Plaintiffs now claim that Mr. Zedeck's current agency Evolution should be joined in this action as a defendant. (Pls.' Resp. 
Renaissance Mem. at 11).) However, the only evidence before the Court is that Evolution acquired the assets of Renaissance as 
of December 31, 1999, and that Evolution cannot be claimed to be Renaissance's alter ego as it has other business and is 
owned by two separate individuals, one of whom is Mr. Zedeck. Plaintiffs offer no evidence to demonstrate that Evolution can be 
found to be the alter ego of Renaissance. Nor have they offered evidence that Evolution took any discriminatory actions against 
them or were members of the conspiracy alleged in the Amended Complaint. "
685,218," Plaintiffs maintain that Mr. Jones was known to Mr. Zedeck as a concert promoter because ""Jones had previously promoted 
Renaissance's black artist, Solo."" (Pls.' Resp. Renaissance at 6 (citing Pls.' Renaissance Ex. 28).) Plaintiffs' Renaissance Exhibit 
28 (which is in Exhibit 29) contains copies of Summitt's contract, dated March 14, 1996, for services of Solo with Pyramid 
Entertainment during the 1996 Marlboro Military Tour. Pyramid Entertainment is not shown have been controlled or operated by 
Mr. Zedeck. Plaintiffs do not raise a genuine issue of material fact. The tour appears to be sponsored by Marlboro cigarettes, 
consistent with Mr. Zedeck's statement that he believed Mr. Jones was not an independent promoter but produced corporate 
events. "
686,219," Mr. Rowe also concludes that Renaissance does not require the Promoter Defendants to submit bids and bases this 
conclusion on his review of the thousands of documents Renaissance submitted to Plaintiffs. (Rowe Renaissance Aff., Pls.' 
Renaissance Ex. 1, P9.) Mr. Rowe made a similar statement in other affidavits and declarations. The other Defendants have 
proved the falsity of this claim by producing contracts. Defendant WMA has produced evidence of bids as well as contracts from 
its computerized files to Plaintiffs. Beaver also produced bids at the hearing. (Court Ex. A) The record shows that Plaintiffs' 
former counsel (along with other attorneys and paralegals), Mr. Rowe, and Mr. King examined the files. (See Decl. of Laura L. 
Mall, Esq., dated Apr. 22, 2003, attached as Ex. 7 to Pls.' Resp. Mem. in Opp'n to Defs.' Mot. to Exclude Pls.' Expert Witness Dr. 
Gerald D. Jaynes's Affidavit, dated Apr. 24, 2003, PP9-10.) There is no showing Mr. Rowe examined all files. This statement that 
Defendant Promoters are not required to submit written bids is conclusory. Also, the race of a promoter does not appear on the 
contract. "
688,220," The contract is dated June 2, 1999 for a concert on June 6, 1999. (Pls.' Renaissance Ex. 33.)"
688,221," Mr. Jones agreed to pay Ms. Cox only $ 8,000 per concert. (Id. Ex. 31.)"
688,222," As shown by Mr. Zedeck's declaration, 138 of the 252 contracts contained in Exhibits 34 and 35 are duplicates, leaving only 
114 contracts in all. (Zedeck Decl. II P7.) Of the 114, twenty were for concert dates covered by tour deposits of 50% of the 
minimum artist guarantees in a tour agreements with Metropolitan Entertainment and with SFX Entertainment, who paid tour 
deposits of $ 450,000 and $ 1,156,000 respectively. (Zedeck Decl. II PP8, 9, Exs. 3, 4) "
689,223," Mr. Zedeck also points out that Renaissance could not have conspired to bar Plaintiff Rowe from obtaining an exclusive 
promotion arrangement at the Chastain Amphitheater in the early 1980s (Am. Compl. P87(p)) since Renaissance did not exist at 
that time. (Zedeck Decl. I P19.) "

703,4," Although the first page of each settlement agreement states that the agreement was made ""as of the 4th day of June 2003,"" 
the district court found that the agreements were dated June 5, 2003. We do not know the basis on which the court concluded 
that the settlement agreements were dated June 5th, but this discrepancy is inconsequential to the issues before us."

general purpose card programs"" other than with Visa. Id. at 381."

Armenta's was among the approximately 8 million class members to receive settlement notices. Regardless, whether Armenta's 
received personal notice is of no importance to the analysis in this opinion. At the very least, it received actual notice by 
publication."

707,13," The Eighth Circuit notes, ""There is no impropriety in including in a settlement a description of claims that is somewhat broader 
than those that have been specifically pleaded. In fact, most settling defendants insist on this."" Berardinelli v. General Am. Life 
Ins. Co. (In re Gen. Am. Life. Ins. Co. Sale Practices Litig.), 357 F.3d 800, 805 (8th Cir. 2004). The Fifth Circuit has noted, ""The

but also claims which 'could have been alleged by reason of or in connection with any matter or fact set forth or referred to in' the

F.2d 108, 110 n.2 (7th Cir. 1976)). The Third Circuit has found that refusing to grant a broad settlement release would 
undermine multi-district class settlements because defendants would be concerned that their exposure to liability would be too 
great. In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. Sales Practice Litig., 261 F.3d 355, 366-67 (3d Cir. 2001); see also City Pshp. Co. v.

Plaintiffs v. City of Seattle, 955 F.2d 1268, 1287-88, (9th Cir. 1992) (same)."
707,14," The district court found that ""Reyn's is a virtual clone of the centerpiece of this case."" Visa Check III, 297 F. Supp. 2d at 513. 
Pasta Bella does not challenge this conclusion or plaintiffs' right under the identical factual predicate doctrine to release the 
Reyn's claims against defendants in this action. "
708,15," In describing the exclusionary rules, the complaint alleged that: Visa members collectively adopted a rule barring their members from issuing any plastic cards competitive with Visa cards. 
This rule exempted MasterCard, permitting Visa's dual members to continue issuing MasterCard plastic cards. Visa 
members then turned around and, acting as MasterCard members, adopted the same non-competition rule. The effect of 
these rules was to deprive existing and new competitors of a marketing outlet at the 6,000 largest and most appropriate 
vendors of their products., i.e., the dual bank members of Visa and MasterCard."
708,2," d Am. Compl. P 50. Another part of the complaint alleged that Visa and MasterCard asked members to boycott American 
Express and Discover cards. Id. PP 52-54."
708,16," NuCity also argues that the parties' conduct prior to settlement displays their clear understanding that the Membership Rules 
claims and the instant claims were distinct. As proof, NuCity highlights the fact that defendants did not move to consolidate 
Membership Rules and this action pursuant to the multidistrict litigation statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1407, or to dismiss one of the cases 
on the ground that one cause of action had been split into two cases. NuCity's retelling of the procedural facts is not accurate. In 
fact, class plaintiffs sought collateral estoppel against defendants based on the guilty verdict in Government's Membership 
Rules, see Status Conference Transcript, dated June 21, 2002, and the district court chose to delay briefing and argument on 
the estoppel issue until Government's Membership Rules was concluded on appeal, Order, dated June 24, 2002. Since this 
Circuit decided the appeal of Government's Membership Rules months after the parties signed the settlement agreement, the 
need to brief the estoppel issue never arose. See Government's Membership Rules, 344 F.3d 229 (publishing decision on 
September 17, 2003). "

] ""Due process requires adequate representation at all times throughout the litigation …."" Stephenson, 273 F.3d at 260 (internal quotation marks omitted). ""Before the bar of claim preclusion may be applied to the claim of an absent class member, it

709,18," Since the interests of class counsel and defendants are, in essence, aligned in this appeal, both parties are collectively 
referred to as ""respondents"" in this opinion. "
711,19, Pasta Bella did not raise this argument.
711,20," By the time it issued its opinion, the district court had already dismissed the foreign auction claims, see 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
1713, [WL] at * 11, leaving only the opportunity to bring those claims in foreign courts. Concluding that the foreign auction claims 
therefore lacked significant value, the district court nonetheless refused to approve even this minimal sacrifice without due 
consideration. Id. "
712,21," Defendants argue that the release is ""no broader than the effect of res judicata from the district court's judgment."" Case No. 
04-0344, Defs. Br. at 31 n. 11; Case No. 04-1052, Defs. Br. at 33 n.16. We need not consider this argument because we 
conclude that the Settlement validly released the non-party banks. "
714,22," We note, however, that class notices do sometimes include specific reference to pending actions. See, e.g., Auction Houses, 
2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1713, 2001 WL 170792, at *3-4; Fradette v. Am. Serv. Corp.; 1979 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13220, No. 76-6373-
Civ-CA, 1979 WL 1756, *1 (S.D. Fla. Aug. 29, 1979) (finding information concerning ""related litigation"" in class notice to be 
material to a reasonable person). Obviously, this information is helpful to class members. We strongly encourage the inclusion of 
such information in the future."
714,23," As previously defined, ""Settlement Documents"" is the term used in this opinion to refer collectively to the settlement notice and 
the summary notice. "
717,24," The record does not include evidence concerning the likelihood of maintaining the class through trial, though decertification is 
always possible as a case progresses and additional facts are developed. See Visa Check II, 192 F.R.D. at 89. "
718,25," By failing to plead it at the district court, Pasta Bella forfeited its argument that the Settlement perpetuated illegal price-fixing 
because it set a fixed interchange rate during the period from August 1, 2003 through December 31, 2003. See Krumme, 238 
F.3d at 142. "
719,26," The district court described the fee award as ""9.68% times the lodestar figure."" See Visa Check III, 297 F. Supp. 2d at 522. 
This is clearly a typographical error. "
721,27," As noted in subsection A of this Part, the lodestar method calculates attorneys' fees by multiplying hours reasonably expended 
against a reasonable hourly rate; courts may use their discretion to increase the lodestar by applying a multiplier based on 
factors such as the riskiness of the litigation and the quality of the attorneys. Here, the lodestar calculation yields $ 
62,940,045.84, Visa Check III, 297 F. Supp. 2d at 522, which is approximately 29% of the district court's award of $ 
220,290,160.44 to class counsel, id. at 507."
721,28," This argument is based on an assertion made by Lloyd Constantine, managing partner of Constantine & Partners, lead 
counsel, in a declaration submitted to the court. In that declaration, Mr. Constantine stated, ""I declare that the fee arrangement 
embodied in [the retention agreements C&P has with its large merchant clients] is much less favorable to the Class than the fee 
for which C&P has applied on behalf of itself and the 29 other Class Counsel firms."" Constantine Supp'l. Decl. P 8. Mr. 
Constantine offered to make these agreements available to the court for an inspection in camera. Id."
721,29," At the district court, Leonardo's failed to contest class counsel's fee petition. ""The law in this Circuit is clear that where a party 
has shifted his position on appeal and advances arguments available but not pressed below…. waiver will bar raising the issue 
on appeal."" United States v. Braunig, 553 F.2d 777, 780 (2d Cir. 1977). The Special Master found only one sentence addressing 
the fee petition in Leonardo's ten-page brief objecting to the Settlement. That sentence asked the court to ""carefully consider the 
amount of attorneys' fees and expenses requested by class counsel, an issue which Objectors expressly reserve for further 
argument when the matter of fees is considered."" Special Master's Report and Recommendation, at 18. The record is clear: 
Leonardo's did not preserve for appeal its challenge to the fee award. "
736,1," Specifically, this Order: (1) grants the Sherman Act Class Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment Declaring that the 
Abbott-Geneva Agreement Exceeded the Exclusionary Potential of the 207 Patent [D.E. 1192]; (2) grants Plaintiff Kaiser's 
Motion for Summary Judgment on Section One Claims [D.E. 1161]; (3) denies Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment on 
Sherman Act Section One (and Analogous) Claims [D.E. 1188]; (4) grants the Sherman Act Class Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial 
Summary Judgment for a Finding that the Abbott-Geneva Agreement Violates Section One of the Sherman Act [D.E. 1190-1]; 
(5) denies as moot the Sherman Act Class Plaintiffs' alternative Motion for Partial Summary Judgment for a Finding that a Quick-
Look Analysis Applies to the Agreement [D.E. 1190-2]; and (6) denies as moot the Sherman Act Class Plaintiffs' Motion for 
Partial Summary Judgment for a Ruling that Proof of Actual Anticompetitive Effects is Sufficient to Establish a Violation of 
Section One of the Sherman Act [D.E. 1194]. Although the parties filed five summary judgment motions as to the Section One 
claims, because the motion regarding the appropriate antitrust scrutiny has two alternative requests for relief, this Court's ruling 
effectively relates to six separate motions. "
737,2," On July 16, 2004, the parties submitted their Joint Statement of Facts Not in Dispute. [DE-1386]. For the purposes of 
conciseness and clarity, references to that Statement will be indicated as ""S. P    ."" In addition, references to the Federal Food,

737,4," The Individual Direct Purchasers are large entities (e.g., Walgreens, Shop-Rite) that purchased Hytrin directly from Abbott. The 
Indirect Purchaser classes are seventeen certified state classes of end payers for Hytrin consisting of Third Party Payers (e.g., 
insurance companies) and individual consumers. See In re Terazosin Hydrochloride, 220 F.R.D. 672 (S.D. Fla. 2004). Kaiser's 
action was transferred to this Court for consolidated MDL proceedings from the Central District of California. The State Plaintiffs 
represent the consumers from the states of Florida, Colorado, and Kansas."
737,5," HN1[
] Section One of the Sherman Antitrust Act prohibits ""every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations …."" 15 U.S.C. § 1. It is 
understood, however, that the ban on ""contract[s] in restraint of trade"" means only unreasonable restraints, that is, restraints that 
impair competition."" Valley Drug Co. v. Geneva Pharms., Inc., 344 F.3d 1294, 1303 (11th Cir. 2003) (internal citations omitted). "
738,6," The legislative policy behind Hatch-Waxman was to balance the need to preserve the incentive for brand name drug 
companies to develop new drugs with the public's interest in buying less expensive generic bioequivalent drugs. See Federal 
Trade Commission, Generic Drug Entry Prior to Patent Expiration: An FTC Study (July 2002) (noting that as of 2002, generics 
comprised 47% of the prescriptions filled in the United States, up from 19% in 1984). "
739,7," Until July 2000, FDA regulations provided that a ""court decision,"" in the context of the 30 month stay, meant a decision of an 
appellate court or a decision of a district court from which no appeal was taken. S. P 15 (citing 21 C.F.R. § 314.107(e) (1989))."
739,8," The Geneva litigation was consolidated with a case in which Abbott sued Novopharm -- another generic drug manufacturer -- 
also for infringement of the '207 patent. S. PP 112-13. As with Geneva, Novopharm admitted that its product contained Form IV 
terazosin hydrochloride but denied that the '207 patent was valid or enforceable. S. P 113. Within a week of one another, both 
Geneva and Novopharm filed motions for summary judgment in their respective litigation with Abbott, on the same grounds. S. 
PP 114-15. Nearly ten months later, in October 1997, Abbott sued a third generic drug manufacturer, Invamed, for infringing the 
'207 patent. S. P 117. That suit was also consolidated with those against Geneva and Novopharm. In the interest of clarity, the 
Court will refer to Geneva only as the Defendant in the underlying patent infringement action, as Geneva is the only one of the 
three defendants in the patent litigation that is a party to the instant case. "
740,9," ""Final Judgment in Geneva's Favor"" was defined as ""the entry pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 79(a) by the United 
States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in Case No. 96 C 3331 of a final, appealable judgment that Geneva's 
Terazosin Hydrochloride Products do not infringe or would not infringe any valid and enforceable claim of the '207 patent."" S. P 
185."
740,10," ""Final Judgment in Abbott's Favor"" was defined as ""the entry pursuant to the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 79(a) by the 
United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in Case No. 96 C 3331 of a final, appealable judgment that 
Geneva's Terazosin Hydrochloride Products infringed or would infringe any valid and enforceable claim of the '207 patent."" S. P 
184. "
741,11, See supra n.1.
741,12," The Sherman Act Class Plaintiffs' Motion seeks partial summary judgment -- specifically, an order declaring that the Abbott-
Geneva Agreement exceeded the exclusionary scope of the '207 patent -- while Kaiser captioned its motion as one for summary 
judgment on the Section One claims, without any limitations. However, upon review of the Motions, it is apparent that the 
Sherman Act Class Plaintiffs and Kaiser all seek the same relief: a ruling, in accordance with the Eleventh Circuit's directions on 
remand, that the challenged provision of the Abbott-Geneva Agreement delayed generic entry longer than the '207 patent would 
otherwise permit, and that the Agreement cannot be justified by the likely outcome of the '207 patent litigation. "
742,13," The Eleventh Circuit adopted as precedent decisions of the former Fifth Circuit rendered prior to October 1, 1981. See Bonner 
v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981). "
743,14," In their Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, the Sherman Act Class Plaintiffs acknowledge that ""since the Eleventh Circuit's 
ruling . . . Plaintiffs have focused their case (with respect to alleged actual anti-competitive effects) on the Agreement's 
prohibition on Geneva's entering the market regardless of whether the district court presiding over the '207 litigation found the 
patent invalid on summary judgment."" See DE-1192 at n. 14. At the July 2, 2004, Oral Argument, counsel for the Sherman Act 
Class Plaintiffs further confirmed that their only challenge to the Agreement, for purposes of these Motions, is the provision that 
provided for a restraint on competition going beyond the September 1998 date when the patent was found invalid. See Tr. [DE-
1385] at 149-151. "
745,15," Although the '207 patent includes four claims, in the underlying patent litigation, Abbott only asserted infringement of claim 4, 
which defines the claimed crystalline form of anhydrous terazosin hydrochloride (Form IV) in terms of an analytical method 
called x-ray powder diffractometry."
745,16," The Agreement prevented Geneva from selling, offering for sale, donating or otherwise distributing in the United States ""any 
Terazosin Hydrochloride Product"" until after the earlier of the Generic Entry Date or the Appellate Judgment (as both terms are 
defined in Section I.C., above). See Ex. 1, Tab A at P 20, Exs. to Defs.' Mot. for Summ. J. on Sherman Act Section One (and 
Analogous Claims). In turn, ""Terazosin Hydrochloride Product"" is defined as ""any pharmaceutical product, regardless of 
formulation or dosage form (tablet, capsule, etc.) containing terazosin hydrochloride."" Although the restriction on Geneva's 
marketing of any terazosin hydrochloride product appears to extend well beyond the protections of the patent, this issue is not 
before the Court at this time given Plaintiffs' narrowing of their Section One claims. See supra n.14. However, because the 
Eleventh Circuit directed the Court to assess whether the challenged provision may be justified as ancillary to another 
agreement (which, together with the challenged provision, could have the overall effect of enhancing competition), the Court will 
briefly address this issue later in its analysis. "
746,17," On August 31, 2004, this Court granted Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment on Sherman Act Section Two (and 
Analogous) Claims, and denied Kaiser's Motion for Summary Judgment on Sham Litigation. See In re Terazosin Hydrochloride 
Antitrust Litig., 335 F. Supp. 2d 1336 (S.D. Fla. 2004). Section Two of the Sherman Antitrust Act makes it a felony for any 
""person [to] monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any 
part of the trade or commerce among the Several States …."" 15 U.S.C. § 2. In its Order, the Court concluded that Plaintiffs failed 
to show that any of Abbott's seventeen patent infringement lawsuits were objectively baseless or that Abbott had a subjective 
bad-faith intent to abuse the judicial process in violation of the Sherman Act. Id. In connection with the '207 patent, this Court 
held that there was no record evidence of fraud or an attempt to commit fraud to procure the '207 patent. Id. Of course, that 
holding does not preclude a finding here that the PTO's conclusions are not entitled to deference because the examiner did not 
have before him one of the key cases upon which the ""on-sale bar"" issue hinged."
746,18," Walker Process Equip., Inc. v. Food Much. & Chem. Corp., 382 U.S. 172, 15 L. Ed. 2d 247, 86 S. Ct. 347 (1965). "
748,19, See supra n. 13. 
749,20," The Court thus rejects Plaintiffs' reliance, in assessing Abbott's chances of obtaining a preliminary injunction pending appeal, 
on the District Court's decision regarding invalidity. While the decision is strong evidence that the District Court would not have 
issued a preliminary injunction, the relevant analysis requires this Court to situate itself in the world as it existed on April 1, 1998, 
when no decision as to validity had been rendered."
749,21," The Eleventh Circuit went on to explain the justification for its decision that the Court cannot be guided by the subsequent 
invalidity of the patent. HN19[
] ""Exposing settling parties to antitrust liability for the exclusionary effects of a settlement 
reasonably within the scope of the patent merely because the patent is subsequently declared invalid would undermine the 
patent incentives. Patent litigation is too complex and the results too uncertain for parties to accurately forecast whether 
enforcing the exclusionary right through settlement will expose them to treble damages if the patent immunity were destroyed by 
the mere invalidity of the patent."" Valley Drug, 344 F.3d at 1308. This Court, therefore, is not considering the subsequent 
invalidity of the patent, but rather is assessing the chances, gauged as of April 1, 1998, of Abbott succeeding in defending its 
patent. "
750,22," The four policies underlying § 102(b) are: (1) discouraging removal of inventions from the public domain that the public 
reasonably has come to believe are freely available; (2) encouraging the prompt and widespread disclosure of inventions; (3) 
allowing an inventor a reasonable amount of time following sales activity to determine the potential economic value of a patent; 
and (4) prohibiting an inventor from commercially exploiting his invention beyond the statutorily prescribed time. In re Mahurkar 
Hemodialysis Catheter, 71 F.3d 1573, 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1995); see also UMC Elecs. v. United States, 816 F.2d 647, 652 (Fed. Cir. 
1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1025, 98 L. Ed. 2d 761, 108 S. Ct. 748 (1988). At the time of the Agreement, Federal Circuit 
precedent required an analysis of the totality of the circumstances for application of the § 102(b) bar, considered in view of these 
underlying policy justifications. Mahurkar, 71 F.3d at 1577. It was undisputed in the '207 patent litigation that the third and fourth 
justifications were not implicated because the sales at issue were made by a third party and not by the inventor. And further, the 
second policy justification was not implicated since it was undisputed that Abbott moved promptly to disclose its invention 
through the patent process. Therefore, the only policy justification that was possibly implicated was the first one."
750,23," Plaintiffs argue that LaPorte barred Abbott's ""conception"" argument in the '207 case. See D.E. 1192 at 15 (citing LaPorte, 787 
F.2d at 1583). In LaPorte, cutter extensions for hydraulic dredges used to dredge river channel bottoms were invented in 1977. "
751,," The inventor used the cutter extensions successfully in 1977 and 1978. Id. at 1579. In 1978, a client of the inventor, a consulting 
engineer, photographed the invention with the inventor's permission and in his presence. Id. In 1979, the consulting engineer 
gave a copy of the photo to the president of LaPorte, a dredging company. Id. On November 4, 1980, LaPorte's president 
ordered the cutter extension from the consulting engineer: the consulting engineer notified the inventor of this transaction to 
which the inventor replied: ""no problem."" Id. Ultimately, the inventor, the consulting engineer, and LaPorte agreed to seek a 
patent for the cutter extensions and the application was filed on December 7, 1981. Id. The court held that the ""on-sale bar"" 
applied because: (1) there had been a sale in November 1980, more than one year prior to the patent application date; (2) the 
fact that the sale occurred between third parties was not relevant; and (3) importantly, the invention had been produced from the 
embodiment of the original invention (i.e., the photograph). Id. at 1583."
751,24," Indeed, as the Sherman Act Class Plaintiffs note in their Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, acceptance of Abbott's 
argument -- that a sale under § 102(b) must disclose all particulars of an invention, not just the invention itself -- not only would 
have contravened LaPorte, but also would have plainly frustrated the first policy underlying 102(b). ""Under Abbott's argument, if 
Geneva had been buying and using terazosin for ten, fifteen or twenty years, but did not know its x-ray diffraction pattern . . . 
Abbott could still come along one day, snap its special x-ray pictures, file a patent and force Geneva off the market."" See Pls.' 
Mot. for Part. Summ. J.. at 17. Such a result would certainly run afoul of the policy discouraging removal of inventions from the 
public domain that the public had come to rely upon."
751,25," Although there are three other elements that courts examine in deciding whether a preliminary injunction should issue, the 
failure to demonstrate likelihood of success on the merits is fatal to Abbott's chances of obtaining injunctive relief. See New 
England Braiding, 970 F.2d at 880-85 (Fed. Cir. 1992); Reebok, 32 F.3d at 1556; see also Amazon.com. Inc., 239 F.3d at 1350- "
752,51," . The Court, therefore, need not even reach the remaining factors of the injunction test. Glaxo Group Ltd. v. Ranbaxy Pharms., 
Inc., 262 F.3d 1333, 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2001)."
752,26," Further, given the record in the patent infringement action, once the District Court found the patent to be invalid, it was even 
less likely that Abbott could obtain a stay pending appeal. HN21[
] The standard for obtaining a stay pending appeal is 
essentially the same as that for obtaining a preliminary injunction, only the movant is required to demonstrate a ""strong showing 
that he is likely to succeed on the merits."" See Standard Havens Prods., Inc. v. Gencor Indus., Inc., 897 F.2d 511, 513 (Fed. Cir. 
1990). Given the weakness of Abbott's challenge to the application of the ""on-sale bar,"" it is highly unlikely that the District or 
Appeals Court would have granted a stay pending appeal of the invalidation ruling. Indeed, Defendants have not cited any cases 
in which a stay pending appeal was granted in favor of a patentee whose patent was invalidated before the District Court."
752,27," Of course, Defendants most prominent argument for the reasonableness of the challenged provision is that injunctive relief 
was a reasonable possibility in the '207 patent litigation, and that the delay of generic entry through appellate resolution of the 
infringement action was therefore within the exclusionary potential of the patent. As this argument has been addressed 
extensively earlier in this Order, it is not repeated here in the third step of the Court's analysis."
752,28," Expanding on the ""backdrop of mutual risk and uncertainty,"" Defendants state that Abbott's risk was that if it failed to obtain 
injunctive relief, it would have suffered enormous financial damages at the hands of a small generic company that might well not 
be able to satisfy a judgment in Abbott's favor if Abbott ultimately prevailed in the litigation. See Defs.' Brief at 4. Geneva's risk, 
in turn, was that if it defeated preliminary injunctive relief and marketed its product, it would have put itself at risk of a ruinous "
753,," damages award against it in the litigation. And, if Geneva had brought its product to market and subsequently been preliminarily 
enjoined, it would have lost forever its claim to the 180-day exclusivity period once it had been triggered."
753,29," Defendants object to the Court's consideration of what the Agreement actually settled, arguing that because the Eleventh 
Circuit did not identify it as a factor to be addressed on remand, it is inappropriate for this Court to do so. However, the Eleventh 
Circuit's opinion was not a precise delineation of factors to be considered on remand. In fact, the Circuit noted that its holding at 
that early stage of the litigation was ""appropriately narrow,"" and it was merely ""offering several observations with respect to the 
framework to be developed on remand for deciding the appropriate antitrust analysis."" Valley Drug, 344 F.3d at 1306. The 
Circuit's decision, therefore, cannot be seen as prohibiting the consideration of other factors, including one -- such as the reality 
of what the agreement actually resolved -- that is so central to any discussion of the reasonableness of a settlement agreement."
753,30," Affording such deference to settlements would ignore the realities of patent litigations and disregard the competitive 
implications of settlement accords. As Hovenkamp recognized, uncertainty may itself encourage collusive agreements; 
therefore, where the parties are in a position of uncertainty regarding the scope and or validity of a patent, there is particular 
concern that the resulting settlement agreement may represent an unlawful restraint. See Hovenkamp, et al., 87 Minn. L. Rev. at 
1722 (""Incentives to collude are hardly reduced by the fact that a dispute concerns IP. To the contrary, the uncertain scope and 
validity of IP rights may encourage a collusive settlement, serving both to remove the uncertainty and to permit the two firms to 
share monopoly profits.""). "
754,31," The question of whether the challenged provision is reasonably ancillary to the Agreement's procompetitive core is more 
appropriately addressed in Section IV, below, in which the antitrust implications of the Agreement are explored. This issue is 
raised here because Defendants asserted it in connection with their Motion regarding the exclusionary scope of the patent, but it 
will be addressed more fully below. "
755,32," HN27[
] The Supreme Court has held that it is the court's experience with the type of restraint that is relevant in applying the 
per se rule, not the industry or the precise factual circumstances of the case. Arizona v. Maricopa County Med. Soc'y, 457 U.S. 
332, 357, 73 L. Ed. 2d 48, 102 S. Ct. 2466 (1982); see also Louisiana Wholesale Drug Co. v. Hoechst Marion Roussel, Inc. (In 
re Cardizem CD Antitrust Litig.), 332 F.3d 896, 900 (6th Cir. 2003). Therefore, Defendants cannot avoid the per se rule by 
arguing that courts have not had enough experience with agreements of this kind in the pharmaceutical industry. "
756,33," The Sherman Act Class Plaintiffs ask the Court not only to apply the quick look approach, but also to conclude that the 
Agreement violates Section One of the Sherman Act under such an analysis. See Quick-Look Motion at p. 2. As a fallback 
approach, if the Court finds that any factual questions preclude summary judgment, the Sherman Act Class Plaintiffs request 
that the Court merely hold that the quick-look approach applies to the Agreement, leaving the question of whether the 
Agreement actually violates the Sherman Act under such an analysis to the jury. Id. at n.2. "
757,34," There is no question here that this case presents a ""horizontal"" agreement. For purposes of this analysis. no distinction is 
made between actual competitors (i.e., those currently competing in the same market) and potential competitors. See Palmer, 
498 U.S. at 46-48. Further, HN33[
] courts have recognized that the mere filing of an ANDA is sufficient evidence that generic 
drug companies are competitors of brand-name manufacturers. See Ciprofloxacin, 261 F. Supp. 2d at 239 (citing In re Buspirone 
Patent Litig., 185 F. Supp. 2d 340, 343 (S.D.N.Y. 2002)). Similarly, challenging patents through litigation is a form of competition. 
Id. at 240 (citing United States v. Line Material Co., 333 U.S. 287, 319, 92 L. Ed. 701, 68 S. Ct. 550 (1948)(Douglas, J., 
concurring)). "
758,35," Other courts have recognized the negative effect on competition where a settlement creates a ""bottleneck"" for future ANDA 
filers. See Ciprofloxacin, 261 F. Supp. 2d at 242. In Ciprofloxacin, the District Court distinguished its case from the case at bar, 
observing that the Abbott-Geneva Agreement ""delayed triggering Geneva's 180-day exclusivity period, effectively holding up 
FDA approval of other generic manufacturers' ANDA IVs."" Id. at 243. This was particularly true because Geneva, unlike the 
generic ANDA applicant in the Ciprofloxacin case, did not agree to relinquish its rights to the exclusivity period provided by the 
Hatch-Waxman Act, but instead indicated, in the Agreement itself, that it intended ""to use its best efforts to obtain any statutory 
period of exclusive marketing lo which it may be entitled under 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(4)(B)(iv)."" See Ex. 1. Tab A at P 25, Exs. to 
Defs.' Mot. for Summ. J. on Sherman Act Section One (and Analogous Claims)."
758,36," The Eleventh Circuit disagreed with the Sixth Circuit's approach in Cardizem, because that Court did not conduct an analysis 
of the exclusionary potential of the patent and also placed considerable reliance on the size of the exit payments. Nonetheless, 
the Cardizem court's analysis of the likely anticompetitive effects of the challenged agreement and the application of the per se 
rule remains relevant to this Court's analysis. The agreement in that case, like the Abbott-Geneva Agreement here, did not 
resolve the underlying patent litigation but rather represented what the parties termed an ""interim settlement."" Further, the 
Cardizem agreement resulted in a ""bottleneck"" for future ANDA filers. In these respects, the facts of the Cardizem case are 
factually closer to this case than those that other courts reviewing patent settlements in the pharmaceutical context have 
addressed. See Ciprofloxacin, 261 F. Supp. 2d at 242-44; see also Tamoxifen, 277 F. Supp. 2d at 133. "
759,37," Defendants rely on Troxel Mfg. Co. v. Schwinn Bicycle Co., 465 F.2d 1253, 1255 (6th Cir. 1972), to support their contention 
that Abbott was not ""evicted"" from its rights under the '207 patent until the Federal Circuit's final appellate resolution of the ""on-
sale bar"" issue. In Troxel, the Sixth Circuit held that ""a final [appellate] adjudication of invalidity of a licensed patent operates as 
an eviction from the license, terminating the licensee's obligation to continue making royalty payments after that date by giving 
no right to recoup royalties already paid."" Id. at 1255 (citing Drackett Chem. Co. v. Chamberlain Co., 63 F.2d 853, 855 (6th Cir. 
1933)). However, Troxel is not binding precedent in either the Federal or the Eleventh Circuit. Further, Troxel dealt with a 
situation inapposite to the instant case."
759,38," It is also important to note that the Agreement did not ""maintain the status quo,"" but rather provided for a large payment from 
the patent holder to its competitor to delay generic entry. A true ""status quo"" situation would have emerged if Geneva, 
recognizing the potential for a ""ruinous"" damages award, agreed not to market its generic product until resolution of the '207 
appeals without any payments from Abbott. Instead, the parties altered the ""status quo"" through an agreement that included 
significant reverse payments. "
760,39," The Court's focus primarily has been on whether one particular provision of the Agreement, the appellate-stay provision, 
exceeded the scope of the patent. However, the challenged provision, in accordance with the Eleventh Circuit's opinion, cannot 
be viewed ""in isolation"" but rather in the context of the Agreement as a whole. This inclusive approach lends itself to two different 
possible conclusions: (1) if the larger Agreement as a whole has a procompetitive or efficiency-enhancing purpose, then the 
challenged provision may be justified as ancillary to such a purpose; or (2) if the Agreement has no overriding procompetitive 
justification and the restraint is classified as ""naked"" rather than ""ancillary,"" then the Court can declare the Agreement, and not 
just certain parts of it, to constitute a per se violation of the Sherman Act. As the Court has concluded that the Agreement did not 
have any procompetitive or efficiency-enhancing purpose to which the restraint was ancillary, this case presents the Court with 
the latter situation. "
761,40," That being said, the Court is persuaded that Abbot has power in the relevant market, which is the market for Hytrin and its 
generic bioequivalent forms of terazosin hydrochloride. Indeed, in cases such as this, ""the very fact that the pioneer finds it 
worthwhile to pay a large exclusion payment tends to establish market power."" Herbert Hovenkamp, Mark D. Janis & Mark A. 
Lemley, IP AND ANTITRUST: AN ANALYSIS OF ANTITRUST PRINCIPLES APPLIED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAW 
(2004) at 7-37. Although the Court does not find the mere size of the exclusion payment, based on the limited record presented 
on the issue, to support a finding of illegality, such a significant payment as part of an interim settlement agreement does 
indicate that the pioneer exercises substantial power in the market. ""It also suggests some inherent uncertainty as to the validity 
or scope of the patent."" Id. "
795,1," For the sake of clarity, plaintiff in this action shall be referred to as AgrEvo EH, the original plaintiff, unless a distinction is 
germane to a particular discussion."
795,2," AgrEvo EH contends that Scotts planned to relaunch Finale under the brand name ""Final!."" Unless relevant, all references 
within this Order shall be to Finale. "
796,3, The scope of Scotts' divestiture is disputed by the parties. 
798,4," ""Standing"" in this context is used to denote the right to sue rather than the existence of jurisdiction. See Asahi Glass Co. v. 
Pentech Pharms., Inc., 289 F. Supp. 2d 986, 990 (N.D. Ill. 2003) (J. Posner sitting by designation). "
800,5," These cases follow the logic, established in other antitrust contexts, that HN12[
] coordinated activity of a parent and its 
wholly owned subsidiary cannot give rise to an antitrust violation since the parent and subsidiary in such a case always share a 
complete unity of interest. See Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 768-69, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628, 104 S. 
Ct. 2731 (1984). "
801,6," HN14[
] ""Restraints imposed by agreement between competitors have traditionally been denominated as horizontal restraints, 
and those imposed by agreement between firms at different levels of distribution as vertical restraints."" Business Elecs. Corp. v. 
Sharp Elecs. Corps., 485 U.S. 717, 730, 99 L. Ed. 2d 808, 108 S. Ct. 1515 (1988). The characterization of an agreement as 
either ""horizontal"" or ""vertical"" has important implications under the antitrust laws and to the ensuing discussion. "
802,7," Without making a final ruling as to the admissibility of this evidence at trial, for the purposes of this Order this evidence is 
deemed to be an admission against interest. See Fed. R. Evid. 801. "
805,8," The parties do not dispute that on October 21, 2001, Aventis invoiced Scotts for 50% of Scotts' alleged GA purchase shortfall 
of $ 11,768,000, or $ 5,884,000, and that Scotts paid this invoice in full. "
807,9," Though these holdings do not speak to what may or may not be considered appropriate damages should a jury find Scotts 
liable for breach of the implied covenant of good faith, I do reiterate that the alleged commitments by Scotts to spend $ 15 million 
on advertising and to achieve a 25% market share are not obligations under the GA Supply Agreement. Therefore, damages, if 
any, need not necessarily relate to the sales that would have occurred had these two commitments been fulfilled."
807,10," Section 12.1 reads: ""Except as to Affiliates, neither party may assign its rights or delegate its performance hereunder, whether 
by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably 
withheld; and any attempted assignment or delegation or transfer without such consent shall be void."""
807,11," The parties do not address, and I do not reach, the issue of whether the assignment to Farnam would constitute a breach of 
the GA Supply Agreement in light of the requirement that consent to assignment ""shall not be unreasonably withheld."" "
809,12," If Section 20(ii) were enforceable, whether Scotts did engage in good faith negotiations would be a question of fact for the jury 
to consider, and, therefore, Scotts does not submit evidence on this point. "
810,13," AgrEvo EH could have moved for reconsideration of the dismissal within ten days of entry of the order on June 20, 2000. See 
Local Rules of the U.S. Dist. Courts for the S.D.N.Y. and E.D.N.Y., Rule 6.3 HN38[
] (""A notice of motion for reconsideration or 
reargument of a court order determining a motion shall be served within ten (10) days after the entry of the court's determination 
of the original motion"") (emphasis in original). Raising the issue in an opposition brief four years after the original order certainly 
does not comport with Local Rule 6.3. Additionally, if after the ten-day period AgrEvo EH felt that newly discovered facts could 
have affected my previous order, a motion could have been brought within a reasonable amount of time pursuant to Rule 60(b) 
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure seeking relief from the prior order. No such motion was ever filed. "
812,14," Having held above that AgrEvo EH has standing to assert claims on behalf of its affiliates, AgrEvo GmbH and AgrEvo USA, I 
need not consider Defendants' argument that Dr. Martin's damage testimony ought to be excluded for failure to disaggregate lost 
profits damages. "
827,1," Except where otherwise noted, the following facts are taken from the First Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint. The 
factual allegations found there are assumed true for purposes of this motion."
827,2," The plaintiffs define the class as: All persons or entities who purchased Carbon Black from Defendants or their co-conspirators, in the United States between 
January 1, 1999 to the present (the ""Class period""). Excluded from the class are (1) Defendants and their affiliates, 
subsidiaries and co-conspirators and (2) any federal, state and local government purchasers. (Compl. P 21.) "
828,3," The plaintiffs allege additional facts regarding the market that they believe made it easier for the defendants to collude such as 
the periodic, predictable nature of sales and the economic forces that affect them. As will be noted below, these conditions also 
could explain uniformity of price in the absence of collusion. For the purposes of the pending motion to dismiss, however, I draw 
inferences in favor of the non-moving party, here, the plaintiffs. "
829,4," The entire footnote is informative: United has also advanced the argument that because the earliest impact on Hanover of United's lease only policy occurred 
in 1912, Hanover's cause of action arose during that year and is now barred by the applicable Pennsylvania statute of 
limitations. . . . We are not dealing with a violation which, if it occurs at all, must occur within some specific and limited time 
span. Rather, we are dealing with conduct which constituted a continuing violation of the Sherman Act and which inflicted 
continuing and accumulating harm on Hanover. Although Hanover could have sued in 1912 for the injury then being 
inflicted, it was equally entitled to sue in 1955. Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Mach. Corp., 392 U.S. 481, 502 n.15, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1231, 88 S. Ct. 2224 (1968) (citation 
omitted). "
831,5," Anti-competitive behavior in the absence of an agreement -- depending on its nature -- may fall under Section 2 of the Sherman 
Act, which provides that ""every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other 
person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations shall be 
deemed guilty of a felony. . . ."" 15 U.S.C. § 2."
831,6," ""There is a closely related but analytically distinct type of claim, also based on § 1 of the Sherman Act, where the violation lies 
in the information exchange itself -- as opposed to using the information exchange as evidence upon which to infer a price-fixing 
agreement. This exchange of information is not illegal per se, but can be found unlawful under a rule of reason analysis."" Todd v. 
Exxon Corp., 275 F.3d 191, 198 (2d Cir. 2001). The plaintiffs, however, have not pled an ""information exchange"" violation of the 
Sherman Act. "
832,7," In so doing, the defendants cite the Third Circuit opinion in In re Baby Food Antitrust Litig., where the court applied the 
Supreme Court holding ""that conduct as consistent with permissible competition as with illegal conspiracy, does not, standing 
alone, support an inference of antitrust conspiracy."" 166 F.3d 112, 124 (3d Cir. 1999) (quoting Matsushita Electric Indus. Co. v. 
Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 588, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538, 106 S. Ct. 1348 (1986)). Even assuming Baby Food is persuasive, the 
defendants fail to note that the Baby Food court was reviewing the lower court's decision at the motion for summary judgment 
stage. The obstacles facing the nonmoving party at summary judgment are of a different dimension. Accordingly, here I rely for "
833,," the most part on decisions dealing with the core question before me, ""how much evidence of an illegal agreement must antitrust 
plaintiffs plead to avoid dismissal for failure to state a claim?"" In re Compact Disc Minimum Advertised Price Antitrust Litigation, 
138 F. Supp. 2d 25, 26 (D. Me. 2001). The answer is certainly some quantum less than will be required at later stages of this 
litigation. "
834,8," For the reasons stated above, only purchasers of carbon black after January 30, 1999 may recover as members of the class."
834,9," Rule 23(b)(3) provides: HN12[
] (b) . . . An action may be maintained as a class action if the prerequisites of subdivision (a) are satisfied, and in 
addition: (3) the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any 
questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair 
and efficient adjudication of the controversy. The matters pertinent to the findings include: (A) the interest of members 
of the class in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions; (B) the extent and nature of any 
litigation concerning the controversy already commenced by or against members of the class; (C) the desirability or 
undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum; (D) the difficulties likely to be 
encountered in the management of a class action. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). "
835,10," HN14[
] There is an open question, however, regarding to what extent courts may examine the merits of the plaintiffs' claim 
and make factual inquiries when deciding a motion to certify a class. The Second Circuit, for instance, does not permit its district 
courts to look further than the allegations presented in the complaint. See Caridad v. Metro-North Commuter R.R., 191 F.3d 283, 
291-93 (2d Cir. 1999). The Third, Fourth, and Seventh Circuits, on the other hand, ""require a district court to make factual and 
legal inquiries beyond the allegations in the complaint if such inquiries are necessary to an informed ruling on class certification."" 
In re Polymedica Corp. Securities Litig., 224 F.R.D. 27, 35 (D. Mass 2004). Recently, in a securities case, Judge Keeton 
observed that while ""the First Circuit has not addressed the issue squarely . . . it appears to favor a more searching inquiry."" Id. 
at 34. In any event, all courts seem to agree that whatever the inquiry, it may only go so far as necessary to resolve the 
questions raised by the Rule 23 requirements. It is not entirely clear, therefore, where the lines of the debate are actually drawn. 
For present purposes, I assess the allegations in the complaint in light of the entire record presented to me on the motion for 
class certification. Therefore, while the plaintiffs' allegations and expert opinions will be given considerable weight and will 
benefit from reasonable inferences, my conclusions are informed by the record submissions of the defendants as well. "
836,11," The size of the class will be relevant to the remaining analysis: The interrelationship of the numerosity prerequisite and some of the other class action requirements should be noted. For 
example, the requirement in subdivision (a)(4) that the representatives adequately protect the interests of all members of 
the class is a peculiarly significant requirement when the class is very large. Furthermore, because of the mandatory notice 
requirement applicable in actions brought under Rule 23(b)(3) and the binding effect of the judgment on all class members, 
a few courts have suggested that concerns about size may have increased importance. Again, however, the concern these 
courts are expressing is not whether Rule 23(a)(1) has been satisfied but whether it is proper to bind all members of the 
class and whether it is feasible to give them all proper notice."
836,7," A Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1762 (2004) (footnotes omitted). "
837,12," That does not, however, resolve the question under 23(b)(3) whether these common issues predominate.; the defendants 
contend they do not. That question will be addressed below. "
838,13," See also In re Catfish Antitrust Litig., 826 F. Supp. 1019, 1036 (N.D. Miss. 1993): HN22[
] There is nothing in Rule 23(a)(3) which requires the named plaintiffs to be clones of each other or clones of other class members. The diversity of named plaintiffs who differ in their methods of operation and conduct is often cited by 
defendants as an impediment to class certification. However, as long as the substance of the claim is the same as it would 
be for other class members, then the claims of the named plaintiffs are not atypical."
838,14," The defendants, however, do not concede that the other elements of 23(a) have been met. Rather, they emphasize correctly 
that it is the plaintiff's burden to make an adequate showing on each of the pertinent Rule 23(a) and (b) requirements. "
840,15," The Rule continues: The matters pertinent to the findings include: (A) the interest of members of the class in individually controlling the 
prosecution or defense of separate actions; (B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already 
commenced by or against members of the class; (C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the 
claims in the particular forum; (D) the difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a class action. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)."
840,16," A different approach taken by courts on the question of impact was summarized by the court in In re Industrial Diamonds 
Antitrust Litig., 167 F.R.D. 374 (S.D.N.Y. 1996): Some courts have held that common questions predominate because ""as a general rule, an illegal price-fixing scheme 
presumptively impacts upon all purchasers of a price-fixed product in a conspiratorially affected market."" Other courts have 
stressed the need for a careful examination of the facts of each case in order to determine whether common proof of impact 
is possible. As the Bogosian court put it: When an antitrust violation impacts upon a class of persons . . ., there is no reason in doctrine why proof of the impact 
cannot be made on a common basis so long as the common proof adequately demonstrates some damage to each 
individual. Whether or not [impact] can be proven on a common basis therefore depends upon the circumstances of 
each case. As a practical matter, it often makes little difference which view the court espouses. The presumption [that a price-fixing 
scheme impacts all purchasers] . . . is, at most, a general rule. Antitrust defendants are free to argue, as many of them do, 
that their cases are exceptional because too many variables enter into setting prices in their industries to permit common 
proof of impact. Id. at 382 (citations and footnote omitted). In this case, I do not apply an automatic presumption, but the reasoning behind its 
application by some courts -- namely, that an overarching price-fixing conspiracy likely has an impact on all purchasers -- 
informs the analysis of the Rule 23(b)(3) requirement. "
841,17," (See 9/02/04 Beyer Dep., at 177-78: I'm taking the conspiracy as alleged by the Plaintiffs as true. But the causal relationship between the conspiracy and the 
behavior of prices is outside the realm of examining the question would all customers be affected if this conspiracy were 
true. The cause -- actual causal relationship between the conspiracy, if it existed, and prices that would be different in that 
condition than they actually were is something to be examined later. And the question that you've posed would probably be 
an important question to be addressed. But I -- it is not necessary to address that question to arrive at an answer that 
seems to me relevant with respect to impact, namely, have all consumers of carbon black been adversely affected by -- or 
would they be by this conspiracy as alleged. And I set you the reasons in my report of why I believe -- and the whole source 
of consideration -- economic theory from the Defendants about the purchasers and from the transaction database why I 
believe that to be the case.)"
841,18," ""This conclusion is based on the following economic considerations: A. The Defendants jointly enjoy market power, thus preventing purchasers of carbon black from avoiding the effect of 
coordinated pricing. . The Defendants jointly control a substantial portion of both the production capacity and total sales of carbon black in the 
U.S. . There are significant barriers to new firms entering the market to produce carbon black. . There are no substitutes for carbon black. Hence the demand for carbon black is price inelastic. B. Carbon black is a commodity-like product. In economic terms, carbon black is an undifferentiated product, and hence 
price is the principal basis on which Class members make their decisions concerning the suppliers from which to purchase 
carbon black. C. The commodity nature of carbon black is reinforced by a formal grading system for rubber-grade and industry cross-
walks' for industrial grade carbon black. D. All Defendants make and sell most grades of carbon black, or have the capacity to do so. The degree of product overlap 
means Class members would have benefited from more active price competition in the absence of the alleged coordinated 
price behavior. E. All Defendants sell carbon black throughout the United States. This geographic reach and overlap means all Class 
members would have benefited from more active price competition in the absence of the alleged coordinated price 
behavior. F. During the period of the alleged conspiracy, the carbon black industry was operating with excess capacity. The existence 
of excess capacity implies that, in the absence of the alleged coordinated price behavior, Class members would have 
benefited from more competitive pricing. G. My empirical analysis of Defendants' sales transactions indicates a similarity in movement of carbon black prices over 
time. This demonstrates that carbon black prices are affected by similar forces, such as the alleged coordinate price 
behavior of the Defendants."" (Beyer Aff. P 8A-G.) "
842,19," The court later added that it could not exclude the possibility that there will be some individualized questions pertaining to impact. It perhaps even is likely that the 
prices paid by some class members will have to be compared to a construct of the prices that would have prevailed absent 
the alleged conspiracy in order to determine whether they in fact were injured by it. But the Court is persuaded, at least on 
the present record, that the impact question is quite predominantly a common question. Auction Houses, 193 F.R.D. 162 at 167. "
843,20," The plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Beyer, submitted an affidavit as well as a reply affidavit. Mr. Kaplan, the defendants' expert, also 
submitted an initial affidavit as well as an affidavit filed with the defendants' sur-reply. "
844,21," Excluded under this scenario would be those who purchased non-list price products that were neither deemed comparable by 
reference to one of the defendant's comparison charts nor were tied to the price of a list price product pursuant to a contractual 
provision or formula."
844,22," The expert in Paper Systems applied an econometric regression technique, ""a commonly accepted tool to make [assessments 
regarding whether prices were higher than they otherwise would have been] and to evaluate whether there is common impact 
from an alleged price-fixing conspiracy."" Id. at 615. "
846,23," I do note, however, that on May 5, 2004 I permitted one tire manufacturer, Goodyear Tire and Rubber, to intervene for the 
limited purposes of gaining access to discovery. To date, Goodyear has sought no broader intervention. "
849,1," In Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial, Plaintiffs presented claims of monopolization, attempted 
monopolization, and tortious interference. In an opinion dated February 23, 2003, this Court dismissed those claims on summary 
judgment. Carpet Group Int'l v. Oriental Rug Importers Ass'n, Inc., 256 F. Supp. 2d 249 (D.N.J. 2003)."
849,2, Id. 
851,3," Plaintiffs argue that the Third Circuit's decision in Carpet Group Int'l v. ORIA, 227 F.3d 62 (3d Cir. 2000), suggests that a 
finding of conspiracy, without more, would be sufficient to prove injury and entitle Plaintiffs to damages. (Pls.' Mem. Supp. Mot. 
Post-J. Relief at 3-4.) The Third Circuit's findings were made in the context of Defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of subject 
matter jurisdiction. See Carpet Group Int'l v. ORIA, 227 F.3d at 62. In the referenced decision, the Third Circuit's opinion 
addressed the issue of whether there was sufficient evidence to show that the challenged conduct occurred in interstate 
commerce. As noted by the Third Circuit, ""plaintiffs burden of establishing effects on commerce sufficient to confer jurisdiction 
under the Sherman Act is not great."" Id. at 75. The Third Circuit's opinion did not, nor could it, make any dispositive finding 
regarding proof of an antitrust injury. While the Third Circuit's opinion did note that Plaintiffs' ability to ""prove at trial that the 
alleged conspiracy actually exists"" would support an affirmative conclusion regarding the effect of the conspiracy, the opinion 
resolved a jurisdictional question. Id. at 74 (citation omitted). Contrary to Plaintiffs' contention, the Third Circuit's opinion did not 
find that there was an anticompetitive injury. Even if the Third Circuit's opinion found a per se violation, ""the per se rule is a 
method of determining whether Section I of the Sherman Act has been violated, but it does not indicate whether a private plaintiff 
has suffered antitrust injury and thus whether he may recover damages under § 4 of the Clayton Act."" Atlantic Richfield Co. v. 
USA Petroleum Co., 495 U.S. 328, 342, 110 S. Ct. 1884, 109 L. Ed. 2d 333 (1990). "
852,4," Plaintiffs state that ""in the face of [the] evidence, there is no rational explanation for the jury's finding that there was no injury 
caused by the conspiracy. And that finding is wholly inconsistent with the jury's other findings. That is, the jury found there was a 
conspiracy, that the goal of the conspiracy was to injure plaintiffs, and that actions were taken in furtherance of the conspiracy."" 
(Pls.' Mem. Supp. Mot. Post-J. Relief at 21-22.)"
852,5," In light of Plaintiffs' failure to satisfy the second prong of the standard, this Court finds there is no need to reach the question of 
whether Plaintiffs satisfy the third prong relating to damages. "
853,6," Plaintiffs' memorandum in support of their motion for a new trial does not include a transcript citation. Therefore, we infer that 
Plaintiffs' arguments relate to Mr. Stone's testimony regarding whether ""it is even possible for a group of importers in the United 
States to eliminate a type of trade show from their global economy"". (Hr'g T., Dec. 9, 2003 at 1242.) "
856,7," Plaintiffs assert that there is ""undisputed"" evidence that they and the Pakistani manufacturers were interested in a trade show 
in 2003. (Pls.' Reply to Defs.' Br. in Opp'n Pls.' Mot. Post-J. Relief at 14.) This Court cannot locate, nor do Plaintiffs point to, this 
""undisputed"" evidence. "
858,1," The Court has not yet certified a class, but will refer to the action as ""the class action,"" for sake of convenience."
858,2," The Court recounts the facts as alleged in plaintiffs' Amended Complaint [6]. A more detailed accounting of the facts is found in 
this Court's December 1, 2003 [39] Order. "
859,3," The amendments proposed in plaintiffs' first motion for leave to amend include adding both a plaintiff and a defendant, 
expanding the relevant market to include Atlanta, Georgia, and adding additional claims. (See generally Second Am. Compl., 
attach. to Mot. for Leave to Amend Compl. [48].)"
859,4, Expert discovery was to expire prior to that date. 
860,5," In this case, plaintiffs filed this motion for leave to amend on the same day that defendants filed their answer to plaintiffs' 
second amended complaint. (See Docket Entries 54 and 55.) The revised case management plan signed by the Court set 
September 17, 2004, as the date by which defendants had to file their answer to the second amended complaint. (Order [52] at 
2.) Given that defendants filed their answer early, that plaintiffs filed this motion on the same day that defendants filed their 
answer, and that plaintiffs concede--by the styling of the motion-that leave is required in order to amend, the Court concludes 
that leave of court is required in order for plaintiffs to amend their complaint for a third time. "
861,6," Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate the relevance of the defendants omitting reference to either Service Partners or Masco 
Contractor Services East. "
862,7," The Court is not certain that plaintiffs much care about this effort to amend anymore, as, since the filing of the motion to amend, 
new plaintiffs, represented by the same counsel, have filed a putative class action complaint, adding two of the new entities 
referenced in this second amended motion to amend. "
863,8, The Court is including nonsolicitation clauses whenever it discusses or refers to covenants not to compete. 
864,9," Columbus Drywall & Insulation, Inc. v. Masco Corporation, 1:04-CV-03066-JEC (filed on October 19, 2004)-"
864,10," This report can be accomplished through the responses due, but not yet filed. "
867,1," Plaintiffs' claim for declaratory relief under the Communications Act of 1934 was dismissed, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41, on 
January 14, 2005."
867,2," The following Defendants are parties to the joint motion to dismiss: Equity Office Properties, Inc.; Crescent Real Estate Equities 
Co.; Hines Corporate Properties, LLC; Arden Realty, Inc.; SpectraSite Building Group, Inc.; Building Owners and Managers 
Association of New York; Colonnade Properties, LLC; Taylor Simpson Capital Management, LP; Boxer Property Management 
Corp.; and Shorenstein Co. LLC. The actions against Defendants Boxer Property Management Corp. and Arden Realty, Inc. 
were dismissed on September 23, 2004 and January 4, 2005, respectively."
867,3," Defendant Crescent Real Estate Equities Co. separately moves to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and improper venue; 
and Defendant Prestonwood Tower-Dallas, Inc. separately moves for Rule 11 sanctions and to dismiss for failure to state a 
cause of action. The Court does not address these motions."
867,4," For purposes of Defendants' joint motion to dismiss, the Court accepts as true all factual allegations contained in the complaint. 
See Anatian v. Coutts Bank (Switzerland) Ltd., 193 F.3d 85, 88 (2d Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1188, 120 S. Ct. 1241, 146 
L. Ed. 2d 100 (2000). "
868,5," Courts have also emphasized a ""central interest in protecting the economic freedom of participants in the relevant market;"" 
although, the alleged antitrust violation must have a ""demonstrable impact"" not just on a participant, but on the market as a 
whole. Assoc. Gen., 459 U.S. at 530, 538; Mathias, 152 F. Supp. 2d at 480. "
869,6," Because the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not suffered an antitrust injury, it does not reach this second prong of the standing 
analysis."
869,7," In fact, a situation in which one group of providers is favored ""may actually encourage, rather than discourage, competition, 
because the incumbent and other, competing . . . groups have a strong incentive continually to improve the care and prices they 
offer in order to secure the exclusive positions."" Balaklaw, 14 F.3d at 799. Individual competitors who are injured through this 
type of competition alone cannot allege an antitrust injury. Id. at 797. "
870,8," Although the complaint describes with specificity the manner in which Defendants' conduct has harmed Winstar, it does not 
indicate that either the competitive structure of the market or consumers of telecommunications services have been injured in a 
manner anticipated by the antitrust laws. See Mathias, 152 F. Supp. 2d at 479 (holding that plaintiffs who sued defendant for (i) 
selling newspapers to plaintiffs' competitors at below-cost prices, (ii) guaranteeing preferential prices to favored competitors but 
not to plaintiffs, (iii) conspiring to exclude plaintiffs from the market, and (iv) forcing plaintiffs to buy newspapers at unreasonably 
high prices, did not have antitrust standing, because ""the harms they claim do not extend beyond injury to themselves""); 
Balaklaw, 14 F.3d at 797 (holding that plaintiff anesthesiologist who sued hospital for entering into exclusive contract with 
favored anesthesiologists did not have antitrust standing, because he only established harm as an individual competitor); 
Volmar, 825 F. Supp. at 1161 (holding that plaintiffs who sued defendants for driving them out of the market by transferring 
plaintiffs' newspaper distributorship to other favored distributors did not have standing, because they did not show any effect on 
the competitive structure of the market)."
870,9," Because the New York Donnelly Act is to be ""construed in harmony with judicial rulings under the Sherman Act,"" Winstar's 
Donnelly Act claim is dismissed for the same reasons as its Sherman Act claims. Complaint, P81; Bijan Designer for Men v. 
Katzman, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1426, *31, n.10 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) (""Since [plaintiff] identifies no state policy or difference in the 
statutory language that would justify construing the Donnelly Act differently from the Sherman Act . . ., his motion under New 
York antitrust law fails for the same reasons it does under federal antitrust law.""). "
873,1," In support of its Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, DirecTV filed a memorandum of law, the Affidavit of Paul I. Perlman, 
Esq., and a reply memorandum of law. In opposition to DirecTV's motion, Defendant filed a memorandum of law. "
881,1," A separate Memorandum & Order will decide the parties' claim construction, infringement and patent misuse motions. "
883,2," A grant-back provision exists where the licensee is required to ""grant-back"" to the patentholder any innovation or additional 
patent that is developed by the licensee within the field of the patentholder's patent."
883,3," Additional factors to be considered include ""the directness or indirectness of the asserted injury, the existence of an identifiable 
class of persons whose self-interest would normally motivate them to vindicate the public interest in antitrust enforcement, the 
speculativeness of the alleged injury, and the difficulty of identifying damages and apportioning them among direct and indirect 
victims so as to avoid duplicative recovery."" See Nat. Assoc. of Pharma. Mfrs., Inc. v. Ayerst Labs., 850 F.2d 904, 913 (2nd Cir. 
1988) (quoting Associated, 459 U.S. at 540-45.) "
885,4," In any event, Philips' subsequent removal of certain patents from its patent list is inadmissible as proof that it tied essential and 
non-essential patents. See Fed. R. Evid. 407."
885,5," This basis, assuming that it is sufficient to satisfy antitrust injury, would only satisfy Gigastorage's requirement. Princo has not 
alleged this basis."
885,6," Defendants are specific in their memorandum about what caused injury. See Defs.' Memo. at 11-12 (""The evidence also shows 
that Philips, as a means of furthering its anticompetitive conduct, engaged in selective enforcement of the pool through 
intimidating personal contacts, phone calls, threatening letters and lawsuits."") While operating a patent pool may be unlawful, the 
only causal connection attributed by Defendants stems from protected conduct."
885,7," Defendants do not have antitrust standing to assert antitrust claims for price-fixing of the discs themselves. See Matsushita 
Elec. Indus. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 582-583, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538, 106 S. Ct. 1348 (1986) (holding that price-fixing 
does indeed violate the Sherman Act, but that a competitor does not have standing to bring a claim because a rise in the price of 
goods would benefit a seller of those goods). "
894,1," Although Trident initially claimed patent rights over the ink used in its printheads and sued Independent for infringement, that 
infringement claim was dismissed with prejudice."
894,2," Data Gen. Corp. v. Digidyne Corp., 473 U.S. 908, 908, 87 L. Ed. 2d 657, 105 S. Ct. 3534 (1985) (White, J., joined by 
Blackmun, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari)."
894,3, We note that tying as a defense in patent cases is governed by statute. 35 U.S.C. § 271(d)(5) (2000). 
895,4," Independent expressly states in its brief that its position before this court is that Trident's contracts violate the Sherman Act. 
(Br. of Appellant at 9.) Therefore, we do not consider whether there are any violations of Clayton Act § 3, 15 U.S.C. § 14 (2000)."
895,5," Prior to this, the Court had found tying, including patent tying, to violate section 3 of the Clayton Act in an action to enjoin the 
enforcement of patent tying agreements. United Shoe Mach. Corp. v. United States, 258 U.S. 451, 66 L. Ed. 708, 42 S. Ct. 363 
(1922). It had also found patent tying to be a defense in a patent infringement action. Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal 
Film Mfg. ,243 U.S. 502, 61 L. Ed. 871, 37 S. Ct. 416, 1917 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 391 (1917)."
895,6," Under the Northern Pacific test, market power could be inferred from having ""unique economic advantages"" of some kind. 
Fortner Enters., Inc. v. United States Steel Corp., 394 U.S. 495, 505, 22 L. Ed. 2d 495, 89 S. Ct. 1252 (1969) (""Fortner I""). In 
contrast, Fortner II requires the ability to actually raise prices in a relevant market. Since Jefferson Parish found a 30 market 
share inadequate, lower courts in subsequent cases have generally refrained from condemning tying arrangements where the 
defendant had less than a 30 market share. See Herbert Hovenkamp, Federal Antitrust Policy: The Law of Competition and Its 
Practice § 10.3, at 397 & n. 19 (2d ed. 1999) (collecting cases). "
897,7," It is noteworthy that Congress has declined to require a showing of market power for affirmative patent tying claims as opposed 
to patent misuse defenses based on patent tying. Proof of actual market power is required to establish a patent misuse defense 
based on patent tying. Act of Nov. 19, 1988, Pub. L. No .100-703, § 201, 102 Stat. 4674, 4676 (codified at 35 U.S.C. § 271(d)(5) 
(2000)). The version of Public Law No. 100-703 that originally emerged from the Senate contained language also abrogating the 
presumption of market power in antitrust patent tying cases. See 134 Cong. Rec. 30,688-89 (1988). This language was removed 
in a House amendment and does not appear in the statute, see 134 Cong. Rec. 32,295 (1988), making clear that Congress was 
not attempting to change existing law in this respect."
897,8," Many of this court's decisions upon which defendants rely are also Walker Process cases. See, e. g., Abbott Labs. v. Brennan, 
952 F.2d 1346 (Fed. Cir. 1991)."
897,9," Data Gen., 473 U.S. at 908 (White, J., joined by Blackmun, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). "
898,10," The defendants also point out that the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission have resolved, as a matter of 
their prosecutorial discretion, not to presume that a patent or copyright confers market power. U.S. Dep't of Justice and Fed. 
Trade Comm'n, Antitrust Guidelines for the Licensing of Intellectual Property § 5.3 (1995). This of course does not affect the 
validity of the Supreme Court's decisions in International Salt and Loew's."
898,11," The Sixth Circuit stated that its decision was ""based on the cogent reasoning in Note, The Presumption of Economic Power for 
Patented and Copyrighted Products in Tying Arrangements, 85 Colum. L. Rev. 1140 (1985)."" A.I. Root, 806 F.2d at 676. "
900,12," In the district court the defendants argued that summary judgment should also be denied because plaintiff failed to show two 
separate products and that the tying agreement affected a not insubstantial amount of commerce in the tied product. Indep. Ink, 
210 F. Supp. 2d at 1162 n. 7. Despite these arguments, the district court noted that ""both parties seem to agree that market 
power will be the dispositive element in this case."" Id. Defendants have not renewed these arguments on appeal, and we treat 
them as abandoned."
900,13," On remand, should the plaintiff prevail on liability, the district court should then assess damages. The district court then should 
also determine the scope of the tying agreement as the parties dispute whether end users as well as OEMs are bound by the 
tying agreement. "
907,1," Amicus curiae Jewelers Vigilance Committee (""JVC"") does not object to the R&R, but has nonetheless submitted a lengthy 
letter brief to ""oppose the plaintiffs' motion for class certification to the extent they seek certification of a Rule 23(b)(2) class to 
enjoin advertising of diamonds under the Wilson Tariff Act and § 2 of the Sherman Act."" Letter from Robert L. Begleiter to the 
Court of 9/15/04 at 2. This letter and the arguments asserted therein have no bearing on this Court's review of the R&R, which 
addresses certification of plaintiffs' state law claims. To the extent that JVC raises pertinent and reviewable issues regarding the 
scope of any injunctive relief ordered in connection with plaintiffs' federal claims, those arguments should be considered on 
remand."
907,2," This default was entered only with respect to ""the Wilson Tariff Act (claim 1); Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act (claims 2, 3, 
and 4); Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act (claim 5); N.Y. Gen. Bus. L. §§ 349 and 350 (claim 7); and the Donnelly Act (claim 8) … 
Judgment was not entered on plaintiffs' claim for common-law fraud and for antitrust violations under state statutes other than 
New York."" 1st Opinion,2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18270, 2003 WL 22339305, at *2. "
908,3, Only three of these amici have objected or otherwise provided this Court with submissions regarding the 2d R&R.
908,4," The Donnelly Act provides, in pertinent part:HN2[
] Every contract, agreement, arrangement or combination whereby A monopoly in the conduct of any business, trade or commerce or in the furnishing of any service in this state, is or 
may be established or maintained, or whereby Competition or the free exercise of any activity in the conduct of any business, trade or commerce or in the furnishing 
of any service in this state is or may be restrained or whereby For the purpose of establishing or maintaining any such monopoly or unlawfully interfering with the free exercise of 
any activity in the conduct of any business, trade or commerce or in the furnishing of any service in this state any 
business, trade or commerce or the furnishing of any service is or may be restrained, is hereby declared to be against 
public policy, illegal and void. N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law § 340(1). "
909,5," This is one in a series of decisions issued in Cox v. Microsoft Corp.. In this Opinion and Order I cite to two decisions of the First 
Department, as well as an intervening decision of the Supreme Court. For the sake of clarity, I will refer to these three decisions 
as ""Cox I,"" ""Cox II,"" and Cox III"" based on their order of issuance. "
910,6," Although most often discussed in the context of diversity jurisdiction, the principles of Erie R.R., 304 U.S. 64, 82 L. Ed. 1188, 
58 S. Ct. 817, apply with equal force in pendent jurisdiction cases such as this. See United Mine Workers of Am. v. Gibbs, 383 
U.S. 715, 726, 16 L. Ed. 2d 218, 86 S. Ct. 1130 (1966). "
911,7," As the rules in dispute do not conflict, I need not determine whether Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 was enacted in conformity with scope of 
Congress' authority. Walker, 446 U.S. at 752. "
912,8," This is the first decision Judge Sweet issued in Pelman v. McDonald's Corp., No. 02 Civ. 7821. In this Opinion and Order I cite 
to the first and third decisions and for the sake of clarity, I refer to them as ""Pelman I"" and ""Pelman III."" "
913,9," While JWT filed separate objections to the 2d R&R, IDWA provided this Court with copy of its brief in opposition to certification 
of plaintiffs' claims. Because I review the 2d R&R de novo, I have addressed all of these arguments."
913,10," To the extent that plaintiffs are required to allege that the individual defendant employees of De Beers had knowledge of and 
actually carried out the allegedly deceptive practices, People ex rel. Spitzer v. Telehublink Corp., 301 A.D.2d 1006, 756 
N.Y.S.2d 285, 289 (3d Dep't 2003), they have satisfied that requirement. See Compl. PP13(c), (d). "
914,11," It should also be noted that plaintiffs have limited their proposed § 349 class to persons who made their purchases in New 
York State. 2d R&R,2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15345, 2004 WL 1773330, at *9 n.5. "
915,12," Relying in Feldman, 210 F. Supp. 2d 294, one New York court has ruled that ""a general antitrust claim"" is actionable under § 
349, but it nevertheless dismissed the claim for lack of standing under Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 52 L. Ed. 2d 
707, 97 S. Ct. 2061 (1977). Ho v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., 3 Misc. 3d 1105A, 787 N.Y.S.2d 677, 2004 WL 1118534, at *4-5 (Sup. Ct. 
2004). "
920,1," In its reply, plaintiff contends that it does not need to identify specific customers who communicated with its sales 
representatives or call witnesses to corroborate customers' out-of-court statements. Reply at 5-6. Plaintiff also argues that a 
limiting instruction is not necessary. Id. at 7. However, assuming plaintiff meets the requirements of Rule 803(3), the Court 
believes that some limiting instruction to be determined at a subsequent date may be appropriate."
920,2," In its reply, plaintiff states: ""At trial, CCA intends to call witnesses - including its own personnel - who will testify that customers 
and suppliers stated that they ceased doing business with CCA after CCA lost the ability to sell Equifax credit reports."" Reply at 
1."
920,3," At oral argument, the Court also granted defendants leave to re-open discovery to conduct limited depositions of customers 
whose statements will be proffered by plaintiff. "
921,4," Defendants contend that the Court implicitly rejected the theory that Equifax terminated plaintiff's contract in bad faith by not 
honoring certain alleged pricing commitments. Mot. at 3. "
922,5," Plaintiff refers to the e-mail from Kathy Weismann of Equifax to CCA quoted by the Court in its August 5, 2004 Order which 
states: I received your letter. The rates on Beacon and Safescan for the different levels were a little off."
922,20," -000-100,000 report [sic] cost $ 1,90, Beacon .50, Safescan .15 100,000-250,000 report cost $ 1.80, Beacon .40, 
Safescan .10 250,000-500,000 report cost $ 1.70, Beacon .25, Safescan .08 I will clarify your question on the cities in owned vs. affiliate sales points and about the cities that aren't included at all. August 5, 2004 Order at 11; Opp'n at 3."
922,6," Defendants identify this evidence as follows: (1) CCA's claim that Equifax orally agreed that the prices set forth on the rate schedule (as summarized by Ms. Weismann) 
would either never change; and (2) CCA's claim that Equifax orally agreed that the prices charged to CCA would be uniform with what Equifax charged all 
other resellers. Reply at 7. "
923,7," Insofar as plaintiff suggests that parol evidence may be received under Georgia law, Opp'n at 3-4, 6, defendants argue that 
Georgia law requires the Court, rather than the jury, to construe the contract and exclude parol evidence. Mot at 4 (citing First 
Data POS, Inc. v. Willis, 273 Ga. 792, 794-95, 546 S.E.2d 781 (2001)); Reply at 6 (citing same). The Court concludes that its 
analysis above is consistent with Georgia law."
923,8," In its reply, defendants request the Court to decide, as a matter of law, that CCA's theory that Equifax's termination was 
wrongful because it was done to effectuate an illegal price-fixing agreement is ""legally invalid."" Reply at 1."
923,9," This distinction is significant because there appear to be only nine contracts which plaintiff claims Equifax actively interfered 
with by improperly switching out the codes of end-user automobile users, thus causing them to deal with Equifax directly and 
inducing customer breach. Opp'n at 3. Conversely, if Equifax induced plaintiff to terminate its contracts by rendering plaintiff 
unable to sell Equifax reports to end-users, the claim involves hundreds of contracts. Id. "
924,10," Plaintiff also contends that Judge Woehrle denied Equifax's request to restrict plaintiff's contractual interference claims. Opp'n 
at 2."
924,11," Plaintiff asserts that with respect to these few contract, nine of which have been identified, Equifax ""switch[ed]  [*22] out the 
codes of end-user automobile users who were CCA customers, causing them to deal with Equifax directly."" Opp'n at 3."
924,12," Defendants' arguments that plaintiff's claim must fail as a matter of law because defendants are not ""strangers"" and because 
Equifax cannot be liable in tort for exercising a contractual right are intertwined and therefore the Court addresses them 
together. However, while it may be true that CCA had the right to terminate its contracts with end-users, that fact does not in any 
way defeat CCA's contentions that it was wrongfully terminated by Equifax. "
925,13," Defendants assert that the particular problems with Knievel's testimony include the following: . Knievel has not been CCA's Director of Sales for four years but rather was a commissioned sales representative during 
the relevant period. Mot. at 4. . Knievel lacks a degree in business or economics. Id. . Knievel lacks prior experience selling credit reports. Id. . Prior to joining CCA, Knievel had never been to seven of the nine states at issue in this litigation. Id. . Knievel has not formal training regarding market shares, average report pricing, or report distribution percentages in the 
credit report industry. Id. . Knievel has never testified before about market shares, average report pricing, or report distribution percentages. Id. . Knievel received his job training primarily from Matthew Briggs and Bobby Edwards. Id. at 5. . In his deposition, Knievel ""clarified that he did not have first hand knowledge of market share information for every state, 
but instead acquired  [*27] certain market share information from conversations he had with other CCA sales 
representatives."" Id. . Knievel's ""knowledge of pricing is based primarily on his recollection of: (a) telephonic conversations with auto-end users, 
(b) periodic meetings with auto-end users, and (c) documents (primarily Equifax invoices) shown to [him] during meetings 
with end users."" Id. . Knievel admits that ""he does not know such crucial facts as: (a) the number of auto-end [sic] users from whom he actually 
obtained information to formulate his opinions, (b) the number of auto end-users located in each state, (c) the percentage of 
the auto end-users in these states that he visited; (d) the number of Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion credit reports 
purchased by auto end-users in each state, (e) the amount each auto end-user pays for credit reports in each stae, or (f) 
the manner in which each auto end-users [sic] obtains credit reports in each state."" Id. at 9. . Knievel's opinions regarding average report pricing are inconsistent with documents produced by CCA, including CCA's 
QuickBooks and records of sales to auto dealers. Id. at 12. "
926,14," In addition to several of the problems discussed in footnote 7, defendants point to the following additional purported 
deficiencies in Knievel's testimony: . Knievel relies on his recollection of telephone conversations, in-person meetings, and information from other CCA sales 
representatives from over three years ago. Id. at 15. . Knievel does not know how many dealerships he spoke with or the size of his dealership sample. Id. at 15. . Knievel assumes that Equifax's market shares are the same today as they were four years ago. Id. at 15. "
927,15," Defendants also seek to exclude Dr. Comanor's characterization of Equifax's credit reports as an ""essential facility"" on the 
basis that this testimony would confuse a jury given that such characterization is ""relevant only to CCA's unsuccessful attempt to 
add Sherman Act § 2 claim."" Mot. at 16."
927,16," Plaintiff also argues that in its August 5, 2004 Order, the Court already found that there was sufficient evidence excluding the 
possibility of independent action to reserve the question of whether there was a conspiracy for the jury. Opp'n at 7. Plaintiff 
asserts that ""[t]here is no legal requirement that Dr. Comanor himself be the one proffering that evidence to be allowed into the 
courtroom to testify at all."" Id."
927,17," Plaintiff  [*35] later elaborates on this argument, contending that defendants' reliance on theories articulated in the Areeda & 
Hovenkamp treatise alone is misleading given the criticism of these theories in Judge Richard Posner's treatise, Antitrust Law. 
Opp'n at 11."
927,18," Plaintiff argues that there is nevertheless ""no inconsistency between Equifax having a unilateral incentive to terminate CCA 
and an incentive to do so pursuant to an agreement with ADP and CREDCO."" Id. at 9. "
928,19," On January  [*37] 13, 2004, defendants filed a reply. On January 19, 2005, plaintiff filed a sur-reply to defendants' motion. In 
the sur-reply plaintiff argues that defendants' reply is misleading, particularly in the following ways: (1) Equifax's discussion 
quotes authorities discussing single distributor situations while this case involves a dual distributor situation; (2) the testimony by 
Dr. Teece cited by Equifax in its reply is inaccurate and has been mischaracterized; (3) Equifax has mischaracterized Dr. 
Comanor's testimony; (4) Equifax has selectively quoted scholarly works to support its points; and (5) defendants are incorrect in 
stating that Dr. Comanor's work has not been accepted by courts because Dr. Comanor's work has been accepted by courts in 
published and unpublished cases. Sur-reply at 1-7. On January 21, 2005, defendants filed a motion to strike plaintiff's surreply on the grounds that it violates the local rules and 
CCA did not obtain leave of the Court to file the sur-reply. Motion to Strike at 1. Because the Court does not rely on plaintiff's sur-
reply, the motion to strike is moot."
928,20," In their reply, defendants also argue that Dr. Riddle's testimony is flawed because he failed to consider that the conspiracy, if 
true, would have enhanced CCA's profits and because he failed to offset his calculations accordingly. Reply at 7. "
929,21," Plaintiff acknowledges that it must proffer evidence that it had such a plan and that such a plan would have been successful. 
Opp'n at 9."
929,22," At oral argument, defendants urged the Court to consider a recent Seventh Circuit opinion, Zenith Elecs. Corp. v. WH-TV 
Broad. Corp., Nos. 04-1635 & 04-1790 (7th Cir. Jan. 20, 2005), The Court has reviewed this case and finds that the nature of the 
expert testimony therein, which includes numerical projections, is qualitatively different from that presented in this case such that 
Zenith appears to be inapposite. In any event, Zenith is not binding on this Court."
929,23," As stated at oral argument, the Court will permit defendants to take further depositions of Matthew Briggs and Jeffrey Briggs 
regarding plaintiff's theory that CCA was harmed by its inability to provide merged reports to the mortgage industry. "
934,1," Because the HN4[
] Court finds that Rule 11 provides suitable standards for assessing the conduct of Plaintiff and its counsel, and because Defendants have satisfied the ""safe harbor"" requirements for the imposition of Rule 11 sanctions by serving their 
motion 21 days before filing it, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(c)(1)(A); see also First Bank of Marietta v. Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co., 
307 F.3d 501, 510-11 (6th Cir. 2002), the Court need not separately address the availability of sanctions under 28 U.S.C. § 
1927. See Runfola & Associates, Inc. v. Spectrum Reporting II, Inc., 88 F.3d 368, 375 (6th Cir. 1996). "
935,2," Most of this delay was attributable to Plaintiff's repeated failure to serve appropriately tailored document requests upon non-
party BCBSM. As observed in an October 7, 2003 order, Plaintiff's initial requests to BCBSM were overly broad, and no apparent 
effort was made to seek only those materials that could not have been obtained directly from Defendants at less burden and 
expense. Even upon being granted an opportunity to prepare and serve amended document requests, Plaintiff made only 
modest changes, leaving the Court with the task of, in essence, redrafting Plaintiff's requests to correspond with the claims and 
allegations actually advanced in the case. Upon performing this task in a February 17, 2004 order, the Court directed BCBSM to 
produce any responsive documents, and this non-party discovery effort finally was completed the following month. "
936,3," In addition, the fees incurred by Defendants in pursuing this latter motion should have been relatively modest, as it does not 
appear that Plaintiff ever responded to this motion. "
937,4," Defendants also note that the possibility of Rule 11 sanctions was discussed, at least briefly, at the Rule 16 scheduling 
conference held in this Court's chambers on January 6, 2003."
937,5," Indeed, it seems fairly evident from a review of Mr. Greenberg's deposition testimony that he was actively involved in the 
commencement and management of this litigation. The Court also recognizes that a client's overzealousness can place an 
attorney in the awkward situation of attempting to resist demands to press forward despite the lack of an evidentiary basis for the 
party's claims. Nonetheless, it remains the attorney's responsibility to ensure that any papers submitted to the court meet the 
standards of Rule 11, and to pursue other measures -- e.g., withdrawal from the case -- if a client's demands are inconsistent 
with this obligation. "
943,1," The Defendant Aventis, S.A., was the successor-in-interest of Hoechst Aktiengesellschaft and was voluntarily dismissed by the 
State without prejudice on March 3, 2003. "
946,2," Idaho Code § 48-603 provides: HN7[

selling or offering to sell to the ultimate consumer fuel or food, pharmaceuticals, or water for human consumption at an 
exorbitant or excessive price; provided however, this subsection shall apply only to the location and for the duration of the 
declaration of emergency. In determining whether a price is exorbitant or excessive, the court shall take into consideration 
the facts and circumstances including, but not limited to: (a) A comparison between the price paid by the alleged violator for the fuel, food, pharmaceuticals, or water and the price 
for which the alleged violator sold those same items to the ultimate consumer immediately before and after the period 
specified by the disaster or emergency declaration; (b) Additional costs of doing business incurred by the alleged violator because of the disaster or emergency; (c) The duration of the disaster or emergency declaration. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in 
the act, no private cause of action exists under this subsection. "
957,1," For ease, the Court will refer to both Princo and Gigastorage as ""Defendants."" Defendants are both Taiwanese corporations 
and former licensees of Philips. "
958,2," ""Track pitch"" refers to the radial distance between the center-points of two lands on either side of the grooves. "
960,3," See Roget's II, the New Thesaurus, New York 1988, listing ""intermittent"" and ""recurrent"" as synonyms for ""periodic."" "
964,4," The Orange book is published by Philips and Sony. It sets out specifications for CD-Rs and CD-RWs. It is available only to 
licensees of Philips, Sony or another of the companies owning patents that are licensed to produce CD-R/RWs. "
965,5," A failure of substantial compliance with Orange Book standards would make the discs non-merchantable, and probably 
useless."
965,6," As Philips is one of the authors of the Orange Book, it is to be expected that the Orange Book's standards would read upon 
Philips' patents. "
966,7," Philips has disclaimed that purging is an issue in this case, and thus may not raise purging as a defense to patent misuse. 
Therefore, if misuse is found, Philips will be unable to enforce the six patents at issue. "
967,8," HN18[
] (d) No patent owner otherwise entitled to relief for infringement of a patent shall be denied relief or deemed guilty of 
misuse or illegal extension of the patent right by reason of his having done one or more of the following: …(5) conditioned the license of any rights to the patent or the sale of the patented product on the acquisition of a license to 
rights in another patent or purchase of a separate product, unless, in view of the circumstances, the patent owner has market 
power in the relevant market for the patent or patented product on which the license or sale is conditioned. "
995,1," Unless otherwise noted, the court draws on the facts alleged in the parties' pleadings. "
1001,2," In fact, it is unclear whether allegations of injury by a prospective shareholder are ever sufficient to establish standing in the 
Ninth Circuit. Such a conclusion would be consistent with a long line of cases holding that a party does not have antitrust 
standing simply because its commercial relationship with a market participant gives it an economic interest in avoiding the 
restraint of the relevant market by a third party. See, e.g., Eagle v. Star-Kist Foods, Inc., 812 F.2d 538, 540-41 (9th Cir. 1987) 
(holding that fisherman and their union lacked standing to allege injury caused by artificially low prices for tuna because the 
alleged anticompetitive conduct itself ""was directed at the vessel owners, not the crewmembers or the union""); see also Legal 
Econ. Evaluations, 39 F.3d at 954-56 (holding that consulting firms advising tort plaintiffs about structured settlement annuities 
are not participants in the market for annuities for purposes of the standing inquiry); Exhibitors' Serv., Inc. v. American Multi-
Cinema, Inc, 788 F.2d 574, 578-81 (9th Cir. 1986) (holding that film exhibition licensing agent lacked standing to challenge 
injuries from anticompetitive conduct in market for first-run film exhibitions). Admittedly, the Bubar court conceded that some of 
the policy considerations on which it based its decision might differ if the court were confronted with a situation ""in which a 
person had all the resources to enter a market and intended to form a solely-owned corporation rather than an individual 
enterprise."" 752 F.2d at 451. But even assuming that this dictum is good law in the Ninth Circuit, it is clear that Hummer's 
counterclaims fall well short of alleging that it had any intent to participate directly in the market for online music distribution. 
Thus, regardless of whether the Ninth Circuit would adopt a per se rule barring prospective shareholders in as-yet-to-be-formed 
corporations from asserting antitrust claims alleging injury to the corporation, the court holds that Hummer's claim to have 
standing on that basis fails as a matter of law in this action."
1001,3," It is true that in Solinger I, the Ninth Circuit held that ""a prospective purchaser who has taken substantial demonstrable steps to 
enter an industry and who is thwarted in that purpose by antitrust violations"" has standing to bring a private antitrust enforcement 
action. 586 F.2d at 1309. The court noted that under such circumstances, the antitrust injury determination ""is factual in nature 
and seldom presents a situation appropriate for a determination by summary judgment."" Id. at 1310. However, aside from 
obvious factual differences between Solinger I and the instant case -- it is not alleged that Hummer intended to enter the online 
music distribution business, much less that it took any ""demonstrable step"" in preparation for doing so -- the Solinger I court's 
conclusion was based in part on the since-discredited ""target area"" test for determining the causal connection between the 
plaintiff's alleged injury and the anticompetitive conduct of the defendants. Id.; see Associated Gen. Contractors, 459 U.S. at 536 
n.33 (stating that the Court's antitrust injury analysis is intended to replace ""target area"" test). Thus, for these reasons, as well as 
those discussed in the text, the court concludes that the ""prospective shareholder"" analysis in Bubar offer the best guidance for 
applying current Ninth Circuit and Supreme Court law to the allegations in Hummer's counterclaims. "
1012,1," The word ""flipping"" was not used at trial, but it has been used as a descriptive term by the parties on appeal."
1012,2," An additional ""lender"" defendant, Homeside Lending, Inc., was let out on summary judgment."
1012,3," The record shows two other amounts as the aggregate judgment, but the parties agree that the correct amount, based on the 
jury's verdicts, is $ 1,434,020. "
1014,4," There are some discrepancies and uncertainties with respect to the dates of Beeman's purchases and sales. In the record is an 
exhibit stipulated to by the parties that purports to show those dates, but the source of that data is not clear. It seems to indicate 
when Beeman and his buyers took title to the properties, but there is other evidence that puts some of the dates stated for 
Beeman's purchases in question. The appropriate dates, for our purposes, are the dates that Beeman took title and then entered 
into contracts to sell the properties. The dates noted above for the sales to the plaintiffs are the dates on the contracts of sale. 
Closing of those sales took place two months or so later. With one or two exceptions, the dates upon which Beeman actually 
took title to the properties are not in the record. We shall use the dates stated in the exhibit even though by doing so it would 
appear that Beeman sold the properties before he had title to them. The discrepancies are not important with respect to the 
issues before us. "
1015,5," This advice was apparently based on HUD Mortgagee Letter 87-35, issued October 22, 1987, amending Mortgagee Letter 86-
15 (August 8, 1986) to provide that ""seller buydowns in excess of six percent of the mortgage amount must be applied as a 
dollar-for-dollar reduction of the sales price in mortgage credit process. Seller buydowns are payments for discount points, any 
type of interest payments, or seller payment of closing costs normally (under local market practice) paid by the buyer."" "
1016,6," The amounts contributed by Beeman through these phony gift letter transactions were as follows: (1) for McFadden, $ 3,000; 
(2) for Haley, $ 6,000; (3) for Green, $ 2,600; (4) for Brower and Spencer, $ 2,850; (5) for Henderson, $ 3,100; (6) for Elder, $ 
2,200; (7) for Stamper, $ 4,800; (8) for Coward, $ 3,000. "
1017,7," The intermediate appellate court did cite Darcars in its discussion of punitive damages, so it certainly was aware of that case."
1017,8," The appraisal report was prepared on June 9 based on an inspection on June 5, and it appraised the property as of June 5. "
1018,9," Hoffman claimed that his method of measurement was authorized by a HUD handbook provision directing appraisers to ""enter 
proximity in straight line distance, like '3 houses or one tenth of a mile W subject.'"" The problem is that he did not state the 
distance to the comparables in parts of a mile but in terms of blocks. Hoffman regarded twelve blocks as equaling a mile, so if a 
property was a half mile away by direct measurement ""as the crow flies,"" he would regard it as six blocks away even though it 
might, in fact, be twenty blocks away. In calculating distances in that manner, he made it appear that the ""comparable"" 
properties were a lot closer than they actually were. These discrepancies appeared in most of Hoffman's appraisals."
1018,10," Most ground rents in Baltimore City are capitalized at six percent. Thus, had the property not been subject to the $ 90 ground 
rent, it would be worth $ 1,500 more. "
1022,11," Hoffman stated that ""sometimes"" he would go back and verify whether required repairs had been made, but sometimes he did 
not do so, believing it to be the underwriter's problem. The problem with that is that, in each case here, he knew that his 
appraisal was far in excess of what Beeman had paid for the property only a few months earlier and he justified his appraisal on 
the premise that the property had been ""rehabbed"" - that substantial improvements and repairs had been made to it in the 
meanwhile. He thus knew that if those repairs and improvements were not made, the appraisal would be grossly inaccurate. 
This was not a case of checking to see if a dishwasher was working or a closet had been painted. There was substantial 
evidence that the very repairs and improvements needed to justify the grossly inflated appraisal were not made and that, had 
Hoffman made a reasonable investigation, he would have known that they were not made."
1022,12," It has long been clear that HN8[
] ""fraud may consist in a suppression of the truth as well as in the assertion of a falsehood."" Schnader v. Brooks, 150 Md. 52, 57, 132 A. 381, 383 (1926). We described the elements of an action based on fraudulent "
1023,," concealment of material facts in Green v. H & R Block, 355 Md. 488, 525, 735 A.2d 1039, 1059 (1999): ""(1) the defendant owed 
a duty to the plaintiff to disclose a material fact; (2) the defendant failed to disclose that fact; (3) the defendant intended to 
defraud or deceive the plaintiff; (4) the plaintiff took action in justifiable reliance on the concealment; and (5) the plaintiff suffered 
damages as a result of the defendant's concealment."" See also Levin v. Singer, 227 Md. 47, 64, 175 A.2d 423, 432 (1961)"
1023,13, Irwin was a direct endorsement lender.
1023,14," The record indicates that Beeman took out 100% commercial mortgages to finance his purchase of the properties, that the 
mortgages carried 14% interest, were due in two years, and were personally guaranteed by Beeman and his wife. He had a 
clear financial interest in not holding the properties too long. "

1027,19," Hoffman also complains about the inclusion of injury to credit as part of non-economic damages. As we are striking the non-
economic damages for other reasons, that complaint is moot and need not be addressed. "
1032,20," There might have been a basis for remand to consider lowering the award as to all plaintiffs except Haley, given our 
conclusion that the judgments in favor of those plaintiffs must be amended to strike the award of non-economic damages, but 
none of the parties has sought that relief. "
1036,1," Specifically, the bankruptcy court commented: [T]hat if the Chapter 13 case had not been dismissed, at some point, the court probably would have abstained from hearing 
the adversary proceeding as the substance, antitrust and copyright infringement, would best be addressed by the District 
Court. As a practical matter, the adversary proceeding probably should have been commenced in the District Court in the 
first instance. Deep v. The Recording Industry Association, et. al., Adv. Pro. No. 04-90037, slip op. at 2 (Bankr. N.D.N.Y. Sept. 28, 2004). "
1042,1," T.D. Waterhouse Investor Services, Inc. and T.D. Waterhouse Capital Markets, Inc. also acted as a market maker for Plaintiff's 
stock. Claims against them were dismissed by Order of Dismissal, dated Dec. 3, 2003."
1042,2," On or about that same day, Plaintiff made an application by Order To Show Cause to Justice Karla Moskowitz, seeking a 
preliminary injunction to refrain Defendants from engaging in certain securities practices. Justice Moskowtiz signed the Order on 
July 31, 2003. "
1044,3," Courts often comment that the complete preemption doctrine is not really an exception to the well-pleaded complaint rule, but 
rather a corollary, because whenever the doctrine applies, the well-pleaded complaint rule is satisfied. Caterpillar, 482 U.S. at 
393; Marcus v. AT&T Corp., 138 F.3d 46, 53 (2d Cir. 1998)."
1044,4," The artful pleading doctrine is also more properly styled a ""corollary"" rather than an exception. "
1045,5," As stated above, Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed its claims against the alleged co-conspirators, T.D. Waterhouse. "
1063,1," Price-fixing conspiracy claims were the subject of several federal nationwide antitrust class actions filed by direct purchasers of 
cigarettes. These actions were consolidated and transferred to the United States District Court for the Northern District of 
Georgia. The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants on the issue of conspiracy to fix prices, and the Court 
of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed. See Williamson Oil Co. v. Philip Morris USA, 346 F.3d 1287, 1291 (11th Cir. 2003). "
1081,2," An antitrust treatise makes this sweeping comment in regard to lump sum judgments: ""Interestingly, there has never been an 
antitrust class action in which a lump-sum judgment was entered following a trial of common issues holding a defendant liable 
for an aggregate amount to the entire class."" 2 Antitrust Adviser § 10.46, at 10-103 (Irving Scher, 4th ed. 1995). "
1083,3," One antitrust treatise observes that ""the overwhelming majority of antitrust class actions fall under [Rule 23(b)(3)'s 
predominance requirements],"" and that ""in antitrust cases, courts are more likely to consider the critical issue to be whether 
common liability issues predominate and to disregard individual damages (although not impact) questions."" 8 Julian von 
Kalinowski et al., Antitrust Laws and Trade Regulation §§ 166.03[3], at 166-44; 166.03[3][a][i], at 166-46 (2d ed. 2003)."
1083,4," In Newberg's view, it is settled law that HN42[

followed by a second stage of litigation to determine amounts of damages for each class member based on an aggregate 
damages verdict. See Newberg, supra, §§ 10:5, at 486-87; 10:6, at 488; 10:7 n.1, at 489. "
1092,1, Bobrick Corporation is the parent company of Bobrick Washroom Equipment. We will refer to them collectively as Bobrick.
1092,2," Santana does not appeal the § 2 claim, so we do not address it."
1092,3," The parties' appeals - Nos. 03-1845, 03-2283, and 03-2481 - were consolidated. 03-1845."
1092,4, Toilet partitions are also referred to as toilet compartments. 
1093,5, One issue in the present litigation is whether toilet partitions are finishes or furnishings/fixtures.
1093,6," The Sweet's Catalogue is a collection of catalogues of manufacturers' building products. Manufacturers pay to place their 
catalogues in the Sweet's Catalogue, and architects subscribe to and refer to the Sweet's Catalolgue before specifying materials 
to be used in construction projects. One section of the Sweet's Catalogue is devoted to toilet partitions. "
1094,7," Santana's claims against Sylvester & Associates, Ltd., and Fred Sylvester were dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction. 
Santana subsequently filed an action against them in the District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The decision in that 
case is reported at Santana Prods. v. Sylvester & Assocs., 121 F. Supp. 2d 729 (E.D.N.Y. 1999). Bobrick filed a Third-Party Complaint against Formica on June 1, 1998, bringing claims for contribution, indemnification, fraud, 
and negligent misrepresentation, but that complaint was dismissed for reasons unimportant to this appeal."
1094,8," The court also found that, because there was no evidence that Hornyak and Vogel were marketing to the private sector, they 
were entitled to summary judgment on all claims based on their Noerr/Pennington defense. Santana Products, Inc.,, 249 F. 
Supp. 2d at 494 n. 24. "
1095,9," The District Court relied on the analysis in Santana Prods. v. Sylvester & Assocs., 121 F. Supp. 2d 729 (E.D.N.Y. 1999) and 
held that Santana's ""shared monopoly"" claim was not a cognizable § 2 claim. Santana Products, 249 F. Supp. 2d at 470. 
Santana does not appeal this ruling."
1095,10," 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) gives the courts of appeals discretionary jurisdiction over a district court order ""when a district judge . . . 
shall be of the opinion that such order involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference 
of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation."""
1095,11," We have jurisdiction over Santana's appeal in No. 03-1845 pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291 because the District Court entered a 
final judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) on Santana's Sherman Act claims and its claim for tortious 
interference with prospective contract."
1095,12," Even though ""other factors [may] counsel in favor of deferring to the motions panel,"" ""the merits panel is certainly entitled to

1096,13," The Noerr/Pennington doctrine protects ""the right of the people . . . to petition the government for a redress of grievances."" 
U.S. CONST. amend. I. Defendants in antitrust cases are immune from liability when they are exercising their First Amendment 
right to petition. Actions aimed at ""influenc[ing] the passage or enforcement of laws"" are immune from Sherman Act liability even 
if the antitrust defendant intends to restrain trade or to monopolize, so long as the ""restraint on trade or monopolization is the 
result of valid government action."" Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 135-36, 5 
L. Ed. 2d 464, 81 S. Ct. 523 (1961). Noerr/Pennington immunity extends beyond attempts to influence the passage and 
enforcement of laws and applies equally to efforts to influence administrative agency action, see United Mine Workers of 
America v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626, 85 S. Ct. 1585 (1965), and efforts to access the court system, see 
California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508, 30 L. Ed. 2d 642, 92 S. Ct. 609 (1972). The 
Noerr/Pennington doctrine protects antitrust defendants' rights to ""freely inform the government of their wishes"" and ""to seek 
action on laws in the hope that they may bring about an advantage to themselves and a disadvantage to their competitors,"" 
Noerr, 365 U.S. at 138-39. Santana argues that the defendants' marketing campaign is not petitioning activity and is therefore not protected by the doctrine. 
Santana argues that, even if the marketing campaign is considered petitioning activity, the defendants are not entitled to 
Noerr/Pennington immunity because of the alleged fraudulent nature of the defendants' campaign. Finally, Santana argues that 
Noerr/Pennington immunity does not extend to situations where, as here, the government is the purchaser of the products at 
issue. "
1097,14," The District Court held that Santana proved the concerted action element as to Bobrick, and Bobrick does not challenge this 
finding. Santana, however, does appeal the District Court's conclusion that it did not prove concerted action as to Hornyak and 
Vogel. Santana seeks to hold Hornyak and Vogel liable under § 1 based on their relationship and interaction with Bobrick. 
Hornyak and Vogel argued to the District Court that they were incapable of conspiring with Bobrick as a matter of law because 
they sold Bobrick's products exclusively. The court, relying on the Supreme Court's decision in Copperweld Corp. v. 
Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628, 104 S. Ct. 2731 (1984), and our decision in Siegel Transfer, Inc. v. 
Carrier Express, Inc., 54 F.3d 1125 (3d Cir. 1995), held that, as a matter of law, Hornyak and Vogel were incapable of 
conspiring. 249 F. Supp. 2d at 505-06. As with the Noerr/Pennington issue, we do not need to resolve this question because, even if we were to hold Santana did prove 
concerted action as to Hornyak and Vogel, Santana's § claim would still fail. "
1101,15," To establish a trademark infringement claim under § 43(a), the plaintiff must prove that the defendant: use[d] in commerce any word, term, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof, or any false designation of origin, 
false or misleading description of fact, or false or misleading representation of fact, which . . . is likely to cause confusion, or 
to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the affiliation, connection, or association of such person with another person, or as to 
the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods, services, or commercial activities by another person . . ."
1101,15, U.S.C. § 43(a) (emphasis added). 
1102,16," The District Court made a finding that Santana was aware of Bobrick's allegedly wrongful conduct in 1989. Santana, 249 F. 
Supp. 2d at 501. Santana argues that there are fact issues as to when Santana knew or should have known about Bobrick's 
marketing activities to fix the beginning of the delay period prior to suit. Santana points out that the TPMC was not formed until 
late 1989 and that Bobrick received a copy of the Formica videotape in early 1990. Santana argues that it did not distribute the 
Formica videotape to its sales representatives until 1990, it did not produce the ""You Be The Judge"" videotape until 1992, and it 
placed other advertisements throughout the 1990's. The length of the delay is HN19[
] a question of fact which is reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard. Churma v. United States Steel Corp., 514 F.2d 589, 593 (3d Cir. 1975). The District Court's finding as to when Santana was aware of Bobrick's 
conduct is not clearly erroneous. As early as March, 1989, Santana was aware of Bobrick's ""fire scare"" campaign. On March 5, 
1989, Lynch of Santana approached Bob Gillis at the American Association of School Administrators Convention, identified 
himself as the president of Santana, and informed Gillis that he objected ""to what he considered an unfair attack on the physical 
properties of the polyethylene material used in the manufacture of Bobrick's toilet compartments."" Lynch asked Gillis for the 
names of Bobrick's attorneys so that Santana's attorneys could contact them. Patrick McGartland, Santana's regional sales 
manager, stated in his deposition that in ""either 1988 or 1989 . . . [he] was aware of that there was an effort to create this 
impression on the part of the potential buyer in the marketplace or the specifier that solid plastic was a fire issue."""
1102,17," This added presumption that both inexcusable delay and prejudice exist is enjoyed by a defendant once the statute of 
limitations has run. See EEOC v. A&P, 735 F.2d at 80. It is because of this presumption that we do not agree with the position of 
the dissent that Santana had only to demonstrate that prejudice to Bobrick did not exist. Once the statute of limitations has run, 
the defendant's burden doubles. "
1103,18," HN22[
] Aside from proving the existence of a prospective contractual relation, a plaintiff must prove the defendant had the 
purpose or intent to harm the plaintiff by preventing the relation from occurring, the absence of privilege or justification on the 
part of the defendant, and actual damage resulting from the defendant's conduct. Thompson Coal Co. v. Pike Coal Co., 488 Pa. 
198, 412 A.2d 466, 471 (Pa 1979). "
1104,19," Comtec, which had supplied HDPE partitions to the three companies that had stopped selling the HDPE partitions, entered the 
toilet partition market to sell HDPE partitions in their place. "
1113,1," See Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469, 113 S. Ct. 2786 (1993); Kumho Tire Co. v. 
Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 143 L. Ed. 2d 238, 119 S. Ct. 1167 (1999)."
1113,2," By ""Wasatch Front,"" the Plaintiffs refer to Salt Lake, Davis, Weber, Cache, Utah and western Summit counties in the State of 
Utah. (See Second Amended Complaint, filed February 17, 2004 (dkt. no. 796), at 23 P67.) "
1114,3, See Utah Code Ann. § 58-16a-101 et seq. (2002 & Supp. 2004) (Utah Optometry Practice Act).
1114,4," See Utah Code Ann. § 58-16a-102(11) (2002) (""Optometry' and practice of optometry'"" defined)."
1114,5," (See Second Amended Complaint, filed February 17, 2004 (dkt. no. 796), at 27 P77.)"
1114,6," Plaintiffs allege that the scope of the IHC Defendants' conspiracy encompasses all of the ophthalmologists that have been 
appointed to IHC provider panels--over ""70% of the ophthalmologists on the Wasatch Front,"" according to their pleadings. (Sec. 
Amd. Cmplt. at 22 P64 (""Ophthalmologists serving on the IHC provider panels knowingly and actively participated as 
conspirators in the antitrust violations as alleged … and each has performed acts in furtherance of the contracts, combinations 
and conspiracies as alleged ….""); id at 29 P82.) Plaintiffs have named two of these ""IHC ophthalmologists"" as ""defendant 
ophthalmologists"" in this action, Drs. Miller and Brodstein. (Id. at 20-21 PP61-63.) "
1115,7," The $ 28 million lost profit damages estimate is based upon the work of Plaintiffs' expert witness, Rick Hoffman, CPA, and 
differs from the $ 45 million estimate pleaded in P91 of the Second amended Complaint. (Sec. Amd. Cmplt. at 50 P91.) "
1116,8," Ms. McCready, a subscriber to a group health care plan who had been denied reimbursement by the plan for the cost of 
services of a clinical psychologist, brought her suit under § 4, alleging that the plan had conspired with a professional association 
of physicians and psychiatrists to exclude psychologists from receiving payment under the plan for outpatient treatment of 
mental disorders, including psychotherapy in violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act. 457 U.S. at 467-70. The Court concluded that 
""the injury she suffered was inextricably intertwined with the injury the conspirators sought to inflict on psychologists and the 
psychotherapy market. In light of the conspiracy here alleged we think that McCready's injury 'flows from that which makes 
defendants' acts unlawful … and falls squarely within the area of congressional concern."" Id. at 484 (footnote omitted). "
1117,9," Substantially all of the IHC eye care panel providers on the Wasatch Front are IHC hospital-privileged M.D. ophthalmologists, 
not licensed optometrists. "
1118,10," If employee benefits administration is the desired ""product,"" in contrast to employee access to health care services, an 
employer may engage a benefits administrator who is not a limited healthcare plan or HMO governed by Utah Code Ann. §§ 
31A-8-101 et seq. (2003), or simply purchase a health insurance indemnity policy covering a schedule of reimbursable health 
care costs. "
1119,11," In this respect, private ""managed care"" limited health plans differ from traditional health care indemnity insurance or group 
health plans which provide ""reimbursement for a portion of the costs incurred by subscribers with respect to outpatient 
treatment"" or hospital care for a list of covered illnesses, disorders, injuries, and in some instances, routine preventative care, 
Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready, 457 U.S. at 468; providers are often selected by the subscriber from the larger market of 
health care providers. For example, Ms. McCready obtained and paid for psychotherapy services from her own psychologist and 
then sought reimbursement from her group health plan, which was refused for allegedly unlawful anti-competitive reasons. Id. at 
468-70. "
1120,12," Having objected orally in times past, or in writing, each of the defendant ophthalmologists has filed an affidavit in this action 
disclaiming any ""unlawful agreement to bar optometrists"" from provider panels. "
1121,13," Plaintiffs' designation of the ""managed care"" health plan market as the relevant market for purposes of their § 1 group 
boycott/concerted refusal to deal claims stands in contrast to other cases identifying the health services market as relevant. See, 
e.g., Griffiths v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama, 147 F. Supp. 2d 1203, 1214 (N.D. Ala. 2001) (""the allegations of 
Plaintiffs' complaint at least implicitly acknowledge that the relevant product market includes not only the services of 
chiropractors, but also the oft-referenced 'comparable' or 'similar' services afforded by other types of competing health care 
providers""). Plaintiffs point to the ""market for the utilization of surgical facilities on the Wasatch Front"" is the relevant market for purposes of 
Plaintiffs' § 2 claims."
1121,14," Yet Plaintiffs do not totally denigrate the economic virtues and competitive value of limited panels. The relief they seek is to be 
made members of defendant IHC's limited provider panels, not to open the panels to all. "
1122,15," This case differs from cases such as Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready, in which the financing under the group health plans 
by its own terms was made available to the entire health care provider marketplace, but for the defendant's subsequent ""change 
in the terms of the plan to link reimbursement to a subscriber's choice of one group of psychotherapists over another."" 457 U.S. 
at 480 n.17. In McCready, plaintiffs claim was ""premised on a concerted refusal to reimburse under a plan that … as a matter of 
contract construction and state law permitted reimbursement for the services of psychologists without any significant variation in 
the structure of the contractual relationship between her employer and Blue Shield."" Id. at 480; see also id. at 468 n.2."
1122,16," Plaintiffs do not pray for an injunction requiring the IHC Defendants to open IHC panels to all licensed optometrists, or for that 
matter, to all eye care providers--optometrists and ophthalmologists--not already appointed to IHC panels. Rather, they seek an 
order compelling IHC ""to approve and include each plaintiff optometrist as a duly authorized provider … for all enrollee/patients 
under each and every IHC private health care plan and IHC-affiliated plan that now exists and may be created in the future."" 
(Sec. Amd. Cmplt. at 52-53 [Prayer for Relief] 18 (emphasis added).) "
1123,17," Plaintiffs' pleadings seek injunctive relief by which the IHC Defendants would be ""permanently enjoined and restrained from 
the commission of the acts in violation of §§ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act as alleged in PP87(1)-(7)"" of the Second Amended 
Complaint, (Sec. Amd. Cmplt. at 52 [Prayer for Relief] P7), but lack the requisite standing to challenge the IHC Defendants' 
alleged misconduct in the hospital/surgical facilities market."
1123,18, It appears that Plaintiffs' patients already include approximately 10% of the IHC limited health plan enrollees. 
1124,19," With very narrow exceptions, a limited health plan cannot offer benefits that indemnify enrollees for the cost of services 
rendered by non-participating providers, in contrast to health care plans such as the one at issue in Hahn v. Oregon Physicians' 
Service, 868 F.2d 1022 (9th Cir. 1988). "
1125,20," We also have evidence in the record of the large, if not dominant, status of IHC as a vendor of hospital and surgical facilities. 
Of course, there are stand-alone eye centers, unaffiliated with IHC, and there are other hospitals and hospital chains which 
compete with IHC hospitals and surgical facilities. Plaintiff optometrists do not use hospitals and surgical centers in providing 
non-surgical eye care to their patients. They argue that IHC hospitals and surgical centers are trying to monopolize use by a 
provision in the provider contract asking that panel members (who already have hospital privileges) to use the hospital and eye 
centers for their patients. That alleged violation is simply too remote from the injury alleged by Plaintiffs to make that claim 
justiciable in this action. "

1140,1," Except where otherwise indicated, all statutory references are to the Business and Professions Code."
1140,2," Other defendants, including retailers Traders Sports, Inc., MKS Supply, Inc., Southern Ohio Gun Distributors, Inc. and 
Andrew's Sporting Goods, settled according to the terms of consent decrees or stipulated judgments entered after summary 
judgment was denied as to those defendants. Ellett Brothers, Inc. entered into a stipulated judgment that purported to be a final 
judgment as to issues raised in a summary adjudication motion. The purported appeal from that stipulated judgment will be 
dismissed as having been taken from a nonappealable order."
1140,3," The named defendants were: Arcadia Machine & Tool, Inc.; Bryco Arms, Inc.; Davis Industries, Inc.; Excel Industries, Inc.; 
Lorcin Engineering Co., Inc.; China North Industries; Phoenix Arms; Sundance Industries, Inc.; Beretta U.S.A. Corp.; Pietro 
Beretta S.p.A.; Browning Arms Co.; Carl Walther GmbH; Charter Arms, Inc.; Colt's Manufacturing Co., Inc.; Forjas Taurus, S.A.;

Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute, Inc.; B.L. Jennings, Inc.; Ellett Brothers, Inc.; International Armament 
Corp.; RSR Wholesale Guns, Inc.; Southern Ohio Gun Distributors; and Traders Sports, Inc."
1140,4," The Los Angeles City and County complaints added the following fictitious business names for the following entities: Accu-Tek 
for Excel Industries, Inc.; Hi-Point Firearms for MKS Supply, Inc.; Norinco for China North Industries; Intratec U.S.A., Inc. for 
Navegar, Inc.; Cobray Firearms, Inc. for S.W. Daniel, Inc.; and Interarms Industries, Inc. for International Armament Corp. Those 
complaints also added B&B Group, Inc., Andrew's Sporting Goods, Inc., National Guns Sales, Inc., S.G. Distributing, Inc., and 
Hawthorne Distributors, Inc."
1140,5," The Los Angeles County complaint also added Cobray Firearms, Inc. as a fictitious business name for S.W. Daniel, Inc. "
1141,6," In the usual case, gun manufacturers do not sell directly to customers or retailers, but sell to licensed distributors or 
wholesalers, who then sell to licensed retailers. (See, e.g., Note, California's Legislative Response to Merrill v. Navegar: An 
Analysis (2003)  24 Whittier L.Rev. 833, 849.)"
1141,7," The manufacturer defendants moving for summary judgment were: Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc.; Beretta U.S.A. Corp; 
Fabbrica d'Armi Pietro Beretta S.p.A.; Kel-Tec CNC Industries, Inc.; Hi-Point Firearms; H&R 1871, Inc.; Glock, Inc.; Sigarms, 
Inc.; Taurus International Manufacturing, Inc.; Forjas Taurus S.A.; Phoenix Arms; Browning Arms Company; Excel Industries, 
Inc.; North American Arms, Inc.; Heckler & Koch, Inc.; Smith & Wesson Corp.; and Colt's Manufacturing Company. The moving 
distributor defendants were: RSR Wholesale Guns, Inc.; Ellett Brothers, Inc.; MKS Supply; Southern Ohio Gun Distributors; B&B 
Group, Inc.; S.G. Distributing Co.; Hawthorne Distributors; Carl Walther GmbH; and National Gun Sales. The trade association 
defendants joined in the omnibus summary judgment motion and filed their own motion for summary judgment. "
1142,8," Data showed that Andrew's had 200 guns per year traced to crimes. It also had short time-to-crime indicators and 1,037 known 
multiple sales involving 2,192 guns between 1995–1999, repeated failures to account for the disposition of firearms, and setting 
up an entire inventory account in the name of another store for firearms that were missing. Andrew's was repeatedly cited by the 
United States Department of Treasury, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) for violating federal law governing 
record keeping. Evidence linking distributor SG Distributing, Inc. to Andrew's demonstrated wrongdoing was labeled “particularly 
striking” because the same individual owned both Andrew's and SG Distributing, Inc. Trader's was also linked to “overwhelming 
indicators of gun trafficking.”"
1142,9," The judgment listed the following defendants as being dismissed with prejudice: B&B Group, Inc.; Beretta U.S.A. Corp.; 
Browning Arms Company; Carl Walther GmbH; Colt's Manufacturing Company; Excel Industries, Inc.; Fabbrica d'Armi Pietro 
Beretta S.p.A.; Forjas Taurus S.A.; Glock, Inc.; H&R 1871, Inc.; Heckler & Koch, Inc.; Hi-Point Firearms; International Armament 
Corporation a fictitious business name for Interarms Industries, Inc.; Kel-Tec CNC Industries, Inc.; National Gun Sales; National 
Shooting Sports Foundation, Inc.; North American Arms, Inc.; Phoenix Arms; RSR Wholesale Guns, Inc.; S.G. Distributing Co.; 
Sigarms, Inc.; Smith & Wesson Corp.; Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute, Inc.; Sturm, Ruger & Company, 
Inc.; and Taurus International Manufacturing, Inc."
1142,10," The United States Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Firearms and Crime Statistics report that in 2003, 
449,150 victims of violent crimes stated that they faced an offender with a firearm and that 67 percent of the 16,503 murders in 
2003 were committed with firearms. (<http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/guns.html> (as of Feb. 10, 2005).) "
1143,11," Plaintiffs' list of a number of suggested practices that defendants could undertake highlights the problems of administering 
such a program. The suggested practices include: collecting and using crime gun tracing data to identify high-risk retailers; 
selling only to approved dealers; providing training to retailers about how to block straw man purchases; limiting the number of 
guns retailers could sell at one time to one customer; requiring dealers to ask questions of customers seeking multiple 
purchases; and sanctioning dealers who fail to comply with these requirements. "
1144,12," We note plaintiffs have not alleged a tort action for products liability that requires elements of breach of duty and legal 
causation. Plaintiffs find significance in the repeal of former Civil Code section 1714.4 and argue that Civil Code section 1714 
now singles out gun manufacturers as having a duty to use ordinary care under the relevant circumstances. Civil Code section 
1714, subdivision (a) provides in part: “HN4[
] The design, distribution, or marketing of firearms and ammunition is not exempt 
from the duty to use ordinary care and skill that is required by this section.” HN5[
] Historical notes accompanying the amended version of section 1714 state that the repeal of section 1714.4 was not intended to create new causes of action against 
manufacturers of firearms, but to preserve all actions against them, including products liability, nuisance and statutorily based 
actions. (See Historical and Statutory Notes, 9A West's Ann. Civ. Code (2004 supp.) foll. § 1714, p. 12.) That the defendants in 
this case may have a duty to use ordinary care in the conduct of their business does not create a duty to initiate an affirmative 
program of investigation and sanctioning of wayward retailers. "
1145,13," One anecdotal example illustrates this point. A gun was recovered in 1998 pursuant to a warrant served on a residence 
where narcotic and firearm trafficking was occurring. This crime gun was traced to an original sale by a retailer in 1970. When 
further facts were examined, it turned out that the original purchaser was a police officer and the retailer was innocent of 
wrongdoing."
1145,14," Trafficking indicators include multiple crime guns traced to an FFL or first retail purchaser, short time to crime for guns traced 
to an FFL, incomplete trace results due to an unresponsive FFL, frequently reported firearms thefts by an FFL, frequent multiple 
sales and recovery of firearms with obliterated serial numbers."
1145,15," Taking one line from the spreadsheets as an example of the data presented, Andrew's, under one of its federal license 
numbers, showed 358 traced guns sold between January 3, 1995 and December 31, 2001. Under a different license number, 
only 10 guns were reported. Many factors besides illegal conduct could explain what appears to be a relatively high number of 
crime guns, including a large overall volume of sales. At argument before the trial court, Andrew's counsel represented that the 
company sold approximately 176,000 firearms between 1995 and 1999. This example illustrates the fact that a manufacturer 
reviewing the raw data, without further investigation and analysis, would not be justified in imposing sanctions on a particular 
FFL. "
1146,16," Except for the public nuisance argument, discussed post, plaintiffs have not alleged an unlawful or fraudulent practice, and 
focus on the unfair provision of the UCL. "
1151,17," We reject plaintiffs' argument that the trial court improperly drew adverse factual conclusions when it noted that the evidence 
did not connect defendants with facilitating the diversion of guns to the underground market. The court was merely 
acknowledging that plaintiffs' own experts admitted during their depositions they could not conclude that sales of crime guns 
necessarily indicated the dealer was engaged in wrongdoing, and admitted that any traced crime gun could have been originally 
sold to a legal purchaser."
1151,18," Gun sales are already heavily regulated at the federal, state and local levels. (See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. §§ 922–924;  Hamilton, 
supra, 750 N.E.2d at p. 1066, fn. 9 [listing federal gun regulations];  Great Western Shows, Inc. v. County of Los Angeles (2002) 
27 Cal.4th 853 [118 Cal. Rptr. 2d 746, 44 P.3d 120] [county ordinance prohibited sale of firearms on county property].) California 
regulates gun sales and use more extensively than many states. (Pen. Code §§ 12000–12098 [The Dangerous Weapons 
Control Law]; Bang, Trigger Locks and Warning Labels on Firearms Become a Reality (2000) 31 McGeorge L.Rev. 265, 267 
[noting that California's gun control laws are among the most stringent in the country]; see also  Public Policy Perspectives, 
supra, 73 Fordham L.Rev. at pp. 604–605.) The fact of such extensive existing regulation counsels caution before imposing an 
additional layer of judicial requirements. Contrary to plaintiffs' argument, we are not determining that we are required to abstain from deciding the issues. Rather, we are 
deciding the issues, albeit adversely to plaintiffs' position. "
1152,19," Plaintiffs also argue that the trial court mistakenly found that defendants could not be liable for nonfeasance and improperly 
imported concepts of duty into the UCL analysis. We do not discuss the issue of duty, because the absence of causation 
requires affirmance of the summary judgment. Nor are we precluding actions against gun manufacturers under section 17200 or 
nuisance where causation is established."
1152,20," Referring to its prior order to produce documents reflecting criminal disposition of firearms, the court stated: “As could be 
expected in a case of this magnitude, discovery has produced a mountain of data, … Significantly, however, none of this data 
reflects evidence of the type of transactions complained of by plaintiffs … which can be causally attributed to these moving 
manufacturers and distributors.”"
1152,21," HN23[
] We reject defendant Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc.'s assertion that public nuisance actions must relate to the use 
or condition of real property. Public nuisance is not so limited. (See, e.g.,  People ex rel. Gallo v. Acuna, supra, 14 Cal.4th 1090 
[upholding injunction against neighborhood street gang activity];  Venuto v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. (1971) 22 Cal. App. 
3d 116 [99 Cal. Rptr. 350] [nuisance includes interference with public health, comfort and convenience]; and  Martinez v. Pacific 
Bell (1990) 225 Cal. App. 3d 1557, 1565 [275 Cal. Rptr. 878] [quoting Professor Prosser's description of nuisance as broad 
enough to encompass everything from “ ‘an alarming advertisement to a cockroach baked in a pie.’ ”]; see also Rest.2d Torts, § 
821B, com. h, p. 93 [stating that public nuisance does not necessarily involve interference with use of the land].) "
1153,22," Comment f of section 821B of the Restatement is also relevant to this case, and states: “HN25[
] In addition, if there has 
been established a comprehensive set of legislative acts or administrative regulations governing the details of a particular kind of 
conduct, the courts are slow to declare an activity to be a public nuisance if it complies with the regulations. …” "
1154,23," There has not been unanimous agreement among courts that have considered the issue. Some federal courts have refused 
to recognize claims of public nuisance against gun manufacturers. (See, e.g.,  Camden Cty. Bd. of Chosen Freeh. v. Beretta 
U.S.A. (D.N.J. 2000) 123 F. Supp. 2d 245 (Camden I), affd.  273 F.3d 536 (3rd Cir. 2001) (Camden II);  City of Philadelphia v. 
Beretta U.S.A. Corp. (3rd. Cir. 2002) 277 F.3d 415.) Plaintiffs argue that Camden I was “discredited” in  James, supra, 820 A.2d 
at pages 34 and 51. The court in James declined, on state law grounds, to adopt the analysis used in Camden I, but its holding 
was only that it would not dismiss the action at the pleading stage. ( James, supra, at pp. 38, 44.) The James court repeatedly 
noted it was not considering plaintiff's ability to prove the allegations of the complaint. ( James, supra, at pp. 34, 44, 47.) The 
Illinois Supreme Court reversed decisions cited by plaintiffs, finding that a cause of action for nuisance cannot be stated against 
gun manufacturers. (See  City of Chicago v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp. (2002) 337 Ill. App. 3d 1 [785 N.E.2d 16, 271 Ill. Dec. 365], 
revd.  (Ill. 2004) 213 Ill.2d 351 [821 N.E.2d 1099, 290 Ill.Dec. 525] [holding gun manufacturers have no duty to prevent illegal 
use of their product]; and  Young v. Bryco Arms (2001) 327 Ill. App. 3d 948 [765 N.E.2d 1, 262 Ill. Dec. 175], revd.  (Ill. 2004) 
213 Ill.2d 433 [821 N.E.2d 1078, 290 Ill.Dec. 504] [holding manufacturing a gun is not the legal cause of injury produced by a 
gun-wielding killer not under the defendant's control].)"
1154,24," The United States Supreme Court denied a petition for certiorari in Ileto on January 10, 2005. ( Ileto, supra, 349 F.3d 1191, 
cert. den. sub nom. China North Industries Corp. v. Ileto (2005) 543 U.S. 1050 [160 L. Ed. 2d 770, 125 S. Ct. 865].) "
1155,25," Amicus Curiae Product Liability Advisory Council, Inc., has argued that the reforms advocated by plaintiffs amount to an 
illegal concerted refusal to deal, which it terms a classic anti-competitive practice. We make no comment on that assertion, but 
note it only to illustrate the complexities raised by attempting to use the courts to regulate an industry."
1155,26," We do not discuss plaintiffs' claims against the trade association defendants because our determination that the 
manufacturers were not shown to have caused the alleged harms renders the claims that the trade associations engaged in 
conduct to prevent manufacturers from changing their practices moot. "
1166,1," Rule LXX allows private insurers to reject applicants when (1) the motor vehicle is used as a public vehicle; (2) the motor 
vehicle is a racing vehicle or super rapid; (3) the owner or main driver of the motor vehicle has accumulated five or more points 
for violations of the Vehicle and Traffic Act of Puerto Rico, during the three years prior to the date of the application for the 
compulsory liability insurance; (4) the owner or main driver of the motor vehicle has been convicted of driving a motor vehicle 
under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or of participating in any type of drag racing or races on public roads; (5) the license of 
the owner or main driver of the vehicle has been revoked or suspended during the year prior to the effective date when the 
compulsory liability insurance is requested; (6) the motor vehicle is not insurable according to the private insurer's written criteria 
for underwriting traditional insurance policies; (7) the owner of the vehicle has not requested the insurance; and (8) the 
application form as adopted by the Insurance Commissioner was not properly filled out. Rule LXX, Art. 8."
1166,2," A vehicle owner must pay the premium for the compulsory liability insurance to the Secretary of the Treasury at the time he 
acquires or renews the vehicle's license. 26 P.R. Laws Ann. §§ 8051, 8053(a). The Secretary then turns over the total amount 
of the premiums so received to the JUA, which is then responsible for distributing the premiums among its members and itself, 
as the case may be. Id. § 8055(c); Rule LXX, Art. 19. In fact, under Rule LXX, every vehicle for which the requisite compulsory 
liability insurance premium has been paid is considered to be insured by the JUA unless the owner of the vehicle opts out by 
selecting a private insurer or purchasing a traditional insurance policy. Rule LXX, Art. 12(a). "
1167,3," Our own survey found no other comparable compulsory insurance scheme which contemplates competition of like kind. Cf., 
e.g., Ala. Code § 32-7-35 (granting Commissioner of Insurance authority to set up assigned risk plans to apportion drivers who 
are unable to obtain insurance through the regular market ""equitably"" among all insurers); Alaska Stat. § 28.20.580 (same); Fla. 
Stat. Ann. § 627.351(1) (same); Ga. Code Ann § 40-9-100 (same); see also Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 120-2-14-.09 (insureds in 
assigned risk plan are assigned to insurers);  Weaver v. Champion Ins. Co., 567 So. 2d 380, 382 (Ala. Civ. App. 1990) 
(assignment of insureds to insurers in assigned risk plan is semi-random)."
1167,4, The text of the relevant allegations are reproduced in the Appendix. 
1168,5," The district court granted the defendants' motions to dismiss and entered judgment dismissing ""this case"" with prejudice. In 
light of the magistrate judge's recommendation, which the district court adopted in full, that the district court decline to exercise "
1169,," supplemental jurisdiction over the Puerto Rico law claims, we understand the district court to have meant that only the federal 
antitrust law claims are dismissed with prejudice and the commonwealth law claims are dismissed without prejudice. "
1170,6," In fact, HN8[
] the term ""business of insurance"" is used twice in 15 U.S.C. § 1012(b). The first clause ""commits laws 'enacted . . . for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance' to the States, while the second clause exempts only 'the business of 
insurance' itself from the antitrust laws.""  United States Dep't of Treasury v. Fabe, 508 U.S. 491, 504, 124 L. Ed. 2d 449, 113 S. 
Ct. 2202 (1993). The scope of the first clause is not as ""narrowly circumscribed"" as the second. See id."
1170,7," We quickly dispose of two possible objections to application of the McCarran-Ferguson exemption here.HN12[
]  The literal language of the McCarran-Ferguson Act exemption contained in the first sentence in § 1012(b) precludes application of federal 
statutes which ""invalidate, impair, or supersede any law enacted by any State for the purpose of regulating the business of 
insurance."" 15 U.S.C. § 1012(b). An argument could easily be made by the plaintiffs that their claims are entirely consistent with 
and not in conflict with state law and so the first proviso is not met and there is no McCarran-Ferguson exemption. Any such 
argument is foreclosed by judicial construction of the McCarran-Ferguson Act. HN13[
] The McCarran-Ferguson Act has 
generally been construed to cover arguments that the defendants failed to comply with state law, so long as the state law 
concerns the regulation of the business of insurance. As the treatise by Areeda and Hovenkamp puts it, ""if the state's insurance 
industry is 'regulated by state law,' then the antitrust laws simply do not apply, notwithstanding that the application of antitrust 
law in the particular case in no way 'invalidates, impairs, or supersedes' state law and may even be consistent with it."" I Areeda 
and Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law, P 219c, at 339 (2d ed. 2000) (alterations in original). Further, ""although state insurance 
regulation is not invalidated or impaired [by application of the Sherman Act], the mere presence of the regulation is sufficient to 
oust the federal antitrust claim."" Id. at 340. We dispose of another contention. HN14[
] The final sentence of § 1012(b) provides that federal antitrust law shall nonetheless be applicable ""to the extent such business is not regulated by State law."" That clause is not helpful to plaintiff on 
their primary claim of injury -- that the private insurers have agreed not to offer private compulsory insurance -- because the 
state law precisely covers that topic. Indeed, it requires the provision of the compulsory insurance. "
1172,8," We distinguish between this case and the different situation when an excluded third party provider, say an automobile repair 
shop, challenged an agreement between the JUA and auto shops. No such claim is made here. See  Royal Drug, 440 U.S. at 
232-33. Even while horizontal agreements fixing maximum prices have been held to be within the McCarran-Ferguson Act 
exemption, vertical agreements between the car insurers and the repair shops on maximum prices are not. See  Proctor v. State 
Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 218 U.S. App. D.C. 289, 675 F.2d 308, 312, 336-37 (D.C. Cir. 1982);  Quality Auto Body, Inc. v. 
Allstate Ins. Co., 660 F.2d 1195, 1201-02 (7th Cir. 1981); see also  Brillhart v. Mut. Med. Ins., Inc., 768 F.2d 196, 199-200 & n.3 
(7th Cir. 1985) (finding health insurer-physician agreements to be vertical agreements for the purchase of services and not the 
business of insurance);  Liberty Glass Co. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 607 F.2d 135, 136-38 (5th Cir. 1979) (finding arrangements 
between auto insurers and certain car glass installers for the insurers to contract only with those glass installers to install glass 
for the insurers' policyholders did not fall within the ""business of insurance.""). "
1173,9," This is more consistent with standard usage of the term ""boycott."" See Black's Law Dictionary 198 (8th ed. 2004) (defining 
HN27[
] ""boycott"" as ""[a] refusal to deal in one transaction in an effort to obtain terms desired in a second transaction"")."
1173,10," One further twist about pressure on rivals unwilling to join should be addressed. HN28[
] ""The McCarran Act allows rivals to 
come together and eliminate competition among themselves but not to compel unwilling rivals to join their cartel."" I Areeda and 
Hovenkamp, supra, § 220a, at 352. When cartel members attempt to coerce recalcitrant members through devices involving 
pressure on third parties and their relationships, concerns about boycott are heightened. See  In re Workers' Comp. Ins. Antitrust 
Litig., 867 F.2d 1552, 1560, 1567 (8th Cir. 1989). However, plaintiffs do not make any allegations that there were acts of 
retaliation against Seguros Triple SSS, Inc., the insurance company who broke ranks and sold the private compulsory insurance 
to Casellas's customers. Nor do they allege other enforcement activity against recalcitrant members of the cartel. "
1174,11," The defendants include a letter in the record from the Office of the Insurance Commissioner, indicating that an investigation of 
Casellas's allegations revealed no evidence of wrongdoing by the defendants. For purposes of the Rule 12(b)(6) analysis, we 
assume the plaintiffs' allegations are true and do not take this letter into account. "
1180,1," The judgment states that Black & Decker's exception of lack of subject matter jurisdiction is overruled, but is silent as to the 
exceptions filed by defendants, Beerman Precision and Industrial Welding Supply. The judgment notes that counsel for all three 
defendants were present at the hearing in this matter, and the trial court granted motions for appeal filed by all three defendants. 
On February 2, 2005, plaintiff and the three defendants jointly filed a ""Motion to Have Judgment Recognized,"" asking that this 
Court recognize that the judgment rendered by the trial court should have named all three defendants. Their motion was granted 
by this Court on February 3, 2005."
1180,2," For a detailed statement of the facts and procedural history of this case, please refer to this Court's previous opinions in 
Southern Tool & Supply, Inc. v. Beerman Precision Inc., 2003-0960 (La. App. 4 Cir. 11/26/03), 862 So. 2d 271 and 2001-1749 
(La. App. 4 Cir. 5/1/02), 818 So. 2d 256. "
1191,1," City of Naples Airport Authority v. Jet I Center Inc., Case No. 02-5010 CA-HDH, Collier County, Florida, Circuit Court. Tr., Vol.I 
through Vol.III is in reference to the Circuit Court trial transcript of the Injunction Action. "
1192,2, Docket entries in Adversary Proceeding No. 9:04-ap-00110-ALP will be referred to as Adv. Pro. 
1212,1," Defendants' motion to dismiss was pled in the alternative to their motion for summary judgment as to the same counts. This 
Court denied Defendants' motion for summary judgment as premature on December 1, 2004. (Doc. 578). In addition to their 
motion to dismiss Lockheed Martin's antitrust claims, Defendants have also filed a motion to dismiss Counts I-VI of Lockheed 
Martin's Amended Complaint, which allege violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (""RICO"") and 
the Florida Civil Remedies for Criminal Activities Act (collectively ""racketeering claims""). (Doc. 289). This Court will address 
Defendants' motion to dismiss Lockheed Martin's racketeering claims in a separate order."
1212,2," For the purpose of their motion to dismiss, Defendants do not dispute Lockheed Martin's assertion that there is a market for 
performing satellite launch services specifically for the Government."
1212,3," NASA awarded its 19-Pack order on a sole-source basis; Lockheed Martin, thus, did not have an opportunity to bid for the 
order. "
1213,4," A more elaborate recitation of the facts is contained in this Court's April 23, 2004 Memorandum and Order denying a prior 
motion to dismiss by Defendants Boeing, William Erskine, Kenneth Branch, and Larry Satchell. Doc. 207, Memorandum and 
Order, April 23, 2004, Lockheed Martin Corp. v. Boeing Co., 314 F. Supp. 2d 1198 (M.D. Fla. 2004)."
1213,5," ""The Florida legislature has, in effect, adopted as the law of Florida the body of antitrust law developed by the federal courts 
under the Sherman Act."" All Care Nursing Serv., Inc. v. High Tech Staffing Servs., Inc., 135 F.3d 740, 745 n.11 (11th Cir. 1998) 
(""Federal and Florida antitrust laws are analyzed under the same rules and case law.""). Thus, discussion as to the merits of 
Lockheed Martin's claims under the Sherman Act applies with equal force to Lockheed Martin's corresponding claims under the 
Florida Antitrust Act. "
1215,6," In addition to its allegations of market share, Lockheed Martin's monopolization and attempted monopolization claims are 
bolstered by its claims that certain entry barriers in the relevant market-including high investment costs, regulatory barriers, and 
inelastic demand-also enabled Boeing to acquire or nearly acquire monopoly power. See Lockheed Martin Corp., 314 F. Supp. 
2d at 1230."
1215,7," This is not to say that reallocation will not bear on the final analysis of whether Boeing attempted to, or did, monopolize the 
Government launch services market. As the Court discusses below, reallocation may be highly relevant to the question of 
whether the structure of the relevant market was such that it was impossible for Boeing to exercise monopoly power. "
1217,8," Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 767, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628, 104 S. Ct. 2731 (1984). "
1218,9," To the extent that this Court might have suggested in its earlier order that an antitrust conspiracy claim required a showing that 
the defendant's coconspirators were its competitors or even market participants at the time that the alleged conspiracy began, 
the Court now clarifies, in light of Spanish Broadcasting, that there is no such requirement. See 376 F.3d at 1078 n.10."
1218,10," The Court is particularly reluctant to grant a motion to dismiss a conspiracy claim. Given that it is in the very nature of a 
conspiracy to conceal its existence, Plaintiffs face an especially difficult challenge in pleading conspiracy claims with specific 
factual allegations. See Quality Foods de Centro Am., S.A. v. Latin Am. Agribusiness Dev. Corp., S.A. et al., 711 F.2d 989, 995 
(11th Cir. 1983) (""Because of the liberal pleading requirements of the Federal Rules, rarely will a motion to dismiss for failure to 
state a claim be granted. Indeed, such a motion should not be granted 'unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can 
prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.' This is particularly true in an antitrust suit where the 
proof and details of the alleged conspiracy are largely in the hands of the alleged co-conspirators."") (citations omitted) (emphasis 
added). "
1226,1," The Ninth Circuit's original decision in MetroNet, 329 F.3d 986, was vacated by the United States Supreme Court and 
remanded to the Ninth Circuit for further consideration in light of the Supreme Court's intervening decision in Verizon 
Communications, Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko. LLP, 540 U.S. 398, 157 L. Ed. 2d 823, 124 S. Ct. 872 (2004). In 
Verizon, the Supreme Court made clear that it had neither recognized nor repudiated the essential facilities doctrine; the Court 
declined to reach that issue in Verizon, because it held that even under the essential facilities doctrine, the claim would fail. 540 
U.S. at 410-411. "
1234,1," The consent agreement arose out of a dispute between the Maine Oil and Solid Fuel Board and RWB. The Oil and Solid Fuel 
Board ordered RWB to repair twenty-nine chimneys that allegedly violated the fire code, in houses constructed by RWB. RWB 
then entered into a consent agreement with the Oil and Solid Fuel Board to repair the chimneys and in exchange the Board 
agreed not to take any further action against RWB for the chimney violations. No chimney violations are at issue in this action. "
1236,2," The indirect purchasers of concrete blocks were the State of Illinois and various local governmental entities. Illinois Brick Co. v. 
Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 726, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707, 97 S. Ct. 2061 (1977). "
1237,3," The Court noted that if direct purchasers were allowed to recover for the full amount of the overcharge, then the indirect 
purchasers might also be able to recover from the defendant, thus subjecting the defendant to duplicative liability. Illinois Brick 
Co., 431 U.S. at 730."
1237,4," The Court stated that in order to establish the amount of the overcharge, the first purchaser would have to establish the 
overcharge amount at each point where the goods changed hands before they reached the plaintiff. Illinois Brick Co., 431 U.S. 
at 732-33."
1237,5," The Court concluded that the antitrust laws would be more effective if direct purchasers recovered the full amount of the 
overcharge, rather than permitting the ultimate consumers to assert a claim only for the amount each could establish that it had 
absorbed. Illinois Brick Co., 431 U.S. at 734-35. "
1250,1," According to Centrix's website, ""CENTRIX does not make auto loans itself. Rather, the Company has developed a national 
network of financial institutions to fulfill lending needs."""
1250,2," As discussed below, the Plaintiffs' Complaint is unclear and ambiguous in many respects, and contains typographical errors in 
key paragraphs. For example, Paragraph 8 of the Complaint states that ""an authorized agent and employee of Centrix[] told [an 
agent of Southerns] that Defendant Centrix could not contract with Southern because a competitor of Southern had an 
agreement with upper management of Centrix not specifically setting forth that Centrix could not contract with Southern."" Compl. 
P 8 (emphasis added). The Court also has difficulty understanding whether the statement made regarding fraud was in 
reference to all the Plaintiffs or just one of them, Southern Volkswagen, Inc. At oral argument, counsel for Plaintiffs proffered that 
the statement was directed towards all Plaintiffs, but the Court has difficulty understanding how such a statement could be 
interpreted that way when there are eight separate plaintiffs. Considering the allegation as presently stated in the Complaint, 
even in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, the alleged statement does not seem to be directed to all Plaintiffs. "
1252,3," A more appropriate claim for defamation would be against Plaintiffs' competitor who told Centrix that Plaintiffs are a ""fraud."" It 
was that statement which, according to the Plaintiffs, induced Centrix not to form a relationship with the Plaintiffs. "
1255,4," It is axiomatic that HN21[
] in order for a cause of action in antitrust to exist in most circumstances, other than under a per se approach, the Defendant must have market power in the relevant market. See e.g., Murrow Furniture Galleries, Inc. v. 
Thomasville Furniture Industries, Inc., 889 F.2d 524, 528 (4th Cir. 1989); HOVENKAMP, supra, at § 3.1 (""Many antitrust 
violations require the plaintiff to show that the defendant has some market power."")."
1255,5," In the landmark decision of Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701, 97 S. Ct. 690 (1977), 
HN22[
] the Court severely limited the availability of private plaintiffs to utilize the antitrust laws as a sword by requiring 
antitrust plaintiffs to prove injury to overall competition, not just injury to the plaintiff itself. The famous line emerging from that 
case was that ""the antitrust laws, however, were enacted for the protection of competition, not competitors.'"" Id. at 488 (quoting 
Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 320, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510, 82 S. Ct. 1502 (1962)). Even in the most favorable light, 
Plaintiffs' Complaint does not allege any facts which suggest that Defendant's behavior negatively affects competition. Plaintiffs' 
conclusory statement that ""antitrust injury, in the form of the exclusion of Southern for specified automotive loans financed 
through Defendant Centrix and its associated credit unions, resulted and will continue to result in injury and harm to Southern 
and Maryland consumers[,]"" Compl. P 24, is not sufficient. This statement fails to meet even the 12(b)(6) standard because 
HN23[
] ""the pleader may not evade [Rule 12(b)(6)] requirements by merely alleging a bare legal conclusion[.]"" Dickson, 309 F.3d at 213. "
1258,6," Plaintiffs bald assertion that Defendant made the defamatory statement with ""the intent to cause economic harm and injury to 
Southern's business"" is not sufficient to withstand scrutiny under 12(b)(6). As previously stated, the Court need not accept legal 
conclusions couched as factual allegations. Papasan, 478 U.S. at 286. Plaintiffs offer no facts to indicate how they arrived at the 
conclusion that Defendant's statement was intended to, or did, cause economic injury to the Plaintiffs. "
1267,1," In a future opinion, this Court shall analyze Defendants' summary judgment motion with respect to the traditional market 
definition approach for determining market power. The opinion shall consider mirtazapine in the context of the several other 
antidepressant compounds in order to determine the bounds of the relevant antitrust market that a reasonable juror could find."
1267,2," The FDA lists the patent numbers in the Orange Book that the New Drug Application (""NDA"") identifies as being associated 
with that NDA. "
1268,3," Until the Federal Circuit decided Warner-Lambert Co. v. Apotex Corp., 316 F.3d 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2003), holding that Hatch 
Waxman does not permit an action for induced infringement in a case with facts mirroring those in Organon I, it was not clear 
that the patent infringement actions were lacking in merit."
1268,4," These remaining counterclaims included fraudulent procurement of the '099 patent from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office 
(""PTO"") and late-listing of the '099 patent in the FDA Orange Book, both of which the current Plaintiffs have pursued."
1268,5," Plaintiffs' several other claims were dismissed by Order of this Court dated September 8, 2004. Like the Generics, Plaintiffs 
alleged that (1) Organon obtained the '099 patent through fraud on the PTO, (2) Organon improperly listed the '099 patent in the 
Orange Book, and (3) Organon baselessly initiated patent infringement actions in Organon I. This Court dismissed those claims 
because Plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the fraud claim, and because the improper listing and baseless litigation claims had 
already been dismissed by this Court as to the Generic Plaintiffs in Organon II and were thus precluded by the doctrine of 
collateral estoppel or the doctrine of law of the case. Several direct purchaser Plaintiffs settled with Organon soon after the 
Order. "
1270,6," Plaintiffs further assert that their proffered direct evidence makes it unnecessary to even define a relevant antitrust product 
market."
1270,7," Indeed, HN16[
] although not explicitly forbidding a direct evidence approach, the Third Circuit has emphasized the 
importance of establishing monopoly power by the traditional market definition approach, i.e. first defining a relevant market by 
product interchangeability or cross-price elasticity of demand and then determining monopoly power therein by evaluating 
market share. E.g., Fineman v. Armstrong World Industries, Inc., 980 F.2d 171, 199-201 (3d Cir. 1992) (defining product by 
market by reasonable interchangeability of use and then analyzing monopoly power by market share analysis because ""starting 
point must be to determine [the defendant's] market share of the resilient product market""); SmithKline Corp. v. Eli Lilly & Co., 
575 F.2d 1056, 1063-65 (3d Cir. 1978) (asserting that ""'in s 2 cases, the search for the relevant market must be undertaken and 
pursued with relentless clarity … reasonable interchangeability of use or the cross-elasticity of demand determines the 
boundaries of a product market'"" and subsequently analyzing monopoly power within the defined market through market share 
analysis) quoting Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 325, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510, 82 S. Ct. 1502 (1962); see also Queen 
City Pizza, Inc. v. Domino's Pizza, Inc., 124 F.3d at 436, 442 (""where the plaintiff fails to define its proposed relevant market with 
reference to the rule of reasonable interchangeability and cross-elasticity of demand … the relevant market is legally insufficient 
and a motion to dismiss may be granted""); American Bearing Co., Inc. v. Litton Industries, Inc., 729 F.2d 943, 949 (3d Cir. 1984) 
(""the market power analysis begins with a definition of the relevant product market for the particular product and is an element of 
a section 2 violation that plaintiff must establish to prevail"")."
1270,8," However, these cases do not utilize direct evidence in the ways Plaintiffs argue that this Court should. First, none of them of 
use direct evidence to define the antitrust product market or find that it is unnecessary to do so. Second, where they do evaluate 
direct evidence to analyze monopoly power in an already defined product market (whether by stipulation or traditional 
methodology), they find the direct evidence presented to be insufficient and ultimately utilize traditional market power analysis 
instead."
1270,9," This evidence was averred by uncontested certification of Plaintiffs' economic expert, Dr. Jeffrey Leitzinger. Specifically, the net 
price of Remeron upon generic entry in January 2003 was $ 2.29 per 15mg tablet. The first generic, Teva, entered the market at 
that time with a net price of $ 1.37. Six months later, several other generics entered the market with Mylan pricing at $ 0.49 and 
Teva lowering its price to $ 0.47. By October 2003, Teva priced at $ 0.17 and Mylan priced at $ 0.16. Plaintiffs' summary 
judgment brief, in several sections, acknowledges this set of facts to be ""small."" "
1271,10," Plaintiffs also offer the following as direct evidence of market power: (1) testimony of Plaintiffs' economic expert, Dr. Jeffrey 
Leitzinger that for a 3-year period prior to generic entry Remeron's price had increased from approximately $ 1.86 per tablet to 
approximately $ 2.29 per tablet, (2) Organon's internal documentation showing that Organon lost a significant percentage of its 
sales following generic entry, and (3) testimony of a Defense economic expert, Dr. Januz Ordover, that Organon had the ability 
to charge prices above short-run marginal cost prior to generic competition. Plaintiffs devote only a few sentences discussing 
these facts and offer no analysis about how these facts suffice to permit a reasonable juror to find monopoly power. As will be 
discussed, without evidence that sheds light on material factors such as Organon's price relative to its total costs (marginal and 
fixed) and whether output was restricted, monopoly power cannot be found as a matter of law. See, e.g., PHILLIP E. AREEDA 
AND HERBERT HOVENKAMP, ANTITRUST LAW, AN ANALYSIS OF ANTITRUST PRINCIPLES AND THEIR APPLICATION, 
p. 516 (2d ed. 2002) (""No matter how accurately measured, of course, a substantial excess of price over marginal cost does not 
necessarily bring excess returns on investment. A firm generates excess profit only if price exceeds its average total cost, 
including its cost of capital."") (emphasis added); William M. Landes and Richard A. Posner, Market Power in Antitrust Cases, 94 
HARV. L. REV. 937, 939 (1981) (""When the deviation of price from marginal cost … simply reflects certain fixed costs, there is 
no occasion for antitrust concern."")."
1271,11," In Geneva Pharmaceuticals, the market was already defined by traditional methodology, thus direct evidence was only 
considered to establish monopoly power within the market."
1271,12," Plaintiffs concede that ""price/cost differential is a standard economic definition of market power"" in their Rule 56.1 statement in 
support of their motion for partial summary judgment. "
1272,13," In addition, Plaintiffs provided expert testimony that made this point. In his report, Plaintiffs' expert pharmaceutical economist, 
Dr. Stephen Schondelmeyer, stated ""Hatch-Waxman simplified the regulatory hurdles for prospective generic drug 
manufacturers by eliminating the need for generic companies to file lengthy and costly NDAs in order to obtain FDA approval. 
Instead, such companies … rely on the safety and effectiveness data already supplied to the FDA by the brand name 
manufacturer … [thus] the first generic competitor to enter a market typically does so at a price substantially lower than the price 
of the equivalent brand-name drug."" Plaintiffs also offered the deposition of Dr. Juanz Ordover, Organon's economic expert, 
wherein he stated ""the ability of the generics to price as low as they did is a peculiar feature, a particular feature of the 
pharmaceutical marketplace surrounded by the various regulatory provisions."" "
1273,14," Since Plaintiffs' direct evidence fails to establish monopoly power, a fortiori, it cannot define the relevant product market (or 
render it unnecessary to do so), as Plaintiffs suggest. "
1286,1," Teva acquired Copley (and its generic nabumetone products) in August, 1999. In re Relafen Antitrust Litig., 218 F.R.D. at 341 
n.3."
1286,2," Former lead plaintiff Meijer, Inc. withdrew as a class representative by notice dated July 10, 2003. [Doc. No. 92]. "
1288,3," There has been too much loose talk in these cases about the Court making ""findings."" This is error. The Court never uses that 
word in the quoted passages and this Court is quite cognizant of the difference between a finding of fact and a ruling of law. See, 
e.g., United States v. Green, 346 F. Supp. 2d. 259, 281-82 (D. Mass. 2004); Berthoff v. United States, 140 F. Supp.2d 50, 66, 
90-91 (D.Mass. 2001); see also Arthur R. Miller, The Pretrial Rush to Judgment: Are the ""Litigation Explosion,"" ""Liability Crisis,"" 
and Efficiency Cliches Eroding our Day in Court and Jury Trial Commitments?, 78 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 982, 1076-1077, 1082-1086, 
1091-1093 (2003). The quoted passages express the Court's considered and careful legal reasoning and are, of course, subject 
to de novo review on appeal. Straughn v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 250 F.3d 23, 33 (1st Cir. 2001); see Miller, 78 N.Y.U. L. Rev. at 
1082 (""the accepted wisdom about the law-fact spectrum is that judges determine the law and juries the facts""). "
1298,4," The End Payors submitted a detailed memorandum arguing against SmithKline's defense based on the Noerr-Pennington 
doctrine. End Payors' Opp'n [Doc. No. 184]. These arguments were specifically addressed in the Court's discussion. In re 
Relafen Antitrust Litig., 346 F. Supp. 2d. at 359 n.3, 362-64, 366-67. Thus, the Court's Noerr-Pennington discussion relates 
directly both to the viability of the End Payors' claims as well as to the merits of their particular arguments. "
1299,5," Indeed, it is perhaps the central theme of the proposed settlement that claimants and their insurers from states that have 
enacted Illinois Brick repealers are treated far better than claimants and insurers from states that have not. This Court 
accordingly has had to consider motions to intervene from the States of Arkansas [Doc. No. 324], Idaho [Doc. No. 322], Illinois 
[Doc. No. 320], Maryland [Doc. No. 318], Oregon [Doc. No. 316], and Washington [Doc. No. 314], all of which raise Illinois Brick 
issues. 431 U.S. 720, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707, 97 S. Ct. 2061 (1977). The entire matter is one of important and recurrent litigation. See 
e.g. James Matthews, The Conundrum of Ciardi v. Hoffman-La Roche, Ltd.: Judicial Decision Making when the Plain Meaning of 
a Statute Collides Irrationally with Established Jurisprudence, 89 Mass. L. Rev. 35 (2004). "
1312,1," The District Court's Findings of Fact will be referred to as ""FF"" hereafter. "
1317,2," In some cases which we find distinguishable, courts have indicated that exclusive dealing contracts of short duration are not 
violations of the antitrust laws. See, e.g., CDC Techs., Inc. v. IDEXX Lab., Inc., 186 F.3d 74, 81 (2d Cir. 1999) (""distributors"" only 
provided sales leads and sales increased after competitor imposed exclusive dealing arrangements); Omega Envtl., Inc. v. 
Gilbarco, Inc., 127 F.3d 1157, 1163 (9th Cir. 1997) (manufacturer with 55% market share sold both to consumers and 
distributors, market showed decreasing prices and fluctuating shares); Ryko Mfg. Co. v. Eden Servs., 823 F.2d 1215 (8th Cir. 
1987) (manufacturer sold its products through both direct sales and distributors); Roland Mach. Co. v. Dresser Indus., Inc., 749 
F.2d 380 (7th Cir. 1984) (contract between dealer and manufacturer did not contain exclusive dealing provision). "
1318,*, The authors do not disclose whether the bow ties are blue polka-dot patterns or other designs. 
1327,*," The district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the three state common law claims and the claim that, in 
addition to violating the Sherman Act, Bell Atlantic violated the District of Columbia Antitrust Act. 201 F. Supp. 2d at 135. Covad 
does not challenge that ruling on appeal. "
1330,**," Specifically, we do not address Bell Atlantic's arguments that the court should presume any harm to competition from false 
advertising is de minimis and that a plaintiff must plead actual falsity in order to state an antitrust claim. "
1331,***," Covad also relies upon United States v. Microsoft Corp., 159 F.R.D. 318 (D.D.C. 1995), for the proposition that a 
preannouncement campaign directed at consumers may violate the Sherman Act. Although the district court, in rejecting a 
proposed consent decree did suggest that a preannouncement campaign might unlawfully ""contribute to the acquisition, 
maintenance, or exercise of market share,"" id. at 336, because the Government had made no allegation concerning a 
preannouncement campaign, id. at 335, this court expressly disapproved the district court's consideration of that subject. 312 
U.S. App. D.C. 378, 56 F.3d 1448, 1459 (1995). "
1335,1," NicSand argues that 3M has obtained monopoly power in the ""DIY [do-it-yourself] retail automotive coated abrasives"" market; 
3M opposes the use of these terms to define the relevant market. Because there is no need for a ruling on this issue, the court 
uses the terms ""sandpaper market"" or ""abrasives market"" interchangeably to refer to the market for NicSand's products. "
1341,1, The Court grants Defendant's request for judicial notice in support of its motion to dismiss. 
1344,1," Defendants AFNI and Nationwide have been terminated as parties to this case. On December 2, 2004, Plaintiff filed a notice of 
settlement with Defendant Online and indicated that formal papers to that effect would soon be filed with this court. "
1345,2," In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), the Eleventh Circuit adopted as binding precedent all 
decisions rendered by the former Fifth Circuit prior to October 1, 1981. "
1347,3," As noted by the McCloud court, while 1681h(e) makes an exception for those tort claims alleging malice or willful intent to 
injure, the definition of negligence cannot include such mens rea. Id. at 1342. "
1356,*," Honorable Richard W. Goldberg, Judge, United States Court of International Trade, sitting by designation."
1356,1," Schering also markets another version of this product, K-Dur 10, the coating of which is also covered by the '743 patent. The 
difference between the two is dosage: K-Dur 20 contains twice as much potassium as K-Dur 10. This lawsuit only involves K-Dur 
20. The '743 patent claims a pharmaceutical dosage unit in tablet form for oral administration of potassium chloride. The tablet 
contains potassium chloride crystals coated with a cellulose-type material. The novel feature in the '743 patent is the viscous 
coating, which is applied to potassium chloride crystals. The coating provides a sustained-release delivery of the potassium 
chloride."
1356,2," The FDA must approve any new drug before it can be marketed or sold in the United States. Previously, applications for FDA 
approval proceeded under a new drug application (""NDA""). 21 U.S.C. § 355(b). This cumbersome and involved process required 
each applicant to submit safety and efficacy studies, even if it duplicated previous studies done on identical drugs with the same 
ingredients. In 1984, Congress passed Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act (the ""Hatch-Waxman Act""), 
Pub. L. No. 98-417, 98 Stat. 1585 (1984). The purpose of the Hatch-Waxman Act was threefold: (1) to reduce the average price "
1357,," paid by consumers; (2) preserve the technologies pioneered by the brand-name pharmaceutical companies; and (3) create an 
abbreviated new drug application (""ANDA"") to bring generic drugs to the market. The ANDA process allows the manufacturers of generic drugs to gain early entry into the market. Hatch-Waxman's truncated 
procedure avoids the duplication of expensive safety and efficacy studies, so long as the generic manufacturer proves that its 
drug is bio-equivalent to the already-approved brand-name/pioneer drug. As part of the application process, the generic 
applicant must certify that the relevant patent(s) on the brand-name drug are either invalid or will not be infringed. This is 
commonly known as a ""Paragraph IV certification."" The patent holder is then notified of the ANDA, and if the patent holder sues 
for infringement within forty-five days of receiving the notice, the FDA automatically institutes a thirty-month delay on the generic 
manufacturer's ANDA approval. See 21 U.S.C. 355(j)(5)(B)(iii). As part of its ANDA, Upsher certified that Schering's patent was either invalid or that Upsher did not infringe on that patent. 
When Schering brought suit, the thirty-month delay was activated."
1357,3," Schering's focus on Niacor is consistent with its previous attempt to purchase the rights to Niaspan, another sustained-release 
niacin product, which Kos was in the process of developing during this time. Negotiations between Kos and Schering broke 
down several months before Upsher offered Niacor to Schering. "
1358,4," Indeed, there is the indication of some internal independence between Schering's evaluation of Niaspan and Niacor, as two 
different teams examined the products and arrived at similar estimates."
1358,5," On December 22, 1995, ESI submitted an ANDA to the FDA that reference K-Dur 20 and contained a Paragraph IV certification 
to Schering's '743 patent. On December 29, 1995, ESI notified Schering of this certification containing data from a study 
demonstrating Micro-K 20's bioequivalency to Schering's K-Dur 20's tablets."
1358,6," There was also a side agreement in this settlement that provided for a payment of $ 15 million in return for the right to license 
generic enalpril and buspirone from ESI."
1358,7," ESI provided Schering with information related to the Micro-K 20's current approval status. The summary noted the difficulties 
ESI had up to that point in trying to obtain FDA approval for its proposed generic version. The primary concern was ESI's 
bioequivalence study, which had been performed in 1989. The FDA found five different deficiencies with regard to that study, 
and ESI did not respond to those deficiencies until May 1997. ESI then began a new bioequivalence study in December 1997."
1358,8," Under the final settlement agreement, dated June 19, 1998, Schering agreed to pay ESI a $ 5 million noncontingent payment, 
representing legal fees, and an additional $ 10 million contingent on ESI's FDA approval. Schering and ESI also entered into a 
contemporaneous license agreement whereby ESI granted Schering the licenses to enalpril and buspirone in exchange for $ 15 
million. "
1359,9," On October 12, 2001, the Complaint against AHP was withdrawn to consider a proposed consent agreement. The FTC 
approved a final consent order on April 2, 2002. AHP was not a party to either the trial before the ALJ or any subsequent 
proceedings, and is not a party to this appeal. The legality of the Schering's settlement with ESI/AHP, however, remained at 
issue with respect to Schering."
1359,10," The contradictory nature of the Commission's opinion is exemplified by its assessment of the ESI settlement. Although the 
Commission found the payment to be unjustified and in violation of the law, it simultaneously explained that ""as a matter of 
prosecutorial discretion, we might not have brought a stand-alone case based on such relatively limited evidence."" "
1361,11," The majority of antitrust claims are analyzed under the rule of reason. State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U.S. 3, 20, 139 L. Ed. 2d 
199, 118 S. Ct. 275 (1997). Courts generally determine the reasonableness of a particular agreement by reference to the 
surrounding facts and circumstances under the rule of reason. Generally, a per se analysis is applied only in limited 
circumstances, and after experience and pattern establish that a particular class of restraint is manifestly anticompetitive. 
Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 441 U.S. 1, 9, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1, 99 S. Ct. 1551 (1979). Essentially, 
the per se rule should only be employed when the conduct has ""pernicious effect on competition"" and ""lack[s]…any redeeming 
virtue."" Continental T.V. Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 50, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568, 97 S. Ct. 2549 (1977)."
1361,12," By and large, the construction of the rule of reason inquiry has remained unaltered since the Supreme Court first articulated it 
in Chicago Board of Trade v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 238, 38 S. Ct. 242, 244, 62 L. Ed. 683 (1918): The court must ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before 
and after the restraint was imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable. The history of the restraint, 
the evil believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, are all 
relevant facts."
1361,13," Indiana Dentists noted an exception to the burden of proving market power: ""Since the purpose of the inquiries into market 
definition and market power is to determine whether an arrangement has the potential for genuine adverse effects on 
competition, 'proof of actual detrimental effects, such as a reduction of output,' can obviate the need for an inquiry into market 
power, which is but a 'surrogate for detrimental effects.'"" 476 U.S. at 460-61 (citing P. Areeda, Antitrust Law P 1511, p. 429 
(1986)). "
1362,14," On remand, the district court in Valley Drug still applied a per se analysis, and found those agreements to be illegal. See In re 
Terazosin Hydrochloride Antitrust Litig., 352 F. Supp. 2d 1279 (S.D. Fla. 2005). We note that the case at bar is wholly different 
from Valley Drug. The critical difference is that the agreements at issue in Valley Drug did not involve final settlements of patent 
litigation, and, moreover, the Valley Drug agreements did not permit the generic company to market its product before patent 
expiration. On remand, the district court emphasized that the ""agreement did not resolve or even simplify Abbott's patent 
infringement action… to the contrary, the Agreement tended to prolong that dispute to Abbott's advantage, delaying generic 
entry for a longer period of time than the patent or any reasonable interpretation of the patent's protections would have 
provided."" In re Terazosin Hydrochloride Antitrust Litig., 352 F. Supp. 2d 1279 (S.D. Fla. 2005). Given these material 
distinctions, the same analysis cannot apply."
1362,15," The Commission wrote that it would neither address the exclusionary power of Schering's patent nor compare the patent's 
scope to the exclusionary effect of the settlements. Rather, the Commission grounds its decision in the untenable supposition 
that without a payment there would have been different settlements with both ESI and Schering, resulting in earlier entry dates: 
""we cannot assume that Schering had a right to exclude Upsher's generic competition for the life of the patent any more than we 
can assume that Upsher had the right to enter earlier. In fact we make neither assumption, but focus on the effect that 
Schering's payment had to Upsher was likely to have on the generic entry date which the parties would otherwise have agreed 
to in a settlement."" "
1363,16," In fact, Upsher received final FDA approval to market its Klor-Con generic version in November 1998. ESI followed suit, 
gaining FDA approval for Micro-K 20 in June 1999. "
1364,17," Upsher began selling Klor Con M20 on September 1, 2001."
1364,18," It is patently obvious that the Commission's opinion did not employ this analysis; preferring, instead, to proceed through its 
laborious rule of reason framework, eventually branding the challenged restraints to be illegal horizontal market allocation 
agreements. The Commission was ostensibly silent with regard to the '743 patent, yet it cavalierly dismissed our holding in 
Valley Drug, stating that a determination on the merits of the underlying patent disputes was ""not supported by law or logic."" "
1365,19," While the Commission's opinion conspicuously notes that it does not ""adopt his terminology,"" it nonetheless endorses 
Bresnahan's incentive analysis: ""We agree that there are strong monetary incentives for the pioneer and the generic to share the 
pioneer's substantial profits until the expiration of the patent, rather than compete head-to-head. The existence of these strong 
incentives, standing alone, obviously does not amount to proof of a law violation, but it may help to resolve conflicting 
inferences."""
1365,20," In his testimony before the ALJ, Dr. Levy asserted that Niacor was toxic to the liver and criticized Schering for not taking liver 
biopsies on Upsher's clinical patients, who had long-since exited the trial program. Levy's later testimony revealed that he was 
not an expert in cholesterol-reducing drugs, and admitted that he ""probably overstated"" his opinion. The Commission's opinion 
emphasizes that it did not rely on Dr. Levy's testimony, yet again it arrives at the same conclusion, despite what we would 
presume to be a similar lack of knowledge in cholesterol-reducing drugs. It puzzles us that the Commission's opinion carefully 
traces Schering's due diligence and goes to great pains to highlight the intricate details, but still scolds Schering for not doing 
more. "
1366,21," The Commission's opinion cited no authority for this assumption, but it also rejects ""any suggestion that a reasonably 
adequate product review must necessarily take months, because the opportunity may no longer be on the table."""
1366,22," This opinion was offered by a Kos official, who saw the U.S. market as ""more appealing than the European market."" Evidence 
shows, and even the FTC's experts agreed, that the worldwide market Schering had acquired rights to was at least as large as 
the U.S. market."
1366,23," Niaspan's sales were in fact disappointing. Market analysts predicted its 1999 sales to reach $ 169.3 million, and Schering's 
more conservative estimate calculated $ 101 million for the same year. In actuality, the sales were only $ 37.9 million."
1366,24," At the time of the opinion in Universal Camera, an ""examiner"" performed the same functions as an ALJ."
1366,25," At trial, the FTC selected eight products that Schering had licensed from companies other than Upsher for comparative 
analysis. Five of those eight products were never marketed. "
1370,26, Directly contrary to our opinion in Valley Drug.
1370,27," The Schering agreements would necessarily be stronger than those in Valley Drug, where the facts demonstrated the 
likelihood of an invalid patent, because a valid patent could operate to exclude all infringing products for the life of the patent. "
1373,1," Plaintiffs have attached their exhibits to a pleading entitled ""Evidence in Support of Plaintiffs' Opposition to the Defendants' [sic] 
Motion for Summary Judgment and in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment."" BNSF has submitted its 
evidence separated by tabs identifying the deposition exhibit numbers and deposition testimony that correspond to the evidence. 
Thus, citations to Plaintiffs' evidence shall be cited for example as ""TRH Evid. Ex. 3"" or ""TRH Evid. Schorno Depo. at 3:5"". 
Similarly, citations to BNSF's evidence shall be cited ""BNSF Evid. Ex. 32""or ""BNSF Evid. Kalb I Depo. at 7:21""."
1373,2," BNSF was created as a result of a merger between the Burlington Northern and the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway 
Company. (See, e.g., BNSF Evid. Kalt Report at p. 2, ¶ 4.) "
1374,3," There is, however, evidence in the record that suggests BNSF terminated the leases for other reasons, such as TRH's refusal 
to comply with safety requirements, failure to pay certain ""demurrage"" charges, and customer complaints. (BNSF Mem. at 2 n.3; 
see also TRH Evid. Exs. 72, 83.) "
1375,4," The parties cite testimony and documents that are not included in the record. Any evidence not submitted to the Court has not 
been considered in ruling on these motions."
1375,5," In the FAC, Plaintiffs also seek relief under 15 U.S.C. § 26, which provides that ""[a]ny person, firm, corporation, or association 
shall be entitled to sue for an have injunctive relief, ... against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws ... ."" 
(FAC ¶ 1.) That section also provides, however, that ""nothing herein shall be construed to entitle any person, firm, corporation, 
or association, except the United States, to bring suit for injunctive relief against any common carrier subject to the jurisdiction of 
the Surface Transportation Board under subtitle IV of title 49."" 15 U.S.C. § 26 (emphasis added). Neither party has raised this 
issue; yet it appears undisputed that BNSF is a common carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board. 
(See, e.g., BNSF Mem. at 15:9-11). Accordingly, as a matter of law, Plaintiffs cannot obtain an injunction against BNSF on the 
first two causes of action. "
1376,6," Plaintiffs requested leave to file the Dagher opinion pursuant to Northern District Civil Local Rule 7-3(d). Plaintiffs' request is 
GRANTED."
1376,7," The Court concurs with BNSF that the ""vertical foreclosure"" theory of liability is, in essence, a ""monopoly leveraging"" theory of 
liability. The Ninth Circuit, however, has rejected the ""monopoly leveraging"" doctrine as an independent theory of liability under 
Section 2, concluding that ""[i]f there is a dangerous probability that a monopoly will be created by leveraging conduct, then the 
conduct will be reached under the doctrine of attempted monopoly."" See Alaska Airlines, 948 F.2d at 549. In that case, the Ninth 
Circuit noted that the ""monopoly leveraging"" theory of liability had its origins in the Second Circuit's decision in Berkey Photo, 
Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 603 F.2d 263 (2d Cir. 1979). The Alaska Airlines court rejected monopoly leveraging, as articulated 
in Berkey Photo, as an independent theory of liability because it permitted a firm to be found liable for a Section 2 violation ""even 
in the absence of an attempt to monopolize the leveraged market,"" and also failed to recognize the distinction between lawful 
natural monopolies and unlawful monopolies. Alaska Airlines, 948 F.2d at 547-548. As the Court is bound by the Ninth Circuit's 
decision in Alaska Airlines, it has evaluated Plaintiffs' claim of monopoly leveraging and vertical foreclosure theories under the 
rubric of attempted monopolization. "
1377,8," Plaintiffs maintain that by requiring a transloader to enter into the TSA, BNSF precludes the transloader from dealing directly 
with its customers and thereby fixes the prices for transloading services and also sets maximum trucking prices, which Plaintiffs 
claim results in vertical price fixing. (See, e.g., TRH Supp. Br. at 2-3.)"
1377,9," The Court recognizes that the Oracle case addressed the relevant market in the context of an alleged violation of Section 7 of 
the Clayton Act. However, the court's discussion of both the definition of a relevant product market and the means by which that 
market may be defined is equally applicable here. See, e.g., Rebel Oil, 51 F.3d at 1435-1436. "
1379,10," Plaintiffs contend that this e-mail exchange demonstrates that BNSF created a monopoly in the El Paso transloading market 
by granting Stagecoach exclusive rights to provide transloading services at BNSF's El Paso facility. (See Tr. at 12:6-10.) For the 
reasons set forth herein, this evidence does not create a disputed issue of material fact on the issue of the relevant product 
market."
1379,11," Although BNSF filed separate motions to strike the Tye and Burris reports, it has included these reports as evidence in support 
of its motion. Because BNSF relies on these reports to argue why its motion should be granted, the Court has considered them 
for purposes of ruling on the motions."
1379,12," Although the Court does not rest its conclusions on the following point, it is cognizant of the fact that Dr. Tye confirmed this 
fact in his deposition when he admitted that he did not evaluate cross-elasticity of demand or supply for any proposed market. 
(See Docket No. 121, BNSF Motion to Strike Expert Report of Dr. William Tye, Tye Depo. at 168:11-15.) "
1380,13," The deadline imposed upon the parties for concluding expert discovery was October 6, 2003. BNSF's motion for summary 
judgment was filed on November 14, 2003. BNSF in its briefing put Plaintiffs on notice that BNSF believed Plaintiffs' expert 
testimony on the alleged product market was deficient. At no point in these proceedings, however, have Plaintiffs contended or 
provided evidence that Dr. Tye in fact evaluated the alleged product markets in the context of cross-elasticity of supply and 
demand. The Court can only conclude from this failure that no such evidence exists. "
1382,14," As noted in Section V.A, Plaintiffs also alleged that BNSF's use of the TSA resulted in vertical price fixing, a claim that fails 
because Plaintiffs failed to establish a relevant market in which BNSF unreasonably restrained competition through use of the 
alleged vertical price restraints."
1382,15," Of course, it is also undisputed that Plaintiffs never entered into a TSA with BNSF, seriously undermining any assertion that as 
to their price fixing claims, they suffered antitrust injury by reason of this agreement."
1382,16," BNSF does not dispute that it used the prices quoted by persons entering into the TSA to create bundled pricing bids to BNSF 
customers. (See, e.g., BNSF Mem. at 27:5-7; BNSF Evid. Schorno I Depo. at 110:1-25.) The TSA, therefore, cannot be 
classified simply as an agreement between a buyer and a seller about the terms on which they will do business with one 
another, which would not necessarily violate Section 1. See, e.g, 49ers Chevrolet, 803 F.2d at 1468. "
1384,17," Plaintiffs initially asserted these state law causes of action under California law. However, the Court previously determined that 
they should be addressed under Texas and Colorado state law. (See Docket No. 113, Order Granting Motion to Have This Court 
Determine Applicable Law.) "
1390,1," Plaintiffs allege ""on information and belief"" that the Doman defendants entered into similar arrangements with Atlantic Coast 
Lumber Co. and Futter Lumber, see Am. Cplt. P15, distributors not parties to this litigation. Defendants argue that such 
allegations on information and belief are insufficient as a matter of law. See Doman Br. at 13 & n. 8. However, courts have 
routinely considered claims made on information and belief. Langadinos v. American Airlines, Inc., 199 F.3d 68, 73 (1st Cir. 
2000) (""a plaintiff can make allegations either on the basis of personal knowledge or on 'information and belief'""); see also 
Perington Wholesale, Inc. v. Burger King Corp., 631 F.2d 1369, 1372 (10th Cir. 1979); Carroll v. Morrison Hotel Corp., 149 F.2d 
404, 406 (7th Cir. 1945)."
1390,2," Plaintiffs allege that at the time of termination, E&L was planning to take delivery of 10,000,000 board feet of Doman lumber 
(presumably green hem-fir lumber) in Red Hook, New York, and that another shipment of 6,000,000 feet of lumber was expected "
1391,," to arrive in February 2004. Plaintiff initially sought a temporary restraining order, which was denied on February 17, 2004. See 
Dkt. No. 2. During the February 17, 2004, proceedings, the court set a preliminary injunction hearing for March 11, 2004. In a 
letter dated February 23, 2004, plaintiffs withdrew their motion for a preliminary injunction. See letter from E. Christopher Murray, 
dated February 23, 2004."
1391,3," However, an affidavit by Mr. Cook (president of both E&L and CBC) does contain an additional detail suggesting that 
defendants do somehow control the shipment of green hem-fir lumber by rail. According to Mr. Cook, ""Doman is now charging $ 
60 to $ 80 per MBF greater for any lumber that is transported by rail, as opposed to by ship. Thus, green hem-fir lumber that is 
transported by rail is at least 20 to 30 percent more expensive than green hem-fir lumber that is transported by ship."" Cook Aff. 
P3. This statement implies that the price of lumber shipped by rail is controlled by the Doman defendants rather than the result 
of increased costs due to the use of rail transportation. However, read as implied, the statement contradicts the amended 
complaint when discussing TimberWest lumber. See Am. Cplt. P29 (""the only way for Timber West [sic] to deliver green hem-fir 
lumber is by rail, which increases the cost of green hem-fir lumber by more than 10 percent . . . [and] is thus not a comparative 
or substitute product""). "
1392,4," It should be noted that this circuit does not require that foreign ""liquidation proceedings be identical to United States bankruptcy 
proceedings."" Allstate, 994 F.2d at 999; see also In re Petition of Brierley, 145 B.R. 151, 166 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 1992) (""nothing 
dictates that the foreign law be a carbon copy of our law""). "
1393,5," Plaintiffs also argue that ""the Canadian Bankruptcy Court does not have jurisdiction . . . to adjudicate claims involving conduct 
within the United States."" Plaintiff Br. at 10. But plaintiffs fail to show why that is the case. Plaintiffs also try to analogize this case 
to various exceptions to the automatic stay provisions enshrined in the U.S. Bankruptcy law, see Pl. Br. at 11 (citing 11 U.S.C. § 
362(b)(1) and (4)), but those provisions only exempt criminal and government suits, not private civil suits."
1393,6," As explained infra, any remaining state law claims against the Doman defendants would have to be brought in Canada. "
1394,7," Accordingly, plaintiffs' tying claim would also fail. Once Sherwood's dominance over the green hem-fir lumber were disrupted 
by competitors, Sherwood would have no power to illegally tie the sale of green hem-fir lumber to its finished-wood products."
1394,8," See Pl. Br. at 13 (noting ""the ability of this product [green hem-fir lumber] to grow naturally in great quantities in certain 
terrain""). "
1395,9," Indeed, during oral argument, counsel for plaintiffs opined that end-users in such areas likely use green hem-fir lumber as well."
1395,10," As the Fifth Circuit has stated: ""Lest any other former distributors succumb to the temptation of treble damages, we reiterate 
that it is simply not an antitrust violation for a manufacturer to contract with a new distributor, and as a consequence, to 
terminate his relationship with a former distributor, even if the effect of the new contract is to seriously damage the former 
distributor's business."" Burdett Sound, Inc. v. Altec Corp., 515 F.2d 1245, 1249 (5th Cir. 1975). "
1396,11," Plaintiffs' allegation that E&L was denied the opportunity to purchase green hem-fir lumber outright (as opposed to simply 
distributing the lumber), see Pl. Br. at 14; Am. Cplt. P24, does not change the analysis. For antitrust purposes, there is no 
allegation of a competitor unable to bring its product to market as a result of defendants' conduct. "
1406,1," Regence is incorrect in arguing that ""[t]o prove a conspiracy, a plaintiff must offer evidence that is 'explicit and requires no 
inferences to establish the proposition or conclusion being asserted.' In re Citric Acid Litig., 191 F.3d 1090, 1094 (9th Cir. 1999)."" 
See Regence's Brief at p. 8. Regence ascribes a breadth to the quote from Citric Acid that is not justified. In context, the quote 
was discussing the definition of direct evidence, as opposed to circumstantial evidence. Later in the decision, the Circuit holds 
that a conspiracy can be shown by either direct or circumstantial evidence. Id. at 1093."
1406,2," A different standard for summary judgment applies when the plaintiff submits direct evidence of conspiracy. See In re 
Coordinated Pretrial Proceedings in Petroleum Products Antitrust Litigation, 906 F.2d 432 (9th Cir.1990). That standard does not "
1407,," apply here where MIA's evidence of conspiracy is entirely circumstantial. Citric Acid, 191 F.3d at 1096 (holding that Petroleum 
Products standard does not apply in case where evidence of conspiracy is entirely circumstantial). "
1408,3," MIA also challenges Colleran's explanation by pointing out that he never warned MIA about the disparagement before sending 
the termination letter. MIA does not explain, however, why Colleran would have any obligation or reason to warn MIA. There is 
nothing inherent in the lack of warning that is inconsistent with Colleran's explanation that the termination was based on 
disparagement. "
1410,4," The ""Shelby Hess"" referred to here is the ""Shelby Azzola"" referred to by Barbara Steele in her deposition as an MIA employee 
who ""does help on clerical work."" See Transcript of December 16, 2004, Hearing at p. 101 (where Barbara Steele refers to 
""Shelby Azzola-Hess""). "
1412,5," The Circuit's findings in Citric Acid include the following: (1) finding that ""[i]t would not be reasonable to infer that Cargill 
engaged in illegal activities"" from certain evidence, id. at 1098; (2) finding that ""it would . . . not be reasonable to infer from 
[certain notes] that Cargill conspired to fix prices"" id.; (3) finding ""implausible"" plaintiff's claim concerning Cargill's capacity 
expansion, id. at 1101; (4) finding that plaintiff's market share theory contained an unreasonable inference, id.; and (5) finding 
that the evidence ""as a whole"" does not support a reasonable inference that Cargill was acting as part of a conspiracy, id. at 
1106."
1412,6," When the Court refers to ""disparagement"" it is referring to MIA's claims that the conspirators presented misrepresentations and 
biased recommendations to county commissioners in an attempt to persuade the commissioners to reject Gemplan."
1412,7," MIA has moved to amend its complaint to clarify this claim. The proposed amendment alleges that Regence, Blue Cross, and 
the county agents conspired to block or inhibit Gemplan's entry into the market for county health insurance, and that the alleged 
disparagement is evidence of this conspiracy. The Court will assume that the claim has been so clarified in evaluating Regence's "
1413,," motion for partial summary judgment on the claim. The motion to amend raises other issues that the Court will resolve later in 
this decision. "
1414,8," Just the opposite circumstance was faced in Federal Trade Commission v. Superior Court Trial Lawyers Assoc., 493 U.S. 411, 
110 S. Ct. 768, 107 L. Ed. 2d 851 (1990). There, the Supreme Court refused to confer immunity on conspirators who engaged in 
a boycott of plaintiff because ""[t]he restraint of trade that was implemented while the boycott lasted would have had precisely the 
same anticompetititve effect if no legislation had been enacted."" Id. at 424-25. That is not the case here. The restraint of trade 
alleged by MIA (the concerted campaign of disparagement) had no anticompetitive effect until county commissioners rejected 
Gemplan. "
1415,9," The Court is not holding here that Gemplan has the legal authority to take assignment of claims from the counties. The Court is 
simply assuming the truth of Gemplan's assertions, and their legal merit may be challenged at a later point. "
1422,1," HN1[

(Ind. 2001) (quoting  Culver-Union Township Ambulance Serv. v. Steindler, 629 N.E.2d 1231, 1235 (Ind. 1994)). When reviewing 
a 12(C) motion, the reviewing court accepts as true the well-pleaded material facts alleged in the complaint, and bases its ruling 
solely on the pleadings.  Noblesville Redevelopment Comm'n v. Noblesville Assocs. Ltd. P'ship, 674 N.E.2d 558, 562 (Ind.

1423,3," The public bidding statute, as applied to school corporations, provides the school corporation the discretionary power to 
determine ""the responsible offeror"" that is ""most advantageous to the governmental body, taking into consideration price and the 
other evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposals."" Ind. Code § 5-22-9-7(a) (2004). The school corporation must have 
its purchase or lease available for the public. I.C. § 5-22-18-5(b)(3). A citizen or taxpayer of that school district may then seek to 
enjoin a contract attempted to be entered into pursuant to competitive bidding where the award is arbitrary, corrupt, or 
fraudulent.  Budd v. Bd. of County Comm'rs of St. Joseph County, 216 Ind. 35, 37, 22 N.E.2d 973, 975 (1939);  Bd. of Comm'rs

trespass), and Indiana Code section 35-43-1-2 (criminal mischief).  464 N.E.2d at 930. The Ziliaks sought damages provided in 
the section now codified at Indiana Code section 34-24-3-1 (2004), which provided for a civil action for treble damages and 
attorneys fees for violations of Indiana Code section 35-43 among others. "
1426,5," See  City of Ludlow v. Commonwealth, 247 Ky. 166, 56 S.W.2d 958 (Ky. 1933), where the city built an allegedly defective 
sewer that, when it rained, caused backups in the basements of several residences, ""producing an odor so noisome, offensive, 
and sickening that the occupants of the houses could not eat or sleep.""  Id. at 958. The state prosecuted and the City was 
convicted of maintaining a common nuisance and fined $ 1,500. Id. It appealed. The court of appeals cited three earlier 
Kentucky cases in which cities had been held criminally liable for maintaining a public nuisance. The court reversed and 
remanded for a new trial on the grounds that the $ 1,500 fine imposed on the City violated Kentucky's constitutional prohibition 
of excessive fines.  Id. at 958-59."

1428,10," In 1986 the General Assembly amended the Indiana Antitrust Act's internal references to refer to ""chapters"" rather than ""acts"". 
Pub. Law No. 152-1986, Sec. 12. In 1993 the General Assembly amended the definition of ""person"" to include limited liability 
companies, a then novel form of organization. Pub. Law No. 8-1993, Sec. 335. Neither of these amendments effected any 
substantive change relevant here. "
1430,11," Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 87 L. Ed. 315, 63 S. Ct. 307 (1943), dealt with a complaint for injunctive relief against 
enforcement of a state statute regulating agricultural output. Actions pursuant to a state regulatory scheme were held to be 
exempt from federal antitrust laws as ""state action."" The Supreme Court found ""nothing in the language of the Sherman Act or in 
its history which suggests that its purpose was to restrain a state or its officers or its agents from activities directed by its 
legislature.""  Id. at 350. As a result of this holding, ""state action"" was expressly declared to be a defense for a wide variety of 
acts by governmental regulators and private citizens if done pursuant to state law, even if they might otherwise have violated 
federal antitrust laws."
1430,12," It has been noted that the statutory immunity of the nonsovereign ""local governments"" exceeds the nonstatutory immunity of 
the sovereigns that created them. ABA Antitrust Section: Monograph No. 15, Antitrust Federalism: The Role of State Law at 72 
n. 508 (1988). ""The immunity from damages granted to local governments under the Act is absolute. The Act, however, does not 
immunize local governments from injunctive,"" enforcement procedures by the Department of Justice, or actions by the Federal 
Trade Commission. Id. at 72. "
1431,13," See  Neyens v. Roth, 326 N.W.2d 294, 298 (Iowa 1982);  Byre v. City of Chamberlain, 362 N.W.2d 69, 74 (S.D. 1985). Those 
jurisdictions afford immunity only if the municipal action is ""clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy."" "
1436,1," The Court finds somewhat perplexing the comments made by Bellboy's counsel at oral argument on this matter. Specifically, 
counsel stated that Bellboy could have pleaded a Robinson-Patman Act claim ""from day one,"" but that it did not because of 
strategic reasons. (Feb. 18, 2005, Hrg. Tr. at 32.) This statement, along with Bellboy's counsel's quick suggestion that yet 
another amended complaint would resolve any pleading deficiencies, leads the Court to inquire whether Bellboy has engaged in 
a fishing expedition of sorts. "
1441,1," The Complaint named the three Forest Service employees as defendants. However, the United States subsequently certified 
itself as the defendant in place of these individuals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2679(d)(1). "
1443,2," The most basic formulation of the ""sham"" exception is when a defendant abuses a governmental process with neither the 
desire nor expectation of achieving a governmental result from that process. Id. However, Plaintiff concedes that Steers actually 
sought, and indeed achieved, a governmental result -- specifically, new environmental studies and ""non-renewal"" of the Clean 
Water Act § 404 permit. Compl. P 42,44. Thus this most basic formulation of the ""sham exception is not at issue in this case."
1443,3," The requirement that a civil RICO plaintiff have been injured in his ""business or property"" is an important limitation."" RICO was 
intended to combat organized crime, not to provide a federal cause of action and treble damages to every tort plaintiff. Requiring 
that a plaintiff demonstrate a financial loss to her business or property is consistent with that purpose. It is also consistent with 
what the Supreme Court has termed the restrictive significance' of the phrase injured in his business or property.'"" Oscar v. 
University Students Co-Operative Ass'n, 965 F.2d 783, 786 (quoting Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 339, 99 S. Ct.

1450,1," The District of Columbia and five U.S. territories are also parties to the MSA. See Compl. Ex. A, Master Settlement Agreement

205 (2d Cir. 2004), reh'g denied, 363 F.3d 149 (Mar. 25, 2004), the Second Circuit reversed the district court's dismissal of an 
action brought against New York state officials challenging MSA-related legislation, finding that state action immunity doctrine 
did not immunize the legislation from preemption by the Sherman Act. On remand, the district court denied plaintiffs' motion for a 
preliminary injunction with regard to the MSA, New York's ""escrow statute,"" and the Contraband statute. See Freedom Holdings, 
Inc. v. Spitzer, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18296 at *101 (Sept. 14, 2004)."
1451,3," The MSA defines ""market share"" as a manufacturer's ""respective share (expressed as a percentage) of the total number of 
individual Cigarettes sold in the fifty United States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico during the applicable calendar year."" 
MSA § II(z). "
1452,4," Defendant Lockyer refers to the ""Qualifying Act"" as the ""reserve fund statute."" Under the MSA, a Qualifying Act is one that is 
substantively identical to the Model Statute set forth in the agreement. MSA Ex. T. He refers to the ""Contraband Amendment"" as 
""California's complementary legislation.'"" Def. Lockyer's Mot. at 8:18-19. The Court uses the language of the complaint and thus 
refers to these statutes as the Qualifying Act and Contraband Amendment."
1452,5," California's Qualifying Act is Cal. Health & Safety Code § 104557. The Contraband Amendment is Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 
22979."
1452,6," Plaintiff and defendant Lockyer have filed Requests for Judicial Notice (""RJN""). Defendants object to plaintiff's RJN on grounds 
of relevance. The Court finds that the materials submitted by plaintiff are relevant, and hereby GRANTS both parties' requests. "
1454,7," Plaintiff also argues that Midcal analysis is appropriate because the MSA is a ""hybrid restraint."" The Court considers this 
argument in Part II, below. "
1455,8," In addition, the Court declines to follow the Third Circuit's pronouncements on this issue, which are equivocal at best. In A.D. 
Bedell Wholesale Co. v. Philip Morris, 263 F.3d 239 (3d Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1081, 151 L. Ed. 2d 697, 122 S. Ct. 
813 (2002), the Third Circuit affirmed the dismissal of claims brought against cigarette manufacturers on the basis of the Noerr-
Pennington doctrine. The Bedell court also applied Midcal analysis and concluded that the manufacturers were not entitled to 
Parker immunity. 263 F.3d at 254. Although the Bedell court did not reach the question of ""whether the acts of executive officials 
constitute state action that avoids Midcal analysis,"" 263 F.3d at 256, the Third Circuit later addressed this issue in Mariana v. 
Fisher, 338 F.3d 189 (3d Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1179, 158 L. Ed. 2d 80, 124 S. Ct. 1413 (2004). It considered itself 
""bound by Bedell to abstain from reaching a different conclusion on Parker immunity,"" and by Bedell's statement that ""because 
private participants in state action enjoy Parker immunity only to the extent the States enjoy immunity, the defendants are not 
shielded by Parker."" It observed: ""[p]erhaps unintentionally, because the issue was not before it, by this sentence Bedell seems 
to have assumed, if not decided, that the States have no Parker immunity,"" and noted that ""[c]ritics may with some justification 
regard our discussion of Parker immunity as dictum, and well it may be."" 338 F.3d at 203-04. "
1457,9," While Freedom Holdings holds that Noerr-Pennington does not apply, it involved only a suit against New York state officials, 
not tobacco manufacturers, and a challenge to the MSA enabling statutes, not the MSA itself. Thus, it is not relevant to the 
manufacturers' motion. "

1481,14," Further, as to the divergence between Mylan's prices and Plaintiffs' reimbursement costs alter the rescission of the exclusive 
agreements there is a genuine dispute as to the closeness of the correlation between those two figures. Plaintiffs' and 
Defendants' experts disagree as to the degree of divergence between the drop in Mylan's prices after the agreements were

1484,1," West never explains what it means by ""industry standards"" in this context. "
1485,2," In addition to these deficiencies, BASF further argues that West has failed to adequately allege facts to support the 
""conspiracy"" and ""relevant product"" elements of a § 1 Sherman Act claim. Though the Court similarly finds merit in BASF's 
arguments as to those deficiencies, analysis on those points would be superfluous given the Court's findings that follow. "
1486,3," Although this Court recognizes that the determination of the relevant market largely depends on a factual analysis, see 
Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Services, Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 482, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1992), if the

1500,1," As described at length in the LePage's litigation, 3M's bundled rebate programs provided purchasers with significant discounts 
on 3M's products. However, the availability and size of the rebates were dependant upon purchasers buying products from 3M 
from multiple product lines. See LePage's II, 324 F.3d at 154-55."
1500,2," On August 18, 2004, the Court certified as a class ""all persons who directly purchased invisible or transparent tape from 3M 
between October 2, 1998 and the present, who have not purchased, for resale under the class member's own label, any 'private 
label' invisible or transparent tape from 3M or any of 3M's competitors at any time from October 2, 1988 to the present."" (August 
18, 2004 Memorandum and Order.) "
1501,3," In its Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, Bradburn moved the Court for collateral estoppel as to 41 proposed 'findings.' 
(See Doc. No. 80). However, the Court understands that Bradburn has consolidated these 41 findings into five factual 
determinations in its Reply in Support of Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. (See Pl's Prop. Order, attached to Doc. No. 96; 
see also Tr. 11/05/2003 at 80.) Accordingly, the Court confines its analysis to the five issues enumerated above. "
1502,4," The Court further notes that Bradburn seeks partial summary judgment as to liability only for the time period from June 11, 
1993 through October 13, 1999, rather than for the entire period of time at issue in this litigation. However, HN8[
] ""the Federal 
Rules of Civil Procedure do not provide for partial summary judgment of a portion of a single claim."" Connelly v. Wolf, Block, 
Schorr and Solis-Cohen, 463 F. Supp. 914, 919 (E.D. Pa. 1978) (citing Coffman v. Fed. Labs., Inc., 171 F.2d 94 (3d Cir. 1948)). "
1503,5," Throughout this opinion the Court will use the phrase ""issue preclusion"" and ""collateral estoppel"" interchangeably. See 
Witkowski v. Welch, 173 F.3d 192, 198 (3d Cir. 1999) (noting that the doctrine of collateral estoppel is now commonly referred to 
as issue preclusion)."
1503,6," For the sake of simplicity, the Court will refer to the doctrine of offensive non-mutual collateral estoppel as ""collateral estoppel"" 
and ""offensive collateral estoppel"" when addressing the legal rule which governs the preclusive effect of a prior judgment in this 
case. See Raytech Corp. v. White, 54 F.3d 187, 190 n.5 (3d Cir. 1995). "
1504,7," Indeed, HN15[
] it is axiomatic that collateral estoppel cannot apply to the jury's factual determinations in LePage's for a time period that was not at issue in that trial. The jury's findings in LePage's necessarily were based upon the evidence adduced at 
trial, ""from which they cannot be severed without mutilating their significance."" Int'l Shoe Mach. Corp. v. United Shoe Machinery 
Corp., 315 F.2d 449, 456 (1st Cir. 1963). At the same time, however, the issues litigated in LePage's are not factually different 
from the issues in the instant litigation merely because the damages period here extends beyond the period which the jury 
considered in LePage's. See, e.g., Oberweis, 553 F. Supp. at 966 (collateral estoppel in antitrust action proper for time period at 
issue in prior proceeding even though later litigation alleged longer period of damages). "
1505,8," HN16[
] In antitrust actions, the relevant market is comprised of both a geographic and a product market. Fresh Made, Inc. v. Lifeway Foods, Inc., 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15098, No. Civ. A. 01-4254, 2002 WL 31246922, at *5 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 9, 2002) (citing 
Tunis Bros. Co. v. Ford Motor Co., 952 F.2d 715, 722-26 (3d Cir. 1992)). "
1506,9," The fact that plaintiff in LePage's had introduced substantial evidence regarding the product market at trial implicates the 
precise concerns underlying the doctrine of collateral estoppel (e.g., judicial economy and waste of private resources). 
Moreover, the introduction of evidence on the issue of product market in LePage's permitted the jury to independently determine 
that the product market was, in fact, the market for invisible and transparent tape for home and office use stipulated to by the 
parties. "
1507,10," In LePage's, the Court instructed the jury as follows: Monopoly power is defined as the power to control prices or exclude competition in a relevant market. Therefore, you must 
determine whether 3M could either control prices or exclude competition in the relevant market. The power to control prices 
is the power of a company to establish appreciably higher prices for its equivalent goods, without a substantial loss of 
business to its competitor . . . . The power to exclude competition means the power of a company to dominate a market by 
eliminating existing competition from that market, or by preventing new competition from entering that market. LePage's Trial Tr. Vol. 34, pp. 132-33. "
1508,11," The Court notes that the power to control prices, by contrast, does not necessarily include the power to exclude competition. 
See Shoppin' Bag of Pueblo, Inc. v. Dillon Cos., 783 F.2d 159, 164 (10th Cir. 1986) (""It is conceivable that if a company has 
obtained control over prices . . . it still may not have the power to exclude other competitors from the market.""). "
1510,12," The Court notes that the only cases 3M has cited in which courts have denied the use of collateral estoppel for failure to 
significantly expedite the trial are personal injury class actions for negligence or product liability. In such actions, the jury must 
either evaluate the incident underlying each individual injury, or assess the likelihood that the incident at issue caused each 
particular set of symptoms in order to find causation and injury. See, e.g., Coburn v. Smithkline Beecham Corp., 174 F. Supp. 2d 
1235, 1239-41 (D. Utah 2001) (denying application of collateral estoppel in product liability action because causation in such 
cases can only be established by proof of specific causation, which includes inquiry into dose of drug, duration, frequency and 
amount of exposure, and the effect of other agents and biochemical and metabolic interactions and processes, preexisting 
medical conditions, and environmental factors); see also Schneider a/k/a Nguyen Phi Khanh v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp., 212 
U.S. App. D.C. 87, 658 F.2d 835, 852 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (denying collateral estoppel in action for product design defect); Rogers v. 
Ford Motor Co., 925 F. Supp. 1413, 1419 (N.D. Ind. 1996) (denying collateral estoppel in personal injury action for negligence). 
As discussed above, however, proof of causation and injury in antitrust actions is much less complicated once antitrust violations 
have been established. "
1520,1," In this opinion, GM, DCX and Ford are collectively referred to as the ""OEMs."""
1520,2," In issuing this opinion, the court has considered properly supported facts and disregarded facts that are irrelevant, are 
disguised argument, or are otherwise not properly before the court. Accordingly, both CP's motion to strike ""SUF Charts"" and 
defendants' motion to strike CP's additional statement of facts are denied. "
1523,3," HN10[
] Under the classic formulation of the rule of reason, the ""test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as 
merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition."" 
Board of Trade v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 238, 62 L. Ed. 683, 38 S. Ct. 242 (1918). Application of the typical full rule of 
reason inquiry typically involves an intensive and wide-ranging factual investigation. "
1524,4," CP has produced evidence in the form of expert testimony that the APL market exists, and that OEC was intended to enter it. 
This evidence (and related evidence) is disputed by the OEMs, but construing the facts in favor of CP, the question of the 
applicability of the APL market survives to be aired before a jury. Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Tech. Servs., 504 U.S. 451, 482, 
119 L. Ed. 2d 265, 112 S. Ct. 2072 (1992) (noting that HN15[
] applicable market definition ""can be determined only after a 
factual inquiry into the commercial realities' faced by consumers."") "
1525,5," NCAA, 468 U.S. at 89 n.39 (""The essential point is that the rule of reason can sometimes be applied in the twinkling of an 
eye."") (quoting P. AREEDA, The ""Rule of Reason,"" in ANTITRUST ANALYSIS: GENERAL ISSUES 37-38 (Federal Judicial 
Center, June 1981) (parenthetical omitted in original))."
1525,6," CP has filed a motion to strike all evidence and arguments relating to settlement negotiations, which CP alleges DCX has 
referred to in its motion for summary judgment and statement of undisputed facts in violation of Fed. R. Evid. 408. In reviewing 
DCX's documents, the court has taken into account all properly admissible materials, and disregarded those that are 
inadmissible. Accordingly, CP's motion to strike all evidence relating to settlement negotiations with DCX is denied without 
prejudice. "
1526,7," The OEMs also attempt to make what is essentially a 12(b)(6) argument that CP has failed to plead its ICFA claim with the 
requisite particularity. A defendant's 12(b)(6) motions must be made before responsive pleading under Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 12(b), 
and that time is long past. Thus the court considers this aspect of defendants' argument to have been waived. "
1532,1," The facts in this opinion are all taken from Plaintiff's Complaint, as is appropriate on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a 
claim. They are provided as background to this memorandum and they do not represent a conclusive determination of fact on 
any issue in this litigation."
1532,2," Based on Plaintiff's complaint it appears that BP and Lakeside were of one mind when dealing with Plaintiff. They were both 
present at each meeting, where they presented a united front to Plaintiff. "
1533,3," This Court cannot decide at this time whether any other BP stations did exist in the area: Plaintiff does allege so in his 
complaint, but he also alleges that he was to have been the pioneer BP station. It is possible that as the events in this case were 
unfolding, other BP stations sprung up in Plaintiff's market. "
1535,4," In his response to Defendants' motions, Plaintiff attempts to expand the group harmed to existing BP station operators in a 
surrounding nine-county area. Regardless of the size of the group in this case, Plaintiff does not state a valid claim under the 
Sherman Act. Increasing the size of the group does not overcome the fact that he appears to have picked the wrong group-- BP 
operators-- as his relevant market. In addition, inclusion of more operators does not remedy Plaintiff's failure to allege that 
Defendants' conduct had an adverse impact on competition. "
1536,5," When this Court orally denied Defendants' motions as to the first three counts of the complaint, it had not yet determined that 
Plaintiff failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted in federal court. Now, it is apparent that the only remaining 
claims in this case are state law claims. At this juncture, retaining jurisdiction over those claims is not necessary. "
1542,1, The complaint does not include a Count IV.
1542,2, This count is unnumbered in the complaint. 
1551,1," Plaintiffs also moved to strike Defendants' reply for being in violation of Local Rule 7.1 (c) and this Court's order of November 8, 
2004 (Docket # 153). Defendants opposed Plaintiffs' request (Docket # 164). The Court will not strike Defendants' reply which is 
ten pages in length (Docket # 136). However, the Court will strike Defendants' supplemental reply which is forty-seven pages 
long (Docket # 136 - Attachment # 1). Defendants also moved to strike several declarations under perjury and expert reports 
submitted by Plaintiffs (Dockets ## 137, 138 & 145). Because our ruling on these motions does not alter our disposition of the 
case, we will DENY Defendants' various motions to strike. However, this does not mean that these documents will automatically 
be given the weight that Plaintiffs intended. There are some defects in these documents that are worth noting. First, ""an expert's 
opinion that lacks any credible support does not create an issue of fact."" Am. Key Corp. v. Cole Nat'l Corp., 762 F. 2d 1569, 
1580 (11th Cir. 1985)(citing Merit Motors. Inc. v. Chrysler Corp., 187 U.S. App. D.C. 11, 569 F.2d 666, 673 n. 27 (D.C. Cir. 
1977)). Moreover, with respect to Mr. Mukamal's statement under penalty of perjury, we note that ""construction of a relevant 
economic market or a showing of monopoly power in that market cannot, however, be based upon lay opinion testimony."" Id. 
(citing Forro Precision, Inc. v. Internat'l Bus. Machs. Corp., 673 F.2d 1045,1059 (9th Cir. 1982)). Therefore, to the extent that Mr. 
Mukamal's contentions are based on his lay opinion, they are insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact precluding the 
entry of summary judgment. Finally, Mr. Mukamal's second declaration, which is signed, is subscribed to as ""Joseph J. 
Maximal."" Furthermore, Appendixes I and II to Plaintiffs' expert's reply report (Docket # 153) are in Spanish. Therefore, the Court 
cannot consider them. Local Rule 10(b). In addition, the Court notes that, contrary to Plaintiffs' assertion, the expert's report was 
never amended to include her signature, or, at least, the Court has not been able to locate said alleged correction within 
Plaintiffs' submitted compiled exhibits."
1551,2, Plaintiff also sues his wife and their conjugal partnership.
1551,3, Plaintiff also sues his wife and their conjugal partnership.
1551,4," El Amal, however, does not appear listed as defendant in this last complaint. Instead, Plaintiffs refer to PMC and YMAS 
collectively as El Amal or El Amal Group because that is how the entity has been identified to the Puerto Rico Department of "
1552,," State (Docket # 79, P 10). Per the information provided by Defendants, PMC owns a chain of pharmacies known as El Amal and 
Mr. Saleh Yassin is its Chief Executive Officer (Docket # 108 n. 4)."
1552,5," Joseph J. Mukamal is the sole shareholder of both RPM and PRPI (Docket # 79, PP4-5). "
1553,6, Formerly codified at Local Rule 311.12. 
1554,7," Defendants also filed a motion to dismiss (Docket # 105), which Plaintiffs opposed (Docket # 114). Given the fact that the 
parties have already engaged in discovery and that Plaintiffs sought to convert the motion to dismiss to one for summary 
judgment, we only consider in this Opinion Defendants' motion for summary judgement. Furthermore, since we are granting said 
motion, Defendants' motion to dismiss (Docket # 105) and all related pending motions (Dockets ## 113 & 153A) are hereby 
deemed as MOOT. In addition, Plaintiffs' motion to compel discovery (Docket # 90), to change the discovery schedule (Docket # 
91), and Plaintiffs' motion submitting sworn statement in support of both motions (Docket # 125), as well as Defendants' motion 
to strike the reply to its opposition (Docket # 100) and Defendants' motion to strike the motion submitting sworn statement 
(Docket # 128) and its opposition (Docket # 133) are also deemed as MOOT. We note that the discovery requested in Plaintiffs' 
motion to compel, to wit, financial data for El Amal, even if granted, would not affect our decision as set forth in this Opinion."
1554,8," Defendants reject the existence of an exclusive dealing agreement. To that effect, they have submitted the lease agreement 
circumscribed by PMC (El Amal) and Five Development. (Docket # 109, Exhibit 11). Upon review, we find that there is no 
exclusivity clause regarding the operation of a single pharmacy at the Villa Fontana Shopping Center. Instead, the agreement 
precludes PMC from opening additional El Amal pharmacies within a one mile radius from the mall. Moreover, the agreement 
states that ""all of the agreements made are written in this contract, that no other additional agreements exist, and that any 
changes should be realized in writing and signed by both parties."" Nonetheless, we do not reach the ultimate conclusion 
proposed by Plaintiffs nor do we find that we need to. "
1555,9," At this point, we have to address Plaintiffs' contention that it is for the jury to determine what area comprises the relevant 
geographic market in any particular case. Having reviewed the relevant precedents, we differ from Plaintiffs' understanding. For 
example, in Double D Spotting Serv. v. Supervalu, Inc., 136 F.3d 554 (8th Cir. 1998), the Eight Circuit affirmed the district court's 
grant of the defendants' motion to dismiss, finding that, as a matter of law, the plaintiffs' alleged geographic market was too 
narrow to support an antitrust claim. Noticeably, in said case, the plaintiffs averred that the relevant geographic market was the 
Supervalu warehouse in Urbandale, Iowa. The plaintiffs in Double D Spotting Service, Inc. challenged a contract between the 
owner of one particular warehouse within the Des Moines metropolitan area and one unloading service provider. The contract 
gave the unloading service provider all of the unloading services at that particular warehouse. The Eighth Circuit found that ""the 
market for unloading services would seem to be more properly defined as including all warehouses within, at least, the entire 
Des Moines, Iowa, metropolitan area, if not an even larger area."" Id. at 560-61."
1555,10," Ironically, Plaintiffs' expert also concluded that the Department of Health's criteria of a one mile radius was too narrow to 
analyze real competition in the market (Docket # ]53, Exhibit 4, pp. 199-200). "
1557,11, The P.R. Department of Health's studies are limited to a one mile radius.
1557,12," The First Circuit also pointed out that the plaintiff would not be able to provide her services at a neighboring municipality since 
the doctors she serviced did not have any privileges there."
1557,13," Perhaps if Plaintiffs wanted to track the First Circuit's case and insist on the importance of parking spaces, they should have 
alleged a wider market, such as all the shopping centers in Carolina, if applicable."
1557,14," Plaintiffs limited their search for new venues to a 500 meters radius in order to avoid having to obtain a new CNC (Docket # 
118, SUF # 30). Per Defendants' statement of uncontested facts, there are nine (9) shopping strip malls in addition to other 
commercial leaseable space in the area between 65th Infantry Ave., Sanchez Osorio Ave. and Monserrate Ave. in Carolina, 
approximately one mile radius from the Villa Fontana Shopping Mall (Docket # 109, SUF # 5). Plaintiffs have countered asserting 
that of those nine (9) centers, two have El Amal pharmacies (Docket # 118,PP3-4). However, this does not mean that Plaintiffs 
are foreclosed from obtaining a location, as evidenced by the fact that Plaintiffs have moved to a new location which contains 
five (5) parking spaces (Docket # 118, Exhibit 3, p. 5). "
1558,15," See, e.g., Deauville Corp. v. Federated Dep't Stores. Inc., 756 F.2d 1183 (5th Cir. 1985)(finding that the plaintiff had failed to 
show that the exclusive lease agreement with the anchor tenant adversely affected competition since it failed to show that 
competition from alternative mall sites was precluded); Child World. Inc. v. S. Towne Ctr., Ltd, 634 F. Supp. 1121 (S.D. Ohio 
1986)(upholding restrictive covenant in shopping center); Optivision, Inc. v. Syracuse Shopping Ctr. Assocs., 472 F. Supp. 665 
(N.D.N.Y. 1979)(""The availability of such market alternatives is an important factor that supports a determination that the 
exclusivity clause here does not unreasonably restrain competition.""); Goodman v. Acme Markets, Inc., 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
4260, 1989 WL 42484 (E.D. Pa. 1989)(""A restrictive covenant which excludes the sale of grocery items within one-half mile of 
the Acme does not substantially affect the market for grocery items."")."
1558,16," El Amal leases at Villa Fontana Shopping Center over five times the amount of space which RPM leased (Docket # 118, SUF 
# 37). "
1571,1," Barr and Rugby are in the business of, inter alia, manufacturing and marketing generic drugs. Rugby was the U.S. generic drug 
subsidiary of HMR until February 1998, when Rugby was acquired by Watson, a company that produces and distributes generic 
and brand-name drugs. Watson is not a signatory to any of the allegedly unlawful agreements."
1571,2," The generic defendants, together with Bayer, will be referred to as the ""defendants,"" while direct plaintiffs and indirect plaintiffs 
will be referred to as ""plaintiffs."""
1571,3," In Walker Process Equipment, Inc. v. Food Machinery & Chem. Corp., 382 U.S. 172, 177, 86 S.Ct. 347, 15 L.Ed.2d 247 (1965), 
the Supreme Court first recognized an antitrust cause of action based on assertion of a patent known to have been obtained by 
fraud on the United States Patent and Trademark Office (""PTO""), provided that the other elements of a Sherman Act claim are 
present. Such claims are commonly referred to as Walker Process claims. Because indirect plaintiffs are asserting their claims "
1572,," under state law and because they have pointed to no state law explicitly recognizing an antitrust claim for assertion of a patent 
obtained by fraud, their claim is referred to as a Walker Process-type claim."
1572,4," Under Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 97 S.Ct. 2061, 52 L.Ed.2d 707 (1977), indirect purchasers are barred from 
recovering damages for monopolistic overcharges under federal antitrust law."
1572,5," A continuation-in-part application is an application that claims priority to and includes the subject matter of at least part of an 
earlier-filed application. "
1574,6," In briefing these motions, the parties have sometimes referred to these payments as ""reverse"" payments. Adoption herein of 
the ""exclusion payments"" nomenclature is made for ease of reference, and in recognition that the payments, whatever they are 
called, are made in exchange for a competitor's exit or exclusion from the relevant market."
1574,7," HN3[
] Summary judgment is appropriate only in those cases where there is no genuine issue of material fact. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). Here, Bayer, generic defendants and direct plaintiffs 
have each filed motions for summary judgment on the issue of whether the Bayer/Barr settlement agreements had an anti-
competitive effect. HN4[
] The burden of proving anti-competitive effects lies with the plaintiffs in the first instance, and, as 
discussed infra, plaintiffs have shown no anti-competitive effects beyond the scope of the '444 Patent. The analysis with respect 
to those anti-competitive effects that are within the scope of the '444 Patent (and which all parties agree were present) 
constitutes a pure discussion of law without regard to burdens of proof."
1574,8," A recent decision by the Eleventh Circuit questions the appropriateness of the per se versus rule of reason approach for claims 
of antitrust violations involving patents. See Schering-Plough v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 402 F.3d 1056, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 
3811, 2005 WL 528439, at *7 (11th Cir. Mar. 8, 2005),    . The Eleventh Circuit's opinion can fairly be read as breaking the first 
step of a rule of reason analysis - assessing the actual adverse effects on competition - into three steps to determine whether 
there are any anti-competitive effects that exceed the scope of the patent. Regardless of whether the Eleventh Circuit intended 
to jettison the rule of reason analysis in the patent context or simply refine the analysis, the case at bar will be considered under 
this court's prior opinion adopting the rule of reason mode of analysis. See Cipro II, 261 F. Supp. 2d at 256-57. It would be 
inappropriate not to address the issue accordingly, not least because the parties have briefed the issue in light of that analysis. 
In any event, the same result would be reached under either analytical approach. "
1576,9," Bayer admitted at oral argument that its estimated costs of production did not change after the exclusivity period, but contends 
that its marketing costs were projected to drop sharply after generic entry. It is understandable that Bayer would choose to 
spend less to promote Cipro at a time when its marketing efforts would not redound exclusively to its own benefit, but a drop in 
such discretionary spending only further illustrates the degree to which Bayer controlled its own profit margin. "
1579,10," Neither the Eleventh Circuit nor Judge Posner furnished any examples of or provide further guidance regarding patents that 
were so blatantly invalid."
1579,11," It happens that Judge Posner did in fact decide the validity of the patent in a related patent infringement case that was decided 
prior to Asahi Glass. See Asahi Glass, 289 F. Supp. 2d at 992. In that case he found the patent to be valid. Id. "
1580,12," The ruling was recently set aside and vacated by the Eleventh Circuit on other grounds (i.e., not on the issue of the propriety 
of post hoc evaluations of a patent's validity). "
1581,13," Plaintiffs here have raised a similar argument, suggesting that Barr's attorneys had developed a particularly strong attack on 
the '444 Patent that no subsequent challenger was capable of replicating. Indir. Pls.' Mem. of Law in Opp'n to Bayer's Mot. for 
Partial Summ. J. on Count V (""Indir. Pls.' Count V Opp'n""), at 2-4; Indir. Pls.' Mem. of Law in Opp'n to Generic Defs.' Mot. for 
Summ. J. and Bayer's Mot. for Partial Summ. J. on Pls.' Claims Under the Sherman Act and Corresponding State Law Claims 
(""Indir. Pls.' Sherman Opp'n""), at 13. Barr's patent counsel are undoubtedly fine attorneys, but it strains credulity to maintain that 
only one competitor's well-funded legal team could construct such a compelling case against the patent."
1581,14," Indeed, there is something anomalous about the notion that plaintiffs could collect treble damages for settlement of a litigation 
involving a patent that has been subsequently upheld by the Federal Circuit. Even the FTC's decision in Schering-Plough 
outlawing exclusion payments provided for prospective relief only. Schering-Plough I, 2003 WL 22989651, at *43. "
1582,15," Indirect plaintiffs have added Count V to their complaint, alleging a state law Walker-Process-type claim, namely that Bayer 
obtained the '444 Patent through fraud and that its suit against Barr was a sham litigation. These allegations are discussed more 
fully in connection with Bayer's motion to dismiss, see infra Part 3. "
1584,16," In fact, once the $ 398 million is converted to the then-net present value, the corresponding perceived risk of losing is even 
lower."
1584,17," As their expert candidly admits, ""the formulae underlying these calculations are complex."" Dir. Pls.' Summ. J. App., Tab 33 
(Expert Rep. of Keith B. Leffler, Ph.D., at 34 n.85)."
1584,18," This absolute numbers ""expectation"" model is interesting, particularly in that it happens to line up with the graph on Bayer's 
presentation slide, but there is no reason to rely upon it for an analysis of the legality of Bayer's payment to Barr. Moreover, this 
model may be overly simplistic, in that it does not account for other factors underlying the parties' negotiations, such as the 
possibility that subsequent challengers might enter the market for generic Cipro. In addition, both the indirect plaintiffs and the 
generic defendants asserted at oral argument that such a model should not be used in assessing the legality of the payment in 
this case. Indirect plaintiffs argue that a better measure of Bayer's perceived chances of winning the litigation against Barr could 
be extrapolated from a comparison of the actual payment to Barr's anticipated profit had it won the litigation. Generic 
defendants, on the other hand, accept that the expectation model could be used to approximate Bayer's perceived chances of "
1585,," success, but assert that the legality of the payment depends not on Bayer's subjective perception of its chances, but rather only 
on whether the patent litigation was a sham."
1585,19," A similar argument could be constructed for situations, unlike the one here, where infringement is the dominant issue in the 
underlying patent litigation. If the scope of the claims is in dispute, but arguably narrow enough that not every bioequivalent 
generic drug would infringe the patent, it could be expected that additional generic challengers would be spurred to design 
around the patent and file their own ANDA IVs based on non-infringement."
1585,20," Barr filed its ANDA IV on the first day it was permitted to do so under 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(D)(ii). See Cipro II, 261 F. Supp. 2d 
at 194. There was no legal bar to other generics filing ANDA IVs that same day or any day thereafter, although pragmatic and 
economic considerations may have influenced their decision to wait at least until Barr's challenge had concluded before 
launching their own attacks on the '444 Patent. This is because if Barr were successful, the marketing approval for other 
generics would be withheld until Barr's 180-day exclusivity period expired. "
1586,21," Candor requires that I recognize that this conclusion is, to some extent, inconsistent with the view expressed in Cipro I 
regarding the motions to remand, where the opinion stated: A review of [plaintiffs'] allegations makes plain that plaintiffs have asserted at least one theory by which they may establish 
state antitrust violations without resorting to a determination of patent law. Plaintiffs' complaints allege there would have 
been generic competition in the market for ciprofloxacin prior to the expiration of Bayer's patent if Bayer had not reached an 
unreasonably anti-competitive agreement with Barr, HMR, and Rugby . . . [Plaintiffs] asserted that, as a matter of fact, 
Bayer would have authorized Barr to distribute ciprofloxacin by granting Barr a license, or by other means, had Barr not 
agreed to drop its challenge to the validity of the '444 patent in exchange for large cash payments. Cipro I at 748. Upon further reflection, I have concluded that patent law imposes no such restriction against cash payments by a patent holder, 
and, accordingly, antitrust law does not impose such a restriction. "
1587,22," Indirect plaintiffs also allege in their pleadings that Bayer maintained an exceptional profit margin for Cipro: ""Bayer's 1999 
United States gross sales of Cipro were approximately $ 1.04 billion and its net sales (or profits) were in excess of $ 920 million."" 
Indir. Pls.' Second Am. Consol. Class Action Compl. P70. "
1589,23," Of course, as previously discussed, such an inquiry would hardly redound to plaintiffs' benefit, given that the '444 Patent has 
already been upheld by the Federal Circuit once, that three other attacks have failed and that only a speculative attack is 
proposed by the plaintiffs here. See supra Part 1(b)(i)."
1589,24," At least two commentators have suggested that, ""for purposes of antitrust analysis, there are and can be no 'wrong' decisions 
reached by courts in patent litigation . . . [because] the substantive rights granted by Congress to patent holders are those rights 
. . . which a federal court determines, through congressionally prescribed process, that the patent holder possesses. Because 
there are no 'wrong' results generated by the patent litigation process, the patent holder improperly enlarges the innovation 
reward granted to him by Congress when he buys 'insurance' -- in the form of exclusion of a competitor -- against a 'wrong' result 
in the patent litigation."" Keith B. Leffler and Cristofer I. Leffler, Want to Pay a Competitor to Exit the Market? Settle a Patent 
Infringement Case, 2 ABA Economics Committee Newsletter 26 (Spring 2002). The fallacy of this argument is that it leads to the 
inevitable conclusion that it is always improper for a patentee to insure against an unfavorable result by paying for a competitor's 
exclusion. All hedging by patentees -- that is, all patent settlements -- are now suspect. "
1590,25," The subsection reads (V) HN19[
] Agreement with another applicant, the listed drug application holder, or a patent owner The first applicant [forfeits its 180-day exclusivity period if it] enters into an agreement with another applicant under this 
subsection for the drug, the holder of the application for the listed drug, or an owner of the patent that is the subject of the 
certification under paragraph (2)(A)(vii)(IV), the Federal Trade Commission or the Attorney General files a complaint, and 
there is a final decision of the Federal Trade Commission or the court with regard to the complaint from which no appeal 
(other than a petition to the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari) has been or can be taken that the agreement has violated 
the antitrust laws (as defined insection 12 of Title 15, except that the term includes section 45 of Title 15 to the extent that 
that section applies to unfair methods of competition). "
1591,26," Although the fact that a state law cause of action may only be heard in federal court does not necessarily mean that it is 
preempted by federal law, see Hunter Douglas, Inc. v. Harmonic Design, Inc., 153 F.3d 1318, 1334 (Fed. Cir. 1998), overruled 
on other grounds by Midwest Indus., Inc. v. Karavan Trailers, Inc., 175 F.3d 1356, 1358-59 (Fed. Cir. 1999), the inquiries are 
closely related and in certain circumstances do overlap. "
1593,27," Indirect plaintiffs point to a number of cases in which state law causes of action predicated on bad faith procurement of patents 
have been allowed to go forward. Those cases do not alter the analysis, as none of them addresses preemption of state law 
Walker Process or sham litigation claims. For example, In re Relafen Antitrust Litig., 221 F.R.D. 260 (D. Mass. 2004), deals with 
class certification issues, and makes only passing reference to one allegation that the defendants ""entered the market under the 
banner of a patent procured by fraud."" Id. at 266. The court's analysis was limited to a determination of whether the 
requirements of Rule 23 were met, and it did not consider the merits of the case. Id. at 265. In subsequent opinions, the Relafen 
court clarified that the indirect plaintiffs in that case were pursuing their Walker Process claims as assignees of the rights of 
several national wholesalers (i.e., direct purchasers), and their claims were therefore not barred by Illinois Brick. See In re 
Relafen Antitrust Litig., 346 F. Supp. 2d 349, 368 (D. Mass. 2004); In re Relafen Antitrust Litig., 2005 WL 418086, at *17, *21 (D. 
Mass. Feb. 22, 2005). Significantly, none of the In re Relafen opinions discusses whether state law Walker Process claims are 
preempted. In both Intel Corp. v. Via Techs., Inc., 2001 WL 777085, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 20, 2001) and Bristol-Myers Squibb 
Co. v. Ben Venue Lab., 90 F. Supp. 2d 540, 549 (D.N.J. 2000), district courts allowed state law claims to proceed where the only 
ground on which the parties moved to dismiss was that the state law claims were dependent on the survival of related federal 
antitrust claims, which were not dismissed. Similarly, in FDI, Inc. v. W.R. Grace & Co., Inc., 1980 WL 1996, *3-4 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 
29, 1980), the court refused to grant summary judgment on portions of plaintiff's federal Walker Process antitrust and related 
unfair competition claim based on the same allegations, although preemption is not discussed in the opinion. Thus, although 
indirect plaintiffs have cited several cases in which state law claims based at least in part on misconduct before the PTO have 
been permitted to proceed, they have at least to some extent involved non-PTO conduct. In any event, none of them is binding 
precedent, and none of them cites any reason why such claims are not preempted by federal patent law."
1593,28," Assuming that the mere listing in the Orange Book constituted marketplace misconduct, it is highly unlikely that indirect 
plaintiffs would be able to establish a Walker Process claim. HN25[
] Initially, Walker Process fraud requires a showing that the 
omission or misrepresentation to the Patent Office was so material that the patent would not have issued but for the omission or 
misrepresentation (a level of materiality referred to as ""but for"" materiality); consequently, a patent must be invalid before it can 
be a candidate for Walker Process fraud. See, e.g., C.R. Bard, Inc. v. M3 Sys., Inc., 157 F.3d 1340, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 1998) 
(""Indeed, since the inventorship issue was not grounds of invalidity, it can not satisfy the ""but for"" test of fraud.""); Nobelpharma 
AB v. Implant Innovations, Inc., 141 F.3d 1059, 1070 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (""Such a misrepresentation or omission must evidence a "
1594,," clear intent to deceive the examiner and thereby cause the PTO to grant an invalid patent."") (emphasis added). In contrast, 
because the patent litigation defense of inequitable conduct does not require so high a level of materiality, it is possible for a 
patent to be unenforceable for inequitable conduct, but still valid. See, e.g., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, 
Inc., 326 F.3d 1226, 1237 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (citing PerSeptive Biosystems, Inc. v. Pharmacia Biotech, Inc., 225 F.3d 1315, 1322 
(Fed. Cir. 2000). Indirect plaintiffs' reliance on Unitherm Food Sys., Inc. v. Swift-Eckrich, Inc., 375 F.3d 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2004) for 
the proposition that the materiality requirement for a showing of Walker Process fraud is met by simply pointing to the PTO's 
issuance of a patent is a gross misreading of the law. First, Unitherm did not depart from the standard set forth in Nobelpharma 
for showing ""but for"" materiality, and concluded: ""Had the PTO not relied on this fraud, the Examiner would have reached the 
same conclusion as did the district court and this court . . . that no valid patent could issue from [the] application."" Unitherm, 375 
F.3d at 1361 (emphasis added). Second, if plaintiffs' assertion were correct - that simple issuance of a patent is sufficient to 
prove ""but for"" materiality - then the standard for proving Walker Process fraud materiality would be lower than the showing 
required for inequitable conduct and would, in fact, be met in every case. Such a conclusion is directly contrary to the Federal 
Circuit's holding in Nobelpharma and is not supported by Unitherm. Furthermore, indirect plaintiffs cite eight instances of improper conduct before the PTO. Some have already been rejected by 
Judge Brewster as failing to establish invalidity (see Bayer AG v. Carlsbad Tech., Inc., No. 01-cv-0867-B, slip op. at 6-7 (S.D. 
Cal. June 7, 2002)), some by the PTO during reexamination (Bayer Pat. App. Ex. 9) and others have been conceded as not 
rising to the level of ""but for"" materiality. More importantly, indirect plaintiffs did not adduce evidence of ""but for"" materiality for 
seven of these instances. The only instance for which their expert opined ""but for"" materiality was a claim that Bayer's 
statements regarding the superiority of the ""compounds of the invention"" to the prior art was misleading, because Bayer withheld 
data showing that certain of the claimed compounds were not, in fact, superior to the prior art. HN26[
] Lawyer advocacy or 
puffery is not a basis for granting or denying a patent claim. Superiority is not the issue. What is required instead is a showing of 
novelty and non-obviousness for a patent to issue, 35 U.S.C. §§ 102, 103, and for that the patent examiner is presumed to have 
relied on data, not attorney advocacy. Cf. CFMT, Inc. v. Yieldup Int'l Corp., 349 F.3d 1333, 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (""During 
prosecution, an applicant may submit objective factual evidence to the PTO in the form of patents, technical literature, and 
declarations . . . . The advantages advocacy in this case does not fit any of these categories and was unaccompanied by and 
not asserted to be supported by any factual evidence. Therefore, a reasonable examiner would not have found it important in 
deciding whether to allow the application."") "
1597,1," Plaintiffs seek damages and injunctive relief pursuant to Sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 15, 25. Plaintiffs 
also seek compensatory and exemplary damages for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and 
restitution and injunctive relief for alleged unfair trade practices in violation of Section 17200 of the California Business and 
Professions Code."
1597,2," As this is a motion to dismiss, the facts are taken from the FAC. "
1599,3," The Court's October 20 Order dismissed the antitrust claims set forth in ¶ 23(b)-(f) of the original complaint. Despite this, 
Plaintiffs repeat those claims in ¶ 25(B)(1)-(5) of the FAC. In addition, ¶ 25(B)(2) contains an entirely new allegation pertaining to 
the pricing of DSL aggregation-backhaul circuits. Since the Court's October 20 Order limited Plaintiffs to re-alleging the 
previously dismissed price squeeze claim, Defendants request that the Court strike the new allegation. "
1600,4," In City of Anaheim v. Southern California Edison Co., 955 F.2d 1373, 1378 (9th Cir. 1992), the Ninth Circuit imposed on 
plaintiffs alleging a price squeeze in a fully regulated industry the additional burden of pleading and proving that the defendant 
acted with specific intent. "
1601,5," Although Brooke Group involved a claim of primary-line price discrimination under the Robinson-Patman Act, the Court found 
that ""primary-line competitive injury under the Robinson-Patman is of the same general character as the injury inflicted by 
predatory pricing schemes actionable under § 2 of the Sherman Act."" Id. at 221. "
1602,6," In Covad I, the defendant argued that the plaintiff was required to allege below-cost pricing. Id. at 1290. The defendant cited 
Brooke Group in support of its claim. Id. at 1291 n.17. In response, the plaintiff argued that ""whether or not there is a price 
squeeze should not depend on whether retail prices are 'too low,' but rather on the 'squeeze' created by the disparity between 
the wholesale prices [the plaintiff] must pay [the defendant] upstream and the prices [the plaintiff] must charge downstream to 
remain competitive with [the defendant]."" Id. at 1291."
1602,7," The Court explained that ""the essence of a claim under either statute [i.e., the Robinson-Patman Act and the Sherman Act] is 
the same: A business rival has priced its products in an unfair manner with an object to eliminate or retard competition and 
thereby gain and exercise control over prices in the relevant market."" Brooke Group, 509 U.S. at 222."
1602,8," Plaintiffs argue that the harm inflicted by a price squeeze inheres in the higher costs imposed upon the wholesale monopolist's 
retail competitors, not the lower prices charged at the retail level by the wholesale monopolist. "
1603,9," But see Hasbrouck v. Texaco. Inc., 842 F.2d 1034, 1040 (9th Cir. 1988) (""The oft-quoted chestnut distinguishing between 
protecting competition and protecting competitors has been misconstrued with some regularity by antitrust defendants who 
appear to argue in all types of antitrust cases that the effect of unlawful conduct on competitors is irrelevant. The purpose of 
drawing a distinction between harm to competition and harm to competitors is to point out that not all acts that harm competitors 
harm competition. However, the converse is not true. Injury to competition necessarily entails injury to at least some competitors. 
Competition does not exist in a vacuum; it consists of rivalry among competitors. Clearly, injury to competitors may be probative 
of harm to competition.... The aphorism may not be invoked blindly in response to a showing that competitors have been 
harmed; otherwise it would often serve to shield unlawful conduct that adversely affects competition."")."
1603,10," In this respect, the objective of a price squeeze is no different from that of predatory pricing. Compare William Inglis & Sons 
Baking Co. v. ITT Continental Baking Co., Inc., 668 F.2d 1014, 1031-1032 (9th Cir. 1981) (""'Pricing is predatory only where 
the firm foregoes short-term profits in order to develop a market position such that the firm can later raise prices and recoup lost 
profits....'"") (quoting Janich Bros., Inc. v. Am. Distilling Co., 570 F.2d 848, 856 (9th Cir. 1978)) with Cities of Anaheim. Riverside. 
Banning, Colton & Asuza v. Fed. Energy Regulatory Comm'n, 941 F.2d 1234, 1250, 291 U.S. App. D.C. 317 (D.C. Cir. 1991) 
(""[A] [p]rice squeeze occurs when a firm with monopoly power on the primary, or wholesale, level engages in a prolonged price 
increase that drives competitors out of the secondary, or retail, level, and thereby [*24]  extends its monopoly power to the 
secondary market."") (emphasis added). "
1604,11," It is important to note, however, that Areeda and Hovenkamp warn that a predatory price squeeze which consists in raising the 
wholesale price could be effected in some circumstances with little or no short-run loss of profits. Areeda & Hovenkamp, 
Antitrust Law, ¶ 767c5 at 129."
1604,12," Plaintiffs initially relied on Chroma Lighting v. GTE Products Corp., 111 F.3d 653 (9th Cir. 1997), for this proposition. However, 
while it is true that the court in Chroma Lighting ""decline [d] to extend the reasoning of Brooke Group to secondary-line cases 
because of the significant differences between primary-and secondary-line claims,"" id. at 658, Chroma Lighting involved a claim 
brought under the Robinson-Patman Act. Thus, the holding in Chroma Lighting is technically limited to cases brought under the 
Robinson-Patman Act. Moreover, the court's reasoning in Chroma Lighting does not justify expanding its holding to claims under 
Section 2. The court grounded its decision in the language and legislative history of the Robinson-Patman Act. Id. at 658. Thus, 
a fair reading of Chroma Lighting does not permit the expansive reading urged by Plaintiffs. However, an expansive reading of 
Chroma Lighting is not needed to limit Brooke Group's holding. Brooke Group has already done that. As the First Circuit has 
noted, the holding of Brooke Group ""on its face applies only to primary-line cases, not secondary-line cases."" Coastal Fuels of 
Puerto Rico, Inc, v. Caribbean Petroleum Corp., 79 F.3d 182, 193 (1st Cir. 1996). The Court in Brooke Group specified that the 
two prerequisites applied to ""claims alleging predatory pricing under § 2 of the Sherman Act or primary-line price discrimination 
under the Robinson-Patman Act."" Id. at 222 (emphasis added)."
1604,13," In fact, the court cited numerous other anti-competitive acts by the defendants. Id."
1604,14," In Bonjorno v. Kaiser Aluminum & Chem. Corp., 752 F.2d 802, 808-09 (3d Cir. 1985), the court noted that the evidence 
showed that the price for aluminum pipe was ""for a significant period of time in 1974"" ""just above, or even below"" the price for 
aluminum coil but quickly added that ""[t]he mere existence ... of a 'price squeeze' is not necessarily an antitrust violation. The 
plaintiff must present evidence that the defendants deliberately produced the effect, sufficient to provide a reasonable basis for 
the jury to conclude that the 'squeeze' was not the result of natural market forces such as supply or demand or legitimate 
competition."" "
1605,15, The issue will thus be revisited at summary judgment.
1605,16," Moreover, as Plaintiffs note, the FAC contains price squeeze allegations substantially similar to those approved by the Court in 
Covad II."
1605,17," Instead, they allege only that Plaintiffs cannot make a profit by charging the retail prices Defendants charge."
1605,18," Because the applicability of the Brooke Group requirements to price squeezes had arisen in the first round of briefing, 
Plaintiff's counsel knew that Defendants would move to dismiss the FAC on this basis. "
1607,19," In Covad Communications, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concluded that Trinko barred the plaintiffs' 
price squeeze allegation. Id. at 673-74."
1607,20," In Trinko, the Court first determined whether the plaintiff's claim fell within the existing exceptions to the ""no duty to deal"" rule. 
Trinko, 540 U.S. at 407-11. Only then did the Court examine whether traditional antitrust principles (i.e., the policies underlying 
antitrust law) justified adding the plaintiff's claim to the existing body of cognizable antitrust claims. Id. at 411-15. The Ninth 
Circuit employed precisely this analytical framework in Metronet Services Corp. v. Qwest Corp., 383 F.3d 1124 (2004). First, the 
court discussed whether the plaintiff's claim fell within the existing exceptions to the ""no duty to deal"" rule. Id. at 1130-34. Only 
then did it examine whether it should expand the contours of Section 2 liability in order to accommodate the plaintiff's claim. Id. 
at 1134-37. It was at this point that the court ""weight[ed] the 'benefits of antitrust intervention' against 'a realistic assessment of 
its costs.'"" Id. at 1134. Here, Defendants are conflating these two inquiries, asking the Court to preclude Section 2 liability in a 
fully regulated industry even under existing antitrust law because the costs of such regulation outweigh its benefits. Trinko did 
not announce such a wholesale rethinking of antitrust law."
1607,21," The Court remains convinced that this argument misconstrues Trinko. The first inquiry under Trinko is not whether a particular 
type of antitrust claim is well established but whether the plaintiff states a claim under existing antitrust case law, whether or not 
that particular type of claim is well established. "
1608,22," In light of the Court's holding that the FAC can be read to state a viable price squeeze claim under Brooke Group, the issue 
before the Ninth Circuit will not only be whether Trinko bars price squeeze claims generally but, more specifically, whether it bars 
predatory price squeeze claims (i.e., price squeeze claims which comply with the Brooke Group requirements). "

regulations of (noncommercial) speech are ""presumptively invalid,"" R.A.V., 505 U.S. at 382-83, and the government bears the

advances the asserted interest, and that the regulation is not more extensive than necessary to serve that interest. Lorillard

1646,1," Limited gaming is defined as ""the use of slot machines and the card games of blackjack and poker, each game having a 
maximum single bet of five dollars."" Colo. Const. art. XVIII, § 9(4)(b)."
1646,2," HN1[
] Plaintiffs' claims were dismissed by the district court pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), and this court therefore ""must take as true all well-pleaded allegations in the plaintiff's complaint."" Curtis Ambulance of Fla., Inc. v. Bd. of County 
Comm'rs, 811 F.2d 1371, 1374 (10th Cir. 1987). Accordingly, the factual background in this case will be drawn from plaintiffs' 
second revised third amended complaint, which is the operative pleading here."
1646,3," The Colorado constitution provides: HN3[
] No unincorporated area may be annexed to a municipality unless one of the following conditions first has been 
met: (a) The question of annexation has been submitted to the vote of the landowners and the registered electors in the area 
proposed to be annexed, and the majority of such persons voting on the question have voted for the annexation; or "
1647,," (b) The annexing municipality has received a petition for the annexation of such area signed by persons comprising more 
than fifty percent of the landowners in the area and owning more than fifty percent of the area, excluding public streets, and 
alleys and any land owned by the annexing municipality; or (c) The area is entirely surrounded by or is solely owned by the annexing municipality. Colo. Const. art. II, § 30(1)."
1647,4," Plaintiffs also argue the district court erred in declining to dismiss certain state-law tort claims without prejudice. See infra 
Section IV.E. "
1648,5," The complaint also contains allegations that Black Hawk's Las Vegas-style casinos violate a provision of the Colorado 
constitution requiring limited gaming to be conducted in structures conforming to the architectural styles of the state's historic 
gambling towns. Colo. Const. art. XVIII, § 9(3)(b). Plaintiffs, however, explicitly disavowed reliance on these allegations in the 
district court. Plaintiffs similarly disavowed reliance on allegations that Black Hawk frequently engaged in road construction and 
detours in an effort to deter prospective Central City customers. Although they attempt to revive these allegations on appeal, 
HN7[
] this court will not consider arguments waived or abandoned in the district court. O'Connor v. City & County of Denver,"
1648,894," F.2d 1210, 1214 (10th Cir. 1990). Furthermore, plaintiffs did not argue before the district court and do not argue on appeal that their antitrust claims are supported 
by allegations in the complaint that defendants threatened other unnamed property owners with ""adverse consequences"" if they 
did not assist the effort to defeat the annexation, interfered with city council elections, threatened Central City with protracted 
litigation if the annexation was completed, presented ""sham"" objections in opposition to the proposed annexation, and interfered 
with the sale of municipal bonds. Accordingly, HN8[
] this court will not consider these allegations in deciding whether the complaint can survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6)."
1648,6," Plaintiffs argue the district court erred in failing to consider the contents of the grand jury report attached to the complaint in 
deciding whether the complaint stated an antitrust claim. HN9[
] Written documents attached to a complaint are properly 
treated as part of the pleadings for purposes of ruling on a motion to dismiss. Hall v. Bellmon, 935 F.2d 1106, 1112 (10th Cir. 
1991). The district court, however, specifically stated at the hearing on the Rule 12(b)(6) motion that it had referred to the report 
when considering the sufficiency of plaintiffs' claims. In any event, this court has consulted the report and concludes that the 
grand jury's findings are merely redundant to the allegations in the complaint. See Issa v. Comp USA, 354 F.3d 1174, 1178 (10th 
Cir. 2003) HN10[
] (""Because the legal sufficiency of a complaint is a question of law, we may affirm the district court's 
dismissal order if we independently determine that plaintiff failed to state a claim."" (quotation, citation, and alteration omitted)). "
1649,7," The non-governmental defendants are the Black Hawk Casino Owners Association; Horseshoe Casino, LLC d/b/a Canyon 
Casino; Black Hawk Brewery and Casino, LLC d/b/a Mardi Gras Casino; Black Hawk Gaming and Development Co., Inc.; Black 
Hawk Development North, LLC; BH Gateway, LLC d/b/a Jackpot Springs; Prospector 141, LLC; Woodmont Development Co., 
Inc.; Susan Barnes; Medill Barnes; Lary Brown; Phyllis Brown; and Herbert Bowles."
1649,8," These claims are discussed in Section IV.C.b, infra. "
1650,9," Plaintiffs' citation to FTC v. Superior Court Trial Lawyers Ass'n is inapposite. 493 U.S. 411, 107 L. Ed. 2d 851, 110 S. Ct. 768 
(1990). In that case, plaintiffs alleged that court-appointed defense attorneys had engaged in an anticompetitive boycott in order 
to force the District of Columbia government to increase their compensation. Id. at 414. Unlike Superior Court Trial Lawyers 
Ass'n, the alleged restraint of trade in this case was not the ""means by which [defendants] sought to obtain favorable legislation,"" 
but rather the ""intended consequence of public action."" Id. at 425-26."
1650,10," In addition to Eccker, Hailey, and Maloney, the city of Black Hawk was also named as a defendant in the initial complaint but 
was later dismissed as a party on plaintiffs' initiative. The trial court also dismissed claims against Aldermen David Spellman, 
Haller Midcap, and Tom Kerr, who were identified in the original complaint as agents of defendant Black Hawk Development 
North, LLC. Without supporting argument, plaintiffs ask this court to reinstate the claims asserted against these three defendants 
as agents of Black Hawk. This court declines the invitation to reinstate these defendants in light of its conclusion that Black 
Hawk officials are in any event immune from liability under the Local Government Antitrust Act of 1984. "
1651,11," The complaint alleges that the following defendants purchased undivided one-percent interests in the mining claims in 
exchange for payments of $ 500: Susan Barnes, Medill Barnes; Lary Brown; Phyllis Brown; Herbert Bowles; Geraldine Bowles; 
Eagle Gaming, LLC; Black Hawk Brewery, LLC; 101 Main Street, LLC; Black Hawk Gaming and Development Co., Inc.; Black 
Hawk Development North, LLC; BH Gateway, LLC; Woodmont Development Co., Inc.; and Prospector 141, LLC. "
1670,1," While Plaintiffs still caption their pleadings as ""on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated,"" the court denied 
Plaintiffs Motion for Class Certification on March 25, 2004."
1670,2," In order to obtain staff privileges, the bylaw required: Current certification and/or re-certification, without restriction, by the appropriate medical specialty board(s) recognized by 
the American Board of Medical Specialties, applicable to these Practitioner's Clinical Privileges, or to be eligible at the time 
of application for such certification and/or recertification and to obtain such certification or recertification within five years of 
eligibility. There is great dispute about when the bylaw, in this form, was adopted. In a Supplemental Memorandum filed with the court, 
Plaintiffs contend that the bylaw requirement of ABMS certification was not added until 1990, see PL Supp. Mem. at 4,while 
Defendants argue that the provision has been in place over twenty years. (Def. Reply, at 8) (""It is undisputed that the ABMS 
bylaw was adopted over twenty years ago ….""). From the record, it does appear that the bylaw was not in existence in its 
present form, including the ABMS requirement, until 1990."
1670,3," Plaintiffs contend that the AOA and ABMS meet the same standards as educational, accrediting, and approval bodies."
1670,4," The court dismissed this civil conspiracy claim on the grounds that under controlling law, HN1[
] for a common law conspiracy 
claim (unlike a federal antitrust claim), Plaintiffs had to demonstrate ""specific intent to injure a particular plaintiff."" See Whitfield v. 
John Bourne Co., 16 Fed. Appx. 116, 2001 WL 8451376, *7 (4th Cir. 2001). Here, because the bylaw was enacted before 
Plaintiffs applied for appointment to the medical staff, Plaintiffs could not prove this action was taken with specific intent to injure 
them. "
1671,," Notably, in Whitfield, the Court also HN2[
] rejected the plaintiff's attempt to parallel civil conspiracy and antitrust law, as the former required a more elevated standard of proof under South Carolina law. Accordingly, this court's prior ruling on Plaintiffs' 
civil conspiracy claim has little import on the viability of the antitrust claims."
1671,5," As Defendants point out, the court's finding with respect to liability on Plaintiff's federal antitrust claims will be dispositive of the 
state law antitrust claim. See, e.g., Steuer and Latham, PA. v. Nat'l Med. Enters. Inc., 672 F.Supp. 1489, 1521 (D.S.C. 1987) 
(holding that HN5[
] South Carolina has long adhered to a policy of following federal precedents in matters relating to state 
trade regulation enforcement). "
1672,6," As explained by the Ninth Circuit, antitrust plaintiffs often ""seek initially to have the defendant's conduct classified as a per se 
violation because it greatly simplifies the proof required."" Bhan, 929F.2d 1410."
1672,7," The Court also elaborated on the justifications for the existence of a per se rule. These include: (1) bypassing the significant 
costs involved in elaborate inquiry into the reasonableness of a challenged business practice when such practices almost always 
have an anticompetitive effect; (2) judicial convenience, when the judiciary already has experience with a particular kind of 
restraint and can automatically apply a per se rule; (3) certainty within the business community that courts will disapprove of 
certain types of business practices; and (4) the advancement of Congressional action to amend antitrust law; in the Court's 
opinion, Congressional action is furthered by unequivocal judicial pronouncements that certain business practices are per se 
violations while others are not. Maricopa, 457 U.S. at 343-44, 354. Of particular relevance to the present dispute, the Maricopa Court noted that per se treatment would not normally be appropriate 
when the challenged conduct was ""premised on public service or ethical norms."" 457 U.S. at 348-49. "
1673,8," As a threshold matter, the court notes that HN9[
] ""[a] group boycott is not, contrary to [Plaintiffs'] contentions, always averse 
violation."" Ginzburg v. Memorial Healthcare Systems, Inc., 993 F.Supp. 998, 1024 (S.D. Tex. 1997); see also Northwest 
Stationers, 472 U.S. at 298 (""the mere allegation of a concerted refusal to deal does not suffice because not all concerted 
refusals to deal are predominantly anticompetitive.""); Mackey v. Nat'l Football League, 543 F.2d 606, 619 (8th Cir. 1976) (""To 
outlaw certain types of business conduct merely by attaching the 'group boycott' and 'per se' labels obviously invites the chance 
that certain types of reasonable concerted activity will be proscribed."")."
1673,9," Essentially, the parties' arguments come down to whether this court will follow Weiss v. York Hosp., 745 F.2d 786 (3d Cir. 
1984), in which the Third Circuit applied a per se analysis to a boycott of D.O.s at a Pennsylvania hospital, or Flegel v. Christian 
Hosp. Northeast-Northwest, 4 F.3d 682 (8th Cir. 1993), in which the Eight Circuit applied the rule of reason to a similar restraint. "
1674,10," Notably, the Medical Center does have five D.O.s on its staff at present (including Dr. Amara) none of whom detail Weiss-like 
mistreatment. See Tobin Dep. at 69-70; Love Dep. at 55. The court is unsure as to whether each of these D.O.s satisfied the 
bylaw requirement by undertaking their training at allopathic medical facilities, and ultimately passing the ABMS boards, but 
presumes that this is the case with each."
1674,11," ""Pursuant to this reasoning, HN11[
] courts have generally been reluctant to: hold that a group of physicians who decide that they do not want to refer patients to a particular surgeon, because they 
doubt his qualifications, have committed a per se violation of the Sherman Act. Because actions on the part of hospitals and 
physicians, which might resemble group boycotts, may well be mandated by an ethically grounded concern for patients' 
well-being. . . such behavior, in the medical service industry, should be analyzed in terms of the rule of reason. Ginzburg, 993 F.Supp. at 1025, quoting Pontius v. Children's Hospital, 552 F.Supp. 1352, 1366 (D.C. Pa. 1982). Similarly here, 
because the hospital may reasonably make credentialing decisions regarding qualifications necessary to ensure patients' well-
being, the court should not employ a per se approach to analyze the behavior at issue."
1674,12," As an additional reason for rejectingWeiss, the court notes that it was decided before Northwest Wholesale Stationers, Inc. v. 
Pacific Stationery & Printing Co., 472 U.S. 284, 295, 86 L. Ed. 2d 202, 105 S. Ct. 2613 (1985). As discussed above, in 
Northwest Wholesale, the Court unequivocally held that a ""plaintiff seeking application of the per se rule must present a 
threshold case that the challenged activity falls into a category likely to have predominately anticompetitive effects."" Id. "
1675,13," The D.C. Circuit reached a similar conclusion in Kreuzer v. American Academy of Periodontology, 237 U.S. App. D.C. 43, 735 
F.2d 1479 (D.C.Cir. 1984). In Kreuzer, the court held that the rule of reason analysis governed a section 1 challenge to a rule 
promulgated by the American Academy of Periodontology (AAP) that limited membership in the AAP to licensed dentists who 
practice periodontics exclusively, and who do not practice other forms of dentistry. Id. at 1492. While the court labeled the effect 
of the AAP's rule a ""group boycott,"" it nonetheless concluded that ""when a conspiracy of this sort is alleged in the context of one 
of the learned professions, the nature and extent of its anticompetitive effect are often too uncertain to be amendable to per se 
treatment."" Id."
1675,14," The parties also argue about whether market power must be considered in determining whether the rule of reason or per se 
approach applies. Because the court has concluded that the challenged practice is not ""predominantly anticompetitive,"" it need 
not determine whether market power is a relevant inquiry. See Northwest Wholesale Stationers, Inc. v. Pacific Stationery & 
Printing Co., 472 U.S. 284, 295, 86 L. Ed. 2d 202, 105 S. Ct. 2613 (1985) (holding that a plaintiff seeking application of the per 
se rule must present a threshold case that the challenged activity falls into a category likely to have predominately 
anticompetitive effects). Were the court to reach this inquiry, it would conclude that market power is a relevant consideration. 
See, e.g., Indiana Fed'n, 476 U.S. at 458-459 (""The per se approach has generally been limited to cases in which firms with 
market power boycott suppliers or customers in order to discourage them from doing business with a competitor ….""). "
1676,15," Defendants raise additional arguments as to why they do not possess market power. For example, Defendants, basing their 
arguments on their expert's testimony, contend that "
1677,," Defendants do not have market power due to the significant outflow of Beaufort County patients to hospitals outside the 
county, and due to the significant share of orthopedic surgery patients that leave Hilton Head Island to obtain service from 
physicians who perform orthopedic surgical services at Beaufort Memorial Hospital. (Def. Mem. at 15). Because the relevant geographical market is in dispute, the court cannot make a determination of market 
power. See, e.g., Loiterman v. Antani, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8530, 1991 WL 117209, *3 (N.D.I11. June 25, 1991) (noting that 
HN17[
] once ""the geographic market becomes a fact in dispute,"" the court ""cannot reach a determination on the critical 
question of market power; therefore the question must go to the trier of fact…."")."
1677,16," Relatedly, Plaintiffs have submitted a Rule 56(f) affidavit averring that they need more time for discovery because of 
Defendants' late disclosure that the bylaw was not enacted until 1990. See, e.g., HarrodsLtd. v. Sixty Internet Domain Names, 
302 F.3d 214, 244 (4th Cir.2002) HN19[
] (""if a party believes that more discovery is necessary for it to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact, the proper course is to file a Rule 56(f) affidavit.""). Defendants have agreed to allow additional depositions 
in accordance with this affidavit. This recent disclosure, and the fact that some discovery continues, also militates against the 
granting of summary judgment in favor of Defendants. "
1678,17," Plaintiffs cite other circumstantial evidence of a conspiracy, including the medical staff's elimination of the category of staff 
their applications were submitted under, the ""Affiliate Active Staff category. In Plaintiffs' view, this action was taken in direct 
response to their applications,"" and further evidences the conspiracy amongst members of the medical staff. Moreover, Plaintiffs 
argue that the medical staff defendants' refusal to refer patients to Plaintiffs is ""indicative of the continuing conspiracy to prevent 
Plaintiffs from competing in the market."" (PL Opp. at 28). As the court has concluded there is sufficient circumstantial evidence 
of conspiratorial action to survive summary judgment without these allegations, in the interest of brevity, the court refrains from 
addressing whether these also potentially evidence a conspiracy to unlawfully restrain trade."
1678,18," The 90 individual practitioner Defendants (""practitioner Defendants"") have joined in the collective motion for summary 
judgment, but have their own additional supporting memorandum. In this memorandum, the practitioner Defendants largely 
reiterate arguments made in the collective memorandum, but highlight the argument that Plaintiffs have not specifically identified 
individual practitioners involved in a conspiracy to restrain trade. The practitioners argue that because the bylaw has ""existed for "
1679,," decades[,]"" Plaintiffs cannot prove a conspiracy. (Practitioner Def. Mem. at 13). The court believes, however, that this argument 
misapprehends the proof Plaintiffs rely on for evidence of a conspiracy. As discussed above, rather than the simple existence of 
the bylaw, Plaintiffs, in their opposition memorandum, cite actions taken by the medical staff, of which the ninety practitioners are 
members, that could reasonably evidence a conspiracy to prevent competition from osteopaths."
1679,19," The practitioner Defendants seek summary judgment on this claim on an additional ground. They argue that the South 
Carolina antitrust act ""is limited to cases involving the importation or sale of articles imported into this State or in the manufacture 
or sale of articles of domestic growth or of domestic raw material."" (Practitioner Mem. at 15). In making this argument, however, 
the Practitioner Defendants rely on only one section of the South Carolina antitrust statute. HN22[
] The court disagrees that 
South Carolina law limits state antitrust claims in this manner, as another section of the South Carolina antitrust statute provides All arrangements, contracts, agreements, trusts or combinations .. . (c) between two or more persons as individuals, firms, 
corporations, syndicates or associations that may lessen or affect in any manner the full and free competition in any tariff, 
rates, tolls, premium or prices in any branch of trade, business or commerce are declared to be against public policy, 
unlawful and void. S.C. Code Ann. § 39-3-10 (1985). "
1680,20," Both of these elements are closely related to the determination of whether an antitrust violation occurred. Because, as 
discussed above in relation to the antitrust claims, questions of motive and intent are generally those for the jury, the court must 
deny summary judgment on the intentional interference with contract claim as well. "
1681,21," Low Country Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, LLC was a medical center opened on Hilton Head Island by Plaintiff Welchlin 
after he was denied medical staff privileges. (Welchlin Dep. at 127). "
1692,1," The seventeen other states are: Arizona, Florida, Iowa, Kansas,  [*3] Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, 
Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wisconsin. Many of these non-
D.C. plaintiffs have also filed claims in their respective states, and defendants have filed Motions to Dismiss these claims too. To 
date, defendants have advised the Court that 13 of these state courts have dismissed the cases. "
1695,2," Even if the Court were to apply Holder and the ""target area"" test, D.C. plaintiff would still lack standing under § 28-4508. Under 
this test the Court would need to consider ""whether the injury to the plaintiff is a reasonably foreseeable  [*11] consequence of 
the defendant's illegal conduct."" D.C. plaintiff purchased consumer goods, which, he alleges, were burdened by defendants' 
overcharges. An endless amount of plaintiffs could make similar claims. All one has to do is purchase goods from a merchant 
who accepts Visa and Mastercard credit cards. Such a remote and speculative injury is not a ""reasonably foreseeable 
consequence of the defendant's illegal conduct."" "
1696,3," As a result of this settlement, the merchants actually hold the money to which plaintiffs claim they are entitled. This assumes 
the merchants passed on the costs. That assumption, however, may not be accurate since the merchants claim they are entitled 
to the funds thereby implying they absorbed the costs. In any event, allowing plaintiffs to recover from defendants would result in 
defendants paying double damages for the same injury. Moreover, the merchants could only claim the damages if they did not 
pass on the costs."
1696,4," For example, was it gas prices, increased labor costs, or debit card charges, to name a few factors, that increased the cost of a 
purchased item, and if so, by how much?"
1696,5," D.C. plaintiff lacks standing to pursue his claim for injunctive relief for the same reasons he lacks standing for his damages 
claim. He argues that even if he lacks standing to pursue his damages claim, he still would have standing to pursue his claim for 
injunctive relief because broader standing principles would apply. See Plaintiffs' Mem. in Opp. at 34. For this proposition, he 
cites Cargill, Inc. v. Montford of Colorado, Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 107 S. Ct. 484, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427 (1986), a case in which the 
Supreme Court recognized that certain differences exist under the Clayton Act between standing for injunctive relief and 
standing for damages. Id. at 111 n.6. While the Court did find some differences, it also ""found that under both § 16 [dealing with 
injunctive relief] and § 4 [dealing with damages] the plaintiff must still allege an injury of the type the antitrust laws were designed 
to prevent."" Id. at 111. As discussed above, D.C.  [*17] plaintiff fails to show that Congress intended to provide a remedy for his 
remote and speculative injuries. "
1701,1," Though the Complaint numbers plaintiffs' claims for relief from 1 to 6, the Complaint lacks a second claim for relief. "
1703,2,"  ""(1) When a proposal containing the terms of annexation is approved in the manner provided by the charter of the annexing 
city . . ., the boundaries of any city may be extended by the annexation of territory that is not within a city and that is 
contiguous to the [*8]  city . . . ""(2) A proposal for annexation of territory to a city may be initiated by the legislative body of the city, on its own motion, or 
by a petition to the legislative body of the city by owners of real property in the territory to be annexed."
1703,***,"  ""(5) The legislative body of the city shall submit . . . the proposal for annexation to the electors of the territory proposed for 
annexation and . . . the legislative body of the city shall submit such proposal to the electors of the city. . . ."
1703,***,"  ""(7) Two or more proposals for annexation of territory may be voted upon simultaneously; however, in the city each 
proposal shall be stated separately on the ballot and voted on separately, and in the territory proposed for annexation no 
proposal for annexing other territory shall appear on the ballot."" Or. Rev. Stat. § 222.111. "
1704,3," lnverse condemnation is ""the popular description of a cause of action against a governmental defendant to recover the value of 
property which has been taken in fact by the governmental defendant, even though no formal exercise of the power of eminent 
domain has been attempted by the taking agency."" Thornburg v. Port of Portland, 233 Or. 178, 180 n.1, 376 P.2d 100 (1963)."
1704,4," A party who asserts that a land use decision or regulation gives rise to a regulatory taking may choose to invoke either the 
authority of the Oregon Land Use Board of Appeals (LUBA) to invalidate the decision per se, or the court's authority to provide "
1705,," an inverse condemnation remedy. Scappoose Sand and Gravel, Inc. v. Columbia County, 161 Or. App. 325, 332, 984 P.2d 876 
(1999)."
1705,5," Defendant moves to strike numerous portions of Jones's affidavit, which describes the alleged delay and harm. Defendant 
argues that Jones's affidavit is contradicted by Jones's prior sworn deposition testimony and that many portions of the affidavit 
are conclusory, irrelevant, and/or rely on hearsay. After reading Jones's affidavit, the court agrees and grants defendant's Motion 
to Strike. "
1707,6,"  ""Except as provided in ORS 12.120, 12.135 and 659A.875, but notwithstanding any other provision of ORS chapter 12 or 
other statute providing a limitation on the commencement of an action, an action arising from any act or omission of a 
public body or an officer, employee or agent of a public body within the scope of ORS 30.260 to 30.300 shall be 
commenced within [*20]  two years after the alleged loss or injury."" Or. Rev. Stat. § 30.275(9)."
1707,7,"  ""An action for assault, battery, false imprisonment, or for any injury to the person or rights of another, not arising on 
contract, and not especially enumerated in this chapter, shall be commenced within two years; provided, that in an action at 
law based upon fraud or deceit, the limitation shall be deemed to commence only from the discovery of the fraud or deceit."" Or. Rev. Stat. § 12.110(1). "
