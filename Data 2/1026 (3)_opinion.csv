368,Counsel,"Counsel:
As I mentioned at the close of the hearing held on June 7, 2005, there is a series of motions pending in another 
proceeding in which I am involved to which I will have to turn my attention in the coming weeks. I expressed to you 
my concern that as a result, it might take me more time than I would like to rule upon Microsoft's motion to dismiss 
in this case. After the hearing, however, I concluded that [*2]  close and difficult though the issues are, I am 
prepared to decide them now, particularly while your excellent arguments are still fresh in my mind.
It is neither in your interest nor in the public interest to delay resolution of your dispute any longer. Therefore, 
instead of postponing my rulings until my schedule would permit me to write a more extensive opinion, I have 
decided to issue my rulings now, setting forth my reasoning in this short memorandum to you. I hope you 
understand that the form and nature of the opinion does not mean that I have not considered the questions 
presented as thoroughly and carefully as I can. As I have previously done in these MDL proceedings, I am simply 
following my own adage of ""writing for the parties, not for the ages.""
Microsoft's motion is denied as to Counts I and VI but granted as to Counts II, III, IV, and V.
Counts I and VI
In Count I Novell alleges that Microsoft unlawfully ""obtained and maintained its monopoly power in the Intel-
compatible operating systems market by engaging in anticompetitive conduct"" and that as a result Novell was 
damaged, specifically through lost sales of ""office productivity applications"" (including WordPerfect,  [*3]  a word 
processing program, and Quattro Pro, a spreadsheet program). Microsoft acknowledges that the claim asserted in 
Count I is not time-barred because the focus of the government case against Microsoft (during the pendency of 
which limitations of private rights of action were tolled under 15 U.S.C. § 16(i)) was upon Microsoft's monopoly in 
the operating system market. Count VI is based upon Microsoft's exclusionary agreements with OEMs, which 
allegedly were in unreasonable restraint of trade. Although Microsoft does not expressly concede the point, such 
agreements also were a subject of the government case. Thus, limitations has been tolled as to the claim asserted 
in Count VI.
In regard to Count I Microsoft makes two contentions, neither of which is meritorious. First, it argues that Novell no 
longer owns the claim asserted in that count because it transferred the claim to Caldera in connection with the sale 
of the DOS operating system, related technology, and claims relating ""directly or indirectly"" to it. The fallacy in this 
argument is that the claim asserted in Count I, while arising from Microsoft's monopoly in the operating system 
market, is for damage [*4]  not to DOS or any other operating system but for damage to applications software. It is 
a far stretch to infer (and Microsoft has presented nothing to establish) that simply because DOS competed in the 
2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11520, *11520

 
operating system market, such a claim was either a ""direct"" or ""indirect"" claim intended to be transferred from 
Novell to Caldera. Of course, Novell did also have claims against Microsoft for damage caused to DOS and related 
technology, but these claims (which were settled after Caldera sued Microsoft) are not part of the present action.
Microsoft next argues that Novell lacks antitrust standing as to Count I because the office productivity applications 
alleged to have been damaged did not compete in the operating system market. According to Microsoft, there is a 
black-letter rule that only competitors or consumers in a relevant market have standing to sue for harm caused by 
anti-competitive behavior in that market. Microsoft overstates the proposition. Certainly, HN1[
] competitors and 
consumers in a given market ""are favored plaintiffs,"" and, just as certainly, ""the list of those presumptively 
disfavored is far longer."" SAS of Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Puerto Rico Tel. Co., 48 F.3d 39, 45 (1st Cir. 1995). [*5]  See 
also White v. Rockingham Radiologists, Ltd., 820 F.2d 98, 104 (4th Cir. 1987); Lucas v. Bechtel Corp., 800 F.2d 
839, 845-46 (9th Cir. 1986). However, the Supreme Court has not established a litmus test for antitrust standing 
based upon a plaintiff's status. Rather, in Associated General Contractors v. California State Council of Carpenters, 
459 U.S. 519, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723, 103 S. Ct. 897 (1983), the Court -- while pointing out that the plaintiff whom it found 
not to have antitrust standing ""was neither a consumer nor a competitor in the market in which trade was 
restrained,"" id. at 539 -- did not simply rely upon that fact but instead articulated a series of factors to be considered 
in deciding the standing question. Id. at 537-45.
In the present case the gravamen of the claim asserted in Count I is that Microsoft specifically targeted Novell for 
the purpose of maintaining its monopoly in the operating system market. According to Novell, WordPerfect and 
Quattro Pro, its popular office productivity applications, posed a threat to Microsoft's operating system monopoly 
because Novell had engineered them to exploit Novell's existing [*6]  cross-platform technologies, such as 
OpenDoc and AppWare. Moreover, because these applications were being developed to run independently of any 
operating system, particularly Windows, and because the consumer demand for them was great, Microsoft saw the 
need to attack them. In support of this view, Novell, citing an internal Microsoft email, contends that ""Microsoft 
recognized that it had to control the office productivity applications market to fend off that threat to its operating 
systems monopoly."" The Microsoft email stated as follows:
If we own the key franchises' built on top of the operating system, we dramatically widen the ""moat"" that 
protects the operating system business. . . . We hope to make a lot of money off these franchises, but even 
more important is that they should protect our Windows royalty per PC. . . . And success in those businesses 
will help increase the opportunity for future pricing discretion.
E-mail from Jeff Raikes, Microsoft, to Warren Buffet (Aug. 17, 1997).
Novell also alleges that it was a company of particular concern to Microsoft. Paragraph 7 of the Complaint avers:
Bill Gates, Microsoft's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,  [*7]  targeted Novell's applications by name in 
documents recording Microsoft's anticompetitive schemes, in which he explained that the integration of 
browsing functions into Windows, coupled with Microsoft's refusal to publish certain of these functions, was a 
primary strategy for excluding Novell's applications from the markets. He candidly admitted that Microsoft's own 
products could not compete without the benefit of these anticompetitive acts.
Against this background, it is clear to me that Novell meets the various parts of the multi-factored test established 
by Associated General Contractors for antitrust standing. First, there is a direct causal connection between the 
anticompetitive acts Microsoft allegedly took against Novell's office productivity applications for the purpose of 
maintaining its operating systems monopoly and the damage claimed in Count I. Second, Microsoft allegedly 
targeted Novell specifically because it perceived Novell as an innovator in the industry. This targeting demonstrates 
that, at the least, Microsoft perceived Novell to be a competitor. See Reazin v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Kan., 
Inc., 899 F.2d 951, 962-63 (10th Cir. 1990). [*8]  Third, destruction of a competitor's product for the purpose of 
maintaining a monopoly self-evidently is the type of harm for which the antitrust laws are intended to provide 
redress. Fourth, Novell's claim is direct and straightforward. Fifth, although there were other victims of other 
anticompetitive acts committed by Microsoft for the purpose of maintaining its monopoly in the operating system 
market, Novell is the only victim who could bring suit for the acts taken by Microsoft in regard to WordPerfect and 
2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11520, *4

 
Quattro Pro -- acts which ultimately had an enormous impact upon the shape of the applications software market. 1 
Finally, no problem of speculative damages or complex apportionment of damages is presented because Novell is 
the only person with a claim for the damages it allegedly suffered in connection with WordPerfect and Quattro Pro 
between 1994 and 1996 when it sold those products to Corel.
 [*9]  2. Counts II, III, IV, and V
HN2[
] Under 15 U.S.C. § 16(i) the limitations period is tolled for ""every private right of action . . . based in whole 
or in part on any matter complained of"" in an antitrust action brought by the United States. For the reasons I have 
just stated, I find that the claims asserted in Counts I and VI are tolled under this section. As Microsoft contends, 
however, the mere fact that limitations are tolled as to two counts in a complaint is not sufficient to toll all other 
counts in the complaint. Section 16(i) refers not to ""complaints"" but to ""right[s] of action,"" and self-evidently HN3[
] 
a party cannot be permitted to circumvent the purpose of the statute by simply joining tolled and untolled claims in 
the same complaint
The broad principles governing the tolling issue may be briefly stated.HN4[
]  The governing test is whether the 
matters complained of in the private action ""bear a real relation"" to a matter complained of in the government suit. 
Leh v. Gen. Petroleum Corp., 382 U.S. 54, 59, 15 L. Ed. 2d 134, 86 S. Ct. 203 (1965). ""The private plaintiff is not 
required to allege that the same means were used to achieve the same objectives of the same conspiracies [*10]  
by the same defendants,"" id. at 59, but simply must allege ""a significant, although incomplete, overlap of subject 
matter"" to toll the statute, ""even as to the differences."" Morton's Market, Inc. v. Gustafson's Dairy, Inc., 198 F.3d 
823, 830 (11th Cir. 1999). ""In general, consideration of the applicability of . . . [section 16(i)] must be limited to a 
comparison of the two complaints on their face."" Leh, 382 U.S. at 65; Greyhound Corp. v. Mt. Hood Stages, Inc., 
437 U.S. 322, 331, 57 L. Ed. 2d 239, 98 S. Ct. 2370 (1978). 2 Section 16(i) is not to be given a ""niggardly 
construction"" and must be ""read in light of Congress' belief that private antitrust litigation is one of the surest 
weapons for effective enforcement of the antitrust laws.""' Leh, 382 U.S. at 59 (quoting Minn. Mining & Mfg. Co. v. 
N.J. Wood Finishing Co., 381 U.S. 311, 318, 14 L. Ed. 2d 405, 85 S. Ct. 1473 (1965)).
 [*11]  In its complaint in this action, Novell refers frequently to allegations and findings made in the government 
case against Microsoft. These reference are incorporated by reference into counts II through V. Those counts, 
however, assert claims for monopolization and attempted monopolization in the word processing and spreadsheet 
applications markets: claims that were never asserted by the government. While there was a single conclusory 
averment in the government's complaint that Microsoft engaged in anticompetitive activities both to protect its 
operating system monopoly and ""to extend . . . [that] monopoly into other software markets,"" Gvt. Compl., at P 5, 
the only markets defined and focused upon in the government complaint were the operating system and browser 
markets. Word processing and spreadsheet programs are specifically mentioned only once in the government 
1 It would seem that an implication of Microsoft's contention that Novell lacks antitrust standing as to the claim asserted in Count 
I is that Sun and Netscape also lacked antitrust standing to the extent that they were not direct competitors in the operating 
system market, i.e., owners of alternative operating systems, but rather developers of middleware products that threatened to 
render Microsoft's operating system obsolete. Even if that is not so, however, I am satisfied that for the reasons I have stated, 
Novell may (just as Netscape and Sun did) assert antitrust claims for harm allegedly caused to its non-operating system 
products as a result of Microsoft's anticompetitive behavior designed to protect its Windows monopoly.
2 As Novell notes, several courts have glimpsed at the record in the government suit in order to evaluate the comparability of the 
government and private actions. See, e.g., Morton's Market, 198 F.3d at 830-32. That approach, however, does not provide any 
greater support for Novell than does a simple comparison of its complaint and the complaint in the United States' action against 
Microsoft. The record in the government suit confirms that while an occasional expert may have referred to abuses that occurred 
in related software markets, those references did not result in any charge of monopolization or attempted monopolization in the 
office productivity applications market. Indeed, the greatest difference between the complaint in the government action and the 
ultimate resolution of the case was that whereas the complaint alleged anticompetitive behavior both in the operating system 
market and in a browser market, the Court of Appeals ultimately found that the evidence did not substantiate the existence of the 
latter market. United States v. Microsoft, 346 U.S. App. D.C. 330, 253 F.3d 34, 81-81 (D.C. Cir. 2001).
2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11520, *8

 
complaint, and only in the section describing the operating system market and only as applications that are 
""controlled"" and ""directed"" by operating systems. Id. at P 54.
Novell accepts, as of course it must, that operating systems and office productivity applications are distinct products 
and are in [*12]  separate markets. It also accepts as ""unremarkable"" the bright-line rule stated by Professor 
Areeda that HN5[
] limitations are not tolled when ""the government and subsequent private suits . . . arose in 
distinct markets."" 2 Philip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P 321a, at 241 (2d ed. 2000). That 
proposition is supported by such cases as In re Coordinated Pretrial Proceedings in Petroleum Products Antitrust 
Litigation, 782 F. Supp. 481 (C.D. Cal. 1991), and Charley's Tour and Transportation, Inc. v. Interisland Resorts, 
Ltd., 618 F. Supp. 84 (D. Haw. 1985), which held, respectively, that differences between geographic and product 
markets in the government suits and private actions prevented tolling under Section 16(i). Novell argues, however, 
that because the operating system and applications markets are closely, indeed symbiotically related, this bright-
line rule should not apply. Cf. In re Arizona Dairy Prods. Litig., 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22199, No. CIV 74-569A (D. 
Ariz. Nov. 5, 1984)(finding claim for private action for price-fixing conspiracy in retail milk market tolled based on 
government suit for price-fixing conspiracy in wholesale milk market); In re Antibiotic Antitrust Actions, 333 F. Supp. 
317, 320-21 (S.D.N.Y. 1971) [*13]  (finding claim for damage suffered in a foreign market for agricultural 
consumption tolled by government suit for conduct in domestic market relating to human consumption). I am not 
persuaded. The nature of the relationship between the markets is important to an understanding of the dynamics of 
the industry, and it is central to my earlier holding that Novell has antitrust standing for harm allegedly caused to 
WordPerfect and Quattro Pro by Microsoft's maintenance of its Windows monopoly. However, the government case 
focused solely upon the operating system market (and an asserted browser market, ultimately found by the Court of 
Appeals to be unsubstantiated by the evidence), and Novell has provided no adequate explanation for not applying 
the bright-line rule recited by Professor Areeda in this case.
Undoubtedly, if the government had pursued additional charges of monopolization and attempted monopolization in 
the word processing and spreadsheet markets, there would have been some overlap in evidence concerning the 
conduct in which Microsoft engaged. However, the government deliberately chose not to lodge any such charges, 3 
and in my judgment the existence of such a potential overlap [*14]  does not justify tolling under Section 16(i). HN6[
] While Section 16(i) properly serves the purpose of permitting private plaintiffs to wait to bring private claims 
encompassed within a government enforcement action until that action has come to an end, it should not be 
construed to permit private plaintiffs to sit on their rights and assert claims so much broader than those asserted by 
the government that they open entirely new vistas of litigation. If Novell wanted to assert claims for monopolization 
and attempted monopolization in the word processing and spreadsheet markets, it should have done so long ago. 
Its inaction entitles Microsoft to the comfort of repose. Cf. Greyhound Corp. v. Mt. Hood Stages, Inc., 437 U.S. 322, 
334, 57 L. Ed. 2d 239, 98 S. Ct. 2370 (1978)(citing Dungan v. Morgan Drive-Away, Inc., 570 F.2d 867, 869 (1978) 
for the proposition that the limitations statute is one of ""repose"").
 [*15]  Despite the informal nature of this letter, it should be flagged as an opinion and docketed as an order.

3 That such a charge could have been asserted certainly was not unknown. State Attorney Generals originally included a claim 
for harm for a market for office productivity applications in the complaint they filed. (See Complaint filed in New York v. Microsoft 
Corp. PP 88-95, 98, 117-19, No. 98-1233 (D.D.C. filed May 18, 1998)). Of course, the filing of this claim did not toll limitations 
because section 16(i) applies only to actions brought by the United States. In any event, within two months the Attorney 
Generals abandoned that claim when filing an amended complaint. (See First Amended Complaint filed in New York v. Microsoft 
Corp., No. 98-1233 (D.D.C. filed July 17, 1998)).

The standards for summary judgment are well established. Summary judgment is proper if the pleadings, 
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is 
no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Fed.

HN2[

The party opposing a properly supported summary judgment motion may not rest upon the mere allegations or 
denials of his pleading, but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. The court is 
not duty bound to search the entire record in an effort to establish a lack of material facts. Rather, the burden is on 
the non-moving party to present affirmative evidence to defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment, 
and to designate specific facts in dispute.

HN4[
]  Summary Judgment, Evidentiary Considerations
The court upon a motion for summary judgment construes the evidence presented in the light most favorable to the 
non-movant and draws all justifiable inferences in the non-movant's favor. The court's function is not to weigh the 
evidence and determine the truth of the matter, but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial. The court 
must assess whether there is the need for trial -- whether, in other words, there are any genuine factual issues that 
properly can be resolved only by a finder of fact because they may reasonably be resolved in favor of either party. If 
the evidence is merely colorable, or is not significantly probative, the court may grant judgment.

HN5[
]  Summary Judgment, Evidentiary Considerations
Upon a motion for summary judgment, the mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiff's 
position will be insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff. The 
judge's inquiry, therefore, unavoidably asks whether reasonable jurors could find by a preponderance of the 
evidence that the plaintiff is entitled to a verdict. Hence the ""mere possibility"" of a factual dispute will not suffice.

HN6[
]  Summary Judgment, Evidentiary Considerations
Summary judgment is not appropriate simply because the weight of the evidence favors the moving party. The 
issue of material fact required to entitle a party to proceed to trial is not required to be resolved conclusively in favor 
of the party asserting its existence; rather, all that is required is that sufficient evidence supporting the claimed 
factual dispute be shown to require a jury or judge to resolve the parties' differing versions of the truth at trial.

Although summary judgment must be used with extreme caution since it operates to deny a litigant his day in court, 
the United States Supreme Court has stated that the summary judgment procedure is properly regarded not as a 
disfavored procedural shortcut, but rather as an integral part of the Federal Rules as a whole, which are designed to 
secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action.

The Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.S. § 1, prohibits contracts or agreements that unreasonably restrain trade or 
commerce. The contracts at issue in this case are evaluated under the ""rule of reason"" test. This analysis must take 
into account a variety of factors, including specific information about the relevant business, its condition before and 
after the restraint was imposed, and the restraint's history, nature, and effect. The first, and critical, step in any rule 
of reason analysis is that the plaintiff must prove that the challenged action has had an actual adverse effect on 
2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11676, *1

 
competition as a whole in the relevant market. Under the rule-of-reason analysis, the antitrust plaintiff must show, 
inter alia, an adverse effect on competition.

Exclusivity provisions in contracts can serve useful, pro-competitive purposes. It is only when such provisions cross 
the line into the arena of exclusive dealing that substantially and negatively affects market competition, that the 
antitrust statutes, including the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.S. § 1, come into play.

A claim under § 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.S. § 2, requires proof of two elements: (1) the possession of 
monopoly power in a relevant market; and (2) the willful acquisition, maintenance, or use of that power by anti-
competitive or exclusionary means as opposed to growth or development resulting from a superior product, 
business acumen, or historic accident.

Unlawful exclusionary conduct for purposes of Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.S. § 2, liability has been described as acts 
that are reasonably capable of creating, enlarging or prolonging monopoly power by impairing the opportunities of 
rivals and that either do not benefit consumers at all, are unnecessary for the particular consumer benefits that the 
acts produce, or produce harms disproportionate to the resulting benefits. To this end, it must be kept in mind that 
when considering an allegation of exclusionary or anti-competitive conduct, the antitrust laws are intended to 
protect competition, not a competitor.

Under the best of circumstances, applying the requirements of section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.S. § 2, can 
be difficult because the means of illicit exclusion, like the means of legitimate competition, are myriad. Mistaken 
inferences and the resulting false condemnations are especially costly, because they chill the very conduct the 
antitrust laws are designed to protect.

HN17[
]  Private Actions, Remedies
A private plaintiff may not recover damages under the antitrust laws merely by showing an injury causally linked to 
an illegal presence in the market. Antitrust laws are intended to prevent injuries to competition, and thus provide a 
remedy only for those losses that stem from the competition-reducing aspects of a defendant's conduct. There must 
be a distinct causal link between that challenged conduct, and the harm which Plaintiffs allege they have suffered. 
The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has been zealous in ensuring that this element of an 
antitrust claim is satisfied."
