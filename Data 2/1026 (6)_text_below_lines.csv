26,1," HN4[
] General Statutes § 7-483(b) authorizes municipalities ""[t]o construct, reconstruct, rehabilitate, improve, alter, equip, maintain or repair or provide for the construction, reconstruction, improvement, alteration, equipment or maintenance or repair of 
any development property and let, award and enter into construction contracts, purchase orders and other contracts with respect 
thereto upon such terms and conditions as the municipality shall determine to be reasonable, including but not limited to 
reimbursement for the planning, designing, financing, construction, reconstruction, improvement, equipping, furnishing, operation 
and maintenance of any such development property and the settlement of any claims arising therefrom and the establishment 
and maintenance of reserve funds with respect to the financing of such development property."" "
27,2," Section 35-26 provides that HN9[
] ""Every contract, combination, or conspiracy in restraint of any part of trade or commerce 
is unlawful."""
27,3," Section 35-27 provides that HN10[
] ""Every contract, combination, or conspiracy to monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or 
monopolization of any part of trade or commerce is unlawful."""
27,4," Section 35-28 provides that HN11[
] ""Without limiting section 35-26, every contract, combination, or conspiracy is unlawful when the same are for the purpose, or have the effect of: (a) Fixing, controlling, or maintaining prices, rates, quotations, or fees 
in any part of trade or commerce; (b) fixing, controlling, maintaining, limiting, or discontinuing the production, manufacture, 
mining, sale, or supply of any part of trade or commerce; (c) allocating or dividing customers or markets, either functional or 
geographical, in any part of trade or commerce; or (d) refusing to deal, or coercing, persuading, or inducing third parties to 
refuse to deal with another person."""
27,5," Section 35-35 states that HN15[
] ""The state, or any person, including, but not limited to, a consumer, injured in its business 
or property by any violation of the provisions of this chapter shall recover treble damages, together with a reasonable attorneys 
fee and costs."" "
28,6," Section 35-45(a) states in pertinent part that HN17[
] ""No person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, 
either directly or indirectly, shall discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality, 
where either or any of the purchases involved in such discrimination are in commerce, where such commodities are sold for use, 
consumption or resale within Connecticut; and where the effect of such discrimination may be to lessen competition or tend to 
create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy or prevent competition with any person who either grants or 
knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them . . ."" "
36,1," In accordance with the standard of review for a motion for summary judgment, the court will present the facts in the light most 
favorable to plaintiff, the non-moving party. See infra Part II. "
37,2," See discussion infra Part I.C regarding Dr. Bakare's precautionary suspension on August 27, 2002 and subsequent 
modification granting conditional privileges."
37,3," On November 20, 2001, Dr. Bakare was reappointed to the medical staff of Pinnacle Health Hospitals through November 19, 
2003. (Doc. 103 P 46; Doc. 113 P 46.)"
37,4," See discussion infra Part I.D.1 regarding the termination of Dr. Bakare's contract with Hamilton on August 30, 2002. "
38,5," The executive summary presented to Pinnacle's Board regarding the proposal indicated that ""[f]or some time management has 
been exploring ways to reduce the operating losses from indigent care clinics operated by Pinnacle Health."" (Doc. 104, Ex. C at 
P00229.) Pinnacle was losing approximately $ 2 million per year on its OB/GYN services. (Doc. 105, Ex. EE at HAM0059.)"
38,6," In his response to defendants' statement of undisputed facts, Dr. Bakare denied the proffered reasons for Hamilton's 
termination of negotiations and stated instead that ""Hamilton chose to discontinue discussions because Pinnacle refused to 
subsidize the combined clinic in the manner authorized by Pinnacle's Board of Directors."" (Doc. 113 P 274.) However, Dr. 
Bakare did not reference any part of the record that supports his assertion. See L.R. 56.1 (HN1[
] ""Statements of material facts 
in support of, or in opposition to, a motion shall include references to the parts of the record that support the statements.""). 
Therefore, defendants' corresponding statement, which referenced the parts of the record supporting the statement, is deemed 
admitted. See id. This denial is but one example, of many, where plaintiff does not offer record support for his conclusory 
statements. (See, e.g., Doc. 113 PP 121, 148, 150, 233, 255, 272.) See Elmore v. Clarion Univ. of Pa., 933 F. Supp. 1237, 1247 
(M.D. Pa. 1996) (stating that HN2[
] parties have an affirmative duty to proffer citations to relevant evidence); see also L.R."
38,56," .1; Doeblers' Pa. Hybrids, Inc. v. Doebler, 442 F.3d 812, 820 n.8 (3d Cir. 2006). "
39,7," MEC is a committee of Pinnacle Health Hospitals' medical staff charged, in part, with ensuring competent clinical performance 
for all members with clinical privileges. (Doc. 113, Ex. 16 art. VI, § 1(A), (B)(11)). Not only may MEC recommend the ""reduction, 
suspension or revocation of clinical privileges"" of a practitioner, but it may also suspend all or a portion of the clinical privileges of 
a practitioner if the practitioner's ""conduct requires that immediate action be taken to protect the life of any patient(s) or to reduce 
the substantial likelihood of immediate threat to the health or safety of any patient."" (Doc. 113, Ex. 16 art. IX, §§ 4(A)(6), 5(A))."
39,8," Dr. Bakare denies receiving this letter. He contends that MEC's attorney called him one week before MEC's May 2002 session 
to inform him of the meeting and its subject matter. According to Dr. Bakare, the attorney told him that there was no requirement 
that he attend the meeting, but that he was invited to attend. (Doc. 113 P 138; Doc. 113, Ex. 1 P 40.) "
40,9," During MEC meetings, either the chair or another member would remind the other members of the requirement of strict 
confidentiality of MEC proceedings. (Doc. 113, Ex. 10 at 22; Doc. 178, Ex. D at 56.) This policy of confidentiality is not reflected 
in Pinnacle Health Hospitals' Medical Staff Bylaws. (See Doc. 113, Ex. 16.)"
40,10," Twenty-eight members of MEC, including Drs. Kellis and Bronitsky were present at the August 27, 2002 meeting. (Doc. 104, 
Ex. D at P00072.)"
40,11," Dr. Kellis's report did not recommend that MEC impose an immediate, precautionary suspension. (Doc. 113, Ex. 32.) "
41,12," The Pinnacle Health Hospitals' Medical Staff Bylaws require that the affected practitioner be notified after a precautionary 
suspension. MEC must review the precautionary suspension as soon as practicable, but not more than seven days after 
imposition. If MEC does not immediately terminate the precautionary suspension or cease all corrective action, the affected 
practitioner is entitled to the rights as set forth in the Fair Hearing Plan. (Doc. 113, Ex. 16 art. IX, § 5.)"
41,13," Other than Dr. Kellis, none of the MEC members who voted for Dr. Bakare's precautionary suspension had any involvement in 
the negotiations between Pinnacle and Hamilton regarding the potential combination of their OB/GYN services. (Doc. 103 P 283; 
Doc. 113 P 283.)"
41,14," FHC consisted of five medical doctors appointed by the President of the Medical Staff. (Doc. 103 P 176; Doc. 113 P 176; Doc. 
34, Ex. 12.)"
41,15," FHC outlined the incorrect facts, if any, for each case and why it determined that Dr. Bakare's management of a case did not 
fall below the standard of care. (Doc. 34, Ex. 12.) "
42,16," Hamilton's CEO also received a letter to this effect from Pinnacle Health System. (See Doc. 106, Ex. III at 23.)"
42,17," Dr. Bakare contends, without support, that Hamilton terminated his contract because ""Hamilton also did not want [me] to 
participate in the planned combined clinic."" (Doc. 113 P 233; Doc. 103 P 233.) See supra note 6."
42,18, The identities of the other nurses in the operating room are unknown.
42,19," Dr. Moore allegedly informed Dr. Bakare's former attorney that he had told people at Pinnacle that Dr. Bakare provided bad 
care. (Doc. 113, Ex. 7 at 14-15, 19.) "
43,20," Dr. Longenderfer indicated that all physicians who have staff privileges at the hospital are eligible for the on-call list. (Doc. 113, 
Ex. 2 at 96-97.)"
43,21," The decision to remove Dr. Bakare from the moonlighting schedule was a joint decision between the Medical Director and Dr. 
Kellis. (Doc. 106, Ex. ZZ at 57-62.)"
43,22," By order of April 5, 2005, the court denied Dr. Bakare's motion for leave to file a third amended complaint. (Doc. 81)."
43,23," Because Pinnacle and Hamilton have ceased negotiations to combine their OB/GYN clinics, Dr. Bakare's request for injunctive 
relief is moot."
43,24," During oral argument on the motions for summary judgment, Dr. Bakare acknowledged the abandonment of all claims against 
Dr. Evans. See Jordan v. Stanziola, 96 F. App'x 839, 841 n.2 (3d Cir. 2004) (stating that a party had abandoned a claim when 
""counsel explicitly abandoned that claim at oral argument""); see also FED. R. CIV. P. 56(d). Accordingly, the court will grant 
summary judgment in favor of Dr. Evans on Dr. Bakare's antitrust and tortious interference with contract claims without further 
discussion."
43,25," Defendants also filed a motion (Doc. 123) to strike portions of Dr. Bakare's affidavit opposing the motions for summary 
judgment. Because the challenged portions of the affidavit do not affect the court's disposition of the motions for summary 
judgment, the court will deny the motion to strike as moot. "
44,26," Dr. Bakare argues that numerous activities surrounding the action taken by MEC do not comply with HCQIA requirements. 
However, HN6[
] professional review activity, unlike a professional review action, is not subject to the requirements of §"
44,11112," (a). See Mathews, 87 F.3d at 634. A professional review action is: "
45,," [A]n action or recommendation of a professional review body which is taken or made in the conduct of professional review 
activity, which is based on the competence or professional conduct of an individual physician (which conduct affects or 
could affect adversely the health or welfare of a patient or patients), and which affects (or may affect) adversely the clinical 
privileges, or membership in a professional society, of the physician. Id. § 11151(9); see also Mathews, 87 F.3d at 634 (""The definition of 'professional review action' encompasses decisions or 
recommendations by peer review bodies that directly curtail a physician's clinical privileges . . . .""). In contrast, professional 
review activity involves ""the investigative process during and/or upon which a professional review action, i.e., a decision, is 
made."" Id. (citation omitted). The professional review action in the instant matter is MEC's decision to impose a precautionary 
suspension and to recommend the revocation of Dr. Bakare's appointment to the medical staff. The other conduct challenged by 
Dr. Bakare--e.g., the QA Committee's assessment of points and Dr. Kellis's investigation into the facts of the cases at issue--is 
professional review activity, not subject to the requirements of § 11112(a). See id. Accordingly, the relevant inquiry is whether 
MEC's corrective action complied with the requirements of HCQIA, not whether the initial QA Committee assessment or the 
investigation complied with these requirements. "
46,27," Dr. Bakare argues that alleged deficiencies in the QA Committee's process of reviewing his cases and assigning points 
removes HCQIA immunity. However, the QA Committee's actions need not satisfy HCQIA requirements of 42 U.S.C. § 11112(a) 
because they do not constitute professional review actions as defined by HCQIA. See supra note 26."
46,28," Dr. Kellis clearly advised the expert that the case summaries were intended to assist the expert and not to influence his 
conclusions in any fashion. (See Doc. 105, Ex. O at P00757.)"
46,29," Dr. Bakare contends that the appropriateness of his professional performance was readily apparent from the patient charts 
and that MEC's acceptance of facts contradicted by the patient charts ipso facto demonstrates an unreasonable effort on the 
part of MEC. For example, Dr. Bakare highlights an assertion in Dr. Kellis's report to MEC that Dr. Bakare did not respond to a 
call to see a patient for six hours--an assertion contradicted by the patient's chart which reveals that he responded within twenty-
five minutes. This isolated factual discrepancy does not negate MEC's reasonable efforts to obtain the facts. MEC sent the 
relevant patient charts to an independent expert who reviewed the cases and concluded that Dr. Bakare's care fell below the 
standard. Under these circumstances, MEC's actions were reasonable."
46,30," Although Dr. Bakare did not accept delivery of Dr. Kellis's letter, he nevertheless acknowledges that he would not have 
responded to it even if he had received it. (See Doc. 106, Ex. TT at 191.)"
46,31," The court finds that, given the independent expert's assessment of Dr. Bakare's cases, MEC reasonably believed that the 
precautionary suspension was necessary to protect against ""imminent danger to the health of any individual."" 42 U.S.C. § 
11112(c)(2); see also Lee v. Trinity Lutheran Hosp., 408 F.3d 1064, 1072 (8th Cir. 2005) (HN11[
] ""[T]he [HCQIA] does not 
require imminent danger to exist before a summary restraint is imposed. It only requires that the danger may result if the 
restraint is not imposed."" (citations omitted)). "
47,32," The letter also informed Dr. Bakare that MEC recommended to the Board of Directors that his appointment to the medical staff 
be revoked. This letter satisfied the safe harbor provision for a ""Notice of Proposed Action,"" which requires: The physician has been given notice stating-- (A)(i) that a professional review action has been proposed to be taken against the physician, (ii) reasons for the proposed action, (B)(i) that the physician has the right to request a hearing on the proposed action, (ii) any time limit (of not less than 30 days) within which to request such a hearing, and (C) a summary of the rights in the hearing under paragraph (3)."
47,42," U.S.C. § 11112(b)(1); see also Mathews, 87 F.3d at 638 n.10. Dr. Bakare does not contest the adequacy of the notice or the 
conduct of the hearing. See 42 U.S.C. § 11112(b)(2), (3)."
47,33," Dr. Bakare argues that HCQIA immunity is inappropriate because MEC allegedly failed to follow the procedures set forth in the 
Medical Staff Bylaws (e.g., MEC did not provide Dr. Bakare with the expert's report before taking the corrective action on August 
27, 2002). The court need not determine whether MEC followed the Bylaws. HCQIA immunity attaches when the reviewing body 
satisfies the requirements under HCQIA, regardless of its own policies and procedures. The evidence of record reveals that Dr. 
Bakare has not overcome the presumption that MEC provided adequate due process within the ambit of HCQIA."
47,34," The court's discussion regarding § 11112(a)(1)--reasonable belief that the action furthered quality health care--also supports 
this conclusion regarding § 11112(a)(4). See supra Part III.A.1. "
48,35," In light of this finding that defendants are immune from money damages under HCQIA, it is unnecessary for the court to 
address the issue of immunity under the Pennsylvania Peer Review Protection Act."
48,36," The court notes that, regardless of whether HCQIA immunity applies, Dr. Bakare waived his defamation claim against Dr. 
Kellis. During oral argument on the motions for summary judgment, Dr. Bakare abandoned this claim with respect to the letters 
that Dr. Kellis sent to two nurse midwives. See Jordan v. Stanziola, 96 F. App'x 839, 841 n.2 (3d Cir. 2004) (stating that a party 
had abandoned a claim when ""counsel explicitly abandoned that claim at oral argument""); see also FED. R. CIV. P. 56(d). In 
addition, the court notes that Dr. Bakare did not oppose Dr. Kellis's motion for summary judgment with respect to Dr. Kellis's 
statements to MEC and FHC. See D'Angio v. Borough of Nescopeck, 34 F. Supp. 2d 256, 265 (M.D. Pa. 1999) (providing that 
the non-moving party waived any argument when he failed to address it in a responsive brief); see also L.R. 7.6. Accordingly, 
the court will grant summary judgment in favor of Dr. Kellis on the defamation claim without further discussion."
48,37," See infra Parts III.B, III.C, III.E.1."
48,38," Dr. Bakare claims violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. Section 1 provides that HN15[
] ""[e]very contract, 
combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with 
foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."" 15 U.S.C. § 1. Section 2 provides that HN16[
] ""[e]very person who shall monopolize, 
or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or 
commerce among the several States . . . shall be deemed guilty of [antitrust violations]."" Id. § 2."
48,39," During oral argument on the motions for summary judgment, counsel for Dr. Bakare indicated that plaintiff does not intend to 
pursue any antitrust claims against Dr. Bronitsky. See Jordan v. Stanziola, 96 F. App'x 839, 841 n.2 (3d Cir. 2004) (stating that a 
party had abandoned a claim when ""counsel explicitly abandoned that claim at oral argument""); see also FED. R. CIV. P. 56(d). 
Accordingly, the court will grant summary judgment in favor of Dr. Bronitsky on the antitrust claims without further discussion. "
49,40, See supra note 24.
49,41," Dr. Bakare argues that he also ""has standing to seek redress for the harm to competition that would have resulted if Pinnacle's 
plans to combine the clinics had succeeded"" because the combination allegedly would have resulted in the ""diminution of the 
quality of care and choices of physicians."" (Doc. 158 at 6 (emphasis added)). The court is unpersuaded. First, Section 4 of the 
Clayton Act requires actual injury to the plaintiff seeking damages. See 15 U.S.C. § 15 (""[A]ny person who shall be injured in his 
business or property . . . shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained . . . ."" (emphasis added)); see also ABA 
SECTION OF ANTITRUST LAW, ANTITRUST LAW DEVELOPMENTS 839-41 (5th ed. 2002) (""All plaintiffs seeking damages 
under Section 4 must first establish the existence of 'injury' to themselves, also referred to as 'impact' or 'fact of damage.'""). 
Moreover, the cases cited by Dr. Bakare for this argument are easily distinguishable from the instant case. They involve either 
(1) an existing, not potential, agreement between hospitals and an anesthesiology group, (2) a request only for injunctive relief, 
as opposed to damages, or (3) harm to competition that had allegedly already occurred (i.e., not potential harm). See Morales-
Villalobos v. Garcia-Llorens, 316 F.3d 51 (1st Cir. 2003); Community Publrs. v. DR Partners, 139 F.3d 1180 (8th Cir. 1998); 
Doctor's Hosp. v. Southeastern Medical Alliance, 123 F.3d 301 (5th Cir. 1997)."
49,42," Notably, Dr. Kellis's report to MEC did not recommend an immediate, precautionary suspension of Dr. Bakare."
49,43, See supra Part III.A. 
50,44," Dr. Bakare also argues that the exclusive emergency room coverage proposal and Hamilton's desire to increase market share 
demonstrate that his removal from the market would facilitate the proposed combination. (See Doc. 178 at 4-6.) These 
arguments are unpersuasive. The evidence cited by Dr. Bakare is merely indicative of the existence of merger discussions. It 
does not establish a causal connection between these discussions and Dr. Bakare's precautionary suspension."
50,45," Dr. Bakare attempts to connect the merger discussions with his suspension based upon a meeting between Pinnacle 
physicians, including Dr. Kellis, and Hamilton's midwife during which the parties discussed staffing. (See Doc. 178 at 2-4.) This 
purported evidence of a causal link is unavailing because the discussion involved the number of physicians necessary for the 
combined clinic, not the names of the physicians. (Doc. 178, Ex. A at 24-25.) Although Hamilton's midwife ostensibly understood 
that only the Pinnacle physicians would be included in a combined clinic (see Doc. 178, Ex. A at 25-26), this evidence, even if 
admissible at trial, does not support Dr. Bakare's contention that he was suspended to facilitate the proposed combination. The 
discussion involved only Pinnacle physicians. Hamilton physicians, who would have made the staffing decisions, did not 
participate. Moreover, there is no indication that Dr. Bakare's individual status was even discussed, let alone affected this 
preliminary personnel planning."
50,46," In his second amended complaint, Dr. Bakare raises tortious interference with contract claims regarding two distinct contracts-
-one with Pinnacle and one with Hamilton. (Doc. 36 PP 144-48.) Dr. Bakare concedes that the tortious interference with contract 
claim relating to Pinnacle is without merit. (See Doc. 158 at 18-19.) Accordingly, the court will grant summary judgment in favor 
of defendants on this claim. In his brief in opposition to defendants' motion for summary judgment, Dr. Bakare raised a new 
tortious interference with contract claim relating to a contract with the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing. (See Doc. 
112 at 63-64.) The court will not permit Dr. Bakare to raise a new claim in the context of an opposition brief. See, e.g., Laurie v. 
AMTRAK, 105 F. Appx. 387, 392-93 (3d Cir. 2004) (discussing cases that did not allow new claims raised in opposition to a 
motion for summary judgment). The court previously denied Dr. Bakare's motion for leave to file a third amended complaint (see 
Doc. 81), which attempted to add this new tortious interference with contract claim (see Doc. 66, Ex. PP 131-33). Moreover, 
even if the court had permitted the addition of a tortious interference claim, summary judgment would nevertheless be 
appropriate. Pinnacle was a party to the subject contract with the University of Pennsylvania (Doc. 112 at 63; see also Doc. 36 P 
82), and HN18[
] it is axiomatic that a party cannot tortiously interfere with its own contract. See Rutherfoord v. Presbyterian- Univ. Hosp., 417 Pa. Super. 316, 612 A.2d 500, 507-08 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1992). Accordingly, Dr. Bakare's only potential claim for 
tortious interference with contract involves the Hamilton contract. "
51,47," Dr. Bakare also claims that defendants tortiously interfered with his Hamilton contract by suspending his privileges. However, 
HCQIA immunizes defendants from this claim, which arises out of MEC's professional review action. See supra Part III.A.5. Dr. 
Bakare also appears to base this claim on the alleged ""concerted action between Hamilton and Pinnacle to remove [him] from 
the relevant market."" (Doc. 112 at 61.) As discussed supra, however, Dr. Bakare proffers no evidence that Hamilton or Pinnacle 
discussed his specific employment status when negotiating the proposed Pinnacle-Hamilton combination. See supra Part III.B. 
Hence, Dr. Bakare's unsupported speculation that Hamilton and Pinnacle conspired to remove him from the market cannot 
withstand summary judgment."
51,48," See 49 PA. CODE § 18.5(a) (""A midwife may not engage in midwifery practice without having entered into a collaborative 
agreement""); id. § 18.1 (""Collaborative agreement--A signed written agreement between a midwife and a collaborating physician 
. . . .""); id. (""Collaborating physician--A medical or osteopathic medical doctor who has hospital privileges in obstetrics, "
52,," gynecology or pediatrics . . . ."" (emphasis added)). Surprisingly, Dr. Bakare denies defendants' assertion that he could not 
supervise Hamilton's midwife during his precautionary suspension. (Doc. 113 P 193; Doc. 103 P 193.) In support of this denial, 
Dr. Bakare simply indicates that other arrangements had been made for supervision of the midwife. (Doc. 113 P 193.) This is a 
transparent deflection, not a properly supported denial."
52,49," Under HCQIA, Pinnacle Health Hospitals--the only defendant named in Dr. Bakare's breach of contract claim--is immune with 
respect to the alleged breach of the Medical Staff Bylaws as this claim arises out of the professional review action. See supra 
Part III.A.5."
52,50," Dr. Bakare points to a provision of the Medical Staff Bylaws, which states that each member of the medical staff will ""[a]ssist 
the Hospital in fulfilling its responsibilities for providing emergency and charitable care."" (Doc. 113, Ex. 16 art. II, § 6(B)), for the 
proposition that he had an express agreement to perform moonlighting. This provision, however, simply describes Dr. Bakare's 
duties and responsibilities as a member of the medical staff. It does not contain any specific terms that would obligate Pinnacle 
to assign him to the on-call list."
52,51," Dr. Bakare attempted to add this claim in a third amended complaint. (See Doc. 66, Ex. P 124.a.) However, the court denied 
Dr. Bakare's motion for leave to file a third amended complaint. (See Doc. 81.) "
53,52," Dr. Bakare alleges that the breaches occurred when: (1) Dr. Moore communicated the existence and substance of MEC 
proceedings to nurses in the operating room lounge, (2) Dr. Longenderfer told Hamilton's CEO that Dr. Bakare could no longer 
supervise Hamilton's midwife and that Hamilton would need to identify a new supervisor, and (3) Dr. Kellis wrote letters to two 
midwives informing them that Dr. Bakare no longer had privileges at Pinnacle Health Hospitals and that they would need to 
make arrangements with a new supervising physician."
53,53," Dr. Bakare offers no cases, and the court finds none, that establish an implied confidentiality term under Pennsylvania 
common law. Notably, Pennsylvania law governing the content of medical staff bylaws--the contract between a hospital and its 
physicians--does not require a confidentiality term. See 28 PA. CODE § 107.12."
53,54," Dr. Bakare also argues that the Pennsylvania Peer Review Protection Act mandates confidentiality. See 63 PA. STAT. ANN. § 
425.4 (""The proceedings and records of a review committee shall be held in confidence and shall not be subject to discovery or 
introduction into evidence in any civil action . . . .""). It is undisputed, however, that HN24[
] this state statute does not confer a 
private cause of action. The statute ""seeks to foster the greatest candor and frank discussion at medical review committee 
meetings. . . . [T]hrough grants of immunity and confidentiality the state hopes to encourage peer evaluation of health care 
provided so as to (1) improve the quality of care rendered; (2) reduce morbidity and mortality; and (3) keep within reasonable 
bounds the costs of health care."" McClellan v. HMO, 546 Pa. 463, 686 A.2d 801, 805 (Pa. 1996). In other words, the Act is 
designed to safeguard the peer review process, and not to provide a private right of action to the physician under review. "
54,55, See supra note 48. 
55,56," Dr. Moore also argues that his communication was conditionally privileged. This privilege argument, however, is based upon 
Dr. Moore's disputed account of the communication with the nurses. A jury must resolve this factual dispute regarding the nature 
and extent of Dr. Moore's communication."
55,57," When the court ordered supplemental briefing on Dr. Bakare's defamation claim against Dr. Moore, it directed the parties to 
address whether causation was an appropriate issue for summary disposition. (See Doc. 177 n.1.) In light of the disputed facts 
surrounding this claim, the court considers this issue to be moot."
55,58," Dr. Bakare's defamation claim against Pinnacle Health Hospitals and Pinnacle Health System is based on vicarious liability. 
These defendants do not dispute that Dr. Moore was an employee or was acting withing the scope of his employment. 
Therefore, the court will also deny summary judgment on the defamation claim against Pinnacle Health Hospitals and Pinnacle 
Health System."
55,59," By granting immunity under the Health Care Quality Improvement Act, it is unnecessary for the court to address the issue of 
immunity under the Pennsylvania Peer Review Protection Act. "
56,1," The deadline for filing motions in limine with supporting briefs is Tuesday, September 5, 2006. (See Doc. 186.) "
62,1," Class counsel includes the Arizona firms of Shughart Thomson & Kilroy, Bonnett, Fairbourn, Friedman & Balint and the Irvine

request that Microsoft be required to pay that firm additional money for Arizona class counsel's use of that firm's database."
63,4," In Arizona, a number of actions were filed, including Friedman v. Microsoft and Lucero v. Microsoft. These class actions were 
consolidated into one class action by order."

""equitable doctrine under which a court reforms a written instrument with a gift to charity as closely to the donor's intention as 
possible, so that the gift does not fail . . .. It is also used to distribute unclaimed portions of a class-action judgment or settlement 
funds to a charity that will advance the interests of the class."" Id. In the context of a class action settlement agreement, when it is "
64,," not feasible to distribute the class recovery or when there is a balance that remains after distribution, the court may direct 
""undistributed funds to be applied prospectively to the indirect benefit of the class."" 3 Alba Conte & Herbert Newberg, Newberg 
on Class Actions ' 10.17 (4th ed. 2005) (""Newberg""). These funds are usually distributed to a third party for a specified purpose. 
Id. "
65,8," Thus, Microsoft began and concluded its arguments by stating that the risk of nonpayment did not justify the multiplier 
advanced by class counsel and that only a 1.5 multiplier was appropriate based on risk and certainly no multiplier above 2.3 was 
appropriate. Between that beginning and conclusion, Microsoft argued that other factors, such as skill, difficulty, and results of 
the litigation did not support a multiplier. "
67,9," Both parties cite to various unreported judicial decisions to support their arguments. We HN7[
] decline to rely on those decisions. See Ariz. R. Civ. App. Proc. 28(a)(2). "
68,10," None of the other cases relied upon by Microsoft urge a conclusion that enhancement is rarely applied in common fund cases. 
See generally, Fischel, id. (discussing the general proposition that enhancement is rare); Kadish v. Ariz. State Land Dep't, 177 
Ariz. 322, 333, 868 P.2d 335, 346 (App. 1993) (applying the private attorney general doctrine); Timmons v. City of Tucson, 171 
Ariz. 350, 357, 830 P.2d 871, 878 (App. 1991) (applying statutory fee shifting doctrine); London v. Green Acres Trust, 159 Ariz. 
136, 148, 765 P.2d 538, 550 (App. 1988) (applying the ""bad faith"" exception). "
69,11," Thus, while Microsoft argues that the lodestar should not be enhanced because this is a ""tag-along"" or ""coattail"" action to the 
federal action against Microsoft, there were distinct differences between this action and the federal lawsuit. "
70,12," Microsoft does not contend the superior court should have used a percentage of recovery theory to award attorneys' fees. 
HN17[
] When there is no true common fund created, a lodestar rather than a percentage of recovery is the means to 
determine the appropriate fee. Weinberger v. Great N. Nekoosa Corp., 925 F.2d 518, 526 n.10 (1st Cir. 1991)."
70,13," The reason for such cross-checking is related to the history of attorneys' fees awards in common fund cases. Initially, such 
awards were based upon a percentage of recovery. Use of the percentage method led to abuse and courts began to turn to use 
of a lodestar with possible enhancement by a multiplier based on the contingency or risk involved and the quality of work. Courts 
and commentators soon found problems with the lodestar method, including the burden placed on the courts, manipulation of 
hours and hourly rates and inconsistent decisions. This led to courts applying a reasonable percentage method, setting a 
benchmark percentage (usually between 20 percent to 30 percent of the settlement) or using lodestar as a cross-check. Pacold

Ladewig, 204 Ariz. at 355, 63 P.3d at 1092."
70,14," Microsoft takes issue with the superior court's failure to articulate why it chose to apply a multiplier at all. We find this issue to 
be waived by the nature of Microsoft's opposition to the fee application. We will not require a trial court to explain an issue, 
whether a multiplier should be used at all, that was not in dispute before it. Moreover, for the reasons stated above, we believe 
the superior court adequately explained the reason it decided to apply a multiplier. "
71,15," For instance, the billing rate submitted by a named partner for California Class Counsel was $ 650 per hour and an estimated 
prevailing rate for the same level partner in Phoenix was $ 350 per hour."
71,16," Those rates ranged from $ 115 to $ 400 per hour with the exception of three highly experienced attorneys whose rates were $ 
460 per hour. Those three attorneys had between 32 and 39 years of experience each. Of the other Phoenix attorneys, only five 
had billing rates exceeding $ 350 per hour and each had no less than 23 years of experience."
71,17, The billing rate requested by Schiffer and Jann was $ 295 per hour while Wulkan's requested rate was $ 225 per hour. 
72,18," The expert opinion provided by Class Counsel is not as analytical as the expert opinion provided by Microsoft. However, we 
cannot say that there was no evidence supporting the superior court's decision on rates. Therefore, there is no abuse of 
discretion. "
99,1," Defendant Van Wagner Communications (""Van Wagner"") was named in the caption of the complaint and amended complaint, 
but no allegations were made as to the company. According to plaintiff's prior counsel, a stipulation was executed on June 8, "
100,2004," dismissing Van Wagner from this action, but no such stipulation has been filed in the Court's docket  [*3] to date. (See 
Doc. No. 16, Letter from Mayne Miller, Esq. to Magistrate Judge Robert Levy, dated June 8, 2004.) Given the lack of allegations 
against Van Wagner, the statements of plaintiff's counsel that Van Wagner should be dismissed, and the clerical oversight in not 
filing an executed stipulation of dismissal, the Court respectfully recommends that the action be dismissed against Van Wagner."
100,2," The proliferation of payphones owned by independent providers was due, in part, to the development of computer boards 
installed in the payphones which, among other things, allowed the independent providers to remotely monitor the operation of 
their phones. (Am. Compl. ¶ 20.) "
101,3," By endorsed order dated December 2, 2004, the Court allowed the City defendants to adopt by reference the following 
materials submitted by the City for a pending motion to dismiss in the related case, New Phone Co., Inc. v. City of New York, 00-
cv-2007 (JG): Debra Samuelson's Declaration dated May 14, 2004, with Exhibit Volumes I - III. As discussed more extensively 
on pages 14-16, infra, only those documents clearly relating to or referencing the allegations in the amended complaint will be 
considered for purposes of deciding these motions. "

109,5," HN27[
] The Eleventh Circuit in Bellsouth and the Sixth Circuit in TCG Detroit found an implied private right of action (i.e., by deciding whether a company could bring an action in Federal District Court, or whether the Federal Communications 
Commission has exclusive jurisdiction over TCA § 253), but did not address whether plaintiffs had a private right of action 
enforceable under section 1983. See Bellsouth, 252 F.3d at 1191; TCG Detroit, 206 F.3d at 624. However, subsequently, the 
Supreme Court specifically rejected the notion that the implied right of action cases ""permit anything short of an unambiguously 
conferred right to support a cause of action .  [*36] . . under § 1983."" Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283. The Supreme Court noted that, 
in determining whether a private right of action can be implied from a particular statute or whether a statutory violation may be 
enforced through section 1983, the court must ""first determine whether Congress intended to create a federal right."" Id.; see also 
NextG Networks of New York, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25063, 2004 WL 2884208, at *8 n.11. "
111,6," In Gonzaga, the Supreme Court discussed several statutes that unambiguously created individual rights. The Court noted, for 
example, that Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 created a private right of action through its ""unmistakable focus on 
the benefited class."" 536 U.S. at 284. That statute provides: ""No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be 
excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or 
activity receiving Federal financial assistance. . . ."" 20 U.S.C. 1681(a). This type of ""rights-creating"" language  [*41] is not 
present in either sections 253 or 276 of the TCA."
111,7," The Supreme Court, in City of Rancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, 544 U.S. 113, 125 S. Ct. 1453, 161 L. Ed. 2d 316 (2005), 
recently held that an individual could not enforce TCA § 332(c)(7), limiting local zoning of wireless communications facilities, 
through  [*43] an action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Unlike the TCA provisions at issue here, in Abrams, section 
332(c)(7)(B)(v) of the TCA explicitly provided a cause of action to an aggrieved individual as follows: ""Any person adversely 
affected by any final action or failure to act by a State or local government or any instrumentality thereof that is inconsistent with 
this subparagraph may, within 30 days after such action or failure to act, commence an action in any court of competent 
jurisdiction."" 47 U.S.C. § 332(c)(7)(B)(v). The Court held that ""the TCA — by providing a judicial remedy different from § 1983 in 
§ 332(c)(7) itself — precluded resort to § 1983."" Id. at 126. Also unlike the present case, in Abrams, the City conceded, and no 
party disputed, that section 332(c)(7) created individually enforceable rights. Thus, the Supreme Court assumed, arguendo, that 
to be so. 544 U.S. at 120. Because this Court has determined in the instant case that sections 253 and 276 of the TCA do not 
explicitly create a private right enforceable through 42 U.S.C. § 1983, nor provide an individual judicial remedy, the Abrams 
analysis is not applicable here. The Abrams holding is limited to TCA § 332, entitled  [*44] ""Mobile Services,"" which does not 
appear interchangeable with, or comparable to, TCA §§ 253 and 276. See NextG Networks of New York, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
25063, 2004 WL 2884308, at *4 n. 8 (citing cases). However, while Abrams is not controlling here, HN36[
] it does indicate the Supreme Court's unwillingness to find a private right of action and a claim for section 1983 monetary damages, where Congress 
did not unequivocally express its intention to provide such relief. See Paul Glist et al., Telecommunications ""Franchising,"" 818 
PLI /Pat 589, 593 (Feb.-Mar. 2005) (""[W]hile [Abrams] is not specifically addressing Section 253, the outcome of the Supreme 
Court's review will clearly affect the analysis of Section 1983 damages claims for violations of Section 253.""). "
112,8," This determination  [*45] does not preclude a plaintiff from seeking to enjoin the enforcement of a state or local regulation on 
the grounds that the regulation is preempted by federal law pursuant to the Supremacy Clause, if the claims are not otherwise 
barred by the statute of limitations or res judicata. See Western Air Lines Inc. v. Port Auth., 817 F.2d 222, 225-26 (2d Cir. 1987). "
113,9," The City does not argue that these claims are barred by virtue of the doctrine derived from District of Columbia Court of 
Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462, 103 S. Ct. 1303, 75 L. Ed. 2d 206 (1983), and Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413, 44 
S. Ct. 149, 68 L. Ed. 362 (1923). HN41[
] Pursuant to the so-called Rooker-Feldman doctrine, a federal court lacks subject 
matter jurisdiction over any claim that is so ""inextricably intertwined"" with a state claim that the federal court would effectively be 
forced to review a state court determination. See Johnson v. Smithsonian Inst., 189 F.3d 180, 185 (2d Cir. 1999); 
 [*52] Hachamovitch v. DeBuono, 159 F.3d 687, 693-694 (2d Cir. 1998). Because, in any event, resolution of any Rooker-
Feldman issue would depend on application of preclusion law, the Court finds it unnecessary to determine whether it lacks 
jurisdiction over plaintiff's claims under Rooker-Feldman. See Moccio v. New York State Office of Court Admin., 95 F.3d 195, 
199-200 (2d Cir. 1996) (HN42[
] interpreting ""inextricably intertwined"" to mean, ""at a minimum,"" that where a plaintiff's claim would be barred under preclusion principles, it will be barred under Rooker-Feldman); see also Karamoko v. New York City 
Hous. Auth., 170 F. Supp. 2d 372, 376 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 30, 2001). "
114,10," In support of their motions, defendants have provided copies of various documents relating to Best's article 78 proceeding, 
including the article 78 petition. (See Horowitz Decl., Ex. F.) The Court finds it appropriate to refer to these documents and other 
public documents in order to determine whether plaintiff's claims are barred by the prior proceeding. See Karamoko, 170 F. 
Supp. 2d at 375 n.1 (HN47[
] ""'it is proper to consider public documents on a motion to dismiss to determine whether claims 
are barred by prior litigation'"") (quoting Bal v. New York City Loft Bd., No. 00 Civ. 1112, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9179, 2000 WL 
890199, at *5-6 (S.D.N.Y. June 23, 2000)). "
116,11," Indeed, at oral argument before the undersigned, the City conceded that plaintiff's antitrust claims are not barred by res 
judicata. (Doc. No. 64, Transcript of Civil Cause for Oral Argument, held on Apr. 11, 2005 (""Tr.""), at 52.) Additionally, it should also be noted that the more narrowly defined doctrine of collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, does not 
apply to plaintiff's claims for damages. HN50[
] Issue preclusion only applies where: ""(1) the issue in question  [*62] was 
actually and necessarily decided in a prior proceeding; and (2) the party against whom the doctrine is asserted had a full and fair 
opportunity to litigate the issue in the first proceeding."" Hachamovitch, 159 F.3d at 695 (quoting Colon v. Coughlin, 58 F.3d 865, 
869 (2d Cir. 1995)). Here, the prior article 78 proceeding was dismissed on statute of limitations grounds, and is considered to 
be an adjudication ""on the merits,"" however, it cannot be said that the issues underlying plaintiff's claims for damages were 
""actually and necessarily decided in the prior proceeding."" See Karamoko, 170 F. Supp. 2d at 378-379; Cepeda v. Coughlin, 785 
F. Supp. 385, 390 (S.D.N.Y. 1992); see also Stone v. Williams, 970 F.2d 1043, 1054 (2d Cir. 1992) (clarifying the ""functional 
difference"" between the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel)."
116,12," Quoting Hachamovitch, 159 F.3d at 695, plaintiff asserts that its claims are not subject to dismissal on res judicata grounds 
because HN53[
] ""[a] petitioner may not challenge the validity of a legislative act or regulation in an [a]rticle 78 proceeding."" 
(Pl.'s Mem in Opp. to the City's Motion to Dismiss, at 8.) Here, however, plaintiff does not challenge the validity or 
constitutionality of any legislation. Rather, it challenges the manner of DoITT's implementation of Local Law 68 and 67 RCNY. 
 [*64] Specifically, plaintiff seeks to enjoin the City from ""enforcing the provisions of Local Law 68, the rules promulgated 
pursuant to said law 67 RCNY, and the Franchise Agreement in a manner that is discriminatory as between Verizon and IPPs, 
including plaintiff."" (Compl., at Wherefore Clause.) Thus, as stated above, the injunctive relief sought here by plaintiff is the type 
of relief available in an article 78 proceeding. "
117,13," Verizon is a ""successor in interest to Bell Atlantic."" (Am. Compl. ¶ 10.) "
118,14," Although the City did not brief these issues, in its memorandum of law in support of the motion to dismiss, the City notes that it 
""adopt[s] the arguments set forth in defendant Verizon's brief in support of its motion to dismiss."" (The City's Mem. of Law in 
 [*71] Support, at 35; see also Tr. at 22.) The City further asserts that it is ""immune from damage claims under the antitrust laws 
pursuant to Local Government Act, 15 U.S.C. § 35."" (The City's Mem. of Law in Support, at 35.) "
119,15," Plaintiff's argument that the City was acting pursuant to N.Y. Public Service Law § 90 is untenable. HN59[
] Pursuant to section 90, the state, through the Public Service Commission (""PSC""), regulates only utility-related activities of phone 
corporations. See 103 N.Y. Jur. 2d Telecommunications § 27 (2d ed. 2005). Plaintiff's antitrust claims are based on alleged 
discrimination in the advertising market, rather than the telecommunications market. (Am. Compl. ¶ 101.) Non-utility related "
120,," activities, such as advertising, do not fall within the PSC's jurisdiction. See F.H. Von Damm, Inc. v. New York Tel. Co., 60 Misc. 
2d 677, 303 N.Y.S. 2d 763 (N.Y. City Civ. Ct. 1969). "
123,16," HN72[
] There is no ""state-action exception"" to the Donnelly Act. Electrical Inspectors, 320 F.3d at 123 n.7. "
125,17," In any event, plaintiff's claims for monetary damages and injunctive relief under sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act are not 
viable, because plaintiff has failed to allege any antitrust injury under the Sherman Act. "
132,1," In addition to St. Elizabeth Hospital, the Complaint names, inter alia, the department chair at St. Elizabeth Hospital, Maureen 
Mahar-Matthews, M.D., and the healthcare system operating St. Elizabeth Hospital, Humility of Mary Health Partners and 
Catholic Healthcare Partners (collectively, the ""St. Elizabeth Defendants"") as defendants."
132,2," The Court shall refer to defendants Pearlstein, Babyak, Wood, Potesta, and Fifth Avenue Otolaryngology Inc. collectively as the 
""Fifth Avenue Defendants."""
132,3," The term ""Defendants,"" as used in this memorandum opinion, refers to all defendants--the St. Elizabeth Defendants and the 
Fifth Avenue Defendants collectively. "
135,4, The Complaint fails to specify what the immediate market area encompasses. 
144,1," Plaintiff, for the first time in its third brief, advances an additional reason why its second lawsuit should not be precluded. 
Docket Document No. 22. It asserts that Ramallo I focused on the legality of Defendants' printing policy regarding corporate 
supplements, but the supplement that is the focus of the current lawsuit is not technically a corporate supplement at all as it 
more closely resembles a regular shopper insert. Id. The court will not consider this argument because Plaintiff's complaint, 
which was supplemented twice, and its previous two briefs, clearly state that this case is about corporate supplements, and 
Plaintiff cannot, at the eleventh hour, recharacterize its supplement as a different type of insert. See Docket Document Nos. 1, 
11, 15-17. "
146,2," The First Circuit has stated that it is somewhat hesitant to apply res judicata to cases involving ongoing wrongful conduct. See 
Pignons S.A. de Mecanique v. Polaroid Corp., 701 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1983) (noting ambiguity surrounding the application of res 
judicata to situations of continuous wrongful conduct, and preferring instead to apply collateral estoppel). "
147,3," See McLaughlin v. Bradlee, 602 F. Supp. 1412, 1417 (D.D.C. 1985) (""It is especially appropriate to impose sanctions in 
situation's where the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel plainly preclude relitigation of the suit.""). "
155,1," As explained in Analysis, II. Legal Standard of this opinion, this pleading is also treated as a motion for summary judgment. "
156,2," Despite Plaintiff's caption, he makes no claim for injunctive relief in his motion, therefore, his motion for injunctive relief is 
denied herein without additional discussion. (See Doc. No. 146)."
156,3," The parties failed to submit proposed statements of Material Facts Not in Dispute in compliance with Local Rule 56.1, 
therefore, the Court assessed the record and determined the relevant material facts. "
157,4," On or about December 22, 2003, the Honorable Thomas A. Swope, Jr., of the Court of Common Pleas of Cambria County, 
entered an Order of Court sustaining Defendants' Preliminary Objections which dismissed Plaintiff's Complaint in Equity with 
Prejudice. (Doc. 142, Ex. G - Order Sustaining Defendant's Preliminary Objections Case No. 2000-646). "
158,5," Dr. George Benz was recommended by Dr. Marshall Webster, a prominent surgeon at UPMC Presbyterian Hospital. (Doc. No. 
155, Ex. A., p. 8). Dr. Benz graduated from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in 1967, did his internship and 
residency at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Department of Surgery and was Board certified in general surgery. 
(Doc. No. 155, Ex. A., p. 8). He had been an assistant professor of Clinical Surgery at the University of Pittsburgh in the Surgical 
Department since 1975. (Doc. No. 155, Ex. A., p. 8). Dr. Benz retired in July of 2001, but maintained his medical license and 
remained Board certified in general surgery since 1973. (Doc. No. 155, Ex. A., p. 8). He had been on the staffs of Presbyterian 
University Hospital, Montefiore Hospital, and Forbes Health Systems since 1975. (Doc. No. 155, Ex. A., p. 8). Forbes Regional Hospital is located in Monroeville, Pennsylvania, has 300 beds and approximately 20 to 25 surgeons on staff. 
(Doc. No. 155, Ex. A., p. 8). Dr. Benz was the Chief of the Section of General Surgery for seven years at Forbes, was on the 
Medical Executive Committee for 20 years and was the Coordinator of Surgical Teaching at the Forbes Family Practice Program 
from 1978 to 1995. (Doc. No. 155, Ex. A., p. 8). He was Chairman of the Operating Room Committee from 1987 to 1992 and 
Chairman of the Department of Surgery from 1990 to 1998. (Doc. No. 155, Ex. A., p. 8). He was also President of the Medical 
Staff from 1986 to 1987. (Doc. No. 155, Ex. A., p. 8). He had been involved in the prior review of surgeons including a protracted 
review of a surgeon in Meadville, Pennsylvania, where he scrubbed with the doctor to observe the surgical techniques and he 
also monitored other surgeons at Forbes in his role as Chief of Surgery and has extensive peer review experience. (Doc. No. 
155, Ex. A., p. 8-9). Additionally, he was involved in at least five or six reviews of surgeons at Forbes. (Doc. No. 155, Ex. A., p. 
9). "
159,6," Preliminary Objections were sustained by Judge Swope in Untracht II on December 22, 2003, which dismissed the various 
Counts against the various defendants with prejudice. (Doc. 142, Ex. G - Order Sustaining Defendants' Preliminary Objections 
Case No. 2001-2718). As noted earlier, Judge Swope also sustained preliminary objections in Untracht I on December 22, 2003. 
See Footnote 3."
159,7," A total of nineteen hearing sessions were held over thirteen and a half months before the Hearing Panel. (Doc. No. 155, Ex. A 
to Ex. B, p. 1). Both Plainiff and Lee were given ample opportunity to present evidence in support of their respective positions. 
(Doc. No. 155, Ex. A to Ex. B, p. 1). The transcript of the hearing record is over 3000 pages long and includes over 200 exhibits. 
(Doc. No. 155, Ex. A, p. 2). "
160,8," The Appellate Review Panel acknowledged that the Hearing Panel had no authority to impose a more stringent sanction on 
Plaintiff, but recognized that the Board did have the ultimate authority to assure the competency of its medical staff and protect 
its patients. (Doc. No. 147, Ex. 15 - Letter from Chairman of Board of Trustees of Lee to Plaintiff dated June 24, 2003, p. 1). 
Therefore, the Review Panel concluded that the evidence against Plaintiff presented during the hearing, much of which post 
dated the original recommendations of the Credentials and Executive Committees, supported a more stringent sanction than had 
originally been recommended. Id. at 2. "
162,9," A court can take judicial notice of distances. See Gordon v. Lewistown Hosp., 272 F. Supp. 2d 393, 429 n. 34 (M.D. Pa. 2003) 
(holding a court can take judicial notice of driving distances disclosed on an internet mapping service). "
164,10," These instances involve Plaintiff's § 1981 claim for reverse national origin discrimination and Plaintiff's 42 U.S.C. § 11112 
claim and are discussed more fully later in this Memorandum Opinion and Order. "
168,11," Although the relevant geographic market was not well defined by the parties, the Court notes that at a bare minimum it 
includes, as Plaintiff asserts, the Johnstown area which encompasses the Windber Hospital located just eight miles from 
Conemaugh and ten miles from Lee. Mapquest, http://www.mapquest.com, (last visited July 27, 2006); See Gordon, 272 
F.Supp.2d at 429 n.34 (holding a court may take judicial notice of driving distances disclosed on an Internet mapping service 
and identifying like facilities within a 36 mile driving distance); see also, e.g., Urdinaran v. Aarons, 115 F.Supp.2d 484, 490 
(D.N.J. 2000) (the relevant geographic market may include Philadelphia, approximately a one hour drive from Atlantic City 
Hospital at which Plaintiff practiced); Korshin v. Benedictine Hosp., 34 F.Supp.2d 133 (N.D.N.Y. 1999) (31 miles) (citing BCP 
Anesthesia Care, Ltd. v. Passavant Memorial Area Hosp. Assoc., 36 F.3d 664 (7th Cir. 1994) (25 miles)). The Court notes that 
when Plaintiff moved to Johnstown he acquired privileges at Lee, Conemaugh and Windber in rapid succession further 
supporting the Court's determination that, at a minimum, these three hospitals are part of the relevant geographic market. (Doc. 
No. 147, Ex. 1 - Pl. Aff. PP 20, 22, 25, 29). The Court notes that this is the narrowest possible relevant geographic market and 
that one could easily argue the relevant geographic market includes surrounding areas such as Greensburg, Indiana, Somerset 
and even Pittsburgh. "
171,12," The Court notes that as discussed in detail in subsection (a) of this section Plaintiff also fails to create a genuine issue of 
material fact regarding concerted action among the Defendants."
171,13," Again, the Court notes that as discussed in detail in subsection (a) of this section Plaintiff also fails to create a genuine issue 
of material fact regarding concerted action among the Defendants. "
173,14," Plaintiff alleges that the § 1983 Defendants acted under color of state law while exercising their peer review responsibility 
pursuant to federal law (HCQIA) and the fourteenth amendment of the United States Constitution. (Doc. No. 133, pp. 20-21, P 
99). Plaintiff argues he was denied free speech, due process and equal protection through the § 1983 Defendants' ""deliberate 
indifference to fundamental Constitutional due process and the HCQIA immunity provisions enumerated at 42 U.S.C. § 
11112(a). Id. at P 100. However, the Court finds that Plaintiff fails to create a genuine issue of material fact that any of the § 
1983 Defendants are state actors and, therefore, does not reach the second element of this claim. "
174,15," The Crissman court expressly limited the reach of Burton v. Wilmington Parking Auth., 365 U.S. 715, 81 S.Ct. 856, 6 L.Ed.2d 
45 (1961), the case that created the symbiotic relationship test. Id. at 725. Noting the Burton involved a privately owned and 
racially segregated restaurant located in a public parking garage, the Third Circuit concluded that the symbiotic relationship was 
""crafted for the unique set of facts presented"" and would not be expanded to apply beyond those facts. Id. at 242, 246. "
177,16," But see Commonwealth v. Downing, 511 Pa. 28, 511 A.2d 792, 794-95 (Pa. 1986) (holding that Temple is a private institution 
despite its designation as part of the Commonwealth system of higher education); Carroll v. Temple Univ., 1994 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 15286, 1994 WL 590615 (E.D. Pa. 1994) (holding Temple's status as a federal depositary library does not transform it 
into a public institution). "
178,17," Although there were doctors on staff at Conemaugh that were clinical professors at Temple, Plaintiff provides no evidence 
showing that their actions related to the peer review at Conemuagh were undertaken in their capacities as clinical professors at 
Temple rather than in their capacities as doctors on staff at Conemaugh. (See Doc. No. 147). "
181,18," Although Plaintiff made a claim under a state whistleblower statute in his Second Amended Complaint, the Court does not 
have jurisdiction over this claim as discussed later in this Memorandum Opinion and Order. (Doc. No. 133)."
181,19," Furthermore, even assuming Plaintiffhad asserted reverse discrimination based on his race rather than his national origin, 
Plaintiff fails to set forth any evidence establishing that any similarly situated doctors were treated differently than himself. (See 
Doc. Nos. 133, 146 and 147). This is required in order to set forth a prima facie case of reverse discrimination. Plaintiff's failure 
to set forth such evidence would result in no genuine issue of material fact existing on a claim for reverse discrimination and, 
therefore, summary judgment in favor of the Defendants would be proper. Iadimarco, 190 F.3d at 163. "
183,20," To the extent Plaintiff might have made any claims against Lee Regional Health Systems, Inc. and Lee Regional Health 
System Foundation, Inc., these two Defendants incorporated the arguments made in Doc. Nos. 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 
142, 151, 154 and 155 into their Motion to Dismiss, therefore, those claims, if any, are dismissed for the same reasons set forth 
in this Memorandum Opinion and Order. "
194,1," Broadcom also alleges that Qualcomm's acquisition of Flarion Technologies (""Flarion"") will substantially lessen competition and 
extend Qualcomm's monopoly. (Am. Compl., at 8, 38.) The Court will discuss the facts and claims related to the Flarion 
acquisition separately, infra. See DISCUSSION II.C. "
199,2," ""Other parties with patents that they have declared as essential to implementing WCDMA includ[e] Nokia, Ericcson, InterDigital, 
and Samsung."" (Am. Compl., at 33.)"
199,3," Broadcom does not allege that it holds patents that were competing to be included in the WCDMA technology standard. 
Broadcom, however, alleges that it needs a license to Qualcomm's patents to manufacture UMTS chipsets. "
200,4," Count 11 of the amended complaint asserts a claim for breach of contract based upon Qualcomm's conduct in dealing with the 
SDO. For the reasons discussed infra, the Court expresses no opinion as to the merits of this claim. "
203,5," The Court, for the purposes of this opinion, will assume that Broadcom has sufficiently alleged that (1) Qualcomm has market 
power in the tying product, the WCDMA technology license, (2) there are separate products, the license and the chipset, and (3) 
the ""arrangement"" affects more than insubstantial amount of interstate commerce. Kodak, 504 U.S. at 462. The Court also recognizes that HN26[
] the Clayton Act is only applicable to exclusive deals or tying arrangements that involve goods or commodities. See 15 U.S.C. § 14. The Court determines that there is no exclusive deal or tie, therefore, the Court need 
not decide whether a patent license is a commodity for purposes of the Clayton Act. The Court expresses no opinion as to the 
issue, but the Court notes that other courts have limited the definition of commodity to a tangible good. See Ungar, 531 F.2d at 
1215 n.4 (noting that the district court determined that a trademark and logo were not goods for the purposes of the Clayton Act, 
but declining to address that decision because the issue was not before the Circuit); Tele Atlas N.V. v. Navteq Corp., 397 
F.Supp.2d 1184, 1193 (N.D. Cal. 2005) (dismissing tying claims brought pursuant to the Clayton Act because a patent license is 
not the sale of a tangible good); Satellite Assoc. v. Cont'l Cablevision of Va., Inc., 586 F.Supp. 973, 975 (E.D. Va. 1982) 
(determining that the Clayton Act does not encompass the sale of services because a commodity is some type of tangible 
property); La Salle St. Press Inc. v. McCormick & Henderson Inc., 293 F.Supp. 1004, 1006 (N.D. Ill. 1968) (""the sale of a patent 
license is the sale of [a] right or privilege . . . [a]s such it does not fall within the . . . family of tangible and movable chattels which 
is covered by the term 'commodity'""). "
207,6," The Court dismisses this claim based on the determination that Broadcom does not allege an antitrust injury sufficient to state a 
Section 7 claim, not based on a determination that Broadcom does not have standing. Qualcomm, in its brief, argues Broadcom 
does not have standing to assert a Section 7 claim because it has not alleged an antitrust injury. (Def. Br., at 41.) The Court 
recognizes that ""the questions of antitrust injury and antitrust standing are difficult to disentangle."" City of Pittsburgh, 147 F.3d at 
265 n.15. ""However in the sense that plaintiffs who sustain no antitrust injury may not recover, they may be loosely said to lack 
standing."" Alberta, 826 F.2d at 1240. The Court, here, determines that Broadcom has not alleged sufficient antitrust injury. The 
Court, therefore, makes no determination as to Broadcom's standing. See Verizon, 540 U.S. at 416 n.5 (dismissing the 
complaint because the defendant's conduct was not anticompetitive for purposes of the Sherman Act, and noting ""[o]ur 
disposition makes it unnecessary to consider petitioner's alternative contention that respondent lacks antitrust standing""); 
Alberta, 826 F.2d at 1240 (noting that once antitrust injury is demonstrated, standing analysis is employed). "
219,1," HN1[
] A horizontal restraint is defined as ""an agreement between competitors at the same level of the market structure to 
allocate territories in order to minimize competition.""United States v. Topco Assocs., Inc., 405 U.S. 596, 608, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 31 
L. Ed. 2d 515 (1972). "
220,2," HN4[
] While motions to dismiss that implicate constitutional standing principles are generally predicated on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has considered motions to dismiss that raise 
issues of antitrust standing under Rule 12(b)(6). Maio v. Aetna, Inc., 221 F.3d 472, 481 n.7 (3d Cir. 2000). "
221,3," Overbuilders are wireline cable providers that install cable systems along the same rights-of-way as the incumbent cable 
franchisee. "
222,4," The authority upon which Comcast relies is inapposite. Comcast, for example, cites West Penn Power, 147 F.3d at 265, for the 
proposition that where a private plaintiff alleges it has suffered injury due to the suppression or elimination of competition via 
horizontal transactions but fails to plead facts establishing the existence of actual or likely future competition between the 
transacting parties in the relevant market, the plaintiff's claims should be dismissed for lack of antitrust standing. InWest Penn 
Power, the plaintiff, the City of Pittsburgh, brought suit against two electric companies seeking damages and an injunction 
precluding the merger of the companies, claiming that the merger would void the possibility of lower-priced electric service 
charged to city residents. The Third Circuit held that the plaintiff's claim did not meet standing requirements because of the 
absence of antitrust injury and a lack of causal connection between the plaintiff's injuries and the alleged harm. Id. The Third 
Circuit agreed with the district court's conclusion that there was no antitrust injury, as the proposed merger had not ""brought 
about the lessening of competition in a 'marketplace' where there was no competition."" Id. at 266-67. West Penn Power is "
223,," distinguishable from the instant case. As the Third Circuit has explained, it arrived at the conclusion in West Penn Power 
because an intervening regulatory scheme precluded the companies from competing, i.e., the merger was not the cause of the 
injury. No significant antitrust injury inquiry was required to reach this conclusion and none was undertaken. We can 
reasonably posit, however, that if not for this regulatory quirk, the City would have been entitled to . . . relief because the 
proposed merger would have eradicated competition, a result prohibited under the Clayton Act, and detrimental to the City's 
electrical customers. In re Warfarin Sodium Antitrust Litig., 214 F.3d 395, 401 (3d Cir. 2000). Unlike West Penn Power, the instant case does not 
involve a regulatory scheme that authorizes territorial monopolies and hence, the ""quirk"" that justified the denial of antitrust 
standing in West Penn Power is not present here. Comcast also relies upon Mathews v. Lancaster Gen. Hosp., 883 F. Supp. 
1016 (E.D. Pa. 1995), aff'd, 87 F.3d 624 (3d Cir. 1996), a case in which the court held that defendants were entitled to summary 
judgment based on the plaintiff's lack of antitrust standing where ""[f]rom the standpoint of the consumer, there has been no 
meaningful change in the market"" as a result of the defendants' conduct. Id.at 1045. Mathews is distinguishable because the 
plaintiff in that case only alleged harm to himself, as a provider of orthopedic services whose privileges had been restricted at 
hospitals, and not harm to competition. Id. In Mathews, the ""undisputed evidence show[ed] that orthopedic services are still 
readily available from a large and ever-increasing number of providers."" Id. "
224,5," Defendants argue in the alternative that Plaintiffs do not have antitrust standing with respect to Comcast's RCN-related conduct 
because they do not live in the counties where RCN operates, and they do not specifically allege that RCN ever competed in 
their counties or applied or intended to apply for franchise licenses covering their counties. Comcast relies upon Brotech Corp, 
2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11552, 2004 WL 1427136, a case in which this Court noted that a competitor who seeks entry to a market 
can state an antitrust injury stemming from the defendant's violation of antitrust laws only if that prospective competitor can 
demonstrate ""'both its intention to enter the market and its preparedness to do so.'"" 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11552, [WL] at *5 
(quoting Andrx Pharms., Inc. v. Biovail Corp. Int'l, 347 U.S. App. D.C. 178, 256 F.3d 799, 806 (D.C. Cir. 2001)). Plaintiffs are not 
competitors of Comcast and the standards that courts impose on competitors to ensure that their injury is not speculative are not 
applicable to the determination of Plaintiffs' antitrust standing. "
225,6," The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Goldwasser explained: [W]e think [the defendant] is wrong to claim that the plaintiffs lack standing because they are attempting to raise third-party 
rights - the rights of the competitors. It is true that the reason the plaintiffs have been injured (allegedly, of course) 
implicates the rights of the competitors not to be excluded from the local markets through anticompetitive actions of [the 
defendant], but that does not make this a jus tertii case. These plaintiffs want lower prices and more choice, and they claim 
that [the defendant] (a monopolist) is doing things to prevent that from happening. Their theory is a classic exclusionary 
acts theory, and in all such cases, the monopolist's alleged sin is the exclusion of other competitors from the market. One 
assumes that those other competitors are grateful for the help from the consumer litigation, but that is incidental. The 
[plaintiffs] do not care in principle which competitors enter their markets; they just want a competitively structured local 
telephone market that will prevent [the defendant] from inflicting antitrust injury on them. We are satisfied that they are 
asserting their own rights, and thus that they have standing. Goldwasser, 222 F.3d at 398-99. "
226,7," Comcast emphasizes that the conduct Plaintiffs challenge under § 1 of the Sherman Act includes Comcast's acquisitions. 
Count One only alleges that Comcast's swap agreements with horizontal competitors constitute per se violations of § 1. (3d Am. 
Compl. P 73.) Count One separately alleges that Comcast's acquisitions of competing cable companies and their cable 
subscribers in the Philadelphia and Chicago clusters constitute contracts and conduct in restraint of trade in violation of § 1 
under the applicable rule of reason analysis. (Id. P 74.) Thus, Comcast's assertions that acquisitions hold the promise of 
increasing a firm's efficiency, Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 768, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 
628 (1984), and, thus, are not manifestly anticompetitive business practices are irrelevant to the assessment of whether Count 
One has alleged per se violations of § 1."
226,8," Comcast has submitted excerpts from its swap agreements with AT&T and Adelphia to argue that, irrespective of the specificity 
of Count One's allegations, we should find as a matter of law that none of the swap agreements amount to horizontal market 
allocations. (James T. Cain Decl. Ex. A(7), A(8).) According to Comcast, the excerpts demonstrate that the swap agreements did 
not impose restrictions on the ability of any counter party to reenter or compete directly in the affected markets. HN19[
] We 
decline to consider these excerpts on a motion to dismiss, as they go beyond the facts alleged in the Third Amended Complaint 
and do not warrant the exceptions made for documents that are ""integral to or explicitly relied upon in the complaint"" or 
""undisputedly authentic"" and the basis for plaintiffs' claims. In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1426 (3d 
Cir. 1997) (quotation omitted); Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. White Consol. Indus., 998 F.2d 1192, 1196 (3d Cir. 1993). 
Moreover, the excerpts are not sufficient for us to draw conclusions as a matter of law, even with respect to Comcast's 
arrangements with AT&T and Adelphia, because Count One does not necessarily depend upon the presence, or absence, of 
express covenants-not-to-compete. "
228,9," Comcast asserts that ""Plaintiffs' proposed geographic market (a miscellany of 30 counties spread across five states) is an 
arbitrary construct which cannot be explained or justified by reference to (i) the areas in which Plaintiffs allege that Comcast 
faces actual competition from RCN (i.e., Delaware County, Pennsylvania), or (ii) the areas in which Comcast faces actual 
competition for the relevant product (i.e., everywhere in the United States that Comcast offers MVPS)."" (Def. Rep. Mem. at 31.) 
HN26[
] While numerous cases say that for the purposes of § 2 of the Sherman Act, the relevant geographic market is the ""area of effective competition,""see e.g.,Jetro, 569 F. Supp. at 1412, what is meant is the area where the buyer can practicably 
and feasibly turn to make its purchases. Id.; Tunis Bros., 952 F.2d at 726. Plaintiffs need not define the relevant market based 
upon where Comcast competes. See Morgan, Strand, Wheeler & Biggs v. Radiology, Ltd., 924 F.2d 1484, 1490 (9th Cir. 1991) 
(""[A] company may compete in many markets or in only part of a market. Where it competes does not define the market.""). "
229,10," Comcast also argues that Plaintiffs cannot show that its conduct produced anticompetitive effects in the relevant markets as 
required to maintain a § 2 claim. We have found, supra Part III.B, that Count One states a claim under § 1 of the Sherman Act 
with respect to Comcast's alleged horizontal market allocations. That same manifestly anticompetitive conduct also underlies 
Plaintiffs' § 2 claims in Counts Two and Three. Comcast maintains that we should nonetheless dismiss Counts Two and Three to 
the extent that they rely on Comcast's other conduct, namely Comcast's acquisitions of competing cable companies and 
Comcast's treatment of RCN. We will not, at this stage, take such a piecemeal approach to Counts Two and Three. See 
LePage's Inc. v. 3M, 324 F.3d 141, 162 (3d Cir. 2003) (HN28[
] ""The relevant inquiry is the anticompetitive effect of 
[defendant's] exclusionary practices considered together.""). Moreover, Comcast's contention that its acquisitions cannot be 
considered anticompetitive unless they involved overbuilders clearly implicates questions of fact regarding, for example, the 
sources of competition in the relevant product market."
229,11," The TCI acquisition was made by AT&T. The Third Amended Complaint alleges that, as part of the merger between AT&T and 
Comcast, Comcast assumed liability for AT&T's violations of antitrust law. (3d Am. Compl. P 5.) "
236,1, Clear Channel acquired SFX in the year 2000. 
237,2," Mrs. Faris admittedly did not allege sufficient facts or circumstances in her Amended Complaint to put the defendants on notice 
of a liability theory based on piercing the corporate veil. The defendants, nonetheless, argued against the possibility (Doc. No. 
48: Memorandum) and Mrs. Faris responded (Doc. No. 62: Memorandum). Accordingly, the Court will address the matter. "
238,3," Even assuming that Mrs. Faris could establish excessive control, she has not alleged that Clear Channel exerted such control 
over SFX for the purpose of committing fraud, a dishonest, unjust or any type of act that satisfies the second prong of the 
instrumentality test. See Id. "
239,4," Ms. Austin also testified to another electrical hazard involving people receiving shocks from a hand rail and door handle leading 
up to a trailer, but she did not personally receive a shock, nor report this hazard to anyone."
239,5," ""[Q]ue major vis est animi quam corporis, hoc sunt graviora ea quae concipiuntur animo quam illa quae corpore."" ""For, as the 
power of the mind is greater than that of the body, in the same way the sufferings of the mind are more severe than the pains of 
the body."" M. Tullius Cicero, Orations, The Fourteen Orations Against Marcus Antonius (Philippics), 11.4, (cited by both Young 
v. Western Union Tel. Co., 107 N.C. 370, 11 S.E. 1044, 1048-49 (N.C. 1890) and Johnson v. Ruark Obstetrics & Gynecology 
Assoc., P.A., 327 N.C. 283, 395 S.E.2d 85, 90 (N.C. 1990)). "
240,6," Compare Johnson, 395 S.E.2d at 98 (finding foreseeability found where the plaintiff parents were in close proximity to and 
personally observed the defendant's actions surrounding the death of their baby and its stillbirth), with Andersen v. Baccus, 335 
N.C. 526, 439 S.E.2d 136 (N.C. 1994) (finding no foreseeability where the plaintiff arrived at the scene of a car accident shortly 
after it occurred and only witnessed his pregnant wife's rescue from the wreckage)."
240,7," Also compare Gardner, 435 S.E.2d at 328 (""[t]here is neither allegation nor forecast of evidence that defendant knew plaintiff 
was subject to an emotional or mental disorder or other severe and disabling emotional or mental condition as a result of his 
negligence and its consequence. Absent such knowledge, such an outcome cannot be held to be reasonably foreseeable.""); and 
Butz v. Holder, 113 N.C. App. 156, 437 S.E.2d 672, 674 (N.C. Ct. App. 1993) (finding the parents and brother of a cyclist killed 
through the negligence of a motorists could not establish foreseeability because ""[i]t appears . . . that the Supreme Court has 
held that in any claim for NIED, the plaintiff must allege and through forecast of evidence show that defendant knew that the 
plaintiff was subject to an emotional or mental disorder . . . [in order] to say that the consequences of the alleged tortfeasor's 
negligence were reasonably foreseeable.""); with Johnson, 395 S.E.2d at 98 (court found sufficient foreseeability where the 
defendant doctor knew that the plaintiffs existed, that the plaintiffs were husband and wife, and that the unborn baby was their 
child; and Wrenn, 120 N.C. App. 761, 464 S.E.2d 89 (foreseeability found where an emergency room doctor knew the plaintiff 
was the patient's wife, the plaintiff witnessed her husband being treated in the emergency room, and the plaintiff watched her 
husband's condition deteriorate.). "

249,1," The Wasatch Front refers to Salt Lake, Davis, Weber, Cache, Utah, and western Summit counties."
249,2," For the sake of clarity, we will collectively refer to the IHC-affiliated entities as ""IHC."" We will refer to Drs. Miller and Brodstein 
and their professional corporations as ""defendant opthalmologists."" We will refer to the collective group of defendants--IHC, IHC 
Health Plans, Inc., and IHC Health Services, Inc., and the defendant ophthalmologists--as ""Defendants."" "
250,3," Utah law explicitly permits this practice. See Utah Code Ann. § 31A-8-105(2) (stating that ""organizations may . . . furnish health 
care through providers which are under contract with the organization""). "
251,4," Section 4 provides that HN1[
] ""any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in 
the antitrust laws may sue therefor . . . and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including 
a reasonable attorney's fee."" 15 U.S.C. § 15(a)."
251,5," HN2[
] Section 16 provides that ""[a]ny person . . . shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief . . . against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws . . . under the same conditions and principles . . . [usually employed by] courts 
of equity."" 15 U.S.C. § 26. "
253,6," ENU's internal memoranda, however, reveal less concern over the quality of care than concern about the possibility that 
independent optometrists might dilute the volume of business conducted by the ophthalmologists. "
254,7," When granting hospital privileges to physicians, the hospitals verify the applicant's health care training, education, malpractice 
insurance, as well as investigate the applicant's background. By preferring providers with staff privileges, IHC suggests that it 
avoids unnecessary credentialing costs and duplicative efforts. "
257,8," The Defendants also argue that the Plaintiffs lack standing to assert their group boycott claim under § 1. We need not address 
that issue, however, as we conclude that the Plaintiffs failed to present sufficient evidence of a conspiracy. See Lantec, Inc. v. 
Novell, Inc., 306 F.3d 1003, 1030 (10th Cir. 2002) (declining to address whether plaintiffs suffered an antitrust injury for purposes 
of standing when claims were resolved on other grounds). "
258,9," Professor Areeda suggests, for example, that such integration can reduce transaction costs, reduce the incentive to 
overconsume ""that otherwise results when the insured patient or physician can order any medical goods and services they wish 
without regard for cost because the [traditional] insurer reimburses all costs,"" and it reduces utilization of expensive and 
excessive testing. 10 Areeda & Hovencamp, Antitrust Law P1745g4. Furthermore, such bundling can reduce the cost to 
enrollees as the managed care company rightly assumes that though it provides access to a host of medical services, a majority 
of enrollees will not utilize them all. "
259,10," The Plaintiffs also allege that IHC unlawfully tied the sale of SEC--in addition to NSEC--to its managed care plans. HN17[
] 
Two types of parties have standing to challenge illegal tying arrangements--""the purchasers who are forced to buy the tied 
product to obtain the tying product . . . and the competitor who is restrained from entering the market for the tied product."" Sports 
Racing Servs., 131 F.3d at 887. As the Plaintiffs neither purchase nor provide SEC, they lack standing to assert this claim."
259,11," The Plaintiffs also contend that IHC and its panel ophthalmologists conspired to monopolize the market for surgical facilities. 
Because we held in section II.A that the Plaintiffs failed to present sufficient evidence of a conspiracy, this claim likewise fails. "
260,12," Significantly, the Plaintiffs do not allege that part of the monopolization attempt involved the quid pro quo discussed in Part I.A. 
supra. Instead, the Plaintiffs simply contend that IHC agreed to panel ophthalmologists in exchange for an agreement to refer 
patients needing surgery to IHC surgical facilities. Moreover, to the extent that the Plaintiffs' argument could be construed in 
such a way, their claim fails because such allegedly anticompetitive conduct does not result in a dangerous probability of 
successfully monopolizing the surgical facilities market. See Colo. Interstate Gas Co. v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of Am., 885 
F.2d 683, 693 (10th Cir. 1989) (stating that HN21[
] to state a claim for attempted monopolization, a plaintiff must show that 
there is a dangerous probability that the defendant would achieve monopoly status in the relevant market as the result of the 
predatory conduct alleged by the plaintiffs). During the time period in which IHC was allegedly causing ophthalmologists to refer 
substantially all of their discretionary patients for surgery at IHC facilities, eye surgeries accounted for only a small proportion of 
surgeries at IHC hospitals--between 6% and 7%--and amounted to less than 3% of IHC's surgical revenues. Despite the fact that 
IHC had, at the relevant time, a 51% to 55% share of the surgical facilities market, there is no evidence to suggest that even 
complete success in directing all SEC patients to IHC's hospitals would result in monopoly power in provision of surgical 
facilities. See Bacchus Indus., Inc. v. Arvin Indus., Inc., 939 F.2d 887, 894 (10th Cir. 1991) (stating that monopoly power is 
defined as ""the ability to control prices and exclude competition""); Colo. Interstate Gas Co., 885 F.2d at 694 n.18 (monopoly 
power generally exists when defendant controls 70% to 80% share of the relevant market). "
269,1," HRAP Rule 3(b), entitled ""Joint or consolidated appeals,"" provides that: HN1[
] If two or more parties are entitled to appeal from a judgment or order and their interests are such as to make 
joinder practicable, they may file a joint notice of appeal and thereafter proceed on appeal as a single appellant. Appeals 
may be consolidated by order of either of the Hawaii appellate courts upon the court's own motion, upon motion of a party, 
or upon stipulation of the parties to the several appeals. (Emphasis added.) "

exception to the physician-plaintiffs, who executed their Agreement in January 1998), the determination as to the applicability of 
HRS chapter 658 or HRS chapter 658A to the instant case is not dispositive here."
272,4," The record for the Cooper Appeal contains the executed Agreements of the physician-plaintiffs; both Agreements are identical 
in terms, and the physician-plaintiffs did not dispute the existence of the Agreements. However, with respect to the HMA Appeal, 
the PAR Agreement in the record is that of Dr. Cooper's, the lead plaintiff in the Cooper Appeal, which was explicitly 
incorporated in the HMA Appeal's record at the circuit court level. HMSA provided sworn testimony that, ""while the exact form of 
HMSA's Agreements varies depending on a variety of factors, all [HMA] [m]embers who are 'participating physicians' with HMSA 
by virtue of having an HMSA Agreement, have arbitration clauses in their [Agreement] that are identical or substantially similar to 
the arbitration clause [in the Cooper's Agreement]."" HMA agreed that these documents include the operative terms of the PAR 
Agreements for purposes of this case. "
273,5," HRS § 431:13-108 provides in relevant part: HN4[
] Reimbursement for accident and health or sickness insurance benefits. (a) This section applies to 
accident and health or sickness insurance providers under part I of article 10A of chapter 431, mutual benefit societies 
under article 1 of chapter 432, dental service corporations under chapter 423, and health maintenance organizations 
under chapter 432D. (b) Unless shorter payment timeframes are otherwise specified in a contract, an entity shall reimburse a claim that is not 
contested or denied not more than thirty calendar days after receiving the claim filed in writing, or fifteen calendar days after 
receiving the claim filed electronically, as appropriate. (c) If a claim is contested or denied or requires more time for review by an entity, the entity shall notify the health care 
provider in writing or electronically not more than fifteen calendar days after receiving a claim filed in writing, or not more 
than seven calendar days after receiving a claim filed electronically, as appropriate. The notice shall identify the contested 
portion of the claim and the specific reason for contesting or denying the claim, and may request additional information; 
provided that a notice shall not be required if the entity provides a reimbursement report containing the information, as least 
monthly, to the provider. . . . . (e) If information received pursuant to a request for additional information is satisfactory to warrant paying the claim, the 
claim shall be paid not more than thirty calendar days after receiving the additional information in writing, or not more than 
fifteen calendar days after receiving the additional information filed electronically, as appropriate. (Bold emphasis in original.) "
274,6," In the complaint, under its first cause of action for HMSA's alleged violation of HRS chapter 480, HMA appears to seek 
damages, including treble damages, equitable relief, and reasonable attorneys' fees. However, in HMA's prayer for relief and in 
its opening brief, HMA indicates that it is seeking only injunctive and declaratory relief. Accordingly, for purposes of our 
discussion, HMA's complaint is viewed as requesting only injunctive and declaratory relief."
274,7," Act 229 (2002) amended HRS § 480-2 to provide a private right of action, which ""shall take effect upon approval."" 2002 Haw. 
Sess. L. Act 229, § 6 at 918. Act 229 was approved on June 28, 2002. See 2002 Haw. Sess. L. Act 229, at 918. "
275,8," The May 23, 2003 order also concluded that: "
276,," HMA does not have standing to assert claims arising under HRS chapter 480 for ""unfair or deceptive acts or 
practices,"" because neither HMA nor its members are consumers or other proper parties to bring such claims. HMA 
has conceded in its legal memorandum that it does not seek to assert claims [of] ""unfair or deceptive acts or practices"" 
under HRS § 480-2. (Brackets in original omitted.) Indeed, HMA does not allege a claim of unfair or deceptive acts or practices. Rather, HMA 
Essentially asserts that HMSA's alleged unfair or deceptive acts or practices supports its claim of unfair methods of competition."
276,9," The May 23, 2003 order lastly indicated that the court granted HMSA's request to take judicial notice of all records and files in 
the Cooper Appeal case."
276,10," In their prayer for relief, the physician-plaintiffs requested, inter alia, that the court ""declar[e] that this action is a proper class 
action and certif[y] an appropriate plaintiff Class pursuant to Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 23[.]"" HRCP Rule 
23(c)(1) (2004) provides in relevant part that, ""[a]s soon as practicable after the commencement of an action brought as a class 
action, the court shall determine by order whether it is to be so maintained."" "
278,11," Similar to the May 23, 2003 order in the HMA Appeal, this order (also filed on May 23, 2003) indicated that the circuit court 
granted ""HMSA's request to take judicial notice of all records and files [in the HMA Appeal case]."""
278,12," The circuit court's order in the Cooper Appeal also contained a statement identical to the one found in the HMA Appeal's May 
23, 2003 order, that is: [Physician-p]laintiffs do not have standing to assert claims arising under HRS chapter 480 for ""unfair or deceptive acts 
or practices,"" because they are not consumers or other proper parties to bring suit claims. [Physician-p]laintiffs have 
conceded in their legal memorandum that they do not seek to assert claims [of] ""unfair or deceptive acts or practices"" 
under HRS § 480-2. (Brackets in original omitted.) Again, like HMA, the physician-plaintiffs do not dispute the circuit court's conclusion. In fact, their 
opening and reply briefs only raise arguments with respect to unfair methods of competition."
278,13," The circuit court also dismissed the physician-plaintiffs' claim of unjust enrichment, which is not a subject in the Cooper Appeal 
as the court's ruling is not challenged here. "
279,14," HRCP Rule 12(c) provides in relevant part that, HN9[
] ""[a]fter the pleadings are closed but within such time as not to delay 
the trial, any party may move for judgment on the pleadings."" "
281,15," We note that section 8.1(b), quoted supra, deals with ""Termination of This Agreement,"" and section 8.2, quoted supra, deals 
with ""Expedited Benefits Redetermination,"" which are inapplicable here. "
282,16," Disputes triggering the administrative review process that are specifically referred to in the PAR Agreement include adverse 
decisions by HMSA regarding services related to: (1) HMSA's utilization management program, e.g., pre-certification of a 
proposed service and concurrent, retrospective, and focused review of treatment protocols or specific procedures (section 2.9); 
(2) payment qualifiers and payment determination requirements (sections 4.2 & 4.3); and (3) expedited redetermination of any 
HMSA decision to deny payment for services not yet rendered (section 8.2)."
282,17," Both complaints also contained a separate count for injunctive and declaratory relief. Further, as previously indicated, the 
physician-plaintiffs are not appealing the dismissal of their unjust enrichment claim. "
283,18," In light of our conclusion that the plaintiffs' claims do not fall within the arbitration clause, we need not address the plaintiffs' 
remaining argument that their claims fall within section 8.4 (stating that ""Participating Physician's right to arbitration does not 
include the right to contest any charge included in HMSA's Schedule of Maximum Allowable Charges or the fee review 
process""), quoted supra. Moreover, we note that our holding today also renders moot the physician-plaintiffs' contention that the 
circuit court erred in denying their request for discovery to determine the enforceability of the arbitration clause. Lastly, the 
disposition of this case negates the need to discuss the issue of unconscionability. "
287,19," The complaint alleged that the Council is ""a Pennsylvania nonprofit corporation which functions as a membership organization 
that represents, assists and speaks for its members in matters where joint action is appropriate."" Id. at 85 (internal quotation 
marks omitted). "
292,20, HMA set forth its organizational purpose in its complaint as follows: 
293,," The philosophy and purpose of HMA is to: (1) serve physicians, their patients, and the community through representation, 
advocacy, and other services directed at providing quality medical care; (2) promote the science and art of medicine and 
strive to improve public health; (3) participate in the development of health policy for Hawaii; (4) provide information related 
to medicine; (5) establish and maintain standards of professional conduct and performance; (6) participate in evaluation 
and maintenance of standards for medical education; (7) preserve high quality of care standards; and (8) assist physicians 
in responding to the changing medical practice environment. HMA is also dedicated to providing a voice for physicians, regardless of medical specialty, at the State Legislature and 
serving the interest of Hawai'i physicians and supporting their efforts to provide high quality medical care for all citizens of 
the State. HMA serves as a resource for its members and assists them in addressing the many issues and needs which 
they face in providing healthcare to their patients. "
294,21," HN22[
] HRS § 480-1 (1993) defines ""consumers"" as ""a natural person who, primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, purchases, attempts to purchase, or is solicited to purchase goods or services or who commits money, property, or 
services in a personal investment."""
294,22," In Robert's Hawai'i, this court also overruled the holdings in Ai v. Frank Huff Agency, Ltd., 61 Haw. 607, 607 P.2d 1304 (1980), 
and Island Tobacco Co. Ltd. v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 63 Haw. 289, 627 P.2d 260 (1981), to the extent that they allowed a 
private right of action for unfair methods of competition under HRS § 480-2. 91 Hawai'i at 250 n.26 & 251 n.27, 982 P.2d at 879 
n.26 & 880 n.27. "
296,23," Inasmuch as the circuit court's orders granting HMSA's motion for judgment on the pleadings in the HMA and Cooper Appeals 
are similar, we quote the order contained in the record of the HMA Appeal and incorporate in brackets the only statement that is 
different from the HMA Appeal's order. "
297,24," The ""reasons stated above"" refers to the circuit court's conclusion the plaintiffs did not have standing to assert claims arising 
under HRS chapter 480 for unfair or deceptive acts or practices ""because they are not consumers or other proper parties to 
bring such claims. The plaintiffs have conceded in their legal memorandum that they do not seek to assert claims [of] 'unfair or 
deceptive acts or practices' under HRS § 480-2."" "
298,25," Section 5 of the FTCA, as amended, 15 U.S.C. § 45(a)(1), provides in relevant part: (1) Unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting 
commerce, are hereby declared unlawful."
298,26," The 1985 version of HRS § 480-13 provided in relevant part that: § 480-13 Suits by persons injured; amount of recovery, injunctions. (a) Any person who is injured in the person's 
business or property by reason of anything forbidden or declared unlawful by this chapter: (1) May sue for damages sustained by the person, and, if the judgment is for the plaintiff, the plaintiff shall be awarded a 
sum not less than $ 1,000 or threefold damages by the plaintiff sustained, whichever sum is the greater, and reasonable 
attorneys fees together with the cost of suit; provided that no showing that the proceeding or suit would be in the public 
interest (as those terms are interpreted under section 5(b) of the [FTCA]) is necessary when the party against whom the 
proceeding or suit is brought is a merchant as that term is defined in chapter 490[.] "
299,," (Bold emphasis in original.) (Underscored emphasis added.) In fact, HRS § 480-2(c) (1993), as amended, specifically provides 
that: No showing that the proceeding or suit would be in the public interest (as these terms are interpreted under section 5(b) of 
the [FTCA]) is necessary in any action brought under this section."
299,27," Although the plaintiffs miss the mark in rebutting HMSA's argument, we note that this court, in examining HRS § 480-2 and 
section 5 of the FTCA, stated in Island Tobacco Co.: [W]e view section 480-2 as being designed to aid ""competitors,"" as much as to protect ""competition."" And unlike the 
[FTCA], the policy of the Hawai'i law, as expressed in HRS [§ ] 480-13, is to foster private suits grounded on unfair [] or 
deceptive trade practices, even where the unlawful acts [d]o not culminate in injury to ""competition."""
299,63," Haw. at 301, 627 P.2d at 269 (emphasis added). As previously noted, Island Tobacco Co. was overruled by Robert's 
Hawai[]i, 91 Hawai'i at 251 n.27, 982 P.2d at 880 n.27, to the extent that it allowed a private right of action for unfair methods of "
300,," competition under HRS § 480-2. See supra note 22. The decision, however, remains valid with respect to the remainder of the 
discussion therein."
300,28," The physician-plaintiffs in the Cooper Appeal make the identical allegations in their complaint, except they are numbered as 
paragraphs 63 and 64, respectively. "
302,29," Again, as previously indicated, the allegations in the complaints filed by HMA and the physician-plaintiffs are nearly identical. 
The allegations quoted above are found in HMA's complaint, and the only difference in numbering is paragraph 11 above, which 
is numbered ""7."" in the physician-plaintiffs' complaint in the Cooper Appeal. "
303,30," The Robert's Hawai'i court stated that: [F]ederal case law has interpreted the ""injury to business or property"" language of section 4 of the Clayton Act as a 
causation requirement, requiring a showing of ""antitrust injury."""
303,91, Hawai'i at 254 n.31; 982 P.2d at 883 n.31 (citation omitted).
303,31," We note that the Ai court set forth a fourth element - ""a showing that the action is in the public interest or that the defendant is 
a merchant."" Id. at 617, 607 P.2d at 1311. However, this case was decided before the 1987 amendment to HRS §§ 480-2 and -
13 that eliminated this requirement. Sen. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 105, in 1987 Senate Journal, at 872. Accordingly, the fourth 
""public interest"" element is no longer required. See also supra note 27. "
304,32," We also note that the circuit court's reliance upon the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in 
McCormack v. Nat'l Collegiate Athletic Ass'n, 845 F.2d 1338, 1341 (5th Cir. 1988), for its conclusion that HMA had not 
established ""antitrust injury"" is misplaced. McCormack involved an action brought by the university's alumni, football players, and 
cheerleaders (the plaintiffs) against a national athletic association for violations of antitrust and civil rights laws by promulgating 
and enforcing rules that restricted benefits to be awarded to student athletes. Id. at 1339. The Fifth Circuit, in addressing the 
claims of two of the plaintiff-groups, i.e., the university alumni and the cheerleaders, held that they had failed to satisfy the 
antitrust injury requirement in that: The cheerleaders assert only the loss of the opportunity to lead cheers, which clearly does not qualify as an injury to 
business or property. The only injuries [the university alumni] allege[] are the devaluation of [their] degree[s], the loss of the 
opportunity to see football games, and the damages to [their] contact and association with current and prospective student 
athletes derived from [the] membership[.] Of these three, only the first is even arguably an injury to business or property. . . 
. [W]e cannot conclude that the devaluation of [the university alumni's] degree[s] is an injury for which the antitrust laws 
were designed to afford a remedy. The alleged connection, moreover, between the [national athletic association's] actions 
and the devaluation of [the] degree[s] presents the sort of ""speculative"" and ""abstract"" causal chain[.] Id. at 1341-42. However, such is not the case here. HMA has clearly alleged a direct injury to its business, i.e., the drain of 
HMA's financial resources. "
305,33," Section 766B defines HN30[
] the tort of ""Intentional Interference with Prospective Contractual Relation"" as follows: One who intentionally and improperly interferes with another's prospective contractual relation (except a contract to marry) 
is subject to liability to the other for the pecuniary harm resulting from loss of the benefits of the relation, whether the 
interference consists of (a) inducing or otherwise causing a third person not to enter into or continue the prospective relation or (b) preventing the other from acquiring or continuing the prospective relation. "
306,34," As with their claims of unfair methods of competition, the physician-plaintiffs in the Cooper Appeal make the identical 
allegations in their complaint, except that they are numbered as paragraphs 83 through 86. "
307,35," We note, however, that the physician-plaintiff/members will eventually be required to present more specific details in order to 
support their claims. For example, in Celex Group, sellers of motivational products brought an action against a competitor who 
sold executive products and also purchased items and sold items to sellers, asserting a variety of intellectual property and 
contractual claims. 877 F. Supp. at 1117, 1119. The competitor (the counterclaim-plaintiff) counterclaimed, alleging, inter alia, 
tortious interference with business opportunity in connection with seller's entry into the airline advertising market used by the 
counterclaim-plaintiff. Id. at 1118, 1123. Specifically, the counterclaim-plaintiff alleged that, ""by invading [its] allegedly exclusive 
airline advertising province, [the sellers] intentionally interfered with [the counterclaim-plaintiff's] business expectancies with its 
past and prospective customers."" Id. at 1123 (internal quotation marks omitted). The United States District Court for the Northern 
District of Illinois granted summary judgment where the counterclaim-plaintiff did not even ""attempt[] to identify any specific third 
parties with whom it had a reasonable business expectancy"" but rather relied on ""past and prospective corporate executive 
customers"" as an ""identifiable class."" Id. at 1125 (internal quotation marks omitted). The court stated: Although [the counterclaim-plaintiff's] past and prospective corporate executive customers may constitute an identifiable 
class for purposes of allowing [the counterclaim-plaintiff] to defeat a motion to dismiss, [the counterclaim-plaintiff] must 
come forward with its evidence and identify particular third parties with whom it had a reasonable expectancy of entering 
into business to defeat a motion for summary judgment. Id. The court also noted that requiring the identification of a specific party makes sense because a party also must show that a 
particular contractual or business relationship is contemplated. Id. at 1126 n.19. Were it not for this requirement, ""liability under a 
theory of tortious interference with prospective business expectancies would be virtually without limit and impossible to 
calculate."" Id. "
314,1," According to Kochert's brief, the relevant product is ""anesthesia services in support of inpatient surgical and obstetrical 
services, both requiring a hospital stay of greater than 23 hours."" (Pl. Brief at 15.) References to ""anesthesia services"" 
throughout this opinion are generally limited to this definition."
314,2," The three versions offered were (1) Tippecanoe County, (2) Tippecanoe, Montgomery, Clinton and White Counties, and (3) 
Tippecanoe and its seven contiguous counties."
314,3," Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1993)."
314,4," Kochert v. Greater Lafayette Health Servs., 372 F. Supp. 2d 509, 516 (N.D. Ind. 2004). "
316,5," Kochert has maintained anesthesia privileges at SEMC, but the record is clear that she was practicing pain management full-
time by mid-2000. "
322,1," In its original counterclaim, filed on January 25, 2000, Carquest actually declared that it ""was not required to purchase the 
computer [from GPI]"" in order to continue doing business under its agreement with GPI. (Emphasis added.) "
328,1," On the day that Plaintiff's brief in opposition to the LCB Defendants' motion was due, the WBWWA filed a 12-page brief 
""joining"" the LCB Defendants' motion and offering additional arguments in support of the motion. (Dkt. No. 175). The Court has 
reviewed the WBWWA's brief, despite the fact that the procedure followed by the WBWWA is not authorized by the Local Civil 
Rules of this Court. See Local Civil Rule 7(b)(2) (authorizing parties to file briefs in opposition to a motion, but making no 
provision for filing briefs to lend additional support to another party's motion). Because the WBWWA filed its brief on the same 
day that Plaintiff's opposition brief was due, Plaintiff did not have the opportunity under the Local Civil Rules to file a written 
response to the WBWWA's additional arguments. "
330,2," As discussed earlier, Costco also raised a Commerce Clause challenge to Washington's policy of allowing only in-state beer 
and wine manufacturers to sell directly to retailers. The Court does not regard this constitutional claim as posing a difficult 
question of law, given the guidance provided by the Supreme Court's ruling in Granholm v. Heald, 544 U.S. 460, 125 S. Ct. 
1885, 161 L. Ed. 2d 796 (2005). In any case, the State Legislature responded to the Court's ruling on Costco's constitutional 
challenge by extending the direct sales privilege to out-of-state manufacturers, subject to a sunset provision. As a result, today's 
ruling should not be construed as staying the Court's judgment on Costco's constitutional claims. "
332,3," The WBWWA also expresses concern that failure to stay the judgment will harm small retailers of beer and wine. However, the 
WBWWA represents beer and wine wholesalers, not small retailers. "
337,1," The ""Consumer Plaintiffs"" are comprised of fifteen individuals—Gloria Jaccarino Bender, Anthony J. Jaccarino, John Clark, 
Donna Sprague, Nancy and Ira Heiman, Donald Sprague, Maria and Tony Magsarili, Frances H. Rocha, Marsha Burger, Sandra 
Gonzalez, Deborah Winch, Anna Kain, and Gay Holtz."
337,2," Defendants Batesville and Hillenbrand filed Docket Entry No. 318, a motion to dismiss Plaintiffs Pioneer Valley Casket Co., 
Inc.'s complaint, inadvertently in this cause. Although the FCA and Pioneer Valley cases were consolidated, it was for discovery "
338,," purposes only. Thus, a dispositive motion in the Pioneer Valley case should have been filed in H-05-cv-3399. The Court will 
address Batesville and Hillenbrand's motion to dismiss in a separate memorandum and recommendation in that case."
338,3," In developing the summary of facts, the Court accepts all of the factual allegations in Plaintiffs' First Amended Consolidated 
Class Action Complaint as true. See Blackburn v. City of Marshall, 42 F. 3d 925, 931 (5th Cir. 1995)."
338,4," Plaintiffs' First Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint, Docket Entry No. 198, will be referred to as ""First Amended 
Complaint."""
338,5," Independent casket discounters or ""ICDs"" are third-party sellers of caskets that are unaffiliated with a licensed funeral home. 
See First Amended Complaint., at 112."
338,6," Plaintiffs allege that numerous entities, including funeral homes that are Dignity Memorial ""partners"" with SCI, have conspired 
with Defendants. According to Plaintiffs, co-conspirators include the National Funeral Directors Association (""NFDA""), certain 
Funeral Director Associations (""FDAs""), as well as casket manufacturers Aurora Casket Company (""Aurora"") and York Group, 
Inc. (""York""). See First Amended Complaint, at ¶¶ 7, 36-43. "
345,7," Interbrand competition is the competition among manufacturers of the same type of product. Intrabrand competition is the 
competition among distributors of the same brand of a product. See Muenster Butane, Inc., 651 F.2d at 295 n.12 (citation 
omitted). "
351,1," The License Agreement is not attached to the FAC. StreamCast represents that this is because it contains a confidentiality 
clause which necessitates an entry of a protective order, an action that has not been accomplished to date. "
353,2," For the reasons set forth in the Court's Order Granting Defendants Mark Dyne, Murray Markiles, and Altnet, Inc.'s Motion to 
Dismiss Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint on Statute of Limitations Grounds, filed concurrently with this order, all of the causes 
of action set forth in the FAC against Defendants Dyne, Markiles and Altnet, Inc. are barred by  [*12] the applicable statutes of 
limitations. Accordingly, the instant motion is moot as to said Defendants. "
356,3," In addition, StreamCast essentially concedes that all of the alleged ""predicate acts"" by Moving Defendants leading up to the 
transfer of the FastTrack technology to Sharman Networks took place over the course of a relatively short period--i.e., mid 2001 
through February 2002. See Opp'n at 18; cf. GICC Capital Corp. v. Technology Fin. Group, 67 F.3d 463, 467 (2d Cir. 1995) 
(""Since H.J. Inc., other courts of appeals . . . have attempted to measure whether closed-ended continuity exists by weighing a 
variety of non-dispositive factors, including, inter alia, the length of time over  [*23] which the alleged predicate acts took place, 
the number and variety of acts, the number of participants, the number of victims, and the presence of separate schemes."")."
356,4," Moving Defendants also fault StreamCast for (1) failing to allege any predicate acts of mail or wire fraud with the requisite 
particularity under Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b), and (2) failing to allege the existence of a RICO ""enterprise."" However, because it is 
unequivocal that the allegations in the FAC are insufficient to fulfill the continuity requirement, these additional arguments need 
not be addressed. "
357,5," Because StreamCast has failed to plead sufficient facts to state a claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), its conspiracy claim under § 
1962(d) necessarily fails as well. See, e.g., Wagh v. Metris Direct, Inc., 363 F.3d 821, 831 (9th Cir. 2003)."
357,6," While the Sherman Act provides the substantive basis for StreamCast's claims, the Clayton Act supplies a private right of 
action therefor. See Glen Holly Entm't, Inc. v. Tektronix Inc. 343 F.3d 1000, 1007 (9th Cir. 2003) (""This law [section 4 of the 
Clayton Act] effectively allows private  [*26] persons to sue for antitrust violations previously restricted by statute to government 
enforcement.""). "
359,7," StreamCast is correct in pointing out that it is possible for a relevant market to be defined by only a single product or 
submarket. See, e.g., Kodak, 504 U.S. at 481-82 (relevant market limited to repair pans and services for Kodak photo-copiers 
""[b]ecause service and parts for Kodak equipment are not interchangeable with other manufacturers' service and parts . . . .""). 
However, this possibility does not obviate the need for StreamCast to plead, in the first instance, a lack of reasonable 
interchangeability between FastTrack P2P providers and non-FastTrack providers. "
363,1," While Dr. Reddy's papers do not precisely define ""western Brooklyn,"" the area is said to include Park Slope, Red Hook, and 
Bay Ridge. The Court notes that, for purposes of this motion, defendants have not contested the relevant market put forth by Dr. 
Reddy. "
366,2," Defendants cite at length from Ezekwo v. Am. Bd. of Internal Med., 18 F. Supp. 2d 271 (S.D.N.Y. 1998). However, the cited 
portion, dealing with injury to competition, was decided on summary judgment and not on a motion to dismiss. This Court finds 
the Ezekwo decision particularly instructive in its statement that ""in order to find market injury, the impact within [plaintiff's] 
market must be assessed, requiring some factual submission as to that market's structure and the services offered therein."" Id. 
at 278. Such inquiry is proper on summary judgment, after plaintiff has had the opportunity, through discovery, to prepare a 
factual submission. If anything, the logic of Ezekwo militates against defendants' motion."
366,3," The Court also rejects defendants' contention that the Court should dismiss plaintiff's complaint because plaintiff has failed to 
allege a ""significant impact on the market."" Defendants' base this argument on Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 
U.S. 2, 104 S. Ct. 1551, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2 (1984), which is wholly inapplicable here. In Jefferson Parish, the Supreme Court 
addressed a tying arrangement that was alleged to have violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act. Id. at 5-8. Justice Stevens, "
367,," writing for a 5-4 majority, found that the tying anangement had no significant impact on the market because it had not affected 
consumer choice, as there was no showing that consumers shopped for the tied product -- anesthesiology services. Id. at 27-28. 
Thus, in Jefferson Parish, the Court did not conclude, as defendants suggest, that the lack of a ""significant impact on the market"" 
should be found where only a single competitor has been eliminated from the market. "
378,1,"  Motion made this argument in the per se section of its brief. Nonetheless, the requirement of a contract, combination or 
conspiracy applies equally to a rule of reason claim. Expert Masonry, 440 F.3d at 342 "
380,2,"  Thus, a distributor does not state an antitrust injury when it has merely been replaced by another distributor. See Expert 
Masonry, 440 F.3d at 346-47. Here, BDI has not alleged that it has been replaced by a new distributor but rather that its services 
have been removed from the market altogether to the detriment of consumers. "
381,3," HN16[
] ""[W]ell-defined submarkets may exist which, in themselves, constitute product markets for antitrust purposes."" Brown Shoe, 370 U.S. at 324 (citing United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 353 U.S. 586, 593-595, 77 S. Ct. 872, 1 L. Ed. 2d 
1057 (1957)). BDI has provided a broad product market definition so this rule is not relevant to the Court's analysis. "
382,4," Motion first argued that Ohio courts ""apply essentially the same analysis"" to deceptive trade practice claims as an unfair 
competition claim under federal statutes. Motion continued that the deceptive trade practice claim failed because the Section 1 
claim failed. Because the Court finds that BDI has stated a Section 1 claim, this argument is rejected."
382,5," Motion also argues that BDI has pleaded paragraph 83 as a statement of opinion which would not be actionable. See Northeast 
State College of Massotheraphy v. Burek, 144 Ohio App. 3d 196, 2001 Ohio 3293, 759 N.E.2d 869 (2001). This is based on the 
fact that BDI's allegation is on ""information and belief"" and is somewhat puzzling. Whether items were manufactured in China is 
not the sort of statement that lends itself to judgment or opinion. "
385,1," The Court addresses Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint which was filed on September 15, 2006 pursuant to parties 
Stipulation Regarding Filing of Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint. "
390,1, The Honorable Victoria S. Marks entered the orders and judgment which are challenged in this appeal. 
400,1," To the extent that Hesco seeks additional discovery in the hopes of uncovering evidence implicating other automobile 
manufacturers in an as-yet undiscovered cartel activity, the facts alleged in PP 11-116 and the Thirteenth Count are completely 
devoid of any such allegations. This court is constrained by the scope of the allegations made in the Thirteenth Count. . As noted 
in ECC v. Toshiba America Consumer Products, Inc., 129 F.3d 240, 243 (2d Cir. 1997), ""While 'Conley permits HN4[
] a 
pleader to enjoy all favorable inference from facts that have been pleaded, [it] does not permit conclusory statements to 
substitute for minimally sufficient factual allegations.' Furlong, M.D. v. Long Island College Hosp., 710 F.2d 922, 928 (2d Cir. 
1983). As the Supreme Court has stated,' [i]t is not…proper to assume that the [plaintiff] can prove facts that it has not alleged or 
that the defendants have violated the antitrust laws in ways that have not been alleged.' Associated General Contractors, Inc. v. 
California State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 526, 103 S.Ct. 897, 902, 74 L.Ed.2d 723 (1983)."" We find, therefore, that 
there is no legitimate dispute of fact underlying the Thirteenth Count with respect to the manner in which the alleged restraint 
was implemented. The Thirteenth Count alleges a restraint agreed upon between a single dealer and a single manufacturer to 
prohibit Visteon and Hesco from selling Visteon brand parts to Ford dealerships. "
401,2," Hesco urges that the purported arrangement between Ford and Visteon is not a dual distribution arrangement because Visteon 
manufactures parts under more than one brand name, the alleged restraint was not imposed unilaterally by Visteon, and it was 
not imposed to enhance rather than inhibit competitive marketing of its brand of product. The court does not find Hesco's 
analysis persuasive, for the reasons set forth later in this opinion."
401,3," The initial disposition in Business Electronics was on a jury verdict, while we are evaluating this claim on summary judgment. 
We do not find the difference in procedural posture to be relevant inasmuch as the pertinent facts, facts made pertinent by the 
Supreme Court decision, are undisputed in this case."
401,4," Some courts have expressed concern over the use of the characterization of restraints as either ""horizontal"" or ""vertical,"" 
indicating that antitrust law is addressed to the economic impact of any given arrangement. This court does not take issue with 
that view. However, HN6[
] addressing the matter of per se violations, the Supreme Court has made it abundantly clear that it 
is the nature of the relationship between the parties to the alleged restraint that determines whether the alleged restraint can be 
found to be per se illegal: ""[A] facially vertical restraint imposed by a manufacturer only because it has been coerced by a 
'horizontal cartel' agreement among his distributors is in reality a horizontal restraint…That says precisely what we say: a 
restraint is horizontal not because it has horizontal effects, but because it is the product of a horizontal agreement."" Business 
Electronics, 108 S.Ct. at 1523, n. 4. "
403,5," We follow the line of reasoning in Oreck only insofar as it is discussed in Toshiba on the issue of dual branding of the product 
of one manufacturer. Oreck, is a pre-Business Electronics decision. "
599,1," The court rejects without comment the allegation that Re/Max's attempt to register a trademark could be somehow construed 
as a violation of federal antitrust law. "
618,1," The allegations raise an immediate difficulty. Plaintiffs argue that ""[a]s a result of Tilcon using its monopoly power to force Port 
Dock out of business, Tilcon was able to unilaterally raise prices for aggregate in the market, both for distributors and 
consumers."" (See Pls.' Opp'n Mem. at 4.) It is unclear, however, why eliminating Port Dock, a distributor, would allow Tilcon to 
raise the price of its product for other distributors and consumers. Instead, a more natural reading of the events is that the 
elimination of other manufacturers would allow Tilcon to raise the price of its products for other distributors and consumers. 
Thus, though some injurious effects may have been felt within the pleaded ""relevant market"" of distributors, it seems that the 
cause of the injurious effects is best characterized as the elimination of other manufacturers. Thus, the ""relevant market"" where 
the antitrust activity occurred, i.e., the manufacturing market, appears to be different than the ""relevant market"" pleaded by 
Plaintiffs, i.e., the distribution market."
618,2," Despite the fact that all of the alleged antitrust activity occurred in the aggregate market, Plaintiffs maintain that the distribution 
market is the ""relevant market."" This is done, presumably, to buttress the core of Plaintiffs' claim that they were the intended 
victim of Defendants' antitrust activity. (See, e.g., Compl. PP 1, 38, 46, 62-83; see also Pl.'s Opp'n Mem. at 7 (arguing that all of 
the cases cited by Defendants are distinguishable because ""none of them involved allegations that the termination of a 
distributorship relationship was effected in furtherance of an intentional scheme to monopolize the market by anticompetitive 
action."").) The argument exposes an additional flaw in Plaintiffs' line of reasoning. The first prong considers whether Plaintiffs in 
fact suffered an antitrust injury. Intent is not part of the equation. It is only once the Court has determined that Plaintiffs have 
suffered an antitrust injury does the Court consider intent, which would help the Court determine if Plaintiffs are efficient 
enforcers of the antitrust laws. See Balaklaw, 14 F.3d at 797 n.9. "
624,1," ""Reconsideration may be necessary if there is (1) newly discovered evidence, (2) an intervening development or change in 
controlling law, or (3) the need to correct a clear error or prevent manifest injustice."" Jersawitz v. People TV, 71 F. Supp. 2d 
1330, 1344 (N.D. Ga. 1999). "
625,2," ""Although the issue of fair use is a mixed question of law and fact, the court may resolve issues of fair use at the summary 
judgment stage where there are no genuine issues of material fact as to such issues."" Bill Graham Archives v. Darling 
Kindersley Ltd., 448 F.3d 605, 608 (2d Cir. 2006)."
625,3," Because the use was commercial, this Court held, the first factor weighed in favor of Gulfstream. Gulfstream, 428 F.Supp.2d at 
1378. On reconsideration, the Court realizes it may have been mistaken, though obviously Gulfstream does not challenge the 
determination. In the area of comparative advertising, a competitor ""is most certainly copying ... copyrighted material for the 
commercial purposes of increasing its own sales, [but] such comparative advertising redounds greatly to the purchasing public's 
benefit with very little corresponding loss to the integrity of [the] copyrighted material."" Sony Computer Entm't America V. Bleem, "
626,," LLC, 214 F.3d 1022, 1027 (9th Cir. 2000). The use of a true and correct representation of the manual in maintenance tracking 
similarly redounds to the public interest in aviation safety, as evidenced by the fact that federal regulations prohibit Camp from 
producing its own version of the manual, Gulfstream, 428 F.Supp.2d at 1373, with little loss to the integrity of the copyrighted 
manual. See also Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corp., 336 F.3d 811, 820 (9th Cir. 2003) (first factor weighs in favor of finding fair use 
because, though use is commercial, public benefit of the defendant's search engine outweighs harm to plaintiff's copyright); 
Perfect 10 v. Google, Inc., 416 F.Supp.2d 828, 845 (C.D. Cal. 2006) (""Although often discussed within the context of the first 
factor, 'the public interest is also a factor that continually informs the fair use analysis.'"" (quoting 4 Nimmer on Copyright § 
12B.01[A][2](2005)))."
626,4," The Court also found Gulfstream's copyright questionable. Gulfstream, 428 F.Supp.2d at 1375-76. Still, Camp conceded the 
existence, however thin, of Gulfstream's copyright, so the Court pretermitted the issue and reached Camp's fair use defense. Id. 
The ""thin-ness"" of the copyright, however, is relevant to the fair use analysis. Id. at 1378 (how close a work is to the core of 
intended copyright protection affects the fair use, factor-balancing analysis)."
626,5," The Court finds this assertion to be irreconcilably inconsistent with the afore-mentioned contractual and ""propriety warning"" 
language aimed at blocking Gulfstream customers from lending their manuals to Camp. "
627,6," Gulfstream cites a vacated Eleventh Circuit opinion for this argument, Bellsouth Adver. Corp. & Publ'g Corp. v. Donnelley Info. 
Publ'g, Inc., 933 F.2d 952, 960 (11th Cir. 1991) (Bellsouth I), vacated, 999 F.2d 1436 (11th Cir. 1993) (en banc) (Bellsouth II). 
Doc. # 133 at 5. The argument has been roundly rejected by the Supreme Court: ""It was error for the Court of Appeals to 
conclude that the commercial nature of [a use] rendered it presumptively unfair."" Campbell, 510 U.S. at 594."
627,7," ""A tying arrangement is an agreement under which the vendor will sell one product or service only if the purchaser agrees to 
purchase another product or service as well."" ADVISING SMALL BUSINESSES § (Tying arrangements) (2006); U.S. Phillips Corp. v. 
Int'l Trade Comm'n, 424 F.3d 1179, 1189 (Fed.Cir. 2005) (in patent-to-product tying, the patent owner uses the market power 
conferred by the patent to compel customers to purchase a product in a separate market that the customer might otherwise 
purchase from a competitor; the patent owner is thus able to use the market power conferred by the patent to foreclose 
competition in the market for the product). "
628,8," Compare Telecom Technical Servs., Inc. v. Rolm Co., 388 F.3d 820, 826-27 (11th Cir. 2004) (refusal by manufacturer of 
private branch exchanges (PBXs) to sell PBX repair parts, some of which were protected by patents, to independent telephone 
service organizations (ISOs) that specialized in servicing PBX systems, did not violate Sherman Act; there was no evidence of 
harm to owners of the manufacturer's equipment, as they could order PBX repair parts and ask an ISO to install them, or provide 
an ISO with a letter of agency so that the ISO could order the part from the manufacturer). Gulfstream says Rolm supports its 
position because third-party service providers could obtain the patented parts through the PBX manufacturer's (Siemens's) 
customers. Doc. # 133 at 3-4. Gulfstream ignores the fact, however, that no one in Rolm even alleged that Siemens had a 
monopoly over the market for PBX sales. 388 F.3d at 823 n. 1. More importantly, an ISO in Rolm (equivalent to Camp's position 
in this case) could (simply by obtaining a letter of agency from the PBX owner) ""order the part [directly] from Siemen's."" Id. at 
827. Gulfstream, in contrast, obviously holds a monopoly over the sale of Gulfstream aircraft and aircraft-servicing manuals. Worse, 
Gulfstream refuses to sell Camp a copy, thus undermining any claim that it is losing the benefit of the ""natural"" copyright 
monopoly conferred on it by statute. Gulfstream then tries to contractually prevent its aircraft-owner customers from disclosing 
any part of its copy to Camp. In Rolm, then, there was no ""actionable harm to consumers,"" id. at 827, while here there is. As for Siemens's refusal to sell its PBX software in that case, the Rolm court acknowledged a potential conflict between a 
statutorily sanctioned copyright monopoly and antitrust law, but did not address it because the software at issue in the present case has no diagnostic or repair function; it is operating system software which 
operates the PBX hardware and proprietary reconfiguration [*14]  software which allows Siemens to control its licenses on 
the operating system software. The software helps to make Siemens competitive in the product market for PBX products. 
Neither type of software, however, is intended to help diagnose problems and make repairs. Thus, the software does not 
give Siemens a competitive advantage in the service market."
628,388," F.3d at 828 (cites omitted; emphasis added). Here, in contrast, the manuals unquestionably give Gulfstream a competitive 
advantage in its own aircraft's service market."
628,9," As one encyclopedic source summarizes: There are two approaches to copyright abuse. In the first, a finding that the plaintiff engaged in antitrust violations is a 
prerequisite to application of the doctrine of copyright misuse. The second, and broader, approach focuses on public policy, 
labeling certain activities as per se copyright misuse and uses a rule of reason approach for others. For those activities that 
fall within the rule of reason test, the court first asks whether the restraint is within the scope of the copyright monopoly. If it 
is, then the conduct is per se legal. If not, the court then asks whether the activity as a whole promotes or restricts 
competition. If the particular activity (e.g. licensing provision) restricts competition, then it is copyright misuse. Under the "
629,," public policy approach, a violation of antitrust law may be sufficient, but is not necessary, for copyright misuse. Misuse 
limits enforcement of rights, not remedies. That is, copyright misuse does not invalidate a copyright, but precludes its 
enforcement during the period of misuse. If the plaintiffs are engaged in misuse, they cannot [*16]  bring suit based on their 
rights until the misuse ends. The doctrine does not prevent the plaintiffs from ultimately recovering for acts of infringement 
that occur during the period of misuse. The issue focuses on when the plaintiffs can bring or pursue an action for 
infringement, not for which acts of infringement they can recover. Fed. Proc. Forms § 17:84 (Copyright misuse) (July 2006) (footnotes omitted). "
630,10," It would also contradict the FAA's intentions. Its letter to the parties noted that, white Gulfstream was not obligated to furnish 
its manuals directly to Camp, it did have to furnish them to Gulfstream owners, who could then choose to utilize Camp's 
services. See Gulfstream, 428 F.Supp.2d at 1373; doc. # 146 exh. 3 at 1-2. The FAA also recognized, however, that whether an 
owner then decides to provide Camp with a copy of the manual (the FAA calls it an ""ICA"") is governed by any contractual 
restrictions inhering in the owner's contract with Gulfstream, and not any FAA regulation. Id. at 2. In other words, the FAA 
recognized Gulfstream's right to contractually restrict owners from giving their manuals to third parties like Camp. The amicus brief points out that the FAA also compels Gulfstream to furnish manuals to ""FAA-qualified service centers"" and, just 
because Camp does not qualify as one should not be held against Gulfstream. Doc. # 146 at 7-9. Of course, that's simply 
irrelevant, because no one denies that Camp provides a service against which Gulfstream competes, and obviously a not 
insubstantial part of the Gulfstream consumer base prefers Camp over both Gulfstream and any ""service centers."" See doc. # 
106 ¶40 (Response); id. ¶ 45 (Response). The amicus argument seems to be premised on the notion that Gulfstream is free to 
squelch Camp so long as (presumably more expensive to use) ""service centers"" still exist. That notion of course is demonstrably 
flawed; the fact that there may be another consumer choice out there does not belie the fact that Gulfstream is working an 
anticompetitive effect via use of its copyright to benefit its service division at a direct competitor's expense. The social interest in 
more, rather than less, competition, is harmed, which thus makes this a relevant fair use factor to consider."
630,11," The lead paragraph of such a ""plane crash"" story undoubtedly would read: ""A Gulfstream jet flown by XYZ Airlines crashed 
yesterday...."" In that regard, few can forget that an entire airline more or less vanished after just one crash. See 
http://www.airchive.com/SITE%20PAGES/ITMETABLES-VALUEJET.html (site as of 9/26/06). "
631,12," Hence, upon Gulfstream's Notice of Appeal, the Clerk shall administratively close this case pending appeal. Any party with 
standing may move to reopen it in the meantime. Finally, the Clerk shall reopen it upon receipt of the Eleventh Circuit's appellate 
mandate. "
640,1," Lexmark also makes the argument that it has created, rather than restrained, the market for its remanufactured cartridges. 
Essentially, if Lexmark were not in business or made its cartridges incapable of remanufacture, then there would be no market in 
remanufactured Lexmark cartridges. [R. 176, Attach. 1, at 34-35, Case No. 04-84]. This argument is distinguishable from the 
facially-similar argument in the microchip context, in which SCC has profited by Lexmark's alleged antitrust activity of introducing 
""anticompetitive microchips."" ""[I]n order to survive a motion to dismiss for failure to allege antitrust injury, a plaintiff must allege 
either: (1) that the antitrust violation was 'a necessary predicate' to their injury; or (2) that the defendant could injure plaintiffs 
only by engaging in the antitrust violation."" In re Cardizem CD Antitrust Litigation, 332 F.3d 896, 912 (6th Cir. 2003)(emphasis in 
original)(citing Hodges v. WSM, Inc., 26 F.3d 36, 39 (6th Cir. 1994)). While SCC cannot plead that Lexmark ""could injure SCC 
only by engaging in the antitrust violation,"" SCC does argue that, the Associated Gen. Contractors factors aside, Lexmark's 
alleged conduct has caused an injury-in-fact, and but for Lexmark's alleged illegal activities, SCC would not have been injured. 
See NicSand, Inc. v. 3M Co., 457 F.3d 534, 552, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 20321, at *43 (6th. Cir. 2006)(Plaintiff's ""claims satisfy 
the necessary predicate test because it is not 'apparent from the face of the complaint that actual and unequivocally legal action 
by [the defendant] would have' -- as opposed to could have --'caused [Plaintiff's] injury, even if there had been no antitrust 
violation."") "
641,2," Examples include: (1) ""Lexmark specifically launched its Prebate program to intimidate and to exclude competition from remanufacturers."" [R. 172, 
Case No. 02-571 at 16]. (2) ""Lexmark has threatened suing its competitors that remanufacture prebate toner cartridges."" Id. at 17. (3) Lexmark's Prebate program ""has the intended effect of excluding competition and increasing prices to consumers in the 
relevant markets by restricting the supply of Lexmark toner cartridges."" Id. "
642,," (4) ""Lexmark purposefully misleads end-users to believe that they have a restricted license on Lexmark toner cartridges . . . and 
that the license requires customers and end-users to purchase toner cartridges only from Lexmark."" Id. at 18. (5) ""By using the sham Prebate license to deceive customers . . ., Lexmark misuses its patent rights to preserve, maintain, and 
enhance its unlawful monopoly in the relevant markets."" Id. at 19. (6) ""Lexmark isolates and targets customers and end-users that prefer to use remanufactured toner cartridges. . . ."" Id. "
643,3," Specifically in Hyde the plaintiffs were indirect purchasers of infant formula, ""because they purchased infant formula through 
parties other than the manufacturer [and the alleged antitrust violator]."" Hyde at 574."
643,4," Lexmark raises a conflict of laws issue regarding SCC's state law claims, arguing that Kentucky antitrust law mirrors Federal 
antitrust law and should be applied in this case. The Court has a number of reservations concerning this argument, foremost of 
which is that Kentucky simply has not developed any law concerning North Carolina's Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act; 
Kentucky has only interpreted its own antitrust statutes, and therefore Kentucky's ""substantive"" law concerning SCC's North 
Carolina statutory claims likely would be to defer to the North Carolina courts' rulings on the statutes. In any event, because the "
644,," Court finds that SCC lacks standing to bring its state claims pursuant to North Carolina's law, the Court need not force the 
conflicts of law issue."
644,5," Lexmark's motion is styled in part as a motion ""to strike certain affirmative defenses,"" but Lexmark does not specifically state to 
which of SCC's fifteen affirmative defenses it objects. [R. 176, Attach. 1, at 39, Case No. 04-84; R. 172 at 6-8, Case No. 02-571]. "
647,1," J.J. has also sued three other defendants: P&F International, Inc. (""P&F""), American Travel Abroad, Inc. (""AmTA""), and 
Millenium Tours (""Millenium""). P&F, though served, has never appeared in the action. The parties have stipulated to dismiss 
AmTA without prejudice, and to join Millenium as a defendant in a related case, Tokarz v. Albatross Travel, et al., Case No. 00-
CV-3372 (E.D.N.Y.), which has been stayed pending the outcome of this case. "
650,2," LOT contends that the unpaid commissions total $ 28,358.45, while J.J. contends that they total $ 97,728.00. "
653,1," The case was dismissed as to the Individual Defendants following a settlement agreement. (D.E. 208.) It appears that the 
Ambulance Defendants dropped out as a result of CoMed's bankruptcy proceedings. (See D.E. 80 at 4.) "
656,2," Relators object to Defendants' proffered expert Larry Lee Isley's ""unsworn expert report."" (See, e.g., D.E. 288 P 12.) However, 
Isley has submitted an affidavit that complies with Rule 56(e). (D.E. 315.) Isley initially omitted to supply the conforming affidavit; 
while the Court sometimes strikes parties' filings without prejudice where they have failed to comply with such requirements, and 
affords them an opportunity to fix the omission and rebrief the issues, that seemed like an imprudent and wasteful step in this 
case. More specifically, the summary judgment briefing and related factual materials submitted in this case span several 
thousand pages, and the case was already seven years old when this Court inherited it upon taking the bench in 2003. 
Requiring the parties to incur costs of resubmitting the thousands of pages of summary judgment materials, and permitting what 
likely would be months of additional delay, was unnecessary, given that the merits of the issues were already briefed and there 
is a substantial interest in the judicial system in resolving cases, if appropriate, as here, sooner rather than later, at least where a 
case is now almost ten years old. Finally, the Court notes that Relators did not object to the procedure set forth in the Court's 
September 1, 2006 minute order directing Isley to file a conforming affidavit, if he was prepared to swear to the evidentiary 
submission."
656,3," For the purposes of Medicare reimbursement, BLS and ALS transports are distinguished by the respective credentials of the 
vehicle crew. OEI-12-99-00280 at 1. "
657,4," In the interests of completeness and precision, the Court notes the following. First, the Court's recitation of the factual material 
cited above in no way implies that any of the parties could reasonably have expected to receive reimbursement from any given 
patient, or any given percentage of the patient base generally, of the Hospital Defendants. As stated, many of the Hospital 
Defendants care for and treat individuals in the poorest areas of Chicagoland--e.g., Loretto Hospital is located in the Austin area 
of Chicago, on Chicago's West Side, and St. Bernard's Hospital is located at 64th Street and the Dan Ryan, in Chicago's 
Englewood neighborhood. See, e.g., Rummana Hussain, Racial Segregation Holds Firm Grip, Report Says, Chicago Sun-
Times, June 22, 2005 at 31. Second, the factual data recited above concerning likely times for payment of any accounts 
receivable for Part B transports may not have been applicable to ""Stat""--which was an ambulance transportation company that 
was purchased by Tower during the early 1990s. The record reflects at least some testimony that Stat, at least at its inception in 
the late 1980s, received payment from Medicare within fourteen days from the date of billing. (D.E. 301 P 58.)"
657,5," The record does not indicate that the Ambulance Defendants were able to bill-back the Hospital Defendants for unpaid Part B 
co-pays."
657,6," Relators have not attempted to delineate the market rates for ambulance transports in the relevant geographical areas during 
the relevant time period, making it difficult for Relators to contend or demonstrate that Medicare allowable rates were equivalent 
to market rates. Furthermore, Relators' Daubert motion did not object to the portion of Isley's report addressing this subject, and 
Relators have not introduced any evidence suggesting that, during the relevant time period, the Medicare allowable rate was 
equivalent to ""fair market value."" Instead, it appears that Relator's theory, seemingly derived from Werfel's advice to his 
ambulance clients, is that anything below the allowable rate violates the AKS. (See, e.g., D.E. 301 PP 136-37.) This theory does 
not seem to be supported in the actual record presented; moreover, and independently, it certainly does not constitute any 
evidence that the Defendant Hospitals committed any willful and knowing violation of any statute--which is the applicable 
scienter requirement. "
658,7," This requirement was made effective for hospitals' cost reporting periods ending on or after September 30, 1994. See 42 
C.F.R. § 413.24(f)(4)(iv). "
659,8," In fact, Relators do not cite to, and the Court's independent research did not reveal, a civil or criminal case involving the AKS in 
which a hospital was found liable or convicted for the sole act of accepting discounts on Part A services in exchange for Part B 
referrals. This is not to say that such a theory would be legally defective (if supported by a sufficient factual record, of course, 
which is not the case here); however, the factual scenario would be distinct from those often seen. "
660,9," Generally speaking, if Stat got a transport call from a hospital and was unable to do it, Stat would call another ambulance 
provider to see that the transportation was provided. (D.E. 301 P 116.) If the transport that was performed by the other 
ambulance provider on behalf of Stat was payable by Medicare, the substitute ambulance provider would bill Medicare directly. 
(Id. P 117.) For contract-rate transports performed by other providers, Stat would bill the hospital for the transport. (Id. P 118.) "
661,10," A hospital would have to ""take"" the discount by paying less than the invoice amount; the invoices were billed at the contract 
rate. (See, e.g.,. D.E. 294, Ex. 12-3 (St. Bernard invoice).)"
661,11," Relators routinely object to the use of summary tables in the Hospital Defendants' 56.1 Statement of Facts. See, e.g., D.E. 283 
P 2.) However, Relators have used a summary table to demonstrate Medicare Allowable rates during the relevant time period. If 
the Court struck all summary tables in the respective 56.1 Statements, then Relators would lack proof of an essential element of 
their case."
661,12," This is important because ""safe harbor"" requires that discounts be offered to Medicare or Medicaid, and Relators have little 
evidence with respect to Medicaid. "
662,13," Of the two relators, Messrs. Sharp and Klaczak, it does not appear that either played an active role in negotiating any of the 
relevant contracts with any of the Hospital Defendants. The closest involvement either Relator had in the negotiation process 
was Mr. Klaczak's going with Mr. Cybulski on some marketing calls to hospitals while at Stat. (D.E. 301 P 49.) The record does 
not suggest that Mr. Klaczak worked for Tower and Mr. Sharp testified that Mr. Klaczak did not work at CoMed. (See D.E. 294, 
Ex. 20 at 61-62) Mr. Sharp's business-related interactions with the Hospital Defendants while at Stat were limited to ""maybe 
[dropping] off some Dunkin Donuts or something like that,"" and he was never involved in sales pitches or contract negotiations. 
(Id. at 44.) Mr. Sharp's deposition does not suggest that he had any involvement in contract negotiations while at Tower or 
CoMed. (See generally id.) "
663,14," The Hospital Defendants have affirmatively stated without contradiction that they did not even know basic information about 
CoMed's business, such as its cost structure or the prices it charged Medicare and competing hospitals (see, e.g., D.E. 270 at 
31); there is no contention in the summary judgment papers that the Hospital Defendants were privy to internal CoMed 
discussions. "
664,15," Relators' objection is groundless--Senesac clearly testified as to St. James's belief that the flat rate was commercially 
reasonable based upon the close proximity of the facility and the ambulance barn. (See, e.g., D.E. 294, Ex. 68-69.)"
664,16," Relators object on the ground that St. James's Answers to Interrogatories states that St. James, starting in 1995, used only 
Daley's/CoMed. (D.E. 287 P 12.) However, the interrogatory only addresses St. James's use of CoMed services, and thus is not 
probative of the hospital's use of other transport companies. (See Interrogatory # 2 (""State the years during which the Hospital 
had CoMed perform ambulance transports on behalf of Hospital patients pursuant to any written or oral agreement. As to each 
such year, please state: (a) whether the agreement with CoMed was written or oral; (b) the terms of the agreement; and (c) the 
name, address, and job title of the person who had the main responsibility of negotiating the contract on behalf of the Hospital 
with CoMed."").) Furthermore, St. James's answer to Interrogatory No. 3 indicated that ""Beginning approximately 1995 through 
1997, CoMed was among the ambulance companies which St. James called upon, to perform individual ambulance services. 
There was no prior understanding that St. James would call CoMed."" (See D.E. 294, Ex. 19-2 (St. James's Answers to Relators' 
First Set of Interrogatories) at 2-3.) "
665,17," Relators repeatedly object to the use of summary tables in L.R. 56.1 Statements of Fact. (See, e.g., D.E. 283 P 2.) For 
reasons stated elsewhere, such objections are not well-taken. Moreover, in addition to the reasons previously cited, disallowing 
summary tables would result in bloated statements of fact as parties would need tens of paragraphs to establish what they 
otherwise could in a concise format. Furthermore, the Hospital Defendants are not using these summary tables as obfuscation in 
hope that Relators will miss an essential fact. See, e.g., Malec v. Sanford, 191 F.R.D. 581, 583 (N.D. Ill. 2000). "
666,18," Relators' objection to the use of summary charts is not well-taken for reasons discussed previously. Furthermore, if the Court 
determined that compounding of facts were impermissible, it would have to exclude all evidence with respect to the Medicare 
Allowable Rate, which Relators have also summarized in table form. (See, e.g., D.E. 290 P 156 (referencing Sparks's chart); id. 
P 173 (referencing Nagorka's chart).) The consequence of such an exclusion would be summary judgment for Defendants 
because Relators would have failed to offer proof on a basic element of the case."
666,19," Line 1 of the table (Part B - Contract Rate) is the difference between the Medicare allowable rate for ALS and the ""adjusted"" 
contract rate. In certain instances, this is a negative number because the adjusted contract rate was higher than the Medicare 
allowable rate. Line 2 of the table (Percentage explained) indicates how much the adjustment process closed the gap between 
the Medicare allowable rate and the unadjusted contract rate. For example, if the Medicare allowable rate was $ 150, the 
contract rate was listed as $ 100 on the rate sheet, and Peterson determined, because the contract shifted administrative costs 
and the hospital assumed debts when patients could not pay or Medicare denied coverage, that the adjusted rate was $ 140, the 
percentage explained line would be 80% (40/50). "
667,20," Relators deny this paragraph on the grounds that the contracts were exclusive. (D.E. 284 P 7.) However, none of the 
testimony cited by Relators addresses actual practice at Holy Cross and, in any event, the cited testimony is not inconsistent 
with the fact that, on occasion, Holy Cross had occasion to use other transport companies. Furthermore, Relators do not deny 
that Holy Cross had a preferred-provider agreement with Vandenburg that covered more than two years. (D.E. 254 P 9.)"
667,21," This was not an unreasonable concern, given, for example, the Supreme Court's decision in Arizona v. Maricopa County 
Medical Soc., 457 U.S. 332, 102 S. Ct. 2466, 73 L. Ed. 2d 48 (1982). "
672,22," Relators object because the CoMed contract includes a quick-pay discount (D.E. 286 P 10), but, consistent with Loretto's 
representation, the only Loretto contract in the record does not contain a quick-pay discount. (See D.E. 294, Ex. 1M.) "
674,23," Relators objection is not well-founded--Isley testified that the RFP process afforded Mt. Sinai information about the fair market 
value of transport services, which put them in a position to negotiate a better rate. (Isley Dep. at 47-48.) "
675,24," Relators object based upon Peterson's testimony (D.E. 294, Ex. 18 (Peterson Dep.) at 22-23), but Peterson does not 
reference any contract in particular, he did not prepare a report for Mt. Sinai, and his testimony does not contradict Mt. Sinai's 
understanding of the contract. Furthermore, Relators cite to Cybulski's deposition to prove that the contracts were exclusive, but 
Cybulski was only discussing the contract with Jackson Park. (Id. Ex. 7 (Cybulski Dep.) at 63-64.) No such paragraph exists in 
the 1992 contract with Daley's (D.E. 267, Ex. 1). Furthermore, the CoMed contract supports this understanding of the contract 
(D.E. 288 P 13) in its entirety. (Id., Ex. 2 P 12 (""HOSPITAL agrees to summon COMPANY first for all situations requiring 
ambulance services to and/or from HOSPITAL, except that such provision does not prohibit HOSPITAL from utilizing any 
ambulance service which may be required by a managed care or insurance payor. HOSPITAL has the right to utilize other 
ambulance services in the event that COMPANY is unable to provide prompt service for any patient or when an emergency 
situation dictates."").) Finally, Cybulski testified that the contract with Jackson Park did not obligate the hospital to call Stat, and 
that, even if it did, such a provision was unenforceable. (Id. at 64 (""Q: So if a patient a Jackson Park needed a transport during 
the term of this agreement, they would contact Stat for all those transports; is that correct? A: Yes. We would hope they would, 
but they don't have to, but we would hope they would. Q: Well, pursuant to the term of the agreement, it states that all transports 
would be. A: We have no way of knowing that if it did or didn't."").)"
675,25," Relators' objection to Hoekstra's affidavit is not well taken. Paragraph 2 affirms that the declaration is based on ""personal 
knowledge or information and belief after investigation."" (D.E. 267, Ex. B P 2.) The fact that he did not sign the contract is 
immaterial to whether he has a basis to testify after an investigation as to the circumstances surrounding the negotiations. "
676,26," Relators do not object to Philip Harder's deposition testimony that ""[St. Bernard's was] very heavily utilized by Medicaid and 
Medicare patients."" (D.E. 238, Harder Dep. at 27.) Furthermore, Relators' 56.1 Statement asserts that ""Medicaid was the highest 
volume of patients at St. Bernard Hospital, Medicare was the second highest volume, managed care was next in volume, patient 
self-pay was next in volume, then it would be private insurance."" (D.E. 301 P 93.)"
676,27," Relators' objection to this paragraph is not well-founded--St. Bernard's statement is supported by the cited deposition 
testimony."
676,28," Relators' objection to this paragraph is not well-founded--St. Bernard's statement is a direct quote from Harder's deposition 
testimony. (See D.E. 294, Ex. 12 (Harder Dep.) at 31 (""[Cybulski] shared verbally with me many times that [Stat] would 
exhaustively pursue all other payor sources and that appealed to me as a way to immediately bring that monthly cost down."").) "
677,29," Relators deny that the contracts made St. Bernard the payor of last resort, but do not deny that Harder believed (accurately or 
inaccurately) that St. Bernard was contractually obligated to be the payor of last resort. "
679,30," Trinity's 56.1 Statement of Facts appears to have erroneously transcribed Peterson's analysis of CoMed's Medicare Part B 
rates; the Court has noted the error and used Peterson's actual figures. (See D.E. 239, Peterson Trinity Report at 12-13.) "
680,31," This fact was admitted even though first contract date is January 1, 1996."
680,32, The contract is not dated and the 56.1 statements do not indicate the precise date. 
681,33,"  The Court applies Judge Andersen's legal rulings as rendered--consistent with precedent that addresses situations where one 
district court has inherited a case from another. In this regard, precedent teaches that the ""second judge in a case in which there 
has been a reassignment [is] to abide by the rulings of the first judge unless some new development, such as a new appellate "
682,," decision, convinces him that his predecessor's ruling was incorrect."" Fujisawa Pharm. Co., Ltd. v. Kapoor, 115 F.3d 1332, 1339 
(7th Cir. 1997); accord, e.g., Best v. Shell Oil Co., 107 F.3d 544, 546 (7th Cir. 1997) (similar, and stating that prior rulings should 
be disturbed only ""for compelling reasons (such as new controlling law or clear error).""). The Court has not been presented with 
any argument that Judge Andersen's rulings on the points addressed herein implicate such circumstances. In the interests of 
completeness, the Court notes that the United States filed a reconsideration motion concerning two discrete legal issues 
implicated by the claims it did not join. (D.E. 81) Specifically, the United States objected to Judge Andersen's determination that 
Relators would have to show that the government would not have paid a false claim if it knew of the alleged false statement, as 
opposed to a lower standard under the FCA that would merely require a showing that the alleged false statement was capable of 
inducing payment by the United States. (See id. at 4.) The United States also argued that Judge Andersen erred in his 
construction of the general FCA mens rea standard. (See id. at 5.) Judge Andersen later denied the United States' motion. (D.E. 
100.) None of the bases for the instant decision implicates the issues raised by the Government's Reconsideration motion, and 
the Court expresses no opinion on the propriety of Judge Andersen's rulings on those issues, which are not relevant for present 
purposes because the Court has determined that the Hospital Defendants did not violate the Anti-Kickback Statute, which is a 
necessary precondition for Relators' purported claims under the False Claims Act. (See D.E. 80 at 4-5.) "
683,34," The Court agreed to resolve the Hospital Defendants' threshold objections to Plaintiffs' proffered experts (e.g., that they were 
impermissibly attempting to testify to ultimate and impermissible legal conclusions in contravention of applicable precedent) 
because (1) if the challenges were found to be well-founded, it would obviate the need for the parties to expend considerable 
amounts of time and money concerning experts that would be secured by the defense and would offer different legal opinions; 
and (2) the Hospital Defendants' threshold challenges appeared to be largely well-taken. As a result, the Court resolved the 
threshold objections (which were the subject of extensive briefing, even as to address only those objections) and did not address 
further objections that the Hospital Defendants variously offered or suggested would be applicable to the Plaintiffs' experts. "
685,35," As previously explained (see footnote 34, supra), to make the issues more manageable and to promote a more thoughtful 
briefing and decision-making process, the Court directed that these issues would be resolved after the Hospital Defendants' prior 
objections to the Relators' proffered expert witnesses (e.g., that Mr. Nagorka was trying to impermissibly testify to ultimate legal 
conclusions) were resolved. "
686,36," In passing, Relators maintain that Nagorka's analysis is based upon his personal knowledge as well, but without any 
underlying data on market conditions, a speculative opinion would not assist the finder of fact. See, e.g., Zenith Elecs. Corp. v. 
WH-TV Broad. Corp., 395 F.3d 416, 419-20 (7th Cir. 2005)."
686,37," As previously mentioned, most of Nagorka's testimony was excluded as being improper legal testimony under Seventh Circuit 
law. To the extent it is material, the Court incorporates by reference its discussion and reasoning from its prior 26-page opinion 
discussing Nagorka and Ms. Sparks. (D.E. 204.) "
687,38," The Seventh Circuit's opinion in Fuesting v. Zimmer, Inc., 421 F.3d 528 (7th Cir. 2005) was modified on other grounds in 
Fuesting v. Zimmer, Inc., 448 F.3d 936 (7th Cir. 2006). The subsequent modification is not germane here. "
689,39," Mt. Sinai observed the same defect in Relators' motion in its response to Relators' motion, to which Relators declined to file a 
reply. (See D.E. 298 at 2 (""While Relators focus on the underlying framework for Isley's expert opinions, they ignore the opinions 
themselves"").)"
689,40," Isley's uncontradicted opinions in the record concerning the Medicare allowable rate for ambulance transports are: (1) during 
the 1990s, the Rates for Part B ambulance transports experienced unexplained and wide variances and did not consistently hold 
to any clear business principles (D.E. 294, Ex. 13A at 8); (2) Medicare's methodology of payment based on historical charges 
allowed providers operating in overlapping service areas to be reimbursed at different rates (id at 14); and (3) during the 1990s, 
hospitals could not have been reasonably expected to calculate fair market value based upon Medicare's allowable rates (id at 
16-17.) (The Court notes that Dr. Isley's testimony does not suggest that this situation persists today.) All of these conclusions 
are derivative of Dr. Isley's professional and economic expertise. (See D.E. 298, Ex. 3 at 4.) Furthermore, these opinions are 
supported by OIG's assessment of Medicare payments for ambulance transports. "
690,41," Relators also have a related claim under the Illinois Whistleblower Reward and Protection Act (""IWRPA""), 740 ILCS 175/3. 
(D.E. 85 PP 85-90.) In moving for summary judgment, the Hospital Defendants have also sought summary judgment on any 
IWRPA claims, noting that those claims rely on essentially the same theory as Relators' AKS claims. (D.E. 270 at 10 n.4.) The 
Seventh Circuit has repeatedly instructed that ""summary judgment is the 'put up or shut up' moment in a lawsuit,"" such that the 
non-movant's failure to identify a triable case when challenged justifies summary judgment dismissal of the claim. Koszola v. Bd. 
of Ed. of City of Chicago, 385 F.3d 1104, 1111 (7th Cir. 2004) (collecting cases; further internal quotation marks and citations 
omitted). Relators here have not offered any basis or argument concerning the IWRPA claims beyond those offered on their 
AKS claims, so the Court considers waived any further argument about specific bases that might save any IWRPA claim beyond 
those actually offered by the Plaintiffs concerning the AKS claims. The Court also finds the Relators' defense, as argued with 
respect to the AKS, to be unpersuasive for all of the reasons stated in this opinion. "
692,42," The Defendant Hospitals certainly have a good, and perhaps compelling, argument that the Medicare regulatory regime, as 
applicable to this case, involves technical statutes and regulations. Moreover, the Defendant hospitals have a legitimate 
argument that the case could present the danger of ensnaring individuals engaged in apparently innocent--as one might 
understand a cash-strapped urban hospital to be undertaking when it seeks lower-cost services for its patient base without any 
of its employees accepting or soliciting any personal remuneration in the process. Again, though, the question of whether a 
potentially more defendant-friendly standard for ""willfully"" applies is not material, as Relators' case, on the record they have 
assembled, fails under any standard, including the more Relator-friendly standard applied herein. "
693,43," Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7(a)-(j), the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services may exclude a 
provider from any Federal health care program as a sanction for violation of the AKS. Given the Hospital Defendants' patient-
payor mix, it appears that exclusion from Medicare or Medicaid would have a devastating effect on their already-strained 
finances. "
695,44," This testimony was from Defendants' expert Bernard Patashnik, who, for ten years, was the Director, Division of Medical 
Services Payment, for the federal Health Care Financing Agency (HCFA) (now the Center for Medicare Services). "
699,45," ""An OIG advisory opinion is a legal opinion issued by the Office of Inspector General (""OIG"") to one or more requesting parties 
about the application of the OIG's fraud and abuse authorities to the party's existing or proposed business arrangement. An OIG 
advisory opinion is legally binding on the Department of Health and Human Services (the ""Department"") and the requesting party 
or parties. It is not binding on any other governmental department or agency. A party that receives a favorable advisory opinion 
is protected from OIG administrative sanctions, so long as the arrangement at issue is conducted in accordance with the facts 
submitted to the OIG. However, no person or entity can rely on an advisory opinion issued to someone else."" See HHS Office of 
the Inspector General, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About the Advisory Opinion Process (available at 
http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/advisoryopinions/aofaq.html) (last visited September 29, 2006). "
701,46," The aforementioned discussion immediately above does not assume that the Hospital Defendants, as a matter of fact, 
believed that the contracts were protected by the statutory exception for discounts or the discount safe harbor provided in the 
regulations. The Hospital Defendants have not built an adequate record in that respect and Relators, in turn, have not built a 
record that forecloses this possibility--consistent with the otherwise-divorced-from-the-evidentiary-record nature of Relators' 
argument that the contracts themselves and the certification reports alone establish putative liability. Rather, to the extent that 
Relators maintain that a hospital administrator must have known that the contracts were an illegal kickback arrangement, 
Relators have failed to discredit a variety of reasonable explanations why the Hospital Defendants believed that the cost reports "
702,," were compliant with the AKS. If there are numerous legitimate counter-inferences to draw from the Hospital Defendants' 
certification of the cost reports, Relators' argument, which is based upon eliminating legitimate explanations for the Hospital 
Defendants' conduct, fails to persuade."
702,47," St. Bernard filed a supplemental brief that was joined by the three Advocate hospitals (Bethany, South Suburban, and Trinity). 
(See D.E. 237). "
705,48," Relators objections with respect to Hoekstra's affidavit is overruled as baseless. With respect to Relators' other objection, 
Relators identify a June 2, 1997 letter from Cybulski to Miller that offered less than what Mt. Sinai ultimately received in order to 
settle the billing dispute. (See D.E. 288 P 31.) However, the contract that Mt. Sinai maintains resolved the billing dispute was not 
signed until December 27, 1997. It thus appears that Cybulski's letter confirms that CoMed was negotiating to resolve past 
overbilling, and that this was an early offer that was later supplanted by the retroactive application of the contracted rates from 
the December 27, 1997 contract. See D.E. 267 PP 30-31.) "
707,49," Bethany Hospital has not adduced specific arguments that further warrant summary judgment on its behalf. Nonetheless, it 
joined the general summary judgment briefing submitted on behalf of all of the Hospital Defendants and sought summary 
judgment on such bases. Thus, while Bethany does not have individualized reasons further and independently justifying 
summary judgment, as is the case with the other individual Hospital Defendants, summary judgment is nonetheless warranted 
for the global reasons explained above. "
717,1," Each claim is styled: ""First Cause of Action,"" ""Second Cause of Action,"" etc. I find it easier to refer to the claims as ""Count I,"" 
""Count II,"" etc. "
718,2," The complaints differ slightly in which record companies and motion picture studios are named as defendants. These 
differences do not affect the analysis."
718,3," I cite factual allegations in the form of ""Compl. P    ,"" referring to the Second Amended Complaint in 05-cv-118. I mean thereby 
to refer to the corresponding factual allegation (numbered differently) in the First Amended Complaint (05-cv-149) as well."
718,4," By this term, Deep says that he means ""major labels, studios and distributors,"" Compl. P Intro., referring to businesses that 
produce prerecorded music or movies and distribute them, id. PP 314-15."
718,5," This is a narrower description than Judge Aspen provided in 2002: Aimster is a file sharing service that allows its members to identify large numbers of similarly situated users with whom they 
can transfer files in encrypted form and send instant messages. Aimster is the brain child of Defendant John A. Deep, who 
also founded Defendant BuddyUSA, Inc. . . . to develop the software and Defendant AbovePeer, Inc. . . . to operate the 
system . . . . In re Aimster Copyright Litig., 252 F. Supp. 2d 634, 638 (N.D. Ill. 2002). "
719,," According to Deep, Aimster performs two fundamental functions. First, it allows its users to send messages or transfer files 
to other users by facilitating the creation of direct user-to-user (or peer-to-peer) networks. Through the use of encryption 
technology contained within the Aimster software, the individual users are assured of complete privacy in their online 
transaction. . . . Aimster's second fundamental function, according to Deep, is to allow users to identify other ""buddies"" who 
have similar interests and who may wish to correspond and exchange files. Id. at 641 (citations omitted). Judge Aspen preliminarily, enjoined the use of Aimster because of copyright infringement. The 
Seventh Circuit affirmed. In re Aimster Copyright Litig., 334 F.3d 643 (7th Cir. 2003)."
719,6," Deep alleges that Bill Duker is a disbarred lawyer and convicted felon, Compl. P 152, and was also involved with Amici LLC 
and other Boies-Schiller related ventures, id. P 247."
719,7," Here, Deep seems to be accusing Higgins of taking a corporate opportunity that appropriately belonged to Trans World. But 
sometimes Deep refers to the arrangements as benefiting Trans World."
719,8," The assertion is confusing because Deep describes Aimster as an unincorporated joint venture between him and Trans World, 
but describes Boies's ownership as a 15% option that was exercised. From other allegations I am aware that Deep has other 
companies and does not always distinguish between his and his corporations' ownership interests. The stock ownership alleged 
here is probably in BuddyUSA, Inc. See Compl. P 153 ff."
719,9," According to the Lawyers' response, it was a trademark dispute (allegedly the first three letters of ""Aimster"" stand for AOL 
Instant Messaging), and ultimately resulted in a name change to Madster. Lawyers Mot. to Dismiss Compl. with Incorporated 
Mem. of Law (""Lawyers Mem."") at 5 (Docket Item 56). "
720,10," This is the litigation mentioned in note 5, supra."
720,11," The federal claims are: fraud on the court (Count I); antitrust violations (Counts II-III); bankruptcy violations (Count V); 
Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) violations (Count VI); and Sarbanes-Oxley Act violations (Count 
VII). The New York claims are: deceptive acts and practices and state antitrust violations (Count IV); breach of fiduciary duty 
(Count VIII); breach of contract (Count IX); negligence (Count X); aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty (Count XI); 
conspiracy (Count XII); tortious inference with contract (Count XIII); piercing the corporate veil (Count XIV); declaratory and 
injunctive relief (Count XV); and constructive trust for unjust enrichment (Count XVI). "
721,12," This assertion is in P 372, part of Deep's anti-trust claim. But in his opposition to the motion, he characterizes it as part of the 
fraud claim. Pl. Opp'n to Mot. to Dismiss (""Opp'n"") at 12 (Docket Item 57)."
721,13," The few authorities to address the issue are split on whether a plaintiff can bring an independent damages action for fraud on 
the court. Compare Bezanson v. Gaudette (In re R & R Assoc.), 248 B.R. 1, 6 (Bankr. D.N.H. 2000) (""[M]ost courts have ruled 
that jurisdiction is limited to granting relief from the judgment or order.""); Chewning v. Ford Motor Co., 35 F. Supp. 2d 487, 491 
(D.S.C. 1998) (""[No authority] suggest[s] the existence of an independent action for damages.""); Andersen v. Roszkowski, 681 
F. Supp. 1284, 1292 (N.D. Ill. 1988) (""[T]his Court does not have subject-matter jurisdiction to award money damages for fraud 
on the court.""), aff'd 894 F.2d 1338 (7th Cir. 1990) (unpublished order) with Chmil v. Rulisa Operating Co. (In re Tudor Assocs.), 
1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20945, 1990 WL 546146, *7 (E.D.N.C. Apr. 30, 1990) (affirming bankruptcy court's decision to impose 
equitable lien on creditor's claim and award damages, after creditor committed fraud on court in underlying bankruptcy petition); 
Robinson v. Volkswagenwerk AG, 56 F.3d 1268, 1273, 1274 n.6 (10th Cir. 1995) (stating that party can ""obtain relief from a 
fraudulently obtained judgment"" by filing ""an independent action for damages,"" but also affirming district court's conclusion that 
""plaintiffs could not pursue their claims for damages without first obtaining relief from the judgment""). Because I conclude that 
Deep has not shown a fraud on the court, I do not address the availability of damages. "
722,14," Trans World was a defendant in the In re Compact Disc Litigation. It did not share in the settlement proceeds, but contributed 
to them. In re Compact Disc Litig., MDL No. 1361, 2003 WL 21685581, *2 (D. Me. Jul. 18, 2003)."
722,15," Contrary to the assertions of Compl. PP 281-90, there is no fraud upon the court in the July 15, 2005, letter to me docketed as 
Docket Item 19 in 05-cv-118. As the letter states, Boies, Schiller & Flexner LLP is not counsel of record for Trans World in the 
current lawsuits."
722,16," Deep asserts that in that case BuddyUSA (one of his companies) had an interest adverse to his own, Compl. P 172, and that 
Trans World was a significant shareholder in BuddyUSA, id. P 173. He says that the Lawyers represented him, not Trans World, 
in that court. Id. PP 172-75. "
723,17," I am aware of authority suggesting that bankruptcy court practice has a higher standard because the bankruptcy rules require 
detailed written disclosure before a lawyer can be appointed by the court. See Fed. R. Bankr. P. 2014 (bankruptcy lawyer's 
application for employment by estate must state ""to the best of the applicant's knowledge, all of the [lawyer's] connections with 
the debtor, creditors, any other party in interest, their respective attorneys and accountants, the United States trustee, or any 
person employed in the office of the United States trustee""). Pearson v. First N.H. Mortgage Corp., 200 F.3d 30, 38 (1st Cir. 
1999); see also In re eToys, Inc., 331 B.R. 176 (Bankr. D. Del. 2005); Bezanson v. Gaudette (In re R & R Assoc.), 248 B.R. 1 
(Bankr. D.N.H. 2000). Deep has not asserted that the Lawyers ran afoul of this standard in their bankruptcy representation in the 
Northern District of New York."
723,18, Deep also adds at P 225 the undisclosed conflict of representing Trans World in In re Compact Disc Litigation. 
724,19," HN6[

includes filings in other cases. See In re Colonial Mortgage Bankers Corp., 324 F.3d at 16-17 (looking to complaint filed in other

724,20," In his opposition, Deep argues that the Record and Movie Companies are implicated in allegations of fraud on the court. Opp'n 
at 11-12. But his arguments are based on vague assertions of ""collusion,"" and they do not change the fact that his complaints 
fail to allege any conduct by the Record and Movie Companies that could constitute fraud on the court (except for a conclusory 
assertion that they were part of an ""inducement of or conspiracy in the fraud. . . ."" Compl. P 311."

] These factors are: (1) the causal connections between the alleged antitrust violation and the harm to the plaintiff; (2) an improper motive; (3) 
the nature of the plaintiff's alleged injury and whether the injury was of a type that Congress sought to redress with the 
antitrust laws (""antitrust injury""); (4) the directness with which the alleged market restraint caused the asserted injury; (5) 
the speculative nature of the damages; and (6) the risk of duplicative recovery or complex apportionment of damages. Serpa Corp., 199 F.3d at 10."
726,23," Deep has alleged on the one hand that Trans World is a co-conspirator of the Record and Music Companies, see id. PP 318-
19, and on the other hand that it was coerced by the Record and Music Companies (rather than voluntarily agreeing) to do what 
it did, id. P 351. If Trans World was a co-conspirator, Deep was a would-be supplier to an antitrust violator that ""in the course of 
its own violation allegedly breached its agreement to use"" Deep's technology. As such, he has no standing. SAS of Puerto Rico, 
48 F.3d at 44. Alternatively, if Deep's theory is that Trans World was a victim of the record companies' conspiracy, Deep 
nevertheless lacks standing. See id. (HN13[
] a ""supplier who suffers because an antitrust violation curtails a business that 
would otherwise have purchased from [it]"" has not ""suffered antitrust injury"") (internal quotation marks omitted)."
726,24," Deep does allege that he formed an unincorporated joint venture with Trans World. Compl. P 31, Opp'n at 22 ff. But as I 
explain in text later, in dismissing the breach of fiduciary claim, Deep has not set forth adequate factual allegations to support his "
727,," assertion that Deep and Trans World were engaged in a joint venture. As a result, Deep cannot be characterized as a competitor 
in the market for online distribution of music. "
728,25," It is unclear from Deep's complaint if he is alleging only a violation of 1962(d) or a violation of 1962(c) and (d). The defendants 
read Deep's complaint as alleging only a violation of 1962(d). Though the defendants' reading is reasonable, I treat his complaint 
as alleging both a substantive violation of 1962(c) and a conspiracy claim under 1962(d). In any event, the defendants' motions 
to dismiss clearly argue that Deep has failed to allege the necessary elements to satisfy a claim under both 1962(c) and (d). 
Record & Movie Cos. Mem. at 23-29; Lawyers Mem. at 9-10; Trans World Mem. at 30. "
729,26," Deep also cites 18 U.S.C. § 1342 (unlawful use of fictitious name or address) and § 1349 (definition of ""scheme or artifice to 
defraud"") in his mail and wire fraud allegations. Compl. P 467(a). Whatever these claims may have been, Deep has waived 
them. Opp'n at 30 (Deep only refers to §§ 1341, 1343)."
729,27," HN22[
] The Second Circuit has said: ""Where multiple defendants are asked to respond to allegations of fraud, the complaint 
should inform each defendant of the nature of his alleged participation in the fraud."" DiVitorrio v. Equidyne Extractive Industries, 
Inc., 822 F.2d 1242, 1247 (2d Cir. 1987). The First Circuit seems to agree. See Romani v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, 929 F.2d 
875, 880 n.4 (1st Cir. 1991). "
730,28," One possible interpretation is that Trans World fraudulently wired funds to the other defendants, the Labels and Studios, in 
furtherance of its RICO conspiracy against Deep. But Deep alleges that the first such transfer occurred in October 2000, which is 
at a time before he had even engaged Attorney David Boies (November 2000, id. P 89,) to negotiate the relationship with Trans 
World. Thus, this reading makes no sense. Another interpretation is that Deep is describing wire transfers that Trans World made directly to him in order to gain control of 
his targeted marketing method. Such an interpretation, although slightly more comprehensible, fails to raise any recognizable 
RICO claim against the defendants. The assertion would be that the money Trans World transferred to Deep was ""an investment 
at least in part of racketeering income from kickbacks paid to Trans World by the Labels and Studios."" Id. P 450. But the 
complaint fails to account for how such a transfer of kickback funds to Deep injured Deep. Fortunately, I am not required to act as a mind reader. Feinstein, 942 F.2d at 44. "
731,29," Even had Deep responded in his opposition, his complaint fails to state a claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1951. HN27[
] ""Extortion"" 
is defined as ""the obtaining of property from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, 
violence, or fear, or under color of official right."" 18 U.S.C. § 1951(b)(2). Deep does not allege that the defendants obtained 
property from him with his consent or that they wrongfully used ""actual or threatened force, violence, or fear,"" or ""color of official 
right"" to do so. Thus, his extortion allegation fails."
731,30," Deep's obstruction of justice allegations in P 467(h), standing alone, are almost entirely incoherent. My best understanding is 
that sections (i) & (iii) are referring to the allegations regarding the 2001 Department of Justice investigation outlined in PP 178-
85 of the Second Amended Complaint. To the extent that he is referring to anything else, I DISMISS the allegations for failure to 
meet the heightened pleading standard for a civil RICO claim. Bessette, 230 F.3d at 450. I also do not address P 467(h)(ii), 
obstruction of justice in In re Compact Disc Litigation, for the reasons set forth above, dismissing similar claims for fraud upon 
the court. "
733,31," Deep makes no reference whatsoever in his opposition to ""tortious interference,"" ""piercing the corporate veil,"" ""declaratory and 
injunctive relief,"" or negligence. His only references whatsoever to ""conspiracy"" are found within his discussion of antitrust and 
RICO claims. "
734,32," In his opposition, Deep argues that he was a party to the contract in his individual capacity, and not just as a representative of 
BuddyUSA. Opp'n at 7. To prove this, he ""attach[es] and swear[s] to an exhibit of a different signature page showing that [he] did 
in fact sign as a party personally to the agreement."" Id. (emphasis removed). This signature page, submitted as Ex. 6 to Deep's 
Declaration in Support of Motion for Order to Show Cause Re Sanctions (Docket Item 4), contains John Deep's signature as 
President of BuddyUSA, Inc. In addition, the operational provisions of the entire Securities Purchase Agreement contract refer 
consistently to ""the Company"" and ""BuddyUSA, Inc.,"" not to Deep. There is no basis to conclude that Deep personally has any 
rights under the contract. "
735,33," As I have already discussed, I may properly consider the contract itself in a breach of contract claim, although it is outside the 
pleadings. Diva's Inc., 411 F.3d at 38. "
736,34," Deep also alleges that the Lawyers subsequently held Duker out as a reputable attorney somehow affiliated with them, and 
that Duker gave Deep legal advice. Id. PP 262-80. There are serious contradictions inherent in Deep's assertion that he believed 
Duker to be an agent of his negotiating adversary, yet simultaneously also believed him to be a trustworthy adviser. But even if 
the Lawyers and Duker induced Deep to trust Duker in his capacity as a lawyer somehow affiliated with Deep's lawyers, not in 
his capacity as an agent of Trans World, this would not cause Deep to repose trust and confidence in Trans World. "
738,35," Diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C § 1332, is lacking, for Deep is a citizen of New York, Compl. P 31, and at least the Lawyers are 
also citizens of New York, see id. PP 61-63."
738,36," The Lawyers also argue that I must abstain under 28 U.S.C. § 1334(c)(2), and that I should decline to exercise supplemental 
jurisdiction over the state law claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3). Lawyers Mem. at 11-15. Because I decide to abstain as a 
matter of discretion under § 1334(c)(1), I do not reach these issues."
738,37," The state complaint against the Lawyers focuses on malpractice, negligence, conflicts of interest, and misappropriation of the 
Aimster asset, and names an additional defendant, William Duker. "
739,38," Two of the cases are in this court and the subject of this very Order. The third case is in the Northern District of New York: 
Deep v. Boies, No. 05-cv-1187 (N.D.N.Y. 2005). The fourth case is in New York Supreme Court, Albany County: Deep v. Boies, 
No. 6453-05 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2005)."
739,39," The Lawyers objected to Deep's Notice of the recent decision In re Napster, Inc. Copyright Litigation, 235 F.R.D. 463 (N.D. 
Cal. 2006), arguing that the case was not relevant; Deep responded. See Pl.'s Notice of Recent Decision (Docket 71); Lawyers 
Objection to Pl.'s Notice of Recent Decision (Docket Item 72); Pl.'s Response to Lawyers Objection (Docket Item 73). I hereby 
overrule the objection. While I agree that recent cases brought to the attention of the court should be relevant to the issue at 
hand, it is not necessary to strike or disregard Deep's notice. "
740,40," Judge Littlefield did not state that the denial was with prejudice, and some of his words suggest that he believed that the 
motion to enforce the automatic stay might have some merit under different circumstances. see id. (""I can understand Mr. 
Deep's concern that in effect property of the chapter 13 estate is being transferred without court authority. That's another issue 
for a different day or different complaint heading or a different pleading, not the pleading that's before me."")"
740,41," Since neither side refers to the safe harbor provisions of Rule 11(c), I assume that they have been satisfied or waived. "
741,42," I do not permit Deep to amend his complaints further under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15. He has already amended both complaints once 
in this court, and he also amended the 05-cv-118 complaint once before its MDL transfer here. See Am. Compl., Deep v. 
Recording Indus. Ass'n of America, Inc., No. 05-cv-205 (N.D.N.Y. Feb. 16, 2005). Additionally, as I have already noted, Deep 
has an extensive litigation history. Except for the issues I have left for state court, it is time for these matters to come to an end. "
744,1," At the Rule 16(b) Scheduling Conference on July 27, 2006, the court stated that it would treat the defendants' proposed 
scheduling order as a motion to stay and to bifurcate discovery."
744,2," ""Copper plumbing tubes"" is defined in the complaint as copper water, heating and gas tubes that go into residental and 
commercial buildings. The term includes both plain and copper plumbing tubes and plastic-coated copper plumbing tubes. (Am. 
Compl. ¶5.) ""Copper Tubing"" is defined in the consolidated amended complaint as including ""plain copper plumbing tubes as 
well as pastice-coated tubes used for such things as the delivery of water, heating and gas in buildings."" (Consol. Am. Compl. 
¶5.) "
745,3," KME America amended its answer on July 13, 2006. "
764,1," The Defendants have submitted two omnibus briefs, one on behalf of a group of insurance brokers (the ""Broker Defendants""), 
and one on behalf of a group of insurance carriers (the ""Insurer Defendants"") (collectively, ""the Defendants""). Several 
Defendants have also filed supplemental briefs, in which they expressly adopted the Brokers and Insurers' arguments, and set 
forth additional arguments for dismissal. This Opinion addresses both the omnibus and the individual motions. "
765,2," A group of Insurer Defendants has moved to strike the allegations of the Employee-Benefits Complaint concerning property 
and casualty insurance as immaterial and impertinent pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f). This motion is denied. The Court will 
consider Defendants' arguments as they relate to the sufficiency of the Complaint."
765,3," The following is a summary of Plaintiffs' allegations as set forth in the Commercial and the Employee-Benefits Complaints. The 
Court repeats these allegations for present purposes, but makes no findings of fact as to any of Plaintiffs' claims. "
768,4," As clarified by Plaintiffs at oral argument, Plaintiffs ""[do not] have bid-rigging allegations against each and every defendant in 
this case"" and only purport to assert bid-rigging against Defendants Aon, Gallagher, HRH, Marsh, ULR, Willis, ACE, AIG, Chubb, 
CNA, Fireman's Fund, Hartford, Munich, St. Paul Travelers, and UnumProvident. See July 26, 2006 Transcript of Oral Argument 
(""Tr."") at 54; Plaintiffs' August 4, 2006 Submission at 2. This does not preclude, however, other Defendants from being named 
as participants in bid-rigging if and when there is a good faith factual basis to support it. As set forth in the Complaints and at oral argument, the gist of Plaintiffs' contention is that there were two primary schemes for 
suppressing competition in the insurance market - ""bid-rigging"" and ""steering."" In subsequent correspondence, Plaintiffs appear 
to restate their theory as a conspiracy to allocate customers using a variety of manipulative devices, including ""bid- rigging."" For 
current purposes, this is a distinction without importance. "
769,5," While the Employee-Benefits Complaint asserts ERISA claims on behalf of both the 'Employer-Plaintiffs and the Employee-
Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs have expressly withdrawn the ERISA claims brought on behalf of the Employer-Plaintiffs. See Plaintiffs' 
Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the Employee-Benefits Complaint at 60 n.32. "
771,6," The mere fact that the alleged steering and bid-rigging practices may be anti-competitive or illegal does not remove them from 
the ""business of insurance."" As the Third Circuit noted in Sabo v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, ""the language and 
purpose of the Act speak not of legal insurance transactions, but instead seek to allow states to regulate and enforce the 
insurance business without fear of unintended federal interference … if we were to construe the 'business of insurance' phrase 
by reference to federal legality, the statute would be read out of existence."" 137 F.3d 185, 192 (3d Cir. 1998); see also Royal 
Drug, 440 U.S. at 210 (""Whether the Agreements are illegal under the antitrust laws is an entirely separate question, not now 
before us."") (emphasis in original); Hartford, 509 U.S. at 782 n.10 (""The activities in question here, of course, are alleged to 
violate federal law, and it might be tempting to think that unlawful acts are implicitly excluded from the 'business of insurance.' 
Yet [the MFA]'s grant of immunity assumes that acts which, but for that grant, would violate the Sherman Act … are part of the 
'business of insurance.'"")."
771,7," Defendants argue that contingent commission agreements are part of the business of insurance because they relate to the 
policy relationship between the insurer and the insured; that rate-fixing constitutes the business of insurance. "
772,8," The fact that the transfer of risk allegedly occurs as part of a fraudulent scheme does not alter the analysis. See Royal Drug, 
440 U.S. at 214 n. 12 (distinguishing between ""risk underwriting"" and ""risk reduction""). The court does note, however, that these 
practices are claimed to interfere with the operation of normal market forces, thereby reducing the probability of risk to the 
insurance carriers that is not integrally related to ""risk underwriting."""
772,9," Because the Court finds that the alleged practices are not ""the business of insurance,"" and thus do not fit within the McCarran-
Ferguson exemption, the Court need not consider whether the practices are ""regulated by state law"" and whether the 
Complaints adequately alleges conduct constituting an agreement to, or an act of ""boycott, coercion or intimidation."" See 15 
U.S.C. § 1012(b). "
773,10," The Court finds that Plaintiffs have alleged, at this stage of the litigation, sufficient antitrust injury to establish standing under 
the Sherman Act. ""Private plaintiffs pursuing claims under § 1 have standing when they suffer an antitrust injury that is causally 
related to the defendants' allegedly illegal anti-competitive activity."" Eichorn v. AT & T Corp., 248 F.3d 131, 140 (3d Cir. 2001) 
(citing Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 489, 97 S. Ct. 690, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977)). Plaintiffs must 
allege an injury ""of the type for which the antitrust laws were intended to provide redress."" Angelico v. Lehigh Valley Hospital, 
Inc., 184 F.3d 268, 274 (3d Cir. 1998). Here, Plaintiffs allege that ""the actions of the Defendants were all part of the same conspiracy to increase revenues and to 
suppress or eliminate competition."" Comm. Compl. P 407; EB Compl. P 325. They claim that as a result of the alleged 
conspiracy, the ""prices paid by plaintiffs and Class members for insurance were raised, maintained or stabilized at artificially 
high, supra-competitive levels."" Comm. Compl. P 532; EB Compl. P 451 (alleging that Defendants' conduct had ""the effect of 
inflating premiums above competitive levels.""). As the Third Circuit has stated, albeit in a different context, ""[i]t is difficult to 
imagine a more formidable demonstration of antitrust injury"" than supra-competitive overcharges. In re Warfarin Sodium Antitrust 
Litig., 214 F.3d 395, 400 (3d Cir. 2000). Assuming the truth of Plaintiffs' allegations for purposes of the instant motion. Plaintiffs 
have properly alleged, for standing purposes, that Defendants' conduct has ""a wider impact on the competitive market."" Eichorn, 
248 F.3d at 140."
773,11," Rule 9(b) provides: ""In all averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with 
particularity. Malice, intent, knowledge, and other condition of mind of a person may be averred generally."" "
775,12," The Employee-Benefits Complaint alleges the existence of at least three broker-centered conspiracies: (1) ""A ULR-centered 
conspiracy consisting of defendant ULR and the insurance companies with which it had Contingent Commission arrangements, 
including defendants UnumProvident, CIGNA, Prudential, MetLife and Hartford and others (the ""ULR-centered Broker 
Conspiracy""); (2) ""A Marsh-centered conspiracy consisting of Marsh and the insurance companies with which it had Contingent "
776,," Commission arrangements, including defendant [sic] MetLife, Cigna, AIG, ACE, Hartford and others (the ""Marsh-centered Broker 
Conspiracy""); (3) ""A Aon-centered conspiracy consisting of Aon and the insurance companies with which it had Contingent 
Commission arrangements, including defendant [sic] MetLife, ACE, AIG, Cigna, Hartford, Metlife [sic], UnumProvident and 
others (the ""Aon-centered Broker Conspiracy""). EB Compl. P 339."
776,13," Defendants argue that the McCarran-Ferguson Act precludes Plaintiffs' RICO claims under both the second, antitrust-specific 
sentence of § 1012(b), as well as the first clause of § 1012(b). The second clause of § 1012(b) deals specifically with antitrust 
immunity, whereas the first clause applies to federal laws more generally. As the statute itself makes clear, the two clauses are 
two distinct provisions, which apply in different situations. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' RICO claims are properly analyzed under the 
first clause of § 1012(b). The first clause of § 1012(b) provides: "
777,," ""No Act of Congress shall be construed to invalidate, impair, or supersede any law enacted by any State for the purpose of 
regulating the business of insurance, or which imposes a fee or tax upon such business, unless such Act specifically relates 
to the business of insurance."" 15 U.S.C. § 1012(b). In determining whether Plaintiffs' RICO claims are barred under § 1012(b), the ""threshold question"" is ""whether the challenged 
conduct broadly constitutes the 'business of insurance' in the first place."" Sabo v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 137 F.3d 185, 190 
(3d Cir. 1998) (quoting National Securities, 393 U.S. at 459-60) (""only when [insurance companies] are engaged in the business 
of insurance does the act apply."") (internal quotation marks omitted); accord Highmark, Inc. v. UPMC Health Plan, Inc., 276 F.3d 
160, 166 (3d Cir. 2001) (citing Sabo, 137 F.3d at 190). ""If the Defendant's conduct does not constitute 'the business of 
insurance,' then there is no need to confront preclusion issues under § 1012(b)."" Sabo, 137 F.3d at 190. For the reasons 
discussed above, the Court finds that the practices at issue here are not ""the business of insurance."" The McCarran-Ferguson 
preemption analysis of the second clause of § 1012(b) is therefore inapplicable to Plaintiffs' RICO claims."
777,14," Likewise, the Employee-Benefits Complaint alleges the existence of an ""Employee- Benefits Insurance Enterprise"" and 
alternatively, of three ""Broker-centered Employee Benefits Enterprises."" EB Compl. PP 345, 354. To the extent that Plaintiffs' 
RICO allegations contained in the two complaints are similar, the Court's analysis with respect to the Commercial Insurance 
Enterprise and the Broker-centered Commercial Enterprises shall apply with equal force to the Employee-Benefits Insurance 
Enterprise and the Broker-centered Employee Benefits Enterprises. "
778,15," When asked by the Court at oral argument to define the enterprise, Plaintiffs' Counsel stated: ""The enterprise would be all the 
insurance companies who enter into contingent fee agreements, all the brokers who receive compensation using these types of 
agreements, all of the industry groups that have allowed facilitation of discussions and decision-making relating to those 
contingent fee agreements."" Tr. at 83. "
779,16," Similarly, with respect to the Broker-Centered Enterprises, the Complaints states: ""Broker-Centered Enterprises have an 
ascertainable structure separate and apart from the pattern of racketeering activity in which Defendants have engaged."" Comm. 
Compl. P 448; EB Compl. P 359 (""The Broker-centered Employee-Benefits Enterprises have an ascertainable structure separate 
and apart from the pattern of racketeering activity in which Defendants have engaged.""). "
780,17," Although Plaintiffs' mail and wire fraud allegations fail to meet the strict and rigorous pleading requirements of Rule (9b), the 
Court does not reach that issue because of the deficiencies in their enterprise allegations."
780,18," Plaintiffs' ERISA claims are brought under ERISA's fiduciary duty provisions and predicated upon the finding of fiduciary 
status. See generally ERISA § 404, 29 U.S.C. § 1104 (specifying duties of a ""fiduciary with respect to a plan""). At oral argument, 
Plaintiffs' Counsel also invoked ERISA § 406, 29 U.S.C. § 1106, and maintained that even if the Court finds that the Insurer 
Defendants are not fiduciaries, the Defendants could still be liable under ERISA § 406 as parties in interest. Tr. at 88-89. 
However, paragraph 539 of the Complaint references § 406 as a means of breach of fiduciary duty and not as an independent 
basis for ERISA liability. The Complaint nowhere alleges that the Defendants are ""parties in interest."" See EB Compl. PP 535-
550. "
786,1," In their memorandum of law in opposition to the instant motion, the defendants argue that the plaintiffs fail to adequately 
identify the relevant market, with respect to both product interchangeability and geographic boundaries. Although further 
evidence must be submitted on these issues before the court is prepared to make a final determination of the relevant market, it 
is satisfied at this stage of the proceedings by the plaintiffs' representations that the market for Korean-manufactured cosmetic 
products among the large population of Koreans and Korean-Americans located in the several neighborhoods of Queens in 
which the plaintiffs and Retail Defendants compete constitutes a discrete relevant market. "
787,2," Specifically, the plaintiffs' complaint alleges causes of action against the Amore Defendants for three independent violations of 
section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C § 1 (unlawful contracts, combinations and conspiracy in restraint of interstate trade and 
commerce, refusal to deal with plaintiffs, and participating in a group boycott of the plaintiffs); two violations of section 2 of the 
Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2 (monopolization and attempted monopolization of the Korean cosmetic market in New York City), 
one violation of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 14 (illegal tying); two violations of New York's Donnelly Act, N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law §§ 
340 et seq. (price fixing and refusal to do business in restraint of trade); violation of N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law § 349 (deceptive trade 
practices); promissory estoppel; tortious interference with business relations; and breach of the implied covenant of good faith 
and fair dealing."
787,3," Plaintiffs allege all of the claims in the complaint against the Retail defendants except breach of N.Y. Bus. Law § 349, 
promissory estoppel, and breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing."
787,4," The parties' submissions are not entirely clear as to how long the business relationships between the plaintiffs and the Amore 
Defendants lasted prior to their termination by the Amore Defendants in March 2006. The complaint refers to an August 2004 
meeting in which the Amore Defendants first announced their intention to move to an exclusive distribution system, see Compl. 
P 50, and the memorandum of law in support of plaintiffs' motion for temporary and preliminary injunctive relief refers to the 
distribution relationship as ""years-long."" Memorandum in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Temporary and Preliminary Injunctive 
Relief (""Pl. Br."") at 8. The court thereby infers that the plaintiffs maintained amicable business relations with the Amore 
Defendants for at least approximately one and one half, and possibly several, years. "
788,5," A disputed issue of fact exists between the plaintiffs and defendants as to when the plaintiffs were first made aware of the 
Amore Defendants' intention to supply Amorepacific products solely to exclusive distributors. Throughout their memorandum of 
law in opposition to the plaintiffs' motion, the defendants argue that the plaintiffs were made aware of this intention at the August 
2004 meeting. The plaintiffs, however, contend that they were given no notice of the Amore Defendants' intention to terminate 
their supply of Amorepacific products until March 2006. The plaintiffs' protests notwithstanding, a letter dated January 19, 2006, from the Amore Defendants to the plaintiffs, submitted to 
the court by the plaintiffs in support of the instant motion, unambiguously states that ""Amore is cleaning the existing stores and 
at the end, the supply of Amore products will be limited to 'Amore exclusive store.'"" Affidavit of Naomi Kwon, Ex. A. (""Kwon Aff."") 
(emphasis added). The court therefore concludes that the plaintiffs were made aware, at the latest, in January 2006 of the 
Amore Defendants' intention to terminate the supply of Amorepacific products to all retailers who did not accept their offer to 
enter into an exclusive dealing relationship."
788,6," See supra notes 2 and 3. The plaintiffs do not rely on their claims for deceptive trade practices in violation of N.Y. Bus. Law § 
349 or tortious interference with business relations as bases for the instant motion. "
790,7," As discussed above, see supra note 5, the defendants argue that the plaintiffs were aware since August 2004 of the Amore 
Defendants' intentions to convert their business to an exclusive distributorship model. Although the defendants' contention on 
this issue might be substantiated by the submission of further evidence, for purposes of this motion the court will grant the 
plaintiffs the benefit of the most favorable reading of their complaint, which alleges their discovery of the defendants' plan in 
January 2006. See Compl. P 52 (""As of January 2006… the Amore Defendants informed Plaintiffs that the Amore Defendants 
would discontinue all sales incentives for Plaintiffs' stores and boutiques and that in the future they would sell Amore products 
only to retailers who agreed to operate their establishments solely as 'Amore Exclusive Shops.'""); see also Kwon Aff. Ex. A."

806,*," The Honorable Richard Cudahy, United States Circuit Judge for the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation. "
808,1," The substance of the issue was litigated below and on appeal and thus is fairly before us. In any event, HN6[
] even though mergers and asset acquisitions are normally challenged under Section 7 of the Clayton Act, courts have permitted them also to 
be challenged under Sherman § 2 if they will create or maintain a monopoly. See, e.g., Fraser v. Major League Soccer, L.L.C., 
284 F.3d 47, 61 (1st Cir. 2002) (stating that a""merger to monopoly"" can be challenged under Sherman § 2); see also, Golden 
Grain Macaroni Co. v. F.T.C., 472 F.2d 882, 886-87 (9th Cir. 1972)."
808,2," The statute reads in relevant part: HN7[
] no person subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission shall acquire the whole or any part of the 
assets of another person engaged also in commerce or in any activity affecting commerce, where in any line of commerce 
or in any activity affecting commerce in any section of the country, the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to 
lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly."
808,15," U.S.C. § 18. HN8[
] The statute defines ""person"" to include ""corporation."" 15 U.S.C. § 7. See also, U.S. v. Von's Grocery Co., 384 U.S. 270, 275, 86 S. Ct. 1478, 1481, 16 L. Ed. 2d 555 (1966) (noting that the Clayton Act was amended to cover asset 
acquisitions because ""corporations [would] merge simply by purchasing their rivals' assets"" in order to escape Section 7 of the 
Clayton Act); Dr. Pepper/Seven-Up Companies, Inc. v. F.T.C., 301 U.S. App. D.C. 150, 991 F.2d 859, 864-66 (D.C. Cir. 1993) 
(discussing the failing company defense in the context of a soda company's purchase of a bottler's assets in a bankruptcy 
auction). "
809,3," Thus, a holding for the Group in this case would not involve a rule of law that a potential antitrust violation exists whenever a 
dominant firm purchases an isolated piece of commonly available equipment necessary for its ongoing operations that a non-
dominant competitor or new entrant had also wanted. See 4 Areeda P356 (stating that a non-dominant competitor usually 
cannot challenge a dominant rival's asset acquisition (even if illegal) on the grounds that it would have acquired the asset but for 
the dominant rival's purchase because "". . . the plaintiff's loss of an opportunity to acquire an asset is not a reason for finding 
[that acquisition] unlawful."") Such a rule might have anti-competitive effects in the relevant market by inhibiting a dominant firm's 
access to the inputs markets for equipment necessary to maintain its productive capacity. HN9[
] The antitrust laws allow legal 
monopolies to compete vigorously on the merits in the relevant market, even if such competition drives out competitors. See 
United States v. Grinnell, 384 U.S. 563, 570-71, 86 S.Ct. 1698, 1704, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778 (1966) (stating that Sherman Act liability 
does not extend to firms that become monopolies by virtue of ""superior product, business acumen, or historic accident.""); 
Olympia Equipment Leasing Co. v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 797 F.2d 370, 375 (7th Cir. 1986) (stating that courts 
recognize that ""the lawful monopolist should be free to compete like everyone else; otherwise the antitrust laws would be holding 
an umbrella over inefficient competitors.""); see also, Verizon Communications, Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, L.L.P., 540 
U.S. 398, 415-16, 124 S.Ct. 872, 883, 157 L. Ed. 2d 823 (2004) (""The Sherman Act . . . does not give judges carte blanche to 
insist that a monopolist alter its way of doing business whenever some other approach might yield greater competition."") 
Because a firm's access to inputs is essential to its ability to compete in the relevant market, this means that they must be 
allowed to compete in the inputs markets associated with the relevant market."
809,4," We decline to address the merits because the district court has not addressed this issue as it is properly framed, and because 
resolution of the issue will require further development of the record and further fact-finding with respect to whether the 
challenged acquisition had the effect of substantially lessening competition in the relevant market. Thus, we vacate the district 
court's holding on the merits."
809,5," Unlike the non-dominant competitor who lost the opportunity to purchase an isolated asset and whose injury-in-fact is not an 
antitrust injury because that injury-in-fact is not the reason for finding the dominant firm's acquisition illegal -- as discussed in 
note 3 supra and in 4 Areeda P356 -- the exclusion of the Group from the market is the reason that Appellees' acquisition may 
be found to be illegal. "
810,6," We believe that Midwest Communications, Inc. v. Minnesota Twins, Inc., 779 F.2d 444 (8th Cir. 1985), is distinguishable. That 
case is similar to the instant case in that both involve antitrust suits by a plaintiff whose bid to purchase assets (TV rights in that 
case) lost out. The Eighth Circuit indicated that the plaintiff there failed to show either proximate cause or antitrust injury. With 
respect to proximate cause, the Eighth Circuit held that the causal connection between the alleged illegal tying arrangement and 
plaintiff's injury was tenuous at best. Id. at 451. Apparently, that was because the winning bid was more advantageous to the 
defendant seller than the losing bid. See id. at 448-49. In any event, the jury had made a specific finding that the plaintiff had not 
suffered any injury. Id. at 449. By contrast, in this case, we have held that the Group has shown proximate cause. With respect 
to antitrust injury, the Eighth Circuit held that the plaintiff was neither an actual or potential competitor who was foreclosed from 
the market, nor a consumer of the TV service who was hurt by the tying arrangement. See id. at 451. Unlike Midwest, we have 
held that the Group has shown that Nucor's participation in the auction was causally related to its exclusion from the market, and 
that this exclusion of a potential competitor from the market was the type of injury which the antitrust laws were intended to 
prevent."
810,7," Our intention is to express no opinion at all with respect to the merits -- i.e., whether the actions of appellees substantially 
lessened competition in the relevant market and violated the antitrust laws. See note 4, supra. Thus, we express no opinion with 
respect to the remarks in Judge Cudahy's separate opinion, except to say that we agree with Judge Cudahy that if the Group 
proves on remand that ""Nucor substantially lessened competition in the relevant market"" for hot rolled coil, the Group will have 
proved a violation of the antitrust laws. However, we express no opinion on that issue; we prefer for the district court to conduct 
the appropriate analysis in the first instance and on a more fully developed record. Nor do we intend to express an opinion on or 
preempt the district court's discretion with respect to the nature of the appropriate course of action on remand, e.g., immediate 
trial or further summary judgment proceedings. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(d). "

that, at least potentially, a spill of large dimensions that poses no immediate threat may not receive as much attention as a 
smaller spill that creates a greater risk. "
821,3," The court notes that the plaintiffs, in their brief in opposition to the defendants' motion for summary judgment as to this claim, 
allege that ""there were three basic and overlapping agreements among the defendants."" Corrected and substituted plaintiffs' 
consolidated response in opposition to defendants' motions for summary judgment/summary adjudication (Doc. no. 692)

plaintiffs argument identifies 'phases' of the conspiracy. Id. at 29-30 (discussing ""a second phase of the conspiracy"" and ""the 
third and last stage of the conspiracy""). The court's understanding of the claims is culled from the plaintiffs' briefs and from the 
oral argument before the court on the instant motion. In so doing, the court has given the plaintiffs all reasonable benefit of the

] The elements of civil conspiracy in Alabama and Massachusetts are as follows: Under Alabama law, (1) concerted 
action by two or more persons to (2) achieve an unlawful or lawful purpose by unlawful means, (3) with actual knowledge and 
intent to bring about the purpose. Singleton v. Protective Life Ins. Co., 857 So.2d 803 (Ala. 2003); Luck v. Primus Automotive 
Financial Servs., Inc., 763 So.2d 243, 247 (Ala. 2000). Under Massachusetts law, there are two kinds of civil conspiracies, 
coercive conspiracies and 'means-ends' conspiracies that correspond to Alabama's cause of action. Coercive conspiracies are 
shown by (1) defendants acting in unison to (2) have a peculiar power of coercion over a plaintiff that they (3) individually would 
not have had. Aetna Casualty Sur. Co. v. P & B Auto Body, 43 F.3d 1546, 1563 (1st Cir 1994). 'Means-ends' conspiracies are 
shown by (1) common design or agreement (2) to do a wrongful act, and (3) proof of some tortious act in furtherance of the 
conspiracy. Id. at 1564."
822,10," The court notes that at oral argument the plaintiffs stated that they were exclusively relying on an antitrust paradigm, or 
framework, to prove their alleged conspiracy. Transcript of oral argument, at 11-12."
822,11, Plaintiffs' consolidated response at 33.
822,12," At least one other state, Illinois, has used this approach. McClure, 720 N.E.2d at 258-68. "
823,13," Although generally courts have held that parallel conduct is insufficient to prove an agreement in the context of prices in 
oligopolistic markets, this is equally applicable here. Each of the defendants is a sophisticated corporate entity operating in a 
complex regulatory and market environment. The requirement that more than mere parallel conduct be shown as evidence of an 
antitrust conspiracy recognizes the reality that there will often be pressures in such an environment toward similar solutions on 
the part of interdependent but independent entities."
823,14," As the court understands this, cathodic protection uses a weak electrical charge to protect steel pipelines and tanks from 
corrosion."
823,15, Transcript of oral argument at 17. 
824,16," The court gives the following by way of illustration. Hypothetically, the defendants at a particular industry meeting may all have 
agreed to pool losses and profits from UST leaks among themselves so as to minimize their collective tax liability in violation of 
the Internal Revenue Code. Evidence of such an agreement, however, would not tend to show that the defendants conspired 
with regard to the different UST issues that form the basis of the plaintiffs' contentions in this suit."
824,17," The court notes that the plaintiffs have nowhere clearly set out an exhaustive list of plus factors in their filings on summary 
judgment, nor did they do so at oral argument, despite their statement that the antitrust paradigm was the one on which they 
were relying. However, after close consideration of the briefs, argument, and evidence, the court concludes that these are the 
plus factors that have been presented. The court has compiled this list, giving the plaintiffs all benefit of the doubt as to whether 
a particular factor has been raised and argued."
824,18," Indeed, the principal difficulty this court has had in resolving the pending summary-judgment motions is that the evidentiary 
record submitted by the plaintiffs is organized more to rebut the arguments made in support of the defendants' motions for 
summary judgment than to demonstrate the existence of disputed material facts regarding those issues on which the plaintiffs 
bear the burden of proof at trial. See Fitzpatrick, 2 F.3d at 1115-16 (""For issues … on which the non-movant would bear the 
burden of proof at trial, … the moving party [for summary judgment] simply may show[]--that is, point[] out to the district court--
that there is an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party's case."") (citations and quotation marks omitted). Such 
organization has made the court's task of determining whether there is evidence in support of the plaintiffs' alleged conspiracy 
unnecessarily onerous. Nevertheless, the court's conclusions regarding the adequacy or inadequacy of the evidentiary record for 
the purposes of summary judgment are based on review of all the evidence presented. "

826,26," The fact that the plaintiffs have not established this plus factor is of great concern. As the court stated at oral argument: ""I guess what I'm trying to separate out in looking at this parallel conduct is, you know, let's say the president of AMOCO 
and the president of EXXON met in this room and said we've got tanks out there that are leaking. I'm getting rid of mine. 
You know, I don't want those things. They're going to be an environmental nightmare. And the president of the other 
company says the same thing and they walk out of the room and both of them get rid of them. I don't necessarily think that's 
an agreement. That's just where they're just saying -- they're just acting in their interests, just happening to say what they're 
going to do, versus where the two companies actually have an agreement to do something. In fact, they don't even need an 
agreement to do this. They don't need an agreement to say we're going to get rid of these tanks. Which actually maybe 
raises another question. Why would they even need an agreement to do what you're claiming they have done? What's the 
purpose of having an agreement? I can see trying to get around an agreement to raise prices, but where is there even a 
need to do an agreement here if they just want to get rid of tanks? It may be that it's bad, it may that they don't want to have 
these things on hand any more, but what's the purpose of the agreement other than maybe they're just exchanging 
information?"" Transcript of oral argument, at 160-61. Thus, the failure to present evidence to establish this plus factor is, in large measure, a 
failure to explain the underlying need for agreement to achieve what the plaintiffs allege has injured them."
826,27," With regard to this plus factor, the plaintiffs have not explained why meetings among employees and executives can fairly be 
considered a plus factor. Of course, at summary judgment the question is not whether the non-moving party has presented a 
theory to explain why its evidence is sufficient to survive summary judgment, but whether the evidence itself is sufficient. "
827,28," For instance, there is no indication that UST issues played a greater role in these meetings than one might otherwise expect 
or that the treatment of UST issues in the meetings for which the plaintiffs have provided evidence was different from the usual 
practice of the API. Indeed, there is nothing to indicate that there was anything unusual about the meetings in question or that 
they formed the basis for any agreements that might explain the allegedly parallel conduct of the defendants."

840,1, The Court will address many of Plaintiff's state common law claims in a later memorandum.
840,2," Solinger is Villafane's immediate supervisor, and Elbl and Rees are also Villafane's superiors. "
841,3, Complaint fails to define CVS. 
842,4," The various statutes of limitations are not at issue here because in 2002Villafane executed agreements with Kosair, NNA, PCA, 
the Research Foundation, and the Research Fund to toll those limitations on their respective claims."
842,5," Some courts consider §§ 3730(e)(4)(A) & (B) to be matters of substantive law rather than a ""jurisdictional bar"". See United 
States ex rel. Yannacopolous v. General Dynamics, 315 F.Supp.2d 939, 946-947 (N.D. Ill. 2004). As such, dismissal of a claim 
due to the public disclosure bar would be considered under Rule 12(b)(6) rather than Rule 12(b)(1). See id. The difference is 
significant because under a Rule 12(b)(6) analysis, the Court construes the complaint ""in the light most favorable to the plaintiff."" 
Grindstaff, 133 F.3d at 421. Under a Rule 12(b)(1) analysis, however, plaintiff bears the burden of proving jurisdiction. Jones, 
160 F.3d at 329. The Sixth Circuit analyzes the public disclosure bar using a Rule 12(b)(1) analysis. See id. "
843,6," Although no court has considered the issue, the Court believes that Kentucky ORA requests are analogous to FOIA requests 
and should be treated the same for purposes of the public disclosure bar. "
844,7," The fact that Defendant obtained information via a Kentucky ORA request rather than a FOIA request may be significant in that 
some courts have interpreted the word ""administrative"" in § 3730(e)(4)(A) to refer only to reports produced by federal sources. 
See Burns, 186 F.3d at 725 (citing Dunleavy, 123 F.3d at 745). The Eleventh Circuit has gone even further, holding that the 
report must be issued by an administrative agency, not merely by an employee of the agency. See United States ex rel. Williams 
v. NEC Corp., 931 F.2d 1493. Taken together, this would mean reports and investigations performed under the Kentucky ORA 
would not trigger the public disclosure bar unless the underlying information included reports or investigations performed by 
federal administrative agencies."
844,8," The Board's Agreed Order of Indefinite Restriction and its Agreed Order, both of which contain the potentially publicly disclosed 
statements, were signed December 18, 2003, and November 30th, 2004, respectively, after this suit had been filed. Thus, the 
orders cannot serve as public disclosures upon which the suit is based. However, the statements themselves were made prior to 
the filing of this suit and could potentially be considered public disclosures. "
845,9," If the court were to decide that the statement to the Kentucky Medical Board about ""funding improprieties"" constitutes a public 
disclosure, Villafane would fail the original source test. An original source is ""an individual who has direct and independent 
knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the information to the Government 
before filing an action under this section which is based on the information."" § 31 U.S.C. 3730(e)(4)(B). Additionally, ""the 
individual must have provided the government with the information prior to any public disclosure."" Walburn, 431 F.3d at 974 
(emphasis in the original). Thus, if the statements about ""funding improprieties"" were deemed a public disclosure, Villafane 
would not have provided the information to the government until after the public disclosure, since he contacted an Assistant U.S. 
Attorney two weeks after the statements were received by the Kentucky Medical Board."
845,10," Villafane does not allege any fraud with regard to the services provided by either Kosair or any physician on Medicaid or 
Medicare reimbursements. "
847,11," Because whether Defendants' financial relationship qualifies for the AMC exception is so pivotal, the following issues will be 
considered only after a determination of whether the AMC exception applies: Defendant Kosair argues that the Stark law does not apply to the type of ""indirect"" relationship that exists between the Hospital 
and defendant faculty physicians.HN19[
]  Under the Stark statute, prohibited financial relationships include indirect 
compensation arrangements when the referring physician receives aggregate compensation ""that varies with, or otherwise 
reflects, the volume or value of referrals or other business generated by the referring physician for the entity furnishing 
designated health services…"" 42 C.F.R. § 411.354(c)(2) (2006). Although it has not been shown that the payments vary with 
referral value or volume, Villafane alleges that the amount paid by Kosair to the referring physicians is well above the fair market 
value of any teaching services provided, and this difference may ""otherwise reflect"" the volume or value of referrals. Further 
discovery could illuminate the nature of this difference."
847,12," Had the statute itself been changed, the Court would determine whether it applies retroactively using a two-step test. The 
Court would first determine ""whether Congress has expressly prescribed the statute's proper reach."" Landgraf v. USI Film 
Products, 511 U.S. 244, 280, 114 S. Ct. 1483, 128 L. Ed. 2d 229 (1994). If no such express command by Congress exists 
concerning the AMC exception, the court must then ""determine whether the new statute would have retroactive effect, i.e., 
whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new 
duties with respect to transactions already completed,"" in which case the court will apply the traditional presumption against "
848,," retroactive legislation. Id. In this case, applying the AMC exception retroactively does not impair Defendants' rights or increase 
their liability or duties. Rather, if found to apply to Defendants, it would shield them from liability that Congress never intended to 
create. Thus, the AMC exception should apply retroactively to financial relationships in existence prior to the effective date of the 
regulation."
848,13," Parties should use a reasonable and consistent method for calculating a physician's academic services and clinical teaching 
services. A physician will be deemed to meet this requirement if he or she spends at least 20 percent of his or her professional 
time or 8 hours per week providing academic services or clinical teaching services, though physicians who spend less than this 
amount are not necessarily disqualified. "
850,14," Interestingly, Plaintiff has equated the university's refusal to hire employees of Villafane with price fixing, which typically occurs 
when two or more competitors selling the same product agree to sell at some price that will guarantee profit windfalls. "
853,1," In their papers, Plaintiffs had appeared to argue that the contacts of Richemont North America could be ascribed to Cartier 
International for the purpose of establishing general jurisdiction over Cartier International. The Ninth Circuit recognizes two 
exceptions to the presumption of corporate separateness for the purpose of establishing jurisdiction: alter ego and general agent 
relationships. See Harris Rutsky & Co. v. Bell & Clements Limited, 328 F.3d 1122, 1134-35 (9th Cir. 2003). The test for an alter 
ego relationship requires: ""(1) that there is such unity of interest and ownership that the separate personalities of the corporation 
and the individuals no longer exist and (2) that failure to disregard the corporation would result in fraud or injustice."" Flynt 
Distributing Co., Inc. v. Harvey, 734 F.2d 1389 (9th Cir. 1984). The test for a general agency relationship requires the agent 
perform services ""sufficiently important to the foreign corporation that if it did not have a representative to perform them, the 
corporation's own officials would undertake to perform substantially similar services."" Wells Fargo & Co. v. Wells Fargo Exp. Co. 
556 F.2d 406, 423 (9th Cir. 1977). Plaintiffs did not present facts to support either exception to the presumption of corporate 
separateness. "
862,1," Section 65-25-203 states: HN1[

Furthermore, ""'the Administrative Procedure Act, . . . embodies the basic presumption of judicial review to one ""suffering legal

864,8," The Supreme Court analyzed § 701(a)(1) and (a)(2) in Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 830, 105 S. Ct. 1649, 84 L. Ed. 2d 
714 (1985), explaining that: The former applies when Congress has expressed an intent to preclude judicial review. The latter applies in different 
circumstances; even where Congress has not affirmatively precluded review, review is not to be had if the statute is drawn 
so that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency's exercise of discretion. In such a 
case, the statute (""law"") can be taken to have ""committed"" the decisionmaking to the agency's judgment absolutely."
864,9," We note that the Supreme Court has recently ""instruct[ed] [the] courts of appeals to properly distinguish between subject-

'committed to agency discretion by law.'"" Madison-Hughes, 80 F.3d at 1127 (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2)). It is not at all clear 
today that this is actually a matter of subject-matter jurisdiction in light of Arbaugh, Eberhart, and Kontrick; however, because we 
decline to review any claims based on the TVA's rate-making decisions, we do not need to make that determination at this time. "
865,10," As noted above, the Cooperatives are organized on a nonprofit basis pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated § 65-25-203. 
The district court correctly considered the plaintiffs to be shareholders of the Cooperatives. See Davis v. Appalachian Electric 
Co-op., Inc., 213 Tenn. 215, 373 S.W.2d 450, 452 (Tenn. 1963) (discussing members of an electric cooperative as the 
equivalent of shareholders of a corporation); accord Alston v. Black River Elec. Coop., 345 S.C. 323, 548 S.E.2d 858, 860 & 861 
n.3 (S.C. 2001) (stating that electric cooperative members are similar to shareholders and listing other state-court decisions that 
concluded similarly)."
865,11," HN11[
] Several Tennessee Court of Appeals cases have ""recognized the right of members of a nonprofit corporation to 
bring the equivalent of a shareholder derivative action against the directors and officers for wasting corporate assets and using 
corporate assets for personal gain."" Summers v. Cherokee Children & Family Servs., Inc., 112 S.W.3d 486, 506 (Tenn. Ct. App. 
2002); see also Hannewald v. Fairfield Cmtys., Inc., 651 S.W.2d 222, 225-26 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1983); Bourne v. Williams, 633 
S.W.2d 469, 471-73 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1981)."
865,12," The district court properly applied Tennessee law. See also Hicks ex rel. Union Pac. Corp. v. Lewis, 148 S.W.3d 80, 84 (Tenn. 
Ct. App. 2003) (HN12[
] ""Tennessee has long adhered to the internal affairs doctrine, under which matters involving the 
internal affairs of a foreign corporation are deemed substantive in nature and should be resolved in accordance with the law of 
the state of incorporation."") (internal quotation marks omitted). "
866,13," In its brief, the TVA addressed the question of whether the ""district court improperly dismissed [the plaintiffs'] claims because 
no motion to dismiss the constitutional claims had been filed."" TVA Br. at 20. However, the plaintiffs noted this fact in their 
recitation of the procedural history but did not actually raise it as an issue for our review."
866,14," The plaintiffs also contend that Davis ""does not represent the current state of the law,"" because it ""was issued at a time before 
Tennessee courts had even recognized direct actions, much less the distinction between direct and derivative actions."" 
Appellants Br. at 22. It is true that the holding in Davis is phrased in terms of exhausting corporate remedies as opposed to 
making a distinction between direct and derivative suits. Davis, 373 S.W.2d at 452; see also Daugherty v. Tri-County Elec. 
Mbrshp. Corp., 1997 Tenn. App. LEXIS 29, No. 01A01-9607-CV-00334, 1997 WL 13757, at *3 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 16, 1997) 
(unpublished opinion) ("" Davis held that before seeking judicial relief, the plaintiffs must have first exhausted their remedies 
within the corporation.""). However, Davis supports the defendants' position to the extent that both the requirement of exhaustion 
of the corporate remedies and the demand requirement are structured to encourage internal resolution of corporate disputes. 
See Davis, 373 S.W.2d at 454 (discussing the policy rationale for the exhaustion rule); Lewis, 838 S.W.2d at 221 (discussing 
the policies for the demand requirement). "
867,15," The plaintiffs also assert that their claims cannot be classified as derivative because their ""definition of the class includes 
individuals who are former members of the Cooperatives"" who would not have any remedy as a result of a derivative action. 
Appellants Br. at 21. However, this will have no effect on the case because the plaintiffs have explained that they primarily are 
seeking an accounting by the Cooperatives. They have characterized their claim in this manner because the Cooperatives do 
not necessarily need to provide patronage refunds and can instead use excess funds (if any) to reduce rates or to pay off debt. 
TENN. CODE ANN. § 65-25-212. The result of the derivative suit would thus provide the desired remedy for all of the individuals 
in question. "
868,16," This assertion is based upon an article entitled ""Co-ops: Members rarely involved; co-ops don't tell them exactly how much 
they own""; the article was published in The Tennessean on April 11, 2004. J.A. at 344. The article explains that many electric 
cooperatives in Tennessee do not maintain records of their owners' interests. For example, the Middle Tennessee Electric 
Membership Corporation is asserted to have stated that it has no records prior to the 1980s for its members."
868,17," Section 1983 states: HN16[
] Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State . . . subjects, 
or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation 
of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action 
at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress . . . ."
868,18," We need only analyze this issue with regard to the Cooperatives, becauseHN17[
]  there is no question that ""TVA is an 
agency and instrumentality of the United States."" TVA Br. at 36 n.16. In its brief, the TVA explains that it is not subject to suit 
pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment or to § 1983: ""[t]his is because of the basic precept that '[t]he Fourteenth Amendment's 
Due Process Clause restricts the activities of the states and their instrumentalities; whereas the Fifth Amendment's Due Process 
Clause circumscribes only the actions of the federal government.'"" TVA Br. at 36 n.16 (second alteration in original) (quoting 
Scott v. Clay County, 205 F.3d 867, 873 n.8 (6th Cir. 2000)). The TVA concedes, however, that HN18[
] it is ""subject to the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution."" TVA Br. at 36 n.16. Thus, we still must address the merits of the plaintiffs' constitutional 
claims. See infra Section II.D.2. "
869,19," The Brentwood Academy Court found that there was sufficient entwinement based on the fact that the association was 
comprised primarily of public-school representatives and that members of the association were a part of the state retirement 
system. Brentwood Academy, 531 U.S. at 298-302."
869,20," The plaintiffs' state-law antitrust claims filed pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated § 47-25-106 fail in light of § 47-18-
111(a)(1), which provides thatHN23[
]  ""[t]he provisions of this part shall not apply to . . . [a]cts or transactions required or 
specifically authorized under the laws administered by . . . officers acting under the authority of this state or of the United States."" 
The TVA clearly was acting within its authority pursuant to the TVA Act when it entered into the contracts with the Cooperatives. 
See 16 U.S.C. § 831i."
869,21," As discussed above, we may not review the terms of the contract between the TVA and the Cooperatives because such terms 
are wholly within the TVA's discretion to set rates. However, the plaintiffs' complaint alleges that the Cooperatives and the TVA 
engaged in a conspiracy to withhold the refunds as well as to fail to reduce rates. In their brief, the plaintiffs also discuss the 
effect of patronage capital rates. We do not believe that the plaintiffs' antitrust allegations are limited to the terms of the contract 
(and thus to rate-setting by the TVA), and we accordingly review the plaintiffs' antitrust arguments. "
870,22," The district court also cited Kreager v. General Electric Co., 497 F.2d 468, 472 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 861, 95 S. Ct. 
111, 42 L. Ed. 2d 95 (1974), for the proposition that ""generally members of a business unit cannot sue the entity for a federal 
antitrust violation."" J.A. at 425 (Dist. Ct. Mem. at 15). The Second Circuit stated, ""Kreager lacked standing to bring a private anti-
trust action to recover damages for injuries allegedly sustained by his corporation."" Kreager, 497 F.2d at 472. However, the 
plaintiffs in this case allege that the Cooperatives themselves violated antitrust law, not that the Cooperatives were injured by 
the actions of other corporations. See id. at 470 (explaining that Kreager's company was purportedly injured by a conspiracy 
between the defendant companies)."
870,23," See Loudon v. Tennessee Valley Authority, 585 F. Supp. 83, 87 (E.D. Tenn.) (""In enforcing . . . its contract with Loudon, TVA 
was engaged in valid governmental action and exempt from the antitrust laws of the United States.""), aff'd, 754 F.2d 372 (6th 
Cir. 1984); Webster County Coal Corp. v. TVA, 476 F. Supp. 529, 532 (W.D. Ky. 1979) (holding that the TVA is ""exempt from 
liability under the antitrust laws""); see also Sea-Land Serv., Inc. v. Alaska R.R., 212 U.S. App. D.C. 197, 659 F.2d 243, 246 n.5 
(D.C. Cir. 1981) (citing Webster County ), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 919, 102 S. Ct. 1274, 71 L. Ed. 2d 459 (1982)."
870,24," For instance, the TVA has the power of eminent domain. 16 U.S.C. § 831c(h). See Flamingo, 540 U.S. at 747 (""Finally, the 
Postal Service has many powers more characteristic of Government than of private enterprise, including its state-conferred 
monopoly on mail delivery, the power of eminent domain, and the power to conclude international postal agreements.""). "
871,25," In addition, the Cooperatives are empowered to enter into contracts with the TVA pursuant to Tennessee's Rural Electric and 
Community Services Cooperative Act. TENN. CODE ANN. § 65-25-205. The Supreme Court has recognized a state-action 
exemption from antitrust immunity, reasoning that ""when a 'state in adopting and enforcing [a regulatory] program . . ., as 
sovereign, imposed the restraint as an act of government,' the program could not violate the Sherman Act because the Act was 
directed against 'individual and not state action.'"" Brentwood Academy v. Tenn. Secondary Sch. Athletic Ass'n, 442 F.3d 410, 
440 (6th Cir. 2006) (alteration in original) (quoting Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 352, 63 S. Ct. 307, 87 L. Ed. 315 (1943)). 
Because the Cooperatives conduct their activity ""pursuant to state authorization,"" the following test applies: ""First, the challenged 
restraint must be one clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy; second, the policy must be actively 
supervised by the State itself."" Id. at 441 (quoting Cal. Retail Liquor Dealers Ass'n v. Midcal Aluminum, 445 U.S. 97, 105, 100 S. 
Ct. 937, 63 L. Ed. 2d 233 (1980)). With regard to the first prong of the Midcal test, we do not require ""explicit authorization,"" Mich. Paytel Joint Venture v. City of 
Detroit, 287 F.3d 527, 535 (6th Cir. 2002) (quoting Town of Hallie v. City of Eau Claire, 471 U.S. 34, 42-44, 105 S. Ct. 1713, 85 
L. Ed. 2d 24 (1985)); rather, ""[t]he Parker exemption applies as long as the suppression of competition is the foreseeable or 
logical result of what the state authorizes,"" id. Tennessee clearly authorizes the Cooperatives to enter into contracts with the 
TVA. TENN. CODE ANN. § 65-25-205. In fact, ""the general assembly . . . express[ed] its intent that public electric systems 
replace competition with the monopoly public service."" TENN. CODE ANN. § 65-34-108. Tennessee clearly intended to favor 
cooperatives, and ""anticompetitive effects are the logical and foreseeable result"" of the statutory scheme. Mich. Paytel, 287 F.3d 
at 536. There is no indication, though, that Tennessee supervises the electric cooperatives' actions in entering into contracts with the 
TVA. However, ""the active state supervision requirement is not applicable in cases where the actor is a municipality,"" and there 
is some argument that ""the same should go for cases in which the actor is a 'state agency.'"" Brentwood, 442 F.3d at 443 n.25; 
see also Town of Hallie, 471 U.S. at 46 n.10 (""In cases in which the actor is a state agency, it is likely that active state 
supervision would also not be required, although we do not here decide that issue.""). Brentwood rejected this argument, stating, 
""circuit precedent suggests that it is only municipalities that are exempt from the second prong of the test."" Brentwood, 442 F.3d 
at 443 n.25. However, the ""circuit precedent"" to which Brentwood refers is Michigan Paytel, which merely held that private 
parties are required to satisfy both prongs of the Midcal test. Mich. Paytel, 287 F.3d at 536. The Seventh Circuit held that electric cooperatives should be exempt from antitrust liability due to their semi-public status and 
the fact that their ""only purpose is to provide power to [their] members as cheaply as possible."" Fuchs v. Rural Elec. 
Convenience Coop., Inc., 858 F.2d 1210, 1217-18 (7th Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1020, 109 S. Ct. 1744, 104 L. Ed. 2d 
181 (1989). Fuchs held ""that when an entity charged with an antitrust violation is neither a municipality nor a state agency but 
does not have the attributes of a purely private actor, it may be held immune as a state actor without the active scrutiny of 
market conditions which is a necessary prerequisite for holding a private entity immune."" Id. We agree with the Seventh Circuit 
that the Cooperatives are neither state agencies nor purely private parties, which may require a grant of antitrust immunity in 
spite of a lack of supervision. However, we do not need to decide today whether the Cooperatives are entitled to immunity 
without any demonstration of state supervision, because of our conclusion that the TVA is entitled to antitrust immunity. "

justice and for the convenience of the parties a claim or action to which this section applies [that is, for wrongful death, survival, 
or personal injuries] would be more properly heard in a forum outside this state, the court shall decline to exercise jurisdiction 
under the doctrine of forum non conveniens and shall stay or dismiss the claim or action. In determining whether to grant a 
motion to stay or dismiss an action under the doctrine of forum non conveniens, the court shall consider whether: (1) an 
alternate forum exists in which the claim or action may be tried; (2) the alternate forum provides an adequate remedy; (3) 
maintenance of the claim or action in the courts of this state would work a substantial injustice to the moving party; (4) the 
alternate forum, as a result of the submission of the parties or otherwise, can exercise jurisdiction over all the defendants 
properly joined to the plaintiff's claim; (5) the balance of the private interests of the parties and the public interest of the state 
predominate in favor of the claim or action being brought in an alternate forum, which shall include consideration of the extent to 
which an injury or death resulted from acts or omissions that occurred in this state; and (6) the stay or dismissal would not result 
in unreasonable duplication or proliferation of litigation."")."
893,54," ""Wisely, it has not been attempted to catalogue the circumstances which will justify or require either grant or denial of 
[dismissal based on forum non conveniens]. The doctrine leaves much to the discretion of the court to which plaintiff resorts, and 
experience has not shown a judicial tendency to renounce one's own jurisdiction so strong as to result in many abuses. ""If the combination and weight of factors requisite to given results are difficult to forecast or state, those to be considered are not 
difficult to name. An interest to be considered, and the one likely to be most pressed, is the private interest of the litigant. 
Important considerations are the relative ease of access to sources of proof; availability of compulsory process for attendance of 
unwilling, and the cost of obtaining attendance of willing, witnesses; possibility of view of premises, if view would be appropriate 
to the action; and all other practical problems that make trial of a case easy, expeditious and inexpensive. There may also be 
questions as to the enforcibility of a judgment if one is obtained. The court will weigh relative advantages and obstacles to fair 
trial. It is often said that the plaintiff may not, by choice of an inconvenient forum, 'vex,' 'harass,' or 'oppress' the defendant by 
inflicting upon him expense or trouble not necessary to his own right to pursue his remedy. But unless the balance is strongly in 
favor of the defendant, the plaintiff's choice of forum should rarely be disturbed. ""Factors of public interest also have place in applying the doctrine. Administrative difficulties follow for courts when litigation is 
piled up in congested centers instead of being handled at its origin. Jury duty is a burden that ought not to be imposed upon the 
people of a community which has no relation to the litigation. In cases which touch the affairs of many persons, there is reason 
for holding the trial in their view and reach rather than in remote parts of the country where they can learn of it by report only. 
There is a local interest in having localized controversies decided at home. There is an appropriateness, too, in having the trial of 
a diversity case in a forum that is at home with the state law that must govern the case, rather than having a court in some other 
forum untangle problems in conflict of laws, and in law foreign to itself."" Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert Storage and Transfer Co., 330 U.S. 501, 508-509, 67 S. Ct. 839, 91 L. Ed. 1055 (1947) (footnotes

914,1," The court further notes that while each claim in Plaintiff's Complaint has its own specific elements, which Plaintiff has the 
ultimate burden of establishing, Defendant's motion for summary judgment does not challenge each element of each claim. 
Rather, Defendant's motion addresses solely the underlying 'wrongs' or anticompetitive conduct of predatory pricing and 
bundling. "
917,2,"  The court notes that it finds Defendant's reliance on Directory Sales misplaced. In Directory Sales, a yellow pages phone 
directory company sued Ohio Bell, the owner of the Ameritech Yellow Pages, for violating the Sherman Act. 833 F.2d at 608. 
The plaintiff alleged that by giving away free first listings in the yellow pages to companies who had business telephone service 
through Ohio Bell, the defendants were predatorily pricing below cost. Id. at 608-9. The court granted the defendants' motion for 
summary judgment on the plaintiff's predatory pricing claim, holding: Since the Defendants never sell the items they are giving away, first listings, they clearly are not giving them away with the 
expectation that customers will continue buying first listings in the future at a higher price. We are persuaded that the first 
listing is not a separate product or market for the purposes of predatory pricing, and that to demonstrate predatory pricing 
[plaintiff] would have to show that the Defendants' overall charges for advertising space in their yellow pages are priced 
below cost . . . the relevant area of inquiry should be [defendants'] operations taken as a whole . . . We point out that 
[plaintiff], in its complaint, alleged that the relevant product market was the yellow pages market, not the first listings market."
917,833," F.2d at 614. Respironics therefore argues that, just as it was incorrect to examine ""first listings"" as a separate market of 
yellow pages sales, it is incorrect to look at sleep lab mask sales as an independent market of mask sales. However, the court's 
ruling in Directory Sales was based on the finding that ""[d]efendants do not sell first listings, they sell subsequent listings."" Id. In 
the instant case, the facts do not support a similar finding. Although Respironics gave away many free masks to sleep labs, 
Respironics has not asserted that it always gives away, and never sells, masks to sleep labs. Thus, assuming that sleep lab 
masks are similar to first listings, the court cannot say Defendant does not sell masks to sleep labs. Second, the facts do not 
support a finding that sleep lab masks are any different than the regular masks sold to DMEs; there appears to be no difference 
between these items. In Directory Sales, on the other hand, the giveaway products -- first listings -- were a distinctly different 
product than the subsequent listings for sale. Id. (stating that customers cannot buy first listings; they may only buy subsequent 
listings). Finally, there is a difference in the groups to whom the products are given away. In the instant case, Defendant 
allegedly gives away masks to sleep labs, and later sells them to DMEs. In Directory Sales, the audience is the same: business 
customers."
917,3," Plaintiff's monopolization and attempted monopolization claims each allege both predatory pricing and bundling by name. (Id. 
PP 32, 39.) Plaintiff's Clayton Act claim alleges only price discrimination. (Id. P 47.) The Supreme Court has held that price discrimination claims under the Clayton Act should be treated the same as predatory 
pricing claims under the Sherman Act: "
918,," [P]rimary-line competitive injury under the Robinson-Patman Act [which amended the Clayton Act] is of the same general 
character as the injury inflicted by predatory pricing schemes actionable under § 2 of the Sherman Act. . . . [W]hatever 
additional flexibility the Robinson-Patman Act standard may imply, the essence of the claim under either statute is the 
same: A business rival has priced its products in an unfair manner with an object to eliminate or retard competition and 
thereby gain and exercise control over prices in the relevant market. . . . Accordingly, whether the claim alleges predatory pricing under § 2 of the Sherman Act or primary-line price discrimination 
under the Robinson-Patman Act, two prerequisites to recovery remain the same. Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 221-22, 113 S. Ct. 2578, 125 L. Ed. 2d 168 (1993). As 
such, the court's discussion of predatory pricing will incorporate and apply to Plaintiff's price discrimination claim as well."
918,4,"  Plaintiff argues that it can establish a predatory pricing claim without proving a below-cost price. (Pl. Br. in Opp'n 19-20, ECF No. 
63.) This argument, and Plaintiff's discussion of Spirit Airlines, Inc. v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 431 F.3d 917, 946 (6th Cir. 2005), 
are legally inaccurate. Spirit Airlines notes that ""in certain situations, a firm selling above average variable cost could be guilty of 
predation."" Id. at 938 (quoting D.E. Rogers Assocs., Inc. v. Gardner-Denver Co., 718 F.2d 1431 (6th Cir. 1983). This quote 
refers to the debate as to whether average variable cost or average total cost is the appropriate measure of cost to evaluate 
predation. See, e.g., Brooke Group, 509 U.S. at 223 n.1. Spirit Airlines does not hold that a party could show predatory pricing 
without any type of below-cost pricing. To the contrary, Spirit Airlines quotes the Supreme Court's statement that ""we have 
rejected elsewhere the notion that above-cost prices that are below general market levels or the cost of a firm's competitors 
inflict injury to competition cognizable under the antitrust laws."" Spirit Airlines, 431 F.3d at 937 quoting Brooke Group, 509 U.S. 
at 223). As discussed in Section III.B.2, infra, a party may show, however, other anticompetitive, exclusionary conduct -- such as 
bundling -- in the absence of below-cost pricing. See, e.g., LePage's, Inc., 324 F.3d 141 (3d Cir. 2003). "
919,5," In its opposition brief, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant is engaged in illegal tying, in addition to bundling. (Pl. Opp'n Br. 14-15, 
ECF No. 63.) As this allegation does not appear in the Complaint, the court need not address it in evaluating the motion for 
summary judgment. If Plaintiff had properly alleged tying, the claim would still fail as a matter of law. Tying occurs when a 
company sells products A and B together, where A is not available in the marketplace unless purchased with B: "
920,," An indispensable element of an unlawful tying arrangement is the seller's conditioning of the availability of product A on the 
purchase of product B. E.g., Eastman Kodak Co. [v. Image Tech. Servs., 504 U.S. 451, 494-495, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 119 L. 
Ed. 2d 265 (1992)] [parallel citations omitted]; Northern Pacific Ry. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 6 n.4, 78 S. Ct. 514, 2 L. 
Ed. 2d 545 [parallel citations omitted] (1958). Thus, if the tying product may be purchased without also buying the allegedly 
tied product, there can be no unlawful tying. Ortho Diagnostic Sys., Inc. v. Abbott Laboratories, Inc., 920 F. Supp. 455, 471 (S.D.N.Y. 1996). In the instant case, it is 
undisputed that consumers may purchase PAPs and masks individually; thus, a tying claim fails as a matter of law. "
931,1," Although both parties have filed certain documents under seal, the Court does not believe that this Order discloses any 
""confidential business proprietary"" information. However, if either party believes that such disclosures were made, the party may 
petition the Court to file the present Order under seal. "
932,2," Whether Mediacom was negotiating for the retransmission rights of the Tied Stations is vigorously contested. Mediacom 
alleges that it was not negotiating for the retransmission rights of the Tied Stations, while Sinclair asserts that Mediacom was 
negotiating for the retransmission rights of the Tied Stations, but that Mediacom just did not wish to pay for those rights."
932,3," This type of ad, known as a ""Per Inquiry"" ad, is apparently very common in the television industry. Faber P 61. "
933,4," In the Complaint, Mediacom alleges antitrust violation, tortious interference with contracts and business expectations, and 
unfair competition. However, Mediacom's motion for preliminary injunction only addresses the antitrust claim. Accordingly, the 
Court will limit the preliminary injunction analysis to the antitrust claim."
933,5," Mediacom, on the other hand, provides an at-will basis subscription. "
934,6," Courts have analyzed the ""antitrust injury"" inquiry under different preliminary injunction rubric. Some courts discuss ""antitrust 
injury"" under the irreparable harm factor, see Dos Santos v. Columbus-Cueno-Cabrini Med Ctr., 684 F.2d 1346, 1350 n.4 (7th 
Cir. 1982); Chemetron Corp. v. Crane Co., 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14107, No. 77 C 2800, 1977 WL 1491 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 8, 1977), 
while other courts analyze ""antitrust injury"" under the likelihood of success on the merits factor, see Black & Decker, Inc. v. 
Hoover Serv. Ctr., 765 F. Supp. 1129, 1141 (D. Conn. 1991); Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco, Inc., 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19673, No. 
84-C-29-E, 1984 WL 164045 (N.D. Okla. Feb. 8, 1984). Still other courts have addressed ""antitrust injury"" separately from the 
preliminary injunction inquiry, and discussed it as a standing issue under the Clayton Act. See AlliedSignal, Inc. v. B.F. Goodrich 
Co., 183 F.3d 568, 575-76 (7th Cir. 1999); Original Appalachian Artworks, Inc. v. Granada Elecs., Inc., 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
29114, No. 85 Civ. 9064, 1986 WL 2402 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 20, 1986). "
935,7, The Sinclair stations subject to termination of carriage by Mediacom are all available over the airwaves for free. Faber P 19.
935,8," It has been brought to the Court's attention that Mediacom intends to file a complaint with the FCC against Sinclair alleging 
violations of the good faith negotiation requirement. Def.'s Supp. Mem. in Opp'n to Pl.'s Mot. for a Prelim. Inj. at P 4. If Mediacom 
is, in fact, intending to file such a complaint, it only lends further support to the Court's conclusion that Mediacom will not suffer 
irreparable harm if the preliminary injunction is not granted. See Verizon Communications Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, 
LLP, 540 U.S. 398, 411, 124 S. Ct. 872, 157 L. Ed. 2d 823 (2004)(stating courts should be aware of industry regulations). "
936,9," However, HN11[
] in light of the recent Supreme Court decision, Ill. Tool Works Inc. v. Indep. Ink, Inc., 547 U.S. 28, 126 S. Ct."
936,1281," , 164 L. Ed. 2d 26 (2006), the application of the per se doctrine in antitrust cases, which side-stepped the market power 
analysis, should be approached with caution. The Supreme Court also noted that its ""strong disapproval of tying arrangements 
has substantially diminished"" over the years. Id. at 1286. "
937,10," As noted above, Sinclair's previous offer expired on October 5, 2006, and there was no ""packaged offer"" that Mediacom could 
elect as of October 6, 2006. Faber Supp. P 7."
937,11," Form 8-K is a document that public companies, such as Mediacom, must file with the Securities and Exchange Commission to 
announce certain significant changes. "
939,12," During the preliminary injunction hearing, counsel for Sinclair stated that there was only one product, retransmission rights, but 
that Sinclair would not press that point. Hr'g Tr. at 68. Mediacom's assertion that there are two distinct products is based on its 
own interpretation of viewer preferences and does not cite any authority holding that programming of major network affiliated 
stations is a distinct product from programming of non-major network affiliated stations."
939,13," Levinsohn explained that even if the relevant market is the market for transmission rights sold to Direct Broadcast Satellite 
operators and cable operators, or retransmission rights for the Tying Stations, it would still yield the same conclusion: Sinclair 
has market power. Levinsohn at 22-23. "
941,14," It appears to the Court that the price increase does not stem from the alleged illegal tying arrangement, but rather Sinclair's 
business decision to actively seek compensation for analog signals that it previously provided to cable operators, including 
Mediacom, for free. Faber P 11. "
948,1," After the plaintiffs filed this appeal but before it was briefed, plaintiff Nic Eichenseer requested that he ""be dismissed as a party 
and class representative."" Accordingly, we refer to the appellants in this opinion collectively as ""Dougherty."" "
949,2," ""Drink specials"" appears to be a term of art in this record referring to advertised promotions offering either (1) special, high-
potency drinks containing multiple shots of liquor or (2) multiple drinks for the price of one regular drink."
949,3," The ""Luther's Blues"" conditions requested by the UW and imposed by the City include the following: Not to increase the volume contained in a serving without increasing proportionately the price charged for such serving. Not to give away any drink or sell at a price that is different from the usual price for the drink for any period of time less than one 
full week. Not to give away any drink or reduce the price of any drink conditioned upon the purchase of any drink or number of drinks. Not to sell or give away an unlimited number of drinks during a set period of time for a fixed price."
949,4," Madison General Ordinances, section 3.56(3) vests the ALRC with the following powers and duties: HN2[
] The Alcohol 
License Review Committee shall be charged with the responsibility and duty to review and examine all applications for the 
granting of all fermented malt beverage licenses, intoxicating liquor licenses, and operator's licenses, to receive all 
recommendations relating thereto from staff personnel and to review and make recommendations as to the subsequent granting 
of all such licenses by the Common Council, and be further charged with the responsibility and duty to view the triennial ""Alcohol 
License Problem Report"" submitted by the Chief of Police and may conduct such additional review of problems reported therein 
with the licenses affected and make such further recommendations or take such further action as they may deem appropriate. 
The committee is further charged with providing a reason to the Common Council whenever the committee recommends that a 
new Chapter 38 license or permit not be approved. [Emphasis by the circuit court.]"
949,5," Existing taverns such as Regent Street Retreat and Buck's had Luther's Blues conditions imposed on their license renewals at 
the time they made changes to their businesses. The Nitty Gritty was threatened with similar restrictions at the time of a planned 
expansion. "
950,6," These reported statements of ALRC Chair Bruer are cited by the court as ""verbal acts"" and are not regarded for their truth. 
These statements are therefore not hearsay and may be considered by the Court on the parties' motions for summary judgment. "
951,7," Names of bars who simply didn't object to Lyshek's proposal for a voluntary drink special ban, and names of bars Lyshek knew 
had never offered drink specials on Friday and Saturday nights were included in the list of participating bars."
951,8, All references to the Wisconsin Statutes are to the 2003-04 version unless otherwise noted. 
954,9," HN12[
] The exemption from federal antitrust law for anticompetitive conduct instigated by ""state action"" addresses the interaction of arguably inconsistent enactments of two sovereigns, the state and federal governments, and it implicates notions 
of federalism as embodied in the Tenth and Eleventh Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. See Town of Hallie v. City of 
Chippewa Falls, 105 Wis. 2d 533, 537, 314 N.W.2d 321 (1982). The ""implied repeal"" defense against an alleged violation of 
Wisconsin's antitrust laws, on the other hand, addresses the interaction of arguably inconsistent enactments of a single 
sovereign, the state, and it involves a determination of whether, for a given activity, the legislature intends its antitrust 
prohibitions to apply, or whether it instead intends the activity to be regulated even though anticompetitive effects will result. See 
id. at 537-38. "
955,10," After detailing in its written decision the facts of record that established the ""enormous"" regulatory pressure the City brought to 
bear on the Taverns regarding drink specials, the circuit court summarized as follows: ""The conclusion from this scenario, is that 
but for the intense demands of the City [brought] through its ALRC, there would have been no voluntary ban on weekend drink 
specials by campus bar owners."""
955,11," See United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965), and Eastern R.R. 
Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961). "
956,12," The four statements Dougherty cites in his brief as examples of inadmissible opinions or hearsay are these: (1) The Tavern League President's statement that the ""actions taken by the Tavern League or the other defendants with regard 
to these issues has been in an effort to comply with the City's health and safety concerns and not for any commercial purpose."" (2) A Tavern owner's statement that ""local tavern owners are particularly sensitive to both formal and informal changes in the 
regulatory policies pursued by the City of Madison."" (3) Alderman Bruer's statement that ""Madison taverns and the downtown business community opposed the Sub-Committee's 
recommendations because they believed that the proposed ban was over-broad and that drink specials contributed little to high-
risk drinking and its effects."" (4) Alderman Verveer's statement that the Tavern League and tavern owners, ""believing that a city-wide, seven-day drink special 
ban was imminent, … considered what additional steps they could take to head off a total ban on nighttime drink specials."" To the extent that the statements in question constituted opinions of the affiant, the affidavits provided ample foundational facts 
to support those opinions. See WIS. STAT. RULE 907.01. To the extent that the statements contain what is apparently hearsay, 
they could easily have been rephrased to reflect the affiant's own belief or opinion. In short, were this case to be tried, we have 
little doubt that the Taverns would be able to introduce the substance of what is contained in the challenged statements by way 
of testimony from the affiants. "
964,1," As will be explained in greater detail in the analysis section, HN1[
] ""[t]ying is a form of marketing in which a seller insists on 
selling two distinct products or services as a package. A supermarket that will sell flour to consumers only if they will also buy 
sugar is engaged in tying. Flour is referred to as the tying product, sugar as the tied product."" Jefferson Parish Hospital Dist. No. 
2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 33, 104 S. Ct. 1551, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2 (1984). "
966,2," HN5[
]  Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides in relevant part: ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."" 15 
U.S.C. § 1. Section 2 of the Sherman Act proscribes monopolization, attempted monopolization and conspiracy to monopolize. 
NicSand, Inc. v. 3M Co., 457 F.3d 534, 542 (6th Cir. 2006)."
966,3," Various opinions discussing tying claims reference a ""per se analysis"" of such claims and a ""rule-of-reason"" analysis of tying 
claims. While Plaintiffs allege that Defendants' alleged tying arrangement is illegal under both a per se and rule of reason 
analysis, those HN10[
] two theories have merged in recent years. PSI Repair Services, Inc. v. Honeywell, Inc., 104 F.3d 811,"
966,815," n.2 (6th Cir. 1997);Compuware Corp. v. International Business Machines Corp., 366 F. Supp. 2d 475, 479 (E.D. Mich. 
2005). The two theories differ in only one respect - the per se analysis dispenses with proof of anticompetitive effects. Id. ""Thus, 
in this circuit, market power in the tying product market is an indispensable requirement under either per se or rule-of-reason 
analysis."" PSI, 104 F.3d at 815 n.2. "
967,4," Defendants also cite and rely on the following cases: American Key Corp. v. Cole Nat. Corp., 762 F.2d 1569, 1580-81 (11th 
Cir. 1985) (HN13[
] ""The relevant market is the area of effective competition in which competitors generally are willing to 
compete for the consumer potential, and not the market area of a single company.""); Flegel v. Christian Hosp. Northeast-
Northwest, 804 F. Supp. 1165, 1174 (E.D. Mo. 1992) (""The courts have consistently refused to limit the geographic market to a 
single hospital, where there are other hospitals operating in the surrounding area.""); and Dunafon v. Delaware McDonald's 
Corp., 691 F. Supp. 1232, 1242 (W.D. Mo. 1988) (finding geographic market of land within shopping mall was too narrow as a 
matter of law). "
970,5," HN22[
] The nature of a ""Kodak-type"" or ""lock in"" theory is that market power to support an antitrust claim is argued to exist 
because, after a customer buys one product he is then ""locked in"" by the seller to buy another product by virtue of the sellers' 
rules. In PSI for example, the plaintiff argued that there was an illegal tie between Honeywell equipment and the Honeywell 
repair parts for that equipment in the aftermarket. Honeywell had a restrictive policy requiring equipment owners to buy certain 
replacement parts from Honeywell (i.e. Honeywell would not sell those parts to outside repair services and would not let its 
manufacturer of those parts sell them to anyone outside Honeywell either). It was therefore claimed that after a sale of the 
equipment to a consumer, that consumer was ""locked in"" to buying the repair parts (the tied product) from Honeywell."
970,6," Even if Plaintiffs contended that they were relying on a lock-in theory, Plaintiffs have not sufficiently pled a ""lock-in"" theory in 
the complaint under PSI and Little Caesar Enterprises, Inc., which hold that HN23[
] an alleged lock-in theory fails unless the 
plaintiff also alleges that: 1) the defendant changed its rules after the sale was made, or 2) concealed its rules from its 
customers. PSI Repair Services, Inc. v. Honeywell, Inc., 104 F.3d 811 (6th Cir. 1997); Little Caesar Enterprises, Inc. v. Smith, 34 
F. Supp. 2d 459 (E.D. Mich. 1998). No such allegations are contained in Plaintiffs' Complaint. "
975,1," Paycom also asserted violations of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2, but has abandoned these claims on appeal."
975,2," The other three payment-card network service providers are Visa U.S.A., Inc., American Express, and Discover. United States 
v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., 163 F. Supp. 2d 322, 327 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) [hereinafter ""Visa I""]. "
976,3," Because certain distinctions between financial institutions have no bearing on the merits of this appeal, we refer to MasterCard 
members as ""banks"" even though many institutions that qualify for MasterCard membership are not, strictly speaking, banks. 
Most MasterCard member institutions, however, are indeed traditional banks. See Visa II, 344 F.3d at 235. "
977,4," A ""Chargeback Ratio"" is the ratio of MasterCard chargebacks received by a particular merchant in a given month to the total 
number and/or dollar volume of MasterCard sales transactions processed by that merchant in that month."
977,5," Paycom also challenged MasterCard's Internet Merchant Qualification Mandates but does not appeal from the dismissal of that 
claim. "
978,6," Visa maintained a similar policy, by-law 2.10(e), which prevented Visa member banks from participating as issuers or acquirers 
for any other payment-card network with the exception of MasterCard. Visa II, 344 F.3d at 236 & n.3. "
979,7," Section 1 of the Sherman Act prohibits HN4[
] ""[e]very contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States."" 15 U.S.C. § 1. "
981,8," Even if Paycom's assertion that Paycom ""conspired"" were adequate, it would, at most, allege a reduction of intrabrand 
competition, not interbrand competition. Indeed, the alleged agreement among MasterCard acquiring banks would offer 
competitors (like Discover and American Express) the ability to compete by offering merchants more favorable chargeback 
terms. A reduction in intrabrand competition is not sufficient to state an antitrust injury without some showing that ""intrabrand 
competition was a critical source of competitive pressure,"" Graphic Prods. Distribs., Inc. v. Hek Corp., 717 F.2d 1560, 1573 (11th 
Cir. 1983). Paycom has made no such showing. "
982,9," Our analysis here assumes without deciding that Paycom has suffered the requisite ""antitrust injury"" also necessary for 
standing. "
983,10," Because Paycom fails to state an antitrust injury or demonstrate antitrust standing with respect to its CBA-Rules claims, it is 
unnecessary to decide whether Paycom's claims that the CBA Rules create an unlawful ""market allocation scheme"" should be 
analyzed under rule of reason or per se analysis. "

is inherently illegal because it allows the arbitrator to choose the relevant law. This aspect of her allegation is analyzed briefly 
infra. "
989,20," Judge Brickner, moreover, explicitly stated that ""the application of either New York or federal law would not alter the ruling."" 
(Arbitration Award at 3). Collier therefore suffered no prejudice from his application of California law, even if the choice was 
erroneous."
989,21, Mot. at 5.
989,22," See id. at 10 (""The Arbitration clause . . . creates monopolization by the tying arrangements to the exclusive use of Submarket 
'Sears Repair' for the Service, Repair and Diagnostic Provider for appliances purchased from defendant Sears"")."
989,23, Id. at 3. 
990,24," Collier dedicates a sizeable portion of her motion to a discussion of case law addressing the severability of an arbitration 
clause from the balance of a contract when fraudulent inducement is alleged. (Mot. at 4-6). The court infers from this that Collier 
alleges fraud in the execution of the contract, the arbitration provision, or both. The only possible basis stated for such a claim is 
Collier's statement that ""[t]he crux of the plaintiff's claims is that the MPA as a whole, [and] specifically its arbitration provision[,] 
is rendered invalid by the tying arrangement, monopolization and the restraint on commerce and trade which the MPA presents."" 
(Id. at 5.) Even were this argument not foreclosed by Collier's willing initiation of arbitration proceedings, the court would reject it. Fraud in 
the execution of an arbitration agreement occurs when the ""promisor is deceived as to the nature of his act, and actually does 
not know what he is signing, or does not intend to enter into a contract at all."" Rosenthal v. Great Western Fin. Securities Corp., 
14 Cal.4th 394, 415, 58 Cal. Rptr. 2d 875, 926 P.2d 1061 (citing Ford v. Shearson Lehman American Express, Inc., 180 
Cal.App.3d 1011, 1028, 225 Cal. Rptr. 895 (1986)). ""Fraud in the execution does not render a written contract void where the 
defrauded party has a reasonable opportunity to discover the real terms of the contract before signing it."" Jones v. Adams 
Financial Services, 71 Cal.App.4th 831, 836, 84 Cal. Rptr. 2d 151 (1999). Rather, courts have found fraud in the execution 
where, for example, a party's physical or other impairment prevented her from discovering the nature of the contract. Id. at 837. 
See also Rosenthal, 14 Cal.4th at 427-29; Gardner v. Rubin, 149 Cal.App.2d 368, 375, 308 P.2d 892 (1957). Collier does not 
allege that she was unable to read, understand, or consent to the contract and its provisions. Nor does she dispute Sears' 
assertion that she signed each of the MPAs. (See Opp. at 3:15-16). Moreover, her legal briefs and handwritten letters to Sears 
show that she is fully capable of reading, understanding, and interpreting legal language. (See, e.g., Collier Decl., Exh B (Letters 
to Sears))."
990,25," The court cannot credit this argument, even were it not waived by Collier's initiation of the arbitration proceedings. An 
unconscionability argument requires that both procedural and substantive unconscionability be demonstrated. Circuit City "
991,," Stores, Inc. v. Ahmed, 283 F.3d 1198, 1199 (9th Cir. 2002); Fittante v. Palm Springs Motors, Inc., 105 Cal.App.4th 708, 722-23, 
129 Cal. Rptr. 2d 659 (2003). ""The procedural element focuses on two factors: 'oppression' and 'surprise.' 'Oppression' arises from an inequality of 
bargaining power which results in no real negotiation and 'an absence of meaningful choice.' Surprise' involves the extent to 
which the supposedly agreed-upon terms of the bargain are hidden in a prolix printed form drafted [*16]  by the party 
seeking to enforce the disputed terms. The substantive prong of unconscionability encompasses 'overly harsh' or 'one-
sided' results. Stated another way, '[t]he substantive component of unconscionability looks to whether the contract allocates 
the risks of the bargain in an objectively unreasonable or unexpected manner.'"" Fittante, 105 Cal. App .4th at 722-23 
(citations omitted). Collier alleges in broad terms that she ""was forced to protect the merchantability of a major investment by the purchase of a 
MPA on the products. Defendant Sears sold a MPA which is one-sided."" (Reply at 4 (emphasis original)). She also asserts that 
the MPAs was ""offered on a 'take it or leave basis.'"" (Id. at 2.) These conclusory statements do not meet Collier's burden of 
showing that she had unequal bargaining power at the time she entered into the MPAs, that she was unaware of the arbitration 
clause, or that the terms of the clause were so unfair and unreasonable as to shock the conscience. In addition, Collier raised this unconscionability claim only in her reply. It is well-established that courts will not consider 
arguments raised for the first time in reply. See Stewart v. Wachowski, No. CV 03-02873 MMM, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32852, 
2004 WL 2980783, *11 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 16, 2004) (refusing to consider an argument raised for the first time in reply); see also 
Dietrich v. Trek Bicycle Comp., 279 F.Supp.2d 1122, 1128 (W.D. Wis. 2003) (same)."
991,26," Mot. at 6-7 (citing N.Y. CONST. art. X, § 4 (""[A]ll corporations shall have the right to sue and shall be subject to be sued in all 
courts in like cases as natural persons"")). As noted, the court declines to consider this argument because Collier has waived it 
by voluntarily initiating arbitration proceedings. Moreover, the constitutional provision she cites does not prevent New York 
corporations from agreeing to alternative forms of dispute resolution and thus exercising their power to contract. Dormitory Auth. 
v. Span Elec. Corp., 18 N.Y.2d 114, 271 (1966) ("" [T]he power to contract implies the power to assent to the settlement of 
disputes by means of arbitration""); Department of Health & Rehab. Servs. v. E.D.S. Fed. Corp., 631 So.2d 353, 356 (Fla. App. 
1994) (""[T]he power to contract implies the power to agree to settlement of disputes under the contract by arbitration"" (citation 
omitted)). In fact, it is the precisely the capacity to sue or be sued that permits corporations to submit disputes to arbitration. See 
City of Atlanta v. Brinderson Corp., 799 F.2d 1541, 1543 (11th Cir. 1986) (""Such a power [to arbitrate] is incident to its capacity 
to contract or make settlements, and its powers to sue and be sued"")."
991,27," The court notes that ""a party is not relieved from an agreement to arbitrate on the ground that the contract is allegedly void for 
violation of the antitrust laws unless plaintiffs demonstrate that the Court's enforcement of the arbitration provision would make 
the Court a party to the unlawful activity."" Jung v. Association of American Medical Colleges, 300 F.Supp.2d 119, 154 (D.D.C. 
2004). See also Dickstein v. duPont, 443 F.2d 783, 786 (1st Cir. 1971) (antitrust defenses to arbitration are ""allowed only in 
cases where the intrinsic illegality of the contract is so clear that enforcement would make a court party to the precise conduct 
forbidden by the law""); In re Universal Service Fund Telephone Billing Practices Litigation, No. 02-MD-1468, 2003 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 9235, 2003 WL 21254765, *3 (D. Kan. May 27, 2003) (finding an arbitration clause enforceable and concluding that ""a 
contract that is legal on its face and does not call for unlawful conduct in its performance is not voidable or unenforceable simply 
because it resulted from an antitrust conspiracy""); see also Kelly v. Kosuga, 358 U.S. 516, 518, 79 S. Ct. 429, 3 L. Ed. 2d 475 
(1959) (""[A] plea of illegality based on violation of the Sherman Act has not met with much favor in this Court""); National 
Souvenir Center, Inc. v. Historic Figures, Inc., 728 F.2d 503, 514-16, 234 U.S. App. D.C. 222 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (the ""remote 
danger"" that the court would be a party to enforcing an illegal restraint was ""outweighed by the probability that allowing the 
[antitrust] defense would let the buyer escape from its side of a bargain""). As noted, Collier's allegations are insufficient to state a 
claim for violation of the antitrust laws. She therefore does not allege facts indicating that enforcement of the arbitration clause 
would ""make the [c]ourt a party to the unlawful activity."" Jung, 300 F.Supp.2d at 154. "

2006); see also Ferring B.V. v. Barr Labs., Inc., 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 10811 (Fed. Cir. 2006). A Petition for a Writ of Certiorari 
was filed with the Supreme Court on September 11, 2006, an extension having been granted by Chief Justice Roberts, and 
certiorari was denied by the United States Supreme Court on October 30, 2006. "
1011,2," The Court notes the unusual circumstance in this case, that none of the generic manufacturers, originally sued by Ferring for 
infringement of the '398 patent, asserted antitrust counterclaims. See April 15, 2005 Transcript at 41-42. ""An antitrust claim 
premised on stripping a patentee of its immunity under the antitrust laws, is typically raised as a counterclaim by a defendant in a 
patent infringement. suit."" Nobelpharma Ab v. Implant Innovations, 141 F.3d 1059, 1067 (Fed. Cir. 1998). "
1013,3," In her dissent in Ferring I, Judge Newman noted that the record ""does not indicate sufficient culpability to require a finding of 
intent to deceive."" Id at p. 1205. "
1029,1," The parties do not contest that the state antitrust claims are governed by the same law as the federal claims, and so the 
outcome on the federal claims is determinative of the state statutory claims as well. See Howard v. Minnesota Timberwolves 
Basketball L.P., 636 N.W.2d 551, 556 (Minn. App. 2001). "
1032,2," Another common prerequisite is the existence of market power, meaning that a defendant has the ability to set prices or 
exclude competition in a relevant product market. See generally United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 571, 86 S. Ct. 
1698, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778 (1966). Although Becton has not argued that the complaint is inadequate for failure to plead market 
power, UltiMed raises the issue in its opposing brief. This issue, however, is not relevant to Becton's motion for judgment on the 
pleadings and it does not require discussion. "
1033,3," Becton devotes substantial argument to a third theory, predatory pricing. It contends that, because UltiMed has not alleged that 
Becton engaged in below-cost pricing or discounts, this theory fails as a matter of law. Cf. Barr Labs., Inc. v. Abbott Labs., 978 
F.2d 98, 105-06 (3d Cir. 1992) (examining whether below-cost discounts constituted predatory pricing). A careful reading of the 
complaint, however, shows that UltiMed has not alleged this practice. And UltiMed, in its brief opposing the motion for judgment 
on the pleadings, does not mention this theory. Because Becton contests a theory that is not advanced in the complaint, and 
because UltiMed has not advanced the theory on its own behalf, it does not require further discussion here. "
1035,4," Although courts sometimes acknowledge that a more rigorous foreclosure standard applies when examining claims under § 3 
of the Clayton Act, that difference is not material to the analysis here. See, e.g., Barr Labs., Inc. v. Abbott Labs., 978 F.2d 98, 
110 (3d Cir. 1992). "
1036,5," The following analysis only considers the allegations needed to show an anticompetitive practice. Consistent with the elements 
of monopolization or attempted monopolization under § 2 of the Sherman Act, many authorities further emphasize that the 
plaintiff must also allege either outright acquisition of monopoly power by the defendant or a dangerous probability of it. In re 
Microsoft Corp. Antitrust Litigation, 333 F.3d 517, 532 (4th Cir. 2003); Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. v. British Airways PLC, 257 
F.3d 256, 272 (2d Cir. 2001); see also Verizon Communications v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP, 540 U.S. 398, 407 n. 5, 
124 S. Ct. 872, 157 L. Ed. 2d 823 (2004) (intimating that the absence of this element bars a monopoly leveraging theory). The parties do not reach this issue, and so it does not require further analysis. But it bears noting that this analysis also shares 
common factual issues with the question whether, for claims under § 1 of the Sherman Act and § 3 of the Clayton Act, the 
plaintiff has sufficiently alleged market foreclosure. See XI Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P 1800c (2d ed. 2005). "
1047,1," Additional named defendants were American Seeds Inc., Corn States Hybrid Service Inc., Asgrow Seed Company, Inc., 
Holden Foundation Seeds, Inc., Dekalb Seeds, Calgene, L.L.C., Channel Bio Company, NC+ Hybrids, and Seminis Inc. (D.I. 1)"
1047,2," ""Roundup Ready TM ""-branded seeds contain this trait, whose name reflects the seeds' resilience to Roundup TM glyphosate 
herbicide."
1047,3," ""Yieldgard TM""- branded seeds contain this trait."
1047,4," For example, one of plaintiffs' proffered National Direct Purchaser Classes is described as: "
1048,," A class of persons directly purchasing corn seed from Monsanto Company (including its controlled subsidiaries) which is 
tolerant of glyphosate herbicide between July 26, 2001 and the present, excluding citizens of the States of Iowa and 
Minnesota, persons affiliated with Monsanto, and governmental entities. (D.I. 96 at 2) In comparison, one of plaintiffs' proffered Iowa classes is described as: A class of persons who are citizens of Iowa and who have purchased, from Monsanto Company (including its named 
controlled seed companies) or its independent distributors, corn seed which is tolerant of glyphosate herbicide between 
July 29, 2001 and the present, excluding persons affiliated with Monsanto and governmental agencies. (Id. at 3)"
1048,5," Dr. Lessor's benchmarks are: (1) Monsanto's sales in Spain of its YieldGard TM ECB-resistant seed from 2003 to 2005; and (2) 
Monsanto's sales of its Pioneer/YieldGard TM ECB-resistant seed in the United States before its alleged monopolization of the 
GM corn seed market. (D.I. 100 at 13; D.I. 103 at 7-11) "
1049,6," The corollary to this rule, iterated in Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, is that downstream (or indirect) purchasers do not have standing 
to sue for costs ""passed-on"" to them. See McCarthy v. Recordex Service, Inc., 80 F.3d 842, 849 (3d Cir. 1996) (""Permitting the 
use of pass-on theories . . . essentially would transform treble-damages actions into massive efforts to apportion the recovery 
among all potential plaintiffs that would have absorbed part of the overcharge--from direct purchasers to middlemen to ultimate 
consumers."") (citing Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 737, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977)) (collecting Third 
Circuit precedent). Plaintiffs have characterized the Iowa and Minnesota classes as encompassing ""indirect purchasers"" of 
transgenic seed. (D.I. 133 at 6-7) However, plaintiffs have cited authority which demonstrates that state law in Iowa and 
Minnesota allows for indirect purchasers to recover damages. Gordon v. Microsoft Corp., No. Civ. A. 00-5994, 2001 WL 366432, 
*7 & *13 (D. Minn. Mar. 30, 2001) (certifying indirect purchaser class under ""Illinois Brick repealer statute"" Minn. Stat. § 
325D.57); Comes v. Microsoft Corp., 646 N.W.2d 440, 445 & 449 (Iowa 2002) (holding that Iowa Competition Law codified at 
Iowa Code §§ 553.4 and 553.5 creates a cause of action for indirect purchasers, and stating that the policy considerations of 
Illinois Brick ""have little, if any, applicability to antitrust suits in state court.""). Plaintiffs' argument regarding the standing of 
American Seed does not run afoul of the request for the certification of the indirect purchaser classes in this case."
1049,7," Even should the court accept plaintiffs' first amended complaint adding Jerry Ellefson as a representative of the National Direct 
Purchaser Classes, the standing issue may persist if American Seed is not a proper class member. (D.I. 154)"
1049,8," Plaintiffs and Dr. Kamien allege that seed dealers pass through all overcharges to the Iowa and Minnesota class members, 
which constitutes common proof of injury with respect to those classes. (D.I. 133 at 6-7; D.I. 104 at 14) "
1050,9," One benchmark in Bradburn was the market for the product at issue, transparent tape, before defendant's alleged 
anticompetitive activity commenced. 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16193, 2004 WL 1842987 at *13. The other benchmark was the 
market for ""wrap and mail"" tape, another tape market, in 1993 when defendant reduced its prices due to increased competition. 
Id. The Bradburn court stated that ""[t]he two benchmarks proposed by Dr. Kamien are standard methods for proving damages in 
an antitrust case."" 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16193, [WL] at *15 (citing Nichols v. Smithkline Beecham Corp., No. Civ. A. 00-6222, 
2003 U.S. DIST. Lexis 2049, at *24 (E.D.Pa. Jan. 29, 2003)) (internal quotations omitted))."
1050,10," Dr. Kamien argued in Bradburn that gross margin data was critical to determining whether defendant raised its prices because 
of increased competition or, alternatively, due to other factors such as changes in the cost of production. 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
16193, 2004 WL 1842987 at *16. "
1051,11," The Bradburn court rejected defendant's attack on Dr. Kamien's methodology for failing to take into account the complexities 
of the transparent tape market, noting that: (1) the facts demonstrated that of 2000 asserted brands, 100 brands of tape 
constituted 80% of defendant's sales; (2) Dr. Kamien opined that the pricing behavior of the remaining 20% would follow the 
majority; and (3) testimony in the case demonstrated that defendant maintained databases which tracked prices charged to each 
customer for each product, including data on rebates and promotional allowances. 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16193, 2004 WL 
1842987 at *17. "
1052,12," The classes in Sample were persons who purchased GM seeds ""at any time from January 1, 1996 to the present."" 218 F.R.D. 
at 646-47. Plaintiffs' motion to certify the classes in Sample was brought on January 17, 2003."
1052,13," Dr. Kamien cites the deposition testimony of Anthony Leisure, Monsanto's designee on pricing, for the proposition that the 
requisite cost and margins data should be available, as well as data relating to licenses given to Iowa and Minnesota growers. 
(D.I. 104 at 12, 15) It is not clear to the court why plaintiffs did not seek or, alternatively, could not obtain such data during class 
discovery. Nevertheless, data availability is a separate inquiry. "
1053,14," If in fact defendants' gross margins for the seeds at issue would allow Dr. Kamien to determine defendants' response to 
competition in the marketplace, irrespective of movements in the price charged to the end user, Dr. Kamien's omission may not 
be fatal. Under the same logic, the same may be true with respect to Dr. Kamien's failure to consult retailers, seed companies, or 
growers. (D.I. 166 at 139:10-140:7) Notwithstanding, as discussed in Blades, the genetically modified seed market is sufficiently 
more complicated than Dr. Kamien's analysis allows."
1053,15," Dr. Kamien testified that he has not analyzed price differences between varieties of GM corn seed containing different types of 
germplasm. (D.I. 166 at 194:2 - 195:1)"
1053,16," In addition to the plain language of plaintiffs' definitions, plaintiffs' statement that, ""although Monsanto disputes that purchasers 
of its foundation seed - i.e., seed used to produce hybrid seed varieties - should be included in the classes that are certified by "
1054,," th[e] Court, it has not disputed that full transaction data are available for foundation seed,"" indicates that plaintiffs seek inclusion 
of foundation seed purchasers. (D.I. 133 at 6)"
1054,17," This case does not represent the first instance in which a distinction between foundation seed and hybrid seed has been 
recognized. In a separate litigation currently pending before the court, plaintiffs have withdrawn counts relating to Monsanto's 
alleged monopolization of the market for GM foundation seed. Syngenta Seeds Inc. v. Monsanto Co., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
4651, No. Civ. A. 04-908 (order granting leave to file third amended complaint docketed at Monsanto Co. v. Syngenta Seeds 
Inc., No. Civ. A. 04-305, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84963, D.I. 522 (Nov. 8, 2006)). Claims relating to hybrid seed remain in the 
litigation. Id."
1054,18," In the event that certain seed companies purchased both types of seed during the class period, it is even less clear how 
common proof could apply to those customers. "
1055,19," During the discovery conferences held with the court, plaintiffs never suggested that they had tried to conduct market-based 
discovery and were thwarted in their efforts to do so by defendants. "
1060,1," Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed Count III, which alleged a violation of § 4 of the Clayton Act. "
1061,2," The Illinois Antitrust Act is narrower in scope than § 2 of the Sherman Act; the Illinois law requires an improper purpose, while 
the federal law does not. Gilbert's Ethan Allen Gallery, 162 Ill. 2d at 104. This distinction, however, does not change the court's 
ruling on the instant motion. "
1062,3," To claim that an exclusive dealing arrangement violates § 3(4) of the Illinois Antitrust Act, plaintiff must also allege ""substantial"" 
foreclosure from the marketplace. Tampa Elec. Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., 365 U.S. 320, 327, 81 S. Ct. 623, 5 L. Ed. 2d 580 
(1961). Plaintiff has not alleged that defendant's actions excluded it from the market in any capacity; in fact, plaintiff is still a 
market participant. "
1065,1," PL&E was the business most directly involved in the actions which prompted this lawsuit as it serves Mecklenburg, Cabarrus, 
Union, Anson, and Stanley Counties. PS&S serves Anson and surrounding Counties. PS&S was allegedly injured, however, 
when Outdoor Equipment Distributors, Inc. cancelled its dealer agreement with PL&E because the agreement it had with PS&S 
was cancelled the same day."
1065,2," The Defendants Robert L. Zucker, Jr., Matthew J. Machtay, and Lori White are all employees of OED and throughout this 
Memorandum and Recommendation are referred to collectively as ""OED."" "
1066,3, Randy Pinkston is the Plaintiff Robert Franklin Pinkston's son and is founder and president of PL&E.
1066,4," The Agreement also contains a mediation and arbitration, forum selection and choice of law clause. The Plaintiffs argue that in 
spite of the terms of the Agreement that the arbitration clause is not binding and that North Carolina is the proper forum and 
choice of law. For the purposes of this Memorandum and Recommendation the undersigned has applied North Carolina law 
because even under the Plaintiffs' choice of law the claims do not survive. In regards to the arbitration clause, Exmark states that 
""in the interests of expeditiously and economically disposing of this case, Exmark joins in OED's Motion to Dismiss since 
plaintiffs have asserted no viable claims,"" but that it does not waive its rights under the mediation and arbitration clause. "
1068,5," Although not specifically stated, the undersigned assumes that the Plaintiffs intended to attach the same documents attached 
to their Complaint to their Second Amended Complaint, as they continue to refer to these documents in the Second Amended 
Complaint."
1068,6," The Plaintiffs' original Complaint (document #1) was filed on May 17, 2006. The Plaintiffs then filed their first Amended 
Complaint (document #3) on May 31, 2006, as of right, prior to the time any of the Defendants filed an Answer or otherwise 
responded. On July 12, 2006, all three sets of Defendants filed Motions to Dismiss (document ##23, 25-26). The Plaintiffs 
initially responded to the Motions to Dismiss, but later sought leave to amend their Amended Complaint (document #39). In light 
of the liberal standard for allowing a party to amend its Complaint, the undersigned allowed that request, and as such, 
recommended that the Motions to Dismiss be denied as moot (document #48). "
1070,7," In addition, the Allied Court stated: ""[t]here is no evidence that defendant was incapable of understanding the contract, or that 
plaintiff's conduct was of such a type as to deceive a person of ordinary prudence, or that any device was used to prevent 
defendant from reading the contract."" Id. at 31, 212 S.E.2d at 49. "
1075,1," Because there has been no motion for class certification, facts pertaining to class members other than Hauk are not at issue at 
this point. "
1077,2," On October 3, 2005, the Court held a hearing on Plaintiff's Motion to Dismiss. Due to a factual dispute about the identity of the 
governing Cardmember Agreement, the Court denied the Motion. Since that time, Plaintiff has abandoned his version of the 
operating document and accepted Defendant's version of the Cardmember Agreement. Consequently, Plaintiff's arguments now 
differ from the pleadings in the First Amended Complaint. "
1079,3," The July 6 Order appears to suggest a different interpretation of the law. It cites to Chern v. Bank of America, 15 Cal. 3d 866, 
127 Cal. Rptr. 110, 544 P.2d 1310 (1976), for the proposition that Defendant may have violated the UCL in spite of ""disclosures 
made else where [sic] in the same document."" (Order at 25.) However, a closer examination of Chern suggests that it does not 
support this theory. In Chern, the defendant bank quoted an interest rate to plaintiff of nine percent on the telephone. 15 Cal. 3d 
at 870. When Plaintiff went to the bank, she was given a promissory note providing for interest at the rate of nine percent ""per 
annum."" Id. Plaintiff was simultaneously given a ""Federal Truth in Lending Statement,"" which disclosed that the annual 
percentage rate on the loan would be nine and one-quarter percent. Id. This discrepancy is due to the fact that the ""per annum"" 
interest rate was calculated on the basis of a 360-day year, but plaintiff would eventually be charged at a rate based on a 365-
day year. Id. Plaintiff filed a § 17500 claim. Id. at 870-71. The court concluded that this practice was likely to deceive the public, 
as a year is commonly known as having 365 or 366 days. Id. at 876. The court emphasized that the defendant did not disclose 
the accurate annual rate in its initial communications, but instead ""withh[e]ld such information until the customer . . . entered its 
premises."" Id. Thus, the court held that the defendant violated § 17500. Id. Thus, the key factor in Chern appeared to be that the defendant did not initially disclose that its interest rate was calculated on 
the basis of a 360-day year - not that the disclosure in the truth in lending papers was inadequate. This interpretation of Chern is 
buttressed by the cases discussed below, which hold that disclosures in a document can preclude that document from being 
misleading. "
1080,4," The validity of these approaches has been in doubt since the California Supreme Court's decision in Cel-Tech 
Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co., 20 Cal. 4th 163, 83 Cal. Rptr. 2d 548, 973 P.2d 527 (1999). The 
Cel-Tech court criticized Casa Blanca and Motor's formulations as ""too amorphous and provide too little guidance to courts and 
businesses."" Id. at 183. Cel-Tech held that ""[w]hen a plaintiff who claims to have suffered injury from a direct competitor's 'unfair' 
act or practice invokes section 17200, the word 'unfair' in that section means conduct that threatens an incipient violation of an 
antitrust law."" Id. By tethering the UCL to the antitrust laws in the context of suits between competitors, Cel-Tech in effect 
narrowed the range of conduct actionable under the UCL. However, Cel-Tech expressly limited its holding to actions brought by 
business competitors; its applicability to the consumer context has been subject to differing views in the California courts. In 
Smith v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., 93 Cal. App. 4th 700, 113 Cal. Rptr. 2d 399 (2001), the court stated that 
Cel-Tech did not apply to the consumer context. However, in Scripps Clinic v. Superior Court, 108 Cal. App. 4th 917, 940, 134 
Cal. Rptr. 2d 101 (2003), the court concluded that, in a consumer action alleging unfairness on the basis of public policy, the 
predicate policy must be tethered to specific constitutional, statutory, or regulatory provisions. Smith is probably most relevant to 
this case, however, because Plaintiff does not allege a violation of public policy."
1080,5," This is somewhat difficult to reconcile with State Farm, which noted that the UCL imposes strict liability. 45 Cal. App. 4th at 
1102. "
1081,6," It is also important to note that no California case has held that a business practice is unfair merely because it is primarily - or 
solely - motivated by greed. Indeed, since not all corporations are nonprofit entities, one can reasonably expect that greed is a 
common motive in the business world. Thus, Plaintiff's contention that Defendant's conduct is ""unfair"" under the UCL because 
Defendant's only motive was greed lacks merit. "
1086,1," Advantage and Stenotech can certainly raise preemption at the Rule 50 stage, and re-argue it in light of the evidence 
Stenograph presents in support of its conversion claim. "
1089,2," To be absolutely clear, when I refer to ""copies"" of Stenograph software in this section on Stenograph's conversion claim, I 
mean the physical, tangible objects containing Stenograph's software - the disks. "
1098,3," The only case that Advantage cites, Green Leaf Nursery v. E.I. Dupont De Nemours & Co.,135 F.Supp.2d 1271, 1277-78 (S.D. 
Fla. 2001), is inapposite. In that case, the court held that a choice of law provision in a settlement did not govern a contracting 
party's fraudulent inducement claim because the party was attempting to avoid the settlement's effect. See id. at 1277-78. By 
contrast, Advantage is trying to broaden the scope of the release, and enforce it against Stenograph. Cf. Green Leaf Nursery v. 
E.I. Dupont De Nemours & Co., 341 F.3d 1292, 1301 (11th Cir. 2003)(""this type of narrow choice-of-law clause calls for the 
application of the selected law to determine only the scope and effect of the release"") (affirming district court's decision). "
1100,1," Plaintiffs' Request for Oral Argument, based on Local Rule 7.5, is hereby DENIED. The briefings in this cause are both 
thorough and prolix. Plaintiffs requested and obtained from this court leave to file excess pages in their pleadings. Therefore, we 
are able to reach our decision based upon these pleadings, and oral argument on the issues before us is unnecessary."
1100,2," There are thirty-four ICI-member highway contractors who have assigned their bargaining rights to ICI for the purpose of labor 
negotiations with the Laborers. In addition, over two hundred other contractors have agreed to be bound by the current collective 
bargaining agreement between the Laborers and ICI. Laborers' Mem. at 2. These contractors are collectively referred to as the 
""ICI Contractors."""
1100,3," Collective bargaining agreements for ICI are negotiated by its Labor Relations Division, known as ""ICI-LRD."" "
1101,4," Section 8(f) of the NLRA (29 U.S.C. § 158(f)) allows for employers in the building and construction industry to form 
""prerecognition agreements"" with labor unions. Prerecognition agreements allow an employer to agree to bargain with the union 
for a limited period of time, but the employer does not formally recognize the union. In contrast, in a more permanent Section 
9(a) relationship, ""once a union has become the representative of a majority of the employees in an appropriate bargaining unit, 
the employer is required to bargain with the union as the employees' bargaining representative."" NLRB v. Goodless Bros. Elec. 
Co., 285 F.3d 102, 104-05 (1st Cir. 2002) (quoting NLRB v. Goodless Elec. Co., 124 F.3d 322, 324 (1st Cir. 1997))."
1101,5," United Rentals, however, notes that its employees do not work as flaggers. Pl.'s Am. Mem. at 5."
1101,6," Am. Compl. Ex. B. This provision will hereinafter be referred to as the ""subcontracting clause."" "
1102,7," Am. Compl. Ex. A at 3. The Laborers note that every collective bargaining agreement since 1968 has included this language. 
Laborers' Mem. at 7, citing Lee aff. Exs. A-M."
1102,8," Laborers' Mem. at 7, citing Lee Aff., Ex. Q, pp. 5-6."
1102,9," Previous collective bargaining agreements between Laborers and ICI-LRD had not included such clauses. For example, the 
1999 agreement provided that: ICI-LRD encourages its members to utilize sub-contractors who are signatory to collective bargaining agreements with the 
Laborers Union. Such sub-contractors help to promote the peace and harmony of the job-site and to avoid labor dispute 
interruption of work. To help facilitate the utilization of signatory sub-contractors, each Contractor shall inquire of each of its 
sub-contractors whether such Contractor is signatory to an agreement with the Laborers, and if not, the Contractor shall 
notify the Laborers Union of the name, address and telephone number of such sub-contractor prior to the commencement 
of work by the sub-contractor who is not signatory. Further, any [sub-]contractor awarded a portion of the job-site work of a signatory Employer performing job-site construction 
work covered by this Agreement, shall pay wages, fringe benefit contributions, and abide by all terms and working 
conditions set forth in this Agreement while such sub-contractor is on the project. Am. Compl. P 35. "
1103,10," United Rentals states that it had not performed work for 15 out of the 34 ICI Contractors between April 1, 2003, and April 1, 
2004. Therefore, these 15 contractors could not subcontract traffic control site work to United Rentals, effective May 25, 2004. 
Am. Compl. P 53. "
1104,11, ICI was also named as a charged party with respect to the 8(e) claim. Laborers' Mem. at 9.
1104,12," Laborers' Mem. at 10, citing Lee Aff. Ex. T, U. The dismissal letter, in part, states that: With regard to the agreement between . . . [the] District Council and ICI, the evidence was insufficient to establish a 
violation. Thus, the agreement is between the Union and employers in the construction industry and, by its terms, is limited 
to work to be performed at the site of construction. The investigation revealed that much of the work that the Charging Party contracted to perform for E&B and other ICI 
contractors was actually work to be performed at the jobsite. The Charging Party was responsible, among other things, for 
setting up and moving barriers, flashing arrow boards, and changeable message signs throughout the course of the road 
construction project. Additionally, it was responsible for both placing and removing wording and striping on the road 
surface. Thus, the evidence was insufficient to establish a violation of the Act since such on-site work is covered by the 
construction industry proviso to Section 8(e). Lee Aff. Ex. U. "
1105,13, Id. 
1107,14, 29 U.S.C. § 158(e).
1107,15," The Supreme Court has given significant weight to the legislative history of the construction industry proviso, passed in 1959, 
in interpreting the clause. In Woelke & Romero Framing v. NLRB, 456 U.S. 645, 657, 102 S. Ct. 2071, 72 L. Ed. 2d 398 (1982), 
the Court stated that ""statements [contained in the legislative record] reveal that Congress wished to preserve the status quo 
regarding agreements between unions and contractors in the construction industry. . . . To the extent that subcontracting 
agreements were part of the pattern of collective bargaining in the collective bargaining in the construction industry, and lawful, 
Congress wanted to ensure that they remained lawful. Given this expression of legislative intent, we can determine whether 
[subcontracting clauses] are within the scope of the proviso . . . by examining Congress' perceptions regarding the status quo in 
the construction industry."" Though the Seventh Circuit has noted that it ""cannot find in the legislative record any clearly articulated reason for the inclusion 
of the construction industry proviso,"" it notes that ""numerous courts and commentators have concluded . . . that [it] exists 
because of an underlying congressional concern with minimizing jobsite tension"" and that ""[t]he Supreme Court has recently

1107,17," In addition, the Laborers contend in the alternative that the subcontracting clause is a ""work preservation"" clause, aimed to 
preserve for the Laborers work they had historically performed. Laborers' Mem. at 15. Clauses with this primary purpose are not 
prohibited by Section 8(e). See, e.g., Local 282, Teamsters, 197 NLRB 673 (1972). United Rentals contests this assertion on 
two grounds: first, that traffic control work has not historically been performed by the Laborers, and second, that the objective of 
the subcontracting clause has only a secondary objective of work preservation. Pl.'s Am. Mem. at 2, 21-24. Because we hold 
herein that the subcontracting clause is lawful under Section 8(e) by virtue of the construction industry proviso, we do not 
address this alternative argument. "

1109,19," Cf. In re South Jersey Regional Council of Carpenters, Local 623, 335 NLRB 586 (2001), relied upon by United Rentals. In 
that case, the NLRB ruled on the inapplicability of the proviso to the trade show industry - the industry in which the employer, not 
just the subcontractor, was engaged."
1109,20," The Woelke clause provided that employers could not contract work ""to be done at the site of the construction, alteration, 
painting or repair of a building, structure, or other work"" to a nonsignatory entity. Id. at 9."
1109,21," As evidence for this assertion, the Laborers cite the fact that United Rentals spends approximately 35% of its monthly labor 
costs on ""Davis-Bacon"" wages - a wage requirement applicable only to on-site work. Id. at 20. "
1110,22," The Laborers respond that they have no authority to control individual ICI Contractors' methods of soliciting bids from or

Cir. 1966). In that case, the Board relied on the fact that ""[t]he pouring of the concrete is the essence of and constitutes the 
actual delivery because liquid concrete, by its very nature, cannot be dumped on the ground at the construction site like other 
materials. While the liquid concrete is still in the agitator truck, it has not been delivered until the actual delivery by pouring."" Id. 
at 491. In addition, the concrete mixing work was not ""on-site"" because ""[t]hough the mixing may have taken place on the site, it 
could equally have taken place off site, the location of the mixing act being highly immaterial to the mixing operation itself."" "

single conjunction, use a comma after each term except the last."")."
1111,26," To our ear, this is not the most natural reading of the clause. For one, the series would be connected inconsistently by 
commas and sometimes the word ""or,"" in violation of the serial comma rule discussed above. Secondly, the series would 
encompass, separately, both work to be done at the site of construction and work to be done at the site of new construction. This 
reading seems to render some of the words of the clause superfluous. Compare the canons of statutory construction discussed 
by the Supreme Court in Duncan v. Walker, 533 U.S. 167, 174, 121 S. Ct. 2120, 150 L. Ed. 2d 251 (2001) (""It is our duty to give

no clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant."") (internal citations omitted)."
1111,27," See The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 1474, ""work"" defn. 2 (1976). "
1112,28," In addition to the above arguments, United Rentals argues that it would be legally prohibited from signing an agreement with 
Laborers. In addition to its preexisting relationship with CLA, discussed supra, it states that the signatory clause ""contemplates 
the execution of an 8(f) pre-hire agreement"" with the Laborers. Pls.' Am. Mem. at 32. Because an employer cannot enter into an 
8(f) agreement unless it is ""an employer . . . engaged primarily in the building and construction industry"" (id. at 33 (internal 
quotation omitted)), and United Rentals is not so engaged, it would be illegal for it to enter into such an agreement. Rather, it 
must enter into more lasting 9(a) bargaining relationships. United Rentals argues that subcontracting provisions affecting 
employers with 9(a) bargaining relationships, rather than 8(f) relationships, ""should presumptively be treated as beyond the 
protection of the Section 8(e) proviso."" Id. at 37. The Laborers dispute these assertions, and argue that there is no authority, either in caselaw or in the legislative history of 
section 8(e), to support such a construction of the proviso. Laborers' Reply/Response at 18. Also, they cite testimony within the 
House Labor Committee, discussed in Woelke, which contemplates such a situation as that in which United Rentals currently 
finds itself. The Court stated that ""[s]ignificantly, despite this testimony, Congress decided to exclude the construction industry 
from the scope of § 8(e)."" Id. at 19, citing Woelke, 456 U.S. at 658 n.10. Therefore, the Laborers argue that Congress 
consciously accepted the consequences of the application of union signatory subcontracting clauses in the construction industry, 
""including the possibility that particular employers . . . might find themselves unable to compete for work."" Laborers' 
Reply/Response at 19. We agree with the Laborers' analysis. The Woelke Court indeed concluded that ""Congress endorsed subcontracting agreements 
obtained in the context of a collective-bargaining relationship - and decided to accept whatever top-down pressure such clauses 
might entail."" 456 U.S. at 663. The legislative history of Section 8(e) contained in Woelke makes specific reference to situations 
in which ""other-union"" subcontractors could be harmed by the proviso. Id. at 658. Moreover, the Ninth Circuit has addressed the 
difficulties encountered by subcontractors like United Rentals who are signatory to other unions, and concluded that ""[d]espite 
[Congress's] awareness that [subcontracting] clauses could be used to exclude subcontractors represented by other unions, as 
well as non-union employers, it enacted the proviso. . . . We must give effect to Congress' intent[.] . . . Whether the section 8(e) 
proviso applies to union specific subcontracting clauses has been resolved by Woelke and we do not have the power to 
reexamine that question[.]"" Sun-Land Nurseries, Inc. v. Southern California Dist. Council of Laborers, 793 F.2d 1110, 1114 "

within Congress's contemplation, and will not read into Section 8(e) the novel interpretation preferred by United Rentals. "
1114,29," Count Two is brought pursuant to Indiana Code § 24-1-2-1, which states, in pertinent part: ""[e]very scheme, contract, or

Inc. v. Hope, 784 F.2d 91, 94-95 (2d Cir. 1986), the LGAA does not apply to claims for injunctive relief, nor does it modify the 
appropriate scope of analysis for purposes of the state-action doctrine. Notably in Hallie, which post-dated the passage of the 
LGAA, the Supreme Court distinguished Boulder as follows: ""[Boulder's enabling authority] simply did not address the regulation 
of cable television. Under Home Rule the municipality was to be free to decide every aspect of policy relating to cable television, 
as well as policy relating to any other field of regulation of local concern. Here, in contrast, the State has specifically authorized 
Wisconsin cities to provide sewage services and has delegated to the cities the express authority to take action that foreseeably

] A patent applicant has a duty to disclose to the PTO information it knows to be material to patentability. Purdue Pharma L.P., 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10, 2004 WL 26523, at *20. A breach of this duty can rise to the level of ""inequitable 
conduct,"" which renders the patent unenforceable. Id. To establish that a patent is unenforceable due to inequitable conduct, a 
party must show by clear and convincing evidence that the patent applicant failed to disclose material information with an intent 
to deceive the PTO. Id."
1142,2," Purdue appealed Judge Stein's inequitable conduct judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. See 
Purdue Pharma L.P. v. Endo Pharms., Inc., 410 F.3d 690 (Fed. Cir. 2005). The Federal Circuit initially affirmed Judge Stein's 
ruling, id. at 701, but subsequently granted a rehearing. See Purdue Pharma L.P. v. Endo Pharms., Inc., 438 F.3d 1123 (Fed. 
Cir. 2006). On petition for rehearing, the appellate court affirmed Judge Stein's finding that Purdue made material 
misrepresentations to the PTO, but vacated his finding that Purdue intended to deceive the PTO. Id. at 1131, 1134. 
Consequently, the Federal Circuit has remanded the case back to the district court with instructions to ""reconsider its intent 
finding,"" ""rethink the relevance of the evidence,"" and ""reweigh its materiality and intent findings to determine whether the 
sanction of unenforceability due to inequitable conduct is warranted."" Id. at 1135."
1142,3," As an alternative basis for federal jurisdiction, Purdue also asserted the doctrine of ""complete preemption"" under the 
Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq. This was rejected by the federal district 
court, and is not an issue in this appeal. "
1143,4," Judge Donald commented that the appeal of Judge Stein's ruling did not bar the preclusive effects of the judgment unless and 
until it was reversed. Purdue Pharma Co., 314 F. Supp. 2d at 783 (citing Huron Holding Corp. v. Lincoln Mine Operating 
Co., 312 U.S. 183, 189, 61 S. Ct. 513, 85 L. Ed. 725 (1941)). As noted above, the Federal Circuit has since vacated Judge 
Stein's finding of intent, and the case is now pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York."
1143,5," In addition to removing Coker's case to federal court, Purdue also filed a motion to transfer the proceedings to the Southern 
District of New York on March 4, 2004. At the time of the motion, Purdue reported that thirty other antitrust lawsuits had been 
filed against Purdue, which were similarly based on Judge Stein's January 2004 decision. Of these thirty cases, Purdue stated 
that nineteen had already been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, making it the most 
sensible forum. The motion to transfer was never heard, however, because Judge Donald remanded Coker's case back to the 
trial court for lack of federal jurisdiction. See Purdue Pharma Co., 314 F. Supp. 2d at 780 & n.3."
1143,6," We note that Judge Donald did not consider the separate question of whether federal patent law preempted the state law 
claims at issue; she addressed only the issue of whether Coker's complaint established federal question jurisdiction to support 
removal to the federal district court, which is governed by the ""well-pleaded complaint rule."" Coker v. Purdue Pharma Co., 314 
F. Supp. 2d 777, 781 (W.D. Tenn. 2004). HN2[
] The well-pleaded complaint rule ""provides that federal jurisdiction exists only 
when a federal question is presented on the face of the plaintiff's properly pleaded complaint,"" Caterpillar Inc. v. Williams, 482 
U.S. 386, 392, 107 S. Ct. 2425, 96 L. Ed. 2d 318 (1987), and the district court's review of the complaint proceeds without 
consideration of potential federal defenses, including the defense of federal preemption. See Franchise Tax Bd. v. Constr. 
Laborers Vacation Trust, 463 U.S. 1, 10, 103 S. Ct. 2841, 77 L. Ed. 2d 420 (1983); see also Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, 
481 U.S. 58, 63, 107 S. Ct. 1542, 95 L. Ed. 2d 55 (1987) (""Federal preemption is ordinarily a federal defense to the plaintiff's 
suit. As a defense, it does not appear on the face of a well pleaded complaint, and, therefore, does not authorize removal to 
federal court.""). Consequently, when Judge Donald remanded the case for lack of jurisdiction, the substantive defense of 
preemption remained for the state court to decide. "
1144,7," At oral argument, counsel for Coker conceded that the trial court's finding on the issue of ""sham litigation"" is not before this 
Court. Therefore, as reflected above, our review examines only the trial court's finding on the issue of Purdue's federal 
preemption defense. For purposes of this appeal, the ""sham litigation"" allegation is considered waived. "
1145,8," HN7[
] State law may be preempted in one of three ways: explicit preemption, field preemption, and conflict preemption. See 
generally English v. General Elec. Co., 496 U.S. 72, 78-79, 110 S. Ct. 2270, 110 L. Ed. 2d 65 (1990). Explicit preemption 
arises, of course, when the federal statute at issue explicitly provides for such preemption. In contrast, for both field and conflict 
preemption, congressional intent to preempt is implied. See Hunter Douglas, Inc. v. Harmonic Design, Inc., 153 F.3d 1318, 
1332 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Field preemption occurs when a state attempts to regulate conduct ""in a field that Congress intends the 
federal government to occupy exclusively."" Id. In an area in which federal law does not preclude the enforcement of state laws 
on the same subject, a state law may nevertheless be preempted ""to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law"" so that it 
is impossible to comply with both the state and federal laws, i.e. conflict preemption. Id. Conflict preemption may also be found 
where the state law in question ""stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives 
of Congress."" Id. (quoting Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 67, 61 S. Ct. 399, 85 L. Ed. 581 (1941)). It is undisputed that the 
only type of preemption at issue in this case is the latter type of conflict preemption. "
1146,9," HN13[
] The Federal Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction over appeals from the United States District Courts arising under the federal patent laws, see 28 U.S.C. § 1295(a)(1) (2000). The Federal Circuit recently held that its law, not the law of the regional 
circuit from which the case originated, governs the issue of whether federal patent law preempts certain state law causes of 
action. Midwest Indus., Inc. v. Karavan Trailers, Inc., 175 F.3d 1356, 1358-59 (Fed. Cir.1999). "
1153,1," In some context, courts have also applied a so-called ""quick look"" rule. This rule is of more recent vintage and has come into 
existence as the result of several cases in which the Supreme Court took a cursory glance at the economic circumstances of 
conduct that was putatively illegal per se before ruling that the defendants had violated the relevant antitrust laws. In the words 
of Justice White, [i]in each of these cases, which have formed the basis for what has come to be called abbreviated or 'quick 
look' analysis under the rule of reason, an observer with even a rudimentary understanding of economics could conclude that 
the arrangements in question would have an anticompetitive effect on customers and markets."" Federal Trade Comm'n v. 
Indiana Fed'n of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 459, 106 S. Ct. 2009, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445 (1984). Thus, in one price-fixing case, the Court 
ruled that a college football league could not require universities to charge minimum prices for broadcasting rights, even though 
the sports industry had been treated favorably in the context of other antitrust cases because of its peculiar characteristics. See 
Nat'l Collegiate Athletic Ass'n v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of Okla., 468 U.S. 85, 100-01, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70 (1984). "
1159,1," The Honorable Joan N. Ericksen, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota, adopting the reports and 
recommendations of the Honorable Jonathan Lebedoff, Chief United States Magistrate Judge for the District of Minnesota. "
1169,1," Nu-kote alleged in paragraph 92 that HP met with leading retailers to discourage them from carrying ink resupply products of 
companies like Nu-kote; in paragraph 93 alleged that HP published knowingly false statements and engaged in deceptive 
advertising concerning HP's own printer supply products, which included (a) false representations about the refillability of HP's 
cartridges and the quality, compatibility and/or safety of Nu-kote's products, and (b) marketing misinformation techniques 
designed to instill fear, uncertainty and doubt (""FUD"") in the minds of customers about competitive products; and in paragraph 
98, Nu-kote alleged that HP had published knowingly false statements in the marketplace accusing Nu-kote of infringing its 
trademarks and patents. "
1180,2," The motion revolved around whether the Nu-kote counterclaim revealed a potential, ""however slight,"" that ACE could be liable 
to indemnify HP for unfair competition within the policy territory. With respect to the ""policy territory"" issue, HP argued that the 
Nu-kote counterclaim alleged activities within the territorial limitations of the policy because HP distributed in foreign markets 
package inserts intimating that the HP cartridges are not refillable. ACE argued that any ""FUD"" allegedly suffered by consumers 
and distributors in foreign markets was irrelevant because there was no allegation or evidence that Nu-kote sold inkjet refill 
products outside of the United States during the policy period, and therefore, HP could not have suffered any damages to its 
international sales. The court disagreed with ACE, noting that the policy covered claims worldwide resulting from an occurrence within the policy 
territory. The court at page 10 of its decision concluded that: "
1181,," Nothing in the policy restricts covered Advertising Injury claims to those in which all damages must be suffered outside of 
the United States...The territorial limitation in the... policy emphasizes the location of the occurrence, not the location of the 
resulting damages. In the present case, HP disseminated allegedly false advertisements about refilling inkjet printer cartridges internationally. 
Nu-kote alleges that HP's statements concerning refillability of cartridges caused it to suffer damages. Because Nu-kote 
could possibly claim damages to domestic business based, at least in part, on HP's extraterritorial acts, the Court finds that 
the Policy Territory requirement is satisfied. With respect to unfair competition, the issue was whether the Nu-kote counterclaim alleged ""unfair competition"" as that term is 
used in the policy. The court found that because ""unfair competition"" is commonly understood to encompass claims for false 
advertising and other tortious conduct resulting in competitive injury, ""unfair competition"" as presented in the ACE policy 
encompassed the claim for unfair competition alleged in the Nu-kote counterclaim. See Lowe Decl., Ex. 102. "

1182,4," Jack Brigham, HP's then general counsel testified that Mr. Katz' involvement in the case significantly increased HP's efforts to 
mount a defense to Nu-kote's counterclaim. (HT 1778:4-22.) That development caused HP to pursue its intellectual property 
claims because HP decided that ""the best defense would be an offense"" and that HP would be able to successfully defend 
against Nu-kote's counterclaim if it could substantiate its position with respect to its intellectual property rights. (HT 1778:23- "
1183,1779," :14.) Mr. Brigham also testified that HP's affirmative intellectual property claims had independent value separate and apart 
from the defensive nature of the claims asserted by HP's counsel. (RT. 400:18-401:9.) "
1190,5," ""By definition, [the duty to indemnify] entails the payment of money which is expressly limited in amount, in order to resolve 
liability."" Aerojet at 56 (citation omitted). ""It is not narrowly confined to money that the insured must give under law as 
compensation to third parties, but may also include money that the insured must itself expend in equity in order to provide relief 
of the same sort."" Id. ""It runs to claims that are actually covered, in light of the facts proved."" Id. ""It arises only after liability is 
established and as a result thereof."" Id. ""It is triggered if specified harm is caused by an included occurrence, so long as at least 
some such harm results within the policy period."" Id. ""It extends to all specified harm caused by an included occurrence, even if 
some such harm results beyond the policy period."" Id. at 56-57. "
1200,6," ACE asserts that an insured's contractual duties of good faith and fair dealing owed to its insurer, and the standard for 
imposing liability on the insurer, must take that relationship and those duties into account. "
1205,7," While the Special Master would have denied HP's motion to strike Mr. Ocampo's testimony ""that was not fully disclosed in his 
expert report,"" in light of the above ruling, the motion is MOOT. "
1211,8," HP's 1996 argument is remarkably similar to the theory asserted by ACE's expert, discussed below, regarding the defensive 
nature of HP's affirmative claims. "
1214,9," Professor Menell, however, did not testify with respect to whether litigation activities would be conducted against liability by a 
reasonable insured under the same circumstances. His analysis was instead limited to overlapping elements of the parties' 
claims, and did not address what a reasonable insured might do under the circumstances."
1214,10," Professor Menell did testified that proving Nu-kote infringed HP's patents directly refuted Nu-kote's counterclaim seeking a 
declaration that it did not infringe. (RT. 353:13 - 355:11.) "
1231,11," After his initial review of each billing entry, and during each subsequent review as necessary, Mr. Aronson made notations on 
a copy of the original billing entries. (RT. 480:21-481:5; Exhibit 4218 (notebooks containing the notations).) These notations 
reflected his initial thoughts concerning the amount, if any, of each billing entry that Mr. Aronson concluded should be allocated 
to ""prosecution"" expenses, and thus were expenses that were not conducted against liability by a reasonable insured under the 
same circumstances. After reviewing the billing entries again to confirm or change his prior notations, the final notations were 
then transferred by a paralegal under Mr. Aronson's supervision to an Excel spreadsheet. (RT. 498:12-499:2.) The Excel spreadsheets prepared under Mr. Aronson's supervision contained every billing entry reflected on the bills for which 
HP is seeking reimbursement along with Mr. Aronson's determination of the amount of each billing entry that should be allocated 
to ""prosecution"" expenses. (Id.; Exhibit 4217A (files entitled P&E Post May 7, 1999 Fees, P&E Pre May 7, 1999 Fees, GD&C

amounts that should be allocated to settlement activities as well as those entries that were too vague to directly allocate. In addition to listing each billing entry and Mr. Aronson's allocations, the Excel spreadsheets contained on Exhibit 4217A also 
totaled the amounts that Mr. Aronson allocated to ""prosecution"" expenses. These amounts were first subtotaled by month. Then, 
the subtotal for each month was added together to arrive at the total amount that was allocated to ""prosecution"" expenses, and 
thus were not conducted against liability by a reasonable insured under the same circumstances. When the totals from each of "
1232,," the spreadsheets in Exhibit 4217A are added together, they equal the amounts that Mr. Aronson concluded should be allocated 
to ""prosecution"" expenses and that are expenses not conducted against liability by a reasonable insured under the same 
circumstances. "

(affirming in part and reversing in part an order of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County, Richard J. Sankovitz, Judge)."
1241,2, All references to the Wisconsin Statutes are to the 2003-04 version unless otherwise noted. 
1242,3, The record reflects that the parties have resolved the dispute regarding Haertel's consulting salary. 
1243,4," The court of appeals affirmed the dismissals of claims four (breach of implied fiduciary duty against Juneau), five (conversion 
against Wispark), and eight (conspiracy to convert against Wispark and Juneau) without modification. Brew City has not sought 
review of the court of appeals' decision to affirm those dismissals. The court of appeals vacated the trial court's dismissal of the 
ninth claim, for punitive damages, ""the fate of which will be determined on remand in connection with the trial of [claims three, 
six, and seven]."" Brew City, 2006 WI App 39, 289 Wis. 2d 795, P22, 714 N.W.2d 582. That part of the court of appeals decision 
is not under review. "
1244,5," HN7[
] In contrast to criminal law, where the ""gist"" of conspiracy is the agreement, the ""gist"" of a civil conspiracy action is the 
damages. ""It is the established law of this state that there is no such thing as a civil action for conspiracy. There is an action for 
damages caused by acts pursuant to a conspiracy but none for the conspiracy alone. In a civil action for damages for an 
executed conspiracy, the gist of the action is the damages."" Singer v. Singer, 245 Wis. 191, 195, 14 N.W.2d 43 (1944); 
Onderdonk v. Lamb, 79 Wis. 2d 241, 246, 255 N.W.2d 507 (1977); Radue v. Dill, 74 Wis. 2d 239, 244, 246 N.W.2d 507 (1976). 
Thus, while parties may incur criminal liability by conspiring to maliciously or willfully injure another's business reputation in 
violation of Wis. Stat. § 134.01, those parties will not be subject to civil liability absent damages."
1244,6," As previously noted, the court of appeals did not reverse the dismissal of Brew City's § 134.01 claims against Highland Best 
and JTMK-Pabst for acts done as members or managers of Juneau. Brew City, 2006 WI App 39, 289 Wis. 2d 795, P19, 714 
N.W.2d 582. "
1245,7," In Maleki v. Fine-Lando Clinic Chartered, S.C., 162 Wis. 2d 73, 469 N.W.2d 629 (1991), this court determined that HN8[
] under § 134.01 ""malice"" demands more than an intent to do harm. Rather, it requires an intent to do ""wrongful"" harm. Such harm 
does not include incidental harms that derive from a person's seeking competitive advantage. It requires inflicting a harm ""for the 
sake of harm as an end in itself, and not merely as a means to some further end legitimately desired [such as hurting someone 
else's business by competition]."" Id. at 87-88 (brackets in Maleki, quoting Aikens v. Wisconsin, 195 U.S. 194, 203, 25 S. Ct. 3, 
49 L. Ed. 154 (1904)). "
1246,8," With regard to damages, Brew City's complaint alleges that ""[a]s a result of defendants' malicious and intentional injury to Brew 
City's reputation and business, Brew City has sustained financial and other injuries, including those injuries set forth above in 
paragraph 90."" Paragraph 90 states that Wispark's breach of contract caused damages to Brew City, including loss of time, 
money, business, profits, and ""damage to Brew City's business and reputation."" "
1247,9," As noted by the court of appeals, the claim for conspiracy to intentionally interfere with contract (claim seven) is essentially a 
""recasting"" of claim three. Brew City, 2006 WI App 39, 289 Wis. 2d 795, P20, 714 N.W.2d 582. HN12[
] The elements of a claim for intentional interference with a contract are ""(1) the plaintiff had a contract or 
prospective contractual relationship with a third party; (2) the defendant interfered with the relationship; (3) the interference 
was intentional; (4) a causal connection exists between the interference and the damages; and (5) the defendant was not 
justified or privileged to interfere."" Aon Risk Servs., Inc. v. Liebenstein, 2006 WI App 4, P20, 289 Wis. 2d 127, 710 N.W.2d 
175."
1247,10," Franke is the president of Wispark, and Wispark is party to the June 5, 2002, assignment contract. To the extent that Franke's 
actions are performed as a member or manager of Wispark, he will be not be liable individually for interference with that contract 
under § 183.0304."
1247,11," In addition, HN16[
] under Wis. Stat. § 183.0402, certain types of conduct are beyond the scope of the duties of managers and members of an LLC. HN17[
] Section 183.0402 provides in relevant part: Duties of managers and members. Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement: (1) No member or manager shall act or fail to act in a manner that constitutes any of the following: . . . . "
1248,," (b) A violation of criminal law, unless the member or manager had reasonable cause to believe that the person's conduct 
was lawful or no reasonable cause to believe that the conduct was unlawful. (c) A transaction from which the member or manager derived an improper personal profit. (d) Willful misconduct."
1248,12," The court of appeals also determined that because Brew City's complaint alleges that JTMK-Pabst is a member of Juneau, yet 
alleges no conduct by JTMK-Pabst other than as a member of Juneau, it was not a proper party to Brew City's tortious 
interference claims (claims three and seven). It affirmed the circuit court's dismissals, though modified them to be without 
prejudice if facts were to develop showing that it acted other than as a member of Juneau. Neither Ferchill Group nor Brew City 
seeks review of this aspect of the court of appeals' decision. "
1249,13," The conspiracy causes of action are claim six (conspiracy to maliciously injure reputation and business under Wis. Stat. § 
134.01) and claim seven (conspiracy to intentionally interfere with contract). As noted above, the court of appeals reversed the 
dismissal of Brew City's § 134.01 claim with respect to all defendants ""except insofar as it asserts claims against Highland Best 
and JTMK-Pabst for acts done as members or managers of Juneau."" Brew City, 2006 WI App 39, 289 Wis. 2d 795, P19, 714 
N.W.2d 582. The court of appeals allowed repleading of claim seven with respect to Franke and Ferchill. Because the complaint 
alleges that JTMK-Pabst is a member of Juneau, the court of appeals allowed repleading of claim seven with respect to JTMK-
Pabst only ""if facts develop that show any conduct by it other than as a member of Juneau."" Id., P13."
1249,14," Ferchill Group also cites to Fraser v. Major League Soccer, LLC, 97 F. Supp. 2d 130 (D. Mass. 2000) for the proposition that 
""there is little reason to treat an LLC . . . differently from a corporation."" Id. at 135. However, Fraser is inapt. In the appeal to that 
case the First Circuit declined to extend Copperweld to preclude liability for the LLC. Fraser v. Major League Soccer, LLC, 284 "
1250,," F.3d 47, 59 (1st Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 885, 123 S. Ct. 118, 154 L. Ed. 2d 144. Rather, it determined that Major 
League Soccer, LLC, should not be treated as a single entity based on the ""diversity of entrepreneurial interests"" of its members 
and the fact that its members ""are not mere servants of MLS; effectively, they control it . . . ."" Id. at 57. "
1252,1," The background facts are a condensed version of those found in the Court's Memorandum Opinion and Order filed August 7, 
2006 (Doc. 44). Also included are facts necessary for the determination of this motion."
1252,2, Other defendants were initially named but have subsequently been dismissed. 
1253,3," The Court has discovered that this is more commonly spelled ""gouging"" but is sometimes spelled ""gauging."" "
1254,4," Both Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act are criminal statutes making felonious any conduct that violates the Act. However, 
the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15, provides a private right of action to enforce the Sherman Act. Thus, a civil complaint alleging 
violations of the Sherman Act is brought pursuant to the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act. "
1258,1," Not all of the named Defendants have agreed to settle the case. According to the brief of the Appellee Settling Plaintiffs and 
Settling Defendants, the settlements at issue here ""preserve all claims against the two Non-Settling Defendants - including, by "
1259,," far, the largest seller of HPL during the period of the alleged conspiracy - which remain jointly and severally liable for all 
damages, including those arising from indirect sales of HPL and sales of HPL-containing products made with HPL originally sold 
by the Settling Defendants."" "
1260,2," See, e.g., Boyle v. Giral, 820 A.2d 561 (D.C. 2003). "
1264,1," Defendants in this action are Valero Refining Company-California; Valero Marketing and Supply Company; and Does 1 through 
20. Except where necessary, they will be referred to collectively as ""Valero"" or ""Defendants."""
1264,2," The version of the Credit Card Sales Guide discussed herein is dated June 1, 2003. See Phelps Decl. Ex. N. As will be 
discussed, there is some dispute with regard to when revisions were made to the Guide, and when PSI was notified of such 
revisions. "
1267,3, The facts section above does not include evidence as to which this Court has sustained Defendants' objection. 
1274,4," Plaintiff asserts that it has no record of receiving Valero's August 15 letter, and that ""Defendants first provided a copy of the 
Sept 03 Card Guide revision to PSI by fax to its attorney on November 18, 2003."" Opposition at 9. However, as noted, Shimek 
admitted in his deposition that although he personally never read the August 15 letter, the document was marked with a PSI 
production number, indicating that it came from PSI's files. Further, when asked whether he had any reason to doubt that the 
letter was received by Woodlands Valero (one of PSI's stations), Shimek answered in the negative. See Phelps Decl. Ex. J 
(Shimek depo. at 164). Thus, there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Plaintiff received notice of changes to the 
Card Guide. The Court rejects Plaintiff's argument that PSI was not bound by changes in the Card Guide because it did not 
receive proper notice of them."
1274,5," Plaintiff points to Section 10.3.2 of the Supply Agreement, which requires Valero to give notice to the dealer of changes to 
Attachment 1. However, because it does not otherwise specify the method of notice, section 10.3.2 is arguably subject to section 
23.1, which states that, ""[e]xcept where specifically required otherwise in this SUPPLY AGREEMENT, the following must occur 
to meet the requirement for due notice: (A) The party giving notice must post to the other party a properly addressed written 
message by certified mail, with return receipt requested, and with adequate postage; (B) The party giving notice must send to 
the other party a properly addressed written message by a nationally recognized overnight carrier; or (c) The party giving notice 
must have a written message personally delivered to the address of the other party."" Phelps Decl. Ex. 6 at PSI0000057. An 
identical provision is included in the Equipment Agreement. Id. at PSI0000084. There is no evidence that Valero did deliver the 
August 15 letter by certified mail, overnight carrier, or in person. However, as noted above, Section 5.2 of the Equipment 
Agreement does not require any notice of changes to the card guide, and thus Section 23.1 does not apply to it. "
1276,6," Indeed, Plaintiff asserts that Defendants' dealer agreements were less fair than other dealer contracts in the Bay Area: ""In 
2001, most supply agreements between major refiners and dealers who owned their stations lasted no more than 10 years and 
contained provisions that allowed either party to terminate the agreements at will on 30 to 80 day written notice."" Opposition at 
17. Thus, Plaintiff was clearly aware that there were reasonable or preferable market alternatives, further weakening the 
procedural unconscionability argument. "
1277,7," Further, it is worth taking a step back and noting that PSI's aim in this lawsuit is to enforce the contract: they assert that Valero 
breached by failing to pay Facilities Allowances, and seek damages for that breach. Valero's defense is that its behavior was 
justified by PSI's own breach of contract, which is why PSI is making the unconscionability argument in the first place. If this 
Court were to find that the agreements are unconscionable and unenforceable, presumably PSI's breach of contract claim would 
fail, and summary judgment on that claim would be appropriate. "
1279,8," Defendants admit that there are no cases applying the ""functional availability"" concept to California Business and Professions 
Code section 21200, but point out that ""there are, however, also no cases rejecting the defense. The economic and logical 
underpinnings ofthe Robinson Patman functional availability defense are equally applicable"" to the section 21200 claim. ""[I]f the 
lower price is rejected by the purchaser then analytically, there has been no price discrimination by the seller."" Motion at 21-22. 
The Court agrees. "
1292,1," Intel Kabushiki Kaisha is also a named defendant in the AMD case, Case No. 05-441, and AMD refers to both Intel entities,

1292,3," The California Class Litigation includes actions filed by or on behalf of a putative California class of indirect purchasers of Intel

1292,4," The Order appointing Special Master is docketed at D.I. 106 in Case No. 05-441, at D.I. 60 in the 05-1717 MDL docket, and at 
D.I. 21 in Case No. 05-485."
1292,5," Unless otherwise specified, the docket items cited hereinafter refer only to the docket in Case No. 05-441. "
1293,6," On November 3, 2006, Intel filed a motion to dismiss similar foreign conduct claims asserted by the Class Plaintiffs' Complaint. 
D.I. 311-12 in the 05-1717 MDL docket. That motion is currently pending decision by the Court."
1293,7," The issues that Intel framed for the Court — and the limitations of those issues — are discussed in greater detail infra at pp. 
12-14. "
1294,8," As discussed infra at pp. 11-14, the Special Master treats this argument as a threshold matter. "
1295,9," As discussed infra at p. 8, the Special Master has advised the parties that such substantive law claims are not properly before 
the Special Master. "
1298,10," AMD's Complaint alleges exclusionary conduct on the part of Intel throughout the Complaint, including at paragraphs 2 and 
129. Further, AMD's Complaint at paragraphs 63 and 67 references the ""market-foreclosing"" effects of Intel's alleged discount 
program and rebate schemes, respectively. The categories of Foreign Conduct Discovery Materials essentially mirror the 
categories of alleged exclusionary conduct set forth in paragraph 2 of AMD's Complaint. "
1299,11," Nowhere in its opposition to AMD's motion to compel [*54]  does Intel challenge AMD's assertion that Intel concedes the 
relevant market ""is a single, worldwide market for x86 microprocessors."" See D.I. 236 at p. 2; D.I. 243 generally."
1299,12," ""Courts have increasingly leaned toward using circumstantial evidence as a short cut to determine whether monopoly power 
exists."" Conwood Co.. L.P., 290 F.3d at 783, fn2 (citation omitted)."
1299,13," As an alternative to Intel producing the Foreign Conduct Discovery Materials, AMD proposed that Intel stipulate or admit to 
certain of the elements of proof regarding the claims. D.I. 236 at pp. 14 (monopoly power), 15 (anticompetitive means), and 17 
(exclusionary conduct). Not surprisingly, Intel has not agreed to do so. "
1301,14," AMD acknowledges this burden of proof. See D.I. 236 at p. 12; D.I. 274 26:22-27:5 (""[I]t is not every exclusion that establishes 
violation of Section 2, it is only when the exclusion aggregated throughout the available market to the participants and rivals in 
the market has some material outcome, some material preclusion that maintains the monopoly for the monopolist and excludes 
competition ...."")"
1301,15, See D.I. 1 at ¶ 28. 
1302,16," While the Special Master acknowledges that the use of legislative history is reserved for instances where [*62]  the language 
of the statute is unclear, the Special Master views the legislative history as instructive, especially as the FTAIA itself is silent with 
respect to discovery. The Special Master notes that the legislative history cited herein is consistent with the statutory 
construction rule of in pari materia — i.e., a new statute should be read as part of the existing legislature and should expressly 
indicate any intended divergence. "
1306,1," As noted in the Court's previous decision, Plaintiff has submitted a newspaper article and a statement by the Federal Trade 
Commission (the ""FTC"") discussing a settlement between the FTC and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development with FCC and its parent company, PMI Group Inc., involving the identical claims asserted by Plaintiff in this action. "
1320,1," Under the terms of Doman's bankruptcy proceeding, ""no suit, action, enforcement process, extra-judicial proceeding or 
proceeding of any other nature . . . shall be proceeded with or commenced against [Doman]."" Following its reorganization, 
Doman emerged from bankruptcy in July 2004. "
1321,2," We indulge in this assumption despite seeming anomalies in some factual allegations. For example, the complaint alleges that 
a 10 increase in transportation costs when rail is used renders green hem-fir lumber from another producer ""uncompetitive for 
resale"" because of the elasticity of demand for the product while also alleging that Sherwood has raised prices by over 20 and 
that alternative kinds of suitable lumber sell for 25 more than green hem-fir. Moreover, the complaint alleges that Doman has 
sold green hem-fir lumber at a discount to Sherwood to allow the latter to sell green hem-fir lumber at lower prices than E&L and 
to tie the sale of that product to Sherwood's sale of finished wood products, conduct that hardly benefits Doman."
1321,3," One basis on which the district court dismissed the complaint was its conclusion that plaintiffs had not alleged ""antitrust injury,"" 
E&L Consulting, Ltd., 360 F. Supp. 2d at 474, because they had failed to ""allege some type of harm to competition market-wide,"" 
id. at 475. We agree with the district court that the plaintiffs' failure to proffer allegations of harm to competition is fatal to their 
antitrust claims. However, the failure to allege harm to competition is analytically distinct from failure to plead antitrust injury. 
Blue Tree Hotels Inv., Ltd. v. Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc., 369 F.3d 212, 220 (2d Cir. 2004) (HN2[
] ""Antitrust 
injury and competitive injury are conceptually distinct.""). Antitrust injury is ""injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants' 
acts unlawful."" Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 489, 97 S. Ct. 690, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977). An 
antitrust plaintiff ""must show not only injury-in-fact, but also that [the injury] constitutes . . . the kind that the antitrust laws are 
designed to prevent and that [is] congruent with the rationale for finding an antitrust violation in the first place."" Areeda, 
Hovenkamp & Blair, Antitrust Law § 335c4 (2000). It should go without saying, therefore, that a party cannot establish antitrust 
injury without establishing a violation of the antitrust laws, which, under Section 1, must involve an injury to competition. "

1339,1," ""Overbuilder"" is the term given for cable companies engaged in the business of constructing cable infrastructure for the 
purpose of competing directly against other cable providers in the same franchise zone. "
1344,2," Footnote 7 of the Decision states: Comcast emphasizes that the conduct Plaintiffs challenge under § 1 of the Sherman Act includes Comcast's acquisitions. 
Count [I] only alleges that Comcast's swap agreements with horizontal competitors constitute per se violations of § 1. 
(Complaint P 73.) Count [I] separately alleges that Comcast's acquisitions of competing cable companies and their cable 
subscribers in the Philadelphia and Chicago clusters constitute contracts and conduct in restraint of trade in violation of § 1 
under the applicable rule of reason analysis. (Id. P 74.) Thus, Comcast's assertions that acquisitions hold the promise of 
increasing a firm's efficiency, Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 768, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. 
Ed. 2d 628 (1984), and, thus, are not manifestly anticompetitive business practices are irrelevant to the assessment of 
whether Count [I] has alleged per se violation of § 1. (Decision at 17 n.7.) "
1345,3," In Count II, which alleges monopolization by Comcast, the Complaint states: ""The relevant geographic markets are Comcast's 
Philadelphia cluster, as defined in paragraph 31.a.(2) and Comcast's Chicago cluster, as defined in paragraph 31.a.(3)"" 
(Complaint P 78.), and ""The relevant product market is defined as multichannel video programming services, which are 
distributed by multichannel video programming distributors (""MVPDs""), including cable television operators, such as Defendants, 
overbuilders and direct broadcast satellite operators."" (Id. P 79.) "
1347,4," As we have reconsidered the portion of the Decision in which we did not apply the rule of reason analysis to the merger and 
asset acquisition transactions, question 2(b) is now moot. "
1350,1," Highland Springs, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of MVH is also a named plaintiff. I refer to both plaintiffs collectively as 
""MVH."""
1350,2," MVH has sued the Town of Peterborough, its Board of Selectmen (""BOS""), its Zoning Board of Adjustment (""ZBA""), and its 
Planning Board."
1350,3," Defendant Barking Dog Water, LLC. (""Barking Dog"") which formed in May, 2003, is a New Hampshire corporation and a 
competitor of MVH. (Complaint 2, 9). In its complaint, MVH alleges that some of the Municipal Defendants have close ties with 
Barking Dog. Specifically, MVH notes that: (1) Defendant Roberta Bass serves as the Managing Member of Barking Dog and is 
also a member of the Planning Board (Complaint 2); (2) Defendant John Ratigan, Esq. is Peterborough Town Counsel and the 
registered agent and counsel for Barking Dog (Complaint 2); and (3) Defendant Elizabeth Thomas Marshall is a member of the 
Peterborough Board of Selectmen and the Peterborough Water Resources Committee, and she maintains a close relationship 
with Roberta Bass."
1350,4," MVH also asserts several state law claims: (1) tortious interference with business relationships; (2) ""abuse of office;"" (3) 
""violation of R.S.A. 91-A;"" and (4) ""bad faith conduct by government officials."" Because I dismiss MVH's federal claims, I decline 
to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over these state law claims and do not consider them here."
1350,5," The facts in the background section are drawn primarily from the complaint and, for purposes of these motions, will be 
construed in the light most favorable to MVH. References to relevant ZBA Minutes and other court actions brought by MVH or its 
predecessors are included solely for contextual purposes."
1350,6," Although the Zoning Ordinance did not permit commercial uses in either the rural district or the family district, the town 
determined that the owner of the Stone Barn Property had a common law right to make the approved withdrawals. Id. This ruling 
was unsuccessfully challenged by abutters in Superior Court. Id. "
1351,7," The actual applicant was Peterborough Spring Water, Inc., MVH's predecessor in interest to its contract to purchase the Route 
101 property. Monadnock Holdings, LLC v. Town of Peterborough, et al, Hillsborough County Superior Court, North, Docket No. 
03-E-264 at 3 (Nov. 3, 2003). "
1352,8," The complaint states that MVH ""put forward"" two ballot initiatives ""including the development of an Inn/Restaurant at Stone 
Barn and the Bulk Transfer Water Station."" (Complaint 11). I interpret this statement to mean that MVH sought to have the Stone 
Barn and Route 101 properties re-zoned at a town meeting."
1352,9," MVH alleges that over the next several years the town actively attempted to purchase the Stone Barn property with the 
intention of using water revenues from its springs to restore and maintain the Stone Barn structure. Specifically, MVH asserts 
that the town took affirmative steps such as placing a phone call to MVH's attorney regarding a possible purchase of the property 
and empowering a selectman to purchase the property at foreclosure proceedings. (Complaint 11, 15). "
1354,10," The only arguable difference between the issues is a technical one: the Superior Court decided the equal protection issue on 
state -- rather than federal -- constitutional grounds. The element under the state equal protection standard, however, is identical 
to that under the federal standard. See In re Wintle, 146 N.H. 664, 667, 781 A.2d 995 (2001)(""The first question in an equal 
protection analysis is whether the State action in question treats similarly situated persons differently."")(citation omitted). "
1355,11," MVH also seems to claim that Peterborough's taxation of the Stone Barn Property as a commercial property gives rise to an 
equal protection claim because the Town has prevented it from using the property for commercial purposes. However, MVH 
admits in the complaint that it is permitted to transport two truckloads of water per day from the property -- an inherently 
commercial use."
1355,12," MVH also asserts that the Municipal Defendants' conduct violated its substantive due process rights. I view this, however, as 
merely an effort to recharacterize as substantive a claim that is inherently procedural. ""[R]ejections of development projects and 
refusals to issue building permits do not ordinarily implicate substantive due process."" SFW Arecibo, Ltd. v. Rodriguez, 415 F.3d 
135, 141 (1st Cir. 2005)(quoting PFZ Properties, Inc. v. Rodriguez, 928 F.2d 28, 31 (1st Cir. 1991)). This is true even where 
""officials have allegedly violated state law or administrative procedures. Id. To be sure, the First Circuit has ""left the door slightly 
ajar for federal relief [based on substantive due process] in truly horrendous situations,"" but it has been clear that ""the threshold 
for establishing the requisite abuse of government power is a high one indeed."" SFW Arecibo, Ltd., 415 F.3d at 141 (citation and 
internal quotation marks omitted). Here, MVH has not pleaded facts sufficient to satisfy this threshold. See SFW Arecibo, Ltd., 
415 F.3d at 141 (affirming dismissal of substantive due process claim where plaintiffs alleged that a planning board made an 
erroneous decision in violation of state law); PFZ Properties, Inc., 928 F.2d at 32 (affirming dismissal of substantive due process 
claim where plaintiff alleged that a permitting authority arbitrarily and capriciously refused to process its approved construction 
drawings). MVH does not come close to meeting this difficult standard. "
1356,13," Additionally, MVH notes in its complaint that in February 2002, the ZBA denied a request to create a circular turnaround on the 
Stone Barn Property. (Complaint 4). To the extent that MVH's complaint can be construed to assert a due process claim on this 
ground, the same post-deprivation remedies described with respect to its other variance requests were available. "
1357,14," Although the Municipal Defendants do not raise it as a defense, the Local Government Antitrust Act of 1984 (""LGAA"") also 
immunizes them from MVH's damages claims. 15 U.S.C. §§ 34-36; GF Gaming Corp. v. City of Black Hawk, 405 F.3d 876, 884-
85 (10th Cir. 2005). The LGAA bars recovery of damages, interest on damages, costs, or attorney's fees from any ""local 
government, or official or employee thereof acting in an official capacity."" 15 U.S.C. § 35(a); GF Gaming Corp., 405 F.3d at 885. 
Here, the Municipal Defendants are local government officials who were acting in their official capacities. Thus, they are 
""immune from damages for violations of the Sherman Act."" See GF Gaming Corp., 405 F.3d at 885. "
1358,15," In addition to naming the Town its various boards in its antitrust claim, MVH has named Marshall and Ratigan individually. 
However, a plaintiff cannot defeat state action immunity ""simply by substituting, for the name of the town, the names of the town 
officials who approved the challenged municipal action."" Fisichelli, 956 F.2d at 15-16. Thus, MVH's antitrust claims against 
Marshall and Ratigan fail."
1358,16," To the extent that MVH's complaint can be read to advocate an additional exception to the Noerr-Pennington doctrine based 
on an illicit conspiracy between Barking Dog and the Municipal Defendants, its claim still fails. The Supreme Court has explicitly 
refused to recognize a ""conspiracy"" exception to the Noerr-Pennington doctrine that would apply where, as MVH alleges here, 
private parties conspire with government entities for the purpose of stifling competition. City of Columbia, 499 U.S at 382-83. "
1369,1," The Court will also reserve judgment on Plaintiffs' Joint Motion for Attorneys' Fees and Costs [dkt. 884], Plaintiffs' Motions 
related to treble damages [dkt. 887 & 891], and Defendants' Motion to Dismiss [dkts 910 & 911]."
1369,2," For a detailed account of this case's extensive procedural history please see the following opinions in this case: 351 U.S. App. 
D.C. 223, 289 F.3d 98 (D.C. Cir. 2002); March 30, 2005 Mem. Op. (""S.J. Mem. Op."") [dkt. 785]; 295 F. Supp. 2d 30 (D.D.C. 
2003); 202 F.R.D. 12 (D.D.C. 2001)."
1369,3," The claims were brought under the antitrust laws of the following states: Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Illinois."
1369,4," Lorazepam and Clorazepate are generic prescription anti-anxiety drugs (the generic equivalents of Ativan(R) and Tranxene(R), 
respectively). "
1371,5," HN4[
] Illinois, Massachusetts, and Minnesota all look to federal antitrust law for guidance in interpreting their own state antitrust laws. 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. § 10/11 (2004); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A § 2(b); Ciardi v. F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Ltd.,

(Minn. Ct. App. 2001). "
1376,6," These included: (i) panelist's association with business journal and husband's experience as an antitrust attorney; (ii) panelist 
was a lobbyist for American Steel and could be too probusiness; (iii) panelist works for Department of Commerce and had 
concerns about his economic impact statement; (iv) panelist who showed some bias against insurance companies and had 
some economic experience and knowledge; (v) panelist had friend working at Defendants' law firm and felt he might favor 
business; and (vi) panelist was policy analyst for GAO and made comments indicating she might be pro-Defendants in this case. "
1380,1," Under federal antitrust law, direct, but not indirect, purchasers have standing. Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 97 
S.Ct. 2061, 52 L.Ed.2d 707 (1977). If injured at the direct level, but not a purchaser, a federal Plaintiff only has standing by 
satisfying the factors set forth in Associated General Contractors of California, Inc. v. California State Counsel of Carpenters, 
459 U.S. 519, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L.Ed.2d 723 (1983) (AGC). Under state antitrust law, indirect purchasers have standing in 
more than a dozen states, including Kansas. See California v. ARC America Corp., 490 U.S. 93, 105-06, 109 S. Ct. 1661, 104 
L.Ed.2d 86 (1989). If injured at the direct level, but not a purchaser, a state Plaintiff may have standing by satisfying modified 
state factors similar to AGC, but that issue is not before this Court as Plaintiff class members by definition are all indirect 
""purchasers"" of choline chloride."
1380,2," When determining if there is a genuine issue of material fact, the Court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the 
non-moving party. Stanfield v. Osborne Industries, Inc., 263 Kan. 388, 395, 949 P.2d 602 (1997). But a nonmoving party cannot 
""rest merely on allegations, but must set forth specific facts to support its position. Lloyd v. Quorum Health Resources, L.L.C., 31 
Kan.App.2d 943, 951 77 P.3d 993 (2003). "
1382,3," See also Dodge v. Cotter Corp., 203 F.3d 1190, 1198 (10th Cir. 2000) (""In light of the Supreme Court's holding in Parklane 
Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 'if the components of collateral estoppel are satisfied, its benefits of economizing judicial resources and 
lessening the burdens of relitigating identical issues already decided would be afforded a non-mutual plaintiff provided defendant 
had previously had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue.'"")"
1382,4," The Defendants and their co-conspirators controlled 90% of the choline chloride market and conspired to fix and maintain 
prices for the sale of choline chloride in the United States, including Kansas, from before January 1, 1988 through at least 1998. 
See Exhibit D attached to Plaintiff's MSJ at p.3, n. 7. "
1383,5," See, [*14]  e.g., In re Rubber Chem Antitrust Litig, 232 F.R.D. 346, 353 (N.D. Cal. 2005) (upholding correlation analysis); In re 
Citric Acid Antitrust Litig., 1996 WL 655791 at *7 (N.D. 1996) (upholding before/after approach); In re Linerboard Antitrust Litig., 
203 F.R.D. 197, 220 (E.D. Pa. 2001) (upholding ""yardstick"" approach"")."
1383,6," The end user Class in this case does not include middlemen in the distribution chain which may not have any damages 
whatsoever because the middlemen pass-on the overcharge. Compare, In re Methionine Antitrust Litigation, 204 F.R.D. 161, 
165 (N.D.Cal.2001) (denying class certification for Wisconsin resellers and end users, but later certifying the class of just end 
users) with Premier Pork, Inc. v. Rhone Poulenc, S.A., et al., Case No. 00-C-3, Scott County District Court, Kansas (Honorable 
Thomas Richardson presiding, certifying class of methionine end users, May 1, 2004)."
1383,7," While it is theoretically possible that a middleman in distribution chain might sell a product below his actual cost (without any 
profit margin or capture of his own overhead) for a short period of time, it is almost unimaginable that it would happen over the 
economic long run (here a decade) or that it would affect a substantial number of the end users in a class for a substantial 
number of years so as to make a class action without value or to undercut the impact estimate to the point that it had no validity. 
In any event, there was no evidence that such was likely in this case."
1383,8," Notably, if the chain of distribution is not competitive, the overcharge could be even higher since an oligopolist or monopolist 
middleman could increase profits as a result of the overcharge. Id. at p. 5 n. 13. "
1384,9," While direct purchaser prices fluctuated throughout the conspiracy period and prices throughout a distribution chain vary over 
time, this does not effect the pass-on because the illegal ""rising tide"" of the overcharge raises ""all boats"", here the cost (whether 
the cost is based on a list price, negotiated price, long term or spot price) throughout the distribution chain all the way to the end 
user. Id. at p. 3-4. ""Whatever economic factors caused a particular buyer to get a higher or lower price [during the price fix] 
would be equally relevant absent the price fix."" Id. at p. 4."
1384,10," In addition to being the clear mandate of the Kansas law, full consideration damages play a critical role in antitrust 
enforcement in Kansas. Virtually all antitrust cases brought to date are the result of an international conspiracy of multinational 
companies, and certainly companies outside Kansas. These circumstances bring a variety of legal issues that are vigorously 
litigated and expensive to pursue. See e.g. Merriman v. Crompton Corp., et al.,     Kan.   , 146 P.3d 162 (Nov. 9, 2006) (personal 
jurisdiction issues contested). The defendants are often admitted criminals having plead guilty to criminal indictments by the U.S. 
Department of Justice or been found civilly liable in federal court for price fixing, as in this case. With nothing to lose, defendants 
raise practically every imaginable technical contrivance to avoid or delay the judgment day. By the time the conspiracy is 
discovered and the procedural wrangling over, the defendants have gone broke or returned assets to a foreign country making 
collection difficult or impossible (the former is suggested here). A class action is the only plausible remedy, which is a long, 
expensive, and risky undertaking to say the least, again as this consolidated case dating from 1999 amply demonstrates. See 
Premier Pork Inc. v. Rhone-Poulenc, S.A., et al., Case No. 00-C-03 (Scott County District Court) (class certification hotly 
contested); Bellinder v. Microsoft, 2001 WL 1397995 (Kan.Dist.Ct. Johnson County, Sept. 7, 2001) (same). And finally. Kansas 
has such a small population (about 1% of the U.S. population), that without full consideration damages, it would not be worth the 
trouble and risk to bring the wrongdoers to court to recover only an overcharge amount. On the other hand, full consideration 
damages can be a significant cost of doing business, and thereby protect Kansas markets from the anticompetitive conduct. Full 
consideration damages are not only large enough to make bringing a case worthwhile, but also simpler to prove so that the 
Kansas courts are not tied up for weeks as economists testify about different expert damage estimates. The wrongdoers should 
not get that benefit, and this rescission like remedy is quite common in the law. The Kansas Legislature made clear that antitrust 
damages which are designed to primarily punish and deter, as distinct from compensate, are the ""full consideration or price paid"" 
for the price fixed product. In addition, recognizing that many antitrust violations go undetected, like most other crimes, the 
Kansas Legislature imposed an added deterrents by providing for the trebling of full consideration statutory damages, attorney's 
fees, and pre-judgment interest. While this is not open ended punitive damages, it does serve to some extent a deterrence 
function of those who have adversely affected Kansas markets. Full consideration is a legal and proper statutory remedy for 
such criminal and wrongful conduct. "
1385,11," Since Judgment has not yet been paid and satisfied. Defendants have not been dismissed and the claims process is not yet 
ripe for consideration by this Court. When it is, the Court will be guided by the findings in Premier Pork Inc. (Kansas Methionine 
Antitrust Class) ""funds should compensate the victims by way of direct payments through a claims process, discounts off of 
products by coupons or otherwise, or cy pres distributions to charities that have some relation to the issues in the case."" Id. "
1386,12," It should be noted that none of the judgment has yet been paid, claimed, or distributed to the Class, but the ""results obtained"" 
means the results obtained by the lawyer for the client. If the class members do not avail themselves of the judgment by making 
claims and receiving distributions, they have no one to blame but themselves. Of course, in all contingent fee cases, if the 
judgment is uncollectible in whole or in part, then the corresponding percentage of attorneys' fees will be uncollectible in whole 
or in part. Consequently, the attorneys' fees are expressed in a percentage of the collected judgment. "
1390,1," It turns out that the Bafuses moved to Boise from Washington state and they were formally referred to Stan Thomas of Aspen 
Realty by Darl Roberts, who is Mr. Bafus's step-father. The referral to Stan was so that he would act as a buyer's agent and 
assist the Bafuses to locate housing in the Treasure Valley. As a result of this formal referral, Darl Roberts received a "
1391,," percentage of the selling real estate agent's commission. This is reflected in the Seller's closing statement as a ""debit"" to 
""associated broker commission"" and in the Buyer's closing statement as a ""credit"" for ""associated brokers referral fee."""
1391,2," The original case contained four class representatives and four separate real estate brokerage firms. Judge Winmill found that, 
although the Plaintiffs' claims were the same or similar, they did not arise out of the same or series of transactions and, 
therefore, that the cases should be severed into four separate cases. Each of the four cases is framed as a potential class 
action. "

1393,9," Aspen argues that the policy is illusory and therefore void because it insured against no risk. If the policy is void, then obviously 
the exclusion for trade law violations would not apply. This argument is more fully addressed under the discussion of the 
application of the loss of commissions exclusion, supra. "
1400,1," The Proposed Fourth Amended Complaint (""PFAC"") identifies the Subscriber Plaintiffs as Gail Temple, Mary Gilmartin, New 
York State Senator Toby Ann Stavisky, Janet Stravitz, Cynthia Falk, S. Joseph Domina, David and Colleen Finley, Paul 
Steinberg, and Cliff Wilson, individually and as co-executor of the estate of Michelle Wilson. (PFAC P 18.) The Subscriber 
Plaintiffs include a subcategory of plaintiffs also designated as the Union Plaintiffs, which consists of members of the New York 
State United Teachers, Civil Service Employees Association, Organization of New York State Management/Confidential 
Employees, and New York State Police Investigators Association. The Union Plaintiffs entered this lawsuit by means of a 
Complaint in Intervention following this Court's granting their unopposed motion to intervene on January 30, 2003. See AMA v. 
United Healthcare Corp., No. 00 Civ. 2800 (LMM), 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1398, 2003 WL 230897 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 30, 2003). For 
purposes of this motion, they are included within the Subscriber Plaintiffs."
1400,2," Provider Plaintiffs are identified in the PFAC as Michael Attkiss, M.D., and William B. Ericson, Jr., M.D. (PFAC P 20.)"
1400,3," Medical Association Plaintiffs are identified in the PFAC as the American Medical Association, the Medical Society of the State 
of New York, and the Missouri State Medical Association. (PFAC P 20.)"
1400,4," Plaintiffs' TAC includes similar allegations against American Airlines and Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. The proposed 
amendments to the TAC -- and consequently this motion for leave to amend the TAC -- implicate only United Healthcare and do 
not involve either of the other defendants in this action. "
1401,5," Following the October 2002 Order, the Union Plaintiffs moved to intervene in this action on behalf of their members, New York 
State employees and Empire Plan beneficiaries, and this Court granted that unopposed motion on January 30, 2003. See AMA 
v. United Healthcare Corp., No. 00 Civ. 2800 (LMM), 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1398, 2003 WL 230897 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 30, 2003). 
Thereafter, the defendants moved to dismiss Union Plaintiffs' Complaint in Intervention and to compel arbitration of the Union 
Plaintiffs' claims. This Court denied both motions on August 22, 2003. See AMA v. United Healthcare Corp., No. 00 Civ. 2800 
(LMM), 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14686, 2003 WL 28004877 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 22, 2003). "
1402,6," Notably, Plaintiffs explain their delay as resulting from an insufficient knowledge of the facts required to plead RICO and 
antitrust claims rather than from ignorance of applicable RICO or antitrust laws. The latter reason was found unavailing in 
several cases on which Defendants rely. See, e.g., Sanders v. Thrall Car Mfg. Co., 582 F. Supp. 945 (S.D.N.Y. 1983), aff'd, 730 
F.2d 910 (2d Cir. 1984); Cresswell v. Sullivan & Cromwell, 922 F.2d 60, 72 (2d Cir. 1990). "
1403,7," The parties dispute which documents provide the basis for Plaintiffs' proposed amendments. Defendants point to certain 
documents that were turned over to Plaintiffs earlier in the Stage One discovery process, arguing that Plaintiffs were long in 
possession of the information necessary to form a basis for their proposed RICO and antitrust claims. Plaintiffs counter that 
these three documents ""are, on their face, peripheral to Plaintiffs' key allegations in the Amendment"" and cite depositions taken 
in late 2003 as critical to their proposed amendments. The Court finds Plaintiffs' multiple citations to the 2003 depositions 
persuasive and accepts Plaintiffs' declaration that the proposed amendments are based, at least in part, on discovery obtained 
in late 2003."
1403,8," The Court notes that seeking such consent is in accordance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) and that Plaintiffs' attempt to obtain 
Defendants' consent provides some justification for the three months of delay between the seeking of consent in April 2004 and 
the filing of this motion in July 2004. See generally Journal Publishing Co. v. Am. Home Ins. Co., 771 F. Supp. 632, 637 
(S.D.N.Y. 1991) (permitting plaintiffs to amend their complaint four years after the filing of the original complaint where, inter alia, 
plaintiffs had sought defendants' consent to the amendment in order to avoid motion practice)."
1403,9," A motion for summary judgment as to certain plaintiffs has been filed in this case, but it is based not on the merits but on the 
results of Stage One discovery, which was limited to preliminary matters such as the proper parties. It is thus unlike the motions 
for summary judgment in the cited cases, which were all filed post-discovery, reflecting the advanced procedural status of those 
cases. "
1404,10," In assessing the degree of prejudice required, the Block court observed that the required demonstration of prejudice varies 
inversely with the period of unexplained delay in seeking the amendment: ""The longer the period of an unexplained delay, the 
less will be required of the nonmoving party in terms of a showing of prejudice."" Block v. First Blood Assocs., 988 F.2d 344, 350 
(2d Cir. 1993) (quotations omitted) (emphasis added). Here, because the Court has found that the Plaintiffs provided an 
adequate explanation for their delay, Defendants are not entitled to a lower threshold level in showing prejudice despite the 
length of time that has passed since the filing of the TAC. However, even if that threshold were lowered, the Court's conclusion 
would remain the same: Defendants have failed to show sufficient prejudice to justify the Court's denying Plaintiffs' motion for 
leave to amend. "
1408,11," They are time-barred unless they were fraudulently concealed or they relate back to the filing of the original complaint. See 
discussion infra Sections II.E.1.b-c."
1408,12," The Court must address Plaintiffs' argument that their claims are not time-barred on the basis of fraudulent concealment in 
order to ascertain to what extent injuries alleged to have occurred prior to July 15, 2000 -- outside the applicable four-year 
statute of limitations -- may form a basis for Plaintiffs' Proposed Antitrust and RICO claims. "
1409,13," Again, although Plaintiffs' Proposed RICO and Antitrust Claims are not barred by the statute of limitations to the extent that 
they arise from injuries incurred after July 15, 2000, the Court must nonetheless address whether those proposed claims relate 
back to the original complaint in order to ascertain whether Plaintiffs may recover under antitrust and RICO law on the basis of 
injuries sustained before July 15, 2000. Because Plaintiffs failed to adequately allege fraudulent concealment, any such claims 
are time-barred unless they relate back to the original complaint. "
1410,14," The Proposed RICO Claims include four counts alleging violations of federal RICO law and one count alleging, on behalf of 
plaintiffs who reside in Florida, violations of the Florida RICO Act, 895.01 et seq. Defendants' arguments in opposition to 
Plaintiffs' motion for leave to file an amended complaint address only the federal RICO claims, so the Court here confines its 
analysis to whether Plaintiffs' proposed federal RICO claims state a claim upon which relief may be granted. "
1411,15," The extent to which an alleged enterprise must have a structure and organization separate and apart from the predicate acts it 
is alleged to have engaged in is a somewhat open question in this Circuit. For a detailed analysis of the Second Circuit 
precedents on this issue and the district court cases construing them, see World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. v. Jakks Pacific, 
Inc., 425 F. Supp. 2d 484, 493-500 (S.D.N.Y. 2006). The World Wrestling Court found that First Capital Asset Mgmt. v. 
Satinwood, Inc., 385 F.3d 159 (2d Cir. 2004), had not overruled United States v. Mazzei, 700 F.2d 85, 89 (2d Cir. 1988), an 
earlier precedent that held that the ""enterprise"" and ""pattern of racketeering"" elements were not required to be ""distinct and 
independent, as long as the proof offered is sufficient to satisfy both elements."" World Wrestling, 425 F. Supp. 2d at 495. The 
World Wrestling Court therefore found that the plaintiffs had adequately pled the ""enterprise"" element of their RICO claim even "
1412,," though their complaint ""[d]id not allege a RICO enterprise that has an ascertainable structure beyond the purported racketeering 
acts."" Id. at 494. Because the enterprise alleged here satisfies the more stringent First Capital standard in addition to the the 
Mazzei standard, the Court need not address which standard governs."
1412,16," The Court notes that the HIAA Group is not specifically mentioned in the description of the Out-of-Network Enterprise's 
members and that Plaintiffs' citations to the Proposed Amendment's references to the HIAA Group are drawn from sections of 
the Proposed Amendment involving background information and the Proposed Antitrust Claims rather from the section involving 
the Proposed RICO Claims. However, as Plaintiffs note, the ""users of [the] UCR databases"" who are alleged to be members of 
the Out-of-Network Enterprise include ""insurance companies who are members of the HIAA Group."" (Proposed Amendment P 
247, Pls.' Reply 38.) While this link seems to be somewhat attenuated, under the Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) standard applicable at 
this stage the Court must ""read the facts alleged in the complaint in the light most favorable"" to the Plaintiff. H.J. Inc. v. 
Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 249, 109 S. Ct. 2893, 106 L. Ed. 2d 195 (1989). The Court therefore accepts Plaintiffs' 
allegations concerning the HIAA Group as relating to, and alleging facts regarding the existence of, the Out-of-Network 
Enterprise."
1412,17," United Healthcare also argues that Plaintiffs' alleged association-in-fact enterprise fails because the members are competitors 
and therefore cannot be ""associated together for a common purpose."" (Defs.' Mem. in Opp. 43 (citing Turkette, 452 U.S. at 
583).) This contention is without merit: Plaintiffs clearly allege a common purpose for the alleged enterprise -- using the 
databases to depress UCR reimbursement rates -- that is not inconsistent with the fact that members of the alleged enterprise 
may ""compete against one another for consumers in the insurance industry."" (Id.) "
1413,18, The multi-district litigation panel declined to include this case in the consolidated MCL litigation.
1413,19," Klay v. Humana, 382 F.3d 1241 (11th Cir. 2004), is an earlier incarnation of the case that was later designated as MCL. In the 
summary judgment decision asserted to create preclusive effect here, the MCL court referenced Klay as providing ""a more 
detailed factual and procedural background of this multidistrict litigation."" MCL, 430 F. Supp. 2d 1336, 1340 (S.D. Fla. 2006)."
1413,20," Various other defendant HMOs had reached settlements with the plaintiffs or otherwise been dismissed from the action, so at 
the time of the MCL summary judgment decision at issue here only two defendants, United Healthcare and Coventry Health 
Care, Inc., remained. "
1414,21," The Plaintiffs articulate a slightly different test for whether res judicata applies, relying on the four-prong inquiry established by 
the Second Circuit in Corbett v. MacDonald Moving Services, Inc., 124 F.3d 82, 88 (2d Cir. 1997) (The court must inquire 
whether ""1) the prior decision was a final judgment on the merits, 2) the litigants were the same parties, 3) the prior court was of 
competent jurisdiction, and 4) the causes of action were the same.""). While this test is substantially similar to the three-step 
analysis set forth in Monahan v. New York City Dep't of Corrections, 214 F.3d 275 (2d Cir. 2000), it should be noted that the 
Court applies the Monahan articulation of the res judicata inquiry because the Corbett version is specific to bankruptcy 
proceedings. See In re Layo, 460 F.3d 289, 292 (2d Cir. 2006) (""In Corbett, we set forth the test for res judicata in bankruptcy 
proceedings involving a plan of reorganization."")."
1414,22," The Plaintiffs draw the language ""a final judgment on the merits"" from the Corbett Court's statement of the res judicata 
standard. See Corbett, 124 F.3d at 88. The res judicata standard followed here, as discussed supra n.22, is taken not from 
Corbett but from Monahan, which uses the language ""an adjudication on the merits"" rather than ""a final judgment on the merits."" 
Monahan, 214 F.3d at 285. "
1415,23," Res judicata, as Defendants correctly note, ""is not limited to only claims that were actually litigated."" (Defs.' Reply to Suppl. 
Auth. 5.) Rather, it bars all legal claims that a party could have raised in the prior litigation. It does not, however, as Defendants 
state, ""extend[] to all matters that the plaintiff raised or could have raised to support its claim in the first action."" (Id. at 5 
(emphasis added).) That is, Defendants do not argue that the Provider and Medical Association Plaintiffs could have brought the 
RICO and antitrust claims proposed here in the earlier litigation because they arose out of the transactions, evidence, and facts 
at issue in MCL. Rather, they argue that the MCL plaintiffs could have relied on transactions, evidence, and facts relating to "
1416,," HIAA and PHCS (which form the basis of the proposed claims here) to support the claims they actually did raise in MCL. While 
whether ""the same evidence is needed to support both claims"" is relevant to the res judicata inquiry, see NLRB v. United 
Technologies Corp., 706 F.2d 1254, 1260 (2d Cir. 1983), the mere fact that a party ""could have raised"" a particular fact (rather 
than a particular claim) in the earlier action does not reflect the proper standard for assessing the res judicata effect of that prior 
action. The Court therefore will not give particular weight to whether the MCL plaintiffs ""could have raised [facts relating to HIAA 
and PHCS] to support [their] claim in the first action"" except in determining to what extent evidence needed to support the MCL 
claims is also needed to support the Proposed RICO and Antitrust Claims here. (Defs.' Reply to Suppl. Auth. 5.) "
1423,1, Defendants replied to Plaintiffs's opposition (Docket # 38) and Plaintiff surreplied (Docket # 44). 
1424,2," At this point, it is worth mentioning that HN4[
] the Antitrust Division (AD) of the United States Department of Justice has a business review process, parallel to that available under Act 77, 10 L.P.R.A. § 261(c). See, 28 C.F.R. § 50.6. The AD may, upon 
request of a party, ""state its present enforcement intention with respect to the proposed business conduct."" 28 C.F.R. § 50.6(8). 
The opinion issued by the AD pursuant to that process states only the enforcement intention of the Division, who remains free to 
bring whatever action it deems appropriate to protect the public interest. See, 28 C.F.R. § 50.6(9). Defendants asserted in their motion to quash that the holding of Cabrera was legally flawed because ""[o]ne need look no further 
than the federal counterpart to the Puerto Rico Antitrust Act, as well as half a century of regulatory practice by the Federal Trade 
Commission, to find both 'a reason for being' of the confidentiality provision of the [Act] and a 'compelling government interest' 
for creating such confidentiality."" Docket # 32, p. 6. Despite Defendants' contention, HN5[
] the business review process available in the AD of the U.S. Department of Justice 
does not protect the information provided by the parties seeking the AD's opinion on a proposed business transaction. On the 
contrary, the law provides that ""the business review request, and the Division's letter in response shall be indexed and placed in 
a file available to the public upon request."" 28 C.F.R. § 50.6(10)(a)(our emphasis). It also provides that ""the information 
supplied to support the business review request and any other information supplied by the requesting party in connection with 
the transaction that is the subject of the business review request, shall be indexed and placed in a file with the request and the 
Divisions' letter, available to the public upon request."" 28 C.F.R. § 50.6(10)(b)(our emphasis). The parties requesting the 
review, however, may ask the AD, prior to the creation of this index, not to publish certain information, by showing good cause 
therefor. See, 28 C.F.R. § 50.6(10)(c). These 
business 
review 
letters 
are 
available 
in

See, http:www.usdoj.gov./atr/foia/foiapublicdocs.htm. "
1425,3," Although the documents requested by the Plaintiff in that case were compiled by the DOJ pursuant to 10 L.P.R.A. § 271, and 
not 10 L.P.R.A. § 261(c), the language in both sections regarding the confidentiality of the documents in the same. Moreover, 
the rationale applied by the P.R. Court of Appeals in Cabrera made no distinction between the sections."
1425,4," The balancing is confided to the discretion of the district judge. The requesting party's need for the materials is balanced 
against a number of factors: (1) the extent to which disclosure will thwart governmental processes by discouraging citizens from 
giving the government information, (2) the impact upon persons who have given information of having their identities disclosed, 
(3) the degree to which governmental self-evaluation and consequent program improvement will be chilled by disclosure, (4) 
whether the information sought is factual data or evaluative summary, (5) whether the party seeking disclosure is an actual or 
potential defendant in any criminal proceeding either pending or reasonably likely to follow from the incident in question, (6) 
whether the police investigation has been completed, (7) whether any interdepartmental disciplinary proceedings have arisen or 
may arise from the investigation, (8) whether the plaintiff's suit is non-frivolous and brought in good faith (9) whether the 
information sought is available through other discovery or from other sources, and (10) the importance of the information sought 
to the plaintiff's case. See, Carpet, 181 F.R.D. at 688; see also, Sealed, 856 F. 2d. at 272. The considerations are numerous and "
1426,," the privilege is far from absolute. We will not enter in this phase of the analysis because the requirements of the doctrine are not 
present in this case."
1426,5," Besides Defendants' argument has been dismissed in the past. See, Atlantic Investment Management, LLC v. Millenium Fund 
I, LTD, 212 F.R.D. 395, 397 (N.D. IL. 2002)(holding that an attorney's failure to sign a subpoena can be cured). "
1434,1," We will refer collectively to appellees Waste Management of Texas, Inc. and Waste Management Holdings, Inc. (f/k/a Waste 
Management, Inc.) as ""Waste Management."" "
1435,2," Waste Management disputes that it gave final approval. Martin initially testified that Loren Alexander of Waste Management 
reviewed and approved the memo. Two years later, Martin testified that, upon reading Alexander's deposition denying that he 
approved it, Martin was changing his testimony to agree that Alexander did not give final approval for the memo."
1435,3," Martin was originally named as a defendant, but the claims against him were voluntarily dismissed."
1435,4," Texas Disposal ultimately finalized its contract with San Antonio in January 1998 and with Austin in May 2000 (following a 
temporary contract that had been entered into with Austin in February 1999). "
1436,5," The motion also sought to dismiss claims based on Waste Management's hiring of Texas Disposal's former employees, which 
had been added in Texas Disposal's July 2000 amended petition, as being barred by res judicata because they were subject to 
a final judgment in a separate suit in Bexar County. These claims were ultimately dismissed and are not a part of this appeal."
1436,6," Subsequently, the court reconsidered this ruling, prompting Waste Management to file a renewed motion for partial summary 
judgment on the issue, to which Texas Disposal filed a response. In its March 25, 2003 summary judgment order, the court 
again resolved the issue in favor of Waste Management. "
1437,7," The record reflects that leachate is ""any liquid that comes in contact with garbage."" The liquid may result from nature or may be 
generated by the waste in the landfill. Because this liquid is polluted, state and federal regulations (such as ""Subtitle D"" of the 
EPA rules) require that landfills have a method of collecting, extracting, and disposing of it. By implying that Texas Disposal's 
landfill had no leachate collection system, the memo implied that the landfill failed to comply with Subtitle D."
1437,8," Although the summary judgment order also found fact issues remaining on the business disparagement claim, thereby 
preserving the claim for trial, it is not relevant here because the claim was dismissed on directed verdict, and Texas Disposal did 
not raise the dismissal of this claim as an issue on appeal."
1437,9," Also, at the close of the evidence Texas Disposal requested a partial directed verdict on the issue of defamation per se, which 
the trial court denied. "
1438,10," As an initial matter, Texas Disposal claims that this Court lacks jurisdiction over Waste Management's cross point because 
Waste Management did not file a separate notice of appeal on the issue of affirming the take-nothing judgment based on a lack 
of evidence about actual malice. See Tex. R. App. P. 25.1(c). According to Texas Disposal, a separate notice of appeal is 
necessary because Waste Management seeks greater relief by this cross point than was granted by the trial court. We disagree 
and address the merits of Waste Management's cross point. See Helton v. Railroad Comm'n, 126 S.W.3d 111, 119 (Tex. App.--
Houston [1st Dist.] 2003, pet. denied) (distinguishing (1) cross points requiring separate notice of appeal because they seek to 
alter judgment by seeking more relief than was granted in judgment from (2) cross points that do not require separate notice of 
appeal because they present merely an alternative basis for affirming judgment); First Gen. Realty Corp. v. Maryland Cas. Co., 
981 S.W.2d 495, 503 (Tex. App.--Austin 1998, pet. denied) (no separate notice of appeal is needed for appellees to present 
alternative grounds for affirming take-nothing judgment)."
1438,11, Texas Disposal does not contend that the trial court erred in ruling that it is a limited purpose public figure. 
1439,12," Martin was the consultant hired by Waste Management to prepare the memo. Erwin was one of Martin's primary sources of 
information relating to the landfill liner and leachate collection system issues discussed in the Action Alert memo."
1439,13, The jury was further instructed on the meaning of clear and convincing evidence.
1439,14," The trial court also ruled, however, that the statement about increased traffic on IH-35 was not actionable because it was 
""opinion, rhetoric, or hyperbole."" "
1440,15," The trial court ruled as such in its March 2003 summary judgment order, and Waste Management does not challenge that 
ruling on appeal. See supra footnote 7 and accompanying text. "
1441,16," Martin also provided inconsistent testimony about the review and approval of the memo that he obtained from Waste 
Management personnel. He initially testified in his deposition, which was read aloud to the jury, that people from Waste 
Management (specifically, Loren Alexander) had reviewed and given final approval to the memo before he submitted it for a ""fax 
blast"" to the Austin ""environmental community."" Then, in live testimony, Martin announced that, because he had since read 
Alexander's deposition in which he denied approving the memo, Martin was changing his testimony to say that Alexander had 
not approved the memo. While this is not direct proof that Martin knew of the falsity or seriously doubted the truth about the 
statements in the Action Alert, it does provide circumstantial evidence about his overall credibility as a witness. From Martin's "
1442,," equivocating about who was ultimately responsible for the statements in the memo, the jury could infer that Martin was willing to 
alter his testimony to protect himself and/or his long-time associates at Waste Management."
1442,17," Waste Management contends that the issue briefed by Texas Disposal preserved error only on the lack of a defamation per se 
question, but not the accompanying instruction. We reject this hyper-technical interpretation. It is clear from Texas Disposal's 
complaint about the court's failure to ""query"" the jury that Texas Disposal is collectively complaining about the court's refusal to 
submit the relevant questions and instructions regarding defamation per se and presumed damages. For instance, one of the "
1443,," subheadings of Texas Disposal's first issue states, globally, that ""TDSL was entitled to a jury charge consistent with the law of 
defamation per se"" and thereafter discusses error regarding both the question and instructions. Texas Disposal has effectively 
presented this issue for our review. See Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(e) (""statement of an issue will be treated as covering every 
subsidiary issue that is fairly included""). "
1444,18," Waste Management asserts in its response to the motion for rehearing that Texas Disposal failed to present an argument on 
appeal that fact issues remained regarding defamation per se. We disagree. In its reply brief, Texas Disposal's first argument 
claims ""A fact issue was raised as to defamation per se, and thus the issue should have been submitted to the jury."" See Tex. R. 
App. P. 38.1(e). "
1449,19," Specifically, the court ruled that, pursuant to Waste Management's traditional summary judgment grounds, it had conclusively 
negated these two essential elements of Texas Disposal's attempted monopolization claim and that, pursuant to its no-evidence 
ground, Texas Disposal had failed to produce a scintilla of evidence to support the dangerous probability element. See Tex. R. 
Civ. P. 166a(c), (i); Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Rodriguez, 92 S.W.3d 502, 506 (Tex. 2002) (no evidence standard); Elliott-
Williams Co. v. Diaz, 9 S.W.3d 801, 803 (Tex. 1999) (traditional standard). The court denied Waste Management's motion as to 
the ""intent to monopolize"" element, finding that there was evidence in support of it. Thus, Texas Disposal's challenge on appeal 
is limited to the other two elements--predatory or anticompetitive conduct and a dangerous probability of achieving a monopoly. "
1458,1," United Artists Theatre Company and United Artists Theatre Circuit, Inc. were acquired by Regal in early 2002 and are 
subsidiaries of Regal Entertainment Group. For purposes of this motion, Regal and its United Artists subsidiaries will be treated 
as one defendant. "
1459,2," The Union Square 14 opened in November 1998. (Regal's 56.1 Statement P 5.) It was owned and operated by United Artists 
until early 2002, when Regal acquired United Artists. (Regal's Local Rule 56.1 Statement PP 3 & 7.)"
1459,3," The exhibitor negotiates a house allowance for each of its auditoriums the distributor. Historically, these ""house allowances"" 
have been based primarily on the costs the exhibitor incurs to own and operate its theatre. (Def.'s Mem. at 4.) The house 
allowance is based on factors such as the number of seats, show times, the length of run and other such variables. Generally, 
house allowances are higher for auditoriums with more seats."
1459,4," ""Settlement"" means that the formal agreement between the exhibitor and the distributor would be subject to renegotiation if the 
exhibitor would not make a sufficient profit on the deal under the formal terms. See Geoffrey Verter & Anita M. McGahan, 
Coming Soon: A Theatre Near You 4 (Sept. 24, 1998) (case study, on file with The Harvard Business School Publishing). "
1460,5," While Plaintiffs call this zone the ""Lower Manhattan Zone,"" industry professionals refer to this zone as the ""Village Zone."" (See 
Keeley Aff., 107.)"
1460,6," A current listing in a local newspaper shows the following movies at the Angelika and Landmark Sunshine Theatres: ""The Story 
of a Murderer,"" ""Notes on a Scandal,"" ""The Painted Veil,"" ""The Good German,"" ""The Queen,"" ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" ""Letters from 
Iwo Jima"" and ""Volver."" At the Village East, the following movies are playing: ""Children of Men,"" ""Dreamgirls,"" ""Apocalypto,"" 
""Borat,"" and ""Little Children."""
1460,7," Even a cursory review of the films now running at ""art"" theatres, see supra note 6, suggests that these factors are not useful in 
defining a top commercial film. For example, ""The Good German"" stars George Clooney; Helen Mirra appears in ""The Queen,"" 
Clint Eastwood is the Director of ""Letters from Iwo Jima,"" which is itself a sequel to (or the other side of the coin of) ""Flags of our 
Fathers."" Dame Judi Dench and Kate Blanchett perform in ""Notes on a Scandal."" Plaintiffs proposed explanation on why these 
first-run, very popular movies should be kept in a separate product market from top commercial films, such as ""Dreamgirls"" or 
""Borat,"" which features fractured English, without subtitles, is not satisfactory. It is not immediately apparent why these (or their 
equivalents during the period in suit) are or should be in a separate product market. What is ""art"" to one person may well be 
""commercial"" to another. In the last analysis, the goal of movies in whatever category is to make money. "
1461,8," Despite the fact that both the Village East and the Loews Village VII have seven auditoriums, and both had access to top-
grossing commercial films, the Village East consistently grossed less than the Village VII. (See Keeley Aff., Ex. 118.) This is 
likely due to the fact that the Village East's auditoriums are smaller, and therefore can accommodate less patrons during each 
showing of a movie. (See Palansky Aff., Ex. 38, at 2.)"
1461,9," By contrast, the Village East only has stadium seating in two of its seven auditoriums. Most moviegoers prefer stadium seating, 
and therefore consider this factor when deciding where to see a movie. While Plaintiffs now argue that stadium seating is not as 
important to consumer choice as Regal maintains, in 2000 Plaintiff Citadel Cinemas admitted: ""[M]any of the Company's 
cinemas are older, and do not feature state of the art seating. [As a result, Citadel Cinemas] has found it difficult to compete with 
state of the art multiplex and megaplex cinemas. . . ."" (Palansky Dep., Ex. 55, at 4.)"
1461,10," While Plaintiffs' executive did not identify the Union Square 14 in this statement, given that the Union Square 14 was United 
Artist's newest, largest, and most up-to-date theatre, it is most likely that he was talking about the Union Square 14 theatre."
1461,11," While the Village Voice, a local newspaper, described the Village East as a beautiful theatre--""one of a handful of theaters in 
New 
York 
that 
isn't 
completely 
sterile""--it 
noted 
that 
the 
theat's 
facilities 
are 
inadequate. 
See www.villagevoice.com/nycguide/ve5218,5.html. Specifically, the paper stated that most of the Village East's auditoriums have 
""ludicrously small screens"" and that the ""Carnegie Hall-style steepness [of the main auditorium] ensures that absolutely no seat 
has comfortable sightlines."" Id. "
1462,12," Regal's Senior Vice President of Film explained that when new multiplex theatres open in a neighborhood, older theatres often 
go out of business. (See Cooper Dep. 233:5-10.) In fact, according to Regal executives, Regal has closed approximately 1800 
older, sloped floor screens because they were not able to compete after multiplex theatres opened nearby. (See id. 233:11-22; 
Campbell Dep. 154:16-23.) "
1463,13," Judge Lynch explained that ""[c]ircuit deals are agreements whereby exhibitors use their monopoly power (or near monopoly 
power) in one or more areas to negotiate blanket exclusive agreements with distributors covering all of their theatres, including 
areas where they may have competition."" Reading, 317 F. Supp. 2d at 318; see also United States v. Griffith, 334 U.S. 100, 107-
09, 68 S. Ct. 941, 92 L. Ed. 1236 (1948) (discussing circuit dealing and declaring such conduct in restraint of trade), rev'd on 
other grounds, Beech Cinema, Inc. v. Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp., 622 F.2d 1106, 1109-10 (2d Cir. 1980) (holding that 
sufficient evidence exists to sustain finding of circuit dealing between film distributor and theatre chain in violation of the 
Sherman Act). "
1467,14," This test is often referred to as ""cross-elasticity of demand."" See, e.g., Hayden Pub'g Co. v. Cox Broad. Corp., 730 F.2d 64, 71 
(2d Cir. 1984). "
1468,15," In fact, one document containing box office market share for 2002 lists Clearview Chelsea as grossing less than City Cinemas, 
suggesting perhaps that Clearview Chelsea also contains older, less desirable theatres in Manhattan. (See Keeley Aff., Ex. 54.) 
In light of this, there is no reason to believe that the Union Square 14 and the Clearview Chelsea are comparable theatres, so 
that an increase in ticket prices at the former would drive customers to the latter."
1468,16," Plaintiffs' theory ignores, for example, that many New Yorkers already have monthly passes providing unlimited rides on the 
subway system. Thus, for many New Yorkers, shifting from a theatre in the LMZ to a theatre outside of the LMZ does not add 
additional costs. "
1469,17," As explained in the background section above, a clearance agreement is an agreement between a theatre and a distributor 
that a particular film will not be played simultaneously for a particular period of time at two different theatres in the same zone. 
The Supreme Court explained in Paramount that ""[a] clearance is the period of time, usually stipulated in license agreements, 
which must elapse between runs of the same feature within a particular area or in specified theatres."" 334 U.S. at 145 n. 6. "
1470,18," In opposition to such a finding, Plaintiffs point to the fact that ""a number of theatres in Manhattan play day and date with each 
other that are approximately the same 0.4 mile walking distance from one another as are the [Union Square 14] and the [Village 
East]."" (Pls.' Mem. Law Opp'n 22.) This statement confuses the issue. Clearance agreements are contractual arrangements, to 
be negotiated--within the bounds permitted under Paramount--between an exhibitor and a distributor at the time of licensing. The 
simple fact that some theatres choose not to negotiate clearance agreements against nearby theatres does not render clearance 
agreements between other theatres--such as the Union Square 14 and the Village East--unreasonable under the Sherman Act. "
1473,19," HN23[
] Under New York law, proof that a defendant was motivated by ""self-interest or other economic considerations"" will 
not suffice to make out a claim for tortious interference with prospective business relations. See, e.g., Shared Communications 
Services of ESR, Inc. v. Goldman Sachs & Co., 23 A.D.3d 162, 163, 803 N.Y.S.2d 512 (1st Dep't 2005). In fact, evidence of self-
interest services to rebut any allegation of malice. See id. There is no doubt that Regal's relationships with distributors were 
motivated by Regal's own economic self-interest, and therefore Plaintiffs cannot establish malice."
1473,20," The Court assumes that the wrongful conduct alleged by Plaintiffs was unlawful licensing agreements in violation of the 
Sherman Act. Because the Court finds that Regal has not violated the Sherman Act, however, these allegations do not suffice to 
make out a claim for tortious interference with prospective business relations. Plaintiffs' failure to identify any wrongful conduct 
by Regal is fatal to its claim. "
1487,1," The plaintiffs are the cities of Moundridge, Kansas; Winfield, Kansas; Coffeyville, Kansas; Denison, Kansas; Garnett, Kansas; 
Greensburg, Kansas; Halstead, Kansas; Humboldt, Kansas; Iola, Kansas; La Cygne, Kansas; Macon, Missouri; Minneapolis, 
Kansas; Osage City, Kansas; Rensselaer, Indiana; Sabinal, Texas; Shelbina, Missouri; and Wellington, Kansas, and the Village 
of Stonington, Illinois. "
1488,2," The NPC is an advisory committee to the Department of Energy that operates pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act 
of 1972. (ConocoPhillips Mem. of P. & A. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss (""Mot. to Dismiss"") at 3.) ""Members of the [NPC] are 
appointed by the Secretary of Energy and are drawn from geographically diverse segments of the oil and gas industries, 
academia, financial and research institutions, public interest entities, Native American tribes, and other groups."" Id."

1488,4," The Henry Hub is a pipeline hub on the Louisiana Gulf Coast which is the delivery point for the natural gas futures contracts on 
the NYMEX. (2d Supp. Compl. P 24.) All defendants use Henry Hub prices in their third quarter 2005 financial reports, with the 
exception of Exxon Mobil which does not break out natural gas prices. (Id.) "
1492,5," HN8[
] To establish personal jurisdiction, a plaintiff ""is entitled to reasonable discovery"" if the plaintiff requests it. Second Amendment Found. v. U.S. Conference of Mayors, 348 U.S. App. D.C. 238, 274 F.3d 521, 525 (D.C. Cir. 2001). Plaintiffs in this 
case have not sought jurisdictional discovery. "
1494,6," HN20[
] Plaintiffs rightfully carry a heavier burden in answering a jurisdictional challenge under Rule 12(b)(2) than a 12(b)(6) challenge to the sufficiency of pled claim. Generally, a claim is adequately pled if it satisfies Rule 8(a)(2)'s threshold of a short 
and plain factual statement which if proven would entitle the pleader to relief. That entitles a plaintiff to proceed with litigation. 
Stokes v. Cross, 356 U.S. App. D.C. 73, 327 F.3d 1210, 1215 (D.C. Cir. 2003). However, under Rule 12(b)(2), a plaintiff must 
prove with a fuller and determinative factual presentation that a court has authority over a challenging party if that party is to be 
subject to the burdens of defending further litigation. See Zhu v. Gonzales, Civil Action No. 04-1408, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
26903, 2006 WL 1274767, at *3 (D.D.C. May 8, 2006) (holding that ""'[t]he plaintiff must allege specific acts connecting the 
defendant with the forum.' A plaintiff cannot merely make unsupported allegations or conclusory statements"" (internal citations 
omitted)). Cf. Kopff v. Battaglia, 425 F. Supp. 2d 76, 81 (D.D.C. 2006) (holding that, unlike in the 12(b)(6) context in which a 
court must treat a plaintiff's well-pleaded allegation as true, ""'[w]hen considering challenges to personal jurisdiction, the Court 
need not treat all of plaintiffs allegations as true and may receive and weigh affidavits and any other relevant material to assist it 
in determining the jurisdictional facts'"" (internal citation omitted)). "
1496,7," Defendant ConocoPhillips also contends that the NPC is immune from federal antitrust laws because the NPC is a federal 
instrumentality and NPC's immunity should be extended to defendants. (ConocoPhillips Mot. to Dismiss at 9-11, 20.) ""It is well-
established that HN23[
] the antitrust laws do not extend to actions of agencies or instrumentalities of the federal government, 
even when those agencies operate in competition with and to the detriment of private enterprise."" IT & E Overseas, Inc. v. RCA 
Global Commc'ns, Inc., 747 F. Supp. 6, 11 (D.D.C. 1990). Federal instrumentality immunity, however, applies only to situations 
where either the federal government or a federal instrumentality is complicit in the alleged antitrust violation. See Sea-Land 
Serv., Inc. v. Alaska R.R., 212 U.S. App. D.C. 197, 659 F.2d 243, 245 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (defendant immune from antitrust laws 
because of its status as ""an entity wholly owned and operated by the United States""); IT & E Overseas, Inc., 747 F. Supp. at 8-
10 (defendant immune from antitrust laws because the basis of defendant's alleged unlawful activity was a contract between 
defendant and a federal instrumentality); U.S. Postal Serv. v. Flamingo Indus. (USA) Ltd., 540 U.S. 736, 746, 158 L. Ed. 2d 19, 
124 S. Ct. 1321 (2004) (defendant United States Postal Service immune from antitrust laws because the Postal Service is a 
federal instrumentality); see also S. Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc. v. United States, 471 U.S. 48, 65, 105 S. Ct. 1721, 85 
L. Ed. 2d 36 (1985) (defendants immune from antitrust laws because state agency approved defendants' allegedly unlawful 
activity). Federal instrumentality immunity does not apply here because plaintiffs have not alleged that the NPC was complicit in 
defendants' alleged violation of the Sherman Act. Although defendants convened as members of the NPC at the request of the 
Secretary of Energy, plaintiffs have not alleged that the Secretary of Energy or other members of the NPC participated in 
defendants' alleged conspiracy to influence the outcome of the 2003 Report. Even assuming plaintiffs sufficiently claim that 
defendants conspired to manipulate the results of the NPC report, and caused actual gas prices to reflect or surpass the 
projections of the NPC report by ""reduc[ing] or exclud[ing] supplies for a sustained period of time and thereby increas[ing] 
wholesale prices"" (2d Supp. Compl. P 9), the plaintiffs allege only that defendants used the NPC as a tool, and not that the NPC 
itself fixed prices or reduced supply. Therefore, defendants are not immune from antitrust liability on that basis. "
1498,8," Although defendants moved to dismiss claims that they have monopolized or attempted to monopolize, plaintiffs failed to 
address those arguments in their opposition to the defendants' motions to dismiss. (Pls.' Opp'n at 17-21.) The defendants' 
motions to dismiss the claims of monopolization and attempted monopolization, therefore, are deemed conceded. Stephenson v. 
Cox, 223 F. Supp. 2d 119, 121 (D.D.C. 2002) (""[HN35[
] W]hen a plaintiff files a response to a motion to dismiss but fails to 
address certain arguments made by the defendant, the court may treat those arguments as conceded . . . .""). In any event, as is 
discussed below, plaintiffs have failed to state claims of actual or attempted monopolization. "

1512,1," This Memorandum and Order pertains exclusively to Park's individual claims because he has not yet moved for certification of 
a putative nationwide class of BAR/BRI purchasers. See, e.g. Novella v. Westchester County, No. 02 Civ. 2192 (MBM), 2004 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15152, 2004 WL 175820, at *1 n.1 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2004). "
1514,2," On September 29, 2006, Christine Arendas filed an action on behalf of herself and similarly situated consumers against 
BAR/BRI in the Middle District of Florida. Arendas v. The Thomas Corp., et al., No. 06 Civ. 1113. On December 8, 2006, District 
Judge Antoon transferred the Arendas action to the Southern District of New York. This Court accepts the Arendas action as a 
related case within the meaning of Local Rule 15(a). "
1515,3, BAR/BRI's proffered justifications for the alleged tying are discussed infra in Section II.D. 
1517,4," Where a tying arrangement is illegal per se, a plaintiff need not establish the anticompetitive effects element. See In re Visa 
Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litig. v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., 280 F.3d 124, 133 n.5 (2d Cir. 2001); In re Wireless, 385 F. Supp. 2d at 
414 (""Analysis under the per se rule is, by definition, without inquiry into actual market conditions."") (internal quotation omitted). 
""If a plaintiff succeeds in establishing the existence of sufficient market power to create a per se violation, the plaintiff is also 
relieved of the burden of rebutting any justifications the defendant may offer for the tie."" In re Wireless, 385 F. Supp. 2d at 414. "
1518,5," Concurring in Jefferson Parish, Justice O'Connor argued for abandoning the per se and rule of reason dichotomy for tying 
claims. 466 U.S. at 25. Adopting Justice O'Connor's analysis of tying claims, the majority opinion in Eastman Kodak, 504 U.S. at 
451, did not mention the terms per se and rule of reason. The Second Circuit, however, has not abandoned the per se and rule 
of reason distinction, and this Court will analyze the facts under both frameworks. See Visa Check, 280 F.3d at 134 n.5; see also 
Todd v. Exxon Corp., 275 F.3d 191, 198 (2d Cir. 2001) (Traditional ""hard-core"" price fixing remains per se unlawful under the 
seminal case United States v. Socony- Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 212-24, 60 S. Ct. 811, 84 L. Ed. 1129 (1940), and its 
progeny.""). "
1525,1, District One is defined as: 
1526,," All United States waters of the St. Lawrence River between the international boundary at St. Regis and a line at the head of 
the river running (at approximately 127 [degrees] True) between Carruthers Point Light and South Side Light extended to 
the New York shore."
1526,46, C.F.R. § 401.300(a)(1). 
1530,2," 46 C.F.R. § 401.340(a) provides: (a) United States or Canadian registered pilots utilizing the facilities and dispatching services of any authorized pool shall 
comply with its working rules approved under § 402.320, except to the extent inconsistent with the dispatch orders of the 
Director under § 401.720(b), and with other rules of the pool that are related to those facilities and services."
1530,3," 46 C.F.R. § 401.340(b) provides: The voluntary associations of U.S. Registered Pilots authorized to establish a pilotage pool may require a U.S. Registered 
Pilot to execute a written authorization for the pool to bill for services, deduct authorized expenses, and to comply with the 
working rules and other rules of the pool relating to such facilities and services. Facilities and services of the pool may be 
denied to any U.S. Registered Pilot who fails or refuses to execute such authorizations"
1530,4, 46 C.F.R. 401.320(b) provides: No voluntary association shall be authorized to establish a pool unless:
1530,*," * * (b) The stock, equity, or other financial interests coupled with voting rights or exercise of any right of control in the 
management of the voluntary association is held only by member Registered Pilots registered pursuant to § 401.200, § 
401.210, or § 401.220(e), excluding Applicant Pilots."
1530,5," The Court offers no opinion on whether, under federal regulations, the SLSPA may properly require all members to purchase a 
share in the Seaway Pilots Inc. as a condition of membership in the SLSPA. The Court's inquiry is limited to whether the 
condition is anticompetitive. "
1531,6," Indeed, Plaintiff worked as a independent pilot in District One for the 2001-2003 shipping seasons and was not a member of 
the SLSPA. See Compl. PP 19 - 20; Menkes v. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 402 F. Supp. 2d at 205-210. "
1538,1," Additional discussion of the factual allegations supporting StreamCast's causes of action is contained in the Court's September 
14, 2006 Orders addressing Defendants' motions to dismiss the First Amended Complaint. "
1540,2," In the interest of judicial economy, StreamCast and Defendants have stipulated that the Court's September 14, 2006 Orders 
shall apply to newly-served Defendants Joltid Ltd., Joltid OU, Indigo Investments, B.V., La Galiote, B.V., Sharman Networks, Inc. 
and Niklas Zennstrom is if these Defendants had joined in the prior motions addressed thereby. See Stipulation and Order 
Applying Court's Orders Dated September 14, 2006 to  [**10] Newly Served Defendants, December 4, 2006; Stipulation and 
Order Continuing Responsive Pleading Date to Second Amended Complaint and Establishing Briefing Schedule on Responsive 
Motions and Applying Court's Orders dated September 14, 2006 to defendant Joltid OU, December 7, 2006. Accordingly, the 
only claims remaining against these Defendants are the Third and Fourth claims for relief (antitrust), the Seventh claim for relief 
(unfair competition), the Eighth claim for relief (California Fraudulent Transfer Act) and the Eleventh claim for relief (declaratory 
judgment). "
1541,3," While the Sherman Act provides the substantive basis for StreamCast's antitrust claims, he Clayton Act supplies a private right 
of action therefor. See Glen Holly Entm't, Inc. v. Tektronix Inc., 352 F.3d 367, 371 (9th Cir. 2003) (""This HN3[
] law [section 4 of the Clayton Act] effectively allows private persons to sue for antitrust violations previously restricted by statute to government 
enforcement.""). "
1543,4," In fact, it is technically possible for a user to have more than one P2P file-sharing application on his or her computer at any 
given time."
1543,5," The Court is unpersuaded by StreamCast's argument  [**22] that it would benefit from further factual discovery on the issue, as 
StreamCast's own allegations form the primary basis for the Court's holding."
1543,6," The plaintiffs in the Grokster action have brought claims for copyright infringement against StreamCast and another provider of 
P2P ""file-sharing"" software, Grokster, Ltd. See, e.g., MGM Studios Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., 545 U.S. 913, 125 S. Ct. 2764, 162 L. 
Ed. 2d 781 (2005). "
1544,7," Indeed, these allegations suggest that the ""funneling"" of FastTrack users from StreamCast/Morpheus to Sharman 
Networks/Kazaa actually enhanced consumers' file-sharing experiences."
1544,8," The fact that the Sharman Networks/Kazaa FastTrack software may have contained some 'negative"" features such as 
""adware"" and ""spyware"" does not alter the Court's analysis, as consumers remained free to patronize other P2P providers 
 [**27] and networks, including the relaunched Morpheus/Gnutella network, to obtain the same ultimate results. That they 
continued to prefer FastTrack over other ""brands"" does not indicate that the market was not functioning competitively. See, e.g., 
Wallace v. IBM, 467 F.3d 1104, 1107 (7th Cir. 2006) (""HN12[
] When monopoly does not ensue, low prices remain--and the 
goal of antitrust law is to use rivalry to keep prices low for consumers' benefit.""). "
1545,9," Because a lack of ""antitrust injury"" is fatal to both of StreamCast's Sherman Act claims, the Court does not consider 
Defendants' additional arguments and requests for judicial notice of evidence regarding Defendants' lack of market power and/or 
market share. "
1551,1," Now known as Sol Puerto Rico Limited, but identified as Shell throughout this Opinion and Order."
1551,2," The relevant facts are taken from Shell's statement of material facts (Docket No. 134) because LFSS did not submit an 
opposing statement of material facts. See Local Civ. Rule 56(e) (HN1[
] ""Facts contained in a supporting or opposing 
statement of material facts, if supported by record citations . . . , shall be deemed admitted  [**3] unless properly controverted""); 
Morales v. A.C. Orssleff's EFTF, 246 F.3d 32, 33 (1st Cir. 2001) (""We have recently reiterated, with reference to this particular 
rule, that 'parties ignore [it] at their own peril,' and that HN2[
] 'failure to present a statement of disputed facts, embroidered 
with specific citations to the record, justifies deeming the facts presented in the movant's statement of undisputed facts 
admitted.'""). "
1554,3," In a motion for summary judgment that it filed on January 3, 2007 (Docket No. 163), and which the Court struck from the record 
because it was filed untimely, LFSS expanded on arguments that Shell sold gasoline at lower products to another retailer which 
is located only a few miles away. LFSS did not, however, offer evidence that it is in actual competition with that retailer, except 
for an expert's deposition testimony that he thought both service stations should have been included in the same price zone, not 
because they were in actual competition, but because the same non-Shell service station was used as the basis to set the prices 
at which they could sell gasoline. This argument is still insufficient evidence to establish actual competition,  [**13] and would 
have fared no better had the Court actually considered the stricken motion."
1554,4," FTC v. Morton Salt Co., 334 U.S. 37, 68 S. Ct. 822, 92 L. Ed. 1196, 44 F.T.C. 1499 (1948). "
1555,5," The Court notes that LFSS has submitted no economic evidence whatsoever to compare its sales and profits before and during 
the CAP. "
1566,1," HN5[
] To prove a claim of monopolization under Sherman Act § 2, a plaintiff must prove that the defendants: (1) possessed monopoly power in the relevant market; (2) willfully acquired or maintained that power; and (3) antitrust injury. Image Technical 
Services, Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 125 F.3d 1195, 1202 (9th Cir. 1997). Because willful acquisition or maintenance of 
monopoly power for purposes of monopolization requires proof that defendant engaged in predatory conduct, proof of such 
conduct is an element common to both monopolization and attempted monopolization under the Sherman Act § 2. "
1567,2," On November 17, 2006, NCI lodged an ex parte application to strike certain evidence submitted in BSL's Reply. After reviewing 
the papers submitted by the parties, the Court is inclined to find that NCI has not proven how it is prejudiced by the papers filed 
by BSL in its Reply. Accordingly, the Court denies the ex parte application for insufficient good cause shown."
1567,3," HN11[
] Section 1 of the Sherman Act states in relevant part: ""Every contract, combination . . ., or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce . . . is hereby declared to be illegal."" 15 U.S.C. § 1. "
1570,4," Moreover, the two casting directors identified by McGraw stated that they had never made such a statement, and had never 
been ""cut off"" by BSL. (De Lancy Decl. P 4; Belshe Dep. 12:13-25; 13:1-25; 14:1-22.) "
1571,5," BSL correctly notes that this specific claim was not alleged as a basis for antitrust liability in NCI's counterclaim and relates to 
events that transpired after the counterclaim was filed. (Reply 16.)"
1571,6," BSL only addressed the ""predatory conduct"" element of the § 2 claim in its motion; thus, NCI was not required to address the 
other elements of the claim in its opposition. USA Petroleum Co. v. ARCO, 972 F.2d 1070, 1074 (9th Cir. 1992)"
1571,7," The Court recognizes that the Matsushita test requiring that circumstantial evidence tend to exclude the possibility of 
independent action does not apply to a section 2 claim. Marsann Co. v. Brammall, Inc., 788 F.2d 611, 613 n.2 (9th Cir. 1986). "
1572,," Nonetheless, NCI still must present more than ""colorable"" evidence of predatory conduct to survive summary judgment. As the 
bulk of NCI's evidence is inadmissible or non-probative, NCI has failed to meet its burden."
1572,8," NCI concedes that its ""sham litigation"" argument applies only to its § 2 claim. (Opp. 31:26-28.)"
1572,9," Greenstein does not recall writing this e-mail. (Greenstein Decl. P 6.) He does recall that his office worked with BSL on the 
""Just a Phase"" breakdown. (Id. P 4.)"
1572,10," NCI makes this contention in spite of LaFond's deposition testimony that he had no record of receiving the breakdown or 
casting notice from the casting director. (LaFond Dep. 47:5-12, 48:1-24.)"
1572,11," This is not to say that BSL's copyright is unquestionably valid; the invalidity of the copyright is a defense that NCI may raise in 
defending against BSL's infringement claim. However, the omission of information on a copyright form, absent other evidence of 
bad faith intent, does not by itself give rise to an inference of antitrust liability. "
1586,1," In addition to their claims under the Robinson-Patman Act, plaintiffs brought claims against defendants under the Sherman Act, 
15 U.S.C. § i. While this litigation was pending before Judge Charles P. Kocoras of the United States District Court for the 
Northern District of Illinois, the Court entered Pretrial Order Number 5, which, among other things, bifurcated discovery of the 
two claims and ""contemplate[d] that … plaintiffs' claims may be tried in two separate trials."" (Declaration of Robert Grass "
1587,," executed on January 21, 2005 Ex. 1). This Court severed the Sherman Act claims from the Robinson-Patman Act claims. In 
November 2004, the parties agreed to settle the Sherman Act claims shortly before trial was scheduled to commence. At that 
time, fifteen of the defendant manufacturers settled both plaintiffs' Sherman Act and Robinson-Patman Act claims. Pretrial Order Number 5 stayed the Robinson-Patman Act claims asserted against all non-designated defendants until the first 
Robinson-Patman Act trial involving designated parties is completed. Pursuant to the pretrial order, the parties designated 
seventeen plaintiffs to proceed against five defendants. Two of the designated defendants -- Ciba Geigy and Searle -- remain, 
as the others have settled with plaintiffs. For the sake of simplicity, references in this opinion to ""plaintiffs"" and ""defendants"" are 
to the designated plaintiffs and designated defendants."
1587,2," In addition to their section 2(a) claims, the representative plaintiffs assert claims under sections 2(d) and 2(f) of the Act. See 15 
U.S.C. §§ 13(d), 13(f)."
1587,3, All references to 56.1 Statements and Declarations pertain to the submissions made with or in opposition to each motion.
1587,4," It appears that plaintiffs acquired almost all of their BNPDs directly from wholesalers -- a chain of distribution separate from the 
passage of rebate benefits. See Defs. Rep. 56.1 Stmt. P 12. It has been noted in earlier stages of this litigation saga that 
between 10% and 20% of the BNPDs were obtained directly from the manufacturers. See Drug Mart Pharmacy Corp. v. Am. 
Home Prods. Corp., No. 93-5148, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19954, 2002 WL 31528625, *3 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 21, 2002) (citing Def. SJ 
Mem. at 3). Depositions of many of the plaintiff pharmacists include testimony that on occasion they bought BNPDs directly from 
manufacturers, although that practice was more or less discontinued in the early to middle 1990s. See, e.g., Aff X 24 (Weaver) 
PP 2-4; Aff. X 25 (Weiss) PP 6-8; Aff. X 20 (Tootle) PP 2-5. There is no assertion, however, that they were ever participants in a 
rebate program. Since the Court holds plaintiffs' indirect purchaser argument survives summary judgment, for the purposes of 
this motion, there is no need to determine whether plaintiffs acquired BNPDs directly from a manufacturer or indirectly via their 
wholesalers. "
1590,5," Section 2(a) states in relevant part as follows: HN7[
] ""It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course 
of such commerce, either directly or indirectly, to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade 
and quality, where either or any of the purchases involved in such discrimination are in commerce, where such commodities are 
sold for use, consumption, or resale within the United States or any Territory thereof or the District of Columbia or any insular 
possession or other place under the jurisdiction of the United States, and where the effect of such discrimination may be 
substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent 
competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of 
either of them……  15 U.S.C. § 13(a). "
1592,6," The defendants' complaint primarily addresses the section 2(a) claims, although they also argue against 2(d). See Def. Mem. 
Law 13. HN9[
] Section 2(d) makes it unlawful: [F]or any person engaged in commerce to pay or contract for the payment of anything of value to or for the benefit of a 
customer of such person in the course of such commerce as compensation or in consideration for any service or facilities 
furnished by or through such customer in connection with the processing, handling, sale, or offering for sale of any products 
or commodities manufactured, sold, or offered for sale by such person, unless such payment or consideration is available 
on proportionally equal terms to all customers competing in the distribution of such products or commodities."
1592,15," U.S.C. § 13(d). Defendants contend that their argument that there is no competition means there is no violation of 2(d) either. Since the basis for 
their challenge is the same, this discussion applies with equal force to both the 2(a) and 2(d) claims."
1592,7," Section 2(f) claims were also filed against defendants Caremark, Medco, and Thrift Drug d/b/a Express Pharmacy Services, 
defendants who owned mail-order pharmacies and are not currently before the Court."
1592,8," Although plaintiffs superficially dispute the relevance of many of defendants' Rule 56.1 statements of fact, see, e.g., Pls. 56.1 
Rep. Stmt. PP 4, 6, 13, these arguments are undercut by the plaintiffs' own expert witness, whose description of SM-HMOs 
accords with that proposed by defendants. See Mincy Aff. PP 50-61. In this regard, the facial dispute over the basic structure of 
SM-HMOs presented by the 56.1 statements appears semantic rather than substantive. "
1593,9," The parties do not agree on who would be a ""subscriber"" under the Act. Plaintiffs appear to argue that subscribers include only 
those individuals who are members of a particular SM-HMO, and do not include the insureds of third-party payors which have 
contracted with the SM-HMO for pharmacy benefits. See Pls. Mem. 7-9. Defendants appear to group the above categories 
together. See Defs. Rep. 10."
1593,10," Defendants introduce evidence to substantiate their assertion that there is no genuine issue of material fact. They admit that 
SM-HMOs purchase BNPDs, but produce evidence in the form of contracts with manufacturers promising that the BNPDs will 
only be dispensed to members of the plan. See, e.g., Driscoll Decl., ""Mattox Dep."" Ex. 9 (Contract between Ciba and Cigna) Tab 
A-2, CG00000790."
1593,11," With respect to the defendant Searle only, plaintiffs contend that its agreements with SM-HMOs provide no limit on the 
purchasers' resale rights, thus permitting them to resell BNPDs, regardless of the subscriber status of the end user. Because the 
Court denies the motion with respect to both defendants on other grounds, it does not consider the significance of this assertion. "
1594,12," The consolidated complaints against which the defendants now move assert claims under §§ 2(a) and 2(d) of the Robinson-
Patman Act as amended, 15 U.S.C. § 13. In this motion, the parties focus on the § 2(a) claims. Since the structural elements of 
a § 2(d) claim are essentially the same as those under § 2(a), the Court's discussion will apply with equal force to both."
1594,13, Discussion of the damages element of the claim is reserved for the Court's analysis of the damages motion. 
1596,14," The simile relationship is important because courts appear hesitant to employ this second-order use of ""buyer"" in blanket 
fashion across all of antitrust law. In Kartell, for example, the Court explicitly limited the finding that Blue Shield was a buyer 
under the antitrust laws to the application before it. See Kartell, 749 F.2d at 926. "
1597,15," The parties cite to cases in this area, but no claim under the Act is made under this motion. See, e.g., Group Life & Health Ins. 
Co. v. Royal Drug Co., 440 U.S. 205, 232, 99 S. Ct. 1067, 59 L. Ed. 2d 261 (1979); Klamath-Lake Pharm. Assoc. v. Klamath 
Med. Serv. Bureau. 701 F.2d 1276 (9th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 822, 104 S. Ct. 88, 78 L. Ed. 2d 96 (1983)."
1597,16," Two other purchasers of gasoline, Swift and Uneeda, were also discussed in the opinion, but defendants' argument is largely 
based on the analogy to Metropolitan. See Def. Mem. 9-11. "
1598,17," The Court does not examine the question of liability exemptions for subscribers under any theory other than those proposed 
here, which it rejects."
1598,18," By ""walk-in"" customers, plaintiffs mean ""both cash-paying and members of other insurance plans."" Pls. Mem. 3. By ""cash-
paying"" customers, plaintiffs appear to refer to those customers who are neither members of the SM-HMO from which they 
acquire the drugs nor subscribers to a third-party payor plan. By members of other insurance companies, plaintiffs appear to be 
referring to individuals that have insurance from elsewhere which may or may not include a prescription benefit program run 
through the SM-HMO, but nevertheless acquire drugs through the HMO."
1598,19,"  Q: (By Mr. Armstrong) would any of -- would you compete for the filling of the prescription of a Sanus member with another 
retail pharmacy? A: Yes. "
1599,," Q: Would you compete with another retail pharmacy for the filling of an Aetna member? A: Yes. Q: Would you compete with another retail pharmacy for the filling of a Blue Cross Blue Shield member? A: Yes. Q: Would your testimony be the same for all the other third-party groups? A: Yes. Q: Can a Sanus member who has elected to have medical benefits provided by a physician outside the Kelsey-Seybold 
network have his prescription filled from a Kelsey-Seybold clinic? A: Yes. Glassman Decl., Dep. X 28 (Ramirez Dep.) 249:24-250:19."
1599,20," Unfortunately, the parties' briefs are not entirely consistent on the difference between PBMs and TPPs, to the extent there is 
one. At times, the PBM is described as the agent of the TPP, because it makes the agreement with the manufacturer for the 
benefit of the TPP's consumers (the ""insured""). At other times, the terms seem to be used interchangeably (compare 56.1 Stmt., "
1600,," P 12, with id. at P 14). The confusion seems to arise from the parties' attempts at simplifying for trial a multitude of different 
organizational structures in the health care industry. Fortunately, the inconsistency does not hinder the resolution of this motion. 
For the limited purpose of deciding this motion, the Court will use the term ""PBM"" to refer to the pharmacy benefit managers 
subject to this motion, and ""TPP""as the institutional clients (including insurance companies) that contract with PBMs for 
pharmaceutical services, and which deal directly with consumers."
1600,21," The ordering of the agreements in this memorandum and order is analytic rather than chronological, intended only to outline 
the transactions at issue."
1600,22," The possibility of switching occurs when two BNPDs are considered ""therapeutic equivalents."" Thus, even though two BNPDs 
might otherwise be able to obtain lawful monopoly returns for their manufacturers, the buyers' ability to shift demand from one 
drug to the other forces the manufacturers to compete on price."
1600,23," It should be noted that plaintiffs dispute that the application of greater buying power forced defendants to enter into these 
agreements, because ""most health care entities maintained open or recommended formularies… [and] [r]etail pharmacists were 
able to override formulary restrictions by obtaining plan authorizations on behalf of their customers for BNPDs excluded from 
that plan's formularly."" Mincy Aff. 27-28. This evidence, however, does not directly contradict the apparent buying power of the 
PBMs and TPPs central to the economics at issue here. At most, the plaintiffs' expert indicates that some bargaining power 
remained with both manufacturers and retail pharmacies. "
1601,24," It appears that the rebate might be paid to the TPP or other entity, but for the purposes of this motion, the Court considers only 
those instances in which the PBM is paid some or all of the rebate."
1601,25," A ""formulary"" is a list of drugs with their uses and methods of use, and may include substitutes for the drug."
1601,26," Many of these services are also provided to the HMOs and plans that contracted to have the PBMs act as their buyers. See 
Defs. 56.1 Rep. Stmt. P 11."
1601,27," The parties have extensive disagreements over the amount of pressure exerted by PBMs against retail pharmacies to get 
them to comply with terms of the agreement, but this dispute is immaterial for the present motion. "
1603,28," Plaintiffs also argue that 80% of all PBMs do, in fact, take title to the goods, because they are affiliated with or own entities that 
undeniably do so. See Memorandum in Opposition to Designated Defendants' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to All 
Robinson-Patman Act Claims Based on Rebates Paid to Legal Entities that do not Take Title to, Resell or Dispense Brand Name 
Prescription Drugs (""Plt. Memo in Opp."") at 15. Setting aside the question of whether or not affiliation with a BNPD-purchasing 
company permits an inference of title-taking, it is clear that this argument carries no weight in the stand-alone context, where no 
such ties exist. Aggregate analysis of the industry is too general to sustain plaintiffs through summary judgment with respect to 
stand-alone PBMs."
1603,29," Interestingly, the phrase ""dominion and control"" is not used a single time in the Baim & Blank case. See Baim & Blank v. 
Philco Distributors, 148 F. Supp. 541 (E.D.N.Y. 1957). "
1604,30," Although the argument is not explicitly raised in the plaintiffs' briefs, the essence of their argument might be a claim of 
""constructive possession."" The sum of controls that plaintiffs allege do not constitute constructive possession. Moreover, a 
review of their analysis indicates something much more far-fetched. Namely, that by controlling consumer preference, one 
controls the product. That proves too much."
1604,31," Plaintiffs also cite to a series of Sherman Act cases in which insurers were found to be purchasers of medical services. See 
Pls. Mem. Law at 19-20 (citing Desiano v. Warner-Lambert Co., 326 F.3d 339 (2d Cir. 2003); Kartell v. Blue Shield of 
Massachusetts, 749 F.2d 922 (1st Cir. 1984); Westchester Radiological Assocs. v. Empire Blue Cross & Blue Shield, Inc., 707 F. 
Supp. 708 (S.D.N.Y. 1989), affd, 884 F.2d 707 (2d Cir. 1989)) (additional citations omitted). Throughout this Memorandum & 
Order these cases are referred to as the ""Kartell"" cases. For the reasons stated supra SM-HMO Motion III.B.1. and infra Non-
Purchaser Rebates Motion II.B.2.b. for rejecting the applicability of this line of cases the Court also rejects their application here."
1604,32," The Court in Loren Speciality relies on analysis in Mathews Conveyer Co. v. Palmer-Bee Co., 135 F.2d 73, 81 (6th Cir. 1943) 
to list the relevant factors for separating agency from sale transactions: "
1605,," From a consideration of the evidence and a review of the foregoing cases, we arrive at the conclusion that the contract was 
one of sale and not of agency. The products were bought outright from plaintiff by defendant. The latter dealt directly with 
its own customers in securing orders and in delivering and installing the equipment. It billed such customers in its own 
name, assumed all credit risks for payment, and, having obtained full title to the goods, exercised complete control over 
them, including installation and erection, as well as assuming all liability incidental thereto. It engaged on its own behalf in 
procuring business for plaintiffs products and carried on its own business for itself, and not for plaintiff. Id. at 81."
1605,33," Defendants urge the Court to treat these agreements as nothing more nor less than a consignment or agency relationship. 
See Defs. Mot. at 6. Jurisprudence under the Act has not considered consignments to be sales. See 3 Kintner and Bauer, 
Federal Antitrust Law 198-202 (1983). The Court's decision here does not reach so far as to make a determinative finding as to 
whether or not these agreements, as a matter of law, are ""consignments."" Today's decision is grounded in the lack of a showing 
of a ""purchaser"" under these agreements, combined with the fact that two totally unaffiliated legal entities cannot be considered 
a single-entity under antitrust analysis -- a matter discussed in the second half of this opinion. Should the issue become relevant 
in subsequent litigation, the Court will revisit it. "
1606,34," The plaintiffs do contend that retail pharmacies face competition from health care plans which do not own and operate in-
house or mail-order pharmacies. See Pls. Memo in Opp. at 28. This contention is unsubstantiated by the Mincy Affidavit referred 
to. It states: ""Health plans, and other third-party payors, also vigorously compete with retail pharmacies for BNPD customers. 
These health plans often designed their prescription drug benefit plans so that their members (BNPD customers) are either 
exclusively required to use, or given a financial incentive to use, the in-house or mail order pharmacy owned by or contracted 
with the health plan."" Mincy Aff. P 182. The gist of the contention, like the vast majority of the plaintiffs' arguments on 
competition, deal with PBMs that are either affiliated with or in an ownership relationship with a pharmacy. Whatever ""issue"" 
might be raised by the phrase ""contracted with"" in the Mincy Affidavit, it is not sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact 
with respect to stand alone PBMs. As discussed above, the affiliated PBMs present the problem of whether or not the 
companies are in fact a single entity, making the plaintiffs' evidence here potentially relevant in the affiliated PBM context. See 
supra, pp. 32-7. "
1607,35, The detailed discussion of Kartell is located supra SM-HMO Motion III.B.1.
1607,36," Defendants do identify several PBMs which they assert are ""affiliated"" with BNPD resellers, but move for summary judgment 
with respect to all affiliated PBMs as a class. See Def. Rep. Mem. at 11. "
1609,37," As noted in Copperweld: At least when a subsidiary is wholly owned, however, these factors are not sufficient to describe a separate economic entity 
for purposes of the Sherman Act. The factors simply describe the manner in which the parent chooses to structure a 
subunit of itself. They cannot overcome the basic fact that the ultimate interests of the subsidiary and the parent are 
identical, so the parent and the subsidiary must be viewed as a single economic unit. Copperweld, 467 U.S. at 772, n.18 (emphasis added)."
1609,38," In mid-July, 2005, over a month and a half after oral argument, and several months after the briefing schedule, plaintiffs 
submitted a sur-reply brief that was not requested by the Court but briefed the issues discussed here. Rule W.B of the Individual 
Rules of this Court states that ""sur-reply papers shall not be filed or considered."" Individual Rules of Senior Judge I. Leo Glasser, 
March 22, 2006. Shortly thereafter, defendants requested that the Court ignore the arguments not raised in plaintiffs' timely 
response papers, or, in the alternative permit defendants to file a sur-reply addressing the relevant issues. "
1610,39," There are, of course, several statutory defenses available to defendants, which have yet to be raised and are not considered 
here. See 15 U.S.C. § 13. "
1611,40," To the extent that plaintiffs' argument is an assertion of a lack of ""antitrust injury"" entitling them to damages under § 4 of the 
Clayton Act, it is discussed in the Court's Memorandum and Order on ""Defendants Motion for Summary Judgment on the 
Ground that Plaintiffs have not Shown That They are Entitled to Damages Under the Act."""
1611,41," For this reason, the parties' arguments regarding whether, and to what extent, the plaintiffs may supplement the 1995 Expert 
Report are not relevant to the issues presented by defendants' motion because plaintiffs do not have the right to introduce new 
damages theories, but rather are limited to ""freshening"" their damages data. "
1612,42," Under the Robinson-Patman Act, a prevailing plaintiff maybe entitled to monetary damages, injunctive relief and/or a 
declaratory judgment. See generally John B. Hull, Inc. v. Waterbury Petroleum Prods., Inc., 588 F.2d 24, 27 (2d Cir. 1978), cert. 
denied, 440 U.S. 960, 99 S. Ct. 1502, 59 L. Ed. 2d 773 (1979). In this case, plaintiffs seek only monetary damages. "
1613,43," In a secondary-line price discrimination case, the favored purchaser has an advantage over its competitors who pay more for 
goods of like kind because the competitor can more easily lower its resale price, incur more business expenses, or make a 
greater profit to facilitate expansion. The Robinson-Patman Act was designed to limit the availability of price differentials to 
situations where there are adequate and objective economic justifications. See Earl W. Kintner and Joseph P. Bauer, Federal 
Antitrust Law, Vol. III, 295-6 (1983)."
1613,44," HN31[
] ""Antitrust injury"" compels plaintiffs to show that they were in fact injured by the price discrimination, that the injury is 
of the type the Act was intended to prevent, and that the injury is causally connected with the violation of the Act. Brunswick 
Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 489, 97 S. Ct. 690, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977). "

temporarily or permanently enjoined, or otherwise prohibited."" "
1649,1," The Court denies the parties' requests for judicial notice because the documents contained therein were not necessary to the 
determination of the motions to dismiss. "
1655,2," PMSNA summarily argues that ""because [Counter-Claimant's] fraud claims fail, any claim for rescission fails as well."" (PMSNA 
Mot. at 15.) Because the Court denies PMSNA's motion as to the fraud claims, the Court thus denies its motion as to the 
rescission claim as well. "
1656,3," PMSNA moved to dismiss Counter-Claimant's 17200 claim on different grounds, i.e., that Counter-Claimants failed to allege an 
""injury in fact"" or that they are entitled to a remedy against PMSNA. Counter-Claimants failed to respond to these arguments. 
Nevertheless, because the Court finds that Counter-Claimant's failed to allege a 17200 claim for the reason stated above, the 
Court need to not address whether this claim fails for the additional reasons argued by PMSNA. "
1665,1," Specialty Construction Brands supplies its distributors with tile installation products bearing the brand name ""TEC."""
1665,2, Mortar is a strong adhesive in which a tile is set; grout is used to fill in the spaces between tiles. 
1666,3," Miles's markups were as follows: pallet pricing (the largest volume) was 18.5, wholesale volume was 27, and wholesale was 
45. Miles introduced pallet pricing in 2003. "
1667,4, Louisville Tile agreed to replace 50 of its volume at the Chattanooga store with TEC products within nine months. 
1668,5," According to Miles, its promotional strategies included training its sales people and its customers on the use of TEC product, 
promoting TEC through advertisements and brochures, and supporting TEC products in all of its locations. Miles representatives 
also accompanied TEC representatives on visits to customers and introduced customers to new TEC products. "
1669,6," HN5[
] Horizontal restraints that are per se illegal usually involve boycotts by a group of competitors against a joint supplier in 
order to disadvantage another competitor."
1669,7," The characterization of the offense as a horizontal conspiracy, given that it is a lawsuit between a supplier and a distributor, 
might strike some as odd. Although the sole defendant in this case is a supplier, the alleged boycott also includes retailers, i.e., 
conspirators at different levels of distribution. Miles notes that a facially vertical restraint imposed by a manufacturer can be 
horizontal if caused by a ""horizontal cartel"" among distributors, citing Business Electronics, 485 U.S. at 730, n. 4 (""HN6[
] A 
restraint is horizontal not because it has horizontal effects, but because it is a product of a horizontal agreement.""). Though the 
idea that an apparent vertical restraint may in fact be horizontal comes from dicta that the Supreme Court relegated to a 
footnote, at least one circuit has followed that dicta. See Rossi v. Standard Roofing, Inc., 156 F.3d 452, 462 (3d Cir. 1998) 
(classifying a restraint as horizontal where a number of competitor firms agreed with each other and at least one of their 
common suppliers to eliminate their price-cutting competition by cutting its access to supplies). We therefore assume, without 
deciding the issue, that Miles may classify the alleged conspiracy as horizontal. Oddly, though, Miles does not name its 
competitors as defendants. "
1677,1," Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment and an injunction to enjoin enforcement of the statutes. Plaintiff sues for itself and 
similarly situated tobacco importers and non-participating manufacturers. Because the Court finds that defendant is entitled to 
summary judgment on plaintiff's claims, it does not address the class action aspects of the case. "
1678,2," The Court omits many of plaintiff's facts because they are not proper under Rule 56, Fed. R. Civ. P.; they are legal conclusions, 
argument, unsupported by the record, inadmissible hearsay and/or immaterial."
1678,3," The District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, four United States territories and 46 states (including Kansas) signed the MSA."
1678,4," The MSA restricted advertising and marketing of OPM tobacco products and required the OPMs to contribute more than $ 1.5 
billion to fund a foundation to reduce youth smoking and educate the public about smoking-related illnesses. See MSA § III, IV, 
and VI."
1678,5," If the actual volume is less than the base volume, the payment is 2 per cent of the base amount plus 98 per cent of the per 
cigarette amount times the actual volume. Because 2 per cent of the payment does not vary with volume, the OPM obligation 
declines slightly less than proportionally with volume, and the per-cigarette payment increases slightly as volume decreases. If 
the OPMs' actual volume exceeds the base volume, the per-cigarette rate equals exactly this amount."
1678,6," One condition is that the SPM sells less than its ""grandfathered market share,"" defined as 125 per cent of its 1997 share or 100 
per cent of its 1998 share."
1678,7," In its fact number 23, plaintiff incorrectly claims that SPM payments are larger than OPM payments because the formula for the 
SPM payments involves dividing the SPM market share by the aggregate OPM market share, whereas the OPM formula 
involves dividing by a ""larger denominator."" See Declaration of Jonathan Gruber at 9-10. Plaintiff asserts that the Court cannot 
rely upon Gruber's declaration because (1) Gruber is not competent to provide an opinion on antitrust restraints; (2) his ""factual 
statements"" are actually conclusions of law; and/or (3) his opinions are based on factual errors or inadmissible hearsay. Gruber's declaration states that he is a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a Research 
Associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research (Director of the Program on the Economics of Children). Gruber served "
1679,," as Deputy Assistant Secretary For Economic Policy in the United States Treasury Department, where he worked on a legislative 
initiative to formulate comprehensive tobacco regulation. Congress did not enact the proposed legislation, but the MSA 
incorporated the initiative. Gruber served as an expert for the Department of Justice and testified as an expert witness in a case 
challenging the MSA on antitrust grounds, see XCaliber Int'l Ltd. v. Edmondson, No. 04-CV-9022, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26705, 
(N.D. Okla May 20, 2005). He also made declarations in two other tobacco-related cases. Gruber is clearly qualified to testify as 
an expert in this case. See Daubert v. Merrill Dow Pharm., 509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1993). The Court 
is capable of screening his factual statements from any legal conclusions, and disregarding any inadmissible hearsay, and it 
trusts that plaintiff will rectify any factual errors through contrary evidence which establishes a genuine issue of material fact."
1679,8," Payments to escrow funds are not deductible for federal income tax purposes. At oral argument, plaintiff's counsel explained 
that escrow payments are not treated as business expenses which can be deducted under the Internal Revenue Code because 
the escrow payments are returned to the NPM unless the NPM is unable to pay a future judgment for tobacco-related health 
care costs."
1679,9," Before the amendment, the Kansas statute provided that if an NPM established that its payments were greater than the State's 
""allocable share of the payments that it would have been required to make in that year under the master settlement agreement . 
. . had it been a participating manufacturer,"" the NPM was entitled to an immediate release of its over-payment. See K.S.A. 50-
6a03(b)(2)(B) (before 2005 amendment). "
1680,10," The NPMs sharply increased their share of the domestic market from 1.6 per cent in 1999 to 8.1 percent in 2003. OPM 
operating incomes declined substantially in 2003, but with the repeals of the allocable share release starting in 2003, their 
operating incomes increased. In the spring of 2004, Phillip Morris (the largest OPM) and Liggett (the largest SPM) attributed the 
increase of their gross profit margins to the widespread enactment of the ASR Repealers. PXs 125, 126."
1680,11," The NAAG advised the settling states to enact these model Contraband Statutes promptly or receive lower MSA payments 
due to increased Volume Adjustments and substantial NPM Downward Adjustments. PX 21. The Volume Adjustment is 
determined by comparing the number of cigarettes sold nationally by OPMs in a given year with the number sold in the base 
year of 1997. The resulting percentage reduces the base payment to the states by the PMs. The NPM Downward Adjustment 
can reduce a settling state's share of the MSA payments if PMs have lost market share due to participation in the MSA and the 
state did not diligently enforce escrow payments by NPMs."
1680,12," Before the contraband statutes, the states did not have a mechanism to enforce the escrow statute. "
1681,13," In its reply, defendant also asserts that issue preclusion bars plaintiff's antitrust claim. Defendant asserts that in Arkansas, 
plaintiff litigated and lost an identical antitrust preemption challenge to the amended Escrow Statute and Certification Statute. 
See Int'l Tobacco Partners, Ltd. v. Beebe, 420 F. Supp.2d 989 (W.D. Ark. 2006). Defendant asserts that Arkansas statutes at 
issue in Beebe were substantially identical to the statutes which plaintiff challenges in this case. On March 6, 2006, after 
defendant filed its motion to dismiss or for summary judgment in this case, the United States District Court for the Western 
District of Arkansas granted defendant's motion to dismiss, except to the extent that the complaint challenged any retroactive 
application of the Escrow Statute to escrow due on sales made in the year before the passage of the amendment. Defendant 
asserts that plaintiff should be precluded from relitigating in this forum the issues decided in that case. See SIL-FLO, Inc. v. 
SFHC, Inc., 917 F.2d 1507, 1520 (10th Cir. 1990) (once court has decided issue necessary to judgment, decision may preclude 
relitigation in a suit on different cause of action involving party to first case). Because the Court disposes of plaintiff's antitrust 
claim on the merits, it need not reach the question of issue preclusion. "
1682,14," Plaintiff does not address the fact that SPMs make actual payments to the states, while NPMs merely place funds in escrow 
and may be entitled to recover them."
1682,15," Where plaintiff establishes a hybrid restraint, action which violates the Sherman Act may still be entitled to state action 
immunity if a ""clearly articulated"" state policy is ""actively supervised"" by the state. Ca. Retail Liquor Dealers Ass'n v. Midcal "
1683,," Aluminum, Inc., 445 U.S. 97, 100 S. Ct. 937, 63 L. Ed. 2d 233 (1980). In Freedom Holdings, Inc. v. Spitzer, 357 F.3d 205 (2d 
Cir. 2004), plaintiff alleged that the MSA statutory scheme constituted a hybrid restraint and that the state did not adequately 
supervise the regulatory scheme. The district court sustained defendant's motion to dismiss but the Second Circuit reversed that 
ruling because plaintiff alleged that state did not actively supervise the state policy. Id. at 232. In this case, plaintiff also alleges that defendant does not actively supervise the conduct by the PMs and that the challenged 
statutes are therefore not entitled to state action immunity. Defendant argues that plaintiff has not demonstrated an antitrust 
violation, and that the immunity analysis is therefore unnecessary. As set forth in the discussion that follows, the Court agrees."
1683,16," Freedom Holdings, 357 at 220 (overruling motion to dismiss because plaintiff alleged hybrid restraint and state did not 
adequately supervise)."
1683,17," The court in Edmonson also addressed plaintiff's argument that the purpose, and perhaps even the effect, of the Allocable 
Share Amendment was to protect the market share of PMs and drive NPMs out of business, rather than to advance the public 
health and safety goals contemplated by the MSA. It rejected that argument as a matter of law, as follows: [A] a state's unstated motive in enacting legislation is irrelevant. See City of Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Advertising, Inc., 
499 U.S. 365, 379, 111 S. Ct. 1344, 113 L. Ed. 2d 382 (1991) (rejecting an interpretation of the Sherman Act ""that would 
allow Plaintiffs to look behind the actions of state sovereigns to base their claims on 'perceived conspiracies to restrain "
1684,," trade'""); Hoover v. Ronwin, 466 U.S. 558, 580, 104 S. Ct. 1989, 80 L. Ed. 2d 590 (1984) (state action is ""exempt from 
antitrust liability regardless of the State's motives in taking the action""). As long as the conduct causing anticompetitive 
effect is unilateral state action, taken under that state's police powers, as discussed above, it is protected from preemption 
by the state action doctrine."
1684,2005," U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26705, at *19."
1684,18," In Grand River, the Second Circuit noted that in Freedom Holdings it had rejected an extraterritorial-effect claim which 
challenged the New York Contraband Statute. The Second Circuit distinguished Freedom Holdings, however, noting that in that 
case plaintiffs claimed that the Contraband Statute fostered artificially high prices in New York, which inflated the prices for sales 
wholly outside the State of New York. See Grand River, 425 F.3d at 171, citing Freedom Holdings, 357 F.3d at 220. In Freedom 
Holdings the Second Circuit found that ""[t]he extraterritorial effect described by appellants amounts to no more than the 
upstream pricing impact of a state regulation,"" id., and that plaintiffs had not alleged that interstate regulatory gridlock would 
occur if many states -- or even every state -- adopted similar legislation. "
1685,19," Under Rule 12(b)(6), Fed. R. Civ. P., the district court in Grand River initially dismissed both the Commerce Clause and the 
antitrust claims. Subsequently, in Freedom Holdings, 357 F.3d at 226-33, the Second Circuit held that the New York Contraband 
Statutes were subject to federal antitrust laws and rejected defendant's argument that the state-action immunity doctrine barred 
plaintiff's antitrust claim. The district court in Grand River then reinstated the Sherman Act claim, and the Second Circuit 
reversed its dismissal of the Commerce Clause Claim."
1685,20," Plaintiff does not explain why this conclusion (PMs want to raise prices nationwide without losing market share) follows from 
its premise (payments to the settling states correspond to nationwide sales by PMs). Furthermore, plaintiff does not explain why 
-- independent of the challenged legislation -- PMs would not seek to maximize both profit and market share."
1685,21," As a result of the ASR Repealer, a portion of the escrow funds may be released earlier under the following circumstance: To the extent that a tobacco product manufacturer establishes that the amount it was required to place into escrow on 
account of units sold in the state in a particular year was greater than the Master Settlement Agreement payments, as 
determined pursuant to section IX(i) of that agreement, including after final determination of all adjustments, that such 
manufacturer would have been required to take on account of such units sold had it been a participating manufacturer, the 
excess shall be released from escrow and revert back to such tobacco product manufacturer."
1685,2005, Kan. Sess. Laws 178. 
1686,22," Potential adjustments are set forth in Section IX(i)(3) of the MSA. These adjustments include an NPM adjustment, which would 
reduce the effective amount of an SPM's payment obligation for a particular year. Such adjustments depend solely on the 
number of cigarettes sold in a particular state, and do not depend on national market share."
1686,23," Defendant argues that the analysis does not change if conditions result in an adjustment which reduces the NPM's 
hypothetical payment had it been an SPM. Those potential adjustments are set forth in Section IX(i)(3) of the MSA. Although 
each is again subject to complicated formulas set forth elsewhere in the MSA, none depends on an SPM's national market 
share. In fact, none of these adjustments has ever been applied for any period during which the release calculation has been 
governed by the current version of the Escrow Statute. Should the conditions precedent to one or more adjustments be met in 
the future -- for example, should there be an NPM adjustment which reduces the effective amount of an SPM's payment 
obligation for a particular year -- the effect would simply be to reduce the per-cigarette SPM payment amount. If the resulting 
per-cigarette amount turned out to be less than the per-cigarette amount an NPM originally paid into escrow on account of its 
Kansas sales, the NPM would be entitled to an early release under K.S.A. § 50-6a03(b)(2)(B), but the amount would again 
depend solely on the number of cigarettes sold in Kansas times the new per-cigarette amount. The prices at which the NPM sold 
its cigarettes in other States would not affect the NPM's per-cigarette payment in Kansas. "
