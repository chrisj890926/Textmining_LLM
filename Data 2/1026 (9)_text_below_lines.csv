26,*," The Honorable Timothy M. Burgess, District Court Judge for the District of Alaska, sitting by designation."
26,1," General Electric Corporation (""GE"") bought and enforced some flexed IKON contracts and is included as a Defendant for its 
role in the allegedly anti-competitive scheme."
26,2," Because this case is an appeal from a dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), we accept as true all facts alleged in the 
complaint, and we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of Plaintiffs-Appellants, Newcal. "
27,3," Newcal brings four of its six antitrust claims under HN2[
] Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1, which governs restraints of trade and tying, and it brings the remaining two claims under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2, which 
governs monopolization and attempted monopolization. The ""relevant market"" and ""market power"" requirements apply identically 
under the two different sections of the Act, meaning that the requirements apply identically to all six of Newcal's claims. Compare 
Rebel Oil Co., Inc. v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 51 F.3d 1421, 1444 (9th Cir. 1995) (restraint of trade), with Datagate, Inc. v. Hewlett-
Packard Co., 60 F.3d 1421, 1423-24 (9th Cir. 1995) (tying), and with Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Services, Inc., 504 
U.S. 451, 481, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1992) (monopolization). For purposes of this opinion, therefore, there is no 
need to distinguish or differentiate among Newcal's various  [**6] claims; its market allegations are either sufficient or insufficient 
for all six claims."
27,4," HN4[
] Antitrust law requires allegation of both a product market and a geographic market. Newcal alleges a geographic market of the United States, and IKON does not challenge that allegation. The only question on appeal is whether Newcal 
alleged a legally viable product market. "
30,5," In Queens City Pizza, the primary product was the franchise agreement, and the secondary product was the pizza ingredients. 
In Forsyth, the primary product was the insurance contract, and the secondary product was the hospital care. In Eastman Kodak, 
the primary product was the durable equipment, and the secondary product was the service. "
33,6," IKON argues that Newcal waived all of its arguments except those directed at the district court's first conclusion by failing to 
argue those points before the district court in its opposition to the motion to dismiss. According to IKON, the only question that 
Newcal preserved for appeal is the question of whether statement (a) constitutes ""puffing."" We disagree.  [**31] There was 
sufficient argument in the opposition brief to preserve all of Newcal's arguments for review. "
41,1, Plaintiffs' Trial Exhibits # 1-29 are de bene esse depositions of fact witnesses and all were admitted as evidence at trial.
41,2," Unless otherwise indicated, all references to the transcript within the Findings of Fact section refer to the transcript of August 
13, 2007. "
51,3, Therese Coddington is also known as Teresa Coddington. 
67,4," The name ""Elvee"" is misspelled throughout the de bene esse deposition transcript as ""Eldee,"" perhaps because her son's 
middle name was Eldee. See, e.g., Pls.' Trial Ex. 20, Joyce Butler Dep. 6:8, July 11, 2007. The correct first name of James's 
mother is ""Elvee."" "
90,1, Excerpts from the WMC Bylaws and Medical Staff Bylaws are set forth in Appendix  [*25] A. 
128,1," For a detailed account of this case's extensive procedural history see the following opinions: 351 U.S. App. D.C. 223, 289 F.3d 
98 (D.C. Cir. 2002); March 30, 2005 Mem. Op. (""S.J. Mem. Op."") [Docket No. 785]; 295 F. Supp. 2d 30 (D.D.C. 2003);  [**2] 202 
F.R.D. 12 (D.D.C. 2001)."
128,2," The claims were brought under the antitrust laws of Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Illinois."
128,3," Lorazepam and Clorazepate are generic prescription anti-anxiety drugs (the generic equivalents of Ativan(R) and Tranxene(R), 
respectively). "
130,4," In Lorix, the plaintiff asserted respondents conspired to fix the price of rubber processing chemicals that are sold for and used 
in the manufacture of automobile tires. Lorix, 720 N.W.2d at 16. The plaintiff did not allege that she purchased any over-priced 
chemicals but that she purchased tires manufactured using the over-priced chemicals and the manufacturer passed the 
additional cost on to her. Id. The Appeals Court affirmed, finding the reach of section 325D.57 not so broad as to capture 
 [**9] plaintiff's claims because Lorix -- a mere purchaser of automobile tires -- was not a participant in the market constrained. 
Minn. Stat. § 325D.57 (2004), Lorix, 720 N.W.2d at 19. "
131,5," Plaintiffs also argue the award does not rise to a level that ""shocks the conscience"" and remittitur is therefore inappropriate. 
Opp'n 4-6. HN5[
] While it is true that an award may be reduced if it is excessive or shocks the conscience, that is not the only 
circumstance where remittitur may be appropriate, and it is not what Defendants argue here. Rather, Defendants argue that 
certain identifiable sums were impermissibly included and therefore should be excluded as a matter of law. "
133,6," In addition, Defendants argue the ratification process was inadequate because it did not meet the notice requirements in the 
class action context. Opp'n 8-9. Defendants' argument is misplaced. In this context, the ratification process is governed by Fed. 
R. Civ. P. 17(a) and not Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. As the Court held when it considered Defendants' challenge in 2005, ""the application 
of the Remedial provision of Rule 17(a) is appropriate here if the requirements of the rule are otherwise met."" April 25, 2005, 
Mem. Op. at 3. "
134,7," The statute reads in relevant part: HN8[
] ""[i]f the court finds for the petitioner, recovery shall be in the amount of actual 
damages or twenty-five dollars, whichever is greater; or up to three but not less than two times such amount if the court finds 
that the use or employment of the act or practice was a willful or knowing violation of said section two  [**24] or that the refusal 
to grant relief upon demand was made in bad faith with knowledge or reason to know that the act or practice complained of 
violated said section two."" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 9(3). "
135,8," Moreover, BCBS-MA argues that, because Defendants failed to respond to the demand letter, ""under Massachusetts law, they 
are responsible for treble, not double damages."" Id. at 17. BCBS-MA's characterization of the statute implies that a finding of bad 
faith shifts the damages award from double to treble damages. It does not. HN10[
] A finding of bad faith has the same effect 
as a willfulness finding. Specifically, such a finding shifts the damages award from compensatory to either double or treble 
damages.  [**26] Upon such a finding, whether to award double or treble damages is in the Court's discretion. "
137,9," Relying on Wang Labs., Inc. v. Bus. Incentives, Inc., 398 Mass. 854, 501 N.E.2d 1163, 1166-67 (Mass. 1986),  [**34] BCBS-
MA contends that the jury's willfulness finding compels the Court to award multiple damages. Pl's Mot. for Treble Damages 15. 
In Wang, the court found Defendant's actions were willful, and it then failed to impose double or treble damages. Id. The 
Supreme Judicial Court concluded that because the trial court made the requisite willfulness finding, multiple damages were 
demanded by operation of law. Id. It was not the case, as here, that the jury found Defendant's actions willful, but the court then 
failed to award multiple damages. In sum, HN13[
] while it is true that to avoid the imposition of multiple damages the Court 
would have to find the jury's willfulness finding without evidentiary basis--a high bar Defendants cannot meet--the Court is not 
compelled to award multiple damages based solely on the jury's finding. "
140,10," The statute reads: HN21[
] ""[T]he person injured shall recover the actual damages caused by the violation, together with 
costs and reasonable attorney's fees, and if it is shown that such violation was willful, the court may, in its discretion, increase 
the amount recovered as damages up to a total of 3 times the amount of actual damages."" 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 10/7(2). "
149,1," We use the term ""Commission"" to refer to the Commissioners at the Federal Trade Commission that decided this case at the 
final administrative level. Its opinion at issue on this appeal is Chicago Bridge & Iron Co., et al., 138 F.T.C. 1024, 2005 WL 
120878 (FTC), Docket No. 9300 (Jan. 6, 2005) (""Op.""). We use the term the ""Government"" to refer to complainant counsel 
executing the Federal Trade Commission's separate investigatory and enforcement functions. In other words, the ""Government"" 
brings a complaint before the ""Commission"" for adjudication. See 16 C.F.R. §§ 3.2, 3.11; see also Genuine Parts Co. v. FTC, 
445 F.2d 1382, 1388 (5th Cir. 1971)."
149,2," On August 29, 2000, CB&I and PDM entered into a letter of intent for CB&I to acquire the assets from PDM. On September 12, 
2000, CB&I notified the U.S. Department of Justice of the proposed acquisition per 15 U.S.C. § 18a, which requires notification 
for certain large acquisitions of securities and assets. Under 15 U.S.C. § 18a(b), the parties were required to wait thirty days 
before concluding the transaction. More than thirty days later, but before executing the acquisition, the Commission notified 
CB&I that it had begun its investigation. See 15 U.S.C. § 46; 16 C.F.R. § 2.1. CB&I initially agreed to delay executing the merger 
to accommodate the Government's investigation. Approximately four months after the expiration of the 30-day statutory waiting 
period, on February 7, 2001, CB&I  [**5] concluded the deal and acquired PDM's pertinent assets for approximately $ 84 million. "
150,3," The discussion here refers primarily to the LNG tanks, because both appellants and appellee focus on the LNG market and 
extrapolate the general conclusions about the LNG market to all markets. "
151,4," On February 1, 2005, CB&I filed with the Commission a petition to reconsider in light of further evidence of actual new entry of 
foreign competitors into the relevant markets. On March 11, 2005, CB&I filed a petition for review of the December 21st Order 
and Opinion with this court. See 15 U.S.C. § 45(c). On May 10, 2005, the Commission denied the petition regarding actual new 
entry because CB&I had failed to show that any new entry could counteract competition lost from CB&I's acquisition of PDM. 
See Chicago Bridge & Iron Co., et. al., 2005 WL 2329811, Docket No. 9300 (2005) (""R.O.""). On December 15, 2005, CB&I filed 
a motion to adduce additional evidence, substantially similar to new evidence submitted in the petition to reconsider below, with 
this court. We denied this motion on April 13, 2005."
151,5," The appeal at issue primarily concerns section 7 of the Clayton Act as section 5 of the FTC Act is, as the Commission 
determined and the parties do not contest, a derivative violation  [**12] that does not require independent analysis. See Op., at 5 
n.23. "
153,6," CB&I misinterprets the last sentence to argue that the Eleventh Circuit's flexible reading of the burden-shifting framework 
applies only when time is of the essence. Without any basis in the text, CB&I narrows the Eleventh Circuit's opinion. Reading the 
passage as a whole, the Eleventh Circuit considers the Baker Hughes framework as generally flexible in practice for all 
situations, but only emphasizes the need for flexibility when time is of the essence. See Univ. Health, 938 F.2d at 1219 n.25 
(""This is particularly true when the government seeks a temporary restraining order or, as here, a preliminary injunction and, 
thus, time is of the essence."") (emphasis added). "
154,7," The mere fact that the Commission used the word ""persuasive"" does not prevent this court from independently examining the 
context of its conclusions and affirming the judgment if it was indeed correct under the proper legal standards. Cf. Rebel Oil Co., 
Inc. v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 51 F.3d 1421, 1435-36 (9th Cir. 1995) (engaging  [**22] an independent review of the evidence 
despite respondent's claim that the trial court's ""persuasive"" language possibly implied an improper weighing of the evidence). In 
any event, CB&I misconstrues the Commission's use of the word ""persuasive,"" and its use does not suggest any improper 
burden-shifting. The Commission did not use ""persuasive"" to compare CB&I's evidence to the prima facie evidence. Instead, in 
the instances cited by CB&I, (1) the Commission describes CB&I's arguments that certain conclusions should be inferred from its 
evidence as ""unpersuasive"" and does not address the evidence itself, see, e.g., Op. at 61, Op. at 71, Op. at 91, R.O. at 9; and 
(2) the Commission describes a customer's statement as internally ""unpersuasive,"" because it contradicts the customer's other 
proffered evidence; again, this does not describe any comparison between CB&I's evidence and the prima facie case. See Op. 
at 65. "
155,8," HN9[
] Entry barriers are ""additional long-run costs that were not incurred by incumbent firms but must be incurred by new 
entrants,"" or ""factors in the market that deter entry while permitting incumbent firms to earn monopoly returns."" Los Angeles 
Land Co. v. Brunswick Corp., 6 F.3d 1422, 1427-28 (9th Cir.1993) (internal quotations omitted); see also Colorado Interstate 
Gas Co. v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co. Of Am., 885 F.2d 683, 696 n.21 (10th Cir. 1989) (""Barriers  [**28] to entry are market 
characteristics which make it difficult or time-consuming for new firms to enter a market.""). "
156,9," CB&I also misconstrues the I.D. and the Commission opinion to argue that the Commission ignored the ALJ's finding of no 
supracompetitive price increases post-acquisition. In fact, the ALJ only  [**29] concluded that the Government did not prove nor 
was required to prove supracompetitive prices existed post-acquisition. I.D., at 114. Neither the ALJ nor the Commission directly 
ruled that there were no supracompetitive price increases post-acquisition. See Op., at 91; I.D., at 114. In the pertinent part of 
the opinion, the Commission rejected the Government's proffered evidence of post-acquisition price increases because while 
such evidence tends to show the acquisition would lead to anti-competitive conditions, existing evidence was already sufficient 
to lead to that conclusion. HN10[
] ""Whether post-acquisition evidence is admissible depends on the nature of the evidence."" Dailey v. Quality School Plan, Inc., 427 F.2d 1080, 1082 (5th Cir. 1970) (citing FTC v. Procter & Gamble, 386 U.S. 568, 87 S. Ct. 
1224, 18 L. Ed. 2d 303 (1967)); see id. at 576 (rejecting Court of Appeal's reliance on four years of post-merger data as 
""misapprehend[ing] the standards for its review and the standards applicable in a [Section 7 of the Clayton Act] proceeding.""). 
We read Dailey as providing the trial court discretion in deciding when to admit post-acquisition evidence and Procter & Gamble 
as concluding that post-acquisition evidence is not  [**30] dispositive. The Commission thus did not abuse its discretion in so 
ruling. See In re Plywood Antitrust Litigation, 655 F.2d 627, 637 (5th Cir. 1981)."
156,10," CB&I relies on Baker Hughes to argue that the very threat of entry from foreign firms would constrain anti-competitive effects a 
fortiori such that it is not necessary that a new entrant enter ""on par."" See Baker Hughes, 908 F.2d at 988. Such reliance is 
misplaced. First, Baker Hughes' conclusion that a mere threat of entry is sufficient to constrain anti-competitive effects has been 
criticized, and we will not adopt it here. See United States v. United Tote, Inc., 768 F. Supp. 1064, 1081 (D. Del. 1991) (noting 
that interpreting Baker Hughes as encouraging a lax standard is inconsistent with the critical examination of potential entrant's 
ability to restrain competition); see also 4 Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law: An Analysis of Antitrust "
157,," Principles and Their Application P 941h (2d ed. 2000) (criticizing Baker Hughes' lax standards that favor respondents) (""Areeda 
& Hovenkamp""); Darren Bush & Salvatorre Massa,  [**34] ""Rethinking the Potential Competition Doctrine,"" 2004 WIS. L. REV. 
1035, 1074-79 (2004). Morever, HN12[
] there is a high threshold applied to assertions as to whether a company can be 
considered a potential entrant for anti-trust purposes. See 2A Areeda & Hovenkamp, at P 422 (""The more concentrated the 
market and the greater the threat posted by the challenged practice, the more convincing must be the evidence of likely, timely, 
and effective entry.""). The burden of production must provide evidence that the likelihood of entry reaches a threshold ranging 
from ""reasonable probability"" to ""certainty."" CB&I's evidence does not approach either threshold so as to rebut the prima facie 
case. See BOC International, Ltd. v. Federal Trade Com., 557 F.2d 24, 28 n.7 (2d Cir. 1977); FTC v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 549 
F.2d 289, 294-295 (4th Cir. 1977); Mercantile Texas Corp. v. Board of Governors of Fed. Reserve Sys., 638 F.2d 1255, 1266 
(5th Cir. 1981). Therefore, the Commission had substantial evidence to conclude that CB&I failed to rebut the prima facie case, 
because there is no such evidence that the threat of potential entrants will constrain the acquisition's anti-competitive effects. "
158,11," Merger Guidelines are often used as persuasive authority when deciding if a particular acquisition  [**39] violates anti-trust 
laws. See United States v. Kinder, 64 F.3d 757, 771 (2d Cir. 1995)."
158,12," HN16[
] Long-term trends in HHI changes can be used to examine the structure of markets and are used to determine the 
effect of mergers on the market. See State of N.Y. v. Kraft Gen. Foods, Inc., 926 F. Supp. 321, 362 (S.D.N.Y. 1995). Here, the 
market trends in HHIs provide substantial evidence that CB&I and PDM have been the dominant players in the relevant markets 
and do not indicate any trend of reduced concentration; rather, a merger accelerates the trend towards increased concentration, 
as its previous competitors have dropped out of the relevant markets. Id. "
159,13," Moreover, as we noted earlier in supra note 11, the Merger Guidelines are not binding on the courts and the agency during 
adjudication but are only highly persuasive authorities as a ""benchmark of legality."" See United States v. Kinder, 64 F.3d 757, 
771 & n.22 (2d Cir. 1995) (""Although it is widely acknowledged that the Merger Guidelines do not bind the judiciary in 
determining whether to sanction a corporate merger or acquisition for anticompetitive effect, courts commonly cite them as a 
benchmark of legality.""). HN20[
] The Merger Guidelines do not guide adjudicative decisions at the agency and court-level, 
because they are merely enforcement policy statements that establish standards for exercising prosecutorial discretion. Id.; see 
also Native Am. Arts, Inc. v. Waldron Corp., 399 F.3d 871, 874 (7th Cir. 2005); Merger Guidelines, 57 Fed. Reg. at 41553 § 0. 
Enforcement policy is not binding on the agency and has no force of law. See Olin Corp., 986 F.2d at 1300 (""Certainly the 
[Merger] Guidelines are not binding on  [**46] the courts . . . or, for that matter, on the Commission."") (emphasis added); Brock 
v. Cathedral Bluffs Shale Oil Co., 254 U.S. App. D.C. 242, 796 F.2d 533, 538 (D.C. Cir. 1986); see also Nat'l Wrestling Coaches 
Ass'n v. Dep't of Educ., 363 U.S. App. D.C. 239, 383 F.3d 1047, 1048 (D.C. Cir. 2004); cf. Ash Grove Cement Co. v. F. T. C., 
577 F.2d 1368, 1374 (9th Cir. 1978). CB&I's citation to Nevins v. NLRB, 796 F.2d 14, 18 (2d Cir. 1986) is inapposite. Nevins "
160,," deals with guidelines concerning the adjudicatory function within the NLRB context, but the Merger Guidelines deal with the 
enforcement function of the agency and are explicitly denoted as non-binding. Enforcement, unlike adjudication, is also an area 
the courts are ""most reluctant to interfere."" See Brock, 796 F.2d at 538."
160,14," Even so, the Merger Guidelines delegate much discretion in the application of these rules and reject a ""mechanical 
application"" of the Guidelines. Merger Guidelines, 57 Fed. Reg. at 41552. The Merger Guidelines urge the Commission to ""apply 
[the Guidelines'] standards reasonably and flexibly to the particular facts and circumstances of each proposed merger."" Id. "
161,15," Just allowing entrants to win bids does not guarantee the entrants would be able to enter the market permanently, since 
winning a bid does not necessarily result in the successful completion of the project especially in light of evidence that CB&I 
controls skilled laborers necessary for success that other competitors do not have."
161,16," The petitioner's argument that the evidence is part of the administrative record, because the petition for reconsideration at the 
Commission level was included in Fed. R. App. P. 17's certified list of documents listing the ""record"" on appeal is without merit. 
HN22[
] The certified list includes not only ""any findings or report on which [the order at issue on appeal] is based,"" but also 
any ""pleadings, evidence, and other parts of the proceedings before the agency."" Fed. R. App. P. 16(a); Fed. R. App. P. 17. 
Pleadings and evidence relevant to other parts of the proceedings before the agency, such as a petition for reconsideration, do 
not constitute the administrative record for the order at issue. Moreover, the Commission has explicitly  [**52] rejected the 
evidence as a basis for its order in its denial of the petition to reconsider. See Global Van Lines, Inc. v. I.C.C., 714 F.2d 1290, 
1298 (5th Cir. 1983) (""It has, moreover, been settled for at least forty years that '[t]he grounds upon which an administrative 
order must be judged are those upon which the record discloses that its action was based.'"") (quoting SEC v. Chenery Corp. 
(Chenery I), 318 U.S. 80, 87, 63 S. Ct. 454, 87 L. Ed. 626 (1943))."
161,17," In addition, for the reasons we noted in Section II.3.C.i, supra, this post-acquisition evidence is likely not very probative, 
because it can arguably be subject to manipulation. "
163,18," The Commission concluded that ""[a]ll of the factors work together to help form CB&I's reputation for quality and reliability."" Op. 
at 58. Reputation here can be considered an industry-specific ""entrenched buyer preference[] for [an] established brand[]"" built 
into the industry-specific bid process. See, e.g., Am. Council for Certified Podiatric Physicians and Surgeons v. Am. Board of 
Podiatric Surgery, Inc., 185 F.3d 606, 623 (6th Cir. 1999) (""[E]stablishing credibility naturally seems to be a significant barrier to 
entry, particularly for an enterprise that depends heavily upon reputation, such as certification of medical specialists.""); Los 
Angeles Land Co. v. Brunswick Corp., 6 F.3d 1422, 1428 n.4 (9th Cir. 1993)  [**59] (""The main sources of entry barriers are: . . . 
(3) entrenched buyer preferences for established brands or company reputations."") (emphasis added); cf. FMC Corp., 170 F.3d 
at 531 (""The question is not whether there are barriers to entry, but rather whether the barriers in a particular industry are large 
enough to trigger judicial concern."") (emphasis added). District courts have also so held. See, e.g., Cardinal Health, Inc., 12 F. 
Supp. 2d at 57 (""The sheer economies of scale and strength of reputation that the Defendants already have over these 
wholesalers serve as barriers to competitors as they attempt to grow significantly in size.""); United States v. Franklin Elec. Co., 
Inc., 130 F. Supp. 2d 1025, 1031-032 (W.D. Wis. 2000); see generally United Tote, Inc., 768 F. Supp. at 1075, 1079-81 (""In 
reality, the weight accorded to reputational barriers to entry will vary with the circumstances of a given case.""). "
165,19," CB&I cites to Reynolds Metals Co. v. FTC, 114 U.S. App. D.C. 2, 309 F.2d 223, 230-231 (D.C. Cir. 1962), to suggest the 
Commission failed to distinguish between after-acquired properties and before-acquired properties as in Reynolds. InI Cascade 
Natural Gas Corp. v. El Paso Natural Gas Co., 386 U.S. 129, 136-137, 87 S. Ct. 932, 17 L. Ed. 2d 814 (1967), the Supreme 
Court assumed after-acquired assets may be included in the divestiture order, though the Court in Cascade Natural Gas 
remanded the case for an additional hearing on how assets should be divided. Here, instead of a hearing, the Commission 
devolved authority to decide what assets will be involved in the divestiture to CB&I and the monitor trustee. Permitting the 
respondent and a trustee to decide, instead of holding another court hearing, is within the Commission's broad authority to 
fashion relief.  [**71] The Commission's remedy in this case is also possibly a superior and more efficient method to resolve the 
issue. "
166,20," We also find the Commission's detailed decisions in both its Opinion and Decision on Petition for Reconsideration where 
remedy issues were discussed, see, e.g., R.O., at 23-24, as providing adequate reasons justifying the remedy and its 
relationship with its objectives. Unlike in United States v. Microsoft, 346 U.S. App. D.C. 330, 253 F.3d 34, 103 (D.C. Cir. 2001), 
which remanded due to the lack of an adequate explanation for the remedy, the Commission provided much more in form and 
substance than a ""mere four paragraphs"" to explain its remedy."
166,21," Even assuming CB&I was surprised by the extent of the remedy, surprise itself does not merit reversal without allegations of 
prejudice. See Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 103; Eli Lilly & Co. v. Generix Drug Sales, 460 F.2d 1096, 1106 (5th Cir. 1972) (HN30[
] 
""[S]urprise alone is not a sufficient basis for appellate reversal;  [**74] appellant must also show that the procedures followed 
resulted in prejudice.""). CB&I does not present any argument ""that the lack of notice caused the complaining party to withhold 
certain proof which would show his entitlement to relief on the merits,"" thus we cannot reverse based on allegations of surprise 
alone. Id. "
170,1," The specific defendants at issue are as follows: Micron Technology, Inc.; Micron Semiconductor Products, Inc.; Infineon 
Technologies AG; Infineon Technologies North America Corporation; Mosel Vitelic Corporation; Mosel Vitelic Corporation USA; 
Nanya Technology Corporation; Nanya Technology Corporation USA; Elpida Memory, Inc.; Elpida Memory (USA), Inc.; Hynix 
Semiconductor, Inc.; Hynix Semiconductor America, Inc.; and NEC Electronics America, Inc. (collectively ""defendants""). "
172,2," The 15 states are: Arizona, California, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North 
Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. See SAC, PP 287-311. Defendants here include 2 
additional states. -- Iowa and West Virginia -- that were not challenged in defendants' prior motion for judgment on the pleadings, 
and they no longer challenge plaintiffs' claim under Minnesota's antitrust statute, in view of the Minnesota Supreme Court's 
recent holding that the AGC factors are not applicable to Minnesota law. See Lorix v. Crompton Corp., 736 N.W.2d 619, 632 
(Minn. 2007)(""The AGC factors, as we have explained, do not provide the benchmark for standing under Minnesota antitrust 
law."")). With respect to  [**9] Iowa and West Virginia, Iowa's Supreme Court recently announced that the AGC factors apply to 
Iowa's antitrust law, and West Virginia's antitrust law contains a relevant harmonization provision. See Southard v. VISA USA, 
Inc., 734 N.W.2d 192, 198-99 (Iowa 2007)(""We think the district court properly applied [the AGC] factors in deciding the plaintiffs 
had no standing under Iowa's competition law""); W. Va. Code § 47-18-16 (""This article shall be construed liberally and in 
harmony with ruling judicial interpretations of comparable federal antitrust statutes""). "
173,3," To the extent that the court's discussion in the JOP Order addressed plaintiffs' participation in the ""relevant market"" for DRAM, 
the court's discussion was focused solely on the principle that antitrust injury analysis is concerned with ""protecting the economic 
freedom of participants in the relevant market,"" see AGC, 459 U.S. at 538. Accordingly, the term ""relevant market"" as used 
previously by the court is distinct from the term of art employed elsewhere in antitrust law - e.g., for purposes of defining the 
""relevant  [**14] market"" for products and services, particularly in section 2 cases. The latter is discussed more fully herein. "
176,4," The SAC does allege, in passing, that plaintiffs ""participate in the market for the sale of DRAM."" See SAC, P 132. However, as 
plaintiffs' subsequent allegations make clear, plaintiffs' participation in the market ""for the sale of DRAM"" is alleged via plaintiffs' 
participation in an ""inextricably linked and intertwined"" computer market. See id. at PP 133, 137, 139. Accordingly, the former 
cannot plausibly be considered as an allegation that plaintiffs participate in the same market for DRAM."
176,5," The court's prior JOP Order contained the observation that ""antitrust standing is generally granted only where the plaintiff is a 
participant in the relevant market -- e.g., a consumer or competitor in the relevant market alleged."" See JOP Order at 14. For 
purposes of clarification, the court notes here that in making this observation, it was not the court's intention to imply that only 
consumers or competitors can qualify as market participants. As plaintiffs note, such is not the case. See Am. Ad. Mgmt., 190 
F.3d at 1058. Rather, the court's statement set forth the principle that consumers or competitors are qualifying examples of 
market participants. "
177,6," Specifically, the court finds that the pin cite defendants rely on in Crouch does not support their argument, and the court has 
declined to comb through the remaining pages of the Crouch opinion searching for the pin cite that might provide defendants 
with the authority they seek. "
187,1," Defendants are Tyco International, Ltd., Tyco International (U.S.), Inc., Tyco Healthcare Group, L.P. (now Covidien), and The 
Kendall Healthcare Products Company (collectively, ""Tyco""). "
195,2," Effective December 1, 2007, the language of Rule 23 was amended ""to make style and terminology consistent throughout the 
rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic only."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 advisory committee's note 2007 Amendment 
(emphasis added). For the sake of clarity, the Court will cite to the amended language. "
199,3," Some courts have found Valley Drug's ""reasoning persuasive."" In re Relafen Antitrust Litig., 221 F.R.D. 260, 270 (D. Mass. 
2004) (citing prior order that followed Valley Drug and excluded from indirect purchaser end  [**41] payor class those that 
""suffered no economic harm.""); see also Grimes v. Fairfield Resorts, Inc., No. 06-14363, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 1958, 2007 WL

Antitrust Litig., 237 F.R.D. 454, 461-63 (D. Kan. 2006) (following Valley Drug in discovery dispute). Other courts have criticized Valley Drug.  [**42] See, e.g., Meijer, Inc. v. Warner Chilcott Holdings Co. III, Ltd., 246 F.R.D. 293, 
2007 WL 3257015, at *9 (D.D.C. Oct. 2007) (noting that the holding in Valley Drug ""fails to appreciate the true import of the

ruling that Valley Drug's ""narrow reading of Hanover Shoe is neither shared by this Court nor this circuit.""). "
200,4," Plaintiffs did not move to amend their Complaint before adding Smith Drug as a class representative pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 
15(c). However, because Plaintiffs did so at the suggestion of the Court, and because Tyco does not object that Smith Drug was 
not properly added, the Court will treat Smith Drug as a proper class representative. "
201,5," Indeed, in the multi-district litigation this Court has handled, separate counsel represented the consumers and the third-party 
payors during mediation to ensure that the class fund was divided fairly. This approach provided assurance to the Court that the 
funds were fairly allocated. "
206,6," Although the Court need not address the issue here, if the Court finds that the Plaintiffs establish predominance, the Court 
likely will also find that the Plaintiffs satisfy the superiority requirement of Rule 23(b)(3). Distributor class members may be 
reluctant to bring actions against manufacturers, and thus  [**69] ""a class action may be the only practical method for resolving 
their claims."" See In re Industrial Diamonds Antitrust Litig., 167 F.R.D. 374, 386 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (finding class action superior 
method of adjudicating case where, among other things, some class members ""still depend on [the defendants] for their supply 
of industrial diamond products and may be hesitant to disrupt those relationships.""); 6 Herbert B. Newberg & Alba Conte, 
Newberg on Class Actions § 18.41 (4th ed. 2002) (""Class actions perform an important function in cases where individual 
franchisees or purchasers are reluctant to sue because they fear economic reprisal,"" citing cases). "
213,1," An Executive Summary of this Memorandum Opinion, which does not represent the official and complete Court findings of fact 
or conclusions of law, is available on the public docket for this case."
213,2," The California Movants include the States of California, Connecticut, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts, and the District of Columbia. See Plaintiff States' Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of their 
Motion to Extend the Final Judgment Until November 12, 2012 (hereinafter ""CA Mem."") at 1. The New York Movants include the 
States of New York, Maryland, Louisiana and Florida. See Joinder of Plaintiff States of New York, Maryland, Louisiana and 
Florida in Moving to Extend the Final Judgments (hereinafter ""NY Mem."") at 1. As detailed below, the California Movants and 
New York Movants each belong to larger groups of state plaintiffs in this action, respectively the ""California Group"" or ""Litigating 
States"" and ""New York Group"" or ""Settling States."""
213,3," A number of states who were Plaintiffs in this action have not moved to extend the Final Judgments. According to the New York 
Movants, ""Plaintiff States Illinois, Kentucky, and Ohio do not object to extending the Final Judgments. Plaintiff States Michigan, 
North Carolina, and Utah take no position on the decree extension.  [**3] Plaintiff State Wisconsin does not join in the motion."" 
NY Mem. at 1 n.2. "
214,4," By separate Order, the Court shall grant the Motion of the United States for Leave to Participate as Amicus Curiae. The Court 
shall also grant the Motion of Visa, Inc. and Weyerhaeuser Company for Leave to File Brief as Amici Curiae. The Court 
 [**4] has reviewed the Visa/Weyerhaeuser amicus brief and notes that it raises an argument also asserted by Microsoft and the 
United States, which is thoroughly considered below."
214,5," The Court's extension of the Expiring Provisions does not  [**5] include § III.B, which neither the California Movants nor the 
New York Movants seek to extend. See CA Mem. at 1; NY Mem. at 8 n.14. "
215,6," The ""Plaintiffs"" for purposes of the Court's Remedy Opinion included the States of California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, 
Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina,  [**8] Ohio, Utah, West Virginia, 
and Wisconsin, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the District of Columbia. See 224 F. Supp. 2d at 86 n.3. As 
discussed below, a number of states (the ""Settling States"" or the ""New York Group"") litigated their claims through liability and 
settled as to the issue of remedy, while other states and the District of Columbia (the ""Litigating States"" or the ""California Group"") 
participated in the remedy-specific evidentiary hearing. Id. at n.3, n.4."
215,7," ""PC"" is short for ""personal computer."" Remedy Opinion, 224 F. Supp. 2d at 89 n.10 (citing United States v. Microsoft, 84 F. 
Supp. 2d 9, P 1 (D.D.C. 1999) (hereinafter ""Findings of Fact"")). The D.C. Circuit explained the functions of a PC operating 
system (""OS""): Operating systems perform many functions, including allocating computer memory and controlling peripherals such as 
printers and keyboards. Operating systems also function as platforms for software applications. They do this by ""exposing""-
-i.e.,  [**11] making available to software developers--routines or protocols that perform certain widely-used functions. 
These are known as Application Programming Interfaces, or ""APIs."" Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 53 (citations omitted). Software developers wanting to include a function enabled by a particular API in 
their applications need not duplicate it in their own code, but rather can ""call"" or use the API included in Microsoft's ""Windows"" 
operating system. Id. ""Microsoft began shipping a software package for the PC called Windows"" in 1985, and introduced 
updated versions in 1995 and 1998, known as Windows 95 and Windows 98, respectively. Remedy Opinion, 224 F. Supp. 2d 
at 90 n.12 (citing Findings of Fact P 7-8). At the time of this Court's remedy proceeding, the most current version of Windows 
was Windows XP. Id. Microsoft has since released another update, known as Windows Vista, which was made available to the 
general public in January 2007. "
216,8," Plaintiffs focused their attention on ""two such middleware threats to Microsoft's operating system dominance--Netscape 
Navigator and the Java technologies."" Remedy Opinion, 224 F. Supp. 2d at 90 (citing Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 53)."
216,9," For the sake of clarity, the Court defines a number of acronyms that  [**14] are used throughout the previous opinions of this 
Court and the D.C. Circuit, as well as in the Final Judgments: ""OEMs"" are ""original equipment manufacturers;"" ""IAPs"" are 
Internet access providers; ""ISVs"" are independent software vendors; ""IHVs"" are independent hardware vendors; and ""ICPs"" are 
internet content providers. See Final Judgments, §§ VI.F-I; VI.O."
216,10," The ""Java"" technologies are ""a set of technologies developed by Sun Microsystems,"" which the D.C. Circuit described as 
""another type of middleware posing a potential threat to Windows' platforms."" Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 74."
216,11," ""Intel is a firm engaged principally in the design and manufacture of microprocessors,"" and a ""segment of Intel's business 
develops software."" Remedy Opinion, 224 F. Supp. 2d at 95 (quoting Findings of Fact P 95). "
217,12," In addition to the claims described above, Plaintiffs' complaint originally included a separate claim for ""monopoly leveraging"" 
under § 2 of the Sherman Act, on which Judge Jackson granted summary judgment in favor of Microsoft because the claim ran 
""contrary to both economic theory and the Sherman Act's plain language."" Remedy Opinion, 224 F. Supp. 2d at 95 n.21 
(quoting United States v. Microsoft, Civil Action No. 98-1233, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14231, 1998 WL 614485, at *27 (D.D.C. 
Sept. 14, 1998))."
217,13," As noted in this Court's various remedy-related opinions, ""the objective of 'terminating the illegal monopoly,' is incompatible 
with the facts of this case [because] [n]either the district court, nor the appellate court concluded that Microsoft had illegally 
obtained its monopoly,"" but only found that Microsoft had illegally maintained its monopoly. New York v. Microsoft Corp., 231 F. 
Supp. 2d 203, 211 n.4 (2002) (hereinafter ""Settling States Opinion"") (internal citations omitted). As a result, the Court's remedy 
focused on terminating Microsoft's illegal maintenance of its monopoly, rather than on terminating the monopoly itself. Id.; see 
also Remedy Opinion, 224 F. Supp. 2d at 101 (stating that ""the proper objective of the remedy in this case is termination of the 
exclusionary acts and practices related thereto which served to illegally maintain [Microsoft's] monopoly.""). "
218,14," The Settling States, or New York Group, include the States of New York, Ohio, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, 
Michigan, North Carolina, and Wisconsin. Remedy Opinion, 224 F. Supp. 2d at 87 n.5."
218,15," The Litigating States, or California Group, include the States of California, Connecticut, Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, 
Utah, and West Virginia, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the District of Columbia. Remedy Opinion, 224 F. Supp. 
2d at 86 n.3."
218,16," The Court entered three Final Judgments in November 2002; two in the instant case, and one in United States v. Microsoft. 
Because the United States does not seek to extend the Final Judgment in United States  [**22] v. Microsoft, however, this 
opinion addresses only the two ""Final Judgments"" entered in this case."
218,17," As discussed in greater detail below, the Court deemed it ""imperative, in this unusually complex case, for the Court's retention 
of jurisdiction to be clearly articulated and broadly drawn,"" and therefore suggested that the parties amend the proposed consent 
decree to reserve for the Court ""the power to sua sponte issue orders or directions regarding [] the final judgment, including, but 
not limited to orders regarding the construction or carrying out of the final judgment, the enforcement of compliance therewith, 
and the punishment of any violation thereof."" Tunney Act Opinion, 231 F. Supp. 2d at 201. The Court concluded such a 
provision would ""ensure that the Court retain[] the power intended by the parties and which the Court deem[ed] necessary to 
ensure effective implementation of the final judgment in this case."" Id."
218,18," In a previous Memorandum Opinion, the Court had reviewed the pertinent procedural history and determined that the parties 
had satisfied the other requirements of the Tunney Act. See generally United States v. Microsoft Corp., 215 F. Supp. 2d 1 
(D.D.C. 2002). "
220,19," Section III.A of the Litigating States' Final Judgment also prohibits Microsoft from threatening retaliation against OEMs for the 
same conduct. Litigating States Final Judgment, § III.A."
220,20," ""Covered OEMs"" are ""the 20 OEMs with the highest worldwide volume of licenses of Windows Operating System Products 
reported to Microsoft in Microsoft's fiscal year preceding the effective date of the Final Judgment[s]."" Final Judgments, § VI.D."
220,21," As noted above, the Moving States do not seek to extend § III.B."
220,22," The Settling States' Final Judgment provides that Microsoft may not impede an OEM's ability to automatically launch Non-
Microsoft Middleware ""if a Microsoft Middleware Product that provides similar functionality would otherwise be launched 
automatically."" Settling States Final Judgment, § III.C.3. In contrast, the Litigating States' Final Judgment narrows  [**29] further 
the situations in which Microsoft may impede an OEM's ability to automatically launch Non-Microsoft Middleware, limiting 
Microsoft's ability to do so to those circumstances where the Non-Microsoft Middleware ""replaces or drastically alters the 
Windows Operating System Product user interface."" Litigating States Final Judgment, § III.C.3."
220,23," The Settling States' Final Judgment prevents Microsoft from impeding by agreement an OEM's ability to present its own IAP 
offer during the initial boot sequence, ""provided that the OEM complies with reasonable technical specifications established by 
Microsoft."" Settling States Final Judgment, § III.C.5. In contrast, the Litigating States' Final Judgment contains no such 
requirement or restriction, Litigating States Final Judgment, § III.C.5. "
221,24," Like § III.A, § III.F of the Litigating States' Final Judgment also prohibits Microsoft from threatening retaliation against ISVs and 
IHVs. Settling States Final Judgment, § III.F. "
224,25," As noted above, because the Litigating States opposed the creation of a technical committee, their Final Judgment included 
only a Compliance Officer. Over time, however, the Litigating States recognized the beneficial role the TC played in the Settling 
States' enforcement efforts. See 9/11/07 Status Conference Hrg. Tr. at 38:14-39:7. In addition, as Section III.E emerged as the 
main area of compliance-related issues, the Litigating  [**46] States retained their own expert on communications protocols and 
technical documentation standards, Mr. Craig Hunt. See 7/9/04 Joint Status Report. Mr. Hunt has since worked alongside the 
TC, and participated in its activities on behalf of the Litigating States. Practically speaking, then, the TC's activities have 
redounded to the benefit of all of the Plaintiffs, not only the Settling States. Moreover, when the Court refers to the TC 
henceforth, it intends that term to include Mr. Hunt. "
228,26," The insufficiency of the resources Microsoft originally devoted to technical documentation project is clear from Microsoft's 
latest Supplemental Status Report, which states that ""[a]pproximately 630 Microsoft employees and contingent staff are involved 
in work on the MCPP technical documentation,"" along with Microsoft's protocol documentation efforts for the European 
Commission, and that ""approximately 320 product team engineers and program managers are actively involved in the creation 
and review of the technical content of the [MCPP] documentation."" 1/15/08 MS Suppl. Report at 6. "
229,27," Of course, if the parties had not been able to negotiate the RESET plan when the Section III.E issues reached a crisis point, 
Plaintiffs would have been entitled--pursuant to Section V.B of the Final Judgments--to commence an enforcement proceeding 
and, in the event that ""the Court found that Microsoft ha[d] engaged in a pattern of willful and systematic violations,"" to ""apply to 
the Court for a one-time extension of th[e] Final Judgment[s] of up to two years,"" i.e., until November 12, 2009. See Final 
Judgments, § V.B."
229,28," Again, the Court notes that while Microsoft now reports that ""[a]pproximately 630 Microsoft employees and contingent staff are 
involved in work on the MCPP technical documentation,"" with ""approximately 320 product team engineers and program 
managers [] actively involved in the creation and review of the technical content of the documentation,"" 1/15/08 MS Suppl. 
Report at 6, it originally devoted only ten employees to the project of creating the necessary technical documentation. See 
7/3/03 JSR at 22. Even as of Microsoft's March 15, 2006 Supplemental Status Report--filed more than three years after 
 [**68] the technical documentation was originally anticipated to be released--a total of approximately 83 Microsoft employees 
worked either full-or part-time on the documentation effort. 3/15/06 MS Suppl. Report at 9-10. "
231,29," Each Final Judgment states that it will expire five years after being entered by the Court ""[u]nless this Court grants an 
extension,"" Final Judgments, § V.A., and provides that the Court retains jurisdiction to ""act sua sponte to issue further orders or 
directions, including but not limited to orders or directions relating to the construction or carrying out of this Final Judgment, the 
enforcement of compliance therewith, the modification thereof, and the punishment of any violation thereof,"" as well as ""for the 
purpose of enabling either of the parties . . . to apply to this Court at any time for further orders and directions as may be 
necessary or appropriate to carry out or construe [the] Final Judgment, to modify or terminate any of its provisions, to enforce 
compliance, and to punish violations of its provisions,"" id., § VII. "
238,30," In addition, as the United States points out, the Moving States ""make no showing . . . that any conduct by Microsoft 
 [**106] (either in violation of the decree or otherwise) has foreclosed the OEM channel to third-party browsers."" US Amicus Br. 
at 4. "
239,31," The Moving States' argument that Microsoft may threaten emerging technologies through its alleged dominance of the web 
browser market also appears quite similar to an argument raised during the remedy proceeding that certain protections should 
be included in the remedy to ""ensure that Microsoft does not use its control over the browser market to control other technology 
markets."" Remedy Opinion, 224 F. Supp. 2d at 241, n. 118. That argument was rejected in the Remedy Opinion, however, 
because it ""reflect[ed] an attempt to argue either a new attempted monopolization claim or the previously court-rejected 
'monopoly leveraging' theory of liability by extending that 'leveraging' argument to emerging areas of technology."" Id. (quoting 
United States v. Microsoft Corp., 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14231, 1998 WL 614485, *26-28 (D.D.C. Sept. 14, 1998)). Furthermore, 
in affirming this Court's remedy, the D.C. Circuit rejected an argument that ""Microsoft 'advantage[d] its own middleware by using 
the browser to limit the functionality of competing products,'"" concluding that this Court's remedy ""properly focused . . . upon 
opening the channels of distribution to . . . rivals,"" rather  [**110] than eliminating ""harm to specific competitors."" Massachusetts 
v. Microsoft, 373 F.3d at 1229."
239,32," To the extent that the Moving States suggest that the key to protecting emerging web-based middleware threats is to ensure 
that Microsoft ""maintains IE as a standards-compliant browser,"" see CA Mem. at 20-21, that argument is foreclosed by this 
Court's Remedy Opinion. As Microsoft correctly notes, the Court considered and rejected a ""requirement that Microsoft maintain 
support for industry standards where it has made proprietary modifications to the standards,"" because that conduct ""was found . 
. . to have competitive benefits which outweigh the anticompetitive effect of the conduct,"" because the proposed requirement 
was ""likely to have only a modest effect on competition, if at all,"" and because it ""impose[d] unworkable conditions."" Remedy 
Opinion, 224 F. Supp. 2d at 190-91. Significantly, the D.C. Circuit specifically affirmed this Court's conclusion in that respect, 
holding that ""the district court permissibly refused to require that Microsoft continue to support a standard after making a 
proprietary modification to it, even if the modification makes the standard incompatible with the  [**111] original."" Massachusetts 
v. Microsoft, 373 F.3d at 1215. "
243,33," To this end, the Moving States assert that ""there are continuing questions not just about the accuracy of the [technical 
documentation], but whether the [technical documentation] is complete,"" citing the results of the first audit triggered by 
Microsoft's conclusion in early 2007 that additional protocols should be added to the MCPP. CA Mem. at 10-11. As Microsoft 
notes, however, ""Microsoft and the TC recently adopted a set of modest recommendations following the TC's analysis of the 
[consulting firm's report] that were substantially different from the [firm's] recommendations."" MS Opp'n at 14 n.7. Microsoft 
further asserts that, to the best  [**126] of its knowledge, ""the agreement between Microsoft and the TC resolved the few issues 
raised by the [consulting firm's] report that the TC deemed necessary to address."" Id. It therefore appears that any outstanding 
issues relating to the completeness of the technical documentation are being addressed in an appropriate manner."
243,34," Indeed, in the unlikely event that the proceedings to this point have not provided Microsoft with sufficient incentive to speedily 
produce certifiably complete, accurate, and useable technical documentation, this extension of the Expiring Provisions of the 
Final Judgment should certainly spur Microsoft to do so. "
244,35," In addition, as noted above, Microsoft has agreed that ""even if the Final Judgments expire completely in November 2009, it will 
continue, through November 11, 2012, to make the protocols included in the MCPP  [**131] available for license on reasonable 
and non-discriminatory terms with a term of at least five years."" 5/12/06 JSR at 10. As a result of this commitment, ""industry 
members will effectively have the ability to license protocols through at least November 11, 2017."" Id."
244,36," The Court is aware that in Hughes v. United States, 342 U.S. 353, 72 S. Ct. 306, 96 L. Ed. 394 (1952), the Supreme Court 
concluded that a District Court was within its power to modify a consent decree ""after a proper hearing."" Id. at 357-58. The Court 
notes, however, that its resolution of the Moving States' motions does not depend upon any disputed facts that might require an 
evidentiary hearing. Furthermore, the parties were provided a complete hearing on the issues raised in the Moving States' 
motions through their pleadings and, where the Court identified additional areas requiring consideration, it sought further briefing 
from the Moving States and allowed Microsoft sufficient time to respond to that briefing. In light of the parties' thorough handling 
of the relevant issues in their pleadings, the Court concluded that oral argument would be redundant, and was therefore not 
warranted given the tight schedule for resolution of the Moving States' motions imposed by the parties and the Court. "
246,1," Plaintiff dismissed the complaint against Defendant Tampa Cargo on March 22, 2007, Docket Document No. 55. "
247,2," The bankruptcy court dismissed this case on September 29, 2005, and ordered CAF and ILS to litigate their claims in Carolina 
Superior Court. In re Ivyport Logistical Servs., Inc., No. 04-7016 (Bankr. D.P.R. 2005). "
248,3," CAF has filed several cases against Plaintiff in Carolina Superior Court. In 2002, CAF sued Plaintiff for breach of the sublease 
agreement, seeking to evict Plaintiff and to recover money allegedly owed in rent and other charges. Caribbean Airport Facilities, 
Inc. v. Ivyport Logistical Servs., Inc., No. FPE 2002-0606 (Carolina Super. Ct. filed Aug. 20, 2002). In 2005, CAF sued Plaintiff 
for the repossession of equipment given as collateral for a loan of Plaintiff's, which CAF had acquired. Caribbean Airport 
Facilities, Inc. v. Ivyport Logistical Servs., Inc., No. FAC 2005-2383 (Carolina Super. Ct. filed October 4, 2005). Also in 2005, 
CAF sued Plaintiff for $316,340.00, alleging that Plaintiff had wrongfully used CAF facilities, and seeking payment of rent for this 
use. Caribbean Airport Facilities, Inc. v. Ivyport Logistical Servs., Inc., No. FCD 2005-2005 (Carolina Super. Ct. filed October 4, 
2005). All three cases are still pending."
248,4," Although the four Defendants filed three separate summary judgment motions, we consider their arguments together in our 
analysis. "
256,1," Dr. Alex Lobera, was added to the action in Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint, after the filing of Defendants' motion. Plaintiffs did 
not seek leave to add Dr. Lobera to the action,  [**3] as per Fed. R. Civ. P. 21, and he does not appear to have been served with 
process. He appears to be unrepresented in the present matter and has not entered an appearance on his own behalf. In short, 
while Dr. Lobera's name appears somewhat inconsistently in the header portion of Plaintiff's amended pleadings, he does not 
actually appear to be a party to this action."
256,2," Plaintiffs allege in different places in their complaint that the relevant geographic market is southwestern New Mexico [Plaintiffs' 
Amended Complaint at 5]; Dona Ana County [Amended Complaint at 11]; and southern New Mexico and western Texas 
[Amended Complaint at 15]. As the relevant count for present purposes is Count III, and in Count III Plaintiffs allege that the 
relevant geographic market is ""southern New Mexico and western Texas"" [Amended Complaint at 15] the Court will adopt this as 
the relevant market for purposes of considering this motion."
256,3," Plaintiffs also bring a claim under the New Mexico Antitrust Act, HN1[
] N.M. Stat. Ann. §57-1-1. This law is patterned after Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, and mandates a construction ""in harmony with judicial interpretations of the federal 
antitrust laws."" N.M. Stat. Ann. § 57-1-15; Smith Mach. Co. v. Hesston Corp., 878 F.2d 1290, 1292-93 (10th Cir. 1989). Thus the 
analysis of the claims under Section 1 applies equally to these claims."
256,4, Plaintiffs do not allege  [**5] any facts regarding El Paso/Vinton Diagnostics' interest in the action. 
257,5," Plaintiffs allege the reduction of competition in southwestern New Mexico, but do not mention western Texas, the larger part of 
the relevant market as defined by Plaintiffs in their complaint. "
259,6," Restraints on trade are normally referred to as either horizontal or vertical. Horizontal restraints are those implemented by a 
competitor at the same market level, while vertical restraints on trade are those that are implemented by a competitor at a 
different market level."
259,7," Indeed, considering that Dr. Lobera does not appear to be a party to the instant action at all, it is difficult to see how Plaintiffs 
intended to succeed on their claim of a group boycott. See note 1, supra. "
260,8," These hospitals include but are not limited to: Mountain View Regional Hospital in Las Cruces, New Mexico; Mimbres Memorial 
Hospital in Deming, New Mexico; Gila Regional Medical Center in Silver City, New Mexico; Providence Memorial Hospital in El 
Paso, Texas; Thomason Hospital in El Paso, Texas; Del Sol Medical Center in El Paso, Texas; Las Palmas Medical Center in El 
Paso, Texas; and University Medical Center in Lubbock, Texas. This list does not include free-standing imaging centers or 
radiology done in physician's offices. See Morgan, Strand, Wheeler & Biggs v. Radiology, Ltd., 924 F.2d 1484 (9th Cir. 1991). "
267,1," As a result of the merger, McKenzie's name changed to Cascade Health Solutions. For the purposes of this opinion, we, like 
the parties, continue to refer to Cascade Health Solutions  [**6] as McKenzie. "
268,2," In a preferred provider plan, health care providers contract with an insurer to provide health care to the insurer's customers. 
The insurer's customers pay much higher prices if they obtain services from providers other than those with whom their insurer 
has contracted. "
269,3," The focus in attempted monopolization cases on a defendant's ""specific intent"" to monopolize and on the ""dangerous 
probability"" that monopoly will result traces its roots to the Supreme Court's earliest pronouncements on the Sherman 
 [**12] Act. Over one hundred years ago, Justice Holmes explained that the Sherman Act permits claims against combinations in restraint of commerce among the states and against attempts to monopolize the same. Intent is 
almost essential to such a combination, and is essential to such an attempt. Where acts are not sufficient in themselves to 
produce a result which the law seeks to prevent--for instance, the monopoly,--but require further acts in addition to the mere 
forces of nature to bring that result to pass, an intent to bring it to pass is necessary in order to produce a dangerous 
probability that it will happen. But when that intent and the consequent dangerous probability exist, this statute, like many 
others, and like the common law in some cases, directs itself against that dangerous probability as well as against the 
completed result. Swift & Co. v. United States, 196 U.S. 375, 396, 25 S. Ct. 276, 49 L. Ed. 518 (1905) (citation omitted). By contrast, in 
monopolization cases, monopolistic intent can be inferred from the exclusionary conduct of a firm with monopoly power. United 
States v. Aluminum Co. of Am., 148 F.2d 416, 432 (2d Cir. 1945) (Hand, J.) (noting that, in a monopolization case, ""no intent is 
relevant  [**13] except that which is relevant to any liability, criminal or civil: i.e. an intent to bring about the forbidden act""); 
United States v. United Shoe Mach. Corp., 110 F. Supp. 295, 346 (D. Mass. 1953) (""Defendant intended to engage in the 
leasing practices and pricing policies which maintained its market power. That is all the intent which the law requires when both 
the complaint and the judgment rest on a charge of 'monopolizing', not merely 'attempting to monopolize'. Defendant having 
willed the means, has willed the end.""), aff'd, 347 U.S. 521, 74 S. Ct. 699, 98 L. Ed. 910 (1954). In attempted monopolization 
cases, though, the defendant firm ""has not yet achieved a position of power in the market but is trying to build up such a position. 
Being without power to exploit or exclude, such a firm must be shown to have a specific intent to achieve these results."" A.D. 
Neale & D.G. Goyder, The Antitrust Laws of the United States of America 93 (3d ed. 1980). "
270,4," For example, in the telecommunications field, it is common for companies to offer not only phone service, but also Internet 
access and television service, and many of these companies offer bundled discounts to customers who purchase their entire 
package. See Ken Belson, Dial M for Merger, N.Y. Times, Jan. 28, 2005, at C1; Ken Belson, Cable's Rivals Lure Customers with 
Packages, N.Y. Times, Nov. 22, 2004, at C1."
270,5," That bundled discounts are  [**17] a common feature of our current economic system is relevant to our analysis of allegedly 
anticompetitive conduct under § 2 of the Sherman Act. The Supreme Court, in assessing the stare decisis effect of its prior 
precedents under § 1 of the Sherman Act, recently noted that ""[f]rom the beginning the Court has treated the Sherman Act as a 
common-law statute,"" and that ""[j]ust as the common law adapts to modern understanding and greater experience, so too does 
the Sherman Act's prohibition on 'restraint[s] of trade' evolve to meet the dynamics of present economic conditions."" Leegin 
Creative Leather Prods., Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., 127 S. Ct. 2705, 2720, 168 L. Ed. 2d 623 (2007) (third alteration in original). The 
frequency with which we see bundled discounts in varied contexts does not insulate such discounts from antitrust review, but it 
heightens the need to ensure that the rule adopted does not expose inventive and legitimate forms of price competition to an 
overbroad liability standard."
270,6," The Supreme Court has recognized the principle that package pricing is usually procompetitive, noting that ""[b]uyers often find 
package sales attractive; a seller's decision to offer such packages can merely be an attempt to compete effectively--conduct 
that is entirely consistent with the Sherman Act."" Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 12, 104 S. Ct. 1551, 80 
L. Ed. 2d 2 (1984)."
270,7," The academic literature provides  [**19] other examples of ways in which sellers benefit from bundling. See, e.g., Crane,supra, 
55 Emory L.J. at 430-43 (suggesting sellers can use bundles to instill customer loyalty, lower net prices to consumers by 
eliminating multiple monopoly-price markups on complementary goods, and price discrimination); see also Antitrust "
271,," Modernization Comm'n, Report and Recommendations 95 (2007) (suggesting sellers can use bundled discounts to increase 
demand in lieu of advertising, encourage use of a new product, or enter a new market). "
272,8," Judge Scirica  [**27] and then-Judge Alito joined Judge Greenburg's dissent from the majority opinion. The Third Circuit 
reaffirmed the rule of LePage's in United States v. Dentsply Int'l, Inc., 399 F.3d 181, 187 (3d Cir. 2005). "
273,9," After oral argument, we issued an order inviting amicus briefing on the issue of whether a plaintiff seeking to establish the 
anticompetitive conduct element of an attempted monopolization claim by showing that the defendant offered bundled discounts 
must prove that the defendant's prices were below the defendant's costs. Cascade Health Solutions v. PeaceHealth, 479 F.3d 
726, 727 (9th Cir. 2007). We also sought input on the appropriate measure of costs if a plaintiff must prove below-cost pricing. 
Id. Finally, we asked amici who were arguing that a plaintiff should not be required to prove below-cost  [**29] pricing to suggest 
alternative standards for the trier of fact to use in determining whether bundled discounts are anticompetitive. Id. We thank the 
many amici who accepted our invitation for their thoughtful briefs."
273,10," Congress created the AMC in the Antitrust Modernization Commission Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-273, §§ 11051-60, 116 
Stat. 1758, 1856-59. The Act entrusted the AMC with four tasks: (1) soliciting the views of all parties concerned with the federal 
antitrust laws; (2) examining whether the antitrust laws needed modernization; (3) evaluating proposals to modernize the 
antitrust laws; and (4) submitting a report to the President and Congress containing a statement of the AMC's findings and 
conclusions and recommending any legislative or administrative action the AMC considered appropriate. See id. §§ 11053, 
11058. The procedure for appointing the twelve commissioners ensured that both major political parties were equally 
represented on the AMC. See  [**31] id. § 11054. "
275,11," Section 7 of the Clayton Act forbids acquisitions that ""substantially . . . lessen competition[ ] or tend to create a monopoly."" 15 
U.S.C. § 18. "
276,12," McKenzie contends that Brooke Group is not persuasive in this case because Brooke Group dealt with liability for primary-line 
price discrimination in violation of § 2(a) of the Robinson-Patman Act, whereas this case arises under § 2 of the Sherman Act. 
However, the Court made clear in Brooke Group that, whether a predatory pricing claim arises under § 2(a) of the Robinson-
Patman Act or § 2 of the Sherman Act, the concerns are essentially the same, noting that: There are, to be sure, differences between the two statutes. For example, we interpret § 2 of the Sherman Act to condemn 
predatory pricing when it poses ""a dangerous probability of actual monopolization,"" whereas the Robinson-Patman Act 
requires only that there be ""a reasonable possibility"" of substantial injury to competition before its protections  [**42] are 
triggered. But whatever additional flexibility the Robinson-Patman Act standard may imply, the essence of the claim under 
either statute is the same: A business rival has priced its products in an unfair manner with an object to eliminate or retard 
competition and thereby gain and exercise control over prices in the relevant market. Brooke Group, 509 U.S. at 222 (citations omitted)."
276,13," Of course, even if the exclusionary conduct element is satisfied by bundled discounts at price levels that yield a conclusion of 
below-cost sales, under the appropriate measure, there cannot be Sherman Act § 2 liability for attempted monopolization unless 
the other elements of a specific intent to monopolize and dangerous probability of success are satisfied. "
278,14," In the academic literature, this standard is sometimes referred to as a ""discount allocation"" or ""discount reallocation"" standard. 
See e.g., Daniel A. Crane, Multiproduct Discounting: A Myth of Nonprice Predation, 72 U. Chi. L. Rev. 27, 28 (2005)."
278,15," A variation of the example from Ortho illustrates how the discount attribution standard condemns discounts that could not be 
matched by an equally or more efficient producer of the competitive product. Recall that the example involves A, a firm that 
makes both shampoo and conditioner. A's incremental cost of shampoo is $ 1.50 and A's incremental cost of conditioner is $ 
2.50. A prices shampoo at $ 3 and conditioner at $ 5, if purchased separately. However, if purchased as a bundle, A prices 
shampoo at $ 2.25 and conditioner at $ 3. Purchased separately from A, the total price of one  [**51] unit of shampoo and one 
unit of conditioner is $ 8. However, with the bundled discount, a customer can purchase both products from A for $ 5.25, a 
discount of $ 2.75 off the separate prices, but at a price that is still above A's variable cost of producing the bundle. Applying the 
discount attribution rule to the example, we subtract the entire discount on the package of products, $ 2.75, from the separate 
per unit price of the competitive product, shampoo, $ 3. The resulting effective price of shampoo is thus $ 0.25, meaning that, if a 
customer must purchase conditioner from A at the separate price of $ 5, a rival who produces only shampoo must sell the 
shampoo for $ 0.25 to make customers indifferent between A's bundle and the separate purchase of conditioner from A and 
shampoo from the hypothetical rival. A's pricing scheme thus has the effect of excluding any potential rival who would produce 
only shampoo, and would produce it at an incremental cost above $ 0.25. However, as we noted above, A's incremental cost of 
producing shampoo is $ 1.50. Thus, A's pricing practices exclude potential competitors that could produce shampoo more 
efficiently than A (i.e., at an incremental cost  [**52] of less than $ 1.50). A's discount could thus be considered exclusionary 
under our rule, supporting Sherman Act § 2 liability if the other elements were proved. "
279,16," Professor Nalebuff identifies the practical problem of calculating a rival firm's costs as a compelling argument in favor of a 
standard that focuses on whether  [**56] bundled discounts would exclude a hypothetical equally efficient competitor: "
280,," There is . . . a practical problem in determining if a rival firm is equally efficient or not. The problem is compounded for the 
monopolist who is looking for a bright line test to know whether its bundled pricing might be exclusionary or not. The 
solution to both these problems is to pick the monopolist itself as the equally efficient rival. Nalebuff, supra, 50 Antitrust Bull. at 330."
280,17," Although the volume of case law dealing with bundled discounting is small, one thirty-year-old case shows that antitrust claims 
based on bundled discounting practices are nothing new under the sun. See SmithKline Corp. v. Eli Lilly & Co., 427 F. Supp. 
1089, 1124 (E.D. Pa. 1976), aff'd, 575 F.2d 1056 (3d Cir. 1978)."
280,18," A 1975 article by Professors Areeda and Turner ignited the modern debate about predatory pricing, see Phillip Areeda & 
Donald F. Turner, Predatory Pricing and Related Practices Under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 88 Harv. L. Rev. 697 (1975), 
and many prominent antitrust scholars weighed in on the topic in the following decade-and-a-half. See, e.g., Robert H. Bork, The 
Antitrust Paradox 154-55 (1978); George A. Hay, Predatory Pricing, 58 Antitrust L.J. 913 (1989); Frank H. Easterbrook, 
Predatory Strategies and Counterstrategies, 48 U. Chi. L. Rev. 263 (1981); Paul L. Joskow & Alvin K. Klevorick,  [**59] A 
Framework for Analyzing Predatory Pricing Policy, 89 Yale L.J. 213 (1979); William J. Baumol, Quasi-Permanence of Price 
Reductions: A Policy for Prevention of Predatory Pricing, 89 Yale L.J. 1 (1979); Oliver E. Williamson, Predatory Pricing: A 
Strategic and Welfare Analysis, 87 Yale L.J. 284 (1977); see also Wesley J. Leibeler, Whither Predatory Pricing? From Areeda 
and Turner to Matsushita, 61 Notre Dame L. Rev. 1052 (1986) (discussing the history of predatory pricing theory in the courts 
and academic literature). "
281,19," At least one circuit has held that average total cost, not average variable cost, is the appropriate baseline for determining 
predation. See McGahee v. N. Propane Gas Co., 858 F.2d 1487, 1500 (11th Cir. 1988).  [**62] However, such an approach is 
inconsistent with the Supreme Court's instruction in Brooke Group that predatory prices are those below ""'some measure of 
incremental cost.'"" Brooke Group, 509 U.S. at 223 (quoting Cargill, 479 U.S. at 117-18 n.12) (emphasis added). As the Antitrust 
Law treatise explains: In the ordinary case a predator increases output out of existing facilities, cutting the price to predatory levels. For this 
reason the Supreme Court has emphasized that predators must have excess capacity from which to produce the increased 
output. But in that case, the only ""incremental"" cost of the predation is variable costs."
281,3," Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra, P 741c at 444 (2d ed. 2002) (footnote omitted)."
281,20," In a number of cases decided before Brooke Group, we held that pricing below marginal cost or average variable cost 
provided evidence that a pricing scheme was predatory, but also held that that mode of proof was not exclusive. See 
Transamerica Computer Co. v. IBM Corp., 698 F.2d 1377, 1385 (9th Cir. 1983); Inglis, 668 F.2d at 1033. We suggested that an 
above-cost pricing policy could be predatory if accompanied by evidence of predatory intent, market power, or ""long-run 
behavior."" See Transamerica, 698 F.2d at 1387. Other circuits rejected the notion that predation could be proved through 
evidence of intent alone, see, e.g., Barry Wright, 724 F.2d at 232, and Brooke Group 's holding that ""a plaintiff seeking to 
establish competitive injury resulting from a rival's low prices must prove that the prices complained of are below an appropriate 
measure of its rival's costs"" put to rest any notion that predation can be proven through evidence of intent alone, Brooke Group, 
509 U.S. at 222. "
282,21," As we noted above, the AMC's proposed standard in bundled discounting cases, in addition to requiring below-cost pricing, 
also contains two further proposed elements. The second element proposed by the AMC is that there is a dangerous probability that the defendant will recoup its investment 
in the bundled discounting program. AMC Report, supra, at 99. This requirement, adopted from Brooke Group, is imported from 
the single product predatory pricing context, but we think imported incorrectly. We do not believe that the recoupment 
requirement from single product cases translates to multi-product discounting cases. Single-product predatory pricing, unlike 
bundling, necessarily  [**65] involves a loss for the defendant. For a period of time, the defendant must sell below its cost, with 
the intent to eliminate its competitors so that, when its competition is eliminated, the defendant can charge supracompetitive 
prices, recouping its losses and potentially more. By contrast, as discussed above, exclusionary bundling does not necessarily 
involve any loss of profits for the bundled discounter. See Nalebuff, supra, 50 Antitrust Bull. at 327. As the example from Ortho 
illustrates, a bundled discounter can exclude its rivals who do not sell as many product lines even when the bundle as a whole, 
and the individual products within it, are priced above the discounter's incremental cost to produce them. The trier of fact can 
identify cases that present this possibility for anticompetitive exclusion by applying the discount attribution standard outlined 
above. Under that standard, the ultimate question is whether the bundled discount would exclude an equally efficient rival. But 
because discounts on all products in the bundle have been allocated to the competitive product in issue, a conclusion of below-
cost sales under the discount attribution standard may occur in some cases  [**66] even where there is not an actual loss 
because the bundle is sold at a price exceeding incremental cost. In such a case, we do not think it is analytically helpful to think 
in terms of recoupment of a loss that did not occur. The third element proposed by the AMC is that ""the bundled discount or rebate program has had or is likely to have an adverse 
effect on competition."" AMC Report, supra, at 99. We view this final element as redundant because it is no different than the 
general requirement of ""antitrust injury"" that a plaintiff must prove in any private antitrust action. See Brunswick, 429 U.S. at 489 
(defining antitrust injury as ""injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes 
defendants' acts unlawful"" and noting that ""[t]he injury should reflect the anticompetitive effect either of the violation or of 
anticompetitive acts made possible by the violation""). For these reasons, while adopting the AMC's proposal to require belowcost sales to prove exclusionary conduct, we do not 
adopt the element of recoupment, which we think may be inapplicable in some cases, and we do not adopt the element of 
""adverse effect on competition"" as we  [**67] think that is superfluous in light of the general and pre-existing requirement of 
antitrust injury under Brunswick."
282,22," PeaceHealth also argues that because the jury found in its favor on McKenzie's claim of exclusive dealing under § 1 of the 
Sherman Act, it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on McKenzie's claim of attempted monopolization under § 2 of the 
Sherman Act. Our vacatur of the jury's verdict on the attempted monopolization claim makes it unnecessary for us to fully 
address that argument. However, we previously have held that ""[t]he 'predatory or anticompetitive conduct' element of § 2 "
283,," attempt, like the conduct element of monopolization, encompasses more than violations of § 1."" Cal. Computer Prods., Inc. v. 
IBM Corp., 613 F.2d 727, 737 (9th Cir. 1979). Specifically, § 1 is limited to concerted activity, while § 2 reaches unilateral 
exclusive conduct. See id.; Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 70."
283,23," A § 1 violation can also occur when the customer promises not to take the tied product from the defendant's competitor, but 
courts ""rarely encounter[ ]"" such a situation. 10 Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra, P 1752c n.8 at 263 (2d ed. 2004)."
283,24," For criticism of the leverage theory, see Bork, supra, at 372. See also Christopher R. Leslie, Cutting Through Tying Theory 
With Occam's Razor: A Simple Explanation of Tying Arrangements, 78 Tul. L. Rev. 727, 731-41 (2004) (summarizing the conflict 
between leverage theorists and the Chicago School). "
285,25," McKenzie has filed a motion to strike portions of PeaceHealth's brief citing to evidence that insurers had alternatives to taking 
all services from PeaceHealth because the evidence PeaceHealth cites was not in the portion of the record designated to the 
district court on summary judgment. Specifically, McKenzie argues that we should not permit PeaceHealth on appeal to refer to 
portions of exhibits that, while submitted to the district court in support of PeaceHealth's motion for summary judgment, did not 
have their relevant portions highlighted for the district court. Under the district court's Local Rule 56.1(c)(3), the moving party is required to highlight relevant portions of documents 
presented to the court, and under Local Rule 56.1(e), ""the Court has no independent duty to search and consider any part of the 
court record not otherwise referenced in the separate concise statements of the parties."" D. Or. R. 56.1. However, all  [**77] of 
the documents cited by PeaceHealth on appeal were before the district court, even if not highlighted. Moreover, the principal 
policy underlying local rules like Rule 56.1 is to obviate the need for the district court to search the record for facts relevant to 
summary judgment. Delange v. Dutra Constr., Co., 183 F.3d 916, 919 n.2 (9th Cir. 1999) (per curiam). Such a policy has no 
impact on the scope of our appellate review. See Fed. R. App. P. 10(a) (stating that the record on appeal consists of all papers 
and exhibits filed in the district court). We therefore deny McKenzie's motion to strike portions of PeaceHealth's combined brief. "
286,26," The Supreme Court has also held that the unique character of the tying product can provide a basis for holding that a 
defendant has sufficient economic power in the tying product market to coerce acceptance of the tied product. See U.S. Steel 
Corp. v. Fortner Enters., Inc., 429 U.S. 610, 619 (1977), 97 S. Ct. 861, 51 L. Ed. 2d 80 [hereinafter Fortner II] (citing N. Pac. Ry. 
Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 78 S. Ct. 514, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1958); Int'l Salt Co. v. United States, 332 U.S. 392, 68 S. Ct. 12, 
92 L. Ed. 20 (1947)). The Court in Fortner II recognized that the key question in establishing sufficient market power is whether 
the seller has some cost advantage not shared by its competitors which makes its competitors unable  [**81] to provide the tying 
product and that a mere showing that its competitors did not want to provide the tying product is insufficient to establish an illegal 
tie. Id. at 621-22. At the summary judgment stage, the evidence presented by McKenzie was sufficient to create a factual issue 
about whether McKenzie could not provide tertiary services or whether it was simply unwilling, as a matter of business strategy, 
to provide tertiary services."
286,27," If, on remand, McKenzie stakes its tying claim not on a theory that PeaceHealth explicitly (e.g., by contract) or implicitly 
coerced insurers to purchase primary and secondary services from PeaceHealth as a condition to obtaining tertiary services, but 
on a theory that PeaceHealth's bundled discounts effectively left insurers with no rational economic choice other than purchasing 
tertiary services from PeaceHealth, such a claim might raise the question of whether, to establish the coercion element of a tying 
claim through a bundled discount, McKenzie must prove that PeaceHealth priced below a relevant measure of its costs. Some 
commentators would require a plaintiff alleging that a bundled discount amounts to an illegal tie to prove below-cost prices. 
 [**82] See, e.g., 3 Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra, P 749b2 at 334 (Supp. 2006). It is unclear whether the AMC intended its three-
part test to apply when a plaintiff alleging an illegal tying arrangement asserts that the defendant's pricing practices coerced 
unwanted purchases of the tied product. See AMC Report, supra, at 114 n.157 (""The recommended three-part test is proposed 
here for challenges to bundled pricing practices, and its purpose, as the text explains, is to avoid deterring procompetitive price 
reductions. The Commission is not recommending application of this test outside the bundled pricing context, for example in 
tying or exclusive dealing cases. The Commission did not undertake to study tying and exclusive dealing issues more 
generally.""). The parties have not briefed this issue to us, and the parties did not raise the issue before the district court. We 
therefore leave it to the district court, if necessary, to decide the issue in the first instance on remand. Singleton v. Wulff, 428 
U.S. 106, 121, 96 S. Ct. 2868, 49 L. Ed. 2d 826 (1976). "
287,28," In No. 05-35627, we also decline to address McKenzie's Noerr-Pennington arguments because these related to an evidentiary 
ruling and the issue may not arise on a retrial. Further, we hold that the district court's jury instruction on combination or 
conspiracy was not an abuse of discretion. "
292,1," The remaining five claims arose under the federal antitrust laws for: monopolization, attempted monopolization, conspiracy to 
monopolize, tying, and exclusive dealing. "
293,2," As a result of the merger, McKenzie's name changed to Cascade Health Solutions. For the purposes of this order, we, like the 
parties, continue to refer to Cascade Health Solutions as McKenzie."
293,3," In a preferred provider plan, health care providers contract with an insurer to provide health care to the insurer's customers. 
The insurer's customers pay much higher prices if they obtain services from providers other than those with whom their insurer 
has contracted. "
294,4," HN1[
] Price discrimination claims can take three forms: primary line, secondary line, or tertiary line. Primary-line price 
discrimination includes conduct, like predatory pricing, that injures the direct competitors of the discriminating seller. See Volvo 
Trucks N. Am., Inc. v. Reeder-Simco GMC, Inc., 546 U.S. 164, 126 S. Ct. 860, 870, 163 L. Ed. 2d 663 (2006). "
295,5," The Oregon statute provides: HN2[
] It is unlawful for any person engaged in commerce or food commerce, or both, in the course of such commerce, 
either directly or indirectly, to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities, or services or output of a 
service trade, of like grade and quality or to discriminate in price between different sections, communities or cities or 
portions thereof or between different  [**13] locations in sections, communities, cities or portions thereof in this state, where 
the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of 
commerce, or to injure, destroy or prevent competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit 
of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them. Or. Rev. Stat. § 646.040(1)."
295,6," The Robinson-Patman Act provides: HN3[
] It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, either directly or 
indirectly, to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality, where either or any 
of the purchases involved in such discrimination are in commerce, where such commodities are sold for use, consumption, "
296,," or resale within the United States or any Territory thereof or the District of Columbia or any insular possession or other 
place under the jurisdiction of the United States, and where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen 
competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any 
person who either grants  [**14] or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of either of 
them . . . ."

296,7," HN4[
] In Brooke Group, a primary-line price discrimination case brought under the Robinson-Patman Act, the Supreme 
Court  [**15] held that, in a single product predatory pricing case, a plaintiff must prove (1) below-cost pricing and (2) likelihood 
of recoupment regardless of ""whether the claim alleges predatory pricing under § 2 of the Sherman Act or primary-line price 
discrimination under the Robinson-Patman Act."" Brooke Group Ltd., 509 U.S. at 222."
296,8," Even though this course of action was not suggested by either party, we may properly certify this question sua sponte. See Or. 
Rev. Stat. § 28.205 (2005). "
300,1," In this recent Bell Atlantic Corp. case, the United States Supreme Court rejected the language previously used by the Court in 
Conley v. Gibson, providing that ""[i]n appraising the sufficiency of the complaint we follow, of course, the accepted rule that a 
complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of 
facts in support of his claim which would entitle  [*9] him to relief."" 355 U.S. 41, 45- 46, 78 S. Ct. 99, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957). See 
Bell Atlantic Corp., 127 S.Ct. at 1969 (holding that the Conley ""no set of facts"" language ""has earned its retirement"" and ""is best 
forgotten.""). "
301,2," Plaintiffs contest  [*12] that a determination of whether antitrust injury has been adequately pled should not occur first because 
such analysis requires understanding the particulars of the antitrust violations alleged. The Court has considered Plaintiffs' 
arguments, but will follow the instructive case law from the United States Supreme Court and the Sixth Circuit in first addressing 
the requirement of standing, that is, whether Plaintiffs have sufficiently pled any antitrust injury. Taking into account Plaintiffs' 
concerns, however, the Court will consider the particulars of their antitrust allegations in making this determination. "
306,1," The MRL ""regulates relations between the owners and the residents of mobilehome parks."" (Cacho v. Boudreau (2007) 40 
Cal.4th 341, 345;  [*5] see also SC Manufactured Homes, Inc. v. Canyon View Estates, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 673.) "
307,2, Three of the dismissed defendants also were associated with Parklane. They are not parties to the present appeal.
307,3," Defendant Stanley Affordable Homes, Inc. and Stanley Wactler have not appeared on appeal. "
309,4," In the September 12, 2001, letter to plaintiff, Parklane stated that ""[u]nder California law one company may refuse to do 
business with another  [*13] company. . . . [P] . . . [P] [Parklane] has conducted business with many mobilehome dealers in your 
area . . . [with whom Parklane] has . . . had professional and cordial relationships . . . . [P] By contrast, your company has been 
extremely difficult for [Parklane] to conduct business with. For example, you have made false statements regarding [Parklane's 
owner and operator] and you have made derogatory comments to tenants about the park itself. In addition, you have refused to 
sign an arbitration agreement regarding disputes that may arise involving your company, although many other dealers have 
signed similar agreements. As a result of all of the above, [Parklane] has no interest in conducting business with you or your 
company. [P] I want to make clear that [Parklane] has no objection to you representing any tenant or prospective tenant with 
respect to the sale or purchase of any new or used mobilehome at the park. However, [Parklane] does have an objection to 
doing business with you and your firm and therefore has decided it can no longer rent space to you or your company to sell your 
mobilehomes from [the park]. [P] In conclusion, although you are free to conduct business with  [*14] tenants and prospective 
tenants with respect to their mobilehomes at Parklane, you and your company will no longer be able to rent space at the park for 
the purpose of selling your mobilehomes."" (Original emphasis.)"
309,5," ""A [mobilehome] owner typically rents a plot of land, called a 'pad,' from the owner of a [mobilehome] park. The park owner 
provides private roads within the park, common facilities such as washing machines or a swimming pool, and often utilities. 
 [*16] The [mobilehome] owner often invests in site-specific improvements such as a driveway, steps, walkways, porches, or 
landscaping."" (Yee v. City of Escondido (1992) 503 U.S. 519, 523.) "
310,6," The February 11, 2003, letter read in part: ""[In your recent letter] you indicate that you have sold a new mobilehome for 
installation . . . at space No. 19 in the proposed new section at the park[ to a prospective tenant]. [P] [Parklane has] had no 
discussions with you . . . regarding the development of that space, or any other space in the proposed new section . . . . [P] 
[Thus, Parklane] can only conclude that you have either misrepresented the facts to [the prospective tenant] or are otherwise 
engaging in unfair and deceptive business practices. Because it is uncertain . . . when or if space No. 19 will be developed, you 
are respectfully requested to cease making false representations to third parties regarding that space. . . . [P] [Parklane has] 
begun development of the common areas [of] those 29 new mobilehome spaces at the park . . . . However, [Parklane has] 
decided it does not make economic sense to proceed with the development of the actual  [*18] spaces unless and until [it 
obtains] contributions from one or more joint venturers, to offset part of the development costs. [Parklane expects] the financial 
contributions from such joint venturers to be approximately $ 30,000 per space, plus the cost of certain permits, fees, utility 
systems and improvements. [P] [Presently,] no development agreement has been entered into with respect to even one of the 
proposed new spaces at the park. [Also, Parklane has not established minimum construction standards or projected the rent to 
be charged for the new spaces.] [P] It is hard to imagine that [the prospective tenant] would have committed to buying a new 
mobilehome at space No. 19 . . . without knowing . . . whether that space will be . . . developed[,] when and if she will be able to 
take possession[,] what the minimum construction standards will be and [,] how much rent she will have to pay. Accordingly, 
[Parklane has] concluded that you have either misrepresented the facts to [the prospective tenant], or you are simply trying to 
'set up' [Parklane] for litigation. [P] [I]n my letter of September 12, 2001, . . . I advised you . . . [that Parklane has] no interest in 
doing business with  [*19] you . . . . The misrepresentations you apparently have made to [the prospective tenant] only 
reinforces [Parklane's] belief that it would be a mistake to do business with . . . you. . . . [P] . . . Because no development 
agreements have been entered into as of this date, [the prospective tenant] is welcome to retain a contractor (other than you) to 
enter into a development agreement for space No. 19, pursuant to the same terms and conditions that [Parklane intends] to offer 
to all other potential developers. If [the prospective tenant] is willing to develop the space and contribute to the costs of 
construction, she would then presumably be in a position to place a new mobilehome on that space . . . . [A]lthough [Parklane] 
will not enter into a development agreement with you, if [the prospective tenant develops the property] [Parklane] would not 
object to her or her contractor purchasing the mobilehome for that space from you . . . ."" (Original emphasis.) "
311,7, Health and Safety Code section 18035.3 mandates certain disclosures by dealers of mobilehomes when selling mobilehomes.
311,8," Plaintiff stated, ""Contrary to defendants' assertions, plaintiff . . . is not asking to be given the right to place models in the park 
for sale (and . . . occupy land). He is merely requesting that prospective tenants be allowed to purchase their homes from him."" 
On appeal, plaintiff reiterates that this lawsuit is not about his request to  [*24] model and sell mobilehomes from Parklane. "
312,9," It does not appear that the trial court ruled on Parklane's request for judicial notice. However, we examine the pleadings de 
novo. The documents submitted are official records of which  [*25] we may take judicial notice (Evid. Code, § 452, subds. (c), 
(g), (h); Rodas v. Spiegel (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 513, 518 [records, reports, and orders of administrative agencies are ""official 
acts"" of which court may take judicial notice]; Sanchez v. City of Modesto (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 660, 666, fn. 1 [judicial notice 
of facts in census]; Moehring v. Thomas (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 1515, 1523, fn. 4 [same].) "
313,10," ""Many cases state that [Business and Professions Code] section 16720  [*29] was patterned after section 1 of the Sherman 
Act [15 U.S.C. § 1] and that federal law construing section 1 is applicable to resolve problems arising under section 16720. 
[Citations.]"" (Morrison v. Viacom, Inc., supra, 66 Cal.App.4th at p. 541, fn. 2.) This is because section 1 of the Sherman Act and 
section 16720 of the Cartwright Act cover similar areas and both are designed to foster competition. (Fisherman's Wharf Bay 
Cruise Corp. v. Superior Court, supra, 114 Cal.App.4th at p. 334.) However, in State of California ex rel. Van de Kamp v. 
Texaco, Inc., supra, 46 Cal.3d 1147, the Supreme Court concluded that unlike its federal counterpart, the Cartwright Act did not 
apply to mergers. In reaching this conclusion, the Supreme Court at page 1168, ""stated that 'the Sherman Act is not, contrary to 
our past statements, directly probative on interpretation of the Cartwright Act.' Though not always directly probative of the 
Cartwright Act drafters' intent, judicial interpretations of the Sherman Act are, nevertheless, often helpful because of the similarity 
in language and purpose between the federal and state statutes. [Citations.].)"" (Morrison v. Viacom, Inc., supra, at p. 541, fn. 2; 
see  [*30] also Freeman v. San Diego Assn. of Realtors (1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 171, 183, fn. 9.) "
314,11," Thus, plaintiff is foreclosed from arguing on appeal that the allegations in his complaint constitute an illegal tying arrangement 
based upon the rule of reason."
314,12," Business and Professions Code section 16720 reads in part: ""A trust is a combination of capital, skill or acts by two or more 
persons for any of the following purposes: [P] (a) To create or carry out restrictions in trade or commerce."" Business and Professions Code section 16726 declares that ""every trust is unlawful, against public policy and void."""
314,13," During the hearing on the demurrers, the following occurred: ""The Court: [A] tenant can come in -- as you just said -- a tenant can come in and can move into an old unit. ""[Plaintiff's counsel]: Correct. ""The Court: Or they can move into an old unit and then decide they're going to replace it with another unit. ""[Plaintiff's counsel]: I'm not sure about that, but that's for another day. I haven't alleged that in the complaint. It's not at 
issue. I don't know if that's ever happened."" "
315,14," Plaintiff identified only four vacant spaces that did not require dealer pullouts. These purportedly were reserved to respondent 
Macy Homes, Inc., who placed homes on three of the lots to model. However, plaintiff refused to pay rent for the time his homes 
would be placed on Parklane spaces, has abandoned his plea to model homes, and Parklane was not obligated to allow plaintiff 
to  [*36] place his homes in the park without paying rent."
315,15," Plaintiff alleged that defendant and respondent San Jose Advantage Homes, Inc. began advertising the spaces in the new 
section of the park at the end of February 2003, after the February 11, 2003, letter. This allegation was supported by a copy of 
an undated advertisement, Exhibit 14. Parklane states on appeal that plaintiff may not mislead the court by making false 
allegations in his  [*37] complaint. Parklane states that ""[b]ecause [p]laintiff's counsel had been allowed to discover all 29 joint 
venture agreements prior to the March 7, 2006 hearing, he knew that none of the joint venture agreement[s] had been entered 
into prior to February 11, 2003 and that the last joint venture agreement was not entered into until November 6, 2003."" (Original 
emphasis.) As noted in Exhibit 1, the February 11, 2003 letter, addressed plaintiff's accusation that he was not permitted to sell a 
mobilehome to a prospective tenant who wished to occupy space No. 19 in the new section of the park. (See fn. 6.) However, 
according, to plaintiff's exhibits and allegations, this space was not offered for sale by San Jose Advantage Homes, Inc. in 
February 2003 and San Jose Advantage Homes, Inc. did not sell a mobilehome for that space until December 2003. "
316,16," Plaintiff's counsel conceded that the ability to develop the property was based on affordability, not a conspiratorial agreement. 
Counsel stated at oral argument on the demurrers: ""The [spaces in the new section of the park - defendant and respondent San 
Jose Advantage Homes, Inc.] was the highest  [*40] bidder of the dealers for those spaces. None of the other dealers seem to 
be able to afford the 30 thousand dollars a space. So [San Jose Advantage Homes, Inc.] was assigned all of those spaces - all 
29 spaces. [P] . . . [P] . . . Whoever paid the most for those spaces could reserve those spaces themselves. It happened to be 
[San Jose Advantage Homes, Inc.]."""
316,17," Business and Professions Code section 16727 also prohibits some types of tying arrangements. It reads: ""It shall be unlawful 
for any person to lease or make a sale or contract for the sale of goods, merchandise, machinery, supplies, commodities for use 
within the State, or to fix a price charged therefor, or discount from, or rebate upon, such price, on the condition, agreement or 
understanding that the lessee or purchaser thereof shall not use or deal in the goods, merchandise, machinery, supplies, 
commodities, or services of a competitor or competitors of the lessor or seller, where the effect of such lease, sale, or contract 
for  [*41] sale or such condition, agreement or understanding may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a 
monopoly in any line of trade or commerce in any section of the State."" Business and Professions Code section 16727 is not applicable because the alleged tying product is real property. (Suburban, 
supra, 101 Cal.App.3d at pp. 549-550; People v. Mobile Magic Sales, Inc. (1979) 96 Cal.App.3d 1, 10; Morrison v. Viacom, Inc., 
supra, 66 Cal.App.4th at pp. 546-547.) Plaintiff asserts that the focus of the Cartwright Act is on protection of the consumer, whereas the Sherman Act focuses on 
prevention of monopolies. Plaintiff notes that the Cartwright Act (Bus. & Prof. Code, §§ 16700-16760) does not contain the 
explicit prohibition against monopolization as is contained in the Sherman Act, 15 United States Code section 2, or mentioned in 
the last phrase of Business and Professions Code section 16727. Plaintiff then asserts that many cases discussing tying 
arrangements inartfully meld together the two concepts of protecting consumers and monopolization, without realizing their 
inherent distinctions. Then, plaintiff argues that the focus of his case is on protecting the consumer, who  [*42] incurred 
significant injury by paying elevated prices for the mobilehomes purchased for placement in Parklane. However, this case is 
resolved by analyzing plaintiff's allegations that there is a per se illegal tying arrangement violative of section 16720. We 
conclude that plaintiff cannot establish the tie between the spaces and the purchase of mobilehomes. Thus, the distinction 
plaintiff makes is not significant. "
317,18," The rationale in Fortner I, supra, 394 U.S. 495 was rejected in Fortner II, U.S. Steel Corp. v. Fortner Enterprises (1977) 429 
U.S. 610, 622 (Fortner II). ""After the Court remanded the suit in Fortner I, a bench trial resulted in judgment for the plaintiff, and 
the case eventually made its way back to [the United States Supreme Court]. Upon return, [in Fortner II, the United States 
Supreme Court] unanimously held that the plaintiff's failure of proof on the issue of market power was fatal to its case . . . ."" 
(Illinois Tool Works Inc. v. Independent Ink, Inc., supra, 547 U.S. at p. 36.) In Lessig v. Tidewater Oil Company, supra, 327 F.2d 459, the Ninth Circuit relied on Loew's to observe that market power may 
be "" 'inferred.' "" (Id. at p. 470.) Lessig was also abrogated by Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan (1993) 506 U.S. 447 [discussing 
15 U.S.C. § 2  [*47] and attempt to monopolize]. "
333,1," Currently American Pan manufactures and sells custom bun and roll pans, specialty cake pans and applies nonstick coatings 
to pans. (Bundy Dep. 9.) Chicago Metallic currently manufactures the stock pans that were previously manufactured by 
American Pan. (Id. 9-10.) "

341,3, CM Packaging is the part of Chicago Metallic that was not sold to American Pan in 2005. 
348,1," The named Commissioners are Michael Denning, Bruce Gilmore, Larry Wheatley, Quincy Mosby, and Francisco Sanchez. 
(Sanchez is not named as a defendant in Counts IV and V)."
348,2," The Complaint additionally alleges violations of the federal anti-racketeering statute (RICO), 18 U.S.C. § 1962, et seq.; denial 
of due process and equal protection in violation of the Federal Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1983; retaliation for the exercise of 
free speech; civil conspiracy; two counts of tortious interference with contractual and prospective business relations; two counts 
of breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and a demand for specific performance of a Memorandum of 
Understanding."
348,3," An FBO is a service center at an airport that provides services such as fuel, oil, and hangar storage. "
350,4," The court is aware that in two pre-Interface cases, the district court declined to apply state action immunity. In the  [**10] first of 
the cases, Judge Wolf held that a plaintiff airline could maintain a Sherman Act claim against the county airport in Martha's 
Vineyard for its refusal to grant a commercial carrier landing rights. See New York Airlines, Inc. v. Dukes County, 623 F. Supp. 
1435 (D. Mass. 1985). In his analysis of defendants' assertion that they were shielded from antitrust claims by state action 
immunity, Judge Wolf considered Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 90, §§ 51E-52, and ruled that ""there is no indication that anticompetitive 
conduct is necessary to the statutory scheme."" Id. at 1451-1452. Judge Wolf employed a two-part test: first, there must be a 
clearly articulated state policy, and second, the policy must be actively supervised by the State. Id. at 1451, citing California 
Retail Liquor Dealers Ass'n v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U.S. 97, 105, 100 S. Ct. 937, 63 L. Ed. 2d 233 (1980). It must be 
noted, however, that the second prong of the test relied upon by Judge Wolf was rejected by the Supreme Court in Hallie, 471 
U.S. at 47. In the second (unpublished) opinion, Trustees of A.J. Bremen Realty Trust v. City of Boston, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21856, 1985 
WL 6083 (D. Mass. March 12, 1985), plaintiffs alleged that they were denied a parking lot license as the result  [**11] of an 
antitrust conspiracy involving the City, Massport, and the Commissioner of Traffic and Parking. 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21856, 
[WL] at *1. Judge Mazzone denied defendant's motion to dismiss, ruling that while ""Massport may have authority to conduct 
studies and to operate a remote parking facility, and the City of Boston may have the authority to study or grant licenses to 
operate parking lots, this power does not amount to clear policy to displace competition in parking lot operations."" 1985 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 21856, [WL] at *2 (internal citations omitted). "
351,5," In Union Pacific, the City of Kansas City owned and operated a wholesale produce market at a railroad terminal owned by the 
railroad. The City granted rebates to sellers who agreed to move into the new terminal. 313 U.S. at 465-466. Plaintiffs argued 
that the rebates were in violation of the Elkins Act because the motive was to divert produce traffic from other railroads to Union 
Pacific. Id. at 460-461."
351,6," In Omni Outdoor, the Court rejected a challenge to certain zoning statutes, finding that the foreseeable  [**14] result test was 
amply met, as the purpose of the zoning regulations was to ""displace unfettered business freedom in a manner that regularly has 
the effect of preventing normal acts of competition, particularly on the part of new entrants."" 499 U.S. at 373. The Court 
additionally found that state action immunity applied despite proof of a conspiracy between city officials and a private actor 
because the Sherman Act ""condemns trade restraints, not political activity."" Id. at 379 (citation omitted)."
351,7," Defendants additionally argue that they are entitled to implied immunity because Rectrix's Sherman Act claim presents a 
potentially serious conflict with rules and regulations established and enforced by the FAA. The Supreme Court has set out four 
factors to be used in determining whether a ""clear repugnancy"" between a Sherman Act claim and an agency's regulations 
preclude the application of the antitrust laws. A court must evaluate: (1) whether the possible conflict affects practices that lie 
squarely within an area of activity that aviation law seeks to regulate; (2) the existence of regulatory authority under aviation law 
to supervise the activities in question; (3) evidence  [**16] that the FAA exercises that authority; and (4) a resulting risk that 
aviation law and antitrust law, if both applicable, would produce conflicting guidance, requirements, duties, privileges, or "
352,," standards of conduct. Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC v. Billing, 127 S.Ct. 2383, 2392, 168 L. Ed. 2d 145 (2007). There is no 
need for the court to decide whether implied immunity applies, given its ruling on defendants' claim of state action immunity. "
357,1, All references to the Wisconsin Statutes are to the 2005-06 version unless otherwise noted. 
360,2," This argument appears disingenuous given that Ferrante was trained by ""superior surgeons with decades of experience"" and 
apparently became so skilled and respected that they offered him a partnership."
360,3," We note the evidence that a conspiracy to boycott Heart Surgeons actually existed is purely circumstantial, and the inference is 
not particularly strong because Cardiology Associates continued to provide referrals to Heart Surgeons after Ferrante's 
departure, until it was sued. See Tunica Web Adver. v. Tunica Casino Operators Ass'n, 496 F.3d 403, 409 (5th Cir. 2007); 
Betkerur v. Aultman Hosp. Ass'n, 78 F.3d 1079, 1090 (6th Cir. 1996). "

371,2," The Motions decided in this Report are among seven separate Motions for Summary Judgment filed by Defendants against five 
individual consumer Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs (""IP Plaintiffs"") and three third-party payor IP Plaintiffs. In the Reports deciding 
these motions, Defendants' opening and reply memoranda of law in support of each separate motion will be cited, respectively, 
as ""Def. Br. (Plaintiff name) at    ,"" and ""Def. Reply (Plaintiff name) at    ."" Defendants' Omnibus Reply Memorandum of Law in 
Further Support of Their Motion for Summary Judgment Against Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs  [*10] will be cited as ""Def. Reply at 
   ."" Plaintiffs' omnibus Memorandum of Law and Surreply Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendants' Motions for 
Summary Judgment will be cited, respectively, as ""Pl. Br. at    "" and ""Pl. Surreply at    ."""
371,3," In addition to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, Defendants' Motions are also subject to Rule 56.1 of the Local Rules of the United States 
District Court for the District of New Jersey, which requires that HN2[
] ""[o]n motions for summary judgment, each side shall furnish a statement which sets forth material facts as to which there exists or does not exist a genuine issue."" D.N.J. L. Civ. R. 
56.1. Pursuant to Local Rule 56.1, Defendants submitted separate Statements of Material Facts as to each IP Plaintiff against whom 
Defendants have moved for summary judgment, and Plaintiffs submitted Responses to each of those Statements of Material 
Facts. (Defendants' Statements of Material Facts as to the IP Plaintiffs will be cited as ""Def. Stmt. (Plaintiff name) at P    ; 
Plaintiffs' Responses thereto will be cited as ""Pl. Resp. Stmt. (Plaintiff name) at P   "").  [*12] Defendants also submitted 
Supplemental Statements of Material Facts as to certain of the IP Plaintiffs. (Defendants' Supplemental Statements of Fact will 
be cited as ""Def. Suppl. Stmt. (Plaintiff name) at P    ). Finally, Plaintiffs submitted an omnibus Statement of Material Facts in 
Opposition to Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment, to which Defendants submitted a Response. (Plaintiffs' omnibus 
Statement of Material Facts will be cited as ""Pl. Stmt. at P    ; Defendants' Response will be cited as ""Def. Resp. Stmt. at P    ""). "
372,4," In their omnibus Surreply Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment, the IP Plaintiffs 
suggest that Defendants bear the burden of negating the injury element of Plaintiffs' claims. See Pl. Surreply at 3 (stating that 
""the summary judgment rules put the burden on Defendants to prove the absence of injury"" and ""[t]he burden remains on 
Defendants to show that there are no disputed facts on summary judgment and that there is no injury. . . ."") (italics in original). 
Such a suggestion overstates a moving party's summary judgment burden with respect to an issue on which the nonmoving 
party bears the ultimate burden of proof. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325 (where the nonmoving party bears the burden of proof on 
an issue, the moving party's burden on summary judgment ""may  [*14] be discharged by 'showing' -- that is, pointing out to the 
district court -- that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case"")."
372,5," On February 6, 2008, Defendants submitted a Motion for Summary Judgment with respect to the IP Plaintiffs' federal antitrust 
claim for declaratory and injunctive relief under Section 16 of the Clayton Act. See Sec. Am. Compl., Ct. I. On February 11, 
2008, counsel for the IP Plaintiffs advised me that, without admission or concession of any factual allegations or legal arguments 
in Defendants' papers, the IP Plaintiffs do not contest Defendants' Motion or the dismissal of the federal antitrust claim. "
373,," Accordingly, on February 12, 2008, I entered an order granting Defendants' Motion and dismissing with prejudice the IP 
Plaintiffs' federal  [*17] antitrust claim. In their submissions relating to the above-referenced Motion, Defendants and the IP 
Plaintiffs agree that the dismissal of the IP Plaintiffs' federal antitrust claims does not divest the district court of jurisdiction over 
the IP Plaintiffs' remaining claims. I similarly conclude that pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367, the district court may retain jurisdiction 
over the IP Plaintiffs' state law claims."
373,6," In my Report and Recommendation dated March 1, 2007, I recommended dismissal of Count III of the Second Amended 
Complaint, which alleged unlawful monopolization under certain state antitrust and/or consumer protection statutes (the ""Walker 
Process/sham litigation claims""). The IP Plaintiffs' objections to the March 1, 2007 Report have been briefed and argued before 
the District Court."
373,7," Under United States Supreme Court precedent, HN8[
] indirect purchasers generally do not have standing to seek damages 
under federal antitrust law. See Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977). See also

374,8," The fact of injury element is also referred to interchangeably as ""injury-in-fact,"" ""impact"" and ""fact of damage."" See, e.g., ABA 
Section of Antitrust Law, Antitrust Law Developments (5th ed. 2002) at 839; Rossi v. Standard Roofing, Inc., 156 F.3d 452, 
483 (3d Cir. 1998)."
374,9," Although a claim for damages under Section 4 of the Clayton Act requires proof  [*21] of actual injury, a plaintiff seeking 
equitable relief under Section 16 of the Clayton Act need only ""demonstrate a significant threat of injury from an impending 
violation of the antitrust laws or from a contemporary violation likely to continue or recur."" Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine 
Research, Inc., 395 U.S. 100, 130, 89 S. Ct. 1562, 23 L. Ed. 2d 129 (1069)."
374,10," I note that HN9[
] once a plaintiff has established the fact of injury element of an antitrust claim, the standard of proof 
required with respect to the amount of damages is less stringent and is satisfied by a reasonable approximation. See, e.g., J. 
Truett Payne, 451 U.S. 557, 566-67, 101 S. Ct. 1923, 68 L. Ed. 2d 442 (1981). The relatively relaxed standard of proof for the 
amount of damages recognizes the principle that ""it does not 'come with very good grace' for the wrongdoer to insist upon 
specific proof of the injury which it has itself inflicted."" Id. at 567 (quoting Hetzel v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 169 U.S. 26, 18 S. 
Ct. 255, 42 L. Ed. 648 (1898)."
374,11," HN12[
] Fact of injury is often analyzed in conjunction with the related concept of ""antitrust injury."" Fact of injury focuses on 
whether the plaintiff sustained injury to his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws. See 
Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 489, 97 S. Ct. 690, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977). The concept of ""antitrust 
injury"" focuses on whether the ""injury [is] of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and . . . flows from that which 
makes the defendants' acts unlawful. The injury should reflect the anticompetitive effect either of the violation or of the 
anticompetitive acts made possible by the violation."" Id. See also City of Pittsburgh v. West Penn Power Co., 147 F.3d 256 (3d 
Cir. 1998) (discussing ""antitrust standing"" and ""antitrust injury""). "
375,12," It is undisputed that (a) at all relevant times, Harris was a resident of Louisiana, (b) all of Harris' purchases of K-Dur were 
made at pharmacies in Louisiana, and (c) Harris never purchased pharmaceuticals through a mail order service. Def. Stmt. 
(Harris) at P 2. Accordingly, I find that Louisiana law governs Harris' claims."
375,13," See Free v. Abbott Lab., Inc., 739 So. 2d 216 (La. 1999). "
377,14," I note that  [*34] HN20[
] injury is an element of a claim under both the Louisiana Monopolies Law and the Louisiana Consumer Protection Law. See LSA-R.S. § 51:137 (granting a private right of action to ""[a]ny person injured in his business or 
property by any person by reason of any act or thing forbidden by this Part. . . ."") and LSA-R.S. § 51:1409 (providing a cause of 
action to person ""who suffers any ascertainable loss of money or movable property"" resulting form a violation of the statute) 
(emphasis added). Similarly, HN21[
] a claim for unjust enrichment under Louisiana law requires an enrichment ""without cause at the expense of another person."" See LSA-C.S. Art. 2298. See also Moroux v. Toce, 943 So.2d 1263, 1273 (La. App. 3 Cir.

378,21," MR. ISAACSON: ""We'd like to start with the summary judgment motion against Shelia Harris, who is the one who remains as 
putative class  [*36] representative. Ms. Harris is an example of someone who had a flat co-pay throughout the time period 
which the plaintiffs are seeking damages; the flat co-pay meaning her co-pay is the same whether she took a brand drug or a 
generic drug. There is no dispute that during the period in which Ms. Harris was on Medicaid that she had a flat co-pay. That is 
admitted by Ms. Harris in their brief. She had a $ 1.00 co-pay when she bought K-Dur. It is undisputed her co-pay would have 
been the same $ 1.00 whether she had taken a generic or whether generic entry had occurred sooner and she had stayed with 
K-Dur the co-pay would have been the same. The only dispute that Ms. Harris has raised with respect to her insurance status is 
that prior to the time she was on Medicaid she was uninsured. As an uninsured person she would have been paying full price for 
the drug. But the record is clear that Ms. Harris was on Medicaid at least as early as 1997. This is a document that she has 
produced. It is a little bit hard to read."" Tr. at 9-10."
378,22," MR. FLANNERY: ""The injury occurs is different ways. It, of course, relates to the price that was paid at the time. It also relates 
to our joint purchase theory. For  [*37] example, with respect to Ms. Harris. Assuming Mr. Isaacson would be correct that she 
paid a flat co-pay during the relevant time period. That is, she paid during the time she was --"" THE SPECIAL MASTER: ""Do you 
disagree with that, by the way, factually?"" MR. FLANNERY: ""No, I don't. I don't. But assuming that to be true, the fact that she 
paid a flat co-pay does not mean that she was not injured."""
378,23," Declaration of William J. O'Shaughnessy, Exhibit 2. The one exception reflected in the pharmacy records is that Harris paid $ 
0.50 for four (4) pill prescription of K-Dur on October 12, 1998."
378,24," Defendants also argue that there is no evidence that Harris would have switched to a generic version of K-Dur had generic 
 [*38] entry occurred sooner, noting, inter alia, that Harris filled her last prescription of K-Dur six months before generic entry. 
See Def. Br. (Harris) at 6; Def. Reply (Harris) at 2-4. In response, Plaintiffs point to evidence that consumer plaintiffs dramatically 
shifted from branded to generic K-Dur following generic entry and argue that the reasonable inference to be drawn from this 
evidence is that Harris also would have shifted to generic K-Dur had generic entry occurred sooner. See Pl. Br. at 15-16. 
Because I find the fixed co-pay issue to be dispositive of the injury element of Harris' claims, I find it unnecessary to address the 
arguments and evidence regarding whether Harris would have switched to a generic version of K-Dur had one been available 
earlier. "
379,25," MR. FLANNERY: ""We submit  [*40] the report of Ray Hartman for the proposition that each one of those folks -- all of the 
plaintiffs who are subject to summary judgment motions here are, in fact, injured."" Tr. at 22."
379,26," THE SPECIAL MASTER: ""Tell me how this works. What you're really asking me to do is deny the motion for summary 
judgment based on Dr. Hartman's expert opinion, which you say demonstrates that Ms. Harris and presumably the other 
plaintiffs -- at least most, if not all -- some of the other plaintiffs have demonstrated through his report what I'll call antitrust injury. 
Correct?"" MR. FLANNERY: ""That's correct."" Tr. at 25-26."
379,27," MR. FLANNERY: ""Just to follow on, that my statement -- my response to that is this is a woman who testified on the record 
that she at times paid the full cost of the drug. It is, to me, a reasonable inference, based on that, that during the time period 
when the records were destroyed she may have paid the full price of the drug. In that instance she's not a flat co-payer."" Tr. at 
38."
379,28," It appears that Plaintiffs have dropped the ""strain"" of argument that proof of injury can simply be ""presumed upon proof of a 
conspiracy"" for which the Plaintiffs' cite the Third Circuit's decision in In re Linerboard Antitrust Litig., 305 F.3d 145, 151 (3d Cir. 
2002).  [*41] Assuming that Plaintiffs still desire to pursue this line of argument as additional proof of antitrust injury, I find that 
Plaintiffs' reliance on Linerboard is misplaced. Having reviewed the case, I find that Linerboard is fundamentally about issues of 
class certification, not proof of injury for an individual antitrust claimant facing summary judgment. In particular, the fact that 
common proof of injury or damage may be adequate to satisfy the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3), does not, ipso 
facto, mean that it is also sufficient to satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement of an individual plaintiff's antitrust claim when facing 
summary judgment."
379,29," MR.  [*42] FLANNERY: ""it's our theory, again based on a much more fully-developed record than was present in the Alabama 
motion, that Dr. Hartman's opinion demonstrates, again looking at aggregate data, that even people who paid a flat co-pay were 
injured. The injury in that instance happened to be borne by, predominately, their third-party payer [sic] counterpart in the 
transaction who, as you know, we allege and assert, is paying a part of the anti-competitive price."" Tr. at 23."

1.00 only in the event that she obtained less than a 30-day supply of K-Dur."

384,52," MR. ISAACSON: ""The last point with respect to her -- Mr. Flannery's argument that she, quote, bought other generics, our 
view is that argument and any testimony along those lines is inadmissible here. We filed a motion to compel against these 
plaintiffs saying that the consumers have to produce their records regarding other drugs they've taken so we can see whether, in 
fact, they switched to generics when they were available. We can look at whether they took the branded drug or the generic 
drug. Indirect purchasers opposed that motion to compel. Your Honor agreed with the indirect purchasers that on privacy 
grounds these indirect  [*59] purchasers should not have to produce their records with respect to all of their drugs. That is on 
appeal to Judge Greenaway. But for the most, certainly, that is the law. For Ms. Palmer or anyone else, any other consumer 
plaintiff, to resist the discovery and say 'I'm not going to give you discovery on my other drugs' and then turn around and say 'I 
always asked for the generics,' I think that ought to be inadmissible since we were denied the opportunity to fully test whether 
that statement is, in fact, accurate. I think that is a classic sword-and-shield problem. That argument ought not to be allowed."""

384,54," See Pl. Br. at 16 (""Thus, within a year, virtually everyone who was taking K-Dur was converted to a generic version of K-Dur

declared unlawful by any of the acts contained in chapter 50 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, relating to unlawful acts,

furnish a statement which sets forth material facts as to which there exists or does not exist a genuine issue."" D.N.J. L. Civ. R. 
56.1. Pursuant to Local Rule 56.1, Defendants submitted separate Statements of Material Facts as to each IP Plaintiff against whom 
Defendants have moved for summary judgment, and Plaintiffs submitted Responses to each of those Statements of Material 
Facts. (Defendants' Statements of Material Facts as to the IP Plaintiffs will be cited as ""Def. Stmt. (Plaintiff name) at P    ; 
Plaintiffs' Responses thereto will be cited as ""Pl. Rcsp. Stmt. (Plaintiff name) at P   ""). Defendants also submitted Supplemental

405,4," In their omnibus Surreply Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment, the IP Plaintiffs 
suggest that Defendants bear the burden of negating the injury element of Plaintiffs' claims. See Pl. Surreply at 3 (stating that 
""the summary judgment rules put the burden on Defendants to prove the absence of injury"" and ""[t]he burden remains on 
Defendants to show that there are no disputed facts on summary judgment and that there is no injury. . . ."") (italics in original). 
Such a suggestion overstates a moving party's summary judgment burden with respect to an issue on which the nonmoving 
party bears the ultimate burden of proof. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325 (where the nonmoving party bears the burden of proof on 
an issue, the moving party's burden on summary judgment ""may be discharged by 'showing' -- that is, pointing out to the district 
court --  [*14] that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case""). "
406,5," On February 6, 2008, Defendants submitted a Motion for Summary Judgment with respect to the Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs' 
federal antitrust claim for declaratory and injunctive relief under Section 16 of the Clayton Act. See Sec. Am. Compl., Ct. 1. On 
February 11, 2008, counsel for the IP Plaintiffs advised me that, without admission or concession of any factual allegations or 
legal arguments in Defendants' papers, the IP Plaintiffs do not contest Defendants' Motion or the dismissal of the federal 
antitrust claim. Accordingly, on February 12, 2008, I entered an order granting Defendants' Motion and dismissing with prejudice 
the IP Plaintiffs' federal antitrust claim. In their submissions relating to the above-referenced  [*17] Motion, Defendants and the 
IP Plaintiffs agree that the dismissal of the IP Plaintiffs' antitrust claims does not divest the district court of jurisdiction over the IP 
Plaintiffs' remaining claims. I similarly conclude that pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367, the district court may retain jurisdiction over 
the IP Plaintiffs' state law claims."
406,6," In my Report and Recommendation dated March 1, 2007, I recommended dismissal of Count III of the Second Amended 
Complaint, which alleged unlawful monopolization under certain state antitrust and/or consumer protection statutes (the ""Walker 
Process/sham litigation claims""). The IP Plaintiffs' objections to the March 1, 2007 Report have been briefed and argued before 
the District Court."
406,7," Pennsylvania has no general antitrust statute and no statute that creates a private right of action against restraints of trade or 
monopolization. See ABA Section of Antitrust Law, State Antitrust Practice and Statutes (3d ed. 2004) at §§ 41-1 and 41-16. 
Although Pennsylvania has an Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law, 73 P.S. § 201-1, et seq., that statute ""is 
limited by definition to conduct involving misrepresentation, deception, or fraud."" Id. at § 41-1 (citing 73 P.S. § 201-2)."
406,8," In my February 21, 2008 Report and Recommendation deciding Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment against IP 
Plaintiffs Sheila Harris and Elaine Palmer (the ""Harris/Palmer Report""), I determined that the claims of consumer IP Plaintiffs 
""are governed by law of the Plaintiffs' state of residence, where it is undisputed that these Plaintiffs purchased all or most of their 
prescriptions of K-Dur or generic  [*19] potassium chloride supplements."" See Harris/Palmer Report at 6. "
407,9," Although I need not decide this issue, I note  [*20] that Pennsylvania state courts and federal courts applying Pennsylvania law 
have held that a plaintiff need not confer a benefit directly on the defendant to state a claim for unjust enrichment. See, e.g., 
Com. ex rel. Pappert v. Tap Pharm. Prods., Inc., 885 A.2d 1127, 1137-38 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2005); D.A. Hill Co. v. CleveTrust 
Realty Investors, 524 Pa. 425, 573 A.2d 1005, 1009 (Pa. 1990) (subcontractor could recover from owner on unjust enrichment 
theory even if he did not have a direct contractual relationship with the owner); Powers v. Lycoming Engines, Nos. 06-2993, 06-
4228, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67636, 2007 WL 2702705, *3 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 12, 2007) (citing Pappert, supra; D.A. Hill, supra; and

407,10," HN7[
] Under Pennsylvania law, a plaintiff alleging unjust enrichment ""must establish the following: (1) plaintiff conferred a 
benefit on the defendant; (2) the defendant appreciated the benefit; and (3) acceptance and retention by the defendant of the 
benefits, under the circumstances, would make it inequitable for the  [*21] defendant to retain the benefit without paying for the 
value of the benefit."" Pappert, 885 A.2d at 1137. Although I need not decide whether the evidence as to Lavin could establish 
these elements, it is undisputed that Lavin purchased K-Dur twice after May 3, 1998, the but-for generic entry date for purposes 
of Defendants' summary judgment motions. See Def. Reply (Lavin) at 1; Pl. Stmt. at P4; Def. Resp. Stmt. at P 4. Lavin also 
testified that he has taken generic drugs, that he is generally interested in taking generic medication, and that, as a dentist, he 
has prescribed generic drugs to his patients. See Lavin Dep. at 49, 50, 51, 54-58, attached to Lieverman Decl. as Exh. 17. See 
also Pl. Stmt. at P 4; Def. Resp. Stmt. at P 4. However, the summary judgment record, principally Lavin's pharmacy records for 
purchases of K-Dur and other medications, does not reflect the prices Lavin paid for his prescriptions. See O'Shaughnessy Decl. 
at Exh. 3 (LAVIN 01-LAVIN 52). See also Tr. at 116 (THE SPECIAL MASTER: ""You don't have specific evidence of what Dr. 
Lavin paid for whatever he received from the pharmacy?"" MR. FLANNERY: ""That's correct. I concede there isn't a price listed 
there."")."
407,11," Plaintiffs argue that the Philadelphia Common Pleas Court's decision in Stutzle is not binding, and note that ""no Pennsylvania 
appellate court has held that antitrust damages are unavailable."" See Pl. Br. at 53. Plaintiffs further argue that in Collins v. Manl 
Line Bd. of Realtors, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court implied that such a remedy is available. Collins, 452 Pa. 342, 304 A.2d 
493, 498 (Pa. 1973). I am not persuaded by that argument and conclude, as did the court in XF Enterprises, that the language "
408,," from Collins upon which  [*26] Plaintiffs rely is ""dicta and is ambiguous at best."" XF Enterprises, 47 Pa. D. & C. 4th at 150. See 
also DRAM, 516 F. Supp. 2d at 1099-1100 (citing XF Enterprises and distinguishing Collins). "
412,1," The plaintiffs in each case are as follows: Walgreen Co., Eckerd Corp., Maxi Drug, Inc., The Kroger Co., New Albertson's, Inc., 
Safeway, Inc., Hy-Vee, Inc. and American Sales Company, Inc. in Civil Action No. 06-2084; Rite Aid Corp. and Rite Aid 
Headquarters Corp. in Civil Action No. 06-2089; Meijer, Inc. and Meijer  [**5] Distribution, Inc. in Civil Action No. 06-2155; 
Louisiana Wholesale Drug Co., Inc. in Civil Action No. 06-2157; and Burlington Drug Company, Inc., Dik Drug Company, and 
King Drug Company of Florence, Inc. in Civil Action No. 07-41. The latter three actions were filed on behalf of a proposed class 
consisting of all persons and entities in the United States who purchased omeprazole and/or any of its enantiomers directly from 
any of the defendants after December 18, 2002. Because the complaints are otherwise virtually identical, all references to a 
complaint will be made to the complaint in the first-filed case. "
413,2, These conditions are also known as erosive esophogitis and symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease.
413,3," AstraZeneca was not the sole manufacturer in the market for prescription treatment of heartburn and related conditions, 
however. Prevacid, Protonix, and Aciphex are prescription treatments manufactured by others for the same medical conditions. 
(See Mot. to Dismiss at 12.)"
413,4," ""Detailing"" in the retail pharmaceutical business refers to the practice of sending company representatives to doctors' offices to 
distribute samples and promotional materials and information. "
415,5," Tying, which is not alleged against AstraZeneca in this case, is classic exclusionary conduct. See Philip R. Areeda & Herbert 
Hovenkamp, 3A Antitrust Law § 776c at 242-53 (2d ed. 2002) (""Areeda & Hovenkamp 2d ed."") (discussing the tying presented 
in the Microsoft case); see id. generally, Ch. 7D-4 at 228-67; (discussing various issues involved in vertical integration)."
415,6," Plaintiffs allege that the sales persuasion directed to medical professionals and lay persons was distorted in multiple respects. 
They have not, however, asserted a claim for fraud. "
421,1," HN1[
] In adjudicating a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the Court may consider ""material which is properly submitted as part of the complaint,"" Hal Roach Studios, Inc. v. Richard Feiner & Co., 896 F.2d 1542, 1555 (9th Cir. 1989), as well as ""documents 'whose 
contents are alleged in a complaint  [*3] and whose authenticity no party questions, but which are not physically attached to the 
[plaintiff's] pleading.'"" Parrino v. FHP, Inc., 146 F.3d 699, 705-06 (9th Cir. 1998) (quoting Branch v. Tunnell, 14 F.3d 449, 454 
(9th Cir. 1994)). Accordingly, Plaintiffs' current Franchise Agreements, which the parties have stipulated are identical in all 
material respects to Exhibit 1 to Defendants' Request for Judicial Notice, are a proper subject of judicial notice, as are the 
renewal and software licensing agreements discussed infra. "
422,2," Plaintiffs have filed a separate motion for a preliminary injunction, based on their purported likelihood of success on the merits 
of their Section 1 Sherman Act claims. That motion will be addressed by the Court in a separate order. "
423,3," The Complaint simply alleges that: ""Plaintiff Richard T. Swisher is an individual who is a resident of Texas. Domino's  [*10] may 
consider him to be the franchisee under some or all of the franchise agreements. He has been required to sign instruments 
relating to the franchises."" (Compl. P 10.) "
424,4," At the same time, the Court cannot countenance Domino's additional argument that Plaintiffs have suffered no antitrust injury 
because they have not yet indicated their assent to renewal of the franchises and purchase of the tied product (Domino's 
PULSE). HN5[
] While it is true that coercion or ""forcing"" of purchase the tied product is a necessary predicate of a tying claim 
(see infra section II.A.1), such coercion is demonstrated where, as here, a consumer must accept the tied product against his or 
her will. See, e.g., Paladin Assocs. v. Montana Power Co., 328 F.3d 1145, 1160 (9th Cir. 2003); ABA Section of Antitrust Law, 
Antitrust Law Developments 186-87 (6th ed. 2007) (""[A] coercion test serves to distinguish transactions in which the purchaser 
voluntarily acquires bundled goods or services from transactions  [*14] in which the seller compels the purchase of bundled 
products against the buyer's will."") This is clearly the case here. "
426,5," Assuming arguendo that Plaintiffs have alleged a proper tying product market, Domino's argues that the tying claims must 
nonetheless fail because the tying product (Domino's renewal franchises) and the tied product (the Domino's PULSE computer 
system) are not two separate products. However, this issue is fact-intensive and inappropriate for resolution at the pleading 
stage. It is sufficient, at this juncture, that Plaintiffs have alleged the existence of competing computer system vendors and 
consumer/franchisee use of the same. See, e.g., Kodak, 504 U.S. at 462 (HN12[
] ""For service and parts to be considered two 
distinct products, there must be sufficient consumer demand so that it is  [*23] efficient for a firm to provide service separately 
from parts""); Subsolutions, Inc. v. Doctor's Assocs., 62 F. Supp. 2d 616, 623-624 (D. Conn. 1999) (""The fact that a separate 
market for these POS system vendors evolved evidences that the Subway franchise market is distinct from the POS system 
market."") "

438,2," Defendants Madacy, Amos Alter, and David Alter filed a motion to stay or dismiss the FAC based on international comity and 
forum non conveniens arguments. The district court denied this motion as moot. "
441,3," HN8[
] A copyright consists of a bundle of six statutorily created rights, currently codified at 17 U.S.C. § 106. The statute confers upon the owner of the copyright the exclusive right to do and authorize the following: (1) to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords; (2) to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work; (3) to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by 
rental, lease, or lending; (4)  [**17] in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and motion pictures and other 
audiovisual works, to perform the copyrighted work publicly; (5) in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or sculptural 
works, including the individual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, to display the copyrighted work 
publicly; and (6) in the case of sound recordings, to perform the copyrighted work publicly by means of a digital audio transmission. Id. "
442,4," Section 1962(a) states: HN11[
] It shall be unlawful for any person who has received any income derived, directly or indirectly, from a pattern of 
racketeering activity or through collection of a unlawful debt in which such person has participated as a principal within the 
meaning of section 2, title 18, United States Code to use or invest, directly or indirectly, any part of such income, or the 
proceeds of such income, in acquisition of any interest in, or the establishment or operation of, any enterprise which is 
engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce."
442,5," Section 1962(c) states: HN12[
] It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of 
which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such 
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt."
442,6," Sybersound also alleged in the FAC that the letters sent by individuals at UAV and Madacy to Customers that falsely stated 
that Sybersound's karaoke records lacked the requisite licenses were acts of mail and wire fraud. Sybersound, however, failed to "
443,," raise this argument in its brief, and we decline to reach the merits of this claim. Smith v. Marsh, 194 F.3d 1045, 1052 (9th Cir. 
1999).  [**22] "
447,7," Recently, HN24[
] Proposition 64 restricted UCL's standing requirement somewhat by requiring a private action be brought by ""any person who has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of such unfair competition."" Cal. Bus. & 
Prof. Code § 17204. Sybersound has alleged  [**37] loss of money as a result of the Corporation Defendants' wrongfully

455,2," The Motion decided in this Report is among seven separate Motions for Summary Judgment filed by Defendants against five 
individual consumer Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs (""IP Plaintiffs"") and three third-party payor IP Plaintiffs. In the Reports deciding 
these motions, Defendants' opening and reply memoranda of law in support of each separate motion will be cited, respectively, 
as ""Def. Br. (Plaintiff name) at    ,"" and ""Def. Reply (Plaintiff name) at    ."" Defendants' Omnibus Reply Memorandum of Law in "

Summary Judgment will be cited, respectively, as ""Pl. Br. at    "" and ""Pl. Surreply at    ."""
456,3," In addition to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, Defendants' Motions are also subject to Rule 56.1 of the Local Rules of the United States 
District Court for the District of New Jersey, which requires that HN2[
] ""[o]n motions for summary judgment, each side shall furnish a statement which sets forth material facts as to which there exists or does not exist a genuine issue."" D.N.J. L. Civ. R. 
56.1. Pursuant to Local Rule 56.1, Defendants submitted separate Statements of Material Facts as to each IP Plaintiff against whom 
Defendants have moved for summary judgment, and Plaintiffs submitted Responses to each of those Statements of Material 
Facts. (Defendants' Statements of Material Facts as to the IP Plaintiffs will be cited as ""Def. Stmt. (Plaintiff name) at P    ; 
Plaintiffs' Responses thereto will be cited as ""Pl. Resp. Stmt.  [*12] (Plaintiff name) at P   ""). Defendants also submitted 
Supplemental Statements of Material Facts as to certain of the IP Plaintiffs. (Defendants' Supplemental Statements of Fact will 
be cited as ""Def. Suppl. Stmt. (Plaintiff name) at P    ). Finally, Plaintiffs submitted an omnibus Statement of Material Facts in 
Opposition to Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment, to which Defendants submitted a Response. (Plaintiffs' omnibus 
Statement of Material Facts will be cited as ""Pl. Stmt. at P    ; Defendants' Response will be cited as ""Def. Resp. Stmt. at P    "")."
456,4," In their omnibus Surreply Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment, the IP Plaintiffs 
suggest that Defendants bear the burden of negating the injury element of Plaintiffs' claims. See Pl. Surreply at 3 (stating that 
""the summary judgment rules put the burden on Defendants to prove the absence of injury"" and ""[t]he burden remains on 
Defendants to show that there are no disputed facts on summary judgment and that there is no injury. . . ."") (italics in original). 
Such a suggestion overstates a moving party's summary judgment burden with respect to an issue on which the nonmoving 
party bears the ultimate burden of proof. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325 (where the nonmoving party bears the burden of proof on 
an issue, the moving party's  [*14] burden on summary judgment ""may be discharged by 'showing' -- that is, pointing out to the 
district court -- that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case""). "
457,5," In April 2006, the THWF moved its offices to Pennsauken, New Jersey. See Pl. Resp. Stmt. (THWF) at P 2 and Einhorn Decl. 
at P 2."
457,6," William Einhorn, the THWF's Administrator, testified that on an average basis, the THWF covers approximately 10,300 eligible 
members and their families, or approximately 27,000 or 28,000 covered lives. See Einhorn Dep. at 19. "
458,7," On February 6, 2008, Defendants submitted a Motion for Summary Judgment with respect to the Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs' 
federal antitrust claim for declaratory and injunctive relief under Section 16 of the Clayton Act. See Sec. Am. Compl., Ct. I. On 
February 11, 2008, counsel for the IP Plaintiffs advised me that, without admission or concession of any factual allegations or 
legal arguments in Defendants' papers, the IP Plaintiffs do not contest Defendants' Motion or the dismissal of the federal 
antitrust claim. Accordingly, on February 12, 2008, I entered an order granting Defendants' Motion and dismissing with prejudice 
the IP Plaintiffs' federal antitrust claim. In their submissions relating to the above-referenced Motion, Defendants and the IP 
Plaintiffs agree that the dismissal of the IP Plaintiffs' antitrust claims docs not divest the district court  [*19] of jurisdiction over the 
IP Plaintiffs' remaining claims. I similarly conclude that pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367, the district court may retain jurisdiction 
over the IP Plaintiffs' state law claims."
458,8," In my Report and Recommendation dated March 1, 2007, I recommended dismissal of Count III of the Second Amended 
Complaint, which alleged unlawful monopolization under certain state antitrust and/or consumer protection statutes (the ""Walker 
Process/sham litigation claims""). The IP Plaintiffs' objections to the March 1, 2007 Report have been briefed and argued before 
the District Court."
458,9," Counts III and IV of the Second Amended Complaint do not allege claims under the antitrust or consumer protection laws of 
Pennsylvania or Delaware. Although Counts III and IV of the Second Amended Complaint assert claims under the New Jersey 
Antitrust Act and the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act, the IP Plaintiffs have subsequently stated that they are not pursuing 
claims pursuant to those laws. See Pl. Br. at 23 n.19 (citing Wilson v. General Motors Corp., 190 N.J. 336, 921 A.2d 414 (N.J. 
2007))."
458,10," I note that the IP Plaintiffs have not argued that the THWF's claim is governed by the law of any state other than Pennsylvania, 
New Jersey or Delaware, nor have Plaintiffs identified any other state law that could be applicable. "
459,11," Defendants also contend that the THWF cannot  [*23] satisfy certain alleged requirements of an unjust enrichment claim 
under the laws of these three states. For example, Defendants assert that a claim for unjust enrichment under Pennsylvania and 
Delaware law requires a direct relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant. See Def. Reply (THWF) at 3-4 and 6-7. With 
respect to New Jersey, Defendants argue that the THWF cannot establish, inter alia, a direct relationship between the parties or 
a mistake on the part of the person conferring the benefit. See Def. Br. (THWF) at 8-9. Because I conclude that the THWF's 
unjust enrichment claim is not cognizable under Pennsylvania, New Jersey or Delaware law, it is not necessary to address the 
specific elements necessary to establish that claim under each state's law. "
463,1," Tucson golf facilities are usually run by general managers, but the facilities also typically have a Professional Golfers' 
Association (""PGA"") golf professional (""pro"") who oversees the golfing function of the facility and often becomes involved in 
marketing golf for the facility, including entering discount golf contracts such as the TRGC."
463,2," For example, the Participation Agreement for the 1999-2000 season contained an exclusivity clause that stated as follows: Exclusivity: Participant agrees that they will not participate in or conduct any discount coupon programs or any other 
discount card program without the prior written consent of [Tee Time]. Tee Time maintains that the exclusivity clauses in its Participation Agreements were ""necessary, desirable and reasonable"" 
provisions that were never intended to, and did not, prevent participating golf facilities from offering other discounts or 
participating in other discount programs or cards; instead, the clauses were designed to ensure that TRGC cardholders would 
receive at least twenty percent off the lowest rates offered to other golfers. Defendants contend that the intent of the exclusivity 
clauses in both the TRGC and the subsequent Southern Chapter Card, discussed infra, was not to limit course participation in "
464,," other discount programs or the advertisement of discounts in general, but to ensure that each card's own cardholders would get 
the best discount being offered - i.e.,  [*5] at least twenty percent off any advertised rate. Tee Time, however, challenges 
Defendants' motives."
464,3," Defendant Starr Pass Holdings, L.L.C. dba Star Pass Golf Club (""Starr Pass"") ceased participating in the TRGC program 
beginning with the 1997-1998 golf card season."
464,4," Fails, the pro at Starr Pass, became president of the TGA, and Oswald, the pro at Vistoso Gold Partners, L.L.C. dba Vistoso 
Golf Club (""Vistoso"") became vice president."
464,5," Clearly, if the marketing campaign only attracted more full-paying tourists and golfers, the amount of discounted play would be 
reduced as a percentage of the total revenues. However, depending on the availability of open tee times, especially during the 
summer, an increase in full-paying customers might not translate into a decrease in the actual number of discount players, only 
a percentage change. In fact, a marketing campaign might have the effect of increasing both full-paying and discount customers, 
leaving the overall relative percentages the same or similar. We are provided no factual information regarding the actual effects 
of any marketing campaign conducted, including actual  [*7] or percentage changes."
464,6," The minutes of the January 13, 2000 TGA meeting reflect that Swager attended that meeting and was appointed to the TGA 
Marketing Committee. Additionally, Kathleen Miko, his assistant, attended and was appointed as a statistician for the TGA. 
Swager admittedly attended several TGA meetings and knew the TGA needed funding for its programs."
464,7," Part I, § 7, of the 2000-2001 Southern Chapter Card participation agreement provided as follows: ""Each facility agrees that they 
will not participate in or conduct any discount programs including other golf pass or golf card programs unless approved by a 
majority of the other participating facilities."" Like the TRGC program, the term of the Southern Chapter Card participation 
agreement was to be one year, with no unilateral options  [*8] to extend the agreement. "
465,8," Price, the pro at TNR&S Acquisition, Inc. dba Tucson National Golf Resort & Spa, Inc. (""Tucson National""), was president 
 [*9] of the Southern Chapter of the PGA."
465,9," The attendees included, among others, Swager, Miko, Fails, Oswald, and Craig Bauley, the Marketing Director at the Raven 
golf resort. The advisory board sought to reduce and/or ""cap"" Swager's salary and administrative expenses for the TRGC and to 
divert some funds to the TGA for marketing, particularly toward out-of-state golfers and tourists."
465,10," In its reply brief, Tee Time concedes that Swager only agreed to ""most of"" these proposals, and his testimony supports that 
concession."
465,11," Not surprisingly, Defendants characterize the contents of this meeting somewhat differently. They state that the purpose of the 
meeting was to discuss Swager's continued  [*11] administration of the golf card pass program and proposed changes that they 
deemed essential for their continued support of the TRGC program. Defendants claim that the advisory board agreed to support 
Swager - but only if he agreed to several changes to the program - and that he ultimately refused to agree to many of the 
proposed changes. "
466,12," Participants were required to initial the following term or condition: ""Exclusivity: Participant agrees that they will not participate 
in or conduct any discount coupon  [*13] programs or any other discount card program without the prior written consent of [Tee 
Time]."""
466,13," In the 2000-2001 Participation Agreement, Swager reduced the price of the TRGC program to $59 (from $75) and eliminated 
the exclusivity clause in an effort to encourage participants to sign with both the TRGC and the Southern Chapter Card."
466,14," The highest price golf facilities charge consumers is called the ""rack rate."""
466,15," See Ariz. Rev. Stat. (""A.R.S."") §§ 44-1401 to -1416 (2003). (We cite the current version of the applicable statutes if no 
revisions material to this decision have since occurred.)"
466,16," The complaint named the following defendants: Vistoso and Oswald; Iowa Family Trust dba Torres Blancas Golf Club (""Torres 
Blancas"") and Kevin Lewis; Tucson National and Price; Wyndham International, Inc., formerly dba Ventana Canyon Golf & 
Racquet Club, and Ventana Canyon Alliance, L.L.C. dba Ventana Canyon Golf & Racquet Club (""Ventana"") and Chris Lamberti; 
Castle & Cooke California, Inc. dba Pueblo Del Sol Golf Club (""Pueblo Del Sol"") and Patrick Kelly; American Golf Corp., formerly 
dba Canoa Hills Golf Club, and IRI dba Canoa Hills Golf Club (""Canoa Hills"") and Tatum; and Starr Pass and Fails. "
467,17," Briefly, the difference between a ""per se"" violation and one subject to the ""rule of reason"" may be summarized as follows: [A] per se violation of the antitrust laws [is] conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and therefore illegal without the 
necessity of an evidentiary inquiry into the precise harm caused or the business excuse for its use. The consequence of a 
determination that an agreement falls within one of the per se categories of antitrust violation is that it concludes the judicial 
inquiry. There are no defenses. Regardless of how reasonable the parties' behavior might have been in the particular case, 
the rule of reason is inapplicable and mitigating circumstances are not taken into account. Wedgewood Inv. Corp. v. Int'l Harvester Co., 126 Ariz. 157, 160, 613 P.2d 620, 623 (App. 1979) (reversed in part on other 
grounds in supplemental opinion upon motion for rehearing)."
467,18, See A.R.S. §§ 12-2501 to -2509  [*18] (2003). 
468,19," Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides in part: ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in 
restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."" 15 U.S.C. § 1 (2004)."
468,20," ""A contract, combination or conspiracy between two or more persons in restraint of, or to monopolize, trade or commerce, any 
part of which is within this state, is unlawful."" A.R.S. § 44-1402."
468,21," Arizona Revised Statutes § 44-1412  [*23] provides in pertinent part: ""It is the intent of the legislature that in construing this 
article, the courts may use as a guide interpretations given by the federal courts to comparable federal antitrust statutes."" "
472,22," In fact, as we have previously recognized, Swager admittedly attended several of the TGA's meetings and was appointed to 
the TGA Marketing Committee."
472,23," Further, Tee Time's injury does not appear to be of the kind that the antitrust laws are designed to protect against. To sustain 
an antitrust claim, Tee Time was required to show antitrust injury to the market.  [*39] See Pasco Indus., Inc. v. Talco Recycling, 
Inc., 195 Ariz. 50, 61, ¶ 48, 985 P.2d 535, 546 (App. 1998). Conduct that merely injures a competitor, but does not impact "
473,," competition, does not give rise to antitrust injury. Id.; Belcher Oil Co. v. Florida Fuels, Inc., 749 F. Supp. 1104, 1106-07 (S.D. 
Fla. 1990) (noting that antitrust laws were enacted to protect competition, not competitors) (citing Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo 
Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 488, 97 S. Ct. 690, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977)). ""[I]n order to overcome a summary judgment 
motion, a private antitrust plaintiff seeking to recover for losses growing out of an alleged conspiracy to facilitate the entry of a 
new firm into the market must proffer evidence that it has suffered injury different in kind from losses it could incur as the result 
of the entry of a new firm into the market by legitimate means."" Belcher Oil, 749 F. Supp. at 1107 (citing Brunswick, 429 U.S. at 
486-87). In other words, ""a plaintiff must prove that his loss flows from an anticompetitive aspect of the defendant's behavior. . . . 
If the injury flows from aspects of the defendant's conduct that are beneficial or neutral to competition, there is no antitrust injury, 
even if the defendant's  [*40] conduct is illegal per se."" Glen Holly Entm't, Inc. v. Tektronix, Inc., 352 F.3d 367, 371-72 (9th Cir. 
2003) (quoting Pool Water Prods. v. Olin Corp., 258 F.3d 1024, 1034 (9th Cir. 2001) (citation and internal quotation marks 
omitted from original)). In this case, Tee Time has not shown that it has suffered antitrust injury because its losses are the result of competition from the 
new Southern Chapter Card. Tee Time would have suffered the same injury had Defendants simply switched to a different 
discount golf card company. See Belcher Oil, 749 F. Supp. at 1107. Accordingly, Tee Time's injury is not ""of the type the 
antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants' acts unlawful."" Brunswick, 429 U.S. at 
489; accord Dreibus v. Wilson, 529 F.2d 170, 172 (9th Cir. 1975) (""[T]he substitution of one distributor for another undoubtedly 
injures the distributor replaced, but it does not injure competition among distributors, and does not violate § 1 [of the Sherman 
Act].""). Consequently, even if Tee Time is correct that Defendants conspired against it, its injuries are no different than those 
suffered by legitimate means."
473,24," We note that Dr. McDonald's declaration has not been notarized and is not a properly sworn affidavit. Such a document is 
generally insufficient to withstand a motion for summary judgment. See In re 1996 Nissan Sentra, 201 Ariz. at 117, ¶ 6, 32 P.3d 
at 42. "
474,25," In its opening brief, Tee Time appears to acknowledge that it has not provided evidence sufficient to show whether and to 
what extent consumer prices may have risen and whether  [*44] direct discounting to consumers eased or not."
474,26," Because we affirm the trial court on this basis, we need not and do not address Defendants' argument that Tee Time lacks 
standing to bring its price fixing and output restriction claims because Tee Time is not a member of the golfing public. We also 
do not address the issues raised by the parties relating to joint and several liability and comparative fault. "
481,1," Dr. Bevan and DaVita had ongoing discussions about developing an outpatient dialysis center in Durango; ultimately, however, 
the venture never went forward. Bevan Aff., Ex. A3 to Pl.s' Opp., PP 12-13; Bevan Depo. at 84-85."

484,4," In their  [*20] briefing, the parties apply federal antitrust law to both the federal and state antitrust claims. The Court agrees 
that federal cases interpreting the Sherman Act provide guidance for analysis of claims brought under the Colorado Antitrust Act 
and will therefore evaluate both the federal and state antitrust claims under federal law. Nobody in Particular Presents. Inc. v. 
Clear Channel Communications, Inc., 311 F. Supp. 2d 1048, 1074 n.4 (D. Colo. 2004) (because ""Colorado antitrust law mirrors 
federal antitrust law under the Sherman Act,"" federal law was applied to state law antitrust claims). "
487,5," Although a plaintiff must also have antitrust standing to pursue monopolization or attempted monopolization claims, the Court 
believes that the validity of Plaintiffs' claims of this nature can be determined without first deciding the issue of standing. "
490,6, There is no dispute that Colorado law applies to Plaintiffs' state law claims. 
498,1, (a) Appointment. 
499,," (1) Unless a statute provides otherwise, a court may appoint a master only to: (A) perform duties consented to by the parties;"
499,*," * * (C) address pretrial and post-trial matters that cannot be addressed effectively  [*11] and timely by an available district judge or 
magistrate judge of the district."
499,2," The Motion decided in this Report is among seven separate Motions for Summary Judgment filed by Defendants against five 
individual consumer Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs (""IP Plaintiffs"") and three third-party payor IP Plaintiffs. In the Reports deciding 
these motions, Defendants' opening and reply memoranda of law in support of each separate motion will be cited, respectively, 
as ""Def. Br. (Plaintiff name) at    ,"" and ""Def. Reply (Plaintiff name) at    ."" Defendants' Omnibus Reply Memorandum of Law in 
Further Support of Their Motion for Summary Judgment Against Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs will be cited as ""Def. Reply at    ."" 
Plaintiffs'  [*12] omnibus Memorandum of Law and Surreply Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendants' Motions for 
Summary Judgment will be cited, respectively, as ""Pl. Br. at    "" and ""Pl. Surreply at    ."""
499,3," In addition to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, Defendants' Motions are also subject to Rule 56.1 of the Local Rules of the United States 
District Court for the District of New Jersey, which requires that ""[o]n motions for summary judgment, each side shall furnish a 
statement which sets forth material facts as to which there exists or does not exist a genuine issue."" D.N.J. L. Civ. R. 56.1. Pursuant to Local Rule 56.1, Defendants submitted separate Statements of Material Facts as to each IP Plaintiff against whom 
Defendants have moved for summary judgment, and Plaintiffs submitted Responses to each of those Statements of Material 
Facts. (Defendants' Statements of Material Facts as to the IP Plaintiffs will be cited as ""Def. Stmt. (Plaintiff name) at ¶    ; 
Plaintiffs' Responses thereto will be cited as ""Pl. Resp. Stmt. (Plaintiff name) at ¶    ""). Defendants also submitted Supplemental "
500,," Statements  [*14] of Material Facts as to certain of the IP Plaintiffs. (Defendants' Supplemental Statements of Fact will be cited 
as ""Def. Suppl. Stmt. (Plaintiff name) at ¶    ). Finally, Plaintiffs submitted an omnibus Statement of Material Facts in Opposition 
to Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment, to which Defendants submitted a Response. (Plaintiffs' omnibus Statement of 
Material Facts will be cited as ""Pl. Stmt. at ¶    ; Defendants' Response will be cited as ""Def. Resp. Stmt. at ¶    "")."
500,4," In their omnibus Surreply Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment, the IP Plaintiffs 
suggest that Defendants bear the burden of negating the injury element of Plaintiffs' claims. See Pl. Surreply at 3 (stating that 
""the summary judgment rules put the burden on Defendants to prove the absence of injury"" and ""[t]he burden remains on 
Defendants to show that there are no disputed facts on summary judgment and that there is no injury. . . ."") (italics in original). 
Such a suggestion overstates a moving party's summary judgment burden with respect to an issue on which the nonmoving 
party bears the ultimate burden of proof. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325 (where the nonmoving party bears the burden of proof on 
an issue, the moving party's burden on summary judgment ""may be discharged by 'showing' ? that is, pointing out to the district 
court ?  [*16] that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case""). "
501,5," On February 6, 2008, Defendants submitted a Motion for Summary Judgment with respect to the Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs' 
federal antitrust claim for declaratory and injunctive relief under Section 16 of the Clayton Act. See Sec. Am. Compl., Ct. I. On 
February 11, 2008, counsel for the IP Plaintiffs advised me that, without admission or concession of any factual allegations or 
legal arguments in Defendants' papers, the IP Plaintiffs do not contest Defendants' Motion or the dismissal of the federal 
antitrust claim. Accordingly, on February 12, 2008, I entered an order granting Defendants' Motion and dismissing with prejudice 
the IP Plaintiffs' federal antitrust claim. In their submissions relating to the above-referenced Motion, Defendants and the IP 
Plaintiffs agree that the dismissal of the IP Plaintiffs' antitrust claims does not divest the district court of jurisdiction over the IP 
 [*19] Plaintiffs' remaining claims. I similarly conclude that pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367, the district court may retain jurisdiction 
over the IP Plaintiffs' state law claims."
501,6," In my Report and Recommendation dated March 1, 2007, I recommended dismissal of Count III of the Second Amended 
Complaint, which alleged unlawful monopolization under certain state antitrust and/or consumer protection statutes (the ""Walker 
Process/sham litigation claims""). The IP Plaintiffs' objections to the March 1, 2007 Report have been briefed and argued before 
the District Court."
501,7," Under United States Supreme Court precedent, indirect purchasers generally do not have standing to seek damages under 
federal antitrust law. See Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977). See also Hanover 
Shoe v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 392 U.S. 481, 88 S. Ct. 2224, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1231 (1968)."
501,8," The fact of injury element is also referred to interchangeably as ""injury-in-fact,"" ""impact"" and ""fact of damage."" See, e.g., ABA 
Section of Antitrust  [*21] Law, Antitrust Law Developments (5th ed. 2002) at 839; Rossi v. Standard Roofing, Inc., 156 F.3d 
452, 483 (3d Cir. 1998)."
501,9," I note that once a plaintiff has established the fact of injury element of an antitrust claim, the standard of proof required with 
respect to the amount of damages is less stringent and is satisfied by a reasonable approximation. See, e.g., J. Truett Payne, 
451 U.S. 557, 566-67, 101 S. Ct. 1923, 68 L. Ed. 2d 442 (1981). The relatively relaxed standard of proof for the amount of 
damages recognizes the principle that ""it does not 'come with very good grace' for the wrongdoer to insist upon specific proof of 
the injury which it has itself inflicted."" Id. at 567 (quoting Hetzel v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 169 U.S. 26, 18 S. Ct. 255, 42 L. Ed. 
648 (1898). "
502,10," Additional discussion of the fact of injury element is set forth in my February 21, 2008 Report and Recommendation deciding 
Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment against IP Plaintiffs Sheila Harris and Elaine Palmer (the ""Harris/Palmer Report"") 
and will not be repeated here."
502,11," In the Harris/Palmer Report, I determined that the claims of consumer IP Plaintiffs ""are governed by law of the Plaintiffs' state 
of residence, where it is undisputed that these Plaintiffs purchased all or most of their prescriptions of K-Dur or generic 
potassium chloride supplements."" See Harris/Palmer Report at 6."
502,12," The relevant provisions of the Kansas Monopolies and Unfair Trade Act are also referred to as the Kansas Restraint of Trade 
Act. See Kan. Stat. Ann. 50-158."
502,13," The Kansas Restraint of Trade Act has an express Illinois Brick repealer provision which provides, in pertinent part: . . . any person who may be damaged or injured by any agreement, monopoly, trust, conspiracy or combination which is 
declared unlawful by any of the acts contained in chapter 50 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, relating to unlawful acts, 
agreements, monopolies, trusts, conspiracies or combinations in restraint of trade, shall have a cause of action against any 
person causing such damage or injury. Such action may  [*24] be brought by any person who is injured in such person's 
business or property by reason of anything forbidden or declared unlawful by this act, regardless of whether such injured 
person dealt directly or indirectly with the defendant. The plaintiff in any action commenced hereunder . . . may sue for and 
recover treble the damages sustained. Kan. Stat. Ann. 50-161(b) (emphasis added)."
502,14," See Bergstrom v. Noah, 266 Kan. 829, 974 P.2d 520, 531 (Kan. 1999) (noting the similarities between Kansas antitrust law 
and the Sherman Act and the fact that Sherman Act cases may be persuasive authority for any state court interpreting its 
antitrust laws). "
503,15," The IP Plaintiffs also argue that even if Saad were a brand loyalist who would not have switched to generic potassium 
chloride, she was nonetheless injured. In this regard, the IP Plaintiffs rely on Dr. Hartman's analysis concluding that brand 
loyalists were injured by paying higher prices for K-Dur than they would have but for the delay in generic entry. See Pl. Br. at 17 
(citing Declaration of Raymond S. Hartman, Calculation of Damages to the Class of K-Dur Indirect Purchasers dated August 2, 
2007 (the ""Hartman Repor""), at ¶ 20(c), 30(d), 35 (Exh. 1 to the Lieverman Decl.)). Because I find that a genuine issue of 
material fact exists regarding  [*27] whether Saad would have switched to a generic version of K-Dur, I need not address any 
injury Saad may have suffered as a brand loyalist."
503,16," Saad testified that she was taken off of potassium chloride in 2003 following heart surgery. See Saad Dep. at 22 (Exh. 1 to 
7/19/07 O'Shaughnessy Decl.). Saad's pharmacy records indicate that Saad filled her last prescription for K-Dur on April 17, 
2003, and that she did not obtain another prescription for potassium chloride for 19 months until she first filled a prescription for 
Klor-Con M on November 20, 2004. See SAAD 000016 and SAAD 000021."
503,17," It is undisputed that Upsher-Smith began selling Klor-Con M, its AB-rated version of K-Dur, on September 1, 2001. See Def. 
Stmt. (Saad) at ¶ 4; Pl. Resp. Stmt. (Saad) at ¶ 4. "
504,18," It is undisputed that ""DAW"" is the acronym for ""dispense as written."" See Def. Stmt. (Saad) at ¶ 7; Sec. Am. Compl. at ¶ 55 
(referring to ""DAW"" or ""dispense as written""). The dispute here concerns the meaning and significance of the numerical codes 
accompanying the ""DAW"" notations in Saad's pharmacy records. See Pl. Resp. Stmt. (Saad) at ¶ 7"
504,19," The chart bates numbered ESI-COBA-005101 appears to be page four of a twelve-page document bearing the heading 
""HIPPA 92 Format."" See 10/4/07 O'Shaughnessy Decl. at Exh. 2."
504,20," I note that the chart on ESI-COBA-005101 lists ""DAW 0"" as equal to ""No DAW."" See See 10/4/07 O'Shaughnessy Decl. at 
Exh. 2."
504,21," The first document, titled ""Backstreet Pharmacy Invoice,"" lists five ""accepted 'DAW' codes"" with numerical values of ""0,"" ""1,"" 
""2,"" ""4"" and ""5."" See 10/4/07 O'Shaughnessy Decl. at Exh. 3. The second document, titled ""Caremark Inc. Participating 
Pharmacy Administrative Manual, identifies ten ""DAW"" codes numbered ""0"" through ""9."" Id. at Exh. 4, p. 7-8. The third 
document, which bears  [*31] the headings ""MedImpact"" and ""NCPDP version 5.1 Payer Sheet — Medicare,"" also identifies ten 
""DAW"" codes numbered ""0"" through ""9."" Id. at Exh. 5, p. 4. "
505,22," See also Saad Dep. at 59:19-60:3 (Q. ""Are you saying that you have a specific recollection of discussing the availability of a 
generic version of K-Dur with Dr. Mallory after September?"" A. ""Yes, and at the time I discussed it with him it was before there 
was a generic."" Q. ""After the generic came on the market in September of 2001, did you have any discussions with him—"" A. 
""No, no."")."
505,23," See also Saad Dep. at 58:4-20 (Q. ""Did you have any interaction with your lawyers regarding this case between the filing of 
the complaint on August 8, 2001 and April of 2003?"" A. ""Did I have —"" Q. ""Any dealings with your lawyers?"" A. ""Yes, there was 
some paperwork done and I got some of the files."" Q. ""In the course of your dealings with your lawyers, you never became 
aware of the fact that there had been a generic version of K-Dur  [*34] on the market?"" A. ""No. I am repeating myself, if I had 
known, I would have requested my doctor prescribe that, and the first I knew of it was when I got the other prescription and I 
simply did not pick up or remember this."")."
505,24," See also Rubinfeld Dep. at 46:8-22 (Q. ""What is your understanding of that term [brand loyalist] within the context of this 
case?"" A. ""A brand loyalist is someone who is taking the brand, buying or otherwise utilizing the brand drug, and then that 
person continues  [*35] to stay with the brand after generic entry."" Q. ""On the facts of this case as you understand it, how long 
would a consumer have to keep using K-Dur in order to, in your opinion, be termed a brand loyalist?"" A. ""I don't think of the term "
506,," that way. I would say that when you stay as long — as you're staying with K-Dur, you're a brand loyalist. If you switch to the 
generic, you are no longer a brand loyalist."" Q. ""Once you switch, would you then be a switcher?"" A. ""Yes."")."
506,25," See Moeckel v. Caremark, Inc.,  [*37]  622 F. Supp. 2d 663, 2007 WL 3377831, *18 (2007) (noting that standard ""DAW"" codes 
have been developed and published by the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs, Inc. (""NCPDP"")). See also NCPDP 
website, http://www.ncpdp.org/about.asp."
506,26," See Saad Dep. at 52:4-53:9 (Q. ""I'm just asking you, for the purpose of my question, will you accept the assumption that a 2 
means that the patient requested the brand."" A. ""That I — "" Q. ""Yes."" A. ""—being the patient requested the brand?"" Q. ""Right."" 
A. ""Well, I didn't. I never requested a brand except to ask if there was a generic, which I quit asking after sometime. On a 
prescription I have never gone up and said I want this generic or I want this. I have never done that.""). See also Saad Dep. at 
54:24-57:15."
506,27," Although I make no specific findings on this point, I note that the documents cited by Defendants to establish the meaning of 
""DAW 1"" and ""DAW 2"" indicate that ""DAW 0"" generally means ""no DAW"" or ""no product selection indicated."" See Exh. 2-5 to the 
10/4/07 O'Shaughnessy Decl."
506,28," Saad's pharmacy records further reflect that the vast majority of Saad's prescriptions for other, unidentified medications also 
bear a ""DAW 0"" notation. See SAAD 000002-000057. "
513,1," The notice  [***2] of appeal states that the appeal is from the order sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend. The 
appeal, however, as appears from the briefs and the points made on appeal, is directed solely to appellant's UCL claim. We are 
entitled to consider that any claim of error is deemed abandoned with respect to the CLRA and common law claims. (See 
Spearman v. State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. (1986) 185 Cal. App. 3d 1105, 1113, fn. 4 [230 Cal.Rptr. 264] [failure to discuss 
cause of action on appeal from trial court's order sustaining demurrer constitutes abandonment of that cause of action on 
appeal].)"
513,2," Appellant requests that we take judicial notice of a document entitled “Discount on Self-Pay Account Balances Procedure” 
prepared by the Alta Bates Summit Medical Center business office. The request is denied. For purposes of this appeal, however, 
we assume appellant's factual allegations concerning respondents' policies are true. "
515,3," Appellant also relies on the federal district court case of Falk v. General Motors Corp. (N.D.Cal. 2007) 496 F. Supp. 2d 1088 for 
the proposition that a failure to disclose is actionable under the UCL if it satisfies one of the four tests for the tort of fraud by 
failure to disclose as set forth in LiMandri v. Judkins (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 326, 336 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 539]. In the first place, Falk 
is a federal case and is not binding on California state courts. Secondly, the court in Falk applied federal procedural rules 
pertaining to motions to dismiss, not state rules concerning demurrers. In any event, to the extent Falk compels the conclusion 
that respondents have a duty to disclose their discount policy we respectfully disagree. "
516,4," We have some doubt as to whether the complaint even adequately alleges a failure to disclose. Paragraph 31 states that the 
back of respondents' bill contains information regarding possible discounts and provides a phone number for patients to call for 
more information. "
517,5," For similar reasons we believe Day v. AT & T Corp. (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 325 [74 Cal.Rptr.2d 55] and Prata v. Superior Court 
(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1128 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 296] do not apply. These cases involved defendants who deceptively caused 
customers to incur increased charges or to make payments during an advertised payment-free period. Thus, they involved active 
misrepresentations, not failures to disclose."
517,6," We note the court in Camacho went on to craft yet another test for the “unfair” prong in the consumer context based on the 
factors that define unfairness under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. § 41 et seq.): “(1) The consumer 
injury must be substantial; (2) the injury must not be outweighed by any countervailing benefits to consumers or competition; and 
(3) it must be an injury that consumers themselves could not reasonably have avoided. [Citation.] … This definition of ‘unfair’ is 
on its face geared to consumers and is for that reason appropriate in consumer cases. It is also suitably broad and is therefore in 
keeping with the ‘sweeping’ nature of section 17200.” (Camacho, supra, 142 Cal.App.4th 1394, 1403, fns. omitted.) "
528,1," The Act was modified with an effective date of October 5, 2006. However, the language relevant to this appeal quoted above 
remained unchanged. "
530,2," Schlotzsky's requested $ 128,406 in attorney fees, but the district court decided that the amount should be reduced by twenty-
five percent because Schlotzsky's did not wholly prevail on its claim due to its inability to prove monetary damages with 
particularity. "
533,3," We note that HN21[
] a franchisor has a responsibility imposed by the Lanham Act to protect the integrity and goodwill of its licensed trademark by controlling the quality of products sold under that trademark. 15 U.S.C. §§ 1055, 1127; II JOSEPH P. 
BAUER  [**29] & WILLIAM H. PAGE (ED), KINTNER FEDERAL ANTITRUST LAW, § 13.31, 304-305 (2002). "
554,1," HN3[
] Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act prohibits ""attempt[s] to monopolize . . . any part of the trade or commerce among the several States . . ."" Section 203(B) of the Oklahoma Antitrust Reform Act prohibits ""attempt[s] to monopolize . . . any 
part of trade or commerce in a relevant market within this state."" "
555,2," This Court declines Hear-Wear's invitation to explore non-binding case law from other jurisdictions, particularly in light of the 
adequacy of Tenth Circuit precedent on this issue."
555,3, Cross-elasticity  [**16] means that the demand for one product is inversely related to the demand for another product. Id. 
556,4," The parties should not extrapolate from this finding. The Court is merely ruling on whether Oticon's alternatively pled, relevant 
geographic market definitions  [**20] are facially plausible. The Court is not finding that either claim is substantively viable. "
557,5," A finding that both claims contain sufficient factual allegations does not negate the general principle that ""a patent does not 
necessarily confer market power upon the patentee."" Ill. Tool Works Inc. v. Indep. Ink, Inc., 547 U.S. 28, 45, 126 S. Ct. 1281, 
164 L. Ed. 2d 26 (2006). Whether Hear-Wear has market power is not at issue here."
557,6," This conclusion moots Hear-Wear's remaining arguments that the attempted monopolization claim as a whole cannot stand 
absent proper market definitions. See  [**24] Dkt. # 97, at 18. "

affect the merits of its motion. Further, Petro asserts that it continues to exist; both Petro and TA are subsidiaries of a common 
parent company. (Reply at 13 (citing Tekni-Plex, Inc. v. Meyner and Landis, 89 N.Y.2d 123, 674 N.E. 2d 663, 669, 651 N.Y.S.2d

the Estate of Stanley Nemser as Party Plaintiff (Doc. 529)."
594,3," The Motions decided in this Report are among seven separate Motions for Summary Judgment filed by Defendants against five 
individual consumer Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs (""IP Plaintiffs"") and three third-party payor IP Plaintiffs. In the Reports deciding 
these motions, Defendants' opening and reply  [*12] memoranda of law in support of each separate motion will be cited,

to Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment will be cited, respectively, as ""Pl. Br. at    "" and ""Pl. Surreply at    ."" "
595,4," In addition to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, Defendants' Motions are also subject to Rule 56.1 of the Local Rules of the United States 
District Court for the District of New Jersey, which requires that ""[o]n motions for summary judgment, each side shall furnish a 
statement which sets forth material facts as to which there exists or does not exist a genuine issue."" D.N.J. L. Civ. R. 56.1. Pursuant to Local Rule 56.1,  [*14] Defendants submitted separate Statements of Material Facts as to each IP Plaintiff against 
whom Defendants have moved for summary judgment, and Plaintiffs submitted Responses to each of those Statements of 
Material Facts. (Defendants' Statements of Material Facts as to the IP Plaintiffs will be cited as ""Def. Stmt. (Plaintiff name) at ¶ 
   ; Plaintiffs' Responses thereto will be cited as ""Pl. Resp. Stmt. (Plaintiff name) at ¶    ""). Defendants also submitted 
Supplemental Statements of Material Facts as to certain of the IP Plaintiffs. (Defendants' Supplemental Statements of Fact will 
be cited as ""Def. Suppl. Stmt. (Plaintiff name) at ¶    ). In addition, Plaintiffs submitted an omnibus Statement of Material Facts in 
Opposition to Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment, to which Defendants submitted a Response. (Plaintiffs' omnibus 
Statement of Material Facts will be cited as ""Pl. Stmt. at ¶    ; Defendants' Response will be cited as ""Def. Resp. Stmt. at ¶    ""). 
Finally, in response to Defendants' Motion as to Nemser, the IP Plaintiffs submitted Nemser's Separate Statement of Additional 
Material Facts in Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (cited herein as ""Pl.  [*15] Stmt. (Nemser) at ¶    ""), to 
which Defendants submitted a Response (cited herein as ""Def. Resp. Stmt. (Nemser) at ¶    "")."
595,5," In their omnibus Surreply  [*16] Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment, the IP 
Plaintiffs suggest that Defendants bear the burden of negating the injury element of Plaintiffs' claims. See Pl. Surreply at 3 
(stating that ""the summary judgment rules put the burden on Defendants to prove the absence of injury"" and ""[t]he burden 
remains on Defendants to show that there are no disputed facts on summary judgment and that there is no injury. . . ."") (italics in 
original). Such a suggestion overstates a moving party's summary judgment burden with respect to an issue on which the 
nonmoving party bears the ultimate burden of proof. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325 (where the nonmoving party bears the burden 
of proof on an issue, the moving party's burden on summary judgment ""may be discharged by 'showing' — that is, pointing out to 
the district court — that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case""). "
596,6," On February 6, 2008, Defendants submitted a Motion  [*19] for Summary Judgment with respect to the Indirect Purchaser 
Plaintiffs' federal antitrust claim for declaratory and injunctive relief under Section 16 of the Clayton Act. See Sec. Am. Compl., 
Ct. I. On February 11, 2008, counsel for the IP Plaintiffs advised me that, without admission or concession of any factual 
allegations or legal arguments in Defendants' papers, the IP Plaintiffs do not contest Defendants' Motion or the dismissal of the 
federal antitrust claim. Accordingly, on February 12, 2008, I entered an order granting Defendants' Motion and dismissing with 
prejudice the IP Plaintiffs' federal antitrust claim. In their submissions relating to the above-referenced Motion, Defendants and 
the IP Plaintiffs agree that the dismissal of the IP Plaintiffs' antitrust claims does not divest the district court of jurisdiction over 
the IP Plaintiffs' remaining claims. I similarly conclude that pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367, the district court may retain jurisdiction 
over the IP Plaintiffs' state law claims."
596,7," In my Report and Recommendation dated March 1, 2007, I recommended dismissal of Count III of the Second Amended 
Complaint, which alleged unlawful monopolization under certain state  [*20] antitrust and/or consumer protection statutes (the 
""Walker Process/sham litigation claims""). The IP Plaintiffs' objections to the March 1, 2007 Report have been briefed and argued 
before the District Court."
596,8," Under United States Supreme Court precedent, indirect purchasers generally do not have standing to seek damages under 
federal antitrust law. See Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977). See also Hanover 
Shoe v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 392 U.S. 481, 88 S. Ct. 2224, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1231 (1968). "
597,9," The fact of injury element is also referred to interchangeably as ""injury-in-fact,"" ""impact"" and ""fact of damage."" See, e.g., ABA 
Section of Antitrust Law, Antitrust Law Developments (5th ed. 2002) at 839; Rossi v. Standard Roofing, Inc., 156 F.3d 452, 
483 (3d Cir. 1998)."
597,10," I note that once a plaintiff has established the fact of injury element of an antitrust claim, the standard of proof required with 
respect to the amount of damages is less  [*22] stringent and is satisfied by a reasonable approximation. See, e.g., J. Truett 
Payne, 451 U.S. 557, 566-67, 101 S. Ct. 1923, 68 L. Ed. 2d 442 (1981). The relatively relaxed standard of proof for the amount 
of damages recognizes the principle that ""it does not 'come with very good grace' for the wrongdoer to insist upon specific proof 
of the injury which it has itself inflicted."" Id. at 567 (quoting Hetzel v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 169 U.S. 26, 18 S. Ct. 255, 42 L. 
Ed. 648 (1898)."
597,11," Additional discussion of the fact of injury element is set forth in my February 21, 2008 Report and Recommendation deciding 
Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment against IP Plaintiffs Sheila Harris and Elaine Palmer (the ""Harris/Palmer Report"") 
and will not be repeated here."
597,12," The IP Plaintiffs dispute that almost all of Nemser's purchases of K-Dur were made at the Rye Beach Pharmacy. See Pl. 
Resp. Stmt. (Nemser) at ¶ 1. However, Nemser's pharmacy records do not reflect, nor have the parties argued, that Nemser 
purchased K-Dur or its generic equivalents outside the state of New York. See NEMSER-001-025."
597,13," In the Harris/Palmer Report, I determined that the claims of consumer IP Plaintiffs ""are governed by law of the Plaintiffs' state 
of residence, where it is undisputed that these Plaintiffs purchased all or most of their prescriptions of K-Dur  [*24] or generic 
potassium chloride supplements."" See Harris/Palmer Report at 6."
597,14," The Donnelly Act includes an Illinois Brick repealer provision which states: In any action pursuant to this section, the fact that the state, or any political subdivision or public authority of the state, or 
any person who has sustained damages by reason of a violation of this section has not dealt directly with the defendant 
shall not bar or otherwise limit recovery; provided, however, that in any action in which claims are asserted against a 
defendant by both direct and indirect purchasers, the court shall take all steps necessary to avoid duplicate liability, 
including but not limited to the transfer and consolidation of all related actions. In actions where both direct and indirect 
purchasers are involved, a defendant shall be entitled to prove as a partial or complete defense to a claim for damages that 
the illegal overcharge has been passed on to others who are themselves entitled to recover so as to avoid duplication of 
recovery of damages. N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law § 340(6) (emphasis added). "
598,15," In their Motion, Defendants also sought summary judgment to the extent that Nemser was pursuing a state law monopolization 
claim on the ground that the Donnelly Act does not apply to unilateral conduct. See Def. Br. (Nemser) at 4-5; Def. Br. (COBA) at 
6-7. In their omnibus response Brief, the IP Plaintiffs conceded that their claims ""do not assert liability based on unilateral 
conduct."" See Pl. Br. at 23 n. 19. Accordingly, the only claim at  [*26] issue under the Donnelly Act is based on Defendants' 
alleged anticompetitive agreements in restraint of trade. "
599,16," It is undisputed that Upsher-Smith began selling Klor-Con M, its AB-rated version of K-Dur, on September 1, 2001. See Def. 
Stmt. (Nemser) at ¶ 4; Pl. Resp. Stmt. (Nemser) at ¶ 4."
599,17," Defendants contend that Nemser's eventual switch to a generic version of K-Dur was the result of a change in his VA 
prescribing physician — from Dr. Landsman to ""Dr. Chartier."" See Def. Br. (Nemser) at 4. The factual issues relating to 
purported changes in Nemser's prescribing physicians are clearly disputed. Nemser testified that Dr. Friedman was his doctor 
from March 1999 through September 2005. See Nemser Dep. at 26, 28 (Exh. 1 to the Flannery Decl.). According to Nemser's 
testimony, it appears that he has his own private doctors from whom he receives prescriptions, but, because he fills  [*30] those 
prescriptions through the VA, he is required to submit them for review to VA doctors, who clear them into the pool of 
prescriptions he receives, and who may decide to give him additional prescriptions, which Nemser would then clear with his 
doctor. Id. at 87-88. According to Nemser, Jeanne Chartier is not a doctor but a ""nurse specialist"" who did not prescribe 
medications for Nemser but merely processed his prescriptions for the VA. Id."
599,18, See Def. Br. (Nemser) at 3-4; Def. Stmt. (Nemser) at ¶ 6-7
599,19, See Def. Br. (Nemser) at 4; Def. Reply (Nemser) at 4; Def. Stmt. (Nemser) at 7-8.
599,20, See Def. Br. (Nemser) at 4; Def. Reply (Nemser) at 4. 
600,21," On NEMSER-032, which appears to be a Rye Beach  [*33] Pharmacy summary of the July 16, 2001 prescription and its six 
refills, this prescription is identified as No. 2898295. The last six digits of the prescription number on NEMSER-032 are identical 
to the prescription number appearing on NEMSER-006-010, and it appears undisputed that those numbers refer to the July 16, 
2001 prescription."
600,22," See Nemser Dep. at 71:6-72:7 (Exh. 1 to Flannery Decl.) (Q. ""Earlier we talked about you switched to the VA, and I think I 
might have asked you this, but let me go over it again. Why did you leave Oxford?"" A. ""Because 1 had Medicare and — I left 
Oxford because 1 had Medicare and AARP supplement, so I left Oxford. Then with respect to the medication, I had the VA at 
that point."" Q. ""So I mean what I'm trying to get at, did you leave because it would cost you less to get coverage for your health 
care prescriptions through Medicare, AARP and the VA as opposed to Oxford?"" A. ""I'll just tell you this. Since I left Oxford to go 
on the Medicare and the AARP supplement, the question was, Where do I go for my drugs? And the answer was the VA. And 
that's what I did. Medicare did not give drug prescriptions."") (objections omitted). See also Id. at 73:12-74:5 (testimony that 
Nemser had a 20 percent prescription through AARP but that he only purchased K-Dur through the VA). "
601,23," Like prescription No. 2755935, prescription No. 2946909 was also written for ""POTASSIUM CHLORIDE (K-DUR) 20MEQ SA 
TAB."" See NEMSER-017."
601,24," Nemser's records indicate that prescription No. 2946909 was issued or processed by Jeanne Chartier, who according to 
Nemser, is a nurse specialist with the VA. See NEMSER-017; Nemser Dep. at 87-88 (Exh. 1 to the Flannery Decl.)."
601,25," See also Nemser Dep. at 43:6-25 (Exh. 1 to Flannery Decl.) (Q. ""Do you know why you didn't switch from K-Dur — the 
branded version of K-Dur to the generic version when it came on the market in 2001?"" [objection omitted] A. ""I don't understand 
your question."" Q. ""Well, I mean, I'm trying to figure out if you know whether —you know, why you didn't switch from the generic 
— from the branded version to the generic version."" A. ""I think that depended on any change that my doctor wanted At that time, 
I really was not focused on the fact that there was a generic, and that would only be conjecture why."")."
601,26," See also Rubinfeld  [*40] Dep. at 46:8-22 (Q. ""What is your understanding of that term [brand loyalist] within the context of this

person continues to stay with the brand after generic entry."" Q. ""On the facts of this case as you understand it, how long would a 
consumer have to keep using K-Dur in order to, in your opinion, be termed a brand loyalist?"" A. ""I don't think of the term that "
602,," way. I would say that when you stay as long — as you're staying with K-Dur, you're a brand loyalist. If you switch to the generic, 
you are no longer a brand loyalist."" Q. ""Once you switch, would you then be a switcher?"" A. ""Yes.""). "
604,27," Even if Nemser were required to establish that any enrichment occurred at Defendants' behest, a fact finder arguably could 
conclude that a consumer's purchases of medication developed and marketed by a defendant for sale to consumers were made 
at the defendant's behest. "
608,1," However, Ticketmaster is not alleged to be a ""producer"" of tickets; in other words, Prior does not claim that Ticketmaster itself 
owns venues or organizes events to which tickets could be sold. Thus Ticketmaster does not appear to have any ability to 
increase the total number of valid tickets extant at any given time. "
617,1," Ticketmaster is not alleged to be a ""producer"" of tickets; in other words, RMG does not claim that Ticketmaster itself owns 
venues or organizes events to which tickets could be sold. Thus Ticketmaster does not appear to have any ability to increase the 
total number of valid tickets extant at any given time."
617,2," How tickets sold on the Auction site fit into this market is not clear. RMG argues that the sale of tickets on Ticketmaster's 
Auction site is part of Ticketmaster's plan to monopolize the market for ""tickets which have already been sold at retail,"" but the 
allegations regarding the Auction site do not explain whether those tickets have previously been sold at retail. Perhaps RMG 
really means to define the market as including not just ""tickets that have previously been sold at retail,"" but all tickets ever sold at 
amounts above face value? "
618,3," Another potential problem with this geographic definition is suggested by the allegation in the FACC that ""less than a dozen 
states in the U.S. even have anti-ticket reselling laws on their books."" (FACC P 13.) So in as many as 11 states, or over 20% of 
the geographic market proposed by RMG, the ""ticket resale market"" may exist, if at all, only in violation of state law. Surely RMG 
does not really intend to argue that the Sherman Act protects RMG's right to participate in an illegal market. "

629,9," To the extent that Plaintiff's request to Medco in September 2000 for a limited purpose admission, discussed above, can be 
regarded as continuing efforts to gain admission into Medco's networks, this is also insufficient to toll limitations. There is no 
evidence that Medco even responded to Plaintiff—instead, Medco wrote to United Healthcare and reiterated their position that 
Rx.com would not be accepted into their networks. See Dkt. No. 269 at Ex. N. "
630,10," Although Plaintiff does note that ""[Defendants'] success in killing off an entire class of internet mail pharmacies only occurred

documents must be properly authenticated by ""evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its

F.2d 1542, 1550-51 (9th Cir. 1989). The email attached to Greene's declaration as Exhibit E is admissible because Greene states facts giving rise to an inference 
that he has personal knowledge of it. See Orr, 285 F.3d at 777; Hal Roach Studios, 896 F.2d at 1550. The document confirms 
that MHG received a copy of the email. The CMG email, moreover, was part of a string of emails that originated from MHG's 
email address; the first of these emails is signed ""Joshua Greene."" This also supports an inference that Greene received a copy 
of CMG's email. Plaintiffs also argue that the email contains inadmissible hearsay. The court overrules this objection, because Roesler worked 
 [*18] for CMG, which was the exclusive licensing agent of MMLLC. Roesler's out-of-court statements are therefore not hearsay, 
but party admissions. See FED.R.EVID. 801(d)(2)(D) (HN5[

is stuff that happened three years ago. And the fact that we moved down this far and we don't have that information is a little 
weird. So --."" (Greene Depo. at 468:6-13). Greene was then interrupted by his counsel who requested a break. Before the 
parties went off the record, Greene stated, ""-- I can't make anything up."" (Id. at 468:14-16). After going back on the record, 
Greene ultimately stated that he was unable to identify when plaintiffs unlawfully used image BC-3. (Id. at 469:18-23)."
655,62," Plaintiffs argue that the screen shot purporting to show PR-217 should also be excluded because  [*32] it was not produced 
until the last day of discovery. The court declines to exclude this evidence, however, because unlike that purporting to show BC-
3, the screen shot depicting PR-217 was produced in sufficient time for plaintiffs to examine Greene regarding his knowledge of 
the document. Delayed production of the screen shot, therefore, was harmless. Defendants have adduced no evidence -- timely or otherwise - purporting to show that plaintiffs infringed image BS-80. "

665,113," The court consolidated these cases, and on December 14, 2005, consolidated two additional actions that had been filed in 
the Southern District of Indiana, but had been transferred on August 9, 2005 -- CMG Worldwide, Inc., et al. v. Tom Kelley 
Studios and CMG Worldwide, Inc. et al. v. The Milton H. Green Archives, Inc. Anna Strasberg was not a party to the Indiana 
actions. On February 6, 2006, the court issued a scheduling order, which denominated the CMG Parties plaintiffs and the MHG 
Parties defendants for purposes of the consolidated actions. The court based this order on the fact that the Indiana actions were 
the first filed actions. In their complaints, CMG and MMLLC allege that they own the ""Right of Publicity and Privacy in and to the 
Marilyn Monroe name, image, and  [*67] persona"" that was created by ""the Indiana Right of Publicity Act, I.C. § 32-36-1-1 et 
seq., and other applicable right of publicity laws."" They assert that MHG and Kelley have infringed this right by using Marilyn 
Monroe's name, image and likeness ""in connection with the sale, solicitation, promotion, and advertising of products, 
merchandise, goods and services"" without their consent or authorization. (First Amended Complaint against Milton H. Greene

 [*75] 18. Defendants also assert that Tom Kelley's declaration contains evidence of interference, but no such declaration was 
submitted."
667,119," Defendants' opposition focuses largely on a claim that plaintiffs' assertion of Monroe's right of publicity was a 
misrepresentation designed to disrupt their business relationships with third parties; they base this claim on an assertion that 
Monroe was domiciled in New York, where there is no statutory posthumous right of publicity. (See Def.'s Opp. at 15). As 
plaintiffs correctly note, even if a jury were to determine that Monroe was domiciled in New York at the time of her death, 
defendants would still have to raise triable issues of fact showing that their claims against plaintiffs have merit. (See Pl.'s Reply 
at 4-5)."
667,120," Indeed, the only admissible evidence Greene presented was an email from CMG dated October 26, 2001, purporting to 
require Cedco, a calendar manufacturer, to remove Milton Greene's captions from photos of Monroe. (See Greene Decl., Exh. 
B). Even if this email rose to the level of intentional interference with defendants' contractual relations -- which it likely does not, 
as defendants have adduced no evidence of a contract with Cedco  [*76] whereby MHG was guaranteed to receive 
photographer credit in a particular font size or location -- it occurs outside the two-year statute of limitations period for actions for "
668,," tortious interference with contractual relations. See CAL. CIV. PROC. § 339. This email was written in October 2001, and MHG 
did not file its action against MMLLC and Anna Strasberg until March 25, 2005 -- more than two years later."

Cedco required that Milton Greene receive a particular credit. Additionally, the email is merely a demand that Cedco change the

673,136," Plaintiffs argue that Roesler did not clearly admit that CMG's website displayed PR-217. (Pl.'s Reply at 22). They note that the 
screen shot of the CMG website appears on a computer desktop background that also contains photographs of Marilyn Monroe, 
and argue that when Roesler identified MHG images of Monroe ""on the right,"" he was referring to the desktop background 
images. (Id.). The court finds this unpersuasive. Roesler was shown the exhibit that allegedly demonstrated CMG's use of PR-
217, and asked to identify ""th[e] website"" depicted in the screen shot. (Roesler Depo. at 348:2). He identified it as a page on the 
Marilyn Monroe site hosted by CMG. (Id. at 348:3-8). He stated that the website included photographs of Monroe and that some 
of the photographs had been taken by Milton Greene. (Id. at 348:9-16). As a result, it is clear from Roesler's testimony that he 
was referring to the Monroe images  [*97] on the website shown in the screen shot, not the desktop background images, which 
are plainly not a part of the CMG-hosted site."
673,137," The image is, in this regard, significantly different than the ""six-second"" excerpt from a performance by James Newton that 
the Beastie Boys incorporated into various sound recordings was a de minimis use. See Newton, 388 F.3d at 1192. Here, a 
whole photograph was appropriated and displayed as a distinct image on CMG's website. "
674,138," Plaintiffs argue that defendants have not shown that MMLLC or Anna Strasberg were aware that any of MHG's photographs 
were used on the CMG-operated website. (Pl.'s Mem. at 23). Plaintiffs, however, have adduced evidence that CMG was the 
exclusive licensing agent for MMLLC; it was therefore operating the Marilyn Monroe website on MMLLC's behalf."

674,142," Greene also proffers two letters he purportedly wrote to CMG in 1995 and 1997 regarding unauthorized use of MHG images. 
(See Greene Decl., P 19, Exh. F). Neither of these documents relates to BC-3 or PR-217, the images presently at issue, 
however. The letters are thus irrelevant as they do not tend to show that CMG recklessly disregarded a warning letter about 
these particular images. See FED.R.EVID. 401 (HN56[

declared to be illegal."" 15 U.S.C. § 1."
680,2," The court included this note as a follow-up to its finding that ""the Act specifically makes it unlawful for a person 1) to

in the price of a commodity . . . in § 204."" Id. at 10. "
681,3," The Tenth Circuit also has not addressed this issue.  [*14] In Harolds Stores, the Tenth Circuit was presented with the question 
of whether § 203(A) prohibits unilateral acts in restraint of trade. The court answered in the affirmative and found that it ""must 
presume that the Oklahoma Legislature intended the word 'act' in Okla. Stat. tit. 79, § [203(A)] to carry its ordinary meaning of 
something done voluntarily by a person."" 82 F.3d at 1549. The court supported this finding by citing, among other things, OKLA. 
STAT. tit. 25, § 1. Section 1 provides that ""[w]ords used in any statute are to be understood in their ordinary sense, except when 
a contrary intention plainly appears . . . ."" Id. This Court finds that Harolds Stores does not preclude a claim against each of the 
counterclaim defendants for their collective activity in restraint of trade under § 203(A) simply because the court used the word 
""person"" (in the singular rather than plural). Harolds Stores did not involve allegations of collective activity. A finding that a single 
entity may collectively ""act"" in restraint of trade also does not contravene the ordinary understanding of the plain language of § 
203(A). Further, Champagne Metals v. Ken-Mac Metals, Inc., 458 F.3d 1073 (10th Cir. 2006),  [*15] is distinguishable. Unlike 
this case, Champagne Metals did not involve a ""single entity"" under Copperweld. The established group of competitors had the 
potential capability to conspire or combine in restraint of trade in violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act and § 203(A). Id. at 1091."
681,4," This Court has already ruled that counterclaim defendants should be treated as a ""single entity"" for § 1 purposes. As 
counterclaim defendants note, Phonak's allegations regarding the interrelationship of counterclaim defendants remain 
unchanged. Dkt. # 129, at 10 n.4. In the second amended counterclaim, Phonak alleges that counterclaim defendants are either 
(1) officers or owners of the same corporations, (2) parent and subsidiary corporations, or (3) sister corporations. Id. Phonak 
further alleges that all of the counterclaim defendants engaged in the collective activity and describes the specific activity. 
Mitchael v. Intracorp, Inc., 179 F.3d 847, 857 (10th Cir. 1999), cited by counterclaim defendants, is inapplicable. The court noted 
that the plaintiffs failed to present evidence of any involvement by the parent or sister corporations or any evidence that 
""Intracorp [wa]s merely the alter ego of its  [*16] parent or sister corporations."" Id. at 857 n.12. Here, counterclaim defendants 
qualify as a § 1 single entity. Thus, assuming the Oklahoma Supreme Court would extend the Copperweld doctrine to § 203(A), 
Phonak has adequately pled counterclaim defendants' interrelationship and unity of interest for purposes of alleging unilateral 
action under Oklahoma antitrust law. "
683,5," Out of an abundance of caution, the Court finds that Phonak's claim sufficiently crosses ""some threshold of plausibility"" and 
thus this ""patent antitrust case should be permitted to go into its inevitably costly and protracted discovery phase."" Twombly, 127 
S. Ct. at 1966 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Further, because Phonak also asserts the affirmative defense of 
patent misuse, which is broader than its antitrust counterclaim, see C.R. Bard Inc. v. M3 Sys. Inc., 157 F.3d 1340, 1372 (Fed. 
Cir. 1998) (""Patent misuse is viewed as a broader wrong than antitrust violation because of the economic power that may be 
derived from the patentee's right to exclude.""), discovery over the sham litigation issue will occur regardless of the Court's ruling 
here. In other words, because a ""patent [may be] misused when its owner uses  [*23] it in violation of the antitrust laws,"" 
HERBERT F. SCHWARTZ, PATENT LAW AND PRACTICE 192 (BNA Books 2006), discovery pertaining to the affirmative 
defense of patent misuse necessarily overlaps with discovery pertaining to a counterclaim of sham litigation. Thus, any increase 
in cost and time will be de minimus. "

District Court for the District of New Jersey, which HN3[
] requires that ""[o]n motions for summary judgment, each side shall furnish a statement which sets forth material facts as to which there exists or does not exist a genuine issue."" D.N.J. L. Civ. R. 
56.1. Pursuant to Local Rule 56.1, Defendants submitted separate Statements of Material Facts as to each IP Plaintiff against whom 
Defendants have moved for summary judgment, and Plaintiffs submitted Responses to each of those Statements of Material 
Facts. (Defendants' Statements of Material Facts as to the IP Plaintiffs will be cited as ""Def. Stmt. (Plaintiff name) at P    ;

to Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment, to which Defendants submitted a Response. (Plaintiffs' omnibus Statement of 
Material Facts will be cited as ""Pl. Stmt. at P    ; Defendants' Response will be cited as ""Def. Resp. Stmt. at P    "")."
693,4," In their omnibus Surreply Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment, the IP Plaintiffs 
suggest that Defendants bear the burden of negating the injury element of Plaintiffs' claims. See Pl. Surreply at 3 (stating that 
""the summary judgment rules put the burden on Defendants to prove the absence of injury"" and ""[t]he burden remains on 
Defendants to show that there are no disputed facts on summary judgment and that there is no injury. . . ."") (italics in original). 
Such a suggestion overstates a moving party's summary judgment burden with respect to an issue on which the nonmoving 
party bears the ultimate burden of proof. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325 (where the nonmoving party bears the burden of proof on 
an issue, the moving party's burden on summary judgment ""may be discharged by 'showing' - that is, pointing out to the district 
court - that there is an absence of evidence to  [*17] support the nonmoving party's case""). "
694,5," On February 6, 2008, Defendants submitted a Motion for Summary Judgment with respect to the Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs' 
federal antitrust claim for declaratory and injunctive relief under Section 16 of the Clayton Act. See Sec. Am. Compl., Ct. I. On 
February 11, 2008, counsel for the IP Plaintiffs advised me that, without admission or concession of any factual allegations or 
legal arguments in Defendants' papers, the IP Plaintiffs do not contest Defendants' Motion or the dismissal of the federal 
antitrust claim. Accordingly, on February 12, 2008, I entered an order granting Defendants' Motion and dismissing with prejudice 
the IP Plaintiffs' federal antitrust claim. In their submissions relating to the above-referenced Motion, Defendants and the IP 
Plaintiffs agree that the dismissal of the IP Plaintiffs' antitrust claims does not divest the district court of jurisdiction over the IP 
Plaintiffs' remaining claims. I similarly  [*20] conclude that pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367, the district court may retain jurisdiction 
over the IP Plaintiffs' state law claims."
694,6," In my Report and Recommendation dated March 1, 2007, I recommended dismissal of Count III of the Second Amended 
Complaint, which alleged unlawful monopolization under certain state antitrust and/or consumer protection statutes (the ""Walker 
Process/sham litigation claims""). The IP Plaintiffs' objections to the March 1, 2007 Report have been briefed and argued before 
the District Court."
694,7," HN8[
] Under United States Supreme Court precedent, indirect purchasers generally do not have standing to seek damages 
under federal antitrust law. See Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977). See also 
Hanover Shoe v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 392 U.S. 481, 88 S. Ct. 2224, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1231 (1968). "
695,8," The fact of injury element is also referred to interchangeably as ""injury-in-fact,"" ""impact"" and ""fact of damage."" See, e.g., ABA

452, 483 (3d Cir. 1998)."
695,9," I note that once a plaintiff has established the fact of injury element of an antitrust claim, the standard of proof required with 
respect to the amount of damages is less stringent and is satisfied by a reasonable approximation. See, e.g., J. Truett Payne, 
451 U.S. 557, 566-67, 101 S. Ct. 1923, 68 L. Ed. 2d 442 (1981). The relatively relaxed standard of proof for the amount of 
damages recognizes the principle that ""it does not 'come with very good grace' for the wrongdoer to insist upon specific proof of 
the injury which it has itself inflicted."" Id. at 567 (quoting Hetzel v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 169 U.S. 26, 18 S. Ct. 255, 42 L. Ed.

696,12," Based on the foregoing, it appears likely that purchases of branded or generic K-Dur by members of the PBA Funds were 
made both in New York, where active members reside, and in other, unidentified states where retirees and their beneficiaries 
reside. On this point, I note that although the IP Plaintiffs generally have argued that a TPP's claims are governed by the law of 
the state where its members' purchases are made, Plaintiffs have not identified which states' laws - other than New York - may 
potentially be applicable to GLHP's claims."
696,13," Because GLHP members are Michigan residents, it is likely that all or most of their purchases of K-Dur or its generic 
equivalents were made in the state  [*26] of Michigan."

that he was injured by the alleged anticompetitive conduct which is the subject of the claim. Sec Nemser Report at 7-8. Similarly, 
loss or injury is an essential element of a claim under Section 349. Id. at 8. Finally, a plaintiff pursuing an unjust enrichment 
claim must be able to show that it would be inequitable for Defendants to retain the benefit of its purchases of K-Dur, e.g., that 
Defendants' alleged unlawful conduct precluded the plaintiff from purchasing a generic version of the drug and/or caused it to

698,18," The IP Plaintiffs also acknowledge that, during certain periods of time, the PBA Funds did receive rebates from Schering for 
purchases of its products, including K-Dur. See Pl. Resp. Stmt. (PBA/GLHP) at P 5. However, Plaintiffs state, the data provided 
to the PBA Funds by their PBMs did not disaggregate the rebate amounts between different drugs. Id. See also Hennessey Dep. 
at 60:10-61:19 (Exh. 1 to 7/20/07 O'Shaughnessy Decl.)."
698,19," The IP Plaintiffs have asserted that Schering paid no rebates to the PBA Funds' PBM during the period from 1999 through 
2001 and, thus, ""there is no rebate data which would change or affect the calculation of before and after  [*34] prices paid by the 
PBA Funds for K-Dur during 1999."" See Pl. Br. at 22-23. See also Pl. Resp. Stmt. (PBA/GLHP) at P 5. However, Plaintiffs 
provide no citation to the record in support of this statement."
698,20," Dr. Rubinfeld's analysis of Schering rebate data appears to indicate that NPA and CareMark, the PBMs for the PBA Funds, 
received average quarterly rebates of only 2.7 percent. See Rubinfeld Report at Exh. 10b. "
699,21," To the extent the evidence suggests that rebates may diminish, but not negate, the PBA Funds' injury, such evidence goes to 
the amount of damages, which is subject to a less stringent standard of proof and may be established by a reasonable 
approximation. See, e.g., J. Truett Payne, 451 U.S. 557, 566-67, 101 S. Ct. 1923, 68 L. Ed. 2d 442 (1981) (noting that ""it does 
not 'come with very good grace' for the wrongdoer to insist upon specific proof of the injury which it has itself inflicted"") (quoting 
Hetzel v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 169 U.S. 26, 18 S. Ct. 255, 42 L. Ed. 648 (1898)). "
700,22," According to Dr. French's analysis, Rx America received rebates in 13 quarters, and AdvancePCS received rebates in nine 
quarters. See French Suppl. Aff. at Table 6. Table 6 indicates that an entity identified as ""PCS-CPA"" received rebates in 23 
quarters, but it is not clear whether there is any relationship between that entity and the PCS that served as GLHP's PBM. Id."
700,23," Because I conclude that the IP Plaintiffs do not allege conduct within the ambit of the MCPA, I need not decide whether 
GLHP's claims involve purchases made for personal, family or household purposes. However, I note that it is doubtful that a 
TPP's claims brought on its own behalf - rather than on behalf its members - could be construed to involve purchases made as a 
conduit for its members' personal, family or household purposes. See Zine v. Chrysler Corp., 236 Mich. App. 261, 600 N.W.2d 
384, 392-94 (Mich. Ct. App. 1999). "
704,1," The Honorable Janet C. Hall, of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, sitting by designation. "
717,1," Since 2003, the interchange fee has been set at $ .46 for on-premise transactions (i.e., transactions at ATMs deployed on a 
bank's premises), and $ .54 for off-premise transactions. See Lynn Decl. P 14. "
723,2," It also bears noting that whereas the venture at issue in Freeman was designed to exclude competition from  [**34] the market 
by combining competing MLS databases into one comprehensive database, the Star Network competes with other ATM 
networks in any given geographical region. Although not legally dispositive, this distinguishing feature provides one more reason 
why the interchange fee does not ""facially appear"" to be anticompetitive. See infra. at Part C. "
724,3," In recent briefing, Defendants argue that because Plaintiffs do not directly pay the interchange fee, Plaintiffs lack standing to 
challenge the fee under the Sherman Act. Defendants find some support in the Ninth Circuit's decision in Kendall v. Visa U.S.A., 
Inc., 518 F.3d 1042, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 5032, 2008 WL 613924 (9th Cir. Mar. 7, 2008), in which the court held that 
merchants challenging a credit-card interchange fee lacked standing to sue because the plaintiffs ""have no contractual 
relationship with the Consortiums directly, nor are they charged the interchange fee directly."" 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 5032, [WL] 
at *5 (emphasis added) (relying on Illinois Brick v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 746, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977)). Without 
deciding the issue, the Court notes that an exception to Illinois Brick would apply if there is no realistic possibility that the Star 
Network's members -- who both pay and receive the interchange fee -- would sue the network for antitrust violations. See Royal 
Printing Co. v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., 621 F.2d 323, 326 (9th Cir. 1980). Either way, the Court  [**39] declines to resolve the 
standing issue here, because it would be more properly addressed after adequate briefing and after Plaintiffs have reframed 
their claim under the rule of reason. "
730,1," AWB Limited, an Australian corporation, ""is the exclusive manager and marketer of all bulk wheat exports from Australia,"" and 
AWB (U.S.A.) Limited, a Delaware corporation, is a subsidiary wholly owned and controlled by AWB Limited. (Compl. PP 12-13.) 
All references to the complaint in this opinion are to the Consolidated Class Action Complaint (Doc. # 6). "
731,2," Wheat futures contracts are traded on the Chicago Board of Trade, the Kansas City Board of Trade, and the Minneapolis Grain 
Exchange. (Compl. P 56.) According to plaintiffs, ""[a]lthough each  [**6] exchange focuses on different classes of wheat, prices 
on each exchange tend to move together."" (Id.) "
732,3," The complaint references two independent reports, one commissioned by the United Nations  [**8] and the other by the 
Australian government, detailing the illicit activities of the Iraqi regime in relation to its participation in the OFFP. (Compl. PP 99-
101.) The Court has considered these reports in assessing the instant motion to dismiss. See Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., 
282 F.3d 147, 153 (2d Cir. 2002) (noting that HN1[
] on a motion to dismiss, the court may consider documents ""incorporated 
in [the complaint] by reference""). "
733,4," In contrast, HN3[
] where a defendant challenges the factual basis for subject matter jurisdiction, a court is ""not obligated to 
accord presumptive truthfulness to the allegations of the complaint"" and ""may weigh the evidence on the record accompanying 
the Rule 12(b)(1) motion, or hold an evidentiary hearing, and decide for itself the merits of the jurisdictional dispute."" Dow Jones, 
237 F. Supp. 2d at 404; see Filetech S.A. v. France Telecom S.A., 157 F.3d 922, 932 (2d Cir. 1998)."
733,5," Prior to the FTAIA's enactment, courts commonly applied the ""effects test,"" developed by Judge Learned Hand in United States 
v. Aluminum Co. of America (""Alcoa""), 148 F.2d 416, 444 (2d Cir. 1945), to determine  [**14] when foreign conduct fell within the 
jurisdictional reach of the Sherman Act. The Supreme Court has summarized the effects test, stating that ""it is well established 
by now that the Sherman Act applies to foreign conduct that was meant to produce and did in fact produce some substantial 
effect in the United States."" Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. California, 509 U.S. 764, 796, 113 S. Ct. 2891, 125 L. Ed. 2d 612 (1993), 
citing Alcoa, 148 F.2d at 444. ""Application of the effects test, however, . . . proved difficult and the precise extraterritorial reach of 
the Sherman Act remain[ed] less than crystal clear."" United States v. LSL Biotechnologies, 379 F.3d 672, 678 (9th Cir. 2004). In 
an effort to clarify the extraterritorial reach of the Sherman Act, Congress enacted the FTAIA in 1982. The Supreme Court has 
observed that it is not clear whether the FTAIA ""amends existing law or merely codifies it."" Hartford Fire, 509 U.S. at 796 n.23. 
Given the parties' agreement that the FTAIA applies at least to plaintiffs' Sherman Act claims (see P. Mem. 7 n.6), the Court will 
apply the FTAIA to determine whether the jurisdictional reach of the Sherman Act extends to the alleged extraterritorial conduct 
in this case. "
734,6," Although the Second Circuit in Filetech characterized the FTAIA's limitations as a constraint on courts' ""jurisdiction,"" 157 F.3d 
at 931, the express  [**16] language of the FTAIA -- i.e., that the Sherman Act ""shall not apply"" to certain kinds of foreign 
conduct -- suggests a limitation, not on a court's power to decide the case, but rather, on the substantive applicability of the 
statute. Although the Supreme Court has not decided this issue, see IB Areeda P 272i2, at 296, the Court in another context has 
recently cautioned against the ""profligate"" use of jurisdictional terminology when discussing potential defects in a plaintiff's claim. 
Arbaugh v. Y&H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 510, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097 (2006). Arbaugh highlighted the tendency of 
courts to term the non-existence of a critical fact a ""jurisdictional defect"" rather than merely the failure to prove an element of the 
claim -- so called ""drive-by jurisdictional rulings."" Id. at 511. As this Court has previously noted, ""such imprecision has significant 
consequences."" Ayyash v. Bank Al-Madina, No. 04 Civ. 9201 (GEL), 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9677, 2006 WL 587342, at *4 n.2 
(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 9, 2006) (noting that ""[u]nlike merits challenges, challenges to a court's subject matter jurisdiction cannot be 
waived and can be raised even after trial has concluded and judgment has been entered,"" and that ""factual disputes as to 
jurisdictional  [**17] questions are typically resolved by the judge in a pre-trial hearing, not by a jury at trial""). Arbaugh held that 
""when Congress does not rank a statutory limitation on coverage as jurisdictional, courts should treat the restriction as 
nonjurisdictional in character."" 546 U.S. at 516. Because nothing in the statutory language of the FTAIA indicates that its 
limitations are jurisdictional, Arbaugh may require that the Second Circuit review its treatment of that issue. In this case, 
however, none of the parties challenges the characterization of the issue as jurisdictional in nature, and this Court is, in any 
event, bound by the Second Circuit's decisions until such time as they are directly overruled by that court or the Supreme Court. "
735,7," See, e.g., David Streitfeld, A Global Need for Grain That Farms Can't Fill, N.Y. Times, Mar. 9, 2008, at Al (noting that global 
prices for wheat have recently ""tripled, partly because of a drought in Australia and bad harvests elsewhere and also because of 
unslaked global demand for crackers, bread and noodles"")."
735,8," In 1998, immediately prior to the alleged market foreclosure, Iraq purchased 6% (or 0.18 mmt) of its wheat from the United 
States. (Compl. P 67.) United States wheat exports during that same time averaged 31.1 mmt annually, of which 13.8 mmt was 
hard red winter wheat. (Id. P 52.) Iraqi purchases of U.S.-grown wheat thus constituted 0.58 percent of total U.S. wheat exports 
and 1.3 percent of total U.S. hard  [**22] red winter wheat exports. (Id. PP 52, 61, 67.) Although it is possible that U.S-grown 
wheat could have captured more than a 6% share of the Iraqi wheat market had the market remained open to U.S.-grown wheat 
from 1999 to 2003, any estimate of the market share U.S.-grown wheat would have had absent the alleged conspiracy would be 
inherently speculative, particularly given the deteriorating relations between the two countries that ultimately led to the invasion 
of Iraq by U.S. forces in March 2003."
735,9," Specifically, plaintiffs' citation to Daishowa International v. North Coast Export Co., No. 81 Civ. 574, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
13018, 1982 WL 1850 (N.D. Cal. May 24, 1982) is of little value because that decision predated the enactment of the FTAIA. 
Similarly, plaintiffs' citations to MM Global Services, Inc. v. Dow Chemical Co., No. 02 Civ. 1107, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4139, 
2004 WL 556577 (D. Conn. March 18, 2004), and Coors Brewing Co. v. Miller Brewing Co., 889 F. Supp. 1394 (D. Colo. 1995), "
736,," are unpersuasive because the former involved allegations that  [**24] defendants specifically intended to obstruct competition in 
the United States market, which plaintiffs do not allege here, and the latter premised its holding on the view that the foreign and 
U.S. markets at issue were effectively a single market (i.e., ""the North American beer market,"" Coors Brewing, 889 F. Supp. at 
1398), which, even on plaintiffs' pleadings, is not the case here."
736,10, See infra at 22.
736,11," Because plaintiffs have failed to allege a sufficiently ""direct"" effect on domestic trade or commerce, the Court need not address 
whether that effect was ""substantial"" or ""reasonably foreseeable,"" 15 U.S.C. § 6a(1),  [**25] or whether that effect properly ""gives 
rise"" to a Sherman Act claim, id. § 6a(2). "
737,12," Although one of the defendants  [**31] in this action is AWB (U.S.A.) Limited, a Delaware corporation that is wholly owned and 
controlled by defendant AWB Limited, an Australian corporation (Compl. PP 12-13), plaintiffs do not allege that the American 
subsidiary engaged in any independent commercial transactions with the government of Iraq."
737,13," Gulf Oil explained that, HN12[
] in contrast to § 1 of the Sherman Act, the ""in commerce"" language of the Robinson-Patman Act extends only to persons or activities ""within the flow"" of commerce among the states or with foreign nations -- i.e., ""the "
738,," practical, economic continuity in the generation of goods and services for interstate [or foreign] markets and their transport and 
distribution to the consumer"" -- and does not extend to all activities that ""affect"" such commerce. Gulf Oil, 419 U.S. at 195; see 
United States v. Am. Bldg. Maint. Indus., 422 U.S. 271, 277, 95 S. Ct. 2150, 45 L. Ed. 2d 177 (1975) (noting that ""in commerce"" 
language was not intended to be coextensive with reach of congressional power under Commerce Clause, and was intentionally 
narrower than Sherman Act's ""affecting commerce"" language); Rotec, 348 F.3d at 1122. "
739,14, See supra at 12-15.
739,15," Indeed, plaintiffs' claimed injury in this case is significantly more indirect than the injury alleged by the plaintiffs in Illinois Brick 
Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977). In Illinois Brick, the plaintiffs were ""indirect purchasers of 
concrete block, which pass[ed] through two separate levels in the chain of distribution before reaching"" plaintiffs. Id. at 726. 
Plaintiffs alleged that defendants had engaged in a price-fixing conspiracy resulting in overcharges that were, at least in part, 
passed on to plaintiffs and not absorbed at the first two levels of distribution. Id. at 727. The Supreme Court, citing the risk of 
duplicative recovery and the litigative burdens associated with attempting to allocate the overcharge among direct and indirect 
purchasers, held that only direct purchasers had standing to bring suit. Id. at 730-31, 735-38. In this case, however, plaintiffs do 
not claim that they were injured as a result of lost sales to domestic wheat exporters stemming from the foreclosure of the Iraqi 
wheat market; rather, plaintiffs claim that they were  [**38] harmed in their sales to everyone but domestic wheat exporters on 
the theory that their lost sales to domestic wheat exporters caused an increase in Ending Stocks, which, in turn, caused a 
decrease in domestic wheat prices. Accordingly, unlike in Illinois Brick, plaintiffs' alleged injuries were incurred, not through the 
immediate chain of distribution for wheat, but rather, through the much more convoluted global ""wheat pricing mechanism."" 
(Compl. P 93.) "
740,16," Plaintiffs contend that wheat exporters are  [**39] inferior antitrust plaintiffs because ""unlike American wheat farmers, who 
actually manifested direct 'out of pocket' losses when they sold their wheat at depressed prices, any injuries claimed by the 
exporter would be highly speculative, i.e., the profits it would have made had it been able to procure and deliver the wheat for 
less than its winning bid price."" (P. Mem. 18.) Plaintiffs' argument rests on their factual contention -- advanced for the first time in 
their opposition brief (and not in their pleadings) -- that ""[w]hen an exporter bids on a wheat tender, it does not actually possess 
the wheat that it offers to sell. Instead it merely offers a price at which it believes it could procure and deliver the wheat."" (Id.) 
Thus, according to plaintiffs, ""[a]n exporter may profit or lose money on any contract, depending on whether and how much 
wheat prices have gone up between the bid on the tender and the actual purchase of the wheat."" (Id.) Even if plaintiffs' 
description of the export tender/bidding process is accurate, the injuries suffered by wheat exporters are certainly no more 
speculative than plaintiffs' claimed injuries, which would require the Court to engage in ""hopeless  [**40] speculation concerning 
the relative effect of an alleged conspiracy in the market [for wheat in Iraq] on the price of [wheat in United States], where 
countless other market variables could have intervened to affect those pricing decisions."" Reading Indus., Inc. v. Kennecott 
Copper Corp., 631 F.2d 10, 14 (2d Cir. 1980)."
740,17," For the same reasons, even apart from the jurisdictional infirmity of plaintiffs' Sherman Act and Clayton Act claims, those 
claims would still have to be dismissed pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for lack of antitrust standing. See Blue Tree Hotels, 
369 F.3d at 220 (noting that HN15[
] the antitrust standing requirement ""applies to all private actions filed under [Clayton Act] §"
740,4," , regardless of the type of antitrust claim involved"" (internal quotation marks omitted))."
740,18," Although Al-Turki characterized the limit on RICO's extraterritorial application as a constraint on courts' ""subject-matter 
jurisdiction,"" 100 F.3d at 1051, plaintiffs point out that the Supreme Court's decision in Arbaugh, 546 U.S. 500, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 
163 L. Ed. 2d 1097 (see supra note 6), suggests that the inquiry into RICO's extraterritorial reach should not be treated as a 
question of subject matter jurisdiction. (P. Mem. 38 n.30.) As this Court previously noted in Ayyash v. Bank Al-Madina, however, 
HN17[
] the Court is ""bound by the Court of Appeals' decisions until such time as they are directly overruled by that court or the 
Supreme Court."" 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9677, 2006 WL 587342, at *4 n.2. Because no intervening Supreme Court or Second 
Circuit case has held otherwise, the Court must continue to treat  [**43] the limitation on RICO's extraterritorial application as a 
jurisdictional constraint."
740,19," Although the Second Circuit recognized that the application to RICO of these two tests, drawn from the securities and antitrust 
contexts, may not be appropriate, see 100 F.3d at 1052, it nevertheless applied those tests in Al-Turki because, as in this case, 
the parties assumed that those tests were applicable. To date, no other test has been established by the Second Circuit or 
proposed by the parties in this case. "
741,20," The Second Circuit in Al-Turki also described a slightly different version of the effects test based on the antitrust laws. See Al-
Turki, 100 F.3d at 1052 (noting that in ""antitrust cases, the [extraterritoriality] analysis proceeds along similar lines [to securities 
cases], but there is more emphasis on the effects of the relevant conduct in the United States, and less emphasis on where that 
conduct took place""). As noted above, see supra note 5, the effects test in the antitrust context examines whether the ""foreign 
conduct . . . was meant to produce and did in fact produce some substantial effect in the United States."" Hartford Fire, 509 U.S. 
at 796, citing Alcoa, 148 F.2d at 444.  [**44] The requisite ""substantial"" effect must also be ""direct."" Alcoa, 148 F.2d at 424; see 
IB Areeda P 272d, at 280."
741,21, See supra at 12-15.
741,22," Ayyash, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9677, 2006 WL 587342, at *6 (noting that ""courts have held HN18[
] the [RICO] jurisdictional 
requirement satisfied where a wire transfer into or from the United States is integral to the fraud"")."
741,23," As a result, even if plaintiffs could overcome AWB's jurisdictional challenge, their RICO claim would still be dismissed for lack 
of standing because their injury was not ""proximately caused"" by defendants' acts. Baisch, 346 F.3d at 373; see Lerner v. Fleet 
Bank, N.A. 318 F.3d 113, 129-30 (2d Cir. 2003). This outcome is not surprising as ""Congress modeled [RICO] on the civil-action 
provision of the federal antitrust laws,"" Holmes, 503 U.S. at 267-68, and as explained above, plaintiffs also lack antitrust 
standing. "
749,1," In Walker Process, plaintiffs Food Machinery & Chemical Corp. filed suit alleging that Walker violated Food Machinery's patent. 
In response, Walker denied the infringement and, later, counterclaimed, charging that Food Machinery had engaged in an illegal 
monopoly ""by fraudulently and in bad faith"" maintaining its patent. Walker Process Equip., Inc. v. Food Mach. and Chem. Corp., 
382 U.S. 172, 174, 86 S. Ct. 347, 15 L. Ed. 2d 247(1965).  [**4] Therefore, rather than just claiming fraud, the defendant ""prayed 
that Food Machinery's conduct be declared a violation of the antitrust laws and sought recovery of treble damages."" Id. Citing the long tradition of injured parties ""attack[ing] the misuse of patent rights,"" the Court held that ""[t]o permit recovery of 
treble damages for the fraudulent procurement of the patent coupled with violation of s 2 accords with these long recognized 
procedures."" Id. at 176-77. A plaintiff making such a claim, however, would have to make two showings: 1) the patent applicant 
""knowingly and willfully misrepresent[ed] facts to the Patent Office"" (stripping the applicant of its exemption from antitrust laws) 
and 2) the illegal patent provided exclusionary power in the relevant market. Id. at 177; see also id. at 179 (Harlan, J., 
concurring)."
749,2," Class six trucks weigh 19,501-26,000 pounds; class seven trucks weigh 26,001-33,000 pounds; and class eight trucks weigh 
 [**6] 33,001 pounds or more."
749,3," ""Connecting equipment"" generally refers to the equipment used to connect a truck for transportation, including decking booms, 
saddles, and breaking units. "
750,4," Monopsony, also known as a buyer's monopoly, is a form of monopoly power in which the monopolist is a buyer who controls 
the price, volume, and/or can make other anticompetitive demands on a seller. See generally Roger D. Blair & Jeffrey L. 
Harrison [hereinafter Blair & Harrison], Antitrust Policy and Monopsony, 76 Cornell L. Rev. 297 (1991)."
750,5," The '642, '677, and '051 patents -- the ""patents-in-suit"" -- all relate to designs for connecting equipment (the '642 patent 
incorporating saddle designs and the '677 and '051 patent relating to decking booms). The  [**8] fourth relevant patent -- number 
5,465,813 (the '813 patent) -- also relates to a connecting device (a brake unit device) but it was not included in the White Mule's 
original and first amended complaint and only appears in the plaintiffs' second amended complaint."
750,6," During this period  [**10] the Ritcheys were also negotiating the sale of White Mule to a third party that had already exercised 
its option to buy the company. Due to ATC's threat, however, the buyer refrained from proceeding with the closing on the sale 
and eventually decided not to purchase White Mule. White Mule cites this outcome -- in addition to the lack of sales to other 
companies in Relevant Market One and injury to White Mule's reputation -- as a source of its damages. "
752,7," Despite the fact that all four patents are in the second amended complaint, defendants have only disclaimed the initial three 
patents identified as the ""patents-in-suit."" Therefore, regardless of my decision regarding my jurisdiction over the disclaimed 
patents, the '813 patent remains in controversy. "
755,8," Courts often point out that this requirement ensures the oft-stated adage that antitrust laws are for the protection of 
""competition, not competitors."" Brown Shoe Co. v. U.S., 370 U.S. 294, 320, 82 S. Ct. 1502, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1962)."
755,9," Other circuits interpret AGC to require courts to consider slightly different factors. For example, the Fourth Circuit examines: (1) the causal connection between an antitrust violation and harm to the plaintiffs, and whether that harm was intended, (2) 
whether the harm ""was of a type that Congress sought to redress in providing a private remedy for violations of the antitrust 
laws,"" (3) the directness of the alleged injury, (4) ""the existence of more  [**28] direct victims"" of the alleged antitrust injury; 
and (5) ""problems of identifying damages and apportioning them"" among those directly and indirectly harmed. Kloth v. Microsoft, 444 F.3d 312, 324 (4th Cir. 2006) (internal citations omitted); see also Novell, supra, 505 F. 3d at 311; 
Paycom Billing Servs., Inc. v. Mastercard Int'l Inc., 467 F.3d 283, 290-91 (2d Cir. 2006); Am. Ad Mgmt., Inc. v. Gen. Tel. Co. of 
Cal., 190 F.3d 1051, 1054 (9th Cir. 1999). "
756,," Recently, the Sixth Circuit quoted the factors listed in AGC, namely: 1) the nature of the claimant's injury; 2) the character of the 
relationship between the alleged antitrust violation and the claimant's injury; 3) the potential for duplicative recovery or complex 
apportionment of damages; and 4) the existence of more direct victims. NicSand, Inc. v. 3M Co., 507 F.3d 442, 449 (6th Cir. 
2007) (quoting AGC, supra, 459 U.S. at 545). While nominally different from previous lists, these factors focus on the same 
issues as the five factors first presented in Southaven Land Co., Inc. v. Malone & Hyde, Inc., 715 F.2d 1079, 1085 (6th Cir. 
1983). "
757,10," I recognize that White Mule argues that those third party customers not receiving White Mule's products leads to the same 
outcome for ATC: fewer competitors. But that does not mean that White Mule suffered a direct antitrust injury from ATC's 
monopolization of  [**35] Relevant Market One. Only that it lost those customers due to the patent suit. "
758,11," Most commentators agree, however, that monopsony still effects consumers because ""there is a dead-weight loss associated 
with imposition of monopsony pricing restraints. Some producers will either produce less or cease production altogether, 
resulting in less-than-optimal output of the product or service, and over the long run higher consumer prices, reduced product 
quality, or substitution of less efficient alternative products."" Telecor Commc'ns, Inc., 305 F.3d at 1136."
758,12," I note that monoponsist buyers who also have a monopoly in the output market pose the greatest threat to competition. This is 
because they have no incentive to pass lower prices on to consumers (even in the short term) and, if prices for inputs 
(temporarily) go up, such monopsonists can compensate for the increased input costs by increasing output prices. See, e.g., 
Weyerhaeuser Co. v. Ross-Simmons Hardwood Lumber Co.,   549U.S. 312   , 127 S.Ct. 1069, 1076 n.2, 166 L. Ed. 2d 911 
(2007); Been v. O.K. Indus., Inc., 495 F.3d 1217, 1232 n. 10 (""The danger of increased consumer prices is especially acute 
when the monopsonist resells in a monopolized market""); see also Blair & Harrison, supra, 76 Cornell L. Rev. at 300, 303-04, 
306 (1991) (""[T]here is no correlation between an initial decrease in prices and any overall long-run benefits to consumers.""). "
759,13," This also does not mean that all monopsonistic buyers violate antitrust law by bargaining for uncompetitive prices. Antitrust 
laws only prevent market actors from setting uncompetitive prices below incremental costs (i.e. ""predatory"" prices). Kartell v. 
Blue Shield of Mass., 749 F.2d 922, 927 (1st Cir. 1984)."
759,14," An all or nothing supply case allows a monopsony buyer to purchase the maximum quantity a supplier will make available at a 
particular price when the supplier's alternative is to sell nothing. Blair & Harrison, supra, 76 Cornell L. Rev. at 317. In such a 
situation, colluding buyers -- or a buyer with an exclusivity agreement -- could obtain a privately optimal quantity at the supplier's 
lowest  [**44] price point. This is to the buyer's benefit because, in contrast to the classic monopsony model in which the 
monopsonist must reduce the quantity purchased to lower prices, a monopsonist ""would prefer to pay the lower price without 
reducing the quantity purchased."" Id. at 316. "
760,15," Plaintiffs also concede that ""Defendants are not alleged to have entered into an exclusive agreement to get a better price, 
rather Defendants attempted to prevent White Mule from selling its products to anyone else."" [Doc. 45 at 16]."
760,16," Notably, the patent infringement claims in this case, if successful, could have provided ATC with a monopoly, rather than a 
monopsony, in Relevant Market Two. See section D.4.c. "
762,17," White Mule's admissions that the technology was known and used by others does not contradict this statement, nor does the 
existence of other potential customers. "
763,18," I never issued an order restraining White Mule from selling its products. To be sure, ATC sought a temporary restraining order 
on February 20, 2007, whereon I had a telephone  [**56] conference with the parties. During the call, I undertook to ascertain 
whether I needed to consider the merits of defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order, or whether such consideration 
could be deferred pending a preliminary injunction hearing. After learning from defendants that they were particularly concerned 
about the shipment of 3,000 saddles to a potential competitor, I asked White Mule's counsel when White Mule planned to deliver 
the 3,000 saddles. White Mule's counsel responded that delivery had not yet been requested, and that no request for delivery 
was anticipated in the next several weeks. I then asked White Mule's counsel whether White Mule would agree to notify both the 
Court and defense counsel when it received the request to deliver the 3,000 saddles. White Mule's counsel consented to the 
same, and I set the matter for a preliminary injunction hearing in April, 2007 On February 22, 2007, I issued an order memorializing the agreement. It stated that White Mule would not: deliver, transfer title, or otherwise alter the present status of the 3000 units that are the subject of the defendants' counter-
claim without giving notice promptly to counsel and the court  [**57] after it has received instruction to deliver said units to 
plaintiff's customer, and the court has thereafter conducted further proceedings re. defendants' motion for temporary 
restraining order/preliminary injunction. [Doc. 17 at 1]. This was not a ""temporary restraining order""; it was, rather, a memorialization of plaintiffs' agreement to provide sufficient notice 
to the defendants if a potential order became actual, so that a hearing on equitable relief could be scheduled and held, and a 
decision reached on the merits of defendants' demand for such relief. Had this order constituted a temporary restraining order, it 
would: 1) have so stated, with the appropriate precatory language; and 2) would not have referred to ""further proceedings re. 
defendants' motion for temporary restraining order . . . ."" Defendants withdrew the motion for a temporary restraining order/preliminary injunction on March 12, 2007 [Doc. 21]. "
766,19," Even if the plaintiffs'  [**67] claims cleared the ""commercial advertising or promotion"" hurdle, most of ATC's comments would 
still not meet the ""opinion versus fact"" requirements set out in American Council of Certified Podiatric Physicians and Surgeons. 
Assuming that ATC's statements were literally false (thereby avoiding the requirement of alleging that it was a statement that 
""actually or tends to deceive a substantial portion of the intended audience""), the alleged comments were still unconfirmable 
opinions that did not constitute ""false or misleading statements of fact."" Am. Council, supra, 185 F.3d at 613-15. "
767,20," Plaintiffs  [**69] cite a case from 1834 to support the proposition that false accusations of patent infringement are libelous. 
Watson v. Trask, 6 Ohio 531 (1834). I acknowledge that defendants' statement that they would succeed on the merits is similar to an accusation of infringement. In 
my view, current jurisprudence distinguishing fact from opinion trumps the argument that all statements alleging patent 
infringement are libelous per se. In the proper situation, a factual statement that one party is infringing a patent could be libelous. 
A statement reflecting one's opinion on the issue (not to mention a statement reflecting one's opinion on the strength of a case 
deciding the issue) is not such a situation."
767,21," Plaintiffs assert that ATC's statement that it would prevail on its patent infringement claim was verifiably false because the 
patents were invalid. Even if the patents were invalid, however, this allegation does not change ATC's statement that it would 
prevail from being unverifiable (nor does it alter  [**71] the context in which listener's perceived ATC's statement). Furthermore, 
ATC's certain knowledge that it had fraudulently obtained the patents and that it could not prevail would not change the 
comments themselves from being statements of opinion rather than fact. "

778,2," In support of their Amended Motion for Class Certification, the IP Plaintiffs submitted an opening Memorandum of Law, a Reply 
Memorandum of Law and a Surrebuttal Memorandum of Law, as well as numerous exhibits, including expert reports regarding 
class certification issues and damages. Similarly, in opposition to the Motion, Defendants submitted a Response Brief, a Sur-
Reply Brief, and a letter Rebuttal Brief, also accompanied by voluminous exhibits and an expert report. "
779,3," In their opening Brief in support of their Motion  [*11] for Class Certification, the IP Plaintiffs initially proposed the following 
class representatives: Vista Healthplan, Inc. (""Vista""); Teamsters Health & Welfare Fund of Philadelphia & Vicinity (""THWF""); the 
Health & Welfare Fund and the Retiree Health & Welfare Fund of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association of the City of New 
York (collectively, the ""PBA Funds""); Mechanical Contractors-UA Local 119 Welfare Fund, IBEW-NECA Local 505 Health & 
Welfare Fund, and A.F. of L. -- AGC Building Trades Welfare Plan (collectively, the ""Alabama Plans""); Great Lakes Health Plan, 
Inc. (""GLHP""); Correction Officers Benevolent Association Security Benefits Fund-Active and Retirees (""COBA Fund-Active"" and 
""COBA Fund-Retirees,"" respectively); Stanley Nemser (""Nemser""); Sheila Harris (""Harris""); Elaine Palmer (""Palmer""); Burton 
Lavin (""Lavin""); Betty Saad (""Saad"") and James T. Morgan (""Morgan""). See Pl. Br. at 18. Defendants filed a series of motions 
seeking summary judgment against the Alabama Plans, TWHF, the PBA Funds, GLHP, the COBA Fund-Active, Nemser, Harris, 
Palmer, Lavin and Saad. In their Reply Brief in support of the Motion for Class Certification (""Pl. Reply""), the IP Plaintiffs 
withdrew the  [*12] COBA Fund-Active, COBA Fund-Retirees, Palmer, Saad, Lavin and Nemser as putative class 
representatives. See Pl. Reply at 46. The IP Plaintiffs subsequently consented to the entry of summary judgment against the 
COBA Fund-Active. See Oct. 18, 2007 Tr. at 4-6. In my Reports deciding Defendants' remaining motions, I granted summary 
judgment as to the claims of THWF, Harris, Palmer, Lavin and two of the Alabama Plans. See Alabama Plans Report (Doc. 
530); Harris/Palmer Report (Doc. 615); Lavin Report (Doc. 617) and THWF Report (Doc. 619). As a result of the withdrawal of 
certain named Plaintiffs and the summary judgment rulings, the current putative class representatives are Vista, the PBA Funds, 
GLHP, the remaining Alabama Plan (A.F. of L.-A.G.C. Building Trades Welfare Plan) and Morgan."
779,4," Count I of the Second Amended Complaint asserts a claim for declaratory and injunctive relief under Section 16 of the Clayton 
Act, 15 U.S.C. § 26, for Defendants' alleged violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1 and 2. On 
February 6, 2008, Defendants submitted a Motion for Summary Judgment with respect to the IP Plaintiffs' federal antitrust claim 
alleged in Count I. On February  [*13] 11, 2008, counsel for the IP Plaintiffs advised me that, without admission or concession of 
any factual allegations or legal arguments in Defendants' papers, the IP Plaintiffs do not contest Defendants' Motion or the 
dismissal of the federal antitrust claim. Accordingly, on February 12, 2008, I entered an order granting Defendants' Motion and 
dismissing with prejudice the IP Plaintiffs' federal antitrust claim. Count III of the Second Amended Complaint alleges unlawful monopolization under certain state antitrust and/or consumer 
protection statutes (the ""Walker Process/sham litigation claims""). On March 1, 2007, I issued a Report and Recommendation 
recommending dismissal of the Walker Process/sham litigation claims alleged in Count III. The IP Plaintiffs' objections to the 
March 1, 2007 Report have been briefed and argued before the District Court."
779,5," Under United States Supreme Court precedent, indirect purchasers generally do not have standing to seek damages under 
federal antitrust law. See Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977). See also Hanover 
Shoe v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 392 U.S. 481, 88 S. Ct. 2224, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1231 (1968). Accordingly, the IP Plaintiffs' 
antitrust claims for damages are brought under the laws of states that have enacted an Illinois Brick repealer statute or that have 
judicially recognized an exception to the federal law bar on indirect purchaser claims for damages. Although Plaintiffs' claims for 
damages arise solely under state law, the essential elements of a private antitrust action are generally the same under federal 
and state law. See In re Terazosin Hydrochloride Antitrust Litig., 220 F.R.D. 672, 695 (S.D. Fla. 2004); In re Relafen Antitrust 
Litig., 221 F.R.D. 260, 275 (D. Mass. 2004). See also, e.g., Reading Int'l, Inc. v. Oaktree Capital Mgmt. LLC, 317 F. Supp. 2d 
301, (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (""Under New York law, the state and federal  [*16] antitrust statutes 'require identical basic elements of 
proof.'"") (quoting Altman v. Bayer Corp., 125 F. Supp. 2d 666, 672 (S.D.N.Y. 2000)); Bellinder v. Microsoft Corp., 2001 WL 
1397995, *4 (Kan. Dist. Ct. Sept. 7, 2001) (describing elements of claim under Kansas Restraint of Trade Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. § 
50-101, et seq.). "
781,6," As a practical matter, the commonality requirement ""rarely has resulted in the denial of class certification in an antitrust action."" 
Antitrust Law Developments 3d at  [*22] 314. In fact, some courts have opined that because most class actions are brought 
pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3), that subsection's predominance requirement (discussed infra) has rendered the commonality 
requirement of Rule 23(a)(2) almost superfluous. See e.g., Martino v. McDonald's Sys., 81 F.R.D. 81, 85 (N.D. Ill. 1979). "
782,7," See Nov. 16, 2007 Tr. at 8. "
783,8," At the oral argument on the IP Plaintiffs' Motion, Defendants' counsel stated that Defendants contested typicality as to the 
consumer class representatives, but not as to the TPP class representatives. See Nov. 16, 2007 Tr. at 8. However, at the 
argument and in their Letter Brief submitted December 7, 2007 (""Def. Ltr. Br.""), Defendants' only references to typicality assert 
that class-wide injury cannot be established through common proof where class representatives, identified by the Plaintiffs as 
""typical,"" are shown to have no injury. See Nov. 16, 2007 Tr. at 49-50, 55-56; Def. Ltr. Br. at 3-4. This argument relates not to 
typicality, but to the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3). "
784,9," Former class representative Stanley Nemser died in late April 2007, and his Estate was substituted as Party Plaintiff. See Sept. 
19, 2007 Order granting Consent Motion for Substitution of the Estate of Stanley Nemser as Party Plaintiff (Doc. 529). "
785,10," The Advisory Committee notes to Rule 23 state that the requirements of Rule 23(b)(3) were adopted to ""encompass[] those 
cases in which a class action would achieve economies of time, effort, and expense, and promote uniformity of decision as to 
persons similarly situated, without sacrificing procedural fairness or bringing about other undesirable results."" See Fed. R. Civ. 
P. 23, Advisory Committee Notes, 1966 Amendment, Subdivision (b)(3). See also Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 
591, 615, 117 S. Ct. 2231, 138 L. Ed. 2d 689 (1997). Providing examples of the application of Rule 23(b)(3), the Advisory 
Committee explains that a case involving fraud ""perpetrated on numerous persons by the use of similar representations"" could 
be suitable for certification, even if damages had to be determined separately. Id. In contrast, a ""mass accident"" involving 
significant individual questions of liability, defenses and damages ordinarily would be unsuitable for class treatment. Id. With 
respect to proposed antitrust class actions, the Advisory  [*34] Committee Notes state that ""[p]rivate damage claims by 
numerous individuals arising out of concerted antitrust violations may or may not involve predominating common questions."" Id."
785,11," HN18[
] The fact of injury element is referred to interchangeably as ""injury-in-fact,"" ""impact"" and ""fact of damage."" See, e.g., 
ABA Section of Antitrust Law, Antitrust Law Developments (5th ed. 2002) at 839; Rossi v. Standard Roofing, Inc., 156 F.3d 
452, 483 (3d Cir. 1998). Fact of injury is often analyzed in conjunction with the related concept of ""antitrust injury."" Fact of injury 
focuses on whether the plaintiff sustained injury to his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws. 
See Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 489, 97 S. Ct. 690, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977). The concept of 
""antitrust  [*36] injury"" focuses on whether the ""injury [is] of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and . . . flows 
from that which makes the defendants' acts unlawful. The injury should reflect the anticompetitive effect either of the violation or 
of the anticompetitive acts made possible by the violation."" Id. See also City of Pittsburgh v. West Penn Power Co., 147 F.3d 
256 (3d Cir. 1998) (discussing ""antitrust standing"" and ""antitrust injury"")."
785,12," I note that HN19[
] once a plaintiff has established the fact of injury element of an antitrust claim, the standard of proof 
required with respect to the amount of damages is less stringent and is satisfied by a reasonable approximation. See, e.g., J. 
Truett Payne, 451 U.S. 557, 566-67, 101 S. Ct. 1923, 68 L. Ed. 2d 442 (1981). The relatively relaxed standard of proof for the 
amount of damages recognizes the principle that ""it does not 'come with very good grace' for the wrongdoer to insist upon 
specific proof of the injury which it has itself inflicted."" Id. at 567 (quoting Hetzel v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 169 U.S. 26, 18 S. 
Ct. 255, 42 L. Ed. 648 (1898). "
786,13," I recognize that in addition to their state law antitrust claims, the IP Plaintiffs  [*39] also assert claims under certain state 
consumer protection statutes and under the common law unjust enrichment doctrine. The IP Plaintiffs have not disputed that 
injury is also an element of their state law consumer protection claims. See Pl. Br. at 25. See also Harris/Palmer Report at 14 n. 
14 and 30; Nemser Report at 9; and PBA/GLHP Report at 11 n. 15 and 16 (discussing injury requirement under specific state 
consumer protection statutes). Furthermore, in general, a plaintiff alleging unjust enrichment must show: (1) at plaintiff's 
expense; (2) defendant received a benefit; (3) under circumstances that would make it unjust for defendant to retain [the] benefit 
without paying for it. In re K-Dur Antitrust Litig., 338 F. Supp. 2d 517, 544 (D.N.J. 2004) (citing Restatement of Restitution § 1 
(1937)). See also Pl. Br. at 33 (listing prima facie elements of unjust enrichment). Although ""injury"" is not among the above-
referenced elements of an unjust enrichment claim, the IP Plaintiffs must establish that it would be inequitable for Defendants to 
retain the benefit of their purchases of K-Dur, e.g., that Defendants' alleged unlawful conduct precluded Plaintiffs from 
purchasing a generic  [*40] version of the drug and/or caused them to pay higher prices for branded K-Dur. Even assuming that 
the elements of Plaintiffs unjust enrichment claims can be established by common proof, without individual evidence of harm or 
inequity to particular Plaintiffs, common issues would not predominate where the injury element of Plaintiffs' antitrust and 
consumer protection claims is incapable of being established through class-wide proof. "
788,14," See French Suppl. Aff. at P 7 (describing typical three-tier prescription drug formulary prescribing $ 5.00 co-pay for generic 
drug, $ 10.00 co-pay for preferred branded drug and $ 15.00 co-pay for non-preferred branded drug."
788,15," An example of such a situation is explained by Dr. French. In the pre-generic entry period between May and August 2001, 
THWF paid an average of $ 7.98 for a 30-pill prescription of K-Dur, but it  [*47] paid a higher average price of $ 10.98 per 30-pill 
prescription in the post-generic entry period from September to December 2001. See French Suppl. Aff. at P 11. The reason the 
THWF paid a higher price for generic potassium chloride than for branded K-Dur was because after generic entry, THWF 
received co-pays from its members that were $ 6 lower than the co-pays it had received for branded K-Dur. Id. at P 11. Thus, the 
$ 3.09 savings the THWF received on generic K-Dur was more than offset by the $ 6 co-pay reduction, and the THWF actually 
paid more for generic K-Dur than for the branded drug. Id. Dr. French opines that THWF was nonetheless injured because, 
under the joint purchaser theory, ""the change in the total retail price is the proper gauge of the antitrust injury caused by 
defendants' conduct."
788,16," Defendants also argue that individualized inquiries are necessary to determine whether the injury of the TPP Plaintiffs was 
negated by rebates paid by Schering to pharmacy benefit management (""PBM"") companies that were passed on to the TPPs. 
See Def. Br. at 21. As with co-pays, Defendants argue that the size of rebates -- which Dr. Rubinfeld opines ranged from 0% to 
50% of the price of  [*48] branded K-Dur -- could also be large enough, particularly when combined with co-pay decreases, to 
offset any savings to a TPP resulting from the lower price of generic K-Dur. In this regard, I note that Dr. French acknowledges 
that ""rebates could, in theory, be large enough to eliminate injury in a transaction."" See French Suppl. Aff. at 53. However, 
assuming, arguendo, that common proof could establish that all TPP Plaintiffs paid less for generic K-Dur than for the branded 
drug, common proof may also exist to show that rebate amounts were not high enough to negate injury. See French Suppl. Aff. 
at P 53-66 (comparing percentage difference between retail prices of branded and generic K-Dur with percentage rebates based 
on Schering rebate data). "
789,17," See In re Warfarin Sodium Antitrust Litig., 212 F.R.D. 231, 259 (D.Del. 2003) (""Inclusion of the TPPs apparently facilitated 
settlement, because defendant had an interest in binding all parties who had potential claims against it. If TPP's…had been 
excluded from the settlement, this would have left defendant vulnerable to future lawsuits or class actions"")."

(""Plaintiffs argue that [the Warfarin] case is directly on point. It is not. In determining that fixed co-payment consumers should be

have already file claims' and 'would further delay distribution to the rest of the class and result in additional administrative 
costs'"")."

790,23," See Wood v. Abbott Labs., Inc., 1997 WL 824019, at *3 (Mich. Cir. Ct. Sept. 11, 1997) (noting that ""[t]he Goda decision…was 
predicated upon a unique District of Columbia statute which permits the fact of injury and the amount of damages to be proven 
on a class-wide basis without requiring proof of such matters by each individual member of the class""); Kerr v. Abbott Labs., Inc., 
1997 WL 314419, at *3 (Minn. Dist. Ct. Feb. 19, 1997) (noting that the language of D.C. Code § 28-4508 ""significantly 
distinguishes District of Columbia Antitrust Law from Minnesota Antitrust Law"" and that ""Plaintiffs counsel acknowledged that 
the language of § 28-4508 was 'unique' in the breadth of its class action provision as compared to other Illinois Brick repealer 
statutes throughout the country""). "
791,24," Plaintiffs proposed alternative class includes: (1) Any uninsured consumer that purchased K-Dur and switched to an AB-rated 
generic version during the class period; (2) Any uninsured consumer that purchased K-Dur after the start of the Class period but 
stopped taking the drug prior to actual generic entry in September 2001; (3) Any insured consumer who, during the class period 
prior to generic entry, purchased K-Dur using a higher-tiered co-pay than they would have paid if the AB-rated generic had been 
available; (4) Any insured consumer who, during the class period prior to generic entry, purchased K-Dur under a health plan 
that had a percentage based co-pay; (5) Any third-party payor that during the class period prior to generic entry, paid some or all 
of the prescription price  [*59] for K-Dur where the plan had only flat co-pays (or no co-pay at all) for plan participants; and (6) 
Any third-party payor that, during the class period prior to generic entry, paid some or all of the prescription price for K-Dur 
where the plan had a percentage based co-pay. See Pl. Reply at 18."
791,25," Because I have decided that individual issues of impact predominate and preclude certification, I need not decide whether 
variations in state law applicable to the class would defeat predominance or render the case unmanageable. However, I note 
that my rulings on Defendants' summary judgment motions revealed some differences in state  [*60] law that could otherwise 
bear on the requirements of Rule 23(b)(3). See Harris/Palmer Report (concluding that as an indirect purchaser, Harris' could not 
pursue claims sounding in antitrust under Louisiana antitrust statute, consumer protection act or under the doctrine of unjust 
enrichment); THWF Report (concluding that THWF could not bring antitrust, consumer protection or unjust enrichment claims 
under the laws of Pennsylvania, New Jersey or Delaware); Nemser Report (Nemser's claim failed to allege deceptive conduct 
required under New York's Consumer Protection from Deceptive Acts and Practices Act, N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law. §§ 349, et seq.). 
Moreover, although IP Plaintiffs suggested that I could certify an exemplar class of states to reduce any problems of 
manageability, they did not propose any potential exemplar states nor identify potential class representatives for an exemplar 
class. See Pl. Br. at 38-39; Def. Br at 45. "
799,1," The district court observed that ""it is reasonable to infer that the proposed federal injunctive class numbers in the millions""; the

801,4," Plaintiffs distinguish between list and effective dealer invoice prices. The list dealer invoice price is determined annually for the 
national market by the manufacturers. Effective dealer invoice prices reflect dealer- or region-specific incentives provided by the 
manufacturers. Similarly, the effective MSRP takes into account direct manufacturer-to-consumer incentives, such as cash back 
offers. This distinction is crucial to plaintiffs' theory of antitrust impact."

802,7," Plaintiffs object that defendants cannot raise a standing challenge to the Rule 23(b)(2) class on appeal because  [**13] they 
failed to present the argument to the district court. For their part, defendants claim they previously raised the issue in oral 
argument. Either way, HN2[

parties argue, see Pagan v. Calderon, 448 F.3d 16, 26 (1st Cir. 2006), and must remain so throughout the entire life cycle of a 
case. See generally II Areeda & Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P 335b, at 289 (2d ed. 2000). The issue has not been waived."
802,8," The court found the injunctive relief class met the requirements of Rule 23(a) -- numerosity, commonality, typicality, and 
adequacy -- then turned to the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2). Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a); Motor Vehicles IV, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
10240, 2006 WL 623591, at *2-6. HN4[
] Rule 23(b)(2) allows for class actions when ""the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is 
appropriate respecting the class as a whole."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). The court held that the defendants fall within the language 
of Rule 23(b)(2) because they had acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class. Motor Vehicles IV, 2006 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10240, 2006 WL 623591, at *7. The court further held that the proposed class satisfied the rule's requirement 
that injunctive relief be ""appropriate . . . with respect to the class as a whole.""  2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10240, [WL] at *7-10. "
803,9," The district court noted the defendants' position that because the complained-of export restrictions operated to restrict the flow 
of American cars into Canada as well as vice versa, consumers buying cars in the United States during periods when the value 
of the Canadian dollar and the prices of Canadian cars rose were actually protected from higher domestic prices. Plaintiffs' 
expert conceded that the defendants' two-way restrictions could protect American consumers in such a scenario. Motor Vehicles 
IV, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10240, 2006 WL 623591, at *3 n.23. "
804,10," We take judicial notice of these undisputed facts. Between 1950 and the present, it has generally cost between $ 0.96 and $ 
1.40 Canadian dollar (""CAD"") to purchase one United States dollar (""USD""). During that period, the exchange rate has risen 
significantly above $ 1.40 CAD to $ 1.00 USD only once for any length of time. This occurred between the years 1998 and 2003, 
when the rate ranged between $ 1.40 and $ 1.61 CAD to $ 1.00 USD. 5E Historical Statistics of the United States 5-572 to 5-574

alleged arbitrage opportunities occurred."
804,11," The exchange rate on April 30, 2003 was $ 1.43 CAD to $ 1.00 USD, and as of publication of this opinion, the exchange rate 
has not once returned to that level. Instead, the relative value of the domestic dollar has been in more or less steady decline. On 
September 28, 2007, the value of the Canadian dollar surpassed that of the United States dollar. As of February 1, 2008, the 
exchange rate was $ 0.90 CAD to $ 1.00 USD. Federal Reserve Statistical Release: Historical Rates for Canada,

805,12," Although the defendants challenge plaintiffs' standing to maintain the injunctive class, neither side addressed to this court any 
of the jurisdictional issues that might arise in the event that we vacated the federal injunctive class. We do not purport to raise an 
exhaustive checklist of questions to address on remand, but advert to some salient issues."
805,13," The Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (""CAFA""), Pub. L. 109-2, 119 Stat. at 4 (amending 28 U.S.C. § 1332) was enacted 
after the complaints in this action were filed. The existence of diversity jurisdiction must therefore, under the express terms of the 
CAFA, be determined  [**27] under the pre-CAFA diversity statute. See CAFA § 9, 119 Stat. 14 (""[CAFA] shall apply to any civil 
action commenced on or after the date of enactment of this Act."")."
805,14," In its September 7, 2004 order addressing supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claims, the district court in addition 
asserted pendent personal jurisdiction over certain Canadian defendants based on the personal jurisdiction created by the 
federal antitrust claim. Motor Vehicles II, 335 F. Supp. 2d at 128; see also In re New Motor Vehicles Canadian Export Antitrust 
Litig., 307 F. Supp. 2d 145, 147-48 (D. Me. 2004) (finding personal jurisdiction over certain Canadian defendants). To the extent 
that the district court relied on the existence of the federal claim, personal jurisdiction may yet be an issue on remand. "
807,15," The defendants did not move to dismiss all the state claims, and the plaintiffs consented to the dismissal of some of the state 
claims. Motor Vehicles III, 350 F. Supp. 2d at 168, 175."
807,16," The  [**33] district court had requested, in a March 15, 2005 order, that each side designate three exemplar states. The 
plaintiffs selected Maine, Kansas, and Vermont, and the defendants chose California, New Mexico, and Tennessee."
807,17," The Kansas class was not certified because plaintiffs conceded that the class representative had not in fact been injured by 
the alleged conspiracy and thus lacked standing. Motor Vehicles V, 235 F.R.D. at 131."
807,18," HN13[
] To establish an antitrust claim, plaintiffs typically must prove (1) a violation of the antitrust laws, (2) an injury they 
suffered as a result of that violation, and (3) an estimated measure of damages. Sullivan v. Nat'l Football League, 34 F.3d 1091, 
1103 (1st Cir. 1994). For a class action to be appropriate, ""plaintiffs need to demonstrate that common issues prevail as to [both] 
the existence of a conspiracy and the fact of injury."" Blades v. Monsanto Co., 400 F.3d 562, 566 (8th Cir. 2005). If these two "
808,," elements are established by common proof, the measure of damages can sometimes be left to individual proof, as we discuss 
further below. The element of injury in the antitrust context is often referred to as ""impact"" or ""fact of damage."" Alabama v. Blue Bird Body Co., 
573 F.2d 309, 317 & n.18 (5th Cir. 1978). It is the causal link between the antitrust violation and the damages sought by 
plaintiffs. Sullivan, 34 F.3d at 1103. It thus requires both injury-in-fact and a showing that the injury is the result of the antitrust 
activity. Cordes & Co. Fin. Servs., Inc. v. A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc., 502 F.3d 91, 106 (2d Cir. 2007)."
808,19," The court reiterated  [**36] in its March 21, 2007 order that it would not ""make a final determination of the existence of antitrust 
impact at the certification stage."" Motor Vehicles VI, 241 F.R.D. at 80 (emphasis added). ""Whether an illegal agreement halting 
Canadian imports (or removing their threat) produced antitrust causation or retail purchase price impact remains to be proven at 
trial or demonstrated at summary judgment."" Id. at 82 n.5. "
809,20," Professor Kalt had described the contours of the gray market in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Professor Hall argued that the gray 
market in 2001 and 2002 would reflect the impact of the alleged horizontal conspiracy and that the relevant arbitrage 
opportunities were not present in 2000."
809,21," For example, Professor Hall cited a study showing that dealers tend to pass on to consumers at least some pricing incentives 
given by manufacturers. Motor Vehicles V, 235 F.R.D. at 137 (citing M. Busse et al., $ 1000 Cash Back: Asymmetric Information 
in Auto Manufacturer Promotions 45 (Nat'l Bureau of Econ. Res. Working Paper Series No. 10887, 2004)). "
810,22," The parties filed briefs on these issues of state substantive law before the March 21, 2007 order. The court found that the 
parties' briefing did not cause it to change its prior views."
810,23," Defendants say this is not an accurate representation of California law, but do not press the point on appeal."
810,24," Those issues were: (a) Was there a horizontal agreement to restrict supply? (b) Was it illegal under that particular state's laws? (c) . . . Did the illegal agreement have antitrust or consumer protection impact in that state as the plaintiffs propose to prove 
it? "
811,," (d) If so, is that impact sufficient to confer standing under the particular state's laws? (e) How long did the conspiracy and its impact last? Motor Vehicles V, 235 F.R.D. at 142 (footnote omitted)."
811,25," In a footnote, the district court explained that it believed it had complied with the First Circuit requirement that the district court 
""formulate some prediction as to how specific issues will play out,"" Mowbray, 208 F.3d at 298, that it conduct a ""rigorous 
analysis"" of the Rule 23 criteria, Smilow, 323 F.3d at 38, and that it test the disputed premises ""early on,"" Tardiff, 365 F.3d at 4. 
Motor Vehicle VI, 241 F.R.D. at 81 n.7. The court noted that PolyMedica did not mandate a particular level of fact-finding by the 
district judge at the certification stage. Id. "
813,26," Defendants attempt to answer this problem by saying these statements demonstrate that the district court failed to inquire 
adequately into the record; that answer is a mismatch with the problem presented of an incomplete record and of incomplete 
work by the plaintiffs' expert."
813,27," The 2003 amendments to Rule 23 deleted the provision allowing class certifications to be conditional. The advisory committee 
notes explain that ""[a] court that is not satisfied that the requirements of Rule 23 have been met should refuse certification until 
they have been met."" This does not prevent a judge from modifying its certification if it becomes clear, as the case develops, that 
the class action vehicle is in fact inappropriate. "
814,28," While these are both questions that are themselves susceptible to common proof (the potential size of the gray market and the 
distinction between the effects of horizontal and vertical restraints), they go to the viability of a novel theory upon which plaintiffs 
rely to establish an element of their claim through common means. In that sense, these factual questions are akin to the 
question of market efficiency in securities class actions employing  [**62] the fraud-on-the-market presumption of reliance. 
Cases like PolyMedica and Xcelera demonstrate that such factual bases of theories of common proof are appropriately, 
although preliminarily, tested at the class certification stage."
814,29," The district court noted that ""some states permit consumers to recover the full purchase price  [**63] once liability is proven,"" 
further simplifying the calculation of individual damages awards. Motor Vehicles V, 235 F.R.D. at 143 n.53. "
816,30," I agree that the case is properly remanded to the district court so that it can first establish whether there is jurisdiction under § 
1332 or § 1367. "
823,1," More accurately, MAN Roland asserts that Heidelberger's subsidiary, Heidelberg Web Systems, Inc. (""HWS"") engaged in sham 
litigation against MAN Roland, and that Heidelberger is liable to MAN Roland as HWS's alter ego. Because the court can resolve 
the underlying issues regarding the claim, the precise party against whom the claim is brought is of no moment. "
824,2," MAN Roland did move to reconsider the June 2, 2006, order, but its arguments were unrelated to the sham litigation claim. "
825,3," MAN Roland did not submit that summary judgment motion after the court had granted summary judgment to Heidelberger on 
the issues contained therein; the summary judgment motions were, for all practical purposes, simultaneous. Thus, filing that 
motion does not lend support to an argument that MAN Roland continued the litigation in bad faith."
825,4," In PPG Industries, Inc. v. Celanese Polymer Specialties Co., however, the trial court declined to grant section 285 attorneys' 
fees to a prevailing antitrust counterclaimant in a patent case, reasoning that 15 U.S.C. § 15 allows attorneys' fees for prevailing 
antitrust claimants. 658 F. Supp. 555, 559 (W.D. Ky. 1987), rev'd on other grounds, 840 F.2d 1565 (Fed. Cir. 1988)). "
839,1," They are Southwestern Holdings, LLC (""Southwestern"") and Bellwether, LLC (""Bellwether""). "
840,2," Of those plaintiffs alleged to be Alabama residents several are alleged to have been investors in Bellwether: Mary A.

and Cindy Cox Wise."
841,18," The following Washington plaintiffs are identified as Bellwether investors: Eldon Hunt; Eldon Hunt Conservator; and Robert 
Pound. "
842,19," Due to the procedural posture of this case, the Court bases this summary of the factual predicate for the lawsuit on the 
allegations of the Plaintiffs' Amended and Superceding Complaint (Doc. # 7). "
843,20, These misrepresentations are specified in paragraph 228 of the Plaintiffs' Amended and Superceding Complaint (Doc. # 7). 
844,21," Sales continued until June 1999, when Marketer/Investor Plaintiff Steve Nichols ceased the Bellwether offering in response to 
his receipt of a subpoena from the Government in the related SEC litigation. "
845,22, These misrepresentations are specified in paragraph 238 of the Plaintiffs' Amended and Superceding Complaint (Doc. # 7). 
848,23," ""Equitable tolling"" refers to the tolling of the running of the statute of limitations where, for example, the claimant has filed a 
defective pleading during the statutory period, Burnett v. New York Cent. R.R. Co., 380 U.S. 424, 434-36, 85 S. Ct. 1050, 13 L. 
Ed. 2d 941 (1965), or where the plaintiff has been induced or tricked by his adversary's misconduct into allowing the filing 
deadline to pass. Glus v. Brooklyn E. Dist. Terminal, 359 U.S. 231, 79 S. Ct. 760, 3 L. Ed. 2d 770 (1959)."
848,24," On October 18, 1999, the SEC filed an action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, styled as 
SEC v. Homa, et al., Civil Action Number 99-CV-6895 (""the SEC action""). The complaint in the SEC action sought an injunction 
against Gause, Homa and others, including several of the Plaintiffs in this action (e.g. Bellwether, Southwestern, several of the 
Marketer/Investor Plaintiffs) and sought to recover investments from C4T and others involved in the C4T scheme. 
 [*39] Eventually a Receiver was appointed to pursue the Investor Plaintiffs' claims. All Investor Plaintiffs are members of the 
Receiver's class of plaintiffs. Matsukage and the Dill firm received a copy of the complaint in the SEC action from Nichols, a 
Marketer/Investor Plaintiff in this action and a defendant in the SEC action. Neither Matsukage, nor the Dill firm were named as 
defendants in the SEC action. Several of the plaintiffs to this action, were named as defendants to the SEC action."
848,25," On February 8, 2000, a class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, 
Miami Division, styled as Robert S. Wolff, et al., v. Cash 4 Titles, et al., Civil Action Number 00-052 (""the Wolff action""). This 
complaint asserted a class action on behalf of a nationwide class of plaintiffs who made investments in C4T and was a class 
against a variety of named defendants. Neither Matsukage, nor the Dill firm were named defendants in the Wolff action. The 
Wolff Complaint purported to include claims against various ""Jane and John Does."" The Court notes that the Federal Rules of 
Civil Procedure do not authorize the use of fictitious defendants in pleading  [*40] practice. See, e.g., Fed. R. Civ. P. 10(a); New 
v. Sports & Recreation, Inc., 114 F.3d 1092, 1094 n.1 (11th Cir. 1997); Harris v. Palm Harbor Homes, Inc., 198 F. Supp.2d 1303, 
1304 n.6(M.D. Ala. 2002); Edwards v. Alabama Dep't of Corr., 81 F. Supp. 2d 1242, 1257 (M.D. Ala. 2000). The Court also finds 
it noteworthy to mention that the Wolff action was a plaintiffs' class action and did not attempt to identify a class of defendants. 
The Wolff action only asserted RICO claims. It did not include claims under § 10(b)."
848,26," On April 27, 2001, the Investor Plaintiffs filed independent claims by filing Champion v. Dill Dill, et al., Civil Action Number CV-
01-430 in the Circuit Court for Shelby County, Alabama. On September 12, 2001, they commenced Austin v. Dill Dill, et al., Civil "
849,," Action Number 01-971 in the Circuit Court for Shelby County, Alabama. The claims in these two state court actions were 
essentially the same as the claims in this case except that they omitted the RICO and § 10(b) claims and were only brought 
pursuant to state law. On February 21, 2003, the Alabama Supreme Court granted Petitions for Writ of Mandamus filed by 
Matsukage and the Dill firm and ordered the dismissal of  [*41] those defendants for lack of personal jurisdiction. "
850,27," Tello v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 410 F.3d 1275, 1288 (11th Cir. 2005) (Tello I) was an interlocutory appeal from a district 
court's ruling that the SOA did revive stale claims. See Tello I, 410 F.3d at 1277-78. Tello I reversed the district court's decision 
and remanded the case back for additional fact-finding to determine when the plaintiff had inquiry notice of his claims against 
Dean Witter. See id. at 1294. The Circuit made it clear that they were not ruling on the retroactivity of the SOA: We recognize that other circuits have decided that § 1658(b) cannot be applied retroactively to revive securities fraud 
cases, when the claims were time-barred under the former statute of limitations. On the undeveloped record in this case, 
however, it is premature for us to make that legal determination. See id. at 1294 n.19 (emphasis added and internal citations omitted). After  [*48] the district court conducted additional fact-
finding, the case went back to the Circuit in Tello v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 494 F.3d 956, 974 n. 17 (11th Cir. 2007) (Tello 
II). In that opinion, the Circuit held that the plaintiff had inquiry notice in September 1998, which meant that his claims were time-
barred under both the old 1-year/3-year statute of limitations, and the SOA's 2-year/5-year statute of limitations. See Tello II, 494 
F.3d at 975. The Circuit noted that ""[b]ecause Tello and the class are time-barred under both the former statute of limitations and 
the SOA statute of limitations, the question of whether the SOA statute of limitations revives securities-fraud actions that were 
time-barred under the former statute of limitations is not presented in this case."" Id. (emphasis added). Therefore, based on this 
Court's reading of these decisions, the issue of the retroactivity of the SOA's statute of limitations provision has not been decided 
in this circuit. "
852,28," Plaintiffs sole remaining predicate act plead, obstructing justice, is insufficient to alone support the RICO claims. "
856,1," The original complaint also alleged federal jurisdiction based on the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-2, 119 
Stat. 4. Doc. 2, at 2:5-8. The new law provides for federal jurisdiction over class actions when the aggregate sum in controversy 
is over  [**6] $ 5 million and there is diversity between at least one plaintiff and one defendant. Congress also directed federal 
courts to decline jurisdiction when more than 2/3 of the plaintiffs are citizens of the forum state and to consider the interests of 
justice in deciding whether to exercise jurisdiction when more than 1/3 of the plaintiffs are members of the forum state. 28 U.S.C. 
§ 1332(d)(2)-(4). In the operative Complaint, Plaintiffs no longer assert federal jurisdiction on this basis. Defendants Stevco and FAL argue Plaintiffs also rely on 28 U.S.C. §2201 (declaratory judgment) as a basis for federal 
jurisdiction. Doc. 74, Stevco Brief, at 24:14-16. In response, Plaintiffs clarify that declaratory judgment is not an independent 
basis for federal jurisdiction. Doc. 97, Plaintiffs' Opposition, at 76:7-11. "
860,2," The court notes that Juarez has only been cited once by another court; the Seventh Circuit referred to it for the proposition that 
""Courts have consistently certified class actions in FLCRA cases, and there is no indication in any of these cases that Congress 
meant to prohibit class actions under FLCRA."" De La Fuente v. Stokely-Van Camp, Inc., 713 F.2d 225, 231 (7th Cir. 1983). "
861,," [**25] The broad language proclaiming indifference to the identity of the violated rights' owners in a standing analysis has not 
been cited. "
868,3," The text of the FLCRA states ""the Secretary may refuse to issue, and may suspend, revoke or refuse to renew a certificate of 
registration to any farm labor contractor if  [**55] he finds that such…(3) has failed, without justification, to perform agreements 
entered into or arrangements with farm operators; (4) has failed, without justification, to comply with the terms of any working 
arrangements he has made with migrant workers."" Farm Labor Contractor Registration Act of 1963, Pub. L. No. 88-582, 78 Stat. 
920. "
871,1," On March 19, 2008, Defendant filed a Supplemental Corporate Disclosure Statement, which indicated that ""Koninklijke Philips 
Electronics NV . . . has recently acquired all of the stock in Respironics, Inc."" (ECF No. 105.) "
872,2," The court's previous Order contains a more detailed discussion of the facts. (Order, ECF No. 80, at 1-3.)"
872,3," In its October 23, 2006 Order, the court allowed the parties to engage in additional limited discovery regarding the restraint of 
trade claims. (Order, ECF No. 80, at 29-30.) "
874,4," Both parties appear to use the terms ""DMEs"" and ""outlets"" interchangeably. "
875,5," Plaintiff also alleges that, pursuant to the agreements, Respironics agreed to sell products to sleep labs at predatorily low 
prices. However, the court has previously found that Respironics did not engage in predatory pricing. (Order, ECF No. 80, at 16-
18.) "
876,6," Plaintiff also argues that giving away free masks may violate that Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b, and 
that if it does, this provides additional evidence that the  [*16] activity constitutes an antitrust conspiracy. In support of this 
proposition, Plaintiff cites Transnor (Bermuda), Ltd. v. BP North Am. Petroleum, 738 F. Supp. 1497, 1498-1499 (S.D.N.Y. 1990), 
which held that evidence that a defendant's activity violated a non-antitrust law was relevant to whether it violated antitrust 
law. As Plaintiff has failed to show that giving away free masks actually violates the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, Plaintiff's 
argument is not well-taken. "
879,7," Defendant argues that Plaintiff's restraint of trade claims are based on an incorrect premise because physicians write out 
prescriptions, not sleep labs, as Plaintiff's Complaint contends. However, the above-quoted statement from Respironics' 
corporate materials and similar statements by Respironics' witnesses refer either to sleep labs, or doctors at sleep labs, 
prescribing  [*29] masks. Therefore, the court will disregard this argument by Defendant. "
892,1," The Twenty-first Amendment provides in full: ""Section 1. The eighteenth article of amendment to the Constitution of the United 
States is hereby repealed. Section 2. The transportation or importation into any State, Territory, or possession of the United 
States for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors, in violation of the laws thereof, is hereby prohibited. Section 3. This 
article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by conventions in the several 
States, as provided in the Constitution, within seven years from the date of the submission hereof to the States by the 
Congress."" U.S. CONST. amend. XXI."
892,2," The Eighteenth Amendment provided: ""Section 1. After one year from the ratification of this article the manufacture, sale, or 
transportation of intoxicating liquors within, the importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof from the United States and all 
territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof for beverage purposes is hereby prohibited. Section 2. The Congress and the several 
States shall have concurrent power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation. Section 3. This article  [**5] shall be 
inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of the several States, as 
provided in the Constitution, within seven years from the date of the submission hereof to the States by the Congress."" U.S. 
CONST. amend. XVIII (repealed 1933)."
892,3," As the district court explained, a ""three-tier system consists of the following levels: manufacturer, distributor, and retailer. Under 
a three-tier system, manufacturers sell products to distributors, who in turn sell the products to retailers."" Costco Wholesale 
Corp. v. Hoen, No. C04-360P, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27141, 2006 WL 1075218, *3 (W.D. Wash. Apr. 21, 2006). 
 [**6] Washington's ""three-tier"" system is no longer a perfect system of tiers because it allows direct sales to be made to retailers 
by both in-state and out-of-state manufacturers of beer and wine. See infra n.5."
892,4, Hoen remains a member of the LCB. Lorraine Lee now serves as LCB Chairman and Ruthann Kurose is the other member. 
893,5," Costco's complaint also initially challenged Washington's policy of allowing only in-state beer and wine producers to sell their 
products directly to retailers. In its December 21, 2005 Order, the district court granted partial summary judgment to Costco, 
ruling that Washington's policy violated the Commerce Clause. Subsequent to that ruling, the Washington Legislature enacted 
legislation extending the direct sales privilege to out-of-state producers as well. The Commerce Clause challenge is not before 
us and we thus express no views  [**9] on the district court's resolution of that matter. "
894,6," The district court granted WBWWA's motion for leave to intervene in this litigation on May 21, 2004. The court concluded that 
the ""Association may intervene as a matter of right under Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a) because its members have a protectable interest 
in this litigation that will be impaired or impeded if not allowed to intervene, and the government Defendants may not adequately 
represent the Association's interests."" "
895,7," In common usage, ethanol is referred to simply as alcohol."
895,8," The district court subsequently agreed to stay its judgment until May 1, 2007 in order to give the State Legislature ""an 
opportunity to take action in response to the Court's ruling."" Costco v. Hoen, No. C04-360P, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 65774, 2006 
WL 2645183 (W.D. Wash. Sept. 14, 2006). After we heard oral argument, we ordered that the district court's stay remain in 
effect ""until further order of this court or until issuance of the mandate."" "
898,9," Prior to his entering active judicial service, our colleague on the D.C. Circuit, Judge Merrick Garland,  [**29] expressed the 
same idea in an article discussing the Supreme Court's state-action antitrust jurisprudence. He wrote: ""The post-Parker cases 
constitute the Court's efforts to thread this needle -- an effort to protect true state regulation, even if anticompetitive, but to bar 
mere state 'authorization' of private anticompetitive conduct."" Garland, 96 YALE L.J. at 500-01. "
899,10," We view the ban on retailer sales to other retailers as a fundamental component of the State's ""unquestionably legitimate"" 
three-tier distribution system. Granholm v. Heald, 544 U.S. 460, 489, 125 S. Ct. 1885, 161 L. Ed. 2d 796 (2005) (internal 
citations omitted). "
900,11," We also believe that the central warehousing ban is akin to a non-price vertical restraint that would be evaluated under the 
Rule of Reason. A central warehousing system can provide numerous efficiencies for a large chain: ""They pay less for the 
products than they would if the supplier made delivery to individual stores. Also, they can consolidate deliveries from the 
warehouse to individual stores. Thus, their savings due to buying in large lots and arranging for central  [**35] delivery are 
greater than their added delivery costs."" First Beverages, Inc. v. Royal Crown Cola Co., 612 F.2d 1164, 1167 (9th Cir. 1980). 
The central warehousing ban effectively mandates where a retailer may store its products; this restraint most resembles a 
vertical non-price restraint that would be examined under the Rule of Reason. See Continental T.V., 433 U.S. at 51 n.8."
900,12," Further, contrary to Costco's argument, the warehousing ban is not akin to an output restraint because, although it lessens the 
amount a particular retailer can buy at any one time, it should not decrease total supply in the end market. "
901,13," The ""delivered pricing"" restraint was not challenged on appeal and therefore was not addressed by the Miller court. 813 F.2d 
at 1348 n.3."
901,14," It is worth pointing out that our opinion in Miller was withdrawn after the Supreme Court granted certiorari in 324 Liquor. After 
324 Liquor was decided, we re-filed the original opinion, noting that ""324 Liquor Corp.  [**40] confirms the reasoning and 
conclusions set forth in the opinion that was withdrawn."" 813 F.2d at 1345. "
902,15," Judge Friendly's antitrust analysis strangely failed to account for the New York requirement that posted prices be adhered to 
by wholesalers. As Judge Winter pointedly observed in dissent, ""the challenged legislation not only mandates the exchange of 
price information but also requires adherence to publicly announced prices until thirty days after notice is given of a new price. A 
requirement of adherence to announced prices has been uniformly held illegal without regard to its reasonableness."" Battipaglia, 
745 F.2d at 179  [**42] (Winter, J., dissenting) (citing and quoting Sugar Inst. v. United States, 297 U.S. 553, 601, 56 S. Ct. 629, 
80 L. Ed. 859 (1936) (""steps . . . to secure adherence, without deviation, to prices and terms . . . announced"" are illegal))."
902,16," Indeed, it appears that Judge Winter's view in Battipaglia has prevailed in the Second Circuit. See Freedom Holdings, Inc. v. 
Spitzer, 357 F.3d 205, 223-24 n.17 (2d Cir. 2004) (noting that the ""agreement"" question was reserved in Battipaglia and 
concluding that ""since our decision in Battipaglia, the Supreme Court has made it clear that an actual 'contract, combination or 
conspiracy' need not be shown for a state statute to be preempted by the Sherman Act"") (citing 324 Liquor, 479 U.S. at 345- 46 
n.8). "
903,17," We do not reach this conclusion lightly, for we share to some degree the concerns expressed in TFWS by our former 
colleague on the Fourth Circuit, Judge Michael Luttig. See 242 F.3d at 213-15. In a concurring opinion, Judge Luttig agreed that 
Maryland's post-and-hold system and volume discount ban were hybrid restraints of trade under relevant Supreme Court 
precedent, in particular 324 Liquor. He worried, however, that the logic of 324 Liquor ""could result in significant areas of 
unilateral state action being regarded as hybrid state/private action, and therefore potentially in violation of the Sherman Act 
when it is not, and in derogation of what should be obvious state plenary authority."" 242 F.3d at 215 (Luttig, J., concurring). 
Although we share this concern about broadening the reach of the antitrust laws to preempt state law, we also recognize that the 
Supreme Court has expressed strong disdain for state laws which leave unsupervised regulatory  [**48] power in the hands of 
non-political, nonresponsive private actors. "
904,18," Although LCB places much emphasis on the fact that the prices are effective once announced, as opposed to the scheme in 
Miller which gave a ""sneak peek"" of prices, such a distinction will not save the scheme from per se condemnation. That firms are 
not empowered immediately  [**50] to alter their prices to meet a lower price or to adjust to a higher price does not alter the 
conclusion that in the long run, prices for beer and wine are more likely to be uniform and stable because of tacit collusion. "
905,19," We agree with the district court that HN22[
] these restraints should be considered to be of the per se variety. An agreement 
""to pay or charge rigid, uniform prices would be an illegal agreement under the Sherman Act."" Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 
at 222; see also Catalano, 446 U.S. at 647-48 (a restraint ""pegging, or stabilizing the price is illegal per se""). A delivered pricing 
arrangement that removes transportation costs from competitive bidding is also per se unlawful. See, e.g., Boise Cascade Corp. 
v. FTC, 637 F.2d 573, 575 (9th Cir. 1980)  [**54] (delivered pricing agreements are per se violations because ""[w]hen combined 
with the standardization of delivery methods, service extras, and discounts, any delivered pricing system can become a potent 
tool for assuring that competitors are able to match prices and avoid the rigors of price competition""). The bans on credit sales 
and bans on discounts are also per se violations. Catalano, 446 U.S. at 648 (""An agreement to terminate the practice of giving 
credit is . . . tantamount to an agreement to eliminate discounts, and thus falls squarely within the traditional per se rule against 
price fixing.""); see also AREEDA & HOVENKAMP, P 2022a (explaining that credit terms are an integral element of overall price). 
Finally, the minimum mark-up provision is a per se violation because if horizontal competitors were to agree amongst 
themselves to mark up their products at least at a level above acquisition price, it would constitute classic price fixing. Horizontal 
price maintenance, as opposed to vertical price maintenance, is subject to per se condemnation. See Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 
310 U.S. at 218. "
906,20," It is true that the ban on providing volume discounts or transportation allowances will make a firm's prices more transparent to 
its competitors; but the delegation of discretion to private actors, the hallmark of a hybrid restraint, is simply missing from these 
restraints. The nature and extent of the competitive injury to retailers is largely complete upon enactment of the bans. "
907,21," Washington's severability analysis is thus very similar to that which has been applied to acts of Congress. See Buckley v. 
Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 108, 96 S. Ct. 612, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659 (1976)  [**62] (per curiam) (""Unless it is evident that the Legislature 
would not have enacted those provisions which are within its power, independently of that which is not, the invalid part may be 
dropped if what is left is fully operative as a law."") (internal quotations and citations omitted)."
907,22," As mentioned previously, we view the Midcal active supervision prong in this case as largely collapsing into Fisher's 
hybrid/unilateral inquiry. See supra at II.B. We emphasize, however, that viewing the post-and-hold scheme through the active 
supervision prism does not help Washington. As we explained in reviewing Oregon's similar post-and-hold scheme in Miller, 
""Oregon 'neither establishes prices nor reviews the reasonableness of the price schedules . . . [nor does it] monitor market 
conditions or engage in any 'pointed reexamination' of the program."" Oregon mandates the posting of prices to be charged by 
each wholesaler, but does not in any way review the reasonableness of the prices set. While the commission 'may reject 
 [**65] any price posting which is in violation of any of its rules,' Rule 210(1)(b), the effect of that rule is simply to effectuate the 
price posting and the prohibitions on quantity discounts and transportation allowances. It does not provide for government 
establishment or review of the prices themselves . . . Oregon merely authorizes and enforces the disputed pricing practices."" 813 
F.2d at 1351 (quoting Miller v. Or. Liquor Control Comm'n, 688 F.2d 1222, 1225-26 (9th Cir. 1982)). We see no discernable 
difference in Washington: the State neither sets the prices (outside the minimum mark-up), nor reviews those prices for "
908,," reasonableness; the State does not engage in any pointed reexamination of the program; nor does the fact that the LCB can 
reject price postings in any way satisfy Midcal's requirement. Thus, even assuming that the hybrid and active supervision 
inquiries do not completely overlap in this case, our decision in Miller compels us to conclude that Washington cannot meet the 
active supervision prong of Midcal."
908,23," The State forcefully argues that it also has a compelling interest in the promotion of orderly markets. It cites the Supreme 
Court's statement in North Dakota v. United States, 495 U.S. 423, 432, 110 S. Ct. 1986, 109 L. Ed. 2d 420 (1990), that the two 
North Dakota regulations at issue, which were passed ""[i]n the interest of promoting temperance, ensuring orderly market 
conditions, and raising revenue,"" fell within the State's core interests under the Twenty-first Amendment. It is not precisely clear, 
however, what ""orderly markets"" means in this context. See Bainbridge v. Turner, 311 F.3d 1104, 1115 (11th Cir. 2002) (""As for 
'ensuring orderly markets,' we are not sure what that phrase means . . . .""). Indeed, at trial, there were different, competing 
definitions set forth by the State. See Findings of Fact, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27141, [WL]  at *7, P 25 (""LCB member Vera Ing 
defined 'orderly distribution' as the 'three-tier system' and stated that orderly distribution 'would  [**69] be the ability to supervise"" 
and 'clearly articulated procedures.' Dr. Kenneth Casavant, an economist, defined 'orderly marketing' as 'asking the market to 
have the prices reflect the cost of production' and to have the market avoid 'gluts and scarcities.'""). Given the difficulty of defining 
this concept, we discern no clear error in the district court's conclusion that the restraints were minimally effective in promoting 
this interest. "
909,24," Initially, LCB defendants, WBWWA and numerous amici contend that to require any proof of effectiveness gives insufficient 
deference to the States' policy prerogatives. See, e.g., Brief of the National Beer Wholesalers Association at 12-14. We reject 
this argument because the Supreme Court, at least implicitly, has already rejected it. In both Midcal and 324 Liquor, the two 
cases involving state restraints which were not directed at discrimination against out-of-state interests, the Supreme Court has 
required some degree of fit between the regulation and the goal. See, e.g., Midcal, 445 U.S. at 112-14 (requiring the state to 
substantiate its concerns to prevail against the undoubted federal interest in a competitive economy); 324 Liquor, 479 U.S. at 
350 (following Midcal and requiring state to substantiate its interest). In addition, in Miller, we emphasized that the district court 
on remand would need to consider ""the extent to which, in reality, the state rule serves its avowed purposes."" 813 F.2d at 1352 
n.7.  [**71] Thus, the district court was correct in requiring the State of Washington to ""substantiate"" its interests by showing 
some degree of fit between its interests and its regulatory scheme."
909,25," Although we ultimately agree with the district court's conclusion, we are troubled by the district court's apparent application of 
a ""narrow tailoring"" test. See Findings of Fact,  2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27141, [WL] at *7, P 22 (noting that ""[i]f the State desires 
to promote temperance by artificially increasing beer and wine prices, the State could readily achieve that goal in a manner that 
does not run afoul of the Sherman Act. Most obviously, the State could adopt higher excise taxes on beer and wine.""); see also 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27141, [WL] at *9, P 34. We do not agree that the existence of an alternative form of regulation necessarily means that the State's interest will yield to the 
federal interest in promoting competition. It is true that a ""narrow tailoring"" test may have some applicability in the case of blatant 
discrimination between in and out-of-state liquor interests, but it has never been applied in the context of balancing the states' 
core concerns with  [**73] the principles of the Commerce Clause. See Granholm, 544 U.S. at 489 (""State policies are protected 
under the Twenty-first Amendment when they treat liquor produced out of state the same as its domestic equivalent. The instant 
cases, in contrast, involve straightforward attempts to discriminate in favor of local producers.""); id. (""We still must consider 
whether either state regime 'advances a legitimate local purpose that cannot be adequately served by reasonable 
nondiscriminatory alternatives.' "") (internal citations omitted). The district court's suggestion that the State should serve its interest in some other way disparages the policy choices that 
Section 2 of the Twenty-first Amendment commits to the states. There doubtless are varying reasons why the State has not "
910,," opted for an excise tax, and as a federal court, we are not authorized to look behind the regulation to decide whether such policy 
reasons are sufficiently compelling. "

proposed to pay Sanders $ 900,000 (representing one-third of the $ 2.7 million purchase price) and a sum payable from the "

927,12," The Court will refer to the Hearing transcripts for May 21, 2007, May 22, 2007 and May 23, 2007 as ""Hearing Tr. I""; ""Hearing

927,13," The Court notes that NES submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law (""NES Findings/Conclusions""), as did 
Fulson (""Fulson Findings/Conclusions""). These submissions contain very few citations to the record and, frequently, are 
unintelligible. Because Fulson is appearing pro se (although the Fulson Findings/Conclusions seem to be identical to those 
proposed by NES), he has been accorded considerable leeway. But the Court found the NES Findings/Conclusions, which were 
prepared by counsel, to be of little or no assistance because they are replete with errors in punctuation and grammar, contain 
few citations to the record and make numerous misstatements of law. The following are but a few examples:  [**32] (1) NES 
states that ""[t]he trustee did not file a Chapter 11 re-organization plan., as required by FRBP 9019."" NES Findings/Conclusions 
at 3, P 11 (The Court notes that Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9019 governs the approval of compromises, not the filing of a plan.); (2) ""The 
Federal. Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b), made applicable to bankruptcy cases by Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7009, has 
been violated by the trustee because he committed perjury when he stated in this Court that he was not after Freddie L. Fulson's 
personal assets despite the fact that he included Freddie L. Fulson in his personal capacity in the adversarial consolidation 
complaint[.]"" NES Findings/Conclusions at 3, P 14 (Rule 9(b), governing the pleading of fraud, is inapplicable here.); (3) ""There 
was no Creditors Committee established, as required, according to Chapter 11 Rules."" NES Findings/Conclusions at 3, P 16 (As 
discussed supra at Part III.B., a committee was appointed in this case by the United States Trustee. There are no ""Chapter 11 
Rules,"" but rather the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure. Nor is it clear to which rule counsel is referring.); (4) ""The Federal 
Bankruptcy Rule § 1121 requires the plan  [**33] be devised …."" NES Findings/Conclusions at 5, P 2 (There is no ""Federal 
Bankruptcy Rule § 1121."" Rather § 1121 is a provision contained in the Bankruptcy Code.); and (5) ""Rule of Bankruptcy 
Procedure 7009 provides: Fraud, Mistake, and Condition of the Mind. The trustee has filed an substantive consolidation 
complaint that contains fraudulent and mistaken allegations."" NES Findings/Conclusions at 6, P 5 (emphasis added) (Rule 9(b), 
made applicable by Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7009, actually states that ""[i]n alleging fraud or mistake, a party must state with 
particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake. Malice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person's mind 
may be alleged generally."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). Thus, it is unclear what counsel is referring to in this proposed conclusion of 
law.). "
928,14," The following provisions were highlighted by the Trustee: (1) ""Section 2.2 of the [APA] which deals with the assumption of

with the Court."" Id. at 15:21-16:2; (2) ""[O]n the issue of the Trustee's independent judgment, Section 3.02 of the [APA] is a 
carefully worded paragraph . . . .The first sentence obligates the Trustee to continue prosecution of the substantive consolidation

creditors."" Id. at 16:8-15 (emphasis added); and (3) ""[T]here is a following provision which essentially says that if Columbia 
wants to cease funding that litigation or comes to the conclusion that it's not in the best interest of the estate or chooses not to 
proceed with those funding responsibilities, if the Trustee wants to proceed the Trustee can still do that."" Id. at 16:15-20."
928,15," Rule 1.8(f) provides as follows: A lawyer shall not accept compensation  [**38] for representing a client from someone other than the client unless divisions 
(f)(1) to (3) and, if applicable, division (f)(4) apply: (1) the client gives informed consent; (2) there is no interference with the lawyer's independence of professional judgment or with the client-lawyer 
relationship; (3) information relating to representation of a client is protected as required by Rule 1.6; (4) if the lawyer is compensated by an insurer to represent an insured, the lawyer delivers a copy of the following 
Statement of Insured Client's Rights to the client in person at the first meeting or by mail within ten days after the 
lawyer receives notice of retention by the insurer . . . . "
929,, Ohio Rule of Professional Conduct 1.8(f)(1)-(4).
929,16," The Court also agreed with the Trustee's contention that NGP's arguments were untimely, particularly when the Trustee's 
name was listed on the Trustee's Preliminary Proposed Witness and Exhibit List for Contested Sale Hearing (Doc. 340) filed on 
February 6, 2007, id. at 26:9-11, noting that ""when Mr. McClatchey made the opening statement in this proceeding … it was 
apparent that he was going to also be participating as an attorney."" Id. at 26:11-14. The Court, however, recognized that the 
rules with respect to whether an attorney may testify on behalf of a client are not waivable  [**40] and, in support of that 
conclusion, referred the parties to Dynasty Apparel Indus., Inc. v. Rentz, 206 F.R.D. 596, 600 (S.D. Ohio 2001) (""Courts have 
held that the witness/advocate rule embodied in [former] DR 5-101(B) is mandatory and cannot be waived, because it is 
intended, in part, to protect the institutional concerns of the bar and the legal system.""). "
930,17," At the  [**43] close of the evidence, NES withdrew Exhibit X. Hearing Tr. III 98:16."
930,18," Comment 1 to Rule 3.4 states that ""[t]he procedure of the adversary system contemplates that the evidence in a case is to be 
marshaled competitively by the contending parties. Fair competition in the adversary system is secured by prohibitions against 
destruction or concealment of evidence, improperly influencing witnesses, obstructive tactics in discovery procedure, and 
 [**44] the like."" (emphasis added). "
932,19," On June 19, 2007, Fulson filed a motion for reconsideration of the Court's exclusion of Coleman's testimony (""Reconsideration 
Motion"") (Doc. 383). In the Reconsideration Motion, Fulson stated that Coleman's testimony ""would bring to light facts to the 
Nicole state court litigation and the adversary consolidation complaint of the trustee."" Reconsideration Motion at 2. The Court 
has addressed its concerns regarding Coleman's testimony as it related to the State Court litigation. The Court notes that the 
""adversary consolidation complaint""--which presumably refers to the Substantive Consolidation Action--was not before the Court 
at the Hearing. The Court entered an order denying the Reconsideration Motion on August 7, 2007 (Doc. 404)."
932,20," According to the Damages Report, there were 138 natural gas wells in total that were owned by NGP--70 wells were 
unmetered and 68 were metered wells, Id. at 3."
932,21," The Court will refer to the five-year period of time from 2001 to 2005 during which NES allegedly incurred the damages as the 
""Damages Period."""
932,22," The Damages Report ""computes the net profits before taxes by means of a cash flow calculation that recognizes revenues, 
variable costs and fixed costs [and]… reduces the net profit of $ 32,463,996.44 to account for certain debts and offsets."" Id."
932,23," This amount was adjusted downward by $ 329,341.60 to account for debt NES incurred that was not attributed to TCO's 
alleged under-crediting. Id. "
935,24," The State Court also stated that ""the pending  [**61] motion for partial summary judgment deals with liability for failure to 
install meters and not with the responsibility for the payment of the same."" Id. at 15. "
936,25," This conclusion also finds support in the definition  [**65] of property of the estate under § 541, which provides that the estate 
is comprised of, among other things, ""all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the 
case."" 11 U.S.C. § 541(a)(1). Numerous courts have interpreted the § 541 definition to include causes of action. See, e.g., Cable 
v. Ivy Tech State Coll., 200 F.3d 467, 472-73 (7th Cir. 1999) (""The phrase 'legal or equitable interests … in property' includes 
choses in action and other legal claims that could be prosecuted for the benefit of the estate.""); Bauer v. Commerce Union Bank, 
859 F.2d 438, 441 (6th Cir. 1988) (""[I]t is well established that the interests of the debtor in property include causes of action."" 
(internal quotation marks omitted)); Lahijani, 325 B.R. at 287 (""Causes of action owned by the trustee are intangible items of 
property of the estate that may be sold. These include causes of action owned by the debtor as of the filing of the case.""); Darrah 
v. Franklin Credit (In re Darrah), 337 B.R. 313, 316 (Bankr. N.D. Ohio 2005) (""Choses-in-action . . . are included within this broad 
definition [of estate property].""); Buckeye Union Ins. Co. v. Four Star Constr. Co. (In re Four Star Constr. Co.), 151 B.R. 817, 819 
(Bankr. N.D. Ohio 1993)  [**66] (""Among these legal interests [in § 541] are the debtor's choses in action and claims against 
third parties in existence as of the petition filing date.""); In re Carson, 82 B.R. 847, 851 (Bankr. S.D. Ohio 1987) (""It is well-
established that the broad scope of § 541 encompasses causes of action existing at the time of the commencement of the 
bankruptcy action.""). "
937,26," As noted above, however, the Columbia Entities'  [**71] claims are not subordinated to the extent of any additional distribution 
by the Trustee from assets he may recover in the Substantive Consolidation Action. Id. at 48:22-49:6. "
938,27," The Court recognizes that a settlement in the range of $ 8 million to $ 10 million is significantly higher than the proposed sale 
amount. Yet the Court may approve the terms of the sale so long as they are in the best interest of the estate and the sale 
amount does not fall below the range of reasonableness. See, e.g., Dow Corning, 198 B.R. at 222 (when reviewing a settlement, 
""the obligation of the court is to canvass the issues and see whether the settlement falls below the lowest point  [**73] in the 
range of reasonableness"" (internal quotation marks omitted))."
938,28," Donchess is an attorney with the firm of Donchess & Notinger in Nashua, New Hampshire. He is a member of the Committee, 
representing Steve Notinger, Chapter 7 Trustee for the AGF Direct Gas estate. Hearing Tr. II 332:7-19. Donchess has 
experience in representing a Chapter 7 trustee in bankruptcy-related matters and also has general litigation experience, Id. at 
333:1-13. "
939,29," The Trustee's framework also garnered support from Donchess ""because anyone who thought the claims were worth more 
than the settlement including Mr. Fulson or any of the other Nicole entities could have bid more or could have submitted a . . . 
[s]ubstitute asset purchase agreement for an amount greater than was being paid by Columbia …."" Hearing Tr. II 350:1-8. "
940,30," The Trustee conducted the negotiations instead of Sanders, his special counsel. The Trustee believed it was the best 
allocation of resources for Sanders to focus only on the litigation, and that ultimately his ""fiduciary duty required that at the end of 
the day [he] would have to make the decision on any settlement."" Hearing Tr. I 100:23--101:3. As the case developed, the "
941,," Trustee also discovered that Sanders was involved in other litigation on behalf of Fulson and the Nicole-affiliated entities, which 
gave him ""some concern about how effective [Sanders] would be in  [**84] conducting negotiations with TCO …."" Id. 101:4-7."
941,31," During cross-examination of the Trustee, NES attempted to characterize TCO's decision to file the involuntary petition as an 
indication that TCO did not settle the claims asserted in the State Court case in good faith. See id. at 168:20-170:7. The Court 
rejects this argument because NES subsequently consented to the jurisdiction of this Court by filing a voluntary petition for relief 
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and also consented to the appointment of a Chapter 11 trustee. The Court concludes 
that the decision made by TCO or the LDCs to commence the involuntary case has little or no bearing on the issue of whether 
TCO entered into the APA at arm's length or in good faith. The Court also notes that three other creditors moved to join in the 
involuntary petition under § 303(c)."
941,32," At an initial meeting, TCO expressed its view to the Trustee ""that the case had nothing more than nuisance value."" Hearing Tr. 
I 102:14-15. TCO did not make a settlement offer at the initial meeting, and the Trustee advised TCO that he ""wasn't interested 
in discussing a settlement in that [nuisance-value] range."" Id. at 102:18-21. Subsequent to that meeting, TCO offered to settle 
the case for $ 350,000, which the Trustee rejected. He again advised TCO that he was not interested in discussing 
 [**86] settlement for a nuisance value. Id. at 103:5-13. The Trustee also did not consider an offer by TCO in the $ 750,000 to $ 
800,000 range. Id. at 104:16-25. Instead, he ""told [Farmer] that settlement level was inadequate and I thought he should review 
the matter with his management and contact me further."" Id. at 105:2-4. "
944,33," Despite the ruling in the State Court Decision that TCO was required under the Tariff to install and maintain meters on the 
unmetered wells, see supra Part V.C., Wright testified that TCO ""[d]oesn't believe that under the [T]ariff that it had an obligation 
to install meters."" Hearing Tr. II 414:20-21. TCO's belief as to this point of contention, however, would have no import at the trial 
court stage of the litigation because the State Court had already determined as a matter of law that TCO had breached its 
contract by failing to install and maintain meters on the unmetered wells. At trial in the State Court, TCO would have proffered 
documentary evidence and testimony regarding the parties' course of dealing in order to preserve its appeal rights. Id. at 415:1-
11. And if TCO were unsuccessful at trial, it intended to appeal the State Court Decision. Id. at 418:13-16. But for purposes of its 
analysis, the Court has assumed that the State Court Decision would have foreclosed TCO from presenting evidence of the 
 [**98] parties' course of dealing in order to attempt to convince jurors that it had no contractual obligation to install meters. "
945,34," Riley is the Louis F. Tanner  [**102] Distinguished Professor of Public Accounting at West Virginia University. He also 
practices in the area of forensic accounting. Hearing Tr. II 461:24-462:5."
945,35," Riley provided his testimony with the aid of a Power Point presentation. At the close of all the evidence, the Court asked NES's 
counsel if there would be an objection to the Court obtaining a copy of the Power Point slides ""not in so far as the admission of 
those slides as an exhibit, but simply [as a summary] to aid the Court in reviewing [Riley's] testimony . . . ."" Hearing. Tr. III 
134:13-16. Counsel for NES objected on the basis that he did not have an opportunity to analyze the Power Point presentation 
prior to the Hearing. The Court therefore did not have the benefit of Riley's Power Point slides to aid it in the post-hearing review 
of his testimony. "
947,36," According to Riley, the acronym RAG is used interchangeably with Pennsylvania Land Holdings and its acronym, PLHC. See 
id. at 262:13-15. For consistency, the Court will use the acronym RAG throughout the remainder of this opinion. "
948,37, It is unclear when Smoot's employment with NEM ended. 
949,38," Throughout this opinion the Court references  [**113] certain statements that were made about Fulson and how he operated 
NES and its related entities. The Court does not make a finding as to the truth or falsity of any particular allegation, but 
concludes that the cumulative effect of this testimony regarding Fulson's business practices certainly was a legitimate factor for 
the Trustee and the Committee to take into account in assessing whether Fulson would have been an effective and credible 
witness in the State Court case. "
952,39," Sanders interposed an objection to this question, but did not state the basis for his objection. Trustee Ex. 25, Bodamer Dep. 
148:19. "
955,40," Both sides expect that NES also would appeal if it did not succeed at trial. See Hearing Tr. I 73:6-7 (The Trustee stated ""in 
[his] evaluation, that either side would appeal the trial results.""); Hearing Tr. II 436:20-22 (According to Wright, TCO 
""[a]bsolutely"" expects an appeal if NES were to lose at trial.). "
956,41," Although the Committee was aware that it could employ counsel to represent its interests, according to the Trustee, the 
Committee members realized there was no money in the estate to support attorney's fees and ""were comfortable with . . . [and] 
had experience with matters of this type and they didn't feel that counsel would add anything to the process."" Hearing Tr. I 
80:11-14. Thus, the Committee made the decision to act without separate counsel. "
957,42," The concerns raised by Donchess were based on a judgment-debtor examination of Fulson and NES that was conducted on 
behalf of the AGF Direct Gas estate. Id. at 361:3-23."
957,43," The Committee made the decision to forego questioning Sanders about his views of the State Court case. According to 
Donchess, the Committee ""knew that Mr. Sanders was optimistic about the case and believed in the case. So we didn't really 
feel we needed to . . . get his input because we thought we knew what he would say[.]"" Id. at 366:5-8. McMichael viewed 
Sanders's ""opinion to be pretty biased …. That he would be inclined to fight. I don't think settlement was  [**146] in his plans."" 
McMichael Dep. 136:12-16. "
960,44," This objection was also raised in the NEM Special Objection, which the Court previously overruled. See supra Part IV.B.4."
960,45," Equity holders have standing to oppose a proposed settlement only if they show ""a real possibility that a successful objection 
to the motion to compromise would have resulted in a surplus."" Yates v. Forker (In re Patriot Co.), 303 B.R. 811,815 (B.A.P. 8th "
961,," Cir. 2004). Because NES's probability of success at trial and, hence, the probability  [**157] of a surplus for equity holders, was 
an issue to be determined at the Hearing, the Court permitted Fulson and the NES affiliates to appear and be heard. But, as 
detailed in this memorandum opinion, the Court finds that the likelihood of a recovery by the Debtor in an amount that would 
produce a surplus for equity holders is exceedingly remote. "
965,1," ""'Airport concession fee' means a charge collected by a rental company from a renter that is the renter's proportionate share of 
the amount paid by the rental company to the owner or operator of an airport for the right or privilege of conducting a vehicle 
rental business on the airport's premises."" Cal. Civ. Code § 1936.01(a)(1). "
974,1," Plaintiff subsequently filed its Motion for Preliminary Injunction on March 3, 2008. Because this Order grants Defendants' 
Motion to Dismiss, the court does not address Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction."
974,2," Defendants urge the court to apply the standard outlined in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 
1960, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) -- that a plaintiff must allege facts that actively and plausibly suggest the conclusion that the 
defendant violated the law -- for each element of Plaintiff's antitrust claims. Bell Atlantic addressed the pleading requirements for 
a violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act, and held ""that stating such a claim requires a complaint with enough factual matter (taken 
as true) to suggest that an agreement was made."" Bell Atlantic, 127 S. Ct. at 1965. Neither Bell Atlantic nor the Ninth Circuit 
since Bell Atlantic has specifically addressed  [*7] whether this changes the pleading requirements for other types of claims. See "
975,," Canyon County v. Syngenta Seeds, Inc., 519 F.3d 969, 2008 WL746986, at *3, n.8 (9th Cir. Mar. 21, 2008) (""Because the 
County cannot meet the more liberal 'any set of facts' standard, we need not decide whether the Supreme Court's recent 
'retirement' of the 'no set of facts' standard, Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1968-69, 167 L. Ed. 2d 
929 (2007), and its adoption of a new 'plausibility' standard, see id. at 1965-67, applies to RICO complaints.""); Kendall v. Visa 
U.S.A., Inc., 518 F.3d 1042, 2008 WL 613924, at *3, n.5 (9th Cir. Mar. 7, 2008) (applying Bell Atlantic to a violation of the 
Sherman Act, § 1, and stating that ""at least for the purposes of adequate pleading in antitrust cases, the [Supreme] Court 
specifically abrogated the usual 'notice pleading' rule, found in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) and Conley v. Gibson, 
355 U.S. 41, 47, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957), which requires only 'a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the 
pleader is entitled to relief,' to 'give the defendant fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests'""). 
However, Newcal Indus., Inc. v. Ikon Office Solution, 513 F.3d 1038 (9th Cir. 2008),  [*8] contemplated that at least for the 
""relevant market"" element, the pleading requirements remain unchanged. See Newcal Indus., Inc., 513 F.3d at 1044-45 (""There 
is no requirement that [the elements of relevant market and that the defendant has power within that market] of the antitrust 
claim be pled with specificity.""). Because the court finds that Plaintiff lacks antitrust standing, the court need not resolve this 
issue at this time."
975,3," Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2, provides that: Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other persons, to 
monopolize any part of the trade or commerce  [*9] . . . shall be deemed guilty of a felony. . . ."""
975,4," Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 18, provides that: No person engaged in commerce or in any activity affecting commerce shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any 
part of the stock or other share capital and no person subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission shall 
acquire the whole or any part of the assets of another person engaged also in commerce or in any activity affecting 
commerce, where . . . the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a 
monopoly. "
976,5," Section 16 of the Clayton Act also grants private parties the right to seek injunctive relief for threatened loss due to violation of 
the antitrust laws. See 15 U.S.C. § 26. Antitrust injury is a prerequisite for seeking private equitable relief as well. See Cargill, 
Inc. v. Montfort of Colo., Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 112, 107 S. Ct. 484, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427 (1986) (""It would be anomalous, we think, to 
read the Clayton Act to authorize a private plaintiff to secure an injunction against a threatened injury for which he would not be 
entitled to compensation if the injury actually occurred."")."
976,6," The Ninth Circuit has stated that no single factor for antitrust standing is decisive, and the court must balance these factors. 
See R.C. Dick Geothermal Corp. v. Thermogenics, Inc., 890 F.2d 139, 146 (9th Cir. 1989) (en banc). While this suggests that a 
claimant could proceed even where it does not have an antitrust injury, such interpretation would conflict with the Supreme 
Court's statement that a showing of antitrust injury is necessary. See Cargill, 479 U.S. at 110 n.5. Indeed, antitrust injury appears 
to be a necessary element to antitrust standing. See, e.g., Glen Holly Entm't, Inc. v. Tektronix Inc., 343 F.3d 1000, 1007 (9th Cir. 
2003) (""Only those who meet the requirements for 'antitrust standing' may pursue a claim under the Clayton Act; and to acquire 
'antitrust standing,' a plaintiff must adequately allege and eventually prove 'antitrust  [*13] injury.'"" (citation and quotation signals 
omitted)); Pool Water Prods. v. Olin Corp., 258 F.3d 1024, 1036 (9th Cir. 2001) (affirming district court summary judgment 
determination that Plaintiff failed to establish antitrust injury); Lucas Auto. Eng'g, Inc. v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., 140 F.3d 
1228, 1233 (9th Cir. 1998) (finding that because plaintiff cannot demonstrate any antitrust injury, it lacked standing to sue for 
damages). "
977,7," In its Bench Memorandum, Plaintiff argues that the Ninth Circuit gave effect to Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 
429 U.S. 477, 97 S. Ct. 690, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977), by adopting ""the 'target area' approach in determining whether a plaintiff's 
injury occurred 'by reason of' the alleged  [*15] violation."" See Pl.'s Bench Memo 2-3 (quoting Parks v. Watson, 716 F.2d 646, 
658 (9th Cir. 1983). The court rejects this argument as contrary to law. In R.C. Dick Geothermal Corp., 890 F.2d at 146, the 
Ninth Circuit en banc recognized that the Supreme Court in Associated General Contractors of California, Inc. v. California State 
Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 537 n.33, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1983), ""explicitly rejected"" the ""target area"" 
approach."
977,8," The plaintiff in Lucas was not the target of a merger, but a competitor of the defendant. Lucas, a tire distributor, alleged that its 
competitor violated antitrust laws when it acquired the exclusive right to manufacture and distribute certain tires world-wide. The 
court found that its injury did not flow from the alleged illegal activity: As a competitor of [the defendant], [the plaintiff's] alleged injury is that it has been foreclosed from serving as a primary-line 
supplier of vintage tires. However, [the plaintiff] would have suffered the same injury had a small business acquired the 
exclusive right to manufacture and to distribute Firestone tires. Because it cannot demonstrate ""antitrust injury"" as defined 
in Brunswick, [the plaintiff] lacks competitor standing to sue [the defendant] for treble damages under § 4. Lucas Auto. Eng'g, Inc. v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., 140 F.3d 1228, 1233 (9th Cir. 1998). "
978,9," Plaintiff argues that the court should follow Consolidated Gold Fields PLC v. Minorco, S.A., 871 F.2d 252, 258 (2d Cir. 1989). In 
Consolidated Gold Fields, the Second Circuit found that a merger target may have standing to raise a  [*19] violation of § 1 of 
the Sherman Act. See Consol. Gold Fields PLC, 871 F.2d at 258 (holding that ""a member of a § 1 conspiracy has standing to 
challenge the restraint upon its freedom to compete, even though, in the long run, it may enjoy the benefits of the cartel""). The 
court disagrees with Consolidated Gold Fields. It appears that the Second Circuit may have confused injury-in-fact with antitrust 
injury in reaching its conclusion. See Anago, Inc. v. Tecnol Med. Prods., Inc., 976 F.2d 248, 250-51 (5th Cir. 1992). Further, 
Consolidated Gold Fields discussed only the fourth element of antitrust injury (that the injury be of the type the antitrust laws 
were intended to prevent) as opposed to the third element (that the injury flow from that which makes the conduct unlawful), 
which the court finds determinative for Defendants' Motion to Dismiss."
978,10," In Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Edelman, 666 F. Supp. 799, 805-06 (M.D.N.C. 1987), the court described that policy 
considerations may also support denying a target company standing: As Judge Friendly has noted, targets of tender offers routinely seek shelter under Section 7 of the Clayton Act. Accordingly, 
a court should not interfere with a tender offer unless the target company dispels the inference of disingenuousness by 
showing that the alleged antitrust violation would expose it to readily identifiable harm. [See Missouri Portland Cement Co. 
v. Cargill, Inc., 498 F.2d 851, 854 (2d Cir. 1974).] In addition, the courts should not allow the antitrust laws to become a 
weapon to protect particular competitors since, as the courts often state, the antitrust laws were enacted for ""the protection 
of competition, not competitors."" [Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 320, 82 S. Ct. 1502, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510 
(1962).] "
979,," See also Moore Corp. v. Wallace Computer Servs., Inc., 907 F. Supp. 1545, 1566 (D. Del. 1995) (explaining that ""disingenuous 
antitrust suits may be brought  [*22] by targets to thwart the loss of control to be suffered by management, as opposed to any 
motives relating to antitrust""). Although the court does not find this rationale particularly persuasive -- after all, most all litigants 
are self-interested -- it does suggest that courts should carefully consider antitrust injury where a plaintiff seeks to maintain its 
position in the market rather than foster healthy competition."
979,11," Defendants dispute whether Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged unlawful conduct. Because the court finds that Plaintiff has not 
alleged an antitrust injury, the court does not address this issue."
979,12," To the extent that Plaintiff attempts to tie its injury to the lessening of competition in the stevedoring industry, it is unclear how 
this industry would  [*24] be affected where Plaintiff is merely being replaced by Defendants such that the number of stevedoring 
companies does not change. To the extent that Defendants' acts lessen competition in the shipping industry, Plaintiff is not a shipper and therefore will not 
experience a lessening of competition in the shipping industry. Further, that Plaintiff does not compete in the shipping market 
would also prevent Plaintiff from proving the fifth element of antitrust injury that Plaintiff and Defendants compete in the same 
markets. See Glen Holly Entm't, Inc., 343 F.3d at 1008. While the Ninth Circuit has recognized that the ""market participant"" 
requirement may not be so limited, see Am. Ad Mgmt, Inc. v. Gen. Tel. Co. of Cal., 190 F.3d 1051, 1057-58 (9th Cir. 1999) 
(citing Areeda & Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law (1995 & 1998 Supp.)) (noting that ""market participants"" may include indirect 
purchasers, potential entrants, suppliers, licensors and landlords, and dealers), the court is unaware of any cases that would 
extend it to the relationship presented here. However, because Plaintiff has failed to allege that its harm flows from an 
anticompetitive aspect of Defendants' behavior, the court need not  [*25] address whether the fact that Plaintiff is not currently in 
the same markets as Defendants would preclude Plaintiff from proving this element."
979,13," Plaintiff argues that Brunswick and Lucas ""can not be construed to require the Court to find there is no 'antitrust injury' anytime 
the same result could have occurred through lawful means."" Pl.'s Bench Memo 10. The court does not cite these cases for such 
a broad proposition; rather, these cases, like this case, involve analysis of antitrust injury in the competitor context. For that 
reason, they are illustrative as further support for why Plaintiff lacks antitrust injury based on the facts alleged. "
980,14," This ruling does not affect the court's discretion to maintain jurisdiction over any state claims that Plaintiff may allege in a 
Second Amended Complaint. "
990,1," Effective June 1, 2007, E.D. Mich. L.R. 54.1.2 provides that a motion for attorney fees must be filed within 28 days after the 
entry of judgment, unless a post-judgment motion has been filed. "
993,1," Both Ferro and Cookson filed motions for leave to file additional briefs. (Doc. Nos. 66 & 67, respectively.) Both motions are 
GRANTED."
993,2," All references herein to the Complaint, unless otherwise noted, are to the Amended Complaint, filed June 15, 2007. (Doc. No. 
17.)"
993,3," The terms ""plastic additives"" and ""heat stabilizers"" apparently are used interchangeably by the parties, such that the ""heat 
stabilizer"" industry and the ""plastic additives"" industry are, for purposes of this action, identical. For purposes of clarity and 
consistency, the Court refers to the industry in question exclusively as the ""plastic  [**5] additives"" industry."
993,4," Three of these lawsuits currently are pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The 
fourth is pending in a California state court. "
994,5," Ferro has incurred in excess of $ 2,900,000 in legal fees and expenses related to the Antitrust Cases. (Bays Aff., PP 2-4.) 
Ferro paid $ 750,000 to settle the PolyOne Litigation, and $ 5,500,000 to settle the Direct Purchaser Litigation. (Niehaus Aff. P 9; 
Kaplan Aff .P 9.)"
994,6," The Complaint in the Direct Purchaser Litigation was filed on March 28, 2003."
994,7," In Ferro's letter to Cookson requesting defense and indemnification, Ferro refers to this as a ""claim"" (rather than an inquiry) by 
the Antitrust Plaintiffs. Having reviewed the underlying record from the Antitrust Cases, for the reasons explained herein, it is 
clear to the Court that the Antitrust Plaintiffs never asserted any claim based on allegations of a meeting between Jennings and 
Jain, but merely inquired as to whether such a meeting occurred."
994,8," Jain's assertion of the privilege was by no means limited to questions relating to a meeting with Jennings. The portion of his 
deposition placed on the record reflects that Jain invoked his Fifth Amendment rights with respect to nearly all questions asked 
of him. The extent to which this was reported to Cookson when the request for defense and indemnification was made is not 
clear."
994,9," Ferro noticed the deposition of Jennings in this action, but canceled it.  [**7] (Defs.' Mot. for Summ. J., Ex. 11.) "
996,10," Ferro states in its memorandum in support of its Motion for Partial Summary Judgment that there is no factual dispute that the 
complaints in the Antitrust Cases state claims that are within,  [**14] or arguably within, the purview of the obligation to defend [. 
. .]. (Pl.'s Mot. for Partial Summ. J. at 2.) This statement is completely unsupported by fact. Tellingly, nowhere in its brief does 
Ferro cite any portion of the any of the complaints in the Antitrust Cases. Instead, Ferro relies exclusively on snippets of the 
discovery record in those cases. As explained herein, the Court independently examined the complaints in the Antitrust Cases 
and finds that they did not, in fact, state claims covered, or arguably covered, by the defense provision of the APA. To the extent 
that Ferro relies on vague references in the complaints to ""unnamed coconspirators"" as including potential claims against 
Synpro and therefore rendering coverage arguable, that assertion is devoid of merit. Ferro admits that it did not learn that 
Synpro-related claims were involved until certain discovery took place in 2005. Of course, Ferro knew at the time the Antitrust 
Cases were filed that it had acquired Synpro, and that Synpro was engaged in that industry. Thus, Ferro cannot contend that it 
believed the references to ""unnamed coconspirators"" related to Synpro because there is no evidence that it had such  [**15] a 
belief. Moreover, the Antitrust Plaintiffs eventually received the benefits of discovery, and never ""named"" Synpro as one of the 
allegedly unnamed coconspirators. "
997,11," In a sale of corporate assets, the buyer corporation is not liable for the seller's tortious conduct unless one of four exceptions 
applies: (1) the buyer expressly or impliedly agrees to assume such liability; (2) the transaction amounts to a de facto 
consolidation or merger; (3) the buyer corporation is merely a continuation of the seller corporation; or (4) the transaction is 
entered into fraudulently for the purpose of escaping liability.  [**18] Flaugher, 30 Ohio St. 3d at 62. None of the exceptions 
applies in this case. In fact, pursuant to the terms of the APA, Ferro expressly declined to assume liability for pre-APA conduct 
by Synpro."
997,12," And as a common sense proposition, it is undeniable that if the Antitrust Plaintiffs believed they had uncovered another 
defendant against which they possessed evidence of viable claims, they would have added that defendant to the Antitrust 
Cases. That they did not illustrates rather clearly that no claims were asserted in the Antitrust Cases that arose out of Synpro's 
retained liabilities."
997,13," As discussed in further detail infra, Ferro's other sources are not probative of the issues in this case."
997,14," Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides, in part, that ""[e]very contract, combination [. . .] or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or 
commerce among the several States, […] is declared to be illegal."" 15 U.S.C. § 1. To prove a violation, the plaintiff must 
establish, inter alia, that the defendants contracted, combined or conspired among each other, and that the objects of and "
998,," conduct pursuant to that contract or conspiracy were illegal. Expert Masonry, Inc. v. Boone County, Ky., 440 F.3d 336, 342 (6th 
Cir. 2006) (citations omitted)."
998,15," The Court questions the applicability of such authority to the case at bar because Cookson is not an insurance company, and 
the APA, while it includes certain insurance-related features, is not an insurance policy. See Dobbelaere v. Cosco, Inc., No. 11-
99-18, 2000 Ohio App. LEXIS 1706, 2000 WL 425754 (Ohio App. 3d Dist. Apr. 20, 2000) (applying contract (not insurance) law 
to dispute over duty to defend and indemnify between parties to an asset purchase agreement that were not insurance 
companies). The APA was an arm's length transaction negotiated between two sophisticated business  [**22] entities. Thus, 
many (if not all) of the policy justifications underlying insurance law are absent from the instant case. These justifications include 
the adhesive nature of insurance contracts in which the insured has little, if any, bargaining power, the public policy objective of 
compensating tort victims, and the inequity of permitting an insurer to receive a windfall due to a technicality. See Ferrando v. 
Auto-Owners Mut. Ins. Co., 98 Ohio St. 3d 186, 195, 2002 Ohio 7217, 781 N.E.2d 927 (2002) (discussing issues regarding the 
timeliness of notice to an insurer). "
1000,16," To the extent that any of the cases cited by Ferro suggest otherwise, the Court's view is that any such interpretation reads 
Willoughby  [**29] Hills too broadly. Like the court in Nat'l Diary Herd, the Court reads Willoughby Hills to permit reference to 
evidence outside the pleadings to determine the duty to defend only where the pleadings themselves admit of at least an 
arguably covered claim. Willoughby Hills requires, at a minimum, that a party seeking a defense from an insurer demonstrate the 
existence of a potentially or arguably covered claim on the basis of the pleadings. Reference to extrinsic evidence is appropriate 
only to clarify whether a potentially or arguably covered claim is, in fact, covered."
1000,17," Ferro also asserts that, somehow, its duty to defend claim is supported by the fact that the releases it obtained from the 
Antitrust Plaintiffs in the settled cases released claims against Synpro. This is nonsensical. The content of a release of claims is 
not, in any recognizable way, evidence that, in fact, such claims were asserted. "
1001,18," The plaintiffs' response does list several ""Non-Defendant Plastics Additives Producers,"" including Cardinal Companies, L.P., 
OM  [**36] Group, Inc., and Reagens Canada, Ltd. (Niehaus Aff., Ex. 4, at 9, PP 1-3.)"
1001,19," The individuals and companies allegedly involved were Nirmal Jain, Seymour Cohen, and Larry Brecker of Crompton, David 
Fultz of Atofina, and Kees Van Neirop, Richard Miller, and Don Hampson of Akzo."
1001,20," Three of the four also implicate Ferro in the same increase. The fourth, while not matched by Ferro on the same day, was 
preceded by a Ferro price increase less than two months prior. (Niehaus Aff., Ex. 4, at 17.) "
1002,21," For instance, in the four pages of deposition transcript attached to Ferro's motion, Jain was  [**39] asked whether he met with 
Christopher Canarius of Ferro, Peter Anderson of Morton, and Robert Jones of Morton, and gave the same response as he did 
when asked about a meeting with Jennings: he asserted his Fifth Amendment rights. In fact, not only did Jain refuse to answer 
questions about meetings with other executives, he refused to answer any questions at all, even ones that had no potential to 
elicit an incriminating response. For example, when asked whether Morton was acquired by Rohm & Haas, Jain asserted his 
Fifth Amendment privilege."
1002,22," In civil cases, the Supreme Court has held it permissible to draw a negative inference against a defendant based upon that 
defendant's invocation of his Fifth Amendment privilege. See In re Moses, 792 F.Supp. 529, 536 (E.D. Mich. 1992) (citations 
omitted). Ferro, however, asks the Court to draw negative inferences against Cookson/Synpro based on the invocation of the 
Fifth Amendment privilege by Jain, an employee of Crompton. Ferro cites no authority that would allow such an inference, nor is 
the Court aware of any. "
1004,23," Kaplan was not involved in any of the other three cases, and therefore his statements have no bearing on issues relating to 
those cases. (Kaplan Aff. at 1, n. 1.)"
1004,24," Notably, this is an erroneous legal position. Under Ohio law, the purchaser of assets is only liable for pre-acquisition torts of 
the acquired company if it expressly assumes such liability. See Flaugher v. Cone Automatic Mach. Co., 30 Ohio St. 3d 60, 62, 
30 Ohio B. 165, 507 N.E.2d 331 (1987). Pursuant to the APA, Cookson expressly retained, and Ferro expressly did not assume, 
such liability. "
1005,25," As explained supra, this is dispositive of Ferro's claims."
1005,26, See Rains Aff. 7. 
1006,27," For the reasons stated previously, the Court finds the Jain and Brecker depositions are not probative of any relevant issue. 
Moreover, the Kaplan affidavit does not support Ferro's claim because Kaplan does no more than declare facts elsewhere 
evident from the record (that Ferro acquired Synpro assets and that discovery requests asked about both  [**52] Ferro and 
Synpro) and provide his characterization of the record in the Direct Purchaser Litigation. Kaplan's assertion that the record in the 
Direct Purchaser Litigation included evidence against both Synpro and Ferro is irrelevant. Ferro has had every opportunity to put 
forth any evidence that was in that record, and Kaplan's personal belief about the contents of that record does nothing to add to 
or subtract from any inference properly drawn from that record. Finally, the fact that Jennings refused to speak with Rains when 
asked does not aid Ferro's claim. Ferro had every opportunity to depose Jennings but declined to do so. Jennings has submitted 
a declaration in support of Cookson's motion, the contents of which are not contradicted by any evidence in the record."
1006,28," Without question, the Antitrust Plaintiffs, represented by highly sophisticated counsel, knew how to and had every incentive to 
assert claims against Cookson/Synpro had they thought such claims warranted by the evidence. "
1007,29," In a sale of corporate assets, the buyer corporation is not liable for the seller's tortious conduct unless one of four exceptions 
applies: (1) the buyer expressly or impliedly agrees to assume such liability; (2) the transaction amounts to a de facto 
consolidation or merger; (3) the buyer corporation is merely a continuation of the seller corporation; or (4) the transaction is 
entered into fraudulently for the purpose of escaping liability. Flaugher, 30 Ohio St. 3d at 62.  [**56] None of the exceptions 
applies in this case. In fact, pursuant to the terms of the APA, Ferro expressly declined to assume liability for pre-APA conduct 
by Synpro."
1007,30," The record does not reveal any indication that Ferro sought to assert this defense. Nor does it appear that Ferro sought to 
dispel any impression the Antitrust Plaintiffs may have had that Ferro could have been held liable for Synpro's conduct. (See 
Defs.' Opp. to Pl.'s Mot. for Partial Summ. J., at 12-13.) The inference to be drawn from this is that Ferro did not do so because it 
perceived a potential benefit from allowing that impression to persist. No such inference, however, is necessary to support the 
Court's decision in this matter."
1007,31," Issues exist regarding the timeliness of the notice provided by Ferro to Cookson, the factual support for Ferro's claim, and 
possible prejudice to Cookson resulting from the delay. Neither party focused its summary judgment briefing on these issues. 
The record before the Court does not permit resolution of the notice issues. For the reasons stated herein, however, resolution 
of such issues is not necessary. "
1008,32," Arguably, it would be impossible for Ferro to make such a showing, regardless of the contents of the underlying factual record, 
because the express terms of the APA  [**59] precluded Ferro from taking on any antitrust liability relative to Synpro. Because 
the Court finds that, in any event, the record contains no evidence of antitrust violations by Synpro, the Court need not address 
this argument."
1008,33," In order for Ferro to establish affirmatively that Cookson owed it a duty to indemnify, in addition to setting forth conclusive facts 
establishing antitrust liability attributable to Synpro, Ferro also would have to show that Ferro was sued in the Antitrust Cases 
based upon claims arising out of Synpro's retained liabilities. As stated elsewhere in this Memorandum Opinion, the Court 
concludes that the claims against Ferro in the Antitrust Cases did not arise out of Synpro's retained liabilities. "
1009,34," In this regard, the Fifth Circuit stated that it did ""not find it necessary to define the policy of the antitrust laws or to decide 
whether that policy would invalidate some or all indemnity agreements made in connection with the sale of a business [. . .]."" 760 
F.2d at 584. Ferro points to this statement as effectively nullifying the precedential value of the decision. The Court disagrees. It 
appears that by this statement, the Fifth Circuit meant nothing more than that it did not intend to invalidate all contractual 
indemnity agreements regarding antitrust liability. Based upon the court's analysis, it is clear that it relied upon certain principles 
of antitrust law in reaching its decision, most notably the principle of joint and several liability. The effect of that decision was to 
nullify the contractual indemnity agreement at issue in the case. Thus, to the extent of this reliance, the Fifth Circuit did indeed 
define (or at least apply) antitrust policy, just not to the extent that would per se invalidate contractual indemnity agreements in 
the antitrust context. In addition, to the extent Ferro contends that MacMillan Bloedel was limited  [**65] to its facts, the Court 
finds those facts to be identical to the facts of the instant case in all material respects, save one: the indemnification provision did 
not also include a provision for defense. As explained in further detail infra, the Court finds that the Fifth Circuit's analysis in 
MacMillan Bloedel nevertheless appropriately extends, under the circumstances, to a claim for defense. "
1010,35," Ferro argues that MacMillan Bloedel is distinguishable because it seeks indemnification from Cookson, not Synpro. But in 
reaching its decision, which it based upon the  [**68] fact that MacMillan Bloedel faced the same liability from the antitrust 
actions whether or not it acquired the Flintkote assets, the court's focus was on the party seeking indemnification, not the party 
from which the indemnification was sought. Thus, the case cannot be distinguished on this basis. Ferro, like MacMillan Bloedel, 
faced the same amount of liability in the Antitrust Cases whether or not it acquired the Synpro assets."
1010,36," The language of the corresponding indemnification provision in MacMillan Bloedel arguably is broader than that used in the 
APA. In MacMillan Bloedel, the seller was obligated to ""indemnify"" MacMillan Bloedel ""and save them harmless from, any and all 
liabilities, contingent or otherwise … with respect to and arising from the operations of [those assets] by [Flintkote] prior to the 
closing date."" 760 F.2d at 582. Here, the APA provided that ""Cookson and [Synpro], jointly and severally, shall hold harmless, 
indemnify and defend [Ferro] and permitted successors and assigns from and against any loss, claim, cause of action or liability, 
cost or expense including, without limitation, fines, penalties, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees, consultants' fees, 
 [**69] disbursements and expenses, that arise out of Synpro's retained liabilities. For the reasons explained herein, however, 
this makes no difference. Specifically, the rationale behind MacMillan Bloedel focuses on the joint and several nature of antitrust 
liability in reaching the conclusion that the liability at issue did not arise out of the seller's pre-acquisition conduct. This rationale 
is unaffected by the different language used to define the defense and indemnification provision of the APA. "
1019,1," Abbott argues that Federal Circuit law bars Plaintiffs' reliance on a monopoly leveraging theory, citing In re Independent 
Service Organizations Antitrust Litigation, 203 F.3d 1322 (Fed. Cir. 2000), in support of its position. According to Abbott, the 
scope of its rights depends on the resolution of a substantial question of federal patent law, and therefore the Federal Circuit has 
jurisdiction over any appeal. The Court considered and rejected this argument in In re Abbott Labs. Norvir Antitrust Litigation, 
and it adheres to that decision. Kodak clearly touched upon the limits of a patentee's rights, and yet the Ninth Circuit crafted a 
rule as a matter of federal antitrust law, based on Supreme Court precedent. To the extent Federal Circuit law interprets that 
same precedent in a way that would warrant dismissal of Plaintiffs' claims (and  [**9] it is not clear that Independent Service 
Organizations would in fact require dismissal), the Court will follow the Ninth Circuit because those claims arise under the 
Sherman Act, not federal patent law."
1019,2," HN6[
] Exclusionary bundled pricing is not necessarily mutually exclusive with a monopoly leveraging theory; bundled pricing 
can serve as the means by which a plaintiff exploits its monopoly in one market to enhance its monopoly in another market. 
Thus, both Kodak and Cascade hypothetically could apply at the same time. "
1021,3, The Court grants Plaintiffs' request for judicial notice of this portion of the expert rebuttal report. 
1022,4," These figures are found in a Health and Human Services letter referred to in the complaint. The Court uses them for illustrative 
purposes, not as evidence in support of its decision."
1022,5," Because Abbott does not sell lopinavir separately, the price of unbundled lopinavir cannot be used as a starting point for the 
calculation, as the Cascade rule contemplates will ordinarily be done. Nonetheless, only two variables are required in order to 
derive the ""discounted price"" of lopinavir. To demonstrate this, assume that Abbott sells lopinavir separately for price ""x."" The 
cumulative discount represented by Kaletra would then be x + $ 17.14 - $ 18.78, or x - $ 1.64, all of which must be allocated to 
the lopinavir portion pursuant to the rule. Subtracting the discount of x - $ 1.64 from the price of lopinavir, x, results in an imputed 
discounted price of $ 1.64."
1022,6," The Meijer Plaintiffs argue that Abbott's average variable costs should include more than just the cost of manufacturing; they 
argue that marketing and promotion costs should also be included. This is a valid argument, and would raise the average 
variable cost above the pennies-per-pill cost of manufacturing. However, because the Court finds that the Cascade rule does not 
apply, it need not determine whether marketing and similar costs should be considered when calculating Abbott's average 
variable cost."
1022,7," It is notable that Cascade and the law review article on which it relies are based on the premise that, in a perfectly competitive 
market, the market price will equal the marginal cost. See Cascade, 515 F.3d at 909; Areeda & Turner, supra, at 702. However, 
in the pharmaceutical industry, even in a crowded field of competing drugs, market prices will typically be well above marginal 
costs. See, e.g., Peter K. Yu, the International Enclosure Movement, 82 Ind. L.J. 827, 898 n.377 (2007) (""The model of price-
setting in a perfectly competitive market suggests that prices  [**22] are based upon marginal costs. But this model obviously 
does not apply for Pharmaceuticals, for if they were priced according to their marginal costs, they would be very inexpensive, but 
in the long run no expenditures on R&D would be made.""); Brianna Carignan, Legalizing Importation of Prescription Drugs: The 
Economic Implications of the Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act of 2005, 12 New Eng. J. Int'l & Comp. L. 161, 
165 (2005) (""[T]he developer of a drug could never recover its research and development costs by charging prices near its 
marginal cost of production. The economic purpose of patents is to bar entry of copy products for the term of the patent, to 
provide the innovator firm with an opportunity to price above marginal cost and thereby recoup R&D expense, in order to 
preserve incentives for future R&D. Without patents, generic Pharmaceuticals could enter the market immediately and price at 
marginal cost because they would not have any R&D expenses to recover."") (citation, internal quotation marks and alterations 
omitted). Abbott notes that Cascade involves bundled discounting in the provision of healthcare services. Abbott asserts that the 
healthcare services  [**23] industry is one with high fixed costs, and thus pharmaceutical cases cannot be distinguished from 
Cascade. However, while the provision of healthcare services may involve high fixed costs, variable costs -- including the cost of 
compensating medical professionals for their time -- are high as well. As a result, the healthcare services industry does not 
exhibit the great disparity between fixed and variable costs found in the pharmaceutical industry. "
1023,8," In contrast, manufacturing efficiency is an appropriate focus when the issue is competition between different manufacturers of a 
single drug for which the patent  [**24] has expired. Accordingly, the Cascade rule would achieve the desired effect when 
applied in such a case."
1023,9," It may be possible to adjust the rule to shift the focus away from the marginal cost of manufacturing pills. For instance, it may 
be appropriate to require Plaintiffs to show, not that $ 1.64 is less than Abbott's cost of producing 200 milligrams of lopinavir, but 
that  [**25] $ 1.64 is not a profitable price for the sale of a 200-mg dose of lopinavir, taking into account the costs Abbott incurred 
prior to introducing lopinavir to the market. Such a ""modified"" Cascade rule may be difficult to implement in practice. For instance, if Abbott has already recouped its 
investment in lopinavir, $ 1.64 may be a profitable price for it today, even if Abbott could not have hoped to recoup its investment 
by selling lopinavir for $ 1.64 when it was first introduced to the market. At the same time, asking if $ 1.64 would have been a 
profitable price for lopinavir when Abbott first introduced it to the market would require the development of complex economic 
models that depend on variables which may not be readily ascertainable."
1023,10," In their briefs on the present motions, these Plaintiffs articulate two theories of antitrust liability that the plaintiffs in In re Abbott 
Labs Norvir Antitrust Litigation have not asserted. Because the complaints in the present cases do not assert separate claims 
based on these ""new"" theories, however, the Court need not rule on their validity. The Court thus addresses only whether 
Plaintiffs may proceed on their claims for monopolization and attempted monopolization under the Sherman Act. "
1024,11," In addition, Abbott's argument presupposes that it will raise its patents as an affirmative defense. Because this defense does 
not appear clearly on the face of the pleading, dismissal at this stage is not appropriate in any event. "
1026,12," The only case Abbott cites is a federal case in which the court predicted that the Fourth Circuit would not find a violation of § 2 
of the Sherman Act based on a monopoly leveraging theory. Bepco, Inc. v. Allied-Signal, Inc., 106 F. Supp. 2d 814, 833 
(M.D.N.C. 2000). This sheds no light on the question of whether the North Carolina Supreme Court would accept such a theory 
under the Unfair Trade Practices Act. Moreover, the Bepco court permitted the plaintiffs to proceed on their claims under the 
Unfair Trade Practices Act."
1026,13," For the same reason, GSK has also stated a claim under the North Carolina Prohibition Against Monopolization, N.C. Gen. 
Stat. § 75-2.1."
1026,14," Abbott argues that, in order for a claim for deceptive behavior to lie, there must be detrimental reliance upon a statement or 
misrepresentation, citing Business Cabling, Inc. v. Yokeley, 643 S.E.2d 63, 69 (N.C. Ct. App. 2007), in support of its position. 
Yokeley, however, was concerned with determining whether the plaintiff had established causation between the deceptive acts 
and a compensable injury. No such issue is present here. In addition, another North Carolina appeals court has held that HN17[ ] actual reliance  [**36] on a misrepresentation is not required. See Cullen v. Valley Forge Life Ins. Co., 161 N.C. App. 570,"
1026,589," S.E.2d 423, 431 (N.C. Ct. App. 2003). "
1031,1, (a) Appointment. 
1032,," (1) Unless a statute provides otherwise, a court may appoint a master only to: (A) perform duties consented to by the parties;"
1032,*," * * (C) address pretrial and post-trial matters that cannot be addressed effectively and timely by an available district judge or 
magistrate judge of the district."
1032,2," In support of their Motion for Class Certification, the DP Plaintiffs submitted an opening Memorandum of Law (""Pl. Br.""), a 
Reply Memorandum of Law (""Pl. Reply""), a Reply to Defendants' Sur-Reply Regarding Class Certification (""Pl. Sur-Rebuttal""), 
and a Notice of Supplemental Authority (Pl. Suppl. Br.""), as well as numerous exhibits, including expert reports and declarations 
regarding class certification issues and damages. Similarly, in opposition to the Motion, Defendants submitted a Response Brief 
(""Def. Resp."") and a Sur-Reply Brief (""Def. Sur-Reply""), also accompanied by voluminous exhibits and expert reports. The expert 
materials submitted by the parties in connection with this Motion include the following, which are cited herein as indicated: (For 
DP Plaintiffs) Declaration of Jeffrey J. Leitzinger, Ph.D. (""Dr. Leitzinger"") dated May  [*12] 27, 2005 (attached as Exh. 1 to Pl. 
Br.) (""Leitzinger 5/27/04 Decl.""), Expert Report of Dr. Leitzinger, Ph.D. dated Aug. 2, 2007 (attached as Exh. 24 to 11/2/07 
Pearlman Decl.) (""Leitzinger 8/2/07 Rep.""), Class Certification Rebuttal Declaration of Dr. Leitzinger dated Nov. 2, 2007 
(attached as Exh. 31 to 11/2/07 Pearlman Decl.) (""Leitzinger 11/2/07 Decl.""), and Supplemental Class Declaration of Dr. 
Leitzinger dated Dec. 14, 2007 (attached as Exh. to Pl. Sur-Rebuttal) (""Leitzinger 12/14/07 Decl.""); and (For Defendants) Expert 
Report of Daniel L. Rubinfeld (""Dr. Rubinfeld"") Regarding Certification of Proposed Class of Direct Purchasers dated Aug. 9, 
2007 (attached as Exh. 1 to 8/9/07 O'Shaughnessy Decl.) (""Rubinfeld 8/9/07 Rep."") and Sur-Rebuttal Report of Dr. Rubinfeld 
Regarding Certification of the Proposed Class of Direct Purchasers dated Nov. 20, 2007 (attached as Exh. 4 to Def. Sur-Reply) 
(""Rubinfeld 11/20/07 Rep.""). Finally, on April 9, 2008, Defendants submitted a letter Brief addressing the recent decision issued 
by Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Am. Seed Co., Inc. v. Monsanto Co., 271 Fed. Appx. 138, 2008 WL 857532 (3d Cir. 2008). 
On April 11, 2008, the DP Plaintiffs submitted  [*13] a responsive letter Brief attaching a class certification order issued in the 
matter of Louisiana Wholesale Drug Co, Inc. v. Sanofi-Aventis, No. 07 CIV 7343 (S.D.N.Y. April 8, 2008). "
1034,3," Although the parties' briefs do not address the geographic location of the putative class members, the record suggests that 
they are likely dispersed. See Rubinfeld 8/9/07 Rep. at Exh. 3 (listing 45 proposed class members including, inter alia, numerous 
regional wholesalers)."
1034,4," At the November 30, 2007 oral argument, Defendants' counsel suggested, for the first time, that the proposed Class may not 
satisfy the numerosity requirement. See 11/30/07 Tr. at 63-67. According to Defendants, the proposed Class of 47 members 
identified by Dr. Leitzinger should be reduced by the nine members who, according to Dr. Rubinfeld, have no injury. See 
11/30/07 Tr. at 66; Rubinfeld 11/20/07 Rep. Defendants contend that joinder of all members is not impractical as to the resulting 
Class of 38 members and argued: ""If these people can identify 38 class members and if there are 38 who really want to 
participate in the litigation, they can identify them individually and then we're entitled to litigate our defenses against them."" See 
11/30/07 Tr. at 66. In my view, Defendants' arguments do not defeat numerosity. First, the question of whether nine proposed 
Class members suffered injury is a disputed merits issue which I decline to resolve at this time. See Leitzinger 12/14/07 Decl. 
(disputing Dr. Rubinfeld's analysis regarding the nine proposed class members and opining that it is based on a misapplication 
of Dr. Leitzinger's  [*20] aggregate damages model). See also In re Pressure Sensitive Labelstock Antitrust Litig., MDL No. 
1556, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 85466, 2007 WL 415066, *7 (M.D. Pa. Nov. 19, 2007) (""'To the extent that [class certification] 
involves a battle of experts, it [is] not appropriate for the Court to determine which expert is more credible at this time.'"") (quoting 
In re Linerboard Antitrust Litig., 203 F.R.D. 197, 217 n. 13 (E.D. Pa. 2001)). Second, even if the proposed Class consisted of 
only 38 members, that fact, alone, would not defeat numerosity, particularly where the members appear to be dispersed 
geographically and the interests of judicial economy would be served by resolving the common issues raised in this case in a "
1035,," single action, rather than 38 individual ones. See In re Meijer, Inc. v. Warner Chilcott Holdings Co. III, Ltd., 246 F.R.D. 293, 2007 
WL 3257015, *10 (D.D.C. 2007)."
1035,5," As a practical matter, the commonality requirement ""rarely has resulted in the denial of class certification in an antitrust action."" 
Antitrust Law Developments 3d at 314. In fact, some courts have opined that because most class actions are brought pursuant 
to Rule 23(b)(3), that subsection's predominance requirement (discussed infra) has rendered the commonality requirement 
 [*24] of Rule 23(a)(2) almost superfluous. See e.g., Martino v. McDonald's Sys., 81 F.R.D. 81, 85 (N.D. Ill. 1979). "
1036,6," See Def. Resp.; Def. Sur-Reply; 11/30/07 Tr. at 22-23, 68. "
1037,7," According to Defendants' counsel, examples of the allegedly individual defenses ""are the assignments and cost-plus contracts."" 
See 11/30/07 Tr. at 68. These defenses appear to relate only to the big three national wholesalers, McKesson Corp. 
(""McKesson""), Cardinal Health, Inc. (""Cardinal"") and AmeriSource Bergen Corp. (""ABC"") (collectively, the ""Big Three""), none of 
which is a representative of the proposed Class. See Def. Resp. at 18-22. Counsel also indicated that Defendants intend to 
contest injury and damages as to nine of the absent class members. See 11/30/07 Tr. at 68. "
1038,8," I further note that the District Court previously approved of the Berger & Montague and Garwin, Gerstein firms as co-lead 
counsel for the proposed DP Plaintiff Class. See Doc. Nos. 57 and 127. The District Court also granted preliminary and final 
approval of the DP Plaintiffs' settlement with Defendant Wyeth (f/k/a American Home Products) and, thus, necessarily 
determined that counsel satisfied the adequacy requirement of rule 23(a)(4). See Doc. Nos. 176 and 226."
1038,9," Defendants also speculate that pharmacy benefit management (""PBM"") companies that are members of the proposed DP 
Plaintiff class may be harmed by generic entry, to the extent that they receive rebates from Schering on brand name K-Dur 20 
large enough to offset the price differential between the branded drug and the generic and do not pass all rebates on to their 
insurer customers. See Def. Resp. at 40 n. 28. Thus, according to Defendants, ""[i]t is possible that some PBMs are financially 
better off with branded K-Dur. . . ."" Id. As is noted, infra,  [*34] such speculative and hypothetical conflicts are insufficient to 
defeat adequacy. See, e.g., In re Cardizem, 200 F.R.D. at 306 (""To defeat certification, 'the conflict must be more than merely 
speculative or hypothetical.'"") (quoting 5 Moore's Federal Practice, § 23.25(4)(b)(ii))."
1038,10," Defendants raised essentially identical arguments in connection with their appeal of Magistrate Judge Haneke's March 24, 
2005 Order denying Defendants' Motion for downstream discovery from the DP Plaintiffs. In my Report and Recommendation 
dated January 2, 2007 (the ""Jan. 2, 2007 Report""), I declined to follow Valley Drug and recommended that Judge Hanake's 
March 24, 2005 Order be affirmed. See Jan. 2, 2007 Report. "
1039,11," In Valley Drug, the Eleventh Circuit acknowledged that pursuant to the Supreme Court's holding in Hanover Shoe, an antitrust 
defendant generally cannot assert a ""pass-on"" defense against a direct purchaser. Valley Drug, 350 F.3d at 1192. The Valley 
Drug court also did not dispute that a ""direct purchaser who passes on overcharges to his customers nevertheless suffers 
cognizable antitrust injury and may sue to recover damages regardless of whether he actually profited from the defendants' 
conduct."" Id. The court reasoned, however, that the issues of a direct purchaser's  [*37] standing and damages are distinct from 
""the issue of whether class certification is appropriate where a fundamental conflict exists among the named and unnamed 
members of the class."" Id. Based on this analysis, the court narrowly construed Hanover Shoe and concluded that it directs ""a 
court to overlook the potential net gain, or conversely the potential absence of a net loss, that a direct purchaser may in fact 
have experienced for purposes of providing the direct purchaser with standing to sue and a means for calculating damages in 
antitrust violation litigation.,"" but ""does not hold that this net economic gain must be ignored or overlooked . . . when determining 
whether Rule 23 has been satisfied."" Id. at 1193. I respectfully disagree with the reasoning of Valley Drug and concur in the 
Ovcon court's observation that ""the Eleventh Circuit's holding fails to appreciate the true import of the Hanover Shoe rule that a 
direct purchaser may recover the full amount of the overcharge, even if he otherwise benefitted, because the antitrust 'injury 
occurs and is complete when the defendant sells at the illegally high price.'"" Ovcon, 246 F.R.D. 293, 2007 WL 3257015, at *9 
(quoting In re Cardizem, 200 F.R.D. at 313). "
1040,12," The representatives of the Big Three also have affirmatively and expressly (1) stated that there is no ""antagonism or conflict"" 
between the interests of LWD in pursuing overcharge damages and the ""overall economic and legal interests"" of the Big Three; 
and (2) waived any potential conflict between the Big Three and LWD, should the Court find that one may exist. See Jones Aff. 
at P 9-10; Factor Aff. at P 9-10; Kauffman Aff. at 7-9. "
1041,13," The Advisory Committee notes to Rule 23 state that the requirements of Rule 23(b)(3) were adopted to ""encompass[] those 
cases in which a class action would achieve economies of time, effort, and expense, and promote uniformity of decision as to 
persons similarly situated, without sacrificing procedural fairness or bringing about other undesirable results."" See Fed. R. Civ. 
P. 23, Advisory Committee Notes, 1966 Amendment, Subdivision (b)(3). See also Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 
591, 615, 117 S. Ct. 2231, 138 L. Ed. 2d 689 (1997). Providing examples of the application of Rule 23(b)(3), the Advisory 
Committee explains  [*46] that a case involving fraud ""perpetrated on numerous persons by the use of similar representations"" 
could be suitable for certification, even if damages had to be determined separately. Id. In contrast, a ""mass accident"" involving 
significant individual questions of liability, defenses and damages ordinarily would be unsuitable for class treatment. Id. With 
respect to proposed antitrust class actions, the Advisory Committee Notes state that ""[p]rivate damage claims by numerous 
individuals arising out of concerted antitrust violations may or may not involve predominating common questions."" Id. "
1042,14," The fact of injury element is referred to interchangeably as ""injury-in-fact,"" ""impact"" and ""fact of damage."" See, e.g., ABA 
Section of Antitrust Law, Antitrust Law Developments (5th ed. 2002) at 839;  [*48] Rossi v. Standard Roofing, Inc., 156 F.3d 
452, 483 (3d Cir. 1998). Fact of injury is often analyzed in conjunction with the related concept of ""antitrust injury."" Fact of injury 
focuses on whether the plaintiff sustained injury to his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws. 
See Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 489, 97 S. Ct. 690, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977). The concept of 
""antitrust injury"" focuses on whether the ""injury [is] of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and . . . flows from that 
which makes the defendants' acts unlawful. The injury should reflect the anticompetitive effect either of the violation or of the 
anticompetitive acts made possible by the violation."" Id. See also City of Pittsburgh v. West Penn Power Co., 147 F.3d 256 (3d 
Cir. 1998) (discussing ""antitrust standing"" and ""antitrust injury"")."
1042,15," I note that once a plaintiff has established the fact of injury element of an antitrust claim, the standard of proof required with 
respect to the amount of damages is less stringent and is satisfied by a reasonable approximation. See, e.g., J. Truett Payne, 
451 U.S. 557, 566-67, 101 S. Ct. 1923, 68 L. Ed. 2d 442 (1981). The relatively relaxed standard of proof for the  [*49] amount of 
damages recognizes the principle that ""it does not 'come with very good grace' for the wrongdoer to insist upon specific proof of 
the injury which it has itself inflicted."" Id. at 567 (quoting Hetzel v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 169 U.S. 26, 18 S. Ct. 255, 42 L. Ed. 
648 (1898). "
1044,16," In Am. Seed Co., the Third Circuit affirmed the district court's decision denying certification of a class of purchasers of 
genetically engineered corn seed on the ground that the proposed class failed to satisfy the predominance requirement See Am. 
Seed Co., 271 Fed. Appx. 138, 2008 WL 857532. Although I am guided by the Court's reaffirmance of Bogosian and Linerboard 
II in Am. Seed Co., the case is factually inapposite in two fundamental respects. First, as the district court noted in Am Seed Co., 
the ""'market for [genetically modified] seeds is highly individualized  [*56] depending on geographic location, growing conditions, 
consumer preference and other factors.'"" Am. Seed Co. v. Monsanto Co., 238 F.R.D 394, 400 (D. Del. 2006) (""Am. Seed Co. I"") 
(quoting Sample v. Monsanto Co., 218 F.R.D. 644 (E.D. Mo. 2003). Second, in contrast to the DP Plaintiffs' expert in this case, 
the plaintiffs' expert in Am. Seed Co. failed ""to provide[] any actual data for the court's review as to the 'factual setting of the 
case'""; failed to cite any ""factual authority in his declaration in support of his theory of common impact""; failed to conduct a 
""preliminary study of the market""; failed to independently analyze the documents produced during class discovery""; and did not 
""study the pricing and/or pricing variability"" of the products at issued in that case. Am. Seed Co., 271 Fed. Appx. 138, 2008 WL 
857352, at *3 (quoting Am. Seed Co. I, 238 F.R.D. at 400-01)."
1044,17," According to the DP Plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Leitzinger, overcharges of Class members occurred in one or more of three ways: 
(1) brand-generic overcharge, represented by the difference between the price paid by Class members for branded K-Dur 20 
and the (lower) price they would have paid for the generic; (2) generic-generic overcharge, representing the difference between 
the prices paid for generics and the  [*58] (lower) price Class members would have paid if generic entry, and subsequent 
additional generic competition, had occurred earlier; and (3) brand-brand overcharge, representing the higher amounts Class 
members paid by reason of being deprived of discounts or price reductions on branded K-Dur they may have received had 
generic entry occurred earlier. See Leitzinger 5/27/04 Decl. at 15-17. Although Dr. Leitzinger opined in his initial class 
certification Declaration that each type of overcharge can be demonstrated with the common proof discussed infra, it is clear that 
his conclusions regarding class-wide impact focus on brand-generic overcharges to Class members who purchased branded K-
Dur 20 during the Class period and who also purchased generic versions of K-Dur 20. See Leitzinger 11/2/07 Decl. at 15 (stating 
that ""the role played by potential but-for branded K-Dur 20 price reductions in my conclusions is simply to recognize as a 
possibility that one mechanism through which AB-rated generic entry can create (and, in fact, has created) competitive benefits 
is through changes in WAC [wholesale acquisition cost] prices or increased discounts from WAC offered by the brand (either "
1045,," generally  [*59] or to selected customers) in order to retain business in the fact of a generic option); and 17 (stating that his 
damages calculation does not include any generic-generic damages)."
1045,18," The DP Plaintiffs allege that but for Defendants' alleged anticompetitive conduct, an AB-rated generic would have entered the 
market no later than November 20, 1998, the date Defendant Upsher received final FDA approval to market its generic version 
of K-Dur 20. See Am. Compl. at PP 101-102."
1045,19, See Pl. Br. at 30-31; Leitzinger 5/2704 Decl. at 17-23; Leitzinger 8/7/07 Rep. at 28-34.
1045,20, See Pl. Br. at 31-32; Leitzinger 5/2704 Decl. at 23-25; Leitzinger 8/7/07 Rep. at 34-38.
1045,21, See Pl. Br. at 32-33; Leitzinger 5/2704 Decl. at 25-27; Leitzinger 8/7/07 Rep. at 39. 
1046,22," Dr. Rubinfeld and Dr. Leitzinger apparently agree, after further review of data, that one proposed Class member, Longs, either 
did not purchase any generic or did not  [*66] purchase it directly and, thus, was initially erroneously included in the proposed 
Class. See Leitzinger 12/14/07 Decl. at 7; Rubinfeld 11/20/07 Rep. at P 9. Because Longs does not fall within the Class 
definition, any injury it may have suffered due to delayed generic entry is irrelevant to the issue of class certification. "
1048,23," Dr. Leitzinger's Report states that he identified Class members through analysis of Schering's and the generic manufacturer's 
transaction data. See Leitzinger 8/2/07 Rep. at 55-56. "
1055,1," General Statutes § 35-32 provides: HN1[
] ""(a) The Attorney  [***3] General, in the name of the state and on behalf of the 
people of the state, shall enforce the provisions of this chapter. He shall investigate suspected violations and institute 
proceedings, for any violation of the provisions of this chapter. Such proceedings may pray that such violation be temporarily or 
permanently enjoined, or otherwise prohibited. ""(b) The Attorney General may also, in his discretion, intervene and appear in any proceeding pending before any court, agency, 
board, or commission in this state in which matters related to this chapter are in issue. "
1056,," ""(c) The Attorney General may also, in enforcing the provisions of this chapter, bring an action in the name of the state as (1) 
parens patriae for persons residing in the state with respect to damages sustained by such persons, or, if the court finds in its 
discretion that the interests of justice so require, as a representative of a class or classes consisting of persons residing in the 
state who have been damaged; or (2) parens patriae with respect to damages to the general economy of the state or any 
political subdivision thereof; provided that such damages shall not be duplicative of those recoverable under subdivision (1) 
 [***4] of this subsection. ""(d) The Attorney General may also bring a civil action in the name of the state in the district courts of the United States under

interests of justice so require, as a representative of a class or classes consisting of persons residing in the state who have been 
damaged; or (2) parens patriae with respect to damages to the general economy of the state or any political subdivision thereof; 
provided that such damages shall not be duplicative of those recoverable under subdivision (1) of this subsection."" (Emphasis 
added.)"
1056,2," General Statutes § 52-265a provides in relevant part: ""(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 52-264 and 52-265, any 
party to an action who is aggrieved by an order or decision of the Superior Court in an action which involves a matter of 
substantial public interest and in which delay may work a substantial injustice, may appeal under this section from the order or 
decision to the Supreme  [***5] Court within two weeks from the date of the issuance of the order or decision. The appeal shall 
state the question of law on which it is based. ""(b) The Chief Justice shall, within one week of receipt of the appeal, rule whether the issue involves a substantial public interest 
and whether delay may work a substantial injustice. . . ."" Because Chief Justice Rogers was unavailable or disqualified from this case, Justice Norcott, as the most senior associate 
justice, who was available, considered and granted the state's unopposed application pursuant to Practice Book § 83-4. 
Moreover, we note that this interlocutory appeal properly is before this court because ""the 'order or decision' referred to in § 52-
265a [a] from which an appeal may be taken need not be a final judgment . . . ."" Laurel Park, Inc. v. Pac, 194 Conn. 677, 678-79 
n.1, 485 A.2d 1272 (1984)."
1056,3," In addition to Marsh and McLennan Companies, Inc., which is a global business services firm with its principal place of 
business in New York, New York, the state named as defendants: (1) Marsh, Inc., which is a subsidiary and operating unit of 
Marsh and McLennan Companies, Inc.; (2) Marsh and McLennan, Inc., a brokerage and consulting  [***6] corporation with its 
principal place of business in New York, New York, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Marsh, Inc.; and (3) Marsh USA, which 
is an insurance brokering and consulting corporation with its principal place of business in Hartford, and is a wholly owned 
subsidiary of Marsh and McLennan, Inc. The state also initially named ACE Financial Solutions, Inc. (ACE), as a defendant, but subsequently withdrew the action as to 
ACE. Accordingly, ACE is not a party to this appeal, and we refer to Marsh and McLennan Companies, Inc., and its subsidiary 
units as the defendants."
1056,4," Our statement of the facts in this appeal from an order of the trial court dismissing one of the state's claims is taken from the 
facts stated in the operative complaint,  [***7] construed in the ""manner most favorable to the pleader."" (Internal quotation marks 
omitted.) Cogswell v. American Transit Ins. Co., 282 Conn. 505, 516, 923 A.2d 638 (2007). "
1057,," The operative complaint is the third amended complaint, which the state filed after the trial court had overruled its objection to 
the defendants' request to revise the second amended complaint. Specifically, the defendants had requested the state to plead 
facts supporting its claim that their activities actually damaged the state's general economy, and also to demonstrate that those 
damages would meet the requirement of § 35-32 (c) (2) such that they not be duplicative of those recoverable under § 35-32 (c) 
(1)."
1057,5," The state's complaint alleged that some insurers that cooperated with the defendants' scheme would provide the defendants 
and their clients with ""B-quotes,"" or fraudulent bids providing the illusion of either decreased coverage or a higher price, to create 
the appearance of the defendants' clients receiving the best bid."
1057,6," According to the state's complaint, over time, as the agreements produced more money for the defendants, they became 
concerned that their clients would learn of the secret payments. The defendants' brokers informed the insurers, which prepared 
the federally mandated disclosure statements  [***10] made available to the clients, that they did not want the bonus payments 
reported. "
1058,7," General Statutes § 35-38 provides: ""In any action instituted by the Attorney General, any individual who has been held to have 
violated this chapter shall forfeit and pay to the state a civil penalty of not more than twenty-five thousand dollars. Any other 
person who has been held to have violated any of the provisions of this chapter shall forfeit and pay to  [***12] the state a civil 
penalty of not more than two hundred fifty thousand dollars."""
1058,8," General Statutes § 35-44b provides: ""It is the intent of the General Assembly that in construing sections 35-24 to 35-46, 
inclusive, the courts of this state shall be guided by interpretations given by the federal courts to federal antitrust statutes."""
1058,9," The trial court reasoned that our decision in Miller's Pond Co., LLC v. New London, 273 Conn. 786, 808, 873 A.2d 965 (2005), 
 [***14] in which we concluded that § 35-44b did not incorporate federal immunity case law doctrines into the antitrust act, was 
inapposite. The trial court concluded that Miller's Pond Co., LLC, was not controlling because it involved state action immunity 
pursuant to General Statutes § 35-31 (b), which does not have a corresponding federal statutory provision, while the Clayton 
Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15c, provides a ""parallel"" parens patriae enforcement statute structured similarly to § 35-32 (c) (2), the statute 
at issue in the present case."
1058,10," The defendants also had moved to strike: (1) the claim for injunctive relief under CUTPA; and (2) the common-law claims for 
breach of fiduciary duty and negligent misrepresentation as barred by the economic loss rule. "
1060,11," Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15 (1970) provides: ""Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by 
reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which 
the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the 
damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee."" See Clayton Act, c. 323, 38 Stat. 731 
(1914)."
1060,12," The Supreme Court did, however, conclude that the Clayton Act ""permits Hawaii to sue in its proprietary capacity for three 
times the damages it has suffered from [the defendants'] alleged antitrust violations."" Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co. of California, 
supra, 405 U.S. 262. The Supreme Court noted that ""an injury to the [s]tate in its proprietary capacity . . . affects the citizens in 
much the same way as an injury of the sort claimed by Hawaii here. Each has the effect of increasing taxes, or reducing 
government services,  [***22] or both. But this does not mean that the two kinds of injuries are identical in nature. Where the 
injury to the [s]tate occurs in its capacity as a consumer in the marketplace, through a payment of money wrongfully induced . . . 
damages are established by the amount of the overcharge."" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 262-63

1060,13," Section 15c of title 15 of the United States Code provides in relevant part: HN7[
] ""(a) Parens patriae; monetary relief; 
damages; prejudgment interest ""(1) Any attorney general of a State may bring a civil action in the name of such State, as parens patriae on behalf of natural 
persons residing in such State, in any district court of the United States having jurisdiction of the defendant, to secure monetary 
relief as provided in this section for injury sustained by such natural persons to their property by reason of any violation of 
sections 1 to 7 of this title. The court shall exclude from the amount of monetary relief awarded in such action any amount of 
monetary relief (A) which duplicates amounts which have been awarded for the same injury, or (B) which is properly allocable to 
(i) natural persons who have excluded their claims pursuant  [***23] to subsection (b) (2) of this section, and (ii) any business 
entity. ""(2) The court shall award the State as monetary relief threefold the total damage sustained as described in paragraph (1) of this 
subsection, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee. The court may award under this paragraph, pursuant to a 
motion by such State promptly made, simple interest on the total damage for the period beginning on the date of service of such 
State's pleading setting forth a claim under the antitrust laws and ending on the date of judgment, or for any shorter period 
therein, if the court finds that the award of such interest for such period is just in the circumstances. In determining whether an 
award of interest under this paragraph for any period is just in the circumstances, the court shall consider only-- ""(A) whether such State or the opposing party, or either party's representative, made motions or asserted claims or defenses so 
lacking in merit as to show that such party or representative acted intentionally for delay or otherwise acted in bad faith; ""(B) whether, in the course of the action involved, such State or the opposing party, or either party's representative,

expeditious proceedings; and "
1061,," ""(C) whether such State or the opposing party, or either party's representative, engaged in conduct primarily for the purpose of

1061,14," General Statutes § 35-31 (b) provides: ""Nothing contained in this chapter shall apply to those activities of any person when 
said activity is specifically directed or required by a statute of this state, or of the United States."" The immunity available under 
the statute has been described as ""narrowly drawn version of the doctrine of state action immunity from antitrust liability 
articulated by the United States  [***27] Supreme Court in Parker v. Brown, [317 U.S. 341, 350-51, 63 S. Ct. 307, 87 L. Ed. 315 
(1943)]."" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Miller's Pond Co., LLC v. New London, supra, 273 Conn. 804. ""[I]n order to be

or required by the government . . . ."" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 806-807."
1061,15," In Parker v. Brown, supra, 317 U.S. 351, the Supreme Court concluded that the Sherman Act was not ""intended to restrain 
state action or official action directed by a state."" We noted in Miller's Pond Co., LLC, that, with respect to municipalities, ""'Parker 
immunity does not apply directly to local governments . . . a municipality's restriction of competition may sometimes be an 
authorized implementation of state policy, and have accorded Parker immunity where that is the case.'"" Miller's Pond Co., LLC v. 
New London, supra, 273 Conn. 801-802, quoting Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Advertising, Inc., 499 U.S. 365, 370, 111 S. Ct. 
1344, 113 L. Ed. 2d 382 (1991). We observed that ""[a] municipality that desires Parker immunity must show that, under the state 
statutory scheme,  [***28] it has both authority to regulate and authority to suppress competition."" (Internal quotation marks 
omitted.) Miller's Pond Co., LLC v. New London, supra, 802. We stated that the ""inquiry into the municipality's statutory authority 
to regulate the field in question has been described as not . . . exacting because whether an ordinance is actually authorized by 
state statute suggests that as long as the local enactment is within a broad view of the authority granted by the state, whether it 
is actually violative of that statute is a question for state authorities, not one of federal antitrust law. . . . Moreover, with respect 
to the municipality's authority to suppress competition, despite the requirement of a clear articulation of a state policy to 
authorize anticompetitive conduct, the statutory authorization need not be explicit; the requirement is met if suppression of 
competition is the foreseeable result of what the statute authorizes."" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. "
1062,16," We noted, inter alia, that Representative Thomas Moukawsher, sponsor of the bill that was enacted as § 35-44b, stated that 
the purpose of the statute was to enhance Connecticut's attractiveness  [***29] to business by implementing ""'a single antitrust 
jurisprudence in the United States,'"" and ""'allow[ing] [businesses] to look to a single case law jurisprudence, in order to know 
whether they're in compliance with our laws or not.'"" Miller's Pond Co., LLC v. New London, supra, 273 Conn. 809 n.23, quoting 
35 H.R. Proc., Pt. 7, 1992 Sess., p. 2387."
1062,17," Moreover, we emphasized that, ""[t]he General Assembly is always presumed to know all the existing statutes and the effect 
that its action or non-action will have upon any one of them . . . as well as the interpretation which the courts have placed upon 
one of its legislative enactments and of the effect that its own nonaction, thereafter may have,"" and we declined to ""torture the 
language of § 35-44b to reach the results, disfavored in our jurisprudence, of overruling past decisions construing § 35-31 (b), or 
impliedly repealing that same statute."" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Miller's Pond Co., LLC v. New 
London, supra, 273 Conn. 812."
1062,18," General Statutes § 35-35 provides: ""The state, or any person, including, but not limited to, a consumer, injured in its business 
or property by any violation of the provisions of this chapter shall recover treble damages, together with a reasonable attorney's 
fee and costs."""
1062,19," The legislative history of § 35-32 (c) (2), which was enacted as part of Public Acts 1976, No. 76-218, is sparse; see 19 S. 
Proc., Pt. 4, 1976 Sess., p. 1410, remarks of Senator David H. Neiditz (stating only that bill gives ""the [a]ttorney [g]eneral the 
funds to sue on behalf of the people of the state and to retain some of those funds to create a division in the [a]ttorney 
[g]eneral's [o]ffice to handle  [***32] anti-trust matters""); but we note that it was enacted contemporaneously with the federal 
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. Indeed, Public Act No. 76-218 also enacted subsection (d) of § 35-32, which 
provides the attorney general with the authorization to bring a civil action in federal court in the name of the state as parens 
patriae under the federal antitrust laws. See footnote 1 of this opinion. Scholarly commentators have described Public Act 76-
218 as ""quite obviously . . . intended to provide the remedy which the United States Supreme Court denied in Hawaii [v. 
Standard Oil Co. of California, supra, 405 U.S. 251]."" J. Maynes, G. Bramblett & G. Brodigan et al., ""Recent History of the 
Connecticut Antitrust Act,"" 50 Conn. B.J. 274, 286 (1976). "
1063,20," As the state concedes, the defendants raised this alternate ground for affirmance properly both before the trial court in their 
memorandum of law in support of their motion to strike, and in their preliminary statement of the issues pursuant to Practice 
Book § 63-4. See, e.g., Connecticut Ins. Guaranty Assn. v. Fontaine, 278 Conn. 779, 784 n.4, 900 A.2d 18 (2006)."
1063,21," HN10[
] Like a  [***35] motion to dismiss, ""[a] motion to strike challenges the legal sufficiency of a pleading . . . and, 
consequently, requires no factual findings by the trial court. As a result, our review of the court's ruling is plenary. . . . We take 
the facts to be those alleged in the complaint that has been stricken and we construe the complaint in the manner most 
favorable to sustaining its legal sufficiency. . . . [I]f facts provable in the complaint would support a cause of action, the motion to 
strike must be denied. . . . Thus, we assume the truth of both the specific factual allegations and any facts fairly provable 
thereunder. In doing so, moreover, we read the allegations broadly . . . rather than narrowly."" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) 
Batte-Holmgren v. Commissioner of Public Health, 281 Conn. 277, 294, 914 A.2d 996 (2007). "
1064,22," The state further pleads that the insurance industry employs approximately 70,000 of Connecticut's citizens and represents 7 
percent of the state's gross product."
1064,23," Indeed, the state notes that these consumers cannot recover from the defendants because of the direct purchaser rule. See, 
e.g., Vacco v. Microsoft Corp., supra, 260 Conn. 82-84."
1064,24," The defendants argue that the state's complaint actually alleges an increase in the spending of the state's general economy, 
as its allegations boil down to the fact that policyholders had to pay more money to insurance companies and large private 
employers based here, and that the insurance companies actually profited from the defendants' bid rigging scheme. The 
defendants then use the state's multiplier theory to show that this increased spending  [***41] resulted in insurance companies 
hiring more employees and spending more money, thus aiding the general economy. Again, this argument appears to be more 
of an attack on the state's proof, and is not, therefore, well taken at this point as the complaint clearly alleges damages to the 
general economy that go beyond those occasioned by insurance companies."
1064,25," Our research indicates that two other states, Nevada and Virginia, have statutes that permit expressly such ""general economy"" 
damages claims; see Nev. Rev. Stat. § 598A.160 (1) (2007) (""[t]he Attorney General may bring a civil action for any violation of 
the provisions of this chapter in the name of the State of Nevada and is entitled to recover damages and secure other relief 
provided by the provisions of this chapter . . . [b] [a]s parens patriae, with respect to direct or indirect damages to the general 
economy of the State of Nevada or any political subdivision thereof""); Va. Code Ann. § 59.1-9.15 (d) (2006) (""[t]he Attorney 
General may bring a civil action to recover damages and secure other relief as provided by this chapter as parens patriae 
respecting injury to the general economy of the Commonwealth""). Indeed, Nevada specifically  [***42] envisions the use of 
statistical evidence to prove such damages, as its statute, which like Connecticut's was enacted in the wake of Hawaii v. 
Standard Oil Co. of California, supra, 405 U.S. 251, specifically provides that the state may prove such damages via ""[s]tatistical 
or sampling methods""; Nev. Rev. Stat. § 598A.160 (2) (a) (1) (2007); or ""such other reasonable system of estimating aggregate 
damages as the court may permit""; Nev. Rev. Stat. § 598A.160 (2) (a) (3) (2007); in permitting it to ""recover the aggregate 
damage sustained by the persons on whose behalf this State sues, without separately proving the individual claims of each such 
person. . . ."" Nev. Rev. Stat. § 598A.160 (2) (a) (2007). "
1065,26," Moreover, the legislature's adoption of § 35-32 (c) (2), despite the United States Supreme Court's explanation in Hawaii v. 
Standard Oil Co. of California, supra, 405 U.S. 262-63 n.14, of the difficulty of calculating general economy damages and the 
potential for duplicative recoveries, indicates the legislature's confidence, which we share, ""in the ability of our . . . courts to 
manage difficult cases."" Lorix v. Crompton Corp., 736 N.W.2d 619, 634-35 (Minn. 2007) (permitting indirect  [***43] purchaser 
claim to go forward notwithstanding ""formidable complexities of proof""). "
1073,1," The MRL “regulates relations  [***5] between the owners and the residents of mobilehome parks.” (Cacho v. Boudreau (2007) 
40 Cal.4th 341, 345 [53 Cal. Rptr. 3d 43, 149 P.3d 473]; see also SC Manufactured Homes, Inc. v. Canyon View Estates, Inc., 
supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 673.) "
1074,2, Three of the dismissed defendants also were associated with Parklane. They are not parties to the present appeal.
1074,3," Defendants Stanley Affordable Homes, Inc., and Stanley Wactler have not appeared on appeal. All other defendant dealers 
appear on appeal as respondents. "
1076,4," In the September 12, 2001, letter (exhibit 2) to plaintiff,  [***13] Parklane stated that “[u]nder California law one company may 
refuse to do business with another company. … [¶] … [¶] [Parklane] has conducted business with many mobilehome dealers in 
your area … [with which Parklane] has … had professional and cordial relationships … . [¶] By contrast, your company has been 
extremely difficult for [Parklane] to conduct business with. For example, you have made false statements regarding [Parklane's 
owner and operator] and you have made derogatory comments to tenants about the park itself. In addition, you have refused to 
sign an arbitration agreement regarding disputes that may arise involving your company, although many other dealers have 
signed similar agreements. As a result of all of the above, [Parklane] has no interest in conducting business with you or your 
company. [¶] I want to make clear that [Parklane] has no objection to you representing any tenant or prospective tenant with 
respect to the sale or purchase of any new or used mobilehome at the park. However, [Parklane] does have an objection to 
doing business with you and your firm and therefore has decided it can no longer rent space to you or your company to sell your 
 [***14] mobilehomes from [the park]. [¶] In conclusion, although you are free to conduct business with tenants and prospective 
tenants with respect to their mobilehomes at Parklane, you and your company will no longer be able to rent space at the park for 
the purpose of selling your mobilehomes.” (Original underscoring & italics.)"
1076,5," “A [mobilehome] owner typically rents a plot of land, called a ‘pad,’ from the owner of a [mobilehome] park. The  [***16] park 
owner provides private roads within the park, common facilities such as washing machines or a swimming pool, and often 
utilities. The [mobilehome] owner often invests in site-specific improvements such as a driveway, steps, walkways, porches, or 
landscaping.” (Yee v. Escondido (1992) 503 U.S. 519, 523 [118 L. Ed. 2d 153, 112 S. Ct. 1522].) "
1077,6," The February 11, 2003, letter (exhibit 1) read in part: “[In your recent letter] you indicate that you have sold a new mobilehome 
for installation … at space No. 19 in the proposed new section at the park[to a prospective tenant]. [¶] [Parklane has] had no 
discussions with you … regarding the development of that space, or any other space in the proposed new section … . [¶] [Thus, 
Parklane] can only conclude that you have either misrepresented the facts to [the prospective tenant] or are otherwise engaging 
in unfair and deceptive business practices. Because it is uncertain … when or if space No. 19 will be developed, you are 
respectfully requested to cease making false representations to third parties regarding that space. … [¶] [Parklane has] begun 
development of the common areas [of] those 29 new mobilehome spaces at  [***18] the park … . However, [Parklane has] 
decided it does not make economic sense to proceed with the development of the actual spaces unless and until [it obtains] 
contributions from one or more joint venturers, to offset part of the development costs. [Parklane expects] the financial 
contributions from such joint venturers to be approximately $ 30,000 per space, plus the cost of certain permits, fees, utility 
systems and improvements. [¶] [Presently,] no development agreement has been entered into with respect to even one of the 
proposed new spaces at the park. [Also, Parklane has not established minimum construction standards or projected the rent to 
be charged for the new spaces.] [¶] It is hard to imagine that [the prospective tenant] would have committed to buying a new 
mobilehome at space No. 19 … without knowing … whether that space will be … developed[,] when and if she will be able to 
take possession[,] what the minimum construction standards will be and[,] how much rent she will have to pay. Accordingly, 
[Parklane has] concluded that you have either misrepresented the facts to [the prospective tenant], or you are simply trying to 
‘set up’ [Parklane] for litigation.  [***19] [¶] … [I]n my letter of September 12, 2001, … I advised you … [that Parklane has] no 
interest in doing business with you … . The misrepresentations you apparently have made to [the prospective tenant] only 
reinforces [Parklane's] belief that it would be a mistake to do business with … you. … [¶] … Because no development 
agreements have been entered into as of this date, [the prospective tenant] is welcome to retain a contractor (other than you) to 
enter into a development agreement for space No. 19, pursuant to the same terms and conditions that [Parklane intends] to offer 
to all other potential developers. If [the prospective tenant] is willing to develop the space and contribute to the costs of 
construction, she would then presumably be in a position to place a new mobilehome on that space … . [A]lthough [Parklane] 
will not enter into a development agreement with you, if [the prospective tenant develops the property] [Parklane] would not 
object to her or her contractor purchasing the mobilehome for that space from you … .” (Original boldface, underscoring & 
italics.) "
1078,7, Health and Safety Code section 18035.3 mandates certain disclosures by dealers of mobilehomes when selling mobilehomes. 
1079,8," It does not appear that the trial court ruled on Parklane's request for judicial notice. However, we examine the pleadings de 
novo. The documents submitted are official records of which we may take judicial notice (Evid. Code, § 452, subds. (c), (g), (h); 
Rodas v. Spiegel (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 513, 518 [104 Cal. Rptr. 2d 439] [records, reports, and orders of administrative agencies 
are “official acts” of which court may take  [***25] judicial notice]; Sanchez v. City of Modesto (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 660, 666, 
fn. 1 [51 Cal. Rptr. 3d 821] [judicial notice of facts in census]; Moehring v. Thomas (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 1515, 1523, fn. 4 
[25 Cal. Rptr. 3d 118] [same].) "
1080,9," “Many  [***29] cases state that [Business and Professions Code] section 16720 was patterned after section 1 of the Sherman 
Act [15 U.S.C. § 1] and that federal law construing section 1 is applicable to resolve problems arising under section 16720. 
[Citations.]” (Morrison v. Viacom, Inc., supra, 66 Cal.App.4th at p. 541, fn. 2.) This is because section 1 of the Sherman Act (15 
U.S.C. § 1) and section 16720 of the Cartwright Act (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 16720) cover similar areas and both are designed to 
foster competition. (Fisherman's Wharf Bay Cruise Corp. v. Superior Court, supra, 114 Cal.App.4th at p. 334.) However, in State 
of California ex rel. Van de Kamp v. Texaco, Inc., supra, 46 Cal.3d 1147, the Supreme Court concluded that unlike its federal 
counterpart, the Cartwright Act did not apply to mergers. In reaching this conclusion, the Supreme Court “stated  [***30] that ‘the 
Sherman Act is not, contrary to our past statements, directly probative on interpretation of the Cartwright Act.’ Though not 
always directly probative of the Cartwright Act drafters' intent, judicial interpretations of the Sherman Act are, nevertheless, often 
helpful because of the similarity in language and purpose between the federal and state statutes. [Citations.]” (Morrison v. 
Viacom, Inc., supra, at p. 541, fn. 2, quoting Van de Kamp, at p. 1168; see also Freeman v. San Diego Assn. of Realtors (1999) 
77 Cal.App.4th 171, 183, fn. 9 [91 Cal. Rptr. 2d 534].) "
1081,10," Thus, plaintiff is foreclosed from arguing on appeal that the allegations in his complaint constitute an illegal tying arrangement 
based upon the rule of reason."
1081,11," Business and Professions Code section 16720 reads in part: “A trust is a combination of capital, skill or acts by two or more 
persons for any of the following purposes: [¶] (a) To create or carry out restrictions in trade or commerce.” Business and Professions Code section 16726 declares that “every trust is unlawful, against public policy and void.” "
1082,12," Plaintiff identified only four vacant spaces that did not require dealer pullouts. These purportedly were reserved to defendant 
Macy Homes, Inc., which placed mobilehomes on three of the lots to model. However, plaintiff refused to pay rent for the time 
his mobilehomes would be placed on Parklane spaces, has abandoned his plea to model mobilehomes, and Parklane was not 
obligated to allow plaintiff to place his mobilehomes in the park without paying rent."
1082,13," Plaintiff alleged that defendant San Jose Advantage Homes, Inc., began advertising the spaces in the new section of the park 
at the end of February 2003, after the February 11, 2003, letter. This allegation was supported by a copy of an undated 
advertisement, exhibit 14.  [***37] The February 11, 2003, letter addressed plaintiff's accusation that he was not permitted to sell a mobilehome to a prospective 
tenant who wished to occupy space No. 19 in the new section of the park. (See fn. 6.) However, according, to plaintiff's exhibits 
and allegations, this space was not offered for sale by defendant San Jose Advantage Homes, Inc., in February 2003 and San 
Jose Advantage Homes, Inc., did not sell a mobilehome for that space until December 2003. "
1083,14," Business and Professions Code section 16727 also prohibits some types of tying arrangements. It reads: “It shall be unlawful 
for any person to lease or make a sale or contract for the sale of goods, merchandise, machinery, supplies, commodities for use 
within the State, or to fix a price charged therefor, or discount from, or rebate upon, such price, on the condition, agreement or 
understanding that the lessee or purchaser thereof shall not use or deal in the goods, merchandise, machinery, supplies, 
commodities, or services of a competitor or competitors of the lessor or seller, where the effect of such lease, sale, or contract 
for sale or such condition, agreement or understanding may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly 
in any line of trade or commerce in any section of the State.” (Ibid.) Business and Professions Code section 16727  [***40] is not applicable because the alleged tying product is real property. 
(Suburban, supra, 101 Cal. App. 3d at pp. 549–550; People v. Mobile Magic Sales, Inc. (1979) 96 Cal. App. 3d 1, 10 [157 Cal. 
Rptr. 749]; Morrison v. Viacom, Inc., supra, 66 Cal.App.4th at pp. 546–547.) Plaintiff asserts that the focus of the Cartwright Act is on protection of the consumer, whereas the Sherman Act focuses on 
prevention of monopolies. Plaintiff notes that the Cartwright Act (Bus. & Prof. Code, §§ 16700–16760) does not contain the 
explicit prohibition against monopolization as is contained in the Sherman Act, 15 United States Code section 2, or mentioned in 
the last phrase of Business and Professions Code section 16727. Plaintiff then asserts that many cases discussing tying 
arrangements inartfully meld together the two concepts of protecting consumers and monopolization, without realizing their 
inherent distinctions. Then, plaintiff argues that the focus of this case is on protecting the consumer, who incurred significant 
injury by paying elevated prices for the mobilehomes purchased for placement in Parklane. However, this appeal is resolved by 
analyzing plaintiff's allegations that there is an illegal tying arrangement  [***41] per se that purportedly violates Business and 
Professions Code section 16720. We conclude that plaintiff cannot establish the tie between the spaces and the purchase of 
mobilehomes. Thus, the distinction plaintiff makes is not significant. "
1084,15," The rationale in Fortner I, supra, 394 U.S. 495 was rejected in Fortner II, U.S. Steel Corp. v. Fortner Enterprises (1977) 429 
U.S. 610, 622 [51 L. Ed. 2d 80, 97 S. Ct. 861] (Fortner II). “After the Court remanded the suit in Fortner I, a bench trial resulted in 
judgment for the plaintiff, and the case eventually made its way back to [the United States Supreme Court]. Upon return, [in 
Fortner II, the United States Supreme Court] unanimously held that the plaintiff's failure of proof on the issue of market power 
was fatal to its case … .” (Illinois Tool Works Inc. v. Independent Ink, Inc., supra, 547 U.S. at p. 36.) In Lessig v. Tidewater Oil Company, supra, 327 F.2d 459, the Ninth Circuit relied on Loew's to observe that market power may 
be “ ‘inferred.’ ” (Id. at p. 470.) Lessig was also abrogated by Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan (1993) 506 U.S. 447 [122 L. Ed. 
2d 247, 113 S. Ct. 884] (discussing 15 U.S.C. § 2 and attempt to monopolize). "
1095,1," The scheme alleged by Discon is a spin on a familiar problem of cost-based price regulation--its tendency to dilute a 
monopolist's incentive to seek the best price for inputs. Even where it cannot channel above-market prices to itself (either by 
corporate affiliation or, as here, by rebates and affiliation), regulation will have been holding the monopolist's selling prices below 
profit-maximizing rates, and it can therefore raise them without loss of net revenue. Where, as here, the input charges are being 
flowed back to the regulated monopolist (or its affiliate), payment of above-market prices even provides a profit opportunity, as it 
more than recovers the artificial hike in input prices (via increased final prices and flowback of the input prices). See IIIA Phillip 
E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law: An Analysis of Antitrust Principles and Their Application P 787b, at 295-301 
(2d ed. 2002); see also Assoc. Gas Dist. v. FERC, 263 U.S. App. D.C. 1, 824 F.2d 981, 995 (D.C. Cir. 1987); cf. Nat'l Rural 
Telecom Ass'n v. FCC, 300 U.S. App. D.C. 226, 988 F.2d 174, 178 (D.C. Cir. 1993). "
1097,2," Rambus notes that Manual 21-I was only adopted after JEDEC approved the SDRAM standard; the Manual came in October 
1993 after JC 42.3 approved the SDRAM standard in March 1993 and JEDEC's governing body adopted it that May. But we will 
assume arguendo that the Commission could reasonably find that this new policy language merely formalized a preexisting 
understanding. "
1105,1," In the Complaint, plaintiff refers to the two entities collectively as ""Sunham Group."" (See Compl. P 4.) Defendants, while noting 
that Ham King Enterprises, Inc. and Sunham Home Fashions, LLC are ""distinct entities with separate business operations,"" (see 
Mot. at 3 n.1), have adopted plaintiff's terminology for purposes of the instant motion, (see id.). "
1106,2," Plaintiff has not alleged a violation of the UCL under the ""fraudulent"" prong. (See Compl. PP 18-20.) "
1108,*, The panel unanimously finds this case suitable for decision without oral argument. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2). 
1114,1," The case law recognizes standing for an indirect purchaser if (1) there was a pre-existing cost-plus contract, see UtiliCorp, 497 
U.S. at 217-18, or (2) the direct purchaser is owned or controlled by the indirect purchaser, Royal Printing Co., 621 F.2d at 326. 
Additionally, this court has held that an indirect purchaser may bring suit where  [**17] he establishes a price-fixing conspiracy 
between the manufacturer and the middleman. See Arizona v. Shamrock Foods Co., 729 F.2d 1208, 1211 (9th Cir. 1984). 
Appellants here have made no such allegation. "
1126,1," 324 U.S. at 299, 65 S. Ct. at 664; see also id. 324 U.S. at 299-300, 65 S. Ct. at 664-65 (""We therefore do not have here a case 
in which the Sherman Act is applied to defeat the policy of the state. That would raise questions of moment which need not be 
decided until they are presented""); 324 U.S. at 301-02, 65 S. Ct. at 666 (Frankfurter, J., concurring). "
1127,2," The Court notes in this connection that House Concurrent Resolution No. 191 from the 2007 Regular Session was entered into 
the record, recognizing, among other things, Louisiana's ""substantial interest in exercising its powers and the powers delegated 
to the state by the Twenty-First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and in regulating the structure of the state's 
alcoholic beverage industry, including the activities of manufacturers, importers, wholesalers, retailers, and e-commerce 
merchants, the method by which alcoholic beverages are marketed, and influences that affect consumption levels of beverage 
alcohol by the people of the state."""
1127,3," A similar analysis is found in the concurring opinion in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 72 S. Ct. 863, 
96 L. Ed. 1153, 62 Ohio Law Abs. 417 (1952), wherein Justice Jackson proposed three categories by which to assess an 
assertion of power by one arm of government in tension with the power of another arm of government."
1127,4," See also 324 U.S. at 301, 65 S. Ct. at 665 (Frankfurter, J., concurring) (""if a State authorized the transactions here complained 
of, the Sherman Law could not override such exercise of state power""). "
1128,5," Indeed, if the Sherman Act is not understood to ""yield,"" the continued application of the Act under the circumstances of this 
case would result in a violation of the United States Constitution. If, because of the application of the Sherman Act, ""intoxicating 
liquors"" would be transported or imported into Louisiana ""for delivery or use therein"" ""in violation"" of her laws (i.e., the six bans 
challenged here), U.S. CONST. amend. XXI, § 2, a 21st Amendment violation would result. Of course, this Court may not issue 
Plaintiffs' requested declaratory and injunctive relief if it would result in unconstitutional transportation and importation into 
Louisiana."
1128,6," Duffy, 479 U.S. at 346, 107 S. Ct. at 727;  [**19] Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U.S. at 108, 100 S. Ct. at 945. "
1129,7," In other ways as well, Congress has evinced an intention to leave the States alone in this regard and, further, to respect their 
regulatory authority in this area. When establishing its own regulation of alcoholic beverages in 1935, Congress provided an 
exemption for the States: ""The provisions of subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section shall not apply to any act done by an 
 [**22] agency of a State or political subdivision thereof, or by any officer or employee of such agency."" 27 U.S.C. § 205. 
Similarly, in the case of malt beverages, the Federal provisions would apply only if a State had adopted parallel provisions. E.g., 
27 U.S.C. § 205 (""In the case of malt beverages, the provisions of subsections (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section shall apply to 
transactions between a retailer or trade buyer in any State and a brewer, importer, or wholesaler of malt beverages outside such 
Stately to the extent that the law of such State imposes similar requirements with respect to similar transactions between a 
retailer or trade buyer in such State and a brewer, importer, or wholesaler of malt beverages in such State, as the case may 
be""). More recent Congressional enactments have continued to show respect for the States' authority in this area. See generally 27 
U.S.C. §§ 122a & 122b (21st Amendment Enforcement Act left intact States' authority over alcoholic beverage distribution within 
their boundaries while providing them injunctive remedy against violators); 42 U.S.C. § 290bb-25b(b)(7)(""Alcohol is a unique 
product and should be regulated differently than other products  [**23] by the States and Federal Government. States have 
primary authority to regulate alcohol distribution and sale, and the Federal Government should support and supplement these 
State efforts. States also have a responsibility to fight youth access to alcohol and reduce underage drinking. Continued State 
regulation and licensing of the manufacture, importation, sale, distribution, transportation and storage of alcoholic beverages are

persons under 21 years of age from commercial and non-commercial sources, maintaining industry integrity and an orderly 
marketplace, and furthering effective State tax collection"")."
1129,8," ""In the frankfort Distilleries case, Justice Frankfurter suggested yet another way to reconcile the Sherman Act with post-21st 
Amendment State regulation of alcoholic beverages. Noting that the Sherman Act has long been interpreted as prohibiting 
unreasonable restraints of trade, he suggested that conduct in conformity with State policy on alcoholic beverages ""could not be 
deemed an 'unreasonable' restraint of interstate commerce."" frankfort Distilleries, 324 U.S. at 302, 65 S. Ct. at 665 
 [**24] (Frankfurter, J., concurring). "
1130,9," For the particular combination of a first-tier Commerce Clause claim and a core-concern 21st Amendment interest, the 
Bainbridge court proposed the following: ""When such a concern is implicated, the Amendment removes the constitutional cloud 
from the challenged law so long as the state demonstrates that it genuinely needs the law to effectuate its proffered core 
concern."" Bainbridge, 311 F.3d at 1112; see also id. at 1114 & n.17 (""This  [**29] does not mean, however, that the State can 
prevail without evidence supporting a genuine need for its discriminatory laws. Not only must the State raise a 'core concern,' but 
it must also show that its statutory scheme genuinely needed to effectuate the proffered core concern""; ""This evidentiary 
standard is far less than the strict scrutiny required under a traditional tier-one analysis of discriminatory laws. For example, the 
State need not show that there are no nondiscriminatory alternatives available"" (tendential quotation marks in the Bainbridge 
original, footnote omitted)). "
1132,10," E.g., Painter Aff. P 35 (""Second, the ban on volume discounts is a moderate indirect device by which to control prices. Volume 
discounts by their very nature encourage retailers to buy ever larger quantities. Large quantities of alcoholic beverages in turn 
encourage increased sales. Economic pressures on the retailer to unload large quantities of product, in turn, encourage reduced 
prices to the consumer. Further, if competing retailers find themselves each with large quantities of product to unload on the 
market, there is great potential for price wars to break out""); see also id. PP 35A, 36, 36A, 36B, 36E, 36G, 41, 59, 60, 66, 68, 69,

1132,11," In the particular case of volume discounts, there is an additional threat to the temperance  [**36] goal of moderate 
consumption as ""volume discounts by their very nature, invite purchase by the retailer of ever greater quantities. In order to 
remain solvent, the retailer must unload these quantities on the market, leading to ever increasing sales volume. In order to 
accomplish this, in practice, the retailer must offer deep price cuts to the consumer. Indeed, the price cut the retailer received 
from its seller makes it possible for the retailer, in turn, to offer price cuts to the consumer."" Painter Aff. P 36. "
1133,12," The delivered-pricing requirement, the ban on central warehousing by retailers, and the ban on the provision of distribution 
services generally by retailers. "
1134,13," Congress has made a similar policy choice in its own regulation of the alcoholic beverage industry with the enactment of the 
Federal Alcohol Administration Act. See S. Rep. No. 1215, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. 6-7 (1935) (justifying regulation of trade 
practices, including the inducement prohibition, to prevent ""monopoly,"" among other evils); see also Black, 355 U.S. at 25, 78 S. 
Ct. at 108 (""One aim of Congress by the present legislation was to prohibit practices that were 'analogous to those prohibited by 
the antitrust laws'"" (citation omitted)). "
1135,14," Judge  [**48] Luttig, of the Fourth Circuit, contended that the Supreme Court in Duffy ""misunderstood its own prior precedents"" 
in ""holding that the regulation . . . constituted a so-called hybrid restraint."" TFWS, Inc. v. Schaefer, 242 F.3d 198, 213 (4th Cir. 
2001) (Luttig. J., concurring). Judge Luttig argued that the statute and regulations at issue in Duffy should instead have been 
considered unilateral state action and upheld as exempt from the Sherman Act Id. Luttig pointed out that ""there can be no liability 
under § 1 [of the Sherman Act] without an agreement"" Id. (alteration original). He described hybrid action cases as cases in "
1136,," which ""private parties independently reached pricing agreements, which the state then authorized and enforced."" Id. at 214. 
Where there is no showing of ""voluntary agreement, independently reached, between private parties that is either authorized or 
enforced by the state,"" an essential element is absent, and accordingly, there can be no Section 1 violation. Id."

same position as the state legislature and supreme court for purposes of the state-action doctrine."" Hoover, 466 U.S. at 568 
n.17, 104 S. Ct. at 1995 n.17. "
1137,16, This provision is the subject of Plaintiffs' final two challenges and is separately discussed below.
1137,17, This statute creates an exception for microbreweries. Louisiana Revised Statutes § 26:271.1.
1137,18," This statute was repealed effective June 30, 2006."
1137,19," The Frankfort Distilleries case, as it concerned the issue of interstate commerce, is to be distinguished. In that case, there was 
a conspiracy to fix prices at the retail  [**54] level, but the conspiracy chose as is means putting upstream pressure on 
wholesalers and ultimately the out-of-state suppliers or alcoholic beverages. 324 U.S. at 298, 65 S. Ct. at 664 (""The combination 
concerned itself with the type of contract used in making interstate sales; Its coercive power was used to compel the producers 
of alcoholic beverages outside of Colorado to enter into price maintenance contracts. Nor did the boycott used merely affect 
local retail business. Local purchasing power was the weapon used to force producers making interstate sales to fix prices 
against their will. It may be true, as has been argued, that under Colorado law, retailers are prohibited from buying from out-of-
state producers, but this fact has no relevancy. The power of retailers to coerce out-of-state producers can be just as effectively 
exercised through pressure brought to bear upon wholesalers as though the retailers brought such pressure to bear directly 
upon the producers. And combinations to restrain, by a boycott of those engaged in interstate commerce, through such indirect 
coercion is prohibited by the Sherman Act""); see also, e.g., Frankfort Distilleries v. United States, 144 F.2d 824, 827  [**55] (""that 
the defendants Wholesale Association and Package Association, wholesalers, and retailers agree upon and undertake to 
persuade, induce, and compel producers, including the defendant producers, and wholesalers, to enter into fair trade contracts 
affecting every type and brand of alcoholic beverage shipped into Colorado"") (reversed by 324 U.S. 293, 65 S. Ct. 661, 89 L. Ed. 
951). Here, by contrast, the conspiracy, to the extent Plaintiffs even address this element, is at most a conspiracy at the in-state 
wholesale level designed to put downstream pressure on in-state retailers, all of whose sales terminate, as noted, with end-use 
in-state customers. "
1138,20," Additional support for this understanding is found in the recent Granholm case as well as the ratification history of the 21st 
Amendment. In Granholm, when weighing the Commerce Clause and the 21st Amendment, the Court concentrated upon 
protecting out-of-state product from discriminatory treatment. It was the out-of-state origin of the product, and the discrimination 
against that product, that triggered the protection of the Commerce Clause. Eg., Granholm, 544 U.S. at 489, 125 S. Ct. at 1905 
(""State policies are protected under the Twenty-first Amendment when they treat liquor produced out of state the same as its 
domestic equivalent""). The ratification history of the 21st Amendment by contrast is concerned with investing each State with 
plenary power to regulate the distribution and sale thereafter of all alcoholic beverages within the State, regardless of origin and 
with no discussion of authorizing discrimination against out-of-state product. See Painter Aff. PP 2-22."
1138,21," The ban on direct shipping to consumers by retailers domiciled inside Louisiana and the ban on direct shipping to consumers 
in prohibition territory by retailers domiciled inside Louisiana. "
1139,22," Accord Brooks, 462 F.3d at 354 (""the dormant Commerce Clause only prevents  [**60] a State from enacting regulation that 
favors in-state producers and thus discriminates against interstate commerce"" (emphasis original)). "
1147,1," Wellbutrin SR is a sustained release drug using the active ingredient bupropion hydrochloride. Defendant markets Wellbutrin 
SR in 100mg, 150mg, and 200mg dosage strengths. The 200mg dosage strength is not at issue in this case."
1147,2," This Memorandum contains only an abbreviated version of the facts relevant to the instant Motion. For a more detailed 
recitation of the background facts and allegations against Defendant, see In re Wellbutrin SR Antitrust Litigation, 2006 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 9687 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 9, 2006)."
1147,3," In  [*4] a related action (civil no. 04-5898), the ""end-payor plaintiffs"" make the same allegations against Defendant. The end-
payor plaintiffs are the persons last in the chain of distribution and include consumers, health care benefit plans, health 
maintenance organizations, health insurers, hospitals, nursing homes, and self-insured employers. The end-payor plaintiffs have 
also filed a motion for class certification, which will be addressed in a separate memorandum and order. A third action (civil no. 
05-396) involves a ""third-party payor"" making the same allegations against Defendant. That action has not been brought on 
behalf of a class."
1147,4," Earlier in this litigation, Defendant moved to dismiss claims in the various complaints. On March 9, 2006, the Court issued a 
Memorandum and Order dismissing without prejudice the claims of fraudulent prosecution of a patent and the claims seeking 
injunctive relief pursuant to the Clayton Antitrust Act. The Court denied Defendant's motions to dismiss in all other respects."
1147,5," As explained infra, the Named Plaintiffs are assignees of direct purchasers and seek to represent the Direct Purchaser Plaintiff 
class. For the purposes of this Memorandum and Order,  [*5] the ""Named Plaintiffs"" shall be referred to as the ""Direct Purchaser 
Plaintiffs,"" and the Motion for Class Certification shall be referred to as the ""Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs' Motion"" or the ""Motion."" "
1148,6," Because the Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs seek certification under Rule 23(b)(3), the Court will confine its analysis to that standard 
and will not consider whether the proposed class meets the requirements of Rule 23(b)(1) or (b)(2)."
1148,7," As explained in the Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint, generic bupropion entered the market in January 2004. 
The Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs allege  [*8] that the class period begins on January 24, 2002, the date on which generic entry 
would have occurred but for Defendant's allegedly anticompetitive conduct. They allege that the class period ends on June 30, 
2006, the date on which prices stabilized at competitive levels."
1148,8," Defendant also manufactures Zyban, which is the chemical equivalent of Wellbutrin SR. Defendant assigned the drug two 
different names for marketing purposes: Wellbutrin SR is marketed to treat depression, whereas Zyban is marketed to aid in 
smoking cessation. Although the Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs' Original Complaint and Consolidated Amended Class Action 
Complaint refer to both Zyban and Wellbutrin SR, they seek class certification only for direct purchasers of Wellbutrin SR. "
1149,9," Although Defendant does not argue that the typicality requirement is not met, several of its challenges to the adequacy of 
representation factor also relate to typicality. To the extent that the issues overlap, the Court will consider Defendant's 
arguments together in Section III.A.4, infra. "
1150,10," Defendant cites a number of cases to support the unremarkable proposition that a named plaintiff must be a member of the 
class which it purports to represent. The only case supporting the specific  [*18] theory it articulates here--that an assignee is, by 
definition, unable to represent a class--has, after Defendant filed its response to the Motion, been rejected by the Second Circuit. 
In re Pub. Offering Fee Antitrust Litig., 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21076 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 18, 2006), rev'd sub nom. Cordes & Co. Fin. 
Servs. v. A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc., 502 F.3d 91, 103 (2d Cir. 2007) (""We conclude that Cordes and Creditors Trust, pursuing 
their claims and interests as assignees of the claims brought by, and interests in this litigation of, purported members of the "
1151,," class seeking to act as class representatives, are not excluded, for that reason alone.""). While the Second Circuit did not hold 
that an assignee will be an adequate representative in all instances, it did reject the per se rule Defendant articulates here."
1151,11," While some of the above-cited cases discuss the assignee issue under the typicality prong of the Rule 23 analysis, the point is 
the same: an assignee steps into the shoes of the assignor and may assert any legal claim assigned to it. Whether framed as a 
question of the typicality of the right being litigated or the adequacy of the assignee to litigate the right on behalf of  [*19] others, 
courts consistently have rejected the notion that an assignee is categorically inadequate as a lead plaintiff."
1151,12," Under  [*21] Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1971), HN11[
] an indirect purchaser 
cannot bring a damages claim under federal law based on an alleged antitrust violation. Accordingly, if the assignment is invalid, 
SAJ cannot bring the current federal claim. Absent the assignment, it is an indirect purchaser without standing to pursue the 
claim."
1151,13," This particular argument also relates to the ""typicality"" prong of the Rule 23 analysis. The Third Circuit has recognized that the 
""unique defense"" challenge goes to both the typicality and the adequacy prongs, and the Court will consider both aspects of the 
argument here. See Beck, 457 F.3d at 296. "
1152,14," HN12[
] As a rule, ""courts are generally skeptical of defenses to class certification based on conflicts between the proposed 
class members."" In re Bulk [Extruded] Graphite Prods. Antitrust Litig., 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16619, at *24 (D.N.J. Apr. 4, 2006). 
Courts maintain this skepticism because a defendant makes the ""conflicts"" argument in the guise of ensuring adequate 
representation for the class, where in reality, the defendant seeks to avoid class certification altogether. See, e.g., Umbriac v. 
Am. Snacks, Inc., 388 F. Supp. 265, 275 (E.D. Pa. 1975) (""It is in the nature of the motion practice on class determination issues 
that defendants, who naturally have no interest in the successful prosecution of the class suit against them, are called 
 [*23] upon to interpose arguments in opposition to class determination motions verbally grounded upon a concern for the 'best' 
representation for the class while the implicit, but nonetheless real, objective of their vigorous legal assaults is to insure 'no' 
representation for the class."")."
1152,15," In Valley Drug, the Eleventh Circuit recognized that Hanover Shoe and Illinois Brick ""stand for the proposition that a direct 
purchaser who passes on overcharges to his own customers nevertheless suffers cognizable antitrust injury and may sue to "
1153,," recover damages regardless of whether he actually profited from the defendants' conduct."" 350 F.3d at 1192. The Eleventh 
Circuit distinguished these cases, explaining that ""the question [they] address is a distinctly separate question from the issue of 
whether class certification is appropriate where a fundamental conflict exists among the named and unnamed members of a 
class."" Id. As explained above, however, Hanover Shoe and Illinois Brick eliminate any ""fundamental conflict"" between the class 
members."
1153,16," In a case that predates Valley Drug, the court in J.B.D.L. Corp. v. Wyeth-Averst Laboratories, Inc., 225 F.R.D. 208, 216 (S.D. 
Ohio 2003), rejected the argument that downstream economic effects of antitrust injury can create a fundamental class conflict. 
In J.B.D.L., the defendant argued that ""there is a conflict between the class representatives and some class members because 
some class members purchased large quantities of Premarin and were able to resell it at a greater profit after price increases."" 
The court found this ""conflict"" argument meritless because ""[a]ntitrust injury is considered complete when the direct purchaser 
pays an illegal overcharge and whether he was able to pass through the overcharge to indirect purchasers is irrelevant to the 
inquiry."" Id. As the court explained, ""as long as the price paid by the class members for Premarin was higher than it would have 
been absent the alleged anticompetitive conduct, there is no conflict created if indeed some of the direct purchasers were able to 
recoup the overcharge through price increases passed on to other purchasers."" Id."
1153,17," With no comparable evidence before it, the Valley Drug court suggested that the national wholesalers may have  [*30] been 
reluctant to oppose the alleged anticompetitive conduct out of economic self-interest. See 350 F.3d at 1193 (""[T]he profits 
received by some class members from selling branded Hytrin in the absence of generic competition, and the greater volume of 
Hytrin sold by these parties in the absence of generic competition, may suggest a tradeoff the national wholesalers were content 
to make in order to experience greater profits.""). Because the national wholesalers have represented that they support this 
litigation, the Court need not engage in the same speculation. "
1154,18," HN14[
] If, at any point during the litigation, an actual conflict between class members does arise, the Court retains the ability to divide the class into subclasses pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(c)(5). Moreover, class members who do not 
wish to participate in the class litigation may opt out of the class altogether. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(B); see also 
Natchitoches Parish Hosp. Serv. Dist. v. Tyco Int'l, Ltd., 247 F.R.D. 253, 268-69 (D. Mass. 2008) (""[S]hould any fundamental 
conflict arise, a ready mechanism exists to protect it--the opt-out provision. . . . Sophisticated players such as distributors and 
large  [*31] hospitals can determine for themselves whether a fundamental conflict exists within the class.""). "
1155,19," Dr. French explains that as the result of Defendant's monopoly, the entire class was injured because class members were (a) 
unable to purchase lower-price generic alternatives and/or (b) forced to pay artificially high prices for brand name Wellbutrin SR. 
See French Aff. P 40."
1155,20," In a number of other delayed generic entry cases, courts have approved the use of the same types of evidence the Direct 
Purchaser Plaintiffs rely on here to show common impact. See, e.g., Relafen, 218 F.R.D. at 343 (finding predominance met 
where the direct purchasers relied on  [*36] ""governmental and academic studies, projections and analyses described in 
SmithKline's and its competitors' internal documents, and price and sales data for Relafen and its generic equivalents""); In re 
Cardizem, 200 F.R.D. at 308 (approving the use of generalized evidence, including academic studies, the defendants' internal 
sales documents, and marketplace sales data, to prove common impact). "
1156,21," This finding of predominance is consistent with the findings of other courts in which plaintiffs have alleged antitrust injuries 
resulting from the delayed entry of generic drug competitors. See, e.g., In re Nifedipine, 246 F.R.D. at 369-71; Meijer, Inc., 246 
F.R.D. at 307-12; In re Relafen, 218 F.R.D. at 343-46; In re Buspirone, 210 F.R.D. at 58; In re Cardizem, 200 F.R.D. at 307-25. "
1164,1," Nic J. Eichenseer, Brian Dougherty, and Eric B. Stener filed their complaint in Dane County Circuit Court as parties and 
representatives of a class of persons who patronize the 24 Madison taverns after 8 p.m. on Friday and/or Saturday nights. Nic J. 
Eichenseer elected not to appeal  [****3] the circuit court's decision. Only Dougherty and Stener are participating in this appeal.

1165,5," Problem drinking, related crimes, and related injuries plague college campuses across the United States. A March 2007 report 
by The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) at Columbia University found: From 1993 to 2005, there has been no significant reduction in the levels of drinking and binge drinking among college 
students. In 2005, 67.9 percent of students (approximately 5.3 million students) reported drinking in the past month and 
40.1 percent (approximately 3.1 million students) reported binge drinking.* However, from 1993 to 2001 rates of 
 [****7] riskier drinking--frequent binge drinking, being intoxicated, drinking to get drunk--have increased. . . . . Between 1993 and 2001, there has been a 37.6 percent increase in the proportion of college students hurt or injured as a 
result of their alcohol use (9.3 percent vs. 12.8 percent). In 2001, 1,717 college students died from unintentional alcohol-
related injuries--up six percent from 1998. . . . . The average number of alcohol-related arrests per campus increased 21 percent between 2001 and 2005. In 2005, alcohol-
related arrests constituted 83 percent of campus arrests. "

1166,6," The ""Luther's Blues conditions,"" requested by the University and imposed by the City, include the following: . Not to increase the volume contained in a serving without increasing proportionately the price charged for such serving. . Not to give away any drink or sell at a price that is different from the usual price for the drink for any period of time less 
than one full week. . Not to give away any drink or reduce the price of any drink conditioned upon the purchase of any drink or number of 
drinks. . Not to sell or give away an unlimited number of drinks during a set period of  [****9] time for a fixed price."
1166,7," The record indicates that the following new licensees were subject to the ""Luther's Blues conditions"": Hawk's, Crave, Dotty 
Dumpling's, Kimia Lounge, and Nam's Noodles."
1166,8," The City of Madison, Wisconsin Code of Ordinances provides that an application for a Class B liquor license (which authorizes 
retail sales of intoxicating liquor for consumption on the premises licensed) must be filed with the City Clerk before it is referred 
to the Common Council for ultimate approval. Madison, Wis., Code §§ 38.03(2)(b), 38.05(3)(a), 38.05(11) (2007). However, 
 [****10] before Council approval, the City Clerk must refer the application to the Alcohol License Review Committee (ALRC), 
which conducts an ""investigation as to the advisability of granting such license"" and then makes ""a recommendation to the 
Common Council as to whether or not such application should be granted."" Id., § 38.05(3)(a)11. The City Clerk must also give notice of the application to the Director of the Neighborhood Preservation and Inspection Division, 
the Chief of the Police Department, the Chief of the Fire Department, and the Director of Public Health, all of whom inspect the 
premises sought to be licensed and report to the Common Council in writing. Id. The City Clerk must schedule public hearings 
before the ALRC and Common Council before a Class B license is granted. Id., § 38.05(3)(e). The ALRC, through its recommendations, clearly influences the Common Council's decision to grant or deny a license. In this 
case, ALRC Chair Bruer and Alder Verveer, who represented the campus area, influenced the ""Luther's Blues conditions"" placed 
upon new and existing licensees in the downtown campus area. "
1167,9, The draft ordinance stated:

shall: (a) Not increase the volume contained in a serving without increasing proportionately the price charged for such serving. (b) Not give away any drink or sell at a price that is different from the usual price for the drink for any period of time less 
than one full week. (c) Not give away any drink or reduce the price of any drink conditioned upon the purchase of any drink or number of 
drinks. (d) Not sell or give away an unlimited number of drinks during a set period of time for  [****13] a fixed price. (e) Not advertise in any manner the availability, pricing or dispensing of drinks or alcohol in a manner to lead a reasonably 
prudent person to conclude that alcohol is available contrary to paragraphs a.-d. above. "
1168,10," These reported statements of ALRC Chair Bruer were cited by the circuit court as ""verbal acts"" and not regarded for their truth. 
As such, the statements were considered by the circuit court on the parties' motions for summary judgment. "
1169,11," An ordinance banning smoking in Madison taverns went into effect on May 11, 2004."
1169,12," The following is an excerpt from this press release: The Down Town Tavern Working Group (DTWG) is sponsored by the Dane County Tavern League and consists of the 
majority of taverns and restaurants with alcohol service in the University Avenue/State Street Corridor as well as the local 
[b]eer wholesalers. The DTWG was formed to provide a proactive and substantive response to the hysteria surrounding 
student  [****21] drinking habits, and the regulatory proposals that have been directed at campus area taverns. Following 
are our proposals for dealing with some of the issues being raised time and time again by the University and City. "
1170,," Drink Specials: It is the position of the DTWG that there is no statistically significant correlation between the existence of [d]rink [s]pecials 
and disorderly behavior. The truly significant drink specials exist on weeknights when disorderly behavior is minimal. . . . . . . [M]ost of the downtown taverns . . . have voluntarily agreed to eliminate late night drink specials on Friday and Saturday 
nights beginning September 20, 2002 and continuing for at least the next year. We have our reservations about engaging in 
what could be considered illegal ""collusion in restraint of trade"", but we feel this proactive position can cut through the fog 
and confusion surrounding the role of drink specials and disorderly behavior."

specified in s. 939.50(3)(h), the person may be fined not more than $ 100,000 if a corporation, or, if any other person, may 
be fined not more than $ 50,000."
1172,17," The court of appeals adopted the label ""implied repeal doctrine,"" which was used by the parties throughout their briefs, to 
describe the antitrust immunity doctrine of Town of Hallie v. City of Chippewa Falls, 105 Wis. 2d 533, 314 N.W.2d 321 (1982) "
1173,," (Hallie I). See Eichenseer v. Madison-Dane County Tavern League, Inc., 2006 WI App 226, P8, 297 Wis. 2d 495, 725 N.W.2d 
274.  [****32] We also adopt this label."
1173,18," Wisconsin Stat. § 62.11(5), both the 1979-80 and 2005-06 versions, provides: Powers. Except as elsewhere in the statutes specifically provided, the council shall have the management and control of 
the city property, finances, highways, navigable waters, and the public service, and shall have power to act for the 
government and good order of the city, for its commercial benefit, and for the health, safety, and welfare of the public, and 
may carry out its powers by license, regulation, suppression, borrowing of money, tax levy, appropriation, fine, 
imprisonment, confiscation, and other necessary or convenient means. The powers hereby conferred shall be in addition to 
all other grants, and shall be limited only by express language."
1173,19," Article XI, Section 3 of the Wisconsin Constitution provides in part: "
1174,," (1) Cities and villages organized pursuant to state law may determine their local affairs and government, subject only to this 
 [****36] constitution and to such enactments of the legislature of statewide concern as with uniformity shall affect every city 
or every village. The method of such determination shall be prescribed by the legislature. "
1175,20," Our analysis  [****40] of the Hallie I factors will proceed in a different order (i.e., first factor, third factor, second factor) from the 
order established by the Hallie I court. This reordering is intentional, to emphasize the impact that the second Hallie I factor, ""the 
type of conduct undertaken by a city in a particular instance,"" has on our ultimate conclusion. "
1176,21," The lengthy quote from Odelberg v. City of Kenosha, 20 Wis. 2d 346, 122 N.W.2d 435 (1963), appears at P15 of the court of 
appeals decision in this case. Eichenseer, 2006 WI App 226, 297 Wis. 2d 495, P15, 725 N.W.2d 274. "
1177,22," A case in point is the Village of Ephraim in Door County. Ephraim is the only municipality in Wisconsin that has chosen to go 
""dry""--alcohol is not allowed to be sold in the Village. A statement from the Village's website proudly proclaims: We're the only community in all of Wisconsin that is dry. There have been two referendums to ask the citizens if they 
wanted liquor allowed to be sold within the Village--in 1934 and in 1992--59% voted no in 1934, 74% voted no in 1992.

1178,23," See Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 63 S. Ct. 307, 87 L. Ed. 315 (1943). As the court of appeals noted, the conceptual 
underpinnings of the federal ""state action"" doctrine differ from those of the implied repeal doctrine. Eichenseer, 2006 WI App 
226, 297 Wis. 2d 495, P19 n.9, 725 N.W.2d 274. We have previously stated that Wis. Stat. § 133.01 was intended as a reenactment of the first two sections of the federal 
Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1 and 2. See Conley Publ'g Group Ltd. v. Journal Commc'ns, Inc., 2003 WI 119, 
P18, 265 Wis. 2d 128, 665 N.W.2d 879  [****53] (citation omitted). The question of what acts constitute a combination or 
conspiracy in restraint of trade under the Sherman Act is controlled by federal court decisions. Federal decisions construing 
federal exemptions under the Sherman Act are thus persuasive authority in construing state exemptions under Wisconsin 
antitrust law. "
1180,24," After the circuit court dismissed the plaintiffs' suit, Alder Mike Verveer commented that if the result had been different, campus 
taverns would have faced ""seven-day-a-week drink-special bans."" He added: ""This  [****60] [lawsuit] already affected their 
livelihoods, and if it had been successful, a lot of 'Ma and Pa' operations would have gone out of business."" Megan Costello,

1183,25," Nobody in this case argues that the City or any municipal actors violated any antitrust law, despite the implication to the 
contrary created by the majority opinion's primary focus on the applicability of antitrust laws to municipalities. "
1184,26," Another doctrine which the majority incorrectly describes in passing is the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. The majority seems to 
suggest, without so holding or deciding the issue, that this doctrine might provide another possible source of immunity for the 
defendants by virtue of their actions being ""wholly defensive,"" despite those actions going beyond mere petitioning the 
government. See majority op., PP90-100. It seems that the majority fails to grasp that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine does not 
extend beyond petitioning, i.e., allowing individuals to lobby legislators for the passage of anticompetitive legislation. See United 
Mine Workers of Am. v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 669, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965); E. R.R. Presidents Conf. v. 
Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 138, 140, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961); Am. Med. Transp. v. Curtis-Universal, 
Inc., 154 Wis. 2d 135, 154-55, 452 N.W.2d 575 (1990)(AMT). The doctrine has never been applied to allow individuals to 
actually participate in anticompetitive conduct beyond the mere exercise of free speech rights in advocating for legislation; 
 [****75] as this court explained in AMT: The court of appeals correctly stated the applicable law when it said that the ""Noerr-Pennington doctrine . . . protects 
advocacy and not participation."" Airport Car Rental Antitrust Litigation, 521 F. Supp. 568, 584 (N.D. Cal. 1981), aff'd 693 F.2d 84 (9th Cir. 1982), capsulized 
the limits of the Noerr-Pennington doctrine when it stated: Private parties attempting to influence public officials to engage in commercial activities which may later be found to 
violate the antitrust law do not thereby become themselves liable. For liability to be imposed upon them, they must be 
participants in the scheme. Thus, it is clear that, if a scheme or enterprise that has been merely petitioned or lobbied for by private persons is found to 
violate antitrust laws, liability will not be imposed on those private persons for that conduct alone. See, P. Areeda, H. 
Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law, para. 201, p. 21 (Supp. 1989). "
1185,," There have been no cases brought to our attention or which we have discovered in the course of this court's research 
where a private party who has participated in an anticompetitive scheme is exonerated by Noerr-Pennington. This absence 
of authority fully accords  [****76] with the basic premise of Noerr-Pennington--to protect the citizens' right to free speech 
and to petition government. It goes no further than that. AMT, 154 Wis. 2d at 154-55 (emphasis added). The majority quotes AMT out of context to arrive at a description of Noe rr-
Pennington which utterly contradicts the above AMT passage. Compare majority op., PP93-99 with above quotation from AMT, 
154 Wis. 2d at 154-55."
1185,27," See majority op., P2 (""The defendants contend that their conduct is immune from Wisconsin antitrust law under: (1) the so-
called 'implied repeal doctrine' articulated in Town of Hallie v. City of Chippewa Falls, 105 Wis. 2d 533, 314 N.W.2d 321 (1982) 
(Hallie I) . . . ""). "
1186,28," See, e.g., State v. Black, 188 Wis. 2d 639, 645, 526 N.W.2d 132 (1994) (holding that passage of statute imposing restrictions 
on abortion did not impliedly repeal feticide statute, explaining ""[n]othing persuades us that the legislature intended to impliedly 
repeal sec. 940.04(2)(a) when it enacted sec. 940.15. Implied repeal of statutes by later enactments is not favored in statutory 
construction.""); State v. Zawistowski, 95 Wis. 2d 250, 264, 290 N.W.2d 303 (1980)(""Implied repeal of statutes by later 
enactments is not favored in statutory construction. All statutes passed and retained by the legislature should be held valid 
unless the earlier statute is completely repugnant to the later enactment.""); Milwaukee Fed'n of Teachers, Local No. 252 v. 
WERC, 83 Wis. 2d 588, 599, 266 N.W.2d 314 (1978)(""'[A]s to changing statutory law, there is a presumption against the implied 
repeal or amendment of any existing statutory provision.'""); Jicha v. Karns, 39 Wis. 2d 676, 680, 159 N.W.2d 691 (1968)(holding 
 [****82] that the argument that a later statute superceded an earlier statute ""would prevail if the two statutes were in conflict and 
could not be reconciled. However, repeal or amendment by implication is not favored if they can be reconciled.""); Burris v. Karns, 
14 Wis. 2d 431, 436, 111 N.W.2d 509 (1961)(""[I]n Wisconsin the doctrine of implied repeal is not favored. In Milwaukee County 
v. Milwaukee Western Fuel Co., 204 Wis. 107, 112, 235 N.W. 545, 547 (1931), we held that 'an earlier act will be considered to 
remain in force unless it is so manifestly inconsistent and repugnant to the later act that they cannot reasonably stand 
together.'""); State ex rel. Peterson v. County Court of Clark County, 13 Wis. 2d 37, 40-41, 108 N.W.2d 146 (1961)(""[I]t is 
fundamental that implied repeals are not favored and an earlier act will be considered to remain in force if the same may be 
construed in harmony with the later one. This principle is well established.""); Union Cemetery v. City of Milwaukee, 13 Wis. 2d 
64, 71, 108 N.W.2d 180 (1961)(""Repeals by implication are not favored in the law. The earlier act will be considered to remain in 
force unless it is so manifestly inconsistent and repugnant to the  [****83] later act that they cannot reasonably stand together.""). "
1187,29," It is worth emphasizing that were Hallie I actually an ""implied repeal"" case, a completely different legislative intent test would 
apply. In implied repeal cases, the party seeking to have a statute repealed must show that, in enacting a conflicting 
 [****88] statute, the legislature intended to have that statute repealed. Kienbaum v. Haberny, 273 Wis. 413, 420, 78 N.W.2d 888 
(1956). Such a hurdle could clearly not be passed in this case, as the majority cites no statute indicating any legislative intent to 
repeal Wisconsin's antitrust laws in whole or in part "
1189,30," Wisconsin Stat. § 125.10(1) provides: Authorization. Any municipality may enact regulations incorporating any part of this chapter and may prescribe additional 
regulations for the sale of alcohol beverages, not in conflict with this chapter. The municipality may prescribe forfeitures or 
license suspension or revocation for violations of any such regulations. Regulations providing forfeitures or license 
suspension or revocation must be adopted by ordinance. (Emphasis added.)"
1189,31," Although the majority probably intends to describe only the defendants as acting in concert with each other in this passage, 
elsewhere the majority comes close to describing a similar type of collusion between the defendants and the City for the purpose 
of equating the defendants' conduct with municipal action. It is worth noting on that point that ""[i]n analogous contexts, the Court 
has held that an exempt entity forfeits antitrust exemption by acting in concert with nonexempt parties."" Group Life & Health Ins. 
Co. v. Royal Drug Co., 440 U.S. 205, 231, 99 S. Ct. 1067, 59 L. Ed. 2d 261 (1979). "
1190,32," The majority opinion echoes the tone of the defendants' argument that ""[t]he only wrinkle presented by this case is the City did 
not formalize its regulation in the form  [****97] of an ordinance."" In response, Eichenseer issued the following strong rebuke: 
""Whether or not a regulation is to be found in the written law may be considered a mere 'wrinkle' in certain totalitarian nations, 
but not in the United States."" I concur with this statement. "
1192,33," Having explained why the majority's failure to establish the requisite elements of the first prong of the state action test renders 
the test inapplicable, I will not address the ""active state supervision"" prong of the test. "
1198,1," The program's acronym SUPPORT stands for the Select Utilization of Providers for Prosthetic, Orthotic, and Rehabilitative 
Technology."
1198,2," DME includes ""oxygen-related equipment, beds, and walkers."" J.A. at 76 (Op. & Order Granting Summ. J. at 3)."
1198,3," The SUPPORT program does not apply to employees and retirees of Chrysler, Ford, and MPSERS ""who are enrolled in Blue 
Cross's health maintenance organization."" J.A. at 980 (William J. Lynk Aff. at P 13 n.16). The SUPPORT program ""applies only 
to members who are enrolled in Blue Cross's traditional open-choice, fee-for-service  [**5] coverage or in its preferred provider 
organization coverage."" Id."
1198,4," The district court remarked that it was ""exceedingly difficult . . . to meaningfully assess [B&H's] document requests to BCBSM, 
when [B&H] steadfastly refuses, even at this late date, to disclose its specific theories of recovery in this case"" and that B&H's 
""outstanding discovery requests to BCBSM seemingly have no bearing whatsoever on many of the issues presented in"" W&F's 
motion for summary judgment. J.A. at 64, 70 (Discovery Order at 5, 11). "
1200,5," In January 2006, the district court issued a second Opinion and Order relating to sanctions, setting the amount at $ 84,512.11 
after W&F submitted  [**12] its costs and Ryan contested certain of those costs. J.A. at 131-38 (Second Sanctions Op. & Order); 
see also B&H Med., L.L.C. v. ABP Admin., Inc., No. 02-73615, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2794, 2006 WL 123785 (E.D. Mich. Jan 
13, 2006)."
1200,6," In fact, the employees and retirees of the above-mentioned companies who have enrolled in BCBSM plans covered by the 
SUPPORT contract are able to purchase DME/P&O services from vendors, like B&H, that are not members of the SUPPORT 
network. Plan enrollees may purchase DME/P&O services outside the SUPPORT network subject to paying an ""out-of-network 
sanction."" J.A. at 80 (Op. & Order at 7)."
1200,7," The Statement of Issues Presented portion of B&H's brief did not include any reference to an argument that B&H showed 
antitrust injury and has antitrust standing, Appellant Br. at 2-3, and no such argument appeared anywhere in its opening brief. "
1202,8," In fact, in its initial Complaint, B&H did allege that W&F ""engaged in price fixing to deny B&H access to the relevant market,"" 
J.A. at 22 (Compl. at P 14), but it dropped this claim in its Amended Complaint and accordingly may not rely on that theory. See 
Drake v. City of Detroit, No. 06-1817, 266 Fed. Appx. 444, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 4224, 2008 WL 482283, at *2 (6th Cir. Feb. 
21, 2008) (stating that HN5[
] a prior ""complaint is a nullity, because an amended complaint supercedes all prior complaints""); 
see also 6 CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT, ARTHUR R. MILLER & MARY KAY KANE, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 
1476  [**22] (2d ed. 1990) (stating that ""[a] pleading that has been amended under Rule 15(a) supersedes the pleading it 
modifies"" and that ""[o]nce an amended pleading is interposed, the original pleading no longer performs any function in the 
case""). "
1203,9," Terming the SUPPORT program a ""provider-controlled contracting network,"" or ""PCN,"" B&H asserts that in ""an antitrust 
analysis of the Support PCN under Statement 9, the first question is whether the Support PCN should be analyzed as per se 
illegal or under the rule of reason."" Appellant Br. at 28. B&H then declares that ""the Support PCN is a cartel or a 'sham' network 
which is per se illegal because 'antitrust law condemns naked agreements among  [**24] competitors which fix prices or 
allocate markets.'"" Id. (quoting Statement 9, Health Care Enforcement Guidelines at 135). Finally, B&H argues that ""under a rule 
of reason analysis pursuant to Statements 8 and 9, the issues are four: (1) determine if the horizontal price fixing agreement is 
ancillary . . . ."" Appellant Br. at 32 (emphasis added). "
1205,10," Indeed, we have recently held that HN10[
] the absence of antitrust standing is an appropriate ground on which to dismiss a complaint for failing to state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure. NicSand, Inc. v. 3M Co., 507 F.3d 442, 449 (6th Cir. 2007) (en banc) (""[W]e not only may--but we must--reject claims 
under Rule 12(b)(6) when antitrust standing is missing.""). "
1208,1," In its Appendix in Response to Plaintiffs' Cross-Motion, Defendant submitted an Amended Vaughn Index, which modified its 
original Index in expanding the explanations of the justification of each exemption. References herein to the Vaughn Index 
should be interpreted to refer to the amended version. "
1209,2," No evidence was submitted that there was an express promise of confidentiality. Although DOJ provided evidence on its 
confidentiality policy (Chitwood Decl. P 9), there is no evidence that DOJ specifically discussed confidentiality with Stanley. "
1211,3," The Court notes that although it found that this document is exempt from production under FOIA, unlike the Records requested 
by CNA, a copy of this document should have been kept by Mr. Stanley's counsel and should have been produced in discovery 
in response to CNA's subpoena and the court's order in North Carolina. Documents within an attorney's files are discoverable as 
constructively possessed by the client."
1211,4," As of the date of this Order, hearing transcripts are generally not available on PACER. "
1212,5," The Court observes that it will very rarely be more efficient for a plaintiff to pursue documents filed in any court, or transcripts of 
proceedings therein, through FOIA, as opposed to going directly to the appropriate court clerk. See United States Dep't of 
Justice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749, 764, 109 S. Ct. 1468, 103 L. Ed. 2d 774 (1989) (noting that 
if the documents requested ""were freely available, there would no reason to invoke FOIA to obtain access to the information they 
contain.""). This is particularly true in a case such as the present one where there are a limited number of documents from only 
one matter in one particular court. "

1244,1," Ms. Healy and DCRA filed their motions on July 13, 2007 and August 3, 2007, respectively. After the Court granted Plaintiffs' 
request for additional time to respond to Ms. Healy's motion, Plaintiffs, through counsel, filed their response on September 20, 
2007 (Docket No. 85). Shortly thereafter, Mr. Sugarman, Plaintiffs' counsel, sought additional time in which to respond to 
DCRA's motion, and indicated to the Court that, due to significant and irreversible personal health reasons, he intended to 
withdraw as counsel for the Plaintiffs. On October 10, 2007, the Court issued an Order (Docket No. 89) providing Plaintiffs with 
45 days to retain new counsel, plus 30 additional days to file a response to DCRA's motion and to submit any additional 
responses  [*3] to Ms. Healy's motion once Plaintiffs retained new counsel. Those 45 days elapsed without any communications with the Court by Plaintiffs or their counsel. Nevertheless, the Court 
continued to attempt to communicate with counsel for all parties to work out some accommodation to enable the Plaintiffs to 
respond fully (should they wish to do so) to the defense motions. On January 11, 2008, Mr. Sugarman sent a letter informing the 
Court that Plaintiffs were in contact with possible replacement counsel and that they hoped to have an update by January 15, 
2008. However, by January 25, 2008, Plaintiffs still had not obtained new counsel, and the Court did not receive any further 
communication from Mr. Sugarman. On that date, the Court issued an Order scheduling a telephone conference to discuss Mr. 
Sugarman's request to withdraw as counsel, Plaintiffs' attempts to obtain new counsel, and the outstanding defense motions. On February 8, 2008, the Court held a telephone conference with counsel during which Mr. Sugarman confirmed that he 
intended to promptly seek the Court's leave to withdraw as counsel. The Court again provided Plaintiffs with another 45 days to 
respond to the defense motions  [*4] or supplement their existing response, and to request leave to further amend their 
Amended Complaint. The Court ordered that if Plaintiffs failed to respond to the defense motions within those 45 days, the Court 
would rule on the defense motions on the basis of the docketed entries then presented. Subsequently, Mr. Sugarman formally moved to withdraw as counsel for Plaintiffs Taliaferro and Alexander, and on March 5, 
2008, the Court granted Mr. Sugarman's motion and permitted him to withdraw. Plaintiffs did not object. In its March 5 Order, the 
Court noted that because a portion of the additional 45-day period had elapsed, Plaintiffs then had until March 24, 2008 to 
respond to the defense motions or supplement their existing response. Again, the Court noted that if Plaintiffs failed to respond 
to the defense motions by March 24, the Court would rule on the defense motions on the basis of the docketed entries then 
presented. There was no request for any different or further accommodation. As of the date of this Memorandum, Plaintiffs have not informed the Court they have obtained replacement counsel, and no 
counsel has entered an appearance on Plaintiffs' behalf. Accordingly, Plaintiffs  [*5] are proceeding pro se. Plaintiffs have not 
filed a response to DCRA's motion, submitted any additional responses to Ms. Healy's motion, or sought leave to amend their 
Amended Complaint. Indeed, no communication at all has been received by the Court from or on behalf of Plaintiffs. Defendants 
continue to seek the Court's ruling on their long-pending motions. "
1245,2," Although, as explained below, many of the foregoing allegations have become moot as a result of the decision of the Third 
Circuit Court of Appeals in connection with an earlier appeal in this case, this recitation provides a useful context for the current 
discussion and decision."
1245,3," In addition to the DCRA and Ms. Healy, Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint alleged claims against the Darby Township Zoning 
Board, Darby Township, John Dougherty, Jesse Bryd-Estes, Lamont Jacobs, John J. O'Neill, William Ryan, John Ryan, the U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development (""HUD""), and certain individuals employed by HUD. On August 3, 2007, the 
Court granted an uncontested motion to dismiss filed by HUD and its officials."
1245,4," This count was dismissed as against Defendant Healy on September 22, 2004. "
1247,5," In Count I of the Amended Complaint Plaintiffs sought to enforce the terms of the redevelopment agreement, a claim that did 
include DCRA, but that claim is no longer viable. See Taliaferro, 458 F.3d at 191-92 & n.6 (affirming dismissal of this claim). In a 
footnote, the court of appeals affirmed dismissal of Plaintiffs' claim that the Defendants, including DCRA, breached the 
redevelopment agreement by stating the following: Further, any claim in the nature of a breach of contract regarding the condemnation of these Appellants' land surely would 
be barred by the statute of limitations, rendering appropriate  [*16] dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 
12(b)(6). Moreover, any claim that there was a breach of the Redevelopment Agreement cannot be sustained because the 
Appellants were not parties to the contract and because the terms of the contract expired in 1980. Any argument that Darby 
Township discouraged residential development of the Property and the [DCRA] acquiesced by failing to enforce the terms 
of the Redevelopment Agreement should have been raised long ago. Id. at 191 n.6. "
1248,6," The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that ""Congress shall make no law . . . abridging . . . the right of the people 
. . . to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."" U.S. Const, amend. I."
1248,7," In Bedell, the court of appeals described the two theories of immunity available under the Noerr-Pennington doctrine: Under the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, private parties may be immunized against liability stemming  [*19] from antitrust 
injuries flowing from valid petitioning. This includes two distinct types of actions. A petitioner may be immune from the 
antitrust injuries which result from the petitioning itself. See Noerr, 365 U.S. at 143 (finding trucking industry plaintiffs' 
relationships with their customers and the public were hurt by the railroads' petitioning activities, yet the railroads were 
immune from liability). Also, and particularly relevant here, parties are immune from liability arising from the antitrust injuries 
caused by government action which results from the petitioning. See Pennington, 381 U.S. at 671 (holding plaintiffs could 
not recover damages resulting from the state's actions); Mass. Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v. Am. Bar Assoc., 107 F.3d 
1026, 1037 (3d Cir. 1997) (holding Noerr gave immunity for any damages stemming from state adoption of requirements for 
bar admission to petitioners who lobbied for their adoption). Therefore, if its conduct constitutes valid petitioning, the 
petitioner is immune from antitrust liability whether or not the injuries are caused by the act of petitioning or are caused by 
government action which results from the petitioning. Bedell, 263 F.3d at 251  [*20] (fourth citation omitted). "
1249,8," In Noerr, the Supreme Court recognized what has come to be known as the ""sham"" exception to its rule, recognizing that 
""[t]here may be situations in which a publicity campaign, ostensibly directed toward influencing governmental action, is a mere 
sham to cover what is actually nothing more than an attempt to interfere directly with the business relationships of a competitor 
and the application of the Sherman Act would be justified."" 365 U.S. at 144. The Supreme Court has explained that this 
exception applies when ""persons use the governmental process -- as opposed to the outcome of that process -- as an 
anticompetitive weapon,"" Omni, 499 U.S. at 380. "
1250,9," The Gorman Towers court cited the origin of the doctrine in Noerr, and noted that numerous ""federal  [*27] courts have adopted 
this deference to the right to petition"" in various contexts, and that ""these courts have held individual defendants constitutionally 
immune from liability for exercising their right to petition."" 626 F.2d at 614-15 (citing Stern v. United States Gypsum, Inc., 547 
F.2d 1329, 1342-46 (7th Cir. 1977) (42 U.S.C. § 1985(1)) (sending to governmental employee's superiors complaints that are 
known to be false); Sawmill Prods. Inc. v. Town of Cicero, 477 F. Supp. 636, 642 (N.D. Ill. 1979) (section 1983) (protesting 
presence of plaintiff's sawmill which was then shut down by town ordinance); Weiss v. Willow Tree Civic Asso., 467 F. Supp. 
803, 816-18 (S.D.N.Y. 1979) (section 1983) (lobbying town officials en masse and filing groundless judicial and administrative 
complaints to oppose zoning permit); Aknin v. Phillips, 404 F. Supp. 1150, 1153 (S.D.N.Y. 1975) (section 1983) (urging officials 
to enforce unconstitutionally vague noise ordinance against plaintiff's discotheque); Sierra Club v. Butz, 349 F. Supp. 934, 938-
39 (N.D. Cal. 1972) (contractual interference) (filing lawsuit and administrative appeals to halt complainant's logging operation; 
filings constitutionally privileged  [*28] even if motivated by malice)). "
1251,10," This conclusion is consistent with two uncontested doctrines of common law, namely, the principles which underlie a cause of 
action for ""abuse of process,"" and the doctrine of ""judicial immunity."" Although not directly at issue here, the Court makes 
reference to them to underscore the consistency of the result here with other conventional concepts in the law. Under Pennsylvania law, ""[t]he gist of an action for abuse of process is the improper use of process after it has been issued, that 
is, a perversion of it[.]"" McGee v. Feege, 535 A.2d 1020, 1023, 517 Pa. 247, 253 (Pa. 1987)(quoting Publix Drug Co. v. Breyer 
Ice Cream Co., 32 A.2d 413, 415, 347 Pa. 346, 349-50 (Pa. 1943)). Among other prerequisites, a claim for abuse of process 
requires a plaintiff to establish  [*31] that the defendant used a legal process against the plaintiff primarily to accomplish a 
purpose for which the process was not designed. Hart v. O'Malley, 436 Pa. Super. 151, 647 A.2d 542, 551 (Pa. Super. Ct. 
1994); Rosen v. American Bank of Rolla, 426 Pa. Super. 376, 627 A.2d 190, 192 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1993). To satisfy the 
""perversion of process"" element, the plaintiff must show ""[s]ome definite act or threat not authorized by the process, or aimed at 
an objective not legitimate in the use of the process."" Id. at 170-71 (quoting Shaffer v. Stewart, 326 Pa. Super. 135, 473 A.2d 
1017, 1019 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1984)). Furthermore, ""there is no liability where the defendant has done nothing more than carry out 
the process to its authorized conclusion, even though with bad intentions."" Id. As the Third Circuit Court of Appeals noted, ""the 
point of liability is reached when 'the utilization of the procedure for the purpose for which it was designed becomes so lacking in 
justification as to lose its legitimate function as a reasonably justifiable litigation procedure.'"" Gen. Refractories Co. v. Fireman's 
Fund Ins. Co., 337 F.3d 297, 308 (3d Cir. 2003) (quoting Nienstedt v. Wetzel, 133 Ariz. 348, 651 P.2d 876, 882 (Ariz. Ct. App. 
1982)). Thus, wide latitude is given to  [*32] those who turn to legal processes as a means to accomplish a host of results. Similar indulgence is reflected in the doctrine of ""judicial immunity,"" which is firmly entrenched in Pennsylvania's common law, by 
which ""[a]ll communications pertinent to any stage of a judicial proceeding are accorded an absolute privilege which cannot be 
destroyed by abuse."" Binder v. Triangle Publications, Inc., 275 A.2d 53, 56, 442 Pa. 319, 324 (Pa. 1971). ""It has long been the 
law of Pennsylvania that statements made by judges, attorneys, witnesses and parties in the course of or pertinent to any stage 
of judicial proceedings are absolutely privileged and, therefore, cannot form the basis for liability for defamation."" Pawlowski v. 
Smorto, 403 Pa. Super. 71, 588 A.2d 36, 41 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1991); accord Binder, 275 A.2d at 56. This rule applies whether the 
statements occur in the pleadings or in open court. Binder, 275 A.2d at 56. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has stated: The reasons for the absolute privilege are well recognized. A judge must be free to administer the law without fear of 
consequences. This independence would be impaired were he to be in daily apprehension of defamation suits. The 
privilege is also extended  [*33] to parties to afford freedom of access to the courts, to witnesses to encourage their 
complete and unintimidated testimony in court, and to counsel to enable him to best represent his client's interests. 
Likewise, the privilege exists because the courts have other internal sanctions against defamatory statements, such as 
perjury or contempt proceedings. "
1252,," Id. As stated above, while these principles do not directly control here, they do demonstrate the consistency with which the law 
extends protection from liability to those who avail themselves, such as did Ms. Healy, of the community's legal procedures."
1252,11," Section 1981, in pertinent part, states: All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and 
enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the 
security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penalties, 
taxes, licenses, and exactions of every kind, and to no other."
1252,42, U.S.C. § 1981(a).
1252,12," Section 1985(3) states: If two or more persons in any State or Territory conspire, or go in disguise on the highway or on the premises of another, for 
the purpose of depriving, either directly or indirectly, any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws, or of 
equal privileges and immunities under the laws, or for the purpose of preventing or hindering  [*35] the constituted 
authorities of any State or Territory from giving or securing to all persons within such State or Territory the equal protection 
of the laws; or if two or more persons conspire to prevent by force, intimidation, or threat, any citizen who is lawfully entitled 
to vote, from giving his support or advocacy in a legal manner, toward or in favor of the election of any lawfully qualified 
person as an elector for President or Vice-President, or as a member of Congress of the United States; or to injure any 
citizen in person or property on account of such support or advocacy; in any case of conspiracy set forth in this section, if 
one or more persons engaged therein do, or cause to be done, any act in furtherance of the object of such conspiracy, 
whereby another is injured in his person or property, or deprived of having and exercising any right or privilege of a citizen 
of the United States, the party so injured or deprived may have an action for the recovery of damages, occasioned by such 
injury or deprivation, against any one or more of the conspirators."
1252,42, U.S.C. § 1985(3).
1252,13," Section 1983, in pertinent part, states: Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance,  [*36] regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the 
District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the 
jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be 
liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress, except that in any action 
brought against a judicial officer for an act or omission taken in such officer's judicial capacity, injunctive relief shall not be 
granted unless a declaratory decree was violated or declaratory relief was unavailable."
1252,42, U.S.C. § 1983.
1252,14," Despite Plaintiffs' argument to the contrary, there is little doubt that the court of appeals effectively disposed of Plaintiffs' Fair 
Housing Act claim. As noted above, the court of appeals found that Plaintiffs only had standing to pursue their claim that their 
property values will be (or have been) damaged by the grant of the variance (and the subsequent construction and operation of "
1253,," the storage facility). The Fair Housing Act prescribes discrimination against any person in the provision of housing facilities on 
 [*37] the basis of, inter alia, that person's race. This cause of action has absolutely no bearing on Plaintiffs' claims that their 
property values have been diminished."
1253,15," Arguably, however, Plaintiffs' only remaining claim is under Section 1983. The court of appeals introduced  [*38] Plaintiffs' 
issues on appeal as follows: ""On its face, this case presents the Court with the issue of whether neighboring property owners 
who allege that their property values will be diminished and their neighborhood blighted by the construction of a storage facility 
have standing to sue under 42 U.S.C. § 1983."" Taliaferro, 458 F.3d at 185. The court of appeals proceeded to affirm the Court's 
dismissal of Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint with respect to Plaintiffs' ""conspiracy"" claims, which they alleged under Section 
1985(3), id. at 190, Plaintiffs' equal protection claims, which they alleged under Sections 1981 and 1983, id., Plaintiffs' breach of 
contract claims, id. at 191-92 & n.6, and Plaintiffs' claim that the African-American community in Darby Township is being 
minimized, id. at 191-92. Moreover, the court of appeals held that Plaintiffs' sole remaining claim is for money damages and not 
injunctive relief. The court noted that Plaintiffs seek a remedy prohibiting the land in question here from being used for anything 
other than residential purposes (and, as explained above, the Plaintiffs now seek an injunction compelling the destruction of Ms. 
Healy's storage facilities). Id. at 191.  [*39] However, the court stated that an injunction would not redress Appellants' complaints of the Appellees' failure to implement the Urban Renewal Plan. This Court cannot 
direct the Appellees to implement the Urban Renewal Plan, even if it had not expired over twenty-five years ago. As the 
district court observed, an injunction preventing the storage units from being built does nothing to put into place 
construction of housing that would draw only African-American residents. Id. at 191-92."
1253,16," Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint also alleged violations of their equal protection rights. However, the court of appeals was 
explicit in rejecting Plaintiffs' equal protection claims. The court stated: ""Appellants have failed to allege an injury in fact that is 
concrete, particularized, or actual in order to confer standing upon them in regard to a denial of equal treatment as a result of the 
Appellees' alleged conspiracy to block the construction of residential housing on the Property."" Taliaferro, 458 F.3d at 190. In the 
section of its opinion discussing whether abstention would be appropriate, the court of appeals referred only to Plaintiffs' 
remaining ""due process claims."" Id. at 193."
1253,17," In so finding, the Court again acknowledges that this case is distinct from Omni in that the Plaintiffs here assert violations of 
their constitutional rights. However, the principle underlying Noerr-Pennington, to avoid effecting a ""chilling effect"" upon parties' 
freedom and ability to petition their government, has been clearly conferred importance by the Supreme Court."
1253,18," Plaintiffs do allege that they were ""shouted down"" at the Board hearing (Am. Compl. P 35), and Plaintiffs argue in their brief 
that Ms. Healy's allegedly unethical behavior during the Board hearings precludes affording her immunity in this case. However, 
to the extent that this behavior, in and of itself, could constitute a constitutional violation, the Plaintiffs allege that it was the Board 
members, and not Ms. Healy, who acted in this manner. In fact, the allegations in the Amended Complaint that describe the 
Board hearings do not attribute any racially-motivated or otherwise  [*42] boisterous conduct to Ms. Healy. (See generally Am. "
1254,," Compl. PP 33-38.) Plaintiffs merely assert that Ms. Healy ""presented a surprise expert witness"" at the hearing. (Am. Compl. P 
33.) Accepting this allegation as true, ""present[ing] a surprise expert witness"" at a zoning board hearing cannot be considered a 
constitutional violation by a litigant."
1254,19," Plaintiffs also argue that even if Ms. Healy's petitioning activity is immune, she is not immune from any damages caused by 
actually building and operating the storage facility. Those actions, Plaintiffs argue, are commercial actions that are not protected 
by the First Amendment. Plaintiffs cite no case law in support of this argument. The Court is disinclined to accept Plaintiffs' position in this regard for many of the same reasons discussed above. That is, 
refusing to apply the Noerr-Pennington doctrine to the facts of this case would serve to protect only those parties seeking to 
block construction, while holding liable those parties -- like Ms. Healy -- who are successful with their petition and then seek to 
pursue construction. Stated differently, had the facts of this case been reversed and it was Plaintiffs -- residents of an affected 
 [*43] community -- who petitioned the Board to amend a zoning ordinance to block construction of Ms. Healy's storage facility, 
Plaintiffs' petitioning activity would be immunized under Noerr-Pennington. See Gorman Towers, 626 F.2d at 615. Ms. Healy 
would be barred from seeking damages from Plaintiffs for petitioning the Board to deny Ms. Healy from pursuing commercial 
opportunities, i.e., construction and operation of the storage facility. Yet, Plaintiffs seek to hold Ms. Healy liable for realizing the 
fair use of her property after the Board granted her zoning variance, thus enabling her to construct the storage facility. Plaintiffs 
cite no authority supporting such a one-sided application of the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, and the Court does not interpret the 
relevant case law as supporting Plaintiffs' position. "
1264,1," In contrast, if a producer of a single drug for which there was more than one manufacturer had market power, supracompetitive 
prices could be expected to follow the monopolist's decision to restrict output."
1264,2," Circumstantial evidence, in turn, demonstrates only that a defendant has the potential to inflict injury to competition. "
1267,3," Having concluded  [**25] that the claims are invalid, the Court need not address the merits of Plaintiffs' other arguments 
concerning Abbott's patent defense."
1267,4," While Abbott sometimes refers to Plaintiffs' state law claims generally, Abbott's Illinois Brick argument does not specifically 
address Plaintiffs' claim under California's Business and Professions Code § 17200 et seq."
1267,5, Plaintiffs appear to concede this point and have not articulated an alternate theory of liability. 
1268,6," If Abbott wishes to move for an interlocutory appeal in the related cases, it should file a motion in those cases so that those 
plaintiffs will have an opportunity to respond."
1268,7," The Court DENIES Abbott's request to file supplemental material in support of its motion for summary judgment (Docket No. 
495). The material is not necessary to the Court's decision. "
1289,1," The retailers' complaint will be referenced with ""BA,"" for Baby Age, the first named retailer. The consumers' complaint will be 
referenced with ""McD,"" for McDonough, the first named consumer."
1289,2," HN1[
] Generally, a consumer who purchases from a retailer -- and not directly from a manufacturer -- lacks standing to bring 
an antitrust action against that manufacturer. Illinois Brick v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 746, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977). 
But, such a consumer does have standing when the manufacturer was involved in an antitrust conspiracy with the retailer from 
whom the consumer directly purchased. Howard Hess Dental v. Dentsply, 424 F.3d 363, 379 (3d Cir. 2005). Here, consumer plaintiffs allege that retailer BRU has illegally conspired with each manufacturer, and that the consumer plaintiffs 
 [**3] all purchased goods from retailer BRU. See, e.g., McD PP 213, 229-238, 255-261. Further, Defendants at oral argument 
conceded that the consumer plaintiffs have standing if they successfully allege that BRU and each manufacturer participated in a 
combination in restraint of trade under § 1 of the Sherman Act. Oral Arg. Tr. 4-5. Consumer plaintiffs have successfully pleaded 
this claim. See Part III, infra. Therefore, the consumer plaintiffs have standing. "
1290,3," HN5[
] Two products are ""reasonably interchangeable"" if consumers can use each for the same purpose. ""Cross-elasticity of 
demand"" refers to the relationship between the price of one product and the demand of another. The cross-elasticity of demand 
between two products is high if an increase in one's price causes an increase in the other's demand. See Philip Areeda & 
Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law: An Analysis of Antitrust Principles and their Applications (""Areeda"") P 562."
1290,4," Plaintiffs also alleged a market consisting of all of these individual markets taken together. BA P 69; McD P 206. They have 
chosen not to defend that combination market against the motions to dismiss. Pls.' Resp. 47 n.46. "
1291,5," Defendants contend that this language refers to the price at which manufacturers sell to retailers, rather than the price at which 
retailers sell to consumers. Oral. Arg. Tr. 50, 54. Because the gravamen of this action is a scheme to implement minimum resale 
price maintenance (""RPM"") at the retail level, the most natural reading of this language is the one that refers to the price to 
consumers."
1291,6," Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' market definitions are implausible because they do not specify ""what the price points are, 
which manufacturers do and do not make high-end products, and which retailers do and do not sell them."" Defs.' Mot. 17. But 
these evidentiary details are not required at the motion-to-dismiss stage. Broadcom v. Qualcomm, 501 F.3d 297, 317 (3d Cir. 
2007). "
1292,7, Plaintiffs allege that Regal Lager acted as Baby Bjorn's agent. BA P 45(a); McD  [**12] P 188. 
1294,8," It is apparently an open question whether a plaintiff can ultimately obtain a favorable jury verdict on both monopolization and 
attempted monopolization.  LePage's, Inc. v. 3M, 324 F.3d 141, 169 (3d Cir. 1999). However, there is no authority suggesting 
that both claims cannot simultaneously survive a motion to dismiss. "
1295,9," The Baby Age complaint styles this claim as a Sherman § 1 and Sherman § 2 claim. However, to the extent it is grounded in § 
1, it is functionally identical to the § 1 claim already pleaded in Count I. See, e.g., ID Sec. Sys. Can. v. Checkpoint, 249 F. Supp. 
2d 622, 658 (E.D. Pa. 2003) (discussing analysis of conspiracy claim pleaded under both §§ 1 and 2). "
1296,10," Of course, each manufacturer had its own economic stability to look after, and surely did not actively desire in the first instance 
to help BRU maintain its monopoly power. But this bears upon motive rather than intent, and does not undermine the sufficiency 
of Plaintiffs' specific-intent allegations."
1296,11," This claim is pleaded only in the retailers' complaint. Thus, the only relevant citations are paragraphs from that complaint. "
1297,12," Further, the alleged history of dealing between retailer plaintiffs and certain manufacturers suffices to plead a claim of 
intentional interference with prospective contractual relations. The retailers' complaint is packed cheek-to-jowl with factual 
allegations  [**27] that suggest that more supply contracts would have been made but for BRU's imposition of minimum RPM. 
See, e.g., BAP P 40(y) (Baby Age had been a ""dealer of Peg Perego products""); 41(hh) (Baby Club had been selling Medela's 
products for ""eight years""); 107."
1297,13," This claim is pleaded only in the retailers' complaint. Thus, the only relevant citations are paragraphs from that complaint. "
1300,1, The court assumes familiarity with the factual background of this case. See Amended Ruling (Doc. No. 69).
1300,2," Data Capture does not dispute that this motion was properly brought pursuant to 12(c), nor does it argue that this motion was 
untimely filed so as to delay trial. See Pl.'s Opp. to Mot. for Judg. on the Pleadings (Doc. No. 111). "
1301,3," Although Data Capture has brought two separate claims under CUTPA  [*7] (see Complaint), the parties discuss these claims 
as if they are analytically identical for the purposes of the pending Motion. Therefore, the court's analysis of one claim holds for 
both claims. "
1307,1," Plaintiffs' counsel sent with his May 13, 2008 letter statistical exhibits and a May 13, 2008 Declaration of Thomas R. McCarthy. "
1308,2," The inpatient dialysis services at Mercy are provided by a third party, DaVita, Inc. "
1309,3," Mercy correctly notes that Plaintiffs alleged in their Second Amended Complaint that the tying products were ""hospital inpatient 
services"" and ""inpatient nephrology services."" (Second Am. Compl. PP 107-09.) Mercy argues that Plaintiffs should not be 
permitted to further amend their complaint at the late date of the summary judgment hearing to narrow the proposed market for 
the tying product. See Leyba v. Renger, 874 F. Supp. 1229, 1238 (D.N.M. 1994) (refusing to allow the plaintiff to amend his 
complaint to narrow his definition of the relevant product market with respect to a § 2 monopolization claim by alleging the 
narrower market for the first time in his summary judgment  [*13] response, which was filed more than two years after complaint 
was filed). ""A motion to amend may properly be denied when there has been undue delay in moving for leave to amend or when 
amendment would be futile."" Id. (citing Foman V. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S. Ct. 227, 9 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1962)). However, 
given the apparent lack of prejudice to Mercy, the tying product should be considered as argued by Plaintiffs in their summary 
judgment briefing and at the hearing. "
1310,4," As noted above, the Court requested briefing on the issue of whether it may disregard the expert's geographic market analysis. 
However, the lack of analysis in the expert's report of the relevant geographic market for the tying product essentially moots the 
need for the Court to decide that question. "
1311,5," However, the Court notes that Plaintiffs failed to submit evidence that the alleged tying arrangement affects a ""substantial 
volume of commerce in the tied product market."" See Multistate Legal Studies, 63 F.3d at 1546. Just as Plaintiffs must establish 
the relevant geographic market for inpatient dialysis services as a component of their market power evidence, they must also 
establish the relevant geographic market for the tied product, inpatient physician nephrology services. As a result of Plaintiffs' 
failure to submit sufficient evidence on the relevant geographic market, the Court finds that there is no genuine issue regarding 
Defendant's market power in both the tied and tying product markets. "
1330,1," Within the Indirect Purchaser Class, the Indirect Purchaser Consumer Subclass is estimated as containing between 67 and 117 
million members (Decl. of Matthew Potter on the Distribution of Settlement Funds to the Consumer Subclass Members P10 (Apr. 
20, 2008) (""Potter Decl. on Distribution"") [docket item # 139-9]), and 38,152 members of the Indirect Purchaser Reseller 
Subclass have been identified (Joint Decl. of Joseph J. Tabacco, Jr. and Josef D. Cooper Regarding Class Notice & Claim Form 
Procedures, Ex. 1 (Feb. 1, 2008) (""Tabacco & Cooper Feb. 2008 Decl."") [docket item # 174]). The Direct Purchaser Class is 
significantly smaller, with notice being directly sent to 130 direct purchasers. (Decl. of Jared Stamell on Publication Notice to 
Direct Purchasers PP5-8 (Feb. 22, 2008) (""Stamell Feb. 2008 Decl."") [docket item # 182].) "
1336,2," To the extent that the factors stated in In re AT&T & Prudential II apply, they have been discussed with the Girsh factors due to 
the close nature of the inquiries under the facts of this case. "
1365,1," Figures on the 2000 election are available at http://www.fec.gov/fe2000/prespop.htm. 2004 election figures may be found at 
http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2004/tables.prf. "
1366,2, The amended complaint includes two consecutive paragraphs so designated. The court refers here to the latter. 
1368,3," The amended complaint mentions a voter plaintiff in particular only once, stating that ""conspirators … organized a campaign of 
harassing phone calls to the office of plaintiff-voter Gregory Kafoury, which was serving as Nader-Camejo's nomination 
headquarters,"" thus ""incapacitat[ing] the office phones for the entire day."" Am. Compl. P 169. The  [**13] plaintiffs do not cite it 
as support for their standing, nor could they as it is not a cognizable harm on which to base a malicious prosecution or abuse of 
process claim."
1368,4," One might note that, even assuming the voter plaintiffs had alleged an injury-in-fact, prudential standing considerations would 
impede their progress to the courthouse. See Elk Grove Unified School Dist. v. Newdow, 542 U.S. 1, 12, 124 S. Ct. 2301, 159 L. 
Ed. 2d 98 (2004)(holding that HN8[
] prudential standing encompasses ""the general prohibition on a litigant's raising another 
person's legal rights"") and Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 500-01, 95 S. Ct. 2197, 45 L. Ed. 2d 343 (1975)(recognizing that while 
standing ""in no way depends on the merits of the plaintiff's contention that particular conduct is illegal"" it ""often turns on the 
nature and source of the claim asserted"" such that a court must consider whether the law grants a right of action to persons 
""seek[ing] relief on the basis of the legal rights and interests of others"")."
1368,5," The question of whether the voter plaintiffs have Article III standing to bring their constitutional claims raised in the action 
transferred from the Eastern District of Virginia is an entirely separate question not before the court. "
1369,6," The source for this proposition is McConnell v. Federal Election Comm'n, in which the Court traced the electoral-candidate 
plaintiffs' alleged inability to compete to their ""wish"" not to solicit or accept large contributions rather than to increased hard-
money limits under campaign finance law allowing the plaintiffs' opponents to raise more money. McConnell v. FEC, 540 U.S. 
93, 228, 124 S. Ct. 619, 157 L. Ed. 2d 491 (2003). The circumstances of Nader's decision were quite different, however. In 
McConnell,  [**16] the new campaign finance law changed the rules of the playing field for everyone, and the plaintiffs, 
presented with the opportunity to exploit the new contribution limits or abstain, chose the latter. In the 2004 election, the instant 
defendants allegedly singled out Nader and subjected him to a barrage of litigation, the costs of which he attempted to mitigate 
through a personal to his campaign - the only choice available to him if he wanted to remain a candidate. Thus, McConnell is 
distinguishable."
1369,7," The line of argument strikes the court as strained: it is perfectly plausible that the Nader-Camejo 2004 Campaign and the 
defendants might be jointly and severally liable for the loan default. HN9[
] Two defendants may be found jointly liable if each 
is a proximate cause of the injury. Westfarm Assocs. Ltd. Partnership v. Wash. Suburban Sanitary, 66 F.3d 669, 687 (4th Cir. 
1995). Because the possibility that the campaign might default on the loan was a foreseeable event, the default does not 
necessarily act as a supervening cause vitiating the contributory impact of the defendants' alleged tortious conduct. Id. Thus, 
while the defendants may be correct that the court has no authority to order  [**17] the Nader-Camejo 2004 Campaign to repay 
the loan, DNC's Mot. to Dismiss at 20, that presents a question distinguishable from whether the defendants may be held liable 
for Nader's loss by the campaign's default. "
1370,8," Nader announced his candidacy for president on February 24, 2008. Pls' Opp'n at 37. "
1371,9," HN17[
] To state a claim for abuse of process, a plaintiff must allege that a defendant perverted the judicial process to 
achieve a purpose not contemplated in the regular prosecution of the charge and that the defendant had an ulterior motive. Hall 
v. Hollywood Credit Clothing Co., 147 A.2d 866, 868 (D.C. 1959).  [**25] HN18[
] To state a claim for malicious prosecution, a 
plaintiff must allege (1) that the underlying suit terminated in the plaintiff's favor; (2) malice; (3) lack of probable cause; and (4) 
special injury. Morowitz v. Marvel, 423 A.2d 196, 198 (D.C. 1980). The plaintiffs have not explained how the court could interpret 
a priori any future federal election law filings against Nader by the defendants as exemplars of these causes of action. The court 
cannot, therefore, prospectively enjoin the defendants from engaging in any HN19[
] political petitioning, especially as such activity implicates a fundament First Amendment freedom. See L.A. v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 103 S. Ct. 1660, 75 L. Ed. 2d 
675(1983) (explaining that injunction to ""follow the law"" in the absence of some allegedly imminent violation of the law is 
inappropriate because moot). "
1372,10," HN23[
] Abuse of process ""is conceptually different from, but overlaps with, malicious prosecution, the latter of which occurs 
only when a legal action is brought without probable cause"" and terminates in the malicious-prosecution plaintiff's favor. Whelan, 
953 F.2d at 670."
1372,11," This recitation of the plaintiffs' allegations supporting  [**30] their abuse-of-process claim should not be construed to 
encompass the conclusion that the plaintiffs have successfully stated an abuse-of-process claim. For as the court explains later, 
they have not. See infra III.B.2. "
1373,12," The court  [**34] notes that the question of whether the plaintiffs' Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) motion for relief from 
judgment in the D.C. Superior court implicates Rooker-Feldman is analytically distinct from whether the plaintiffs' claims for 
malicious prosecution implicate Rooker-Feldman. The former raises issued not presented before the Pennsylvania Supreme 
Court. Specifically, the motion for relief cites newly discovered evidence of alleged connections between Reed Smith and the 
Pennsylvania Supreme Court justices, which, the plaintiffs argue, should have resulted in the justices' recusals. Pls.' Opp'n, Ex. 
1 (""Pls.' Mot. for Relief from Foreign Judgment"") at 16. This, then, would appear to touch upon questions of res judicata or issue 
preclusion but not Rooker-Feldman concerns. Nesses, 68 F.3d 1004. To be clear, the court predicates its holding that some of 
the plaintiffs' malicious prosecution claims do confront Rooker-Feldman not on the plaintiffs' motion for relief from judgment but 
on their amended complaint filed in this court."
1373,13, The defendants do not dispute that the other cases terminated in the plaintiffs' favor. 
1375,14," This is a significant  [**43] assumption. HN37[
] An unsuccessful lawsuit is not presumed unreasonable or without 
foundation until a court has determined whether the state of law at the time of the suit was uncertain or not. Prof'l Real Estate 
Investors, 508 U.S. at 61, Organon Inc. v. Mylan Pharms., Inc., 293 F. Supp. 2d 453, 462 (D.N.J. 2003). The plaintiffs do not 
brief this question, but because this case is before the court on a motion to dismiss and alternative grounds for dismissal exist, 
the court will (preliminarily) assume the plaintiffs could establish this question in their favor. "
1376,15," The inverse is true too; that is to say, one might have an improper purpose in bringing suit but still not commit an abuse of 
process sufficient to invoke the sham exception if one's suit is not objectively baseless. See Prof'l Real Estate Investors, Inc. v. 
Columbia Pictures Indus., 508 U.S. 49, 63, 113 S. Ct. 1920, 123 L. Ed. 2d 611 (1993)(explaining  [**46] that HN40[
] ""[j]ust as 
evidence of [wrongful] intent cannot affect the objective prong of Noerr's sham exception, a showing of malice alone will neither 
entitle the wrongful civil proceedings plaintiff to prevail nor permit the factfinder to infer the absence or probable cause""). For this 
reason, the court does not consider statements allegedly made by the defendants evincing a potentially improper purpose 
pertinent to the instant question. Am. Compl. PP 62-63. Even assuming their veracity, they only constitute evidence of subjective 
state of mind, not the objective plausibility of the defendants' challenges on the merits when filed."
1376,16," The plaintiffs do argue that Reed Smith perpetrated a fraud on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court by failing to disclose certain 
connections between its attorneys and presiding justices. See generally Pls.' Mot. for Relief from Judgment. Assuming these 
facts to be true, they nevertheless fail to give rise to a legal conclusion that the defendants' knowingly presented baseless claims "
1377,," against the plaintiffs to the court. While the court refrains from issuing a substantive  [**48] opinion on the plaintiffs' motion 
before the Superior Court, it notes that for the purposes of the sham exception, the claim at most suggests a technical, 
procedural impropriety pertinent to the judicial ethics of recusal not the merits of the case itself. See Allied Tube & Conduit Corp. 
v. Indian Head, Inc., 486 U.S. 492, 508 n. 10, 108 S. Ct. 1931, 100 L. Ed. 2d 497 (holding thatHN41[
]  sham exception does 
not cover party who genuinely seeks to achieve his governmental result, but does so through improper means)."
1377,17," In their opposition, the plaintiffs appear to recognize this, as they write that ""abuse of process refers to the wrongful use of 
process after it has been properly issued."" Pls.' Opp'n at 20 (citing 1 AM. JUR. 2D Abuse of Process § 3 (1994)). "
1378,18," The plaintiffs' argument that the litigation  [**53] the defendants allegedly subjected them to was particularly onerous because 
it was conducted successively in multiple states is unpersuasive because the piecemeal nature of our federalist electoral 
process rendered that a necessity. See Tri-State Hosp. Supply Corp. v. United States, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48609, 2007 WL 
2007587, at *7-8 (D.D.C. July 6, 2007) (holding that HN47[
] lack of ""unusual or exceptional procedures"" and evidence ""to 
suggest that the proceedings were longer or more onerous than otherwise would have been necessary"" precluded abuse-of-
process claim)."
1378,19," In addition to abusive litigation, the plaintiffs allege that the defendants orchestrated campaigns of ""harassment, intimidation 
and sabotage,""  [**54] with the specific intention of preventing Nader-Camejo from complying with state election laws. Am. 
Compl. PP 67-71, 236. They do not, however, raise these allegations in the context of any specific underlying tort other than 
conspiracy, which is itself merely a form of establishing the liability of multiple defendants for a predicate tort. Hill v. Medlantic 
Health Care Group, 933 A.2d 314, 334 (D.C. 2007). "

1389,2, Defendant Intuit is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in California. See FAC P 8.
1389,3, Defendant Block is a Delaware limited liability corporation with its principal place of business in Missouri. See FAC P 9.
1389,4," Defendant FFA is a District of Columbia limited liability corporation with ""offices"" in Virginia. See FAC P 10. The First Amended 
Complaint calls Defendant FFA a ""Cartel,"" see FAC P 1; I will refer to it as ""Defendant FFA."" "
1390,5," In their response, Plaintiffs note that they ""are not  [**5] seeking to imply a private right of action under the IOAA."" Plaintiffs' 
Response to Intuit's Motion, at 17. Instead, Plaintiffs claim to be ""pursuing an equitable remedy under the provisions of the 
Administrative Procedures Act [(APA)]."" Id. I therefore will refer to Plaintiffs' claim in Count I as their IOAA/APA claim."
1390,6," The IRS is not named as a defendant in Count II presumably because neither the United States nor any agency ""of the 
executive branch of the Government of the United States"" is a ""person"" subject to potential liability under the Sherman Act. See 
United States Postal Service v. Flamingo Indus., Ltd., 540 U.S. 736, 745-46, 124 S. Ct. 1321, 158 L. Ed. 2d 19 (2004)."

Id. P 15."
1390,8," Achieving the policy goals set forth in § 2001(a) of the RRA was only one of the purposes of this agreement. According to the 
proposed terms of the agreement, it was designed to meet the following five objectives: "
1391,1," . Assuring access to a free and secure electronic preparation and filing option for additional taxpayers, building upon free 
electronic tax preparation and filing provided in the commercial market today;"
1391,2, . Making  [**8] tax return preparation and filing easier and reducing the burden on individual taxpayers;
1391,3," . Supporting the IRS's statutory goals of increased e-filing, pursuant to the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, 
which encouraged the IRS to set a goal of having 80% of Federal tax and information returns filed electronically by the year 
2007;"
1391,4, . Providing greater service and access to taxpayers; and
1391,5," . Implementing one of the proposals in the President's FY'03 budget, specifically to encourage further growth in electronic 
filing by providing taxpayers the option to file their tax return on-line without charge, using cooperation with, and 
encouraging competition within, the private sector to increase e-filing. FAC, Exhibit A, art. I (emphasis added)."
1391,9," ""Membership in [the] Free File Alliance is open to all companies that can satisfy the basic eligibility requirements."" 67 Fed. 
Reg. 67247, 67248; see also FAC, Exhibit A, art. III.B"
1391,10," Section IV of the 2005 Agreement provides that the ""IRS and the Executive Director and Alliance attorney are developing a 
memorandum of understanding (MOU) that would provide structure for the roles and responsibilities for both the IRS and the 
FFA leadership."" FAC, Exhibit B, art. IV.A. On December 20, 2005, pursuant to the above-quoted language, Defendants FFA 
and the IRS signed a Memorandum of Understanding (""MOU"") which formalized certain standards of practice, as well as ""the 
process whereby a Member [of the FFA] may be denied permission to list its company on the IRS website and/or a Member's 
listing may be removed from the IRS website."" Defendant FFA's Motion, Exhibit 4, at 1 (Preamble). On January 12, 2007, 
Defendant FFA and the IRS signed another, similar MOU that superseded their December 20, 2005 MOU. See Defendant FFA's 
Motion, Exhibit 5. The term of the superseding 2007 MOU is the same as the term of the 2005 Agreement (i.e., 4 years), 
 [**10] and the 2007 MOU ""may be terminated consistent with that agreement."" Defendant FFA's Motion, Exhibit 5, art. VI. I have 
not found, nor have the parties mentioned, any differences between the 2005 and 2007 MOUs that are relevant to this action."
1391,11," A somewhat simpler explanation of the Free File Program may be found on the IRS's website: Free File is a free federal income tax preparation and electronic filing program for eligible taxpayers, developed through a 
partnership between the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Free File Alliance, LLC, a group of private sector tax 
software companies. You may access free commercial online tax preparation and electronic filing services through the IRS 
website. Eligible taxpayers may prepare and file their federal income tax returns using commercial online software provided 
by the Free File Alliance companies -- not the IRS. Since Free File's debut in 2003, more than 19.2 million returns have 
been filed through the program saving taxpayers millions of dollars. "
1392,," Defendant FFA's Motion to Dismiss, Exhibit 3 (""What Is Free File?"")."
1392,12," The 2005 and 2007 MOUs signed by Defendants FFA and the IRS express a similar goal -- i.e., ""increas[ing] electronic filing 
of tax returns, which includes extending the benefits of on-line federal tax preparation and  [**13] electronic filing to economically 
disadvantaged and underserved populations at no cost to the individual or the government."" Defendant FFA's Motion, Exhibit 4, 
art. II; see also, id. Exhibit 5, art. II. "
1393,13," The IOAA, 31 U.S.C. § 9701, reads, in its entirety, as follows: HN2[
] (a) It is the sense of Congress that each service or thing of value provided by an agency (except a mixed-
ownership Government corporation) to a person (except a person on official business of the United States Government) is 
to be self- sustaining to the extent possible. (b) The head of each agency (except a mixed-ownership Government corporation) may prescribe regulations establishing 
the charge for a service or thing of value provided by the agency. Regulations prescribed by the heads of executive 
agencies are subject to policies prescribed by the President and shall be as uniform as practicable. Each charge shall be-- (1)  [**17] fair; and (2) based on (A) the costs to the Government; (B) the value of the service or thing to the recipient; (C) public policy or interest served; and (D) other relevant facts. (c) This section does not affect a law of the United States (1) prohibiting the determination and collection of charges and the disposition of those charges; and (2) prescribing bases for determining charges, but a charge may be redetermined under this section consistent with 
the prescribed bases."
1393,31, U.S.C. § 9701 (2008). 
1394,14," According to Plaintiffs, these IRS ""rules  [**18] and regulations"" ""require[] certain taxpayers to e-file their tax and information 
returns through IRS e-file, and provide[] substantial incentives for others to do so."" Id. P 56."
1394,15," ""The defendant class with regard to Plaintiffs' claim arising out of 31 U.S.C. § 9701 includes the IRS and all members of the

Agreement with the IRS."" FAC at Prayer for Relief (b), (c)."
1394,18," Section 1  [**20] of the Sherman Act declares that HN3[

U.S.C. § 1 (2008)."

1395,22," There is ample authority for deciding a motion to dismiss for lack of standing under Rule 12(b)(1). See Taliaferro v. Darby

§ 3531.15 n.9 (2d ed. 1984). "
1396,23," In the footnote in the above-quoted passage, the Twombly Court added that HN6[
] ""[w]hile, for most types of cases, the 
Federal Rules eliminated the cumbersome requirement that a claimant 'set out in detail the facts upon which he bases his claim,' 
Rule 8(a)(2) still requires a 'showing,' rather than a blanket assertion, of entitlement to relief."" 127 S.Ct. at 1965 n.3 (quoting 
Conley, 355 U.S. at 47) (emphasis in original). ""Without some factual allegation in the complaint, it is hard to see how a claimant 
could satisfy the requirement of providing not only 'fair notice' of the nature of the claim, but also 'grounds' on which the claim 
rests."" Id.; see also, Phillips, 515 F.3d at 232 (""We caution that without some factual allegation in the complaint, a claimant 
cannot satisfy the requirement that he or she provide not only 'fair notice,' but also the 'grounds' on which the claim rests."")."
1396,24," ""In [Twombly]  [**26] the Supreme Court rejected language that long had formed part of the Rule 12(b)(6) standard, namely 
the statement in Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 78 S. Ct. 99, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957), that a complaint may not be dismissed 
'unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to 
relief.'"" Phillips, 515 F.3d at 230 (quoting Conley, 355 U.S. at 45-46); see also Twombly, 127 S. Ct. at 1969 (""This phrase is best 
forgotten as an incomplete, negative gloss on an accepted pleading standard; once a claim has been stated adequately, it may 
be supported by showing any set of facts consistent with the allegations in the complaint."") (emphasis added). "
1397,25," If necessary, the Corporate Defendants may challenge this court's jurisdiction factually at a later date, when the record is more 
fully developed."

1398,36," Defendant FFA's Memorandum of Law, § V; see also Defendant Block's Memorandum of Law, § IILD. "
1399,37," Defendants correctly cite Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U.S. 26, 96 S. Ct. 1917, 48 L. Ed. 2d 
450 (1976) for the rule that HN14[
] ""even named plaintiffs who represent a class must allege and show that they personally 
have been injured, not that injury has been suffered by other, unidentified members of the class to which they belong and which 
they purport to represent."" Id. at 40 n.20 (internal quotation omitted)."
1399,38," I must qualify this holding in one regard. That is, since Plaintiff Seltzer purchased and used Defendant Intuit's product (but not 
Defendant Block's product) and since Plaintiff Byers purchased and used Defendant Block's product (but not Defendant Intuit's 
product), I must conclude that, with regard to Plaintiffs' IOAA/APA claims, Plaintiff Seltzer lacks constitutional standing to sue 
Defendant Block, and Plaintiff Byers lacks constitutional standing to sue Defendant Intuit. See Defendant Block's Memorandum 
of Law, at 12 n.8. (The same reasoning does not apply to Plaintiffs' Sherman Act claim, because the ""supracompetitive"" price 
Plaintiffs allegedly paid for Defendants Block and Intuit's products was caused, according to Plaintiffs, by the 2005 Agreement 
between the IRS  [**37] and Defendant FFA, whose membership includes both Defendants Block and Intuit.)"
1399,39," Defendant Block cites City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 103 S. Ct. 1660, 75 L. Ed. 2d 675 (1983) for the proposition 
that Plaintiffs lack constitutional standing to assert their IOAA/APA claim for injunctive relief because ""Plaintiffs fail to allege, and 
there is no basis to believe, that either one will use Block DTS tax preparation and e-filing services, or pay any fees for e-filing 
services, again in the  [**38] future."" Memorandum of Law, at 12; see also Lyons, 461 U.S. at 105 (""Lyons' standing to seek the "
1400,," injunction requested depended on whether he was likely to suffer future injury from the use of the chokeholds by police 
officers.""). I will reject this argument at this time because the First Amended Complaint contains allegations, which, when 
accepted as true, are sufficient to establish that Defendants are continuing to charge Plaintiffs and the proposed class unlawful 
fees, thereby giving Plaintiffs standing to seek injunctive relief on their IOAA/APA claim. See FAC P 65 (""Because the fees 
Plaintiffs and the proposed class were charged to e-file their tax returns were and are unlawful, Plaintiffs and the proposed class 
are entitled to . . . injunctive relief prohibiting the IRS and/or the Corporate Defendants from charging such fees in the future."") 
(emphasis added)."
1400,40," Or, as Plaintiffs put it, ""[t]his [argument] ignores the allegation that plaintiff Stacie Byers did in fact pay H&R Block to e-file her 
tax returns."" Plaintiffs' Response to the Motions of Defendants Block and FFA, at 5."
1400,41," Defendant Block's point appears to be that Plaintiff Byers lacks constitutional standing if she was ineligible for the Free File 
Program, but that argument conflates the standing inquiry with the inquiry into whether Plaintiff Byers ultimately can recover. As 
many courts have noted, HN15[
] ""failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted does  [**42] not mean that federal 
question jurisdiction is lacking."" The Pitt News v. Fisher, 215 F.3d 354, 360 (3d Cir. 2000) (citing Steel Co. v. Citizens for a 
Better Env't, 523 U.S. 83, 89, 118 S. Ct. 1003, 140 L. Ed. 2d 210 (1998)); see also Society Hill Towers Owners' Ass'n v. Rendell, 
210 F.3d 168, 176-77 (3d Cir. 2000) (""[T]he City's argument against the Residents' standing conflates issues of standing and 
questions of proof."")."
1400,42," Like Defendant Block, Defendant FFA also argues that Plaintiffs lack constitutional standing because they have not alleged 
that they were eligible to e-file for free as part of the Free File Program. See Defendant FFA's Memorandum of Law at 29. Unlike 
Defendant Block, however, Defendant FFA believes this means that ""Plaintiffs have not adequately alleged a causal connection 
between the harm they allege and the conduct they challenge."" Id. I reject this argument for the same reason I have rejected "
1401,," Defendant Block's argument -- i.e., because it conflates the standing inquiry with the merits of Plaintiffs' claims and runs contrary 
to my duty to accept Plaintiffs' allegations of injury and causation as true at this stage of the action. "
1402,43," For the same reasons, I reject the Corporate Defendants' argument that I should not adjudicate Plaintiffs' claims because they 
raise ""political questions."" See Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 82 S. Ct. 691, 7 L. Ed. 2d 663 (1962)."
1402,44," The First Amended Complaint includes an allegation that ""Plaintiffs and members of the proposed class' injuries are within the 
zone of interests to be protected by 31 U.S.C. § 9701."" FAC P 61. This is a legal conclusion, not an allegation of fact, so it does 
not affect my analysis on this issue. "
1403,45," See 31 U.S.C. § 9701(b) (HN18[
] ""The head of each agency (except a mixed-ownership Government corporation) may 
prescribe regulations establishing the charge for a service or thing of value provided by the agency.""). In Title 31 of the United 
States Code, 'agency' means a department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States Government."" 31 U.S.C. § 101 
(2008)."
1403,46," My discussion will focus on the Court of Appeals' analysis, because the district court's dismissal of the IOAA claim was based 
entirely on the fact that the plaintiffs sought to apply the IOAA to fees charged by a private entity. See Thomas, 2 F. Supp. 2d 22, 
36 (D.D.C. 1998) (""The problem, however, is that the statute applies only to a 'service or thing of value provided by an agency.' 
31 U.S.C. § 9701(b). NSI is clearly not a federal agency, and the NSI fees are clearly not charged by a, federal agency for 
federal services. . . . Therefore, the Court must dismiss Count Four of the Amended Complaint.""); see also id. at 32-33 (using the 
same reasoning to dismiss the IOAA claim in Count Three)."
1403,47," ""As a registry, Network Solutions maintain[ed] a top-level domain's zone files, the directory databases listing domain names 
and their Internet Protocol numbers."" Id. at 505. ""As registrar, Network Solutions act[ed] as go-between for domain name holders 
and the registry, providing various services, including the registration of domain names on a first-come, first-served basis."" Id. "
1404,48," These requirements are set forth in 31 U.S.C. § 9701(b), which reads as follows: HN20[
] (b) The head of each agency (except a mixed-ownership Government corporation) may prescribe regulations 
establishing the charge for a service or thing of value provided by the agency. Regulations prescribed by the heads of 
executive agencies are subject to policies prescribed by the President and shall be as uniform as practicable. Each charge 
shall be -- (1) fair; and (2) based on -- (A) the costs to the Government; (B) the value of the service or thing to the recipient; (C) public policy or interest served; and (D) other relevant facts."
1404,31, U.S.C. § 9701(b) (2008).
1404,49," This authorization arose out of the NSF's mandate ""to foster and support the development and use of computer and other 
scientific and engineering methods and technologies, primarily for research and education in the sciences and engineering."" 42 
U.S.C. § 1862(a)(4); see also 42 U.S.C. § 1862(g) (""In carrying out subsection (a)(4) of this section, the Foundation is authorized 
to . . . ."")."
1404,50," The Thomas Court also distinguished two Comptroller General decisions on this  [**56] ground: ""In In re: FEC-Sales of 
Microfilm Copies of Candidate and Committee Reports, 61 Comp. Gen. 285 (1982) and In re: Retention of Fees Received by 
EPA Contractors Providing Information Services to the Public, 1975 WL 7967 (Comp. Gen. Oct. 20, 1975), federal agencies 
hired private firms to produce agency records on the agencies' behalf Both cases involved services that statutes required the 
agencies to perform. There is no such statutory mandate here."" Thomas, 176 F.3d at 511. "
1405,51," The quoted portion of the amended complaint read as follows: ""NSF has not and does not directly supervise or manage any 
NSI activities pertaining to the Domain Name registration process. The only 'control' and 'oversight' exercised by NSF over NSI 
and the Domain Name registration process is the contractual requirement that NSF submit certain limited quarterly and annual 
reports."" 176 F.3d at 510-11."
1405,52," Disagreeing with the plaintiffs' claim that the ""public purpose"" of domain name registration made it a quintessential government 
service subject to the IOAA, the Thomas Court quoted the following language from San Francisco Arts & Athletics, Inc. v. United 
States Olympic Comm'n, 483 U.S. 543-44 (1987): ""[T]hat a private party performs a function which serves the public does not 
make its acts governmental."" "
1406,53," Plaintiffs' allegations that the IRS  [**62] has a ""statutory duty to collect tax and information returns from taxpayers,"" FAC P 56, 
and that it ""requires certain taxpayers to e-file their tax and information returns through IRS e-file,"" id., do not affect my 
conclusion, because they do not say that the Free File Program itself was statutorily mandated."
1406,54," See, e.g., FAC 1118 (""Pursuant  [**63] to the [FFA's] agreement with the IRS, the Corporate Defendants and members of the 
[FFA] agreed to develop and maintain the IRS's electronic tax forms and filing system (IRS e-file) for the IRS under the IRS's 
direct guidance, supervision and control.""); id. P 54 (""At all material times hereto, the Corporate Defendants acted on behalf of 
and as agents of the IRS.""). In light of the 2002 and 2005 Agreements (and their accompanying Memoranda of Understanding), 
which clearly spell out the relationship between the IRS and the FFA, I am not required to credit these bald assertions and legal 
conclusions. See Morse v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., 132 F.3d 902, 906 (3d Cir. 1997)."
1406,55," The most significant provisions in the 2002 and 2005 Agreements are listed below: - The 2002 Free On-Line Electronic Tax Filing Agreement (FAC, Exhibit A) - Article V.A: ""The IRS will host and maintain the Web Page."" "
1407,," - Article V.C: ""Taxpayers will be able to use [FFA] Participants' software to prepare and electronically file their own personal 
income tax returns using proprietary processes and systems which such Participants host and maintain."" - The 2005 Free On-Line Electronic Tax Filing Agreement Amendment (FAC, Exhibit  [**64] B) - Article IV.A: ""IRS and the Executive Director and Alliance attorney are developing a memorandum of understanding 
(MOU) that would provide structure for the roles and responsibilities for both the IRS and FFA leadership. The issues that 
are included in the draft MOU include tasks such as:"
1407,1, . Screening offers and web sites of members as part of the Alliance's suitability/filing season readiness program;
1407,2, . Monitoring of member offerings and member web sites;
1407,3," . Participation in review of decisions when removing a member from the irs.gov Free File web page and the 
reinstatement of the member's site after a security or disclosure breach; and"
1407,4," . Providing for a dispute resolution process that could be invoked by Alliance members whose offerings are rejected 
or removed from irs.gov. As anticipated, the December 20, 2005 Memorandum of Understanding (Defendant Block's Motion, Exhibit C; Defendant FFA's 
Motion, Exhibit 4) established detailed standards of practice for FFA members, see id. art. IV, as well as procedures for the IRS 
and/or the FFA Executive Director to remove (or refuse to post) FFA members' listings from the Free File website and for the 
affected member to administratively appeal  [**65] any such adverse action. See id. arts. VII and VIII. The January 12, 2007 
Memorandum of Understanding made only minor changes to these standards of practice and administrative procedures. See 
Defendant Block's Motion, Exhibit D; Defendant FFA's Motion, Exhibit 5."
1407,56," This is another bald assertion/legal conclusion that I am not required to credit. See Morse, 132 F.3d at 906."
1407,57," See Thomas, 176 F.3d at 511 (""This might seem sufficient to indicate that the [IOAA] does not apply. But if we give the section 
a broader interpretation, . . . ."")."
1407,58," Like the Thomas Court, I also find applicable here the rule that a private party's acts are not governmental just because they 
serve the public. See 176 F.3d at 511 n.18 (quoting San Francisco Arts & Athletics, Inc., 483 U.S. at 543-44). Thus, the ""public 
purpose"" of the Free File Program or IRS e-file does not make the acts of the FFA or its members (including the Corporate 
Defendants) governmental within the meaning of the IOAA. "
1408,59," Before the FAA established the trust at issue in Motor Coach, bus transportation at Dulles International Airport had been 
provided by a private company. Id. at 961."
1408,60," The FAA's involvement in the Motor Coach trust and the IRS's involvement in the Free File Program are hardly comparable. 
As the Court of Appeals wrote: The documents governing the Trust not only made the FAA the sole beneficiary, but gave the agency a prominent, if not 
exclusive, role in the Trust's administration. The FAA established the airlines' contribution formula, monitored collections 
with its own staff, exercised final  [**70] approval power over disbursements, and participated in every phase of the 
decision to award Eagle the bus contract. Id. The IRS's relationship with Defendant FFA and the Free File Program is completely different. Under the Free File Program, 
the IRS makes its website (irs.gov) available to the FFA's members, who control the particulars of the tax preparation and filing 
services they want to provide. See FAC, Exhibits A and B. The IRS's role is limited to policing the website and ensuring that the 
services provided by the FFA's members meet the standards set forth in the governing agreements. Id."
1408,61," ""While the decisions of the Comptroller General are not binding, . . . the General Accounting Office has special expertise in 
this area, and its decisions may provide useful guidance to the court."" DGS Contract Serv., Inc. v. United States, 43 Fed. Cl. 
227, 238 (Fed. Cl. 1999). "
1409,62," The Comptroller General's lack of focus on the IOAA is revealed by its failure to mention the IOAA in its suggestion that the 
NIH ask Congress to grant it statutory authority to collect and retain attendance fees. Contractors Collecting Fees, 2006 WL 
39435, at *2  [**72] (""Congress may, of course, enact legislation authorizing an agency hosting a conference on behalf of the 
government to collect and retain an attendance fee. Should Congress wish to grant agencies such authority, agencies may in 
turn permit their contractors to collect such a fee."")"
1409,63," The SBA cited Thomas ""in contending that the Miscellaneous Receipts Statute [31 U.S.C. § 3302] does not apply to money in 
the hands of a government grantee and, by analogy, a government contractor such as Thompson Cobb."" 2004 WL 77861, at *8. 
In rejecting this argument, the Comptroller General correctly noted that the Thomas Court allowed Network Solutions to charge 
and retain fees for its services because the NSF was under no statutory duty to provide those services. Id. The SBA, on the 
other hand, was statutorily required to review the PLP lenders so Thomas was consistent with the Comptroller General's holding. 
Id."
1409,64," The  [**74] remedy imposed by the Comptroller General was not a refund of fees unlawfully charged under the IOAA but 
rather an order for the SBA to ""cease these practices unless and until Congress authorizes them, and in the meantime, . . . [to] 
identify the review costs paid by lenders to its contractor and pay these costs itself from appropriations accounts available for 
this purpose."" 2004 WL 77861, at *9."
1409,65," Plaintiffs correctly  [**75] cite Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 893-94, 108 S. Ct. 2722, 101 L. Ed. 2d 749 (1988) and 
Zellous v. Broadhead Assocs., 906 F.2d 94, 99 (3d Cir. 1990) for the proposition that HN23[
] a refund of fees unlawfully 
charged under the IOAA is a permissible remedy under the APA. See Plaintiffs' Response to Intuit's Motion, at 17-19 (also citing 
Nat'l Ass'n of Broadcasters v. FCC, 180 U.S. App. D.C. 259, 554 F.2d 1118, 1130 (D.C. Cir. 1976) and Air Transp. Ass'n v. CAB, 
235 U.S. App. D.C. 333, 732 F.2d 219 (D.C. Cir. 1984)). "
1410,66," Like the Corporate Defendants, I believe Count I of the First Amended Complaint is more naturally read as asserting a claim 
under the IOAA, not the APA. Therefore I hold in the next section that the lack of an express or implied private right of action 
under the IOAA also requires dismissal of Count I as against the Corporate Defendants."
1410,67, This definition also contains numerous exceptions not applicable to this case.
1410,68," The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has observed that ""any general definition [of 'agency'] can be of only 
limited utility  [**77] to a court confronted with one of the myriad organizational arrangements for getting the business of 
government done."" Washington Research Project, Inc. v. Dep't of Health, Educ. & Welfare, 164 U.S. App. D.C. 169, 504 F.2d 
238, 245-46 (D.C. Cir. 1974). Thus, ""[t]he unavoidable fact is that each new arrangement must be examined anew and in its own 
context."" Id. at 246. One court summarized the reported cases well when it wrote the following: [T]he HN25[
] criteria utilized in making such a determination are [1] whether the entity has authority to act with the 
sanction of government support, or [2] has any authority in law to make decisions, or [3] has substantial authority in the 
exercise of specific functions. In re Gideon, Inc., 158 B.R. 528, 531 (Bankr. S.D. Fla. 1993) (footnotes omitted)."
1410,69," The International Brominated Court seemed willing to entertain the notion that a private entity's mere ""contractual relationship"" 
with the federal government could make it a governmental entity and therefore perhaps an ""agency"" under the APA. 393 F. 
Supp. 2d at 1380. But I have found no controlling authority to that effect. On the contrary, the case law I have examined appears 
to support the opposite conclusion. See United States v. Pa. Envtl. Hearing Bd., 584 F.2d 1273 (3d Cir. 1978) (holding that a 
private  [**79] company operating under a federal contract was not a federal ""department, agency, or instrumentality"" for the 
purposes of section 313 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972); Mark v. Borough of Hatboro, 856 F. 
Supp. 966, 974 (E.D. Pa. 1994) (""[T]he Company is an independent contractor with whom the Borough has contracted to provide 
firefighting services. The delegation of this function does not transform the Company into a state actor.""). "
1411,70," I would reach the same conclusion even if I were to consider whether the Corporate Defendants' characteristics make any of 
them a de facto agency under the APA. Unlike the ""modern day post exchange"" at issue in Ellsworth Bottling Co. v. United 
States, 408 F. Supp. 280 (W.D. Okla. 1975), none of the Corporate Defendants ""has the authority to act with the sanction of the 
Government behind it."" Id. at 282 (holding that the AAFES was an agency under the APA where, by statute, its contracts were 
considered contracts with the federal government and any judgments against it were paid out of the federal Treasury). Moreover, 
unlike the Professional Standards Review Organization (""PSRO"") at issue in Public Citizen Health Research Group v. Dep't of 
Health, Educ. & Welfare, 449 F. Supp. 937 (D.D.C. 1978),  [**80] none of the Corporate Defendants ""has any authority in law to 
make decisions."" Id. at 941 (holding that the PSRO was an agency under the APA where ""in practically all cases, [Medicare or 
Medicaid] benefits are not paid unless the PSRO makes its conclusive affirmative determinations of medical necessity""). Finally, 
unlike the Property Review Board (""PRB"") at issue in Conservation Law Found. of New England, Inc. v. Harper, 587 F. Supp. 
357 (D. Mass. 1984), none of the Corporate Defendants has substantial authority in the exercise of a specific government 
function. See id. at 364 (finding that the PRB, which was created by executive order, was an agency under the APA, where the 
plaintiffs ""ha[d] alleged facts tending to show that the PRB possesses broad power, whether formal or informal, to control the 
sale or other disposition of public property""). "
1412,71," Subsection (c) simply makes it clear that the IOAA does not affect existing federal statutes that prohibit certain charges or 
prescribe other bases for determining charges. 31 U.S.C. § 9701(c). "
1413,72," I am not aware of any part of the IOAA's legislative history that sheds light on Congress' intent (or lack thereof) to create a 
private remedy to enforce the IOAA. The absence of any such legislative history certainly does not detract from the force of the 
reasoning that arises out of the text and structure of the IOAA. See Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 288 n.7 (""[T]he interpretive inquiry 
begins with the text and structure of the statute, and ends once it has become clear that Congress did not provide a cause of 
action."") (internal citation omitted). As for the other factors, the Corporate Defendants have not articulated any argument relating "
1414,," to the ""customary legal incidents"" (if any) that follow directly from the IOAA, or to Congress' explicit creation of private rights of 
action in similar statutes enacted at roughly the same time as the IOAA."
1414,73," Defendant Block argues that another factor weighing against Congress' intent to create a private remedy is the IOAA's location 
in the United States Code. See Defendant Block's Memorandum of Law at  [**92] 16 (""Section 9701 is located in the 
'Miscellaneous' Chapter of the Money and Finance title of the U.S. Code, and the surrounding code sections are entirely 
unrelated to the cost of government services.""); see also, Thompson v. Thompson, 484 U.S. 174, 183, 108 S. Ct. 513, 98 L. Ed. 
2d 512 (1988); Wisniewski, 510 F.3d at 304 n.26 (citing Thompson for the proposition that ""the provision's location in the United 
States Code"" is one of ""an assortment of other factors"" that the court may consider). I agree with Defendant Block but note that 
this factor is a weaker indicator of Congress' intent than the IOAA's remedial scheme, which neither includes nor appears to 
require an express private remedy."
1414,74," This addresses Plaintiffs' concern that ""if the fees collected by the defendants are illegal there must be a form to provide a 
refund."" Plaintiffs' Response to Intuit's Motion, at 17. "
1415,75," See Defendant FFA's Memorandum of Law, § III.C."
1415,76," See Defendant Block's Memorandum of Law, § III.C.3."
1415,77," Like constitutional standing, antitrust standing is a threshold requirement.  [**96] See City of Pittsburgh v. West Penn Power 
Co., 147 F.3d 256, 264 (3d Cir. 1998); see also A.D. Bedell Wholesale Co., Inc. v. Phillip Morris Inc., 263 F.3d 239, 249 (3d Cir. 
2001) (noting that a court must conduct this threshold inquiry even if it ultimately concludes that one of the antitrust immunity 
doctrines bars the plaintiff's claim). However, the two doctrines differ in important respects; in this regard, the Supreme Court 
has observed that: [T]he HN35[
] focus of the doctrine of 'antitrust standing' is somewhat different from that of standing as a constitutional 
doctrine. Harm to the antitrust plaintiff is sufficient to satisfy the constitutional standing requirement of injury in fact, but the 
court must make a further determination whether the plaintiff is a proper party to bring a private antitrust action. Assoc. Gen. Contractors of California, Inc. v. California State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 535, n.31, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 
L. Ed. 2d 723 (1983). One important difference between antitrust standing and constitutional standing is that a plaintiff's failure to 
establish antitrust standing results in dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), not Rule 12(b)(1). See NicSand, Inc. v. 3M Co., 507 F.3d 
442, 449 (6th Cir. 2007);  [**97] Glaberson v. Comcast Corp., Civ. A. No. 03-6604, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 62672, 2006 WL 
2559479, at *3 n.2 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 31, 2006). "
1416,78," See FAC, Exhibit A, art. III.B.2 (requiring each FFA member to offer free online federal tax return preparation and filing 
services to 10% of taxpayers, but not setting an upper limit on the percentage of taxpayers who could be offered free services)."
1416,79," See FAC, Exhibit B, arts. I.A and I.D (providing that ""[e]ach Alliance member must provide  [**99] a minimum of 10% 
coverage,"" but adding that ""[n]o individual Alliance member offer can cover more than 50 percent of total taxpayers . . ., and this 
taxpayer population must be within the total aggregate coverage scope of 70%"")."
1416,80," Plaintiffs' citation of In re Linerboard Antitrust Litig., 305 F.3d 145, 151 (3d Cir. 2002) is misplaced because the ""Bogosian 
short-cut"" applies to the predominance factor in class certification analysis, not to antitrust standing analysis. "
1417,81," Defendant FFA's Memorandum of Law, § III.C."
1417,82," Defendant Block's Memorandum of Law, § III.C.3."
1417,83," This doctrine takes its name from the two Supreme Court cases that first recognized it: E. R.R. Presidents Conference v. 
Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961) and United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 
657, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965)."
1417,84," See, e.g., Defendant Block's Motion to Dismiss, Exhibit H (a letter dated March 30,  [**105] 2006 from an IRS official to the 
Executive Director of the FFA ""explaining how the level of coverage for services offered through the Free File program was 
determined by the IRS during the renewal process to extend the partnership agreement between the IRS and the Free File 
Alliance). Defendant Block relies heavily on this letter in the section of its brief that discusses Noerr-Pennington immunity. See 
Defendant Block's Memorandum of Law, at 26-27. "
1418,85," Defendants Intuit and FFA cite paragraphs 16, 18, and 19 of the First Amended Complaint to support their argument that 
Plaintiffs have pleaded themselves out of court by alleging facts which establish the applicability of Noerr-Pennington to bar 
Plaintiffs' Sherman Act claim. See Defendant Intuit's Memorandum of Law, at 21-22 (""Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint implies that 
Intuit and other Free File Alliance members agreed to solicit the IRS to limit their provision of free e-filing services, see FAC P 
19, and that they furthered their agreement by successfully negotiating with the IRS an agreement to limit the provision of free e- 
filing services. See FAC PP 16, 19.""); Defendant FFA's Memorandum of Law, at 23 (""Plaintiffs allege that the  [**106] IRS 
actively negotiated with the FFA, and that it directly guided, supervised and controlled its own Free File Program. See FAC 
1118.""). Despite the use of the word ""negotiated"" in paragraph 16, I disagree with Defendants Intuit and FFA's interpretation of 
these paragraphs. These paragraphs merely allege that Defendant FFA entered into the 2002 and 2005 Agreements with the 
IRS, see FAC PP 16, 18, and that ""when renewing the 2002 Agreement with the IRS in 2005, the members of the [FFA] illegally 
agreed among themselves"" to restrict the availability of free services through the Free File Program. FAC P 19. Since these 
paragraphs say nothing specific about the Corporate Defendants' petitioning/negotiating activity (or the effects thereof), they are 
not a sufficient basis for dismissing Plaintiffs' Sherman Act claim on the ground of Noerr-Pennington immunity. Defendants Intuit and FFA also cite paragraphs (e) and (g) of the First Amended Complaint's Prayer for Relief as proof that 
""Plaintiffs' true dispute is with the effects of government action,"" thus establishing the applicability of Noerr-Pennington to bar 
Plaintiffs' Sherman Act claim. Defendant Intuit's Memorandum of Law, at 24; Defendant  [**107] FFA's Memorandum of Law, at 
23. Again, I disagree. These paragraphs are simply requests for injunctive relief against Defendants' alleged violations of the 
IOAA and the Sherman Act. They say nothing about the petitioning activity (and the effects thereof) that the Corporate 
Defendants must prove to prevail against Plaintiffs' Sherman Act claim on the ground of Noerr-Pennington immunity. "
1419,86," As someone not intimately familiar with how the internet works, I benefitted greatly from the Court of Appeals' explanation of 
this and other jargon: The current [Domain Name System (""DNS"")] has a hierarchical tree structure of names. A domain name, such as 
<www.uscourts.gov>, comprises a series of alphanumeric fields, or ""domains,"" separated by periods or ""dots."" Within each 
domain name, the alphanumeric field to the far right is the Top Level Domain (""TLD""), and each prior field to the left of the 
period preceding the TLD is the Second Level Domain (""SLD""), the Third Level Domain, and so on. Thus, TLDs are the 
highest subdivisions of Internet domain names, and SLDs and other lower level domains identify the host computers 
 [**112] and individual websites under each TLD. There are currently two different types of TLDs: seven generic TLDs 
(""gTLDs""), namely "".com,"" "".net,"" "".org,"" "".edu,"" "".gov,"" "".int,"" and "".mil,"" and approximately 240 two-letter country code TLDs 
(""ccTLDs""), such as "".us,"" "".uk,"" ""jp,"" and ""Ir."" The process of converting domain names into IP numbers [- which identify computers connected to the internet and allow 
them to communicate with each other -] begins with the ""root zone file,"" which is the highest level of the domain name 
system and contains the databases enabling an Internet address query to be routed to its proper destination. The master 
root zone server of the DNS contains the authoritative root zone file, from which the other 12 duplicate root zone servers 
download new domain name information on a daily basis. The root zone file serves the function of directing an address 
query to the proper TLD zone file, which contains information regarding the location of the numerous gTLDs and ccTLDs. 
The TLD zone file in turn directs the address query to SLD zone files, which contain listings of all SLDs and corresponding 
IP numbers under the TLD in question. The SLD zone files then direct the  [**113] query to lower level portions of the DNS, 
until the address query is fully resolved. Name.Space, 202 F.3d at 577 (internal citations and footnotes omitted)."
1419,87," The Court of Appeals wrote the following to explain why this request was so important to the plaintiffs business: In late 1996, Name.Space's predecessor-in-interest, pgMedia, Inc., began providing domain name registration services in 
competition with NSI, and accepted new registrations under approximately 530 new gTLDs, such as "".forpresident,"" "
1420,," "".formayor,"" and "".microsoft.free.zone."" However, domain names registered under Name.Space's gTLDs are not universally 
resolvable, that is, they cannot be converted into the correct IP numbers by most users of the Internet, because those 
gTLDs are not listed in the root zone files. Thus, unless NSI amends the master root zone file to include Name.Space's new 
gTLDs, the domain names registered with Name.Space cannot be located by all Internet users, as Internet address queries 
are initially routed to the various root zone servers containing NSI's master root zone file. Id. at 578."
1420,88," The Court summarized as follows the effect of the relevant terms in the NSF-NSI cooperative agreement: As noted above, the Cooperative Agreement requires NSI to provide Internet domain name registration services in 
accordance with the provisions of RFC 1174. RFC 1591, the successor to RFC 1174, states that: [t]he Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is responsible for the overall coordination  [**115] and management 
of the Domain Name System (DNS), and especially the delegation of portions of the name space called top-level domains. . . . Applications for new 
top-level domains (for example, country code domains) are handled . . . with consultation with the IANA. The Cooperative Agreement also states that the NSF ""has responsibility for registration services support, support planning, 
oversight, monitoring, and evaluation,"" and that it ""will make approvals required under the General Conditions."" One of 
these General Conditions, Grant General Condition No. 8, requires NSI ""to obtain prior written approval from the NSF 
Grants Officer whenever there are significant changes in the project or its direction."" Thus, NSI first sought to consult with 
IANA regarding Name.Space's request that its gTLDs be added to the root zone file. When IANA declined to provide any 
direction and indeed disclaimed any authority with respect to the addition of gTLDs, NSI undertook to obtain NSF's approval 
for the significant project change of accepting applications for new gTLDs without the supervision or even the participation 
of IANA. NSF not only refused to give NSI the written approval required under the  [**116] Cooperative Agreement, but 
Amendment No. 11 further memorialized and reinforced this refusal, stating that NSI ""shall request written direction from an 
authorized [Commerce Department] official before making or rejecting any modifications, additions or deletions to the root 
zone file."" Thus, there was only one course of conduct open to NSI pursuant to the Cooperative Agreement: to refuse to add any new 
gTLDs to the root zone file, which refusal is precisely the basis for Name.Space's antitrust claim. Id. at 582-83"
1420,89," Court's discussion of government policy was considerably more straightforward. In June 1998, the Commerce Department 
published a final policy statement on the future of the DNS known as the ""White Paper."" Id. at 578. This document articulated a 
number of policy objectives, one of which was that ""the stability and future development of the DNS is best served by not adding 
any new gTLDs during the transition to ICANN [i.e., the non-profit corporation created to succeed NSI as the manager of the 
DNS]."" Id. at 583. In light of this language, the Name.Space Court concluded that ""the specific conduct undertaken by NSI 
pursuant both to the White Paper and to the Cooperative Agreement  [**117] is a direct result of government policy and is 
thereby entitled to implied antitrust immunity."" Id. at 584. "
1421,90," The Corporate Defendants argue that I may reach this conclusion simply by crediting Plaintiffs' allegations that the Corporate 
Defendants acted as the IRS's ""agents,"" FAC 54, and that they ""agreed to develop  [**119] and maintain the IRS's electronic tax 
forms and filing system (IRS e-file) for the IRS under the IRS's direct guidance, supervision and control."" Id. P 18. I disagree for 
these allegations would be meaningless if they were contradicted by the express terms of the 2005 Agreement or its 
accompanying MOU. Here it so happens that these allegations do not contradict the terms of the Agreement or the MOU. They 
therefore neither add to nor detract from my analysis on this point."
1421,91," On the one hand, one could argue that unlimited free services would do more to increase e-filing. On the  [**121] other hand, 
one could argue that modest restrictions on free services are necessary because unlimited free services would threaten the 
financial health of the FFA's members -- upon whose continued participation the Free File Program depends. "
1422,92," Plaintiffs should be mindful that any amended allegations must comply with Twombly's requirements. See 127 S.Ct. at 1965 
(""Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level, on the assumption that all the 
allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact)."") (internal citations and footnote omitted); see also Phillips, 515 
F.3d at 234 (""[Twombly] does not impose a probability requirement at the pleading stage, but instead simply calls for enough 
facts to raise a reasonable expectation  [**123] that discovery will reveal evidence of the necessary element."") (internal quotation 
omitted)."
1422,93," HN41[
] ""[I]f a complaint is vulnerable to 12(b)(6) dismissal, a District Court must permit a curative amendment, unless an 
amendment would be inequitable or futile."" Alston v. Parker, 363 F.3d 229, 235 (3d Cir. 2004) (citing Grayson v. Mayview State "
1423,," Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 108 (3d Cir. 2002)). I will not  [**125] give Plaintiffs leave to amend Count I because such an amendment 
would be futile. I have held (1) that the IOAA does not apply to private entities like the Corporate Defendants, (2) that private 
entities like the Corporate Defendants may not be sued under the APA, and (3) that there is no express or implied private right of 
action under the IOAA. Further amendment of Count I could not change any of these holdings. Count II will be dismissed with 
leave to amend because, as explained previously, it is not clear that further amendment would be inequitable or futile. "
1426,1," After ENH's motion to dismiss was fully briefed, the court further consolidated under this lead case (No. 07 CV 4446) related 
cases (Nos. 08 CV 2343 and 08 CV 2658) filed by plaintiffs Steven J. Messner and Henry W. Lahmeyer on April 24 and May 8, 
2008, respectively. Nevertheless, as the court made clear in its orders of May 16 and 22, 2008, ENH's motion to dismiss is 
deemed to have been submitted and directed against Messner's and Lahmeyer's claims as well. "
1428,2," None of the three decisions on which ENH relies for the proposition that plaintiffs' claims accrued at the time of the merger so 
held in the context of a motion to dismiss. First, as discussed above, in Midwestern Machinery, 392 F.3d 265, the Eighth Circuit 
affirmed a grant of summary judgment. Second, in Concord Boat, 207 F.3d 1039, the Eighth Circuit reversed the district court's 
post-trial judgment. Third, in United States Gypsum Co. v. Indiana Gas Co., 350 F.3d 623 (7th Cir. 2003), the Seventh Circuit 
merely noted in dicta that ""[a] merger may be complete at closing."" Id. at 628 (citing Concord Boat, 207 F.3d at 1050-53). Furthermore, the antitrust treatise on which ENH  [*15] relies for the proposition that ""policy reasons militate in favor of running 
the statute of limitation from the date that two firms come under the degree of control necessary to cause the competitive injury 
in question,"" 2 Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P 320c5, at 304, relies, in turn, on the Eighth Circuit's 
opinions in Midwestern Machinery and Concord Boat. "
1430,3," Because the defendant has not established that plaintiffs' claims accrued prior to February 10, 2000, the court need not 
address plaintiffs' additional arguments in opposition to ENH's motion to dismiss--(a) that plaintiffs have alleged a continuing 
violation and (b) that in the event the court finds that the plaintiffs' claims are untimely, plaintiffs should be permitted to file an 
amended complaint adding fraudulent concealment allegations. "
1436,1," Toledo Trane also sought to obtain a temporary restraining order to avoid termination of its franchise. After a period of delay, 
during which  [**7] the parties sought unsuccessfully to resolve that part of their dispute, I overruled the motion for the temporary 
restraining order. "
1437,2," Though on their face these sections create only criminal penalties, § 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15(a), provides treble 
damages relief to ""any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust 
laws."""
1437,3," Trane also rightly points out that the Valentine Act counterclaim (Count Five) succeeds or fails with its federal antitrust 
counterparts. C.K. & J.K., Inc. v. Fairview Shopping Ctr. Corp., 63 Ohio St. 2d 201, 204-05, 407 N.E.2d 507 (1980). To the 
extent that I find defendant's federal antitrust counterclaims fail to state a claim, I also dismiss the Valentine Act counterclaim 
(see Section B. 4., infra)."
1437,4," Resale price  [**11] maintenance does not constitute a per se violation of antitrust laws but must instead be assessed under 
the rule of reason. Leegin Creative Leather Prods. v. PSKS, Inc.,     U.S.    , 127 S. Ct. 2705, 2725, 168 L. Ed. 2d 623 (2007). "
1438,5," Other courts acknowledge that the test is somewhat fluid. See Morrison v. Murray Biscuit Co., 797 F.2d 1430, 1438 (7th Cir. 
1986) (""No hard and fast line, therefore, can be drawn between the mere sales agent and the dealer or distributor, for these 
terms denote points, by no means fixed, on a continuum bounded at one end by the manufacturer's full-time employees and at 
the other by vast, autonomous distribution enterprises such as Sears Roebuck.""). "
1439,6," I also note that the court's commentary in Pink Supply on this issue is dicta because the court limited Pink Supply's appeal to 
two claims of error: 1) ""that the evidence sufficiently raised an issue of fact regarding whether the representatives were acting for 
their own benefit in recommending appellant's termination as a Hiebert dealer""  [**17] and 2) ""that Albrecht v. Herald Co., 390 
U.S. 145, 150, 88 S. Ct. 869, 19 L. Ed. 2d 998 (1968) and Int'l Travel Arrangers, Inc., v. W. Airlines, Inc., 623 F.2d 1255, 1266 
(8th Cir.) authorize a finding of conspiracy between a corporation and its agents if the agents are aware of the anticompetitive 
purpose for which they are being used."" Pink Supply Corp. v. Hiebert, Inc., 788 F. 2d 1313, 1317-18 (8th Cir. 1986) (internal 
citations omitted)."
1439,7," Like the Eight Circuit in Ozark Heartland Elecs., Inc. v. Radio Shack, 278 F.3d 759, 763 (8th Cir. 2002), I ""find it more 
straightforward to approach this case under Ryko's fourth element -- whether the antitrust plaintiff engaged in an independent 
transaction with a subsequent purchaser."" "
1440,8," The ""List Price Cost Point Adjustment Factor"" (LP CPAF) dictates the potential markdown franchisees may apply  [**20] to 
Trane equipment. The ""Multiplier (entered)"" is a number that ranges from .358 to .396, that is multiplied by the ""List Price"" to 
arrive at the ""Selling Price."" (When there is a list price cost point adjustment, the ""Selling Price"" is the product of the ""List Price"" 
times the ""Multiplier (entered)"" times the ""LP CPAF"".)"
1440,9," However,  [**21] as discussed below, Trane failed to bring this claim within the four year statute of limitations. The claim of 
illegality regarding resale price maintenance of non-Trane ancillary products in bundled sales shall, accordingly, be dismissed as 
well."
1440,10," Past decisions applied the per se rule to tying arrangements. If the defendant had ""sufficient economic power with respect to 
the tying product to appreciably restrain free competition in the market for the tied product and a 'not insubstantial' amount of 
interstate commerce [was] affected,"" the tie was illegal. Fortner Enters., Inc. v. U.S. Steel Corp., 394 U.S. 495, 499, 89 S. Ct. 
1252, 22 L. Ed. 2d 495 (1969). Recent Sixth Circuit decisions have altered this analysis, requiring a deeper examination of the transaction in question. See, 
e.g., Beard. v. Parkview Hosp., 912 F.2d 138, 140 (6th Cir. 1990) (describing a tie as per se unlawful ""when the seller has such 
power in the tying product or service  [**23] market that the 'existence of forcing is probable' and there is 'a substantial potential 
for impact on competition'""; otherwise the court should apply the rule of reason); Ransomes Am. Corp. v. Spartan Distribs., Inc., 
914 F. Supp. 183, 185 (W.D. Mich. 1996) (tying arrangement that affects only dealers is not presumptively illegal and is subject 
to the rule of reason). This has led the Sixth Circuit to describe its framework as a merger of the per se and rule of reason "
1441,," theories. PSI Repair Servs. Inc., Honeywell, Inc., 104 F.3d 811, 815, n.2 (6th Cir. 1997) (""[T]hese two theories have, in effect, 
merged in recent years."")."
1441,11," Past manufacturer-dealer cases appear to have involved actual sales rather than access arrangements. See Ransomes Am. 
Corp. v. Spartan Distribs. Inc., 914 F. Supp. 183, 184 (W.D. Mich. 1996) (explaining that defendant manufacturer RAC, required 
dealer to ""purchase [defendant's] mowers in order to be able to purchase other RAC products"" (emphasis added)); Strawflower 
Electronics, Inc. v. Radioshack Corp., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45205, 2005 WL 2290314, at *1 (N.D. Cal.) (contract required 
franchise to purchase a minimum amount of products from franchisor). Yet other cases indicate that a traditional ""sale"" is not 
required for tying products. See Valley Products Co., Inc. v. Landmark, 128 F.3d 398, 401 (6th Cir. 1997) (dismissing allegations 
that franchisor tied sales of logoed amenities to franchise rights because of lack of antitrust injury). "
1442,12," This is not entirely accurate as the ISOs in Kodak  [**29] served as strong evidence that the services Kodak provided were not 
unique. See Kodak, supra, 504 U.S. at 457 (""Some customers found that the ISO service was of higher quality [than Kodak's]."")."
1442,13," The court also pointed out that in contrast to the third party buyers in Kodak -- and the defendant in this case -- the franchisees 
in Queen City Pizza knew about the purchasing requirements before becoming ""locked in"" by the franchise contract. Queen City 
Pizza, Inc. v. Domino's Pizza, Inc., 124 F.3d 430, 440 (3d Cir. 1997) (""The Kodak case arose out of concerns about unilateral 
changes in Kodak's parts and repairs policies . . . In contrast, plaintiffs here knew that Domino's Pizza retained significant power 
over their ability to purchase cheaper supplies from alternative sources because that authority was spelled out in detail in section 
12.2 of the standard franchise agreement."")."
1442,14," Plaintiff points out that in Valley Products Co., Inc. v. Landmark, 128 F.3d 398, 405 (6th Cir. 1997), the Sixth Circuit stated its 
""basic agreement"" with the Third Circuit's approach in Domino's. The plaintiff's citation to Valley Products, however, is 
misleading. Rather than adopting the Third Circuit's market analysis, Valley Products focused on trademark abuse and 
franchisor Landmark's requirement that franchisees purchase logoed amenities. Id. at 401. In the case, plaintiff Valley Products 
Co. wanted to sell soaps to franchised lodging facilities but the franchisor revoked Valley Products' right to manufacture or sell 
items ""bearing logos owned or licensed by [the franchisor] or its affiliates."" Id. Due to the alleged tie, franchisee lodging facilities 
could no longer purchase soaps from the plaintiff. Despite the fact that Queen City Pizza ""rested its decision on relevant market considerations, without expressly addressing the 
issue of 'trademark abuse,'"" the court in Valley Products did not  [**32] believe that the Third Circuit could have reached its result 
had it thought ""that Domino's . . . was guilty of trademark abuse."" Id. at 405. Therefore, the Sixth Circuit only agreed with the 
Third Circuit to the extent that the Third Circuit held that Domino's did not commit trademark abuse by requiring a franchisee to 
buy its specific ingredients and supplies as a condition of its continued enjoyment franchise rights. Id. "
1443,," This means that Valley Products did not reject franchise rights as tying products or appropriate markets. Rather, it rejected the 
argument that requiring franchisees to purchase logoed products is ""trademark abuse."" Id. In contrast, the defendant in this case 
alleges that Trane conditioned the enjoyment of the Trane brand, and related franchise rights, on Toledo Trane's compliance 
with MOPP 34b, not the purchase of logoed items. "
1444,15," Toledo Trane provides conclusory allegations (e.g., ""Because of Trane's appreciable economic power in the tying product, the 
Trane-Branded Product, in the New HVAC Unit Market and in the Trane Branded Market, Trane's tying arrangement affects a 
significant volume of commerce in the Territory for the Non-Trane-Branded Products"" (Countercls. at P 123)). These statements 
do not meet the Twombly standard. Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). "
1453,1, The PTO issued a Notice of Allowance in October of 2006.
1453,2," The Patent Complaint was initially docketed  [**3] by the Clerk's Office as having been filed on September 24, 2007. Plaintiffs 
filed a motion to correct the docket to reflect the fact that the case was not filed until the stroke of midnight on September 25, 
2007. The court allowed the motion."
1453,3," In amending the Antitrust Complaint, plaintiffs abandoned their previously asserted claims of violations of the Massachusetts 
Antitrust Act."
1453,4," An invention is not patentable if it was ""in public use or on sale in this country, more than one year prior to the date of the 
application for patent in the United States."" 35 U.S.C. § 102(b). The Supreme Court instructs that the on-sale bar applies when 
the invention, more than a year prior to the application date, is: (1) the subject of a commercial offer for sale; and (2) ready for 
patenting. Pfaff v. Wells Elecs., Inc., 525 U.S. 55, 67, 119 S. Ct. 304, 142 L. Ed. 2d 261 (1998). The second element may be 
satisfied ""by proof of reduction to practice before the critical date; or by proof that prior to the critical date the inventor had 
prepared drawings or other descriptions of the invention that were sufficiently specific to enable a person skilled in the art to 
practice the invention."" Id. at 67-68. "
1454,5," Because Allstate spends approximately $ 230 million on insurance replacement rentals annually, Hertz views Allstate as an 
important potential customer. Nothing is offered about the potential scale of business with GE, which does not immediately come 
to mind as a major presence in the rental car business. "
1455,6," In that case, the Court ruled that ""[t]he patent-law issue, while arguably necessary to at least one theory under each claim 
[brought under the Sherman Act], is not necessary to the overall success of either claim."" Id. at 810. Here, an affirmative 
analysis of patent law would seem indispensable to the success of plaintiffs' claims."
1455,7," In another recently decided case, an alleged infringer sued the patentee claiming unfair competition under the Lanham Act, 
intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, and trade libel under California statutory and common law. The 
patent holder had written to several of its customers giving notice that it had been accused of potential infringement and stating 
that it would not hesitate to take defensive legal action. The Federal Circuit held that ""because [plaintiff's] claims arise out of 
[defendant's] communication of its patent rights, patent law is a necessary element of [plaintiff's] claims."" Dominant 
Semiconductors SDN.BHD. v. Osram GMBH, 524 F.3d 1254, 1259 (Fed. Cir. 2008)."
1455,8, Plaintiffs do not concede the existence of a defect in the original filing. 
1456,9," In Mathews, the filing of an application for certain Medicare benefits was a nonwaivable statutory condition of jurisdiction. 426 
U.S. at 75. Although one plaintiff in the class action had not filed his application prior to suit, he did so while the case was 
pending in the District Court. Id. "
1457,10," At the May 5, 2008 hearing, defendants' counsel was predictably evasive about any intention on defendants' part to bring a 
future enforcement action. "
1458,11," Defendants speculate (not very usefully) about the myriad reasons that might explain why Hertz never won business from GE, 
including economic considerations and the availability of a presumably better technology from Hertz's competitors. Defendants 
also suggest that it may have been Hertz's own filings with the Securities Exchange Commission (which indicated that Enterprise 
""has asserted that certain systems we use to conduct insurance replacement rentals would infringe  [**26] on patent rights it 
would obtain if it were granted certain patents for which it applied"") that spoiled any relationship with GE. Plaintiffs offer little "
1459,," more by way of help on the subject. They suggest that the alienation of GE's affection resulted from an undefined ""whispering 
campaign"" waged by unnamed employees of defendants."
1459,12," Section 767 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts sets out additional factors that might be considered in determining whether 
a defendant's intentional interference with a contract (or a prospective contractual relation) should be deemed improper: ""(a) the 
nature of the actor's conduct, (b) the actor's motive, (c) the interests of the other with which the actor's conduct interferes, (d) the 
interests sought to be advanced by the actor, (e)  [**28] the social interests in protecting the freedom of action of the actor and 
the contractual interests of the other, (f) the proximity or remoteness of the actor's conduct to the interference, and (g) the 
relations between the parties."""
1459,13," The court is at a loss with respect to the allegations regarding Allstate. There is nothing offered other than conjecture 
connecting the question set out in Allstate's RFQ with defendants' conduct, much less anything of a factual nature suggesting 
that Allstate's decision (if there was one) not to do business with plaintiffs was occasioned by a malicious or improper act by 
defendants. "
1460,14," Defendants cite Roche v. Royal Bank of Canada, 109 F.3d 820 (1st Cir. 1997), for the proposition that a defendant is exempt 
from liability if the ""anticompetitive effects occurred primarily and substantially outside Massachusetts."" The reliance on Roche is 
inapt. Roche dealt with a different issue: whether the actionable conduct in fact occurred in Massachusetts. Id. at 829 (The 
""question [is]  [**31] whether the deception occurred primarily and substantially in Massachusetts . . . . [H]ere the burden is on 
defendants to show that their misconduct occurred primarily and substantially outside Massachusetts."") (Emphases supplied). 
Defendants do not allege that their conduct had no ""substantial"" relationship to the Commonwealth. "
1461,15," The Missouri case was transferred and consolidated with the then pending Massachusetts litigation. The parties ultimately 
reached a settlement of the consolidated cases, and the court entered an Order on November 3, 2004, noting that ""[i]t is 
STIPULATED by defendants Enterprise Rent-A-Car Company and The Crawford Group, Inc., that the Hertz EDiCAR System as 
it existed on June 21, 2002, did not infringe any of the defendants' then existing intellectual property rights, which did not include 
any patent rights, and that the use of the Hertz EDiCAR System as it existed at the time did not constitute unfair competition."""
1461,16," Defendants complain that because the initial salvo in the 2002 litigation was fired by plaintiffs, it is unfair to trot out the prior 
litigation as an affirmative act on defendants' part lending itself to the creation of jurisdiction in this case."
1461,17," Defendants have attached declarations by Pagliaro and his supervisor, Bruce Clifton, to their Reply Brief. Pagliaro states that 
he does not recall making any comments to Heilman regarding the effects that a successful patent application might have on 
Hertz's ability to provide EDiCAR-related services. Clifton swears that when he learned of plaintiffs' allegations, he wrote to 
Heilman assuring her that Pagliaro did not have the authority to speak on behalf of Hertz.  [**35] With regard to Allstate, Clifton 
avers that the due diligence question posed by Allstate is not at all unusual in the industry, and that defendants did nothing to 
prompt Allstate to ask the question. In fact, Clifton asserts that Allstate asked the same question in a similar RFQ that it sent to 
Enterprise. Because the case is at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, the court has not relied on the declarations. See Collier v. City of 
Chicopee, 158 F.3d 601, 602 (1st Cir. 1998). "
1462,18," As is its practice in patent cases, the court will issue an order requiring plaintiffs to specify in greater detail the grounds on 
which they believe that the EDiCAR system does not meet various limitations (for example, the database and sortable repair 
facility call back list requirements) of the independent claims of the '038 Patent. The court acknowledges plaintiffs' offer to 
amend the Complaint in this regard, but believes that its customary procedure is the more efficient approach. "
1466,1," Although these agreements are for one year terms, they can be renewed annually for 20 successive one year terms. The 
agreements contain significant penalties for non-renewal and significant financial incentives if renewed, virtually guaranteeing 
that the full supply agreements will be in effect for the full 20 years. "
1470,2," With all due respect to defendants' counsel, it appears to the Court that defendants' counsel do in fact misconstrue the 
regulations upon which they rely for their argument that the market administrator acting on behalf of the Secretary of Agriculture 
controls the volume of milk pooled on an order and misstate the provisions of the statute. "
1478,*," The Honorable Christopher A. Boyko, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Ohio, sitting by designation. "
1483,1," Finally, though this issue was not raised by NCAA, we find an additional  [**20] ground for dismissal of Bassett's antitrust claim. 
Paragraph 52 of Appellant's Complaint states, The NCAA, SEC and the UKAA conspired to prevent Coach Bassett from coaching at any of the NCAA's over 1200 
member schools. This conspiracy violates the Sherman Antitrust Act (15 U.S.C. § s1-2) and the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. § 
15) as an unlawful group boycott of Coach Bassett. In banning Coach Bassett from coaching, these defendants violated the 
letter and spirit of the NCAA rules designed to afford Coach Bassett due process in defending himself against the rules 
violations that led to the ban. (Emphasis added). As alleged in Bassett's Complaint, it is the conspiracy of three parties-NCAA, the SEC and the UKAA-that resulted in the claimed 
violation of the Sherman Act and constitutes a group boycott. (Notably, Bassett has not alleged a conspiracy between NCAA's 
member institutions.) However, once the district court dismissed Bassett's antitrust conspiracy claims against NCAA's alleged 
co-conspirators, the SEC and the UKAA, Bassett's antitrust conspiracy claim against NCAA failed because, as Bassett himself 
recognizes, a conspiracy requires more than one conspirator. Moreover, by failing to  [**21] appeal the dismissal of his antitrust 
claims against the SEC and the UKAA, Bassett has effectively abandoned his antitrust conspiracy claim against NCAA. In other 
words, Bassett's failure to contest the dismissal of his claims against NCAA's alleged co-conspirators means that he is asking 
this Court to find that, despite the absence of any co-conspirators, he has still alleged that NCAA was involved in a conspiracy. 
Bassett would then have us remand this case to the district court so that it could preside over a conspiracy claim with only one 
conspirator, NCAA. We cannot logically entertain such arguments. "
1487,1," In reviewing a motion to dismiss, all well-pleaded facts in the plaintiff's complaint and all reasonable inferences drawn from 
those facts must be taken as true. See, e.g., Jackson v. Okaloosa County, Fla., 21 F.3d 1531, 1534 (11th Cir. 1994). ""As a "
1488,," general rule, conclusory allegations and unwarranted deductions of fact are not admitted as true in a motion to dismiss."" S. Fla. 
Water Mgmt. Dist. v. Montalvo, 84 F.3d 402, 409 n.10 (11th Cir. 1996)."
1488,2, Nussdorf is described in the SAC as the CEO of Quality King since 1996.
1488,3," Fragrance Brand, LLC is described in the SAC as a single-purpose entity formed by Nussdorf to tender a bid for the license."
1488,4, Oscar Feldenkreis is described in the SAC as the President and COO of Perry Ellis. 
1489,5," Garcia is described in the SAC as a person who ""has been involved in various aspects of the fragrance industry for many 
years."""
1489,6," Lekach is described in the SAC as the chairman and CEO of Parlux from 1993 until his resignation on February 6, 2007. He 
remains a consultant to Parlux. "
1490,7," Several Defendants argue that Victory does not possess standing because it has not alleged an antitrust injury — i.e. an injury 
""of the type the antitrust laws were designed to prevent."" Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 489, 97 S. 
Ct. 690, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977). But the Eleventh Circuit has stated that when a Court believes a plaintiff has failed to prove 
any anticompetitive effect resulting from defendants' behavior, then it should decide the case based on the merits rather than on 
standing. Levine v. Cent. Fla. Med. Affiliates, 72 F.3d 1538, 1545 (11th Cir. 1996)."
1490,8," At oral argument on June 4, 2008, counsel for Victory acknowledged that it is alleging only a per se violation. Thus, if Victory 
has not alleged facts sufficient to state a claim for a per se violation, the Court need not undertake the more probing rule-of-
reason analysis."
1490,9," The terms ""concerted refusal to deal"" and ""group boycott"" are generally used interchangeably in the case law. "
1491,10," At oral argument, Victory's counsel conceded that the relevant market was the worldwide fragrance market. "
1493,11," As the Court noted supra, note 8, Victory concedes that it can only proceed with its antitrust claim on the basis of a per se 
analysis and does not or cannot allege a rule-of-reason claim. Therefore, any amendment on its antitrust claim would be futile. "
1497,1," Plaintiff subsequently filed its Motion for Preliminary Injunction on March 3, 2008. Because the court granted Defendant and 
Matson Navigation's Motion to Dismiss the First Amended Complaint, the court did not address Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary 
Injunction."
1497,2," In its April 9, 2008 Order, the court declined to address how Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 
L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007), affects the Rule 12(b)(6) standard of review due to lack of guidance provided by the Ninth Circuit and 
because such analysis was not necessary to the court's determination of the issues presented. See McCabe Hamilton & Renny 
Co. v. Matson Navigation Co., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67276, 2008 WL 2233740, at *2 n.2 (D. Haw. Apr. 9, 2008) (discussing 
cases). More recently, the Ninth Circuit has adopted and applied Bell Atlantic's plausibility standard to various types of claims 
beyond those specifically addressed in Bell Atlantic. See, e.g., Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Co. v. An Exclusive Gas 
Storage Leasehold & Easement, 524 F.3d 1090, 1094 (9th Cir. 2008); Williams ex rel. Tabiu v. Gerber Prods. Co., 523 F.3d 934, 
938 (9th Cir. 2008);  [*8] Alvarez v. Hill, 518 F.3d 1152, 1157 (9th Cir. 2008); SFPP, L.P. v. Union Pac. R. Co., 274 Fed. Appx. 
549, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 8694, 2008 WL 1776473, at *1 (9th Cir. Apr. 18, 2008); Weber v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, 521 
F.3d 1061, 1066 (9th Cir. 2008). The court therefore applies the Bell Atlantic standard here. "
1498,3," As explained in the April 9, 2008 Order, ""antitrust injury"" is a necessary element of ""antitrust standing."" See McCabe Hamilton 
& Renny Co., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67276, 2008 WL 2233740, at *3. "
1499,4," Defendant cites to Agency Development, Inc. v. Med America Insurance Co., 310 F. Supp. 2d 538 (W.D.N.Y.), as addressing 
this element. Agency Development did not address whether a plaintiff can allege an antitrust injury, and instead found that 
summary judgment should be granted because all that the plaintiff had shown is harm by a competitor, not harm to competition. 
Agency Dev., Inc., 310 F. Supp. 2d at 545. For purposes of this motion, the court accepts the allegations of the SAC as true, and 
as discussed below, finds that it alleges harm to competition."
1499,5," In comparison, the FAC alleged that Defendant ""provides stevedoring and related services but not in direct competition with 
McCabe on Oahu."" FAC P 7. Because the court dismissed the FAC, Plaintiff is not judicially estopped from alleging a contrary 
position. See New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 749, 121 S. Ct. 1808, 149 L. Ed. 2d 968 (2001) (""[W]here a party 
assumes a certain position in a legal proceeding, and succeeds in maintaining that position, he may not thereafter, simply 
because his interests have changed, assume a contrary position."" (citations omitted)). "
1500,6," The SAC includes no statement that Defendant is currently using Plaintiff's employees, even though both parties allude 
 [*19] to this fact. See Pl.'s Opp'n 11; Def.'s Reply 10. For purposes of this motion, the court limits its analysis to the allegations 
contained in the SAC."
1500,7," The SAC alleges only that Defendant ""will at many times (for about 40% of the time that it operates) not use all of the 108 
longshoremen that it is trying to hire from"" Plaintiff. SAC P 19. Defendant asserts that this statement shows a clear nonuse in 
fact of employees. Def.'s Opp'n 8. The court disagrees. This sentence could be interpreted to mean that Defendant will fail to 
use only one employee 40% of the time. Further, this sentence establishes that for 60% of the time, all employees are being 
used, which is indeed a use in fact. "
1503,8," The SAC does not specifically allege that Defendant has a dominant share of the relevant market, and the court assumes that 
Plaintiff relies on its conclusory allegations regarding monopoly power as establishing dominant market share."
1503,9," This ruling does not affect the court's discretion to maintain jurisdiction over any state claims that Plaintiff may allege in a Third 
Amended Complaint. If  [*31] Plaintiff chooses to file a Third Amended Complaint that includes state law claims, however, 
Plaintiff is reminded of Bell Atlantic's requirement that Plaintiff plead more than conclusory statements. "
1522,1," For example, Toledo's expert economist, Frank Gollop, testified that ""Mack [has] market power in both the heavy duty 
vocational [low cab over engine truck market,] as well as conventional straight truck markets, whether you look at the U.S. 
 [**4] as a whole or the U.S., excluding the west."" (App. at A1676; see infra note 16). "
1523,2," The present case is not the first time Toledo and Mack have sparred over the antitrust implications of Mack's approach to 
providing sales assistance. Between March 1988 and October 1990, Toledo's attorney sent several letters to Mack claiming that 
Mack's conduct violated § 1 of the Sherman Act. In 1991, Toledo and Mack signed a release which read: ""Each of Mack and 
Toledo hereby fully releases … the other … from any and all claims, demands, losses, expenses, action, cause of action, or 
liabilities whatsoever arising out of or in connection with sales  [**8] assistance … claimed, requested, approved, paid, credited, 
or rescinded as of the date of this release … ."" (App. at A4460-61.) "
1524,3," Over the course of several years, Yeager had secretly recorded a number of telephone conversations between himself and 
various Mack executives, and those recordings featured prominently in Toledo's evidence at trial."
1524,4," The NDAC consists of two Mack executives and seven dealers. The NDAC's dealer members are elected by their peers at an 
annual dealers meeting. Two of the seven dealer representatives serve as NDAC's Chairman and Vice Chairman, and the 
remaining five serve as representatives for five geographic regions. "
1525,5," Of course, on this and other points, Mack introduced evidence to contradict Toledo's evidence. For example, Mack provided 
evidence to support its argument that Bulletin 38-89 was solely the product of Mack management's decision-making, not the 
NDAC's. Bob Nuss, who was the NDAC Chairman during 1989, testified that, on May 8, 1989, Mack presented a draft of Bulletin 
38-89 to the dealers at an NDAC meeting. According to Nuss, the draft included provisions eliminating sales assistance for out-
of-AOR sales and provisions providing that Mack would give dealers sales assistance on one- and two- truck deals. Nuss also 
testified that ""[t]he new truck retail pricing policy was discussed thoroughly""(App. at A2197), and that while the dealers had 
insisted that Bulletin 38-89 include sales assistance on one- and two-truck deals, the decision to eliminate  [**15] sales 
assistance on out-of-AOR sales was made by Mack alone. Finally, Nuss testified that, although Mack solicited comments on 
Bulletin 38-89 from NDAC members, the final language in Bulletin 38-89 which eliminated sales assistance on out-of-AOR sales 
was identical to the language in the draft proposal circulated at the May 8, 1989 meeting. Mack's evidence, however, does not 
override our obligation to view the evidence in the light most favorable to Toledo. See Northview Motors, 227 F.3d at 88 
(explaining thatHN3[
]  judgment as a matter of law is appropriate ""only if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to 
the nonmovant and giving it the advantage of every fair and reasonable inference, there is insufficient evidence from which a jury 
reasonably could find liability"") (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)."
1525,6," A Mack dealer would ordinarily have little difficulty selling a truck it had bought from Mack because, as we have explained, 
Mack trucks are specialized, custom-made goods and a dealer ordinarily does not purchase a truck from Mack until a customer 
actually places an order with the dealer. However, Yeager explained to Flaherty during their conversation that Toledo had 
ordered the three trucks discussed above because Mack ""was in bad need of orders at that time"" and had ""encouraged [Toledo] 
to place an order."" (App. at A4087.) "
1527,7," Because of the 1991 release between it and Mack, (see supra note 2) Toledo limited its 2002 claims to ""conduct by Mack 
subsequent to the date of the release."" (Appellant Br. at 16-17) (emphasis added). "
1528,8," HN5[
] Collusion between a manufacturer and its dealers to keep a product's price artificially high is likely to be an unusual 
phenomenon because other manufacturers  [**26] and dealers of the same or substitute products can, simply by selling at a 
lower price, render the colluding parties' agreement economically unwise. See Phillip E. Areeda, Herbert Hovenkamp, 
Fundamentals of Antitrust Law § 1603f (3d ed. 2007) (explaining that ""[d]ealers cannot win excess profit through a distribution 
restraint unless a manufacturer who [agrees to assist] them has sufficient market power to make a restriction on output feasible 
and profitable.""). However, collusion between manufacturers and dealers is feasible when one manufacturer dominates the 
market, or when all manufacturers in the market enter into agreements with their dealers to keep prices artificially high. Id. §§ 
16.03f3, 16.03f4. As discussed more fully herein, infra at 37-41, such collusive agreements may be unlawful under the rule of 
reason analysis applied to vertical price restraints under § 1. See, e.g., Leegin Creative Leather Prods., Inc., v. PSKS, Inc., 551 
U.S. 877, 127 S. Ct. 2705, 2717, 168 L. Ed. 2d 623 (2007) (explaining that ""[t]o the extent a vertical agreement setting minimum 
resale prices is entered upon to facilitate [a dealer] cartel, it … would need to be held unlawful under the rule of reason""). "
1529,9," Both in its brief and at oral argument, Mack argued that the District Court's decision was correct because Toledo's evidence 
and the inferences that could be drawn from that evidence would not allow a jury to conclude that any illegal conspiracy ever 
existed or, alternatively, that any conspiracy continued in effect during the limitations period. By its own terms, however, that 
argument is about the sufficiency of Toledo's evidence, not about the legal rules governing continuing conspiracy cases under § 
1. In a related argument, Mack contends that the 1991 release between it and Toledo, see supra note 2, bars Toledo's § 1 claim. 
We disagree. The release does not apply to claims for antitrust damages based on events which occur after the execution of the 
release. Cf. Three Rivers Motor Co. v. Ford Motor Co., 522 F.2d 885, 896 n.27 (3d Cir. 1975) (holding that HN8[
] parties may 
not waive liability for future antitrust violations). Although the release prevents Toledo from seeking damages for events that 
occurred before 1991,  [**31] Mack cites no authority, nor have we found any, for the proposition that a release prevents a party 
from relying on events that occurred prior to the signing of the release to establish facts necessary to show a continuing 
conspiracy. "
1530,10," We have held that HN13[
] the strictures on circumstantial evidence in antitrust cases only appl[y] when the plaintiff has failed to put forth direct evidence of conspiracy. Thus, in direct evidence cases, the 
plaintiff need not adduce circumstantial evidence that tends to exclude the possibility that the alleged conspirators acted 
independently, and there need not be an inquiry into the plausibility of the defendants' claim or the rationality of defendants' 
economic motives. This is because when the plaintiff has put forth direct evidence of conspiracy, the fact finder is not 
required to make inferences to establish facts, and therefore the Supreme Court's concerns over the reasonableness of 
inferences in antitrust cases evaporate. Rossi, 156 F.3d at 466. "
1531,11," Consistent with our earlier discussion of the  [**38] principles governing continuing conspiracy cases, we note that Toledo's 
evidence of agreements between dealers includes statements about events that took place in the 1980s, outside the limitations 
period, as well as later statements and evidence about the existence of horizontal agreements. "
1532,12," We reiterate that, under Rossi, we need not apply the strictures on inferences drawn from ambiguous circumstantial evidence 
that would apply in the absence of direct evidence of a conspiracy. Nevertheless, in addition to Toledo's direct evidence of an 
agreement between the dealers and Mack, Toledo had indirect evidence of that conspiracy, including its evidence that Mack 
acted contrary to its own stated policy of allowing out-of-AOR sales. Even under Monsanto's limitations on inferences from 
circumstantial evidence, that evidence appears to have been sufficient to create a jury question as to whether there was an 
agreement between Mack and its dealers. "
1533,13," Mack argues that its decision to withdraw Bulletin 38-89 and replace it with an official policy permitting out-of-AOR sales 
demonstrates that it withdrew from any conspiracy that had existed earlier in 1989. HN16[
] Whether Mack withdrew from a 
conspiracy, however, is a jury question. Cf. United States v. Lowell, 649 F.2d 950, 956 (3d Cir. 1981) (""[T]he question of 
withdrawal is for the finder of fact.""). "
1534,14," Lusty also testified that in 2001, Yelles told him that he ""kn[ew] what [Toledo] [was] trying to do. [Toledo] wants to establish 
discounts and sell trucks all over the place. We are not going to let this happen."" (App. at A2824.) Lusty also testified that in 
2002, Yelles told him that Yeager was ""just soliciting customers on price … we have to beat the living shit out of him. … [H]e is a 
son of a bitch."" (App. at A2818.) Finally, Yelles himself testified that, on at least one occasion in 2003, he asked Mack's 
Controller  [**50] to delay approving Toledo's request for sales assistance so that a different Mack dealer could make a sale."
1534,15," We note that in Rossi we characterized the agreement at issue as horizontal and subject to per se analysis even though 
Rossi, like Toledo here, alleged that his direct competitors conspired with each other and with a common manufacturer to cut off 
his access to customers. 156 F.3d at 458, 461-62. At that time, agreements to set minimum resale prices were per se unlawful 
under § 1. See id. (""We agree with defendants that if this were simply a vertical conspiracy, between one horizontal competitor 
and one supplier or manufacturer, we would analyze it under the  [**52] rule of reason unless there were some evidence of price 
fixing."") (emphasis added). After Leegin, HN19[
] vertical agreements to set prices are no longer per se unlawful but subject to 
the rule of reason. 127 S. Ct. at 2725. In light of Leegin, we conclude that the rule of reason, not per se analysis, applies to the 
vertical agreement Toledo alleges was in existence here. Cf. United States v. Fisher, 502 F.3d 293, 296 (3d Cir. 2007) (citation 
omitted) (explaining that while a panel of this Court is ordinarily bound by the decision of a prior panel, a subsequent panel may 
depart from a previous panel's decision if required to do so by an intervening Supreme Court decision). "
1535,16, That assertion was supported by an analysis we need not recount here. 
1537,17," One might complain that this reasoning elevates form over substance, but we are bound by precedent and think it no injustice 
to narrowly interpret the oft-questioned RPA. Cf. Antitrust Modernization Commission, Report and Recommendations, April 
2007, at iii, 317-26 (recommendation by statutory commission, whose members were appointed by the President and Congress, 
that the RPA be repealed in its entirety). "
1538,18," In addition, we note that Toledo initially denied the existence of the contract  [**65] it now uses to invoke the ""gist of the action"" 
doctrine. Toledo cannot properly change its position now. Tops Apparel Mfg. Co. v. Rothman, 430 Pa. 583, 244 A.2d 436, 439 
n.8 (Pa. 1968)(HN30[
] ""When a [party] alleges a fact in a court of justice, for [its] advantage, [it] shall not be allowed to 
contradict it afterwards."") "
1545,1," According to a 2000 report from the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, ""In 1910, 58% of U.S. cities had more than 
one competing daily newspaper …. Today, of the 1,400 cities that have a local daily newspaper of general circulation, fewer than 
20 have more than one."" (Rep. of Asst. Att. Gen. at Attach. C, Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss). The accuracy of the ""fewer than 20"" figure 
is doubtful inasmuch as West Virginia alone has 2 dailies in each of the three cities of Charleston,  [**3] Wheeling, and 
Parkersburg. West Virginia Legislature, Senate Clerk's Office, West Virginia Blue Book 735-36 (2007). Many daily newspapers find it increasingly difficult to compete in a media market so radically altered by the shift of readers and 
advertising dollars to the Internet. See Richard Perez-Pena, An Industry Imperiled by Falling Profits and Shrinking Ads, New 
York Times (Feb. 7, 2008)."

1548,3," Defendants also discuss Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting, 441 U.S. 1, 99 S. Ct. 1551, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1979), 
and Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Society, 457 U.S. 332, 102 S. Ct. 2466, 73 L. Ed. 2d 48 (1982), as instances when the

financial risks and rewards for the products they produce, they have lawfully eliminated competition between themselves by 
becoming a single economic entity."" (Defs.' Memo. in Supp. at 16). They further contend, however, that Dagher ""removed any 
doubt that this is the case."" (Id.) "
1549,4," Last Term the Supreme Court explained the meaning ascribed to the per se rule and the counterpart rule of reason that inform 
application of the Sherman Act: HN13[
] The rule of reason is the accepted standard for testing whether a practice restrains  [**16] trade in violation of § 1 [of the Sherman Act]. ""Under this rule, the factfinder weighs all of the circumstances of a case in deciding whether a 
restrictive practice should be prohibited as imposing an unreasonable restraint on competition."" . . The rule of reason does not govern all restraints. Some types ""are deemed unlawful per se."" The per se rule, treating 
categories of restraints as necessarily illegal, eliminates the need to study the reasonableness of an individual restraint in 
light of the real market forces at work …. Restraints that are per se unlawful include horizontal agreements among 
competitors to fix prices or to divide markets. Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U.S. 877, 127 S.Ct. 2705, 2712-13, 168 L. Ed. 2d 623 (2007) 
(citations omitted)."
1549,5," In addressing this very case, several commentators within a lengthy, joint article observed as follows: If Defendants [Gazette Company and MediaNews] prevail on the Motion to Dismiss, this would seem to be a judicial holding 
that one of the newspapers in a JOA may be eliminated by the parties without the government even being given the 
opportunity to discover the facts and circumstances. This would grant JOA owners a freedom and certainty they arguably 
do not presently possess. Practising Law Institute, Conrad M. Shumadine et al., Antitrust and the Media, 917 PLI/Pat 393, 410 (Nov. 2007). The authors 
additionally assert that ""[s]ome of those who would argue for a broad right to close one of the two newspapers in a JOA might 
also agree that the facts and circumstances should be subject to discovery and judicial scrutiny of the facts."" Id."
1549,6," Although not a source suggested by the parties, the commonly available website known as californiagasprices.com shows 
each of these retail gasoline brands are sold in California along with Shell and Texaco. "
1557,1," Food Movers does not contend that  [*6] judgment on the pleadings is precluded by its other asserted defenses: failure to state 
a claim, lack of personal jurisdiction, and improper venue. However, the Court nonetheless notes that these defenses would not 
bar entry of judgment on the pleadings. First, Food Movers cannot argue that Diamond Crystal failed to state a claim where 
Food Movers admits that it received and failed to pay for two shipments of Splenda. Second, Food Movers' defense based upon 
lack of personal jurisdiction was denied by this Court on August 3, 2007. Finally, the defense of improper venue was waived 
when it was not asserted in Food Movers' first responsive pleading, and the motion for transfer of venue was also denied."
1557,2," ""If a party mistakenly designates . . . a counterclaim as a defense, the court must, if justice requires, treat the pleading  [*8] as 
though it were correctly designated ."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c)(2); see also Gouldstone v. Life Investors Ins. Co. of Am., 236 Ga. App. 
813, 514 S.E.2d 54 (1999)(breach of contract claim put forth as both affirmative defense and basis for counterclaim ""must be 
asserted as a counterclaim rather than a defense""). "
1558,3," In its Answer and Counterclaim, Food Movers denies owing any amount because of Diamond Crystal's ""breach of other 
contracts for the sale of goods."" (Def.'s First Amended Answer and Counterclaim, at 2)(emphasis added). To the extent that 
Food Movers attempts to construe separate contractual obligations as events within a broader contract, (Id. at 6-7, 10), it is 
stating a legal conclusion that need not be credited in a motion for judgment on the pleadings. See Kohen v. Crocker Co., 260 
F.2d 790, 792 (5th Cir. 1958)."
1558,4," If a party's answer treats a claim for setoff as a defense, a court may recast the claim for setoff as a counterclaim. Fed. R. Civ.

1561,1," Of the numerous defendants named in relator Richard F. Miller's (""Miller"") original complaint, seven proceeded to trial last 
spring: individual defendants Bill L. Harbert (""Harbert"") and E. Roy Anderson (""Anderson""); and corporate defendants Harbert 
Corporation (""HC""), Harbert International, Inc. (""HII""), Bill Harbert International Construction, Inc. (""BHIC""), Bilhar International 
Establishment f/k/a Harbert International Establishment (""Bilhar"" or ""HIE""), and Harbert Construction Services (U.K.) Ltd. 
(""HUK""). The Court dismissed plaintiffs' claims against Harbert on April 27,  [**6] 2007, on statute of limitations grounds. (See 
Order of May 4, 2007 [854], at 3.)"
1561,2," Relator filed his original complaint under seal on June 30, 1995. The government then spent nearly six years investigating his 
allegations. Judge William B. Bryant unsealed the case on February 12, 2001. Another five years passed before the case was 
reassigned to this Court, on December 2, 2005. After allowing just over one year for discovery and pretrial proceedings, this 
Court commenced trial on March 19, 2007."
1561,3," The jury apportioned damages among the three contracts at issue as follows: $ 29,920,000.00 on Contract 20A, $ 
3,400,000.00 on Contract 29, and $ 1,026,029.22 on Contract 07. (Verdict Form [858] at 9, 10, 12.) In accordance with 31 
U.S.C. section 3729(a), the Court then trebled the damages award for each contract. (Mem. Op. of Aug. 10, 2007 [882] at 11.) 
The Court next set off amounts the government received from settling co-defendants, apportioning the $ 13.7 million total across 
the three contracts. (Id. at 10-11.) It further determined the appropriate civil penalty to be $ 10,000 per false claim, yielding a 
total penalty of $ 1,100,000.00. (Id. at 7-9, 11.) The Court calculated the total liability  [**7] in this case -- the sum of the trebled 
damages and civil penalties -- to be $ 90,438,087.66, for which defendants BHIC, HII, HC, and Bilhar are jointly and severally 
liable. (Id. at 11.) Because the jury found defendant HUK liable on only Contract 20A, it shared joint and several liability on $ 
78,825,454.00 of this amount. (Id.) Finally, because the Court had dismissed all claims against defendant Anderson save one on 
statute of limitations grounds, he shared joint and several liability in the amount of $ 149,615.20. (Id. at 11-12.)"
1561,4," For  [**8] convenience and brevity, the Court will cite the parties' motions as follows: Anderson's Post-Judgment Motions [893] 
(""Motion One""); HII's Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law [894] (""Motion Two""); HC's Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law 
[895] (""Motion Three""); BHIC and HUK's Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law [896] (""Motion Four""); HII and HC's Motion for a 
New Trial as to All Claims [897] (""Motion Five""); Bilhar's Motion for Post-Trial Judgment as a Matter of Law, or in the Alternative, 
for a New Trial [898] (""Motion Six""); BHIC and HUK's Motion to Alter, Amend, or Vacate the Judgment [899, 901] (""Motion 
Seven""); and BHIC and HUK's Motion for New Trial [900, 904] (""Motion Eight""). Corresponding opposition briefs and replies will 
be similarly numbered. Where appropriate, the Court will indicate which defendant(s) make(s) which arguments, but in large part, defendants have 
incorporated one another's arguments by reference. (E.g., Motion Two at 1 n.1 (joining arguments and requests for relief in 
Motion Eight, Sections I-IV; Motion Four, Sections IV-VI; Motion Seven, Sections I-II, IV; and Motion One, Sections 1-5); Motion 
Three at 1 n. 1 (incorporating same arguments and requests,  [**9] along with those made by HII in Motion Two); Motion Six at 1 
(adopting ""all other contentions made by all other defendants in their respective post-trial motions"").) "
1563,5," Defendants also challenge this Court's refusal to strike testimony given by Rainer Hermann at defendant Anderson's criminal 
trial, which this Court admitted against Anderson, alone, under Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(1). (Mem. Op. & Order of Mar. 
16, 2007 [722] at 4-7.) They contend this evidence was relevant only to plaintiffs' claims concerning Contracts 20A and 07, and 
that once this Court dismissed those claims against Anderson on statute of limitations grounds, it should have stricken the 
testimony. (Motion Five at 10.) They further insist the jury must have erroneously predicated its verdict against the other 
defendants on Hermann's testimony because it ""was the sole source of first-hand evidence that Holzmann actually paid a loser's 
fee to [Bilfinger & Berger] on Contract 07."" (Id.) This claim lacks merit for two reasons. First, while Hermann's testimony may have been the only first-hand evidence of the 
loser's fee, it was not the only evidence. Werner Hoffmeister subsequently testified that ""after several discussions, Holzmann 
paid the loser's fee"" of 1.5 million dollars or deutschmarks. (Mar. 22, 2007 PM Tr. at 68-70, 86-87.) To the extent the jury 
considered  [**15] the Hermann testimony against the other defendants, it was merely cumulative of other evidence. Second, and more fundamentally, this Court twice instructed the jury that it should consider Hermann's testimony only against 
Anderson. (Mar. 22, 2007 PM Tr. at 101; May 4, 2007 AM Tr. at 42-43.) While defendants dismiss this notion as ""pure 
sophistry,"" (Reply Five at 7), the law presumes that jurors follow their instructions, see, e.g., Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200, 
206, 107 S. Ct. 1702, 95 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1987) (citing ""the almost invariable assumption of the law that jurors follow their 
instructions""). Defendants' internally inconsistent argument does not persuade the Court to abandon this bedrock presumption. 
They contend ""the only way the Court could have assured the jury . . . would not misuse the Hermann testimony"" -- in violation of 
this Court's repeated limiting instruction -- ""was to strike it"" -- by issuing yet another instruction. (Reply Five at 8.) Defendants do 
not elaborate on why they believe the jury would wholly disregard one instruction but adhere scrupulously to another, and the 
distinction is not evident to the Court. For these reasons, the Court concludes any error in its refusal to strike the Hermann  [**16] testimony after dismissing the 
Contract 20A and 07 claims against Anderson was harmless. "
1564,6," The ""same parties"" requirement was crucial to the Otherson court's attempt to reconcile other circuits' extension of issue 
preclusion to facts established by a guilty plea, with apparently contrary dicta in a recent U. S. Supreme Court decision. 711 F.2d 
at 275 n.8, 277 n. 11. The court ultimately identified ""a middle ground"" in which a plea's preclusive effect would turn on whether 
the government, as opposed to a new party, sought to invoke preclusion in the later civil action. Id. at 277 n.11. This distinction 
makes particular sense where in the second trial, ""the government [is] enforcing . . . a form of civil relief arising out of the original 
crime"" because such ""a  [**18] claim [] would presumably have been barred the second time under claim preclusion were 
criminal courts not specialized tribunals."" Id. Here, because the United States is a plaintiff and seeks civil relief for harm arising 
from the Sherman Act conspiracy, the ""same parties"" requirement is clearly satisfied."
1564,7," Bilhar briefly contends preclusion was erroneous here because ""[t]he claims in the criminal and the instant civil case were not 
identical."" (Motion Six at 2.) While Bilhar is, indeed, correct that a Sherman Act conspiracy need not involve submission of any 
false statement to the government, its assertion nonetheless misses the mark. The collateral estoppel doctrine requires merely 
identity of issues, not identity of claims. See Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 27 (1982)."
1564,8," See also Harrison v. Westinghouse Savannah River Co., 176 F.3d 776, 787-88 (4th Cir. 1999) (collecting cases in which FCA 
liability was imposed for claims submitted under contracts originally obtained through false statements or fraudulent conduct); 
United States ex rel. Alexander v. Dyncorp, Inc., 924 F. Supp. 292, 298 (D.D.C. 1996) (Harris, J.) (stating that if defendant 
obtained government contract fraudulently, as  [**21] complaint alleged, ""then all claims submitted under the contract are 
fraudulent""). "
1565,9," The defendant's overt acknowledgment or validation of these facts adds to their reliability. In International Telecommunications 
Satellite Organization v. Colino, No. 88-1266, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4887 (D.D.C. Apr. 15, 1992) (Lamberth,  [**23] J.), the 
defendant had pleaded guilty to interstate transportation of money taken by fraud, and after reviewing the factual proffer filed in 
connection with the charges, he specifically admitted to certain facts contained therein. 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4887, at *19. In a 
subsequent civil suit brought by the victim, this Court held Colino could not deny ""the facts supporting his conviction as they 
[were] contained in the factual proffer reviewed and accepted by him."" Id. (emphasis added). Similarly, where a defendant meticulously edited his indictment before pleading guilty to selected portions, the Second Circuit 
Court of Appeals concluded his plea's collateral estoppel effect could extend to those facts alleged in the indictment. United 
States v. Podell, 572 F.2d 31, 36 (2d Cir. 1978). The court explained: Podell carefully struck the portions of the indictment to which he did not desire to plead guilty, even deleting language in the 
crucial paragraph in this case - paragraph 5(c) of Count One. We conclude that by exhibiting such painstaking care to 
remove particular language from Paragraph 5(c), Podell in effect and, indeed, in actuality, admitted the truth of the 
remainder of the paragraph's  [**24] allegations . . . . This conclusion is bolstered by Podell's statement in open court during 
the guilty plea allocution that he was pleading guilty to the selected portions of the indictment. Id. at 36 & n. 11."
1565,10," Cf. Alsco-Harvard Fraud Litig., 523 F. Supp. at 804 (holding U.S. could not use defendants' general conspiracy  [**25] plea ""as 
a catch-all for conclusively establishing the specific manner by which that conspiracy was effectuated, even though a recital of 
the alleged scheme [was] included in . . . the indictment""). "
1566,11," Judge Green followed an analogous approach in giving preclusive effect to a jury verdict in United States v. Uzzell. There, a 
jury had convicted the defendants of criminal conspiracy to defraud the United States, which required an overt act. See 648 F. 
Supp. at 1365. In a subsequent FCA action, the United States sought to preclude the defendants from contesting their liability 
based on four of the thirty-nine overt acts alleged in the indictment count on which they had been convicted. Id. at 1363, 1364. 
The defendants argued that the jury may have premised its verdict on only one of those overt acts. Id. at 1365. But after 
""examin[ing] the record to determine exactly what was decided in the criminal proceeding,"" Judge Green found ""nothing . . . 
indicate[d] that anything less than all of the specific acts alleged in the count were determined by the jury in reaching [its] 
verdict."" Id. at 1364, 1365. She thus held the conviction conclusively established the defendants had committed all thirty-nine 
 [**26] acts, including the four which comprised FCA violations. See id. at 1366."
1566,12," The government's complaint also alleged a conspiracy under 31 U.S.C. section 3129(a)(3), and the Szilvagyi court 
 [**27] found the plea to health care and mail fraud conspiracy necessarily embraced the elements of this claim. See 398 F. 
Supp. 2d at 848."
1566,13," Bilhar may not avoid collateral estoppel by claiming the memorandum ""does not specifically state . . . that Bilhar itself 
committed any particular one of the listed acts."" (Reply Six at 9.) Under the civil counterpart to the venerable Pinkerton rule, once [a] conspiracy has been formed,  [**28] all its members are liable for injuries caused by acts pursuant to or in 
furtherance of the conspiracy. A conspirator need not participate actively in or benefit from the wrongful action in order to be 
found liable . . . so long as the purpose . . . was to advance the overall object of the conspiracy. Halberstam v. Welch, 227 U.S. App. D.C. 167, 705 F.2d 472, 481 (D.C. Cir. 1983)."
1566,14," Equitable principles lend further support to this conclusion: Where a party assumes a certain legal position in a proceeding, and succeeds in maintaining that position, he may not 
thereafter, simply because his interests have changed, assume a contrary position, especially if it be to the prejudice of the 
party who has acquiesced in the position formerly taken by him. Davis v. Wakelee, 156 U.S. 680, 689, 15 S. Ct. 555, 39 L. Ed. 578 (1895). This equitable doctrine, judicial estoppel, does not automatically apply to facts admitted in a guilty plea colloquy. Thore v. Howe, 
466 F.3d 173, 185 (1st Cir. 2006). Rather, courts may invoke judicial estoppel at their discretion. New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 "
1567,," U.S. 742, 750, 121 S. Ct. 1808, 149 L. Ed. 2d 968 (2001). See also Thore, 466 F.3d at 187 (after reviewing for abuse of 
discretion, affirming district court's application of judicial estoppel based on defendant's  [**29] statements at the time he pleaded 
guilty). Considerations relevant to this exercise of discretion include: (1) whether the party's present position is clearly inconsistent with 
its previous position; (2) whether the party ""succeeded in persuading a court to accept the party's earlier position""; and (3) 
whether ""the party seeking to assert an inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on 
the opposing party if not estopped."" New Hampshire, 532 U.S. at 750-51. Here, in entering its guilty plea, Bilhar acknowledged that it and/or its co-conspirators had performed specific, overt acts in 
furtherance of the bid-rigging conspiracy. (See Ex. B to Pl.'s Mot. [558] at 5.) First, if permitted to contest liability in the False 
Claims case, Bilhar would (presumably) have adopted a contrary stance: in essence, though it had agreed with others to rig bids 
on Contracts 20A, 29, and 07, nothing had come of this pact. Such a position would be ""clearly inconsistent with"" its admissions 
in the Rule 11 memorandum. See 532 U.S. at 750. Second, in accepting Bilhar's guilty plea, to fulfill its duties under Rule 11, the criminal court must have relied on Bilhar's 
representations;  [**30] thus, Bilhar ""succeeded in persuading [that] court to accept [its] earlier position."" See id. Third and finally, if not estopped from assuming a contrary position here, Bilhar would have imposed a significant and unfair 
detriment on the opposing party. See id. at 751. Under the plea agreement, Bilhar negotiated a fine in a specified amount, 
payable over time in installments rather than in one lump sum, and received assurances of non-prosecution for itself and its 
corporate affiliates as well as their current and former directors, officers, and employees. (See Ex. A to Pl.'s Mot. [558] at 5-6, 
10-14.) Having reaped these benefits from its factual admissions, Bilhar may not, now, force the government to expend the 
considerable time and resources that would be required to litigate the very same facts Bilhar has already acknowledged."
1567,15," BHIC and HUK cite several cases for the proposition that because Bilhar could not contest its liability, these documents lacked 
any evidentiary value as to Bilhar. (Motion Eight at 5.) Yet these authorities in no way establish that evidence relevant to 
material, contested issues should be excluded merely because it conclusively establishes other issues. See Sicalides v. Hartford 
Cas. Ins. Co., 94 Fed. Appx. 882, 883 (3d Cir. 2004) (where plaintiffs were estopped from seeking consequential damages, 
evidence of such damages was ""irrelevant because [plaintiffs] would not be permitted under the law to recover them""); United 
States v. United States Currency in Amount of $228,536.00, 895 F.2d 908, 913, 920-21 (2d Cir. 1990) (where defendant was 
estopped from arguing property was seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment, testimony barely material to the existence of 
probable cause would be irrelevant in subsequent civil forfeiture proceeding); Sherrock Bros. v. DaimlerChrysler Motors Co. 
LLC, 465 F. Supp. 2d 384, 387, 391, 394 (M.D. Pa. 2006)  [**33] (where plaintiff was estopped from bringing ultra vires and bad 
faith claims because state courts had fully adjudicated them, evidentiary hearing on these very issues ""would [] be 
meaningless""). "
1568,16," Cf. United States v. Vandetti, 623 F.2d 1144, 1147 (6th Cir. 1980) (mere fact of co-defendant's conviction, alone, was 
irrelevant to defendant's guilt)."
1568,17," Defendants do not explain how these documents could be unfairly prejudicial to Bilhar, and it is not immediately obvious to the 
Court. The facts recited in the plea agreement and Rule 11 memorandum were certainly persuasive evidence, but particularly 
due to these documents' nature, it would not be unfair for the jury to assign great weight to Bilhar's voluntary admissions."
1568,18," Defendants also take issue with the timing of the Court's limiting instruction, insisting it should have been given immediately 
when plaintiffs' counsel mentioned Bilhar's conviction during his opening statement. (Motion Eight at 8.) Opening statements, 
however, are not evidence -- as the jury in this case was instructed. (Mar. 20, 2007 AM Tr. at 25.) This Court gave a limiting 
instruction when the plea agreement and Rule 11 memorandum were actually placed in evidence. (Apr. 10, 2007 PM Tr. at 100.) 
Defendants offer no authority for their contention that instructions limiting a jury's use of evidence should be read three weeks in 
advance of that evidence's introduction. Relatedly,  [**35] HC and HII misconstrue this Court's pre-trial rulings as establishing a ""step-by-step"" procedure under which 
evidence of Bilhar's prior criminal proceeding would be admissible against them only if they challenged the voluntariness of its 
plea. (See Motion Five at 4, 6.) BHIC and HUK apparently share this misconception. (See Motion Eight at 8 n.2.) Consequently, 
they protest plaintiffs' counsel's reference to these proceedings in his opening statement as unfairly prejudicial. As the Court 
clarified in denying defendants' motions for reconsideration, the guilty plea and Rule 11 memorandum were admissible. (Mem. 
Op. & Order of Mar. 20, 2007 [738] at 2.) It is hardly unusual for counsel to preview admissible evidence he intends to present 
during his case-in-chief in an opening statement. Furthermore, defendants' present complaints ring hollow: Bilhar's counsel also 
discussed the prior criminal proceeding in his opening statement -- at far greater length and in much deeper detail than the 
government's counsel -- without drawing an objection from any other defendant. (See Mar. 20, 2007 PM Tr. at 32-34.) Finally, HII also decries government counsel's ""transparent strategem to tar HII with  [**36] the Bilhar guilty plea"" by discussing 
the government's theory of liability for HII immediately following his reference to Bilhar's guilty plea. (Motion Five at 4.) Beneath 
this rhetorical gloss, however, the Court perceives no error. Government counsel simply urged the jury to hold HII accountable 
for its own conduct and not to absolve HII simply because another defendant had admitted guilt. (See Mar. 20, 2007 AM Tr. at 
57 (citing HII's signing contracts and making representations to the U.S. government).) "
1569,19," HII and HC protest the Court's ruling they could not inform the jury that no criminal charges had been filed against them. 
(Motion Five at 9 n.2.) But having been informed that Bilhar had faced criminal charges, and having heard nothing similar as to 
the other defendants, the jurors might well have inferred no other defendant among those present had been charged. This 
inference was surely as reasonable as the competing, allegedly prejudicial, inference that these defendants must have been 
Bilhar's co-conspirators."
1569,20," Defendants somewhat melodramatically characterize the Rule 11 memorandum as ""fraught with criminal words,"" but it is by no 
means surprising or unduly prejudicial that ""criminal words"" should appear in records of a criminal conviction."
1569,21," See, e.g., Gil-De-Rebollo v. Miami Heat Ass'ns, Inc., 137 F.3d 56, 64 (1st Cir. 1998)  [**39] (declaring in personal injury suit 
that ""[u]nder the circumstances, admission of [defendant's] criminal conviction would have allowed the jury to substitute the 
judgment reached in the criminal proceeding for its own,"" where circumstances included: (1) ""jurors were presented with 
sufficient evidence to gauge the seriousness of [defendant's] actions and their effect on the plaintiff""; (2) ""[i]n addition to the 
testimony of the plaintiff and other witnesses, the episode was recorded by a television camera and the tape was made available 
for the jury to watch""; and (3) the jury therefore ""did not need evidence of [defendant's] criminal conviction to assess his role in 
the incident"")."
1569,22," See, e.g., Richardson, 481 U.S. at 206. See also United States v. Boone, 437 F.3d 829, 838 (8th Cir. 2006) (""Where multiple 
defendants are tried together, the risk of undue prejudice is best cured through cautionary instructions to the jury . . . ."")."
1569,23," None of the precedents to which defendants direct the Court's attention suggests -- let alone, compels -- a contrary 
conclusion. See United States v. Berkery, 889 F.2d 1281 (3d Cir. 1989) (ordering new trial on all counts where trial court 
erroneously required  [**40] that sole defendant admit to conspiracy charge to qualify for entrapment instruction, even though 
court had admonished jury that defendant had not admitted related, ""closely intertwined"" substantive charges); Warner v. 
Rossignol, 538 F.2d 910 (1st Cir. 1976) (ordering new trial on damages despite brief curative instruction where ""plaintiff's 
attorney persisted in going beyond the pleadings and the evidence, embroidering upon plaintiff's head injuries and the 
(completely speculative) consequences which might flow from those injuries . . . even after repeated warnings from the judge 
and in a manner . . . calculated to inflame the jury""); Beck v. Wings Field, Inc., 122 F. 2d 114 (3d Cir. 1941) (ordering new trial 
despite curative instruction where plane crash plaintiff's expert witness testified he had personally experienced identical plane 
crash due to same ""ditch"" on defendant's runway). "
1570,24," In fact, courts have even admitted non-parties' guilty pleas against  [**42] civil defendants. See, e.g., RSBI Aerospace, Inc. v. 
Affiliated FM Ins. Co., 49 F.3d 399, 401, 403 (8th Cir. 1995) (non-party employee's guilty plea and accompanying sworn 
statement were admissible against defendant employer in subsequent civil case); Newby v. Enron Corp., 491 F. Supp. 2d 690, 
703 (S.D. Tex. 2007) (non-party's guilty plea was admissible against defendants in subsequent civil case)."
1570,25," Defendants' only authority for this proposition is an unpublished disposition from this Circuit. (See Motion Eight at 6 (citing 
Lemire v. C.I.R., 284 U.S. App. D.C. 78, 901 F.2d 1130 (D.C. Cir. 1990).) In accordance with the Court of  [**43] Appeals' 
instructions, however, the Court declines to rely on it as precedent. D.C. Cir. R. 32.1, 36."
1570,26," Cf. Columbia Plaza Corp. v. Security Nat'l Bank, 219 U.S. App. D.C. 182, 676 F.2d 780, 789-90 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (where jury 
returned general conspiracy verdict, trial court properly determined no overt act charged in indictments was ""essential"" to sustain 
the verdict and thus correctly excluded indictments as inadmissible under Rule 803(22))."
1570,27," Defendants cite abundant authority for the proposition, evident on the Rule's face, that party admissions are non-hearsay only 
when offered against the speaker -- in this case, Bilhar. (See Motion Eight at 7.) The Court did not, and does not, propose to 
hold otherwise. "
1571,28," The Rule exempts statements of a party's co-conspirators during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy, when they 
are offered against the party. Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). Gewin extends the exception to joint venturers' statements during 
 [**45] and in furtherance of the joint venture. 471 F.3d at 201-02."
1571,29," Defendants raise two additional points with which the Court may easily dispose. First, they contend Gewin ""is contrary to the 
plain language of Rule 801(d)(2)(E) and Supreme Court precedent."" (Motion Five at 20.) Whatever else it may be, however, 
Gewin is binding precedent to which this Court must adhere. Second, HC insists it was never a joint venturer, so even if the 
identified statements were admissible under 801(d)(2)(E) against the other defendants, they would nevertheless be inadmissible 
against HC. (Motion Five at 23.) For the reasons explained herein, any error was harmless."
1571,30," Defendants further argue that Davidson's suggestion ""that Miller and Ollis tell their wives what happened . . . in no way 
advanced any Joint Venture interests or any conspiracy."" (Motion Five at 22.) Yet they do not explain, and the Court cannot 
surmise, how so mundane a statement's admission  [**48] could be so irreparably prejudicial as to warrant a new trial."
1571,31," It also appears to the Court that Davidson's statement would have been admissible under Rule 803(3), which excepts 
statements of intention from the hearsay bar. Fed. R. Evid. 803(3) & Advisory Committee's Note. See also Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. 
Hillmon, 145 U.S. 285, 12 S. Ct. 909, 36 L. Ed. 706 (1892) (admitting statement of intention to prove the act intended in fact 
occurred). Plaintiffs do not specifically articulate this ground in their brief, however, so the Court will not address it. "
1572,32," Defendants do not appear to dispute the other required elements of Rule 801(d)(2)(E) -- that Niebergall, a Holzmann 
employee, was a co-conspirator, and that the bid-rigging conspiracy was then ongoing. See Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). "
1573,33," Ollis testified: ""At that time we were discussing our -- the work that we had in various places in Holzmann. We were talking 
about their international work,  [**54] because Linderman and Niebergall were in their International Division, and that's when 
Niebergall told me that he could bid the work for us in Egypt, because he knew the prices before they were submitted."" (Mar. 27, 
2007 PM Tr. at 63.)"
1573,34," Defendants suggest Niebergall was simply flaunting his inside knowledge, but in the cases they cite for this proposition, the 
declarants did not couch their boasts as express offers or invitations, such as Niebergall did here. See Re/Max Int'l, Inc. v. 
Realty One, Inc., 173 F.3d 995, 1011-12 (6th Cir. 1999) (trial court did not clearly err in construing CEO's verbal denial that 
collusive agreement existed, combined with his non-verbal conduct, as mere boasting that such an agreement did exist); United 
States v. Birnbaum, 337 F.2d 490, 494-95 (2d Cir. 1964) (trial court erred in admitting co-conspirator's narrative of defendant's 
""past double-dealing"" to another co-conspirator because it was not made in furtherance of the conspiracy)."
1573,35," As a preliminary matter, whether the statement was made in furtherance of the conspiracy was an issue for the Court to 
decide by a preponderance of the evidence. Bourjaily, 483 U.S. at 175. "
1574,36," (See also Motion Five at 38 (""Defendants' arguments were validated during voir dire of McAfee when he disavowed having 
any specific knowledge about the facts of the case.""); Reply Eight at 14 (""plaintiffs were not entitled to shield McAfee's 
conclusions from scrutiny by blindfolding him and insulating him from any knowledge of the complex facts in this case"").)"
1574,37," See also United States v. Mulder, 273 F.3d 91, 102 (2d Cir. 2001) (""The government is free to offer expert testimony as 
background for an offense""); Strauss Farms, Inc. v. Combs Commodities, Inc., No. 03-4046-RDR, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6965, 
at *3-8 (D. Kan. Mar. 29, 2005) (""[it] is not a requirement of Rule 702, Daubert, or Kuhmo"" that proffered  [**59] expert's scientific 
knowledge be ""specifically applied to the facts of this case"")."
1574,38," Defendants insist McAfee did not confine his testimony to ""general principles"" because he ""offered conclusions regarding the 
'direct costs' of 'cartel behavior.'"" (Reply Eight at 14.) In particular, they take issue with his statements that a cartel bidder must 
""increase the price enough to account for all of the direct costs facing conspirators"" and that such bidders face reduced 
incentives to discover cost-reducing technology prior to bidding. (Apr. 5, 2007 PM Tr. at 84-89, 103.) These statements simply 
described elements of the abstract cartel behavior model McAfee discussed throughout his testimony and did not exceed his 
purview as a ""teaching witness."" Defendants further complain that these supposed costs lack any basis in empirical analysis and 
thus comprise ""nothing more than pure speculation"" or ""common sense in the guise of economic analysis."" (Motion Eight at 23 & 
n.12.) While common sense dictates that those who engage in illegal collusion face a risk of getting caught, an economist looks 
at this risk differently: ""it is part of every economic model that risks have costs . . . [and] bear  [**60] a price."" (Apr. 5, 2007 PM 
Tr. at 100.) McAfee made these risks and their role in pricing explicit, allowing the jurors to assess a cartel participant's bid 
selection as an economist would. His inability to cite an empirical study documenting these costs impacts the weight of this 
evidence, but not its admissibility. "
1575,39," As examples of such general principles, the Advisory Committee's Note cites ""the principles of thermodynamics, or 
bloodclotting, or [] how financial markets respond to corporate reports."" Fed. R. Evid. 702 Advisory Committee's Note. Courts 
have admitted such generalized expert testimony to educate jurors on a wide variety of other subjects. See, e.g., Mulder, 273 
F.3d at 101-02 (labor coalition behavior); United States v. Locascio, 6 F.3d 924, 936 (2d Cir. 1993)  [**62] (structure and tactics 
of the Mafia); Fresenius Med. Care Holdings, Inc. v. Baxter Int'l, Inc., No. C 03-1431 SBA, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90856, 2006 
WL 1329999, at *4-5 (N.D. Cal. May 15, 2006) (cardiopulmonary bypass and hemodialysis procedures); Strauss Farms, Inc., 
2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6965, at *3-8 (spontaneous combustion); SEC v. Lipson, 46 F. Supp. 2d 758, 767-68 (N.D. Ill. 1999) 
(accounting); In re Eastern & S. Dist. Asbestos Litig., 772 F. Supp. 1380, 1386 (E. & S.D.N.Y. 1991) (asbestos and its side 
effects), rev'd in part on other grounds by In re Brooklyn Navy Yard Asbestos Litig., 971 F.2d 831 (2d Cir. 1992)."
1575,40," Defendants do not overtly challenge McAfee's qualifications, but BHIC and HUK do seem to raise this issue in their reply brief, 
contending that McAfee's lack of ""specified expertise"" in ""extremely complex and risky international construction projects, the 
competition for which is severely limited by the requirements of the government entity that finances the projects"" disqualifies him 
from testifying to cartel and auction behavior in this case. (Reply Eight at 14.) BHIC cites one case for this proposition. See In re 
Air Disaster at Lockerbie Scot., 37 F.3d 804 (2d Cir. 1994). There, the Court  [**63] of Appeals affirmed the trial court's exclusion 
of testimony from two ""explosives officers with Scotland Yard who specialized in street bombings"" for several reasons. Id. at 825. Their testimony as to the importance of x-rays would have been cumulative since similar testimony was adduced from other 
witnesses. Additionally these witnesses' expertise as to x-rays [used by airline baggage screening equipment] was 
questionable . . . . Neither had experience in aviation bombings or security. Moreover, neither had any background or 
knowledge concerning the Flight 103 bombing itself. Id. (emphasis added). By contrast, here, McAfee's testimony was not cumulative. Moreover, it is, indeed, questionable whether 
street bombing experts with no experience in aviation bombings or security would demonstrate expertise in x-ray equipment 
used in airline baggage screening. But BHIC does not explain why McAfee's model -- which accounts for the impact on 
competition of ""a qualification stage for potential suppliers,"" some of whom may be ""already prequalified because they have bid 
on other matters,"" (Apr. 5, 2007 PM Tr. at 76) -- is too generalized to apply to ""extremely complex and risky international 
construction  [**64] projects."" The Court will not attempt to make this argument on BHIC's behalf. See Schneider v. Kissinger, 
366 U.S. App. D.C. 408, 412 F.3d 190, 200 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (quoting United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 
1990)) (""Judges are not expected to be mindreaders. Consequently, a litigant has an obligation to spell out its arguments 
squarely and distinctly, or else forever hold its peace.""). "
1576,41," A survey of other decisions admitting or rejecting testimony by such ""teaching witnesses"" confirms that theoretical models of 
economic actors' behavior are appropriate fodder for expert testimony. Compare Fed. R. Evid. 702 Advisory Committee's Note 
(noting teaching expert testimony would be admissible on ""how financial markets respond to corporate reports""), Mulder, 273 
F.3d at 101-02 (admitting teaching expert testimony on labor coalition behavior), Locascio, 6 F.3d at 936 (admitting teaching 
expert testimony on structure and tactics of the Mafia), and Lipson, 46 F. Supp. 2d at 767-68 (admitting teaching expert 
testimony on accounting principles), with United States v. Fredette, 315 F.3d 1235, 1240 (10th Cir. 2003)  [**66] (refusing to 
admit teaching expert testimony on operation of rebate programs); United States v. Stevens, 935 F.2d 1380, 1399 (3d Cir. 1991) 
(refusing to admit teaching expert testimony on tendency of clearly suggestive photo array to cause misidentification); Patterson 
v. McLean Credit Union, 805 F.2d 1143, 1147 (4th Cir. 1986) (refusing to admit teaching expert testimony comparing credit 
union clerical employees' qualifications); Green v. Kinney Shoe Corp., 715 F. Supp. 1122, 1124 (D.D.C. 1989) (Revercomb, J.) 
(refusing to admit teaching expert testimony on significance of defendant employer's use of subjective criteria in promoting 
employees), and Robertson v. McCloskey, 676 F. Supp. 351, 353-55 (D.D.C. 1988) (Green, J.) (refusing to admit teaching 
expert testimony on effect of time on memory quality)."
1576,42," The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals' opinion in City of Tuscaloosa v. Harcros Chemicals illustrates the distinction between 
proper matters for expert testimony and ""common sense"" factual determinations that lie within the jury's exclusive province. See 
158 F.3d at 564-67. City of Tuscaloosa involved an alleged conspiracy among five chemical companies ""to fix prices for 
repackaged  [**67] chlorine in Alabama in violation of both federal and state antitrust law."" Id. at 553. Among other experts, the 
plaintiffs proffered statistician James McClave. Id. at 562. McClave's testimony concerning his ""statistical measurements of 
events in the Alabama chlorine market during the period of the alleged conspiracy"" was admissible, but his ""assertions regarding 
the existence of a conspiracy, . . . his characterization of certain bids as 'signals' to co-conspirators[,] . . . and his 
characterizations of documentary evidence as reflective of collusion"" were not. Id. at 565. As the Court of Appeals explained, 
""the trier of fact [was] entirely capable of determining whether or not to draw such conclusions without any technical assistance 
from McClave or other experts."" Id. Here, McAfee's discourse on cartel behavior and incentives aided the jurors in understanding how a cartel such as that alleged 
by plaintiffs might operate, in theory. But ""the trier of fact [was] entirely capable of determining"" whether the factual scenario 
sketched by plaintiffs' other witnesses comported with this theoretical model, and McAfee properly left this analysis to the jury. 
See id. "
1577,43," In a footnote, defendants cite certain ""unique features of construction procurement"" that purportedly render McAfee's 
theoretical model inapplicable. (Motion Five at 42 n.20.) But McAfee's model assumes the very sort of ""complicated layered 
bidding and competitive negotiation"" that defendants claim ""distinguish"" construction procurement: A. Assumptions about Government procurement in particular[:] . . . usually . . . there is a qualification stage for potential 
suppliers. In some cases suppliers are already prequalified because they have bid on other matters, but it may be open for 
qualifications of new bidders. And in some matters they actually have to qualify fresh to supply[,]  [**71] . . . [a]nd the 
Government typically either picks the lowest price supplier or it negotiates with that supplier . . . . (Apr. 5, 2007 PM Tr. at 76-77.) This excerpt also answers defendants' complaint that ""McAfee's theory about efficient markets is 
undercut by the fact that CWO and USAID eliminated competitors from the process through nationality and source 
requirements."" (Motion Five at 44.) Clearly, McAfee's model accounts for some winnowing of the competitive field based on 
factors other than pure economic efficiency."
1577,44," Defendants also complain that ""McAfee's assumption and insinuation that padding (including payoffs) must have been built 
into the bids is contradicted by [] unrebutted testimony."" (Motion Five at 42.) Again, however, just as McAfee never assumed a 
cartel existed here, he likewise never assumed that any contractor in this case ""padded"" its bid on these contracts. Rather, he 
testified only that in a procurement bidding process, when a cartel exists, a bidder must incorporate certain, inherent costs of 
collusion -- ""any payments made to competitors, any payments that you make to employees . . . for added risks that they might 
be facing, and any payments made to subcontractors,"" (Apr. 5, 2007 PM Tr. at 99) -- along with his anticipated cost of 
performance into his bid to avoid a net loss, (id. at 99-100). In its entirety, this testimony pertained to a hypothetical situation. 
McAfee neither declared nor implied that bids on Contracts 20A, 29,  [**73] and 07 had been rigged. He simply described how, 
in theory, collusion like that alleged by plaintiffs would have affected an analogous contracting process. "
1578,45," In their reply brief, HII and HC argue that the Court should have excluded McAfee's testimony under Federal Rule of Evidence 
403. (Reply Five at 24.) Expert testimony can, indeed, be ""both powerful and quite misleading."" Daubert, 509 U.S. at 595. But if 
otherwise admissible, it should not be excluded under Rule 403 unless its probative value is substantially outweighed by the risk 
of unfair prejudice. Fed. R. Evid. 403. The Court recognizes that McAfee's abstract testimony on cartel behavior was, to some 
extent,  [**74] ""inherent[ly] suggestive[]."" (See Reply Five at 24.) In their questions to McAfee, however, both parties reduced the 
risk of unfair prejudice to the vanishing point by repeatedly eliciting assurances that he was not familiar with the facts of this 
case, that he did not know whether collusion had occurred here or what its results might have been, and that he did not purport 
to render an opinion on any aspect of the underlying facts. (See, e.g., Apr. 5, 2007 PM Tr. at 60-70, 78, 126-27.) By the end of 
McAfee's testimony, this horse was dead. Any surviving vestige of unfair prejudice did not substantially outweigh the significant 
probative value of McAfee's testimony. In short, McAfee explained how a cartel like that alleged by plaintiffs would theoretically 
have functioned, and the jurors could then compare the facts in evidence against McAfee's theoretical model, noting the 
similarities and differences. His testimony was highly probative and admissible under Rule 403."
1578,46," Defendants' complaint that McAfee ""applied no principles or methods to the evidence"" mistakes McAfee's role as a ""teaching 
witness."" (See Motion Five at 42-43.) For example, they point out that McAfee ""presumably could have employed a methodology 
to determine whether there was a cartel at work in this case . . . and whether the most efficient firm won the bidding."" (Id. at 42.) 
Had his testimony relied on facts and data admissible in evidence in this case, defendants' presumption would likely be correct. 
But in introducing McAfee's testimony, plaintiffs followed the ""venerable practice of using expert testimony to educate the 
factfinder on general principles."" See Fed. R. Evid. 702 Advisory Committee's Note. Defendants cannot obtain a new trial based 
on plaintiffs' entirely permissible strategic choice to use McAfee in this capacity. This same reasoning applies to defendants' criticism that McAfee ""failed  [**76] to account for alternative explanations for the 
profits achieved on the USAID projects."" (Motion Five at 42 n.31.) Had McAfee testified that collusive behavior by these 
defendants accounted for their profits on these contracts, then he should have accounted for possible alternative explanations. 
See, e.g., Claar v. Burlington N.R.R., 29 F.3d 499, 502 (9th Cir. 1994). But plaintiffs asked him to testify only about collusive 
behavior in auction settings generally, without seeking to label defendants' behavior in this case. Defendants were free to 
present alternative explanations for the profits they earned to the jury, through expert testimony or other evidence. Plaintiffs had 
no duty to do so on their behalf. Further, defendants' allegation that ""a substantial analytic gap exist[ed] between the data and the opinion proffered"" goes to the 
weight of the evidence, not its admissibility. (See Motion Five at 42.) If, indeed, McAfee's testimony addressed only ""how 
efficient players theoretically act in an efficient market,"" (id.), then the inefficiencies defendants imply existed would detract from, 
but not destroy, his testimony's relevance. When an expert purports to draw conclusions about  [**77] what happened in a case, 
his opinion must hew closely to the facts. See, e.g., Groobert v. Pres. & Dirs. of Georgetown Coll., 219 F. Supp. 2d 1, 9-10 
(D.D.C. 2002) (Urbina, J.) (citing GE v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136, 146, 118 S. Ct. 512, 139 L. Ed. 2d 508 (1997)). But where, as here, "
1579,," the expert endeavors only to educate jurors about general principles, his testimony need only be ""sufficiently tied to the facts of 
the case that it will aid the jury in resolving a factual dispute."" See Downing, 753 F.2d at 1242."
1579,47," Defendants point to McAfee's admission that his own empirical studies have not uniformly confirmed certain of his conclusions 
-- namely, that in an article entitled ""Collusive Bidding in Hostile Takeovers,"" McAfee and his co-authors described a bidding 
cartel's ""negligible effect on the target's share price."" (Apr. 9, 2007 PM Tr. at 38-42.) This contrary empirical result does cast 
some doubt on the value of McAfee's model. (See, e.g., Apr. 5, 2007 PM Tr. at 94-95 (""The purpose of bid-rigging is to . . . 
charge higher prices."").) But as McAfee subsequently explained, collusion among bidders in a hostile takeover situation is legal 
in the United States, which differentiates the data examined in his paper from the principles he discussed in his direct testimony. 
(Compare Apr. 9, 2007 PM Tr. at 51-52 with Apr. 5, 2007 PM Tr. at 99-100.) In McAfee's cartel model, collusion was illegal, and 
this illegality influenced bidders' behavior. Though defendants also highlight McAfee's failure to empirically study European construction industry cartels, (see Motion Eight 
at 22), this argument is specious in light of McAfee's other qualifications."
1579,48," HII and HC incorporate by reference, in full, their written objections to plaintiffs' proposed jury instructions [828] and their 
objections on the record. (Motion Five at 23.) Contrary to defendants' assertion, the Court did not adopt plaintiffs' proposed 
instructions ""wholesale,"" and those instructions underwent several substantive revisions before they were read to the jury. The 
Court will not comb through defendants' prior filing to determine which objections remain pertinent. Second, and similarly, 
 [**81] the Court will not examine the record line by line to identify all of defense counsel's objections to jury instructions. To the 
extent any such objections, whether in writing or in open court, survived the instructions' revisions and are not articulated in 
defendants' present briefs, the Court reaffirms its prior rulings on them. "
1580,49," The report elaborates further: In fashioning the appropriate standard of knowledge for liability under the civil False Claims Act, S. 1562 adopts the 
concept that individuals and contractors receiving public funds have some duty to make a limited inquiry so as to be 
reasonably certain they are entitled to the money they seek. A rigid definition of that ""duty,"" however, would ignore the wide 
variance in sophistication of program recipients. Consequently, S. 1562 defines this obligation as ""to make such inquiry as 
would be reasonable and prudent conduct under the circumstances to ascertain the true and accurate basis  [**84] of the 
claim."" Only those who act in ""gross negligence"" of this duty will be found liable under the False Claims Act. S. Rep. No. 99-345, at 20 (1986), reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5266, 5285."
1580,50," Even if the law will not construe a defendant's failure to make reasonable inquiry as actual knowledge, any error was 
harmless. As Judge Oberdorfer stated in Ervin, section 3729(b)'s knowledge standard embraces ""the refusal to learn of 
information which an individual, in the exercise of prudent judgment, should have discovered."" See 370 F. Supp. 2d at 42. 
Whether imprudent failure to discover information connotes reckless disregard, as in Ervin, or actual knowledge, as this Court 
instructed, it satisfies the FCA's ""knowingly"" definition. "
1581,51," Three other complaints blatantly contradict the record. First, defendants assert the Court imposed ""liability for acts of co-
conspirators absent the required showing of foreseeability."" (Motion Five at 27.) But the Court  [**85] clearly instructed the jury: 
""A participant in a conspiracy . . . is liable for the acts of his co-conspirators . . . as long as those acts were reasonably 
foreseeable."" (May 4, 2007 AM Tr. at 63.) Second, defendants claim this Court ""failed to instruct on the clearly applicable intra-
corporate conspiracy doctrine."" (Motion Five at 27.) Yet the Court in fact instructed on this very doctrine: ""no . . . conspiracy is 
possible under the law between corporations that are commonly owned and controlled and that regularly conduct their business 
affairs in such a manner as to constitute, in effect, a single business entity or enterprise."" (May 4, 2007 AM Tr. at 62.) This 
quotation from the record also answers defendants' third complaint, that the Court was ""willing[] to permit the jury to conclude 
that HC and HII were simultaneously co-conspirators and alter-egos."" (Motion Five at 27.) Juxtaposed with portions of the alter 
ego definition -- ""a parent corporation is the principal stockholder of a subsidiary corporation and conducts its business . . . [and] 
the parent corporation has . . . conducted the subsidiary's business [such that] its business interests and the parent corporation's 
interests  [**86] cannot be reasonably separated,"" (id. at 57) -- this instruction clarified that HC and HII could not be both co-
conspirators and alter egos. Additionally, defendants claim the Court instructed ""that receipt of a benefit is 'simply irrelevant' to whether a party agreed to 
conspire,"" and that this statement conflicts with Supreme Court precedent. (Motion Five at 26.) This critique misstates the 
record, (See May 4, 2007 AM Tr. at 63), and mischaracterizes dicta as a holding, see Direct Sales Co. v. United States, 319 
U.S. 703, 713, 63 S. Ct. 1265, 87 L. Ed. 1674 (1943). But even if it were entirely accurate, receipt of a benefit would still be 
inessential to a conspiracy. See, e.g., United States v. Shoup, 608 F.2d 950, 956-57 (3d Cir. 1979) (explaining why ""a stake in 
the venture"" is not an essential element of conspiracy)."
1581,52," HII and HC's motion misreads the Court's instructions on willfulness. First, they claim the Court instructed that as to subsection 
(a)(3), ""intent is unnecessary, and [] '[k]nowledge is all that is required under the act.'"" (Motion Five at 26.) In fact, the Court 
made these statements while defining ""knowingly,"" the mental state specified in subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2). (See May 4, 2007 
AM Tr. at 48.) They further claim the Court instructed that willfulness was merely ""sufficient"" but not necessary to impose liability 
under subsection (a)(3). (Motion Five at 26.) The record reflects no such instruction. (See May 4, 2007 AM Tr. at 59-60.)"
1581,53," It appears that defendants have adopted contradictory premises: they claim the jury must have assumed the definition of 
""knowingly"" applied to the word ""willfully,"" even though they are separated by a full nine pages in the transcript,  [**89] but could 
not have associated ""willfully"" with FCA conspiracy because the two instructions were separated by nine transcript pages. "
1583,54," Defendants also argue that no factual basis for a collective imputed knowledge instruction existed. (Motion Five at 25 n.10.) 
The factual riposte to this argument is set forth below. See infra part III.A.1.a.iv."
1583,55," Defendants characterize the doctrine's application here as ""a judicial repeal of Section 3729(b)'s definition of 'knowing.'"" (Reply 
Five at 15.) They propose that the jury could have conflated the collective imputed knowledge instruction with the Court's 
(allegedly) flawed definition of ""knowingly"" to hold HII liable for an ""amalgamation of attributed information"" of which its agents 
were ""negligently unaware."" (Motion Five at 25 n.11.) As explained above, any error in the Court's definition of ""knowingly"" 
 [**94] was harmless. See supra part II.D.1. Further, defendants' critique ignores the public policy rationale for the collective 
knowledge doctrine: Corporations compartmentalize knowledge, subdividing the elements of specific duties and operations into smaller 
components. The aggregate of those components constitutes the corporation's knowledge of a particular operation. It is 
irrelevant whether employees administering one component of an operation know the specific activities of employees 
administering another aspect of the operation. Bank of New England, 821 F.2d at 856. This rationale applies with equal force when the ""operation"" consists of defrauding the 
federal government, and it is in no way incompatible with section 3729(b). Indeed, the two appear complementary. The Senate 
Report accompanying the 1986 FCA amendments explains that the Act's definition of ""knowingly"" endeavors ""to reach what has 
become known as the 'ostrich' type situation where an individual has 'buried his head in the sand.'"" S. Rep. No. 99-345, at 21 
(1986), reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5266, 5285. Analogously, the collective knowledge doctrine ensures that ""a corporation 
cannot plead innocence by asserting that  [**95] the information obtained by several employees was not acquired by any one 
individual employee who then would have comprehended its full import,"" United States v. T.I.M.E.--D.C., Inc., 381 F. Supp. 730, 
738 (W.D.W. Va. 1974) -- i.e., that each individual employee had ""buried his head in the sand."""
1583,56," In the course of giving these instructions, the Court could -- as defendants suggest -- have limited them to specific facts, 
circumstances, or parties, but defendants offer no authority suggesting it was required to do so. Moreover, considering that 
defendants believe the imputed knowledge instructions, as read, ""occupied a disproportionate percentage of the Court's total 
charge,"" this  [**97] would hardly have helped matters. "
1584,57," HC and HII also raise several challenges to the Court's alter ego instruction. They first challenge the instruction's wording as 
misstating the law, (Motion Five at 27), but they have waived this particular issue: after defense counsel represented -- without 
drawing an objection -- that the parties had ""reached agreement on the language,"" the Court accepted HII and HC's 
Supplemental Proposed Jury Instruction Number 2 in lieu of plaintiffs' alter ego instruction, (see May 3, 2007 PM Tr. at 75-77). Second, they contend alter ego is an issue of law for the court, rather than one of fact for the jury, but this argument fares no 
better than it did pretrial. This Court explained in its Memorandum Opinion & Order of March 20, 2007 [737], denying HII and 
HC's motion in limine: In light of the fact-specific nature of the determination, the Court finds that an alter ego analysis is a matter for the jury . . . . 
Moreover, there is nothing in Labadie Coal that creates a requirement that the court must determine alter ego liability. See 
Labadie Coal, 672 F.2d at 92. In fact, the issue was decided by the court in Labadie Coal only because this was not a case 
where  [**98] the jury was a trier of fact as to any issue. Id. Finally, as shown by Dorocon, Inc. v. Burke, Civ. No. 02-2556 
(CKK), 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38839, 2005 WL 3454338, at *2, *15 (D.D.C. 2005) (Kollar-Kotelly, J.), a jury may hear and 
resolve an issue of liability on a veil piercing theory. (Mem. Op. & Order of Mar. 20, 2007 [737] at 2-3.) The Court stands by its original ruling. Third, they argue no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for the instruction existed. (Motion Five at 27.) Under Labadie Coal, to 
succeed on an alter ego claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate: 1) a ""unity of interest and ownership"" between parent and subsidiary 
such that their ""separate personalities . . . no longer exist""; and 2) that an inequitable result will follow unless the corporate veil is 
pierced. 672 F.2d at 96. The Court agrees with HC's argument, articulated more fully in its renewed motion for judgment as a 
matter of law, that the government introduced only minimal evidence on these points. (See Motion Three at 7-14; Reply Three at 
25-27.) But defendants never explain how the allegedly unwarranted alter ego instruction caused such prejudice as to comprise 
""a clear miscarriage of justice."" Wild v. Alster, 377 F. Supp. 2d 186, 189 (D.D.C. 2005)  [**99] (Walton, J.). In fact, plaintiffs 
offered ample evidence from which the jury could reasonably have found HC liable on either or both of their other pleaded 
theories -- conspiracy and/or ""caused to be presented."" See infra part III.A.1.a.ii. Hence, any error was harmless."
1584,58," Though defendants now insist they stipulated only to the document's authenticity, (Reply Eight at 20 n. 11), they did not qualify 
their stipulation on the record, (see Apr. 25, 2007 AM Tr. at 126). Furthermore, while defendants read the document to ""impl[y] 
that BHIC had been in existence since 1986,"" (Motion Eight at 27), the exhibit was relevant for unrelated reasons. For example, 
it was evidence that BHIC performed work on Contracts 20A and 07: ""We recently completed Contract 20A in Cairo . . . and are 
currently constructing . . . Contract 07 in Alexandria, Egypt."" (Pl.'s Ex. 682.) "
1585,59," The exchange progressed as follows: Q. . . . This is a prequalification application, right? A. That's correct. Q. For June 1992? A. That's  [**102] correct. Q. And the company submitting it is BHIC? A. That's correct. Q. And it's for Contract 35? A. That's correct. . . . Q. Now the last paragraph, could you read that for me, please, for the jury? A. Bill Harbert International Construction, Inc., was incorporated as BLH Enterprises, Inc., on June 10, 1986, in the State of 
Alabama. On December 9, 1991, the name was changed to Bill Harbert International Construction, Inc. Q. Okay. So according to this document which was submitted to the government, BHIC existed since 1986, right? A. Yes. Q. It just had a different name apparently, right? A. I don't know. It's a different name. I don't know if it's the same company. (Apr. 12, 2007 AM Tr. at 55-57.)"
1585,60," Government counsel argued: Now . . . why are we suing BHIC? . . . Now, what I want you to do to answer that question is look at a document that BHIC . 
. . submitted to the United States government. . . . Now you look at [page] 19A, the paragraph that's entitled ""Company Background."" . . . According to Mr. Lavine, what this should say is Alan Hall is out buying paper and folders and staplers and, you know, 
going off to Staples and Office Depot to get the office set up. But what it says is, ""Bill Harbert  [**103] International 
Construction, Inc. was incorporated as BLH Enterprises on June 10th, 1986, in the state of Alabama. On December 9, 
1991, the name was changed to Bill Harbert International Construction, Inc."" So BHIC was in existence at the time Bill Harbert, Roy Anderson, and Tommy Kitchens were doing what they were doing 
rigging the bids, dealing with the profits on Contract 20A, 07, 29. That's what they told CWO. Now just to add to this history, we look at page 22. This was what BHIC says again . . . . It says, ""We've recently completed 
-- ""we,"" and that means BHIC -- Contract 20A in Cairo and are currently constructing Contract 27 in Cairo and Contract 07 
in Alexandria, Egypt."" (May 3, 2007 AM Tr. at 67-69.) "
1586,61," Nor did the Court err in refusing defendants' requests for curative instructions (See May 3, 2007 AM Tr. at 107, 108.) Though 
the distinction does rely to some extent on semantics, plaintiffs did not stipulate that neither BHIC nor any predecessor company 
existed ""at the time Contracts 20A, 29, 07 were bid or entered into."" Plaintiffs did not seek to disprove the stipulated fact that 
BHIC did not exist prior to 1992. Rather, they sought to prove that BHIC, by its own admission,  [**104] is a direct outgrowth of 
an entity that did exist when the bid-rigging occurred. The Court does not take lightly BHIC's concern about its counsel's 
credibility with the jury. (See Motion Eight at 28-29.) Yet the Court has confidence that after hearing testimony concerning the 
complex corporate restructuring from which most of these defendants emerged, the jury was able to appreciate the distinction 
between plaintiffs' argument and the stipulated fact. Additionally, ""a curative instruction that Plaintiffs were asserting no claims that BHIC made misrepresentations to the 
government on Contract 35"" was also unnecessary. (See Motion Eight at 28 n.15.) Plaintiffs never argued such a claim to the 
jury, and ""Contract 35"" appeared nowhere on the verdict form."
1586,62," As defendants correctly note, ""[t]he influence of a trial judge on the jury  [**105] is necessarily and properly of great weight."" 
Quercia v. United States, 289 U.S. 466, 470, 53 S. Ct. 698, 77 L. Ed. 1321 (1933). Yet twice during the trial -- at the opening and 
close of the evidence -- this Court instructed the jury: You should not infer or conclude from any ruling or other comment that I make that I have any opinion on the merits of the 
case favoring one side or the other. I do not favor one side or the other. . . . During the course of the trial I may ask a 
question of a witness. You should not take my questions to witnesses as [] any indication as to my opinion of how you 
should determine the facts. If I say or do anything at any time during this case, including giving these instructions[,] which 
seem[s] to indicate my opinion on any of the evidence, then I instruct[] you to disregard that indication. Nothing I say or do 
should influence or suggest to you that I favor any party in this case. I did not mean to express or suggest any opinion 
about which witnesses should be believed or which facts are established. (Mar. 20, 2007 AM Tr. at 20-21, 23. See also May 4, 2007 AM Tr. at 27 (near-identical language).) If such instructions were 
entirely futile, courts would not give them. "
1587,63," Absent the Court's question, defendants suggest the jury could reasonably have concluded ""there was no significance to the 
lack of an audit."" (Motion Eight at 11.) But this alternative interpretation is not altogether plausible: while Teal's testimony 
suggested that an audit might have been more productive after the job was done, or at least once work had started, these timing 
considerations  [**108] would not explain why Schoenwasser refused Teal's offer to reschedule. (See Mar. 28, 2007 AM Tr. at 
52, 92-93.)"
1587,64," To wit, had different individuals produced the May and October estimates, their variance might be more easily explicable. 
Similarly, lay jurors would have no way of knowing whether such discrepancies might be common among estimates and bids on 
large-scale construction projects. The Court's questions helped the jury to properly evaluate the disparity."
1587,65," Defendants first take issue with the following exchange: Q. . . . Let's talk for a minute about whether or not the estimators or the people who are actually valuing this job know about 
any agreements. Now, would you agree with me, sir, that, under your analysis, that being the assumption of a cartel, the 
assumption of increased prices, that people had to know when they bid the jobs? A. No, it's not correct. . . . I would agree that upper  [**110] management at some level has to know. . . . I agree that 
[som]eone submitting the bid has to be influenced by somebody who knows about the cartel . . . . Q. Right. And if there is no evidence of that, then, again, your analysis is not relevant . . . . A. I, in fact, would have said exactly the opposite. I would have said that, if there is no evidence, that you can infer -- if we 
know that there is a cartel -- remember, I'm still under the hypothesis -- I think you can infer that management had some 
mechanism for influencing the bid; otherwise, they engaged in really bad management. Q. That is -- THE COURT: There was no point to have the cartel. THE WITNESS: Well, and, moreover, they have to make payments and they are getting no return on their investment. (Apr. 5, 2007 PM Tr. at 138-40.) The Court's question simply clarified McAfee's testimony that assuming a cartel whose objective 
was to secure contracts at higher prices than would be obtainable through competitive bidding, it would be ""really bad "
1588,," management"" to allow one's subordinates to proceed as though the company would be competing for the contract. In short, 
there would be no point to having formed the cartel if bids were to be formulated  [**111] competitively. Defendants juxtapose 
the Court's comment with its ruling immediately afterward sustaining an objection to defense counsel's question, ""And that's very 
possibly what happened in this case, sir[?]"" (Motion Eight at 13; Apr. 5, 2007 PM Tr. at 140.) Yet the Court ruled properly on this 
objection: as established ad nauseum by counsel for both sides, McAfee lacked knowledge of the facts and was not prepared to 
render an opinion on what happened in this case. Defendants next find fault with the following dialogue: Q. . . . If you have a situation where you have two bidders on a contract and they compete . . . then your cartel assessment 
is not applicable to that contract; is that correct, sir? . . . A. Yes, in the hypothetical you just gave me, my assumption of a cartel would be wrong. Q. Right THE COURT: But in his hypothetical, if another company did not bid, then you could have a cartel. THE WITNESS: Oh well, then I had three bidders, one of whom was paid off not to bid, and I would then have a cartel, yes. (Apr. 5, 2007 PM Tr. at 133-35.) Again, the Court's objective was clarification: for McAfee, the generic term ""bidders"" included 
not just actual bidders but also those parties  [**112] referred to as ""schleppers,"" potential bidders paid by the actual bidders not 
to bid. (Id. at 113, 135.) Defendants also suggest the elicited testimony contradicted the evidence, (Motion Eight at 14), but as 
this amounts to an evidentiary sufficiency argument, the Court will address it below, see infra part III.A. 1.a. In passing, defendants refer to two other exchanges between the Court and McAfee. First, after McAfee affirmed that the three 
depositions listed on a document were the three he would have reviewed ""[p]rior to [his] deposition"" and stated he did not recall 
whether he had subsequently requested others, the Court asked, ""But I take it from your prior answer you implied you did, in 
fact, review others?"" (Apr. 9, 2007 PM Tr. at 7-8.) McAfee's answer left open whether he had subsequently reviewed other 
depositions after his own; the Court sought only to fill this void. Second, defendants object to the Court's elaborating on a 
hypothetical posed to McAfee by plaintiffs' counsel on redirect. (See id. at 65-67.) Following up on cross-examination questions 
by HC's counsel, plaintiffs' counsel read an excerpt of Ruggieri's testimony and asked how it would ""fit with the economic 
 [**113] theory and analysis"" McAfee had discussed on direct. (Id. at 64-65.) Understandably, given his limited knowledge of the 
facts, McAfee needed more information to answer the question. The Court simply amplified the ""hypothetical"" until McAfee had 
sufficient ""context to understand how [the] testimony fit[]."" (Id. at 65-67.) This was not error."
1588,66," For some reason, defendants also choose to quote a question by government's counsel to which the Court sustained 
defendants' objections. (See Motion Eight at 16  [**114] (quoting Apr. 17, 2007 PM Tr. at 87).) It is unclear whether and on what 
grounds defendants challenge this ruling. "
1589,67," Separately, BHIC and HUK demand a new trial because plaintiffs referred to profits in their arguments on damages. (Motion 
Eight at 25-26  [**116] (""Profits in themselves are completely irrelevant"" to FCA damages).) They do not specify which 
evidentiary rule this argument breached, so the Court construes it as attacking relevancy."
1589,68," Defendants contend that plaintiffs ""employed a concerted strategy"" to confuse the jury about the proper measure of damages 
by inserting the word ""should"" in place of the word ""would"" at critical points in their presentation. (Reply Five at 17 & n.16. See 
also Motion Two at 8.) In such a complex case, it is hardly surprising that plaintiffs' counsel may have misspoken or made 
typographical errors on a bare handful of occasions. Moreover, even assuming that defendants are correct in attributing 
nefarious motives to their adversaries, the Court's instruction on the proper measure of damages -- ""the difference between what 
the United States paid and what it would have paid had there been no bid-rigging agreement,"" (May 4, 2007 AM Tr. at 65 
(emphasis added)) -- eliminated any confusion engendered by plaintiffs' counsel's single misstatement during closing, (May 1, 
2007 PM Tr. at 71). "
1590,69," While Bigelow involved the Sherman Act, not the FCA, the Supreme Court confirmed this ""ancient"" principle -- ""that the 
wrongdoer shall bear the risk of the uncertainty which his own wrong has created"" -- ""is not restricted to proof of damage in 
antitrust suits."" 327 U.S. at 265."
1590,70," For this very reason, plaintiffs were ""reliev[ed] [] of their burden to prove damages with"" precision. (Contra Reply Five at 17 
n.17.) While there may not have been a ""dearth of market information"" generally,  [**120] the array of facts to which defendants 
point does not include any evidence of a readily comparable contract price set under competitive conditions. (See id.) Further, 
there was no need for plaintiffs to ""demonstrate that it would have been impossible to present"" evidence of the true difference 
between what the government paid and what it would have paid absent collusion. (See Motion Six at 7.) In seeking judgment 
notwithstanding the verdict, BHIC and HUK suggest plaintiffs could have hired an expert to calculate the government's precise 
damages. (Id.) Considering the innumerable variables involved, such a calculation would be wildly speculative."
1590,71," The Court does not suggest profits were the only relevant data the jury could have considered in crafting its damages award. 
See United States v. Killough, 848 F.2d 1523, 1532 (11th Cir. 1988) (""trier of fact must deduce [value crucial to FCA damages 
measure] from all the evidence presented""). The jury might also have considered, inter alia, the various bids and engineer's 
estimates as well as side payments to co-conspirators. See infra part III.A. 1.b. To be relevant to damages, these pieces of "
1591,," evidence need only bear some relationship to ""the difference between what the United States paid and what it would have paid 
had there been no bid-rigging agreement."""
1591,72," Counsel for the government ""walk[ed] through [] several methods of [computing] damages"" with the jury. (May 1, 2007 PM Tr. 
at 72.) He referred to ""method 4"" as yielding a ""bare minimum on 20A"" based on Terry Musika's chart. (Id. at 75.) He then 
argued as follows: So on this method the $ 30 million is the key. That's the number, keep in mind, that was actually on the Harbert-Jones 
books. That's what they reported on their books as the profit on 20A, and you'll recall that that was a 28 percent . . . profit. If 
you subtract the true profit -- that is, the $ 55 million -- which includes the profit hidden . . . from the $ 30 million . . . they got 
a  [**124] bare minimum of 25, and we think this is relevant as a floor, an absolute floor. We're not saying that that's the 
number you should use . . . because . . . why in the world would anyone ever let them hide the bulk of the profits and walk 
away with them? (Id.) Counsel for relator argued similarly: The amount of profits, the true profits, were $ 55 million. That's with all of the bogus expenses added back in there. We 
know that the amount of profits that Harbert-Jones reported on its books is $ 30 million . . . So what we've done is said the 
difference between 55 and 30, the $ 25 million, gives the defendants what they reported on their books. It holds them to the 
number they wrote on the books . . . but takes away . . . what they hid . . . . So that's the minimum. That's the floor, the very 
bottom. (May 3, 2007 PM Tr. at 40-41.) "
1592,73," This logic does not extend to Raymond Harbert's  [**128] testimony concerning the total value of assets HMC manages for its 
clients. But however prejudicial this information may have been independently, a few isolated phrases uttered in the course of 
seven weeks of testimony do not create the sort of pervasive prejudice that will merit a new trial. See Edmond, 52 F.3d at 1102."
1592,74," Similarly, government counsel elicited from Michael Gould that the U.S. would devote any damages recovered in this lawsuit 
to other construction projects in Egypt. (Apr. 3, 2007 PM Tr. at 119-20.) "
1593,75," (See Mar. 20, 2007 PM Tr. at 36 (characterizing relator as ""desperate [in the] pursuit of money""), 3 8-3 9 (characterizing John 
Harbert as a ""man you could trust"" and describing his ""very large and successful business . . . [with] interests [that] ranged well 
beyond construction"" and that became ""so diverse that he formed an umbrella company"").)"
1593,76," (See Mar. 29, 2007 PM Tr. at 65 (closing relator's cross-examination with, ""And isn't it the case that sometimes innocent 
corporations get swept up just because they have money?"").)"
1593,77," HII contends ""it was critical . . . to have its responsibility for the alleged submission of false claims, if any, separately 
determined by the jury [because] HII was not a partner in the Harbert-Jones 20A and 07 joint ventures at  [**133] the time any 
claims were submitted, and [] exited the international construction business altogether while these projects were still underway."" 
(Reply Five at 20.) Further, HII points to the FCA's scienter requirement, which must be ""satisfied as to each defendant and as to 
each claim."" (Id.) These arguments implicate liability, not damages. Moreover, the verdict form, as administered, answered both: 
the jury specifically found that HII ""knowingly made, used or caused to be made or used a false record or statement to get a 
false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government,"" and that it ""knowingly presented or caused to be presented a 
false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the United States,"" on each of the three contracts. (Verdict Form [858] at 3-
8.)"
1593,78," Because plaintiffs retained a live cause of action against defendant Anderson only as to a single claim submitted pursuant to 
Contract 29, but had live claims against the other defendants as to all claims submitted on each contract, the jury was asked to 
separately determine the damages attributable to Anderson's conduct. (See Verdict Form [858] at 11.) "
1594,79," Defendants argue that the Court's adoption, in the Memorandum  [**134] Opinion accompanying its judgment, of the 
""proportionate share"" approach confirms the need for a jury to allocate damages among them. (Motion Five at 44-45.) As 
explained below, see infra part IV.A.2, the Court erred in applying McDermott, Inc. v. Amclyde, 511 U.S. 202, 114 S. Ct. 1461, 
128 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1994), to refuse defendant Anderson a proportionate offset based on payments the government received 
from settling co-defendants. While the Court referred again to McDermott in apportioning that offset across the three contracts 
with respect to the other defendants, it relied only on McDermott's broad, motivating principles. See infra part IV.A.2."
1594,80," The damages measure in a FCA case -- ""the difference between what the United States paid and what it would have paid had 
there been no bid-rigging agreement,"" (May 4, 2007 AM Tr. at 65 (final jury instruction)) -- incorporates a causal link between the 
bid-rigging and harm to the government, so the Court will not undertake separate causation analyses."
1594,81," The  [**136] elements of this ""caused to be presented"" claim are: (1) the defendant knowingly; (2) submitted a claim, or 
caused a claim to be submitted, to the government; (3) that was false or fraudulent. (May 4, 2007 AM Tr. at 46.)"
1594,82," The elements of this ""caused to be made"" claim are: (1) the defendant knowingly; (2) either made or used, or caused another 
make or use, a false record or statement to get the government to pay its claim; (3) that the record or statement was false or 
fraudulent. (May 4, 2007 AM Tr. at 47.)"
1594,83," The elements of FCA conspiracy are: (1) the defendant conspired with one or more persons; (2) to get a false or fraudulent 
claim allowed or paid by the United States; (3) and one or more conspirators performed any act to effect the object of the 
conspiracy. (May 4, 2007 AM Tr. at 48.) To prove the defendant conspired, a plaintiff must prove: (1) an agreement to commit an 
unlawful act or to commit a lawful act by unlawful means; (2) that the defendant willfully joined, either at its inception or 
afterwards; and (3) one or more conspirators knowingly committed one or more overt acts in furtherance of some object or 
purpose of the conspiracy. (May 4, 2007 AM Tr. at 59-61.) Claims  [**137] submitted to the government under any contract 
secured through a collusive conspiracy are, inevitably, false or fraudulent, United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, 317 U.S. 537, 
543-45, 63 S. Ct. 379, 87 L. Ed. 443 (1943), and it is undisputed that claims were submitted pursuant to Contracts 20A, 29, and 
07. Thus, for each contract, formation of a collusive conspiracy is a central issue for plaintiffs' inchoate and substantive FCA 
claims. "
1595,84, The record contains evidence from which the jury could have found these facts by a preponderance of the evidence.
1595,85," Thus, contrary to BHIC and HUK's assertion, the evidence did support the existence of a ""schlepper"" -- a third potential bidder 
paid not to bid -- on Contract 20A. (See Motion Eight at 14.)"
1595,86," Iatrou testified that Anderson later crossed out his signature, and that he and Schmidt referred to Anderson in their 
correspondence by various nicknames because the parties  [**141] wished to conceal Anderson's involvement in the bid-rigging 
agreement. (See Mar. 21, 2007 AM Tr. at 48-49, 60, 66-67, 69.) "
1596,87," HII appears to argue that because Fuller had already performed its part of the bargain (by not bidding in August 1988) and had 
been disqualified from the second round of bidding, Anderson could not have joined the conspiracy in December. (Motion Two at 
3-4. See also Reply Two at 3.) Yet it is hornbook law that one may join a conspiracy after the agreement's inception, (see May 4, 
2007 AM Tr. at 59-61), and HII offers no authority for its novel twist on this rule -- that one may join a conspiracy after the 
agreement's inception only so long as it remains wholly executory. Moreover, there was circumstantial evidence from which the jury could have concluded that Anderson joined the conspiracy 
much earlier -- that he represented HII at the May 1988 meeting where Schmidt originally proposed a collusive arrangement. 
Initially, Kadenbach ""was sure"" a ""Harbert"" representative attended, (Mar. 22, 2007 AM Tr. at 82), but he later conceded his 
certainty rested on Schmidt's statement that ""somebody"" from ""Harbert"" was present, (Id. at 103-04). Nonetheless, considering 
that  [**142] HII was the majority partner in the joint venture for which Schmidt sought to secure Contract 20A, the jury could 
reasonably have concluded that someone from HII was, indeed, present. Prior to that meeting, Bill Harbert, HII's President, had 
sent Anderson to London to work on HII's behalf. (Pl.'s Ex. 250.) He had also signed powers of attorney authorizing Anderson, 
""without reservation,"" to represent HII in bidding for international construction projects. (Pl.'s Exs. 652A-D.) Anderson attended 
the Contract 20A reconciliation meeting with Jones in June 1988, and along with John Ollis of Jones, he determined the final 
markup. (Mar. 26, 2007 PM Tr. at 29-30; Apr. 13, 2007 AM Tr. at 38, 48; Apr. 16, 2007 PM Tr. at 18.) In August and December 
1988, Anderson signed tenders on Contract 20A as HII's vice-president. (Pl.'s Exs. 109, 162.) In light of Anderson's explicit 
status as HII's point-man in Europe for international contracting and his attendance at the December 1988 renegotiation with 
Fuller, it would be reasonable to infer that if a HII representative attended the May meeting, it would have been Anderson. Further, the jury could reasonably have concluded that Anderson was contemporaneously  [**143] aware of and acted on 
Schmidt's original, August 1988 agreement with Fuller. Before Schmidt met with Fuller, Anderson and his team of estimators 
prepared two separate bid packages, one 3.5% higher than the other, and sent them both to Cairo. (Apr. 12, 2007 PM Tr. at 54-
56.) After Schmidt and Iatrou agreed that Fuller would not bid, Anderson instructed that the higher bid be submitted. (See id.) 
While defendants claim this last-minute adjustment to the joint venture's bid was designed to account for fluctuations in steel 
prices, the jury could reasonably have inferred that Anderson ordered the higher bid submitted once Schmidt told him Fuller was 
onboard."
1596,88," As this Court instructed the jury, the False Claims Act knowledge standard also embraces deliberate ignorance and reckless 
disregard. (See May 4, 2007 AM Tr. at 48.) The jury could have concluded Anderson satisfied the standard for reckless 
disregard when he authorized payment on inflated pre-bid invoices and wire transfers from the joint venture to HUK that 
disguised payoffs to co-conspirators, and when he signed the sale-leaseback agreement and invoices that concealed some of 
the joint venture's profits. (See Apr. 9, 2007 PM Tr. at 108-09; 118-19; Apr. 11, 2007 PM Tr. at 119, 126-27, 131-33; Joint 
Stipulation 1.)"
1596,89," In concluding Bill Harbert had knowledge of the conspiracy, the jury could also have considered his 1985 letter to his brother 
lamenting increased competition on Egyptian construction  [**145] projects, (Pl.'s Ex. 249); his establishment in 1986 of 
business contacts with Schmidt, the conspiracy's ringleader, (Pl.'s Ex. 251); and his wire transfers to and from what plaintiffs 
colorfully referred to as the Holzmann ""slush fund,"" an account through which payoffs for Contracts 20A and 29 passed, (Pl.'s 
Exs. 21, 22, 365)."
1596,90," The Court instructed the jury on imputed knowledge, (May 4, 2007 AM Tr. at 54), and in light of the other evidence, the jury 
could reasonably have concluded that Anderson, at least, acquired knowledge of the conspiracy (and consequently, the claims' 
falsity) while acting within the scope of his duties as HII's representative on Contract 20A, (see, e.g., Pl.'s Exs. 109, 162, 250, 
652A-D). "
1597,91," After imputing Anderson's knowledge to HII, the jury could also have reasonably concluded that HII's provision of bonding 
support to the joint venture enabled the joint venture to bid on Contract 20A and was thus a but-for cause of its submission of 
false claims. (See Pl.'s Exs. 109, 307.) See infra note 95 (discussing plaintiffs' ""caused to be presented"" theory)."
1597,92," Further, given that Harbert originally sent Anderson to London to pursue international construction contracts and that 
Anderson was one of Harbert's two ""key deputies,"" (Apr. 24, 2007 AM Tr. at 11), the jury could reasonably have inferred that 
Anderson acted with Harbert's blessing or at his behest."
1597,93," HC insists that no evidence indicates Harbert acquired this knowledge -- or took any action -- ""while acting within the scope of 
his . . . employment"" or while ""wearing his HC 'hat.'"" (Motion Three at 15, 18.) But the  [**147] jury could reasonably have 
concluded that where, as here, a single person held managerial or fiduciary positions with multiple, interrelated corporate 
entities, whose interests were in some respects aligned, he could wear more than one ""hat"" at a time. Plaintiffs' counsel 
advanced this very theory to the jury, (Mar. 20, 2007 AM Tr. at 72, 84-85; May 3, 2007 PM Tr. at 9-10), and the jury evidently 
agreed. Relatedly, HC contends Harbert was an adverse agent who pursued bid-rigging in his own personal interests and against those 
of HC. (Motion Three at 17-20.) As the Court explained above, however, see supra part II.D.3, the ""adverse agent"" exception 
""applies only to fraud against the corporation, not to fraud on behalf of the corporation."" BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg), S.A. v. 
Clifford, 964 F. Supp. 468, 478 (D.D.C. 1997) (Green, J.). HC's adverse agent theory appears to rest on its characterization of 
the sale-leaseback transaction used to conceal joint venture profits on Contract 20A: defendants asserted throughout trial that 
Bill Harbert engineered this scheme to retaliate against his brother, John, by depressing HIE's apparent value and then buying 
HII's share in HIE at a bargain price. (See Motion  [**148] Three at 17.) Absent evidence that Harbert knew in September 1990, 
when the transaction was initiated, that HII would later sell him its share in HIE, this theory is largely speculative. Further, for the 
adverse agent doctrine to apply, many courts hold that the agent's interests must be completely adverse to the principal's in a 
given transaction. E.g., Pereira v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 186 F.3d 196, 207 (2d Cir. 1999); Martin Marietta Corp. v. Gould, Inc., 
70 F.3d 768, 773 (4th Cir. 1995). But cf. Baena v. KPMG LLP, 453 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2006) (agent's conduct not imputable 
where ""wrongdoing is done primarily for personal benefit"") (emphasis added). Here, while HC did not receive any profits from 
Contract 20A directly, the jury could reasonably have concluded that it nonetheless reaped benefits through the conspiracy's 
enrichment of its subsidiaries, HII and HIE. (See Apr. 10, 2007 PM Tr. at 60-68; Joint Stipulation 1.) Moreover, as explained 
below, to the extent Harbert's interests may have become adverse to HC's after he acquired knowledge of the conspiracy, the 
jury need not have imputed Harbert's actions to HC along with his knowledge. Instead, it could reasonably have concluded 
 [**149] that HC advanced the conspiracy through its own knowing provision of services to HIE."
1597,94," HC repeatedly cites to this Court's Memorandum Opinion & Order of March 14, 2007, for the proposition that it must have 
performed ""fraudulent"" actions in furtherance of the conspiracy to be held liable. (See, e.g., Motion Three at 20. See also Reply "
1598,," Three at 17.) HC misconstrues the Court's opinion, which did not presume to judicially amend the False Claims Act. (See Mem. 
Op. & Order of Mar. 14, 2007 [716] at 8.) The Act itself does not specify that a defendant must perform ""fraudulent"" acts to be 
liable, and HC cites no case law or other authority that supports this interpretation."
1598,95," HC attacks plaintiffs' ""caused to be presented"" theory as ""novel,"" but the FCA clearly sets forth this basis for liability. See 31 
U.S.C. § 3729(a)(1) (2008). Various authorities have explicitly recognized this theory as legitimate under the statute. See, e.g., 
United States ex rel. McCready v. Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., 251 F. Supp. 2d 114, 120 (D.D.C. 2003) (Lamberth, J.); 
United States ex rel. Atkinson v. Penn. Shipbuilding Co., 255 F. Supp. 2d 351, 405 (E.D. Pa. 2002). If the defendant satisfies the 
FCA's knowledge standard, ordinary causation principles apply -- his conduct must be at least a substantial factor in causing, if 
not the but-for cause of, submission of false claims. United States ex rel. Schmidt v. Zimmer, Inc., 386 F.3d 235, 244 (3d Cir. 
2004). HC's contention that this theory of liability conflicts with the Supreme Court's analysis in United States v. Bestfoods, 524 
U.S. 51, 118 S. Ct. 1876, 141 L. Ed. 2d 43 (1998),  [**153] is a non sequitur. (See Motion Three at 23-24.) Bestfoods discusses 
the conditions under which a plaintiff may hold a parent corporation liable for its subsidiary's conduct. 524 U.S. at 61. Here, 
under section 3729(a)(1), plaintiffs would hold HC liable for its own conduct -- that is, for its knowing provision of resources 
necessary to HIE's submission of false claims. Furthermore, both plaintiffs clearly alleged a violation of section 3729(a)(1) in their complaints. (See Relator's Fifth Amended 
Complaint [687] PP 92-93; Government's Third Amended Complaint [419] PP 120-22.) Relator's complaint alleges facts that 
support plaintiffs' ""caused to be presented"" theory. (Relator's Fifth Amended Complaint [687] PP 14-18.) Similarly, while the 
government's complaint admittedly focuses on an alter ego theory, it does allege some facts supporting a ""caused to be 
presented"" theory. (Government's Third Amended Complaint [419] PP 23, 25.) HC's expressed surprise, if genuine, is therefore 
unwarranted. "
1599,96," Additionally, defendant Anderson claimed to be ""President and CEO"" of BHIC's ""international operations,"" (Pl.'s Exs. 389, 
568A), and held a power of attorney for BHIC from May 12, 1992 onward, (see Mar. 30, 2007 AM Tr. at 61-62; Pl.'s Ex. 386). 
The jury could reasonably have inferred that after this date, Anderson acted for BHIC as well as for HII and/or HIE."
1599,97," Moreover, it could reasonably have deemed these services essential to the joint venture's ability to perform, and submit false 
claims, on Contract 20A, and it might thus have concluded that BHIC caused these false claims to be made and presented. "
1600,98," In essence, HUK merely posits that another -- in its opinion, better -- explanation of the facts exists. But at this stage in the 
litigation, the relevant question is whether the view adopted by the jury in reaching its verdict was at all reasonable. See 
Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 251, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). The Court must review the record 
as a whole, disregarding all evidence favorable to HUK which the jury was not required to believe, and must draw all reasonable 
inferences in favor of the jury's verdict. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., 530 U.S. 133, 150, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 
2d 105 (2000)."
1600,99," Defendants  [**160] insist plaintiffs offered no evidence that those preparing the bids knew of the conspiracy. (E.g., Motion 
Four at 25.) But as explained herein, there was evidence from which the jury could reasonably have concluded that both Young 
and Anderson knew of the conspiracy and consequently nudged the joint venture's August and December bids upwards. "
1601,100," Plaintiffs also presented evidence that HUK, a nominally independent corporation, was in reality HIE's London office. 
Bookkeeper Terri Mashburn testified that HIE and HUK were treated interchangeably in HII's general ledger, and that ""depositing 
[] into HIE's account was in effect the same thing as depositing [] into [HUK's] account because they were the same general 
ledger books."" (Apr. 5, 2007 AM Tr. at 34-35.) She viewed HUK as ""just one of the offices for HIE."" (Id. at 34.) The jury also 
heard testimony that Anderson, HIE's president, ran the ""Harbert""  [**163] London office shared by HUK. (E.g., Apr. 13, 2007 
AM Tr. at 37-38.) If the jury accepted that HUK was but ""one of the offices for HIE,"" this conclusion would augment the case for 
Anderson's role as HUK's agent."
1601,101," HUK argues that Anderson was not its agent -- and thus the jury could not impute his knowledge -- because it exerted no 
control over him. (Reply Four at 9.) In the classical formulation, an agency relationship exists where the principal authorizes the 
agent to act on his behalf, and the agent subjects himself to the principal's control. Restatement (Third) of Agency § 1.01 (2006). 
When agency rests on apparent, rather than actual, authority, however, the principal need not, and usually does not, control the 
agent because their relationship arises not from mutual assent but from equitable principles: a principal who intentionally or 
negligently creates in another an appearance of authority on which third parties reasonably rely may not later deny such 
authority existed. See id. § 3.03 cmt. b. Nonetheless, plaintiffs offered some evidence from which the jury might have found HUK 
did exert some control over Anderson. Bill Harbert owned 49% of HUK and served as one of its two  [**164] directors. (Apr. 9, 
2007 PM Tr. at 86; Mar. 30, 2007 AM Tr. at 14-15.) It was he who originally sent Anderson, one of his ""two key deputies"" to 
London, where Anderson hired HUK's initial employees and installed himself in HUK's offices. (See Pl.'s Ex. 250; Apr. 24, 2007 
AM Tr. at 11; Apr. 9, 2007 PM Tr. at 75-76.) The jury could thus have concluded HUK, through its director, Harbert, controlled 
Anderson."
1601,102," For the government to have suffered damages, of course,  [**166] this value must exceed what the government actually paid. 
For three reasons, defendants contend it did not. "
1602,," First, defendants point out that before forming its agreement with Harbert-Jones, Fru-Con had independently determined it could 
not profitably perform Contract 20A and thus intended to bid high to avoid securing the contract. (Motion Two at 4; Motion Four 
at 25.) When Kadenbach met with Schmidt and agreed that Fru-Con would bid high in exchange for 2-3% of the final contract 
price, he may have known his company would bid high, regardless. But Schmidt did not. Absent their agreement, Harbert-Jones 
would have believed Fru-Con was a viable competitor striving to submit the lowest bid. Having secured Fru-Con's cooperation, it 
could safely raise its own bids (in August and December 1988) to increase its expected profits, knowing Fru-Con would not 
undercut them. At the very least, to break even, Harbert-Jones would need to raise its bids to cover the cost of the promised 
payoff to Fru-Con. Hence, Fru-Con's secret intent to bid high is irrelevant to whether the government suffered damages. Second, defendants note that Fuller could not obtain bonding and was disqualified from further participation  [**167] after failing 
to bid in August. (Motion Four at 24.) When Iatrou agreed that Fuller would refrain from bidding in exchange for either 3% of the 
contract price less the value of a proposed subcontract, or 5% of the contract price, he may have known that Fuller could not find 
bonding and thus could not bid. But again, Schmidt did not. Without this agreement, Harbert-Jones would have believed Fuller 
was a viable competitor. With it, Harbert-Jones could increase its August bid, comfortable in the knowledge that Fuller would not 
undercut it, and if nothing else, the promised payoff to Fuller raised the joint venture's break-even bid value. Finally, defendants assert that even if the conspiracy had an inflationary effect on the August 1988 bids, this did not transfer to 
the December bids. (Motion Four at 25.) When Harbert-Jones and Fru-Con's August bids came in at more than double the $ 58 
million engineer's estimate, AMBRIC ordered a new engineer's estimate, which yielded a figure of $ 120 million. (Apr. 3, 2007 
PM Tr. at 60, 70.) AMBRIC then reduced the scope of work and lowered its estimate to $ 109 million, a decrease of 9.2%. (Id. at 
68-69, 70.) Because Harbert-Jones reduced its bid  [**168] by 11.6% from August to December, defendants argue, any inflation 
must have been eliminated. (Motion Four at 25 n.13.) By this calculation, the August bid could have incorporated no more than $ 
4 million in padding. (Id.) They offer no basis for this assumption, and indeed, the evidence suggests otherwise. Had Harbert-
Jones secured Contract 20A at a price of $ 129 million, it would have owed 2-3% -- or $ 2.58-3.87 million -- to Fru-Con and at 
least another 3% -- or $ 3.87 million -- to Fuller. If the $ 129 million bid included only $ 4 million in padding, these payoffs would 
have eaten into the joint venture's profits by at least $ 2.45 million. The jury evidently discounted this illogical chain of reasoning."
1602,103," Defendants argue that plaintiffs were required to show that the joint venture did not satisfactorily perform its contractual 
obligations or alternatively, ""evidence of a lower bid by a viable candidate."" (Motion Two at 6 (citing United States ex rel. Ervin & 
Assocs. v. Hamilton Sec. Group, 370 F. Supp. 2d 18, 56 (D.D.C. 2005)).) But the authorities on which they rely are factually 
distinguishable in certain, crucial respects. In Ervin, Judge Oberdorfer examined the Fourth Circuit's  [**169] decision in United 
States ex rel. Harrison v. Westinghouse Savannah River Co., 352 F.3d 908 (4th Cir. 2003), in which the defendants had 
allegedly gained an unfair advantage over other bidders by failing to disclose conflicts of interest. See 370 F. Supp. 2d at 54-55. 
There, the Court of Appeals concluded the plaintiffs had failed to prove damages because they had not shown harm to the 
government. 352 F.3d at 922-23. The plaintiff ""presented no evidence that the government did not get what it paid for or that 
another firm could have performed the work for less."" Id. at 923. Unlike this case, neither Ervin nor Harrison involved collusive bid-rigging. Collusion among bidders, alone, does not preclude the 
plaintiff from presenting ""evidence of a lower bid by a viable candidate."" But where, as here, all viable candidates have allegedly 
participated in the conspiracy -- and the collusive agreement, by its terms, ensures all bids are inflated -- no such evidence will 
exist. Hence, Ervin's language is inapposite, and plaintiffs need not have presented evidence of a lower, viable bid. ""Any other 
rule . . . would be an inducement to make wrongdoing so effective and complete in every case as  [**170] to preclude any 
recovery, by rendering the measure of damages [incalculable]."" Bigelow, 327 U.S. at 264. "
1603,104," This estimate assumed that inexpensive, ""trench box"" shoring would be used  [**171] in some areas but that more costly and 
reliable soldier pile lagging would be used in others. (Id. at 36-40.) It also allowed for ""risk and profit."" (Id. at 35.) During the 
reconciliation meeting, Nagel reluctantly elevated his estimate to $ 103 million at the Harbert team's insistence. (Id. at 41-44.) For several reasons, defendants argue Nagel's original estimate ""cannot properly be considered as the measure of what another 
qualified contractor would have bid for Contract 20A."" (Motion Two at 13-15.) Yet nothing indicates the jury simply adopted this 
measure wholesale -- indeed, defendants' own calculations demonstrate otherwise. (Id. at 7.) Whatever the Nagel estimate's 
flaws as a proxy for what the government would have paid in a competitive environment, such a fairly and conservatively 
computed estimate would have some influence on a competitive bidder's final bid. It was thus relevant evidence which the jury 
could properly consider in calculating damages."
1603,105," Defendants decry this evidence as wholly irrelevant because as of August 1988, Fuller had no intention of submitting this bid, 
and because Fuller's inability to secure bonding would have rendered its bid unacceptable. (Motion  [**172] Two at 9-11.) To be 
relevant, however, evidence need only have some tendency to make any material fact more or less probable. Fed. R. Evid. 401. 
Plaintiffs' witnesses' testimony established that Fuller had experience with similar construction projects, having secured and 
competently performed Contract 25, and that its Cairo team compiled its estimate for Contract 20A. (Mar. 21, 2007 AM Tr. at 79-
81; Apr. 3, 2007 PM Tr. at 58-59.) That Fuller could not, in the end, obtain bonding does not impugn its estimators' calculations. 
Its estimate is simply evidence of what experienced estimators -- such as Harbert-Jones' Alf Hill -- might have compiled had they 
anticipated unfettered competition among the three pre-qualified bidders. In this sense, it is ""demonstrative of what Harbert-
Jones 20A . . . would have tendered absent collusion."" (Contra Motion Two at 10.) Defendants' objections pertain only to the 
weight of the evidence -- which the jury was entitled to assess for itself."
1603,106," After the winning bidder pulled out, and the runner-up commenced and then stopped work, USAID reevaluated the project, 
attempted to mitigate newly materialized risks, and reduced the scope of work. (Apr. 3, 2007 PM Tr. at 50-51.) It then issued a 
revised tender request, Contract 20A. (Id. at 51-52.)"
1603,107," Notably, the jury could also have adjusted the Nagel or Fuller estimates -- or any of the various engineers' estimates -- based 
on evidence of typical profit margins. "
1604,108," To be clear, this ""winning bidder"" would almost certainly have been Harbert-Jones. Fuller's inability to secure bonding would 
render any bid it offered unacceptable, and Fru-Con had pre-determined it would bid high to avoid securing the contract. Given 
 [**176] these facts, the jury's task was, in effect, to calculate what Harbert-Jones would have bid had it believed itself to be truly 
competing with Fuller and Fru-Con. Defendants argue that ""the very lowest the Harbert-Jones 20A bid amount would have been"" 
was $ 124,990,369, a figure that appears in the joint venture's cover letter to CWO, dated July 18, 1988. (Motion Two at 15-16.) 
This presumption ignores, however, that by the letter's date, Schmidt had already narrowed the competitive field by securing 
Fru-Con's cooperation, and it assumes the letter did not anticipate Fuller would agree to refrain from bidding. Hence, the jury 
could reasonably have refused to accept this figure as representative of what Harbert-Jones would have bid under competitive 
conditions."
1604,109," Anderson renews his objection to the admission of Ruggieri's testimony ""on the grounds previously stated to the Court."" 
(Motion One at 5 n.3.) Yet he neither identifies those grounds nor directs the Court to any portion of the record or previously-filed 
document in which they were stated. (See id.) Fortunately for Anderson, HII joins in renewing his objection and specifies its 
basis. (Motion Two at 18 n.11.) Pre-trial, defendants sought to exclude Ruggieri's testimony ""unless and until  [**178] [plaintiffs] 
prove[] by a preponderance of the evidence that there was a conspiracy by these defendants to rig Contract 29."" (Mem. Op. of 
Mar. 20, 2007 [734] at 1.) The Court admitted the testimony under Federal Rule of Evidence 104, and because this testimony 
qualified as non-hearsay under Rule 801(d)(2)(E), the Court now reaffirms its decision. The latter rule provides that an out-of-
court statement is admissible for its truth if the proponent shows by a preponderance of the evidence that: (1) a conspiracy 
existed; (2) the declarant and defendant were members of this conspiracy; and (3) that the statement was made during the 
course and in furtherance of the conspiracy. Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). As explained herein, the record contains evidence from 
which a jury could reasonably find that SUSA and HII, through their agents, Greselin, Ruggieri, and Anderson, agreed to rig bids 
on Contract 29, and that Greselin's statements to Ruggieri were made to finalize this agreement. Thus, Ruggieri's testimony was 
admissible as non-hearsay against both Anderson and HII. "
1605,110," Change orders and additions boosted the amount eventually paid to $ 134-$ 135 million. (Mar. 23, 2007 PM Tr. at 92.)"
1605,111," Greselin did not appear at defendants'  [**182] civil trial but did testify at Anderson's criminal trial. Defendants introduced 
portions of his testimony into evidence during their case. (See Apr. 25, 2007 PM Tr. at 60-81.)"
1605,112," Anderson's contention that Greselin ""was [not] even capable of accepting"" Schmidt's ""double-alternative"" proposal is 
specious. (Motion One at 5.) The presence of alternatives does not defeat an agreement. Using counsel's example, even when 
two friends ""can't decide what restaurant to go to"" without ""further discussion,"" they may nonetheless have agreed they will dine 
together. (May 2, 2007 AM Tr. at 71.) "
1606,113," Anderson asserts that had an agreement been reached,  [**183] Ruggieri and Schmidt would not have negotiated the payoff 
amount -- it would already have been decided. (Motion One at 6.) In particular, he contends that ""[i]f Greselin had followed 
Ruggieri's orders and met with Schmidt to communicate and reach agreement that [SUSA] wanted only to pay money for 
protection on Contract 29, there would have been no reason for Schmidt to press [Ruggieri] for 'in kind' compensation."" (Motion 
One at 4.) This argument is flawed for at least two reasons. First, since the parties' original discussion, circumstances had changed 
markedly: given CWO's reductions in Contract 29's scope and overall value, it was perfectly reasonable to revisit the payoff 
amount. Second, Ruggieri never testified that Schmidt ""pressed"" him for in-kind compensation; instead, he stated he had a 
""feeling"" that Schmidt ""preferred"" compensation in kind to a cash payoff. (Mar. 26, 2007 AM Tr. at 68-69.)"
1606,114," In his reply, Anderson offers a thorough treatise on what constitutes a ""reasonable inference."" (Reply One at 1-3 & n.2.) As is 
likely self-evident, in this Opinion, where the Court discusses inferences the jury could have made, it has determined these 
inferences are ones that ""'reasonable and fair-minded men [and women] in the exercise of impartial judgment' might draw from 
the evidence."" Georgetown Hotel v. NLRB, 266 U.S. App. D.C. 371, 835 F.2d 1467, 1475 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (quoting Daniels v. 
Twin Oaks Nursing Home, 692 F.2d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir. 1982)). Anderson's true quibble appears to be that plaintiffs presented 
no direct evidence on certain points -- the communication cementing the agreement, and his connection to it. (Reply One at 3.) 
He disregards, however, that [c]ircumstantial evidence can be of high probative quality. For example if one goes to bed and there is no snow on the 
ground, and one wakes up to find snow on the ground,  [**185] the snow is powerful evidence -- albeit wholly circumstantial 
-- that it snowed while one was asleep. Kimberlin v. Quinlan, 303 U.S. App. D.C. 330, 6 F.3d 789, 808 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (Edwards, J., dissenting), vacated on other 
grounds by 515 U.S. 321, 115 S. Ct. 2552, 132 L. Ed. 2d 252 (1995). Plaintiffs presented evidence that Ruggieri provided the 
necessary approval for the original ""agreement in principle,"" that he ordered Greselin to carry out the agreement, and that the 
bidding and payoffs transpired as agreed. Just as one may reasonably infer on awaking to a blanketed ground ""that it snowed 
while one was asleep,"" so, here, the jury could have reasonably inferred that the bidding and payoffs occurred pursuant to a 
finalized agreement."
1606,115," Attacking the evidence linking him to the conspiracy, Anderson observes that precedents in ""this District and this Circuit are 
legion that a jury verdict may not rest upon improper inferences or the fact finder's speculation about the evidence,"" and to prove 
his point, he cites and quotes from many of them. (Motion One at 9-12.) He implicitly concedes that whether an inference is 
reasonable or speculative depends heavily on a case's unique facts, and he thus attempts to analogize only one of his 
numerous examples. (Id. at 11 (discussing Wilson v. Good Humor Corp., 244 U.S. App. D.C. 298, 757 F.2d 1293 (D.C. Cir. 
1985)). See also Motion Two at 19-20 (examining same case).) In Wilson, the trial court granted defendant David Williams' motion for a directed verdict because no reasonable jury could find 
that he was the ice cream truck driver whose negligence caused plaintiffs' child's death. 757 F.2d at 1298-99. Plaintiffs 
presented only one identification witness, who testified he spoke with the driver at the accident scene and  [**188] wrote down 
the man's name. Id. at 1298. Yet the witness never visually identified Williams, never offered a physical description of the driver, 
and never produced the paper on which he had transcribed the driver's name. Id. He believed ""vaguely"" that the driver's name 
had been Davis Williams. Id. On appeal, the Court of Appeals agreed that such a ""bare and uncertain identification of the "
1607,," [defendant's] name"" would not, alone, ""permit a reasonable juror to conclude that the vendor at issue was in fact the defendant 
Williams."" Id. Anderson contends the same result should obtain here, where no witness identified Anderson as having attended the Schmidt-
Greselin meeting or described the ""guy from Harbert"" who did. (Motion One at 11.) In Wilson, however, no other evidence linked 
Williams to the accident. Here, as explained below, plaintiffs presented several other pieces of circumstantial evidence 
connecting Anderson to the Schmidt-Greselin meeting. The syllogism proposed in Anderson's reply brief fails precisely because 
it ignores these critical facts. It characterizes Anderson only as ""a Harbert man"" rather than as Harbert's point man for bidding on 
Egyptian construction contracts, who had  [**189] represented HII at meetings hosted by Schmidt to rig bids on other such 
contracts, and whose travel records reflect his presence at the meeting location around the time it occurred."
1607,116," Anderson minutely dissects Ruggieri and Greselin's testimony to demonstrate that his Frankfurt travel could not have 
coincided with the Schmidt-Greselin meeting. (Reply One at 12-13.) But given the lapse of eighteen years, the jury could 
reasonably have inferred that Ruggieri and Greselin's statements about when certain events occurred might be somewhat 
imprecise. While Anderson's travel record, alone, does not prove he attended the Schmidt-Greselin meeting, the jury might 
reasonably have attached some significance to his presence in Frankfurt within mere days of the time frames mentioned by the 
witnesses."
1607,117," Anderson states a more categorical rule: when ""a document is incomplete or deficient on its face . . . [its] admission into 
evidence is deemed improper."" (Motion One at 13.) But the authorities on which he relies do not support this inflexible reading. 
See Weir v. Crown Equip. Corp., 217 F.3d 453, 458-59 (7th Cir. 2000) (though trial court found many of plaintiff's proffered 
accident reports were ""vague, incomplete, and otherwise confusing,"" it nonetheless admitted the most clearly relevant reports); 
Cortes v. Maxus Exploration Co., 758 F. Supp. 1182, 1184-85 (S.D. Tex. 1991)  [**191] (EEOC probable cause determination 
excluded under Rule 403 due to its ""demonstrable lack of probative value""); Seol v. Saipan Honeymoon Corp., 1999 MP 9, 5 N. 
Mar. I. 238, 241 (1999) (trial court, in fairness, should have excluded incomplete exhibit because plaintiffs' counsel refused to 
produce the second page). Rather, in this Circuit, ""application of the rule of completeness is a matter for the trial judge's 
discretion."" United States v. Washington, 304 U.S. App. D.C. 263, 12 F.3d 1128, 1137 (D.C. Cir. 1994). "
1608,118," Anderson suggests only that these pages could have revealed ""whether the government's check was attributable to a change 
order, as opposed to original work,"" but it is unclear why he believes this distinction important. (Motion One at 15.) Once SUSA 
had obtained the contract through collusion, every invoice it submitted was false, see supra note 83, and because this invoice 
fell within the limitations period, Anderson could be held liable for it."
1608,119," Contrary to Anderson's assertion, plaintiffs did lay an evidentiary foundation for the exhibit. (See Mar. 26, 2007 AM Tr. at 85-
87.) They offered testimony from German Gallegos, a former SUSA CFO familiar with its interim billing statements and with the 
checks the U.S. sent in response. (Id. at 75-91.) He identified exhibit 648 as an interim billing statement, number 56, on Contract 
29, with an attached  [**193] U.S. Treasury check in the amount billed. (Id. at 86-87.) He further testified that SUSA maintained 
such records as a regular business practice. (Id. at 87.) Anderson does not indicate in what respect he believes this foundation 
deficient."
1608,120," In the joint venture's 1988 tender documents on Contract 20A, HII represented that it -- not HIE -- owned a majority stake in 
the joint venture, and it held out Roy Anderson as its vice-president. (Pl.'s Exs. 109, 162.) Bill Harbert, then HII's president, had 
sent Anderson to London some years before to work on HII's behalf. (Pl.'s Ex. 250.) He granted Anderson the authority, ""without 
reservation,"" to represent HII in bidding for international construction projects, including Contract 29. (Pl.'s Exs. 116, 653C.) "
1609,121," HII seeks to diminish this reference's significance, (Motion Two at 21-23), but its critique once again relies on an erroneous 
premise -- that one may join a conspiracy after the agreement's inception only so long as it remains wholly executory. See supra 
note 87."
1609,122," Though defendants, in a footnote, state that USAID rules precluded SUSA from submitting a revised  [**198] bid, they cite no 
authority for this proposition. (See Reply Two at 21 n.17.) Hemler, at least, believed that SUSA had ""the opportunity to consider 
a price adjustment just before the commercial bid opening."" (Pl.'s Ex. 77.) Plaintiffs rely in part on Hemler's suspicion that Harbert-Jones had submitted a bid ""around $ 120 million"" in arguing that but for 
Greselin's opposition, Hemler would have reduced SUSA's bid to $ 120 million. (Opposition Two at 26.) The jury may well have 
adopted this logic. As discussed herein, however, even a more conservative reading of the evidence justifies the jury's verdict. "
1610,123," Defendants argue that ""[t]he evidence indicates that CWO would have 'forced the price down'"" to no more than $ 114 million 
under any circumstances because any excess costs would have fallen to the Egyptian government. (Motion Two at 25 (quoting 
Mar. 23, 2007 PM Tr. at 109).) As an initial matter, this argument mischaracterizes a statement Hemler conspicuously couched 
as an ""opinion."" (Mar. 23, 2007  [**200] PM Tr. at 109.) The jury need not have accepted Hemler's opinion, and thus the Court 
need not do so either. See In re Lorazepam & Clorazepate Antitrust Litig., 467 F. Supp. 2d 74, 87 (D.D.C. 2006) (Hogan, C.J.) 
(on a Rule 50(b) motion, the court ""must disregard all evidence favorable to the movant that the jury was not required to 
believe""). Nonetheless, even if credited, defendants' premise does not redeem their causation argument. They imply CWO had 
no incentive to negotiate a price below $ 114 million because USAID had promised to contribute that sum. Arguably, it was in 
CWO's interest to negotiate as much work from SUSA as it could get for that $ 114 million. Thus, USAID would have paid $ 114 
million regardless of the amount of SUSA's bid. Assuming this was the case, however, absent the bid-rigging, CWO would have 
had to eliminate fewer line items from the bid -- and thus would have received more value in return for its $ 114 million -- to 
reach the magic number. However defendants wish to construe the situation, the government still suffered compensable harm 
due to the bid-rigging."
1610,124," Soon afterward, Anderson traveled to Boise, Idaho, where Morrison-Knudsen had located its headquarters, and his travel 
record suggests he at least planned to visit Morrison-Knudsen. (Pl.'s Ex. 607; Apr. 4, 2007 PM Tr. at 73-74.) Defendants offered "
1611,," video deposition testimony from Morrison-Knudsen executives that indicated Anderson never proposed any sort of financial 
arrangement on Contract 07 to them. (See Apr. 25, 2007 PM Tr. at 26-27.)"
1611,125," Even HII appears to acknowledge, in its reply brief, that a loser's fee arrangement could give rise to FCA liability. (See Reply 
Two at 22.) BHIC, on the other hand, insists that ""collusion, like bid rigging, requires that competition be eliminated."" (Reply Four 
at 15 (citing Hess, 317 U.S. at 543.) This semantic argument is a non sequitur -- nothing in the FCA requires a jury to find 
""collusion"" to hold a party liable. Moreover, while the collusion in Hess did consist of a ""conspiracy to remove all possible 
competition,"" the Supreme Court in no way suggested that its description of the jury's factual findings in that case should be read 
as exclusively defining collusion within the FCA. See 317 U.S. at 543. Here, plaintiffs' expert testified that the term ""collusion"" 
embraces any situation in which a group of firms or individuals get together to try to circumvent the competitive process and 
generally increase the price."" (Apr. 5, 2007 PM Tr.  [**206] at 77.) A jury could reasonably find that this much broader definition, 
which defendants did not challenge, encompasses the loser's fee arrangement on Contract 07."
1611,126," HII again disclaims responsibility of Anderson's knowledge and conduct; alternatively, it insists Anderson knew nothing of the 
loser's fee agreement. (Motion Two at 27; Reply Two at 22-23.) As to each contention, there was evidence from which the jury 
could reasonably have  [**208] reached the opposite conclusion. "
1612,," First, it could have imputed Anderson's knowledge and actions in willfully joining and advancing the collusive conspiracy on 
Contract 07 to HII. HII expressly empowered Anderson to act on its behalf in bidding on Contract 07, (see PI.'s Ex. 652C), and 
Anderson thereafter signed and identified himself as an HII officer on documents related to Contract 07, (see PI.'s Ex. 145; 
Def.'s Ex. 368). At the Frankfurt meeting on Contract 07, three individuals -- Hoffmeister, Schmidt, and Anderson -- discussed a 
collusive arrangement involving three companies -- Fru-Con, J.A. Jones, and HII. (See Mar. 22, 2007 PM Tr. at 64-65.) At the 
meeting, Hoffmeister represented, respectively, J.A. Jones and HII. Second, Anderson's evident role as Schmidt's partner in the Contract 07 scheme indicates he would have known about the 
loser's fee agreement. At the Frankfurt meeting, Schmidt delegated the task of contacting the last remaining competitor, 
Morrison-Knudsen, to Anderson. (Id. at 67.) Anderson accepted this duty, and plaintiffs offered some evidence that he pursued 
it, albeit unsuccessfully. (See Pl. Ex. 607; Apr. 4, 2007 PM Tr. at 73-74; Apr. 25, 2007 PM Tr. at 26-27.)  [**209] Additionally, in 
November 1990, Anderson spoke with John Ollis of Jones, who was then working on the Harbert-Jones Contract 07 bid. (Mar. 
27, 2007 PM Tr. at 40-42.) When Ollis brought up that Jones' estimating team had not yet arranged a reconciliation meeting with 
their Harbert counterparts, Anderson told him that ""this thing had been set up,"" and that all the pre-qualified contractors ""were 
part of the setup."" (Id. at 41-42.) Though inaccurate -- no party disputes that Morrison-Knudsen was not ""part of the setup"" -- 
Anderson's statement does indicate he knew an agreement had been reached on Contract 07 -- more than he would have 
known had his involvement ended after the Frankfurt meeting. From this evidence, the jury could reasonably have concluded that Anderson knew of the loser's fee arrangement and imputed 
his knowledge to HII. Reasoning that but for the collusive conspiracy, which HII had, through Anderson, willfully joined, claims 
submitted on Contract 07 would not have been false, the jury could have held HII liable for causing these false claims to be 
made and presented to the government."
1612,127," The jury might also have recalled that Anderson claimed to be ""President and CEO"" of  [**210] BHIC's ""international 
operations,"" (Pl.'s Exs. 389, 568A), and held a power of attorney for BHIC from May 12, 1992 onward, (see Mar. 30, 2007 AM 
Tr. at 61-62; Pl.'s Ex. 386). It might reasonably have inferred that after this date, Anderson acted for BHIC as well as for HII 
and/or HIE. Armed with Anderson's knowledge, BHIC provided support services essential to the joint venture's performance of 
Contract 07. (See Pl.'s Exs. 383, 615B-E, 682; Apr. 4, 2007 PM Tr. at 97-111.) From these facts, the jury could reasonably have 
concluded that BHIC willfully joined and advanced the conspiracy, and knowingly caused false claims to be created and 
presented to the government on Contract 07. See United States ex rel. Schmidt v. Zimmer, Inc., 386 F.3d 235, 244 (3d Cir. 
2004)."
1612,128," According to defendants, the jury must have extracted this value from a Contract 20A payoff invoice, which would amount to 
clear error. (Motion Two at 28-29 (citing Pl.'s Exs. 617, 618); Motion Seven at 2-4.) Throughout their filings, defendants 
repeatedly accuse plaintiffs and the jury of speculation, but the proverbial shoe now seems to be on the other foot. While HII has 
identified a striking coincidence, it again conflates correlation with causation. In reviewing a damages award, a court may not 
hypothesize as to the precise formula the jury adopted. Carter, 727 F.2d at 1239. Its duty is simply to confirm that the award falls 
""within a reasonable range"" and is supported by the evidence. Id. As explained herein, the jury's Contract 07 damages award 
satisfies both criteria."
1612,129," HII asserts that because the Court admitted Rainer Hermann's prior testimony against Anderson, alone, and Hoffmeister 
 [**212] learned of the payment from Hermann, the record contains no evidence admissible against HII that the fee was actually 
paid. (Motion Two at 30.) This Court limited Hermann's former testimony's admissibility because only Anderson had had an 
opportunity to cross-examine him. (See Mem. Op. of Mar. 16, 2007 [722] at 7.) But this limitation extended only to Hermann's 
prior testimony at Anderson's criminal trial -- not to out-of-court statements he had previously made to co-conspirators. (See id. 
at 4-7.) The jury was free to consider these hearsay statements, admitted through Hoffmeister, against all defendants. "
1613,130," Alf Hill testified that he personally prepared the Harbert-Jones Contract 07 bid without influence from Anderson and that to his 
knowledge, the bidding was competitive. (See Apr. 11, 2007 PM Tr. at 23, 25, 30, 106.) Yet Anderson's comments to Ollis -- ""he 
and Alf Hill needed room to maneuver"" -- implicate Hill in the conspiracy, (see Mar. 27, 2007 PM Tr. at 41), so the jury need not 
have credited Hill's assertions  [**214] of non-involvement, In re Lorazepam & Clorazepate Antitrust Litig., 467 F. Supp. 2d 74, 
87 (D.D.C. 2006) (Hogan, C.J.)."
1613,131," As the Court of Appeals instructed in Gatling, ""a conspiracy's purpose should not be defined in too narrow or specific terms."" 
96 F.3d at 1520. See also United States v. Tarantino, 269 U.S. App. D.C. 398, 846 F.2d 1384, 1393 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (citing ""the "
1614,," possession and distribution of narcotics for profit"" as a shared goal sufficiently particularized to support a single conspiracy). 
Here, the shared goal of boosting profit by limiting competition on a particularized set of government-funded contracts is more 
than sufficiently narrow to support a single, overarching conspiracy."
1614,132," The written bid-rigging agreement on Contract 20A contemplates future collusion on Contract 29, (see Pl.'s Ex. 1; Mar. 21, 
2007 AM Tr. at 29-30); Schmidt proposed a quid pro quo on Contract 29 to SUSA, (Mar. 23, 2007 PM Tr. at 120-21); and 
Anderson blithely referred to the companies pre-qualified by USAID to bid on Egyptian infrastructure projects as ""the Frankfurt 
Club,"" (Mar. 27, 2007 PM Tr. at 44)."
1614,133," For example,  [**217] both Harbert-Jones and Fru-Con participated in collusion on Contracts 20A and 07, with Fru-Con 
receiving payoffs for its cooperation in both instances. (See Mar. 22, 2007 AM Tr. at 80-94; Mar. 22, 2007 PM Tr. at 63-70; Pl.'s 
Exs. 17, 18.)"
1614,134," Schmidt, and to a slightly lesser extent, Anderson, emerged as ringleaders in coordinating collusion among bidders on each 
contract. (See, e.g., Mar. 22, 2007 AM Tr. at 80-94 (describing Schmidt's role in bid-rigging on Contract 20A); Mar. 21, 2007 AM 
Tr. at 40-45 (describing Anderson's attendance and conduct at meeting to finalize payoffs to Fuller on Contract 20A); Mar. 23,

2007 PM Tr. at 63-70 (describing Schmidt-initiated loser's fee arrangement on Contract 07 and Anderson's role in securing 
agreement of all competitors); supra note 126 (discussing evidence from which jury could reasonably have concluded Anderson 
knew of the loser's fee arrangement).)"
1614,135," (See, e.g., Mar. 22, 2007 AM Tr. at 91-95; Pl.'s Exs.  [**218] 17-18; Mar. 21, 2007 AM Tr. at 76-80; Mar. 25, 2007 AM Tr. at 
18-30; Pl.'s Exs. 21, 22, 365, 372-79, 635, 637.)"
1614,136," In Anderson's criminal case, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals sustained the jury's guilty verdict as to Sherman Act 
conspiracy based on a similar body of evidence. See United States v. Anderson, 326 F.3d 1319, 1327-28 (11th Cir. 2003)."
1614,137," In a final, ""kitchen sink"" footnote, HII also requests reconsideration of the Court's ruling that the government's Contract 20A 
claims relate back to the filing date of relator's sealed complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c)(2). (Motion 
Two at 33 n.23.) HII again directs the Court's attention to United States v. Baylor University Medical Center, 469 F.3d 263 (2d 
Cir. 2006), where the Second Circuit Court of Appeals held that under this Rule, claims in a government complaint in intervention 
do not relate back to the date a qui tam complaint was filed under seal. See 469 F.3d at 270. As this Court previously concluded, "
1615,," however, Baylor's reasoning and holding do not bind this Court, and decisions in this Circuit have uniformly held that relation 
back under Rule 15(c)(2)  [**220] does apply to FCA claims. See United States ex rel. Ortega v. Columbia Healthcare, Inc., 240 
F. Supp. 2d 8, 14 (D.D.C. 2003) (Lamberth, J.); United States ex rel. Purcell v. MWI Corp., 254 F. Supp. 2d 69, 75-76 (D.D.C. 
2003) (Urbina, J.). Hence, the Court reaffirms its prior holding. (See Mem. Op. & Order of Mar. 14, 2007 [711] at 4.) Moreover, notwithstanding Baylor, Rule 15(c)(1) authorizes relation back where the law that provides the statute of limitations 
applicable to the action permits. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1). ""[I]f that law affords a more forgiving principle of relation back than the 
one provided in this rule, it should be available to save the claim."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15 Advisory Committee's Note. Certain 
characteristics of the FCA demonstrate it is one such law. Specifically, the FCA requires relators to file their complaints under 
seal and to then stand idly by while the government investigates the alleged fraud. 31 U.S.C. §3730(b) (2008). By its terms, at 
least, the statute places no limitation on the duration of the government's investigation: though initially limited to sixty days, a 
district court can extend the investigation period for good cause shown. Id. The government  [**221] may intervene at any time 
before this investigation period ends. Id. Moreover, nothing in the FCA otherwise limits the government's ability to seek redress 
for related, fraudulent conduct it uncovers during its investigation, whether or not it satisfies Rule 15(c)(2). As seen in this very 
case, this leniency poses practical problems, but one cannot deny that the FCA purposefully affords the government great 
latitude to conduct a thorough -- and if necessary, lengthy -- investigation before filing its complaint. Based on this rationale, at 
least one other district court has held that government complaints in intervention relate back to the filing date of the relator's 
original, sealed complaint under Rule 15(c)(1). See United States ex rel. Ven-A-Care of the Fla. Keys., Inc. v. Dey, Inc. (In re 
Pharm. Indus. Average Wholesale Price Litig.), 498 F. Supp. 2d 389, 397-99 (D. Mass. 2007). Indeed, Baylor, itself, concedes 
""[t]here is a colorable argument that the FCA implicitly 'permit[s]' a form of relation back."" 469 F.3d at 270. Hence, even if the 
government's claims did not relate back under Rule 15(c)(2), Rule 15(c)(1) would nonetheless save them."
1615,138," Because HII does not identify particular exhibits or testimony which it believes would prompt the Court to question its previous 
conclusion, (see Motion Two at 31), the Court's reconsideration begins and ends with this determination. It is not enough merely to mention  [**223] a possible argument in the most skeletal way, leaving the court to do counsel's 
work, create the ossature for the argument, and put flesh on its bones . . . Judges are not expected to be mindreaders. 
Consequently, a litigant has an obligation to spell out its arguments squarely and distinctly, or else forever hold its peace. Schneider v. Kissinger, 366 U.S. App. D.C. 408, 412 F.3d 190, 200 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 2005). "
1616,139," Notably, defendants' pre-trial motion sought to exclude evidence of ""meetings, conversations, or other alleged 'conspiratorial' 
conduct that occurred prior to June 30, 1989, offered for the purpose of proving an underlying conspiratorial agreement."" (See 
Mem. Supp. HII and HC's Mot. in Limine to Exclude Evidence [557] at 6.) As a matter of logic, meetings and conversations 
during which the  [**227] parties reach agreement cannot logically be considered acts in furtherance of that agreement. 
Furthermore, the ""meetings, conversations, [and] other alleged 'conspiratorial' conduct"" that defendants sought to exclude were 
not necessarily ""overt acts"" as contemplated by Fisher. Fisher's analysis rested on the Court of Appeals' holding in Lawrence 
that ""the statute of limitations in a civil damages action for conspiracy runs separately from each overt act that is alleged to 
cause damage to the plaintiff."" 665 F.2d at 1324 (emphasis added). Lawrence, itself, does not delimit the evidence a civil 
conspiracy plaintiff may use for particular purposes but rather the conspiracy-generated injuries for which a plaintiff may recover. 
See id. Accord Scherer v. Balkema, 840 F.2d 437, 439-40 (7th Cir. 1988) (setting forth rationale for confining civil conspiracy 
plaintiff's recovery to injuries caused by overt acts within the limitations period). To the extent Fisher imposes evidentiary 
limitations, its references to ""overt acts"" can reasonably be read to mean ""overt acts that [are] alleged to [have] cause[d] 
damage."" See Fisher, 180 F. Supp. 2d at 195; Lawrence, 665 F.2d at 1324. This is so because  [**228] evidence of such acts 
transpiring outside the limitations period is irrelevant: under Lawrence, the plaintiff cannot recover for the injuries they caused. 
See Fisher, 180 F. Supp. 2d at 195 (rejecting as contrary to Lawrence relator's position that overt acts occurring prior to the 
limitations date ""are relevant as part of a continuing violation theory""). Evidence of other overt acts will not necessarily pose the 
same relevancy problem. "
1617,140," Anderson also asks the Court to modify the Judgment to reflect that he is not liable for the relator's attorneys' fees and costs. 
(Motion One at 33.) The Court will address this argument in its Opinion on relator's motion for fees."
1617,141," Seeking a new trial, Anderson contends the jury calculated damages based on HII's 60% share in the Harbert-Jones joint 
venture that bid on Contract 29. (See Motion One at 20.) This is pure speculation. In reviewing the amount of the jury's award, [the court] need not -- and indeed cannot -- reconstruct the precise 
mathematical formula that the jury adopted. Nor need [it] explore every possible quantitative analysis or compute the basis 
of every penny and dollar in the award. [Its] inquiry ends once [it is] satisfied that the award is within a reasonable range 
and that the jury did not engage in speculation or improper activity. "
1618,," Carter v. Duncan-Huggins, Ltd., 234 U.S. App. D.C. 126, 727 F.2d 1225, 1239 (D.C. Cir. 1984). The law simply does not permit 
a court to hypothesize as to how the jury must have calculated specific awards. And as explained above, the jury followed the 
proper damages measure in reaching a just and reasonable estimate of ""the difference between what the United States paid and 
what it would  [**232] have paid had there been no bid-rigging agreement."" Anderson's motion for a new trial on this ground shall 
be DENIED."
1618,142," The government had received $ 3.2 million from Bilfinger & Berger, $ 500,000 from AICI, and $ 10 million from ABB SUSA. 
(Mem. Op. of Aug. 10, 2007 [882] at 3.)"
1618,143," In McDermott, the Supreme Court debated the merits of two approaches before adopting the proportionate share rule for 
admiralty cases. 511 U.S. at 208-217 (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts § 886A (1977)). While it ultimately deemed the pro 
tanto rule without contribution inferior, it found ""arguments for the two approaches [were] closely matched,"" and its choice rested 
largely on the proportionate  [**235] share rule's consistency with its earlier decision in United States v. Reliable Transfer Co., 
421 U.S. 397, 95 S. Ct. 1708, 44 L. Ed. 2d 251 (1975), another admiralty case. 511 U.S. at 217. Lower court decisions since McDermott emphasize that this same outcome need not result in all other, non-admiralty contexts, 
and that the pro tanto rule without contribution remains a viable alternative. See Am. Cyanamid v. Capuano, 381 F. 3d 6, 20-21 
(1st Cir. 2004) (noting that CERCLA does not dictate partial settlement's impact on contribution rights among joint wrongdoers 
but allows district court to choose among various approaches); Schadel v. Iowa Interstate R.R., Ltd., 381 F.3d 671, 678 (7th Cir. 
2004) (approving pro tanto approach in FELA case); Fluck v. Blevins, 969 F. Supp. 1231, 1237 (D. Or. 1997) (""choice of the 
proportionate liability method in McDermott does not necessarily mean that the Court would adopt that method for crediting a 
partial settlement in a securities case""). "
1619,144," The law disfavors double recovery as unjust enrichment, so ""a plaintiff who has recovered any item of damage from one 
coconspirator may not again recover the same item from another conspirator."" See Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, 
Inc., 401 U.S. 321, 348, 91 S. Ct. 795, 28 L. Ed. 2d 77 (1971).  [**236] To effectuate this rule, a non-settling defendant is entitled 
to offset his liability based on amounts received from settling joint wrongdoers, but only to the extent those settlement payments 
relate to the same item(s) of damages. Logically, a defendant cannot offset his liability based on compensatory payments for 
harms for which he bears no responsibility. Thus, here, HUK merited a credit based on the portion of the $ 13.7 million 
aggregate that redressed the government's damages on Contract 20A, and Anderson deserved a credit in the amount 
attributable to the government's damages on claim 56 of Contract 29. This conclusion comports with the motivating rationale in 
another case discussed in this Court's Memorandum Opinion -- namely, the avoidance of unjust enrichment. See Rose v. 
Associated Anesthesiologists, 163 U.S. App. D.C. 246, 501 F.2d 806 (D.C. Cir. 1974)."
1619,145," The jury determined the government suffered damages of $ 29,920,000.00 on Contract 20A; $ 3,400,000.00 on Contract 29; 
and $ 1,026,029.22 on Contract 07. (Verdict Form [858] at 9, 10, 12.) Thus, Contract 20A accounted for 87.11% of the 
government's total damages, Contract 29 for 9.899%, and Contract 07 for 2.987%. (Mem. Op. [882] at 10.) The Court applied 
the jury's proportions to the total settlement payment value and found that of the $ 13.7 million, $ 11,934,546 applied to Contract 
20A; $ 1,356,200 to Contract 29; and $ 409,234 to Contract 07. (Id.)"
1619,146," The credit applies to Anderson's trebled liability of $ 139,615.20. United States v. Bornstein, 423 U.S. 303, 316-17, 96 S. Ct. 
523, 46 L. Ed. 2d 514 (1976) (""[I]n computing the [] damages authorized by the [FCA], the Government's actual damages are to 
be doubled before any subtractions are made for compensatory payments previously received by the Government from any 
source.""). Incorporating the $ 18,563.50 credit, and the $ 10,000 statutory penalty reduces this amount to $ 131,051.70. "
1620,147," Defendants plaintively offer that they will almost certainly never engage  [**240] in bid-rigging or similar wrongful conduct in 
future. (See Motion One at 35 n.18; Motion Seven at 13.) Even if these defendants have learned their lesson, the penalty's 
deterrence purpose is broader: the Court hoped the $ 10,000 per claim statutory penalty it imposed in this case would serve as a 
""deterrent to future conduct from entities in similar situations,"" not the deterrent to these defendants. (See Mem. Op. of Aug. 10, 
2007 [882] at 9.)"
1620,148," Other courts had utilized these factors. See Hays v. Hoffman, 325 F.3d 982, 994 (8th Cir. 2003) (factoring seriousness of 
misconduct and harm caused by the misconduct into civil penalty calculation); United States v. Rogan, 459 F. Supp. 2d 692, 727 
(N.D. Ill. 2006) (same); Ervin, 370 F. Supp. 2d at 50 (considering wrongdoers' scienter in calculating civil penalty)."
1620,149," For example, defendants find fault with the Court's observations that:  [**241] ""Anderson was present at, and participated in 
meetings at which the rigging of bids was discussed and agreed upon[,] . . . [and] as managing partner of the Harbert Jones 
Joint Venture, submitted tenders on the contracts at issue to the government, with the knowledge of the bid-rigging conspiracy[;]"" 
and Bill Harbert, who ""held various ownership and officer positions at the various corporate entities involved in the bid-rigging 
conspiracy,"" possessed the requisite knowledge thereof. (Mem. Op. [882] at 9.) The Court has already extensively canvassed 
both men's intimate involvement in the conspiracy. See supra part III.A. Defendants also challenge the Court's consideration of their efforts to cover up their scheme. (Mem. Op. of Aug. 10, 2007 [882] 
at 8-9.) Yet the jury heard evidence of -- for example -- a fraudulent ""sale-leaseback"" transaction that raised the Harbert-Jones 
joint venture's apparent costs on Contract 20A (and consequently, lowered its apparent profits) by $ 10.4 million. (Joint 
Stipulation 1.) They also heard testimony that the joint venture hid an additional $ 6 million in profits on Contract 20A by 
funneling them first to Contract 27, and then to Contract 33A, on the  [**242] false premise that these projects would ultimately 
incur expenses attributable to Contract 20A. (Apr. 10, 2007 AM Tr. at 84-89.) Defendants propose an alternative explanation for each suspicious practice. (See Motion Seven at 10-12.) They assert that Bill 
Harbert designed the sale-leaseback transaction to depress HII's value and to create a pool of funds from which he could 
subsequently purchase an interest in HII at a bargain price. (Motion Seven at 10.) But the ""unanimous testimony"" they cite 
consists of single-source hearsay, and they ignore that this transaction ultimately lined Jones' pockets as well as Harbert's. (See 
Mar. 27, 2007 PM Tr. at 88-89; Mar. 28, 2007 PM Tr. at 107; Mar. 29, 2007 PM Tr. at 17-18; Joint Stipulation 1.) Further, they 
characterize their ""cost-shifting"" among various contracts as legitimate. (Motion Seven at 10-11.) But as testimony at trial 
established, because the costs were never actually incurred, the joint venture ought then to have amended Contract 20A's 
books accordingly. (Apr. 10, 2007 AM Tr. at 84-89.) Particularly considered in light of the other evidence of bid-rigging on 
Contract 20A, the Court, like the jury, found defendants' explanations  [**243] implausible. "
1621,150," Defendant Anderson suffers from Alzheimer's, a cruel and debilitating disease, and the Court is not without compassion for 
his plight. Yet as the Court recounted in its Memorandum Opinion, Anderson's actions lay at the heart of the conspiracy: Defendant Anderson was present at, and participated in meetings at which the rigging of bids was discussed and agreed 
upon. Moreover, defendant Anderson, as managing director of the Harbert Jones Joint Venture, submitted tenders on the 
contracts at issue to the government, with the knowledge of the bid-rigging conspiracy. (Mem. Op. of Aug. 10, 2007 [882] at 9.) His present condition in no way mitigates  [**245] the egregiousness of his former 
conduct. "
1634,1," The UFOC is a separate document from the actual franchise agreement and it appears to come into play before the franchise 
agreement, itself, is actually signed."

1634,4," Such officials included Dave Ron, Adam Torine (Villa's Vice President of Business Development), Alex Rivera (Villa's 
Construction Manager), John Drinkard (Villa's Director of Marketing) and a Mr. Scotto (according to Plaintiffs, ""an officer of 
Defendants"")."
1634,5," The final bid came from MBK Construction in the amount of $ 296,000. "
1635,6," The tying product, according to Plaintiffs, is the franchise, including trademarks. The tied products allegedly included all 
products and services that the Plaintiffs were required to purchase from Defendants, its suppliers,  [*7] and contractors with 
which Plaintiffs were ""forced"" to do business (as opposed to being able to purchase said products and services cheaper on the 
open market)."
1635,7," Plaintiffs do not proffer a reason in their complaint as to why Nick Valavanis asked Gilbert to leave except to say that his

722 (3d Cir. 1991)). "
1637,10," This is as opposed to narrower groupings such as ""Ford cars"" and ""American passenger cars,"" because if Ford raised its 
prices while having a monopoly over either of those groups, customers could either buy Chevrolet passenger cars or foreign 
passengers  [*14] cars and not be forced to pay a premium."
1637,11," Hovenkamp indicates that it was not necessary to analyze broader markets such as ""passenger vehicles"" or ""vehicles"" 
because ""passenger cars"" was the smallest market where elasticity of demand would be low enough to constitute a relevant 
antitrust market. "
1638,12," The Supreme Court, in Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Services, Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 119 L. Ed. 2d 
265 (1992), held that ""the market  [*21] for repair parts and services for Kodak photo-copiers was a valid relevant market "
1639,," because repair parts and services for Kodak machines are not interchangeable with the service and parts used to fix other 
copiers."" Queen City, 124 F.3d at 439 (citing Eastman Kodak). The Plaintiffs in Queen City argued that Eastman Kodak 
supported its proposed relevant market because the Court's holding indicated that HN11[
] sometimes ""a single brand of a 
product or service may constitute a relevant market. This is correct where the commodity is unique, and therefore not 
interchangeable with other products."" Id. However, the Queen City court observed that the products and ingredients used in 
Domino's franchises were not unique, and were interchangeable with other available items on the market (contractual restraints 
notwithstanding). Id. Thus, the Eastman Kodak uniqueness exception was of no help to the plaintiffs. Similarly, this exception is 
of no help to Plaintiffs in this case, as their arguments are analogous to those found in Queen City."
1639,13," With regard, specifically, to the Section 1 claims, Plaintiffs allege to have pled a ""per se"" violation of Section 1, and therefore 
need not plead a relevant market. Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint, at paragraph 147, notes that ""Defendants' tying 
arrangements in its Narrow Path Failure constitutes a per se violation of the Sherman Act"" and paragraph 148 argues that 
because of this alleged per se violation, ""Plaintiffs need not demonstrate that the effects of the tie are unreasonable."" However, 
this District has held  [*24] that ""[t]ying cases are not . . . subject to per se analysis."" In re Mercedes-Benz Antitrust Litig., 157 F. 
Supp. 2d 355, 361 (D.N.J. 2001). Thus, Plaintiff must identify a relevant market and has not adequately pled a per se Sherman 
Act violation. "

Mangram case is the closest analogue available at the present time. "

set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief."" Conley, 355 U.S. at 45-46. "
1654,6," The existence of excess PSL production capacity in general is characteristic of an industry conducive to coordinated behavior. 
See In re High Fructose Corn Syrup Antitrust Litig., 295 F.3d 651, 657 (7th Cir. 2002) (Posner, J.,) (""And the defendants had a 
lot of excess capacity, a condition that makes price competition more than usually risky and collusion more than usually 
attractive.""). "
1655,7," New allegations in the Second Amended Complaint raise additional inferences supporting Plaintiffs' theory. First, 
 [**25] Plaintiffs allege that Avery sought to ""create an oligopoly"" with MACtac. (Second Am. Compl. P 44.) The absence of 
competition among the largest producers of PSL suggests that Avery realized its objective. Second, Plaintiffs allege that Avery 
and UPM negotiated an agreement whereby Avery agreed to purchase label papers from UPM in consideration for UPM's 
promise to abstain from expanding its PSL business in the United States. (Id. P 48.) Although MACtac was not a party to this 
agreement, Plaintiffs allege that as early as 1998 MACtac knew of the agreement -- despite Avery's and UPM's agreement to 
keep their arrangement confidential. (Id. P 49.) That MACtac was aware of the agreement, and that its forbearance from 
competing with Avery was consistent with Avery's and UPM's own non-compete agreement, suggests its participation in an 
overarching conspiracy to restrain competition. See In re Flat Glass, 385 F.3d at 363.  [**26] When viewed in conjunction with 
the allegations of excess capacity and supra-competitive prices -- all of which are accepted as true for purposes of this motion -- 
these averments suggest MACtac's behavior was not independent action, but, instead, the product of an agreement."
1655,8," The cases cited by MACtac and Bemis decided post-Twombly and  [**29] resulting in dismissal of antitrust complaints are not 
to the contrary. Like Twombly, those cases involved antitrust complaints that rested solely on allegations of parallel conduct. For 
example, in Kendall v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., 518 F.3d 1042, 1048 (9th Cir. 2008), plaintiffs alleged that defendant banks conspired to 
fix fees charged to merchants in the processing of credit card transactions. Other than their allegation that the banks charged 
similar fees, plaintiffs failed to plead any facts suggesting a conspiracy, and their complaint was dismissed. Id. In In re Late Fee 
and Over-Limit Fee Litigation, 528 F. Supp. 2d 953, 961-62 (N.D. Cal. 2007), plaintiffs alleged that defendant banks conspired to "
1656,," fix late fees assessed on credit card accounts, but their complaint lacked any facts plausibly suggesting a preceding agreement. 
(See also Ex. A to Bemis's & MACtac's Notice Supplemental. Auth. Supp. Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. Entry 375-2; Exs. 1-2 to Bemis's & 
MACtac's Notice Supplemental Auth. Supp. Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. Entries 366-2 & 366-3.) The Second Amended Complaint, 
however, goes beyond allegations of parallel conduct and describes market conditions, discussions between MACtac and Avery 
 [**30] personnel, and other facts that suggest MACtac acted pursuant to an agreement. "
1657,9," In relevant part, the email states: We are currently examining several price increase options and will make a decision in the next few weeks. The mood at the 
TLMI conference was very cautious. Generally, the feedback is that Avery . . . is not doing well. I doubt that they will follow 
a price increase given their traditional concern over share maintenance/growth and fear that Raflatac may not follow. Other: 
Lots of sidebar conversations about Raflatac. . . . Plenty of supplier grumbling about the questionable business value of the 
conference versus enormous expenses to attend. Nothing really new here but the noise was louder indicating how painful 
this year has been from a profit  [**35] perspective. As one very big competitor put it ""let's face it. We are being held 
hostage here. Back out and you will be punished."" My own supplier committee members discussing their use of the Roll 
Stock Statistics to support their assertions to their own senior management and analysts that this past year has been ugly 
(units up; selling prices down; working harder to earn less). Another strong indication of both the need for price increases 
but the fear of share loss if even one big player doesn't follow. Obviously, we did not have any such overtly direct 
conversations but the message was absolutely crystal clear. (Ex. A to Defs. Mem. Law, Dkt. Entry 307-2.) "
1662,1," Following oral argument, Korean Air and Plaintiffs  [*4] filed requests for judicial notice of court records in the recently-settled 
case In re International Air Transportation Surcharge Antitrust Litigation, MDL No. 1793, Case No. M: 06-cv-01793-CRB, 2008 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50415. (See Docket Nos. 149, 152, & 153.) The requests are GRANTED. See Reyn's Pasta Bella, LLC v. Visa 
USA, Inc., 442 F.3d 741, 746 n.6 (9th Cir. 2006) (taking judicial notice of documents related to a settlement in another case). "
1663,2," The plea, and corresponding fine, also encompassed criminal  [*5] antitrust violations for Korean Air's involvement in a price-
fixing conspiracy concerning air cargo transportation. (SAC P 39.)"
1663,3," Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides, in part, that ""[e]very contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or 
conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."" 15 
U.S.C. § 1."
1663,4," Defendants do not specify whether this argument is to be considered under Rule 12(b)(1) or Rule 12(b)(6). Because the Court 
does not have subject matter jurisdiction if Plaintiffs lack standing to assert their Sherman Act claim, cf. Warren v. Fox Family 
Worldwide, Inc., 328 F.3d 1136, 1140 (9th Cir. 2003) (""[I]f Warren lacks standing to assert his federal copyright claims, the 
district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction and dismissal was appropriate.""), the Court addresses the issue under Rule 
12(b)(1), see In re Ditropan Xl Antitrust Litig., MDL No. 1761, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78423, 2007 WL 2978329, at *1 (N.D. Cal. 
Oct. 11, 2007) (reviewing a challenge to the plaintiff's direct purchaser  [*8] status under Rule 12(b)(1)). "
1664,5," The Court recognizes that a motion to dismiss for lack of antitrust standing is more properly considered under Rule 12(b)(6). 
See NicSand, Inc. v. 3M Co., 507 F.3d 442, 449-50 (6th Cir. 2007); see also Mendoza v. Zirkle Fruit Co., 301 F.3d 1163, 1171 
(9th Cir. 2002). However, because the antitrust standing analysis follows from the FTAIA analysis, the Court includes its brief 
antitrust standing discussion in this section of the Order for purposes of organizational coherence and clarity."
1664,6," The exceptions to this  [*9] rule are: (1) where an indirect purchaser receives goods from the direct purchaser according to a 
preexisting cost-plus contract; or (2) where the direct purchaser is controlled or owned by another party, either by the seller or 
the indirect purchaser. In re Ditropan,  2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78423, 2007 WL 2978329, at *3 (citing Illinois Brick, 431 U.S. at 
726 n.2, 736 n.16)."
1664,7," Defendants contend that SAC's class definition ""inevitably includes those who did not purchase directly and who do not come 
within either Illinois Brick exception."" (Asiana Mot. 5.) While the class definition appears overbroad (see SAC P 47), ""[b]ecause 
 [*10] no class has yet been certified in this putative class action, the Court must treat the action as an individual action by the 
named plaintiffs."" Latino Quimica-Amtex S.A. v. Akzo Nobel Chems. B.V., No. 03 Civ. 10312, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19788, 
2005 WL 2207017, at *1 n.2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 8, 2005). As stated, the named Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that they are 
direct purchasers. The Court will address the class definition at the class certification stage."
1664,8," ""Federal courts have struggled for decades to determine when United States courts have jurisdiction over allegations of foreign 
restraints of trade."" United States v. LSL Biotechnologies, 379 F.3d 672, 677 (9th Cir. 2004). ""In an effort to provide a single 
standard to determine whether American antitrust laws apply to a given extraterritorial transaction, Congress enacted the 
[FTAIA] in 1982."" O.N.E. Shipping Ltd. v. Flota Mercante Grancolombiana, S.A., 830 F.2d 449, 451 (2d Cir. 1987); see also 
LSL Biotechnologies, 379 F.3d at 679 (""[T]he FTAIA provides the guiding standard for jurisdiction over foreign restraints of 
trade.""). "
1665,9," This decision is subject to change following discovery. See Emrich v. Touche Ross & Co., 846 F.2d 1190, 1194 n.2 (9th Cir. 
1988) (""It is elementary that the subject matter jurisdiction of the district court is not a waivable matter and may be raised at 
anytime by one of the parties, by motion or in the responsive pleadings, or sua sponte by the trial or reviewing court."")."
1665,10," This approach is consistent with the Supreme Court's approach in Empagran. There, the alleged conduct was ""a price-fixing 
conspiracy, raising the price of vitamin products to customers in the United States and to customers in foreign countries."" 542 
U.S. at 158. The Court did not split the conduct for purposes of the FTAIA inquiry. See id. at 164 (""The price-fixing conduct 
significantly and adversely affects both customers outside the United States and customers within the United States . . . .""). 
However, the Court did split the plaintiffs' Sherman Act claim based on domestic versus foreign purchasers. Id. at 159. (""We 
conclude that, in this scenario, a purchaser in the United States could bring a Sherman Act claim under the FTAIA based on 
domestic injury, but a purchaser in Ecuador could not bring a Sherman Act claim based on foreign harm.""). Here, Defendants do 
not dispute that claims based on travel originating in the U.S. are cognizable; thus, while the conduct is defined in a manner that 
encompasses the claims of both U.S. and Korean purchasers, the Court only considers whether it has subject  [*15] matter 
jurisdiction over the foreign claims. "
1666,11," Plaintiffs do not contest this point. Indeed, their argument regarding the applicability of the FTAIA assumes as much: Plaintiffs appear to concede that their antitrust claims implicate foreign trade or commerce by arguing that the FTAIA does 
not apply because the alleged conduct constitutes ""import trade or import commerce."" Such argument necessarily assumes 
that the conduct involves trade or commerce with foreign nations. CSR Ltd. v. CIGNA Corp., 405 F. Supp. 2d 526, 539 (D.N.J. 2005)."
1666,12," Defendants argue that their conduct does not involve import trade or commerce ""because the 'object of the conspiracy' is 
directed to [Korea] and the alleged injury (if any) would be felt abroad.""  [*17] (Asiana Mot. 9 (quoting Kruman v. Christie's Int'l, 
PLC, 284 F.3d 384, 395-96 (2d Cir. 2002), abrogated on other grounds by Empagram, 542 U.S. 155, 124 S. Ct. 2359, 159 L. Ed. 
2d 226).) In other words, Defendants contend the Court need not even inquire as to whether the provision of passenger air 
service between Korea and the U.S. constitutes import trade or commerce. (See Korean Air Mot. 9 (""Other activities of 
Defendants -- e.g., flying airplanes to and from the U.S. -- are irrelevant to the FTAIA analysis."").) This argument follows from 
Defendants' definition of the conduct at issue as the fixing of prices of airline tickets sold in Korea, which the Court rejected 
above. The three cases cited by Defendants in support of their argument -- Kruman, Turicentro, and CSR -- are thus readily 
distinguishable from the present case. In those cases, the service that was the object of the alleged conspiracies took place 
outside of domestic commerce, and to the extent that it took place in domestic commerce, it was a result of plaintiffs' conduct. As 
the court stated in Turicentro, ""[n]o items or services were brought into the United States by [the defendants' conduct] alone."" 
303 F.3d at 304; see also CSR, 405 F. Supp. 2d at 542  [*18] (""N]o services were brought into the United States by Defendants' 
issuance of coverage alone.""). That is not the situation here, where the relevant service is transport into the United States. By 
Defendants' conduct alone, purchasers of airline tickets were brought aboard airplanes into the United States. Whether such 
transit may properly be deemed import trade or commerce is thus the key question before the Court. As to this question, the 
Court, like Defendants, answers in the negative. "
1667,13," Plaintiffs also state that, ""[b]ecause Defendants' conduct involves a conspiracy to fix prices for a service (passenger air travel) 
brought into the U.S. from abroad, the FTAIA is inapplicable under the 'import commerce' provision . . . ."" (Opp'n 18.) Plaintiffs 
offer no authority to support this far from self-evident argument. Accordingly, it is without merit."
1667,14," According to Defendants, ""Plaintiffs have not alleged, and cannot allege, any effect that a ticket sale in Korea might have on 
U.S. domestic commerce . . . ."" (Asiana Mot. 9.) Again, this argument is premised on Defendants' already-rejected 
 [*21] definition of the conduct at issue."
1667,15," As already noted, it is uncontested that the effect of higher prices in the U.S. gives rise to a Sherman Act claim for Plaintiffs 
who purchased tickets for air travel originating in the U.S. "
1669,16," Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs lack antitrust standing because ""'the more  [*27] appropriate plaintiffs to bring suit against 
defendants are the consumers injured by defendants' actions in the United States.'"" (Korean Air Mot. 19 (quoting Galavan 
Supplements, Ltd. v. Archer Daniels Midland Co., No. C 97-3259, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18585, 1997 WL 732498, at *4 (N.D. 
Cal. Nov. 19, 1997)).) This argument depends on the assumption that the Korea-purchase Plaintiffs were not injured by 
Defendants' conduct in the U.S. The Court has elsewhere questioned this assumption. Accordingly, dismissal of the Korea-
purchase claims is not now appropriate. "
1671,17," Such travel would include: (a) travel from Korea to the U.S.; (b) travel from Korea through the U.S.; (c) travel from the U.S. 
through Korea; (d) travel to Korea that does not originate in the U.S. but that includes a U.S. to Korea segment; (e) travel to the 
U.S. that does not originate in Korea but that includes a Korea to U.S. segment; and (f) travel that does not originate or terminate 
in the U.S. or Korea but that includes a U.S.-Korea segment."
1671,18," Although the guilty plea appears limited to travel from the U.S. to Korea, such limitation is not fatal to Plaintiffs' claims, as it is 
not uncommon for civil allegations based on the same nucleus of facts underlying a defendant's guilty plea to be broader than 
said plea. See, e.g., In re Lupron Mktg. & Sales Practices Litig., 295 F. Supp. 2d 148, 159-60 (D. Mass. 2003). "
1672,19," See Chung v. Korean Air Lines Co., No. C 07 3985 (N.D. Cal., filed Aug. 2, 2007)."
1672,20," ""In alleging fraud or mistake, a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake."" Fed. R. Civ. 
P. 9(b). "
