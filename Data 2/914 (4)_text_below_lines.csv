27,*," Honorable Richard D. Cudahy, United States Circuit Judge for the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation. "
28,1," An accountant hired by Annulli prepared a report that supports Bellum's assertion that the Wrights wanted to appropriate 
Annulli's share of the profits. The accountant estimated that Annulli made roughly forty dollars on each tree he sold; under the 
terms of their contract, the Wrights made between $ 6.50 and $ 10 a tree."
28,2," Annulli, his wife, and Annulli Nurseries were named as plaintiffs in the cases relevant to this appeal. As Mr. Annulli is the 
principal plaintiff, we refer to him alone. "
29,3," The District Court disposed of all of Annulli's civil RICO claims on summary judgment. HN2[
] We exercise plenary review 
over such a decision, see Olson v. General Elec. Astrospace, 101 F.3d 947, 951 (3d Cir. 1996), and apply the same test the 
District Court should have applied in the first instance, see Lawrence v. National Westminster Bank, New Jersey, 98 F.3d 61, 65 
(3d Cir. 1996). We must therefore determine whether the record, when viewed in the light most favorable to Annulli, shows that 
there is no genuine issue of material fact and that defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Salley v. Circuit 
City Stores, Inc., 160 F.3d 977, 980 (3d Cir. 1998). "
30,4," Our last predicate act exception, created in Keystone, 863 F.2d at 1130, allowed actions based on injuries occurring outside the limitations period if injuries that are derived from the same pattern of 
racketeering are within the limitations period. Likewise, predicate acts which [were] committed within the limitations period 
should provide a basis for civil RICO actions to redress a RICO injury occurring prior to the limitations period . . . . The Supreme Court rejected this rule because it provided plaintiffs with little incentive to investigate their claims. It also let the 
plaintiffs sit on their rights indefinitely and use the new predicate acts ""as a bootstrap to recover for injuries caused by other 
earlier predicate acts that took place outside the limitations period."" Klehr, 521 U.S. at 190."
30,5," The Court in Klehr described Keystone's injury plus pattern discovery rule as a ""larger hole"" through which civil RICO plaintiffs 
would have to fit their cases and the pure injury discovery rule as a ""smaller one."" Klehr, 521 U.S. at 192. The third rule 
mentioned in Klehr creates a smaller hole still. Concurring, Justice Scalia noted that he would have adopted as the civil RICO 
accrual rule, the Clayton Act pure injury rule, which provides that a ""cause of action accrues and the statute begins to run when 
a defendant commits an act that injures a plaintiff's business."" See id. at 197-98. "
31,6," In an affidavit, signed April 21, 1997, Dominick Annulli swore that soon after the defendant Wrights terminated our contract and denied me access to the trees that I planted and maintained, I 
was contacted by one of my larger customers, Shemin Nurseries, Inc., located in Connecticut, and they advised me that the 
defendant, Evergreen Express, Inc., had faxed a new price list to Shemin's office offering cut trees as well as dug and 
balled nursery trees. . . . In the same time period, . . . [the Defendants] were attempting to steal my customers. George Bellum, who submitted an affidavit on Annulli's behalf, averred that the price list the Wrights sent to Annulli's customers 
was stolen from Annulli. "
33,7," See Brokerage Concepts, Inc. v. U.S. Healthcare, Inc., 140 F.3d 494 (3d Cir. 1998) (""Defendant's heavy-handed business 
tactics, . . . while relevant to a tortious interference claim, cannot be made to fit within the statutory and doctrinal constraints of 
the mail and wire fraud statutes.""); Blount Financial Services, Inc. v. Walter E. Heller and Co., 819 F.2d 151, 152-53 (6th Cir. 
1987) (holding that absent specific allegations of intentional fraud, ""sending a financial statement which misconstrues the prime 
rate provided by the terms of the contract may breach the contract but it does not amount to a RICO mail fraud cause of 
action."")."
33,8," See, e.g., United States v. Napoli, 54 F.3d 63, 68 (2d Cir. 1995) (finding that ""despite the broad range of criminal offenses 
designated by the money laundering statute, the crime of theft, standing alone, is not a specified unlawful activity. It is neither a 
federal crime listed in sections 1956 and 1961, nor one of the state-law offenses that constitute RICO predicate acts.""); Toms v. 
Pizzo, 4 F. Supp. 2d 178, 183 (W.D.N.Y. 1998) (noting that ""simple theft is not one of the crimes constituting a predicate act for 
purposes of establishing a pattern of racketeering activity""); Buck Creek Coal, Inc. v. United Mine Workers, 917 F. Supp. 601, 
612 (S.D. Ind. 1995) (""Theft is not the type of act that forms a predicate act under RICO.""); Bonton v. Archer Chrysler 
Plymouth, Inc., 889 F. Supp. 995, 1002 (S.D. Tex. 1995) (""Under HN14[
] RICO, . . . acts that constitute theft under state law 
are not predicate acts for racketeering activity. . . . A plaintiff may not convert state law claims into a federal treble damage 
action simply by alleging that wrongful acts are a pattern of racketeering related to an enterprise."") "
34,9," HN16[
] There are two elements of a mail or wire fraud charge: ""(a) a scheme to defraud, and (2) a mailing or wire in 
furtherance of that scheme."" Greenberg v. Brewster, 816 F. Supp. 1039, 1049 (E.D. Pa. 1993). Wholly intrastate use of the mails 
for fraud violates the mail fraud statute. See, e.g., In re Burzynski, 989 F.2d 733, 742 (5th Cir. 1993). In contrast, the federal wire 
fraud statute requires interstate use of the wire. See, e.g., Smith v. Ayres, 845 F.2d 1360, 1366 (5th Cir. 1988) (""As several 
courts have recognized, the statute requires that the wire communication cross state lines."")."
34,10," In his Reply Brief, Annulli asserts that such evidence can be found in his brief opposing summary judgment before the District 
Court. In those papers, Annulli claims that ""there were hundreds of calls to [him] from all over the country, outside the State of 
Pennsylvania requesting that he work faster and work harder for each of the Defendants."" Annulli cites his own January 6, 1998 
deposition at pages 89-91 to support this claim. On review, these pages contain no discussion regarding interstate phone calls 
made to Annulli by the Defendants. Instead, they include a discussion regarding the indemnity clause in Annulli's contract with 
the Wrights. Annulli further asserted in his summary judgment opposition brief that ""the Wrights operated their business schemes from Lake 
Placid, Florida during the winter months."" From this, he would presumably have us draw the inference that the Wrights called 
Annulli and furthered their scheme to defraud him over interstate phone lines. To support the contention giving rise to this 
inference, Annulli cites Exhibits 41 and 42 from the trial record and Joanne Wright's February 22, 1998 deposition in its entirety. 
This evidence similarly fails to establish an issue of material fact regarding Annulli's mail and wire fraud allegations. Exhibit 41 is 
a phone bill of an unidentified person or company dated April 10, 1990, on which a March 20, 1990 phone call is logged to Lake 
Placid, Florida. Exhibit 42 is a canceled check written on March 11, 1989 from Evergreen to United Telephone. Neither of these 
documents even begins to prove that Wrights used interstate wire in furtherance of a conspiracy to defraud Annulli, absent some 
explanation in the record as to why this telephone bill and canceled check have anything to do with the Defendants' alleged "
35,," racketeering activity. Cf.  Scheiner v. Wallace, 860 F. Supp. 991, 997-98 (S.D.N.Y. 1994) (noting that, HN17[
] when alleging 
mail and wire fraud as predicate acts in a RICO claim, plaintiff's pleadings must identify the purpose of the mailing within the 
defendant's fraudulent scheme and specify the fraudulent statement, the time, place, and speaker and content of the alleged 
misrepresentations). Even if Annulli did offer such explanations, the predicate acts of racketeering they would tend to prove are 
well outside the statutory period. As for Joanne Wright's 220 page deposition, it too provides Annulli with no assistance. It makes 
not one mention of the Wrights operating their tree business from Florida during the winter months; instead, it primarily contains 
extensive discussions regarding the Wrights' unprofitable tree business before they hired Annulli."
35,11," Annulli bemoans the fact that the Defendants""repeatedly refused to turn over their telephone records as requested by him 
during discovery."" With these telephone records, Annulli suggests, he could have proven that some of the allegedly 
conspiratorial telephone conversations were conducted interstate. This is the wrong time to raise such an objection. HN18[
] FED. R. CIV. P. 56(f) affords a party opposing summary judgment, who has not had the time or means to discover facts 
necessary to defeat the motion, the ability to ask the court to grant a continuance or deny the motion altogether. The rule 
""specifies the procedure to be followed, and explicitly provides that the party must file an affidavit setting forth why the time is 
needed."" Pastore v. Bell Telephone Co. of Pa., 24 F.3d 508, 510-11 (3d Cir. 1994). Annulli has filed no such affidavit. His failure 
to do so ""is usually fatal,"" HN19[
] because by not filing a Rule 56(f) affidavit, a plaintiff fails to preserve his objection.  Id. at"
35,511," . Pastore mentioned a possible exception to the affidavit requirement in cases in which the non-moving party ""constructively"" 
made a Rule 56(f) motion in his papers opposing summary judgment. Id. Annulli made no mention of a discovery insufficiency in 
his papers; in fact, he claimed that ""clear evidence"" established the existence of criminal acts of mail and wire fraud. This clear 
evidence of course proved illusory, see supra note 10, and Annulli's eagerness to rest on it effectively waived any Rule 56(f) 
claim."
35,12," See, e.g., Doddy v. Oxy USA, Inc., 101 F.3d 448, 455-56 (5th Cir. 1996) (holding that district court did not abuse its discretion 
in declining to remand pendent claims, where lawsuit had been in litigation for more than two years, trial date was less than one 
month away, parties had filed more than 300 pleadings, most parties had prepared extensive discovery disclosures, summary "
36,," judgment motions were pending, and remaining causes of action did not raise any novel or unsettled issues of state law); Timm 
v. Mead Corp., 32 F.3d 273, 276-77 (7th Cir. 1994) (accord, on similar facts)."
36,13," In Kennedy v. Schoenberg, Fisher & Newman, Ltd., 140 F.3d 716, 728 (7th Cir. 1998), for example, the court of appeals held 
that it would not ""second-guess"" the district court's discretionary decision to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over 
plaintiff's state law claims after plaintiff's federal claims were dismissed, even though the district judge was familiar with both the 
facts and law of the case and the parties had undertaken discovery. The court described the district court's decision as "" 'almost 
unreviewable,' especially when all federal claims have been dropped from the case before trial and only state law claims 
remain."" Id. (citation omitted). Similarly, in Pitchell v. Callan, 13 F.3d 545, 549 (2d Cir. 1994), the court of appeals upheld the 
district court's decision, made shortly before trial, to dismiss plaintiff's pendent claims after it had disposed of plaintiff's federal 
claims. The court explained this result, writing that it was ""not persuaded by [plaintiff's] argument that he is being prejudiced by 
the delay resulting from the necessary pursuit of his state-law claims in state court. . . . When [plaintiff] brought his state-law 
claims in federal court, he must have realized that the jurisdiction he invoked was pendent and possibly tentative."" Id. (citation 
omitted)."
36,14," attempt to avoid this result, Annulli cites our decision in Growth Horizons, Inc. v. Delaware County, 983 F.2d 1277 (3d Cir. 
1993). Annulli's reliance on that case is misplaced. In Growth Horizons, the district court had already held a trial on the merits 
and heard all of the evidence necessary to reach a decision on plaintiff's state law claim. See id. at 1285. Before rendering 
judgment on this claim, the district court mistakenly dismissed it along with the underlying federal claim for want of subject matter 
jurisdiction. See id. at 1284. We reversed this decision, held that plaintiff's federal law claims were without merit, and instructed 
the district court to exercise its discretion under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c) to determine whether judicial economy, convenience, and 
fairness to the parties dictated that the district court decide plaintiff's surviving pendent claims. See id. In passing, we suggested 
that "" 'if the dismissal of the main claim occurs late in the action, . . . knocking[the dependant claims] down with a belated 
rejection of supplemental jurisdiction may not be fair.' "" Id. at 1285 (citation omitted). We did not say that on the facts presented, 
however, the district court must hear the pendent claims given these fairness concerns. In Annulli's case, a trial has not been 
had, and the District Court cannot render judgment on Annulli's state law claims without further litigation. Moreover, the Court 
has already exercised its judgment and decided that a trial on the state claims is not warranted. "
45,1," In its original complaint, Bristol sued to protect three patents, including one owned by the United States Department of Health 
and Human Services and licensed exclusively to Bristol. This U.S. Patent No.  5,496,804 (""the '804 patent""), known as the Reed 
patent, was later withdrawn from this case by agreement of the parties. "
49,2," In their brief in opposition to this motion, the counterclaimants assert that Bristol misrepresented or fraudulently omitted 
information during its contacts with the NIH and the FDA. Opp. Br. at 20-21. The counterclaims make no reference to such fraud, 
describing only meetings between Bristol and FDA officials. Countercl. P 91. HN11[
] The counterclaimants may not so amend 
their pleadings through their brief.  Town of Secaucus v. United States Dep't of Transp., 889 F. Supp. 779, 791 (D.N.J. 1995). "
52,3," The counterclaimants did not attach transcripts of the congressional hearings for verification. In contrast, Bristol submitted the 
transcript of a 1993 congressional subcommittee hearing entitled ""Pricing of Drugs Codeveloped by Federal Laboratories and 
Private Companies,"" 103d Cong. 138-39 (1993). Though the parties dispute the exact phrasing of this last statement, the court 
quotes verbatim from this transcript. ""A HN23[
] 'document integral to or explicitly relied on in the complaint' may be considered 
'without converting the motion [to dismiss] into one for summary judgment.'"" In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 
1410, 1426 (3rd Cir. 1997) (citation omitted). "
102,1," Both plaintiff and defendants filed objections to the post-hearing proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law submitted by 
the opposing parties in connection with the present motion. To the extent that these objections concern matters addressed at the 
hearing conducted on October 22, 1999, the Court relies on its earlier rulings. To the extent defendants object to evidence in 
plaintiff's post-hearing proposed findings of fact not included in plaintiff's original proposed findings of fact, the Court finds that 
such evidence was appropriately included in plaintiff's post-hearing papers. With regard to plaintiff's hearsay objections, the 
Court sustains to the extent the subject evidence is not derived from business records."
102,2," The services offered by hospitals are often grouped into three general categories. Primary services include basic hospital 
services such as obstetrics, general medicine, and general surgery involved in relatively simple procedures. Secondary services "
103,," are more complex and require more specialized equipment and personnel. Tertiary services involve the most complex and 
highly specialized services such as heart bypass surgery and transplants. "
105,3," Summit's fiscal year ends on February 28 or 29. Thus, fiscal year 1996 encompasses March 1, 1995 through February 28, 
1996. "
111,4," For example, if all 100 patients that resided in a particular zip code went to Summit or Alta Bates for acute inpatient services, 
that zip code would be included in Dr. Langenfeld's service area first because Summit and Alta Bates would have 100% of the 
market share of that zip code. If, on the other hand, 100 patients sought acute inpatient services at Summit and Alta Bates from 
a zip code that contained 200 patients, that zip code would be placed considerably further down in Dr. Langenfeld's ranking 
because Summit and Alta Bates would only have 50% of the market share of that zip code."
111,5," Using the example outlined above, if two zip codes each contained 100 patients who sought acute inpatient services from 
Summit and Alta Bates, both of those zip codes would be included in Guerin-Calvert's service area in the same order of 
preference regardless of the number of patients residing in those zip codes that sought acute inpatient services elsewhere. 
Similarly, if Summit and Alta Bates drew 100 patients from one zip code and 50 patients from another, the former would be 
ranked higher than the latter, irrespective of the total patient population of the respective zip codes. "
117,6," Defendants' expert calculated a critical loss figure based on an assumed SNIP imposed by the merged Alta Bates/Summit 
entity as opposed to a hypothetical monopolist. (Def.'s Ex. 1001, Guerin-Calvert Report P 63-64.) Defendants' critical loss 
analysis, although potentially relevant on the issue of anticompetitive effects once a geographic market has been defined, is not 
relevant in analyzing the scope of a proposed geographic market in the first instance. HN24[
]"
117,7," The disparity between these figures stems from the fact that Dr. Langenfeld calculated multiple critical loss figures using 
different sets of data and assuming different contribution margins for: (1) only managed care patients and (2) all patients. 
(PX1082, Langenfeld Report, Ex. 37.) "
119,8," It should be noted that plan administrators do not uniformly oppose the proposed merger. For example, the president and CEO 
of Foundation Health Systems, the parent company of Health Net, the second largest health plan in the East Bay, has testified 
that he believes the possibility of a price increase due to the proposed merger is slight based on, inter alia, the ability of MCOs to 
steer patients to lower cost facilities if faced with increased prices. (Def.'s Ex. 1012, Decl. Gellert at 14-17) "
133,1," I do not agree with the majority's statement that ""there are no material facts in dispute concerning Dr. Krivchenia's alleged 
conspiracy with the Hospital in respect to the antitrust claim,"" nor do I agree with the majority's suggestion that ""Dr. Krivchenia, a 
board certified orthopedic surgeon, may not have been a competitor of Dr. Alba."" In fact, I believe that there is evidence in the 
record that indicates that Dr. Krivchenia and Dr. Alba were in direct competition with one another, see, e.g., Joint Appendix 
(""J.A."") at 352 (Alba Aff.); J.A. at 631-32 (Labarre Dep.); J.A. at 653 (Matyas Dep.), which could lead a rational jury to conclude 
that Dr. Krivchenia was motived by anticompetitive considerations when he helped persuade the various peer review committees 
to suspend Dr. Alba's surgical privileges. "
140,1," During the events giving rise to this lawsuit BSC was known as Brooklyn Salvage Corporation. For the sake of clarity, the 
parties have used ""Baltimore Scrap"" to refer to both the present corporation and its predecessor, a practice the Court will adopt."
140,2," There are two sets of defendants in this case, all of whom are past or present owners of the existing shredder. The relationship 
among the various defendants and their involvement with this case are explained later in this Memorandum."
140,3, The defendants anticipated that part of the appeal would raise environmental issues. 
143,4," The Shapiro defendants are: I.D. Shapiro; James Shapiro; Charles Baum; United Holdings Co., Inc. (a successor to United Iron 
& Metal); United Operating Co., Inc.; and United Investment Enterprises Partnership. The plaintiff's complaint focuses on the 
actions on I.D. Shapiro. Based upon papers presented to the Court, James Shapiro and Charles Baum played minor roles in the 
events giving rise to this lawsuit. Because judgment is being entered in favor of all the Shapiro defendants, the Court has not 
been called upon to determine whether James Shapiro and Charles Baum are more than nominal defendants."
143,5," The amended complaint named as additional defendants the David J. Joseph Co. (""DJJ"") and the manager of its Baltimore 
facility, David J. Workum, III. "
144,6, Warren Rich was an attorney representing DJJ. At the time he was affiliated with the firm of Graham and James.
144,7," Neuberger's law firm, Neuberger, Quinn, Gielen, Rubin & Gibber, P.A., is called ""The Neuberger Firm"" by parties, and will be so 
called by the Court."
144,8, DJJ officials were aware of Shapiro's efforts. See Plaintiff's Exh. 21.
144,9," BSC contends the conclusions reached in the Henderson report are false. BSC claims the defendants underestimated the 
amount of scrap available in the Baltimore area by assuming that No. 2 steel, including white goods, automobile bumpers, and 
portions of automobile fenders, cannot be shredded. See Aff. of David M. Simon, Plaintiff's Exh. 3. The defendants, on the other 
hand, assert they used standard industry assumptions in making their estimates. This dispute is not material, because there is 
no evidence that the zoning authorities gave any consideration to the Henderson report. See Part III.B.3.c, infra. "
145,10," One of the five BMZA members was absent, meaning that a unanimous vote in favor of Baltimore Scrap would have been 
required."
145,11," As in 1991, the decision of the zoning administrator was automatically transmitted to the BMZA for review."
145,12," As stated in Part II.E infra, the Board did not intend to classify the shredder as a MIRF. As explained in the Gadhia affidavit, 
the Board's decision mistakenly quoted provisions of the zoning code relating to a MIRF."
145,13," I.D. Shapiro owned a ""substantial interest"" in Marlen Trading. See DJJ Mem. Supp. Summ. J. at 18. "
146,14," Unfortunately, there is no transcript of the December 7 hearing because of a mechanical problem with the court reporter's 
recorder."
146,15," On appeal to the Circuit Court, a zoning board's decision must be upheld if supported by substantial evidence. See, e.g., 
Aaron v. City of Baltimore, 207 Md. 401, 406, 114 A.2d 639 (1955). "
147,16," The plaintiff argues that the defendants concealed their identity, in part, because had the citizens groups known a competing 
shredder company, with environmental problems of its own, was funding the appeal they would not have accepted the 
assistance. See, e.g., Dep. of Gloria Sipes at 142, 213. During discovery in the instant case, Ms. Sipes and others were 
questioned as to what their reaction would have been had they known of the Shapiro defendants' role. The citizens' reactions 
were mixed. All said they would have been upset. Some testified that they would probably have accepted the money. Others 
testified that in retrospect they would have rejected the funding, even though without Marlen's financial support, the appeal 
would not have been possible. See infra Part III.B.3.a."
147,17," Defendants point out that I.D. Shapiro's interest in Marlen Trading is on file with the Maryland Department of Assessments and 
Taxation and is therefore a matter of public record. While Defendants are correct, a technical corporate filing hardly amounts to 
disclosure to a citizen group."
147,18," The true identity or affiliation of ""William Thomas"" remains unknown."
147,19," On or about January 18, 1993, Baltimore Scrap filed Motions for a New Trial, to Alter or Amend Judgment, and to Revise 
Judgment. See DJJ Exh. C20."
147,20," A material recovery facility (MIRF) is not authorized to accept certain varieties of ferrous metals which BSC was to process. It 
must also be completely enclosed. The citizens groups argued that by approving the BSC shredder as a MIRF, the Board had 
applied an incorrect statutory standard. By explaining the references to a MIRF as a mistake, the Gadhia affidavit made the 
Board's decision internally consistent."
147,21," Although the parties disagreed over the meaning of the term ""structural alteration to a junk yard conditional use,"" Chief Judge 
Hammerman stated that the affidavit proved the ""Board was approving the application for the uses requested."" DJJ Exh. C27 at 
27. "
148,22," This transaction has come to be known in the litigation as the ""errant fax."" "
149,23," During the summer of 1993, Irwin and I.D. Shapiro communicated directly about Irwin's legal fees for the appeal. See Plaintiff's 
Exh. 31. It is unclear from the record whether the Marlen Trading reimbursement scheme continued during this period. "
150,24," Thus, ""if the evidence is merely colorable or not significantly probative, it may not be adequate to oppose entry of summary 
judgment. . . . While we have recognized generally that when considering a motion for summary judgment, the district court must 
draw any permissible inference from the underlying facts in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion, we hasten 
to add that those inferences must, in every case, fall within the range of reasonable probability and not be so tenuous as to 
amount to speculation or conjecture."" Thompson Everett, 57 F.3d at 1323 (citations omitted) (emphasis added)."
150,25," The doctrine was first developed by the Supreme Court in the legislative and executive context in Eastern Railroad Presidents 
Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961) and Mine Workers v. Pennington, 
381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965). "
151,26," Although no transcript of the December 7, 1992 hearing before Judge Ward exists, the plaintiff has not raised any objection to 
the conduct of the hearing. "
152,27," The Fifth Circuit has noted: HN7[
] ""To the extent the litigant has a reasonable basis for believing that his claim of standing 
might be accepted by the court, and thus that he will have the right to participate in the litigation process and obtain relief, he will 
be protected by Noerr-Pennington even though he ultimately loses."" In re Burlington Northern, Inc., 822 F.2d 518, 530 (5th Cir. 
1987). The Burlington court went on to observe that only a party advocating a patently frivolous standing argument would lose 
Noerr-Pennington protection."
152,28," Analyzing this argument requires a brief review of the procedural history of the case. As discussed in Section II, supra, the 
BMZA rejected BSC's application on environmental grounds in November 1991. After modifying its application by proposing to 
add an oil/water separator and to pave the site with concrete, BSC reapplied the following year. The BMZA approved this 
second application on August 6, 1992. HN8[
] Under Maryland law, a court reviews a zoning board's decision to determine if the decision was supported by 
""substantial evidence."" See, e.g., Aaron v. City of Baltimore, 207 Md. 401, 406, 114 A.2d 639 (1955). In their appeal, the citizens 
did not attack the merits of the BMZA's environmental findings. They instead objected to alleged defects both in BSC's second 
application (i.e. that the second application was not significantly different from the first) and in the BMZA's approval of BSC's 
second application (i.e. that BSC's shredder was improperly classified as a MIRF)."
152,29," Because Chief Judge Hammerman found that the Board's determination that BSC's second application was substantially 
different than the first was supported by substantial evidence, that issue was not subject to review on remand."
152,30," As explained in Part II.D, supra, once an application is rejected by the BMZA, the applicant must normally wait one year before 
reapplying, unless the second application is ""substantially"" different from the first. "
153,31," If BSC's contention were accepted, any litigant raising procedural arguments on appeal, even if the appeal were successful in 
forcing a remand, would face a claim that the appeal was taken in bad faith if it appeared likely that the procedural defect would 
be cured after remand. "
154,32," The Court wrote: In surveying the ""forms of illegal and reprehensible practice which may corrupt the administrative or judicial processes and 
which may result in antitrust violations,"" we have noted that ""unethical conduct in the setting of the adjudicatory process 
often results in sanctions"" and that ""misrepresentations condoned in the political arena are not immunized when used in the 
adjudicatory process."" We need not decide here whether, and, if so, to what extent Noerr permits the imposition of antitrust 
liability for a litigant's fraud or other misrepresentations. Cf. Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(3)…; Walker Process, 382 U.S. at 179-80 
(Harlan, J., concurring). PRE, 508 U.S. at 61-62 n.6 (some citations omitted). Defendants suggest that footnote 6 could be interpreted to cast doubt on the survival of the fraud exception after PRE. While 
such an interpretation is plausible, it has not been adopted by any of the courts of appeal applying PRE and will not be adopted 
here."

154,34," The plaintiff acknowledges that the citizens groups were honestly opposed to the Baltimore Scrap shredder on environmental 
grounds. Pl. Mem. Opp. Sum. J. at 62 n.19."
154,35," It is unclear when Irwin became aware of United's role in funding the zoning appeal. In his deposition, he testified that Isaac 
Neuberger and Sam Wood told him in August 1992 that he would be compensated if he represented the citizens in the zoning 
appeal. Irwin stated he was under the impression that businesses would pay him, but he was ""not especially"" interested in 
knowing the identity of the businesses. Dep. of David Irwin at 27. "
155,36," The plaintiff argues that, based on statements made in her deposition, Gloria Sipes, the individual plaintiff in the zoning 
appeal, would have declined to participate in the litigation had she known the true source of funds. Ms. Sipes did not state 
explicitly that she would have declined. Moreover, had Sipes demurred, the defendants could have found another lead plaintiff 
such as Mary Rosso or Doris McGuigan. For example, Ms. Rosso, leader of the Maryland Waste Coalition, testified at deposition 
that although she was ""not happy"" to find out United was behind the funding, she ""really didn't give a darn."" Dep. of Mary Rosso 
at 60."
155,37, Had the defendants' involvement remained concealed throughout the litigation the analysis might be different.
155,38," In support of its contention, BSC cites evidence presented at the BMZA hearing supporting the environmental soundness of 
the proposed shredder. It also points out that the defendants themselves intended to replace their own shredder with one with 
environmental safeguards similar to those of the BSC shredder. See Pl. Mem. Opp. Sum. J. at 49-54. "
156,39," The parties dispute the accuracy of the report. For summary judgment purposes, the Court will accept Baltimore Scrap's 
contention that DJJ's methodolgy was flawed. Even so, the plaintiff cannot prove fraud; rather, it only can establish that the 
report was inaccurate. There is no evidence that the DJJ report contained deliberately false information."

173,5," The Tenth Circuit has addressed this question in the context of a private class action in which college coaches alleged that the 
NCAA and its members had conspired to fix the coaches' salaries at non-competitively low rates: The NCAA argues that the district court erred by failing to define the relevant market and by failing to find that the NCAA 
possesses market power in that market. The NCAA urges that the relevant market in this case is the entire market for 
men's basketball coaching services, . . . and it presented evidence demonstrating that positions as restricted-earnings 
basketball coaches make up, at most, 8% of the market. . . . . The NCAA misapprehends the purpose of market definition, which is not an end unto itself but rather exists to illuminate a 
practice's effect on competition . . . Where_a practice had obvious anticompetitive effects - as does price-fixing - there is no

207,1," We have explained this doctrine as follows: HN1[
] The Noerr-Pennington doctrine ""allows individuals or businesses to petition the government, free of the threat of antitrust liability, for action that may have anti-competitive consequences. Noerr-Pennington protection is grounded on the 
theory that the right to petition guaranteed by the First Amendment extends to petitions for selfish, even anticompetitive 
ends."" Greenwood Utilities Comm'n v. Mississippi Power Co., 751 F.2d 1484, 1497 (5th Cir. 1985). The doctrine was 
announced in Eastern R.R. Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 
464 (1961), where the Supreme Court held that the Sherman Anti-Trust Act did not bar an association of railroad 
companies from seeking legislation and regulations destructive of the trucking industry. The Court has expanded this 
holding to encompass the petitioning of other public officials besides legislators. See United Mine Workers of America v. 
Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965); Real Estate Investors v. Columbia Pictures, 508 U.S. 
49, 113 S. Ct. 1920, 123 L. Ed. 2d 611 (1993). Brown & Root, Inc. v. Louisiana State AFL-CIO, 10 F.3d 316, 325 (5th Cir. 1994). "
209,2," The Court further stressed that ""to wipe out the adjudication post-judgment, and return to state court a case now satisfying all 
federal jurisdictional requirements, would impose an exorbitant cost on our dual court system, a cost incompatible with the fair 
and unprotracted administration of justice."" 519 U.S. at 77. Here, that concern arguably is not implicated. A diversity case differs 
fundamentally from a federal question case. With a diversity case, a federal court applies state law exactly as would a state 
court. See, e.g., Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 82 L. Ed. 1188, 58 S. Ct. 817 (1938). There is no difference in the 
treatment of the substance of plaintiff's claims; the change is largely procedural if at all. "
210,3," WCS also objects that its amendment was not voluntary, citing Humphrey v. Sequentia, Inc., 58 F.3d 1238 (8th Cir. 1995), a 
case in which the district court had found the plaintiff's state law claim to be preempted. ""Thus, the district court presented [the 
plaintiff] with a Hobson's choice. Under the circumstances, his options were to amend his complaint to allege the federal LMRA 
claims or risk dismissal of the complaint and, consequently, preclusion of his federal claims under the doctrine of res judicata."" 
Id. at 1241. We note that a similar Hobson's choice argument has not been uniformly accepted. In Bernstein v. Lind-Waldock 
Co., 738 F.2d 179, 185 (7th Cir. 1984), Judge Posner persuasively wrote: After Bernstein's motion to remand was denied, he threw in the towel, as it were, and filed an amended complaint in federal 
court that included an unmistakable federal cause of action against the Exchange. The amended complaint was thus within 
the original jurisdiction of the federal district courts and it makes no difference that it was filed only because Bernstein's 
previous suit had improperly been removed. If he was convinced that the original action was not removable he could have 
stuck by his guns and we would have vindicated his position on appeal. But once he decided to take advantage of his 
involuntary presence in federal court to add a federal claim to his complaint he was bound to remain there. Otherwise he 
would be in a position where if he won his case on the merits in federal court he could claim to have raised the federal 
question in his amended complaint voluntarily, and if lost he could claim to have raised it involuntarily and to be entitled to 
start over in state court. He 'cannot be permitted to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal court, and then disclaim it when he 
loses.' (Citing Brough v. United Steelworkers of America, 437 F.2d 748, 750 (1st Cir. 1971)). In Sigmon, supra, 110 F.3d at 1202-03, we 
cited this language favorably but without discussion. Bernstein, though not Sigmon, precedes Caterpillar's apparent approval of 
the plaintiff's effort to do ""all that was required to preserve his objection to removal."" 519 U.S. at 74. As we have noted, 
Caterpillar preserves for appeal objection to jurisdiction if timely objected to in the first place, and in the absence of other 
equitable issues. More important, despite its obvious attraction, Judge Posner's language must admit some exception. If it were 
the firm and fast rule, an amendment of one's complaint after improper removal would always constitute waiver of the 
jurisdictional argument despite the prerequisite for a judgment on the merits. "
211,4," Caterpillar's finding of finality, efficiency, and economy considerations was made by analogy to Newman-Green, Inc. v. Alfonzo-
Larrain, 490 U.S. 826, 104 L. Ed. 2d 893, 109 S. Ct. 2218 (1989), a diversity case in which the Court stated that ""requiring 
dismissal after years of litigation would impose unnecessary and wasteful burdens on the parties, judges, and other litigants 
waiting for judicial attention."" Id. at 836. An apparently expedited Rule 12(b)(6) decision hardly is of the same magnitude to either 
case."
211,5," We also find merit in WCS's position of the narrowness of its amendment. The company filed an amended complaint to state 
the one and only claim the district court suggested it had, and a claim that was consistent with its state court pleading. In 
comparison, in Kidd, the plaintiff brought a breach of her employment contract claim in state court. Upon removal to federal court 
and denial of her motion to remand, plaintiff ""amended her complaint to assert breaches of Southwest's employee stock 
ownership plan and employee profit-sharing plan"" under ERISA. 891 F.2d at 542. Thus, the plaintiff added an entirely new cause 
of action. Such an action speaks to a studied decision to take advantage of the forum once there. "

245,4," According to section 3.3 of the TLDA, Microsoft must deliver to Sun the source code corresponding to the Compatible 
Implementation. "
246,5," Microsoft's extensions to the java.* class libraries generated Signature Test failures when Sun's test suites were applied to 
Microsoft's implementation. Indeed, Microsoft appears to admit that Internet Explorer 4.0 and SDKJ 2.0 for Win32 operating 
systems, distributed between September 1997 and May 1998, failed to pass Sun's SignatureTest in the JCK 1.1a test suite. Day 
1/27/99 Decl. Ex. 3 (Microsoft's Response to RFA No. 59); Schroer 1/22/99 Decl. Ex. C. Microsoft also admits that Internet

that Microsoft's current implementations generate SignatureTest failures."

248,9," Microsoft complains that it is unfair to assess the balance of hardships based on the circumstances resulting from its 
compliance with the now-vacated November 17, 1998 Preliminary Injunction Order. However, as Microsoft concedes, the court 
must look to the present in assessing the propriety of a requested injunction. Opposition at 8. Additionally, Microsoft cannot 
persuasively argue that it is unfair to measure the balance of hardships according to circumstances resulting from Sun's efforts 
to enforce the TLDA's compatibility obligations. Moreover, the harm to Microsoft, even when the current state of Microsoft's 
relevant software products is ignored, fails to outweigh the competitive and other harms advanced by Sun. "
250,10," Sun has demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of success in establishing that the TLDA requires Microsoft to include JNI in its 
implementations of the Java Virtual Machine. See Sun, 21 F. Supp. 2d at 1119-22; Sun, 188 F.3d at 1120 (holding that 
substantial evidence demonstrates that Microsoft violated the TLDA)."
250,11," The exclusion of JNI does not benefit software developers or consumers, since Microsoft's development tools eliminate the 
option to write a hybrid Java/native application for Sun's standard Java runtime environment. "
251,12," Part of the safeguards Sun seeks to include is a warning to developers that Microsoft may be prohibited by court order from 
including or supporting its extended language technology. However, requiring such a warning in response to Sun's current 
motions would be appropriate only if the development and distribution of such language extensions alone constitute ""unfair"" 
business practices or copyright infringement. "
252,13," Microsoft's currently distributed versions of the Java Technology may in fact promote Sun's standard programming 
environment. See Hausman 9/24/99 Decl. P 19."
252,14," Cel-Tech does not apply to this aspect of Sun's claim since it involves alleged false advertising. See Cel-Tech, 20 Cal. 4th at 
187 n. 12."
252,15," As discussed in the November 17, 1998 Preliminary Injunction Order, Sun has already established a reasonable likelihood of 
success as to its claim that Microsoft's designation of its implementation of the Java Technology as the ""Official Reference 
Implementation of Java on Windows 32-bit platforms"" is false and misleading. See Sun, 21 F. Supp. 2d at 1127. "
253,16," Microsoft also attempts to justify its statements concerning its @com compiler directive, reasoning that whether it complies 
with Sun's specifications ""is of course the subject of technical debate."" Opposition at 17. However, Microsoft's statements do not 
reasonably appear to be assertions made in the context of a ""technical"" debate. Rather, they create the false impression that, 
inter alia, Sun approves Microsoft's implementation and use of the @com compiler directive."
253,17," According to Sun, the non-compliant virtual machine in previous versions of Internet Explorer 4.0 failed to support JNI, Sun's 
native method interface. See Schroer 9/3/99 Decl. PP 4, 5, 6. "
254,18," According to Sun, a licensee's modification of the public Java APIs significantly impairs Java's goal of cross-platform 
compatibility. See Day 2/26/99 Reply Decl. i/s/o Motions for Summary Judgment Ex. 11 (Hankinson 11/17/97 Decl. PP 21-23); 
see also Ex. 33 (Deutsch 11/17/97 Decl. P 19)."
254,19," Moreover, Microsoft's failure to adequately warn developers may not have been inadvertent. See Day 9/3/99 Decl. Ex. 19 (""at 
this point its [sic] not good to create MORE noise around our win32 java classes, instead we should just quietly grow VJ++ share 
and assume that people will take more advantage of our classes without ever realizing they are building win32-only java apps."") 
(emphasis in original). "
255,20," Specifically, the author of the white paper states that he ""intends"" to remove the passages to which Sun objects. See 
Verbowski 9/24/99 Decl. P 11. In addition, counsel for Microsoft represented at the hearing that Microsoft has removed from its 
white papers the statements to which Sun objects. See Transcript of October 15, 1999 Hearing at 53:1-12, 84:4-9. "
260,1," From this point forward in this Order, ""Defendants"" refers to the three remaining defendants: Saudi, Shell, and Texaco. "
263,2," One case cited by Plaintiffs, Citizen Publ'g Co. v. United States, 394 U.S. 131, 133, 22 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1969), involved price 
fixing and other restraints that were found not to be necessary to the underlying joint venture. In Citizen, the only two daily 
newspapers in Tucson, Arizona combined their advertising, production, and distribution operations into a new, separate entity, 
while leaving their news operations separate. The Supreme Court affirmed the district court's conclusion that the papers' joint 
fixing of advertising prices constituted a per se violation of Section 1. Id. at 135-36. Although the Citizen Court did not phrase its analysis in terms of naked and ancillary restraints, it essentially found that the price-
fixing agreement was not ancillary to the papers' joint venture. The papers could have combined their business operations 
without engaging in collective pricing. See Gregory J. Werden, Antitrust Analysis of Joint Ventures: An Overview, 66 Antitrust 
L.J. 701, 708 & n.26 (1998) (discussing Citizen). The remedy affirmed by the Court was not to break up the papers' joint venture, 
but to eliminate the facets of the venture that constituted non-ancillary restraints on trade: price fixing, profit sharing, and market 
allocation. See 280 F. Supp. 978, 992-94 (D. Ariz. 1968) (finding that these restraints were not necessary to the joint venture, 
entering judgment that they were illegal per se under Section 1, and setting forth the remedy). "
264,3," It is also premature to consider the import of the consent decrees relating to the formation of Equilon and Motiva that were 
entered into by the Defendants with the federal and several state governments. Defendants ask that we take judicial notice of 
these decrees. Plaintiffs argue that while we might be able to take judicial notice of the fact that the decrees were entered, we 
cannot take notice of the content of the decrees. We need not decide what sort of judicial notice might be appropriate, however. At this early stage of the litigation, before any 
other evidence has been produced, we cannot determine how much weight to give to the consent decrees in deciding whether to 
apply the per se rule. While a consent judgment can be ""a unique indicator that the challenged practice may have redeeming 
competitive virtues,"" it ""does not immunize the defendant from liability for actions, including those contemplated by the decree, 
that violate the rights of non-parties."" BMI v. CBS, 441 U.S. 1, 13 (1979). By itself, a consent decree ""might not remove a naked 
price-fixing scheme from the ambit of the per se rule."" Id. "
281,1," The defendants, all of whom operate oil refineries in California, are Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO), Chevron Corporation 
(Chevron), Exxon Corporation (Exxon), Mobil Oil Company (Mobil), Shell Oil Company (Shell), Texaco Refining and Marketing, 
Inc. (Texaco), Union Oil Company of California (Unocal), Tosco Corporation (Tosco) and Ultramar Inc. (Ultramar) (collectively 
referred to as defendants). During the pendency of this appeal, plaintiffs and defendant Unocal entered into a settlement of the 
action and Unocal is no longer a party to this appeal. References to Unocal in this opinion are included to establish background 
information and to discuss alleged collusion among defendants, including Unocal. "
282,2," The word ""capacity"" as used in this opinion refers to the capacity of an oil refinery to produce CARB gas, unless otherwise 
specified or the context otherwise requires."
282,3," For example, Tosco operates one refinery in California, the Avon refinery. Tosco estimated it would cost at least $ 400 million 
to convert Avon to 100 percent capacity. Tosco instead devoted approximately 50 percent of Avon's total gasoline production to 
CARB gas, and 50 percent to conventional gasoline that could be exported for sale outside of California. Tosco met its shortfall 
of demand for CARB gas by entering into exchange agreements with other refiners to trade CARB gas for conventional gasoline. "
283,4," The production of CARB gas was curtailed from March through June 1996 by unplanned refinery operational problems. 
Additionally, Shell's Martinez refinery, which had produced 87,000 BPD in March 1996, was damaged by a fire on April 1, 1996, 
and could produce only 20,000 BPD in April 1996 and 47,000 BPD in May 1996."
283,5," The studies concluded that Texaco's modification plans would be less capital intensive than those of its competitors and would 
therefore provide Texaco with a competitive advantage. "
284,6," Unocal's evidentiary showing resembled Tosco's. It described Unocal's independent business reasons motivating its capacity 
decisions without expressly denying that its investment choices on refinery capacity were influenced by an agreement with other 
defendants. Mr. Randle, Unocal's manager responsible for planning refinery activities for its gasoline refineries, explained 
Unocal considered three options: invest $ 450 million to produce 120,000 barrels per day, of which 100,000 would be CARB gas; 
invest $ 300 million to produce 120,000 barrels per day, of which 50,000 would be CARB gas; or liquidating all refining and 
marketing operations. Unocal commissioned studies to evaluate the likely demand for and price of CARB gas, and assess 
whether Unocal would be a high-cost producer. Unocal ultimately elected the first alternative and explained the business 
reasons why various other alternatives, including spending an additional $ 140 million on an alkylation plant, were not pursued."
284,7," Oil Price Information Service (OPIS) is an independently owned and operated commercial information service that collects 
pricing information for numerous petroleum products and reports historical price information to its subscribers. The OPIS spot 
price for CARB gas summarizes the prevailing market prices for bulk purchases of CARB gas on the open market. "
285,8," A Chevron employee involved in buying and selling CARB gas on the West Coast spot market explained that at least 20 
entities not affiliated with any of defendants buy and sell on the spot market, have competing interests and no incentive to allow 
manipulation of the spot price. Some of these entities are exclusively buyers, without any incentive to maintain artificially high 
spot prices, and others are trading companies that have different price incentives at different times, depending on whether they 
have taken ""long"" or ""short"" positions at any given time."
285,9," Defendants also showed that exchange agreements between competitors is a long-standing industry practice. There are 
several forms of Exchange agreements: an exchange of like-kind products between competitors with geographically matching 
needs; an exchange of different products between a competitor who is long on one product but short on another with a 
competitor who has correspondingly opposite needs; and exchanges of product needed for current marketing needs in return for 
deliveries to satisfy future marketing needs. The geographical exchanges allow both parties to reduce transportation and storage 
costs, and avoid the environmental and safety risks associated with storing and transporting products to marketing outlets 
distant from their refinery. "
286,10," The Southern California deliveries help Shell satisfy its retail needs in Southern California, and the Northern California 
deliveries provide Shell with product it can then trade to other refiners for product Shell needs elsewhere."
286,11," Shell also had an exchange agreement with Ultramar providing that Shell deliver between 2,000 and 3,000 BPD premium to 
Ultramar in Northern California in exchange for like amounts of regular CARB gas in Southern California, with Ultramar paying a 
price differential for the difference in grade."
286,12," Shell's other exchange agreement is with Exxon. Shell delivers conventional gasoline to Exxon from Shell's Anacortes refinery 
in exchange for conventional gasoline from Exxon's Spokane refinery. However, Exxon receives more conventional gasoline 
from Shell's Anacortes refinery than Shell receives from Exxon's Spokane facility, so Exxon equalizes the imbalance by 
delivering CARB gas to Shell in Northern California, providing Shell with product to trade for additional Southern California 
product needed by Shell."
286,13," Barnes averred that from March through December 1996 sales to independents accounted for 32 percent and sales to third 
party wholesalers and traders accounted for 16 percent of all CARB gas sold by Ultramar in California. "
288,14," Chevron's March 1993 strategic study recognized that because California's relative isolation and unique product requirements 
created barriers to imports, there were ""opportunities for well positioned refiners"" and the market was ""dominated by a limited 
number of large, committed refiner/marketers whose individual actions can have significant market impact."" A Shell analyst 
stated in his deposition that an historical problem was that the industry would ""overbuild [and that's] why we have such low 
margins."" At an ARCO CARB gas strategy meeting in March 1994 the advantages of not encouraging oversupply because 
""excess supply can hurt integrated margins"" were discussed."
288,15," By the end of 1993 negotiations to extend the exchange agreement ended because Tosco and ARCO could not agree on the 
price for the CARB gas to be delivered by Tosco to ARCO under a new agreement."
288,16," During this same time period of November 1993 through April 1994, ARCO was also discussing potential exchange 
agreements with Exxon, Ultramar and Tosco, and Chevron had direct contacts with Shell and Texaco."
288,17," A March 1994 memo informed Chevron's management that Chevron would have excess capacity, while the industry supply 
""appears balanced too short,"" and that ""several uncertainties emerge from the supply/demand balances [including] independent 
marketers have no known or foreseeable source of CARB [gas]."" The memo suggested that ""[downstream marketing does] not 
have a thorough understanding of the CARB [gas] opportunity or the widespread rearranging of supplies that are needed. [P] . . . 
The opportunity for Chevron lies in finding better outlets than . . . traditional sales into the spot market or a variation on exports. "
289,," [P] If nothing changes, some or most of Chevron's physical excess CARB [gas] barrels will flow through the independent 
marketers at spot-like realizations. [P] The downside to having no integrated strategy will be last minute scrambling to balance, 
foregone opportunities to get the best for ourselves, and perhaps a major market imbalance."""
289,18," Chevron's internal documents following its March 1994 meeting with ARCO reflect that Chevron learned gasoline balances 
were ""per industry intelligence [P] -Arco to [thirty] (30) CARB [P] --Unocal to balance [P] -Tosco-cut CARB [gas] production to 54 
. . . ."" A senior manager at Chevron was given the job of contacting Shell and Texaco for an ""update on plans."""
289,19," After Tosco decided to limit its capital expenditures at its Avon facility to $ 100 million and to produce a targeted 60,000 BPD, 
Tosco negotiated the exchange agreement with Chevron to ""provide Tosco additional Marketing volume and to gain control of 
[Chevron's] excess CARB production . . . ."""
289,20," The parties signed a letter of intent on September 15, 1994, and the following week announced Tosco had reached agreement 
with Chevron to exchange 30,000 BPD for conventional gasoline."
289,21," Although plaintiffs claim Ultramar's executives also signaled competitors on production capacity, plaintiffs cite only a syllabus 
from a December 1995 trade association seminar and a February 1996 newspaper interview, both of which allude to capacity 
information for the industry. Plaintiffs do not explain how this information could have affected capacity decisions made years 
earlier by the respective refiners."
289,22," Plaintiffs claimed O'Malley's signal was then seized by Exxon in an internal Exxon memo several days later detailing Exxon's 
strategy. Although the Exxon internal report discusses strategies for maximizing profitability with the prospect for a shortage of 
CARB gas, the internal memo does not mention O'Malley or his estimates, and indeed, Exxon's estimate of the overall CARB 
gas shortfall was 30 percent less than O'Malley's estimate. Neither O'Malley's comments nor the Exxon internal report discloses 
the source for their disparate assessments of the prospective shortfall."
289,23," Although plaintiffs suggested this memo shows a strategy being developed to limit supply and reduce sales to independents, 
plaintiffs overlook the memo's discussion, as a part of Exxon's strategy, of a desire to ""increase unbranded netbacks [versus] 
spot market."" The memo also discusses Exxon's unbranded marketing options, including extending Exxon's contract with Tower "
290,," Energy, developing Exxon's unbranded rack marketing business, negotiating supply contracts with Tosco or Ultramar (who are 
""aggressive sellers at unbranded rack""), or negotiating a fixed fee marketing contract with Tower Energy."
290,24," PACE explained that its extensive experience, databases and ability to simulate California refineries would enable it to assess 
the future impacts of CARB gas on production and consumption in California. PACE planned to examine the viewpoints of 
refiners, transporters, distributors, blenders, and state and federal regulators to prepare its study, which would enable it to give 
definitive answers to logistics, blending, crude oil supply, competitive assessment, and facilities construction questions."
290,25," In early January 1994, PACE planned to contact each defendant and ask for general information about verification of refinery 
modifications, construction completion outlook, logistics of importing and exporting gasoline blendstocks, and expected total 
gasoline and percentage of CARB gas. Plaintiffs do not specify whether this information was confidential competitive information 
unavailable through public channels, or which refiner-specific confidential information PACE passed to any other defendants. 
Instead, it appears PACE was gathering information to develop its computer models to develop scenarios for CARB gas supply, 
demand, price and price volatility."
290,26," Plaintiffs have not on appeal cited any confidential competitive information obtained by PACE that was integrated into or 
influenced PACE's report."
290,27," Plaintiffs speculated that this multi-client survey was a method to use PACE as a clearinghouse to pass confidential 
information to the competitors. However, a review of the evidence does not support this thesis. For example, plaintiffs cite a ""call 
report"" between ARCO's Ms. Richards (who performs the competitive assessment work for ARCO) and PACE in which Ms. 
Richards ""admitted"" some of her work involved ""passing of information."" However, this cryptic comment does not identify to 
whom information is passed, and whether that information is passed to consultants subject to confidentiality agreements to 
enable consultants to work on ARCO-specific projects. There is no evidence she or anyone else at ARCO passed confidential 
information to PACE, and ARCO did not use PACE as a consultant. Moreover, the inference plaintiffs draw--that PACE obtained 
confidential information during this survey and then passed it to others--is inconsistent with the materials submitted by plaintiffs. 
For example, a ""call report"" between Unocal and PACE, in which Unocal disclosed it had canceled plans for an alkylation 
project, states, ""The project is now [canceled]. Even though everyone 'knows' it is [canceled], the announcement is not public. 
(We [PACE] cannot confirm the [cancellation] to others.)"" Similarly, in a report synopsizing contact between PACE and Tosco in 
February 1994 in which PACE tried to convince Tosco to purchase the study, Tosco asked about the types of information the 
study would contain, and specifically asked how much detail PACE would provide about individual refineries. PACE cautioned 
that ""for legal reasons we will have to limit details. However . . . [PACE] can provide such details on a single client basis[, and "
291,," Tosco] indicated that they might be interested in evaluations of their actual plans in light of our findings."" The import of these 
comments was that PACE would provide detailed analysis of a client's individual refinery plans directly to that client, but could 
not divulge details of other defendants' plans because of legal constraint."
291,28," As evidence for this proposition, plaintiffs cite only a quote from the deposition of Chevron's Mr. Blackwell: ""The only reason 
for doing an exchange [is] if you needed product in an area where you didn't have a refinery. . . ."" However, Blackwell actually 
stated, in response to a question asking whether it was a requirement that exchanges have a geographical component, ""That 
would be the only reason--that would be a reason for doing an exchange: If you needed product in an area where you didn't 
have a refinery. . . ."" (Emphasis added.) The italicized statement, which plaintiffs chose to omit, demonstrates that other reasons 
may motivate exchange agreements."
291,29, But see Appendix G.
291,30," Plaintiffs alleged defendants conspired to limit supplies to independents. However, the record shows that during 1996 Mobil 
had contracts with three independent gas wholesalers, who were free to resell to anyone, under which Mobil sold approximately 
12,000 BPD. Exxon sold 30,000 BPD to independent Tower Energy, and smaller amounts to other independents. Ultramar (with 
a capacity of 60,000 BPD) averred that almost 50 percent of its CARB gas sales between March and December 1996 were to 
independents and large, third party wholesalers."
291,31," Plaintiffs cited Chevron's June 1994 CARB gas strategy, which was to improve West Coast profitability through ""profitable 
exports and/or processing, exchange or supply arrangements with other companies"" and its 1995 strategy for improving 
profitability of its El Segundo refinery, which was to ""place surplus [CARB gas] in California market with other refiners to 
maximize return on refinery investments until adequate marketing outlets are developed."" However, the evidence showed that 
Chevron did not want to produce CARB gas in excess of its existing retail marketing needs unless (1) a specific buyer was 
identified and an appropriate price established and (2) the sale to that buyer would not ""adversely impact the current market 
structure or undermine our long term retail gasoline strategy . . . ."" Chevron's O'Reilly explained that Chevron wanted to focus on 
its Chevron brand sales, and did not want to sell to ""enemies who will then undermine our own branded market customers. [P] 
And it also means that we don't want to . . . have some other company take the growth opportunities out there that we see. 
We're trying to expand our retail marketing system, and we don't want to . . . help somebody else get there before us."" Plaintiffs also cited evidence that Exxon, developing its CARB gas strategy during 1995, recognized it was a major supplier to 
the unbranded market and had the opportunity to increase its share of that market ""post-CARB"" because Tosco would be 
required to direct its conventional gasoline outside of California. However, Exxon also recognized that a supply guarantee to the 
unbranded market could depress prices. Exxon pursued a strategy to place its additional volume with ""branded 'anyone'"" or 
through term sales, and to avoid placing product into the San Francisco Bay Area spot market (where supplies were expected to 
be ""long"")."
291,32," One of Ultramar's contracts had a rebate provision with the individual purchasers. However, if a purchaser bought more than 
one million gallons in any given month he would not receive the rebate for the additional gas purchased. "
292,33," The Chevron/Tosco agreement and the Chevron/Shell agreement involved exchanging CARB for conventional gasoline. The 
Chevron/Tosco agreement involved a two-tiered price differential: Tosco paid a set price differential (5.75 cpg plus a variable 
""MTBE pass-through"" charge) for 50 percent of the CARB gas it received from Chevron, and a floating price differential (priced 
at the average spot market differential between CARB and conventional gasoline) for the other 50 percent of the CARB gas it 
received from Chevron. This agreement involved a gamble by Tosco, which Tosco lost, because the actual market differential 
was below the 5.75 cpg Tosco paid for 17,500 BPD. (See Appendix D.) The Chevron/Shell agreement involved a similar 
formula, utilizing a fixed differential and a floating differential, to account for the difference between CARB gas and conventional 
gasoline being exchanged."
292,34," Chevron's Products Division, in recommending to Chevron's management approval of the Tosco agreement, opined that the 
formula devised under the Chevron/Tosco agreement would yield ""about 9-11 cpg depending on market conditions [and] we 
expect the average market differential will be similar."""
292,35," Plaintiffs make no effort on appeal to demonstrate that the OPIS spot price was the uniform pricing mechanism used by 
defendants in their exchange agreements. Although some agreements in addition to the Chevron/Tosco and Chevron/Shell 
agreements use the OPIS spot price in whole or in part to price CARB gas, many others did not. For example, many of the 
exchange agreements, including the ARCO/Shell agreements, do not use OPIS to set prices but instead use a fixed ""location 
differential"" based on pipeline tariff charges."
292,36," Although a price is reported, OPIS does not report sales volume."
292,37," Plaintiffs' brief also asserts Lundberg reports the wholesale prices that defendants will charge in the future. However, the 
record cited by plaintiffs for this proposition contains no reference to future wholesale prices. "
293,38," Noll opined that defendants had a ""general agreement that they wanted to reduce capacity in the supply of CARB gas, and 
they exchanged information for the purpose of engaging in more effective joint planning in the sense of one firm taking into 
account, in a more comprehensive way than would otherwise be possible, the supply decisions of another."" However, when 
asked whether he could identify any examples of direct contacts among defendants in which they exchanged information not 
obtainable from public documents, Noll was unable to do so."
293,39," Noll did not submit a declaration in opposition to defendants' motions for summary judgment; instead, plaintiffs submitted 
portions of Noll's deposition testimony. Although plaintiffs urge on appeal that Noll's deposition testimony supports several 
subsidiary propositions, plaintiffs' citations to Noll's deposition often do not support the proposition urged by plaintiffs. 
Accordingly, we must speculate on the precise limitations on and basis for Noll's opinions."
293,40," Noll opined that because there is no separation between the buying and selling functions in a defendant's trading department, 
defendants' employees engaged in trading have frequent contact with their counterparts and are cognizant of which companies 
are buying or selling at any given time and are able to coordinate buying/selling activity without independent conflicting goals. "
294,41," Plaintiffs also argue defendants cannot rationally explain the elevated CARB gas prices. Plaintiffs again argue based on facts 
that their record citations do not support. Plaintiffs claim changes in crude oil prices do not explain the CARB gas price 
increases, but they cite pages of Noll's testimony in which crude oil prices are never mentioned. Plaintiffs cite a declaration by 
Noll, submitted in support of plaintiffs' motion for new trial, that peremptorily asserts the crude oil price increase was ""quite small"" 
without any detailed discussion of the basis for this assertion. Plaintiffs next assert the cost to produce CARB gas is 
""substantially less"" than the change in price and cannot explain all of the price increase, but can only account for a 6 cpg 
increase. Noll stated neither the basis for his 6 cpg estimate nor whether that estimate includes or excludes amounts to provide 
for a reasonable return on defendants' capital investments. Noll also claimed the refinery outages at two refineries cannot 
account for the price increase because neither production nor inventories were ""low"" following the outages. However, Noll 
apparently assumed the refinery outages had no effect on the availability of product or the market spot price for filling the gap 
between supply and demand, even though another part of plaintiffs' theory was that defendants purposefully implemented limits 
on capacity to create a ""tight"" supply/demand balance."
294,42," Bloom described trade association meetings as providing an opportunity for exchanging confidential information, but 
acknowledged that it was not per se improper to attend these meetings. When asked to identify what information defendants 
actually exchanged at these meetings, he identified only O'Malley's speech and claimed that O'Malley disclosed Tosco's 
production plans. However, the only evidence of O'Malley's speech was that he projected there would be a shortage of CARB 
gas in 1996, that price rises were probable, and that price spikes were possible. Tosco had already publicly announced its 
production plans and its agreement with Chevron to trade CARB for conventional gasoline. Bloom also identified a speech by 
Brown at an OPIS conference, but did not identify any confidential competitive information disclosed by Brown in that speech."
294,43," At the 1994 Pacific Oil Conference, O'Malley predicted price increases of 6 cpg for manufacturing and 4 cpg for oxygenate, 
and that any unplanned shutdowns could lead to significant price spikes. At the 1995 Pacific Oil Conference, Ultramar's Westfall 
predicted tightened spot markets with price spikes occurring in the event of unplanned shortfalls. Chevron's MacDonald noted in 
August 1995 that CARB production capacity was ""delicately balanced with expected demand"" and that any ""prolonged and 
significant incidents in the summer could lead to shortages . . . both of these conclusions imply a price spike above long term 
equilibrium pricing . . . ."" The consultants agreed with those assessments."
294,44," ARCO prepared information for use by their personnel, and the Western States Petroleum Association prepared a May 1996 
set of brochures that attributed recent gas price increases to higher crude oil costs, unplanned refinery shutdowns, and the 
increased costs associated with producing CARB gas. "
295,45," The California Air Resources Board chairman's press release complaining of a lack of a satisfactory explanation was 
apparently premature. By January 1997, the California Air Resources Board reported to the California Legislature that the price 
increases were attributable to a confluence of market forces that included (1) increased crude oil prices, (2) seasonal demand 
increases for gasoline and diesel fuel, (3) lower inventories, (4) a significant unplanned outage at Shell's Martinez refinery and a 
series of minor outages at other refineries, (5) the increased operating and capital costs to produce CARB gas rather than 
federal RFG gas, and (6) an increased sales tax component associated with rising retail prices. Reports by federal agencies 
reached similar conclusions and in 1997 the Department of Justice closed its antitrust investigation pertaining to retail gasoline 
prices. Plaintiffs' experts simply disagree with the state and federal government assessments that market forces provide an 
explanation for the price increases."
295,46, All further statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure unless otherwise specified.
295,47," The trial court rejected plaintiffs' claims of irregularity in the proceedings, accident or surprise, newly discovered evidence and 
insufficiency of the evidence as grounds for granting plaintiffs' motion for new trial. "
296,48," Plaintiffs' motion also asserted insufficiency of the evidence, but the trial court recognized this assertion merely recast 
plaintiffs' claim that there was an error of law in shifting the burden to plaintiffs because defendants' showing was allegedly 
insufficient. "
299,49," Plaintiffs suggest that no burden is shifted to plaintiffs to make any counter-showing until the defendants conclusively negate 
an essential element of the plaintiffs' claim. However, the Union Bank court noted that the Legislature, when it amended section 
437c, did not adopt the language of the judicially declared rule of ""conclusively negating"" an element of plaintiffs' claim, but 
instead chose to describe the defendant's burden as providing evidence showing that one or more elements of plaintiffs' cause 
of action ""cannot be established."" ( Union Bank v. Superior Court, supra, 31 Cal. App. 4th at pp. 585, 586, fn. 8.) Other courts 
have recognized that the continued use of the ""conclusively negate"" terminology as the requisite showing continues to cause 
uncertainty as to the level of proof required. (See Scheiding v. Dinwiddie Construction Co. (1999) 69 Cal. App. 4th 64, 81-82.) 
We are convinced the decisions in Allyson v. Department of Transportation (1997) 53 Cal. App. 4th 1304 and the other cited 
cases correctly hold that a defendant satisfies his burden by producing evidence that prima facie shows an essential element of 
the plaintiff's claim cannot be established. Application of the more stringent ""conclusively negate"" standard is inconsistent with 
the statutory structure. The statute contemplates that a sufficient showing by a defendant will shift to plaintiff the burden of 
making a counter-showing raising a triable issue of material fact. However, if the initial showing shifts the burden only if it has 
conclusively negated an essential element, by definition plaintiff's counter-showing would be an exercise in futility; the defendant 
has already conclusively negated the element. This court sub silentio approved the ""prima facie"" approach in McManis v. San 
Diego Postal Credit Union (1998) 61 Cal. App. 4th 547, 558-559 (but see Kovatch v. California Casualty Management Co. 
(1998) 65 Cal. App. 4th 1256, 1266), and it is the only interpretation that gives content to statutory shifting of the burden of proof 
and makes meaningful the opponent's counter-showing. HN16[

299,50," A plaintiff may not defeat a summary judgment motion by producing evidence to support claims that are outside the issues 
framed by the pleading. ( Robinson v. Hewlett-Packard Corp. (1986) 183 Cal. App. 3d 1108, 1131-1132, 228 Cal. Rptr. 591; City 
of Hope Nat. Medical Center v. Superior Court (1992) 8 Cal. App. 4th 633, 639.) "
300,51," Inferences to raise triable issues of fact must be reasonable and cannot be based on ""speculation, conjecture, imagination, or 
guesswork."" ( Joseph E. Di Loreto, Inc. v. O'Neill (1991) 1 Cal. App. 4th 149, 161.) Because a plaintiff has the burden of proof by 
a preponderance of the evidence, the inferences he relies on to defeat summary judgment must satisfy the ""more likely than not"" 
burden that he will bear at trial. ( Leslie G. v. Perry & Associates, supra, 43 Cal. App. 4th at p. 487; Cf.  Kidron v. Movie 
Acquisition Corp. (1995) 40 Cal. App. 4th 1571, 1580-1581 [grant of nonsuit proper when plaintiff's evidence does not support 
logical and reasonable inference in his favor and is nothing more than speculation or conjecture]; California Shoppers, Inc. v. 
Royal Globe Ins. Co. (1985) 175 Cal. App. 3d 1, 44-45, 221 Cal. Rptr. 171 [an inference may not be illogically and unreasonably 
drawn or be based on mere possibility or suspicion, imagination, speculation, supposition, surmise, conjecture or guesswork]; 
Salter v. Keller (1964) 224 Cal. App. 2d 126, 128, 36 Cal. Rptr. 430 ["". . . it is incumbent upon the plaintiff to produce evidence 
which supports a logical inference in his favor and which does more than raise a mere conjecture or surmise that the fact is as 
alleged.""].) Finally, as discussed below, substantive law may limit the inferences that may be drawn from ambiguous 
circumstantial evidence. (See pt. IV.B., post.)"
300,52," Although plaintiffs' complaint contains a UCA claim in addition to a Cartwright Act claim, the core of both claims is the alleged 
agreement among defendants to fix and control the capacity, production and price of CARB gas. Defendants' motions for 
summary judgment focused on the crucial element of ""agreement."" Although it is not invariably necessary to show an agreement 
or conspiracy in a UCA claim in contrast to a Cartwright Act claim ( Biljac, supra, 218 Cal. App. 3d at p. 1422), and unilateral 
action can violate the UCA ( Motors, Inc. v. Times Mirror Co. (1980) 102 Cal. App. 3d 735, 741-742, 162 Cal. Rptr. 543), the 
UCA allegations in this case require a conspiracy. Plaintiffs' UCA claim alleged that defendants, by agreeing to coordinate their 
actions, violated the UCA. Plaintiffs did not allege in their UCA claim that any individual defendant, by making its individual 
capacity, production or pricing decisions, violated the UCA. Indeed, in plaintiffs' discovery responses, they admitted that 
defendants' business practices, to the extent the practices were ""otherwise separate, distinct conduct not alleged to be 
coordinated in an unlawful manner,"" did not violate California law except to the extent the practices violated the Cartwright Act. 
Additionally, apart from plaintiffs' generic citations on appeal asserting that the UCA is distinct from and can be violated without 
engaging in conduct violating the Cartwright Act, plaintiffs do not cite any unfair-competition-law authority demonstrating that 
their UCA claim is applicable to defendants' conduct apart from the alleged antitrust conduct. We could deem this an 
abandonment of their UCA claim. ( Biljac, supra, at pp. 1423-1424.) However, because the UCA provides remedies that are 
cumulative to those provided by the Cartwright Act ( People v. McKale (1979) 25 Cal. 3d 626, 632, 159 Cal. Rptr. 811, 602 P.2d 
731; Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17205), we assume plaintiffs' lack of separate analysis means that the alleged acts are ""unlawful"" 
under the UCA only to the extent that they violate the Cartwright Act. (See Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal. 3d 311, 329, 216 Cal. 
Rptr. 718, 703 P.2d 58.) Accordingly, we analyze the alleged conspiracy as do the parties: we use only those cases interpreting 
the Cartwright Act and federal antitrust laws. HN20[
] -"
300,53," Indeed, the comparative scarcity of state-court precedent often means that we must rely heavily on federal cases. ( Redwood 
Theatres, Inc. v. Festival Enterprises, Inc. (1988) 200 Cal. App. 3d 687, 694, 248 Cal. Rptr. 189.) "
302,54," The court in Biljac declined to accept or reject the application of the federal limitation on permissible inferences. The majority 
acknowledged that to the extent the limitations were derived from the substantive policies underlying antitrust laws, it would be 
fully applicable to Cartwright Act claims because the policies underlying both statutes were identical. ( Biljac, supra, 218 Cal. 
App. 3d at pp. 1425-1427.) However, the concurring opinion perceived that the limitation was based on the evidentiary burdens 
applicable to summary judgment motions in federal court under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, rule 56, 28 U.S.C., and 
California's section 437c was sufficiently different from the federal approach to allow application of the federal cases. ( Biljac, 
218 Cal. App. 3d at pp. 1435-1445 [conc. opn. of Kline, J.].) "
304,55," Plaintiffs claim Biljac rejected the federal approach. Although Biljac ostensibly declined to decide whether the federal approach 
was applicable, it relied on Wilcox v. First Interstate Bank of Oregon, N.A., supra, 815 F.2d 522 (which used the Matsushita 
approach), and de facto employed the federal approach in its analysis. For example, rejecting the plaintiffs' claims that the 
conspiracy could be inferred from participation by the defendants in trade association meetings, Biljac noted there was a strong 
policy that disseminating competitive information through trade association activities is condoned by antitrust law, and therefore 
that ""plaintiffs must show conspiracy with something beyond"" those activities. ( Biljac, supra, 218 Cal. App. 3d at pp. 1432-1433.)"
304,56," Plaintiffs finally argue that Matsushita applies only when a plaintiff relies on ""ambiguous"" circumstantial evidence--conduct that 
could have either pro- or anti-competitive purposes and effects--to show the requisite agreement, and that this case involves 
unambiguous evidence of a combination to fix prices that can never have a significant pro-competitive effect. This is a classic 
bootstrap argument: because defendants' conduct was undertaken pursuant to a conspiracy to fix prices, their conduct cannot 
have a pro-competitive effect and therefore their conduct is not ""ambiguous""; because defendants' conduct is not ambiguous, 
defendants' conduct may alone serve as a springboard from which to infer the conspiracy existed. Plaintiffs may not assume the 
existence of a conspiracy as a predicate to proving defendants engaged in anti-competitive conduct from which the conspiracy 
may then be inferred. "
305,57, Biljac was decided before the California summary judgment statute was amended to more closely resemble the federal rules.
305,58," Biljac also referred to federal precedents holding that conspiracy allegations can be rebutted by showing justifiable reasons for 
practices consistent with independent business practice. Biljac referred to the decision in Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. 
Zenith Radio, supra, 475 U.S. 574 in which the U.S. Supreme Court held that, although on summary judgment the inferences to 
be drawn from the facts must be viewed most favorably to the party opposing the motion, ""antitrust law limits the range of 
permissible inferences from ambiguous evidence in a [Sherman Antitrust Act section] 1 case. Thus, in Monsanto Co. v. Spray-
Rite Service Corp.[, supra,] 465 U.S. 752[, 104 S. Ct. 1464, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775] . . ., we held that conduct as consistent with 
permissible competition as with illegal conspiracy does not, standing alone, support an inference of antitrust conspiracy. [Id. at p. 
764.] [Citation.] To survive a motion for summary judgment . . ., a plaintiff seeking damages for a violation of § 1 must present 
evidence 'that tends to exclude the possibility' that the alleged conspirators acted independently. [Id. at p. 764.] [Plaintiffs], in 
other words, must show that the inference of conspiracy is reasonable in light of the competing inferences of independent action 
or collusive action that could not have harmed [them]. [Citation.]"" (475 U.S. at pp. 587-588.) "
306,59," Our interpretation of Biljac's reference to an ""unbroken chain"" finds support in several observations. First, the Biljac court 
described as the ""unbroken chain of officers"" those ""whose principal responsibility it was to determine the bank's prime rate and 
commercial loan pricing policies from 1970 into 1986."" ( Biljac, supra, 218 Cal. App. 3d at p. 1423.) Second, that description was 
immediately preceded by the observation that the moving defendants presented declarations from the officers and employees 
""charged over the years in question"" with setting their rates, suggesting that Biljac was concerned with the time element. (Ibid.) 
Third, the Biljac court repeatedly describes the plaintiffs' conspiracy theory as an agreement between the banks that evolved 
over a multi-year period (see Biljac at pp. 1417, 1423-1424, 1429-1434), which reinforces our conclusion that Biljac was 
concerned with the chain of personnel involved in rate setting over the years of the alleged conspiracy, rather than the vertical 
chain of command within the banks between 1970 and 1986. Finally, the legal authority cited by Biljac as supporting its 
conclusions that the declarations were adequate ( Id. at p. 1424) were cases involving declarations from persons competent to 
testify about the practices during the relevant time periods even though those declarants were not the chief executive officers for 
the defendants. (See Chatman v. Alameda Flood Control etc. Dist. (1986) 183 Cal. App. 3d 424, 428-429, 228 Cal. Rptr. 257 
[averments by engineer for flood control district, who declared district did not approve, accept, have easements in, or take 
responsibility for culvert, competent to establish these issues on district's behalf in summary judgment motion]; Zuckerman v. 
Pacific Savings Bank, supra, 187 Cal. App. 3d at p. 1404 [declaration of one individual, holding position as collections and 
foreclosure manager during relevant time period, sufficient to establish bank's practices]; Kiernan v. Union Bank (1976) 55 Cal. 
App. 3d 111, 116, 127 Cal. Rptr. 441 [declarations from a vice president and an operations officer, employed during relevant 
time period, sufficient to establish bank's practices].)"
306,60," For example, Texaco's Vice President for Planning and Administration established that product slates are determined at the 
refinery level, and Messrs. Abay and Hall, Texaco's general managers responsible for the overall operations of Texaco's two 
refineries, averred they had ""ultimate authority and responsibility"" over their production mix and made those decisions ""without 
any communication, agreement, or concerted action"" with other defendants. Similar representations were made by other 
defendants. (See, e.g., declaration by Shell's Mr. May [""I am responsible for overseeing gasoline production planning at Martinez 
. . . [and] all decisions regarding the slate of products and production levels at Martinez are made independently by myself and 
other employees at Martinez. . . .""] and ARCO's Mr. Kiracofe [as ""Senior Vice[] President for ARCO Products Company . . . I had 
responsibility for . . . overseeing ARCO's two refineries and the development of manufacturing volumetric plans for those 
refineries"" and ARCO's plans for production slates are determined during weekly meetings attended by representatives of its 
refinery, volume planning, product supply and wholesale marketing groups].) "
307,61," For example, Mr. Johnson, ARCO's Manager of Price Policy and Strategy, averred he had ""full . . . responsibility for 
administering and implementing [] ARCO's gasoline price policy at the wholesale level"" and denied involvement in or knowledge 
of any agreement to fix prices. Similarly, Chevron's Mr. Huccaby averred that he was ""Pricing Manager"" for Chevron and 
responsible for gasoline and diesel fuel pricing for the United States. He denied any agreement to fix the CARB gas price, and 
averred that Chevron sets its prices independently in its own best interests."
307,62," For example, Texaco's Mr. Diaz averred that as ""General Manager of Supply and Distribution I have the ultimate . . . 
responsibility for"" coordinating the supply needs of Texaco's marketing department with the production of its refineries, and for 
disposing of surplus or acquiring product to cover shortfalls, which tasks include making spot sales, term sales and exchange 
agreements. He averred he acted in Texaco's independent interest without collusion or agreement with its competitors, and 
negotiated agreements at arms length at prices based on good faith estimates of the market prices or by reference to reported 
market prices. Similarly, Ms. Barnes, Ultramar's General Manager of Product Supply and Distribution, was responsible for 
balancing gasoline supply and demand for Ultramar and was a participant in the negotiation of Ultramar's exchange agreements. 
She averred Ultramar's exchange agreements were independently negotiated in its independent business judgment. "
308,63," Plaintiffs' theory, asserted throughout these proceedings, was that defendants' agreements constituted a per se violation of 
antitrust laws. (See Plaintiffs' Opposition to Defendants' Demurrer at p. 2 [""the Complaint alleges . . . a per se violation of the 
Cartwright Act""]; Memorandum of Points & Authorities in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification at p. 2 [""the 
Complaint alleges a prototypical class action for horizontal price fixing, a per se violation of the Cartwright Act""]; Memorandum of 
Points & Authorities in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Adjudication of Affirmative Defenses at p. 1 [""plaintiffs . . . allege 
a horizontal price fixing agreement among the defendants . . . . This is a per se violation of the Cartwright Act""]; Plaintiffs' 
Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment at p. 2 [""the Cartwright Act violations must be judged according to a per se 
standard""] and fn. 1 [""the per se standard and its application are detailed in Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Adjudication of Issues 
. . . [and] defenses based on justification or reasonableness are not allowed""].)"
308,64," Moreover, even had plaintiffs' complaint focused on the effect of an exchange agreement, plaintiffs offered no evidence that 
any single exchange agreement had a sufficiently pernicious effect on competition to violate the Cartwright Act. Plaintiffs' theory, 
based on Noll's testimony, is that the aggregate of all the exchange agreements had an anti-competitive effect. However, 
plaintiffs offer no authority for the proposition that a two-party contract, otherwise permissible under antitrust laws, is transformed 
into a contract violative of antitrust laws merely because other actors independently enter similar contracts and the cumulative 
effect of these independent contracts is anti-competitive. Instead, we perceive that before Noll's cumulative impact theory could 
result in antitrust liability, plaintiffs are required to prove the two-party agreements were components of or methods to implement 
an overarching agreement among defendants. "
309,65," Plaintiffs cite the lawsuit by several defendants challenging the ""small refiners exemption"" as evidence of concerted action to 
restrict capacity. We are not persuaded by plaintiffs' argument. First, a defendant's concern that this exemption from CARB 
regulations permits small refiners to produce gas at lower costs, and thereby undermine the CARB ""market premium"" in some 
local markets, is not probative of an agreement to restrict overall capacity. The lawsuit is equally attributable to an independent 
legitimate business concern that the exemption gives an unfair competitive advantage to the exempt refiner against whom the 
defendants must compete to recoup their investment. HN37[
] Second, a company is entitled to pursue legal action, even in 
concert with other competitors, without violating antitrust laws. ( Blank v. Kirwan, supra, 39 Cal. 3d at pp. 320-321.)"
309,66," Plaintiffs also claim defendants used consultants as a vehicle for passing information to assist their agreement to coordinate 
refinery modification plans, a claim we discuss post. "
310,67," Plaintiffs' experts suggested that there was actually excess refinery capacity. Dr. Leffler explained his damage calculations did 
not make any adjustment for price increases attributable to the reduction in supplies caused by the Shell Martinez fire in April 
1996 because he understood that plaintiffs' expert Mr. Brown had opined ""there was 14 percent excess capacity available at the 
time of the Martinez fire that would have been more than sufficient to make up for any decreases in supply as a result of that 
fire."""
310,68," Plaintiffs also rely on a March 1993 contact between the chairmen of ARCO and Chevron as evidence of the conspiracy to 
restrict capacity. However, the evidence cited by plaintiffs is an internal Chevron memo stating that in March 1993 Chevron 
reassessed the possibility for lobbying to delay implementation of the new regulations, unanimity would be needed in that effort, 
Chevron's chairman contacted ARCO's chairman and learned ARCO still supported the regulations and the timing, and therefore 
Chevron dropped the effort. There is no suggestion this contact concerned capacity. HN39[
] Furthermore, there is no 
prohibition against joint lobbying activity. ( Blank v. Kirwan, supra, 39 Cal. 3d at p. 320.)"
310,69," Plaintiffs note that between November 1993 and April 1994, ARCO discussed potential supply contracts with Exxon, Ultramar 
and Tosco, and Chevron had direct contacts with Shell and Texaco. From this evidence, plaintiffs infer Chevron and ARCO ""held 
the proxy"" for all other defendants to discuss and agree on coordinated refinery modifications. We decline to draw this 
conclusion. First, Unocal and Mobil are absent from the alleged ""assembly of the whole."" Second, it is pure speculation that the 
negotiators of a two-party exchange agreement controlled by proxy the investment decisions (involving billions of dollars) of non-
participants."
310,70," Plaintiffs conceded that ""by September 1993, ARCO had decided to completely convert the Los Angeles Refinery to the 
production of CARB gasoline,"" and actually increased its capacity in Los Angeles. Similarly, Chevron's capital expenditure 
project was approved in September 1993, which ultimately increased its capacity, and plaintiffs cite nothing to suggest Chevron 
altered its plans as a result of an agreement arising out of later ARCO/Chevron exchange agreement discussions."
310,71," Plaintiffs' efforts to prove there were direct contacts among defendants to discuss and agree on coordinated capacity also rely 
on a December 1992 internal Texaco memo by a Texaco employee summarizing a conversation with a Shell governmental 
relations official, in which Shell expressed ""[extreme concern] about Texaco's silence and lack of activity concerning [Texaco's] 
plans"" for coping with the new California Air Resources Board regulations. The memo reflects that most other defendants had 
already announced their plans or had begun steps to secure the permits necessary to modify their refineries. Shell was nervous 
that Texaco was ""positioning itself to be the 'wild card' on this issue"" and stated that if Texaco sought to use imported sources of 
CARB gas, Shell would take legislative action to prevent that course. It is paradoxical that plaintiffs use evidence of Texaco's 
silence and non-cooperation, and its possible use of a different strategy that could undermine the competitive position of Shell, 
as proof that Texaco agreed to coordinate capacity. "
311,72," The fact any two defendants entered an agreement is directly shown by the exchange agreements. However, entry into an 
agreement is not direct evidence of a different agreement to restrict and pool supply and fix prices. HN40[
] Antitrust law bars only agreements designed to achieve an unlawful objective. ( Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., supra, 465 U.S. at p. 
764.) To find that defendants entered into an unlawful agreement requires inferences from the exchange agreements. ( Biljac, 
supra, 218 Cal. App. 3d at p. 1430.)"
311,73," Plaintiffs' expert acknowledged that ""it was in the self-interests of each company entering into an exchange to do that, 
regardless of what other competitors . . . were doing."" "
312,74," Exchange agreements are also beneficial to the environment because they eliminate the risks of accidental spills if product is 
required to be stored and then shipped great distances."
312,75," For example, plaintiffs claim that Exxon and ARCO entered into exchange agreements to prevent unbranded sales that 
depressed prices. However, the Exxon/ARCO agreement involved a convenience exchange that had independent business 
justifications. (See Appendix G.) Second, the only evidence cited to support plaintiffs' propositions are two mid-1995 internal 
Exxon memos that show when Exxon was developing its CARB gas strategy it recognized it was a major supplier of the 
unbranded market and had the opportunity to increase its share of that market ""post-CARB"" because Tosco would be required 
to ship its non-CARB gas outside of California. However, Exxon also recognized that a supply guarantee to the unbranded 
market could depress prices. The memo proposed that Exxon's strategy should be to place its additional volume with ""branded 
'anyone'"" or through term sales, and to avoiding placing product into the San Francisco Bay spot market where supplies were 
expected to be ""long""). Plaintiffs ignore that one of Exxon's listed priorities was sales to ""BE Trib unbranded,"" and that it in fact 
continued selling 30,000 BPD to independent Tower Energy, plus smaller amounts to other independents. Evidence that Exxon 
considered methods of increasing its profitability (1) shows nothing about ARCO's reasons for entering into the convenience 
exchange and (2) is as consistent with Exxon's permissible independent interest as with an illegal conspiracy. "
313,76," The Chevron/Tosco agreement involved a two-tiered price differential: Tosco paid a set price differential (5.75 cpg plus a 
variable ""MTBE pass-through"" charge) for 50 percent of the CARB gas it received from Chevron, and a ""floating"" price 
differential (priced at the average spot market differential between CARB gas and conventional gasoline) for the other 50 percent 
of the CARB gas it received from Chevron. The Chevron/Shell agreement involved an analogous formula, utilizing a fixed 
differential and a floating differential, to account for the difference between CARB gas and conventional gasoline being 
exchanged."
313,77," Moreover, there is no evidence there was an agreement among all defendants to use a set differential to fix the price of CARB 
gas based on a formula. Plaintiffs make no effort on appeal to demonstrate that the formula in the Chevron/Tosco and 
Chevron/Shell agreements was the agreed uniform pricing mechanism or even was used by other defendants in their exchange 
agreements, or that the price differentials were identical. Although some agreements used the OPIS price in whole or part to 
price CARB gas, others did not."
313,78," Plaintiffs also cite Donchin v. Guerrero (1995) 34 Cal. App. 4th 1832 for the same proposition. However, the issue in Donchin 
was whether a landlord knew of the vicious tendencies of a rottweiler dog on his premises. On summary judgment, the court 
concluded there was a triable issue of fact as to the landlord's knowledge. The court focused extensively on the fact that, after "
314,," the dog attacked, he denied knowing of the dog's presence and denied that he gave the dog's owners permission to keep the 
dog, both of which denials were demonstrably false exculpatory statements. ( Id. at pp. 1841-1843.) Although the court also 
concluded the plaintiff's affirmative evidence of the landlord's knowledge was ""fairly strong . . . we find the [evidence of false 
exculpatory statements] more persuasive and thus concentrate on it"" as a ground for concluding a triable issue of fact existed. ( 
Id. at p. 1840.) Although the expert's testimony, with other evidence, reinforced the ""inference already drawn from [landlord's] 
false exculpatory statement"" ( id. at p. 1845) that the landlord had knowledge of the dog's vicious tendencies, the opinion makes 
clear that numerous bases existed for rejecting summary judgment."
314,79," In addition to our conclusion that Noll's opinion does not provide a basis to infer the requisite agreement, Noll's opinion is also 
based on unsound assumptions, which we discuss more fully at pt. VII.B-4, post. "
315,80," Noll also appears to have disavowed any testimony that all the companies expressly agreed to create this institutional 
structure."
315,81," We admit some confusion over this aspect of plaintiffs' claim. In the exchange agreements with no imbalances in the amounts 
exchanged, the cost of the goods received by a company would appear to be the cost to produce the product that the defendant 
sent in exchange, with any appropriate transportation adjustments. Thus, we cannot perceive how the OPIS spot price would be 
at all relevant to the cost from which those companies would base their DTW and rack rates. "
316,82," For example, from March through October 1996 Ultramar engaged in 139 spot transactions with non-defendants who 
presumably had no interest in facilitating artificially high spot prices."
316,83," Although Noll theorized a defendant would be willing to pay an artificially high spot price in one transaction in order to reap the 
benefits of the higher OPIS spot price when it subsequently sold CARB gas using that elevated price, he declined in his 
deposition to identify any examples of transactions involving that conduct."
316,84," The evidence cited by plaintiffs does not show joint planning of price increases. The industry recognized prices would 
increase, but plaintiffs' proffered evidence of joint activity is evidence of unilateral activity. Plaintiffs cited a late 1995 internal 
ARCO document (without any showing it was distributed to other defendants) stating ""begin price increases to recover costs"" on 
April 1, 1996. Plaintiffs do not suggest that ARCO or any other defendant could not legitimately adopt some price increases to 
recoup their investments. Mr. Johnson, ARCO's Manager of Price Policy and Strategy, explained the unilateral and legitimate 
reasons for ARCO's actual price increase in April 1996: ARCO's lower pricing policy was generating such additional demand that 
ARCO was concerned about ""runouts"" of product; increases in crude oil prices and production costs were causing ARCO's core 
refining and marketing operations to lose money; and ARCO (because of increased demand and refinery problems) was forced 
to purchase product in spot transactions at high cost. Plaintiffs also cite Chevron's internal predictions that prices would rise and 
spikes ""could well occur"" in the event of prolonged and significant supply interruptions. Again, however, the cited evidence was 
an internal Chevron document, without evidence that it was distributed to other defendants, and does not in any event show 
""joint preplanning"" activity. "
317,85," Indeed, Tosco's projected price increase of 6 cpg for manufacturing accorded with the California Air Resources Board's 1997 
report that recovery of capital expenditures and increased operating costs translated into an increased cost of between 5 and 8 
cpg to produce CARB gas."
317,86," Plaintiffs cite as evidence of misinformation only the April 1996 statements by Texaco's Mr. Walz. He stated at a California Air 
Resources Board meeting that part of the upward pressure on prices was attributable to supply imbalances cause by refinery 
outages. Although the statement was certainly information, the only basis for asserting it was misinformation is Noll's opinion the 
refinery outages were not a cause of price increases. Noll's opinion, which conflicted with the state and federal findings (see fn. 
45, ante), is not a substitute for evidence."
317,87," In economic and antitrust terminology, an oligopoly is a market with a relatively limited number of sellers and a relatively 
fungible or standardized product. (See Reserve Supply v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas (7th Cir. 1992) 971 F.2d 37, 50.) "
319,88," HN48[
] It is also undisputed that collecting and using that information is legitimate conduct and cannot serve as a predicate 
for an inference of a price-fixing agreement to avoid summary judgment. The courts have uniformly recognized that competitors 
may and should be free to collect and use information about their competition in conducting their business ( Biljac, supra, 218 
Cal. App. 3d at pp. 1430-1433), and that consideration of their competitors' prices is an essential component of their own pricing 
decisions. ( Wallace v. Bank of Bartlett, supra, 55 F.3d at p. 1169.) To avoid chilling that legitimate business conduct, an 
inference of conspiracy will not be drawn to defeat summary judgment merely because a competitor's price information is found 
in the internal files of a defendant ( Stephen Jay Photography, Ltd. v. Olan Mills, Inc. (4th Cir. 1990) 903 F.2d 988, 996) or from 
evidence a defendant attempts to and succeeds in gathering information about his competitor's pricing policies. ( In re Babyfood 
Antitrust Litigation, supra, 166 F.3d at pp. 125-126.) Even the Petroleum Products court recognized that ""to allow an inference of 
agreement from such evidence, standing alone, would have the effect of deterring competitors from obtaining information about 
other companies' actual retail prices, even through legitimate means. We can think of few inferences that would have a more 
undesirable distorting effect on market conduct."" ( Petroleum Products, supra, 906 F.2d at p. 455.) "
320,89," For this reason, we reject plaintiffs' claim that Bloom's unrebutted testimony precludes summary judgment. Bloom's opinion 
asserted that there was no competitive justification for disseminating the detailed DTW and rack prices contained in these third 
party services, and that the only rational explanation for disseminating the information provided to OPIS, Lundberg and other 
media services was to signal the competition and facilitate collusive and coordinated pricing decisions. However, Bloom ignores 
the fact that defendants could not do business without telling the retailers and jobbers the detailed price information that Bloom 
claims should not have been revealed. ( Wallace v. Bank of Bartlett, supra, 55 F.3d at p. 1169, fn. 5 [a defendant must make 
public its prices to inform customers how much they will have to pay].) That these third parties chose to disclose the information, 
and defendants then considered it, is of no significance because neither evaluating other companies' prices (ibid.) nor labeling 
the conduct a ""signal"" ( E.I. Du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. F.T.C., supra, 729 F.2d at p. 139) converts lawful conduct into 
evidence of a price-fixing conspiracy."
320,90," For similar reasons, we conclude several other cases on which plaintiffs rely are inapplicable. In Container, supra, 393 U.S. 
333, the evidence showed (1) there were direct competitor-to-competitor exchanges of price information; (2) the exchange 
occurred pursuant to an industry-wide understanding or agreement, which itself constituted concerted action ( id. at p. 335); and 
(3) the type of information exchanged was customer-specific prices, which enabled price matching. ( Id. at pp. 336-337.) None of 
those facts are present here. In United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co. (1940) 310 U.S. 150, 84 L. Ed. 1129, 60 S. Ct. 811 and 
People v. National Association of Realtors (1981) 120 Cal. App. 3d 459, 174 Cal. Rptr. 728, there was direct evidence of an 
agreement to a program that restrained trade. Neither case involved ambiguous circumstantial evidence from which to infer the 
agreement. "
321,91," Plaintiffs also cite a statement by a defense expert that ""trade associations may be used as a conduit for [unlawful 
communications."" That falls short of the proof required. ( Biljac, supra, 218 Cal. App. 3d at p. 1431 [evidence of ""discussion[] 
without disclosing any agreement . . . does not bear further discussion""]; Alvord-Polk, Inc. v. F. Schumacher & Co., supra, 37 
F.3d at p. 1013.) "
322,92," Plaintiffs also argue the court erred in awarding costs to defendants. HN51[
] A prevailing party is entitled to costs ""except as otherwise expressly provided by statute."" (§ 1032, subd. (b).) Plaintiffs argue that because the Cartwright Act permits a plaintiff 
to recover ""reasonable attorneys' fees together with the costs of the suit"" (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 16750, subd. (a)) but does not 
authorize a similar award to a defendant, the latter statute creates the express exception to costs otherwise required under 
section 1032, subdivision (b). The identical argument, albeit arising under a different consumer protection statute, was rejected 
in Murillo v. Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc. (1998) 17 Cal. 4th 985, 953 P.2d 858. In Murillo, the court affirmed an award of costs to 
defendant because the court concluded a provision of the ""lemon law"" (Civ. Code, § 1790 et seq.) that mandated recovery of 
costs and attorney fees by the prevailing plaintiff-buyer but did not mention a prevailing defendant-seller was not an ""express"" 
exception to the general rule in section 1032, subdivision (b). ( Murillo, 17 Cal. 4th at pp. 989-991.) "
337,1," For a summary of the Bell breakup and the factual background of this case, see Discon, Inc. v. NYNEX Corp., 93 F.3d 1055 
(2d Cir. 1996), vacated, 525 U.S. 128 (1998)."
337,2," AT&T Technologies is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AT&T, and is the successor entity of the Western Electric Company, 
AT&T's former supply and manufacturing affiliate."
337,3," Discon filed a separate lawsuit against AT&T Technologies based on the same allegations, but this Court dismissed that suit in 
1992, and Discon neither appealed from that dismissal nor filed any amended complaint. Discon, Inc. v. AT&T Technologies, 
Decision and Order, 90-545A (W.D.N.Y. June 25, 1992). The Court subsequently issued an order declaring that the dismissal 
was with prejudice. Discon, Inc. v. AT&T Technologies, Order, 90-545A (W.D.N.Y. Aug. 6, 1992). Final judgment was entered in 
favor of AT&T Technologies and against Discon on August 6, 1992. "
340,4," The only case cited by Discon on market definition, Pepsico, Inc. v. The Coca-Cola Co., 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13440, 1998 
WL 547088 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 27, 1998), is inapposite, as it does not involve a proposed single-buyer market definition. In that 
case, the product market was defined in terms of sales of fountain-dispensed soft drinks distributed by foodservice distributors 
throughout the United States, not sales to any one particular buyer. See id. at *8."
340,5," See also Muenster Butane, Inc. v. Stewart Co., 651 F.2d 292, 295-96 (5th Cir. 1981) (plaintiff's ""fundamental mistake . . . has 
been to view the product market as confined to Zenith sets""); Futurevision Cable Sys. of Wiggins, Inc. v. Multivision Cable TV "
341,," Corp., 789 F. Supp. 760, 776 (S.D. Miss. 1992) (""a manufacturer's natural monopoly over its own product is not a basis for 
antitrust liability"")."
341,6," Among the regulatory proceedings that have been held to investigate the issues raised in this case, the New York Public 
Service Commission (""PSC"") conducted an audit leading to the publication of ""An Operational Audit Report on New York 
Telephone Company's Central Office Equipment Removal Effort"" (December 1989) (the ""PSC Audit Report""), which is cited and 
relied upon by Discon in the Second Amended Complaint. See Item 94, Exhibit B. The PSC Audit Report states that there were 
numerous other providers of removal services operating throughout the United States from 1984 to 1989, providing removal 
services to buyers other than NYNEX. PSC Audit Report at 73."
341,7," At oral argument, Discon's counsel suggested that discovery on the issue of market definition may be necessary before 
summary judgment is appropriate. Rule 56(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that the Court may deny a motion 
for summary judgment or order a continuance if it determines that further discovery is necessary. HN13[
] A party seeking to "
342,," invoke Rule 56(f), however, must file an affidavit explaining: (1) the nature of the uncompleted discovery (what facts are sought 
and how they are to be obtained); (2) how those facts are reasonably expected to create a genuine issue of material fact; (3) 
what efforts the affiant has made to obtain those facts; and (4) why those efforts were unsuccessful. See Burlington Coat 
Factory Warehouse Corp. v. Esprit de Corp., 769 F.2d 919, 926 (2d Cir. 1985). The failure to file such an affidavit under Rule 
56(f) is alone sufficient reason to reject a request that summary judgment be deferred to permit discovery. See id. at 926; see 
also Bankers Trust Co. of Ca., N.A. v. Battaglia, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15465, 1999 WL 782304, at *3 (W.D.N.Y. Aug. 23, 1999) 
(same). Here, Discon has not filed a Rule 56(f) affidavit. Thus, it cannot avoid summary judgment on the ground that it needs 
discovery. In addition, it makes no sense that Discon, a seller of removal services, would need discovery to identify buyers of 
removal services other than NYNEX."
342,8," As stated above, the PSC Audit Report states that there were numerous other providers of removal services operating 
throughout the United States from 1984 to 1989. "
343,9," Moreover, any such harm occurred in a market -- the telephone services (not removal services) market -- which is not even at 
issue in this case."
343,10," The Federal Communications Commission (""FCC""), being the proper regulatory authority to handle the activity of which Discon 
complains, already has conducted an independent regulatory proceeding and ordered rebates to be paid for violations of the 
Communications Act of 1934. See Discon, 93 F.3d at 1058 (citing FCC Order, 5 FCC Rcd 866). Pursuant to a Consent Decree, 
and without admitting wrongdoing or violations, NYT refunded over $ 35 million for ""unreasonable rates reflecting improper 
capital costs and expense charges."" See In re New York Telephone Co., 5 FCC Rcd 5892 (1990). "

356,1," Indirect purchasers refers to those individuals or entities that purchase products down the chain of distribution, and not directly 
from the manufacturer of a product. "
359,2," For example, distributor Alliant indicated that it had computer records only from 1998. To gather any other information beyond 
general summaries, Alliant would have to go through hundreds of boxes for each individual year. The purchasing invoices and 
customer invoices are boxed separately. Purchasing invoices are organized by month and customer invoices are organized by 
invoice number. In order to make any attempt to determine from where a customer received product, it would be necessary to 
examine each customer invoice and try to find a corresponding purchasing invoice. To locate the corresponding 
 [*19] purchasing invoice, someone from Alliant would have to compare the prices charged to a customer against the prices paid 
on the purchasing invoice. Even if Alliant could successfully locate the purchasing invoice upon which the customer's price was 
based, this would not guarantee that the product actually sent to the customer was necessarily from that lot. See David W. 
Simon Affidavit, sec. 3, Potter Dep. P. 93-96. "

judicial notice of the record in our companion case and in the underlying FERC proceedings. See McKinney v. Waterman 
Steamship Corp., 925 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1991)."
365,2," Norwood said in its second amended complaint that it extended the original contract for ten years to October 31, 2008, but then 
""elected to withdraw [the extension]""; in various later submissions to the district court it said that the extension was not effective. 
These claims of withdrawal or ineffectiveness were mentioned but not seriously developed in Norwood's brief, and we decline to 
address them.  Gamma Audio & Video, Inc. v. Ean-Chea, 11 F.3d 1106, 1113 (1st Cir. 1993)."
365,3," For Mass Electric, the rate goes from 3.2 cents per kilowatt hour in 1998 to 5.1 cents per kilowatt hour in 2004. The low starting 
point and rapid elevation were intended to give customers protection at the start but then to encourage their migration to the 
competitive market. "
367,4," The 1983 antitrust decree is enforceable in the district court, see generally In re Pearson, 990 F.2d 653, 657 (1st Cir. 1993), 
and a breach of the contract might amount to a breach of the decree. However, the decree itself did no more than adopt the 
settlement agreement and power contract; thus, if these commitments were not breached, neither was the decree. "
368,5," As explained in our companion decision, the doctrine has various facets. It is the broader limitation on civil litigation that is of 
concern here and not the narrower aspect discussed in our companion case. "

381,1, Ford does not move to dismiss the count for invasion of privacy at this time. 
383,2," The Court recognizes that antitrust injury and antitrust standing are often confused. As the court in Baum Research and 
Development Co., Inc., et. al. v. Hillerich & Bradsby Co., Inc. et. al., 31 F. Supp. 2d 1016 (E.D. Mich. 1998) explained: This confusion occurs because the two concepts ""share a common ingredient."" The common ingredient is that both 
requirements limit ""recovery to those who have been injured by restraint on competitive forces in the economy."" Any inquiry 
to determine whether antitrust injury has been shown is more limited than one to determine whether the plaintiff has 
standing. The single determinant of antitrust injury is whether the plaintiff has suffered an ""injury the type the antitrust laws 
were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes [a defendant's] act[] unlawful."" On the other hand, even if an 
antitrust injury is shown sufficiently, standing may be denied on the basis of other factors. The purpose of the additional 
inquiries is to confine recovery to cases that promote the congressional intent to ensure that consumers receive the 
benefits of competitive markets. Id. at 1021, n.6, citing Axis S.p.A. v. Micafil, Inc., 870 F.2d 1105, 1110-11 (6th Cir. 1989)(citations omitted). "
384,3," There are narrow two exceptions to the indirect purchaser doctrine: (1) cases involving ""cost-plus"" contracts and (2) cases

S. Ct. 2061 and n.16. Neither exception is pled or argued here. "
386,4," These same concerns also affect the final two prongs of the test, i.e. the causal connection between the plaintiff's injury and 
whether the injury was intended; and the nature of the injury and the status of the plaintiff, discussed infra."
386,5," The United States Supreme Court has compared refusal-to-compete agreements with price-fixing agreements. See Federal 
Trade Commission v. Indiana Federation of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445, 106 S. Ct. 2009 (1986)(""A refusal to 
compete with respect to the package of services offered to customers, no less than a refusal to compete with respect to the price 
term of an agreement, impairs the ability of the market to advance social welfare by ensuring the provision of desired goods and 
services to consumers at a price approximating the marginal cost of providing them."" Id. at 459.) "
387,6," Compare Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready, 457 U.S. 465, 73 L. Ed. 2d 149, 102 S. Ct. 2540 (1982)(finding standing where

395,1," These Defendants include the Fiscal Courts of Grayson, Oldham, Bullitt, Lame, Franklin and Jefferson Counties in Kentucky."
395,2," These defendants include Invision Telecom, Inc.; MCI Telecommunications Corp.; LDDS WorldCom d/b/a Worldcom, Inc.; 
Gateway Technologies, Inc. and Security Telecom Corporation."
395,3," Previously, this Court has considered other claims and defenses in this case. By Memorandum Opinion dated October 8, 1999, 
the Court dismissed the Missouri, Indiana and Arizona state government defendants due to the absence of personal jurisdiction. 
By Memorandum Opinion dated October 12, 1999, the Court dismissed the Commonwealth of Kentucky defendants based upon 
their Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity. The following day the Court dismissed all Robinson-Patman Act claims. Finally, 
by Memorandum Opinion dated November 8, 1999, the Court dismissed all monetary claims against the Fiscal Court 
Defendants under the Sherman Act based on the local government Anti-Trust Act. Consequently, under the Sherman Act only 
injunction relief remains against the Fiscal Courts. However, in that opinion this Court held that the state action immunity 
doctrine did not bar Sherman Act claims. The Court reached this result by concluding, among other things, that the general state 
government authorization of Fiscal Courts to operate jails did not foreseeably result in the suppression of competition for 
telephone service."
395,4," If the case proceeds, Defendants would challenge many of these ""facts,"" but for purposes of the motion to dismiss, the Court 
must view the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs. "
396,5," Prior to this litigation, that surcharge was $ 3.00 per call. The Kentucky Public Service Commission (the ""PSC"") has since 
reduced the surcharge to $ 1.50."
396,6," KRS Chapter 278 grants the PSC exclusive jurisdiction over public utility rates in the state. See Carr v. Cincinnati Bell, Inc., 651 
S.W.2d 126, 127 (Ky. Ct. App. 1983)."
396,7," Pending approval with the PSC, after five months, Telephone Companies may enact a rate change on a temporary basis if 
certain conditions are satisfied. Sometimes, Telephone Companies seek approval for a range of rates, referred to as a ""band"". 
Telephone Companies may also state that the surcharge assessed will follow the local exchange carriers's tariff, rather than 
stating a specific amount. In either instance, Telephone Companies are then free to charge any amount falling within the 
designated spectrum."
396,8," A brief history of PSC Orders dealing with confinement facilities: In January 1992 Administrative Case No. 337 exempted 
confinement facilities from the rules that apply to other facilities with payphones. The Order stated, ""Inmate phone service will 
only provide automated collect or debit card service for local and long-distance calls from payphones located at correctional or 
mental health facilities in accordance with institutionally authorized telephone program."" In response to complaints of Plaintiffs, the PSC began reviewing the reasonableness of inmate telephone rates in November 
1997. After a public hearing and reviewing both sides' briefs, on January 15, 1999 in Administrative Case No. 368: Rates, Terms 
and Conditions for Inmate Telecommunications Services, the PSC ordered all Telephone Companies to reduce their operator 
surcharge for inmates to a surcharge that was no higher than the surcharge paid by the general public for any other collect call. 
The order also initiated Administrative Case No. 378: Establishment of an Operator Surcharge Rate for Collect Calls from 
Confinement Facilities and Administrative Case No. 379: Obligations of Inmate Service Providers to Call Recipients Regarding 
Notice of Blocking and Billing Procedures and required that all inmates service providers identify themselves on a recording that 
call recipients hear and disclose how the consumer may obtain rates in accordance with FCC requirements no later than March 
1, 1999. "
397,," After rehearing on Case No. 378, in July of 1999, the PSC ordered that all surcharges on inmate calls originating from 
confinement facilities not exceed $ 1.50 per call (a reduction from the $ 3.00 previously charged and lower than the surcharge 
applied to the general public), effective November 15, 1999 or at the expiration of existing contracts. The order also stipulated 
that no set-use fees could be assessed against inmate calls and capped intraLATA and interLATA toll charges on inmate calls at 
July 1, 1999 rates, allowing increase only upon good cause shown. Case No. 378 was reheard again in August 1999. In that Order, the PSC granted rehearing on the appropriate cap on toll rates. 
Until a final decision is reached, carriers may charge up to $ 0.28 for interLATA inmate calls and $ 0.23 for intraLATA inmate 
calls, effective November 15, 1999 or at contract expiration but at least by June 30, 2000. The surcharge reductions ordered in 
the July 1, 1999 opinion must also take effect prior to June 30, 2000."
397,9," One reason that Plaintiffs may not have sought relief from the FCC is that the FCC has already granted some relief similar to 
what Plaintiffs obtained from the PSC and has expressly rejected other relief Plaintiffs might seek. Specifically, the FCC 
mandated oral disclosure requirements for interstate collect calls initiated by prison inmates but rejected a billed party preference 
system and setting inmate tariff rate caps. See 63 FR 11612; 47 CFR § 64.710."
397,10," HN5[
] The doctrine of primary jurisdiction counsels that a court having original jurisdiction over the case should stay the 
proceedings or order dismissal pending the determination of one or more issues by the regulatory agency. See Reiter v. Cooper, 
507 U.S. 258, 113 S. Ct. 1213, 1220, 122 L. Ed. 2d 604 (1993). Courts should defer to the appropriate regulatory authorities on 
issues falling within their particular zones of expertise. Id. The Court stayed this action to allow the PSC to address complaints about the rates Telephone Companies charge recipients of 
inmate collect calls. The PSC has now acted. In some areas the PSC, at least, is without power. It cannot, for instance, 
determine the legality of certain contractual relationships at issue. The Court, where possible, should address the remaining 
legal issues. In this opinion at least, the Court can do so without encroaching on regulatory authority."
397,11," Ironically, some of the Fiscal Courts only participated in the contracts negotiated by the state Department of Corrections, an 
immune body, pursuant to the Kentucky Model Procurement Code. See KRS 45A.050(4). "
398,12," Some trace the doctrine even further back to Texas & Pacific Railway v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., 204 U.S. 426, 27 S. Ct. 350, 
51 L. Ed. 553 (1907)."
398,13," Plaintiffs echo these criticisms. See Square D. Co. v. Niagara Frontier Tariff Bureau, 760 F.2d 1347 92d (1985) (Judge 
Friendly follows Keogh but criticizes the logic of the decision), Square D. Co. v. Niagara Tariff Bureau, 476 U.S. 409, 90 L. Ed. 
2d 413, 106 S. Ct. 1922 (1986) (stating that Keogh may have been ""unwise as a matter of policy"" but reaffirming it because 
Congress had not overturned it despite the opportunity)."
398,14," However, the FCC mirrors the ICC in that it is authorized to award damages or other relief as necessary."
398,15," Whether the filed rate doctrine applies to state agencies that lack the ability to provide damages appears to be an issue of first 
impression in the Sixth Circuit. The Eleventh Circuit has held that the filed rate doctrine continues to apply, arguing that state 
regulatory agencies have the power to set prospective rates abnormally low to compensate customers for excessive rates in the 
past. See Taffet v. Southern Co., 967 F.2d 1483, 1492 (11th Cir. 1992) (en banc). The Eleventh Circuit reasoned that this 
method of repayment would be less expensive to administer than an actual damages award anyway, and that lower set rates 
ensure that the cost of the penalty is not home by the customers themselves."
398,16," Circuits that have considered the question have found that class actions do not prevent the application of the filed rate 
doctrine. See Wegoland Ltd. v. Nynex Corp., 27 F.3d 17 (2d. Cir. 1994); Marcus v. AT&T Corp., 138 F.3d 46 (2d. Cir. 1998); and 
Hi Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 954 F.2d 485 (8th Cir. 1992)."
398,17," The Eighth Circuit was not persuaded that this neutralized the filed rate doctrine. In H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone 
Co., 954 F.2d 485 (8th Cir. 1992), customers brought a RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations) claim against 
the telephone company for having bribed the Public Utility Commission to approve its rates. While the case was pending, a new 
commission reconsidered the rates and lowered them. The Commission lacked authority to order refunds. Nevertheless, citing 
the filed rate doctrine, the Eighth Circuit dismissed the customer's RICO claims. H.J. is different from our case, however, in that 
the plaintiffs received a state court settlement of $ 32 million."
398,18," However this does not lessen the difficulty or impossibility of determining the appropriate competitive rate in an admittedly 
regulated market. "
399,19," Plaintiffs argue that the Telephone Companies rates were never subjected to meaningful agency review. The Court will 
assume this to be true. Even so, the filed rate doctrine retains a sound basis. It applies to all duly submitted, lawful rates 
regardless of the extent of the regulatory agency's inquiry into the appropriateness of those rates. See Square D, 476 U.S. at 
417, 417 n. 19 (dismissing as unimportant the lack of formal hearing prior to rate approval)."
399,20," To the extent that Plaintiffs attack the restrictions on service rather than the cost, this effort fails. Jails have the authority to 
govern how and when inmates will use the phones as long as these restrictions do not interfere with other constitutional rights. "
400,21," Incidentally, it is probably not in the Plaintiffs' interest to argue that the recipients of inmate initiated calls should be treated the 
same way as the recipients of non-inmate initiated calls since the PSC's July 1, 1999 order capped the surcharge on inmate 
initiated calls at $ 1.50 per call, far below the non-inmate surcharge. "
401,22," Because the Court is dismissing Plaintiffs' § 1983 claim, the Court sees no need to address Defendant's Johnson Act 
arguments at this time."
401,23," HN11[
] In order to prove an anti-trust violation under 15 U.S.C. § 1, Plaintiffs must establish: (1) a contract, combination or conspiracy among two or more separate entities, that (2) unreasonably restrains trade, and (3) affects interstate commerce or 
foreign commerce."
401,24," If the Telephone Companies had not charged inflated rates, they would not have been able to provide large enough 
commissions to the Fiscal Courts to win the contracts. "
402,25," Defendants have also argued that Plaintiffs' product and market are too ill-defined. The product, inmate initiated collect calls, 
appears quite certain. Plaintiffs' market is more vague. Plaintiffs claim that the geographic market is the entire United States 
because inmates place calls to recipients all over the country. The geographic market, however, is usually defined by the area in 
which consumers can be reasonably expected to seek substitute goods, not by the area possibly impacted by the anti-trust 
violation. See United States v. Philadelphia Nat'l Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 359, 10 L. Ed. 2d 915, 83 S. Ct. 1715 (1963). Inmates 
cannot seek phone service outside their jail. Thus, the appropriate geographic market for Plaintiffs' claim, if any exists, is each 
individual jail."
402,26," Technically, Plaintiffs consider recipients of inmate-initiated calls and not the inmates themselves the consumers. The Court 
does not challenge this position but rather focuses on the inmates because the inmates' options determine the recipients 
options. Recipients cannot place calls to inmates. Inmates must initiate collect calls to recipients."
402,27," Defendants argue that the competitive bidding process for the exclusive contracts indicates that each telephone company 
lacks market power. Plaintiffs counter that this commission driven ""competition"" only hurts the consumer by driving the price of 
phone calls higher."
402,28," While the fact that Defendants' conduct was monitored by the PSC may mean that Plaintiffs are incorrect that Defendants 
have the ""unfettered ability to raise prices"", monitoring rate caps does not necessarily preclude Defendants from having the 
ability to raise prices above those that would be charged in a competitive market. For instance, assume the maximum rate 
approved by the PSC is $ 2.50 for operator assisted calls. If a service provider charges $ 2.50 because of its exclusive "
403,," commissioned contract over the inmates, when it would charge $ 1.25 in a competitive market, then the provider arguably has 
market power. "
413,1," See Piggly Wiggly's Amended and Consolidated Complaint (hereinafter ""Pls.' Compl."") at 6. "
414,2," See Piggly Wiggly's Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant Interstate Brands Corporation's Motion for Summary Judgment 
(hereinafter ""Pls.' Memo."") at 3 n.3."
414,3, 15 U.S.C. § 1
414,4," Pls.' Compl. at 6. Interstate's summary judgment motion characterizes Piggly Wiggly's claim as asserting that the relevant 
geographic market also encompassed parts of Arkansas and Oklahoma. See Interstate's Motion for Summary Judgment 
(hereinafter ""Dft.'s Motion"") at 2. Its view is apparently based on the fact that Piggly Wiggly's Proposed Final Pretrial Order 
includes those two states in its statement of the nature of its case. See Affidavit of Jerry L. Beane (hereinafter ""Beane Aff."") 
attached to Dft.'s Motion, Ex. 3 at 3-4. Yet, the only live pleading before the court in this case is Piggly Wiggly's Amended and 
Consolidated Complaint, which makes no reference to Arkansas or Oklahoma. See Beane Aff., Ex 4. To be sure, HN1[
] Rule"
414,16," of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a joint final pretrial order that has been entered by the court ""control[s] 
the subsequent course of the action unless modified by subsequent order."" As succinctly stated by another judge in this District, 
""the pretrial order supersedes all prior pleadings, serving, in effect, as the operative answer and complaint in the case."" United 
States v. Texas, 523 F. Supp. 703, 720 (E.D. Tex. 1981) (Justice, J.) (citing Morales v. Turman, 535 F.2d 864, 867 n.7 (5th Cir. 
1976), rev'd on other grounds, 430 U.S. 322, 51 L. Ed. 2d 368, 97 S. Ct. 1189 (1977)). See also F.D.I.C. v. Mijalis, 15 F.3d 
1314, 1325 (5th Cir. 1994); Syrie v. Knoll Int'l, 748 F.2d 304, 308 (5th Cir. 1984); Pacific Indem. Co. v. Broward County, 465 
F.2d 99, 103 (5th Cir. 1972). But Piggly Wiggly's Proposed Final Pretrial Order has not been ""entered"" by this court, nor is it a 
""joint"" order reflecting the agreement of the parties. That document thus cannot be said to supersede the Amended and 
Consolidated Complaint. Because Piggly Wiggly's live pleading does not assert any claims relating to Arkansas or Oklahoma, 
therefore, the court will limit its analysis to the matters actually pled."
414,5," Piggly Wiggly's complaint does not actually designate a specific concluding date for the alleged antitrust conspiracy. However, 
in correspondence sent to the court following a hearing on Piggly Wiggly's motion for class certification, the court was informed 
that Piggly Wiggly intended to designate March 31, 1993, as the ending date in order to ""comport with the evidence."" Beane Aff., 
Ex 2. The court also notes that Piggly Wiggly has made no effort to dispute Interstate's view, set out in its summary judgment 
motion, that the relevant period extends only through March 31, 1993. It is, perhaps, also telling that the same date was used as 
the concluding date in the parallel state case."
414,6," See Tucker, et al. v. Interstate Brands Corporation, et al., No. 249-18-97, filed January 27, 1997 (Bridewell, J.)."

products from Interstate in Louisiana, not Texas. See Pls.' Memo. at 19 & 31. Taking that factual assertion to be true for 
purposes of the instant motion, Staggers would not have been considered a member of the Tucker Class, which included only

first time on summary judgment) that Counterclaim Defendants conspired to enforce patents known to be invalid and obtained

discrimination impacts competition among the seller's purchasers, i.e., there are favored and disfavored purchasers. Tertiary-line 
price discrimination occurs when a seller's price discrimination harms competition between customers of the favored and 
disfavored purchasers, even though the favored and disfavored purchaser do not compete directly against one another. See

U.S.C. § 158(b)(4)(A) and (B). The NLRB dismissed the charge, and its Office of Appeals affirmed the dismissal. "
467,3," The only issue before us is whether the district court had jurisdiction to enjoin the threatened picketing. We do not reach the 
question whether the antitrust laws are implicated. "

organization over racial discrimination in hiring is a labor dispute)."
469,7," At oral argument, counsel for Local 174 stated that the union representing Parsec's employees is not affiliated with the AFL-
CIO and that Local 174 has filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board, contending that Parsec has unlawfully 
recognized a company union in violation of 29 U.S.C. § 158(a)(2)."
469,8," It is widely recognized among scholars, practitioners, and policy-makers that client companies, such as Burlington Northern, 
are able to frustrate the efforts of employees to improve their wages and working conditions through collective bargaining by 
subcontracting work to third-party contractors. See, e.g., Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations, Report 
and Recommendations (December 1994) (established by the United States Departments of Labor and Commerce) (stating that 
contingent workers, a category that includes employees of subcontractors, often receive lower pay and benefits than traditional 
workers and are less likely to benefit from labor and employment law protections); Craig Becker, Labor Law Outside the 
Employment Relation, 74 Tex. L. Rev. 1527, 1532-35 (1996) (stating that subcontracting ""enables the client company to create a 
virtually continuous bidding process . . . [that] exerts constant downward pressure on the wages of subcontractors' employees"" 
and to ""thwart workers' efforts to achieve labor representation, secure binding contracts, and reap the benefits of informal 
commitments made by employers""); Jonathan P. Hiatt, Policy Issues Concerning the Contingent Workforce, 52 Wash. & Lee L. 
Rev. 739, 745 (1995) (describing how subcontracting agreements impede employees' attempts to bargain collectively); Jonathan 
P. Hiatt and Lee W. Jackson, Policy Issues Concerning the Contingent Workforce, 12 Lab. Law. 165, 178-79 (1996) (discussing 
how the National Labor Relations Act might be reformed to enable employees of subcontractors to engage in effective collective 
bargaining); Jennifer Middleton, Contingent Workers in a Changing Economy: Endure, Adapt, or Organize?, 22 N.Y.U. Rev. L. & 
Soc. Change 557, 595-96 (1996) (describing how client companies use the process of competitive bidding to control wage and 
benefit levels); Walter V. Siebert and N. Dawn Webber, Joint Employer, Single Employer, and Alter Ego, 3 Lab. Law. 873 (Fall

1, 2 (1996) (asserting that contingent employees earn lower wages and benefits and have less job security than permanent 
employees); cf. Stephen F. Belfort, Labor Law and the Double-Breasted Employer: A Critique of the Single Employer and the "
470,," Alter Ego Doctrine and a Proposed Reformulation, 1987 Wis. L. Rev. 67 (1987) (explaining how the practice of double-breasting 
enables employers to divert work to the nonunion sector and to pressure unionized workers to grant wage concessions)."
470,9," The question whether the secondary boycott violates federal labor law is not before us. See 29 U.S.C. § 160(j) (giving federal 
courts jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief to restrain unfair labor practices only in cases brought by the National Labor Relations 
Board)."
470,10," What distinguishes this case from Milk Wagon Drivers' Union is that Local 174 has disavowed any interest in representing the 
Parsec employees, presumably because another union already represents them. However, HN8[
] Norris-LaGuardia 
encompasses a dispute between a union and an employer in which the union does not represent or seek to represent the 
employees. See Marine Cooks, 362 U.S. at 370 (union picketed foreign ship that paid substandard wages to foreign workers); 
New Negro Alliance, 303 U.S. at 560-61 (discussed in detail above); Federal Express Corp. v. Teamster Local 85, 617 F.2d 524 
(9th Cir. 1980) (holding that ""the provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act plainly apply even if the union does not purport to 
represent any employees""). While Local 174 disclaims any interest in representing the present Parsec employees, Local 174 
does wish to continue representing the employees of other current subcontractors and to represent the employees of any 
subcontractors to whom Burlington Northern transfers work in the future. Moreover, even if Local 174 did seek to represent the 
Parsec employees, Local 174 and Burlington Northern would still be engaged in a labor dispute. See Hutcheson, 312 U.S. at 
234-35; Milk Wagon Drivers' Union, 311 U.S. at 99. "
471,11," Although the Court in Milk Wagon Drivers' Union did not decide whether the vendors were independent contractors, the facts 
suggest that they were. The vendors owned their own trucks, paid their own expenses, and earned a commission based on the 
amount of milk sold. See 311 U.S. at 126 n.11."
471,12," Burlington Northern attempts to distinguish Milk Wagon Drivers' Union on the ground that Local 174 has not developed a 
record showing that Parsec employees earn lower wages and benefits than are provided for under Local 174's collective 
bargaining agreement. This distinction is irrelevant. Local 174's dispute with Burlington Northern would still be a labor dispute 
even if Parsec paid equivalent or higher wages and benefits than Local 174 has achieved in its contract. Unions serve not only 
to obtain immediate improvements in wages and benefits, but also to provide job security to their members and to protect 
against wage and benefit deterioration in the future. Thus, Burlington Northern's position - that a union can have no legitimate 
interest, as a labor union, in challenging a client company's subcontracting decision unless that decision has caused an 
immediate decline in wages and benefits - is incorrect. Similarly, Burlington Northern insists that what Local 174 really wants is an anticompetitive lock on the jobs at Burlington 
Northern's Seattle hub. It argues that the agreement that it demanded from Burlington Northern would be unlawful under Connell 
Construction Co. v. Plumbers & Steamfitters Local Union No. 100, 421 U.S. 616, 44 L. Ed. 2d 418, 95 S. Ct. 1830 (1974). 
Burlington Northern's reliance on Connell is misplaced, but revealing. Boiled down, Burlington Northern's argument is that 
Norris-LaGuardia does not apply because Local 174 demanded that Burlington Northern sign an agreement that would violate 
antitrust law. This argument lacks merit because HN9[
] the Norris-LaGuardia Act bars injunctive relief in labor disputes even 
when the union's actions violate the antitrust laws. See Bhd. of Maintenance Way Employees, 481 U.S. at 429 n.3; Order of R.R. 
Telegraphers, 362 U.S. at 341 n.15; Milk Wagon Drivers' Union, 311 U.S. at 103. "

Judgment On Plaintiff's Antitrust Claims (Doc. # 746) filed April 19, 1999. ""Stat. of Lim. SOF P"" will refer to factual statements by 
CCS and Xerox in briefing on Xerox Corporation's Motion For Summary Judgment On Plaintiff's Antitrust Claims Barred By The 
Statute Of Limitations (Doc. # 742) filed April 19, 1999. ""State Claims SOF P"" will refer to factual statements by CCS and Xerox 
in briefing on Xerox's Motion For Summary Judgment On Plaintiff's State Law Claims For ""Defamation And Trade 
Disparagement"" And Tortious Interference With Contract (Doc. # 740) filed April 19, 1999. The Court has included several 
factual statements from the briefing on plaintiff's antitrust claims in this section for background purposes only. "
492,2," This argument assumes, incorrectly, that the employees were employed by Jones and Davis rather than by Aetna Insurance 
and the State of Connecticut. "
493,3," Because CCS has not shown that the Murphy letter is defamatory on its face, CCS cannot invoke the theory of slander per se. 
See Lyons v. Heid, 1998 Conn. Super. LEXIS 1516, 1998 WL 309797, at *6 (Conn. Super. Ct. May 29, 1998). In addition, the 
internal publication of the Murphy letter also may be privileged as a communication between individuals with a common interest 
in a particular subject matter. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 596; Torosyan, 662 A.2d at 103. "
494,4," CCS also cites an internal Xerox memorandum titled ""Current Status Of Major ISOs"" which states that CCS ""leverages minority 
ownership."" See State Claims SOF P 33. CCS has not shown that the statement was false or caused any injury to it. Indeed, the 
memorandum suggests that Xerox used the information internally and did not intend to use it as a marketing tool."
494,5," CCS argues that Xerox also interfered with other contracts. The tortious interference claim, however, is solely based upon the 
contract between CCS and the State of Connecticut. See Amended Complaint (Doc. # 246) PP 98-102. CCS has not sought 
leave to amend. Accordingly, the Court will not consider evidence of alleged interference with other contracts. "
495,6," CCS also alleges that Xerox instituted various policies and actions in an ""effort to force"" customers to accept Xerox as the 
provider for both parts and service. CCS alleges that this conduct constitutes an unlawful tying arrangement in violation of 
Section 2 of the Sherman Act. See Amended Complaint (Doc. # 246) PP 1, 83, 90. As an initial matter, the Court notes that the 
amended complaint does not allege the requisite elements of a tying claim. The Court therefore does not construe the tying 
claim as an independent claim for relief, but rather a subset of the claim that Xerox monopolized or attempted to monopolize the 
relevant parts and service markets in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act.HN9[
] Tying claims generally are brought under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and the elements of a tying claim under either Section 1 
or 2 of the Sherman Act include: (1) an agreement by a party to sell one product but only on the condition that the buyer also purchases a different (or tied) 
product [or service], or at least agrees that he will not purchase that product [or service] from any other supplier; (2) the seller has ""appreciable economic power"" in the tying product market to compel acceptance of the tied product; and (3) the arrangement affects a substantial volume of commerce in the tied market. Kodak, 504 U.S. 451 at 462, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265; see Systemcare, Inc. v. Wang Labs. Corp., 117 F.3d 1137, 
1143 n.2 (10th Cir. 1997). Because the amended complaint does not allege an actionable tying claim, the Court grants summary 
judgment in favor of Xerox on that issue. Xerox also argues that CCS has not shown that Xerox conditioned its sale of parts on the purchase of service. CCS responds 
that its claim is cognizable under the Supreme Court decision in Kodak. In Kodak the Supreme Court noted that a fundamental 
element of a tying claim is a conditioned sale, i.e. ""an agreement by a party to sell one product but only on the condition that the 
buyer also purchases a different (or tied) product, or at least agrees that he will not purchase that product from any other 
supplier."" Kodak, 504 U.S. at 461 (quoting Northern Pacific R.R. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5-6, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545, 78 S. Ct. 
514 (1958)). In Kodak, plaintiffs alleged that Kodak sold parts to third parties only ""on condition"" that they also buy service from 
Kodak. See 504 U.S. at 463 n.8. Here, CCS does not allege that Xerox expressly conditioned its sale of parts on a customer's 
purchase of service from Xerox or a customer's promise not to purchase service from ISOs. Indeed, at least three customers 
purchased parts from Xerox for copiers while CCS provided service on those copiers. See Antitrust SOF P 6. Thus the Kodak 
decision does not support the CCS tying claim. Although most tying claims consist of an express agreement, an alleged tying arrangement may be premised on a defendant's 
policy which makes the purchase of the tying and tied product together ""the only viable economic option."" Amerinet, Inc. v. Xerox 
Corp., 972 F.2d 1483, 1500 (8th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 1080, 122 L. Ed. 2d 356, 113 S. Ct. 1048 (1993); Nobel 
Scientific Indus., Inc. v. Beckman Instruments, Inc., 670 F. Supp. 1313, 1324 (D. Md. 1986); Ways and Means, Inc. v. IVAC 
Corp., 506 F. Supp. 697, 701 (N.D. Cal. 1979)), aff'd, 831 F.2d 537 (4th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 487 U.S. 1226 (1988). Other 
courts have found that an implicit tying arrangement ""may be inferred from evidence indicating that the supplier has actually 
coerced the purchase or non-purchase of another product."" Data General, 36 F.3d 1147 at 1180. CCS has not offered any 
evidence, or legal argument, to support the finding of an implicit tying arrangement. In particular, CCS has not identified any 
customers that were actually coerced by Xerox to purchase both parts and service. For these reasons, the Court sustains the Xerox motion for summary judgment on the CCS tying claim. "
496,7," The ""10 series"" copiers include models 1065, 1075 and 1090. "
499,8," CCS maintains that in 1990, the Canadian Competition Tribunal determined that Xerox improperly excluded competition in the 
parts market by its concerted refusal with its affiliates in Canada and Europe to sell parts to third party vendors. The Canadian 
Competition Tribunal decision is not relevant here, however, because it was based on Canadian law. See Order of Competition 
Tribunal dated Nov. 2, 1990, at 51 n.47 (""Unlike the Competition Act the concept of refusal to supply in both U.S. law and EEC 
law operates within the framework of provisions preventing abuse of dominant position or monopolization and tied selling and 
other vertical restraints.""), attached as Exhibit 22 to CCS Consolidated Appendix. Moreover, the decision does not support the 
CCS claim of Xerox monopolization of the parts market. See id. at 80 (Xerox policies designed to eliminate competition in 
service market). "
500,9," CCS also alleges that Xerox unlawfully monopolized the parts and service markets for Xerox printers. CCS, however, has 
never serviced or attempted to service Xerox printers. Furthermore, CCS has never attempted to buy parts for Xerox printers. 
See Antitrust SOF P 16. Thus the Court sustains the Xerox motion for summary judgment with respect to this claim."
500,10," In their briefs on the CCS antitrust claims, neither party addresses whether the refusal to license or sell copyrighted materials 
would violate antitrust law. Thus the Court does not address that issue. "
503,11," CCS asks the Court to strike the Declaration of John Jandrokovic, which is attached as Exhibit 2 to Xerox Corporation's Reply 
Memorandum In Support Of Its Motion For Summary Judgment On Plaintiff's Antitrust Claims (Doc. # 779) filed June 15, 1999. 
See Motion By Creative Copier Service To Deem Admitted Matters Pursuant To Local Rule 56.1 And The Order Of April 21, 
1999, And To Strike Matters From Xerox Reply Memoranda (Doc. # 784) filed June 28, 1999. In his declaration, Jandrokovic 
emphasizes the importance of patented photoreceptors, fuser rolls and dicorotrons in the service of 1075 and 1090 model 
copiers. He states that these three patented parts account for approximately 14 per cent of all parts used to service the copiers 
and approximately 30 per cent of the total cost of servicing the copiers. CCS objects to the declaration because Jandrokovic has 
never been identified as a witness, he does not specifically identify the data on which he bases his declaration, he does not 
identify the procedure by which the data was collected, and he does not explain how or why the same information would apply to 
CCS. Xerox has not demonstrated that it identified Jandrokovic prior to its reply brief in this case. Moreover, the declaration 
should have been submitted with Xerox's motion for summary judgment to establish that patented parts are a significant factor in "
504,," estimating CCS damages. The declaration also does not address many key issues such as the time period involved and how the 
Xerox information can be extrapolated to CCS. For these reasons, the Court will strike the declaration. Although the Court 
strikes the declaration, the Court notes that other record evidence (including the expert report of Mackie-Mason) establishes the 
importance of CCS access to Xerox manufactured patented parts such as photoreceptors."
504,12," Xerox submitted these invoices as Exhibit 1 to Xerox Corporation's Reply Memorandum in Support Of Its Motion For Summary 
Judgment On Plaintiff's Antitrust Claims (Doc. # 779) filed June 15, 1999. CCS asks the Court to consider the invoices as 
samples, and not as a representation of its overall purchase patterns. See Memorandum In Support Of Motion By Creative 
Copier Service To Deem Admitted Matters Pursuant To Local Rule 56.1 And The Order Of April 21, 1999, And To Strike Matters 
From Xerox Reply Memoranda (Doc. # 784) filed June 28, 1999. Even as samples, however, the invoices illustrate that CCS 
relied in part on Xerox to provide patented parts. "
505,13," Xerox requested CCS to identify each part (by name and number) for Xerox copiers that CCS alleged that it was not able to 
obtain from any source other than Xerox. See Xerox Corporation's First Set Of Interrogatories at 5, attached as Exhibit 14 to 
Xerox Corporation's Memorandum In Support Of Motion For Summary Judgment On Plaintiff's Antitrust Claims (Doc. # 747) filed 
April 19, 1999. CCS responded that it purchased parts from Xerox only when those parts were unavailable from all other known 
sources. See id. CCS also referred Xerox to a number of invoices which indicate that CCS purchased parts from Xerox. In fact, 
on at least 55 occasions between February 1989 and October 1990, Cigna ordered patented photoreceptors, fuser rolls and 
dicorotrons from Xerox so that CCS could service copiers at Cigna offices. See Exhibit 1 to Xerox Corporation's Reply 
Memorandum In Support Of Motion For Summary Judgment On Plaintiff's Antitrust Claims (Doc. # 779) filed June 15, 1999."
505,14," Mackie-Mason takes the position that Xerox restrictions on the sale of patented parts caused injury to CCS, while Dixon claims 
that ""the problem was not in obtaining the above [patented] parts, but rather obtaining all of the other parts we needed to repair 
the machines on an emergency basis, which were available only from Xerox."" To the extent that these claims are in conflict, 
Dixon's declaration does not explain why, if photoreceptor belts, heat rollers and dicorotrons were available from third party 
supply houses and heat rollers and dicorotrons could be repaired, CCS could not satisfy its demand for patented Xerox products 
from such sources. Nor does he purport to answer the obvious question why, if a restriction on the sale of unpatented parts was 
the problem, the marketplace did not respond by developing substitute sources for such parts as when ""a company figured out 
how to cut and configure the Kodak 'blue belt' photoreceptor material so that it would work in a Xerox 1075/1090 machine, and a 
supply of these became available."" On this record, the Court finds that no reasonable fact finder would conclude from Dixon's 
testimony that ""if Xerox had only restricted its handful of 'patented' parts, [CCS] could have worked around this."" "
506,15," The Court need not consider the ""impossibility"" exception to the disaggregation rule. See, e.g., Spray-Rite Serv. Corp. v. 
Monsanto Co., 684 F.2d 1226, 1243 (7th Cir. 1992), aff'd, 465 U.S. 752, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775, 104 S. Ct. 1464 (1984); Litton Sys., 
Inc. v. Honeywell, Inc., 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14662, 1996 WL 634213, at *2 (C.D. Cal. July 24, 1996). CCS has not asserted 
that its experts could not disaggregate damages, only that they are not required to do so. Indeed, CCS expert Mackie-Mason 
testified that in his view, the impact of CCS' inability to obtain solely unpatented parts could be measured. See Mackie-Mason 
Depo. at 197-98."
506,16," The Court sustained the Xerox motion for summary judgment on plaintiff's other state law defamation claims. See supra text, 
part I. B. "
507,17, The Court also notes that CCS has an independent remedy for this conduct under state law.
507,18," Given that the Court sustains the Xerox motion for summary judgment on plaintiff's antitrust claims on the above grounds, it 
need not reach the issues of plaintiff's alleged failure to mitigate its damages or the timeliness of plaintiff's antitrust claims. See 
Xerox Corporation's Memorandum in Support Of Motion For Summary Judgment On Plaintiff's Antitrust Claims (Doc. # 747) filed 
April 19, 1999, at 31-34; Xerox Corporation's Motion For Summary Judgment On Plaintiff's Antitrust Claims Barred By The 
Statute Of Limitations (Doc. # 742) filed April 19, 1999. "
508,19," CCS also noted that only parts used in 1075 and 1090 copiers were ""relevant to Creative Copier's current (from November 
1994 to the present) copier servicing contracts."" Id. "
510,20," While White involved sanctions under Rule 11, its principles apply equally to sanctions under Rules 26 and 37. See Law v. 
National Collegiate Athletic Ass'n, 167 F.R.D. 464, 478 n.22 (D. Kan. 1996) (citing Parker v. Housing Auth. of Kansas City, Kan., 
1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11975, 1990 WL 126816, *1 (D. Kan. 1990)). "
512,21," CCS attached to its reply brief a letter from Dr. Garvin which attempts to explain some of his qualifications and experience. 
See Exhibit E to Creative Copier Services: (1) Reply Brief In Support of Its Cross-Motion For Summary Judgment On Xerox 
Patent Infringement Counterclaim; And (2) Response in Opposition To Xerox' Motion To Strike the Declaration Of Donald Garvin 
(Doc. # 778) filed June 11, 1999. Xerox correctly notes that the letter is unsworn and that it therefore does not qualify as an 
affidavit. See D. Kan. Rule 56.1; 28 U.S.C. § 1746; Schartz v. Unified School Dist. No. 512, 963 F. Supp. 1067, 1070 (D. Kan. 
1997). Moreover, the Court cannot consider it unless plaintiff has properly authenticated it. See IBP, Inc. v. Mercantile Bank, 6 F. 
Supp. 2d 1258, 1263 (D. Kan. 1998). For these reasons, the Court will strike Dr. Garvin's letter. Even if the Court were to 
consider the letter, it would reach the same result regarding the admissibility of Dr. Garvin's opinions on sampling techniques. "
513,22," In his declaration, Dixon states that third party vendors use the same part numbers even though they change various 
characteristics of the parts over time. See Dixon Declaration P 13, attached as Exh. 6. The declaration, however, does not 
affirmatively demonstrate that Dixon has personal knowledge or is competent to testify regarding the practices of third party 
vendors. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e). Accordingly, the Court will exclude this portion of paragraph 13 of the Dixon declaration. "
514,23," The Court cites Dr. Mark's testimony only to illustrate that common sense supports the conclusion that manufacturers 
generally do not alter the composition of a mass produced operable replacement part without changing the part number. The 
Court does not suggest that Dr. Mark is an expert in this particular area."
514,24," For example, CCS admitted that the 1090 fuser heat rolls from D&R Products were not substantially different from the 1090 
fuser heat rolls from Xerox. See CCS Answers to Xerox First Requests For Admissions No. 67, attached as Exh. C to Xerox's 
Memorandum (1) In Reply To CCS's Opposition To Xerox's Summary Judgment Motion On Patent Infringement: And (2) In 
Opposition To CCS's Cross-Motion For Summary Judgment (Doc. # 768) filed June 1, 1999. In this response and others, CCS 
did not claim that parts shipped by the same vendor varied over time or that it could not answer requests for admissions 
because of potential variations over time. See, e.g., id., Nos. 63-64, 66-67, 69-70. Absent contrary evidence, a reasonable jury 
would conclude from the admissions and other evidence of record that Graphic Associates and OEM Supplyco sold similar heat 
rolls over the pertinent time period."
514,25," CCS has attacked Dr. Mark's qualifications only indirectly. See CCS Memorandum (Doc. # 756) filed May 3, 1999 at 8 (Dr. 
Mark not competent to establish equivalence under governing legal standard). The Court nevertheless finds that his 
qualifications are relevant to the reliability of his testimony and it has a duty to conduct a preliminary assessment of the reliability 
of the expert testimony even absent an objection. See Questar Pipeline Co. v. Grynberg, 201 F.3d 1277, 2000 WL 51802, at *12 
(10th Cir. 2000) (quoting Hoult v. Hoult, 57 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1995)); see also Taylor, 154 F.3d at 683 (qualifications relevant to 
reliability inquiry). "
516,26," CCS asserts that Xerox cannot show infringement based on the OEM Supplyco heat rolls because CCS did not purchase any 
heat rolls from it after February 1995. Except for invoices before March 1995, CCS has not submitted any evidence to support its 
assertion. Thus the Court cannot rule in favor of CCS as a matter of law on this issue. "
518,27," Dixon attached to his declaration an example of a purchase order for manuals from Graphic Associates. See Exh. F to 
Declaration of William Dixon, attached as Exh. 9 to Consolidated Appendix - Volume I (Doc. # 775) filed June 2, 1999. The 
attached purchase orders are for ""Master Locator"" manuals. Xerox attempts to establish that these manuals (and thus any 
manuals which CCS obtained from Graphic Associates) were copyrighted manuals for the Xerox model 1075 copier. Xerox 
submitted the Declaration of John J. Papietro, attached as Exhibit 1 to Xerox Corporation's Reply Memorandum in Support Of 
Motion For Summary Judgment On Its Copyright Infringement Counterclaims (Doc. # 780) filed June 15, 1999, to establish this 
point. Papietro claims that the Master Locator manual which is attached to Dixon's declaration contains the same part number as 
a Parts List for which Xerox has a registered copyright. Papietro's conclusion is erroneous, however, because Dixon did not attach a Master Locator manual to his declaration. Dixon 
attached only two sample invoices from Graphic Associates for such a manual. See Exh. 26 to Consolidated Appendix - Volume 
III (Doc. # 777) filed June 2, 1999. No part number or copier model number is identified in either invoice. CCS requests that the 
Court strike Papietro's declaration because it raises a new argument, i.e. that CCS illegally copied the Xerox model 1075 Master 
Locator manual. Given that Papietro's declaration fails to establish this point, the Court overrules the CCS request as moot. 
Dixon did refer to a model 1075 Master Locator, in another section of his declaration, and that manual was attached as a 
separate exhibit to plaintiff's opposition brief. The model 1075 Master Locator which is attached as Exhibit 26, however, is a 
printout of Dixon's original microfiche, which he had purchased from Xerox before 1989. See Dixon Declaration P 19."
518,28," In the interrogatory, Xerox asked CCS to identify each manual that it had used or reproduced and where it obtained each 
manual. In response, CCS invoked Rule 33(d), Fed. R. Civ. P., and referred to documents it had produced to Xerox. Xerox 
argues that CCS identified a legitimate source only for the model 1050 manual and thus the CCS manuals for the model 5052, 
1065, 1075 and 1090 copiers infringe Xerox's copyrights. Dixon did attach to his declaration invoices for model 1050 manuals 
that a CCS customer had ordered from Xerox. See Exh. F to Dixon Declaration, attached as Exh. 9 to Consolidated Appendix - 
Volume I (Doc. # 775) filed June 2, 1999. Dixon stated in his declaration, however, that these invoices were only an example of 
purchases from Xerox through a CCS customer. He did not state that these were the only manuals which CCS had obtained 
from Xerox. Moreover, Xerox has not included in the record the documents which CCS produced in response to the Xerox 
interrogatory. Thus this particular part of the CCS interrogatory response, and the Dixon declaration, do not constitute an 
admission that CCS copied model 5052, 1065, 1075 and 1090 manuals. "
520,29," The source of copyrighted manuals generally is not critical, provided that the claimant establishes that defendant made, used 
or sold copyrighted materials. For purposes of the Xerox motion, however, the source of the manuals is important because 
Dixon testified that the manuals which CCS obtained from Graphic Associates had a different format than Xerox manuals and 
that he was unsure whether the manuals from Graphic Associates were written by Xerox. See Dixon Depo. at 401. Xerox has 
not offered any evidence to show whether the manuals from Graphic Associates infringe Xerox copyrights. "
522,30," In its initial memorandum, Xerox argued that the CCS estoppel and laches defenses are also insufficient as a matter of law. 
CCS did not respond to these arguments and it failed to offer evidence to support the essential elements of these defenses. See "
523,," Bourne Co. v. Hunter Country Club, Inc., 990 F.2d 934, 937 (7th Cir. 1993) (""Estoppel applies only if the copyright owner is 
aware of the infringing conduct yet acts in a way that induces the infringer reasonably to rely upon such action to his detriment""); 
Brunswick Corp. v. Sprint Reel Co., 832 F.2d 513, 523 (10th Cir. 1987) (to establish laches, defendant must show inexcusable 
delay by claimant in filing suit and resulting prejudice to defendant from such delay). The Court therefore sustains Xerox's motion 
with respect to these defenses. "
527,1, Osceola assigned its rights and obligations to Gator Generating in 1994.
527,2," As FPL Co. remains a party to the action pending below, we grant FPL Co.'s Motion to Dismiss Appeal as to FPL Co. only. 
Dismissal of FPL Co. from this appeal renders Okeelanta's Points II, III, and IV on appeal premature because those points 
address the trial court's dismissal of counterclaims that named only FPL Co. as counterdefendant. "
528,3," HN1[
]  Section 542.19, Florida Statutes (1997), provides:"
528,542," .19 Monopolization; attempts, combinations, or conspiracies to monopolize.- It is unlawful for any person to 
monopolize, attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons to monopolize any part of trade or 
commerce in this state. "
529,4, Okeelanta has implicitly abandoned its argument regarding FPL's monopolization of a retail market.
529,5," HN6[
] The Florida Legislature expressly directed that in construing Chapter 542, ""due consideration and great weight be given to the interpretations of the federal courts relating to comparable federal antitrust statutes."" § 542.32, Fla. Stat. (1997). "
530,6," The parties disagree regarding a concession made by FPL as to Okeelanta's standing as a competitor in the wholesale bulk 
market. Our review of the record on FPL's Motion to Dismiss, however, shows that FPL conceded that Okeelanta adequately 
alleged it was a competitor of FPL in the wholesale market in its Amended Counterclaim."
530,7," Okeelanta also alleged it was injured by ""threatened loss or damage,"" implying a potential future loss in the retail market. 
Because Okeelanta was not a competitor in the retail market, any future loss is irrelevant to the issue of whether it adequately 
alleged antitrust injury."
530,8," As an alternative basis to affirm, FPL argues that Okeelanta failed to allege a basis for piercing the corporate veil or some 
direct action taken by Florida Power and Light Group, Inc. and/or Florida Power and Light Group Capital, separate from the acts 
of FPL. FPL is correct in that in order to hold a parent corporation liable for the alleged antitrust violations of its subsidiary, one 
must prove an independent act on the part of the parent to affect the relevant market, or a basis to pierce the corporate veil (i.e., 
the subsidiary is a mere instrumentality of the parent corporation, such that the subsidiary has no existence of its own, and the 
parent uses the corporate existence of the subsidiary to perpetrate a fraud). See Gemco Latinoamerica, Inc. v. Seiko Time 
Corp., 685 F. Supp. 400, 403 (S.D.N.Y. 1988). However, our review of the record shows that Okeelanta alleged independent 
acts on the part of FPL that affected the relevant market, including its devising a scheme to eliminate co-generating; undertaking 
a review of the contracts to discover technical reasons to terminate them; attempting, through FPL, to terminate the contracts; 
and refusing to make capacity payments. As such, we hold FPL's argument here to be unpersuasive. "

535,3," An oligopoly is an ""economic condition where only a few companies sell substantially similar or standardized products."" Black's 
Law Dictionary 1086 (6th ed. 1990)."
535,4," The dumping margin was calculated by the Department based on a comparison of the United States sale price, foreign market 
value, and cost of production for each producer."
535,5," Under the agreement, each firm could sell potash in the United States at less than fair market value by an amount equal to 
15% of its preliminary dumping margin. "
537,6," This price increase was rescinded in the wake of the Suspension Agreement. In its place came a much smaller increase by 
PCS on January 11, 1988- three days after the Suspension Agreement created a price floor-which pricing decision was followed 
thereafter by the remaining producers. "
540,7," The class also asserts that PCS acted against its self-interest when it agreed to supply potash to PCA when PCA's mine 
flooded. This agreement occurred in February 1987, before the class contends the conspiracy ever began. It is, therefore, of little 
relevance to this case."
540,8," The class also asserts that failure to object to the Suspension Agreement was contrary to Eddy's self-interest. This argument is 
puzzling because Eddy was not in existence at the time of the agreement and thus could hardly have objected to it. "
541,9," It has been suggested that in the context of a price-fixing agreement among several producers in an oligopoly, the price 
actually would decrease somewhat over time because individual producers would attempt to ""cheat"" on the agreement by 
slightly lowering prices. Our review of the learned treatises on oligopolies and antitrust law does not seem to bear this theory 
out. First, there is very little discussion of the phenomenon of steadily lowering prices in an alleged price-fixing conspiracy. 
Second, several commentators have suggested that the incentive to lower prices while other oligopolists maintain prices deters 
collusion in the first place. See Jonathan B. Baker, Two Sherman Act Section 1 Dilemmas: Parallel Pricing, the Oligopoly 
Problem, and Contemporary Economic Theory, 38 Antitrust Bull. 143, 151 (1993) (analyzing George Stigler's 1964 article, A 
Theory of Oligopoly, 72 J. Pol. Econ. 44 (1964) and recognizing that ""the unilateral incentive to deviate on a cooperative 
arrangement to fix price …is the very market force by which competition insures low prices and high output""); see also Donald F. 
Turner, The Definition of Agreement Under the Sherman Act: Conscious Parallelism and Refusals to Deal, 75 Harv. Law Rev. 
655, 660 (1962) (noting that without an agreement among oligopolists, the pressure to cut prices is irresistible)."
541,10," Four producers present special reasons entitling them to summary judgment. As to Noranda, New Mexico Potash Corporation, 
Eddy Potash and PPG, I concur in the judgment for the reasons discussed in the panel opinion at 176 F.3d 1055, 1071-72 (8th 
Cir. 1999). "
543,11," The PCA price list is dated September 16, 1987, but a September 11 memo to the file by vice president John Ripperger refers 
to the price increase as having already taken place. "
544,12," The Court argues that Professor Rausser does not take into account the effect of the antidumping proceedings, and his 
testimony is thus irrelevant. Supra at 17. But Rausser's price level evidence specifically includes the prices that he contends 
would be required under the anti-dumping suspension agreement. Therefore, he clearly does "
546,13," It is possible that some types of evidence not logically inconsistent with innocence, such as a high level of interfirm 
communications, could become so unusual that they suffice to make a prima facie case. See City of Tuscaloosa v. Harcros 
Chems., Inc., 158 F.3d 548, 570-73 (11th Cir. 1998) (incumbency rate on new contracts so high it was inconsistent with 
independent action), cert. denied, 1999 U.S. LEXIS 4941, 120 S. Ct. 309 (1999). "
551,14," Another memorandum in the same time frame prepared by a Noranda employee states: ""Casual conversation at the SMA 
meeting with a fairly senior PCS guy got quite pointed about 'market correction plan' and he was happy to indicate that they 
could do it again ….I don't think the conversation was idle."" The similarity of the messages lends additional weight to the 
inference that PCS was the source of information for the Kalium memo. "

571,1," The proposed distribution plan of the State of Alaska is too vague to be approved by the court. Distribution of cash to Alaska 
must therefore await submission of a more detailed plan from which the court can determine whether the Settlement criteria are 
met. The State of Texas has stated that it cannot submit a plan until action is taken by the state legislature, which reportedly will not 
meet until January 2001. Therefore, no funds are to be distributed to the State of Texas until a plan is submitted and approved 
by this court. "

588,2, A bank can function as both a card-issuing institution and an acquiring institution. (Id. P 7.)
588,3," The complaint includes the following illustration of the chain of transactions: Bank A issues a Visa credit card to Consumer X, who purchases a garment for $ 100 at Store Y, which was ""acquired"" for 
Visa by Bank B. Visa rules mandate that Bank B must pay Bank A an interchange fee of 1.25% of the amount of the 
transaction, i.e., $ 1.25. Bank B will charge Store Y a ""discount fee"" higher than $ 1.25 in order to recover the mandated 
interchange fee and other fees that Visa rules mandate Bank B to pay Visa on each and every Visa credit card (and debit 
card) transaction and to earn a profit for itself. Thus, Bank B may charge a discount fee of 1.60% of the transaction amount 
(or $ 1.60) to Store Y. When Store Y presents Consumer X's $ 100 Visa transaction to Bank B, the bank will credit Store Y's 
account for $ 98.40, send the Visa mandated $ 1.25 interchange fee to Bank A and retain the $ .35 balance of the ""discount 
fee."" "
589,, (Id. P 8(o).) 
590,4," In 1994, Visa adopted a slightly different interchange fee for debit and credit, while MasterCard has continued to charge the 
same rate. (Id. PP 95-97.) "
592,5," This card, along with MasterCard's on-line Maestro card, is not subject to the ""honor all cards"" rule. Only merchants with PIN 
pads are equipped to accept these cards. "
593,6," For these reasons, the defendants' reliance on Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 125 L. 
Ed. 2d 168, 113 S. Ct. 2578 (1993), and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 89 L. Ed. 2d 
538, 106 S. Ct. 1348 (1986), is misplaced. The language cited by defendants did not involve questions of admissibility at all, and 
certainly not at the class certification stage. Instead, the Supreme Court held that the expert economic opinions provided by 
plaintiffs in those cases were insufficient to withstand judgment as a matter of law. See Brooke Group, 509 U.S. at 242 (expert 
opinion not supported by facts in the record ""cannot support a jury's verdict""); Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 594 n. 19 (expert opinion 
based on ""implausible"" assumptions inconsistent with record evidence insufficient to create genuine issue of material fact to 
withstand summary judgment). Another case relied upon by defendants, In re Aluminum Phosphide Antitrust Litigation, 893 F. 
Supp. 1497 (D. Kan. 1995), was decided under Daubert, but it decided a motion in limine before trial, not at the class certification 
stage. In that relatively fact-rich context, the court held the proffered expert opinion inadmissible because it was offered only ""to 
plug evidentiary holes in plaintiffs' case, to speculate, and to surmise."" Id. at 1506. Finally, defendants rely on In re Agricultural Chemicals Antitrust Litigation, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21075, No. 94-40216- MMP, 
1995 WL 787538 (N.D. Fla. Oct. 23, 1995). In denying class certification, that court did not rely on Daubert, but instead engaged 
in a lengthy, substantive critique of the findings of plaintiffs' expert. See id. at *5 - *11. That kind of inquiry is not permitted in this 
circuit on a motion for class certification. See Caridad, 191 F.3d at 292; see also In re Polypropylene Carpet Antitrust Litig., 178 
F.R.D. 603, 621 (N.D. Ga. 1997) (criticizing Agricultural Chemicals for ""performing a function that is . . . best reserved for a fact-
finding stage of the proceedings""). HN4[

595,8, The plaintiffs do not assert Rule 23(b)(1) as a basis for maintaining this class action. 
596,9," In particular, 25 of the 37 departments at Metro-North had no disciplinary cases at all during the relevant time period. See 
Caridad, 191 F.3d at 288. In addition, the defendant's expert contended that the plaintiffs' expert failed to take into account ""non-
promotable positions."" If jobs for which the rate of promotion was under one percent were excluded, the difference in promotion 
rates between whites and blacks disappeared. See id. at 289."
596,10," Judge Walker dissented from the panel's opinion. He concluded that as a matter of law plaintiffs' allegation of ""over-
delegation,"" which led to a series of allegedly discriminatory individual decisions, could not satisfy Rule 23(a)'s commonality 
requirement. See Caridad, 191 F.3d at 296 (Walker, J., dissenting). He agreed with the majority, however, that the district court "
597,," erred in crediting the defendant's expert; instead, the court should have ""deferred"" consideration of both reports until it 
considered the merits of the case.  Id. at 296-97 (Walker, J., dissenting)."
597,11," Although I find it necessary to state the elements of the substantive claims and discuss them in relationship to the 
requirements of Rule 23, none of this discussion should be taken as my resolution of any merits question for purposes other 
than the pending motion. "
598,12," The defendants do not dispute that the proposed class of meets the numerosity requirement of Rule 23(a)(1). Nor do they do 
challenge the adequacy of class counsel under Rule 23(a)(4). Although they do not explicitly dispute commonality under Rule 
23(a)(2), commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation (putting aside consideration of adequacy of counsel) ""tend to 
merge"" because they ""serve as guideposts for determining whether under the particular circumstances maintenance of a class 
action is economical and whether the named plaintiff's claim and the class claims are so interrelated that the interests of the 
class members will be fairly and adequately protected in their absence."" General Tel. Co. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 158 n.13, 72 
L. Ed. 2d 740, 102 S. Ct. 2364 (1982). "
600,13," The plaintiffs contend that this is the rule in the Second Circuit, but they cite only this tepid language from a 1953 case: ""But if 
the Sherman Act was violated, the actual damages flowing from that violation may well have included the additional amount 
which the plaintiffs had to pay because of the tie-in purchases they were compelled to make."" Bascom Launder Corp. v. Telecoin 
Corp., 204 F.2d 331, 334 (2d Cir. 1953). This language is equivocal, and it was dictum. I therefore do not consider it to have 
decided this question. "
601,14," In this regard, plaintiffs point to an internal Visa document from 1990 that termed Visa expansion into the on-line debit market 
a ""business necessity"" because development of a ""mature"" regional on-line debit ""alternative"" could cost Visa members $ 813 
million due to ""downward pressure"" on credit card interchange. (Memo from Ron Hodges, Visa Debit Market Development, 
November 29, 1990, Bates Stamp 0024939.)"
601,15," I thus need not choose between the competing line of cases described above: for plaintiffs have proffered a sufficient theory of 
class-wide injury under either the ""package"" or the ""tied product"" measure of injury."
601,16," In addition, plaintiffs argue that, for several reasons, transaction volume would not decline in the ""but-for,"" untied world. After 
Visa dramatically cut the interchange fee for Interlink, its on-line debit card, transaction volume increased. Moreover, lower off-
line debit fees would reduce merchants' incentive to ""steer"" customers (i.e., encourage them to use other payment forms), thus 
increasing transaction volume. Some of the banks' lost interchange revenue might be recovered in the form of cardholder fees. "
602,17," Consumer surveys submitted by defendants show that a sizeable minority of cardholders prefer off-line to on-line debit. 
(Declaration of Mark Kirsch, Exhibits 98-99.)"
602,18," For purposes of the present motion, I reject defendants' contention that there is no causation when this irreducible minimum of 
hard-core off-line debit card users refuses to be steered. According to this argument, the customer's refusal, not the tying 
arrangement, is the cause in fact of any injury. See Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U.S. 100, 114 n.9, 23 L. 
Ed. 2d 129, 89 S. Ct. 1562 (1969) (""It is enough that the illegality is shown to be a material cause of the injury; a plaintiff need 
not exhaust all possible alternative sources of injury in fulfilling his burden of proving compensable injury under § 4.""). "
603,19," Most of the cases simply state the rule that individual damages questions will not bar class certification in conclusory fashion 
without assessing whether individual questions would predominate if each damages action had to be tried separately. But that is 
not always the case. In Abrams v. Interco, Inc., 719 F.2d 23 (1983), the Second Circuit quoted favorably this passage from 
Professor Areeda: The damage issue turns out to be a major stumbling block for [antitrust] class actions. The evidence establishing damages 
usually varies from class member to class member. . . . Even the necessity of individual trials on damages may be fatal if 
the class numbers in the thousands or millions. Individual litigations in such cases would be clearly infeasible, but the courts 
will not permit class actions unless they can devise a practical means for their litigation. Id. at 31 (quoting 2 Areeda & Turner, Antitrust Law § 332c, at 157 (1978)). It may well be appropriate to address before trial the 
merits of some of defendants' damages-related arguments, and whether, upon resolution of those issues, there remains a 
""practical means"" to litigate the damage claims of class members. See infra § II. B(7). "
604,20," The defendants indicate that they will dispute Carlton's definition of the relevant market. Resolution of this definitional question 
is susceptible to class-wide resolution."
604,21," The defendants do not challenge the propriety of class certification as to the remaining element of the § 1 claim, namely 
whether a substantial share of interstate commerce was affected by the disputed arrangement. "
606,22, The parties have not briefed the statute of limitations aspect of class definition. 
614,1," The Court uses the abbreviation ""MHP"" herein to refer to both Market Hub Partners, L.P. and Market Hub Partners, Inc."
614,2," Arlington Storage Corporation, Public Service Electric and Gas Company, Long Island Lighting Company, New York State 
Electric & Gas Corporation and Chattanooga Gas Company also intervened in the FERC proceeding. (Declaration of Drew J. 
Fossum, [# 15]). "
615,3," The Court notes that it has thoroughly reviewed MHP's objections, and while this was one of the issues raised by MHP, the 
Court does not agree that it was the ""primary thrust"" of MHP's objections."
615,4," Although the complaint alleges that defendant Coalition For Resources and Environment in the Southern Tier, Inc. (CREST) 
intervened in the FERC proceeding, it does not identify any statements that CREST allegedly made to FERC, none of the 
documents from the FERC proceeding refer to CREST, and CREST denies that it intervened in that action. "
616,5," As noted above, in its July 10, 1996 letter to FERC, the DEC stated that as a result of the proposed change in plaintiff's 
operations, it would required plaintiff to obtain a new SPDES permit. "
619,6," The ""similarly situated"" party is MHP, which had been issued a more restrictive permit for its Tioga project."
619,7," In Count VII of the complaint dealing with the claim for common law fraud, the complaint makes a conclusory assertion that 
""NYDEC, FERC and the EPA relied upon those representations and as a result, took actions which damaged BPSI"" (Comp par 
191), however the complaint does not allege what those ""actions"" were or how they injured plaintiff. "
620,8," TPC is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Houston, Texas, and it is the largest owner of natural gas 
salt cavern storage facilities in the United States. In 1994, TPC performed a limited partnership called Market Hub Partners, LP. 
The limited partnership consists of five limited partners and one general partner. The five limited partners are: TCP, Nipsco 
Industries, Inc., New Jersey Resources, Corp., DPL, Inc., and Public Service Enterprise Group. The general partner is Market 
Hub Partners, Inc., whose stock is owned by the aforementioned five limited partners of Market Hub Partners, LP. "
623,9," Although plaintiff objects to the Court considering these documents on a 12(b)(6) motion, it does not attempt to distinguish 
Cortec Industries, Inc. v. Sum Holding L.P. 949 F.2d 42 (2d Circuit 1991) or Brass v. American Film Technologies, Inc., 987 F.2d 
142, 150 (2d Cir. 1993). "
624,10," The Court notes that Hon. Thomas W. Keegan, Justice of the Supreme Court, Albany County, in a Decision and Order dated 
January 29, 1997, in an Article 78 proceeding initiated by plaintiff, referred to the fact that plaintiff itself had stated that it had 
""problems with tubing failures at Well No. 2,"" and had applied to the DEC for a permit to drill a replacement well. "
637,1," Plaintiff Heavy Duty Recycling Corporation (""HDRC"") is Bepco's sister company and buys and sells compressor and valve 
cores in the open market. HDRC provides worn out cores to Bepco."
637,2," Bepco also points to a document found among many produced during discovery placing Allied Signal's 1995 valve aftermarket 
share at 60%. However, according to Defendants' director of aftermarket marketing, Donna Freiberger, and the person who 
prepared the document, Robert Johnson, the 60% figure was simply a ""guess"" based on conversations of less than ten minutes 
with two or three marketing and sales people and was not used for any business planning or decision and was done without 
having the benefit of the total replacement valve sales for the market as a whole for 1995. The court does not consider this figure 
reliable for any market share screening purposes. Bepco must do more than raise ""some metaphysical doubt as to the material 
facts."" Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538, 106 S. Ct. 1348 (1986). See 
Thompson Everett, Inc. v. National Cable Adver., 57 F.3d 1317, 1323 (4th Cir. 1995). Plaintiffs have moved to strike the Freiberger and Johnson affidavits which were submitted by Defendants in reply to Plaintiffs' 
market share arguments in Plaintiffs' response to Defendants' motion for summary judgment. The court finds that such 
supplementation was proper under the circumstances and will deny Plaintiffs' motion. "
638,3," In his deposition, former Allied Signal employee Gary Burow estimated that 750 to 1,000 NAPA stores sold Bendix brake 
products. During the time period in question NAPA was affiliated with Midland. Burow Dep. at 312-13."
638,4," Bepco places this figure at 1,000, counting documents supplied by Defendants to Plaintiffs in response to request for copies of 
all distributor agreements going back to the 1970's, whether currently in force or not."
638,5," This does not mean, however, that OE dealers carry genuine parts without exception. David Albert, the current manager of 
Volvo's aftermarket programs, testified in his deposition that his company acquired Bendix-style compressors and valves from 
Allied Signal and Midland-style compressors and valves from Midland. He also stated, however, that he purchased Cummins 
compressors re-manufactured by Allied Signal and Sealco valves re-manufactured by Midland or by Allied Signal. Albert was 
formerly an official at Bepco, and he testified that while he was there some Volvo OE dealers purchased parts from Bepco. 
Albert Dep. at 10-11. "
639,6," Hudnell testified in his deposition that he could not recall any geographic market where Bepco experienced difficulty finding 
adequate means of distribution during the mid-1980s. He later stated that in the early 1990s ""there were distributor candidates 
out there."" He did not agree that during the relevant time period Bepco was unable to distribute re-manufactured Bendix 
products because of the presence of Allied Signal distributors. Hudnell Dep. at 73-74, 92, 388-89."
639,7," As noted infra, one-half of Allied Signal's distribution is through the IAM channel. However, the 21.5% and 18.5% figures are 
too high given that Bendix replacement products comprise less than 100% of Allied Signal's total replacement product sales. The 
parties have not, however, provided the court with more accurate figures. As has been noted, Bendix products dominated the 
compressor and valve original equipment markets, to the tune of seventy-six per cent (76%) and eighty-five per cent (85%) 
market shares, respectively. Since a worn out part and its replacement are almost always the same brand, one would expect 
Bendix products re-manufactured by either Allied Signal or a competitor to command roughly corresponding percentages of the 
compressor and valve aftermarkets (of which Allied Signal enjoys forty-three per cent (43%) and thirty-seven per cent (37%) 
shares). If seventy-six per cent (76%) and eighty-five (85%) of the replacement compressors and valves sold by Allied Signal 
were Bendix-style, respectively, then the forty-three per cent (43%) and thirty-seven per cent (37%) figures should be reduced 
before being halved. This would yield a foreclosure percentage of sixteen per cent (16%) for each replacement product. The 
greater the percentage of replacement compressors and valves sold by Allied Signal which are non-Bendix, the lower the 
percentages of the total aftermarkets from which Bepco was foreclosed by Allied Signal's distributorship agreements. Since the 
actual figures are not given, the court will construe them in the light most favorable to Bepco and use the maximum foreclosure 
percentages, 21.5% for compressors and 18.5% for valves. "
640,8," In 1991, Allied Signal revised its core return policy to require ""like for like"" returns, which means that a customer must now 
return the same generation core as the re-manufactured part he or she purchases, in order to avoid paying the core charge. This 
change puts Allied Signal's core return policy in line with those of other re-manufacturers and avoids creating a potential for 
arbitrage by Allied Signal customers. Before the ""like for like"" requirement existed, a person could return an old, worthless core 
when buying a new generation part, which the person would immediately turn around and sell on the open market. "
642,9," In its brief, Bepco concedes that an even narrower market definition, one that cordons off particular models of Bendix 
replacement parts into their own markets, would be inappropriate because ""defendants are able to substitute component models 
one for the other . . . on the supply side."" Unfortunately for Bepco, failure to effectively counter this very same principle with 
respect to Warren-Boulton's market definitions defeats these definitions."
642,10," Although Bepco cites the OEM markets for new compressors and for new valves as relevant markets with respect to its 
monopolization and attempted monopolization claims, these markets are not relevant markets. Bepco concedes that it does not "
643,," compete in the OEM markets. Thus it cannot have suffered any antitrust injury from conduct rising to the level of monopolization 
or attempted monopolization by Allied Signal in those markets."
643,11," Bepco's suggestion in oral argument that the court should apply a multiplier to the 43% and 37% figures is little better. Bepco 
derives the multiplier from the ratio of Allied Signal's figures for its share of Bendix product sales to its figure for its share of total 
aftermarket sales. It is difficult to understand why Plaintiff believes Allied Signal's figures themselves are unpersuasive, while at 
the same time the mathematical relationship they bear to each other is. "
644,12," The provision reads: ""SECTION 3. SERVICE DISTRIBUTOR shall: (a) carry and maintain an inventory of PRODUCTS 
sufficient to offer and provide prompt availability to customers within said Primary Area of Responsibility, which inventory, unless 
otherwise agreed in Exhibit ""A"", shall be the full line of BENDIX PRODUCTS equal to ninety (90) days supply of said 
PRODUCTS; . . . ."""
644,13," The courts in these cases reached this conclusion by characterizing full line forcing provisions as vertical non-price restraints, 
to which the rule of reason applies. See Smith Mach., 878 F.2d at 1295-96; Volpp Tractor, 917 F. Supp. at 1228-29. The 
Supreme Court has held that vertical restraints are not illegal per se unless they include an agreement on price or price levels.  
Business Elecs. Corp. v. Sharp Elecs. Corp., 485 U.S. 717, 735-36, 99 L. Ed. 2d 808, 108 S. Ct. 1515 (1988). Several courts 
also emphasize that full line forcing arrangements, which constrain dealers or distributors, do not limit the choices facing 
consumers. See Roy B. Taylor, 28 F.3d at 1383; Smith Mach., 878 F.2d at 1297; Volpp Tractor, 917 F. Supp. at 1229-30; 
Ransomes, 914 F. Supp. at 185. This is the case when such consumers may purchase the products separately and have 
available alternative channels through which to purchase the products. "
645,14," Courts and commentators have not settled on a magic percentage as constituting significant foreclosure; provisions involving 
foreclosure as low as twenty-four per cent (24%) have been condemned while others involving foreclosure as high as fifty per 
cent (50%) have been tolerated. Compare Twin City Sportservice, Inc. v. Charles O. Finley & Co., Inc., 676 F.2d 1291, 1298 (9th 
Cir. 1982) (twenty-four per cent (24%) unlawful where contracts were long-term) with Barry Wright Corp. v. ITT Grinnell Corp., 
724 F.2d 227, 237-38 (1st Cir. 1983) (fifty per cent (50%) lawful where requirements contract had limited anticompetitive effect) 
and Sewell Plastics, Inc. v. Coca-Cola Co., 720 F. Supp. 1196, 1218-20 (W.D.N.C. 1989) (forty per cent (40%) lawful where no 
anticompetitive harm shown), aff'd in part, 912 F.2d 463 (4th Cir. 1990). Professor Hovenkamp suggests twenty per cent (20%) 
as an appropriate minimum foreclosure percentage. See XI Antitrust Law P 1821c."
645,15," The court in Barr Labs., for example, uses this term to describe the flexible inquiry set forth by the Supreme Court in Tampa 
Electric. Barr Labs., 978 F.2d at 111. "
646,16," Bepco's argument here is similar to an argument advanced by the plaintiff in Omega Environmental. In response to the 
contention that defendant's distributors would not abandon defendant's products, the Ninth Circuit stated: ""We agree with the 
unremarkable proposition that a competitor with a proven product and strong reputation is likely to enjoy success in the 
marketplace, but reject the notion that this is anticompetitive. It is the essence of competition."" Omega Environmental, 127 F.3d 
at 1164. "
649,17," Allied Signal also has submitted evidence which suggests that the replacement part industry in general is populated by re-
manufacturers who have instituted core return policies."
649,18," Bepco has also alleged that Allied Signal acquired Bendix cores and either warehoused or destroyed them in order to keep 
them out of the hands of its competitors. This allegation is not supported by facts which, even cast in the light most favorable to 
Bepco, raise a genuine issue as to its existence. "
658,1," In addition, there is testimony from Paul Freund, a driver for Western, that on September 15, 1995, Edmonds told him that 
Monarch had an agreement with IDS, that neither would sell in the other's state: IDS would not sell in Utah, and Monarch would 
not sell in Idaho. "
659,2," Foreman's testimony is not hearsay under Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(D). Foreman is clearly an agent or servant of Wayne-
Dalton testifying to a matter within his employment and responsibility. The statement may therefore be admitted against Wayne-
Dalton, although it cannot be admitted against any other party, including IDS, under Rule 801(d)(2)(D)."
659,3," Western submits testimony from Wicher that on August 16, 1995, he was told by Watt Hyer, the owner of Garage Door 
Handiman in Wyoming that Bill Richards told Hyer that Wayne-Dalton terminated Western at the request of IDS. This testimony 
contains double hearsay, only one level of which might be admissible. Richards' statement to Hyer may not be hearsay under 
Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(D), but Hyer's statement to Wicher is certainly hearsay under Rule 801(c), and Western proffers no 
exception that might apply to the statement. The Court will therefore disregard this testimony. "
660,4," Flannery's statements are not hearsay under Rule 801(d)(2)(D) since he was a Regional Manager for Wayne-Dalton, and was 
speaking on matters within his employment and his area of responsibility. Under that Rule, the statement is only nonhearsay for 
purposes of admission against Wayne-Dalton, not against any other party."
660,5," There are serious questions whether Mitchell's statement to Wicher is nonhearsay under Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(D). 
Western directs the Court to no evidence regarding Mitchell's role at IDS other than to say that he was a salesman. The Court 
has no way of determining whether Mitchell was in a position to know about price rises in the Idaho Falls area so as to satisfy 
the requirements of Rule 801(d)(2)(D). The Court is inclined to find that the testimony is hearsay, with no exception applicable 
under Rule 803. But even if admitted, the statement only establishes that IDS was in the process of raising prices, and says 
nothing about whether prices were in fact raised, by how much, and to which customers. "
662,6," There are serious questions regarding the admissibility of Covington's statements. Covington identifies himself in his affidavit 
as an ""outside"" salesman for IDS, selling Wayne-Dalton garage doors in the Idaho Falls/Pocatello area in 1995. He apparently 
obtained his market share data not from any study that he personally conducted, but rather from Vaughn Squires at IDS. It is 
unclear from the affidavit how Covington obtained the information from Squires. This raises a number of concerns. First, the 
testimony contains double hearsay. Squires' figures are the first level of hearsay, while Covington's discussion of those figures is 
the second level. Even if Covington's testimony is admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(D), there is no discussion by Western as to 
why Squires' figures are not hearsay. Perhaps they are company records kept in the ordinary course of business, but the Court 
is speculating here -- Western has provided no information on this. Second, Covington could offer this market share data as a 
lay opinion under Rule 701 or as an expert under Rule 702, but his affidavit completely fails to address his qualifications 
necessary to establish the requirements of either Rule. Finally, the affidavit does not establish how Covington came to obtain 
these figures from Squires, and thus fails under Rule 602, which requires personal knowledge. The Court therefore rejects 
Covington's affidavit regarding market share, but goes on in the text of this decision to discuss the effect of the market share 
figures assuming they are admissible."
662,7," Covington actually states in his affidavit that the 80% to 90% market share in Pocatello and Bannock County was obtained by 
IDS six months after it purchased Bob's Overhead Door in Pocatello. That purchase was completed in July, 1995, and six 
months later would be January, 1996."
662,8," These statements on price by Covington appear, unlike his earlier affidavit testimony on market share, to be based on his 
personal observations as a salesman for IDS. He worked in the past in Boise, and also had experience in both the Idaho Falls 
and Pocatello areas. Thus, this testimony does not suffer from the hearsay and Rule 602 problems that his earlier market share 
testimony suffered from. The Court finds this testimony admissible."
662,9," Wicher testified that in Boise in 1995, a T37 Wayne-Dalton door sold for $ 329 while in Idaho Falls the same door sold for $ 
220. These statements, based on his personal observation, are admissible and do not constitute hearsay."
662,10," Wicher's testimony about the cause of the price differential is opinion testimony that, based on his expertise in this field, could 
be admissible either under Rule 701 or 702. "
665,11," As discussed earlier in this decision, the Court finds no competent evidence that Monarch refused to sell to Western on 
November 21st at the behest of Wayne-Dalton. But even if that was so, there is no evidence as to Wayne-Dalton's market share 
in any Idaho or Utah market. Thus, the per se rule would still not apply."
665,12," In contrast, a horizontal restraint occurs when competitors at the same market level agree to restrain trade, whether at their 
own or another market level.  Sharp, 485 U.S. at 731. "
668,13, Justice O'Connor was joined by three other Justices in her concurrence. 
670,14," Western has filed a motion urging the Court to reconsider its earlier decision finding that Monarch had no antitrust standing. 
This decision issued today applies with equal force to Monarch, and so the Court's earlier decision is deemed supplemented with 
this decision. The motion to reconsider will therefore be granted to the extent that the Court's earlier decision regarding Monarch 
is hereby supplemented with this decision. "
675,1," It has been stated that two or more firms may conspire to monopolize only where ""the aim of the conspiracy is to form a single 
entity to possess illegal power"".  Sun Dun, Inc. of Washington v. Coca-Cola Co., 740 F. Supp. 381, 391-92 (D.Md. 1990). We 
would take one step back and state that a claim for conspiracy to monopolize may also be stated where two or more competitors 
seek to allocate a market and exclude competitors, even if they do not form a single corporate entity. In the case at bar, even 
this is not adequately alleged."
675,2," Contrary to Plaintiff's argument, ""shared monopolies"", or oligopolies, are not limited to situations where there is only ""tacit 
collusion"". In Harkins Amusement Enter. v. General Cinema, 850 F.2d 477, 490 (9th Cir. 1988), plaintiff alleged Defendant joined 
with its competitors in bid rigging, circuit-wide deals, illusory advances and/or guarantees and blind bidding. Despite such 
allegations of overt concerted activity, the Ninth Circuit still discussed Plaintiff's ""shared monopoly"" theory, noting that it was an 
open question whether such a claim was cognizable under Section 2. Id. The court held that under the facts presented there, 
plaintiffs failed to state a claim for shared monopoly under Section 2. Id.; see also Sun Dun, 740 F. Supp. at 390 (allegation that 
two competitors conspired to monopolize a market through horizontal arrangements is more appropriately deemed an allegation 
of oligopoly which is not actionable under Section 2). "
686,1," ""This is so even if the distributor and manufacturer also compete at the distribution level . . . [such as, in that case, where] the 
manufacturer distributes its products through a distributor and independently (so-called 'dual distribution' arrangements)."" 
Electronics Communications Corp., 129 F.3d at 243. "
687,2," The Court does not address whether plaintiffs' rights may be different in the telecommunications industry due to other unique 
and more pervasive regulations in that industry. The Court is here only addressing the legality of defendants' conduct under the 
Sherman Act § 1 and Clayton Act § 3. HN7[
] "
688,3, Plaintiffs' Robinson-Patman claims are addressed infra. 
689,4," To the extent that this allegation can be understood to assert a claim for predatory pricing, this claim is dismissed because 
such a claim would make no economic sense on the facts pleaded by plaintiffs. Predatory pricing is a tactic used to force a rival 
out of business by charging below costs for certain products and later raising prices when the rival is forced out of business and 
unable to supply the market. See, e.g., Matsushita Electrical Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 585 & n. 8, 89 
L. Ed. 2d 538, 106 S. Ct. 1348 (1986). However, on the facts as pled by plaintiff, a predatory pricing scheme against plaintiffs 
makes no economic sense because plaintiffs are not a rival supplier of handsets to the market--they are merely a prospective 
distributor of the handsets under the control of defendants. Cf.  Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 576 (If the factual context renders [the 
predatory pricing] claims implausible, i.e., claims that make no economic sense, respondents must offer more persuasive 
evidence to support their claims than would otherwise be necessary.) Because defendants are already alleged to be the only 
source of Omnipoint-compatible handsets in the market, predatory pricing to eliminate plaintiffs from that market is entirely 
unnecessary in order to charge supracompetitive prices. Although Matsushita involved a motion for summary judgment, not a "
690,," motion to dismiss, here, the plaintiffs have pled facts which, even if true and viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, 
cannot support a claim for predatory pricing, and the Court will therefore dismiss any such claim at this stage."
690,5," Secondary line price discrimination is asserted in this complaint because it is alleged that the seller has discriminated among its 
purchasers in a manner that impacts competition among the sellers' customers, i.e., the favored and disfavored purchasers of 
the sellers' goods. See George Haug, 148 F.3d at 141 n.2."
690,6," A plaintiff also must establish that (1) that seller's sales were made in interstate commerce; (2) that the seller discriminated in 
price as between the two purchasers; (3) that the product or commodity sold to the competing purchasers was of the same 
grade and quality . . .."" George Haug, 148 F.3d at 141 (citing Texaco, Inc. v. Hasbrouck, 496 U.S. 543, 556, 110 L. Ed. 2d 492, 
110 S. Ct. 2535 (1990)). "
702,1," Hertz did not challenge, and the rulings of the trial court do not address, the class action allegations set forth in the complaint, 
and that matter is not here before us."
702,2," ""8. Fuel and Service Charge. ""(a) If You Do Not Purchase Fuel from Hertz at the Commencement of Your Rental and You Return the Car with Less Fuel Than 
Was in It When You Received It, Hertz will charge you for fuel and the service of refueling at the applicable rate specified on the 
Rental Record, determined as follows: ""(i) If you do not buy fuel during the rental, this charge will be the number of miles driven, as shown on the Car's odometer, 
multiplied by the per mile rate specified on the Rental Record. "
703,," ""(ii) If you buy fuel during the rental, this charge will be the per gallon rate specified on the Rental Record multiplied by the 
number of gallons required to refill the Car's fuel tank, determined by subtracting the capacity of the portion of the tank that is 
full, as indicated by the fuel gauge, from the manufacturer's specified capacity for the Car. ""(b) If you choose to purchase fuel from Hertz at the commencement of your rental, as shown by Your initialing the Rental 
Record, you will be charged the amount shown on the Rental Record for that purchase. If You Choose This Option You Will Not 
Incur an Additional Fuel and Service Charge, but You Will Not Receive Any Credit for Fuel Left in the Car at the Time of Return."" 
(Capitalization in original.)"
703,3," The alleged equivalency is apparently based on the assumption that the rented vehicle travels 19 miles per gallon of fuel, as $ 
.168 multiplied by 19 equals $ 3.19. Presumably, the per mile rate varies so that it correctly corresponds with the fuel 
consumption of the rented vehicle, but this is not shown by the record."
703,4," The original complaint, which contained five causes action, differed in that it included causes of action for breach of the 
covenant of good faith and fair dealing and unjust enrichment, and did not allege a cause of action for restitution. "
706,5," The Attorney General, who sponsored the legislation that became Civil Code section 1936, stated during the legislative process 
that the measure was necessitated by our decision in Truta v. Avis Rent A Car System (1987) 193 Cal. App. 3d 802 [238 Cal. 
Rptr. 806], in which, among other things, we rejected the argument that collision damage waiver fees violate the prohibition in 
Insurance Code former section 1852 against excessive rates. According to the Attorney General ""the Truta ruling necessitates 
the enactment of AB 3006. Clearly, the Department of Insurance will not be regulating CDW. Consequently . . . it is imperative 
that some effort be made to provide the protection to which consumers of CDW are entitled."" (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Rep. on 
Assem. Bill No. 3006 (1987-1988 Reg.Sess.) as amended May 19, 1988, p. 7.) "
707,6," For example, subdivision (b)(4) of Civil Code section 1936 provides that for physical damage to the vehicle and the loss of use 
thereof, the renter may be charged ""up to a total of five hundred dollars ($ 500) resulting from vandalism unrelated to the theft of 
the rented vehicle."" Similarly, subdivision (c)(7) of Civil Code section 1936 provides that any ""administrative charge"" relating to 
the cost of appraisal and other costs and expenses incident to the damage, loss, loss of use, repair, or replacement of a rented 
vehicle ""shall not exceed (A) fifty dollars ($ 50) if the total estimated cost for parts and labor is more than one hundred dollars ($ 
100) up to and including five hundred dollars ($ 500), (B) one hundred dollars ($ 100) if the total estimated cost for parts and 
labor exceeds five hundred dollars ($ 500) up to and including one thousand five hundred dollars ($ 1,500), and (C) one hundred 
fifty dollars ($ 150) if the total estimated cost of parts and labor exceeds one thousand five hundred dollars ($ 1,500). No 
administrative charge shall be imposed if the total estimated cost of parts and labor is one hundred dollars ($ 100) or less."""
707,7," For example, subdivision (c)(6) of Civil Code section 1936 provides that renters may be charged no more than ""[a]ctual charges 
for towing, storage, and impound fees paid by the rental company."" "
709,8," Though some of the cases the Lazar court relied upon in making that decision were UCL cases ( Wolfe v. State Farm Fire & 
Casualty Ins. Co. (1996) 46 Cal. App. 4th 554 [53 Cal. Rptr. 2d 878]; California Grocers Assn. v. Bank of America (1994) 22 Cal. 
App. 4th 205 [27 Cal. Rptr. 2d 396]; Korens v. R. W. Zukin Corp. (1989) 212 Cal. App. 3d 1054 [261 Cal. Rptr. 137]), only one 
(Wolfe v. State Farm & Casualty Ins. Co.) was decided on the basis of a demurrer."
709,9," Partly for this reason, we reject appellant's claim that the fuel service charge is unconscionable. Not only does this charge fail 
to ""shock the conscience"" ( California Grocers Assn. v. Bank of America, supra, 22 Cal. App. 4th at p. 215), appellant's claim 
does not even meet the less stringent standard of A & M Produce Co. v. FMC Corp. (1982) 135 Cal. App. 3d 473, 486 [186 Cal. 
Rptr. 114, 38 A.L.R.4th 1], which stated that the doctrine of unconscionability "" 'has generally been recognized to include an 
absence of meaningful choice on the part of one of the parties together with contract terms which are unreasonably favorable to 
the other party.' "" (Quoting Williams v. Walker-Thomas Furniture Company (D.C. Cir. 1965) 350 F.2d 445, 449, 18 A.L.R.3d 
1297, italics added; disagreed with by American Software, Inc. v. Ali (1996) 46 Cal. App. 4th 1386, 1391 [54 Cal. Rptr. 2d 477]; 
declined to follow by California Grocers Assn., Inc. v. Bank of America, supra, 22 Cal. App. 4th at pp. 213-214; see also Dean 
Witter Reynolds, Inc. v. Superior Court (1989) 211 Cal. App. 3d 758, 767 [259 Cal. Rptr. 789].) It is enough to reiterate that 
Hertz's customers have a ""meaningful choice,"" because the rental agreement adequately informs renters that if they reject the 
fuel purchase option and return the rented car with a full tank they will pay no fuel service charge. Because we find as a matter 
of law that the fuel service charge was not unconscionable, it is unnecessary to address appellant's related claims that the fuel 
service charge violates Civil Code sections 1670.5, subdivision (a) (relating to the enforceability of an unconscionable contract or 
clause thereof), 1670.5, subdivision (b) (affording the parties an evidentiary hearing on a claim of unconscionability), 1671 
(invalidating certain liquidated damages provisions), and 1770, subdivision (a)(19) (declaring that insertion of an unconscionable 
provision in a contract constitutes ""an unfair method of competition and unfair or deceptive act or practice""). "
710,10," The other charges referred to in subdivision (m)(2) of Civil Code section 1936 ""include, but are not limited to, optional 
insurance and accessories requested by the renter, service charges incident to the renter's optional return of the vehicle to a 
location other than the location where the vehicle was hired or leased . . . [and] charge[s] based on reasonable age criteria 
established by the rental company."" "
711,11," Counsel for Hertz maintains that a separate document is necessary to indicate whether the renter has elected any optional 
services and, if so, to state the cost thereof, and also because the per gallon rate fluctuates with changes in the price of fuel and 
can more easily be set forth in a computer-generated document rather than a preprinted form, like the rental agreement. These 
claims are, however, inadequately substantiated by the record before us."
711,12," As noted, the complaint alleges, and for present purposes we are obliged to assume, that the ""average"" car rental transaction 
is completed in four minutes. In People v. Dollar Rent-A-Car Systems, Inc. (1989) 211 Cal. App. 3d 119, 126 [259 Cal. Rptr. 
191], which addressed UCL claims similar to those made here, the court accepted without discussion the claim that the 
""average"" car rental transaction lasts four minutes. "
712,13," For example, assume renters A and B each returned cars that were five gallons short of a full tank and that each car traveled 
19 miles per gallon of fuel (see, ante, fn. 3). Renter A, who purchased no fuel during the rental, could only have traveled about 
95 miles. Ninety-five times the per mile rate of $ .168 equals $ 15.96. Renter B, who traveled a long distance requiring him to 
purchase fuel during the rental, would therefore be subject to the per gallon rate of $ 3.19. Thus, he would be required to pay 
almost the identical amount (5 x $ 3.19 = $ 15.95) for the five gallons of gas needed to refill the tank of his car. "
713,14," The Cel-Tech court adopted the following test: ""When a plaintiff who claims to have suffered injury from a direct competitor's 
'unfair' act or practice invokes section 17200, the word 'unfair' in that section means conduct that threatens an incipient violation 
of an antitrust law, or violates the policy or spirit of one of those laws because its effects are comparable to or the same as a 
violation of the law, or otherwise significantly threatens or harms competition."" (Cel-Tech, supra, 20 Cal. 4th at p. 187.)"
713,15," We further note that at least one other court has found that Cel-Tech's disapproval of the language in Casa Blanca and State 
Farm ""was expressly limited to the competitor context and specifically stated not to relate to 'actions by consumers.' "" ( South 
Bay Chevrolet v. General Motors Acceptance Corp. (1999) 72 Cal. App. 4th 861, 877, 887 [85 Cal. Rptr. 2d 301].) "
715,16," Indeed, neither does the rental agreement nor anything else in the record before us disclose how the fuel service charge is 
calculated for renters who accept the fuel service option and purchase fuel from Hertz at the outset of the rental. Such renters 
are presumably subject to a per gallon rate, but we do not know whether it differs from the per gallon rate of $ 3.19 imposed on 
renters who reject the fuel purchase option, then purchase fuel during the rental, but return the car with less than a full tank."
715,17," This case is thus distinguishable from Lewis v. Hertz Corp. (1992) 181 A.D.2d 493 [581 N.Y.S.2d 305], which Hertz relies 
upon, even if, as Hertz asserts, New York has a law ""virtually identical to Civil Code section 1936(m)(2)."" The court in Lewis 
concluded that ""[w]hile the consumer practices of the defendant Hertz Corporation may raise serious questions about its 
business methods, it has managed to stay within the strictures of the law."" ( Id., 581 N.Y.S.2d at p. 307) The court pointed out, 
however, that ""[t]he issue presented by the instant motion and cross-motion was not that of a motion to dismiss . . . for failure to 
state a cause of action, which merely addresses the sufficiency of pleadings, but a motion for summary judgment . . ., which 
searches the record and looks to the sufficiency of the underlying evidence. [Citation.]"" (Id. at p. 308.) As we have said, the trial 
court and this court lack evidence of the sort relied upon in Lewis, as Hertz's demurrer does no more than challenge the 
sufficiency of the pleadings. Furthermore, the only issue in Lewis was the validity of the options Hertz presented its customers; 
the plaintiff in that case evidently did not additionally claim, as does appellant here, that the rental agreement was confusing and 
misleading and independently constituted an unfair business practice under an applicable statute. "

In particular, this Court notes that the Supreme Court found the Paramount defendants, eight studios that owned production, 
distribution, and exhibition facilities and dominated and controlled the movie industry, guilty of restraining and monopolizing the 
distribution and exhibition of films in violation of §§ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.  Id. at 880 (citations omitted). A series of 
consent judgments followed, prohibiting the Paramount defendants, most significantly: From licensing any features for exhibition upon any run in any theatre in any other manner than that each license shall be 
offered and taken theatre by theatre, solely upon the merits and without discrimination in favor of affiliated theatres, circuit 
theatres or others. Id. at 881 (citation omitted)(emphasis added). "

before submitting their motion or asking this Court for special permission to file such a motion, see Individual Rules of Judge 
David N. Edelstein 2.A., it would be remiss for this Court to reject the motion in view of the significance of the facts detailed 
therein. It would be futile and illogical for this Court to analyze the individual pre-merger market share of movie theatres that 
Loews possessed in Manhattan and speculate as to its potential market share if merged with Cineplex, disregarding that Loews 
and Cineplex have already actually merged into LCE. "

that ""acquiescence HN18[
] in an illegal scheme is as much a violation of the Sherman Act as the creation and promotion of 
one."" Paramount, 334 U.S. at 161. Thus, because relationship licensing is consensual between the participating distributors and 
exhibitors, it follows that a court may also hold exhibitors liable for any illegality. "

(1962). Here, this Court finds that the product market is the film exhibition market, and the relevant geographic market is 
Manhattan. See id. at 336 (""Congress prescribed a pragmatic, factual approach to the definition of the relevant market and not a 
formal, legalistic one.""). In addition, it should be noted that the Upper East Side of Manhattan is ""the most important market

752,40," This Court is wary that the merger may facilitate escalating and prohibitively expensive ticket-prices. On February 28, 1999, 
the New York Times reported the recent increase of LCE ticket prices to $ 9.50, the highest in the nation. See Robert D. 
McFadden, Appearing Finally in Theaters: The $ 9.50 Movie, N.Y. Times, February 28, 1999. Granted, the increase may have 
had no connection at all to the merger, as in recent years, increases in ticket prices have been a regular occurrence in 
Manhattan. A March 19, 1999 New York Times article reported that ""in the last five years, movie ticket prices in the city have 
gone up by 27 percent, more than twice as fast as the cost of living."" Clyde Haberman, Moviegoers Vs. Theaters: Food Fight!, 
N.Y. Times, March 19, 1999, at B1. The present jump to $ 9.50, however, occurred despite assurances from a Cineplex executive, at the time of the merger, 
guaranteeing that the merger would not cause an increase in ticket prices. See id. (""I can guarantee you that ticket prices will not 
increase as a result of this merger.""). This Court also notes that Manhattan, in addition to having the dubious distinction of 
charging the most expensive movie-ticket prices, offers a paucity of matinee theatre prices at its movie theatres. "

757,46," This tort has also been referred to as interference with economic advantage, prospective advantage, business relations, or 
pre-contractual relations. See Martin Ice Cream, Co. v. Chipwich, Inc., 554 F. Supp. 933, 945 (S.D.N.Y. 1983). "
758,47," It is also possible that Plaintiff once again has mislabeled its claim against Defendants. Plaintiff contends that Defendants 
interfered with the exhibition of Anna at the Paris ""as previously arranged,"" suggesting there was already an agreement between 
Plaintiff and Warner for the showing of Anna. If so, Defendants' purported interference would be not with a prospective 
contractual relationship but, rather, with an established contractual relation, implicating an entirely different tort. See Martin Ice 
Cream, 554 F. Supp. at 945. This Court directs Plaintiff to be more precise with regard to this matter in its future submissions. "
759,48," This Court, however, cautions Plaintiff to be thorough in its research and to offer only specific contractual relations that 
realistically could be used to establish a claim for tortious interference. In its opposition memorandum to this Court, Plaintiff 
suggests that 'Defendants' failure to disclose to Plaintiff the availability of The Spitfire Grill, a Columbia film, for exhibition at the 
Paris could be a viable business relationship with which Defendants interfered. See Plaintiff's Mem. at 30 (citing Amended 
Compl. at P 62). Arguing that this allegation supports a claim for tortious interference with a prospective economic advantage is extremely 
tenuous. If, as Plaintiff states, Defendants never informed Plaintiff of the opportunity to exhibit The Spitfire Grill, then Plaintiff is 
effectively asking this Court to find tortious interference with a future economic advantage of which Plaintiff was not even aware. 
See Minnesota Mining, 1997 WL 166497, at *7 (requiring a plaintiff to identify ""some particular, existing business relationship""). 
The law was not intended to protect a party from such a contorted interpretation of the tort. "

(1984). The Court stated: The coordinated activity of a parent and its wholly owned subsidiary must be viewed as that of a single enterprise . . . . A 
parent and its wholly owned subsidiary have a complete unity of interest. Their objectives are common, not disparate, and 
their general corporate objectives are guided or determined not by two separate corporate consciousnesses, but one. With 
or without a formal ""agreement,"" the subsidiary acts for the parent's benefit. If the parent and the subsidiary ""agree"" to a 
course of action, there is no sudden joining of economic resources that had previously served different interests . . . . Id."
761,52," It is also interesting that a senior officer of Sony Pictures provided the initial motivation behind the construction of the Lincoln 
Square complex. In the context of this case, such influence on behalf of Sony Pictures, a distributor, can be understood as a 
desire for Sony Pictures to have a large, ready outlet for its films. "
762,53," Defendants argue that the amended complaint never identifies facts from which this Court can conclude that a fiduciary 
relationship had been established between Plaintiff and the Individual Defendants. See Defendants' Mem. at 29; Reply Mem. at 
20. Such a contention is meritless. Besides § 5.09 of the Twin Agreement, which establishes, in writing, a fiduciary relationship 
between Sony's executives and Plaintiff, the Individual Defendants owed fiduciary duties to Plaintiff by the very fact that they 
served as Plaintiff's agents in the operation of its theatres. "
763,54," To bolster their contention that this Court should dismiss the antitrust claims against the Individual Defendants, Defendants 
cite Brown v. Donco Enters., Inc. 783 F.2d 644 (6th Cir. 1986), a Sixth Circuit case that states: Individual liability under the antitrust laws can be imposed only where corporate agents are actively and knowingly engaged 
in a scheme designed to achieve anticompetitive ends. To support a determination of liability under this standard, the 
evidence must demonstrate that a defendant exerted his influence so as to shape corporate intentions. Id. at 646. First, the Sixth Circuit case is not binding here. See Newsweek, 663 F.2d at 1196. Second, even the Sixth Circuit 
acknowledged the paucity of support for the above proposition, stating ""at the outset, the court recognizes that the conduct 
proscribed by the antitrust laws is often difficult to distinguish 'from the gray zone of socially acceptable and economically 
justifiable business conduct,'"" and citing only ""one court,"" from the Northern District of California, in a 1979 decision. Id. In 
addition to the lack of precedential value that the Sixth Circuit case has for this Court, this Court finds that, in any event, Plaintiff 
has complied with the Sixth Circuit standard for purposes of withstanding a motion to dismiss."

763,56," In the amended complaint, Plaintiff alleges breaches of the Twin Agreement, the Paris Agreement, and the Festival

delineate the specifics of either. "

which shall result in discriminating in rates or terms between licensees similarly situated; provided however, that differentials 
based upon applicable business factors which justify different rates or terms shall not be considered discrimination within the 
meaning of this section; and provided further that nothing contained in this section shall prevent changes in rates or terms from 
time to time by reason of changing conditions affecting the market for or marketability of performing rights."" "

790,3," See, e.g., Second Amended Complaint P IX. "
791,4," Plaintiffs' Memorandum in Opposition to Summary Judgment (""Opposition"") p. 21. In its initial Memorandum in Support of 
Summary Judgment, DePuy hypothesized that plaintiffs' breach of contract claim was based on DePuy's refusal to waive 
enforcement of the covenant not to compete and/or attempt to enforce a statutorily unenforceable contract term. In their 
Opposition, plaintiffs negate this hypothesis, stating that ""in fact, the claim is based upon the facts that the contract specifically 
states that in the event of change of control provisions . . . would apply ""'only [where] You sold Products at the time of the 
change in control.'"" Opposition p. 21 (internal emphasis and brackets in original). In other words, plaintiffs state that the basis for 
their breach of contract claim is DePuy's attempted enforcement of the contract beyond its terms and the Court therefore 
considers only this basis. However, the Court believes that, under the circumstance of this case, the analysis discussed below 
would apply equally to the other two bases."
791,5," La. C.C. art. 1994 provides: An obligor is liable for the damages caused by his failure to perform a conventional obligation. A failure to perform results from nonperformance, defective performance, or delay in performance."

795,14," The Court also found that plaintiffs Louisiana unfair trade practices claims were preempted by § 301 of the Federal Copyright 
Act, making the rest of the court's finding arguably dicta. Nonetheless, the Court has considered the sound reasoning set forth in 
the Qualey decision with respect to the timeliness of the plaintiff's claim. "
798,1," A settlement has been reached between the plaintiff and defendants E.I. Dupont De Nemours & Co., Bayer Corporation and 
FUJI Medical Systems U.S.A., Inc. thus rendering the motions to dismiss filed by these defendants moot. "
801,2," Since the Hyde decision, this Court has handled at least one other case involving settlement of both direct and indirect 
purchaser claims. See Long v. Abbott Labs, 1999 NCBC 10 (No. 97-CVS-8289, Mecklenburg County Super. Ct. July 30, 1999) 
(Tennille, J)."
801,3," One of the problems inherent in indirect purchaser class actions is that if the division of a settlement or judgment is diverse, the 
distribution amount can be too small to warrant individual claims against the fund, or can be so small that attorney fees and 
administration costs become disproportionately high. See Long v. Abbott Labs, 1999 NCBC 10 (No. 97-CVS-8289, Mecklenburg 
County Super. Ct. July 30, 1999) (Tennille, J.) (order on petition for attorney fees). The federal approach consolidates damages 
at the distributor level where significant incentives to sue may exist and damages are far less speculative and simpler to prove. "
802,4," Counsel for plaintiffs and the other defendants have indicated to the Court that they have reached a settlement. A final 
settlement, including specification of how the settlement funds will be allocated, has not been presented to the Court for 
approval. Settlement will raise many of the same allocation issues. "

Memorial Hospital et al., Case No. 4FA-95-3001. In that suit Dr. Odom raises claims similar to the ones included in this suit, but 
which stem from the administrative proceeding in which FMH revoked his staff privileges. The other doctors are included among 
the fifteen defendants in that case. That case is now on appeal to this court, docketed as Case No. S-8007. We make no determination of the effect of our 
resolution of this case on the issues raised in that appeal."

825,2," The court notes its discomfort in considering the possibility that a lawsuit that has clogged the federal court system and 
absorbed the attention of several lawyers and judges for nearly ten years could be a sham."
825,3," Both parties spend some time arguing whether erroneous jury instructions are sufficient to warrant judgment as a matter or law, 
or whether a party waives this post-trial argument when that party failed to object to the instructions at the time they were given. 
In fact, the jury was instructed only on the ""sham"" portion of the Noerr-Pennington defense, and not on the attendant publicity 
theory. Oddly, Binzel U.S. never argues that the judge improperly instructed the jury on the Noerr-Pennington defense. Indeed, 
Nu-Tecsys corrected the court on the Noerr-Pennington defense, and the court reinstructed the jury, still omitting the attendant 
publicity theory, without objection from Binzel U.S. (Tr. 1325-27.) "
835,1," The Bar seeks a waiver of the rule 1-12.1 requirements that the Board approve all proposed changes and that notice of all 
proposals be published at least thirty days prior to the filing of the petition. By this opinion, we grant the waiver. "
836,2," At oral argument, Bar counsel represented to the Court its belief that the JQC, as a matter of policy, does not intend to seek 
attorney discipline for judicial misconduct, as it is authorized to do under article V, section 12(a)(1) of the Florida Constitution. 
We express no view on counsel's representation or JQC policy. Article V, section 12(a)(1) of the Florida Constitution provides in 
pertinent part: (1) There shall be a judicial qualifications commission vested with jurisdiction to investigate and recommend to the 
Supreme Court of Florida the removal from office of any justice or judge whose conduct, during term of office . . . 
demonstrates a present unfitness to hold office, and to investigate and recommend the discipline of a justice or judge 
whose conduct, during term of office . . ., warrants such discipline. For purposes of this section, discipline is defined as any

886,3," Four financially troubled boatbuilders--Baja, Porter, Pro-Line, and Fountain--entered into long term contracts with Brunswick in 
exchange for financial assistance. The contracts were for three to five years and, in the case of Baja and Porter, they contained 
some provisions extending beyond five years. The Baja and Fountain contracts required those companies to purchase 100 of 
their engines from Brunswick. Porter was required to purchase 99, and Pro-Line's contract contained a 50 market share 
threshold. The boat builders' expert testified that these companies made up about 5 of the stern drive engine market. See Tr. at 
1179. "
887,4," Brunswick also made several other acquisitions that were not part of the main focus of the boat builders' Clayton Act claims. In 
1987 it made a small asset purchase from BMW Marine Diesel, a European diesel engine manufacturer; Brunswick hoped this 
would enable it to compete with Volvo in Europe. See Tr. at 4552. In 1990 it acquired Kiekhaefer Aeromarine, which annually 
produced about sixty high performance stern drive engines that were priced at more than $ 50,000. Neither of these acquisitions 
involved products that competed in the relevant market, nor did they occur during the limitations period. See discussion Part III. 
A. The boat builders characterized both companies as ""small players"" in their closing argument at trial. See Tr. at 6632. In 1995 
Brunswick bought boat builder Baja Cruisers which had 2.8 of the stern drive engine market; the boat builders' expert testified 
that Baja was not really a significant player in the market. See id. at 1178, 1189."

889,8," In denying equitable relief to the boat builders, the district court indicated that they had asked for an ""order that Brunswick 
divest itself within twelve months of its US Marine [Bayliner] and Sea Ray boat manufacturing divisions …."" Order of Oct. 16, 
1998 at 7. The boat builders apparently had not specifically requested divestiture of Baja, which was being operated as part of 
the Sea Ray division. The court held that ""in light of the record as a whole, the balance of equities precludes any award of 
divestiture, including the divestiture by Brunswick of Baja …."" Id. at 13 (emphasis in original). "
890,9," The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) has submitted an amicus curiae brief supporting Brunswick's position that 
this type of discount program results in lower prices for consumers. NAM's 14,000 member companies and subsidiaries, which 
include 10,000 small manufacturers, employ approximately 85 of all manufacturing workers in the United States and produce 
over 80 of the nation's manufactured goods. See Amicus Curiae Br. for the National Association of Manufacturers at 1. It states 
that this case has significant implications for potential antitrust liability for its members should they choose to offer above cost, 
non exclusive discounts to consumers. See id. at 2. "

896,11," It is not clear how often the Cournot model has been employed in antitrust cases; a Westlaw search on February 3, 2000 did 
not find any other federal antitrust case discussing its application."
896,12," The owner of Mariah Boats, for example, which was found by the jury to have suffered $ 16 million of the damages awarded to 
the boat builders, testified that when Brunswick lowered its market share discount level to 70 in 1994, ""it was of no significance 
[to Mariah] because we were 90-plus anyway."" Tr. at 2129. "

] Predatory pricing occurs when ""'a single firm, having a dominant share of the relevant market, cuts its prices in order 
to force competitors out of the market, or perhaps to deter potential entrants from coming in. '"" Morgan, 892 F.2d at 1358 
(quoting Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., 475 U.S. at 584 n.8. Determining whether price cutting is predatory is not a simple inquiry: The difficulty, of course, is distinguishing highly competitive pricing from predatory pricing. A firm that cuts its prices or 
substantially reduces its profit margin is not necessarily engaging in predatory pricing. It may simply be responding to new 
competition, or to a downturn in market demand. Indeed, there is a real danger in mislabeling such practices as predatory, 
because consumers generally benefit from the low prices resulting from aggressive price competition. Morgan, 892 F.2d at 1358-59 (citing Barry Wright Corp. v. ITT Grinnell Corp., 724 F.2d 227, 231 (1st Cir. 1983)). There is no 
allegation that Brunswick engaged in predatory pricing. "

929,2," Abbott manufactures, among others, urokinase products. Urokinase is a broad category of thrombolytics used for treating 
clinical conditions caused by blood clots. See Defs' Ex. 6; see also discussion infra §§ I.A.-B. "
930,3," BioWhittaker supplied Human Neonatal Kidney (""HNK"") cells approved by the Food and Drug Administration (""the FDA"") for 
use in the production of urokinase. HNK cells approved by the FDA are a mandatory raw material for urokinase production. 
BioWhittaker was the only FDA-approved supplier of HNK cells. Until early 1999, BioWhittaker imported HNK cells from a clinic 
in Cali, Colombia, and sold the cells for use in urokinase manufacturing. After purchasing lots of primary HNK cells from 
BioWhittaker, a manufacturer grew, cultivated, and purified the cells before using them in producing urokinase."
930,4," Urokinase (a broad subset of thrombolytics) is a ""plasminogen activator,"" namely, a substance that converts the human body's 
plasminogen into plasmin, which dissolves a key component of blood clots called thrombus or fibrin. See Genentech, Inc. v. 
Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, 989 F. Supp. 359, 361 (D. Mass. 1997)."
930,5," Only urokinase derived from tissue culture has been approved by FDA. Pl's Ex. 3 at 40; Pl's Ex. 4 at 67-68. Thus, urine-derived 
urokinase and recombinant urokinase are not relevant to this case."
930,6," Other companies (such as Genetech, Inc.) also produce thrombolytics. However, for purposes of this motion only, Defendants 
do not dispute Plaintiff's assertion that thrombolytics manufactured by other companies do not compete with Abbott's products."
930,7," Pl's Ex. 5 at 10, 36, 45-46, 71-74. Abbokinase also is used to treat blood clots in veins (deep vein thrombosis or ""DVT""), in

Pl's Ex. 24 at 197-98; Pl's Ex. 25. As part of the approval process for generic products, an applicant must submit an ""abbreviated 
new drug application"" (""ANDA"") to FDA. Approval through the ANDA process is less complicated and less time consuming than 
through a New Drug Application (""NDA"") process (the route by which Abbokinase was approved)."

931,15," For its initial product-development work, Microbix purchased one vial from one lot of HNK cells from BioWhittaker in 1995, and 
one vial each from four additional lots in 1996."
931,16, Buterbaugh is BioWhittaker's President and Chief Executive Officer.
931,17," During the meeting, Microbix and BioWhittaker also discussed an alternate supply source. Pl's Ex. 18 at 204, 213-14. 
Recognizing that a second source could take many years to qualify in view of the complex national and international regulatory 
requirements, BioWhittaker allegedly informed Microbix that there was no need to seek an alternate source, because 
BioWhittaker had a large inventory of cells, never had problems with supplying existing demands, and did not anticipate any 
problems in meeting future demands. Gastle Dec. P 12; Pl's Ex. 18 at 194-96. Buterbaugh also allegedly represented to Microbix 
that BioWhittaker would not sign an exclusive sales agreement with anyone. Id. Moreover, BioWhittaker allegedly authorized 
Microbix to reference its Drug Master File (""DMF"") at FDA for regulatory approval purposes. Sparkuhl Dec. P 7. "
932,18," In September 1996, Abbott learned of Microbix's generic urokinase project in a press release. Pl's Ex. 36 at A017525-28; Pl's 
Ex. 5 at 132-34. Abbott then retained two firms to investigate potential competitors. Id. The investigation identified Microbix as 
the only potential competitor of Abbott. Id. Abbott's marketing personnel had estimated that a generic urokinase would take away 
70 percent of the Abbokinase market share within 24 months and cause a 40 percent price reduction. Pl's Ex. 38 at A004679. 
Abbott then formed an ""Anti-Generics Task Force"" aimed at Microbix's urokinase project. Pl's Ex. 39 at A018116; Pl's Ex. 40 at 
9-12."
932,19," BioWhittaker did not inform Microbix about the agreement. The agreement (made retroactive to January 1, 1997) increased 
the price of HNK cells by more than 50 percent. Pl's Ex. 46. Although this was the first time Abbott had a formal agreement with BioWhittaker, Abbott's relationship with BioWhittaker dated 
back to the 1970s, when Abbott and BioWhittaker worked jointly to obtain FDA approval for the Cali, Colombia source of HNK 
cells. Defs' Ex. 21 at 111-12; Long Aff. at PP 9-10. From 1976 to 1995, Abbott was BioWhittaker's only customer for HNK cells 
for use in urokinase production. Buterbaugh Aff. P 6. Another example of historical Abbott-BioWhittaker collaboration is that the NDA approved by the FDA for Abbokinase includes 
procedures jointly developed by Abbott and BioWhittaker relating to the screening, harvesting, processing, importation, and 
testing of HNK cells. Long Aff. at PP 5, 10. Abbott and BioWhittaker also worked together throughout the 1980s and into the 
1990s to implement and update tests for viral and other types of contamination that could potentially be present in the cells. Id. 
at PP 12, 14."
932,20," For example, lots with less than 100 million cells were deemed non-conforming under Abbott's specifications, but under the 
agreement BioWhittaker agreed not to sell such lots to others. Apparently, the high cost of $ 397 per million cells reflects 
BioWhittaker's agreement to withold the non-conforming cells from the market and destroying them. Pl's Ex. 50."
932,21," The FDA's primary concern was the possible viral contamination of the HNK cells. Microbix and Gensia attempted to put 
together a plan to remedy the quality control issues bearing on contamination. Pl's Ex. 69 at GS30705. Microbix alleges that the 
FDA's concerns ""could be easily handled provided that the cell supplier cooperates."" Id. However, there is no evidence that 
either Microbix or Gensia approached BioWhittaker to request cooperation in addressing FDA concerns, or that BioWhittaker 
refused to cooperate. "
933,22," The deficiencies identified by the FDA included: (1) use of HIV and Hepatitis-C test kits that were not FDA-approved, and no 
assurance that testing for viruses was performed correctly by adequately trained personnel; (2) inadequate screening of mothers 
and neonates with respect to risk factors of infectious diseases; (3) failure to follow certain standard operating procedures 
identified in the Drug Master File; (4) use of shipping containers that had not been proven safe; (5) failure to monitor storage 
temperatures of HNK cells in liquid nitrogen; and (6) storage of cells in a manner that could allow them to become contaminated. 
Olsen Aff. at P 6; Defs' Ex. 54; Defs' Ex. 55."
933,23, See supra note 22 and accompanying text.
933,24," On July 14, 1999, the FDA issued Abbott a Warning Letter with respect to the same violations."
933,25," To alleviate the shortages of supplies, in January 1999, the FDA released nine lots of Abbokinase for sale by Abbott. 
However, on January 25, 1999, the FDA sent a letter to all health care providers concerning the status of Abbokinase, cautioning 
the providers to use Abbokinase only when absolutely necessary because of concerns related to potential for viral 
contamination. The FDA has not permitted Abbott to sell any additional urokinase. Thus, virtually all supplies available to 
physicians have been exhausted. "
934,26," Defs' Ex. 31 at 86, 121-36; Ex. 32 at GS40866-67; Ex. 34 at 301-07. Prior to the preliminary injunction, Gensia had informed 
Microbix that Gensia would feel ""comfortable with a three-year strategic supply of cells."" Defs' Ex. 31 at 69. Microbix President 
William Gastle (""Gastle"") later testified at his deposition that ""I assumed that based on the strength of the [May 13, 1998] 
preliminary injunction we had addressed [the cell-supply] issue."" Ex. 34 at 307. When Microbix informed Gensia that the Court 
had ordered BioWhittaker to sell Microbix enough HNK cells to produce a two- to three-year supply of product, Gensia 
concluded that the result was ""satisfactory."" Defs' Ex. 31 at 87."
934,27," Plaintiff alleges that Gensia expressed concern to Microbix that it ""may not have the raw material to produce ThromboClear in 
the long term,"" and thus Gensia was reluctant to invest ""large sums of money"" in view of the uncertainty concerning long-term 
HNK cell supply. Pl's Opp. at 22; Pl's Ex. 24 at 318-319. However, there is no evidence that the lack of long-term supply was a 
material or substantial reason for Gensia to re-consider the partnership with Microbix. To the contrary, it appears that Gensia 
Vice-President Thomas Speace's (""Speace"") testimony, read in context, indicates that Gensia was satisfied with a three-year 
supply granted under the May 13, 1998 preliminary injunction. See Pl's Ex. 24 at 67, 69, 87, 108-110, 115, 117-18, 126, 139, 
344-45, 397."
934,28," The FDA has informed Microbix that the commercial manufacturing facility must be ready for inspection by the agency at the 
time Microbix files its request for regulatory approval of the product. Defs' Ex. 39 at MBX014023; Defs' Ex. 40 at 228. At the May 
1998 hearing on the preliminary injunction motion, Gastle testified that if the Court granted Microbix the right to purchase 20 lots 
of HNK cells, it would be able to conclude a contract manufacturing agreement with CBM. Defs' Ex. 3 at 41:11-12, 44:18-45:1, 
47:24-48:3, 54:7-11. After the preliminary injunction was granted, however, Microbix failed to do so. Defs' Ex. 41 at 130-31, 204-
06. It appears that Microbix and CBM were unable to agree on certain financial guarantees and indemnification provisions that 
CBM was demanding. Def's Ex. 34 at 269-71, 300-03; Defs' Ex. 41 at 80-82, 130-31."
934,29," Microbix's subsequent attempts to enter into partnerships with other companies (such as American Pharmaceutical Partners, 
Inc.) failed. Pl's Ex. 65."
934,30," For present purposes, it is immaterial that the clinic may remain operational for other purposes. "
935,31," The Court has severed the claims made only against BioWhittaker (the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Causes of Action of the First 
Amended Complaint). Because these claims have been asserted in a separate lawsuit, Civil Action No. MJG-98-4094, which 
was filed on December 15, 1998, the Court shall dismiss these claims as duplicative in the instant case."
935,32," The parties agree that the unfair competition and tortious interference counterclaims are preempted by the Illinois Trade 
Secrets Act, upon which the theft of trade secrets counterclaim rests. See 765 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 1065/8 (West 1999)."
935,33," Plaintiff has moved for summary judgment on the remaining theft of trade secrets counterclaim. The Court shall resolve that 
motion separately."
935,34," Defendants have not moved for summary judgment on the Sixth Cause of Action (interference with economic relationships). 
However, as stated in the Court's February 14, 2000 letter to counsel, the viability of the interference claim depends upon the 
viability of the antitrust claims. See Feb. 14, 2000 Court's Letter to Counsel. Thus, to the extent that the interference claim will be 
discussed in this memorandum, the discussion will focus on the viability of the claim in view of the Court's ruling on the antitrust 
claims. See discussion below. "
936,35," The term ""'person' . . . shall be deemed to include corporations[.]"" 15 U.S.C. § 12(a) (West 1999). "

937,37, 15 U.S.C. § 15 (West 1999).
937,38," First Amend. Compl. at PP 48-57. The First Cause of Action also alleges that Defendants engaged in a group boycott in 
violation of section 1. Id. However, the Court shall not address the group boycott allegation, because Microbix does not raise this 
issue in its Opposition. Accordingly, the Court shall address only the allegation concerning a conspiracy in restraint of trade."
937,39," Examples of per se violations include price fixings and group boycotts. See, e.g., United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 
310 U.S. 150, 84 L. Ed. 1129, 60 S. Ct. 811 (1940) (price fixing); FTC v. Superior Court Trial Lawyers Ass'n, 493 U.S. 411, 107 
L. Ed. 2d 851, 110 S. Ct. 768 (1990) (group boycott)."
937,40," Vertical restraints involve contracts among parties at different levels in the production and marketing chain (for example, a 
manufacturer and a supplier of raw material), whereas horizontal restraints involve agreements among direct competitors. See, 
e.g., Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., 359 U.S. 207, 3 L. Ed. 2d 741, 79 S. Ct. 705 (1959); NYNEX Corp. v. Discon, 
Inc., 525 U.S. 128, 119 S. Ct. 493, 498, 142 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1998). "
938,41," The ""relevant market"" consists of the relevant geographic market and the relevant product market."
938,42," The primary concern of antitrust law is interbrand competition, not intrabrand competition.  GTE Sylvania, 433 U.S. at 39-48, 
52 n.19. The distinction between the effects of restrictive conduct on intrabrand competition and interbrand competition is that 
while intrabrand competition is competition among those who sell the product of a particular manufacturer, interbrand 
competition is ""competition among the manufacturers of the same generic product."" Id. at 52 n.19."
938,43," This case does not involve horizontal restraints such as price fixing. Therefore, the per se rule is inapplicable. See, e.g., 
Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. at 150."
938,44, It is undisputed that the relevant geographic market is the United States.
938,45," Because of Abbott's market power, the company's profits were substantial. See Pl's Ex. 11 at A009813-14. For purposes of 
this motion, Defendants do not dispute this fact."
938,46," The Court notes, but need not discuss, that for the same reasons that the exclusive supply agreement is an unreasonable 
restraint of trade under the quick-look rule of reason, the agreement also may be unreasonable as an exclusive-dealing 
arrangement that was intended to, and did, keep all potential competitors of Abbott out of the relevant market. See Jefferson 
Parish Hospital Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 45, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2, 104 S. Ct. 1551 (1984) (""In determining whether an 
exclusive-dealing contract is unreasonable, the proper focus is on the structure of the market for the products or services in 
question - the number of sellers and buyers in the market, the volume of their business, and the ease with which buyers and 
sellers can redirect their purchases or sales to others. Exclusive dealing is an unreasonable restraint on trade only when a 
significant fraction of buyers or sellers are frozen out of a market by the exclusive deal."") (citation omitted). "
939,47," Where, as here, there is no dispute over the actual conduct of defendants, the issue of whether the actions by defendants 
constitute an ""unreasonable"" restraint of trade is a question of law. See, e.g., Ferguson v. Greater Pocatello Chamber of 
Commerce, Inc., 848 F.2d 976 (9th Cir. 1988)."

941,52," First Amend. Compl. at PP 59-61. This section of the First Amended Complaint is entitled ""Conspiracy to Maintain Monopoly."" 
Id. The actual allegations, however, describe a cause of action for maintenance of monopoly by Abbott. Id. Moreover, although 
the Complaint alleges a ""Conspiracy to Monopolize,"" Plaintiff does not raise this issue in its Opposition. See Pl's Opp. at 47-48. 
Thus, the Court shall address only the maintenance issue."

are liable under the ""essential facility"" doctrine. First Amend. Compl. at PP 59-66. However, because Plaintiff does not raise the 
essential-facility issue in its Opposition, the Court shall not discuss the issue."

942,59," In Brunswick, the owners of several small bowling alleys claimed that a bowling equipment manufacturer (Brunswick) violated 
Section 7 of the Clayton Act by acquiring bankrupt bowling alleys that competed with plaintiffs.  Brunswick, 429 U.S. at 479-89. 
The plaintiffs argued that had Brunswick not intervened, the bankrupt bowling alleys would have left the market, enabling the 
plaintiffs to earn higher profits. Id. The Supreme Court rejected these claims, emphasizing that the asserted injury flowed not 
from any reduction in competition, but from competition itself. Id."
942,60," The Supreme Court provided guidance as to Plaintiff's burden of proof in Hazeltine: HN16[
] [Plaintiff's] burden of proving the fact of damages under § 4 of the Clayton Act is satisfied by its proof of some 
damages flowing from the unlawful conspiracy; inquiry beyond this minimum point goes only to the amount of the injury; a 
plaintiff need not exhaust all possible alternative sources of injury in fulfilling his burden of proving compensable injury 
under § 4. Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, 395 U.S. 100, 114 n.9, 89 S. Ct. 1562 23 L. Ed. 2d 129 (1969) (emphasis in original). 
However, HN17[
] even though a private plaintiff successfully proves an ""antitrust injury,"" recovery will be allowed only if 
Plaintiff can establish a theory of monetary damages by which the amount of injury suffered reasonably can be determined.  
Bigelow v. RKO Radio Pictures, Inc., 327 U.S. 251, 90 L. Ed. 652, 66 S. Ct. 574 (1946). The standard of proof required to 
ascertain the amount of damages is not as exacting as that required to prove the fact of damages (antitrust injury). Id. "
943,61," These damages include the milestone funding from Gensia, funding which was necessary to enable Microbix to accomplish 
basic tasks. Pl's Mem. at 36. Moreover, Microbix lost expected payments from Gensia, including payments owed for pilot 
urokinase batches delivered to Gensia but not paid. Id."
943,62," Since Plaintiff cannot prove such damages, there can be no recovery even if Plaintiff did sustain damages from the termination 
itself. Such damages, if not derived directly from the exclusive supply agreement, can only be recovered against Gensia. 
Apparently, Gensia and Microbix entered into a ""Settlement Agreement and Release"" concerning Gensia's termination of the 
partnership. See Defs' Ex. 38."
943,63," For example, it is undisputed that the FDA banned the import of HNK cells on September 18, 1998, and that Gensia 
terminated its partnership with Microbix after the ban, in November of 1998. In the absence of contrary evidence, a reasonable 
inference could be made that the FDA ban was a substantial factor contributing to the lack of long-term supply of HNK cells, 
which materially caused Gensia to end the partnership. "
944,64," In calculating these damages, Plaintiff's expert economist (Dr. Beyer) took into account the money owed to Microbix by Gensia 
under the Gensia-Microbix partnership."
944,65," These factors include, as discussed above, the FDA ban on HNK-cell import, the termination of the Gensia-Microbix 
partnership, and the closure of the Cali, Colombia cell source."
944,66, Causation is closely related to the antitrust injury element.

945,68," HN20[
] Rule 56(e) requires the party opposing a summary judgment to ""set forth specific facts"" establishing the presence of a genuine issue. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e) (emphasis added). Thus, expert affidavits or opinions must be based on specific facts. An 
expert's ""naked opinions,"" though admissible at trial, may not suffice to defeat summary judgment. See Mid-State Fertilizer Co. 
v. Exchange National Bank, 877 F.2d 1333 (7th Cir. 1989). In Mid-State Fertilizer, the plaintiff opposed summary judgment with an affidavit by a finance professor who opined that the 
defendant's practices were unreasonable and inappropriate.  Id. at 1339. The court granted summary judgment for the 
defendant and the Seventh Circuit affirmed, stating that the affiant ""presented nothing but conclusions - no facts, no hint of an 
inferential process, no discussion of hypotheses,"" whereas expert affidavits can defeat summary judgment only if they show ""a 
process of reasoning beginning from a firm foundation."" Id. See also Estate of Detwiler v. Offenbecher, 728 F. Supp. 103, 139-
40 (S.D.N.Y. 1989) (expert affidavits must be ""based upon specific facts""); In re ""Agent Orange"" Prod. Liab. Litig., 818 F.2d 187,

opinion""); Evers v. General Motors Corp., 770 F.2d 984, 986 (11th Cir. 1985) (expert affidavits cannot be based on ""conclusory 
allegations"")."

(""When an expert opinion is not supported by sufficient facts to validate it in the eyes of the law, or when indisputable record 
facts contradict or otherwise render the opinion unreasonable, it cannot support a jury's verdict."")."
946,71, It appears that the parties agree that Maryland law governs this claim. 
960,1," Conexant also argues that 3Com became a non-exclusive licensee in March 1999, which removes any shield from conspiracy 
liability conferred by Levi Case. See Def. Opp. at 9. However, Conexant has alleged conspiratorial acts occurring prior to March 
1999, at a time period when the exclusive license was still in effect."
960,2," At the hearing, Conexant represented that 3Com and Townshend are independent actors in that they have different interests 
with respect to the patented technology. 3Com, as a competitor in the market for products incorporating the patented 
technology, has an interest in excluding competitors, whereas Townshend, who does not manufacture or sell products 
incorporating the patented technology, does not share this interest. Townshend has represented that his interest in this action is 
to maximize the licensing revenue from his patents. "
961,3," Conexant alleges that ""the Townshend Licensing Proposal, along with other accompanying statements to the ITU, violated the 
rules of the TSB Patent Policy….3Com and Townshend ostensibly represented that Townshend was willing to negotiate licenses 
with other parties on a non-discriminatory basis."" Answer P 93."
961,4," Conexant has also alleged that 3Com and Townshend failed to disclose Townshend's trade secret action to the ITU prior to 
adoption of the V.90 standard. Conexant, the defendant in the trade secret action, was a member of the ITU during this time and 
has not alleged any injury to competition resulting from this failure to disclose. "
964,5," 3Com makes the additional argument that if the Court were to find that this conduct is anti-competitive, its actions before the 
ITO would be immune from suit in light of the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. This doctrine confers immunity for acts that would 
otherwise be considered anti-competitive if these acts are directed towards influencing government action. Given the Court's finding that the conduct alleged by Conexant does not state any anti-competitive conduct by 3Com before the 
ITU, the Court does not reach the issue of Noerr-Pennington immunity. "
965,6," Because Conexant has not demonstrated that it can allege injury to competition, any amendment to the other elements of a 
claim for attempted monopolization would be futile. "
966,7," As previously noted, Conexant cannot maintain a section 2 claim for monopolization of a ""technology"" market. "
986,1," The exception is not universally recognized. See, e.g., In re Beef Indus. Antitrust Litig., 600 F.2d 1148, 1159 (5th Cir. 1979) 
[hereinafter In re Beef] (declining to allow exception to Illinois Brick even though intermediary firms passing on indirect sellers' 
overcharges were alleged to participate in price-fixing conspiracy). A respected treatise observes that it matters little whether the doctrine is regarded as a co-conspirator ""exception"" to the Illinois 
Brick rule, or whether instead as simply placing the co-conspirator situation outside Illinois Brick's domain. See 2 Phillip E. 
Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P 371h at 264-65 (rev. ed. 1995). I will follow the convention of calling it a co-
conspirator exception. "
987,2," Judge Reynolds, in an earlier decision in this case, read Prescription Drug I as ""suggesting that the Seventh Circuit would only 
recognize the control, and not the co-conspirator, exception to the Illinois Brick rule."" Paper Sys. Inc. v. Mitsubishi Corp., 177 
F.R.D. 435, 438 (E.D. Wis. 1997). But the passage quoted is the extent of Judge Reynold's discussion of the issue; Fontana 
Aviation is not discussed, and this decision was issued before Prescription Drug II's reaffirmation of the conspirator language in 
Prescription Drug I. "
988,3," See 8 Phillip E. Areeda, Antitrust Law PP 1604-05 (1989). Dual distribution occurs when a manufacturer simultaneously sells 
to independent dealers and to those who might otherwise be customers of those dealers. See id. P 1605a at 78. A dealer cartel 
arises when intermediary dealers coerce unwilling manufacturers to adopt restraints on distribution that bring the dealers more 
profit than necessary for efficient distribution. See id. P 1604a at 38. In the Ambook case, the alleged coercion was the 
advertising agencies' threat that unless the media outlets agreed, they would steer their customers' ads elsewhere. "
991,*," This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 
Ninth Cir. R. 36-3. "
1001,1," The defendant filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on May 6, 1999, and an Amended Motion for Summary Judgment on July 
19, 1999. For purposes of this opinion, the court will treat the two motions as a single motion for summary judgment. "
1002,2," Subsequent to the events underlying this litigation, Northwest Medical Center, Inc. sold the hospital to an entity not a party to 
this action. Thus, the sole defendant no longer owns or operates the hospital."
1002,3," The evidence submitted in Defendant's Evid. Sub. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. will hereinafter be identified with a DX and the 
corresponding number of the exhibit."
1002,4," Under Alabama law, all information furnished to any peer review committee, and any findings, conclusions, or 
recommendations by a peer review committee, are privileged and not available for discovery. Ala. Code § 6-5-333; see also Ala. 
Code § 34-24-58. In this case, because Dr. Chalal alleged that the Hospital conducted peer review improperly, the parties 
agreed that the hospital was entitled to utilize confidential peer review material in its defense of Dr. Chalal's claims, subject to a 
protective order preventing this peer review material from being utilized outside of this proceeding. On March 16, 1999, the court 
entered such a protective order. Accordingly, this opinion does not discuss the specifics of any peer review material or findings 
involved in this case. The court's decision, however, is based on a full review of the relevant peer review materials submitted 
under seal. "
1004,5," HN1[
]  42 U.S.C. § 11133 provides that ""each health care entity which. . . takes a professional review action that adversely affects the clinical privileges of a physician for a period longer than 30 days . . . shall report [such] to the Board of Medical 
Examiners. . . ."" Similarly, HN2[
] Ala. Code § 34-24-59(a) provides that ""the chief administrative officer of each hospital shall report to the Alabama State Board of Medical Examiners any disciplinary action taken concerning any physician when the action 
is related to professional ethics, medical incompetence, moral turpitude, or drug or alcohol abuse."" Further, ""the individual 
making the report shall be immune from liability."" Ala. Code § 34-24-59(c). Under HCQIA, all such reports are included in the 
National Practitioner Data Bank, a national information clearinghouse established by HCQIA ""to restrict the ability of incompetent 
physicians to move from State to State without disclosure or discovery of the physician's previous damaging or incompetent 
performance."" 42 U.S.C. § 11101; see also 42 U.S.C. §§ 11133-34. "
1005,6," As discussed more fully below, the court granted the Hospital's motion to strike these affidavits for failure to comply with 
discovery deadlines. Even if the affidavits are considered, however, as a matter of law they do not support the claims against the 
Hospital."
1005,7," The Complaint was originally filed in state court, but defendant removed the case to this court based on federal question 
jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1331."
1005,8," Although the Complaint is somewhat vague, Plaintiff's Response in Opposition to Defendant's Amended Motion for Summary 
Judgment explains that his antitrust claim is for violation of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1."
1005,9," Specifically, HCQIA provides as follows: HN4[
] If a professional review action . . . of a professional review body meets all the standards specified in section"
1005,11112," (a) of this title, . . . (A) the professional review body, (B) any person acting as a member or staff to the body, "
1006,," (C) any person under a contract or other formal agreement with the body, and (D) any person who participates with or assists the body with respect to the action, shall not be liable in damages under any law of the United States or of any State (or political subdivision thereof) with 
respect to the action."
1006,42, U.S.C. § 11111(a)(1). 
1012,10," Dr. Chalal also offers no support for his claim that the release was a ""general release"" which would have absolved the Hospital 
of any liability from its credentials decision. A cursory reading of the release shows that it is not a general release but rather is a 
limited release of liability arising out of sending the negative letter of reference. The release expressly states that it relates to 
""any liability in connection with the attached letter of reference,"" and, accordingly, Dr. Chalal's assertion that the release was a 
""general release"" is factually incorrect."
1012,11," Supplementation of disclosures and discovery were due by June 1, 1999, and all discovery was ordered to be complete as of 
June 30, 1999. "
1014,12," In light of the absence of damages, the court need not reach defendant's argument that the statements were conditionally 
privileged under Alabama law. See Fulton v. Advertiser Co., 388 So. 2d 533, 537 (Ala. 1980)."
1014,13," Plaintiff alleges in his Complaint and in his brief submitted to the court that defendant monopolized or attempted to monopolize 
medical services. (Complaint at 10-11, P 36; Pl.'s Response in Opp. to Def.'s Amended Mot. for Summ. J. at 14-15.) However, 
plaintiff only cites Section 1 of the Sherman Act for the basis of his claim and offers no evidence whatsoever relating to the 
elements necessary to support a claim of monopolization. It is clear that both parties agree that any claims relating to antitrust 
violations fall within section 1 of the Sherman Act. Therefore, any claims pertaining to monopolization are due to be dismissed. "
1015,14," In Bolt v. Halifax Hosp. Medical Center, the defendants were hospitals and members of their medical staff. However, the 
medical staff members were not employees of the hospitals, but were physicians who practiced medicine in their individual 
capacities. Thus, each was a ""separate economic entity potentially in competition with other physicians."" Todorov, 921 F.2d at 
1455 n. 29 (citing Bolt v. Halifax Hosp. Medical Center, 891 F.2d 810, 819 (11th Cir. 1991))."
1015,15," Normally, when a court concludes that no violation has occurred, it has no occasion to consider standing. See Levine, 72 F.3d 
at 1545 (citing 2 Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P 360f, at 202-203 (rev. Ed. 1995)). However, in this 
case, the court will consider standing in the alternative. "
1017,16," Even if Dr. Chalal had pursued injunctive relief, defendant no longer owns or operates the hospital, and thus the court could 
not provide the equitable relief plaintiff seeks. (Chalal Dep. at 16-17.) "
1022,1," Acoustic's amended complaint contained the following counts of anticompetitive conduct and business torts: Count I (attempted 
monopolization, 15 U.S.C. § 2 (Sherman Act)); Count II (predatory pricing and price discrimination, 15 U.S.C. §§ 22(A) & 13(A) 
(Clayton Act)); Count III (per se tying and restraint of trade, 15 U.S.C. § 1 (Sherman Act)); Count IV (declaratory judgment of 
patent invalidity); Count V (patent misuse); Count VI (false patent marking, 35 U.S.C. § 292); Count VII (attempted 
monopolization -- Walker Process antitrust, 15 U.S.C. § 2 (Sherman Act)); Count VIII (attempted monopolization -- Kobe 
antitrust, 15 U.S.C. § 2 (Sherman Act)); Count IX (tortious interference with contractual relations); Count X (tortious interference 
with prospective business relations); Count XI (commercial defamation); Count XII (per se trade slander and libel); Count XIII 
(false description and unfair competition, 15 U.S.C. § 1125); Count XIV (violation of Texas Public School Contract Statute); 
Count XV (common law unfair competition); Count XVI (injury to business reputation, Tex. Bus. & Com. Code § 16.29); Count 
XVII (unfair practices, Tex. Bus. & Com. Code § 15.05); and Count XVIII (conspiracy). "
1023,2," Because we conclude that the district court's order denying summary judgment is not an immediately appealable collateral 
order, it is neither necessary nor appropriate to decide whether exclusive appellate jurisdiction would otherwise lie in the Federal 
Circuit under 28 U.S.C. § 1295 due to Acoustic's Walker Process, Kobe antitrust, and false patent marking claims. See 
Scherbatskoy v. Halliburton Co., 125 F.3d 288, 290-91 (5th Cir. 1997)(under § 1295 the Federal Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction 
to review a district court's final decision if that court's jurisdiction was based in whole or in part on 28 U.S.C. 1338(a), i.e., where 
the complaint includes allegations that federal patent law creates the cause of action or federal patent law is a necessary 
element of the claim); Natec, Inc. v. Deter Co., 28 F.3d 28 (5th Cir. 1994)(same). In Scherbatskoy and Natec, Inc., we 
transferred to the Federal Circuit appeals from such final decisions after concluding that the district courts had exercised subject 
matter jurisdiction under § 1338(a). See 125 F.3d at 291; 28 F.3d at 29. In the instant case, however, there is neither a final 
decision nor an immediately appealable collateral order. Thus we do not enjoy even the preliminary jurisdiction to determine 
whether the district court operated under its grant of jurisdiction in § 1338(a), and, therefore, we do not pass upon the 
applicability of § 1295. "
1025,3," Though the state action doctrine is often labeled an immunity, that term is actually a misnomer because the doctrine is but a 
recognition of the limited reach of the Sherman Act which does ""not undertake to prohibit a sovereign state from imposing an 
anticompetitive restraint as an act of government."" Martin, 86 F.3d at 1395 (citing Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 352, 87 L. Ed. 
315, 63 S. Ct. 307 (1942)); see also Surgical Care Center of Hammond, L.C. v. Hospital Serv. Dist. No. 1 Of Tangipahoa Parish, 
171 F.3d 231, 234 (5th Cir. 1999)(en banc)(""'Parker immunity' is more accurately a strict standard for locating the reach of the 
Sherman Act than the judicial creation of a defense to liability for its violation.""). "
1041,1," HN8[
] Proof that the defendant's conduct was motivated by a desire to prevent other firms from competing on the merits can 
contribute to a finding that the conduct has had, or will have, the intended, exclusionary effect. See United States v. United 
States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422, 436 n.13, 57 L. Ed. 2d 854, 98 S. Ct. 2864 (1978) (""consideration of intent may play an 
important role in divining the actual nature and effect of the alleged anticompetitive conduct""). "
1044,2," While Microsoft is correct that some courts have also recognized the right of a copyright holder to preserve the ""integrity"" of 
artistic works in addition to those rights enumerated in the Copyright Act, the Court nevertheless concludes that those cases, 
being actions for infringement without antitrust implications, are inapposite to the one currently before it. See, e.g., WGN 
Continental Broadcasting Co. v. United Video, Inc., 693 F.2d 622 (7th Cir. 1982); Gilliam v. ABC, Inc., 538 F.2d 14 (2d Cir. 
1976). "
1050,3," Microsoft contends that Windows and Internet Explorer represent a single ""integrated product,"" and that the relevant market is 
a unitary market of ""platforms for software applications."" Microsoft's Proposed Conclusions of Law at 49 n.28."
1050,4," In Microsoft II the D.C. Circuit acknowledged it was without benefit of a complete factual record which might alter its conclusion 
that the ""Windows 95/IE package is a genuine integration."" 147 F.3d at 952. "
1051,5," Most of the quantitative evidence was presented in units other than monetary, but numbered the units in millions, whatever 
their nature. "
1052,6," Amicus curiae Lawrence Lessig has suggested that a corollary concept relating to the bundling of ""partial substitutes"" in the 
context of software design may be apposite as a limiting principle for courts called upon to assess the compliance of these 
products with antitrust law. This Court has been at pains to point out that the true source of the threat posed to the competitive 
process by Microsoft's bundling decisions stems from the fact that a competitor to the tied product bore the potential, but had not 
yet matured sufficiently, to open up the tying product market to competition. Under these conditions, the anticompetitive harm 
from a software bundle is much more substantial and pernicious than the typical tie. See X Phillip E. Areeda, Einer Elhauge & 
Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P 1747 (1996). A company able to leverage its substantial power in the tying product market 
in order to force consumers to accept a tie of partial substitutes is thus able to spread inefficiency from one market to the next, 
id. at 232 and thereby ""sabotage a nascent technology that might compete with the tying product but for its foreclosure from the 
market."" III Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P 1746.1d at 495 (Supp. 1999). "

1055,10," The omission of the District of Columbia from this finding was an oversight on the part of the Court; Microsoft obviously 
conducts business in the District of Columbia as well. "
1061,1," Given the lengthy history of this litigation, and the parties' presumed familiarity with the procedural and factual background, the 
Court will dispense with the need to include them in this Opinion. "
1062,2," The Independent Distributors insist that the discount was not actually tied to volume purchases. However, at this juncture I am 
required to accept as true all representations made by the non-moving parties, and to resolve all reasonable inferences in their 
favor. The Beer World stores and Fuhrer have represented that the discounts were tied to volume purchases. "
1063,3," In Rossi, the Third Circuit court compared a ""rule of reason"" analysis with a ""per se"" analysis, noting that HN7[
] in a rule of 
reason case, a plaintiff must prove: ""(1) that the defendants contracted, combined or conspired among each other; (2) that the 
combination or conspiracy produced adverse, anticompetitive effects within the relevant product and geographic markets; (3) 
that the objects of and the conduct pursuant to that contract or conspiracy were illegal; and (4) that the plaintiffs were injured as 
a proximate result of that conspiracy."" Rossi, 156 F.3d at 464-65. The court further explained that, where a per se analysis 
applies, ""prongs two and three are conclusively presumed satisfied and need not be addressed,"" Id., and so the court need only 
consider the existence of genuine issues of material fact regarding concerted action and causation. "
1068,1," This Court was faced with the issue but did not decide it in Quark, Inc. v. Harley, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 3864, Nos. 96-1046, 
96-1048, 96-1061, 1998 WL 161035, at **7 (10th Cir. March 4. 1998) (unpublished order and judgment) (""Assuming, without 
deciding, that this circuit would extend the doctrine beyond the realm of antitrust litigation . . . ."")"
1068,2," Pennington extended this immunity to the right to petition the executive and California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking 
Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508, 30 L. Ed. 2d 642, 92 S. Ct. 609 (1972), further extended the doctrine to cover petitioning the courts, the 
third branch of government. "
1069,3," See also Aaron R. Gary, First Amendment Petition Clause Immunity from Tort Suits: In Search of a Consistent Doctrinal 
Framework, 33 Idaho L. Rev. 67, 95 (1996) (""Innumerable federal and state courts have concluded that the Noerr-Pennington 
doctrine is rooted in the First Amendment right to petition and therefore must be applied to all claims implicating that right, not 
just to antitrust claims."")."
1069,4," Bill Johnson's is a good example of the need to distinguish between antitrust cases based upon the two prongs of Noerr-
Pennington and non-antitrust cases based solely on the right to petition. The dissent characterizes Bill Johnson's as a direct 
application of Noerr-Pennington. However, such a characterization would lead to a direct conflict between Bill Johnson's and 
Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc. v. Columbia Pictures, Inc., (PRE), 508 U.S. 49, 123 L. Ed. 2d 611, 113 S. Ct. 1920 
(1993). Noerr-Pennington immunity, as defined in all of the Noerr antitrust line of cases, is immunity from liability. PRE, in the 
context of antitrust, held that a lawsuit is immune from liability unless it is a sham (i.e. objectively unreasonable or reasonable 
but brought in bad faith). See 508 U.S. at 60. However, in Bill Johnson's, the Supreme Court specifically declared, in the context 
of an NLRA dispute, that an employer who brought a non-sham suit could still be held liable, even though the right to petition 
protected the suit from being enjoined.  461 U.S. at 748-49. The conflict is apparent. Under the PRE standard, a plaintiff is immune from liability based upon a simple showing of objective 
reasonableness. Under Bill Johnson's, objective reasonableness is not enough and a court must further determine whether the "
1070,," plaintiff violated the law in bringing the suit. The only way to reconcile these cases is to limit them to the contexts in which they 
arose. PRE is an antitrust case; Bill Johnson's is not. This distinction is important for two reasons. First, it cautions against describing Bill Johnson's as an application of Noerr-
Pennington immunity rather than Petition Clause immunity. Second, and more importantly, it demonstrates that PRE must be 
limited to the antitrust context. Outside of that context, the Petition Clause protects objectively reasonable lawsuits from being 
enjoined, but requires a court to look at the underlying statute to determine whether the initiator of the suit can be held liable. 
Therefore, given the non-antitrust context of this case, the dissent's reliance on PRE in Part II, C is inapposite."
1070,5," The same is true of McGuire Oil Co. v. Mapco, Inc., 958 F.2d 1552 (11th Cir. 1992), an antitrust case which relied upon Coastal 
States in granting immunity to threats of litigation. Although the Eleventh Circuit mentioned the right to petition as one basis for 
Noerr-Pennington immunity, it specifically protected the threats of litigation under an interpretation of the Sherman Act. See 
McGuire Oil, 958 F.2d at 1560 (holding that ""threats, no less than the actual initiation of litigation, do not violate the Sherman 
Act""). "
1071,6," The dissent does not address this plain language, but instead relies upon the concept of ""breathing space,"" the interest of 
private parties in vindicating their legal rights, and public policy arguments in arguing that such private threats should be 
constitutionally protected. "
1072,7," We acknowledge that Allied Tube is an antitrust case applying Noerr-Pennington and are therefore careful to distinguish 
between propositions grounded solely on the Sherman Act and those also grounded in the right to petition."
1072,8," We also note in passing that an almost identical claim to that raised in this case was presented in Continental Ore Co. v. Union 
Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 695, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777, 82 S. Ct. 1404 (1962) (plaintiffs claimed that ""defendants in 1943, 
by open threats of reprisals, allegedly frustrated certain arrangements which Continental had with the Climax Molybdenum 
Corporation for the manufacture of ferrovanadium.""). Noerr immunity was discussed by the Court but was not mentioned in 
regard to this claim. "
1074,9," I therefore reject the Fifth Circuit's assertion that Noerr ""was not a first amendment decision."" Coastal States Mktg., Inc. v. 
Hunt, 694 F.2d 1358, 1364-65 (5th Cir. 1983). Indeed, the Fifth Circuit itself has taken inconsistent positions. See Video Int'l 
Prod., Inc. v. Warner-Amex Cable Communications, Inc., 858 F.2d 1075, 1083 (5th Cir. 1988) (holding that the purpose of the 
Noerr-Pennington doctrine is to protect the First Amendment right to petition the government). "
1075,10," Nor is the application of petitioning immunity limited to associational or political activity. The Court has long held that ""the 
grievances for redress of which the right of petition was insured, and with it the right of assembly, are not solely religious or 
political ones."" Thomas v. Collins, 323 U.S. 516, 531, 89 L. Ed. 430, 65 S. Ct. 315 (1945); see also Illinois State Bar Ass'n, 
389 U.S. at 223 (rejecting the contention that ""the principles announced in Button were applicable only to litigation for political 
purposes"") (citing Brotherhood of R.R. Trainmen v. Virginia, 377 U.S. 1, 8, 12 L. Ed. 2d 89, 84 S. Ct. 1113 (1964)). For example, 
in Bill Johnson's Restaurants, 461 U.S. at 743, the Court afforded immunity to an individual litigant seeking to vindicate private 
economic interests. Although in Martin v. City of Del City, 179 F.3d 882, 886 (10th Cir. 1999), we held that a government 
employee alleging he was terminated in retaliation for petitioning for the redress of grievances must show that the petition 
touches on matters of public concern, Martin's public concern requirement is inapplicable here because it was developed in light 
of the government's substantial interest in maintaining an efficient workplace."
1075,11," To the extent Grip Pak, Inc. v. Illinois Tool Works, Inc., 694 F.2d 466, 471-72 (7th Cir. 1982), holds to the contrary, I would 
reject the holding of that case. We also note that another panel of that circuit overlooked or ignored the Grip Pak decision in 
reaching a result consistent with our own. See Havoco of Am., Ltd., 702 F.2d at 649-50. "
1077,12," This immediate association with the judicial process distinguishes the Champs letter from the activity at issue in Allied Tube 
and Conduit Corp., 486 U.S. at 492. The Court in Allied held that efforts to influence the standard-setting process of a private 
trade association did not enjoy Noerr immunity. See id. at 509-10. However, it ""expressly limited [its holding] to cases where an 
economically interested party exercises decisionmaking authority in formulating a product standard for a private association that 
comprises market participants,"" id. at 511 n.13 (citation and internal quotations omitted), indicating that this holding would not 
encompass, and therefore not preclude from immunity, efforts to influence ""all private standard-setting associations."" Id. With 
such repeated and explicit limitations, it is clear the Court did not foreclose the application of immunity to all indirect petitioning 
activities, such as to non-governmental associations as in Allied, or, as here, to cease-and-desist letters. On the contrary, as 
discussed, the Court emphasized a ""claim of Noerr immunity cannot be dismissed on the ground that the conduct at issue 
involved no 'direct' petitioning of government officials, for Noerr itself immunized a form of 'indirect' petitioning."" Id. at 503 
(citation omitted). "
1078,13," Bill Johnson's Restaurants went on to hold that the employee could proceed with his or her unfair labor practices case if the 
employer did not prevail in its state law claim.  461 U.S. at 747. "
1079,14," Contrary to the majority's suggestion, McDonald's conclusion that individuals do not enjoy absolute immunity from state 
common law claims arising from statements made in petitions to the government does not mean that there is no constitutional 
protection from such claims. Rather, McDonald makes it clear that state libel actions arising from petitioning activity cannot 
proceed unless the elements of libel are consistent with the constitutionally-mandated actual malice standard.  472 U.S. at 484-
85."
1079,15," To the extent a libel claim is based on assertions in a cease-and-desist letter other than the legal and factual bases for the 
allegations of infringement and threats of litigation, the McDonald standard might be appropriate. "
1086,1," Defendants assert that Mid-Hudson is an Article 28 hospital. The State disagrees. Records show that the State Department of 
Health recognized the defendants' application to establish Mid-Hudson as an application to establish ""a new Article 28 hospital,"" 
(McCareins Decl., Ex. 4), but Mid-Hudson has no physical plant of its own. "
1088,2," Defendants also cite minutes prepared by defendants of meetings between the hospitals and the DOH which report that 
division of services between the hospitals was discussed. However, to the extent that these minutes record defendants' own 
statements, they are self-serving hearsay and can be accorded no weight. "
1092,3," Defendants claim that 40 percent of their rates are still regulated. (Defs. Mem. Supp. Summ. J. at 11 n. 11.) The State counters 
that Medicaid rates ""are the prices that the government as the purchaser agrees to pay; they are not regulated rates for all 
hospital services."" (Pl. Mem. Opp. Summ. J. at 8.) "
1093,4," HN8[
] The Donnelly Act declares: ""Every contract, agreement, arrangement or combination whereby . . . competition or the 
free exercise of any activity in the conduct of any business, trade or commerce or in the furnishing of any service in this state is 
or may be restrained . . . to be against public policy, illegal and void."" N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law § 340(1). The Donnelly Act was 
modeled on the federal Sherman Act of 1890 and New York courts have found that state antitrust law ""should generally be 
construed in light of Federal precedent and given a different interpretation only where State policy, differences in the statutory 
language or the legislative history justify such a result."" New York v. Rattenni, 81 N.Y.2d 166, 613 N.E.2d 155, 158, 597 
N.Y.S.2d 280 (N.Y. 1993) (internal citations and quotations omitted). "
1095,5," Marianne Muise, defendants' lead negotiator with third-party payers, states in her deposition that behavioral health services at 
St. Francis were not always the subject of joint negotiations and that services offered at Vassar Brothers and proscribed by the 
Catholic Church such as sterilization procedures and abortions were also exempt from joint negotiations. (See Pl. Rule 56.1 
Stmt., Ex. 6 at 135-39.) "
1097,6," As will be discussed infra in Part III.C., such is not the case here. "
1101,7," The Court impliedly upheld the continuing validity of Georgia in Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co. of Cal., 405 U.S. 251, 92 S. Ct. 885, 
890, 31 L. Ed. 2d 184 (1972). "
1108,1," MLS and its members may sometimes hereinafter be referred to collectively as the ""MLS defendants."" "
1109,2," The league itself is authorized by the MLS Agreement to operate teams directly and currently operates two teams (the Dallas 
Burn and the Tampa Bay Mutiny)."
1109,3, Operators retain security interests in team trademarks. 
1111,4," HN6[
] Both corporations and partnerships are strongly presumed to be single entities for the purposes of § 1. See Philip E. Areeda, Antitrust Law P 1476d (1986)."
1111,5," In addition, some courts have held, in non-antitrust contexts, that LLCs more closely resemble corporations than partnerships. 
See Exchange Point LLC v. S.E.C., 100 F. Supp. 2d 172, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8766, 1999 WL 386736, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) 
(finding LLC to be more similar to wholly owned corporation than partnership and thus not a person for the purposes of the Right 
to Financial Privacy Act of 1978); Poore v. Fox Hollow Enterprises, 1994 Del. Super. LEXIS 193, 1994 WL 150872, at *2 (Del. 
Super. Ct. March 8, 1994) (LLCs sufficiently resemble corporations such that the same rules which require Delaware 
corporations to retain Delaware counsel to represent them in state courts also apply to LLCs.). Admittedly, these decisions do not conclusively determine the matter, since the question whether an organization may be liable 
for a conspiracy in restraint of trade is different from the questions these cases addressed. See Bell Atlantic Bus. Sys. Servs. v. 
Hitachi Data Sys. Corp., 849 F. Supp. 702, 707 (N.D. Cal. 1994) (""Plaintiff's attempt to equate [Sherman Act] § 1 conspiracy 
liability with alter ego liability fails because § 1 deals with federal antitrust policies and the alter ego doctrine is governed by 
California corporation law. The two legal principles have different purposes and policy considerations.""); compare De Castro v. 
Sanifill, Inc., 198 F.3d 282, 283 (1st Cir. 1999) (wholly-owned subsidiary's activities did not confer personal jurisdiction over 
parent) with Copperweld, 467 U.S. at 753 (no § 1 liability for parent or wholly-owned subsidiary because the two corporations 
were a single entity for antitrust purposes). Nonetheless, the cases do illustrate how courts generally understand the LLC structure to be like that of a corporation and 
generally apply legal rules applicable to corporations to LLCs as well. "
1112,6," Egan v. Athol Mem. Hosp., 971 F. Supp. 37 (D. Mass. 1997), and Benjamin v. Aroostook Med. Ctr., 937 F. Supp. 957 (D. Me. 
1996), rejected hospital-physician conspiracy claims similar to the one at issue in Oksanen. Neither case turned on a square 
assessment and application of the independent personal stake doctrine."
1112,7," Any number of businesses, from restaurants to car dealerships to law firms, require their employees and agents to individually 
assume certain operational costs and reward them with commissions directly tied to individual performance. That such 
arrangements may reflect incomplete unity of interest is immaterial, see Chicago Prof'l Sports, 95 F.3d 593 at 598 (Complete 
unity of interest test ""would be silly. Even a single firm contains many competing interests.""). One would be hard pressed to say 
that this rather routine business practice scrambles the economic interests within the firm in such a way as to open it up to § 1 
scrutiny. See Siegel Transfer, Inc. v. Carrier Express, Inc., 54 F.3d 1125, 1135 (3d Cir. 1995) (company in charge of freight 
broker's day-to-day operations was paid on percentage of broker's revenue; held that this encouraged efficient operation and 
made broker and operations company inseparable for § 1 purposes); Coast Cities Truck Sales v. Navistar Int'l Transp. Co., 912 
F. Supp. 747, 765 (D.N.J. 1995) (truck manufacturer and associated dealerships were single entity even though each dealership 
operator received bonus tied to dealership's individual performance)."
1112,8," Giving operators discretion over certain aspects of their duties while withholding it in other areas does not itself reflect disunity 
of interest. See Williams v. I.B. Fischer, 794 F. Supp. 1026, 1031 (D. Nev. 1992) (franchiser and franchisees held to be single 
entity for purposes of restraint on poaching other franchisees' managers; franchisees' control over local pricing decisions did not 
establish lack of unity of interest). "
1113,9," The plaintiffs argue that the operators, since they sit on MLS's Management Committee, are not MLS agents in this regard. 
That argument fails. Shareholders--even ones in positions of control--are not disqualified from serving as an agent of the 
corporation, see, e.g., Ed Peters Jewelry Co. v. C & J Jewelry Co., 124 F.3d 252, 275 (1st Cir. 1997). "
1114,10," The plaintiffs rely heavily on Sullivan, which rejected the NFL's argument that its teams had sufficient unity of interest to make 
the league a single entity under Copperweld. Sullivan does little to aid the plaintiffs because the NFL, despite certain similarities, 
is fundamentally different from MLS. The NFL is a confederation fused from agreements among preexisting, independently 
owned teams; unlike MLS, NFL football clubs do not exist as part of an overarching corporate structure. As explained in the text 
infra, MLS cannot be subjected to the wide-ranging analysis of economic interests that has been applied to the NFL.  United 
States Football League v. NFL, 842 F.2d 1335 (2d Cir. 1988); Los Angeles Mem'l Coliseum Comm'n v. NFL, 726 F.2d 1381 (9th 
Cir. 1984); and North American Soccer League v. NFL, 670 F.2d 1249 (2d Cir. 1982), are distinguishable for the same reason. "
1115,11," See Copperweld, 467 U.S. at 776 (""The appropriate inquiry . . . is not whether the coordinated conduct of a parent and its 
wholly owned subsidiary may ever have anticompetitive effects . . . . Nor is it whether the term 'conspiracy' will bear a literal 
construction that includes parent corporations and their wholly owned subsidiaries. For if these were the proper inquiries, a 
single firm's conduct would be subject to § 1 scrutiny whenever the coordination of two employees was involved. Such a rule 
would obliterate the Act's distinction between unilateral and concerted conduct, contrary to the clear intent of Congress, as 
interpreted by the weight of judicial authority.""). "
1122,1," Burke also alleged the Department violated his right to equal protection and imposed cruel and unusual punishment. The trial 
court aptly disposed of Burke's equal protection claim, noting Burke did not allege he was treated differently than other inmates. 
See Lyon v. Farrier, 730 F.2d 525, 527 (8th Cir. 1984). Burke's cruel and unusual punishment allegation does not merit 
discussion. "
1123,2," Although Burke does not specify which regulations he is challenging, the record contains two Department memorandums 
regarding inmate property policies. One indicates inmates will be prohibited from receiving packages, from possessing more 
than a designated number of certain electronic items, and from possessing certain types of property. The other indicates inmates 
will be permitted to order items approved by the property officer and not available at the commissary and ""all other items will be 
stocked, or can be ordered from the commissary when out of stock."" "
1124,3," In Dasovick, we reversed the dismissal of an inmate's suit for damages and equitable relief against individual prison 
authorities. 506 N.W.2d 386, 393-94 (N.D. 1993). The inmate alleged prison authorities' refusal to provide him with eyeglasses 
caused him serious eye damage.  Id. at 388. Acknowledging deliberate indifference to a prisoner's serious medical needs 
violates the eighth amendment, we concluded the inmate had stated a valid claim.  Id. at 390-91. We further noted ""generally, a 
clear constitutional right to the performance of an act cannot be decided on the pleadings alone"" and concluded the inmate may 
be entitled to injunctive relief against individual prison authorities. Id. at 392. Burke has failed to raise a valid constitutional claim. "

which utilize the EX 2000. Kocinski Tr. 2/7:172. Mr. Kocinski believes that there was some confusion as to whether Defendant's

In DX 9, the EX 2000 average selling price went from $ 343.73 to $ 483.44 in the four months following the introduction of the

invokes purely functional terms, without the additional recital of specific structure or material for performing that function.  Cole v. 
Kimberly-Clark Corp., 102 F.3d 524, 531, 41 U.S.P.Q.2D (BNA) 1001 (Fed. Cir. 1996). Although § 112 P6 is classically invoked 
when the patent claim recites ""means for,"" use of the language ""means to"" has also invoked a § 112 P6 analysis. See Cyber,

1186,741," The fact that an accused device that only infringes during certain times of operation nonetheless infringes has been long 
accepted. If devices ""were designed so that they could be operated normally in an infringing way, it would seem to be immaterial 
that some customers did not choose at times to operate them in that manner."" Stearns-Roger Mfg. Co. v. Ruth, 87 F.2d 35, 38

unnecessary to my disposition in any event."
1187,743," IMS involved a means-plus-function claim for a control system for machine tools. One limitation was an ""interface means for 
transferring a control program"" to and from an external medium, the corresponding structure of which was disclosed as a tape 
cassette. The accused device used a floppy disk instead, which the Federal Circuit held was an equivalent structure. It reasoned 
that the physical characteristics of the interface means were unimportant and incidental to the invention, which was ""directed to 
an apparatus that permits interactive programming of a machine tool."" Id. at *13. Here, in contrast, the differences between the 
structures affect the operation of the claimed method itself, e.g., fixed versus variable capacitance and linearity versus 
nonlinearity. For this reason, IMS, upon which plaintiff relies, is distinguishable. "

1202,768," But cf.  Bridwell, 103 F.3d at 975-76. Where the presumption of irreparable harm applies, the mere fact that plaintiff's injuries 
are monetarily compensable is insufficient rebuttal."
1202,769," I also note that Sunrise granted Puritan Bennett a license under the '303 Patent, which, even though it was in settlement of 
litigation, tends to suggest that infringement can be recompensed with money damages. See High Tech, 49 F.3d at 1557; 
Bridwell, 103 F.3d at 976. Given the probable infringement of only the '224 Patent, however, I find that the '303 Patent license is 
not persuasive on the existence vel non of irreparable harm arising out of the '224 Patent, which has never been licensed. "
1204,770," Plaintiff, but not defendant, consented to merge the preliminary injunction proceeding with the trial on the merits. Accordingly, 
the two proceedings are not merged, and the case must therefore, absent settlement, continue through dispositive motions or 
trial. "
1217,1," Defendant Global Technologies, Inc. was dismissed without prejudice on the plaintiff's motion. (Doc. 89)"
1217,2, The plaintiff's motion for leave to file a brief in excess of the page limit (Doc. 119) is granted.

1218,4," The parties agree that, for purposes of the present motions for summary judgment, Dresser Industries, Indresco and The 
Dresser Tool Group may be referred to as ""Intool."""

175 Ill. Dec. 98 (Ill. App. 1992), long before the 1974 Distributor Agreement was executed. "
1222,7," The plaintiff's reliance on Intool's distribution of its annual price list is an even less reliable indicator of an agreement that Tool-
Smith would not receive more favorable pricing."
1222,8," Mr. Patterson was unhappy because he would not receive credit or compensation for sales of Intool product within his area by 
distributors outside his area. (Patterson Dep. at 52-53). "
1223,9," In addition to the substantive deficiencies in the writings proffered by the plaintiff, sales representative Patterson could not 
qualify as an ""executive,"" and the plaintiff has presented no evidence that Ben Spillman, even if an executive, was ""authorized"" 
to modify the Distributor Agreement. "
1224,10," The mere fact that Tool-Smith received the benefit of joint sales calls while the plaintiff did not is of course insufficient to create 
such a fact issue. Indeed, the Distributor Agreement does not require that the plaintiff be provided any particular level of support, 
either in absolute terms or in comparison to other distributors. "
1225,11," The Clayton Act, enacted in 1914, is codified as amended at 15 U.S.C. §§ 12-27. The Robinson-Patman Act, enacted in 1936, 
amended the Clayton Act and is codified within 15 U.S.C. §§ 13-13b, 21a. Title 15, Section 13 is sometimes referred to, in the 
case law and in this opinion, as Section 2 (of the Clayton Act). "
1226,12," A number of additional elements are not at issue on the present motions for summary judgment, including those requiring 
""commodities"" of ""like grade and quality"" and those associated with the ""commerce"" requirement. See 15 U.S.C. § 13(a)."
1226,13," Tool-Smith adopts the arguments raised by Intool, including defenses. (Doc. 98 at 20, 24-26)."
1226,14," Price discrimination impacting customers of competing sellers and disfavored buyers is known as ""third-line."" Id. "
1227,15, Intool's brief refers to the differential in the present tense. (Doc. 104 at 18).
1227,16," The Eleventh Circuit follows the Morton Salt rule. See, e.g., Alan's of Atlanta, Inc. v. Minolta Corp., 903 F.2d 1414, 1418 n.6 
(11th Cir. 1990); Foremost Dairies v. FTC, 348 F.2d at 679. ""With secondary-line RPA violations the competition/competitor "
1228,," distinction tends to fade …. The injury to secondary-line competition the RPA seeks to prevent is analogous, if not identical, to 
an injury to competitors of a favored buyer."" Alan's of Atlanta, 903 F.2d at 1427."
1228,17," Intool cites only a single district court case that would apply Brooke Group in a second-line case. See Bob Nicholson 
Appliance, Inc. v. Maytag Co., 883 F. Supp. 321, 326 (S.D. Ind. 1990). No known case has favorably cited Bob Nicholson for this 
proposition. "
1229,18," It is of course relevant to the plaintiff's damages. See Part III.C.4, infra."
1229,19," On remand, the FTC again found against Boise Cascade. Boise Cascade Corp., 5 Trade Reg. Rep. (CCH) § 22,902 (F.T.C. 
1990). The parties thereafter settled, id. § 23,013 (F.T.C. 1991), so that the D.C. Circuit never ruled whether Boise Cascade's 
evidence precluded a finding of injury to competition."
1229,20," Intool's argument appears most analogous to a ""setoff"" theory. However, HN28[
] a setoff is not a defense to liability but 
works only to reduce damages. Intool has filed no counterclaim to recover the value of any improper stocking distributor 
discounts. "
1230,21," Intool cites Servicetrends, Inc. v. Siemens Medical Systems, Inc., 870 F. Supp. 1042 (N.D. Ga. 1994), but that case does not 
support the proposition. In Servicetrends, the discount was not based simply on repair functions, but on installation, training, 
reporting and regulatory functions as well.  Id. at 1058. At least some of these functions fall properly within the scope of the 
functional discount defense, and the Servicetrends Court did not indicate its decision hinged on the repair function. Moreover, 
while citing Texaco v. Hasbrouck, the Servicetrends Court did not analyze the proper scope of the functional discount defense, 
and its application of the defense is therefore of little significance. Tool-Smith cites FLM Collision Parts, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 543 F.2d 1019 (2d Cir. 1976), but the functional discount in that 
case, while involving the sale of repair parts, was not based on the favored purchasers' repair function but on their function ""as a 
wholesaler rather than a retailer."" Id. at 1027."
1230,22," Unlike the typical distributive function justifying a functional discount, a repair facility operates as an additional profit center for 
the distributor and not simply as an additional expense. "
1231,23," The letter announcing the change in the parts discount was sent out nationally by Intool's North American director of sales and 
marketing. (Spillman Dep. at 47) The letter stated in pertinent part, ""we have established specific criteria to solve these 
problems."" (Ex. 40) This language appears to create a question of fact as to whether the criteria for the repair discount were to 
be uniform nationwide. This is apparently Tool-Smith's construction as well. (Doc. 98 at 4). "
1232,24," While this witness testified he would have honored a request from the tool department that bids allowing delivery in excess of 
seven days be rejected, (id. at 102), Intool has not established that any such request was ever made to the witness or 
necessarily would have been made had the plaintiff been awarded the contract."
1232,25," Intool also references an ""emergency parts order"" between Ingalls and Tool-Smith in 1997, (Doc. 104 at 40, 47), but provides 
insufficient facts to determine whether it may form the basis for an award of damages. "
1234,26, Intool acknowledges that this requirement is met with respect to the sale of parts. (Doc. 139 at 17)
1234,27," The plaintiff notes that Tool-Smith Mobile resold the impact wrenches to Ingalls and that the plaintiff bid on the same contract. 
(Doc. 121 at 30). While this timing would be relevant to damages, it is irrelevant to liability, which requires that both distributors 
purchase the same product from the manufacturer at or around the same time."
1234,28," While the plaintiff contemporaneously quoted a higher resale price to a customer, (Scott Aff. at 2), this is not evidence that the 
plaintiff contemporaneously purchased vertical grinders from Intool at a higher price. "
1235,29," In discovery responses, the plaintiff alleged violations of Section 13(e) from discriminatory practices concerning inventory 
returns and drop-shipment charges. (Doc. 104 at 45-46). The plaintiff effectively abandoned these claims by not addressing 
them in its brief. At any rate, the challenged practices are insufficiently related to the resale of Intool's products to the end user to 
constitute ""services"" within Section 13(e). Moreover, because Intool has provided evidence that the plaintiff was not charged for 
drop shipments, (Sullivan Aff.), and the plaintiff has not identified any contrary evidence, there is no genuine issue of material 
fact as to discrimination concerning drop shipment charges."
1235,30," The plaintiff's breach of contract claim involving joint sales calls, see Part I.D., supra, fails because of the different elements of 
proof required under that claim. In particular, the plaintiff presented no evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue of material 
fact that Intool's failure to make joint sales calls with the plaintiff was arbitrary, capricious or otherwise in breach of its contractual 
obligation. Under the Robinson-Patman Act, no such proof is required. "
1236,31," HN45[
] Because liability under Section 13(f) is limited to discrimination ""in price,"" it does not extend to discrimination in services or facilities under Section 13(e). See Great Atlantic & Pacific v. FTC, 440 U.S. at 76-77 (because ""only subsections (a) 
and (b) involve discriminations in price, … buyer liability under § 2(f) is dependent on seller liability under § 2(a)""); see also 
Holmes, Antitrust Law Handbook 546 (1998)."
1236,32," The Court addresses the parties' motions only as they impact the defendants' motions for summary judgment. The Court 
expresses no opinion concerning the admissibility of the challenged testimony and exhibits at trial. "
1238,33," The amended responses were filed, without prior requests for relief from discovery deadlines, seven weeks after final 
supplementation of discovery responses was required, three weeks after the discovery cutoff, and on the day the defendants' 
motions for summary judgment were due. (Id.)."
1238,34," Much of the testimony lifted from the plaintiff's stricken interrogatory responses is also inadmissible hearsay, based not on the 
witness's personal knowledge but on his review, analysis and interpretation of Tool-Smith documents that are not in evidence. "
1244,1," See Webster v. Fulton County, 85 F. Supp. 2d 1375, 2000 WL 193314, at *2 (N.D. Ga. 2000) ("". . . HN2[

1263,1," Although the ability of proposed class members to press their claims in the absence of certification does seem relevant to 
whether the class should be certified, this question appears conceptually independent of the heading under which it is 
traditionally considered, namely, whether joinder is practicable under Rule 23(a)(1). "
1264,2," The questions on which defendants base this argument asked defendants whether they gave particular named proposed class 
members price information, or revealed plans for an imminent price change, with the expectation that the information would find 
its way to a competing defendant, or whether they received information about competitors' prices from their customers. (Defs.'

it was just no -- I don't know. . . . I can't understand why I was not successful in that business. Q: Who decided to file a federal lawsuit in Milwaukee? A: My attorneys. Q: If it goes to trial there, would you attend? A: If I'm called on it. "
1267,," Q: Would you attend day in and day out? A: I would like to see what happened to my frame of mind that I blew it in 1992 and '93, '94. To this day it does not make 
sense why I couldn't make a go, and I will ride it out. A: So you will attend the trial? A: If I have to. Q: What do you mean? A: If I'm asked to. Q: By whom? A: By counsel. Q: But if it's your decision, would you attend the entire trial? A: If it would help the total picture, yes. . . . . Q: As somebody out front with your name on the front of the complaint here, as a class representative of converters, 
generally, does Victor Paper seek to represent all converters who bought jumbo roll thermal paper in February '92, '93? A: I don't think I can represent all. I would be a part of whatever my attorneys tell me I should be doing. Q: Coming into the business in the middle of the period and starting Victor Paper as you did, would you say you were just 
like all the other converters in the business? A: No. I think most of those fellows were way ahead of me with what they know about the industry, experience, expertise. I 
learned quick. I did learn quick. . . . . Q: So, do you think you can go to bat for them [other converters] in this lawsuit and do a fair job of it? A: No. Q: Why not? A: I don't know enough about the technical side of their products. Q: How did you go about retaining counsel after that initial call to Mr. Peoples? . . . . A: I called him. . . . . Q: Take a look at paragraph 19 [of the complaint], please. Is that your estimate that there are more than 50 converters who 
directly bought thermal paper from the defendants during the relevant time period? A: Yeah. Q: What's your basis for that? A: A converter could be more than just a paper roll converter. Every form of manufacturer in this country is cutting thermal 
rolls down besides us. . . . . Q: You have no evidence that the defendants conspired to restrain trade or fix prices, do you? A: No, I don't. Q: Or that Appleton participated in any such conspiracy? A: No, I don't. "
1268,," . . . . Q: Do you have any evidence or knowledge regarding conversations, telephone conversations, meetings or discussions 
among the defendants? A: No. . . . . Q: And as you sit here today, you don't know how many there are today? A: Not without reading slips here. Q: You are aware you brought a lawsuit that purports to be a class action? A: Correct. Q: And the class that you seek to represent consists of what? A: Many other converters. Q: Do you know approximately how many converters are in the class? A: To be honest, no, I don't. Q: No idea. I don't want you to guess. If you can estimate, you can do that, but don't guess. A: Three or four, five. (Decl. of Small. Ex. 46 at 184, 189; Defs.' J.A. Ex. 4 at 185-86, 188, 300.) "
1269,5," I observe in addition that Paper Systems' president signed the verification to Paper Systems' answers to mandatory 
interrogatories under penalties of perjury (including a statement that he had read the answers and that they were true and 
correct to the best of his knowledge, information and belief), but testified that he had in fact ""probably not"" read the document 
and instead ""probably thumbed through it real quick, if it was there."" (Defs.' J.A. Ex. 19 at 186) (emphasis added). He had no 
recollection of whether the answers had been there when he signed, or only the signature page, and testified in any event that 
he had done nothing to verify that the information was accurate. (Id. at 186, 187-88.) (To be sure, Paper Systems' finance 
director later stated under penalties of perjury that he checked the accuracy of the answers before they were submitted to the "
1270,," company president to sign under penalties of perjury, but in that case the finance director and not the president should have 
verified the answers' accuracy.) A cavalier attitude towards verified court documents appears to reflect less than a diligent effort 
to advance and protect the interests of absent class members. HN23[
] A class representative is required to comply 
wholeheartedly with discovery obligations. See Norman v. Arcs Equities Corp., 72 F.R.D. 502, 506 (S.D.N.Y. 1976) (""One who 
will not comply wholeheartedly and fully with the discovery requirements of modern federal practice, is not to be regarded by this 
Court as one to whom the important fiduciary obligation of acting as a class representative should be entrusted.""). "
1271,6," Included in plaintiffs' evidence of antitrust violations are such items as minutes from a February 6, 1990 meeting entitled, 
""Meeting of Four Thermal Paper Companies"" whose third item is ""Disclose price levels for each market, and try to put a stop to 
price decreases. Prepare the foundation for launching price increases later on. . . . If possible, 10% up from April production."" 
(Decl. of Small, Ex. 15 at 014-0369.)"
1271,7," Indeed, it appears that during the class period, thermal facsimile paper price continued a downward trend that began before the 
class period, due in part to the increasing popularity of recently-introduced plain paper facsimile machines. ( Defs.' J.A., Ex. 5 P 
3 n.2.) Defendants take the fact of declining prices to establish that competition was alive and well during the class period and 
that as a result any antitrust agreements did not lead to injuries during the class period. ( Defs.' J.A., Ex. 20 P 8.) "
1273,8," Apparently one defendant, Kanzaki Specialty Papers, did not provide volume discount and rebate information for 1993. (Id. at 
tbl. 1 n.c.) "
1320,1," The defendants whose fully briefed motions to dismiss are covered by this opinion include: Degussa-Huls Corporation; EM 
Industries, Inc; Reilly Industries, Inc.; Chinook Group, Inc.; Chinook Group Ltd.; Lonza, Inc.; UCB, Inc.; E.I. DuPont de Nemours 
and Co.; ConAgra, Inc.; Akzo Nobel, Inc.; DuCoa, L.P.; and DCV, Inc."
1320,2," The plaintiffs whose complaints are being challenged by these motions include: the Vitamin B-3 class, NBTY, Perrigo, Natural 
Alternatives, Leiner Health Products, Tyson Foods, Blue Seal Feeds, Cactus Operating, Southern States, Marshall Durbin 
Farms, Quaker Oats, Cargill, Kellogg, Hormel Foods, Proctor & Gamble, Meijer, Publix, and Nutra-Blend. "
1321,3," The requirements for claims of fraudulent concealment under the relevant state antitrust laws will be discussed later in this 
opinion. "
1322,4," These allegations appear in all relevant complaints. See Class Action Vitamin B-3 Complaint at PP 41, 42, 49; Exhibits 1-7 of 
Direct Action Plaintiffs' Consolidated Opposition (copies of factual allegations from all Direct Action Complaints which support 
fraudulent concealment claims); NBTY, et al. Complaint P 89. "
1323,5," In a Supplemental Memorandum, defendants point to the recent Supreme Court decision in Rotella v. Wood as further support 
for their position. See Supplemental Memorandum in Support of Defendant's Reply; see also Rotella v. Wood, 528 U.S. 549, 120 
S. Ct. 1075, 145 L. Ed. 2d 1047 (2000) (attached to defendants' memorandum). However, the Court finds Rotella to be 
inapposite. In Rotella, plaintiff did ""not deny that he knew of his injury . . . when it occurred, or that his civil RICO claim was 
complete and subject to suit at that time""; he merely claimed that the clock should not start until he discovered the pattern of 
predicate acts.  120 S. Ct. at 1083. The Supreme Court referred to Klehr as a rejection of this ""last predicate act rule."" Id. at 
1080. By contrast, in the Vitamins Antitrust Litigation, plaintiffs do not claim that they were aware of their injury earlier; in fact, 
they specifically allege that they were not aware of it earlier and that they could not reasonably have discovered it before they 
did due to defendants' affirmative acts of concealment. Therefore, this is a different case from that facing the Supreme Court in 
Rotella."
1323,6," Significantly, the Supreme Court specifically refers to HN16[
] the due diligence requirement as a ""fact-based question."" Klehr, 521 U.S. at 196. "
1324,7," The Court finds it significant that the complaints describe a series of surreptitious acts of the co-conspirators, including: 
intentional falsification to make collusive bids appear competitive, convening secret meetings in hotels and other places to avoid 
detection, instructing co-conspirators to destroy any documents pertaining to meetings among conspirators, using codes to 
identify conspirators, and fabricating and rehearsing a cover story for Dr. Kuno Sommer to relate to the DOJ denying the 
existence of a vitamin cartel in an attempt to quell the government's suspicions. See Class Action Vitamin B-3 Complaint at PP 
41, 42, 49; Exhibits 1-7 of Tyson, et al. Plaintiffs' Consolidated Opp. (copies of factual allegations from direct action complaints); 
NBTY, et al. P 89. "

1328,10," Per se cases do not require a rule of reason analysis. Therefore, cases such as Tampa Electric Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., 365 
U.S. 320, 5 L. Ed. 2d 580, 81 S. Ct. 623 (1961) are inapposite."

Associated Pathologists, Ltd., 844 F.2d 473, 480 (7th Cir. 1988) (tying claim); Genetic Sys. Corp. v. Abbott Lab, 691 F. Supp. 
407, 417 (D.D.C. 1988) (vertical boycott)."

433 (M.D. Tenn. 1982). "
1329,13," Defendants argue that since plaintiffs attached the governments' indictments and plea bargains to their pleadings, they are 
somehow bound by these documents. The Court disagrees. HN41[
] There is no legal requirement that plaintiffs be bound by 
the scope of all documents attached to their pleadings. It is perfectly acceptable for the government and plaintiffs to take 
different views of the scope of this conspiracy, even if plaintiffs refer to the government's documents to support their claims of 
the defendants' involvement in the alleged activities. Moreover, the Court has no evidence of the government's view of the scope 
of this conspiracy; the fact that the government chose to divide the conspiracy into separate parts does not in any way support 
the defendant's position that there could not have been a single overarching conspiracy. It is fully understood that the 
government may undertake plea bargains in order to achieve certain strategic objectives and these goals may be different from 
those of private litigants. "
1330,14," Pursuant to Rule 12(e), UCB, Inc. seeks a more definite statement of the allegations against it in the event the Court denies its 
motion to dismiss. The Court finds that plaintiffs' allegations provide UCB, Inc. with fair notice of the claims against it and 
adequately allege antitrust injury. Nothing more is required at this stage in the process. See Hospital Bldg Co., 425 U.S. at 745. 
Therefore, UCB's alternative motion for a more definite statement is denied. "
1331,15," Antitrust injury and damages are also alleged in paragraphs 98 and 99, which are specifically incorporated into Count III in 
paragraph 105. "
1332,16," In Cellular Plus, the court noted that the California Supreme Court in Chicago Title Ins. Co. v. Great Western Financial Corp., 
69 Cal. 2d 305, 315-328, 70 Cal. Rptr. 849, 444 P.2d 481 (1968) required ""more factually specific pleadings for Cartwright Act 
claims. . . ."" 14 Cal. App. 4th at 1236."
1332,17," See Galardo v. AMP, Inc., 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9288, 1982 WL 1791 (N.D. Cal. 1982) (directed verdict)."
1332,18," See G.H.I.I. v. MTS, Inc., 147 Cal. App. 3d 256, 195 Cal. Rptr. 211 (Cal.Ct.App. 1983) (dismissing claim for horizontal restraint 
because complaint did not include allegation of horizontal conspiracy and dismissing claim for vertical restraint because 
complaint did not include allegation of coercion or combination); Truta v. Avis Rent-A-Car System, Inc., 193 Cal. App. 3d 802,

1333,19," See Illinois Brick Company, et al. v. Illinois, et al., 431 U.S. 720, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707, 97 S. Ct. 2061 (1977) (limiting federal 
antitrust standing to direct purchasers). "
1335,20," Significantly, the court considered it important that the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation had found ""that the interests of 
justice could best be served by conducting consolidated and coordinated discovery in this district."" Id. at 295. "
1342,1," Defendant recalled GE and Hotpoint dishwashers manufactured between April 1983 and January 1989 having the model 
number GSD500D, GSD500G, GSD540, HDA467, HDA477, or HDA487 and a serial number containing the letter A, M, R, S, T, 
V, or Z as the second character."
1342,2," In the Settlement, the CPSC alleged that the subject dishwashers were found to pose a substantial product hazard. See Def. 
Exh. F. at 2. However, the CPSC acknowledged both that defendant denied that the products contained a defect or created a 
substantial product hazard and that the Settlement did not constitute an admission of such by defendant. See id. at 2, 3, and 7. "
1343,3," Plaintiffs also seek to have defendant prove ""to the satisfaction of the court"" that a complete repair of the dishwashers is not 
possible. However, on a motion for a preliminary injunction, plaintiffs bear the burden of making this showing, not defendant. "
1344,4," In addition to seeking other types of relief, plaintiffs seek relief in the form of defendant's immediate repair of the dishwashers 
subject to recall and defendant's adoption of a corrective information campaign."
1344,5," Plaintiffs allege that (1) defendant has failed to notify the CPSC in a timely manner of the safety hazard in violation of the 
Consumer Protection Safety Act, including 15 U.S.C. section 2064, and (2) defendant has failed to provide a fair and adequate 
remedy for the safety hazard presented by the dishwashers."
1344,6," Defendant alleges as an affirmative defense that plaintiffs lack standing. However, the California Supreme Court has 
interpreted the statute to provide a liberal standing doctrine. See Barquis, 7 Cal.3d at 108, 101 Cal.Rptr. 745, 496 P.2d 817. 
""Actions for injunction under this section may be prosecuted by the Attorney General or any district attorney . . . by any person 
acting for the interests of itself, its members or the general public."" Id. Here plaintiffs act on behalf of themselves individually and 
on behalf of the general public. Thus, lack of standing does not appear to be a valid defense to this action. "
1345,7," The CPSC's reasons for failing to engage in more rule-making may be many. The CPSC favors other approaches, such as 
product recalls, over safety standards to achieve its safety goals. Also, the agency lacks the financial resources to undertake 
aggressive rulemaking approaches. See generally Robert Adler, From ""Model Agency"" to Basket Case--Can the Consumer 
Product Safety Commission Be Redeemed?, 41 ADMIN. L. REV. 61 (1989)."
1345,8," The Senate Commerce Committee Report on § 2074 states in relevant part: ""The definition of 'consumer product safety 
standard' in § 2056 of the CPSA read in conjunction with § 2074 establishes Federal Government action as 'minimum' action "
1346,," which is not necessarily the optimum level of safety and therefore not conclusive evidence of 'due care' in product liability 
litigation."" H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 92-1593 (1972) reprinted in 1972 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4596, 4650 (compliance with consumer product 
safety rules ""not to release any person from liability at common law to any other person"")."
1346,9," Although the court does not now address it, the standards articulated under the CPSA and state laws may conflict with regard 
to the same risk of injury. In that instance, section 2075(a) of the CPSA provides that no state may enact a law which ""prescribes 
any requirements as to the performance, composition, contents, design, finish, construction, packaging, or labeling of such 
product which are designed to deal with the same risk of injury associated with such consumer product, unless such 
requirements are identical to the requirements of the federal standard."" 15 U.S.C. § 2075(a). State laws that conflict with CPSA 
rules may only be permitted if they impose a higher degree of protection from the risk of injury prescribed under the CPSA. See 
15 U.S.C. § 2075(b). Thus, the CPSA rules may be seen as a minimum threshold of protection. The plain language of the CPSA appears to affirm the ordinary principles of ""conflict"" and ""field"" preemption. Those principles 
make clear that a federal requirement preempts a state requirement if (1) the state requirement actually conflicts with the federal 
requirement, either because compliance with both is impossible or because the state requirement ""stands as an obstacle to the 
accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,"" Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 67, 85 L.Ed. 
581, 61 S.Ct. 399 (1941); or (2) the scheme of federal regulation is ""so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that 
Congress left no room for the States to supplement it,"" Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.S. 218, 230, 91 L.Ed. 1447, 67 
S.Ct. 1146 (1947). See Medtronic, 518 U.S. at 507, 116 S.Ct. 2240 (Breyer, J., concurring). "
1347,10," Although the California Supreme Court declined to extend its holding to consumer actions, the lack of distinction between 
competitor and consumer in the language of the UCL renders this definition equally valid in the consumer context. "
1348,11," The court notes that even individuals living on fixed incomes may enjoy a great degree of purchasing power, especially if they 
live in Rancho Bernardo, as do two of the consumers in the instant action. "
1363,1," The FTC recently filed suit against Defendants HMRI and Andrx based on its investigation of this matter. See Plfs.' 3/22/00 
Notice of FTC Action and Defendant Andrx's 4/18/00 Resp. to Plfs.' Notice. "
1364,2," As of December 15, 1999, HMRI has changed its name again to Aventis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. See HMRI's 3/2/00 Notice of 
Name Change and Disclosure of Corporate Affiliations and Financial Interest. "
1365,3," State Law Plaintiffs allege that the HMRI/Andrx Agreement is a conspiratorial, horizontal market allocation agreement that was 
designed to prevent any generic competition for Cardizem CD in the United States marketplace. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege 
that: (1) the Agreement is between horizontal competitors in the same chain of distribution and has the effect of allocating 
market share, restraining trade, and fixing prices; (2) the purpose and effect of the Agreement was to allow the Hoechst 
Defendants to continue their monopoly market share while continuing to set artificially high prices for Cardizem CD in the indirect 
purchaser states and throughout the United States; and (3) constitutes a per se violation of the antitrust laws in the states of 
California, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Tennessee, New York, Minnesota, Michigan and in the District of Columbia (PP 111, 124, 
B(v-viii), C(vi), E(iii), F(v), G(iv), H(viii), I(vi) and J(v)). Plaintiffs further allege that the relevant product and geographic market is 
the market for Cardizem CD and its FDA-approved AB-rated generic bioequivalents in the United States (P 133). They also 
allege the following anticompetitive effects (P 135): As a result of Defendants' illegal acts, combinations, conspiracies and their 
resulting exclusionary, monopolistic and unlawful trade restraints described in the complaint, the prices for Cardizem CD and its 
generic bioequivalents have been fixed, raised, maintained and stabilized at artificially high and noncompetitive levels by 
Defendants while a 100% market share has been maintained between them, free from natural competition, thus causing those 
who pay for Cardizem CD and Cartia XT sold in the Indirect Purchaser States to pay annually many millions of dollars more for 
Cardizem CD and Cartia XT than they would have had to pay under normal conditions of competition in the absence of such 
illegal restraints of trade. "
1366,4," The Sherman Act Class Plaintiffs allege (P 59) that Defendants HMRI and Andrx engaged in a continuing agreement, 
combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade and commerce in violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1. 
Specifically, they allege that the Defendants' contract, combination, or conspiracy has included concerted action and 
undertakings between Defendants with the purpose and effect to fix, raise, maintain and stabilize the price of Cardizem CD (P 
60). They further allege that Defendants entered into an illegal agreement where Andrx agreed not to sell its generic version of 
Cardizem CD in U.S. commerce in exchange for payments of tens of millions of dollars by HMRI; thereby depriving all 
purchasers of the ability to purchase Cardizem CD at a competitive price (P 61). Plaintiffs allege that the HMRI/Andrx Agreement 
is either a per se violation of section 1 of Sherman Act or, in the alternative, a violation of § 1 under a rule of reason analysis, 
because its purpose and effect was to unreasonably restrain competition in the sale of Cardizem CD and generic versions of 
Cardizem CD (PP 64, 65). The Sherman Act Class Plaintiffs allege that the HMRI/Andrx Agreement is a horizontal market allocation agreement and is 
illegal per se under controlling federal case law because the Agreement allocated the entire United States market to HMRI and 
required HMRI to pay Andrx a portion of its illegally inflated profits. They further allege that the Agreement was an illegal price-
fixing agreement because its purpose and effect was to ensure that HMRI would continue to be able to market Cardizem CD 
free from generic competition and thus would be able to charge supra-competitive prices for Cardizem CD (P 50). Plaintiffs 
allege that the HMRI/Andrx Agreement brought HMRI protection not only from Andrx's generic version of Cardizem CD but also 
protection from generic competition from Biovail and Faulding (which had received tentative FDA approval for its product on or 
about October 26, 1998) because these generic competitors could not market their products until Andrx's 180-day exclusivity 
period ended (P 51). They allege that the anticompetitive effects of Defendants' acts included: (1) fixing, raising, maintaining, or 
stabilizing the prices for Cardizem CD at an artificially high and non-competitive level; (2) restraining, suppressing, and 
eliminating competition in the production and sale of Cardizem CD; and (3) depriving Cardizem CD purchasers of the benefits of 
free and open competition (P 66)."
1366,5," The Individual Kroger Sherman Act Plaintiffs similarly allege that Defendants HMRI and Andrx violated section 1 of the 
Sherman Act. They similarly allege that the HMRI/Andrx Agreement is a horizontal market allocation agreement and illegal per 
se (P 39, 42). They allege that the Agreement ensured that HMRI would continue to be able to market Cardizem CD entirely free "
1367,," from generic competition and ensured that HMRI would continue to impose supra-competitive monopoly prices on Plaintiffs and 
other purchasers. They further allege that, but for the HMRI/Andrx Agreement, other generic competitors like Biovail and 
Faulding would have been able to enter the market sooner and would have been able to compete with Cardizem CD, and 
Plaintiffs would have been free to substitute lower-priced generic versions of Cardizem CD thus allowing competition and market 
pressure to decrease the price for Cardizem CD (PP 39-40). These Plaintiffs do not allege a section 1, Sherman Act violation 
under a rule of reason analysis."
1367,6," These Individual Sherman Act Plaintiffs similarly allege that Defendants HMRI and Andrx violated section 1 of the Sherman Act 
under either a per se or rule of reason analysis. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that, under the terms of the HMRI/Andrx 
Agreement, Andrx agreed not to market its generic version of Cardizem CD in the United States until a final and appealable 
judgment was entered in a pending patent infringement action between HMRI and Andrx; HMRI agreed to make nonrefundable 
payments of $ 40 million per year to Andrx, to be increased to $ 100 million per year retroactively if Andrx prevailed in the patent 
suit; and both agreed that Andrx was free to (and did in fact) market a generic version of Cardizem CD outside the United States 
(P 16). They further allege that the purpose and effect of the HMRI/Andrx Agreement was to eliminate all competition to HMRI in 
the United States by generic manufacturers of Cardizem CD; that, because generic drugs are typically priced at 30% or more 
below brand-name drugs, the Agreement deprived consumers of lower-priced alternatives to Cardizem CD; and the Agreement 
protected HMRI from competition from Andrx for approximately one year and also protected HMRI from competition from Biovail 
and Faulding and any other generic manufacturer because of the 180-day exclusivity period that Andrx would enjoy once it did 
go to market with its generic version of Cardizem CD (PP 18, 19). The alleged anticompetitive effects of Defendants' illegal 
conduct include decreased competition and thus fewer choices and artificially higher prices for Plaintiffs (P 24). Plaintiffs allege that the HMRI/Andrx Agreement had no reasonable pro-competitive objective and thus constitutes a per se 
violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act (P 25). They alternatively allege that the Agreement violates section 1 under a rule of 
reason analysis because it has unreasonably restrained competition in the market for Cardizem CD and its bioequivalents in the 
United States (P 26). Finally, Plaintiffs allege that they have been injured in the form of overcharges as a result of Defendants' 
illegal acts which forced them to pay artificially high prices for Cardizem CD and denied them the opportunity to purchase a less 
expensive generic equivalent to Cardizem CD (P 27). "
1371,7, The FDA Orange Book apparently lists the patents covering FDA approved drugs. 
1374,8," Plaintiffs' complaints allege that: (1) the HMRI/Andrx Agreement is a private market-allocation agreement between private 
parties who are also horizontal competitors; (2) the Agreement was designed to protect HMRI from generic competition from 
Andrx and other potential generic competitors, such as Biovail and Faulding, by having Andrx delay the entry of its generic 
version of Cardizem CD into the U.S. market in exchange for tens of millions of dollars that HMRI would pay to Andrx for its 
cooperation in this anticompetitive scheme; (3) in addition to refraining from going to market with its generic version of Cardizem 
CD in exchange for $ 10 million per quarter, Andrx agreed to dismiss, without prejudice, its antitrust and unfair competition 
claims against HMRI which asserted that HMRI's patent infringement claims were a sham; (4) the Agreement was not filed in, 
presented to, or approved by the court presiding over the HMRI/Andrx patent litigation; (5) the court presiding over the patent 
case was never informed of its existence; (6) the Agreement has never been filed as an exhibit to any public filings filed by 
Defendants under the Securities Exchange Act despite the fact that they are publicly traded companies; and (7) no agency or 
official of any government, whether federal, state or local, has sanctioned or created this arrangement, or prevented Andrx's 
entry into the U.S. market until the conclusion of the HMRI/Andrx patent litigation. "
1377,9," After the suit was filed, ""the parties entered into a stipulation whereby [the defendant] agreed to raise its gas prices pending 
resolution of the lawsuit. In the six months following execution of the stipulation, [the defendant] lost a considerable amount of its 
sales volume."" McGuire Oil, 958 F.2d at 1555. "
1380,10," The Individual Sherman Act Plaintiffs' complaints allege no facts supporting an argument that the HMRI/Andrx patent litigation 
was a sham. This is not an omission by the Plaintiffs. Rather, these Plaintiffs argue that there is no need to make any such 
allegations in order to state a claim under section 1 of the Sherman Act. Plaintiffs are correct. "
1381,11," State Law Plaintiffs allege the following. In August 1995, prior to filing its ANDA and Paragraph IV certification, Andrx gave 
samples of its generic version of Cardizem CD to the Hoechst Defendants so they could test it and confirm that it did not infringe 
the patents claiming Cardizem CD and thus avoid litigation. In September 1995, Andrx filed an ANDA and made a Paragraph IV 
certification regarding all unexpired patents listed in the Orange Book allegedly claiming Cardizem CD. Two months later, in 
November 1995, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued the '584 patent to Carderm, which in term licensed it to HMRI. 
The '584 patent claims a ""dissolution profile,"" which is the amount of diltiazem released over specified periods of time, and was 
listed by the Hoechst Defendants in the ""Orange Book"" as covering Cardizem CD. PP 98-101. It is further alleged that the '584 patent did not represent a substantive change or improvement to Cardizem CD, but rather was 
prosecuted and listed solely to give HMRI a basis for initiating sham patent infringement litigation to delay and exclude Andrx's 
generic version of Cardizem CD from the Cardizem CD market for at least 30 months. HMRI and Carderm did, in January 1996, 
file a patent infringement suit against Andrx alleging that Andrx's generic drug infringed the '584 patent. PP 101-102. In addition to claiming no infringement of the '584 patent, Andrx also amended its ANDA on April 4, 1996 to specify a dissolution 
profile that was even more clearly distinct from that claimed by the '584 patent; i.e., it claimed only a dissolution profile (not less 
than 55% of total diltiazem released after 18 hours) which was within the dissolution range that Carderm had specifically 
canceled from its application for the '584 patent. The dissolution profile claimed in the '584 patent (0-45% of total diltiazem 
released after 18 hours) plainly excluded that disclosed in Andrx's Amended ANDA. It is alleged that HMRI, Carderm and 
Hoechst AG pursued the HMRI/Andrx patent case despite: (1) notice of Andrx's April 1996 amended ANDA; (2) the absence of 
any reasonable belief that they would succeed on the merits of their claim; and (3) the fact that no reasonable litigant could 
realistically expect success on the merits. Rather, the suit was pursued solely for anticompetitive reasons. PP 103-104, 130."
1381,12," Section 2 of the Sherman Act provides in pertinent part that: Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine with any other person or persons, to monopolize 
any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations shall be deemed guilty of a felony."
1381,15," U.S.C. § 2. Section 2 of the Sherman Act ""addresses the actions of single firms that monopolize or attempt to monopolize, as 
well as conspiracies and combinations to monopolize."" Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan, 506 U.S. 447, 454, 122 L. Ed. 2d "
1382,247," , 113 S. Ct. 884 (1993). Section 2 ""makes the conduct of a single firm unlawful only when it actually monopolizes or 
dangerously threatens to do so."" Id. at 459. "
1383,13," The plaintiff's injury in Brunswick did not qualify as an ""antitrust injury"" because it failed both prongs of the Brunswick test. 
""First, profits lost as a result of enhanced competition are not the type of injury the antitrust laws were designed to prevent"", and 
the essence of the plaintiff's claim in Brunswick was that it was ""deprived of the opportunity to profit from the exercise of the local 
market power it would have had if the merger had not saved its rival from bankruptcy."" 2 P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, supra, P 
362a at 211. As to the second prong, ""the plaintiff's injury (present competition from a rival that is enabled to survive through an 
acquisition) does not flow from the reason for finding a violation (hypothetical future predation or collusion made possible by that 
acquisition)."" Id. at 212. "
1384,14," Defendants attempt to explain away Andrx's representations to the court by arguing Andrx didn't really mean what it said; i.e., 
when ""read in context, the statement that Andrx intended to enter the market can only be understood to mean that Andrx was 
prepared to enter the market if it could resolve all of the potential patent infringement claims."" See HMRI Br. at 34-35 n. 22. 
Defendants' arguments are to no avail. This Court must take Plaintiffs' allegations as true and cannot dismiss the Plaintiffs' 
complaints based on facts that contradict their factual allegations."
1384,15," The Individual Sherman Act Plaintiffs argue that the Hoechst Defendants are collaterally estopped from relitigating the lack of 
antitrust injury issue because it was already litigated and decided against these Defendants in Biovail Corp. Int'l v. Hoechst 
Aktiengesellschaft, 49 F. Supp. 2d 750, 767-78 (D. N.J. 1999). This Court agrees with Defendant HMRI that the doctrine of 
collateral estoppel does not apply here because the district court in Biovail based its decision on a complaint brought by a 
different plaintiff asserting different allegations affecting the court's analysis of the antitrust injury question. There is no collateral 
estoppel because the required identity of issues is lacking here. See Detroit Police Officers Ass'n v. Young, 824 F.2d 512, 515 
(6th Cir. 1987). "
1385,16," As Plaintiffs point out, it is the agreement to restrain trade that makes this an antitrust violation in the first instance. To accept 
Defendants' argument, the Court must also accept the argument that there can never be an antitrust violation if the antitrust 
defendant can posit an argument that it could have lawfully done the same thing it is accused of doing collusively. The Court 
finds these arguments unavailing. See Virginia Vermiculite, Ltd. v. W.R. Grace & Co., 156 F.3d 535, 539-40 (4th Cir. 1998), cert. 
denied, 526 U.S. 1066, 119 S. Ct. 1458, 143 L. Ed. 2d 544 (1999). There are many things a defendant can do unilaterally 
without offending the antitrust laws that it cannot do collusively. For example, consider two gas stations that have control over a 
large geographic market and independently price their gas in such a way that they are within a penny or so of each other. That is 
not an antitrust violation. However, if the two gas stations, which have a monopoly over gas in the geographic market area, 
agree to fix the price of gasoline, then there is an antitrust violation. The violation would meet the Brunswick criteria for antitrust 
injury because the claimed injury is of the type the antitrust laws were meant to discourage; agreements to fix prices. Also, the 
plaintiff's injury (having to pay higher, deliberately set prices) is causally related to the defendant's anticompetitive acts. The 
same analysis applies here. "
1388,17," Professors Areeda and Hovenkamp comment that ""this factor also helps explain some substantive antitrust doctrines. For 
example, lobbying the government for anticompetitive government action is not an antitrust violation because, in part, the 
anticompetitive impact of the government action is caused by the independent decision of the government rather than by the 
private party that sought such action."" (referring to Noerr-Pennington immunity doctrine). 2 P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, supra, P 
363b at 222 n. 14. "
1395,18," In Mova, the court concluded ""that the FDA exceeded its statutory authority in imposing a successful-defense requirement as 
a prerequisite to the invocation of the 180-day exclusivity rule by a first applicant"" because that requirement was ""inconsistent 
with the statutory text and structure,"" and was ""not justified by a need to protect the essential function of the statute or a clear 
congressional intent."" 140 F.3d at 1076. The FDA's successful-defense requirement impermissibly: (1) allowed later applicants 
to obtain FDA approval for their generic drugs and to begin marketing these drugs even though the first ANDA applicant has not 
yet obtained the benefits of the 180-day exclusivity period; and (2) wrote the commercial marketing trigger out of the Hatch-
Waxman Act.  Id. at 1069-70."
1395,19," At issue in Mylan Pharm., was the underlying patent infringement litigation between the patent-holder of a patent covering the 
drug tamoxifen and Barr Laboratories, a generic maker of tamoxifen who had filed an ANDA with a Paragraph IV certification. 
The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York had held that the tamoxifen patent was invalid.  2000 WL 
424204 at *3. The patent holder then appealed, but the matter settled before there was any substantive review by the Federal 
Circuit. The Settlement Agreement ""was expressly conditioned on Barr's agreement to abandon its challenge to the validity of 
[the patent holder]'s patent. Barr would abandon its challenge by amending its Paragraph IV certified ANDA back to a Paragraph 
III certified ANDA"" and, as a result, ""Barr's ANDA was no longer eligible for approval until after August 20, 2002, the date that 
[the patent holder]'s tamoxifen patent was scheduled to expire."" Id. at *4. ""After settling the case but during the pendency of the 
appeal"" the parties jointly asked the appellate court to vacate the district court decision and to remand the case with instructions 
to dismiss the case without prejudice. The Federal Circuit issued a short order granting the parties' request. Id. at *4. 
Subsequently, at Barr's request, the FDA granted Barr's petition to preserve its right to the 180-day exclusivity period provided 
under Hatch-Waxman and thus preserved its right ""to exclude all other generic makers of tamoxifen."" Id. at *6. Subsequently, two other generic manufacturers of tamoxifen, Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Pharachemie, B.V., brought the 
instant suit asserting that the FDA's decision to grant Barr's request violated the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and the FDA's 
own regulations. The Mylan Pharm. Court agreed and concluded that the FDA had exceeded its statutory authority under the 
Hatch-Waxman Amendments when the FDA: (1) ""gave no effect to the [United States District Court for the] Southern District [of 
New York] decision that determined that Barr had not infringed [the patent-holder]'s patent and [thus determined] that Barr was 
entitled to 180 days of marketing exclusivity""; and (2) ""determined that Barr was the first Paragraph IV ANDA applicant and thus, 
was entitled to exclusivity, despite the fact that first-filer Barr's application had not contained a Paragraph IV certification since 
1993. Id. at *12. The Mylan Pharm. Court construed the statutory language ""a decision of a court"", discerned ""clear 
congressional intent that the draftsmen intended 'a decision of the court' to mean all court decisions, whether subsequently 
vacated, settled, appealed or otherwise mooted"", id. at *15, and held that it ""unambiguously"" applied ""to cover a district court 
decision subsequently appealed and vacated pursuant to a settlement during the pendency of the appeal."" Id. at *18. The court 
further observed that ""Hatch-Waxman [was] intended to provide an incentive for drug companies to explore new drugs, not a 
market 'windfall' for crafty, albeit industrious, market players."" Id. at 17. "
1398,20," Plaintiffs confirmed at the hearing on this matter that they intend to use the Hoechst Defendants' conduct in connection with 
the FTC Consent Decree as evidence in support of their state law claims and not as the basis for a separate cause of action. 
See 4/18/00 Hrg. Transcript at 81."
1398,21," See Golden v. Nat'l Finance Adjusters, 555 F. Supp. 42, 47 (E.D. Mich. 1982) (dismissing the plaintiffs' declaratory judgment 
action and observing that ""plaintiffs have failed to show how an interpretation of a consent decree between the government and 
defendant, which plaintiffs cannot enforce against defendant, presents a justiciable controversy to this Court""); S.E.C. v. 
Prudential Securities, Inc., 136 F.3d 153, 156-160 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (affirming the denial of a motion, brought by a group of 
investors, to intervene in an ongoing enforcement proceeding against a securities seller because these investors were third 
parties to the subject Consent Decree, were not the intended beneficiaries of that Consent Decree, had no legally protected 
interest in enforcing the Consent Decree, and thus had no right to intervene in proceedings to enforce it); Rafferty v. NYNEX 
Corp., 314 U.S. App. D.C. 1, 60 F.3d 844, 849 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (holding that the plaintiff could not sue to uphold a consent 
decree between the government and the parent company of his employer and observing that ""unless a government consent 
decree stipulates that it may be enforced by a third party beneficiary, only the parties to the decree can seek enforcement of it""); 
Beckett v. Air Line Pilots Ass'n, 301 U.S. App. D.C. 380, 995 F.2d 280, 288-89 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (observing that incidental 
third party beneficiaries cannot sue to enforce a consent decree). "
1400,22," Contrary to Defendants' arguments here, the Emergency One Court's discussion of Wisconsin law, its prediction as to what 
standard the Wisconsin Supreme Court would adopt, and its application of that standard to the facts presented in the case were 
essential to its determination and thus are not properly dismissed as mere dictum. See Black's Law Dictionary at 454 (West 
1990) (""Dicta are opinions of a judge which do not embody the resolution or determination of the court, and made without 
argument, or full consideration of the point, are not the professed deliberate determinations of the judge himself."") "
1401,23," See Meridian Mutual Ins. Co. v. Kellman, 197 F.3d 1178, 1181 (6th Cir. 1999) (""In construing questions of state law, the 
federal court must apply state law in accordance with the controlling decisions of the highest court of the state. If the state's 
highest court has not addressed the issue, the federal court must attempt to ascertain how that court would rule if it were faced 
with the issue. . . . A federal court should not disregard the decisions of intermediate appellate state courts unless it is convinced 
by other persuasive data that the highest court of the state would decide otherwise"") (internal citations omitted)."
1401,24," In Blake, the Tennessee Court of Appeals disregarded the interstate/intrastate dichotomy and concluded that the plaintiff's 
complaint stated a claim under Tennessee's antitrust and consumer protection laws and thus would not be dismissed because it 
alleged facts that gave rise to the inference that the challenged conduct affected Tennessee's intrastate commerce; i.e., 
allegations that out-of-state manufacturers of infant formula had ""conspired to fix prices and did fix prices of baby formula"" and 
thus injured Tennessee consumers who were ""grossly overcharged"" for formula purchased in the State of Tennessee at 
""artificially high and non-competitive"" prices. Id. at **1, 3, 4-5. The court based its decision upon the well-established principle of 
Tennessee law that ""once a product was imported into the state from other states or countries and became commingled with the "
1402,," common mass of property in [Tennessee], it is no longer an article of interstate commerce. 'It is well settled that commerce in 
such imported articles may be regulated by state legislation.'"" Id. at *5 (quoting the Tennessee Supreme Court's decision in 
State ex rel Cates v. Standard Oil Co. of Kentucky, 120 Tenn. 86, 110 S.W. 565, 580 (1908), aff'd sub nom, Standard Oil Co. of 
Kentucky v. Tennessee, 217 U.S. 413, 54 L. Ed. 817, 30 S. Ct. 543 (1910)). The decision in Blake was also guided by the 
principle that, on a Rule 12 motion to dismiss, the court is required to accept the allegations of the complaint as true and to 
construe the complaint in the plaintiff's favor.  Blake, 1996 WL 13497 at *4. The same analysis and result apply here. "
1404,25," Defendant HMRI also argues that Plaintiffs' unjust enrichment claims must be dismissed because Plaintiffs have not alleged 
that they lack an adequate remedy at law. Plaintiffs' ability to plead in the alternative renders this argument moot. "
1406,26," Minnesota's long-arm statute, Minn. Stat. § 543.19 (1990), permits personal jurisdiction over nonresident foreign corporations 
that transact any business within the state or that ""commits any act outside Minnesota causing injury . . . in Minnesota"" in a 
cause of action arising from such acts. Minn. Stat. §§ 543.19(b), (d)."
1406,27," Tennessee's long-arm statute, Tenn. Code Ann. § 20-2-223(a)(1), (4) (1997), permits personal jurisdiction over ""a person who 
acts directly or indirectly, as to a claim for relief arising from the person's"" ""transacting any business"" in Tennessee or causing 
""tortious injury"" in Tennessee ""by an act or omission outside this state of the person who regularly does or solicits business, or 
engages in any other persistent course of conduct, or derives substantial revenue from goods used or consumed or services 
rendered,"" in Tennessee. The statute further provides for jurisdiction over a person who ""contracts to supply services or things"" 
in Tennessee. § 20-2-223(a)(2). "
1407,," Tennessee's long arm statute, Tenn. Code Ann. §§ 20-2-214(a)(1), (2) and (5), permits personal jurisdiction over non-resident 
foreign corporations ""as to any action or claim for relief arising from"" the ""transaction of any business within the state"", or ""any 
tortious act or omission within"" Tennessee, or ""entry into a contract for . . . materials to be furnished in"" Tennessee."
1407,28," Under the Fourteenth Amendment, the due process requirement serves two functions: (1) it protects the defendant against the 
burden of litigating in a distant or inconvenient forum; and (2) it ensures that the states do not reach out beyond the limits 
imposed on them as coequal sovereigns.  Handley v. Indiana & Michigan Electric Co., 732 F.2d 1265, 1271 (6th Cir. 1984). "
1408,29," Plaintiffs persuasively argue that antitrust injuries, by their nature, involve infliction of tortious injury, Chrysler Corp. v. Fedders 
Corp., 643 F.2d 1229, 1236 (6th Cir. 1981); Weinstein v. Norman M. Morris Corp., 432 F. Supp. 337, 344 (E.D. Mich. 1977), and 
that the courts have long recognized that ""the place of injury from a price-fixing conspiracy is the place of sale, since the 
consumer is injured at the time he pays the artificially inflated price."" In re Mid-Atlantic Toyota Antitrust Litig., 525 F. Supp. 1265, 
1274 (D. Md. 1981)."
1408,30," In light of this decision, it is unnecessary for the Court to address whether Plaintiffs have established a prima facie showing of 
jurisdiction under a conspiracy theory of jurisdiction. "
1410,31," Section 3.3 of the Guidelines provides that: ""antitrust analysis of intellectual property licensing arrangements examines 
whether the relationship among the parties to the arrangement is primarily horizontal or vertical in nature, or whether it has 
substantial aspects of both."" It further provides that, ""for analytical purposes, the Agencies ordinarily will treat a relationship "
1411,," between a licensor and its licensee, . . . , as horizontal when they would have been actual or likely potential competitors in a 
relevant market in the absence of a license."" "
1412,32," The Sherman Act Class Plaintiffs similarly allege that the relevant market is the U.S. market for Cardizem CD and its generic 
equivalents (P 65), and that prior to June 23, 1999, HMRI had a 100% share of the U.S. market for Cardizem CD and its generic 
bioequivalents (PP 3, 4, 48, 48, 66). Individual Sherman Act Plaintiffs CVS Meridian and Rite Aid likewise allege that the relevant 
market is the U.S. market for Cardizem CD and its bioequivalents (P 26)."
1412,33," The Individual Kroger Sherman Act Plaintiffs do not allege a relevant market nor do they allege that Defendants' Sherman Act 
violation can be analyzed under a rule of reason analysis. Rather, they allege that the violation is susceptible to per se analysis 
and under that analysis it isn't necessary to make allegations regarding the relevant market. As discussed above, this Court has 
determined that these Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged facts that allow their antitrust claims to be analyzed under a per se rule. "
1416,1," The District Court exercised jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331. We have appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and 
undertake plenary review of the District Court's order dismissing the plaintiff's complaint. "
1418,2," HN2[
] Vertical minimum price fixing is, of course, per se unlawful under section 1 of the Sherman Act, which outlaws ""every contract combination . . . or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states."" 15 U.S.C. § 1; see also Dr. 
Miles Med. Co. v. John D. Park. & Sons Co., 220 U.S. 373, 55 L. Ed. 502, 31 S. Ct. 376 (1911)."
1418,3," Albrecht's specific holding -- that vertical maximum price fixing is per se illegal -- has since been overruled. See State Oil Co. v. 
Khan, 522 U.S. 3, 7, 139 L. Ed. 2d 199, 118 S. Ct. 275 (1997). However, Atlantic Richfield's approach -- i.e. discerning the 
reasons that led the Supreme Court to label certain conduct a per se violation, and determining whether the harm suffered by 
the plaintiff is consistent with the rationale for labeling the defendant's conduct per se illegitimate -- remains valid and is clearly 
applicable to the case before us. "
1420,4," We recognize that various scholars have taken issue with the Supreme Court's per se treatment of vertical minimum price fixing 
agreements and argued that these agreements may have significant, procompetitive attributes. See, e.g., Antitrust Policy, 75 
Colum. L. Rev. at 283. But, academic commentary, even if persuasive, does not permit us to expand the antitrust injury 
requirement to a point which undermines the Court's categorical disapproval of vertical minimum price fixing. "
1426,1," On April 21, 2000, defendant Bidder's Edge, Inc. filed an ex parte motion for leave to file a supplemental declaration in order to 
respond to factual assertions in the reply. Although the court suspects that with reasonable diligence BE could have prepared 
the declaration at least by the hearing date, the declaration consists merely of the results of four searches performed on major 
Internet search engines. eBay's opposition did not cite any prejudice that would result from its filing. Accordingly, BE's motion is 
granted. "
1427,2," Programs that recursively query other computers over the Internet in order to obtain a significant amount of information are 
referred to in the pleadings by various names, including software robots, robots, spiders and web crawlers. "
1428,3," It is unclear who Peter Leeds is, except that his email address at the time was <peter@biddersedge.com>. "
1429,4,  Q: Are you aware of any complaints from eBay users about slowdowns that were caused by aggregators? A: No.
1429,5," BE appears to argue that this cannot be the case because searches performed on each of these search engines will return 
results that include eBay web pages. (Supp. Ploen Decl. PP 1-9.) However, this does not establish that these sites do not 
respect robot exclusion headers. There are numerous ways in which search engines can obtain information in compliance with 
exclusion headers, including; obtaining consent, abiding by the robot.txt file guidelines, or manually searching the sites. BE did 
not present any evidence of any site ever complaining about the activities of any of these search engines."
1429,6," The bulk of eBay's moving papers and declarations address the alleged misuse of the eBay mark and the information BE 
obtains from the eBay computers. The court does not address the facts specific to these claims, nor the merits of these claims. 
Even if eBay were able to establish a likelihood of success on the merits as to these causes of action, such a showing would 
only support injunctive relief addressing BE's use of the eBay mark and BE's use of the eBay auction listings (the appropriate 
relief for which would appear to be a disclaimer regarding the lack of affiliation between eBay and BE and explicitly alerting 
customers to the limited scope of BE's information). Such a showing would not be sufficient to enjoin BE from accessing eBay's 
computer systems, which is the only relief eBay appears to request. "
1430,7," eBay does not appear to offer any support for the proposition that unjust enrichment is an independent cause of action, let 
alone an independently adequate basis for preliminary injunctive relief."
1430,8," Although, as a practical matter, enjoining BE from accessing eBay's computers or searching eBay's auction database may 
result in BE's inability to make effective use of information from eBay's auction site."
1430,9," Thus, eBay's motion appears to be, in part, a tactical effort to increase the strength of its license negotiating position and not 
just a genuine effort to prevent irreparable harm."
1430,10," This case was filed on December 10, 1999. BE decommissioned a number of its servers in mid-December 1999. (See Mundy 
Depo. at 75:12-14.) Reformatting the hard drives resulted in the destruction of the server logs that may have indicated the actual 
duration of access to eBay's system. (See id. at 74:17-24.) eBay argues this should support an adverse inference against BE 
because eBay is unable to correlate BE's access to eBay's system with service disruptions. BE responds that these actions were 
a result of hardware failures unrelated to the litigation. The court agrees that these actions may support an inference that the 
information BE destroyed was prejudicial. However, final resolution of the fact-dependent questions regarding the circumstances 
under which this information was destroyed requires a more complete record. Accordingly, eBay is not entitled to a conclusive 
presumption of harm at this juncture in the proceedings, and eBay's motion to strike all evidence submitted by BE relating to a 
lack of harm is denied. "
1431,11," The phrase ""brick and mortar"" is often used to designate a traditional business when contrasting it with a predominantly, or 
entirely, on-line business. The phrase appears to refer to the historical reliance on conducting commerce within the context of a 
physical space made from materials such as brick and mortar, as opposed to the modem trend toward conducting commerce in 
a cyberspace made from computers programs."
1431,12," ""If 30 or 40 companies spring into existence using similar business models, what will be the total load and impact on eBay's 
servers?"""
1431,13," ""One crawler may currently use 1% of eBay's resources. What if hundred of users used similar crawlers?"""
1431,14," ""Given that Bidder's Edge can be seen to have imposed a load of 1.53 % on eBay's listing servers, simple arithmetic and 
economies reveal how only a few more such companies deploying rude robots [that do not respect the Robot Exclusion 
Standard] would be required before eBay would be brought to its knees by what would be then a debilitating load."" "
1432,15," As discussed below, eBay has a established a strong likelihood of success on the merits of the trespass claim, and is 
therefore entitled to preliminary injunctive relief because it has established the possibility of irreparable harm. Accordingly, the 
court does not reach the issue of whether the threat of increased activity would be sufficient to support preliminary injunctive 
relief where the plaintiff has not made as strong of a showing of likelihood of success on the merits."
1432,16," As other courts have noted, applying traditional legal principles to the Internet can be troublesome. See ImOn, Inc. v. 
ImaginOn, Inc., 90 F. Supp. 2d 345, 350, 2000 WL 310373, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (""Both parties are suppliers of 'services or 
products' on the Internet which, as I recognize and grapple with hereafter, is one of the most fluid, rapidly developing, and 
virtually daily changing areas of commerce that the law has had to focus upon and endeavor to apply established principles to."") "
1433,17," Because BE was expressly notified that its conduct was unauthorized, it does not matter whether BE ever agreed to a version 
of the eBay User Agreement that prohibited robotic activity. "
1436,18," Plaintiff believes that it may have experienced system failures and a decrease in system performance during the times that 
defendant was searching its system, however, it is unable to produce any correlation between its outages and defendant's 
activities. Plaintiff contends that it would likely be able to produce such a correlation but for defendant's alleged destruction of 
logs that recorded the details of its robotic search activities. "

Inc., 104 F. Supp. 2d 501, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5403 (W.D. Pa. 2000); Forces Action Project LLC v. California, 2000 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 163, 2000 WL 20977 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 5, 2000). "
1452,4," The statute defines a tobacco product manufacturer as an entity that (a) manufactures cigarettes intended for sale within the 
United States, or (b) is the first purchaser of cigarettes designated for sale abroad that intends to sell the cigarettes in the United 
States. See, e.g., id. § 104556(i). Thus, it applies to plaintiffs in this action."
1452,5," Despite this incentive, counsel stated at oral argument that not all participating states have passed a Qualifying Statute. "
1453,6," The parties dispute whether the Model Act directly tracks the legislative and administrative scheme created in 26 U.S.C. §§ 
5704(d), 5754(a), and 64 Fed. Reg. 71,918, 71,921 (1999). Regardless of whether the statutes overlap, the Model Act does not 
directly contradict the federal scheme, as discussed below."
1453,7," At the time plaintiffs filed the FAC, 23 states had passed versions of the Model Act. See FAC P 225. "
1455,8," Even if plaintiffs could show that the state defendants reasonably availed themselves of the benefits and protections of 
California, and that this purposeful availment led directly to plaintiffs' claims, the court would be required to determine whether 
jurisdiction over the state defendants is reasonable. Reasonableness is determined through the use of a seven-factor test, which 
examines: (1) the extent of purposeful injection into the forum; (2) burdens on the defendant from litigation in the forum; (3) 
conflict with the sovereignty of defendant's state; (4) the forum's interest in adjudicating the dispute; (5) efficiency; (6) importance 
of the forum to plaintiff's interest in expeditious relief; and (7) existence of an alternative forum. See Ziegler, 64 F.3d at 474-75. 
Balancing this set of factors, California jurisdiction over the other states is unreasonable. As described above, the other states have, at best, a tenuous connection to California under the terms of the MSA, making any 
""purposeful injection"" minimal. The burden on the other states from litigating in California is substantial; even if they file briefs 
jointly (as they have in this litigation), they must still monitor every filing, given that they would be bound by any decision of the 
court if jurisdiction were found to exist. The conflict with state sovereignty is perhaps the most compelling factor -- requiring the 
states to submit to California jurisdiction constitutes an extreme impingement on state sovereignty. Plaintiffs have characterized 
their suit primarily as one challenging the Qualifying Statute and Model Act rather than the MSA. See Ps' Opp. to Private Ds' 
Mot. at 2. Not all states have passed a version of the Qualifying Statute and the Model Act. If and when such statutes are 
enacted, the states have a strong interest in having their own courts determine the legitimacy of the legislation. California has an 
interest in determining the legitimacy of the MSA and California's versions of the two related statutes, but has little interest in 
adjudicating disputes over other states' statutes. Numerous alternative fora exist, though each of these faces the same 
jurisdictional limitations as this court. The efficiency factor, unlike the others, favors jurisdiction in this court. On balance, the 
concerns indicating a lack of jurisdiction over other states in this forum outweigh those favoring a finding of jurisdiction. "
1456,9," HN14[
] Under § 1 of the Sherman Act, ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal."" 15 U.S.C. § 1. HN15[
] Section 2 of the Act provides, ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign 
nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony."" Id. § 2. "
1457,10," HN16[
] Section 4 of the Clayton Act allows victims of antitrust violations to sue in federal court and receive trebled damages and the cost of suit. See 15 U.S.C. § 15. Section 16 allows for injunctive relief. See id. § 26."
1457,11," To the extent plaintiffs seek damages for defendants' alleged conspiracy to raise prices, they lack standing to bring such a 
challenge. Under Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707, 97 S. Ct. 2061 (1977), a plaintiff seeking such 
damages must be a direct purchaser of the products at issue. See Illinois Brick, 431 U.S. at 736. Plaintiffs argue that they are 
suing as competitors rather than customers, but competitors lack standing to bring a suit for conspiracy to raise prices. See 
Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 582-83, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538, 106 S. Ct. 1348 (1986)."
1457,12," Plaintiffs imply that another exception to the doctrine might exist when the government acts as a commercial entity rather than 
a sovereign (though they primarily use this argument with respect to the state action doctrine, discussed below). No such 
""commercial exception"" exists to the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. See In re Airport Car Rental Antitrust Litigation, 693 F.2d 84, 88 
(9th Cir. 1982) (""There is no commercial exception to Noerr-Pennington.""). "
1458,13," Plaintiffs contend that the private defendants' other allegedly anticompetitive activities should render their actions with respect 
to the MSA unprotected. Relying on Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777, 82 S. 
Ct. 1404 (1962), they argue that ""acts which are themselves legal lose that character when they become constituent elements of 
an unlawful scheme."" Ps' Opp. to Private Ds at 9. That case's applicability to the instant case is dubious. As the Supreme Court 
pointed out in Pennington, Continental Ore involved a purchasing agent of an American corporation, not a public official. When a 
public official was involved, the Pennington Court rejected Continental Ore in favor of the doctrine enunciated in Noerr: ""Joint 
efforts to influence public officials do not violate the antitrust laws even though intended to eliminate competition. Such conduct 
is not illegal, either standing alone or as part of a broader scheme itself violative of the Sherman Act."" Pennington, 381 U.S. at 
670. "
1459,14," Another case plaintiffs' counsel relied on at oral argument, Clipper Exxpress v. Rocky Mountain Motor Tariff Bureau, Inc, 690 
F.2d 1240 (9th Cir. 1982), is likewise unavailing. As Judge Alarcon explained, the conduct at issue there was not intended to 
influence governmental action. See Clipper Exxpress, 690 F.2d at 1253. Moreover, to the extent the case discusses the sham 
exception to Noerr-Pennington, it preceded the Supreme Court's definitive statement of the sham exception pleading 
requirements, PREI, by more than a decade."
1459,15," The state defendants note that this ""market participant"" exception -- which has never been found in a Supreme Court case, as 
plaintiffs' counsel acknowledged at oral argument -- might no longer be good law given the Supreme Court's recent decisions in 
College Sav. Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Educ. Expense Bd., 527 U.S. 627, 144 L. Ed. 2d 575, 119 S. Ct. 2199 "
1460,," (1999), and Seminole Tribe v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 134 L. Ed. 2d 252, 116 S. Ct. 1114 (1996), severely limiting Congress's 
authority to subject states to private suit. While the argument has undeniable force, determination of the issue is not necessary 
for the resolution of this matter."
1460,16," At oral argument, plaintiffs cited 324 Liquor Corp. v. Duffy, 479 U.S. 335, 93 L. Ed. 2d 667, 107 S. Ct. 720 (1987); Columbia 
Steel Casting Co. v. Portland Gen. Elec. Co., 111 F.3d 1427 (9th Cir. 1997); and Knudsen Corp. v. Nevada State Dairy Comm'n, 
676 F.2d 374 (9th Cir. 1982) in support of their position. Because all of these cases use a Midcal analysis, they are irrelevant to 
the instant dispute. "
1461,17," Nor could they, in light of the fact that the private defendants have secured preliminary injunctions against the vendors of 
repatriated cigarettes in two of the suits and survived motions to dismiss in two others. "
1462,18," The private defendants correctly note that, given their private status, no constitutional case or controversy exists as applied to 
them."
1462,19," The allegations in this section of the complaint are broadly worded, encompassing violations of the Commerce Clause, the 
Supremacy Clause, the Equal Protection Clause, and the Due Process Clauses as well. While plaintiffs also allege that the 
Model Act ""impermissibly burdens interstate commerce,"" FAC P 380, the FAC does not mention the Model Act in the context of 
the Interstate Compact Clause until the final paragraph of the claim, in which plaintiffs allege, ""The MSA, Qualifying Statute and 
Model Act constitute an Interstate Compact which has not been approved by Congress . . ."" Id. P 389."
1462,20," In keeping with its finding that it lacks jurisdiction over the non-California state defendants, the Court will analyze the Interstate 
Compact Clause claim as it applies to California."
1462,21," Neither the Commerce Clause nor the Supremacy Clause argument has merit, as explained below. See §§ VIC and E, infra. "
1463,22," Money in the escrow account, if not used to pay a judgment or settlement, is returned with interest. See MSA Exh. T at T-4. "
1465,23," Plaintiffs allege that defendants are increasing prices by more than the amount needed to cover the payments into the MSA 
fund. See FAC P 215 (""The price increases were far greater than required to fund the settlement proceeds, with an additional 
26.2 [cents] per pack added purely to increase the profits of the Original Corporate Defendants.""). If plaintiffs' business is based 
in part on being able to undercut the OCDs' prices, presumably they would still be able to do this under the Qualifying Statute by 
only increasing their prices to cover the Escrow Fund payments, without adding the alleged premium. "
1466,24," The court in Premium Tobacco came to a similar conclusion. Judge Kane found that the purpose of the MSA was to raise the 
retail price of cigarettes to decrease the quantity of sales, especially to minors, in furtherance of the state's health and safety 
goals. See Premium Tobacco, 51 F. Supp. 2d at 1105, 1106. The court analyzed the Model Act as a means to eliminate a 
loophole in the MSA and further these goals. See id. "
1467,25," Plaintiff cites Michelin Tire, 423 U.S. at 288, and Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel, 26 F. Supp. 2d 1022, 1026, for the contrary 
proposition. Michelin Tire does not address the issue. Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel cites the Import-Export Clause as an example 
of the Framers' intent to vest exclusive power to regulate foreign trade with the federal government; nothing in this analysis 
contradicts that elementary proposition."
1467,26," The other statutes mentioned in the FAC are: 27 C.F.R. 290.185 (regulation requiring cigarettes exported from the United 
States to be marked ""for use outside U.S."" or other words to that effect); 19 C.F.R. §§ 11.1 to 11.3 (regulations governing the "
1468,," importation of foreign tobacco products); 19 U.S.C. § 81c (statute governing the exemption from customs laws of merchandise 
brought into a foreign trade zone); and 15 U.S.C. § 1202 (statute governing exemptions to laws concerning flammable fabrics). 
The FAC also mentions various unspecified federal laws and regulations, including Federal Trade Commission regulations, 
antitrust laws, and regulations of U.S. Customs, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease 
Control, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. See FAC PP 413, 418. Another court 
has described this collection as ""a litany of federal statutes regulating the foreign purchase of American made cigarettes, 
repatriation of these cigarettes under customs law, the federal guidelines assuring compliance with cigarette labeling 
requirements, and the payment of an excise tax on the repatriated cigarettes."" Premium Tobacco, 51 F. Supp. 2d at 1106. "
1469,27," As noted above, the Qualifying Statute applies to all manufacturers as well as distributors of tobacco products intended for 
foreign distribution. It thus seeks to ensure that all ""first sellers"" of tobacco products within a state ""pay their way,"" by contributing 
to the state fund or the escrow fund. "
1470,28," Plaintiffs cannot establish that they are statutorily immune from suit, much less that the legislature acted irrationally in 
concluding otherwise. "
1474,*," District Judge of the Eastern District of Louisiana, sitting by designation. "
1475,1," Eleven Line, Inc., is the corporate successor of another Higginson-owned company that actually managed PBSC for several 
years. Because the corporate identity is immaterial to this opinion, we refer to the plaintiff as PBSC throughout."
1475,2," After PBSC entered the market, the other indoor arena folded."
1475,3," Many members of outdoor teams either decided to rest through the off-season or to participate in other sports and leisure and 
extra-curricular activities. "
1476,4," To become a sanctioned arena, PBSC would have to pay a nominal fee ($ 25) to NTSSA each year and would have to 
purchase and charge NTSSA-registered players about $ 12 for ID cards, remitting part of the charge to NTSSA for player 
insurance and NTSSA's overhead."
1476,5," OSA's official history reports that there were 700 registered players in 1990, and Barbara K. Peterson testified to the number 
registered at time of trial. In Midland, Connie Stahl testified, there were over 3,000 registered players at the date of trial. "
1477,6," On November 22, 1995, PBSC's attorney sent a letter demanding that NTSSA not enforce the unsanctioned play rule."
1477,7," The record does contain a half dozen or so letters from soccer players or their parents, attaching requests for ""reinstatement"" 
together with the $ 2 refiling fee. There is no evidence that any player was denied permission to play on account of not paying 
the refiling fee."
1477,8," PBSC also alleged tortious interference with contract and business relations claims dependent on the finding of antitrust 
violations, which would vitiate defendants' right to rely upon the unsanctioned play rule. "
1478,9," The court first entered judgment on the verdict finding a per se § 1 violation, but on reconsideration, he wisely chose the 
alternate ground of an unreasonable restraint of trade. See, e.g.  Nat'l Soc'y of Prof'l Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 
691, 98 S. Ct. 1355, 1365, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1978)."
1478,10," Congress wished to address the disorganization and factionalism of amateur sports organizations in the United States, a 
disorganization which it felt had contributed to the overall decline of American achievement in international competition. See 
H.R. Rep.; Behagen v. Amateur Basketball Ass'n of the United States, 884 F.2d 524, 527 (10th Cir. 1989). "
1479,11, USSF is the NGB for soccer.
1479,12," For similar reasons, PBSC's state law actions are not preempted by the ASA. The ASA has not totally occupied the field, and 
the state law actions are not inconsistent with the ASA's statutory scheme."
1479,13," See, e.g., Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585, 105 S. Ct. 2847, 86 L. Ed. 2d 467 (1985); NCAA

1480,14," NTSSA received a $ 25 annual fee from each sanctioned indoor soccer facility and could earn, at most, a few thousand dollars 
(net of insurance costs) from player registrations at an indoor arena like PBSC. Presumably, NTSSA did earn some small sums 
after PBSC closed, because a sanctioned indoor facility, Sticks and Kicks, took the place of PBSC in the market."

1480,16," We decline to endorse and do not rule on the district court's application of a § 2 ""monopolistic leveraging"" theory of liability. 
This theory, based on Berkey Photo, Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 603 F.2d 263, 275 (2d Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1093, 
62 L. Ed. 2d 783, 100 S. Ct. 1061 (1980), is the subject of a circuit split. See M & M Medical Supplies and Service, Inc. v. 
Pleasant Valley Hosp., Inc., 981 F.2d 160, 168-69 (4th Cir. 1992) (en banc), cert. denied, 508 U.S. 972, 113 S. Ct. 2962, 125 L. 
Ed. 2d 662 (1993) (declining to determine whether there exists a claim for monopoly leveraging that differs materially from the 
classic claim for monopolization); Fineman v. Armstrong World Industries, Inc., 980 F.2d 171, 204-06 (3d Cir. 1992), cert. "
1481,," denied.  507 U.S. 921, 113 S. Ct. 1285, 122 L. Ed. 2d 677 (1993) (rejecting monopoly leveraging); Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. United 
Airlines, Inc., 948 F.2d 536, 547 n.16 (9th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 503 U.S. 977, 112 S. Ct. 1603, 118 L. Ed. 2d 316 (1992) 
(rejecting monopoly leveraging). In addition to the leveraging theory, the district court's judgment rested on § 2 monopolization 
and attempt to monopolize claims, which is affected by our refusal to endorse the leverating theory Because the jury instructions 
regarding § 2 violation allowed the jury to find a violation if the defendants used their monopoly power ""to gain a competitive 
advantage"" even if the defendants did not attempt to monopolize the second market, the jury's verdict regarding the § 2 violation 
is completely tainted and must be overturned."
1481,17," This court has defined the two methods as follows: HN4[
] The before and after theory compares the plaintiff's profit record prior to the violation with that subsequent to it. 
The before and after theory is not easily adaptable to a plaintiff who is driven out of business before he is able to compile 
an earnings record sufficient to allow estimation of lost profits. Therefore, the yardstick test is sometimes employed. It 
consists of a study of the profits of business operations that are closely comparable to the plaintiff's. Although allowances 
can be made for differences between the firms, the business used as a standard must be as nearly identical to the plaintiff's 
as possible. Lehrman v. Gulf Oil Corp., 500 F.2d 659, 667 (5th Cir. 1974)."
1481,18," Lost profits is a measure of proof recognized by Texas courts for tortious interference claims. Under state law, such damages 
must be proved with reasonable particularity. See Kevin S. Marshall & Kurt J. Beron, Statistics & the Law: Proving Lost Profits, 2 
Texas Wesleyan L.R. 467, 468 (1996) (hereinafter, ""Beron""). Because the Texas standard appears to be more demanding than 
the antitrust standard, it follows that PBSC's proof would be inadequate to support the state law portion of the verdict. "
1482,19," The long-term debt owed by the facility to Higginson's group and 84 Lumber increased from $ 183,000 in 1990 to $ 231,000 in 
the last full year of operation."
1482,20," Compare Beron, supra note 18, at 471-72 (evidence that a plaintiff's business lost money from the very beginning, never 
turned a profit or never got out of red ink will preclude recovery of lost profits in Texas law) (citations omitted). "
1483,21," Perhaps the projections of PBSC's lost net revenue were to be increased based on Higginson's testimony that he planned to 
move to flex scheduling and thus add more seasons of adult play. If so, however, Dr. Beron's estimates do not account for this 
change in any way, as the estimated ""profit"" margins and lost ""profits"" are based solely on the experience of other indoor arenas, 
which was not shown to be comparable. "
1488,1," We accept as true the facts as alleged in the complaint.  Bald Eagle School District v. Keystone Financial, Inc., 189 F.3d 321, 
327 n.7 (3d Cir. 1999)."
1488,2," The Barr Laboratories' case was subsequently remanded to the Southern District of New York. At oral argument, counsel 
represented that this portion of the litigation has settled. "
1492,3," In McCarthy, we acknowledged the appropriateness of injunctive relief, but remanded because the District Court had not 
expressly addressed the question of indirect purchaser standing. "
1499,1," In support of the Motion to Transfer, RJR submitted: a notice of motion to transfer venue to the United States District Court for

District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina (the ""Moving Brief""), declaration of Guy M. Blynn in support of Defendant's

F. Supp. 2d 317, 320 (D.N.J. 1998); Tischio, 16 F. Supp. 2d at 519 n.9; Honeywell, 817 F. Supp. at 479 n. 16. As well, Third 
Circuit decisions such as Lony I, Lony v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co., 935 F.2d 604, 609 (3d Cir. 1991) (hereinafter ""Lony II "") 
and Lacey I, which involve motions to dismiss under the doctrine of forum non conveniens, are relevant to a motion to transfer 
under Section 1404(a). District Courts have broader discretion to transfer an action under Section 1404(a), than to dismiss under the common law 
doctrine of forum non conveniens. See Norwood v. Kirkpatrick, 349 U.S. 29, 32, 99 L. Ed. 789, 75 S. Ct. 544 (1955); Joint Stock 
Soc. Trade House of Descendants of Peter Smirnoff, Official Purveyor to the Imperial Court v. Heublein, Inc., 936 F. Supp. 177, 
191 (D.Del. 1996) (citation omitted); Ruccolo v. BDP, Int'l, Inc., 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21632, No. 95-2300, 1996 WL 735575, at 
17 & n. 9 (D.N.J. 25 Mar. 1996); cf.  Lacey v. Cessna Aircraft Co., 932 F.2d 170 (3d Cir.), reh'g denied en banc (3d Cir. 1991)

1507,12," Upon review of the Gallo Declaration, it appears the paragraphs are improperly designated. Specifically, Liggett has omitted 
the numeral ""three"" and as a result the paragraphs are designated 1-2 and 4-14. All references to the Gallo Declaration are to 
the paragraphs as they appear in the Gallo Declaration. "
1508,13," As mentioned, it appears Liggett is comprised of five components: an executive unit, manufacturing unit and three co-equal 
marketing and sales units (headquartered in New Jersey, Texas and North Carolina). See Toulon Declaration at PP 3-4."
1508,14," In addition, the 1998 SEC Form 10-K (the ""1998 SEC Form 10-K"") filed by Liggett indicates that ""Liggett's products are 
distributed from a central distribution center in Durham, North Carolina …."" See 1998 SEC Form 10-K, attached as Ex. 1 to the 
Blynn Declaration. "
1509,15," Upon review of the Toulon Declaration, it appears the Northeast Sales Area includes Connecticut, Delaware, the District of 
Columbia, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, 
Rhode Island, most of West Virginia and Vermont. See Toulon Declaration at n. 2. The Southern Sales Area includes Alabama, 
Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, half of Texas and Virginia. See id. at n. 1. "
1510,16," As mentioned, Liggett also alleges violations of the New Jersey Antitrust Act, N.J.S.A. 56:9-3, see Complaint at PP 40-43, and 
brought a claim for tortious interference with business relations, see id. at PP 44-48. Liggett alleges the court has supplemental 
jurisdiction over these allegations pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a). See id. at P 11. "
1511,17," In this regard, RJR established that it has fourteen sales offices located throughout the United States. See Blynn Declaration 
at P 4. Specifically, its sales offices are located in California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, 
Minnesota, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia and Washington. See id. It appears the RJR national 
sales offices are comprised of a total of 88 division sales managers, more than 700 sales representatives and 735 retail account 
representatives. See id. It appears the New Jersey regional sales office is staffed by only 8 full-time employees and 6 part-time 
employees. See id. It appears, moreover, that only 9 out of 1,435 RJR sales employees call on retail accounts in New Jersey. 
See id. RJR further established that the regional sales offices report to, and are supervised by, the RJR management team, 
located in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. See id. at P 9."
1511,18," In further support of transfer to North Carolina, RJR cites GPA v. Liggett Group, Inc., 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14043, 1994 WL 
537017 (S.D.N.Y. 1994). See Moving Brief at 4; Blynn Declaration at P 14, Ex. 6. In GPA, in response to suit being brought 
against Liggett in New York, Liggett filed a motion to transfer to the Middle District of North Carolina, pursuant to Section 1404. 
See Blynn Declaration at P 14, Ex. 6. Although the motion to transfer was denied, Liggett argued, in part, that ""requiring Liggett 
to have virtually its entire senior management come to New York [from North Carolina] for trial would be unnecessarily disruptive 
to its operations."" See Memorandum of Law in support of Defendant's Motion to Transfer, attached as Ex. 6 to the Blynn 
Declaration."
1511,19," Party witnesses are presumed to be willing to testify in either forum despite any inconvenience, and therefore, the relative 
convenience of such witnesses carries little weight. See Quickturn Design Sys., 77 F. Supp. 2d at 510 (stating that ""the 
convenience of witnesses [who] are employees of a party carries no weight because the parties are obligated to procure their 
attendance at trial.""); Hillard v. Guidant Corp., 76 F. Supp. 2d 566, 570 (M.D.Pa. 1999)."
1511,20," RJR further argued that because the ""overwhelming majority of the relevant documents and knowledgeable personnel are 
located in North Carolina …. [RJR] commits to exercise reasonable efforts to make any past and present employees not already 
located in North Carolina and who could have been subpoenaed by this court reasonably available for trial in North Carolina, at 
its cost …."" Blynn Declaration at P 12. "
1512,21," While neither party argued material party witnesses will be unavailable if the instant litigation takes place in either New Jersey 
or North Carolina, it appears Liggett indicated that various employees who may provide relevant testimony will have to travel 
regardless of the fora. See Gallo Declaration at P 6 (stating that ""roughly equal numbers of Liggett's relevant witnesses and 
documents will be drawn from New Jersey, North Carolina, and Texas."")."
1512,22," In further support of its argument, Liggett asserted that New Jersey is serviced by Newark International Airport (""NIA""), while 
both Winston-Salem and Greensboro, North Carolina are serviced by Piedmont Triad International (""PTI""). See Opp. Brief at 11. 
As evidence of convenience, Liggett merely observed that NIA has nearly 500 daily domestic passenger flights compared to 
seventy-seven daily passenger flights at PTI. See Gallo Declaration at Ex. E. "
1513,23," Liggett's focus on the affect of the alleged anticompetitive conduct on New Jersey consumers is unavailing. See Opp. Brief at 
14. As mentioned, Liggett does not discuss, much more focus, on New Jersey consumers in the Complaint. Rather, Liggett 
alleges the EDLP plan is violative of the Federal antitrust laws on a national level. See eg. Complaint at P 1 (""The purpose and 
effect of RJR's illegal conduct has been to impede the functions of the marketplace by reducing consumer choice, raising prices 
paid by consumers, and foreclosing competition in the manufacture and sale of discount cigarettes throughout the United 
States."") (emphasis added). Liggett, moreover, specifically alleges that as a result of the EDLP plan it ""has sold significantly 
fewer cigarettes."" Complaint at P 4. It appears Liggett did not realign its sights on New Jersey consumers until it submitted its opposition to the Motion to Transfer. 
Indeed, even assuming the ""local interests"" in this litigation centered on retailers and consumers, it appears North Carolina has a 
more compelling interest in this matter than New Jersey. "
1526,1," These matters were separately appealed (cases Nos. B125295 and B129637) but were later consolidated by order of this court 
upon application of AT&T Corp."
1526,2, Telcom and Globalwise are not parties to this appeal.
1526,3," We will sometimes refer to Starfire, Global-Tel and Supply Network collectively as ""appellants."" Plaintiffs and appellants Oliver 
Duggal and Michael Hauser are the officers, owners or operators of appellants and when we refer to those companies, we 
include Duggal and Hauser by reference. "
1527,4," We will sometimes refer to ATT and GE collectively as ""respondents."" "
1531,5," To the extent appellants' allegations concerning ATT's efforts to impose ""roadblocks"" to its resellers by servicing accounts 
slowly might be read to state a claim for tortious interference with business relations, we reject such a contention. First, as just 
noted, their cause of action seeks compensatory damages under common law for ATT's failure to provide services and 
privileges not set forth in the tariff. Justice Stevens's dissent, however, was based on evidence of misconduct which bore no 
relation to the tariff. Second, appellants have waived the argument by failing to raise it. Instead, their brief is confined to 
arguments in support of a negligence claim and no others."
1531,6," Further, the Central Office court was aware that the plaintiff in that action was also a competitor of ATT, since their competitive 
relationship formed the basis of the claim for tortious interference with business relations."
1531,7," To the extent appellants purport to raise any other grounds in support of this argument, we deem them waived. (Landry v. 
Berryessa Union School Dist. (1995) 39 Cal. App. 4th 691, 699-700 [46 Cal. Rptr. 2d 119].) "
1532,8," Our holding in this regard should come as no surprise to appellants, at least in regard to their Telcom contracts, which 
expressly provided that the terms of any applicable tariffs took precedence over the contract terms. "
1533,9," Even though GE did not raise its tariff as a ground for its demurrers to the third amended complaint, we deem it proper to base 
our decision on this ground. GE's tariff was before the trial court as part of appellants' motion to reconsider the order sustaining 
GE's demurrers to the third amended complaint. Appellants did not object to GE's raising the filed rate doctrine issue on appeal 
and in fact placed it before this court by addressing it in their opening brief. Finally, HN24[
] since the tariff has the force of law (Marcus v. AT&T Corp., supra, 138 F.3d at p. 56) we are obliged to take judicial notice of it. (Evid. Code, § 451, subd. (a).) "
1543,1," The Sherman Act Plaintiffs include all Plaintiffs in the Sherman Act class cases and the Sherman Act individual cases 
consolidated in this Court, Case Nos. 99-73870, 99-73259, 99-73735, and 99-75036. "
1545,2," A list of patents believed to be covered by a pioneer drug product or its use must be submitted to the FDA, and the patents are 
listed in a publication titled ""Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,"" commonly known as the 
""Orange Book."""
1545,3," The FDA's approval of Andrx's ANDA meant that FDA had found that the Andrx drug was ""bioequivalent"" to Cardizem CD and 
this in turn would make it possible, if not required, for pharmacists to fill prescriptions for Cardizem CD with Andrx's generic 
version of that drug. See Decl. of HMRI expert, A. Bennett, at P 6. "
1546,4," Andrx further explained that ""in addition to adding a small amount of a new ingredient to the SR2 bead coating, the Prior 
Approval Supplement submitted on September 11, 1998 requests permission to change the current 0.1 N HC1 dissolution 
specification for the SR2 bead from 'not less than 55% of the total diltiazem released after 18 hours' to 'not less than 65% of the 
total diltiazem released after 18 hours'. As clearly shown by the dissolution profiles attached hereto as Exhibit B, and more 
importantly the new 0.1 N HC1 dissolution specification of 'not less than 65% of the total diltiazem being released after 18 hours', 
neither the Andrx CARTIA XT product nor the individual SR1 beads and SR2 beads employed in the Andrx CARTIA XT product 
exhibit a dissolution profile that is within the three (3) specific dissolution ranges required by claims 1-9 of U.S.  5,470,584 and 
therefore cannot infringe any claim of U.S.  5,470,584."" Id. at 11. "
1548,5," The Supreme Court has observed that ""the FTC Act's prohibition of unfair competition and deceptive acts or practices, 15 
U.S.C. § 45(a)(1), overlaps the scope of § 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1, aimed at prohibiting restraint of trade"".

as per se illegal includes price fixing, group boycotts, horizontal market allocation, resale price maintenance, and tying

1553,7," The Agreement provided three opportunities for Andrx to exercise its option to obtain a license, including an opportunity to 
exercise its option and obtain a license while the HMRI/Andrx suit remained pending; i.e., in January 2000 (18 months after FDA 
approval of the Andrx Product). See HMRI/Andrx Agreement P6(A)(ii). "
1554,8," The HMRI/Andrx Agreement provided that, in the event there was a final unappealable determination in the HMRI/Andrx patent 
case that did not determine the validity, enforceability or infringement of the '584 patent and HMRI notified Andrx in writing within 
30 days that it continued to believe that the Andrx Product infringed the '584 patent and that it would refile its action and did so 
within the time frame set forth in P 8(C), then this renewed action would continue the obligations and rights set forth in the 
Agreement as if no final, unappealable determination had been entered. See HMRI/Andrx Agreement at P 8(C). Accordingly, 
these interim payments and Andrx's agreement not to begin commercial marketing of the Andrx Product or to compromise its 
right to the 180-day period of exclusivity could continue beyond the time a final and unappealable judgment or order took effect 
in the HMRI/Andrx patent case."
1554,9," HMRI and Andrx stipulated that, for the purposes of this Agreement, ""the profits that Andrx would have realized from the sale of 
the Andrx Product would be $ 100 million per year after FDA approval."" HMRI/Andrx Agreement at P 3(A). "
1556,10," In support of this position, Defendant HMRI proffers the testimony of its expert, G. Methvin, opining that it was more likely than 
not that HMRI would have prevailed on its patent infringement claims, that the Court would have adopted the claim construction 
urged by Defendant HMRI, and that HMRI would have been entitled to a preliminary injunction in the HMRI/Andrx patent 
infringement case. HN26[
] The Court does not consider this testimony because it inappropriately renders an opinion on 
questions of law that rest solely within the province of the Court; i.e., claim construction and the grant or denial of injunctive 
relief."
1556,11," Defendants refer to this as competing ""without the threat of economic ruin."" See Andrx Br. at 27."
1556,12," Mr. Lodin's testimony is also belied by: (1) his earlier testimony that Andrx's ""primary goal was to begin selling our product as 
soon as we could prudently do so, in order to provide consumers with a genuine alternative to HMR's brand name drug and to 
demonstrate that Andrx was a serious participant in the generic pharmaceutical industry"", Id. at P 5; and (2) contemporaneous 
public statements in 1997 and 1998 by both HMRI and Andrx showing that they had no trouble recognizing that they were one 
another's competitors in the relevant market. See Jt. App., Tab 2 at 37, October 1997 Andrx Amendment No. 1 to S-1 filing 
(where, in SEC filings, Andrx represented to its shareholders that it had submitted ANDAs to the FDA covering, inter alia, 
bioequivalent versions of ""Cardizem CD which is marketed by HMR . . . . In September 1997 [Andrx] received tentative FDA 
approval of its ANDA for the bioequivalent version of Cardizem/registered trademark/ CD. As a result of the HMR Litigation, the 
FDA may not grant final approval of Andrx's ANDA for Cardizem/registered trademark/CD until after either the HMR Litigation is 
resolved in Andrx's favor or July 3, 1998 (30 months after HMRI received Andrx's certification that its product does not infringe "
1557,," the patents listed for Cardizem/registered trademark /CD""). See also Jt. App., Tab 5 at 9, 1998 Hoechst AG 20-F filing (where 
HMRI also specifically warned its shareholders that generic competition for its products in general would ""erode market share 
and sales revenues"" and, in particular, generic sales of Cardizem CD ""would have a material adverse effect on the operating 
profit of the Group"" and further observed that ""although Cardizem CD . . . is protected by formulation patents that prevent 
competition by others using the same formulation, a number of companies have filed for approval by the United States Food and 
Drug Administration (""FDA"") of generically substitutable once-daily diltiazem formulations (at least one of which has been 
approved for marketing), which they assert do not infringe these patents. Should any of these products be marketed and not 
infringe HMR's patents, it likely would have a material adverse effect on Cardizem CD sales and could have a material adverse 
effect on the operating profit of the Group. Marketing of such a product could occur as early as 1999"")."
1557,13," See S. Lodin Decl. at PP 8, 14-16, 19, 22 (where Andrx's Vice President/General Counsel testifies that, prior to the time Andrx 
entered into the HMRI/Andrx Agreement, Andrx had already decided that it would not enter the market until the HMRI/Andrx 
patent suit was resolved and had already decided that it would not abandon its pending ANDA). The Supreme Court, apparently 
ignoring a similar defense, held a horizontal market allocation agreement per se illegal under § 1 of the Sherman Act. In Palmer, 
the defendant who agreed to withdraw from the Georgia market submitted an affidavit in the district court similarly averring that it 
had unilaterally decided to withdraw from the Georgia market before it entered into the challenged agreement. See Palmer v. 
BRG of Georgia, Inc., 874 F.2d 1417, 1418 (11th Cir. 1989), rev'd, 498 U.S. 46, 112 L. Ed. 2d 349, 111 S. Ct. 401 (1990). 
Without regard to the defendant's affidavit as to its unilateral decision, the Supreme Court examined the challenged agreement 
on its face and held that the horizontal market allocation agreement in Palmer was illegal per se. See Palmer, 111 S. Ct. at 403. "
1559,14," HMRI had available the entire 30-month waiting period under Hatch-Waxman in which to seek an injunction. Andrx could not 
enter the market until that two and one-half year period expired, but HMRI did not seek any such relief in the HMRI/Andrx patent 
action. Had HMRI sought and obtained injunctive relief, it would have obtained Noerr-Pennington immunity, protected its patent, 
and could have sought a Rule 65(c) bond that, most likely, would not require it to pay interim quarterly payments to Andrx in the 
amount of $ 10 million. HMRI, however, did not seek an injunction. "
1560,," Unlike a court-ordered preliminary injunction, this Agreement was never presented to, filed in, or approved by the court presiding 
over the HMRI/Andrx patent case. The restraints embodied in the HMRI/Andrx Agreement are the result of a purely private 
agreement and, as this Court has previously determined, are not immune from antitrust liability under the Noerr-Pennington 
doctrine. See Order No. 12, Mem. Op. & Order Denying Defendants' Motions to Dismiss at 25-45. Here, there was no judicial 
finding that HMRI was likely to succeed on the merits of its infringement suit, that HMRI would suffer irreparable injury, that a 
balancing of the equities and consideration of the public's interest weighed in favor of granting a preliminary injunction in HMRI's 
favor, and that a Rule 65(c) bond was warranted in an amount equal to the amounts to be paid out under the HMRI/Andrx 
Agreement. Rather than seeking an injunction from the court, the parties agreed to keep the terms and existence of the 
Agreement confidential and further agreed that the Agreement, any drafts, or supporting documents were not to be introduced 
into evidence in the pending HMRI/Andrx patent action or any other litigation. As one commentator has observed, ""were one competitor to agree to pay, and to pay, another to leave a business in order to 
eliminate its competition, all would accept that ordinarily there had been a per se antitrust violation. A similar anti-competitive 
result can be achieved, in a more innocent-appearing manner, if the patent owner pays money, or gives an infringer some thing 
of value, to be subject to a patent injunction, especially if the injunction is broader than the claims. Ordinarily, consideration flows 
the other way; the infringer pays some amount to the patent owner for past infringement and then agrees to be subject to an 
injunction for the remaining life of the patent, or is granted a license."" Robert J. Hoerner, Antitrust Pitfalls in Patent Litigation 
Settlement Agreements, 8 Fed. Circuit B.J. 113, 122 (Summer 1998). ""If the patent owner pays the infringer, and if the infringer 
settles by accepting an injunction, or agrees to abandon the field, scrutiny is warranted."" Id. at 123. "
1566,1," Despite their surprise, compounded no doubt by the Court's refusal on May 24th to allow discovery and take testimony on the 
issue, Microsoft's attorneys were promptly able to tender a 35-page ""Offer of Proof,"" summarizing in detail the testimony 16 
witnesses would give to explain why plaintiffs' proposed remedy, in its entirety, is a bad idea. Within a week they added seven 
more. "
1567,2," Two states dissented from the imposition of structural remedies but fully supported the remainder of the relief proposed. The 
absence of total unanimity merely confirms the collaborative character of the process by which the proposed final judgment was 
formulated. "
1574,1," The clerk of circuit court at the time this matter arose was Gary J. Barczak. John Barrett was the successor clerk, and his name 
was substituted in the caption."
1574,2," Subsequent references are to the 1995-96 volumes of the Wisconsin Statutes unless otherwise stated. In 1997, the legislature amended Wis. Stat. § 806.10(3) to remove the treble damages provision. See Wis. Stat. § 806.10(3) 
(1997-98); 1997 Wis. Act 27, § 5175m. "
1575,3, See Wis. Stat. § 806.06(1)(b).
1575,4," See Wis. Stat. § 806.10(1). HN5[
] Wisconsin Stat. § 59.40(2)(e) provides that ""a clerk of circuit court shall . . . keep a judgment and lien docket of all money judgments of the court . . . ."" See also Wis. Stat. § 779.07."
1575,5, See Wis. Stat. § 806.15(1).
1575,6," The record and oral arguments reveal that docketing has been computerized in most Wisconsin counties and thus now occurs 
simultaneously with the entering of the judgment. "
1576,7, The Bank filed the appropriate notices of claim pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 893.80 before initiating suit. 
1577,8," The Note to § 3, 1991 Wis. Act 134, states in full: This amendment clarifies that the clerk of circuit court has discretion to defer the docketing of a judgment until the 
prescribed docketing fee is paid. The absence of an explicit fee requirement in s. 806.10(1)(intro.), stats., previously gave 
rise to questions about the clerk's authority to withhold docketing until payment of the fee. The amendment conforms the 
statute to the opinion of the attorney general in OAG 10-90 that clerks have the discretion to defer docketing until the fee is 
paid. The attorney general added, however, that the deferral discretion is limited by a duty to make a reasonable effort to 
make the fee-prepayment requirement known to the party submitting the judgment for docketing. "
1578,9," The clerk's brief and the Wisconsin Counties Association non-party brief argue that clerks of circuit court have discretion in 
performing their duties and that our interpretation of Wis. Stat. § 806.10(3) is inconsistent with this discretion. In Granado v. 
Sentry Ins. Co, 228 Wis. 2d 794, 599 N.W.2d 62 (Ct.App. 1999), the court of appeals recognized that ""as elected officials, clerks 
are entitled to exercise some discretion in the performance of their duties."" At the same time, the court of appeals acknowledged 
that the legislature can and does limit the clerks' discretion.  Granado, 228 Wis. 2d at 800-801. HN17[
] Wisconsin Stat. §"
1578,806, .10 expressly limits a clerk's discretion regarding the time for docketing judgments.
1578,10," ""Every clerk who shall neglect to docket any judgment as soon as practicable, shall forfeit to the party aggrieved two hundred 
and fifty dollars, in addition to all damages which such party may have sustained by such omission or neglect."" § 18, ch. 102,

1599,2," In his brief, Dr. Wagner calls the hospital and its employees ""unwitting"" co-conspirators, but there is no such thing as an 
unwitting co-conspirator, because all conspiracies require some degree of intent. What he must mean is ""unwilling,"" as were the 
co-conspirators in MCM. "
1600,3," I am far from certain that Dr. Wagner and Magellan can be deemed ""competitors,"" but the defendants do not challenge this or 
any of the substantive merits of the case, so Dr. Wagner's allegations are sufficient."
1600,4," The price issue is difficult to gauge in this type of case. One of the goals of Magellan to exclude Dr. Wagner may have been to 
control its costs by opting instead for physicians who tend not to admit patients. Efforts by firms to controls costs are generally 
permissible, however, particularly when there is no allegation of price impact. Magellan decided that the patient at the crux of 
this case was not covered anyway, so there was no cost increase to Magellan with the exception of the cost of the courier. Part "
1601,," of the goal of managed care organizations is to provide hospitals and doctors with ""incentives"" -- or prod them with sticks like 
nonpayment -- to control costs and thus maximize profits."
1601,5," Choice of physician should not be a factor given Dr. Wagner's definition of the relevant market as emergency psychiatric 
services available to Barrington-area patients in acute need. The issue is whether the services were available, not who provided 
them. "
1602,6," Dr. Wagner claims Magellan engaged in ""one or more schemes or artifices to interfere with and control or destroy plaintiff's 
emergency psychiatric practice,"" through extortion. He claims the pattern of racketeering activity is based on the predicate acts 
of mail fraud and wire fraud, but he fails to specify the nature of the mailings and wire communications -- and the 
misrepresentations contained therein -- and how they relate to the scheme to defraud. "
1607,1," Two other individuals were named as defendants and granted summary judgment, but Davric's appeal as to these defendants 
has been dismissed with prejudice."
1607,2," The lower court excluded from its consideration much of the evidence regarding Faucher's statements to Giuliano, on the 
ground that this evidence, which was presented via Giuliano's affidavit and deposition testimony, constituted hearsay. We think it 
is clear that a defendant's own alleged statements to Giuliano were admissible against that defendant; if made, they were classic 
admissions and are excepted from the hearsay rule. To simplify this appeal, we will assume arguendo that each defendant's 
statements were admissible against all of the defendants, though this is a much more debatable question."
1607,3," As discussed below, there is no evidence that any party ever attempted to implement a plan to secure foreclosure of 
Scarborough's mortgage."
1607,4," Giuliano's affidavit does not state that Faucher told him that his confederates actually intended to employ such a stranglehold. 
Rather, the affidavit attests only to the inference Giuliano drew from the conversation. "
1608,5," Davric was granted racing dates, but as a condition, the Commission imposed restrictions on Ricci's involvement with 
Scarborough's management."
1608,6," No evidence presented, however, links this ""boycott"" to any Scarborough competitor. "
1610,7," Courts have differed as to whether the Noerr-Pennington doctrine is a creature of the First Amendment, in which case it would 
apply of its own force to state antitrust claims, or whether it instead constitutes a mere interpretation of the Sherman Act, in 
which case it would not necessarily apply to state antitrust statutes that failed to mirror their federal counterparts. Compare 
Cheminor Drugs, Ltd. v. Ethyl Corp., 168 F.3d 119 (3d Cir. 1999) (firmly establishing Noerr-Pennington as an outgrowth of the 
First Amendment), and Kottle v. Northwest Kidney Ctrs., 146 F.3d 1056, 1059 (9th Cir. 1998) (same), with Cardtoons, L.C. v. 
Major League Baseball Players Assoc., 208 F.3d 885, 890 (10th Cir. 2000) (""Antitrust cases that grant Noerr-Pennington 
immunity do so based upon both the Sherman Act and the right to petition.""), and Coastal States Marketing, Inc. v. Hunt, 694 
F.2d 1358, 1364-65 (5th Cir. 1983) (""Noerr was based on a construction of the Sherman Act. It was not a first amendment 
decision.""). We need not address this controversy because ""Maine antitrust statutes parallel the Sherman Act"" and are analyzed 
pursuant to federal antitrust doctrine.  Tri-State Rubbish, Inc. v. Waste Management, Inc., 998 F.2d 1073, 1081 (1st Cir. 1993). 
Thus, regardless of whether the Noerr-Pennington protections are constitutional or statutory in nature, they will apply with equal 
force to Davric's claims under state and federal antitrust law."
1610,8," Davric's papers also allude to a separate suit in which Rancourt represented a creditor of Giuliano's. It is unclear how litigation 
against Giuliano, who is not a party to this case, could ground an antitrust claim set forth by Davric alone, but even if it could, this 
litigation is also protected by Noerr-Pennington. As Giuliano concedes, that suit resulted in a judgment against him. It thus does 
not matter whether, as Davric suggests, Rancourt pursued the matter more vigorously than he otherwise might have due to 
animosity toward Giuliano.  Cf.  City of Columbia, 499 U.S. at 380 (labeling a party's motives in pursuing petition ""irrelevant""). 
The successful litigation did not lack an objective basis, and therefore was not a sham under Noerr-Pennington. See, e.g., 
Professional Real Estate Investors, 508 U.S. at 60 (""Only if a challenged litigation is objectively meritless may a court examine 
the litigant's subjective motivation.""). "
1611,9," Despite the use of the word ""crime,"" the Maine statute explicitly permits ""any person"" to seek redress for a violation. See Me. 
Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 10, § 1104. "
1623,1," The court's analysis under Heck applies only to the claims asserted by Mike Salts. Marie Salts was not prosecuted or convicted 
of any crime. Therefore, her Fourth Amendment claims will be addressed separately. "
1625,2," As previously noted, consideration of a Rule 12(c) motion normally focuses solely on the allegations in the complaint, however, 
introduction of matters of public record are permissible. See 5 Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and 
Procedure, §§ 1357 n.41, 1364 n.24-43 (2d ed. 1987). Thus, the court may properly review Salts' indictment."
1625,3," Defendant Barnes contends that he was not present during the search of Salts Funeral Home. Plaintiffs' Second Amended 
Complaint, however, alleges that Barnes did participate in the search. The court will take Plaintiffs' allegations as true and 
simultaneously consider the Defendants' eligibility for qualified immunity. "
1626,4," Had the court not previously determined Mike Salts' Fourth Amendment claims to be barred by Heck, the above analysis would 
apply with equal force to preclude his claims. "
1627,5," As noted above, at all times relevant to the case at bar, the Defendants held the following positions: Travis Childers, Chancery 
Clerk for Prentiss County, Mississippi; Jimmy Moore, Board Supervisor for Prentiss County, Mississippi; Joe Wayne Garner, 
Board Supervisor for Prentiss County, Mississippi; Roy Green, Board Supervisor for Prentiss County, Mississippi; William L. 
McKinney, Board Supervisor for Prentiss County, Mississippi; Jerry Barnes, Police Chief for the City of Booneville, Mississippi; 
Keith Lovell, Assistant Police Chief for the City of Booneville, Mississippi; and Tim Henderson, Assistant Police Chief for the City 
of Booneville, Mississippi."
1627,6," Defendants correctly note that although both Plaintiffs assert claims for selective prosecution, Marie Salts was not prosecuted 
for any crime. Thus, she has no standing to bring a claim for selective prosecution and any such claim asserted by her shall be 
dismissed. "
1628,7," In Jennings, the court emphasized: HN22[
] As a substantive matter, the constitutional authority to ""take care that the laws [are] faithfully executed"" is 
textually committed to the authority of the executive branch, and the authority of the executive branch to enforce the law in 
a selective fashion is legally unchallengeable absent proof by the defendant that the government has exercised its 
discretion upon an invidious basis such as race."
1628,724, F.2d at 445 n.12 (internal citations omitted). 
1629,8," Plaintiffs' conspiracy theory focuses on alleged meetings between Defendants Philip R. Duncan and George Dale, and other 
meetings conducted by Defendants Rober Cribb, J.D. Gardner, Tony Lee Shelbourne, and Rick Ward at the office of Defendant 
Travis Childers. Plaintiffs offer no basis to support their theory that any of the other movants engaged in a conspiracy. "
1644,1," At his insistence, Whitacre was tried in absentia from the prison where he is serving a 108-month sentence for embezzlement. 
He was represented vigorously by counsel at trial and aided his defense through telephone communication with his lawyer. "
1645,," Kazutoshi Yamada, an employee of Ajinomoto Co. of Japan, was the fourth defendant named in the indictment. He has not been 
tried and remains a fugitive. "
1649,2, Randall was not indicted. 
1650,3," Until 1990, Cox worked for a company that produced citric acid. In 1990, ADM bought the citric-acid operation, and Cox joined 
ADM at that time. "
1655,4," Kastigar v. United States, 406 U.S. 441, 32 L. Ed. 2d 212, 92 S. Ct. 1653 (1972), and its progeny, including United States v. 
Palumbo, 897 F.2d 245 (7th Cir. 1990), deal with the use of evidence against defendants obtained from those defendants 
pursuant to an immunity agreement. Here, the defendants who seek to benefit from the immunity agreement have not testified 
nor have they ever entered into any agreement. They cannot claim to have been induced into testifying against themselves and 
can point to no violation of the Fifth Amendment, as in Kastigar and Palumbo."
1655,5," Federal courts look to general principles of contract law to interpret a plea or immunity agreement. See United States v. Given, 
164 F.3d 389, 395-96 (7th Cir. 1999). The parties focus on Illinois law, which fairly typifies the general law of contracts and is 
persuasive in this instance. "
1656,6," The analysis and resolution of this issue overlaps with the question of whether, assuming standing, the terms of the agreement 
actually immunized Andreas and Wilson. We also would answer that question in the negative. "
1662,7," The government's argument that the prefatory ""I think that you're going to see"" saves an otherwise impermissible statement is 
unavailing. This court has allowed a prosecutor to begin with phrases such as ""I believe that you will find"" because it only 
suggests what the government thinks the evidence adduced at trial means. See United States v. Whitaker, 127 F.3d 595, 606-07 
(7th Cir. 1997). ""I believe"" and ""I think"" are but patterns of speech that can be innocuous. Such phrases, however, do not 
automatically immunize any statement that follows. "
1664,8, Lassar misspoke in closing and used the wrong date. 
1665,9," Similarly, in misstating the two-part test for a Fifth Amendment violation as a conjunctive rather than disjunctive, the district 
court again overprotected the defendants' rights, which by definition cannot prejudice the defendant. "
1668,10," We acknowledge this example as one of the rare instances when a price fixer would forgo anticompetitive profits, but it also 
illustrates how rare the occasion when a price fixer able to charge higher prices would act in an economically irrational way and 
sell below the inflated market price. "
1674,1," It was unclear whether the district court's July 17, 1998 Memorandum Decision disposed of all of the claims against all of the 
defendants, or just the claims against the individual defendants. On June 12, 2000, the district court filed a Supplemental Order 
clarifying that its Memorandum Decision was and is a final judgment dismissing all of the plaintiffs' claims against all of the 
defendants. The district court also filed a Judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58."
1674,2," The majority of the facts in this case are undisputed and are adopted from the district court's thorough opinion. See Diaz v. 
Farley, 15 F. Supp. 2d 1138 (D. Utah 1998). To the extent that any facts are disputed, we have viewed them in the light most 
favorable to the plaintiffs, because this appeal stems from the grant of a motion for summary judgment in favor of the 
defendants. See Kaul v. Stephan, 83 F.3d 1208, 1212 (10th Cir. 1996). "
1675,3," There is some uncertainty in the record whether Dr. Diehl left the labor and delivery anesthesia practice in 1985 or 1989. We 
use the 1989 date because that appears consistent with his deposition testimony, but if that fact is in dispute, it is not 
determinative of our holding. "
1676,4," This still allowed Doctor Kaminsky to provide anesthesiology services to ob/gyn patients admitted to Cottonwood Hospital who 
were not from Cottonwood Ob/Gyn. "
1677,5," 15 U.S.C. § 1 provides in relevant part: ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint 
of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal."""
1677,6," 28 U.S.C. § 1337 provides in relevant part: (a) The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action or proceeding arising under any Act of Congress 
regulating commerce or protecting trade and commerce against restraints and monopolies."
1677,7," 15 U.S.C. § 15 provides in relevant part: Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section [regarding foreign states], any person who shall be injured in his 
business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor in any district court of the United 
States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, without respect to the amount in 
controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable 
attorney's fee. "
1678,8," Plaintiffs point specifically to the district court's failure to mention an agreement between Drs. Farley and Matthews that Dr. 
Farley would make the labor and delivery schedule in accordance with Dr. Matthews' decisions. In acting in accordance with Dr. 
Matthews' decisions when developing the schedule, Dr. Farley was simply abiding by the agreement between Dr. Matthews and 
Cottonwood Ob/Gyn and carrying out his duties as the scheduler. Thus, the district court did not ""ignore"" the agreement between 
Dr. Matthews and Dr. Farley; rather, it likely considered Dr. Farley's actions as an element of the overall agreement between Dr. 
Matthews and Cottonwood Ob/Gyn. "
1680,9," This case is easily distinguishable from Full Draw Productions v. Easton Sports, Inc., 182 F.3d 745 (10th Cir. 1999), where this 
court reversed the district court's dismissal of an antitrust claim for failure to allege antitrust injury adequately. In Full Draw, the 
plaintiffs alleged that the defendants' group boycott cut off their access to suppliers and exhibitors of archery goods and 
services, which was an essential element for the plaintiff to be able to compete in the market of sponsoring trade shows for 
archery products. See Full Draw, 182 F.3d at 751. We found the plaintiffs' allegations sufficient to state a violation of § 1 of the 
Sherman Act. See id. "
1681,10," The reference is to Weiss v. York Hospital, 745 F.2d 786, 818-20 (3rd Cir. 1984), a case in which the Third Circuit analyzed a 
situation it found analogous to a traditional boycott under the per se rule. Because Weiss involved facts different from those 
present here, and because the statements in Weiss regarding analysis of group boycotts were superseded by the Supreme 
Court's ruling in Northwest Wholesale, we do not find Weiss instructive in our analysis in this case. "
1687,1, Drug Emporium is a Delaware corporation which owns more than 140 drugstores in the United States. 
1688,2," Plaintiff concedes in its complaint that it is unsure whether all of Blue Cross's insureds have pharmacy coverage, and thus are 
subject to the network."
1688,3," Plaintiff's complaint also states two causes of action against Tops for breach of contract and breach of warranty. Those claims, 
however, are not subject to the present motion to dismiss."
1688,4," State antitrust claims brought under the Donnelly Act, N.Y.Gen.Bus.Law § 340 (McKinney 1968 & Supp.1987), track the 
analysis of their companion federal antitrust claims brought under the Sherman Act. Empire Volkswagen Inc. v. World-Wide "
1689,," Volkswagen Corp., 814 F.2d 90, 98 n.4 (2d Cir. 1987); see also Kramer v. Pollock-Krasner Found., 890 F. Supp. 250, 254 
(S.D.N.Y. 1995) (the Donnelly Act is modeled on the Sherman Act and is construed in light of federal precedent). "
1693,5," In its memorandum of law opposing the motions to dismiss, plaintiff re-characterizes its tort claim against Tops and Rite Aid as 
""interference with Plaintiff's contractual relationship with defendant Blue Cross."" Item 36 at p. 17. Defendants contend that such 
a characterization is improper under NBT Bancorp Inc., v. Fleet Norstar Financial Group, Inc., 87 N.Y.2d 614, 621, 641 N.Y.S.2d 
581, 664 N.E.2d 492 (1996); and Guard-Life Corp., v. S. Parker Hardware Mfg. Corp, 50 N.Y.2d 183, 193, 406 N.E.2d 445, 428 
N.Y.S.2d 628 (1980), which held that tortious interference claims involving a terminable at-will contract can only be characterized 
as tortious interference with prospective contract rights or business relations. It is unnecessary for the court, however, to explore 
defendants' argument, as plaintiff and defendants agree that regardless of what the tort claim against Tops and Rite Aid is titled, 
plaintiff must satisfy the standard set forth by the Second Circuit in Purgess v. Shadrock, supra, and its progenies, Nadel, supra, 
and Goldhirsh Group, Inc., v. Alpert, 107 F.3d 105, 108-09 (2d Cir. 1997), all of which require a showing of interference that is 
dishonest, wrongful, improper, or unfair. "
1697,1," Enova owns San Diego Gas & Electric Co. (""SDG&E""), an electrical utility serving the San Diego area. (Competitive Impact 
Stmnt. at 3.) SDG&E and two other regulated, investor-owned utilities dominate California's electricity market. (Id. at 4.) "
1698,2," Peak electricity demand in California is usually during the summer due to the increased use of air-conditioning and other 
electric-powered appliances. (Competitive Impact Stmnt. at P 5.)"
1698,3," Since 1998, over 80% of electricity generated in California is bought and sold through the California Power Exchange Pool 
(""the Pool""). (Compl. at PP 10, 12.) The Pool is a computerized central bidding system which automatically matches electricity 
supply and demand every half-hour over the course of the day. (Id. at P 10.) Electricity sellers and buyers send in their bids to 
buy and sell electricity every half-hour. (Id. at P 11.) The Pool then acts as a market-maker, matching buyers and sellers until all 
demand is met and establishing a market clearing price that is equal to the price of the most expensive unit sold during that half-
hour. (Id.) During periods of high demand, gas-fired plants traditionally supply the most expensive units of electricity sold and 
therefore set the overall price of electricity. (Id. at P 21.)"
1698,4," Elasticity of demand refers to the tendency of consumers to substitute away from a product when its price increases. Demand 
for electricity in California is highly inelastic because consumers do not switch to other energy sources when the price of 
electricity increases. (Competitive Impact Stmnt. at 6.) Moreover, there are only two major interstate electricity transmission lines 
running into California. (Id.) When these lines reach their capacity during peak hours, generation from within the state must meet 
the excess demand. (Id.)"
1698,5," Ninety-six percent of gas-fired generators in southern California buy gas transportation and storage service from Pacific. 
(Competitive Impact Stmnt. at 5.)"
1698,6," Though the parties did not fully address this point in their pleadings to this Court, Pacific apparently lacked the pre-merger 
incentive to raise its prices because, despite its monopoly over gas transportation and distribution facilities in southern California, 
Pacific did have competitors to whom its customers could turn in the event of a price increase. In proceedings before the 
California Public Utilities Commission, Enova and Pacific maintained that SoCalGas faced competition from ""alternative pipelines 
and storage facilities delivering interstate or surplus local California production of natural gas, alternate fuels, municipalization of 
SoCalGas's distribution facilities, and 'bypass by wire' (competition to local gas generation by out-of-state electricity 
generators)."" Re Pacific Enters., 1998 Cal. PUC LEXIS 1, *91, 184 P.U.R.4th 417, 449 (1998). Thus, if Pacific increased its 
prices, it presumably risked not only raising the eyebrows of California's utility regulators, but also losing money that would not 
have been offset by increased revenues from another sector of its business. "
1699,7," According to the Justice Department, California's regulatory scheme, particularly its rigorous pipeline certification process and 
restrictions on access to intrastate gas transportation markets, creates a virtually insurmountable barrier to would-be newcomers 
in California's natural gas transportation market. (Compl. at P 26.) Likewise, entry into California's electrical generation market is 
governed by a thicket of environmental, safety, zoning, and other regulations. (Id. at P 27.)"
1699,8," At the time the competitive impact statement was filed, Enova controlled over 2,600 megawatts of electricity. (Competitive 
Impact Stmnt. at 7.) The proposed final judgment requires divestiture of these two plants which have an aggregate capacity of 
1,644 megawatts. (Id. at 9.) These two generators run nearly year-round at low-cost and could thus earn significant profits if the 
electricity prices rise as a result of a constricted supply of natural gas. (Id.)"
1699,9," The approvals required under the proposed decree do not obviate the need for any prospective buyer of those assets to obtain 
the necessary regulatory approvals from the California Public Utilities Commission, or any other relevant governmental 
authorities. (Proposed Final J. at § IV(B).)"
1699,10," The proposed decree subjects the following transactions to prior approval by the United States: (1) outright acquisition of 
existing ""California Generation Facilities"" (which are defined as electricity generation facilities in existence on January 1, 1998) 
with over a 500 megawatt aggregate capacity (Proposed Final J. at §§ II, V(A)(1), V(B)); (2) any contract that allows PE/Enova to 
control such assets over the 500 megawatt cap (id. at §§ V(A)(2), V(B)); (3) any contract for the operation and sale of output 
from California Generating Facilities over the 500 megawatt cap owned by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power 
(""LADPW""), which is California's second largest electricity generator (id. at §§ II(B), V(A)-(B)); and (4) future ""tolling agreements"" 
which would permit PE/Enova to ""control"" electric generating plants (i.e. set the facility's level of electrical output) by renting 
them as opposed to purchasing them outright. (Id. at §§ II(A), II(E), V(C)(3))."
1699,11," Such contracts, if permitted, would allow Enova to operate other companies' plants in return for a potentially large percentage 
of the profits generated by those plants. (Competitive Impact Stmnt. at 15.) Thus, if PE/Enova were permitted to enter into power 
management contracts, its incentive to increase electricity prices would essentially be no different than if PE/Enova owned the 
plant itself. (Id.) "
1700,12," SCE did not withdraw its objections to the entry of final judgment until March 26, 1999. "
1702,13," The complaint defines the relevant market as ""the provision of electricity in California during high demand periods"" and not the 
market for natural gas transportation and storage. (Compl. at P 19.)"
1702,14," The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission found that the proposed merger created the dangers cited by the government in 
this case, and also concluded that Enova's divestment of its gas-fired plants would alleviate the vertical market power problems 
raised. See Southern Cal. Edison Co. v. San Diego Gas & Elec. Co., 79 Federal Energy Reg. Comm'n Rep. (CCH) P 61,372, at 
62,565 n.58 (June 25, 1997). The California Public Utilities Commission, which is required to authorize any such divestiture, 
subsequently imposed remedies consistent with the consent decree requiring, among other things, that Enova sell its gas-fired 
plants by a date certain. See Re Pacific Enters., 184 P.U.R.4th at 498. "
1719,1," The First Claim sought damages for a violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1, and the Second Claim sought 
an injunction for a violation of that statute. The Third Claim sought damages for a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981, and the Fourth 
Claim sought damages for a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3). The Fifth Claim sought an injunction for a violation of 42 U.S.C. §§ 
1981 and 1985(3). The Sixth Claim sought damages for a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1986."
1719,2," The defendants in the original Complaint included all of the defendants in the Amended Complaint, with the exception of Cellar 
Door Entertainment, Inc., and also included Artist Direct LLC, Artists & Audience Entertainment Corporation, Premier Talent 
Agency Inc., 462 Inc., Jam Productions Ltd., Inc. (in addition to Jam Productions Ltd.), United Concerts, Inc., and Universal 
Concerts, Inc."
1719,3," Those defendants were Artist Direct LLC, Monterey, Premier Talent Agency, Inc., Beaver, Belkin, Jam Productions, Evening 
Star, and Electric Factory. "
1722,4," Though an overt act is not alleged against each Cellar Door defendant individually, the Amended Complaint contains one 
nonspecific reference to ""one of the Cellar Door entities,"" and two references to specific Cellar Door defendants. (Am. Compl. 
PP 87(d), (f), (j).) "
1723,5, The remaining 35 concerts involved Hispanic artists. (Am. Compl. P 69.) 
1724,6," Such action would tend to maintain or improve the booking agency defendants' position in competition for artists' representation 
with non-defendant booking agencies."
1724,7," Presumably, if artists received a higher percentage of net concert revenues (and promoters a lower percentage) from one 
booking agency, artists would use that booking agency."
1724,8," The Amended Complaint does not allege specific overt acts by Monterey, Renaissance, or Variety Artists. HN9[
] However, 
an ""overt act need not be pleaded against each defendant."" State of New York v. Cedar Park Concrete Corp., 665 F. Supp. 238, 
247 (S.D.N.Y. 1987) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Amended Complaint does allege that Monterey booked 
approximately 247, or 10%, of the concerts listed in Exhibit A to the Amended Complaint, and Renaissance booked 
approximately 93, or 4%, of those concerts. (Am. Compl. P 71.) In addition, plaintiffs state in the Amended Complaint that, 
though ""Plaintiff Bernard Bailey is known to Monterey and has often sought promotion business from its agent Dan Weiner,"" and 
""Plaintiff Fred Jones has also communicated with Monterey concerning promotions[,] Monterey has never solicited or permitted 
Bailey, Jones or any other black promoter to promote a concert of contemporary music by a white act."" (Am. Compl. P 21.) The 
Amended Complaint also alleges that, ""although Renaissance, through [two] officers, has known the plaintiffs since its inception, 
it has never solicited or permitted any plaintiff or other black promoter to promote, or even bid to promote, any concert of 
contemporary music by a white act."" (Am. Compl. P 24.) Finally, the Amended Complaint states that ""Variety Artists has known 
Bernard Bailey for several years and has contracted with him to promote minor artists."" (Am. Compl. P 25.) However, according 
to the Amended Complaint, ""Variety Artists has never solicited or permitted any plaintiff or any other black promoter to promote, 
or even bid to promote, any concert of contemporary music by a white artist."" (Am. Compl. P 25.) Thus, plaintiffs allege in general terms that these three booking agents excluded plaintiffs from bidding on promotion of concerts 
by white artists. As discussed above, this exclusion would be against the economic interests of the booking agents unless done 
in concert with specific concert promoters and other booking agencies. In addition, plaintiffs allege that booking agency 
defendants Monterey and Renaissance control a relatively significant portion of the concert market. These allegations are 
sufficient to support plaintiffs' claims of participation in the antitrust conspiracy by these three booking agency defendants. 
Therefore, drawing all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs' favor, it is appropriate to deny the motion to dismiss as to these three 
defendants, despite the fact that no overt act has been alleged against them. "
1725,9, It should also be noted that Delsener called the agent at William Morris at plaintiff Boseman's request. (Am. Compl. P 87(c).)
1725,10," Though this allegation is not evidence of Concert/Southern's participation in an antitrust conspiracy, it may be indicative of 
some other improper agreement."
1725,11," Though it appears, based on the allegation that CAA and William Morris agreed to let plaintiffs co-promote the Toni Braxton 
concerts, that Beaver and Electric Factory were acting against the wishes of those booking agency defendants in refusing to co-
promote with plaintiffs, it is possible that CAA and William Morris made the agreement with plaintiffs in bad faith and then acted 
in concert with Beaver and Electric Factory to prevent the agreement from being fulfilled or that Beaver and Electric Factory had 
already received non-exclusive contracts to promote and stood on their contractual rights. "
1727,12, That plaintiffs are members of a racial minority is not disputed.
1727,13," Paragraph 88 of the Amended Complaint states: In order to attempt to end the booking agency defendants' practice of consistently refusing to contract or retain plaintiffs to 
promote concerts to be given by white acts and major black acts, plaintiffs have asked and demanded that the booking 
agency defendants, promoter defendants, and co-conspirators end their boycott and discrimination of black promoters and 
allow them equal opportunity of promoting such concerts and participating in the bidding and contracting process. Such 
requests have been made by plaintiffs, over many years, and on many occasions, individually, together, and through the 
[Black Promoters Association of America, Inc.], both formally and informally, through letters, facsimiles, face-to-face 
meetings and telephone calls, to several of the booking agency defendants and the promoter defendants. The defendants 
and co-conspirators have refused to end the boycott of black promoters, and have failed to respond to plaintiffs' requests. 
On occasion, certain booking agency defendants have dismissed plaintiffs' demands by falsely representing their intention 
to offer certain concert promotion contracts to plaintiffs, knowing that they would never do so. On some occasions, certain "
1728,," defendants have even ridiculed plaintiffs' demands, laughing in plaintiffs' faces at the very suggestion of contracting with 
black promoters to promote concerts to be performed by white and major black acts. (Am. Compl. P 88.)"
1728,14," Paragraph 89 states: At public meetings held during, and as part of, national conventions of persons involved in the music industry, plaintiffs 
have publicly raised the issues addressed in this complaint. At such meetings, plaintiffs asked the persons assembled to 
discuss and take steps to end the boycott and discriminatory conduct against black concert promoters described herein. 
The persons attending the meetings refused to even discuss the issues raised. (Am. Compl. P 89.)"
1728,15," The QBQ defendants argue that, to survive a motion to dismiss, plaintiffs' Amended Complaint ""'must allege specific facts 
supporting both the existence of racial animus and the inference of a link between the adverse treatment and the racial animus.'"" 
(QBQ Defs.' Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss at 6 (quoting X-Men Security, Inc. v. Pataki, 983 F. Supp. 101, 108 (E.D.N.Y. 
1997).) Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint satisfies this requirement: it alleges that the number of concerts promoted by black 
concert promoters is disproportionately small, and it alleges that the defendants, booking agencies and concert promoters 
controlled by white people, have tried to hinder plaintiffs' promotion of concerts. "
1729,16," Of the booking agency defendants, only Monterey and QBQ move to dismiss the Third Claim of the Amended Complaint. 
However, all booking agency defendants move to dismiss the Fifth Claim, for an injunction under § 1981 and § 1985(3). With 
respect to the injunction under § 1981, the motion to dismiss is denied as to all of the booking agency defendants. However, as 
to Fantasma, the only concert promoter defendant who did not move to dismiss the Third Claim but did move to dismiss the Fifth 
Claim, the claim for an injunction under § 1981 is dismissed but the claim for damages under § 1981 is not dismissed. "
1730,17," Section 1985(3) goes on to state that a plaintiff may be entitled to recover if one or more of the conspirators ""do, or cause to 
be done, any act in furtherance of the object of such conspiracy, whereby another is injured in his person or property, or 
deprived of having any right or privilege of a citizen of the United States."" 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3)."
1730,18, Whether plaintiffs can make out a claim for an alleged loss of business opportunities is not within the scope of this Opinion.
1730,19," In his concurrence in Novotny, Justice Powell observed, ""I would hold that. . . [§ 1985(3)'s] reach is limited to conspiracies to 
violate those fundamental rights derived from the Constitution."" Novotny, 442 U.S. 366, 379, 99 S. Ct. 2345, 60 L. Ed. 2d 957 
(1979) (Powell, J., concurring). Justice Stevens espoused a similar view in his concurrence: ""I do not believe [§ 1985(3)] was "
1731,," intended to provide a remedy for the violation of statutory rights -- let alone rights created by statutes that had not yet been 
enacted."" 442 U.S. at 385 (Stevens, J., concurring). However, these statements by Justices Powell and Stevens do not constitute a holding of the Supreme Court. All the district 
courts in this Circuit that have held that a § 1981 claim cannot be the basis of a § 1985(3) claim have looked at the issue in the 
context of employment discrimination and, therefore, are governed by the policy for Title VII claims enunciated by the majority in 
Novotny. See Jenkins v. Arcade Building Maintenance, 44 F. Supp. 2d 524, 533 (S.D.N.Y. 1999); Harris v. Niagara Mohawk 
Power Corp., 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22009, 1998 WL 865566, at 6 (N.D.N.Y. Dec. 7, 1998) (holding that ""Section 1985 does not 
confer a separate right of action for injuries redressed by Title VII or 42 U.S.C. § 1981""); Smith v. Local Union 28 Sheet Metal 
Workers, 877 F. Supp. 165, 172 n.12 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (dismissing plaintiff's § 1985(3) claim because ""a private sector employee 
[can] not state a claim alleging a conspiracy to deprive him of equal protection of the laws based solely upon claims of 
employment discrimination""); Ladson v. Ulltra East Parking Mgmt. Corp., 853 F. Supp. 699, 704 n.6 (S.D.N.Y. 1994). Moreover, 
the majority of courts from other districts have permitted § 1985(3) claims based on violations of § 1981. See, e.g., Davis v. 
General Accident Insurance Co. of America, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1406, 1999 WL 130350 at 3 (E.D. Pa. Feb 11, 1999);

BPA's transmission access and pricing policies: (1) if BPA files an open access tariff for review and confirmation under the 
Northwest Power Act and asks FERC to find that the tariff meets FERC's open access policies; (2) to the extent that BPA ""is a 
transmitting utility subject to a request for mandatory transmission services"" under FPA § 211; and (3) to the extent that BPA 
receives open access transmission from a public utility and is thereby subject to the reciprocity provision in that public utility's 
pro-forma tariff. Id."
1757,4," The Commission and various intervenors on its behalf argue extensively against our jurisdiction over these issues on the 
grounds that the petitioners failed, in various ways, adequately to raise their concerns before the agency and to preserve the 
issues for judicial review. Upon careful review of the record, we can safely conclude without further elaboration that these 
jurisdictional arguments are without merit, that the Commission has had ample notice and opportunity to address all of the 
petitioners' various statutory, constitutional, and other challenges to Order 888's open access requirement, and that we have 
jurisdiction to consider these issues. "

1765,6," The Commission's seven factor test involves evaluating on a case-by-case basis whether the activities of the facilities in 
question correspond with seven specific indicators of local distribution: (1) Local distribution facilities are normally in close proximity to retail customers. (2) Local distribution facilities are primarily radial in character. (3) Power flows into local distribution systems; it rarely, if ever, flows out. (4) When power enters a local distribution system, it is not reconsigned or transported on to some other market. (5) Power entering a local distribution system is consumed in a comparatively restricted geographical area. (6) Meters are based at the transmission/local distribution interface to measure flows into the local distribution system. (7) Local distribution systems will be of reduced voltage.

] Section 2 provides in its entirety that: Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to 
monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of 
a felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding $ 10,000,000 if a corporation, or, if any other 
person, $ 350,000, or by imprisonment not exceeding three years, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the 
court. Id."
1833,2," We use the terms ""predatory"" and ""exclusionary"" interchangeably to refer to conduct which can support an attempted 
monopolization claim under § 2 of the Sherman Act. Taylor attempts to use its evidence of intent to bolster its proof of predatory conduct. In certain circumstances, a showing of 
intent may be relevant to establishing predatory conduct. See 3A Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, ANTITRUST LAW § 
805c, at 326 (1996) (""Intent retains its customary role as an aid in characterizing ambiguous conduct.""); id. § 806e, at 337 
(discussing the relationship between market power and conduct). While we have endorsed this approach in the past, see, e.g., "
1834,," Lehrman v. Gulf Oil Corp., 464 F.2d 26, 38 n.9 (5th Cir. 1972) (""In short, when a firm displays an anti-competitive animus in the 
operation of an otherwise ambiguous business practice, what the firm seeks to accomplish provides as sure an indicator of the 
actual effect of the practice on competition as can be found in the shifting sands of antitrust litigation. ""), we have required some 
link between the intent and the conduct. That is, to be relevant to conduct, the intent must explain the specific conduct. Taylor's intent evidence does not sufficiently explain Jostens's conduct, for example, by explaining why Jostens engaged in 
below-cost pricing. Cf., e.g., id. (discussing the defendant's ""motivation in denying price support to Lehrman""); 3A Areeda & 
Hovenkamp § 805c, at 325 (giving an example of how the defendant's purpose for engaging in specific conduct might make 
conduct that otherwise seems predatory be non-predatory). Instead, it merely identifies a general intent by Jostens to become 
the dominant market participant. In addition to determining that none of Jostens's conduct was predatory, the district court ruled on the other elements of Taylor's 
Sherman Act claim: intent and dangerous probability of success. On appeal, the parties dispute the district court's dangerous 
probability finding, but in light of our disposition here, we do not reach this issue."
1834,3," Taylor argued below that Jostens engaged in predatory disparagement of Taylor's services. Taylor does not renew this 
argument on appeal, and thus we do not consider it."
1834,4," Taylor expert Bryan Jones testified that Jostens ""upgraded"" 80% of the customers it attracted from Taylor. Significantly, 
however, he testified that only 25% of these customers ended up paying more on their Jostens contract than they paid the 
previous year on their Taylor contract. "
1835,5," Additionally, Jostens could never obtain a monopoly through this conduct. See 3A Areeda & Hovenkamp § 806a, at 327 
(""Regardless of the defendant's power or intent, its conduct may be incapable of producing monopoly, and thus unable to satisfy 
the attempt requirement.""). Customers actually upset about the ultimate prices and services they obtained could switch back to 
another manufacturer. "
1836,6," HN17[
] We have endorsed average variable cost as an appropriate measure of below-cost pricing for purposes of 
determining predatory pricing. See id. at 532. ""Average variable cost is the costs that vary with changes in output divided by the 
output."" International Air Industries, Inc. v. American Excelsior Co., 517 F.2d 714, 724 n.27(5th Cir. 1975). Variable costs are 
costs that ""vary with the amount produced,"" and include ""inputs like hourly labor, the cost of materials, transport, and electrical 
consumption at a plant."" Stearns Airport, 170 F.3d at 532. Since Jostens has not challenged Taylor's estimation of its AVC on 
appeal, we accept Taylor's estimates as correct."
1836,7," Jones testified that Taylor had 7,337 customers in 1994, 6,977 in 1995, 6,832 in 1996, and 6,576 in 1997. He stated that Taylor 
lost the following numbers of customers to Jostens's below-cost pricing: twenty-seven in 1995, twenty-six in 1996, and thirteen in 
1997."
1836,8," This same shortcoming applies in even greater measure to Taylor's challenge to a Jostens promotional contest. In return for 
potential customers agreeing to a sales meeting with a Jostens representative, the customers were entered in a drawing to be 
one of four schools nationwide (one in each of four geographic regions) to receive a year's worth of free yearbooks from Jostens. 
This very limited promotion presented no risk of driving Taylor from the market and thereby allowing Jostens to recoup the 
allegedly predatory discounts. See Buffalo Courier-Express, 601 F.2d at 55 (finding that a five-week promotion where one 
newspaper gave its new Sunday edition to subscribers for free was not predatory because the plaintiff newspaper ""introduced no 
proof that sampling for [this period] was unusual"" or ""that the five week sampling would produce even a short-term loss for the 
[plaintiff's] operation taken as a whole"")."
1836,9," William Avera, a Taylor expert, testified that Jostens's below-cost pricing harmed Taylor beyond simply depriving it of some 
customers. Avera stated that Taylor was also harmed when it was forced to match Jostens's prices to retain some of its other 
customers. Taylor's ability to retain customers in this manner shows that Jostens could not recoup its below-cost prices by "
1837,," ""driving [Taylor] from the market, or . . . causing [it] to raise [its] prices to supracompetitive levels within a disciplined oligarchy."" 
Brooke Group, 509 U.S. at 225, 113 S. Ct. 2578."
1837,10," For example, notes from an interview between a Jostens executive and former Taylor employee Cole Harris reflect an 
occasion where Jostens asked Harris to describe 42 Taylor sales representatives to Jostens, their respective accounts, and their 
effectiveness. In those notes, which Jostens used to choose which Taylor sales representatives to pursue, Jostens noted that 
Dan DeFalco was the ""lynchpin"" of the organization, that school principals ""love him and are addicted to him,"" and that it ""would 
be a coup to get him."""
1837,11," As an example of when the hiring away of a competitor's employees would become predatory, Areeda and Hovenkamp 
describe a dominant computer software firm who hires away all of its rivals' best programmers and, because it has enough of its 
own programmers, employs them as custodians paid the salaries of computer programmers rather than custodians. See 3 
Areeda & Hovenkamp P 702c, at 143. The case at bar is not analogous; rather, it would be equivalent to the dominant computer 
software firm hiring its rivals' best programmers and promoting them to supervisory roles in which they would use their skills to 
the company's benefit. "
1838,12," For example, Jostens sought to hire Taylor employee Thurlow Cooper, have him ""convert"" his accounts to Jostens without 
direct participation to avoid violating his non-compete agreement with Taylor, and then take the accounts over once the term of 
that agreement ended. Jostens stated that: If we converted all of [Cooper's] business (I believe we would because Jeff Graffam will just roll over like he did for Cole), 
and split 50/50, that would be $ 25,000 toward the $ 40,000 [we would have to pay Cooper to compensate him for his lost 
commissions for leaving Taylor].. . . After two years [once his non-compete agreement had ended] Mr. Cooper would get 
the business back at full commission . . .. This scenario, to me at least, would seem to be in the best interest of everyone 
involved with the exception of [Taylor]."
1838,13," This evidence includes: (1) the memorandum stating that Dan DeFalco coming over to Jostens ""would bring over his $ 1.4 
million, beginning with next Fall's deliveries,"" despite his non-compete agreement; (2) the fact that the DeFalcos' conduct after 
moving to Jostens allowed Taylor to obtain a preliminary injunction from a federal judge in the Eastern District of Virginia "
1839,," preventing further violations of their non-compete agreements; and (3) the memorandum describing in detail how Jostens would 
get around Taylor employee Thurlow Cooper's non-compete agreement."
1839,14, Thornton admitted as much during his testimony at trial. 
1843,15," Taylor's inability to show the necessary tort or criminal act underpinning its unfair competition claim is illustrated by its 
misreliance on cases involving misappropriation of trade names. In these cases, the defendant falsely sells goods under the 
plaintiff's trade name, thereby deceiving customers. See, e.g., Hudgens v. Goen, 673 S.W.2d 420, 423 (Tex. App.--Fort Worth 
1984, writ ref'd n.r.e.). The harm complained of is the misuse of the plaintiff's name--the trade name is recognized as a form of 
intangible property created by the development of goodwill in the name. See Thompson v. Thompson Air Conditioning and 
Heating, Inc., 884 S.W.2d 555, 558 (Tex. App.--Texarkana 1994). This harm bears no analogy to Taylor's alleged harm, as 
Taylor has shown no property interest it had which Jostens deceptively used; instead, any harm suffered was experienced by 
Taylor's former customers. "
1857,1," Praefke bought at a 56.5% discount from retail, and sold to its RSDs at a 40% discount from retail. This is equivalent to a cost 
of 43.5% of retail and a sale price of 60% of retail, a 37.9% markup from cost."
1857,2, Tecumseh denies ever exercising this veto power. (Def.'s App. Melius Decl. P 8.)
1857,3," The Tecumseh-Industrial contract required Tecumseh to give Industrial 30 days' notice that it was terminating Industrial. 
However, possibly in violation of the WFDL's notice provisions, none of the contracts involved provided for either Tecumseh or 
Industrial to give affected ASDs any notice that they were about to be automatically terminated by virtue of Tecumseh's 
terminating Industrial. "
1858,4," Tecumseh raises various evidentiary objections to copies that Praefke has provided in this litigation of three-party contracts 
between Tecumseh, Wisconsin Magneto, Inc. as CWD, and a different ASD, Marshfield Auto Electric Service, Inc., dating from 
the 1960s and 1970s. (Pl.'s Ex. 5.) Nonetheless, Praefke may rely upon the affidavit of its president, Loyd Schmidt, who testified 
from his personal knowledge as an officer and director from the 1950s to the present that Praefke entered into three-party 
contracts with Tecumseh and its CWDs."
1858,5," Tecumseh asserts that its representative's signature ""merely acknowledged [Industrial's] appointment of Praefke."" (Def.'s App. 
Melius Decl. P 12.) The contract belies this claim, because it states that Tecumseh approval was required for the contract to 
have legal effect. Tecumseh's signature was thus more than merely an acknowledgment that Industrial had taken certain action."
1858,6," Tecumseh asserts that, in practice, it did not use this authority. "
1859,7," As stated above, Tecumseh had already caused Praefke to be ""automaticall terminated"" as an ASD as of March 25, simply by 
terminating Industrial as of that date. Nonetheless, Central Power's declaration that it was deciding which ASDs to take over and 
which would remain (Schlamp Aff. P 31) indicates that it regarded itself as stepping into Industrial's shoes. Central Power 
jumped the gun by informing Praefke that it was terminated on March 24. However, it would seem that at most one day's worth 
of damages flows from this jumping of the gun, as Praefke was terminated the following day by operation of the contract's 
automatic termination clause."
1859,8," Tecumseh asserts that Central Power made this decision unilaterally and without input from Tecumseh. (Def.'s App. Melius 
Decl. P 19.) But this assertion does not contradict Praefke's claim that Tecumseh approved of the decision. If the Central Power-
Tecumseh contract paralleled the Tecumseh-Industrial contract (and Tecumseh has not provided a copy indicating otherwise), 
Central Power is required to select and appoint ASDs in its region, and Tecumseh may terminate Central Power with 10 days' 
notice for failing to do so. (Pl.'s Ex. 9 PP (b-4), (d-1 (ii).) Tecumseh's taking no action after learning that Central Power had 
unilaterally decided not to select or appoint ASDs in its region certainly can be construed as Tecumseh approval. "
1863,9," This case differs from the unpublished decision Scott & Fetzer Co., Kirby Co. Div. v. Peterson, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15289, 
No. 86- C-29-C, 1987 WL 110400 (W.D. Wis. 1987), where Judge Crabb approved a magistrate judge's recommendation that a 
manufacturer was not a grantor of a second-tier distributor's dealership. In that case, unlike here, the manufacturer did not sign a 
contract appointing the distributor; the contract did not expressly reserve rights to the manufacturer; it did not require the 
distributor to gain the manufacturer's permission before carrying out tasks essential to the distributor's duties; and it did not 
include commitments from the manufacturer to the distributor."
1863,10," Tecumseh might at least have cited Implement Service, Inc. v. Tecumseh Products Co., 726 F. Supp. 1171, 1182 (S.D. Ind. 
1989), which held that by virtue of identical ""not a party"" language in the ASD appointment contract there, Tecumseh was not a 
franchisor under the Indiana Deceptive Franchise Practices Act, Ind. Code Ann. § 23-2-2.7-1. However, Implement Service is 
not applicable, because so far as the decision indicates, there, unlike here, Tecumseh did not make commitments or assume 
obligations towards the ASD. Implement Service should be further distinguished because the Indiana Deceptive Franchise 
Practices Act does not declare void and unenforceable contract clauses that vary its effect."
1863,11," Similarly, a court applying the Automobile Dealers' Day in Court Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1222, which grants ""distributors"" certain 
protections from ""manufacturers,"" observed that it would undermine that Act's purpose if a manufacturer could insulate itself from 
liability simply by setting up a network of first-tier distributors and requiring them, pursuant to the terms of their own agreements, 
to impose wrongful demands upon second-tier distributors. See Empire Volkswagen, Inc. v. World-Wide Volkswagen Corp., 627 
F. Supp. 1202, 1209 (S.D.N.Y. 1986). "
1865,12," Tecumseh emphasizes that participation in its 50/50 Yellow Pages co-op program, as well as in Tecumseh-cosponsored 
dealer trainings, was voluntary, rather than mandatory. (Def.'s App. Melius Decl. P 16.) Nonetheless, the Industrial-Praefke 
contract required Praefke to arrange for Yellow Pages listings and other advertisements, and required Praefke to provide dealer 
schools. (Def.'s App. Ex. 1 at 2.) Further, as stated above, Ziegler I requires examining ""the actual dealing of the parties,"" as well 
as their contract or agreement. Ziegler I, 139 Wis. 2d 593 at 606, 407 N.W.2d 873."
1865,13," Tecumseh asserts that it issued these certificates only at Industrial's request (Def.'s Br. in Opp'n to Pl.'s Mot. for Temporary 
Inj. at 9 [hereinafter Def.'s Br. in Opp'n]), but the affidavit Tecumseh cites does not support this claim. "
1866,14, Praefke apparently does not have any specialized facilities required by its position as a Tecumseh ASD. 
1868,15," Praefke itself, in its capacity as an ASD, was the immediate grantor of its RSD dealership. (Def.'s App. Ex. 4.) "

1890,1," The Sales Agreement also included restrictive covenants by which Diffracto agreed not to compete in the Fit Business, and 
Perceptron agreed not to compete in the Finish Business for a five-year period. The ""Finish Business"" was defined to be the 
business of the design, manufacture, sale and servicing of non-contact measurement equipment utilized by customers in 
detecting and eliminating surface defects in the finish of formed parts. SAMI argues that Perceptron's agreement had nothing to 
do with the protection of the assets purchased from Diffracto and characterizes these reciprocal covenants to be a division of the 
market and the elimination of competition. It was SAMI's separate non-compete agreement, however, that Perceptron claimed 
SAMI breached and SAMI challenged as a violation of antitrust law."
1890,2," Carlson conceded at trial that SAMI could have used the SmartProx sensors in other applications that would not have violated 
the non-compete agreement. "
1891,3," Perceptron opposed SAMI's post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law under Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b) on the grounds that it 
was procedurally waived by SAMI's failure to make a motion for judgment as a matter of law ""at the close of all the evidence."" 
See Jackson v. City of Cookeville, 31 F.3d 1354, 1358 (6th Cir. 1994). HN1[
] Technical deviation from the requirement that 
a motion be made at the close of all the evidence is not fatal, however, when the purpose for the requirement has been served. 
See Riverview Investments, Inc. v. Ottawa Comm. Improvement Corp., 899 F.2d 474, 477 (6th Cir. 1990); Boynton v. TRW, 
Inc., 858 F.2d 1178, 1185-86 (6th Cir. 1988) (en banc). We find, as did the district court, that the purpose of Rule 50(b)'s 
requirement was served in this case. The district court considered the motion at the close of the relevant proofs and the rebuttal 
witness's testimony was brief and inconsequential to the issue. See Riverview, 899 F.2d at 477."
1891,4," SAMI titled the motion as one for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, but that is the same as the Rule 50(b) motion now 
termed a motion for judgment as a matter of law. See Jackson 31 F.3d at 1357. "
1892,5," The panel in Ridgway questioned the validity of applying the forum state's standards in this context. Noting that the federal and 
Michigan standards are nearly identical and that one panel cannot overrule another, the rule was nonetheless applied. See 
Ridgway, 114 F.3d at 97 n.3."
1892,6," The Michigan Antitrust Reform Act, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 445.772 (West 1989), adopted language from and is interpreted 
consistent with the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1. See Compton v. Joseph Lepak, D.D.S., P.C., 154 Mich. App. 360, 397 
N.W.2d 311 (Mich. App. 1986). "
1894,7," HN11[
] The elements of this claim are: (1) the existence of a valid business relation or expectancy; (2) that the defendant 
knew of the relationship or expectancy; (3) that the defendant intentionally interfered by improperly inducing or causing a breach 
or termination of the relationship or expectancy; and (4) that defendant's improper or unjustified interference resulted in injury to 
the plaintiff. See Monette v. AM-7-7 Baking Co., 929 F.2d 276, 280 (6th Cir. 1991). "
1895,8," SAMI argues that such relief should be barred by latches in this case because equity does not aid those who slumber on their 
rights. See MedX, Inc. v. Ranger, 788 F. Supp. 288, 294 (E.D. La. 1992). While it would be relevant that Perceptron did not file 
suit until nearly a year after the non-compete agreement had expired, we need not decide whether it could be a complete bar in 
this case. "
1917,1," Although defendant WorldCom, Inc. is currently known as MCI WorldCom, Inc., I follow the parties' lead by referring to the 
entity as ""WorldCom"" in this order. I also refer to ILD Teleservices, Inc. and ILD Telecommunications, Inc. collectively as ""the 
ILD Defendants."""
1917,2," The complaint is not entirely clear as to which defendants were parties to contracts with the state. It can most reasonably be 
read to allege that WorldCom was a party to certain contracts with the state, that the ILD defendants were assignees of 
WorldCom's rights under some or all of these contracts, and that at least one of the ILD defendants also was a party to an 
amended contract with the state. See Compl. (appended as Ex. A to Notice of Removal (Doc. # 1)) PP 1, 3-10, 15, 25, 26, 27."
1917,3," WorldCom's notice of removal relied entirely on federal question jurisdiction and did not assert that this court has subject matter 
jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship. See Notice of Removal (Doc. # 1) P 5. Accordingly, I do not address diversity. 
Moreover, although plaintiffs argue in their motion for remand that federal antitrust law does not completely preempt their 
claims, see Pls.' Mot. for Remand (Doc. # 8) P 18, I need not address this argument because ""WorldCom never asserted that 
the complete preemption doctrine applied to federal antitrust law."" WorldCom's Mem. in Opp'n to Pls.' Mot. for Remand (Doc. # 
13) at 2 n.1."
1917,4," Under 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c), an action removed to federal court shall be remanded ""if at any time before final judgment it 
appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction."" 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c) (Supp. 1996). "
1919,5," Writing for the court in an earlier opinion, Justice Brennan suggested that a claim ostensibly based solely on state law 
nevertheless arises under federal law if ""it appears that some substantial, disputed question of federal law is a necessary 
element of one of the well-pleaded state claims, or that one or the other claim is 'really' one of federal law."" Franchise Tax Bd., 
463 U.S. at 13. If this dictum were construed broadly, it would authorize a non-diverse defendant to remove a state law claim "
1920,," whenever Congress has provided a federal remedy and preempted state law remedies in the field covered by the federal 
remedy. I reject this expansive reading of the Franchise Tax Board dictum because I cannot reconcile it with the Court's more 
cautious approach in Metropolitan Life. Moreover, it is difficult to discern a principled basis for adhering to the general rule that a 
preemption defense ordinarily does not provide a basis for removal while allowing removal if Congress has supplanted state law 
claims with a federal remedy. As long as state court plaintiffs remain free to test the validity of their state law claims against a 
preemption defense in state court, I see no reason why similarly situated plaintiffs should be denied the right to test the validity of 
their claims in state court simply because Congress has chosen to replace preempted state law claims with a right to relief under 
federal law. Accordingly, I decline to construe the Franchise Tax Board dictum to authorize the removal of claims that purport to 
be based exclusively on state law, absent some explicit evidence that Congress intended to authorize the removal of such 
claims. "
1921,6," Several of the decisions cited by WorldCom are simply inapposite. The holding in Bastien v. AT&T Wireless Services, Inc., 205 
F.3d 983 (7th Cir. 2000), depended in large part upon the express preemptive language in 47 U.S.C. § 332(c)(3), a provision 
that governs mobile or wireless communications services (e.g., cellular telephone services). See id. at 986-87; 47 U.S.C.A. § 
332(c)(3) (West 1999). Because the interstate telephone services at issue in the present case do not fall within the scope of § 
332, I cannot look to that section for evidence that Congress intended to create removal jurisdiction over plaintiffs' claims. In re 
Comcast Cellular Telecommunications Litigation, 949 F. Supp. 1193 (E.D. Penn. 1996), depends in part on § 332, see id. at 
1197-98, 1201-02, 1203-04, and is therefore inapposite for the same reason as Bastien."
1921,7," See Arthur R. Miller, Artful Pleading: A Doctrine in Search of Definition, 76 Tex. L. Rev. 1781, 1785-86 n.14 (1998) (maintaining 
that the ""Supreme Court has not articulated sufficiently clear principles to guide lower courts in applying"" the artful pleading 
doctrine). "
