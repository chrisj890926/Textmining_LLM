Transcript of Oral Argument in In re Linerboard Antitrust Litig., No. 01-4353 (before the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, 
recorded in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, July 19, 2002, at 16-17).
305 F.3d 145, *155; 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 18296, **25

 
We consider it useful to identify the precise flashpoint of controversy at stake in Newton. Roscoe Pound taught us 
that HN4[
] the judicial process distinguishes discrete functions in the appellate decisional process: (1) finding or 
choosing (or creating) the law where the dispute is over the choice of the controlling legal precept; (2) if there is no 
dispute as to its selection, a disagreement over its interpretation; and (3) where there is agreement on the precept 
and its interpretation, the sole question is the application of the law to the facts, which Pound described as 
""application of the abstract grounds of decision to the facts of the particular case."" 9 The precise holding in Newton 
was that the facts common to the members of the class did not predominate. No new legal precept was created; no 
new nuance of interpretation was forthcoming. It was merely the application of ruling case law in this court to the 
facts of that case.  [**29]  
HN5[
] The process of justifying a court's decision always requires application of a legal precept to a particular 
factual situation. The application may be purely mechanical, as it is in most cases. If the facts are similar to those in 
an earlier case announcing  [*157]  a rule of law, the doctrine of precedent becomes operative. Where there is no 
quarrel over the choice and interpretation of the legal precept, here Rule 23(b)(3), the root controversy usually is 
traced to a value judgment of whether there is sufficient similarity between the fact situations under comparison. 
Edward R. Levi amply described this kind of assessment when he stated: ""the scope of a rule of law, and therefore 
its meaning, depends upon a determination of what facts will be considered similar. . . . The finding of similarity or 
difference is the key step in the legal process."" 10 To predict a court's actions in a precept-application controversy, 
therefore,  [**30]  requires a prediction of what facts in the compared cases a given court, at a given time, will deem 
either material or insignificant. The facts considered material are ""adjudicative facts,"" described by Hart and Sacks 
as ""facts relevant in deciding whether a given general proposition is or is not applicable to a particular situation."" 11
B.
HN6[
] For Appellants' argument to prevail, therefore, they must demonstrate that the facts in Newton are 
substantially similar to the facts in the case at bar, what logicians call inductive reasoning by analogy, or reasoning 
from one particular case to another. To draw an analogy between two entities is to indicate one or more respects in 
which they are similar and thus argue that the legal consequence attached to one set of particular facts may apply 
to a different set of particular facts because [**31]  of the similarities in the two sets. Because a successful analogy 
is drawn by demonstrating the resemblances or similarities in the facts, the degree of similarity is always the crucial 
element. You may not conclude that only a partial resemblance between two entities is equal to a substantial or 
exact correspondence.
HN7[
] Logicians teach that one must always appraise an analogical argument very carefully. Several criteria may 
be used: (1) the acceptability of the analogy will vary proportionally with the number of circumstances that have 
been analyzed; (2) the acceptability will depend upon the number of positive resemblances (similarities) and 
negative resemblances (dissimilarities); or (3) the acceptability will be influenced by the relevance of the purported 
analogies. IRVING M. COPI & KEITH BURGESS-JACKSON, INFORMAL LOGIC 166 (3d ed. 1996); Arthur L. 
Goodheart, Determining the Ratio Decidendi of a Case, 40 YALE L.J. 161, 179 (1930); JOHN H. WIGMORE, 
WIGMORE'S CODE OF THE RULES OF EVIDENCE IN TRIALS AT LAW 118 (3d ed. 1942); JOHN STUART 
MILL, A SYSTEM OF LOGIC RATIOCINATIVE AND INDUCTIVE 98-142 (8th ed. 1916) (""Two things resemble 
each other in one or more respects; a [**32]  certain proposition is true of one; therefore it is true of the other."").
For Appellants to draw a proper analogy, they had the burden in the district court, as they do here, of showing that 
the similarities in the facts of the two cases outweigh the differences. They cannot do so, for two significant 
reasons. First, in Newton it was clear that not all members of the putative class sustained injuries; here, all 
members sustained injuries because of the artificially increased prices. Secondly, in Newton there were hundreds of

millions of stock transactions involved, thus making the putative class extremely unmanageable; here, an 
astronomical number of transactions is not present. The classes are manageable.
We reversed the district court's determination of class certification in Newton because  [*158]  it involved a putative 
securities class action in which purchasers of stocks charged that their broker-dealers breached their duty to 
execute trades on the most favorable terms reasonably available. Newton, 259 F.3d at 161-163. The gravamen of 
the complaint was that their brokers could have received a better price for securities had they used a computer 
system other than the central [**33]  National Best Bid and Offer system (""NBBO""). The evidence disclosed that on 
some occasions, the NBBO price was better than on other computer systems, at times, the prices were the same, 
and at other times, the NBBO price was worse than on other systems. Id. at 177-180. Under those circumstances, 
we concluded that not every class member was injured by the failure of the brokers to find the best possible price. 
Id. at 187-188. 
Critical to our determination of whether class certification was proper, we noted that in determining how to execute 
a client's order, a broker-dealer must take into account order size, trading characteristics of the security, speed of 
execution, clearing costs, and the cost and difficulty of executing an order in a particular market. Id. We were very 
specific in this respect:
These factors would appear to vary from class member to class member and, for each class member, from 
trade to trade. Whether a class member suffered economic loss from a given securities transaction would 
require proof of the circumstances surrounding each trade, the available alternative prices, and the state of 
mind of each investor at the time the trade [**34]  was requested. This Herculean task, involving hundreds of 
millions of transactions, counsels against finding predominance.
* * * * 
The alleged injuries in Newton arise out of the execution of hundreds of millions of trades, not a single act of 
fraudulent conduct. The distinct facts among the hundreds of thousands of plaintiffs involving hundreds of 
millions of trades will determine whether securities violations occurred. Because plaintiffs' claims will require an 
economic injury determination for each trade, we hold the putative class fails to satisfy the predominance 
requirement.
 Id. at 187, 190.
Contrasting the Newton facts with those in the case at bar, here there was no evidence that the individuals and 
entities who purchased corrugated containers or corrugated sheets from Appellants during the relevant two-year 
period had participated in hundreds of millions of commercial transactions. More important, the Newton court was 
staring a situation in the face where they would necessarily examine every stock purchase or sale because not 
every member of the putative class was injured. By direct contrast, with certain limited exceptions relating to 
purchasers [**35]  whose contracts were tied to a factor independent of the price of linerboard, all purchasers of 
corrugated sheets and boxes were injured. They were all affected by the increased price of linerboard that reflected 
in the price paid by plaintiffs.
For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that we cannot accept the analogue so vigorously urged by Appellants 
because the negative resemblances (dissimilarities) between Newton and the case at bar seriously outweigh the 
positive resemblances (similarities).
VI.
The Court's decision in Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707, 97 S. Ct. 2061 (1977), HN8[
] 
bans Clayton Act lawsuits by persons who are not direct  [*159]  purchasers from the defendant antitrust violator. 
Appellants argue that the district court should have denied class certification, under the teachings of Illinois Brick, 
because members of the proposed classes purchased corrugated sheets or boxes, of which linerboard was a mere 
ingredient, and did not purchase linerboard per se. Appellees respond, as they did in the district court, that the facts 
here come within the purview of our decision and rationale in In re Sugar Indus. Antitrust Litig., 579 F.2d 13 (3d Cir. 
305 F.3d 145, *157; 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 18296, **32

 
1978), [**36]  in which we held that the purchasers of candy made by the sugar manufacturers were not barred 
from bringing suit under the § 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1, and § 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15. 
We posed the question succinctly: Does Illinois Brick bar suit by a plaintiff who purchases directly from the alleged 
offender, but buys a product which incorporates the price-fixed product as one of its ingredients? We held that there 
was no bar.
Our reasoning began with an explication of the rationale behind Illinois Brick:
The Court grounded its conclusion on several bases, including the possibility of exposing the defendant to 
multiple liability and the evidentiary complexities that would arise in apportioning the overcharge among those 
in the chain who had suffered injury. The Court also expressed concern that if the direct purchaser could not 
make a full recovery of the overcharge, the wrongdoer would be able to keep some of the fruits of its illegality. 
Based on this reasoning, the Court held that the plaintiff, which purchased a completed building, was not 
permitted to sue the manufacturer of concrete block which had [**37]  been incorporated into the structure.
 In re Sugar, 579 F.2d at 17. 
We then explained why this rule would not apply to the purchasers of candy made with the price-fixed sugar:
As the defendants here point out, the product which plaintiff purchased competes not with sugar, but with other 
candy, and more than one ingredient determines the price. To this extent, there will be some additional 
complications underlying the damage claims. However, this must not be allowed to obscure the fact that the 
plaintiff did purchase directly from the alleged violator. True, the price-fixed commodity had been combined 
with other ingredients to form a different product. But just as the sugar sweetened the candy, the price-fixing 
enhanced the profits of the candy manufacturers. The situation is the same as if the general contractor which 
sold the building to the plaintiff in Illinois Brick were the manufacturer of the concrete block which went into the 
structure. In that situation, the concern which the Supreme Court expressed about the proration of overcharge 
among a number of entities in the chain would not have been present.
Nor is that problem of allocation among various [**38]  distributors present in the case sub judice. Plaintiff is a 
direct purchaser and, therefore, entitled to recover the full extent of the overcharge.
 579 F.2d at 17-18.
In the case at bar, the district court met this issue head-on, and we agree completely with its analysis. It 
emphasized that the putative class plaintiffs purchased corrugated sheets or boxes directly from Appellants, and, 
like the candy in In re Sugar, which contained allegedly price-fixed sugar, the corrugated sheets and boxes contain 
linerboard that was subject to an agreement on output, which is equivalent to a price-fixing agreement. Accordingly, 
the putative class members are direct purchasers and are entitled to recover the full  [*160]  amount of any 
overcharge. See Gen. Leaseways v. Nat'l Truck Leasing Ass'n, 744 F.2d 588, 594-595 (7th Cir. 1984) HN9[
] (""An 
agreement on output also equates to a price-fixing agreement. . . . [If] firms restrict output directly, price will . . . rise 
in order to limit demand to the reduced supply. . . . Reducing output, and dividing markets have the same 
anticompetitive effects."").
VII.
This is not a securities case. It is an antitrust case involving allegations [**39]  that several United States 
manufacturers of linerboard engaged in a continuing combination and conspiracy in unreasonable restraint of trade 
and commerce in violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1. It is well settled that HN10[
] ""any action to 
enforce any cause of action under section 15, 15a, or 15c . . . shall be forever barred unless commenced within four 
years after the cause of action accrued."" 15 U.S.C. § 15b.
Appellants contend that Appellees' claims are timed-barred because most of the class period--from October 1993 to 
November 1995--ended more than four years before the filing of the sheet and box complaints in May 1999. 
Appellees agree on the time period, but respond that the four-year statute of limitations should be tolled under the 
305 F.3d 145, *159; 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 18296, **35

 
doctrine of fraudulent concealment because they had no knowledge of the alleged conspiracy or of any facts that 
might have led to the discovery thereof in the exercise of reasonable diligence. They contend that it was not until 
approximately February 25, 1998, when the Federal Trade Commission issued a press release, a complaint and a 
proposed consent decree against Appellant Stone Container [**40]  Corporation, describing certain facets of anti-
competitive conduct, that they became aware of Appellants' misadventures.
A.
HN11[
] Although § 15b mandates a four-year statute of limitations for civil antitrust actions, it is well established 
that the doctrine of fraudulent concealment tolls the limitation period when a plaintiff's cause of action has been 
obscured by the defendant's conduct.
In order to establish the applicability of the doctrine, an antitrust plaintiff must show three things: (1) fraudulent 
concealment; (2) failure on the part of the plaintiff to discover his cause of action notwithstanding such 
concealment; and (3) that such failure to discover occurred [notwithstanding] the exercise of due care on the 
part of the plaintiff.
 70 A.L.R. FED. 498 (1984).
Where an action implicating fraudulent concealment is sought to be brought in a class posture, we must decide 
whether the required elements of proof are too individualized to permit such treatment.
""It generally has been recognized that HN12[
] the question of concealment by [an] antitrust defendant is a 
common question, subject to being uniformly resolved on behalf of all members of the class.""  [**41]  In re Flat 
Glass, 191 F.R.D. at 487 (citing In re NASDAQ Market-Makers Antitrust Litig., 169 F.R.D. 493, 519 (S.D.N.Y. 1996); 
In re Fine Paper Antitrust Litig., 82 F.R.D. 143, 154-155 (E.D. Pa. 1979)). ""However, the question of discovery of 
the cause of action by a plaintiff presents an individual question."" Id. ""Similarly, the issue of due diligence seemingly 
raises an individual question."" Id. ""Thus, the broad issue of fraudulent concealment presents both common and 
individual issues; therefore, the determination whether an antitrust action involving fraudulent concealment may 
proceed as a class action turns  [*161]  upon which aspect of the issue may be considered to predominate."" Id. 
(citing Hedges Enters., Inc. v. Cont'l Group, Inc., 81 F.R.D. 461, 476 (E.D. Pa. 1979)).
The cumulative experience of the judiciary has not been uniform in this regard. Some courts have regarded the 
issue of concealment to predominate, and have held that class certification is permissible, even though some 
individual questions are present. Other courts have considered individual questions to be too pervasive to permit it 
to be handled as a class matter. In [**42]  this judicial circuit, there has been a division of authority, with some 
cases supporting each view. 12
 [**43]  B.
Appellants argue that common issues of proof do not predominate with respect to the fraudulent concealment issue 
and that therefore a class action is not the appropriate vehicle for deciding Appellees' claims. International Paper 
Appellant's Brief at 38-43. They suggest that fraudulent concealment involves a ""two-pronged"" inquiry--a 
concealment by the defendant and plaintiff's actual knowledge of it or failure to use due care to discover it--and 
cannot be established unless both prongs are satisfied. In asserting their position, they rely on the language of the 
Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit: ""when the defendant's affirmative defenses (such as . . . the statute of 
12 In some cases, the courts held that common questions predominated, and that class actions therefore were permissible. See 
In re Flat Glass, 191 F.R.D. 472 (W.D. Pa. 1999); In re Sugar Indus. Antitrust Litig., 73 F.R.D. 322 (E.D. Pa. 1976); Hedges

Court cases have expressed the view that questions relating to fraudulent concealment in antitrust class actions do not present 
sufficiently common issues as to permit class action treatment. See Chevalier v. Baird Sav. Ass'n, 72 F.R.D. 140 (E.D. Pa. 
1976); In re Anthracite Coal Antitrust Litig., 78 F.R.D. 709 (M.D. Pa. 1978); Wolfson v. Artisans Sav. Bank, 83 F.R.D. 547 (D.

Meineke Disc. Muffler Shops, Inc., 155 F.3d 331, 342 (4th Cir. 1998) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks 
omitted); see also, Chevalier v. Baird Sav. Ass'n, 72 F.R.D. 140 (E.D. Pa. 1976); In re Anthracite Coal Antitrust 
Litig., 78 F.R.D. 709 (M.D. Pa. 1978); Krehl v. Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream Co., 78 F.R.D. 108 (C.D. Cal. 
1978). [**44]  
They argue that a number of Appellees are barred from asserting a fraudulent concealment defense to the statute 
of limitations because they either had prior knowledge of the conspiracy, or did not act with the requisite due 
diligence, emphasizing that this sort of inquiry is highly personal and is susceptible only to individualized proof and, 
therefore, inappropriate for class treatment. 13
 [**45]  [*162]   To be sure, certain determinations involving the fraudulent concealment defense to the statute of 
limitations will require individualized proof, which might vary among the assorted Appellees. However, most courts 
have refused to deny class certification simply because there will be some individual questions raised during the 
proceedings. In rejecting the rationale in Broussard, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit determined:
HN13[
] Although a necessity for individualized statute-of-limitations determinations invariably weighs against 
class certification under Rule 23(b)(3), we reject any per se rule that treats the presence of such issues as an 
13 Appellants introduced evidence that ""each of the five named plaintiffs stands in a unique position with respect to fraudulent 
concealment that will have to be individually adjudicated if that plaintiff is to recover."" International Paper Appellant's Brief at 46. 
They refer to Lisa Garrett, president of Garrett Paper, who testified that she was ""sure"" that something illegal was afoot when 
Garrett Paper's prices for corrugated boxes increased during the alleged class period, that she ""plain as day told [her] salesman 
that"" Appellants were fixing prices, and that she knew such activity was illegal. International Paper Appellant's Brief at 46-47.
Similarly, Appellants contend that Appellee Oak Valley was also aware of the price increases and allegedly told Stone Container 
that ""you'd better lower your box prices,"" though Oak Valley is uncertain whether that conversation took place during the class 
period. International Paper Appellant's Brief at 47. They emphasize that Oak Valley testified that it ""accepted the increases in the 
matter of course and never really questioned it."" Id. They assert also that although Local Baking now says it had no knowledge 
during the alleged class period of changes in the average market price for corrugated products, or of any downtime taken by 
linerboard manufacturers, Local Baking has testified that it was told by Appellant Stone Container that prices were increasing 
because of a decrease in linerboard. They refer to the testimony of David Halper, president of Alfred I. Halper Corrugated Box 
Co., Inc., who testified that he was aware of the increased prices that Appellants had charged Halper during the class period, 
and that he had even complained to Appellants about the increases. Appellants argue that Halper has no greater knowledge 
today about the existence of a conspiracy than he did during the alleged class period.
Finally, they note that General Refractories sold all of its operating assets in 1994, in the middle of the class period and years 
before any complaint was ever filed in this case. They state that there were no communications, other than invoices, between 
Appellants and General Refractories during the class period, and that General Refractories could not identify any facts 
discovered after the class period that led to filing its complaint, and in particular none that led to the naming of entities other than 
Stone Container as defendants. International Paper Appellant's Brief at 48-49. And, in contrast to Garrett Paper and Halper, 
Appellants contend that General Refractories does not appear to have had any suspicion of wrongdoing during the alleged class 
period based on price increases for corrugated sheets.
It is Appellants' case that the factual complexities relating to these five named plaintiffs underscores the inherently individualized 
nature of a fraudulent concealment analysis. Appellants insist that the named Appellees would have to prove, among other 
things: (1) that Garrett Paper's conceded awareness of alleged illegality does not qualify as actual ""discovery;"" (2) that Garrett 
Paper's considered inaction in the face of such awareness qualifies as ""due diligence;"" (3) that Garrett Paper's asserted small 
size excuses its inaction; (4) that none of the other named Appellees knew or had reason to know about the alleged illegality in 
the exercise of due diligence, even though some of them complained about the price increases whereas others were not even 
aware of those increases; (5) that something was ""fraudulently concealed"" from all putative class members, even though some 
of them have conceded that they are aware of no more incriminating facts now than they were during the alleged conspiracy; (6) 
that unique relationships do not affect the due-diligence inquiry; (7) that named Appellees who claimed not to have known of 
Stone Container's downtime exercised ""due"" diligence, when such downtime was widely publicized in the industry at the time; (8) 
that General Refractories, which went out of business in the middle of the class period, is held to a due-diligence standard even 
after that point; and (9) that alleged oral misrepresentations made to some named Appellees but not others, regarding the 
reasons for the price increases does not affect the due-diligence analysis. Id. at 49-50.

automatic disqualifier. In other words, the mere fact that such concerns may arise and may affect different 
class members differently does not compel a finding that individual issues predominate over common ones. As 
long as a sufficient constellation of common issues binds class members together, variations in the sources 
and application of statutes of limitations will not automatically foreclose class certification under Rule 23(b)(3). 
See 5 JAMES WM. MOORE ET AL., MOORE'S FEDERAL PRACTICE P 23.46[3] (3d ed. 1999). 
Predominance [**46]   [*163]  under Rule 23(b)(3) cannot be reduced to a mechanical, single-issue test.
 Waste Mgmt. Holdings, Inc. v. Mowbray, 208 F.3d 288, 296 (1st Cir. 2000). We accept this reasoning as more 
persuasive than that espoused by the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Broussard.
Notwithstanding the individual determinations that will undoubtedly arise at trial, common issues of concealment 
predominate here because ""the inquiry necessarily focuses on defendants' conduct, that is, what defendants did 
rather than what plaintiffs did."" In re Flat Glass, 191 F.R.D. at 488. Key questions will not revolve around whether 
Appellees knew that the prices paid were higher than they should have been or whether Appellees knew of the 
alleged conspiracy among Appellants. Instead, the critical inquiry will be whether ""defendants successfully 
concealed the existence of the alleged conspiracy, which proof will be common among the class members in each 
class."" Id. 14 It is the fact of concealment that is the polestar in an analysis of fraudulent concealment. It is the 
camouflage that demands attention, the cover up, the acts of obscuring or masking. These allegations of proof 
are [**47]  all common to the defendants, not the plaintiffs. It is not the conspiracy of the defendant that is relevant 
on the issue of tolling the statute of limitations, it is the act of concealing the conspiracy.
C.
Moreover, any individualized facts of fraudulent concealment may be adjudicated [**48]  in the same fashion and at 
the same time as individual damages issues. As a leading treatise on class actions explains: ""Challenges based on 
the statute of limitations, fraudulent concealment, releases, causation, or reliance have usually been rejected and 
will not bar predominance satisfaction because those issues go to the right of a class member to recover, in 
contrast to underlying common issues of the defendant's liability."" NEWBERG & CONTI, NEWBERG ON CLASS 
ACTIONS § 4.26 (3d ed.)
Many courts faced with similar circumstances have certified class status with the expectation that individual 
questions concerning fraudulent concealment can be resolved at a later damages phase. See In re Flat Glass, 191 
F.R.D. at 488 (citing In re Fine Paper, 82 F.R.D. at 154-155) (""Bifurcation of this litigation into liability and damage 
segments remains an option if the predominating elements of the question of fraudulent concealment do not prove 
susceptible to generalized proof.""). See also, In re Indus. Diamonds Antitrust Litig., 167 F.R.D. 374, 385 (S.D.N.Y. 
1996) (Individualized issues raised in fraudulent concealment should be considered when court addresses [**49]  
each putative class member's damage claim.); Town of New Castle v. Yonkers Contracting Co., 131 F.R.D. 38, 43 
(S.D.N.Y. 1990) (holding that individualized claims and defenses on statute of limitations issue can be adjudicated 
in separate determinations of damages).
Accordingly, we hold that common issues of fraudulent concealment predominate.
 [*164]  * * * * 
We have considered all contentions presented by the parties and conclude that no further discussion is necessary.
The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.  
14 See, e.g., Abramovitz v. Ahern, 96 F.R.D. 208, 218 (D. Conn. 1982) (issue of whether fraudulent concealment would toll the 
statute of limitations was common to all class members); In re Plywood Antitrust Litig., 76 F.R.D. 570, 586 (E.D. La. 1976) 
(""fraudulent concealment issues appear to be generally common to all members in each class""); In re Sugar, 73 F.R.D. at 348; 
In re Fine Paper, 82 F.R.D. at 154-155 (""The key question on the issue of fraudulent concealment will relate to whether 
defendants successfully concealed the existence of the alleged conspiracy, and the proof of this contention [what defendants 
did] will necessarily be common among the class members."").

Nothing in federal antitrust legislation prevents the states from allowing indirect purchasers to bring antitrust actions 
under state statutes. The states are authorized to provide a cause of action for indirect purchasers based on their 
states' antitrust laws. Congress has not preempted the field of antitrust law, but rather intends the federal antitrust 
laws to supplement, not displace, state antitrust remedies.
